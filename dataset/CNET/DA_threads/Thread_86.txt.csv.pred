1.1.1	I have an external Hard Drive , as detailed above , that presumably needs drivers to mount in my Mac OS X 10.3 Panther on iBook G3 .	St
1.1.2	Ca n't find any drivers and it 's looking maybe as if the drive does n't have any for Mac OS X .	St
1.1.3	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	I believe this drive has a USB 2.0 interface and no power supply .	St
1.2.2	Unfortunately , your iBook only has USB 1.0 and not enough power up the USB chain to power the drive which could result in a non-mounting drive .	St
1.2.3	If there is a connection on the drive enclosure for an external power supply , that would cover that problem and the drive would mount with no problem .	St
1.2.4	I say , No Problem .	St
1.2.5	You would still be left with the slow USB 1 transfer speeds .	St
1.2.6	What is that , 12Mbs ?	Ques
1.2.7	P	St
1.3.1	Twelve megs sounds about right .	St
1.3.2	However , the drive is in fact powered externally ; it 's a huge brick of a thing actually .	St
1.3.3	Just does n't appear to be mounting .	St
1.3.4	Any ideas my man ?	Ques
1.4.1	Upgrading to the latest revision of Panther ( 10.3.9 ) solved this , I can now successfully use my external drive .	St
1.4.2	Thanks for input .	St
