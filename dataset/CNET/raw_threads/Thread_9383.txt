One day, I downloaded a plethora of MS Windows Updates and installed them. I didn't notice any particular improvements on my PC, but one thing I immediately noticed was, upon startup, my computer goes into a VERY slow and choppy process, culminating with Windows popping my SYSTEM folder onto the desktop for all to see. Aside from the obvious security issues this raises, I suspect it's played a not-insignificant role in slowing down my computer's startup sequence. Does anyone know how I can tell my computer to shut that subroutine off? Thanx, The Wren

Those windows updates dont do anything good they just slow everything down. When i would update from the site i would restart and slower than ever. But im not to familiar with the Me vers of windows but its worth a shot.

How much memory (RAM)? Hard drive total size and free space? Are you running any security programs? Antivirus Antispyware Firewall

Aside from that I occasionally run AdAware and Spybot on this thing. Oh, and I tried using Add/Remove Programs to remove any old Windows updates in the hopes of extracting the offending startup sequence, but to no avail. It still shows my SYSTEM folder...

Hello again, After running the Complete Scan in AVG, it found about 8 Trojan viruses on my computer (all are in a Virus Vault now). Nothing mentioning a partition failure or the like. As for Windows Upgrade Advisor... I'm not sure what this is. Is it another program for me to download, or is it part of ME? When I know what to do with it, I'll let you know what it tells me. Best, The Wren
