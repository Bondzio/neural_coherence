According to the device manager troubleshooter the floppy disk drive is working OK.
However, thanks for the question about the light on the drive itself.
I don't recall seeing the usual operating light so I guess it's the drive at fault.
I won't have access to this PC for a while.
However, I'm surprised Windows XP troubleshooter did not tell me it's the diskette drive at fault if indeed that is the case.Next time I get to this PC, I'll check out the BIOS settings.
Thanks
