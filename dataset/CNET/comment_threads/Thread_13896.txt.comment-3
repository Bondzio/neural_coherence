I have tried to reset the cmos, since the motherboard is gigabyte, there no switch to reset cmos, I just short the two pins.
But it is still not working, I have changed the cpu, changed the power supply, even changed a new motherboard(gigabyte UD3), changed the thermal grease, it just remains the same: after start up, all fans including, cpu fan, power fan, graphic card fan run for two seconds then stop for one second then run again for two seconds and loop in this way.
I am just so mad with this and I wonder if it is possible that the problem is caused by the case?
BTW: I also try to reset cmos by unplug the power and take off the battery.
Is this a right way?
thanks -Hui
