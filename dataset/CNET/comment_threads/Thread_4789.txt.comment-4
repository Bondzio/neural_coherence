And I was surprised it didn't reduce the time as much as I expected.
My thought on this is that at USB 2.0 we are getting close to the &quot;media speed&quot; of your common HDD.
I'll leave this to others and you to research HDD media speed.
What you want may be possible and definitely can be done on non-DRM DVDs but we can't discuss DRM removal (see the forum policies.)
What some don't get is that when you get a commercially made Video DVD (for this example) the license or rights may limit it to play from said media.
I would not want to take on any court case about rips to HDD since too often I find folk will dispose or gift away the DVD and forget to dispose of the digital copy.
So with that we can state that if we are a little more patient then what you ask is possible.
But I've yet to see a DVD 4.7GB media read in single digit minutes.
