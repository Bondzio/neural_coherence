Worked before, now not recognized in my computer, or drive manager, just device manager. PC is XP Pro Sp2. The HD worked 2 weeks ago (it's my music) for Ipod loading. Trying to follow tech suggestions on web:I opened the drive enclosure, checked the cables and jumper. IF I run Western Digital Diagnostics, I get a &quot;Cable Test:Read diagnostics sector error&quot; despite trying different usb cables. I tried GetBackData for NTFS, it shows the drive as only 32GB(???). I am stymied and ready to cry. Any advice? I saw something about moving the actual Western Digital HD out of this case/enclosure to another??

Other cases or a tool I carry in my bag (link only at http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020&cat=HDD ) lets me do that test without having to carry such a case around. Let's hope this is not a test of your backup system. Bob
