Ok heres the situation... every time I go to rebuild my machine It fails out on copying files from any Windows Bootable CD...(Windows XP, 2000, and LongHorn_Beta). The point is the machine gets to copying system files and then goes bad either a single file or a blue screen. I've swapped the HDD, and the CD'S and I even took the HDD and CD and they installed fine on an older box I have. Please I need any suggestion on what to do now.. Oh I have also reseated the memory IDE cables and changed CD-ROM drives. The only thing I haven't done yet was reseat the CPU... I hate having to move those things. The machine is also rather dusty.. I just want this thing to work... any help greatly welcome. Thanks, Ray.

No mention of your complete machine parts list, but I often just pop in a 450 Watt PSU and try again. 2. Set the FSB (a BIOS setting) from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 MHz. (Beats crashing and hair loss) 3. Pull the case cover, point a fan at the internals. 4. Just one stick of ram. Then try another stick. Don't NOT count that the ram works in another machine. Needs to work in this machine. Best of luck, Bob

If the problem crops up under 3-different OS installs, I would look at more memory(check ram) or yet another CD drive. I *assume* the OS cds are legit and not copies which can introduce problems also. -OR- you maybe better off doing a fresh install if you're upgrading or reloading or trying a dual-mode install with win9x, etc.. Maybe, also the h/w just is too old as XP or even W2K become picky on that issue. You just can't take anything for granted. -----Willy

That might be the problem I have an Athlon K7 1.2 gig chip on a K7SEM board... and I took it all apart last night and the heatsink was mighty dirty... I removed the fan from the top and cleaned it out the best I could... I reseated the CPU and heatsink and cleaned the fan... there is another fan in the box so air flow shouldn't be an issue. I'm going to go get my *legit* cd's and try again I can't give up Oh and btw the memory chip is 512DDR pc 133. It should work fine It did in my other machine. Thanks for the help.

The chip is rather new and unused... 512DDR SDRAM...PC 133. and the cd-rom was swapped I cleaned some dust out of the heat sink and fan and I'm taking my perfectly legit CD's and going to try again tonight wish me luck!!!
