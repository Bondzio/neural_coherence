Unit has been running fine for almost 2 yrs with no system changes or issues. Kid just loaded software for a polaroid camera. The software install went fine and required a restart. After that, the pc wont turn on. Power to the PSU is fine. When the PC is switched on, the cooling fans come on for a few seconds, then stop. I replaced the power supply with a bigger one and the same problem occurs. I tried disconnecting components and still get the same results. The case is cleaned and there is no dust accumulation on any of the surfaces or in the heat sinks. I am really stumped at this point. It is a cheap machine and I am wondering if i should harvest the HDD and RAM and replace the whole unit with a new, inexpensive one - it's just for my kids to surf and do basic word processing stuff.... Any opinions or suggestions out there?

If you want to have it checked out find a computer shop with a low bench fee as a final check. I did this and for 35 US dollars was told what I had already guessed. There could be a cheap fix for the Persario but you may spend more time and energy fixing it than it is worth. If it's your hobby go for it. By all means pull HDD (security reasons). But the ram may not be usable in a newer machine. I would pull ram if I knew what type/spec. Label all parts and bag'em (anti-static bag or leave in case). You can recycle the drive as a slave in another computer. Please understand that the drive may be fried as well so don't lose any sleep over it. I hope this helps.

I love to tinker, but am short on time and my teenage daughter was going through IM withdrawl symptoms... so for a $49 bench fee and the price of an inexpensive replacement motherboard all is in working order again.
