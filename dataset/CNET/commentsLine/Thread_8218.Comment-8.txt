i didn't think to check if all the mounting posts were actually under the holes on the board, though i want to say they are.
it will definitely be something worth double checking.
hopefully there is something there that is causing the issue, as i am fairly frustrated at this point.
i will hope that the manual is right, because it could be fairly nightmarish trying to refit all those little pins over and over until it works.
(i'm not overly tech-savvy, but get the gist of where things are supposed to be.)
