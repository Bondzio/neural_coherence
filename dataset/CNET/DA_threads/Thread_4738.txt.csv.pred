1.1.1	My computer won't power up and it's likely that the issue is either the power supply or motherboard.	St
1.1.2	The computer is old and not worth fixing.	St
1.1.3	My fiance is a classical pianist and all of his performance recordings are on the hard drive (no, I don't know why he didn't have them backed up somewhere else).	St
1.1.4	I would rather not go through the hassle of installing that hard drive as a secondary hard drive in another computer because of it's age.	St
1.1.5	Once I have the files off of it, I have no further need of it.	St
1.1.6	I read someone else's post about a similar issue where they said you could hook the hard drive up to the new computer's CD drive (not an actual &quot;new&quot; computer, just a different computer than the dead one), copy the files and re-install the CD.	St
1.1.7	This sounds like it should be easier and quicker.	St
1.1.8	Can anyone confirm if this is a viable method?	St
1.1.9	Also, are there any other ways to accomplish this task that would work better?	St
1.1.10	I want to do this as quickly and cheaply as possible.	St
1.1.11	Thanks so much for all of your help.	St
1.2.1	The other thing which I want to point out is to look at the jumper setting of the cd-rom drive and set the harddrive the same.	St
1.2.2	Good luck.	St
