<s> I have narrowed my desktop search down to 2 Gateway computers. </s>
<s> The perfect one for my needs seems to be the sx2840. </s>
<s> It is a great computer for the price and performance you get. </s>
<s> But, since I have $600 in Bestbuy gift cards and they do not carry this Gateway model, I am having a hard time deciding what to do. </s>
<s> They do however carry the DX4831-01e for a great price. </s>
<s> Both computers seem VERY similar (CNET gave the SX2840 slightly better reviews) so my question is, what is the main difference between these computers? </s>
<s> And am I going to be dissapointed with going with the DX instead of the SX??? </s>
<s> Any advice would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris </s>

<s> To be a bit beefier with more weight, larger power supply, more PCI slots, one more USB port and such. </s>
<s> The rest is identical. </s>
<s> The i3 CPU is a nice choice over the older core 2 duo and even older machines. </s>

<s> I guess the tower is bigger on the DX, but I have plenty of room so that is not a concern. </s>
