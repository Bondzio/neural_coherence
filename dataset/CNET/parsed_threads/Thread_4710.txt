<s> Hey everyone, I recently reinstalled my Windows 7 Ultimate OS after a hardware issue. </s>
<s> After I reinstalled the OS, I realized that I could no longer record system audio with any program like I could originally. </s>
<s> I guarantee this computer must have an audio card, other-wise how'd I record the audio before? </s>
<s> So, can anyone help me with this issue? </s>
<s> But head to dell.com and &quot;Use your service tag for all the drivers and apps for your machine. </s>
<s> No need for anyone here to list those drivers since dell gets them for you with your service tag. </s>
<s> Bob&quot; </s>
