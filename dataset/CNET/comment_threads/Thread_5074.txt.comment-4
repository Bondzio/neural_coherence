When I get a Blue Screen its all about Hardware.. .. Did you ORDER the Correct machine for the Software and hardware.. ..
Example...for Multi-Media you really need a Pentium 4 Processor as minimum..the Celeron D is a Audio ONLY CPU.. .. Also if you ordered a Video Card installed I might check that for the problem-since that's an ADVANCED User's part..your supplier might have that installed wrong.. ..
If this is your First PC/your definitely in trouble on the money side..
It may have a Built in Defect from the Supplier..and if you intercede thay can PULL the WARRANTY.. You may want to CONTACT a Consumer Advocate in your Local Area for help on the issue of a defective PC.
