hehehe... well it turns out at present that the link you supplied is broken (white blank screen).
but i can get the gist of the suggestion... seeing as how they are two consecutive connections, one &quot;on top of&quot; the other, it looks to me like the right angle of the first would interfere with the second or vice versa... there's gotta be a way.
i researched and researched and nothing said anything about this.
they say they don't take returns.
