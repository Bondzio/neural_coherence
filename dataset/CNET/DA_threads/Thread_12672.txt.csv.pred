1.1.1	hi there , need to know the way of setting my printer to print black and white only , i could n't find an option to let me print out pages in black and white ... . thanks for any help .	Ques
1.1.2	also , one of my friend got his printer set up into 2 printer accounts , one 's for balck and white and the other is for colour , so when he wants to print colour , he just pull the colour one down the list , just wan na know if my printer allows that to happen .	St
1.2.1	My experience with printing high quality black and white prints is to pick & quot ; greyscale & quot ; in the advanced print setup .	St
1.2.2	The R210 will then use the black cartridge for the black plus a mixture of cartridges for the shades of grey .	St
1.2.3	It will also show you which cartirdges it will use .	St
1.2.4	A very nice touch !	St
1.2.5	I presume for a picture that is just hard black and white , the printer will only use the black cartidge .	St
1.2.6	However , the R210 will attempt to reproduce as precise a print as it can , so any level of grey will bring the colour cartridges into play , just check in advanced settings .	St
1.2.7	I hope that helps .	St
