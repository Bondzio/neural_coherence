hi to everyone and thanks in advance for any help... i think that my isp is throttling my bandwidth at the modem and i am here to ask help on how access full available bandwidth.
when the technician installed the fibre optic line and then the modem, he showed me an amazing 77mb/s (about 600mbps) before the modem!!
but after the technician left these were the test results after the router: 1) speedtests.net: averages, after router, show: up between 56/60mbps & dn 45/75mbps 2) local server speed test: average: up 45mpbs & dn 170mbps a japanese internet savvy guy explained that ntt east throttles the available bandwidth at the building by specific apartment/modem settings related to individual contract bundles.
i signed up for the top bundle: tv, phone and internet connections.
this is my hardware/software setup: os: win7, line specs: line type: iec60874-14 connector type: sc core across: 9 micrometers clad across: 125 micrometers itu-tg-652 ntt east fibreoptic tv/internet/telephone bundle (100mbps best effort) hikari next family type but 10mbps is considered within parameters asahi isp internet contract modem: ge-pon (wan+coaxial tv antenna) &quot;scm-ge-pon-&lt;h&gt;a gv-onu d&lt;1&gt;&quot; model router: rt-s300hi (4 giga ports + 1 phone) router & modem have japanese firmware which i cannot understand and, according to the ntt east, i must rent both modem and router from them and &quot;will not support any other modem/router setup&quot;.
i could not understand if it was because of technical or contractual limits.
i have tried to test my throughput after the modem but i could not figure out where the dns, ip, wan etc strings of numbers should go and, in the end, i simply cannot connect to the internet from my laptop directly to the modem so i cannot perform the same speed tests after the modem.
i appreciate help and i thank in advance for reading thus far and for any help and expertise which any one can spare/offer!
