thank you to those who replied.
i got the wow pad today and i cannot even believe it - my mouse is working perfectly!
*knocks on wood* love this pad b/c it is super thin.
i don't particularly like using a mouse pad to begin with but with this one it is so thin and large that i hardly notice it (except the mouse glides much easier on it than on the desk).
i never even thought that would be a problem b/c i was under the impression that laser mice worked on any surface except glass.
i have a wood grain desk and thought that would be fine.
i also went to best buy to try out some mice and the logitech g5 was my favorite fit, next was the g9.
did not like the razer mice - way too flat for me.
they did not have the sidewinder to try and they also did not have the mice out of the packages so i had to feel them in the plastic.
staples had them out but had none of the mice i was interested in.
i probably don't even need a new mouse now thanks to your great advice, but if i do i will probably stay with logitech.
perhaps i'll wait for that new one that was mentioned to come out to have a good corded mouse on hand should anything happen in the future as far as the palm vs claw grip: i did some research on what each is and mostly hold my mouse in a palm grip but i did notice that for some games that need greater/more precise movement, i pull my palm up slightly and use my fingers more.
i see they call that the fingertip grip.
i suppose i actually use both grips, depending on what i'm doing and i do not use the claw grip at all (although i also found some people consider the fingertip grip and claw grips to be essentially the same thing - my fingers stay pretty flat which is why i think it's probably not considered a claw).
well, thanks again everybody.
your help was greatly appreciated!
