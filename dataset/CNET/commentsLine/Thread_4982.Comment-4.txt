you less than likely damaged your 512mb stick.
usually with hp and compaq products their motherboards are made for a certain load of ram, the older the computer, the less upgradeable it is.
in your case, hp could have the motherboard in such a way that it can only use a maximum of say 512mb = 2x256mb instead of 512mb+256mb, therefore with a lot of the machines if you add ram above what the motherboard can handle, only so much more will be taken advantage of.
consequently, it becomes a disfactor as it will slow down the machine.
if you have 2 memory slots you could try 2x256mb and see how that works.
if that doesnt work either, you could always return the extra stick too.
another thing you could do is call hp (if you still have coverage) and tell them you want to upgrade your ram.
they will ask for your model # etc and will tell you what the maximum ram is.
