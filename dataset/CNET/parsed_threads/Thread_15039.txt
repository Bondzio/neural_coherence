<s> What's the best method to clean out my old hard drives of data and viruses for reuse? </s>
<s> I have some older internal hard drives that I'd like to convert into external drives so I can use them for backups on my new machine. </s>
<s> Now some of these drives have viruses and malware on them and I'd like to completely wipe them free of them so they will not come back to bite me. </s>
<s> Should I use an antivirus like Avast to quarantine the viruses and malware first, and then use CC Cleaner to do a single-pass setting and reformat the drive? </s>
<s> Would that be efficient enough? </s>
<s> Or is there a better method to reformat these drives to ensure they are clean and ready for reuse? </s>
<s> Bottom line: what would you do? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the advice! </s>
<s> -- Submitted by Graham P. </s>
<s> If you have no intention of trying to retrieve data from the older drives, why not simply reformat & the check the disc integrity? </s>
<s> I have never found a virus or malware on a freshly formated drive. </s>
<s> If they are already infected, I take them to a separate machine that has an antivirus installed, one that I use just for this purpose, plug them in as external devices and immediately format them at least twice. </s>
<s> Not the quick format option, but the full format. </s>
<s> If there is sensitive data on the drive, then I use a wiping method that does at least 7 passes or the data can be retrieved using various tools. </s>
<s> So to sum up: you can plug them into a different computer that has the antivirus installed, right click on the drive and then hit format or tools/format depending on the OS. </s>
<s> If there is sensitive data on the drive that you don't want retrieved ever, use the CCleaner wipe feature with 7 passes minimum or use Eraser. </s>
<s> Format the drive using the Full method. </s>
<s> Then open a command prompt and run &quot;cipher /w x:\ &quot; (Without the quotes, where X: is the drive letter of the drive in question. </s>
<s> This works for Windows OS'es from Windows 2000 onward. </s>
<s> For Vista, Windows 7 (and I assume, Windows 8) you will probably have to run CMD as an administrator. </s>
<s> This method uses tools (format and cipher) available within the OS; no need to download anything! </s>
<s> Use DBAN: http://www.dban.org/download Burn the ISO to a DVD, put the hard drives in a computer with no other hard drives connected, boot DBAN up, choose a wiping algorithm (DoD Short would be fine), and then let it wipe. </s>
<s> It'll have all the data wiped and safe for you to format (quick format) in Windows and be clear of viruses. </s>
<s> Reformatting is the best thing you can do. </s>
<s> However, while not necessary, you can use disk wiper tools like Eraser or CCleaner. </s>
<s> These tools will rewrite every sector of data with new data. </s>
<s> Any virus hiding will be overwritten, but like I said, reformatting should be enough. </s>
<s> But on the plus side, doing a full disk rewrite will make it very difficult for any one to recover any data that is on the hard drive. </s>
<s> Even if you reformat the drive data can still be recover. </s>
<s> And you can you encrypted backup to make you data safe, in case someone steal your hard drives. </s>
<s> Also don't do a full rewrite on SSD (Solid State drives), it will not work property and you will use up more of the read/write cycles. </s>
<s> Use the disk manufacturers software or Acronis to set up the drives as new ones. </s>
<s> Then do a full reformat. </s>
<s> I've used Dban on dozens of drives both IDE and SATA over the last couple of years. </s>
<s> I have never had a problem. </s>
<s> I keep an old PC set up at work to boot from the cd, then I can just plug a drive in, power up and type autonuke at the prompt to wipe the drive. </s>
<s> Viruses and spyware generally reside as programs files and the data are usually fine. </s>
<s> therefore as long as no programs can run from that drive you will be able to work on in internally. </s>
<s> Quick format on your own computer will work as long as the infected drive is a secondary drive and you will be the one using it again. </s>
<s> This will just 'delete' files which will only change the first bit of the name and make to rest of the sectors available to be written over. </s>
<s> This quick and dirty method will be fine as long as you just start using the disk it will be fine overwriting all files over time. </s>
<s> The upside is convenience. </s>
<s> The other side (I don't say downside because it may not be) is that the files COULD be recovered as long those particular locations have not been overwritten. </s>
<s> The next level is a full format which is really not different form quick format except it also reads sector by soector and locates bad sectors, separating them out. </s>
<s> Wiping - as offered with CCleaner or other programs mentioned. </s>
<s> That will will overwrite the sector making recovery almost impossible. </s>
<s> The more times it is over written the more secure the disk. </s>
<s> Hi Graham Good to know that you intend to re-cycle your old HD's. </s>
<s> Smart move and you save money. </s>
<s> I'd agree with the other community members that reformatting the drives is all that you need do. </s>
<s> Just make sure to use the Full format option and not the Quick format. </s>
<s> After formatting you can still run a virus/malware removal program. </s>
<s> Although I'd be surprised if the program detects anything. </s>
<s> But you never know and you can never be too safe when dealing in the cyber-world of computers. </s>
<s> So do what makes you feel the safest. </s>
<s> There's one other option and that's to take the drives to a professional and let them sanitize the drive(s). </s>
<s> Of course you'll pay a price for that type of service. </s>
<s> Graham, you said these are old &quot;internal&quot; HD's. </s>
<s> That means either: (a) you've already removed them - or - (b) they are still inside another computer yet to be removed If (b ) then hopefully the computer is still operable so that you can perform the reformat operation, if not you'll have to remove the drive. </s>
<s> After removing the drive you still have to make it recognizable as a HD to another computer that is capable of running the reformat option (not to mention recognizable to be used as a storage device). </s>
<s> Not to worry...you can purchase a USB enclosure that will make the drive recognizable to any computer and format-able to any OS. </s>
<s> Just purchase the right size enclosure for the drive. </s>
<s> As a rule most Laptop HD's are 2.5 inch and Case HD's are 3.5 inch. </s>
<s> 2.5 inch drives in a case are rare but not unheard of. </s>
<s> The next step in buying the proper enclosure is to determine if the HD you are wanting to convert to external storage is IDE or SATA. </s>
<s> If it is the former be sure to purchase an enclosure that is IDE to USB as there is a necessary circuitry conversion to make the IDE-HD recognizable to the modern computer which are commonly built with SATA controllers. </s>
<s> Firewire connection is available on some enclosures. </s>
<s> Once you have the HD snugly in its new enclose plug it in to any USB equipped computer and run the Full format option. </s>
<s> Windows will format the drive to NTFS standards. </s>
<s> Apple products will format the drive to HFS+. </s>
<s> If you would like to use the same drive between a Windows and a Mac OS then format the drive to FAT32. </s>
<s> FYI, some enclosures come with a power supply and others may have two USB connections to draw sufficient power. </s>
<s> But in most scenarios a single USB connection is all that is required for the 5400 RPM HD. </s>
<s> HD enclosures can be purchased from just about any well known computer retailer either on-line or brick-n-mortar (including Amazon and eBay). </s>
<s> Those made from aluminum or a metal alloy are the best as they dissipate heat more effectively. </s>
<s> Prices range from $7.00 to $50.00 although I'd avoid the bargain basement price. </s>
<s> You get what you pay for. </s>
<s> I hope this information is helpful. </s>
<s> Good luck with your project. </s>
<s> T ogether E veryone A chieves M ore </s>
<s> With ether one you can boot into a Linux environment and then safely format or DOD scrub the disks. </s>
<s> Hi Graham, good advice so far. </s>
<s> What I would do is download the live CD version of Partition Wizard ISO and burnit to a CD, then boot from the CD. </s>
<s> Use Partition- Modify-Hide Partition to hide all the disk(s) you don't want to reformat. </s>
<s> This isn't strictly necessary but it will prevent any possibility of infection from the disks you are reclaiming. </s>
<s> Then for each disk you want to reclaim, Use Partition Wizard Partition-Delete and select the &quot;Secure Erase&quot; option. </s>
<s> for all partitions on the disk. </s>
<s> This will delete the partition(s) and overwrite with binary zeros. </s>
<s> Your disk is now clean and empty. </s>
<s> Use Partition Wozard to allocate whatever partition(s) you want to define on the disk, You might even want to rebuild the MBR (master Boot Record) to make sure that is clean too. </s>
<s> When you've done this for all disks, unhide the partitions you originally hid and reboot the machine into Windows. </s>
<s> Format (Full Format) all of the new partitions you created above and you are done. </s>
<s> This will take some time but you can guarantee there is no malware on any of the diisks. </s>
<s> Good Lick! </s>
<s> Use your Windows OS install disk to delete all existing partitions, create as many paritions as you want (one partition using all the available space would be fine) and format. </s>
<s> Don't complete the OS installation, since you only need storage. </s>
<s> With the price of externals today I cant imagine your saving any money by doing what you are doing especially since you have to ask in a forum about existing viruses you say you have already and assuming they do have a virus and just not defective in general . </s>
<s> You can buy thumbdrives bigger than an old hard drive or get cloud. </s>
<s> If you think a cloud is made out of water vapor then I would suggest using a PS3 for your computing needs. </s>
<s> If you've got the drive bays... you can eliminate the external case and USB/eSATA cables; handling, etc. </s>
<s> My sense ...drives are a whole lot more reliable when used as internals than as externals. </s>
<s> Just read the CNET forums....they're full of tearful please about problems with external HDDs. </s>
<s> Good Luck VAPCMD </s>
<s> as far as data is concerned, including the toughest virus' and malware by using Ddban. </s>
<s> You have multiple methods of erasing right up to military secrecy strength of erasure which will allow for any level of paranoia (like mine). </s>
<s> Virus like Conficker (Downadup) were able to reactivate after quick format, although full format got the job done, but there is nothing like not having that nagging doubt. </s>
<s> I would reformat and repartition. </s>
<s> Best way to make sure it is as clean as it can be. </s>
<s> The best thing to do to clean old hard drives is to remove it from computer , connect to different computer via usb or as internal slave and format it twice any data will be cleaned off it. </s>
<s> Unless you are worried the CIA or MI5 will recover something top secret, a full format will do the job. </s>
<s> You don't need anything else. </s>
<s> Glenlo At first glance judging from the title of your response it appeared that it may have had merit. </s>
<s> WRONG!! </s>
<s> Everyone in this community has the right to ask a legitimate question without being subjected to ridicule or vicious insensitive comments for having asked. </s>
<s> Sarcastic, pseudo-intellectuals like you who can' t seem to see pass their own nose are the individuals who need reprimanding and correction. </s>
<s> It appears to me that your head may be composed of &quot;water vapor&quot; (more on that later) and obviously stuck in a &quot;Cloud&quot; of ignorance, stupidity and a lack of consideration for others! </s>
<s> Now as far as the composition of a cloud here are couple of links that may enlighten you because judging from your sarcastic comment you may actually believe that the composition of a cloud is entirely of &quot;water vapor&quot;: http://www.vsgc.odu.edu/src/Conf09/UnderGrad%20Papers/Ojo%20-%20Paper.pdf http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm </s>
<s> There are virus that can exist after a format, these reside in the MBR or the &quot;drive FAT&quot; that helps eliminate bad drive areas&quot; part of the manufacturing process. </s>
<s> These are real sneaky or profound threats, so don't discount their presence, while formatting can work for typical re-use, I find using a &quot;disk wiper&quot; better suited. </s>
<s> The wiper doesn't format per se, but does clean any old data and setting or OS FAT tables, once done you use the OS setup which will format as usual and prepare the HD. </s>
<s> I had great success with DBAN and KILLDISK, both free versions, run once and then later reformat HD for use. </s>
<s> Also, take a grain of advise don't use too old of HDs, they still crash even in ext. </s>
<s> USB cases. </s>
<s> A good 16gb flash drive is better for typical use rather than dragging an 40gb around even if more space, but you can use it all once practiced. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> You format those drive and if you want to make shure that evrything is erase you can use file shredder it's a freeware that you can find there http://www.fileshredder.org/ This freeware will be helpfull over every drive you have. </s>
<s> Instead of using the thrash can you can safely erase what you really don't need. </s>
<s> After using file shredder your drive will be clean as a brand new one. </s>
<s> I have always used Micro2000's Eraser Disk. </s>
<s> Extract from their website reads:- &quot;Protect the security and privacy of your confidential data. </s>
<s> Sterilize old hard drives with EraserDisk, a utility for decommissioning drives correctly followed by low-level formatting the disk . </s>
<s> These actions exceed the US Government's security requirements of D0D 5520.22-M, the most prevalent standard for cleaning a hard drive. </s>
<s> Wipe the hard drive clean with up to seven disk erase passes that over-write with varied data, including a low-level format for complete sterilization, and use the test utility to make sure you've really wiped that drive clean.&quot; It costs around $40 but is well worth it. </s>
<s> I have also used the disk to low level format new drives. </s>
<s> Mike.M </s>
<s> This is the Windows NT-based (Win 2000 thru 7) disk management software. </s>
<s> Start it up, delete the old disk partition, format, and then reboot. </s>
<s> If its absolutely necessary to prevent contact with your current system, go the drive manufacturer's web site, get their maintenance software and have it format, with a preference for a &quot;low level&quot; format, if applicable. </s>
<s> A low level format is what the factory does before it ships and new hard out of the factory, testing and erasing everything and keeping track of know errors that occur during manufacture. </s>
<s> If you do this, you will catch and new bad sectors that may have developed over the years; if the hard drive locks these out, Windows will NEVER try to use them again. </s>
<s> Most manufacturers have an ISO volume that you can burn to CD/DVD and boot your machine with it after attaching the new drives. </s>
<s> This requires GREAT DETAIL and choose the wrong drive and it's &quot;bye-bye irreplaceable pictures of auntie Agnes!&quot; And, nice job using technology to its physical limits; I've had 12 yo drives that ran perfectly fine but just made me nervous so I finally retired the old things. </s>
<s> They eventually make nice clocks, LOL </s>
<s> I have formatted and re-used many HDDs both my own and drives obtained from others, a complette format and installation of an operating system has prooved successfull as long as the drive is working ok. </s>
<s> However, even after formatting the files are still recoverable. </s>
<s> These files should not cause any problems. </s>
<s> If you want to see these files, install a recovery program. </s>
<s> Search CNET for pandora recovery software,this is a free program and will find 1000s of files on a formatted drive. </s>
<s> The only way to clean a drive is to &quot;destroy&quot; it. </s>
<s> Hi you can download this program for free, I cant remember the name of the site it could have been on Cnet. </s>
<s> This program called Revo Uninstaller it has a program called &quot; Unrecoverable Delete &quot; just click on Tools in Revo and scroll down to the bottom of the page it will be on the left side. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
<s> I've read all the comments, and not one of them mentioned whether the drive was worth saving. </s>
<s> Today's new drives are so superior to those even just a few years ago were the norm. </s>
<s> A new hard drive is not that expensive. </s>
<s> Unless you just have to do it, first check to make sure you have some life in that old hard drive. </s>
<s> Reformatting is enough in some cases. </s>
<s> However there are viruses that survive formatting, most recently the FBI virus and in the past, msblast. </s>
<s> So to save time and cover all my bases. </s>
<s> I delete the partition, create a new partition and then format. </s>
<s> I have never had a virus survive that...so far. </s>
<s> I realize this isn't technically an answer to your question, but why mess around when you can spend 50-75 bucks on a decent sized drive that's new and reliable? </s>
<s> I use Killdisk to clean my drives. </s>
<s> Freeware that does a good job. </s>
<s> Just put in on a CD, floppy, thumb drive, and boot to it and run the program. </s>
<s> This is assuming you're not interested in any of the data on the drive. </s>
<s> I use it at work to clean the drives of old/replaced PCs before we dispose of them. </s>
<s> Typically we donate them or offer them for free to whoever wants them. </s>
<s> It saves us the cost of recycling. </s>
<s> People can get a usable PC that's still good for most everyday use. </s>
<s> Usually 4-5 years old. </s>
<s> Purchase Wipe Drive,it completely wipes your hard drive. </s>
<s> Formatting and Repartitioning does not delete data. </s>
<s> Quote you said: &quot;Everyone in this community has the right to ask a legitimate question without being subjected to ridicule or vicious insensitive comments for having asked. </s>
<s> Sarcastic, pseudo-intellectuals like you who can' t seem to see pass their own nose are the individuals who need reprimanding and correction. </s>
<s> &quot; And then you said: &quot;It appears to me that your head may be composed of &quot;water vapor&quot; (more on that later) and obviously stuck in a &quot;Cloud&quot; of ignorance, stupidity and a lack of consideration for others!&quot; It's ironic that you say the same thing that you claim to dislike so much. </s>
<s> Shame on you. </s>
<s> If the hard drives are decent size for storage, then I would just try any one of the methods mentioned by the many different inputs from others. </s>
<s> Reformatting by using the OS is a great way to do it. </s>
<s> But if the drives are small and old school IDE drives, then maybe it's time to spend a little bit of cash, and invest in a new SATA drive for storage. </s>
<s> Get a big one at least 1TB, that has 32MB Cache or greater. </s>
<s> And yes, trying to reuse instead of tossing away, is always a good thing. </s>
<s> I was reading through the answers and noticed something missing, at least from what I've used with my own practices. </s>
<s> In the days past, I used to first use FDISK to delete the MBR (s) from any disc I was going to reuse, whereupon I would create a new MBR and do a full format followed by check disc (scandisk now?) </s>
<s> with full and fix arguments. </s>
<s> As others have noted, a full format should do the trick but in the Fat32 days (and previous) there were copies of boot records that a few tricky viruses would contaminate. </s>
<s> Partition magic was a program I used to also use to more easily mess with boot records and such using a GUI. </s>
<s> It also gave some pretty obscure options to use for formatting which I would think would scramble things nicely. </s>
<s> I believe you could disconnect any &quot;good&quot; drives you have in your computer, connect the drive (s) you want to wipe and boot from the CD with Partition Magic on it (or another utility of the same nature) Wipe the discs and away you go to install it into an enclosure of your choice. </s>
<s> Nice job of one of the other reviewers to make sure you are using a PATA or SATA that applies to the disc (s) in question however getting an enclosure that will work for you might be worth doing a little research and looking for ratings on such. </s>
<s> I have several enclosures from way back when and remember that a couple of them worked well and a couple didn't. </s>
<s> They also make a handy little cable that comes with a power supply. </s>
<s> You can plug it into a USB port and connect it to 3.5&quot; and 2.5&quot; PATA drives as well as SATA drives. </s>
<s> I use that thing much more often than I use the enclosures. </s>
<s> I also like some of the &quot;drive caddy&quot; sorts of options that are available if you have many drives you want to use for data or what not. </s>
<s> You can just basically have it on your desk top and plug a drive into it, use it for what you need and remove it without having to have several external cases for each drive (if you have several) Hope any of this is useful to you. </s>
<s> FR </s>
<s> If you are concerned that malware could be on the drives, boot from a CopyWipe CD and wipe the drive: http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/copywipe.php I recommend unplugging your main drive and only connecting the drive you want to wipe. </s>
<s> Using this method your operating system will not be active, so there should be no way to infect the boot drive. </s>
<s> CopyWipe will wipe every sector on the disk. </s>
<s> If you have old drives, it is probably better to wipe and recycle them than use them. </s>
<s> Old drives are slower and may not be reliable. </s>
<s> CopyWipe can do multiple writes with random data so that your data cannot be retrieved. </s>
<s> Dear all, My apologies for adding to the question, but I did not know hoe to proceed. </s>
<s> I too am keen to know the same, with one added question: Please let me know how I can use my older HDDs as external storage devices. </s>
<s> Do I have to buy a special external connector with power supply? </s>
<s> How does it work? </s>
<s> I am really keen to know the technicalities. </s>
<s> I have a SATA 160 GB and an IDE 40 GB HDD which I would love to put to use, to store data externally. </s>
<s> Please do help with this question. </s>
<s> With thanks, </s>
<s> I work as a DST and hold multiple tech certs and there are some good ideas in this thread. </s>
<s> A few things to keep in mind... there are viruses and malware which can reside in the boot sectors. </s>
<s> Kaspersky has a free tool for getting rid of these which a standard format cannot remove. </s>
<s> After running this, check the integrity of the drive bygoing into a command line and run: chkdsk /r /f Reboot as needed. </s>
<s> After chkdsk completes, reboot the system. </s>
<s> You are now ready to wipe the drive.Ccleaner can do this but not recommended as wiping a drive while it's in use may not fully wipe everything especially the MBR records. </s>
<s> It's best to use a bootable flash drive with a wipe program. </s>
<s> I prefer Wipedrive. </s>
<s> The pro version does a DoD level wipe. </s>
<s> However, the free version is fine for standard users, especially if you are planning to reuse them again. </s>
<s> You need to write the disk to 0's in order to ensure that all the old data is gone. </s>
<s> In particular with hard drives that contained Windows at some point in time, this is particularly important. </s>
<s> Windows likes to add files that can't be overwritten, even with a re-formatting of the drive. </s>
<s> It's best to download a utility from the hard drive manufacturer (Western Digital has a good one) that will write the disk to 0's. </s>
<s> Once you do that, there is no way that any data that was previously on there could possibly survive. </s>
<s> Before formatting first delete all the partitions, which is very strong, and then start building new partions or just one. </s>
<s> After formatting the new partions or partition you have a safe drive. </s>
<s> Don't bother about your polluted data. </s>
<s> In the future make sure that you don't get any virusses or what-ever. </s>
<s> And if you are still afraid just use Malware bytes. </s>
<s> It is a free program that deletes all your malware. </s>
<s> I would suggest Darik's Boot And Nuke this utility will completely erase the drive. </s>
<s> http://www.dban.org/ It is also available on The Ultimate Boot Cd, which has many great utilities, http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ . </s>
<s> There is an easier way: You can buy an adapterset which connects a bare drive via usb with the pc. </s>
<s> The adapter is equipped with a power supply, so you can use all kinds of drives. </s>
<s> It is also cheaper than a case. </s>
<s> Gerhard </s>
<s> Blessings, I tried what you suggested-reformatting the SATA drive. </s>
<s> After wiping, I went to restart and now it is asking for a password!! </s>
<s> I DIDN'T password protect this drive, so I don't know what is going on. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> How can I get past the request for password screen? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do I need another reformat? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Is there something else I can do to solve this problem? </s>
<s> Thanks, Deborah </s>
<s> I'll assume that you have retrieved any data you still wanted from these drives. </s>
<s> Given that there was malware on those drives, you want to ensure that any retrieved files are clean - use a virus protected system to check the copies. </s>
<s> Then, if you remove the partition(s) and repartition the drive all that's needed is a thorough full format. </s>
<s> Except: You may still have a boot sector virus on the drive. </s>
<s> And if you do you probably have the same virus on all drives on all systems that you have connected your old drives to. </s>
<s> So you do want to treat those old drives as suspect until you have checked them with a virus scanner. </s>
<s> Once they are reformatted the virus scanner will run much faster and the only possible place where it could still find a virus would be the boot sector area. </s>
<s> Yes, Kill Disk. </s>
<s> Google it and click on the CNet download for Active@ Killdisk. </s>
<s> It writes zeros across the drive, and leaves it perfectly clean. </s>
<s> Much better than reformatting which doesn't clean the drive. </s>
<s> There is ONLY one way to make sure the drive is clean and that is to Zero Fill it. </s>
<s> As we know, everything on computers comes down to 1's and zeros. </s>
<s> You can buy a disk at Staples that will convert everything to zeros. </s>
<s> I bought it from a company called iolo for $20; its called DriveScrubber. </s>
<s> Here's a cool thing in addition. </s>
<s> Since hard drives are metal and work on magnetism, there is always a chance that a tiny snippet of magnetism is left over, lets call it residual. </s>
<s> The same disk can write encryption over everything on the drive before putting zeros on it. </s>
<s> In fact, the department of defense standards is to write encryption 7 times over everything before zero-filling. </s>
<s> This disk can do that but one pass plus zeros is good enough. </s>
<s> Antivirus programs can only get rid of viruses they know to exist and there are always people out there making new ones that might not be known and pout into AV software definition lists. </s>
<s> For that reason you really cant rely on AV software. </s>
<s> Also, a lot of people will tell you that removing the partition on a disk will clean it, but actually it just makes it ready to add stuff on top of whats still there. </s>
<s> Zero-filling is the only real way to wipe a hard drive. </s>
<s> I suggest you read glenlo's post again. </s>
<s> It wasn't a question IMO but a very sarcastic commentary on Graham's post. </s>
<s> I stand by my original reply to glenlo. </s>
<s> It appears as of this writing that other astute members agree (12). </s>
<s> However, I realize there will always be those who disagree (3) as do you. </s>
<s> Open discourse is what this forum is about and sometimes requires one to read between the lines in order to fully grasp the true meaning of what is actually being communicated. </s>
<s> IF, I interpreted glenlo's remarks incorrectly...then my apologies. </s>
<s> I hope you continue to participate in this forum and I look forward to reading your comments/suggestions to Graham's and future questions posted in this forum. </s>
<s> Together Everyone Achieves More </s>
<s> If these drives are going to be used for storage and what's currently on there doesn't matter, then I highly recommend you just wipe 'em out. </s>
<s> Formatting is fine, usually, but there's always bits of info strewn about and they still might cause security concerns. </s>
<s> The best option is to just wipe 'em out using either freeware software like DBan or paid software such as Wipe Drive. </s>
<s> (I use Wipe Drive, actually. </s>
<s> I recommend spending the dough, it's worth it.) </s>
<s> It will wipe every sector of the hard drive, ever piece of data, every virus, all of it gone. </s>
<s> Replaces it with random, empty 0's and 1's. </s>
<s> When you put the drives back to use, they'll need to be formatted as the system will see them as brand new hard drives. </s>
<s> Like you had just pulled them out of the box. </s>
<s> It's time consuming, I won't lie, but it's worth it. </s>
<s> i agree, buy a new hard drive. </s>
<s> why backup from a 500 to a 120. the best way to wipe clean is lay it on the driveway and drive over it a number of times..... </s>
<s> If you are sure you did not protect the drive you can press Enter to get past it. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you'll want to download hirems boot recovery onto a flash drive. </s>
<s> If you are using a non admin account on Win7 then to reactivate a volume (drive) you need to login as admin or enter the admin password to register the device on the system if the drive is installed internally. </s>
<s> There should not be a password for a non encrypted drive. </s>
<s> If you did format the drive and then used file system encryption then you have a problem. </s>
<s> To break the encryption request a linux live CD or USB stick will do the trick. </s>
<s> It is also very handy for blanking drives. </s>
<s> If the drive is installed within the computer it will be listed in the partitioning program as sda if it is the primary drive and if it is the second drive it will show up as sdb. </s>
<s> Either way you will be able to see where you have your existing windows OS installed usually this will show up as drive sda but not always. </s>
<s> Just make certain you do not wipe your existing windows or just unplug the drive that you have it on and be certain you do not format anything other than the drive you want to nuke and/or reformat! </s>
<s> The partitioning program will unmount the drive, which in turn stops the ntfs file encryption request then you simply reformat to ntfs without drive encryption. </s>
<s> The encryption request is at the beginning of the drive so you need to blank to unformatted first (remove partition). </s>
<s> Make sure that the drive is then seen as nothing but free space. </s>
<s> Do not forget that if you use another file system other than ntfs or vfat your drive will not be seen as a file system under Windows. </s>
<s> If you did encrypt the drive then you must be using Vista win7 or XP pro, as drive encryption is not available with the &quot;home&quot; versions. </s>
<s> As to how to wipe a drive with linux it is a breeze with command line. </s>
<s> If you open a terminal window with a live cd or usb stick your installed primary drive will show up as sda. </s>
<s> The command to wipe the drive by overwriting is (without the quotes) &quot;dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/urandom&quot; If your live cd or usb stick mounted the drive automatically then you will need to simply unmount the drive and blank the drive without a mounted file system. </s>
<s> In linux (the same as most Unix and BSD systems and windows for that matter) drives are accessible as system devices even if you cannot read the file system on the drive because you have unmounted the file system. </s>
<s> Essentially all dd does with this command is write random numbers to all sectors of the drive including the boot sector so it will be completely blank of data. </s>
<s> It can take a long time if your drive is a big one but this is essentially what commercial drive wiping software does. </s>
<s> This causes huge amounts of confusion with users who do not understand the difference between the device and the file system on the device! </s>
<s> Think of it simply as a device and you will see what I am getting at, the file system is on the device and needs to be indexed on the running operating system as a file system that can be read. </s>
<s> However if you unmount...in linux the command umount, then the device can still be written to even though it cannot be read by the higher level of the os that reads file systems. </s>
<s> dd is a core program that writes to devices and does not care about file systems. </s>
<s> Windows does exactly the same thing but obscures how it actually does things and makes users find freeware to do things that only the &quot;pro&quot; versions do! </s>
<s> Without quotes the command to blank a drive is &quot;dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda&quot; If the drive you want to blank is sdb then substitute sdb for sda. </s>
<s> In the original post I reversed the syntax by mistake. </s>
<s> if (means the file or device you are writing from) &quot;if&quot; just stands for input file of (means the device or file that you are writing the input to) dead simple and really reliable like most great stuff. </s>
<s> I always use dd before I sell an old computer with a drive and no OS installed. </s>
<s> Silly as it sounds an old scsi drive that I once purchased at a used computer store actually had all of a dentists patient files on it unencrypted. </s>
<s> Fortunately I am not the type that snoops, but the so called Windows IT guy that sold off the computer parts should have known better! </s>
<s> Consider this: We lack perfection, systems fail UPS's run out of juice, generators run out of fuel.The cloud is no more secure than any properly designed self storage. </s>
<s> They are IDE drives not sata,my new machine is SATA and I didn't want to deal with it.. </s>
<s> I guess I've had good luck with the electronics of my machines, on the other hand most of my problems have been anti - mal-ware that didn't work as advertised. </s>
<s> One of the above drives was infested with mal-ware and my anti- virus soft ware didn't warn me. </s>
<s> At the time it seemed the easiest way to transfer the data form the other machine...Bad idea. </s>
<s> I wish I had check this site before following a suggestion. </s>
<s> A mistake. </s>
<s> Told to drag Icon of back up to trash. </s>
<s> Now I can get it back. </s>
<s> I was using a LaCie 599,11GB. </s>
<s> Now when I drag the HD to Restore from Utilities it moves to Source, but the LaCie will not move to Destination. </s>
<s> A new image &quot; Untitled&quot; appears. </s>
<s> It will move to Destination. </s>
<s> Restore to Untitled runs about a minute and no longer. </s>
<s> It quits. </s>
<s> I am tired of this flustration. </s>
<s> Where would I get a drive you referenced? </s>
<s> I have a iMac w/ OS 10.6.8 Processor 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and Memory 3GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM Clyde at frclyde@comcast.net </s>
<s> There has been a lot of talk and promotion of &quot;Clouds&quot; lately, I won't go into an explanation of what a &quot;Cloud&quot; is, because I'm assuming most of you are tech friendly... </s>
<s> However, &quot;Clouds&quot; depend on file storage and sharing on off-source servers... and, as we have seen lately in the news, there have already been several file-sharing services that have been &quot;shut down&quot; by either financial forces, or by government interference... Whatever you might have stored on these &quot;Cloud&quot; servers, including Aunty Gladys' picture will be gone... vapourised... as any cloud would be... eventually... Save your data to multiple drives... backup to dvds... cheap... and a lot more reliable... Sam </s>
<s> I agree with Willy. </s>
<s> There are some viruses that are able to exist even after a format. </s>
<s> You must use a wiping program to be sure. </s>
<s> It is another free download that will not fix or work unless you but the full system, and after you take it off it will take you off. </s>
<s> Another one of those,,tricks </s>
<s> Unfortunately to use cipher you need to have encryption installed on Windows which means the pro series only. </s>
<s> For those who do not have it the best answer is to unplug the drive that they do not want to format or blank, as it is really easy to nuke the wrong drive. </s>
<s> I have pulled this DOH! </s>
<s> Homer Simpson trick in the past years ago and nuked my OS by mistake...but that was with Windows 95 so it really wasn't a loss If they are formatting the drive that they have their os installed on then they will not be using windows unless they have a copy of windows. </s>
<s> Unfortunately most people who buy computers nowadays do not even get a real copy of windows with their pc! </s>
<s> So using freeware or drive manufactures isos is the easiest way to learn how to deal with drives correctly. </s>
<s> One other suggestion for those who have windows without Nero or whatever and might have a hard time correctly burning downloaded ISOs of Linux or the drive manufactures ISOs of freedos with their drive utilities. </s>
<s> My answer is to always use iso recorder which is a great freeware utility that does not create cd or dvd coasters the way that windows 7 does with iso files. </s>
<s> It works on XP, Vista and 7. </s>
<s> It gives you a right click menu to burn iso directly to disk and does not screw up if something else requests hdd disk write access the way the native windows 7 iso burning software does. </s>
<s> Before Windows 7 the ability to burn ISO to disk required add on software, after Windows 7 the feature was added but somehow it always seems to screw up Linux ISOs for some strange unknown reason.. </s>

<s> Sorry to be so unlearned in this matter, Dr. Deborah </s>
<s> I sent Webserf a request on 11-17-12 for clarification. </s>

<s> Can anyone guide me to the cheap drives. </s>
<s> This will be for backup. </s>
<s> My current 500.11 GB LaCie I have lost the icon by dragging icon to trash. </s>
<s> Any way to restore? </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> Graham P. didn't ask if he could buy new drives but how to safely reuse his old ones. </s>
<s> Supposing the drives are still in a good shape low formatting should do the job (of course no quick formatting). </s>
<s> As written he wants to reuse the disks for his own purpose so data safety should not be in question. </s>
<s> DBAN for IDE and non SE firmware SATA, SE firmware for SATA that supports it. </s>
<s> Or use the simple methods mentioned here that will get data stolen.. </s>
<s> Hirens is a hard disk diagnostics and recovery utility that allows you to bypass and reset forgotten or unknown passwords to be able to access the disk. </s>
<s> http://www.hirensbootcd.org </s>
<s> Formatting and possibly even anti-virus scans might not be enough. </s>
<s> If you have an MBR (master boot record) / bootkit / boot sector virus, the infection might still linger. </s>
<s> If you're concerned, you should repair or rebuild the MBR, or use a tool specifically to remove such viruses. </s>
<s> For options, just Google &quot;how to remove an MBR virus&quot;. </s>
<s> Oops, skipped a page. </s>
<s> I see this was already mentioned. </s>
<s> True, but the OP said that he wants to use the drives as external drives. </s>
<s> These low-cost adapters are great for quickie maintenance, but I don't think you'd want your bare drives exposed to &quot;the elements&quot; during ongoing use as an external drive. </s>
<s> Even if only used occasionally for backup, then storage; a drive dock might be a more convenient choice. </s>
<s> Blessings, This website is DREADFUL. </s>

<s> if you have an infected secondary hard drive, it will more than likely infect your primary hard drive during boot time, therefore most of the aforementioned methodologies will not be useful. </s>
