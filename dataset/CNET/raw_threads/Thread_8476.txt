Ive just bought a see thru case for my pc and need a cooler for my 2.7ghz celeron skt 478 cpu. I bought a coolermaster DP-102 but it doesnt fit both fans due to the layout of my mobo, have tried it with 1 fan and my cpu runs at 65-75 degrees c (is this too hot ?). I want to get this a lot cooler without using water cooling. The heatsink also has to be attractive as i've spent a lot of money buying a see thru case, uv lighting, see thru psu, uv reative cables etc. If you have any sugestions i would gratly appreciate this. Thanks Paul

It's now running at 42C. Dont know if it should be cooler than that or if that is ok. Heres a link to the arocool dp-102 website http://www.aerocool.us/p-cooler/dp-102/dp102.htm Thanks Ramarc for your help it was greatly appreciated Thanks Paul

You really got the check the specs or dimensions of the cpu HSF in order to be able to use it. Yeah, you're in the upper limit of the careful temp control. I suggest you get another one that &quot;fits&quot; the bill. Sorry, but you learn the hard way, get another HSF. Otherwise, you'll pay the price of a replacement cpu and that's not cheap. tada -----Willy
