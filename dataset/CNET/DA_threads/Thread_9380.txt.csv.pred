1.2.1	You have PC133 Ram , are you sure of that fact that you got the same .	St
1.2.2	If not , it wo n't work !	St
1.2.3	All you have to do is put the ram into the slot and start the computer up , where the backsreen will show that its checking ram and it should show the new amount , if not go into your System and Perfomance and it 'll show your current RAM installed and it should read the amount .	St
1.2.4	If not , then you must 've done something wrong , or wrong ram that is not supported .	St
