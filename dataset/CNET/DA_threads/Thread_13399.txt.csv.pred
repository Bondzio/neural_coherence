1.1.2	I have a 2Ghz celeron, XP, and an audigy sound card... now for some reason, its making a popping sound whenever i try to play a CD or a DVD, yet a mere 3 weeks ago, when i installed the card, it was playing back perfectly fine.	St
1.1.3	all other sound is fine, it only 'pops' when i have a CD/DVD in the drive, so i know theres nothing wrong with the speakers.	St
