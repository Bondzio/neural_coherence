It was still MIDI and not a joystick interface. So that is likely where you only need the MIDI card and cable to get it connected. The joystick port is only there to confuse us. Bob

MIDI signals were &quot;stuck&quot; or &quot;added&quot; to game ports because it would be costly to put the then standard MIDI port onto the sound cards of the day. As such there is never a need to think of this as a game port as a true game port would never have MIDI signals on it. Creative Labs used what we called a &quot;15-pin MIDI/Joystick multiport,&quot; Those adapters simply had the connections and connectors required to connect the MIDI signals. Now back to your Keyboard with MIDI out. Interesting unit so you can't send it MIDI commands. Most folk want the keyboard to play MIDI and now just send it. Maybe this is something to consider? Bob

I attempted to explain the history where Creative Labs add the MIDI signals to the 15 pin Game Multi port yet you ask for a game port to MIDI converter. Since a game port has no signals we can use to talk MIDI, a converter is not possible. Please add a MIDI port or if your game port has MIDI (remember Multi port?) then get the cable you need. ==&gt;&gt; Remember that I can't recommend any card or cable because I can't find what machines and MIDI keyboards are in play.

That COMPUTER connection was so it could be controlled by same and the MIDI out was not only for output from the keyboard but to control down stream instruments. I'm sorry but I thought you were a MIDI aficionado and only was in need of getting your gear up and running again after a change of machines. After all this I'm beginning to thing this is your first MIDI setup. Bob PS. The picture helps but when we get right down to it, make, model, age, manuals, etc.
