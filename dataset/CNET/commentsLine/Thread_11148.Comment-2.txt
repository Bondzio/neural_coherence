hard drive 1 tb size: 1 tb interface: sata transfer rating: 3.0 gb/sec rotational speed: 7200 rpm \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ those are your specs above.
they are for a sata type drive.
you can install a 2-2tb no problem, even a 3tb one if you like as your os is win7, will readily accept it.
the hd link appears not to be an issue, will work.
however, i do suggest you update the bios so it can accept any changes that hp provides or deems so.
hp if you follow the instructions should provide info on os re-install and hd replacement, please review it for model# or generic details.
