also keep in mind if you're using an external harddrive to backup your files (drive image photos etc) that if it's powered all the time and connected to your pc, it's no longer a backup device and is subject to fail at the most inopportune time.

to recover the data after the usb interface failed.
always store your critical data in multiple separate locations.
