any decent b&w laser ptr.
will do, but then you mentioned &quot;duplex&quot; and that's a curve ball.
because of that you get into expensive options.
i suggest you look at okidata lasers as they're robust and darn near perfect, just find one with duplex.
if possible and in your area, check local office & computer shops to sample or hands-on testing.
i'm sure you'll find hp, canon, samsung, & brother etc.
available, don't settle too much on cost alone as the duplex option really can befuddle any printer.
remember, if you plan to use real punishing demands, $ spend up front helps in the long run.
some b&w lasers are so cheap w/o duplex, you can use that under those conditions when duplex isn't needed then shop for the duplex model and use some switching port/network to dump that output.
