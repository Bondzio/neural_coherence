<s> I am seeking an external hard drive to serve as the backup medium for all of the PCs in my home. </s>
<s> Preferences are at least 500 GB of space, capable of backing up a PC hard drive as a disk image, ease of use software (simple enough for my wife and daughter to use), and incremental (daily) backup option . </s>
<s> Any suggested drives, or any to avoid? </s>
<s> I'm considering Iomega Pro, Transcend Store Jet Mobile, Seagate FreeAgent Go Flex. </s>
<s> Also would appreciate suggestions for online storage sites with no frills, easy to use, free or low cost. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> All a hard drive does: it stores data. </s>
<s> So all hard drives are the same, seen from that point of view. </s>
<s> Moreover, you should avoid all maker specific backup software, because of possible incompatibility with anothe drive, another PC, recovery software and what's more. </s>
<s> Go for well-known drive-maker-independent software. </s>
<s> So any basic 1 TB USB2 drive would be perfect, hardwarewise. </s>
