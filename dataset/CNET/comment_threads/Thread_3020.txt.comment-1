I have a wired home network between 2 desktops using NetGear router.
Replaced the client desktop with new.
Now I continue to get this &quot;unplugged&quot; message and have done absolutely everything I can think of to make this work.
I have no internet on new computer while the host computer is fine.
Yes, I have checked the connections and everything is hooked up properly.
The connection wizard does not help.
