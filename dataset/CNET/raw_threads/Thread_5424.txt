I have already scanned the drive for viruses and found one named MS-DOS.com, a win32/Tanatos.M type of virus. I tried displaying the hidden folders using the &quot;show hidden files and folders&quot; in the folder options but it didn't work. I backed up my files and tried reformatting my flash disk but the files could not be deleted from the drive. I could still access the said folders when i type it in the search box. when I right click inside the folder to see the folder properties, only the &quot;Read-me&quot; & &quot;Archive&quot; option is enabled, the hidden option is disabled.
