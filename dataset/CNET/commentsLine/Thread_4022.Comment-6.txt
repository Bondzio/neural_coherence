bob, you keep referring to the dell docs, i'm not sure how to access these or where they are??
i tried using the &quot;help and support&quot; trouble shooter that came with windows it didn't seem to help.
i did noticed that the bios ide port was enabled.
i'm not to sure how to set the boot config though.
i tried setting the jumpers a few different ways, cable select & slave, not master.
it seemed to recognize the hd when it was set to cs but not the cd rom.
i went into the device manager and saw the new hd there.
i clicked properties, it said it was working properly but i couldn't access it.
then it started acting funny after i rebooted.
windows wouldn't boot correctly it seemed to hang up..
