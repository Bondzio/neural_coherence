All, Thanks much for your help, after reading ALL the problems with XP & SATA drives, I just loaded Vista and all went fine.
I will work on a way to load XP as well, but for now it is up and running.
Hard to believe MS doesn't have an easy fix, especialy when floppy drives are a thing of the past.
Thanks Again.
Tom
