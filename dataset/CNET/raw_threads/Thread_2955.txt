A missing or defective video card will do such as will defective memory. If you have more than one memory module, you can insert them one at a time into the first slot (usually slot &quot;0&quot;) and see if you can make it work. Another common one I have seen with AGP video cards is they are not quite seated properly even though they seem to be. Check this closely. As for the key lock, these are sort of outdated but were used to disable the keyboard...sort of a cheap and ineffective security device. Hope this helps.

A jumper would just lock it again so leave it disconnected. If the RAM has been removed and not properly reinstalled, you will get beeps, especially if in slot &quot;0&quot;. I recall something about the first 64k as being mandatory. There is no beep code standard for MB manufacturers so, if you can, I would check for a support site for yours. Most likely the BIOS chips are from AMI or Pheonix.

I guess the motto is...dont get frustrated..step away for a while..oh and that just because they fit the slot ...dosent mean there RIGHT.
