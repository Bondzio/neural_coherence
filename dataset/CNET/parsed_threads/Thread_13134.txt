<s> I got an emachine t6522 with a TSSTcorp cd/dvdw TS-H552B. </s>
<s> and i can make DVDs all day long but i tried to burn some stuff to a cd and it didnt even recognize the cd. </s>
<s> I checked the box that enabled cd burning and it still would not coppy...i even tried to update drivers but there were no new drivers. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> ohh i ran Nero Tool Info and it said ASPI files are missing.does that have anything to do with it? </s>
<s> (WNASPI32.DLL) n/a and (WINSAPi.DLL n/a I thought of the ASPI files because i did the trouble shoot thing and it said somthing about them. </s>
<s> On the nero tool thing it has a drop box that has system ASPI, and Nero ASPI. </s>
<s> I am missing system ASPI, but it says nero ASPI is installed and working properly Nero ASPI = (wnaspi32.dll version 2.0.1.74) </s>
<s> http://ww2.nero.com/nero6/eng/WNASPI32.DLL.html </s>
<s> i downloaded it and its a file my computer does not recognize and it askes me what program to open it in. </s>
<s> I looked at the link you sent for the download and it said to put it in the nero folder...what one do i put it in? </s>
<s> i reinstalled nero 7 and still not working. </s>
<s> should i uninstall my cd/dvd rw drivers? </s>
<s> if so do i just click uninstall and when i restart my computer they will install themselves? </s>
<s> This is really annoying. </s>
<s> is it possible since i installed nero 7 ultra, that it cause a messup in my burner? </s>
<s> Copy and paste the file to: My Computer/Local Disk (C:)/ Programs Files/Ahead/Nero </s>
<s> i got it working...some how i was missing the ASPI files. </s>
<s> but i downloaded them and all is well. </s>
<s> thanx for your help. </s>
<s> I have the 6522 with the same dvd burner Ts H552B. </s>
<s> I have been having troubles, at odd times, burning to dvd discs. </s>
<s> I read your posts about the ansi files, and I also get the report &quot;ansi files are missing&quot;. </s>
<s> How did you get the replacements, and did it help? </s>
<s> I also had problem burning to cd's, but the issue was resolved by clicking the check box to allow burning to cd's. </s>
<s> Like I said, my burning problems are hit and miss, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't. </s>
<s> Can't burn a mpeg in media center, for instance. </s>
<s> Oh, I thought it was a Samsung burner and installed a Samsung automatic upgrade program, but it reported my burner an &quot;odd&quot; configuation and said it wasn't supported. </s>
<s> No new firmware for this particular model is available. </s>
<s> Our version number is G04 and firmware update from Samsung is TS06. </s>
<s> I don't know anything about firmware and such. </s>
<s> I just suspect the 6522 has a &quot;generic&quot; version of the Samsung burner and don't think it is supported. </s>
<s> There is a file at the adobe site that you have to download. </s>
<s> I can not remember at the momemnt what it is because I am not at my home computer. </s>
<s> I will look monday and see exactly what it is. </s>
<s> It is really easy to fix. </s>
<s> K this is my conversation with tech support Ava_EMC0142 says: When Adobe Audition is configured to use ASPI (Advanced SCSI Programming Interface), it uses ASPI drivers and DLL files to communicate with the CD drive. </s>
<s> If the ASPI driver is outdated, isn't installed correctly, or is damaged, Adobe Audition returns an error when you try to rip CD audio&lt;br&gt; clay smith says: ok clay smith says: is there a way i can fix this? </s>
<s> Ava_EMC0142 says: Try to Install the Adobe Audition ASPI Driver Patch. </s>
<s> &lt;br&gt;Download and install the Adobe Audition ASPI Driver Patch available from the Adobe website at www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=2517 . </s>
<s> Be sure to follow the installation instructions as provided. </s>
<s> &lt;br&gt; Just go to (www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=2517) and download the the aspi thing and install it. </s>
<s> If you have nero it says to reinstall it too. </s>
<s> I did a search on my puter and found no Adobe Audition. </s>
<s> Only &quot;Adobe&quot; a search comes up with is Adobe Acrobat. </s>
<s> I assume that is the program you use to create DVD's? </s>
<s> My 6522 came with Cyberlink Power DVD to perform that function. </s>
<s> So I guess going to Adobe would be fruitless for me. </s>
<s> Thanks for trying though. </s>
