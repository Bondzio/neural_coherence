<s> This is my second post on the same issue,because my first one was incomplete,. </s>
<s> My issue is that writing strucks on 1% (only when writing DVD's). </s>
<s> No issues while writing CD's. </s>
<s> Some times writing is normal when writing RW DVD's. </s>
<s> Writer is Samsung Slim External DVD writer. </s>
<s> The product is under warranty and got replaced once. </s>
<s> It is only 4 months old. </s>
<s> Second time they refuesed to replace the writer as it is not showing any isssues in other computers. </s>
<s> I reinstalled Windows and Nero. </s>
<s> I almost tried all versions of Nero. </s>
<s> Still got the same error shown below. </s>
<s> Alcohol and Daemon Tools where previously installed, but I uninstalled it now and still getting same error. </s>
<s> No issues with the USB port, other devices are working fine in the same port. </s>
<s> I bought this writer because my laps internal writer got damaged which is of same make.I updated the writers firmware to the latest.....Please help....... OS Name </s>
<s> I hate to write this but I agree it's unlikely to be a defect in this external. </s>
<s> You wrote it worked on other machines but look at Alcohol and Daemon Tools. </s>
<s> You've installed some titles that install CD/DVD emulations and could interfere. </s>
<s> Given the story of the fresh install I wonder why we would need Alcohol and Daemon Tools and not stick with CD/DVD burning software? </s>
<s> It's something with the machine and install but all I see is the usual titles I've removed too often. </s>
