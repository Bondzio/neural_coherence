when we finally added wireless to our wired home business network (3-4 computers), i tried linksys, then dlink, and finally netgear before settling on netgear's 108 mpbs router (which has plunged in price).
i had been using linksys' wireed routers, but hadn't been terribly happy with them since they would consistently fail after 2 years of use.
linksys tech support was a disaster -- it had moved to the philipines and cultural and language differences were turning 5 minute tech support calls into hour-long affairs.
plus linksys sometimes posted old firmware updates as new!
linksys' wireless router was a nightmare to try to set up.
i tried dlink's just wouldn't work right and tech support was pretty much worthless.
but netgear's wgt624 wireless firewall router worked incredibly well right out of the box.
administering it has been a breeze.
it has been a pure joy to use.
and i do find the higher speed worthwhile, but then again we move some pretty large files (100+ mb) between computers.
i don't know how good netgear's tech support is, because i've never had to call it.
we use netgear wireless network adapters for a computer on another floor and on our laptop without difficulty.
one other advantage of the 108mbps is that the wireless network's range is much greater than with 54mbps.
it now reaches into parts of the house that the other brand's 54 mbps could not reach.
