<s> So a few months ago I upgraded my RAM to 3GB, my power supply to 600w, and put in a Diamond Viper Radeon X1950 Pro (PCI-e, 512MB) card. </s>
<s> My problem is that there are games that I would like to buy...(ie: Gears of War, Crysis, BioShock etc...) however the box requirements list graphics cards for NVIDIA GeForce etc...and that's not what I have... so does anyone know what NVIDIA cards are = to what I have? </s>
<s> Mine does support Direct X 9.0 and I think even 10.... </s>
<s> There is no issue here. </s>
<s> But it's not a Geforce... </s>
<s> I've wanted to play Gears & Bioshock since I saw it on the X-box... but I play PS3... </s>
<s> I figured it would come out on the PC eventually.... now if I can get my controller to work with it. </s>
<s> I assuming that World Conflict will also be ok then... </s>
<s> Your card is a radeon from ATI. </s>
<s> your card supports DX9 only. </s>
