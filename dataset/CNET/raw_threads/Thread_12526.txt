I saw some product by Albatross that allowed AGP cards to be used on a PCI-E Port, I was wondering how it's performance was. I'm looking into a AGP card for my current system, but I'm reluctant because I know it might be useless in a couple of years with PCI-E as the standard.

According to article http://forums.techpowerup.com/archive/index.php/t-2074.html ''The PT880 Pro chipset is world s only chipset to feature a true AGP graphics controller in combination with PCI Express graphics, ensuring all graphics cards can reach their full performance potential. Furthermore, users can also benefit form VIA DualGFX technology by using both AGP and PCI Express graphics cards at the same time, providing enhanced multi-display support through the ability to connect up to 4 displays.
