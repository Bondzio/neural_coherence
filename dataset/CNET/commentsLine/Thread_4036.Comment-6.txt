in the original post i specified that it was the compaq ij1200 printer running on win2000 pro.
i also said that the printer worked fine (with the same drivers) when winme was installed on the same computer a little while back.
i reinstalled the driver, everything is set to default, paper size and margins are also ok. the weird thing is that the test page prints fine.
if something was wrong in the settings, wouldn't the test page be printed incorrectly as well?
maybe i've missed something.
i just thought that maybe if someone here came across this problem in the past, they'd have an answer.
i don't know what else to tell you.
