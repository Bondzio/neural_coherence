15138	0	7926	92505	NR	rdoherty	1/8/04 7:57 PM	1.07359182E12	802.11b Troubleshooting	I have a linksys WAP11 in my home. My connection drops after a few minutes of usage regardless of how close I am to the WAP. This happens using a variety of wireless network adaptors, so I know it is not the client. I have also tried replacing the WAP to no avail. How do you troublehsoot something like this? I live in a very vertical brick house in an urban environment. I have a 2.4 Ghz phone system, and also a wireless Lutron lighting system in the house. Any help or pointers to resources would be appreciated.
