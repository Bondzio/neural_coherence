1.1.1	I'm looking at purchasing a Dell OptiPlex 160L with: Microsoft window xp pro intel Pent.	St
1.1.2	4 processor at 2.40 GHz 128mb shared ddr sdram 40 gb hard drive integrated intel extreme graphics 17&quot; monitor 48x cd-rom at $599 I've heard bad reviews for tech support.	St
1.1.3	Any comments/suggestions?	St
1.2.1	The unit is your typical machine with not much to note.	St
1.2.2	The bad tech support is largely an issue swirling about how to handle customers that want their machines fixed without wiping out what's on the hard disk.	St
1.2.3	This is tough to do no matter what make or model.	St
1.2.4	There's also the issue that once you load Sam's Crapepaper Deluxe Printing System, then you have changed it in some way they may have never seen.	St
1.2.5	Some can't understand that not everything works.	St
1.2.6	You'll get the same support results for most big makers...	St
1.3.1	Did you notice for that particular computer it only cost $29 to upgrade from a 40GB hard drive to 80GB.	St
1.3.2	Check the Dell configuration page for that PC.	St
1.3.3	Also seems to be $20 cheaper for what you have listed for components.	St
1.3.4	Dell is no worst than any other factory on service.	St
1.3.5	Last time I checked in PC Mag, it was rated slightly better than the rest.	St
1.4.1	Just a suggestion....	St
1.4.2	Assume you are getting the Pent4 2.40 GHz with the 533FSB and 512k cache rather than the Pent4 2.40 GHz with the 400FSB and 128k cache.	St
1.4.3	WinXP runs much better & loves at least 256MB of RAM especially with the power of the above Pent4.	St
1.4.4	It only cost $49 additional to upgrade to 256MB with Dell.	St
1.4.5	You could get a stick cheaper & install yourself but it may null the warranty..check w/Dell.	Sug
1.4.6	I come up with $578.	St
1.4.7	Add $29 for 80GB HD and $49 for 256MB RAM = $656 Also note a floppy drive cost $19 more.	St
1.4.8	BTW the free 17&quot; monitor deal expires 02-18-04. http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=us&cs=04&kc=6W300&l=en&oc=160lmin&s=bsd If you plan on doing some heavy gaming with high tech games to come, then check if that model has a AGP slot on the MB to install better graphics.	St
1.4.9	Integrated Intel graphics are limited on what games can be played.	St
