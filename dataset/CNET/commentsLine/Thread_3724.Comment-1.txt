i noticed two ip addresses reserved with dchp on my home wireless.
from ip addresses i can't seem to figure out who these belong to at home.
all connected computers and devices are accounted for.
could these possibly be someone(s) hacking to my wireless to connect to internet?
or are these for modem setup, etc.?
can anyone help please.
i don't want to block them w/o knowing if they are legitimate or not.
thx.
