in short, my now dated 2.0 ghz p4 with a motherboard from last year can boot from other drives by tapping a f-key at the right time.
while your post was rather long, it omitted a key piece of information.
the make/model of the system or motherboard.
but you can look up if they offered a new bios.
as to booting another os, today's linux distributions can be entirely on cd (go find knoppix) which are great at repairing or backing up files from a system without altering said system.
as to windows 95 on drive g:, as far as i know, that os is hard coded to drive c:.
maybe you can fix that.
