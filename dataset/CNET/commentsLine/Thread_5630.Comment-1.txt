i took a glance at my old motherboard, and i noticed that it has some ddr ram in it.
the pink sticker (this was a built computer, so the various parts have pink stickers labeling them) says it's pc266 32x64 256mb ddr ram.
i was wondering... could i possibly use this in conjunction with my pc3200 512mb ddr ram?
i checked out the slot with the 256 stick, and it'd fit in there if i put it in, but i don't know if it's compatible with the motherboard, or maybe with the other ram.
two other things about the 512 stick - it's kingston, and it's 184 pin (the 256 probably is 184, too, because it fits).
my new motherboard is an asus k8n motherboard, amd processor, etc.
more info needed, please ask.
thanks, -christopher
