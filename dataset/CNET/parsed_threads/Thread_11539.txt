<s> I did some Internet &quot;window&quot; shopping yesterday and came up with FOUR PC's that seem ready for Vista right out of the Box.. Two were GAMING PC's.. and Two were not.. ...................................................................... #1...DELL at $$5400.00/XPS 710 H2C .. #2...DELL at $$1900.00/XPS 710....these both would use Duo Core and DDR2 RAM Modules at 667MHz../ .. #3...DELL at $$700.00/Dimension 9200..I would pass on the Pentium D and also get a Duo Core Processor..that PC might run $$1200.00 .. #4...HP at $$900.00/Pavilion Media Center m7790y series.. ...................................................................... </s>
<s> If you get a 160-GB HDD..from my understanding it must be Partitioned to RUN WINDOWS..WINDOWS does not operate over 120-GB's.. </s>
<s> So I would just get a 80-GB HDD..because External HDD are a real Positive in running a Desktop..for Archiveing your FILES/FOLDERS..I use 4-External HDD.. ...................................................................... </s>
<s> I have two PC's useing a 30-GB System Drive and a 80-GB System Drive.. both are Western Digital HD's.. ...................................................................... For Video Games....I would switch to the XBox or SONY PS3...Nintendo...what-ever..Video Games are rough on the PC Hardware in my opinion.. ...............[end] </s>
<s> Your configuration is fine. </s>
<s> Something like it shouldn't cost more than $400+tax but HP brand may cost more. </s>
<s> Compaqs could be slightly cheaper. </s>
<s> &quot;WINDOWS does not operate over 120-GB's&quot; That is not true. </s>
