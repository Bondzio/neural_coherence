i bought a brother dcp-j125 (their current bottom-of-the-line inkjet multifunction printer) on sale from my local pamida for $49.95 (and immediately stocked up on compatible ink cartridges (15 for $22) from ebay).
the color printouts are certainly attractive, and the included bookscan enhancer software will streamline a lot of the product-image scanning i do for my ebay auctions.
however: 1) i thought access to my day job's fax machine would be sufficient -- until a problem came up over the weekend, which i could have dealt with a lot faster, had i had a home fax of some kind.
2) the paper cassette on the brother only holds 100 sheets, whereas i'm used to 250-sheet paper trays on laser printers i've used.
(a minor inconvenience, having to refill paper more frequently, but it's there nonetheless.)
3) i don't like the included paperport software (too complex for convenient editing of ebay product-image scans).
i tried upgrading arcsoft photoimpression 5 (which came with my old epson scanner) to version 6.5, but decided i really prefer the old version (which, when patched, works fine with windows 7).
i now plan to buy a used standalone copy of photoimpression 5, so i'll still have a program disc for it, even if i sell the old scanner.
4) i thought that the scanning glass would be about the same size on my old epson scanner & the new brother dcp-j125 (i had measured the epson's glass before buying the brother); however, the scannable area of the brother seems to be slightly smaller.
i now wish i had held out for an mfp with at least a legal-size flatbed scanner -- even if that would have meant springing for a larger printer cart as well.
i will still &quot;make do&quot; with the dcp-j125 for now, but may well start saving up for an even nicer mfp down the road.
