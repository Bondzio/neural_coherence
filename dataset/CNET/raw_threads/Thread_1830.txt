If you don't believe me, just do a double-bind test. Kees

There is so little payoff that I never suggest such. However if you sell such or make them you would call them indispensable. Bob

If surround or 5.1 is what you want, onboard won't go beyond surround and that takes some config changes to work right and utilize a line in jack as a surround channel output. A good little powered speakers setup with a built in subwoofer can replace headphones, the little units mounted to or built into a chair with the SW bolted to a wooden chair frame can really put you in the middle of the action.
