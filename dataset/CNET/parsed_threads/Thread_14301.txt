<s> I recently purchased a new computer and very happy with it, with one small exception: it doesn't have HDMI output. </s>
<s> Would like to stream movies, TV shows and etc and display them on my HDTV. </s>
<s> Is there a relatively inexpensive way to get HDMI output on my PC? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help. </s>

<s> If so you may find playing &quot;protected&quot; content quite the hoot. </s>
<s> But the cheap way is a video card with a HDMI output. </s>

<s> Any models of video cards you think I should consider? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I shop at Newegg.com for such. </s>
