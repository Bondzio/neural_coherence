those devices need attention.
if those devices are unknown to you, don't worry, just hit the &quot;update&quot; button to find the best drivers when you click on that device.
if none are found, then find them either on your system recovery/restore cds or mtrbd.
cd and point to them as the new source to check.
-or- load the required cd and match the device to driver and allow it to load.
if all fails, thn simply remove or delete the device in question, upon next boot-up it should retry again to find proper drivers, then point to the known cds that have such drivers.
you can provide the drivers from the vendors support website for that device and d/l them and then extract such drivers and then use that source to load them.
did all this happen on thier own or did you installed &quot;new&quot; h/w, etc?
you may want to try this forst before anything else.
use the &quot;restore&quot; feature of winxp or winme to a date where problems weren't present.
