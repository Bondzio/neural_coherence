You can save money on certain barebone kits, if you can find what you need. Just beware of the rebate offers. Don't pay more than an item is worth and expect to get a mail-in-rebate. Some companies simply lie to you and do not honor the rebates. (Soyo & Lexmark to name a couple) Tell how you intend to use the machine and others can advise as to which is best for your needs.
