1.3.1	well I know for sure its the hard drive because Dell told me to reinstall windows three times , and i did three times starting from a complete hard drive erase .	St

1.3.3	Basically ... i 'm pretty sure my hard drive is screwed up .	St

1.3.5	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html ? forumID=26 & threadID=148089	Ques
1.4.1	The ram you chose should be fine , but you should check and see if your motherboard has any specific incompatibities with that specific module .	Sug
1.4.2	You should have no problems , but companies tend to be kinda harsh when you return things that you ordered , just because it was n't compatible with your system .	St
1.4.3	In answer to your questions : 1 .	St
1.4.4	The install of your hard drive will be simple physically , and should n't be difficult , if you have the proper SATA drivers .	St
1.4.5	The only problem I can see is if your comp .	St
1.4.6	does n't have any SATA ports on the motherboard .	St
1.4.7	If thats the case , then you will need a controller card like this one : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16815123015 You will also need to purchase a SATA cable , if you do n't already have one .	St
1.4.8	You can find them on newegg for just a couple of dollars .	St
1.4.9	2 .	St
1.4.10	About the green things ?	Ques
1.4.11	Those are what hold your drives in place .	Ques
1.4.12	When you install your new HD , you will need to attach them to the sides of the drive and slide the whole assembly into the drive cage ( it makes for an almost tooless install , something Dell has been doing for quite some time ) 3 .	St
1.4.13	To remove your old one , simply do the opposite of what you did with the new one .	St
1.4.14	However , you may want to keep that one around , just in case your computer does n't want to boot from a SATA disk , in which case it would be a strange install indeed , but one that was somewhat worth it if you are n't intending on making further upgrades to this computer .	St
1.4.15	And one final thought : do n't buy anything like this on ebay .	St
1.4.16	Like someone mentioned before , its not worth the time , especially when you are buying everything else from newegg .	St
1.4.17	Not to mention it will get to you in about 4 business days , be insured , have a warranty , and will be backed by a real customer service department .	St
1.5.1	read another post in this thread where a man talks about loud clicking noises !	St
