I have a BlasterPC I bought a couple of years ago from TigerDirect.
Advertised as being manufactured by Creative labs, the mb has built-in soundblaster live 5.1.
Creative says they provided the components for this kit but do not support it.
Tigerdirect says that they no longer have records for the manufacturers of the components other than Creative.
I would like to upgrade the Award Modular Bios version 4.51 PGM so that the system will read and use the full 1gb of ram I have installed, as well as read the entire 40gb of the maxtor hdd I have installed, rather than only 31gb; as well as take advantage of any other enhancements offered by an updated Bios.
I would hope to find something that can be flashed via boot disk or whatever.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Following are the specs for my system per the Guillemot Hardware Inspector program.
