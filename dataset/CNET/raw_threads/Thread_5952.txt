Never had any problems, then the other day couldn't access internet. I don't know if someone screwed around with the computer or if there is an Explorer corrupt file but the problem has been troubleshooted to this: - using winipcfg, the IP address is a # which it shouldn't be and I don't know how to change it. It should be something like 192.168.0.4 but its not. I am home now and don't have the actual address. I tried releasing the address but when I press the button nothing happens. I have no idea how the IP address changed but because of this, there is no communication with the router and thus no internet. Some things I tried besides releasing the IP address are checking all settings in Network control panel. They are as they should be. I went to the routers address (192.168.0.1) and checked on attached devices. This computer is no longer listed of course. I pressed &quot;refresh&quot; but it still didn't show up. I rebooted the router to no avail. I need to determine why the computer IP address is locked and how to change it again. any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Provider sent me a new modem, but I unlocked it by going into my providers supplied software and loading a prior configuration. However once I did this I lost my CD drives and am now at a point where my system will not boot. Outside of my computer not booting, which could have been done by me, I was not able to access the internet from my PC. I could access the internet wirelessly. I am trying to recover and will repost if I get past my inability to boot the system. Best of luck. John

Download and install the latest network adapter driver for your OS. 3. Scan for spyware and viruses. Does the router assign IP addresses (DHCP is on) or do manually assign an IP address to each computer (static IP addresses)?
