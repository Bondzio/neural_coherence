A couple of questions: 1) As a second owner, can I still buy AC for this macbook pro? 2) Owner has installed an extra 2 gigs of RAM himself - does this void the warranty or a potential AC warranty? 3) Does the 3 year coverage start when I buy AC or when the macbook was originally purchased? Condition of macbook is otherwise good except for normal wear and tear and scratches. Thanks for the help.

Proffitt	3/21/08 11:12 AM	1.20609792E12	This is more a question about	Aversion to risk or will you be upset if the costs are what they are outside of AC and will you use the support provided by AC? As to the warranty of the added RAM you quickly learn to not tell them that if you want the warranty and to swap the old chips back in prior to warranty service. Items 1 and 3 need to be answered by Apple since they decide that. Bob

RAM is a user replaceable part. Does not normally impact the warranty. 3. 3 year coverage starts from the date of original purchase. Terms and Conditions for AppleCare can be found Here P
