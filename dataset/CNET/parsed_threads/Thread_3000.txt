<s> I bought a new cheap X-Link Internal 56K Modem. </s>
<s> I put it in the PCI slot, I adjusted the volume to the max, then dialed. </s>
<s> But whalla, no sound. </s>
<s> I figured out that the new modem has no speaker compare to my old one. </s>
<s> I just want to know if there are any way to hear the sound of dialing by using my own PC Speaker (since the modem don't have speaker, so I think using the PC Speaker is possible). </s>
<s> If it's possible kindly tell me how to do it. </s>
<s> I know this is possible because there are some computers that I know that when it dials, the sound comes through the PC Speaker itself. </s>
<s> It's also possible to cut costs, there is no speaker. </s>
<s> Since there are some zillion modems out there, unless I could see the modem or a web site with details about the modem, there is no hope to connect some sound from the modem to your sound card with some cable. </s>

<s> I think you answered you're own question, &quot;a new cheap X-Link Internal 56K Modem&quot;. </s>
<s> If it has no speaker then the drivers or the vendors s/w has to route any sound output to the system. </s>
<s> The AT cmds. </s>
<s> apply to the physical modem and usually not to the system. </s>
<s> You need to find some s/w from some 3rd party(I don't know of any) if any as an solution. </s>
<s> But since this is new, return to the vendor and get a different one w/speaker. </s>
<s> If you haven't already, check the x-link support website for hints/tips in that regard. </s>
<s> To be honest, I never heard of x-link brand, but then many a vendor comes along &quot;rebranding&quot; a popular chipset and sell as thier own. </s>
<s> That maybe a hint in following the chipset and see if a cure if available. </s>
