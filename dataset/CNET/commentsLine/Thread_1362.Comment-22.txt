as i type my reply, i can look to my left and see my old dell xps d300.
i bought it november 1997. it has been on almost constantly since then.
i came with a western digital 4 gb scsi drive and i added a 9 gb drive shortly there after.
these are 7200 rpm drives which was the state of the art then.
i have my power options set to never turn off the hard disks i run all my pc stock, and i have have no problems.
