the message limited or no connectivity, did you try clicking on the message.
then click on the repair button.
be paitent, it may give you another error message but if you wait a minute longer, it might connect.
if it does, then type command ipconfig /flushdns then hit enter then close the window.
before you shut down the computer, disable the radio.
i found that when the radio is not disabled, i got that error message often.
hope this helps.
