1.1.1	I use Motorola vt1005 , befsr41 on cable modem and Vonage service .	St
1.1.2	currently I hook up as follows : Cable Modem - Befsr41 ( with 2 pcs ) and- vt1005 Problem is that the connection ( Voice ) broken up when in use while browsing ( no problem when no browsing ) Then I tried to configure port forwarding and port triggering on my BEFSR41 ( as suggested many article ) the ports that I forwarded : 5060-5063 -- - UDP - to vt1005 IP 69 -- -- -- -- -- UDP - to vt1005 IP 123 -- -- -- -- - UDP - to vt1005 IP 10000-20000 - UDP - to vt1005 IP Port Triggering : triggered port Forwarded Start End Start End 5060 5063 5060 5063 69 69 69 69 123 123 123 123 10000 20000 10000 20000 ( I wonder if that how I supposed to do it ) -- - the problem remains.. -- - BEFSR41 - dhcp/nat enable , upnp disable .	St
1.1.3	vt1005 - dhcp/nat enable ( I put a static IP manualy - port forwarding/triggering need ) Note : I do n't want to place the vt1005 , in front of the router , due to security on open port ( vt1005 is known as bad router ) and avoiding ping attack , etc .	St
1.1.4	Are there any other thing I should/could do to eliminate the broken voice while browsing ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thank you for any help .	St
1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? q=Vonage+behind+a+router & start=0 & start=0 & ie=utf-8 & oe=utf-8 & client=mozilla & rls=org.mozilla : en-US : unofficial Seems to be well discussed .	St
1.3.1	many of those link are the source articles for configuring my devices and end up like what I wrote on the first post .	St
1.3.2	I hope I can find some other working idea here ... One thing I did n't try is enabling upnp service on befsr41 ... is there a security issue for enabling upnp ?	Ques
1.3.3	Thank you again	St
1.4.1	There was an issue long ago .	St
1.4.2	Today it can be debated if there is or not .	St
1.4.3	I wo n't enter into that debate but will share I do have it enabled and need it for a device I own .	St
1.4.4	I also see I can refine the google search to add the word PORT NUMBER or PORTS and see people talking about port numbers .	St
1.4.5	I purposely did not look at the maker 's web site for documentation .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
