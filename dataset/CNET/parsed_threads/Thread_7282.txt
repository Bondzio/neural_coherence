<s> I recently purchased a 1 gig stick of PQI Turbo low latency ddr400 ram, part number PQI3200-1024SBL. </s>
<s> I mistakenly believed it was 2x512 mb. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of trying to match this stick with another 1 gig stick for dual channel mode on a nforce4 939 motherboard (JetWay 939GT4SLI-G-VC). </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me if there's another brand that will do dual channel with it? </s>
<s> Finding the exact same ram stick for an acceptable price is problematic. </s>
<s> Specifications Part Number: PQI3200-1024SBL Package: 1024MB single pack Organization: 128M x 64-bit CAS Latency: 2-3-2-5 Test Voltage: 2.6 V PCB Board: 8 Layers PCB Speed: DDR 400 MHz (PC3200) Type: 184-pin DDR SDRAM Error Checking: Non-ECC Registered/Unbuffered: Unbuffered Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> What RAM is in it now ...1-512MB, 2-512MBs, 1GB now ? </s>

<s> wintec ampo ram there now, but hoping the 1 gig pqi ram stick can be paired with a similar stick for dual channel. </s>
<s> i just don't want to buy another stick and have them not work together. </s>
<s> Looks like there are matching DIMMs available ....what MB or system do you have now ? </s>

<s> dual channel is based on bank size, not stick size. </s>
<s> move the 2 512mb sticks into the first bank and put the 1gb sticks in the second bank. </s>
<s> you'll wind up with 2gb in dual channel mode. </s>
