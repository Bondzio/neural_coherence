Everything was going great until the keyboard and mouse started behaving stupidly. The keyboard wouldn't work with the mouse plugged in. I changed keyboards, and it now works. However, the mouse is still behaving erratically. When I boot, everything works fine, then the mouse will freeze a couple of times, then start, and then stop working all together. It's very annoying, to say the least. The only temporary fix is to restart windows, but I cant do that every time to mouse freezes as it usually does it less than two minutes into running. Any help would be wonderful.

Spyware - PC hasn't been hooked up to network yet, so no internet = no spyware - the hard drive I formatted as soon as I got it. btw the lights on the keyboard + mouse come on, then says error 301 keyboard not plaugged in or something like that before even hit's windows at boot - mouse stopped working altogether under windows, though laser is on and mouse works ith other machines. What should I clean it with?

Turned it on, said my prayers and - the keyboard didn't work, the machine wouldn't boot to windows - am lloking at getting a USB keyboard/mouse now.
