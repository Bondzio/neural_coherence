<s> Does anyone know if the Asus A8N Deluxe (which does have a AGP slot) is compatible with the ATI All in Wonder 9800 video board? </s>
<s> Thanks, David </s>
<s> none of the A8N motherboards by Asus has an AGP Slot. </s>
<s> Check your specs, i think you have the A8V-Deluxe. </s>
<s> The A8N was mainly designed for PCI-EXPRESS for AMD processors! </s>
<s> The A8V is basically a cheap version without PCI-EXPRESS AND SLI. </s>

<s> If this is the board it is &quot;pci express&quot; not agp. </s>

<s> As above but the question is the same. </s>
<s> Does the A8V deluxe MB work with the All in wonder 9800? </s>
<s> Thanks, David </s>
<s> Now that you switched the board number to A8V Deluxe, yes it will accept the AGP All-In-Wonder 9800. </s>
<s> The A8N boards as others explained is for PCI-Express X-16 video cards. </s>
<s> http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8v-d/overview.htm works with http://www.ati.com/products/radeon9800/aiw9800pro/specs.html and RADEON 9800 Series of products requires connection to your PC's internal power supply for operation. </s>
<s> This was connected. </s>
