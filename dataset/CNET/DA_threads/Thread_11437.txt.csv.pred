1.1.1	Good day I am trying to connect a computer to my network and this is the problem .	St
1.1.2	The lan cable I have is too short to reach the dsl router that I have and was wondering if I could do one of two things and if I can how to do it .	St
1.1.3	Maybe I can do neither but here is my thought .	St
1.1.4	First way : I have a d-link model DI-524 so could I plug in the cable from my dsl modem to the d-link wan plug and then run a cable to the computer , or Second way : I have 2 built in lan ports on my Asus P6T-Deluxe so could I run a lan cable from the second lan port to the other computer .	St
1.1.5	I have long enough cable to do either one of these , just do n't know if it will work .	St
1.1.6	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	I really do n't want to string another cable through if I don ' have to .	St
1.1.8	Thanks Sean Hope this is clear and enough info .	St
1.2.1	it would still seem to me that getting a longer cable is the best way to go .	St
1.2.2	If bridging between the ports on another computer is possible , so is getting the right length of cable .	St
1.2.3	They are n't that expensive .	St
1.2.4	While it 's probably possible to bridge two Ethernet ports on one PC ... and I 've not done that ... there is going to be a downside .	St
1.2.5	Is a longer cable not an option ?	Ques
1.3.1	The computer that has the 2 lan ports is halfway between the dsl modem and the second computer and I have a cable long enough to reach the second computer .	St
1.3.2	The computers are on the same floor so easy to run a cable .	St
1.3.3	The dsl modem is on a different floor and at the othe end of the house , running a cable would not be easy so I thought maybe with equipment I have I could cheat and make it easy .	St
1.3.4	Oh well , just a thought .	St
1.3.5	Thanks very much Sean	Polite
1.4.1	In this forum in the top 2 posts you find POST 17 that gives you an overview of how to use your d-link model DI-524 .	St
1.5.1	I do n't know the specs of that model but it should have at least 4 ports .	St
1.5.2	A router also offers another measure of security .	St
1.5.3	Even if I had only one PC , it would connect to the modem through a router .	St
1.6.1	modem & gt ; router & gt ; computer .	St
1.6.2	you can connect as many computer as you want to the open ports .	St
1.6.3	if you run out of ports , you can connect a switch to the router and connect some more computers	St
