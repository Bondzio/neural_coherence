<s> actually, I can change the resolution, but the monitor is not displaying it properly. </s>
<s> For example, I try to increase resolution from the default 1280x1024 (it's a Dell 20 inch widescreen lcd) instead of the image on screen getting smaller, the size of the display gets larger ... it expands beyond the physical boundaries of the screen. </s>
<s> That is to say, the functional area of the desktop increases in pixel width and height while all the elements on the screen stay the same size. </s>
<s> So when I move my mouse to the edge of the screen, instead of a hard stop, the display scrolls. </s>
<s> This behavior is really bugging me. </s>
<s> I don't want the screen to scroll around, I want the objects on the screen to get smaller so I can see more stuff at the same time. </s>
<s> Does anybody have any idea why this is happening and how to resolve it? </s>
<s> The display is attached via dvi-d to my IBM laptop ... </s>
<s> I don't have any other connection available. </s>
<s> TIA. </s>
<s> The native resolution of a Dell 20&quot; E207WFP is 1680x1050 and that's the highest res it will display. </s>
<s> Sounds like you've got a desktop panning feature turned on either via your graphics card or some 3rd party add-on. </s>
<s> to find out how to set the resolution required by the wide screen monitors. </s>
<s> Usually its not in the standard lineup, however they provide a procedure on how to revise the driver setting. </s>
