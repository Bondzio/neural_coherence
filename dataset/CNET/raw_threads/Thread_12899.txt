I can't tell if the BIOS is starting, since I can't see anything. Everything seems to be plugged in correctly, and everything powers on. I've tested the video card and monitor (and using the same PSU and hard drive) with another motherboard (ASUS M3A76-CM with AMD Phenom 9600 processor and 1x KVR800D2N6/2G memory), and it works just fine. I've also tried with no video card (plugging directly onto the VGA port on the motherboard), and with only one stick of RAM, and still get nothing. I had this same problem before, and requested a replacement A55M-P33 motherboard, but am having the same issue with the new one. Is this one defective as well, or am I missing something?

Use a VGA type connection for monitor and on-board video should have a display. If no display, then either the mtrbd. or PSU power lead for video is bad. You can reset the bios to defaults using the CMOS clearing so it can be at basics, just to have some display. If no display, then something is amiss, on what depends on your knowing if all connections are proper. The video P4 connection isn't the same as direct video card connections, so be careful or review your manual or guide for new video card. It should beep in protest is something is amiss, so be sure the spkr. is working too and/or connected right if not using an on-board spkr.. tada -----Willy
