<s> hi there. </s>
<s> My internet will just cut off ramdomly near enough every day. </s>
<s> some times 3-4 times a day. </s>
<s> the only i can get it working again is by restarting the computer which i quite annoying. </s>
<s> I am Running Windows Vista. </s>
<s> i connect to a 3com office adsl wireless router Ive have narrowed down some problems though. </s>
<s> I have also got 2 other computers connecting via a wire (1 Vista & 1 Windows Server 2003) and 2 laptops (1 vista & 1 2000) connecting wireless. </s>
<s> None of these ever disconnect. </s>
<s> I brought a 10/100/1000 Network card as i thought there might be a problem with the onboard LAN. </s>
<s> Which there can't be if it cuts out with this card. </s>
<s> When it cuts out it still says that it is connected at the bottom and disabling and enabling doesnt work nor does repairing it. </s>
<s> It could cut out when im using it or when im not. </s>
<s> It will keep me signed into Windows Live Messenger but i none of my messages go through to people. </s>
<s> Can Anyone Help Please. </s>

<s> I change the SSID to something like VIRUSFARM then enable SSID BROADCAST and use WPA for the security. </s>
<s> No other settings are touched. </s>
<s> If the laptop still disconnects make it a warranty issue. </s>
<s> Your post mentioned the wired connection fails so that's a truly bad sign. </s>

<s> it isnt the laptop that is disconnecting it is a computer. </s>
<s> i have 2 other computers and 2 other laptops.that connect to the same router. </s>
<s> the computer that is disconnecting uses a ethernet cable to connect. </s>

<s> If the desktop still disconnects make it a warranty issue. </s>

<s> I'd use a Linux bootable CD to see if that works OK. </s>
<s> The reason for the wifi setup is to shut down a possible issue there regarding MAC address spoofing. </s>

<s> I can't Make a warrently as i built the pc. </s>
<s> Why would i need to change the ssid and wap security. </s>
<s> there is nothing wrong with the connections to the 2 other computers and 2 other laptops , and i have a good firewall and no one is trying to get into the wireless router. </s>
<s> the only problem i have is the connection on my main pc (this one im using at the moment) </s>
<s> I know of a certain exploit and wanted to dismiss that by such changes. </s>
<s> As you are not agreeable to such configurations even as a test run I think I'm done here. </s>
<s> As to the bum machine that's sad. </s>
<s> Home builts can be trouble for some but let me depart with the usual cause. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The motherboard drivers were never installed. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A cracked OS was used. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It has nothing to do with the wifi . </s>
<s> I was just saying that two laptops connect via my router using wifi. </s>
<s> 2 computers(wired) and 2 laptops(wireless) connect perfectly to the router but the 3rd computer that is wired just keeps disconnecting, but the network connections in vista just says it is connected. </s>
<s> I had hoped we could work together on this. </s>
<s> But it is not to be. </s>
<s> I wish you the best in resolving this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
