I have a similar problem with a new i/o magic DVD RW 16x.
OS Win2K.
(no audio connector required).
I also have an old DVD-ROM in the system (with same problems) It plays audio cd's, mp3s, and even a DVD created with the packaged nero6.
So, when I put in a commercial DVD... NO AUDIO.
I got one pop up about Dolby decoders, but unable to find a reference to this online.
Any help is appreciated.
