I suspect you have a monitor issue.
Some things to fuss with.
Use the degauss feature of the monitor a couple of times...see if anything changes.
Verify the refresh rate and screen res selected are supported by the monitor.
Beg/borrow/steal another monitor for a test.
Take your monitor to another machine for a test.
