hi, yes your isp can detect of you're using a router because all router ip's are 192.168.1.1 but!
they are lying about it messing with they're network.
they just want you to buy more ip's.
i know all this cause i went threw that same exactthing with my isp.
needless to say i won that battle.
there's no way legally they can stop you from using a router
