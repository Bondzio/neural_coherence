I have been reading ways of setting up a 2 router network, and could use some help.
What I am trying to do for a small local business is this: DSL internet, in the house, PC in shop (40 to 50 feet away), and wireless access while in the shop.
What I was thinking of doing is taking a router from the house (that connects to the DSL modem and from router to PC) to the garage where a router would be set up as a switch with wireless capabilities.
I need the PCs to have file sharing.
I would love to see diagrams if anyone has links to them.
Thanks TC
