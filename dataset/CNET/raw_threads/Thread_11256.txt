And either a big monitor or a like 32&quot; TV (all for my bedroom). I'll be using it as my TV basically, I don't have cable. I'm new here, and input will be appreciated! John

If it's for your bedroom, one of the others would be better if they don't have lights on them (if you leave them powered all the time and if glowing lights will bother your sleep). That's the only drawback to them, otherwise I'd recommend them.
