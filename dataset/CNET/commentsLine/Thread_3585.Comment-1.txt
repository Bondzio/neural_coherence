my wd external hard drive, after a re-start went to raw file system, and i cannot format this drive anymore, i keep getting an error message &quot;windows was unable to format this drive&quot;.
it's a 2tb hard drive and i have about 18gb of data on it.
can anyone suggest what i can do to make this drive accessible and recover my data without having to pay over $100 to geek squad?
thanks
