my daughter is getting married this dec 2006 in manila, philippines.
i'm planning to send my hp laptop model z4610 with a built in wi-fi connection and would like to get an 802.11 webcam so they can take the ceremony live.
is it possible to watch the wedding on my home pc using the laptop and webcam that they have, or advice what other gadgets i need in order to watch it live and possibly record it on dvd.
my home pc has a dvd recorder.
i also would like to broadcast live or send a message using my pc and webcam and microphone to her during the wedding reception.
any help and assistance you can provide will be appreciated.
thanks edbaesa@aol.com
