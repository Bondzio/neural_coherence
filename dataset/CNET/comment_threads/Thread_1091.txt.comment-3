lol sorry i forgot X2 4800 2 GBs of XMS ram EVGA 7800 GTX 256 gpu 500Watt PSU nvidia nforce4 SLI rdy MOBO and 5 total fans And about the psu no i think mine is fine im just going to get a new one for future needs.
about the ripple it kind of looks like a line where the graphics are all messed up like srambled idk.
Altogether i know something has to be wrong cause a 500+ GPU card cant be this crappy.
Thanks again, Nick
