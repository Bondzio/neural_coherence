Hello, I recently started using a geforce fx5500 256MB DDR AGP 8x graphics card, the problem is, whenever I open a game, the whole computer restarts when the game reaches the menu!
until now, i tried freelancer and age of mythology.
my specs Processor: P4 1.7GHz RAM: 256MB PC133 SDRAM AGP: geforce fx5500 256MB DDR AGP 8x OS: WIN XP SP3 This might look like a thread from the stone ages by the looks of the game and specs, but please help me someone!!!
Thanks.
