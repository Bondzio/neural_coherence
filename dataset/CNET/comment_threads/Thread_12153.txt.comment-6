Seagate will provide the needed s/w I mentioned if you buy the retail &quot;HD kit&quot;, if not again they have it at their support website, probably Adonis based.
Also, if current setup is 2 HDs mounted, you maybe better off having &quot;two only&quot; one being the new HD and the old &quot;C&quot; primary drive.
Using the s/w will provide all you need to get things going.
I mention 2 drives only so disconnect(or remove for the time being the old 2nd HD).
Once that's all done, remove old &quot;C&quot; drive and then mount new &quot;C&quot; as primary drive as well as the old 2nd drive.
If all is done properly it should boot as if nothing happened, but with a new spacious HD.
Seagate has instruction, FAQ or guide for all this, just be sure to back-up critical or all data for safekeeping beforehand.
Take your time and enjoy your coffee of soda as well.
