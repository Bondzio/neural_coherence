hey guys, i purchased a new seagate 500gb sataii 7200.10 16mb hard drive.
it's my first time with a sata drive.
i installed xp on it, everything was working good.
i then went to restart, when i noticed that the pc wont boot all the time with this new hard drive.
sometimes when i reboot, it'll boot right into windows.. then, other times when i reboot, on the last page before displaying the windows loading screen, it'll just sit, with the little underscore in the top left corner.
sometimes i have to reboot 5 times before it'll boot up.
other times it'll boot up right away.
i do not get any messages or errors, and no weird beeps.
any idea what i can do to fix this?
it's simple enough to just keep rebooting, but it does become a pain... thanks alot!!!
