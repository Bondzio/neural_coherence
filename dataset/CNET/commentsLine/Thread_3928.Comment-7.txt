but i find some routers buckle under that use.
this forum's sticky is pretty specific and we supply a suggested setup that is secure and works across most routers.
if you are having problems with your router then you talk to its maker.
i have no cure for such routers short of going back to our forum suggested setups.
again, there are those that will suggest disabling ssid broadcast too.
but let's let those that suggest such tell you have to deal with what happens next.
