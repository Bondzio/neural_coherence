i have a: -laptop in fine working order -hard drive from my desktop that for some reason won't boot up to xp and has data on there that i want to recover.
not sure what the problem is, but one of three things happen when i power up the comp: 1. the drive is not detected or there is some sort of error before xp begins to load; 2. xp will act like it's loading and take an extremely long time; or 3. i'll get to the xp desktop, but my wallpaper is gone and xp is frozen -and i am going to purchase a usb hard drive (something i should have done a while ago) is it possible to get the data from my old drive to the usb drive using only the above items and the necessary cables, etc?
i don't have another computer with sata support, so absent some solution that i can conjure up here at home, i'm going to have to take it in somewhere.
