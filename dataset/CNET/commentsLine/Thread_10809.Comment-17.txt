like so many other things, my experience is much less than what is advertised.
voice quality is inconsistent, sometimes good - sometimes terrible; never excellent.
voice mail sometimes just does not work.
have spent total of a few hours with tech support trying to make service consistent.
finally they just offered me a refund, which i declined because i need the phone for the occasions that i will be on the phone for an extended period of time (calls to public utilities, etc.).
i have since purchased a second magicjack so friends in another state can call me as though i were still local to them.
(magicjack is regularly adding service in new areas) if you have reliable cell phone service or wired home phone, magicjack can be a suitable auxiliary, special use phone, but not reliable enough for one's primary phone.
in summation, while the unique service is worth $20/year to me as an auxiliary phone it, unfortunately, does not replace a reliable home phone.
