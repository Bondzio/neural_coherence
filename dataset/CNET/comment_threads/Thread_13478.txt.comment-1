Hi everybody, I wanted to buy a tablet, and until quite recently I had settled on getting the Apple ipad 2, 32 gb, wifi only.
I am a college student, and felt this was the best option out there.
however, I recently saw that lenovo released a tablet too, with, in fact, a digital pen, which i thought would make note taking in class totally awesome.
I don't know what the lenovo is like, so was wondering if i should stick to the tried and tested apple, or go ahead and buy the lenovo.
or, should I wait for a couple of months to see if an apple ipad 3 is released anytime soon?
thanks guys
