1.1.1	I am going to be traveling abroad for a month and I want to video skype with my wife .	St
1.1.2	I normally take my laptop with me for this purpose , but I was wondering if I could find something much smaller to do this with since I will not need my laptop for anything else on this trip .	St
1.1.3	I thought that a tablet would be the ticket , but after doing a little searching , to my utter amazement , skype is just now starting to support Android .	St
1.1.4	Also , most tablets only have a front facing camera .	St
1.1.5	Then I began to wonder if there was a smart phone that could be used for this .	St
1.1.6	Since they have been around longer then the tablets , I thought that might have better skype support .	St
1.1.7	I am just looking for a device that I can use to video skype with my wife over a wifi connection while traveling abroad .	St
1.1.8	Can anyone help me on this ?	Ques
1.2.1	Are you sure that & quot ; best & quot ; is a good idea ?	Ques
1.2.2	Maybe something that works would be ok ?	Ques
1.2.3	Did you try the iPad ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't want to try something to see if it will work .	St
1.3.2	I want to know what I buy will work before I buy it .	St
1.3.3	That is why I am asking questions here .	St
1.3.4	When I said best , I was talking specifically about Skyping .	St
1.3.5	I could care less about anything else .	St
1.3.6	The Ipad cost $ 500 .	St
1.3.7	That seems just a little high for the singular purpose I need this for .	St
1.3.8	That is why I suggested maybe a smart phone .	St
1.4.1	I 'm still seeing the ubiquitous netbook do this well .	St
1.4.2	I have a few android systems to use as our office is porting our apps to android and you are right they ( skype ) still feels like beta .	St
1.4.3	I think they need a little more time unless you put it on the newer 500 dollar dual core androids .	St
1.4.4	Which makes me think the iPad is the choice if you ca n't test it on your android under consideration .	St
1.4.5	Dogging this discussion is that the churn in the android tablets means that any unit I note may be upgraded , changed or discontinued by the time you go looking for it or Skype may change a little and what I tested will not work as well for you since something changed .	St
1.4.6	The iPad 2 is not suffering from those issues and why it may be today 's & quot ; best. & quot ; Bob	St
1.5.1	that the tablet market is still to volatile at this point to trust anything .	St
1.5.2	ARRG ! !	St
1.5.3	Technology for me is a love hate relationship .	St
1.5.4	If the whole tech industry would just slow down for a while maybe we would see some well thought out and refined products .	St
1.5.5	But we are stuck spending hundreds on half baked gadgets that promise to be better and less glitchy but never live up to that promise .	St
1.5.6	And instead of fixing the problem with existing equipment , they just release a new model and promise it will fix the problem .	St
1.5.7	Which it never does .	St
1.5.8	Sometimes I wish a solar EMP blast would hit the earth and fry every micro circuit on the planet .	St
1.5.9	It sure would make life more simple .	Res
1.5.10	Forget it then .	St
1.5.11	I will just take my old XP laptop .	St
1.5.12	At least I KNOW it works .	St
1.5.13	Thanks for the help .	St
1.6.1	After being in this biz for decades , the change to & quot ; we 'll fix it later with an internet update & quot ; means the makers are rolling out product that may not be completely free of issues .	St
1.6.2	You see that with Skype on android and other things .	St
1.6.3	There 's a classic movie film maker saying that I ca n't find attribute for that sounds appropriate .	St
1.6.4	- & gt ; & quot ; We 'll fix it in post .	St
1.6.5	Next scene. & quot ; Bob	St
1.7.1	Hi , Apple iPhone can do it for you .	St
1.8.1	What about the iPhone with no service or the Touch ?	Ques
1.9.1	I think a tablet with a bigger screen is good for skype .	St
1.9.2	And since Microsoft has acquired Skype , maybe those tablets using Microsoft OS will be better in the skype service .	St
1.10.1	it is an iPod Touch 4th Generation .	St
1.10.2	I bought two devices to see which one would fit the bill .	St
1.10.3	I bought an Acer ICONIA Tab A500 and an iPod Touch 4th generation .	St
1.10.4	Both of them will do skype .	St
1.10.5	But as far as portability , cost , functionality , market support and price are concerned , the iPod Touch 4th smashes the A500 to pieces .	St
1.10.6	Basically the iPod Touch gives you 95 % of the functionality of the Acer ICONIA Tab A500 , at half the price and 1/10th the size .	St
1.10.7	The Acer ICONIA Tab A500 is a fun toy , but is too big and heavy to be carried in anything other then a dedicated bag ( big purse , backpack , special case etc . )	St
1.10.8	Aside from that you can get an ultra portable or a netbook for about the same price , with a real keyboard and a few extra ounces in weight .	St
1.10.9	I am not sure what niche market the larger tablets could fill , other then the & quot ; I have got ta have the latest device just because it is cool & quot ; market .	St
1.10.10	Android looks like a good OS , but many of the apps that I wanted to install on my A500 , were still in alpha or beta stages .	St
1.10.11	I do hope it continues to grow in popularity and overcome apple and windows , but it is not at that stage yet .	St
1.10.12	Historically , I have avoided Apple products and software with a hatred .	St
1.10.13	But I am sad to have to admit that at least in the category of the iPod Touch , I could not find anything in that came close to it even for substantially more in price .	St
1.10.14	Now I know many will read this and want to point out many android smartphones .	St
1.10.15	I do not consider a smartphone to be in the same category as the iPod Touch 4th .	St
1.10.16	Even though they are similar in size and function , there is one major difference , one is free to operate and the other locks you in to an outrageously overpriced monthly data plan , or the fear of paying $ 10 per megabyte if you do n't have a data plan .	St
1.10.17	I personally refuse to pay $ 70 a month for a data plan when there are so many free wifi hotspots all over the place .	St
1.10.18	The iPod Touch 4th cost $ 199 and there is no android devices ( that are similar in size in any price range ) that can match it feature for feature .	St
1.10.19	Sadly , apple wins this round .	St
1.10.20	My hope is that android users will demand that device makers start to compete more aggressively in the IPod Touch category .	St
1.10.21	It would be nice for people like me who have a phobia of overprice data plans .	St
1.10.22	I do n't really understand this nations obsession with mobile data plans .	St
1.10.23	I have known many people that could not afford a car or rent , but could aslways find a way to pay $ 150 a month for their cell phone plan .	St
1.10.24	They might be homeless and freezing because they could not afford a coat , but at least they could post a facebook update before they went into deep hypothermia .	St
1.10.25	LOL !	St
1.10.26	Maybe those cigarettes ( they could some how afford as well ) will keep this from dying !	St
1.10.27	Do we really have our priorities straight ?	Ques
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	Noted widely .	St
1.12.2	Also at http : //www.dailyfinance.com/2011/11/22/kindle-fire-review-5-things-amazons-new-tablet-is-missing/	St
1.13.1	Here is detailed article I found on web regrading skype and tablets .	St
1.13.2	http : //www.guide4tablet.com/news/best-tablet-for-skype everything is simplified	St
1.14.1	Have you looked into getting a small 10 & quot ; netbook like the Acer Aspire One for less than $ 300 ?	Ques
1.14.2	https : //www.google.com/search ? q=acer+netbook & ie=utf-8 & oe=utf-8 & aq=t & rls=org.mozilla : en-US : official & client=firefox-a # q=acer+netbook & hl=en & client=firefox-a & hs=le1 & rls=org.mozilla : en-US : official & prmd=imvns & source=univ & tbm=shop & tbo=u & sa=X & ei=ChEiUNmnJars2QWRsYGABg & ved=0CKMBELMY & bav=on.2 , or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf. & fp=231f583a4628cc32 & biw=1141 & bih=604 Walmar sells them for less than $ 249 : http : //www.walmart.com/ip/Your-Choice-of-Color-Acer-10.1-Netbook-PC-with-Intel-Atom-Dual-Core-N2600-Processor-and-Windows-7-Starter-Value-Bundle/21054383 It is equivalent to a tiny laptop running a fully functional Windows system so you can run Microsoft Office , etc on it .	St
1.14.3	It has a built-in camera allowing you to Skype as well as on any full sized laptop .	St
1.14.4	I have tried Skyping on the Samsung Tab 2 and the new Google Nexus 7 without much luck .	St
1.14.5	The cameras do n't have the resolution to project clear and stable images .	St
1.14.6	The iPads would work but they cost more than twice the netbooks .	St
1.14.7	I love the netbook and take it everywhere .	St
1.14.8	Is suspect Microsoft will be releasing a tablet running Windows soon , but until then , the netbook is the next best thing .	St
1.14.9	Good luck !	Polite
