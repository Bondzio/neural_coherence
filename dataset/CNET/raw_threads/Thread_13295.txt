But!!!	http://club.myce.com/f34/inkjet-printable-dvd-white-vs-silver-179200/ explains why some folk want White DVDs.

I'm thinking you might be thinking you want to get some of those silver white blanks that games and such are made from. HOWEVER these are not &quot;recorded&quot; but pressed. Here's a video about this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZKD2aYLTWw Can you clarify what you are looking for? Bob
