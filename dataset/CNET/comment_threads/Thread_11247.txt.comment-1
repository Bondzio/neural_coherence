A while ago my 350W PSU failed so I replaced it with an Antec truepower trio 550W.
I connected it to my Asus M3A motherboard and when I turned it on, sparks came out of that motherboard.
The motherboard is wasted, and I was told that something with CPU voltages went wrong, I don't really understand, but anyhow, I need to get a new motherboard.
I want it to either be compatible with the 550W PSU and my Athlon 64 X2 dual core 6400+ (because somehow, that's where it went wrong).
OR If you say it's silly to buy a new motherboard and not a new CPU, which ones should I buy, that are compatible with eachother, my PSU, my memory (I really don't have a clue what type or RAM it is, I could check if you want).
I really need some help with this, I want to avoid another &quot;fireworks party&quot;, and need my PC up and running again soon.
