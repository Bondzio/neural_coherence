Hi, I am trying to buy new RAM for my gateway desktop and there is a really good deal on for some DDR3 1600MHz RAM.
The memory adviser results on the crucial website say that my computer can hold 16GB of 1333MHz DDR3 ( http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=FX6831-01&amp;Cat=RAM ).
But does that mean that my computer can't handle 1600MHz RAM?
And would there be a performance difference if i was to have 1600MHz instead of the 1333MHz?
Also, does it matter if the RAM is DRAM or SDRAM?
Thanks
