Thanks for the reply Willy.
I was able to test my PSU with my brother's very old PC (its the only component still compatible with his set up) and it started up fine.
While I am not entirely sure this was the most effective test (his PC is going on 5 years old), it proves my PSU isn't completely dead.
Should I just RMA my mobo and see what comes back?
