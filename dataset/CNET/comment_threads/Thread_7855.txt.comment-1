Hi, my girlfriend and I are both experiencing the same problem.
We will be in the middle of doing something and the computer will just turn off.
Not even like it's going to reboot....turns off completely.
Both on laptops....her's is a compaq and mine is an IBM thinkpad both running XP Pro.
What could be causing this....very annoyed
