in your first post you wrote: &quot;.
i did find an atx to at converter but it looked like the atx side was male and i need it to be female.
&quot; upon double-checking i find the atx side of such a cable would indeed have male electrical contacts.
but now you write: &quot;anything more?
like where i might find what i need?
what the exact name is of what i need?&quot; this confuses me.
your first post stated you already found it?
what changed?
