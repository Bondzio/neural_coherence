<s> Well, it's been awhile since i've upgraded my video card (I have a Sapphire ATI 8500LE, AGP, 250/400, 128MB). </s>
<s> I just bought Battlefield 2, and found out I really need to. </s>
<s> Normally, i'm diehard ATI, but i've been looking at Nvidia's latest stuff and it doesn't look half bad. </s>
<s> So, basically, i'm looking for the best card for $100-200, ATI or Nvidia. </s>
<s> I will be using it just about exclusivley for gaming (see Battlefield 2 for screenshots). </s>
<s> Now, I don't have PCI express, but if there's a great card that has to have it, my motherboard's getting old and could be replaced too. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance guys. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> Motherboard can support AGP 4X/8X and regular PCI. </s>
<s> Also, sorry if this has been asked before, I really didn't want to search the whole forum. </s>
<s> cost 200 bucks at newegg. </s>
<s> man you will need an upgrade. </s>
<s> bf2 is one of the most demanding pc games on your graphics card and also ram. </s>
<s> (i have the game) well for ati, at LEAST a 9600 or 9800 PRO. </s>
<s> nvidia, the requirements are steep, ea recomends at least a 5700 or greater so i would go at least a 6600gt or 6800 you might have to upgrade your power supply if you choose the 6800 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130202 thats the 6800 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121195 6600gt http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102290 9800 pro those are all great cards. </s>

<s> Looks like I can get a refurb ATI X800 series for around 150-200, how about them? </s>
<s> I'd have to upgrade my motherboard, but it kind of could use it anyways. </s>
<s> pretty much any x800 series video card performs well. </s>
<s> the x800 series is stable btw and runs cooler than the 6800s. </s>
