what you are doing is squeezing the mouse when you press the left button and activating Expos.
There are two ways to fix this problem: 1.
Try to relax when using the mouse and be careful how you lift it to a different place on your desk/table/whatever.
2.
Turn off button 4 (the side buttons) by going to the System Preferences &gt; Keyboard & Mouse &gt; Mouse Tab and choosing OFF from the drop down menu for the side button.
You can also turn on the Right button and use it as a Secondary button for bringing up contextual menus when you click it.
Things like Copy, Paste, New Folder, Get info, etc., if you have not already done so.
Does that solve your problem?
