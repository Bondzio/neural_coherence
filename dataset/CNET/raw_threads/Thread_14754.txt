Recently, for some reason, although I am on the right network, and signal strength is full - I am unable to connect to the internet! I've called my provider, and everything is fine on their end according to their systems. I've tried power cycling, and checking my settings, and everything SEEMS to be ok. Am I doing something wrong? What do I do? I am very frustrated. Please help.

If no, then there could be a problem with your Modem or Router. If yes, Reset the Airport Extreme and run the Airport Setup assistant again. P

You have to establish a connection to the internet first to rule out all the variables. Shut down everything, modem/router/switches/airport/computer. Connect the computer directly to the modem. Make sure the computer is set to expect an IP address via DHCP or if you are using PPPoE, that everything in that section is correct. Connect should be via Built-in Ethernet. Bring them back up in the same order, waiting for each one to become ready before firing up the next one. Once the modem and computer are back up, try to get on-line. Take a look at the Network Preferances pane and see if the computer has an IP address. If it starts with 169, shut it all down and try again. P

Suddenly it fails to connect to the internet although signal strength is high. When I abandon the Extreme and opt for the plain old wifi offered on the primary household system, voila! Internet. But the Extreme is faster and preferred on this machine. I have recycled power on the Extreme's hardware unit. No joy. I'm running OS-X, 10.5.2. No software updates pending. Thanks.

The internet connection always works on the mini-mac (running10.5.4). The internet connection is sporadic on the powerbook G4 (OS 10.4.11). Like now there is no internet, but the airport signal strength is great. Restarting the base station or the Powerbook does not solve the problem. You had this problem in the past. What was your solution?
