i tried every combination of deleting document and deleting printer and reinstalling driver, restarting print document.
what's most interesting is that not one, but two local usb printers were &quot;stopped&quot; after installation of network printer.
no document was being printed to one of those usb printers, only the laser.
yet printer setup utility shows both &quot;stopped.&quot; are you suggesting i search for files with names of either usb printer and delete them?
