<s> I am running an apple G5 system with a linksys wireless router (WRT54G). </s>
<s> Running two wireless adapters for both my tivo series 2 and xbox to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Right now I would like to add a LINKSYS WVC54G webcam. </s>
<s> On cnet there was a weekend project that shows how to add a wireless webcam to your existing network, also stated in the notes that on a mac you cannot use internet explorer and firefox. </s>
<s> My question is will this webcam work with apple's safari application? </s>
<s> There seems to be no mac compatible webcams to connect to my wireless router. </s>
<s> And no, the isight and any logitech webcam wont cut it. </s>
<s> I need something where i can view my home from the internet from work. </s>
<s> appreciate any help on this one. </s>
<s> the cnet editors forgot to leave out useful information for mac users who happen to want this particular setup, utilizing a linksys wireless router and webcam. </s>
<s> This one by Logitec claims to be both PC and Mac. </s>

<s> Stiggymac, Did you find out if the linksys wvc54g webcam would work with Safari? </s>
<s> Did you find a wireless cam? </s>

<s> I've been doing the same research for a Wireless(G)webcam for my baby that is arriving in may. </s>
<s> The issue is that many of these shitacular webcams use ActiveX (and therefore require a PC with IE) in order to display the web cam contents. </s>
<s> This Product: http://www.hawkingtech.com/products/productlist.php?CatID=24&FamID=15&ProdID=180 Should work with Safari as it uses Java to display content. </s>
<s> It explicitly states that it works in Mac OS environments as well ( and has Web based administration). </s>
<s> It costs about $155, and I've heard from at least one other mac user that it works fine. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Loert </s>
