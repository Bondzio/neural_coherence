i tend to use ccleaner(google for it) as a registry(and system) cleaner.
using its defaults does pretty well.
in no way will it cure any hardcore problems as you mentioned, &quot;crashes&quot;, but it should clean some of the junk out.
i further suggest, if you already know the location of junk files, directories, registry, etc., delete them manually using regedit.
make darn sure its the proper action to take.
you can use the restore(create) point feature of ms to help in case you hose your system.
then defrag the hd to help consolidate it.
if you had any &quot;hic-cups&quot; during the un-install, try reloading the problem app/pgm.
and re-use its uninstall feature or the add/remove from ms. tada -----willy
