pcps is a nice tool but it's only a tool.
i just ran it and it says my vid perf is 145% of similar,,,,what does similar mean??
keep in mind their running a 2d test, not much value in a gamers world.
if you want to play with this go here.
get their perf test, 5.0 i think, and then a big piece of paper and a pencil as you test vid drivers, mobo drivers, bios settings and build a chart.
it's great fun.
