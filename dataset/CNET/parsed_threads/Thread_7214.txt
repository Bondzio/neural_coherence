<s> I currently have one PC connected to a cable modem for my DSL service. </s>
<s> I just bought another PC and want to use the same (one) cable provider. </s>
<s> When I called them, they said I woudl need to pay them the full fee for the second cable modem... My question, why can't I just purchase a cable modem and hook it up to the coaxial wall outlet in the room I want to use the PC? </s>
<s> Do I have to really tell my cable company? </s>
<s> Thanks, Novice-Luis </s>
<s> but the solution is a 4 port wired/wireless router. </s>
<s> No need to pay for a second IP address, and plugging another cable modem into the wall jack will not work unless you pay for another account. </s>
<s> The routers the cheaper solution. </s>
