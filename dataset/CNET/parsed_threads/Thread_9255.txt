<s> Hello, I have a Simpletech 500 gb external hard drive that I've had for over 2 years. </s>
<s> I have it connected to my Dell PC, and I use it for backing up media files (music, videos, pictures). </s>
<s> I have never had a problem using the hard drive on my PC, my work computer, or a friend's computer. </s>
<s> However, today, after disconnecting and reconnecting my computer to move it to a different area in my house, my computer does not detect my HD. </s>
<s> The HD powers up, the light is on, but it doesn't show up in My Computer. </s>
<s> I've tried restarting my PC with the HD connected, tried uninstalling USBs, tried using a different power supply, tried several different USB ports (before and after uninstalling and reinstalling), and have had no luck. </s>
<s> It does not show up in Device Manager, or in disk management. </s>
<s> I have not tried connecting to another computer. </s>
<s> My work computer is stored away for the summer, and I haven't had time to use a friend's computer. </s>
<s> Any help anybody can provide would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I've seen similar results and the users state what you did. </s>
<s> Unfornutunely the only idea that comes-up, the ext. </s>
<s> HD got smacked, regardless if you un-intended or not. </s>
<s> Somewhow in the move it got damaged or the last dismount was a improper one. </s>
<s> The events just don't always follow inline for the cause, but you see the results. </s>
<s> I wish you do test the ext. </s>
<s> HD elsewhere to eliminate it from the list. </s>
<s> If it fails on another PC, then you know the ext. </s>
<s> HD is kaput. </s>
<s> The other cause is the ext. </s>
<s> HD own i/f or power supply has bellied-up. </s>
<s> If you can test with some certainly(same type) do so. </s>
<s> Otherwsie, you open the ext. </s>
<s> case and mount the HD or swap it out to aniother ext. </s>
<s> case as well. </s>
<s> One of the other test is to recues it. </s>
<s> Of course, you may void any warranty if you open it. </s>
<s> Check with the vendor/maker to see what is reqwuired to start the waranty service is applicable. </s>
<s> You seemto have tested the ext. </s>
<s> case as best you can, but offer the advise and hope it helps. </s>
