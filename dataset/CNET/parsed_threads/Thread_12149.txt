<s> This is probably an easy question to answer, but I'm a n00b so here goes: I just bought a video card, cost me like 300 dollars and I was wondering if I would need an extra power source to run it. </s>
<s> To find this out I need to determine what kind of power source I already have in this cheap wal-mart computer, so can anyone help me? </s>
<s> Or is there anything else I need to know, maybe I'm going about this wrong... any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Check where the main input cable goes, and there should be a big fan beside it. </s>
<s> Take off the Computer side cover and there should be a box 9 x 6 x 4&quot;. </s>
<s> On the side there should be a description, like 'ATX 12 volt' 'with 'PFC' etc. </s>
<s> Then there should be a data sheet in small writing with wattage, etc. </s>
<s> beneath the description. </s>
<s> Depending on what card you bought, think about a minimum of 400 watts. </s>
