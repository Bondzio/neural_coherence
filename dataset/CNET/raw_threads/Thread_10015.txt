I've scanned my hard drive with Western Digital Data Lifeguard Diagnostics and HDTune and they both came back saying my hard drive has bad sectors. Does bad sectors mean that my hard drive has physical damage to it and is not fixable.

Now it is your choice to replace it, backup your files or &quot;your choice&quot; what to do next. I'm sure someone will write about sector sparing and more but if there were spares then the drive would have already done this and you would not be asking. Bob
