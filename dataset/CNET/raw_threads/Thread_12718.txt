It is discovered during bootup but has other than PC Fat file system. Will not fdisk. Can this drive be partioned and formatted for a PC. I've tried a few partitioning programs with this drive as a slave drive. Any help is appreciated.

You can google that information, but it takes a special program to unlock it (which I don't have) if DELPART doesn't touch it. &quot;Hard Disk Security BIOS-level hard disk security and password support utilizing ATA/ATAPI Security Protocols Version 1.1,&quot; http://www.ami.com/support/downloaddoc.cfm?DLFile=support/doc/AMIBIOS8_HDD_Security.pdf&FileID=510 and other places...
