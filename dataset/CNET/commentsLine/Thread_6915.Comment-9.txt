if you want to get rid of the ptr.
just box it up and give whatever you do have to goodwill or sal army store.
i find many and usually, they're good to go and yes, i don't need the manual, just the drivers.
of course the ptr.
works, but the cost of ink carts makes it a doubtful deal, but when then the end-users are pretty happy to pay when the cost is nominal and it works, plus usually these prtrs.
i salvage are more than simple bottom-end models if new.
well, sad to hear the manual would cost too much.
