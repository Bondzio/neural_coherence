1.1.1	so almost every computer extra uses usb but some are starting to use firewire.	St
1.1.2	is it worth it to add firewire ports to an old computer.	St
1.1.3	and is faster/replacing usb?	St
1.2.1	fireware 800 (1394b) is significantly faster than both but there are very few firewire 800 devices.	St
1.2.2	unless you have a digital camcorder or a specific need for firewire, there is no compelling reason to add a firewire card if you already have usb 2.	St
1.3.1	that will save me some money	St
