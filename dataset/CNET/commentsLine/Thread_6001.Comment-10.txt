for xp, vista we let it manage it.
even with your noted application.
as to the dell comment, all makers were hit with the issue noted at  so to pan dell for a machine past 4 years old... there are other issues such as fans that slow with time, etc.
but no maker would be immune here.
sorry but so far the clues only point to possible heat issues.
