Hi there I took out the HDD(Toshiba MK1516GAP 15GB ATA-2/3/4 2.5&quot; 9.5mm Hard Drive) from an old vaio notebook and put it into a 2.5 external casing (usb) to use as portable storage.
When all is connected windows recognizes the drive i.e as a toshiba and its size.
Now the problem arises when i try to read from or write to the drive.
For the first few minutes(5min) after i plug in the usb cable i seem to be able to read and write to the drive.
Then after i keep getting the following message: Windows -Delayed Write Failed ------------------------------ Windows was unable to save all the data for the file (path of file).
The data has been lost.
This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection.
Please try to save this file elsewhere.
When i then try to access the drive i get this: I:\ is not accessible The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error Any help given would be very much appreciated
