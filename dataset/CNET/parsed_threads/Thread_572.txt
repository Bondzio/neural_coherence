<s> My internal Dual-Format DVD ReWritable Drive recently stopped recognizing disks. </s>
<s> Whether I try to read or write. </s>
<s> It worked faily well until I installed new firmware. </s>
<s> I would like to uninstall the firmware but can't figure out how. </s>
<s> I tried System Restore but none of the restore dates would work. </s>
<s> The Device Manager says that it is working properly. </s>
<s> But whenever I put a disk into it, it prompts me to insert a disk. </s>

<s> I think computer viruses should count as life. </s>
<s> I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. </s>
