i'm a little taken aback with the prices you listed.
my recent upgrade was a netgear wpnt-834 for 69 bucks refurb from geeks.com.
i found a buffalo whr-hp-g54 for 49 bucks on sale at best buy which is doing a stint running a linux based router firmware since i wanted to do that for some time.
the gigabit wifi router is a nice touch since i doubt you'll replace that any day soon.
