I have the same problem with a Toshiba M55-S329.
I put an old 3COM card in the PCMCIA slot and the network came up correctly the first time still using the xp home edition.
It took me about 3 hours of searching the net for the driver before finding this formun entry.
Now if I can only get Ghost to work using the 3COM card in the PCMCIA slot (different problem), I will be happy and can migrate back to W2K.
Even if I do lose a couple of ports... Al
