1.1.1	I have tried everything I can to get my microphone to work , and it is still too quiet .	St
1.1.2	I am using an old microphone , but I know it is still a good mic because it works fine on my laptop , but is too quiet to be of any use on my desktop .	St
1.1.3	The sound card I am using is the card built into my motherboard , which is an MSI motherboard .	St
1.1.4	The driver it uses is is the Realtek AC'97 Audio driver .	St
1.1.5	Here is a quick list of everything I have tried : 1 .	St
1.1.6	The mic is plugged into the correct input .	St
1.1.7	I know this because the microphone does give me a little input , but it 's too quiet to be useful .	St
1.1.8	2 .	St
1.1.9	I turned on the 20 dB Mic boost in the advanced microphone volume .	St
1.1.10	3 .	St
1.1.11	After this I turned the Microphone volume all the way up under volume control , and tried recording .	St
1.1.12	This is the first time I could hear the recording , but I have to turn the speakers up all the way to hear it .	St
1.1.13	Also , the microphone volume should n't have to be all the way up .	St
1.1.14	On my laptop I usually have it around 50 % -70 % of the max volume .	St
1.1.15	Obviously it is n't being boosted enough .	St
1.1.16	4 .	St
1.1.17	To try to improve this , I reinstalled the Audio driver , and that did n't help .	St
1.1.18	5 .	St
1.1.19	I tried changing settings on the Sound effects manager that comes with the audio driver , and nothing there helped .	St
1.1.20	6 .	St
1.1.21	I tried changing settings on the audio recording programs I was using , and neither the standard Windows Sound Recorder nor Audacity had settings I could change to boost input .	St
1.1.22	7 .	St
1.1.23	I tried reinstalling Audacity , and that did n't help .	St
1.1.24	All the other forums have said that if those steps do n't work , then I need to get a new mic , but I know that it is n't the mic that is the problem because it works just fine on my laptop .	St
1.1.25	Is there anything else I have n't tried that would boost the input level ?	Ques
1.1.26	Are there any settings in Audacity that would boost the input while recording ?	Ques
1.1.27	Thanks in advance for any help .	St
