no game in particular, almost every game i tried had a very low and unstable frame rate.
i tried far cry, warcraft 3, ut 2004, world of warcraft, battlefiel vietnam, are the first names which comes to my mind... do you think that simply doubling the memory would be enough.
i think 512mb are not enough to play modern games...
