I am running Xp home MSI 875p neo3 F pen 4 2.8 GHz 1 Gig memory 2 x Maxtor l01m120 120 gb SATA HDD All-in-Wonder 9800 HP DVD 420I Memorex CD/DVD rom I somehow deleted the raid drivers and now my cd roms will not work.
Device manager gives me a code 41 under the cd rom drives.
Windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device.
(Code 41) Under the SCSI/raid controllers, I get this: Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged.
(Code 19) I cannot reinstall win XP without a CD rom drive and cannot install drivers without redoing XP?
Completely at a loss.
This is my baby, I built her in 2003, and I can't fix her for the 1st time!
