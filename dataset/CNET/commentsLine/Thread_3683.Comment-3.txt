i have alot of important data on the hard drive and need to possibly transfer files larger than 4gb, as i work with video and film.
i also use mac and pc.
it is in fat32 format where the limit is 4gb as you mentioned, what is the format that will work with both platforms and support &gt;4gb files, will i have to reformat and delete everything?
thanks bristowlicious
