<s> After hearing bad things about the Dell U2711 monitor specifically its horrible anti glair coating. </s>
<s> I am after another 27&quot; monitor around the same price range. </s>
<s> I really like the mac monitor with its glossy finish so would like something similar only compatible with windows and not so expensive. </s>
<s> I've checked out the Samsung LS27A850DS and the new Dell Ultrasharp U2713HM. </s>
<s> But I can't make my mind up. </s>
<s> What do you believe is the better of the two? </s>
<s> Or do you have any other suggestions? </s>
<s> I will not be using for gaming but rather, photoshop, image editing etc (I'm a web developer / designer) Thanks </s>
<s> I went looking to see if they had tested the color gamut and more. </s>
<s> Since you are using photoshop then either look nice enough to me and all I would do is install it then calibrate it with my Pantone Huey or Spyder. </s>
