so, i am ready to pick up a semi-decent gaming pc.
i'm afraid my tech skills have diminished quite a bit over the last few years.
never had the time to keep up with the exploding tech.
deciding between two.
amd phenom ii x6 1055t 2.8ghz processor 64 bit six-core 8gb amd radeon hd 6670 1gb intel core i5-2320 3.0ghz processor 64 bit quad-core 8gb amd radeon hd 6770 1gb i'm leaning toward the second one, i believe i can actually upgrade ram on this one, but i'm confused on the &quot;core&quot; amount.
four vs. six?
meaningful?
necessary?
any help or thoughts would be great.
thanks in advance!
!
