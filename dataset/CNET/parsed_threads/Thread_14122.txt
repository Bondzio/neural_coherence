<s> I need a new modem, mine is dying. </s>
<s> How do i know which one will work with my system. </s>
<s> I am using xp on my dell. </s>
<s> I am using AT&T 3mbps DSL service. </s>
<s> My current modem is a Motorola 2210-02 DSL Modem. </s>
<s> It is okay, but i just might have gotten a good one cause a lot of people had trouble with theirs. </s>
<s> The tech at AT&T suggested a Netgear 7550. </s>
<s> It has gotten some poor reviews. </s>
<s> I would just like the correct modem that works well and lasts a while. </s>
<s> All modems (why not buy a modem/wireless router combo, so you can go wireless with your laptop, phone and tablet?) </s>
<s> will work with your XP system (and, in fact, with Linux and Apple also). </s>
<s> The most important thing is that it is able to work with AT&T. </s>
