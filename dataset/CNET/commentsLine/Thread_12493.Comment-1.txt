i have recently been banned from a website and they thave banned me from it by &quot;logging my ip address&quot;.
i am not sure how this works(im not really that expereienced with computers) but apparently to change your ip address if you have broadband you have to speak to your isp.
is there any other way?
additional info: i am using a wirless router(does this mean the router has an different ip?)
