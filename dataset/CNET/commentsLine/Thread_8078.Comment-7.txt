i have a wide screen digital 1680 x 1050 and the the right of that my older analog 1280 x 1024. i run several websites and this enables me to have two main documents open side by side on the main screen and various stickies, images, address books and calendars open on the secondary display.
this is very easy to set up and documents can be slid seamlessly from one monitor to the other as though it were a single screen.
if i had a third monitor i would add that too if i could find a graphics card to handle it.
my present on is nvidia gs 7600. if you are used to working with your windows at full screen, you have to change that habit, but after that it gets better and better.
