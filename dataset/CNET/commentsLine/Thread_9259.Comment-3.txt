hi john, thanks for your reply.
i currently have no way to hook my laptop into our system.
it is a very odd arrangement and old with just one mic and cord that runs approx.
30' under the platform to a box that allows us to control the volume.
i was hopeing for a solution that would allow me to use a wireless mic that would be picked up by some type of sensor off of the usb on my laptop.
i would then use nero or roxio to do the actual recording.
do you have any further thoughts?
nate
