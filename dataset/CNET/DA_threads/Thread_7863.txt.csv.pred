1.1.1	I have this SAMSUNG 400GB PATA drive that spins OK but Windows wants to initialise all the time .	St
1.1.2	I have tried EASYRECOVERY PROFESSIONAL and it says there 's no file system on it : the rapid SMART TEST shows the drive passes the test ; so i tried the raw data recovery option , but after 5 minutes i get an error message and the drive starts clicking , so i stopped it immediately .	St
1.1.3	I tried R-Studio and it too sees the drive with no file system , attempts a RAW recovery but there again after 5 minutes the drive starts to click and i stop it .	St
1.1.4	Now , i boot from UBUNTU CD , UBUNTU RESCUE REMIX or even KNOPPIX , and none of them sees the drive ! ! !	St
1.1.5	Any idea how to get my data back ?	Ques
1.1.6	?	Ques
1.2.1	It might be interesting if you told what that error message is .	St
1.2.2	The best way to get your data back is from your backup .	St
1.2.3	The second best way is by paying a data recovery company .	St
1.2.4	With disks that fail mechanically , as appears to be the case with this one , that 's quite expensive .	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	I 've just downloaded the Samsung utility test and it passed with flying colors all the tests : READ DMA SPIN DOWN/UP CHECK SMART SIMPLE SURFACE SCAN WRITE VERIFY RANDOM SURFACE SCAN RAM VERIFY TEST MULTIPLE READ TEST & quot ; YOUR DD HAS NO ERROR ! & quot ; it says ... & lt ; div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.4.1	So it 's a perfect drive .	St
1.4.2	But : - it 's unpartitioned ( RAW ) - recovery stops after 5 minutes If you trust that diagnostic , you simply repartition it , loose all your data and hope for the best .	St
1.4.3	But you said you want to recover your data , so maybe that would n't be your preferred idea .	St
1.4.4	All I can offer : try the other recovery programs from http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911.html Maybe one works .	St
1.4.5	Maybe none work .	St
1.4.6	You 'll only know when you try .	St
1.4.7	Kees	St
