XP needs 512mb-1gb of ram to run good, while Vista needs 1gb-2gb of ram.
What does that tell you.
Next, if a gamer system, many cures&fixes have been worked out to run with XP.
Under Vista, game companies still lag in offering anything that does bring anything to a crawl and if you have Vista, its worse.
Excluding DX10, Vista bonus there's not too much to brag about.
XP, still remains the gamer's choice.
If you're not a gamer, then either will do.
However, Vista is still a resource hog no matter how you fiddle with it, IMHO.
