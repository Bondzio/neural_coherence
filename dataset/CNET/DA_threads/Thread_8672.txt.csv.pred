1.1.1	I just hooked up a Wireless Access Point ( WAP ) I got from a friend to my home network & it works .	St
1.1.2	Now , I 've go to enable the security freatures .	St
1.1.3	Unfortunatley , I have no clue what its IP address is .	St
1.1.4	I 've gotten to the Manufacturer 's web site and their utility to connect to the WAP does not connect and the & quot ; reset to default settings & quot ; procedure as described in the user manual does not work .	St
1.1.5	I 've tried a bevy of network tools like Look @ LAN but none of them discover the WAP .	St
1.1.6	I can only assume the WAP has an IP addresss that does not live within 192.168.0.n I only have the MAC address printed on the serial number sticker attached to the bottom of the WAP .	St
1.1.7	Is there a utility that wil allow me to ping by MAC Address to find out what the IP address is ?	Ques
1.2.1	You said that 'it works ' and concluded that you now need to set up the security .	St
1.2.2	I assume you mean you can currently get out to the internet , but you can not get connected to the router itself .	St
1.2.3	If this is the case , just use the default gateway IP in your ipconfig output .	St
1.2.4	It is the IP assigned to the router .	St
1.2.5	The answer to the question is you can not ping by a MAC address unless the device is running reverse ARP .	St
1.2.6	Recommend if you are not getting a lease , reset the router device to factory defaults - it is easier than anything else , usually .	St
1.3.1	Sorry I did not make myself cleearer .	St
1.3.2	I 've had the D-Link router for ages and I alredy know its IP address , what I need to find is the IP address of the WAP so that I can setup the key .	St
1.3.3	That 's my dilema .	St
1.3.4	I do n't know the IP address of the WAP as it is not in the 192.168.0.xxx range	St
1.4.1	I 've got the same problem .	St
1.4.2	Find a solution yet ?	Ques
1.5.1	No one seems to know how - I 've tried several versions of network tools and none appear to be able to help - all want to set upper and lower boundary IP Addresses adn that 's what I do not have ALL I WANT TO DO IS & quot ; MACPING 0006F404D35A & quot ; and have it come back and tell me the IP address .	St
1.5.2	Maybe I 'm naive but is that too difficult ?	Ques
1.6.1	http : //groups.google.com/groups ? hl=en & q=PING % 20MAC % 20ADDRESS	St
1.7.1	that the web based IP address for D-link ...	St
1.8.1	You set your address to something in the 192.x.x.x range with a netmask of 255.0.0.0 and then run something like this to scan the entire 192. block ?	Ques
1.8.2	http : //www.angryziber.com/ipscan/	St
1.9.1	This is a seriously old thread and should have been taken down years ago since there is no answer to the original question .	St
1.9.2	When I was searching for information on MAC addresses this came up in the first page of results on google .	St
1.9.3	People pay good money to get on the first page of a google search and I wonder how an old piece of CRUFT like this persists .	St
1.9.4	I think the answer is that people keep clicking on it and going to it and get disappointed with the thread ending without a solution ... so here 's a solution : I am assuming that you plugged your WAP into your D-Link router .	St
1.9.5	When you switch the WAP on , it will request an IP address from your router 's DHCP server .	St
1.9.6	From a computer connected to your wired network , you then go into your D-link router 's admin utility and look at the DHCP client table and the WAP IP address will be listed along with all the other connected devices .	St
1.9.7	Enter the WAP IP address in the URL field of your browser and you should be prompted with a password screen .	St
1.9.8	If you have reset your WAP to factory specs ( as you have said ) then you enter the default username and password and you are in .	St
1.9.9	If you want any security at all you will not run applications from the web directly to & quot ; help & quot ; you with security concerns as suggested above .	St
1.9.10	For basic security you should rename the SSID , reset the password , enable MAC address filtering , and enable encription ( WPA/WPA2 ) using a strong passphrase .	St
1.9.11	There are of course many other things you can do with your network to increase security , but it has been said that having locks on your home only keeps the polite people out .	St
1.9.12	This seems to apply to networks also ...	St
