<s> This is my first post here so pardon me for my mistakes. </s>
<s> I am planing to buy an external hard disk of 500 GB. </s>
<s> I am from India and my budget is at most Rupees 4000. </s>
<s> I am not inclined towards any brands. </s>
<s> I've heard the pioneers in this segment are Seagate, Western Digital, Transcend and Buffalo and these are usually common here. </s>
<s> I've heard there are subtypes like portable, go-flex, backup plus and maybe more. </s>
<s> I can understand portable but don't know what the latter ones mean. </s>
<s> Please give and insight on that. </s>
<s> I own a Dell XPS 15 with configuration as follows : Intel Core i3 2.2 GHz processor 500 GB Hard Drive 4 GB RAM I need to keep moving most of the time so I would prefer a portable external hard disk with great transfer speed. </s>
<s> And I prefer USB 3.0 compatible drives only. </s>
<s> Is that a right thing to do ? </s>
<s> Keeping above mentioned aspects in mind suggest me some good external hard drives. </s>
<s> I am not a frequent buyer so I would like it to last for some couple of years. </s>
<s> Thank you for helping in advance </s>
<s> usb3 would certainly be better than usb2 if your computer has usb3 port. </s>
<s> Otherwise external usb3 Hdd. </s>
<s> won't give you much advantages. </s>
<s> But if the price were the same then usb3 is the one to get. </s>
<s> I have just picked up a 750G tanscend (Storejet 25M3) for $70 U.S. on sale. </s>
<s> I am pretty sure you might be able to get a 500G at that price that's not on sale. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
