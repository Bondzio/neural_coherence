I Installed a new Motherboard in a system with a 2.0 ghz p4 running WinXP SP2.
Now when I try to boot the system, it continually comes to the screen asking for boot type; Start normally, Safe Mode, Last known good config, etc.
No matter which option I choose, the system restarts and returns to this screen.
Any help will be greatly appreciated Thanks....JediChef
