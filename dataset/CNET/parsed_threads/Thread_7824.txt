<s> I have a Compaq Presario SR1000 and I am looking to upgrade the graphics card, but I have two questions about the one I am hoping to purchase. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Will it be able to fit in/work on my computer? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Will it be able to smoothly run games like CS:Source and Guild Wars. </s>
<s> I have already upgraded the RAM so that isn't a problem. </s>
<s> The graphics card is: NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GS 256MB DDR2 HDTV/DVI (PCI-Express) A link to it: http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_8400_features.html </s>
<s> That's not unique enough, maybe. </s>
<s> http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/ProductList.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=12454&prodSeriesId=402657&taskId=135 lists 5 different subtypes. </s>
<s> They have a lot of documentation on their site, but I couldn't easily find if it has the PCI-Express that's needed for the card you asked about. </s>
<s> Can you find something about available slots in the documentation that came with the PC? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I know that the card in my PC currently is a PCI-Express one, Would that suggest that it would fit? </s>
<s> Or is there more to it than that? </s>
<s> As for the games, can you post the system requirements for the video. </s>
<s> Google is generally a good way to find them. </s>
<s> A 8400, or course, isn't the hottest or the latest. </s>
