if i use a straight ff i have to check that my colors match on both sides.
do they?
i haven't referenced any web pages because they are plentiful.
i wanted to share the easiest thought possible.
here it is: pick up a factory made cable.
match the colors on one end and then maintain that throughout that cable run and end with the same as the factory cable at the other end.
if you have a coupler you have to be sure the colors match up proper.
