They are standard ATX now (not sure if they were before) so any ATX power supply will do. Go for one that is at least 400-450 watts with bare minimum 18A on the 12v+ for the video card (if its split up into multiple rails, usually the highest amperage is to the video card) and remember it MUST be PCI-Express and Serial ATA ready. I highly suggest a supply with 4 SATA connectors but 2 will work fine (unless you have 2 harddrives and/or 2 CD drives), if it is only 2 SATA on a single line, then you will need to flip the harddrive around so it will reach (meaning no more screws holding in the harddrive). Other than that, I managed to weasel in an 8800GT fairly easily, if you have two harddrives, you will have to temporarily remove the second one (labelled HDD1) and you WILL have to buy a 4 SATA PSU (usually 550 watts or more)
