I thought it was the power supply at first after updating nvidia drivers, but I decided to try msi's kombustor benchmark software and ran the fuzzy and furry stress test.
My pc did not shut off for the whole 10 minutes I ran it while my graphics card was under 100% load and 101% power draw.
This threw me off completely and now I don't know what is going on.
This didn't start happening until I reinstalled bf3 and punkbuster.
(PB is for connecting to servers in bf3) I also would like to add that updating my nvidia drivers only made it shut off instantly when graphics were loaded instead of a few minutes after.
I have had the same setup for about 4-5months and I have never had this problem until now.
