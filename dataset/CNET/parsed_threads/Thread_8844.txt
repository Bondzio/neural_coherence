<s> I have a La Fonera router that can broadcast the SSIDs, but can't broadcast the internet connection from our main computer. </s>
<s> I'm trying to broadcast an internet signal to 2 laptops and a Nintendo Wii. </s>
<s> Any help? </s>
<s> &quot;can't broadcast the internet connection from our main computer.&quot; That's not a standard setup so it's unlikely to work. </s>
<s> Try the more standard of broadcasting your internet connection from the internet connection and not from your main computer. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have the router hooked up to the RCA DCM425 cable modem if that helps. </s>
<s> Maybe a rewrite is in order? </s>
<s> Also make, model, firmware versions, age of all parts involved. </s>
<s> A short story might help too. </s>
<s> One owner had switched from DSL so I was able to spot the issue. </s>
<s> They forgot to uninstall the former DSL PPPoE software. </s>

<s> Bob The main computer that I'm on is connected by ethernet to the modem and the router is connected to the cable modem as well. </s>
<s> The main computer is a 3 year old eMachines T2958 Windows XP sp2. </s>
<s> The laptops are both Gateway. </s>
<s> One is the CX2620 and the other is the MX6931, both running Windows XP SP2. </s>
<s> We also have a Wii that can sense the SSIDs as well. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Need any more info? </s>
<s> &quot;The main computer that I'm on is connected by ethernet to the modem and the router is connected to the cable modem as well.&quot; You have revealed a key item here but no make/model of the cable modem or router. </s>
<s> What I suspect is that this setup is incorrect in some way but without make and model numbers I can't supply a working solution. </s>
<s> Your choice to tell all or none when asked. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry bout that. </s>
<s> The Fonera model is FON 2100 A/B/C. </s>
<s> It's this small, light router with 1 ethernet cable slot. </s>
<s> I'm sad to say that I can't solve it given the setup so far. </s>
<s> Was I unclear about the questions? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Do you know of where you could point me that would have more info on what I need help with? </s>
<s> I messed up in that I asked for all the parts involved and you doled them out over different replies so it's more work for me to piece together the setup. </s>
<s> RCA DCM425 is your Cable modem. </s>
<s> It has no router or other features. </s>
<s> The FON 2100 A/B/C is your router. </s>
<s> It appears to be quite rare so you'll have to find the manual for me. </s>
<s> Let's repeat where I see a problem. </s>
<s> &quot;The main computer that I'm on is connected by ethernet to the modem and the router is connected to the cable modem as well.&quot; That's an incorrect setup. </s>
<s> If I were to set this up I do this. </s>
<s> Cable modem to Router. </s>
<s> All PCs and other things connect to the router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.fon.com/en/download&quot; &gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; </s>
<s> I read it twice and you don't have a valid setup. </s>
<s> That is, the Fon device appears to not be a ROUTER. </s>
<s> You don't have a router so you have all but one internet IP address and without a router this device is only good for &quot;not much.&quot; When you get a router, please write back since I've subscribed to this discussion. </s>
<s> The proper setup is noted in section B1 and other places which is... DSL/CABLE MODEM -&gt; Router -&gt; PCs and your Fon device. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If it helps, I have a D-Link DI-524 router that I've been having trouble installing and having problems just broadcasting an SSID. </s>
<s> The 524 was nearly tossed in the trash the first week I had it. </s>
<s> Thankfully new firmware cured that issue you wrote about. </s>
<s> HOWEVER !!! </s>
<s> You don't need to fix that if you were to follow the instructions FON supplied. </s>
<s> But why not fix it? </s>
<s> Tell me which version of 524 you have? </s>
<s> A, D, C, OR E? </s>
<s> http://www.dlink.com/products/support.asp?pid=316&sec=0#firmware Bob </s>
<s> Version A </s>
<s> We've spent a lot of back and forths that we could have avoided. </s>
<s> Please move forward on your own to tell if your firmware is the latest and if not, please tell me why you didn't. </s>
<s> If you have old firmware, write when you'll be replacing this router since I know that as supplied it's a dud. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Remote desktop assistance, email, or IM? </s>
<s> There is a chance you didn't ask me if such would work but given the short number of words it's up to anyone to guess the real question. </s>
<s> -&gt; It took awhile but at the end I see you are oh so close. </s>

<s> I'm having a problem with the Window Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing service. </s>
<s> I was trying to install the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter on the desktop and every time I do, I either get an error (5) or an error (6) message. </s>
<s> Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter depends on the service and I'm also guessing the D-Link router. </s>
<s> When I try to start the Windows Firewall service, which the Wi-Fi adapter depends on, it gives me &quot;Error 5: Access is Denied&quot; message. </s>
<s> I found out from here that I have a lot of stuff missing from the protocols section when I look at it in the msinfo32 console when I compared it to my laptop. </s>
<s> However, when I installed it on the laptop, it installed fine, no problems, worked mucho bella. </s>
<s> I tried to do what it said in this article too to no avail. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> I got a FON router when they had their 5$/Euro promotion. </s>
<s> Strung it into an old D-Link 614+ 802.11b router - into the non-firewalled port designed for a server (good enough for my DSL speed). </s>
<s> The public ssid works fine, but I can't connect to the private ssid with my PSP (it also hates my D-Link - and throughput is brutally slow - reminiscent of dialup) I've been thinking about a Wii, but expect it to also hate my D-Link ...and now I'm pessimistic about how well it will play with the FON, given this and many other posts I've searched. </s>
<s> I found out the problem lies in the Windows Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing service. </s>
<s> It's only affecting our desktop, but due to some nasty viruses we've had last year and this year, there's a lot of protocols missing when I look in the msinfo32 console when I click on Network and then Protocols. </s>
<s> There should be a lot more than the current 4 I see, when I checked it against my laptop. </s>
<s> So is there any way to restore all the protocols? </s>
<s> BTW, when I hooked the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter into my laptop, it worked fine with the Wii and both DS' we have. </s>
<s> Also if you want, I can give you a screenshot of the desktop's msinfo32 information I've been talking about. </s>
<s> I actually cannot find an english firmware anywhere for my DI-524. </s>
<s> It has hardware version B2 and it has the German version of Firmware 2.02 on it... the only problem is I dont speak German and so I cant set it up the way I would like it. </s>
<s> (the only reason I bought it is I am stationed in Germany and it is one of the only ones I can get my hands on). </s>
<s> I tried the UK D-link site but apparently it no longer exists... any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Sorry, there is no English version I know of. </s>
