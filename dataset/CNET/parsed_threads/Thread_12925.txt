<s> Since the nForce 680i SLI NVIDIA Socket 775 ATX Motherboard has 3 pci express slots does that mean you can put a third graphics card in your computer or is it for something else? </s>
<s> Those may be too sluggish for video cards but if you look around you find other cards such as serial and parallel port cards that go there. </s>

<s> There are newer motherboards with three PCI Express X16 slots. </s>
<s> Even though all will fit an X16 sized card or smaller, it's common for at least one of the slots to be less than X16 electrically. </s>
<s> That means that you could install an X16 card into the bottom X16 slot, but it will operate with a maximum of, say, X8 or X4 bandwidth (depending on how the slot is wired). </s>
<s> Check the motherboard's specifications and manual to learn what the types of slots you have. </s>
