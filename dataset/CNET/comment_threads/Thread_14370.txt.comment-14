If you can, please tell me what kind of chipset you have.
Like the others mentioned, go to http://www.crucial.com to find out what kind of memory is compatible with your system and the maximum amount your motherboard can take.
I run an old Athlon T-Bird Slot A @ 850mhz, and it only takes 768MB of PC100 SDRAM, but it ONLY took the low density type.
Higher density RAM (that can take 512MB or more) would only be seen by my computer as 128MB, even if it was double that.
If your motherboard can take up to 512MB, you might have to remove the first memory stick your originally had (hey, why don't you sell it for a little cash to someone who needs more memory for their basic computer?).
Chances are, if your motherboard only has 3 slots, it may only go to 384MB (possibly 512MB).
When you find out if you can run more than 512MB, be sure to check out these links for some workarounds.
