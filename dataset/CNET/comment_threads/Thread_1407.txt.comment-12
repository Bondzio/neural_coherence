Mostly when we install the Intel Accelerator software but that's for Intel based boards.
Or when we use odd RAID or other controllers.
For those I have to ask the maker for guidance to find where they moved the DMA tab.
The issue is not simple.
XP will degrade the DMA from say 5 to 0 and not tell the owner.
Read http://www.blackmaxpc.com/Guides/Enable_DMA.htm for more pictures to see where this setting is.
