when it comes to motherboard and naming conventions i get confused.
the site read &quot;expansion capabilities - two pci conventional* bus connectors - one pci express* x1 bus add-in card connector &quot; but only after you said about x1 slot and x1 card my confusion ends.
thanks bob for the super-quick response
