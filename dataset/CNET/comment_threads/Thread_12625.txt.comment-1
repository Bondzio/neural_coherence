A new SB eax 5.1 surround sound card installed on Intel Pentium III using D:/win XP but multiboot C:/win98SE can't read the installation cd-rom reporting no drivers found at G:/cd-rom drive.
D:/win XP shows the disk as formatted using CDFS (CDFS not equal to NTFS?).
XP has integrated SIS 7018 audio/video driver as central controller; if uninstall driver then no video?
There are other codecs also present on HDD device manager and these were reported to 'creative labs' with registration of product e-mail.
I have no sound and even if driverguide.com has a download in the right format I think system sounds will be absent.
Any replies from the senate please forum members?
