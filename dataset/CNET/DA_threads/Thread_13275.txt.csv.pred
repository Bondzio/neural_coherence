1.1.1	Here 's my situation .	St
1.1.2	Small business running a Windows 2000 server with 8 clients .	St
1.1.3	Server is the PDC and acts as a file server ( everone stores most of their files on the server ) and also acts as an FTP server .	St
1.1.4	The FTP server traffic is sporadic , but sometimes we use it to transfer some rather large files .	St
1.1.5	The server also acts as an App server for 1 application .	St
1.1.6	Right now we 're on a 10/100 network ( all computers connect at 100 ) with 2 switches ( have to have 2 because of the way the wall outlets are situated ) all behind a DSL router .	St
1.1.7	I 'm wondering if it would make a noticeable difference if I upgrade the network to a Gigabit network .	St
1.1.8	It would cost about $ 675 for the new cards and switches and labor .	St
1.1.9	We already have cat 5e cabling .	St
1.1.10	The network does n't really run under a heavy load , but I do transfer some large files over the network in my every day work and I was thinking that might speed up .	St
1.1.11	Any thoughts or experience in the matter ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks !	St
1.1.13	Matt	St
1.2.1	Consider coax .	St
1.2.2	It has a higher bandwidth than 5E .	St
