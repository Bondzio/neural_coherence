The adaptec Raid controller lets me use the drive as a hotspare, but warns that as it's smalller that the array, some of my data could be at risk. so... if i partion the Raid 1 array so that it's only using the first 146GB of the drives as logical drives for storage... then does that me all will be ok in the event of one drive failing... as (theoretically) there wont be any data on the remaining area of the array that's larger than the hot spare??? (also.... should i have the write cache enabled on the array or not??) thanks in advance... Michael.

I believe that if you wanted you could actually use that extra 8GB as storage; but that is dependent on the controller and I dont know which adaptec you're using. Once again; yes, if you repartition your 154GB array to 146GB and use your 3rd HDD as a hotspare; it will work! Write-Cache is a feature that will enable you to get better performance from your drives; once again, how this works is dependent on your controller, but for the most part it is based in the controllers RAM. What it does is it stores the read write operations for the disks in the RAM until it can more effeciently do that operation. Hence; if you want better performance off your RAID; I assume you do, then go ahead and enable it.

I see it as.... Will I lose files? My answer is about this. Still dumb? Only if the owner/operator runs without a backup. Bob
