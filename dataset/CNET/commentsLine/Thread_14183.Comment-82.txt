when i was in college, we simulated (we wrote a 100,000 line fortran program) the burroughs e103.
it was the first &quot;desk&quot; computer.
it was the desk.
it was programmed by putting metal keys through holes to make connections.
we ran the simulations on a xerox sigma 7. not sure this computer had a hundreth of the compute power this laptop has and we had 100+ students compiling fortran and pascal programs on it simultaneously.
my first 'bought' computer was a compaq 'portable' (probably weighed in at over 40 lbs).
had 256k of memory, 10meg (wow, who would ever need this much space!)
hard disk and a black and white cathode-ray screen built in.
put a 1200baud modem in it.
whole thing cost almost $6,000.
i remember paying for it with a car loan...
