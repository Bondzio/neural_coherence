Find a way to bend the contact to make a firm contact. To test, simply hold it down with your finger to see if the systems boots.

It is a 3 volt battery and the old one read .4 volts. Battery is properly installed. Now I get a message &quot;CMOS checksum bad&quot; Press F1 to run setup Press F2 to load default values and continue_ Pressing F1 or F2 has no effect on the screen/system

4046	7	42791	502291	502270	Ray Harinec	10/27/04 4:05 PM	1.0988931E12	Never heard of the potential of a dead	battery increasing. It would seem to defy the electro chemical properties that establish the potential.

The new battery is a 3 volt battery that reads 3 volts. Prior to replacing the battery the PC would not display anything on the monitor. Nor it appears that the BIOS is lost. Forget the battery !
