You want a spacious, but not overlarge case.
Do you want something flashy, or more elegant or a mix?
For a PSU, though it may be just a tad overkill: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817153029 This is my personal fav.
for a case with a power supply http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144004 But you would be a little better off buying each component seperately as combos usually yield lower quality in one part or another.
This is my favorite case: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811133133 But these are just my choices.
Try this page for some good case ideas: http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/SubCategory.asp?SubCategory=7 For the better quality cases, don't get a PSU, side windows always look cool, look for with CPU ducts on side or back, make sure there is enough room for expansion and current parts, and make sure it suits you!
On the motherboard, so are you going to AGP or using the x800 on PCI-e?
Do they make a x800, of that card, in AGP?
Wanting to clarify: IDE is P ATA, correct?
This is a wicked deal, if IDE is actually P ATA: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131530R Just my $.02 ~Ibrahim~
