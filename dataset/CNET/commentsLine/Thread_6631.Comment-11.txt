i also installed a video card on the s3220n.
i got the evga 8400gs.
it was a standard video card but i unscrewed the bracket, took the vga port from it and used a low profile bracket instead.
i am not using the tv tuner though, so i took it from the pc since it would allow more room for the video card.
(video card's fan was too close to the tv tuner) so far i havent had any problems.
been playing cod4, gears of wars and bioshock without any problems.
