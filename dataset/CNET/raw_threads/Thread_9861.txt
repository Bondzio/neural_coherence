I tend to think that MS has the best ones, but I could be wrong. Are the wireless ones reliable? Always been sceptic to the wireless series, no matter what it is, but they might improve. I want an ergonomic board. Let me know what your opinion is, please.

Logitech Logitech Cordless Desktop EX100 Black 102 Normal Keys 7 Function Keys PS/2 Wireless Type Standard Keyboard Mouse Included costs $38. Get that or spend a couple more bucks, a figure of speech for a LX700. Roger

The batteries fail and cause service calls to the tune of 100's of dollars for some consumers. Microsoft's units are nice and the drivers while not stellar didn't lock up machines like the Logitech drivers. I give the nod to Microsoft on this one just because of Logitech's gaffe plus their arrogance in hiding the solution to the issue on their web site. What is their problem? Bob
