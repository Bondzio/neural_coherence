<s> Hi, A few weeks since I wrote about this issue about ATI Catalyst Control Center warning, a dire consequences, if I do not switch off. </s>
<s> A couple of warning messages used to appear one after the other every time I started my PC. </s>
<s> I had put a new graphics card, Radeon X1300 in my computer. </s>
<s> It worked very well for a considerable time, say 6 months, and then the warnings started. </s>
<s> I clicked it off and carried on with my work. </s>
<s> It was a bit of a nuisance every time I switched on my PC,but not a great hinderance. </s>
<s> The Cnet guru, for whom I have enormous respect, informed me that there is no known solution to the issue I am experiencing: I followed his advice: change the card or put up with it. </s>
<s> I decided to put up with it. </s>
<s> It is about three months down the road and this behaviour stopped as suddenly as it started. </s>
<s> It is no great discovery nor have I any notion of the solution. </s>
<s> I thought, I had better report this observation. </s>
<s> It might make some sense to someone with greater knowledge of the computer world. </s>

<s> I've run into the x1300 cards and we can't endure long hours trying to save such things. </s>
<s> We find the owners will never pay up for hours of reinstalling the OS, trying driver versions or even for our service of getting the card replaced under warranty (which gets you a new card but does not pay for shop fees.) </s>
<s> 99 percent of the time they OK a new card and the troubles along with the old card go away. </s>
<s> All I can do is share the experiences so others can take it for what it is or decide to try drivers, heatsink compound and luck. </s>
