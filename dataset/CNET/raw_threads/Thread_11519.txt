However, my primary disk drive does not work. I have a CD-RW attached to my computer by USB. If I format my hard drive, will my CD-RW work (since the drivers will presumably be erased)? If so, can I make my computer read my CD-RW instead of my non-functional primary disk drive, so that I can use it to install Windows 98? Thanks in advance, Scott
