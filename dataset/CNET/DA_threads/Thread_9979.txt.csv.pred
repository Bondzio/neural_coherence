1.1.1	I bought an APC UPS for my desktop , but do n't have a grounded outlet to plug it into.Does not having a grounded outlet affect the UPS as far as protection to my equipment goes ?	Ques
1.1.2	I can put up with the little red light that indicates & quot ; building wiring fault & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	For some reason , APC says it 's warranty is void if I do n't use a grounded outlet .	St
1.2.1	Not to question your reasoning but it would work but given what 's at stake why would anyone risk this ?	Ques
1.2.2	I only run into no-ground outlets when the owner has fried a few thousand bucks of gear .	St
1.2.3	One of them thought an UPS could save their hardware .	St
1.2.4	Get that fixed !	St

1.3.1	I have booked an electrician to install a grounded outlet.I was only wondering if the UPS plugged into a non-grounded outlet would protect against voltage/lightning spikes , as well as the occasional power failure .	St
1.4.1	Protection ?	Ques
1.4.2	Unlikely .	St
1.4.3	Provide AC for awhile .	St
1.4.4	Yup .	St
1.5.1	Well , I unplugged the UPS , and it started beeping , but the computer is still running normally , so at least I have power failure protection until I get the outlet grounded .	St
