While I wouldn't expect an USB device to push it over the edge that's mightly slim.
What happens if you use a powered USB hub?
And I did run into an issue with my PalmOne TX.
It would garble data when I used an extension cable and cause problems.
Connect it directly to the USB port without a cable or only the cable supplied with the player.
