thanks for the input.
i neglected to mention that the hd was in a sata usb enclosure.
i took a look at the software you suggested but i couldn't find where it supported usb devices.
however your suggestion that i try a partition software reminded me that years ago i had added an additional western digital hd to my system and that it had come with a cd containing some set up tools.
the program is called 'data lifeguard tools' and one of the options allows me to partition / format a hd on a usb port.
it worked smooth as silk.
i am currently moving some files to it.
i will eventually add it to my wireless network using a belkin wireless usb hub.
this will allow all of the computers on the network to access it and use it as a file storage / transfer device.
again thanks for the input.
