Re the &quot;Tip&quot; notice just above the &quot;Subject title:&quot;, asking when you post to include all the necessary info (ie.
operating system, model number, etc...) What is the brand name and model number of your computer?
Also what motherboard or chipset?
If you don't know... can get from Belarc.
Perhaps you may or may not have an AGP slot, and if you do have an AGP slot, you purchased an PCI video card instead of an AGP card.
