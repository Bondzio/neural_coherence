i purchased a hp media center pc, with integrated graphics.
i was shopping for its processor (pentium d 3.4g)mainly as they were cheap at the time as the core duo just came out.
its' on board graphics were ok, but i knew if i wanted to game , a new card would be required.
i added this into my budget before i bought.
hp is a little odd with the hard drive access, but there should be an open slot for a new video card.
in my case i added a video card and a tv tuner card as well.
just check the specs for the motherboard, and look it up.
you will easily be able to find a picture on line.
then its pretty much unscrew 2 srews, insert card, re screw, load drivers, turn off old video in task manager.
30 min max.
good luck
