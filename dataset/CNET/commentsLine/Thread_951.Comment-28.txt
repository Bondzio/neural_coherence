go ntfs, hands down.
unlike fat32, ntfs can handle file sizes - and transfers - in excess of 4 gb and has many other advanced storage options that are impossible with ntfs.
just bear in mind that any ntfs formatted hard drive will be pretty much incompatible with any operating system other than windows 2000 or higher.
