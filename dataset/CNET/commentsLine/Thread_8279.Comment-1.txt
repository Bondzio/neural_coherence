my new system i built has a shuttle an35n ultra 400 system board with an amd 2400+ processor, 2 gig speed.
after getting it running i noticed in device manager the processor was shown as amd 1800+ with a 1.4 gig processor.
after a phone call to the store where i bought it i changed the fsb from 100 mhz to 133 mhz, and the listing went to 2400+, speed 2.0 gig.
now it's showing correctly, running like a top.
can overclocking be this simple?
change the fsb speed?
not that i want to experiment, but if the fsb speed is increased, will the processor speed increase?
i do have more options.
thanks.
