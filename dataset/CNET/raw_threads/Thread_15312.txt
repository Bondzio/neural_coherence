I've got a list of the parts I want and I think all is well, but before I buy everything I'd really like someone who has done this before to look over my wishlist and let me know if i'm forgetting anything or making an obvious mistake. Could anyone help me out? Thanks in advance! Nico

See some of the other post re proposed parts list. They should identify the component name, the price and a link to the product. VAPCMD
