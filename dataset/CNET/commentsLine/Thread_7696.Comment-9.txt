i have an hp thats 8 months old and lost my restore disk( that i originally had to make) in a catastrophic weather event.
i had to reformat recently due to virus.
lost the &quot;secret partition doing that.
cannot get a replacement and restore disk from hp.
computer still in warranty.
they will not help me.
have previously had very good service from hp but this time they will not help.
on line ordering says disk not available.
why is this and the box is only 8 months old!!!
i am so upset that i purposely went out and searched for a new computer with an o/s disk.
1-800/888 tech support people tell me that they can't order the disk for me because they are out of it.
online ordering says they are out of it.
the great sales dept says to contact the 1-800/888 support folks.
the complaint dept says the same.
so i went out and bought a toshiba laptop with an o/s disk and other restoration disk furnished with the computer.
screw hp!.
they are as bad as lexar products.
