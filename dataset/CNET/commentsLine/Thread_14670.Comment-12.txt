after reading the debate with interest, i decided to go the software download route.
i downloaded and ran sensorsview and it reports a high cpu temperature between 78-85c (not sure what it should normally be).
so now is the time for the application of thermal paste?
or a new fan?
or a new cpu altogether?
help greatly appreciated.
