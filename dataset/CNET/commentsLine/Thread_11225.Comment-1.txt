host win98se with hp deskjet 932c, ics and file/printer sharing enabled.
host to linksys switch, switch to wap (buffalo airstation wla-l11g), wap to wireless notebook xp pro.
using ics and file/printer sharing due to nature of satellite internet connection which has usb modem and requires said modem to be plugged directly to host computer running the direcway software, so switching to a router is not an option at this time.
no problem accessing shared printer.
i can send a 467kb jpeg saved on notebook harddrive to printer in a few seconds.
i can copy and paste same image to host drive in a few seconds.
i can save a webpage with images in a folder on notebook hardrive, and send folder (80kb) to host in a few seconds.
so sending files to the printer is fast.
sending files to the host drive is fast.
but when browsing the web on notebook and click to print the current webpage, it takes 5-10 minutes to send the page to the printer.
saving the page to harddrive, then opening saved web page and click to print does the same thing.
what am i missing here that causes this?
