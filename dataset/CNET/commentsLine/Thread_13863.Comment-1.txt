my cousin sent me this computer he was building to me so i can try to fix it.
i redid all the partition on the hard drive and was able to install windows xp.
however, when its about to load, the screen goes blank recieving no signal or it glitches.
the monitor is hooked up to an ati radeon car.
im thinking its drivers issue but how am i suppose to install the drivers?
i am able to go into safe mode.
any ideas on what to do?
