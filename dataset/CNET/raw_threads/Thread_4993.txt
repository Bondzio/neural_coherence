Hi I'm looking to set up a network drive for my small business at home .I now have 3 PC's and am using a Netgear router but need to access information using all three. Two PC's run Win 7 and one Win 8. I want to know a good network drive to use (not too pricey) and how to set it up. Thanks for your help

USB 2.0 500GB drive and put it on the router. I was done and for not much. Of course you would have a few other copies of what's there for the usual reasons. Bob
