The two old drives are both western digital, the new one is a seagate. Whats the easiest way to transfer data between the old and new hardrives? Both the old and new systems are or will be running XP Pro. Can I install XP on the new system using the XP disc that was installed on the old one, without running into licensing problems? Or would I be better off installing a fresh XP disc on the new system? The data I want to transfer is saved games for the kids, pictures, and videos. Thanks for any help.

They're set in the registry and just will not move. Other stuff can be moved by putting the old drives either: As a slave drive in the new machine By putting the drives into an external USB2 case Once XP is installed in a machine it cannot be installed into another machine. Remember the &quot;Activation&quot; step?

Games being re-installed and just the saved progress folders being substituted, and trying to direct transfer other files from one HD to another. A new XP disk is already on the way also. I'm glad to know I'm on the right track.
