Hi A question for the forum I've set up my network based on the recommendations of the salesman at the store.
He suggested that I go with the Lynksys WRT54GS with speedbooster.
My network is set up with 2 desktop computers and my sons X-box hardwired into the router, with another desktop and a laptop with wireless cards.
I don't know enough about wireless technology ( wireless G, wireless N ) to know if there would be a difference in response time from the router to the individual devices.
My son occassionally complains about lag time with his X-box live, and I notice a huge difference between the desktop that is 3 feet from the router, and the other which is @ 80 feet away.
I would like to stay with Lynksys, as I find that this seems to work best in my neighborhood with my internet provider.
Any insight would be helpful.
Thanks Dennis
