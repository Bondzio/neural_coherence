1.1.1	I've got this old dell pc with the following specs Win XP sp3 P II 231 Mhz 396 MB Ram.	St
1.1.2	I have a SATA hard drive that I need to be able to read using this old dell.	St
1.1.3	Except that it doesn't have a sata wiring.	St
1.1.4	Someone said to me to get an IDE/SATA controller card.	St
1.1.5	There are several available that I've noticed on newegg and just about all have very bad reviews.	St
1.1.6	Not to mention the fact this is an older PC, I am really asking for trouble?	St
1.1.7	This hard drive that I'm speaking of has some data that I need but something happened to it and it boots into the blue screen of death.	St
1.1.8	I ran the diagnostic routine and it told me the disk is bad, which I know is not really the case; I think only the boot sector is gone bad.	St
1.1.9	So anyway, a local PC shop wanted 130 bucks to retrieve my data, I said, are you kidding?	St
1.1.10	I guess they have to make a living and people who don't know any better will pay.	St
1.1.11	Where was I, oh yeah...	St
1.1.12	Anyone has experience with a similar configuration and why are all these SATA controller so funk prone?	St
1.1.13	Thank, Risho.	St
1.2.1	Would be to buy an external enclosure to put the drive into.	St
1.2.2	Assuming your old Dell has USB, they will probably be 1.1 instead of 2.0 which will make it slower.	St
1.2.3	That PC is pretty old.	St
1.2.4	I would possibly expect it to not have PCI but ISA slots which would further complicate a SATA adapter.	St
1.3.1	a damaaged boot sector can be fixed with a reformat, but if the diagnostics say the drive is bad they are detecting a hardware issue and the drive is close to toast.	St
1.3.2	here's a cheap sata-to-ide adapter: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CX-STI1001&cpc=SCH no drivers will be necessary.	St
1.3.3	if the pc has usb, consider this case: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SIL-35U2-SATA&cat=CSE if you want a controller, here's another inexpensive choice but you'll have to install drivers.	St
1.3.4	http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CL-SL3114&cat=CCD as for newegg's customer reviews, you'll find many folks complaining because they didn't know what they were getting.	St
1.3.5	&quot;it won't work with my 1TB drive; the drivers are buggy; it won't work with this drive, it's slow&quot; etc.	St
1.3.6	adding new tech to an old pc can be a challenge.	St
