so i'd have to either get the dual proc 4600 or 4800 to match the current sing proc 4000. and getting the dual 4200 would't be enough to see a difference.
so i'm pretty much stuck with my current cpu.
i was trying to hold out on the major upgrade.
i'd love a x2 4800 but prices are outrageous!
$350 plus!
