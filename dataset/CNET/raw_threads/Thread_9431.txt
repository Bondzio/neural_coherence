So temperature is not an issue. Plus this happens the moment I get into the game, so there is a very small window for my GPU to reach overheated temps, which I don't think is happening. I really can't find anyone else who has had this exact problem in my video before. Highly frustrating!

This is one of those times. There is one issue I encounter too often. That is, those that overclock usually can't be helped. It may upset a few but that's going out on a limb. Few will join you. Bob
