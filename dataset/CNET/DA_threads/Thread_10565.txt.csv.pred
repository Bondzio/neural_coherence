1.1.1	I have a nick in the protective coding on my monitor 's screen .	St
1.1.2	Its in a really annoying place and often inturrupts my work .	St
1.1.3	The screen is a Mitusbishi Diamond Pro 900u .	St
1.1.4	Is there a way to fix this ?	Ques
1.1.5	I know there is a type of chemical you can drop on the casing that turns a small area of plastic into a moldable clay-like material that later hardens as it dries , and products that repair cd 's using a chemical .	St
1.1.6	There must be something I can buy that can fix this .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone know of such a product ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance , Dave	St
1.2.1	You can find such at automotive repair part places .	St
1.2.2	But it 's YMMV if you 'll be happy .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Still , I do n't know what Im looking for , and those sales people who work at those places can never answer anything but very simple questions like & quot ; What brands of tires do you carry ? & quot ; , at least thats what its like here .	St
1.3.2	What would I be looking for ?	Ques
1.3.3	Keep in mind , this is n't glass Im repairing , this is a laminate like protective coating on the glass .	St
1.3.4	Ive seen those glass repair kits , and those do n't hide damage , they just seal it and keep cracks from spreading , which is n't my problem .	St
1.3.5	Also , how unsure are you about this advice ?	Ques
1.3.6	( & quot ; ymmv & quot ; )	St
1.4.1	The goop is as you suspect .	St
1.4.2	It will not hide the problem and the visual aspect may still be noticeable .	St
1.4.3	There 's no magic here .	St
1.4.4	It 's optics ... Let me dive off into optics for a second and use Google if a phrase sounds foriegn .	St
1.4.5	The refraction index of the repair material will not match the underlying material .	St
1.4.6	As there is n't a match , the repair will not be perfect .	St
1.4.7	But it could be better than no repair .	St
1.4.8	I offer this suggestion with the best intent and if you expect a perfect repair , you 'll have to keep looking .	St
1.4.9	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
1.5.1	Hi Dave , I 've just read your email re : scratch on your Diamond Pro 900 .	St
1.5.2	I 've got a Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 with the same problem - an annoying little dent on the screen surface .	St
1.5.3	What 's needed is something which dries in the dent to the same refractive index as the surrounding surface material .	St
