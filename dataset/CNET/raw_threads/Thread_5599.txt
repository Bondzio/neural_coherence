MEMORY INFORMATION: Memory Advisor Tool on Crucial.com MOTHERBOARD INFORMATION: http://www.emachineupgraders.info GENERAL SYSTEM INFORMATION: Belarc Advisor (Download.com) Looks like you can add a PCI Express X16 video card to that motherboard, but you probably will have to upgrade the PSU if your video card is a good one.
