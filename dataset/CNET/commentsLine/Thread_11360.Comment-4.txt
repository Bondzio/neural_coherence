gaming will eventually move to multicore optimization.
as of now we are going to witness a shift from the lga 775 platform to the lga 1366 platform from intel.
so for a system that is futureproof for 2-3 years a quad core will be good but too expensive (the qx series 9650&9770 are very fast but still do not justify their prices which are around $700-1000).
a fast core2duo is a good option for about a year or 2. the ram should be 4gb then gaming under vista will not be an issue.
similarly the graphics card is equally important, your choice of the gtx 260 is good.
if you're thinking of sli i'd suggest you go for a higher psu say 800w.
ddr3 system memory is still too costly to be an option
