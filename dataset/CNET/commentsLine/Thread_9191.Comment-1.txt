i am a high school student looking for a new laptop.
i dabble in photo and video, but i am into music and use itunes a lot.
i want to be able to connect to wireless internet easily.
i currently own a dell and am not too happy with it.
i prefer the design of a mac but am worried about compatability.
anything would be a help.
thanks.
