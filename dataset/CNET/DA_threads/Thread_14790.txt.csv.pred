1.1.1	I 'm a student and I spend about 80 % of my time in a lab at school where I have my own personal computer and where it tends to get extremely loud .	St
1.1.2	I know I can just go out and buy any earphone for under 100 $ and just crank up the volume until my brain is deteriorated by the bass vibrations and I start to drool all over myself , but I consider myself to have a pretty good ear and would like to keep it that way .	St
1.1.3	So now my question is , are there earphone out there ( preferably in-ear but not restricted to ) that can completely block out outside noise , like people not understanding that a 3 to 4 feet of air in between two people does not block sound and yell at the top of their lungs ?	Ques
1.1.4	or if not what is the best noise cancellation ( active or passive ) earphone out there somebody can get , I know they can get pretty expensive but right now that 's not the main issue .	St
1.1.5	I just want to be able to concentrate on what I 'm doing and not hear people yell about whether they prefer tampons or pads and not damage my ear drumbs	St
1.2.1	you need to learn how to concentrate .	St
1.2.2	Or I might be wrong , maybe school are not like it use to be in my younger days ( tell me that 's not so ) .	St
1.2.3	But good luck in your search .	Polite
1.3.1	thank you for replying but , I 'm also an audiophile and like to listen to good quality music and I also need to be able to hear what I 'm doing for what I 'm studying so you 're comment was pretty much useless and insulting ... . thanks though !	St
1.4.1	Good question ; dumb answer , ahtoi .	Polite
1.4.2	I 've wondered about this myself : if I want 'noise-cancelling ' head/earphones , I want the really annoying noise cancelled , which is as often as not the very transient phenomena that 'cancellation ' handles poorly : apple/carrot snackers , far-ters , toe-tappers , finger drummers , drivel-talkers , knuckle-crackers , too-loud earphone brain-damaged music listeners .	St
1.4.3	I remember one reviewer saying some headphones worked great on a plane to cancel internal jet-noise , but there was a mysterious clicking/popping sound in the phones ; the passenger next to him was bopping along to some earphone music with mouth-click/pop accompaniment .	St
1.4.4	I gathered the plane noise would have been preferable masking of this idiocy than the useless 'cancellation ' : the most annoying noise was coming through front and center .	St
