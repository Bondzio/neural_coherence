I am presently using a laptop with the following configuration: WinXp(Sp1)(Os is in Japanese) Sharp PC-AL50g5/g7 Mobile AMD Athlon(tm) XP-M 1.66 ghz 224 mb ram The hard drive came partioned into c drive 10 GB d drive 50 GB What I wanted to do was take my old HD from my desktop, put it in an external case and the use it as storage etc.
The case I bought for it comes from a company called Corega(Japanese company, but made in Taiwan) and it claims to work for WinXP and uses both USB 2.0 and IEEE 1394.
When i got home I opened it up, followed the instructions of placing the HD into the case, put the jumper switch to master, plugged it all in, turned on the power and all seemed fine.
When I connected it to the computer though it didn't recognise it.
I have tried it with both usb and 1394 but it doesnt register on the machine.
Once it did but then it disappeared.
So any suggestions on where I might have gone wrong?
Thanks in advance.
