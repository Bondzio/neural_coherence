<s> First of all, if anyone can come up with a good build (will be used casual gaming, school, media, etc) for less than 550 dollars (No OS, no mouse/keybard/monitor), that would be nice... What is better? </s>
<s> Quad Core or Dual Core? </s>
<s> IF I buy a dual core to overclock(my friend has done it, I'm a pure nub) what should I get and how much should I overclock? </s>
<s> (Running on air) Exactly how fast would a 2.4 overclocked to 3 ghz dual core run? </s>
<s> how does it compare to a 3 overclocked to 3.5 ghz? </s>
<s> Are there possibly any releases in the near-future that would greatly affect the performance or price of cpus? </s>
<s> Please Answer the Questions... </s>
<s> Thanks A Lot!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> First, you need to ask these questions at an overclockers forum. </s>
<s> Not being rude but, those people will know exactly what you need. </s>
<s> Hmmm. </s>
<s> If you need something that will require a lot of CPU power, then go for the quad/double-dual core systems. </s>
<s> Go ask in a gaming forum about graphics cards. </s>
<s> Again, not being rude, just saying that they will know better than anyone here. </s>
