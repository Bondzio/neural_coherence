<s> Hello all, I recently made the mistake of disconnecting my external hard drive while it was still busy deleting a file. </s>
<s> When I plugged it back in it showed up under My Computer, but I cant access the drive. </s>
<s> I get an error that says You must format the disk before you can use it I tried to check the drive for errors, but it said the same thing again. </s>
<s> I have about 450gb of data that I cant afford to lose. </s>
<s> Is their some way around re-formatting? </s>
<s> Or is their away to format, but not lose any of my data? </s>
<s> Please help!! </s>
