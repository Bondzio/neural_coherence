1.4.4	So after a week and being frustrated from not being able to play SOCOM for PS3 (ONLINE ONLY GAME wtf) I just added a USB from modem to CPU (so I have two connections to CPU--MODEM) I will just try USB after work....But the PS3 shows the NETGEAR router at 47% to 55% signal strenghtjust can't get internet light to light up on Router....I change IP address from another thread I seen on CNET and still nothing.... You call COX and get &quot;We don't support NETGEAR&quot; and you call NETGEAR and you can here LOCAL TV stations saying it's 80 degrees here in Mumbai, India today...	St
1.5.1	&quot; I just added a USB from modem to CPU &quot; Almost all the COX and Comcast MTAs didn't include the feature to connect both USB and Ethernet.	St
1.5.2	What manual are you reading that says this would work?	St
1.6.1	I was trying anything...	St
1.6.2	I just added the USB and for some reason the &quot;Link&quot; or internet cable light stayed on.....Before that, when I followed the disk with the NETGEAR router it would cut off....I live in a small Louisiana town but I was able to find 3 computer fixer companies that will come out and take a look.	St
1.6.3	Since COX cable do not tech support NETGEAR...	St
