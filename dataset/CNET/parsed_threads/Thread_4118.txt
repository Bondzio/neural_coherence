<s> My buisness has 8 Hardwired computers, 2 wireless computers and a server to connect together. </s>
<s> Currently we have an 8 port Switch: Netgear G5608 and a Wireless access point: Netgear WG602 v3, to connect all together. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions for an update to these two? </s>
<s> I'm trying to combine it all into one, making it easier to maintain. </s>
<s> Modem -&gt; router -&gt; switch -&gt; computers. </s>
<s> The router must be in front of the switch as the router assigns IP addresses to each device. </s>
<s> The wireless devices communicate with the router. </s>
<s> Run the Network Setup Wizard on each machine and turn on File and Printer Sharing on all devices. </s>
<s> Assign a Network name to be used by all devices. </s>
<s> Use WPA(2) for your wireless security. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> From the description wouldn't simply getting a router with the necessary lan ports and a wireless capability be easier? </s>
<s> Then configure the router as a bridge/switch. </s>
<s> It sounds from the description as though the server is a DHCP server, and could also be a file server. </s>
<s> There isn't enough information yet to make a real suggestion. </s>
<s> We have a Modem -&gt; Coolpix Firewall -&gt; File/DHCP Server -&gt; Netgear G5608 Switch -&gt; Netgear WG602 v3 Access point Is there a Router with 8 ports and wireless? </s>
<s> After checking around, there doesn't seem to be any wired/wireless combination with 8 ports. </s>
<s> 5 ports yes, but none with 8. </s>
<s> You seem to have the optimal hardware setup. </s>
<s> Ok, Thanks. </s>
