3669	0	261422	2568680	NR	MiddleKnight	8/23/07 7:55 AM	1.1878557E12	Setup for Future	OK, I have decided to wait until the P38 motherboards come out before I customize a new computer. Here is what I am thinking of getting for current use to be capable of upgrading. quad 6600 p38 motherboard single 8800 gts 640 mb graphics card not sure what case to get I think a 650w powersupply would suffice no sound card I would like a media card reader and of course DVD-R/DVD most likely a 500 GB hard drive, I have read raptors are really only a few secs faster, so no need to spend extra for just a few secs If I am going to get only 1 graphics card, I see no reason to get a SLI or Crossfire mobo, correct? With the above generic hardward, what specific brands would you recommend? thanks

You are right, that I could go with the P35 as I am not intending to overclock at all. From the components I am looking at, what kind of case would you recommend? Would a Corsair 650w PSU be overkill or something I should consider?
