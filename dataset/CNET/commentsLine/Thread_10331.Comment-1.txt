i am thinking about upgrading from my 5-year old 19&quot; lcd monitor to something that would be better for both simple photo editing and also as my primary screen for watching dvd movies (no jokes please!).
is there any reason why i shouldn't choose a 26&quot; or 32&quot; lcd television instead of a pc monitor?
and would a graphics card do anything for me?
i am not a pc gamer but notice that dvd scenes with motion can look choppy on my current monitor and i am not sure if it is the monitor's fault or the pc's built-in graphics card.
thanks in advance.
