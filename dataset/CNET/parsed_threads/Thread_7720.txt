<s> I went through setup and internet works with any connect computer through direct connection. </s>
<s> Also, my Iphone and HTC Aria both connect to the router wirelessly but I cannot get my laptop or my parents computer to connect wirelessly. </s>
<s> I have tried allowing them through the router and it does not work. </s>
<s> The network is secured with a password and I am correctly typing the password in. </s>
<s> I do not understand how my phones can connect but not my laptop or computer? </s>
<s> I have updated the firmware on the router and everything works on it perfectly. </s>
<s> Any help would be nice. </s>
<s> P.S, This router is hooked up directly to a ATT Uverse Modem. </s>
<s> 3800HGV-V is what I have and I used the wifi in that. </s>
<s> To connect another router can be troublesome so let's have all the details. </s>
<s> For example one member had the new router set to channel 13 which is Non-US and many devices couldn't see it. </s>
<s> Another member hid the SSID! </s>

<s> Yeah, I use the wifi in the Uverse modem as well but I forgot to mention that I will be bringing this to college. </s>
<s> I will post information as soon as I get back from work. </s>
<s> The one I use is 3800HGV-B. </s>
<s> I am sure you need more info than that so just list what you need and I can find them. </s>
<s> Thanks for helping so far though! </s>
<s> It is appreciated </s>
<s> I will be leaving for an extended trip. </s>
<s> I know this is hard but I have to leave it to members to share the details. </s>
<s> If I had to interview and list all the required details very few could get fast fixes here. </s>
<s> Since it works with the Uverse my diagnosis is the setup is incorrect in the second wifi router. </s>
<s> We cover how to do that in post 18 or 19 in the Cnet Networking Forum. </s>
<s> It's not easy but not too hard. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I will look into it, thanks. </s>
