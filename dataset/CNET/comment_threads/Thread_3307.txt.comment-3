i also had the same concern with my HP Pavillion a 6500f not too long ago, and i decided it was time to get a replacement for my HD.
i bought a Western Digital RE3 WD5002ABYS-01B1B0 from Here it has been working wonders for me!
its a similar spec as the Samsung, but personally think WD is more reliable than Samsung's in the HD market.
