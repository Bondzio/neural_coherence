<s> Hello folks, I am not exactly clear on what kind of setup I should make, hence here is my situation and what ideal setup will look like. </s>
<s> Your expert comments on what will work best is welcome. </s>
<s> I have collected at least 5 USB HDDs ranging from 160GB to 2TB. </s>
<s> I hate to connect and disconnect all of them one after the other to my laptop and having a 3 year old at home makes me scared that he will topple the HDDs. </s>
<s> So I would like all these (or at least 2 of these with auto-power option) to be connected to network all the time for me to access. </s>
<s> I wonder if there is any device for cheap that I could hook up my external HDDs to. </s>
<s> I am no geek so a simple set up is appreciated. </s>
<s> If such device does not exist, I have 1TB internal HDD that I use on HDD dock. </s>
<s> I could place that one in a NAS enclosure. </s>
<s> I wonder if anyone has a recommendation for 'best bang for the buck' enclosure. </s>
<s> If you have any suggestion for another setup, I welcome the suggestion. </s>
<s> I checked old threads on this forum and devices suggested in those threads are not available anymore. </s>
<s> Hence this thread. </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance for all the suggestions and recommendations. </s>
