WorkStation= Intel D845gbvl / 2.6 P4 / XPpro / 1Gb ram-(Pc2700) Maxtor udma6(?)
hd, updated Nvidia drivers, etc.
performs video / gamer wise just like a 1.8 we also have.
PCpitstop benchmark says the Video is performing at 52% of the same card/CPU/memory on other systems.
Checked direct x ( 9b).
system runs ok, but checking video after processing seems very ordinary.
what steps might I check-redo-etc to get to normal levels?
?,TIA
