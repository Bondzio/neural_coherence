1.1.1	i have a dlink dir-615 connected to my modem, my main computer and my second computer (all wired) i have a wire that gos into my basement and i need a router (switch) down there, i have a dlink di-624 that i want to use but i need to configure it so it works with my existing router.	St
1.2.1	Hook up a lan port on both devices.	St
1.2.2	You may need to use a cross cable but try a straight first.	St
1.2.3	This will make your 624 a switch, you want to disable DHCP on the 624.	Sug
1.2.4	You may have to give it a static address in the range the 615 uses so you can manage it.	St
1.3.1	sorry, im a little new to this stuff, i disabled the dhcp on the 624 and i still didnt have internet acsees so i changed my wan settings from dynamic ip to static but i need a ip, subnet mask.	St
1.3.2	isp gateway, dns.	St
1.3.3	do i get these from the 615 or in ipconfig?	Ques
