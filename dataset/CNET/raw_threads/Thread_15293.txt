Also, which of the two is the most cost effective solution of the two options? I would also get a motherboard that would support either of the two because I am planning on building my own gaming machine.

Raid (Redundant Array of Independant Disks) was originally a security backup device using multiple identical hard drives. If one failed, all the data was still on one of the other drives. RAID 0 changes this a bit however. It takes 2 drives and creates a single drive. Not unlike dual-channel memory. It nearly double the rate that data can be both read and written. It requires a special controller that is either built into the motherboard, or can come as a seperate controller card.
