I am using A Compaq laptop with windows vista home basic SP1.
a day before I got a internet connection From BSNL.
They provided me with a wireless modem (UTStarcom).
The problem is that my latop is not recongnizing the modem via wireless.
After sometime I disabled the windows firewall, this I could connect via wireless.
When I tried to reconnect for the second time it didnt worked.The network authentication is done in WPA-PSK.
I am a little confused about configuring wireless in my laptop and setting the network authentication and SSID.
I tried out some of the solutions in the links but nothing helps for for my problem.
Hope anyone could help me..
