My extrenal drive is not working propertly	I would really appreciated your help..here is my specs: I have a WD passport usb portable hard drive:120Gb and my laptop is a Dell Inspiron E1705 (9400): HardDrive: 100Gb, serial ATA, RAM 1Gb RAM memory: 512 Mb Processor: intel core duo 1.73Hz Windows XP and the problem is: I bought the WD on january and it has been working fine (exc. for the occasional error: &quot;it can not be remove now, try later.&quot; I just waited a couple of seconds and remove it without problem). But today i was trying to cut/paste some files from my laptop to the WD. I pasted the 1ts one, but after that it gave an error saying: &quot;CANNOT COPY (put filename here) : THE DRIVE CANNOT FIND THE SECTOR REQUESTED&quot; i unplugged the WD and plug it in again... and happened the same, copy one file and then the error.... Even thus this is happening i`m able to read all my files on the WD (all types: pics, clips...) and i was able to Copy/paste files from the WD&gt;&gt; laptop.. After doing this several times (3-4times)i was finally able to cut/paste all the files (no one by one, but as is suppose to be done) without getting this error again. So even thus the problem seem fix now (without me doing anything) i would like to known what to expect, meaning: why did this happen? should i check something that may be working wrong? or any advice that you would consider helpfull. Thank you ...

To give it a second chance, copy out the files then delete the partition on the drive, create it anew, format it in NTFS and try again. If it fails call WD for support or replacement. Bob

Proffitt	4/24/07 4:05 PM	1.1774307E12	My thought as to what to do.	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Dual+Inputs+USB+power+cable&btnG=Google+Search finds a nice dual input USB cable that helps to wring more power from USB ports. This is often a cure for flakey USB powered drives. Bob

Also i send a mail to WD (starting to wonder if they would ever reply..one day to reply ..yea right... oh well... patience..) and i would wait a bit to see what they say. Thx for all ur help

2985	6	244191	2472702	2471117	ah732	4/28/07 9:14 PM	1.17779484E12	ok..now i`m officially worry	is doing it again..and the ppl from WD do not reply.. i would consider order the dual input cable thingy.... i can not believe the service of WD... i hope that it would get fix again... (silly question but i`m starting to think that is related somehow: if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive?? i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought?? Thx again..)

An item that has no known &quot;compatibility&quot; issues found by anyone. But there could be a first somewhere. As such no one will or should tell you it's the &quot;fix.&quot; Does that help? How about this -&gt; I'd buy one. Bob
2985	8	244191	2473968	2472792	ah732	4/30/07 1:36 PM	1.17794016E12	oh, yes i order one..	yes i decide to buy one and i order one a couple of hours after i reply my preview post.. what i was asking on that post: &quot;...if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive?? i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought?? Thx again.&quot; is just me trying to think why it may be doing this error... bc i think that when it happens is i have been watching a movie that was one the external drive.... i would get the cord in about 1.5 week.. and still waiting for WD to reply my e.mail :?
