<s> To elaborate, is there a feasible way to downclock(?) </s>
<s> the GPU in order to still have it &quot;in reserve&quot; for when I need it? </s>
<s> Basically, I'm looking to know if it's worth getting a GPU only to use some of the time---so if I can't turn it down or otherwise minimize the excessive battery drain, then I will just stick with the Intel GMA. </s>
<s> I don't do too much away from AC power, but having some semblance of battery life is good to have. </s>
<s> But here's the rub. </s>
<s> Even if some engineer made a 10 hour battery time laptop, in production engineering they'll halve that to cut the costs. </s>
<s> If you are serious about battery time, hit the reviews and then option for the larger battery. </s>

<s> that's not a very powerful GPU and doesn't consume much power. </s>
<s> if you've got a fast radeon or geforce GPU then they do consume more power. </s>
<s> however, you can control their clock speed via their control panel apps. </s>
<s> My only experience is with my old Sager 8790 with a Mobility Radeon 9700, in which I only did throttling to reduce heat (I always used it plugged in, but it was a very hot machine), so I'm not familiar with how much power you can cut by throttling a laptop GPU. </s>
<s> I have this R3000 laptop that can go from 70 to 40 Watts just by the throttle. </s>
<s> Now I do have to cheat by using SPEEDSWITCHXP to kick the CPU to high gear instead of dynamic switching. </s>
<s> And I can carve another 10 watts by dimming the screen. </s>
<s> That's better than 50% difference from full throttle to full power save mode and it's still usable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> And the kind of result I was hoping for. </s>
<s> How do I know those numbers? </s>
<s> I bought a few Watt Meters to find out where and what uses what amount of power around the house. </s>
<s> I'm sure I made my 20 bucks back as I found simple things like a cordless phone that was rarely used but drew 3+ Watts 24x365 days a year among other bigger discoveries. </s>
<s> Heck that's only 26,280 Watt hours I cut back with a 3 Watt device! </s>
<s> 1 pound of coal can generate 8,800/9,500 of a kilowatt-hour, or 926 watt-hours. </s>
<s> So that single change cut my yearly use by 28 pounds of coal. </s>

<s> but realized that I didn't want to get in to unplugging my TV and such. </s>
<s> But I do unplug all my stuff when I go on vacation and etc. </s>
