i need to buy a good gaming pc for myself.
i will be playing games like battlefield 2, f.e.a.r, rainbow 6 las vegas, and other awesome games like that.
i cannot spend more than $1000 on this.
all i want to know is what are the best things to get so i can get good memory, a good video card and all that junk.
please help.
thanks a lot.
i'm really only a casual gamer.
i will play rainbow 6 and battlefield mostly.
i probably won't even have any other games on my computer.
what i am looking for is basically an awesome pc that can handle those games easily so i don't get mad that it lags all the time.
but along with that, i don't need, and won't spend money on, the $4000 - $5000 pc's.
how about the gateway fx530xm with: -intel core 2 duo processor e6600 (2.40ghz, 1066mhz fsb, 4mb cache, non-ht) -2048mb 667mhz dual-channel ddr2 sdram (2-1024mb modules) -intel 975x chipset with ddr2 and intel core duo support -500gb 7200rpm serial ata ii/ 300 hard drive w/ 8mb cache & raid 0 (2-250gb hard drives) and either one of these(i can't decide on which one i actually need): -nvidia geforce 7600gt 256mb ddr2 video card dual dvi/ tv -nvidia geforce 8800gts w/ 320mb, dual dvi-i dual link tv out (factory overclocked) w/ vga adapter
