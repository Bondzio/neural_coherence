I've wanted to play Battlefield2 and Call of Duty 4. I just can't seem to find a decent graphics card for my computer though, I know my computer cant handle a x16, and I was hoping I could find a x1 or something for it. The best I've found is here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143032 If anyone could find something better, that would be nice. Thank you.

The E310 only has an 80gb one, and I have no clue if some of them are compatible with my computer, what kinds are good. This one seems good to me, but I don't know. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148140 Help me with this too please? lol....Thank You. I don't need a massive HD, but it would be nice to have around 250-320gb.

See http://www.pcisig.com/specifications/conventional/conventional_pci/lowp_ecn.pdf for measurements so you can see if your PC can use such a thing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect shows some good links and pictures to the normal size.

I'm thinking about replacing my mobo now, I wanna be able to get an x16 card. It IS possible, I found that here http://forums.3dgamers.com/archive/index.php/t-12904 and then I was trying to find a mobo on newegg... otherwise, i was thinking I could just go with this one http://www.buy.com/prod/intel-d945gbo-desktop-board-pentium-d-celeron-d-pentium-4-intel-945g/q/loc/101/202166272.html That way I can have MORE expansion slots for RAM, it will still fit, and I can get an x16 card. Do you think I could do it with little experience on taking that stuff out and installing a new one. I've only opened up the computer to put something in the PCI slot... Is it better than my current one?...too many thought right now..
