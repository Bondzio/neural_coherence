I bought an APC UPS for my desktop,but don't have a grounded outlet to plug it into.Does not having a grounded outlet affect the UPS as far as protection to my equipment goes?
I can put up with the little red light that indicates &quot;building wiring fault&quot;.
For some reason,APC says it's warranty is void if I don't use a grounded outlet.
