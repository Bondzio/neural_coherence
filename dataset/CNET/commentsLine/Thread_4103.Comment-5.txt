looks the best and go with it.
if you don't have a lot to back up maybe even a smaller ssd might be an alternative.
the good thing is if you've got the original data, a full backup of the data, plus the thumb drives you got some redundancy and some time to shop for your longer term solution.
thanks for the feedback and keep us posted.
