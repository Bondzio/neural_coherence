Older laptops suffer from a failure in the charger/inverter component in the unit itself.
Sometimes the mfgr uses a small seperate board and others make it part of the system/motherboard.
When batteries reach the end of their useful lives, the take more current to charge and can burn the board, battery and charger inverter unit.
Replacement of both battery and converter leaves the internals being the failure.
I have a Dell with the same trouble and a new MOBO is needed, not expensive but over ten years old, best left for more dire days.
