<s> Firstly, apologies if this seems a little long winded, but I am hoping to provide as much info as possible. </s>
<s> A friend of mine has recently set up a router (Linksys WRT54GS) in his home, and currently connects to desktop machines via Cat5 and one laptop via wireless. </s>
<s> For the most part the network appears stable, however when he attempts to play certain online games(on one of the machines connected via Cat5 cable), he encounters a series of problems. </s>
<s> Now I know, port forwarding is often an issue here, however I have double checked all port information for the games in question (primarily Medieval 2 at present) and have subsequently forwarded all ports appropriately. </s>
<s> When he tries to run the game whilst connected to the router he is regularly disconnected, and any games he sets up to host are visible, but unconnectable to others. </s>
<s> If he connects his computer directly to his cable modem, the issues resolve themselves. </s>
<s> What is equally baking my noodle here, is that I have, for all intensive purposes, the exact same setup as him (i.e. </s>
<s> A similar number of computers, same router, many of the same games - including Medieval 2) and I do not encounter these issues. </s>
<s> The only noticable difference here is that I connect via wireless protocol instead of via Cat5. </s>
<s> I have double checked my router setup to his and they are identical. </s>
<s> Any ideas what I am missing here and where the issue might lie? </s>
<s> Many thanks, KG P.S. </s>
<s> His current setup is as follows (some of the PC specs differ between his machine and mine but the majority are comparible): Pentium 4 1024 MB RAM 200GB HDD NVIDIA 7800 SiS ethernet adapter Linksys WRT54GS router Windows XP Home SP2 </s>
<s> Is the firmware current? </s>
<s> Yes, the issue was present when the router was running the firmware version it was shipped with, and has continued after I upgraded his firmware for him. </s>
<s> KG </s>
<s> Next test, no router. </s>
<s> Go direct. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This has already been tested (as mentioned briefly in the original post). </s>
<s> When I change the setup so that the cable connection is connected directly to his main machine (thus missing the router out completely) the issues do not occur. </s>
<s> This is how I have confirmed that it is something to do with the router and/or its setup itself, however I am at a loss as to what element is at fault. </s>
<s> KG </s>
<s> Sometimes the support staff will tell you an exact version of firmware or declare the router dead. </s>
<s> I don't keep a list of what firmware to try on each router so that's what I'd do next. </s>
