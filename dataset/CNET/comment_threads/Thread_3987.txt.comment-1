Does anybody know if they are any coupons for the Dell SE198WFP?
It's a pretty cheap monitor as is (plan to buy it anyway), but I was wondering if anyone had any dell.com coupons to knock another 10% off.
I scoured for some on Google for awhile but had no luck, although I did find when this monitor was originally released, it was $189 vs. $199 it is now.
Anywho, any help is appreciated.
I wouldn't mind saving a buck or two (which is why I'm getting this monitor in the first place).
