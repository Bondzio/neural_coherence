they can't be found in windows explorer or disk manager.
when i plug in my flash drive to one, it lights up and my computer makes the &quot;ba-dump!&quot; nice like it knows it got plugged in.
the light on my flash drive turns on at first but turns off right away, like the computer isn't reading the drive.
i tried plugging in my mp3 player, and i got the same response.
it charged my player, but it didn't read it.
please help.
anything i missed feel free to ask.
