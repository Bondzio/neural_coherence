good luck with it all.....i just got a eeepc1005peg for christmas and within 36 hours of start up, the hard drive crashed & got blue screen with win7.
after 2 hours of (non) conversation-----they can only read from a card, i got an rma but will have to foot the cost of return which is 10% of what the thing cost.
he insinuated that i abused the commputer (there are 7 laptops in my living room right now--3 dell, 2 hp, 1 toshiba, & a mac and 4 desktops---i know how to use a computer).
couldn't get any company address for bbb complaints, the 'customer service' guy couldn't speak english or understand the spelling of my name, etc, wouldn't give his name or employee number so i could send a formal complaint.
now that i've done a google search, i'm sorry i bought asus----your problems have just begun.....they will hang up on you, lose your laptop, say they are waiting for parts, claim you damaged it before you returned it, abused it, offer a lesser replacement, etc.
i understand that parts have defects, but the distinct and universal lack of service is a problem.
fortunately, the on-line store i bought it from will take it back, without questions & will pay for returning it & will refund my money!
i will buy from them again.
good luck!.
