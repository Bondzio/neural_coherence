<s> I've been thinking of getting a new set of hard drives for my pc. </s>
<s> I was thinking of getting a smaller, faster hard drive to instal the OS and system files, and a larger one for general storage. </s>
<s> My querry is two-fold; 1. </s>
<s> Is this a good setup or do I not know what I am talking about? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Any recommendations on what hard drives to get. </s>
<s> (Not looking for expensive top of the line, just cheap and reliable) </s>
<s> Depending on your system, you mentioned nothing about what you are presently using ,it is hard to say. </s>
<s> Some have gone to using solid state drives, which are typically faster but more costly so before you decide you may want to do a little research and see if SSD's are the way for you to go. </s>
<s> Sorry about the lack of information, didn't really know what was important. </s>
<s> I just looked up my computer http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-pavilion-elite-m9660f/4507-3118_7-33573219.html and now I can say that it has Serial ATA-300 which caused some confusion when looking at hard drives. </s>
<s> The computer was bought factory refurbished about half a year ago. </s>
<s> I have upgraded to windows 7 if that matters at all. </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that I mainly use it for gaming and was curious if storing the game files on the second hard drive would have a big impact? </s>
<s> I can provide more info if needed, just tell me what you need. </s>
<s> be a new GPU. </s>
<s> That's why it helps to know your system components and your primary use. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> As another poster mentioned it would have been nice to know something about the hardware (computer) being used and the intended purpose. </s>
<s> As to whether it would be worth swapping ATA(S) for SSD'S for the purpose of gaming would hinge on hardware capabilities, GPU, as mentioned and other components RAM, VIDRAM, and PSU, primarily. </s>
<s> From there it might be determined, one way or the other. </s>
<s> I am sorry that my post has caused some confusion. </s>
<s> I thought it would be obvious, but I guess not, that link leads to the specs for my computer model. </s>
<s> I am not really trying to boost gaming performance as I am comfortable with it as it is. </s>
<s> I was just letting you know that is it's primary use. </s>
<s> This thread is about the fact that I am in the market for a new hard drive and am considering my options. </s>
<s> As for the matter of SSD's it is my ill informed reasoning that my computer is not fit to fully leverage the benefits. </s>
