SyncToy (Developed Microsoft, free) can sync folders including shared folders in different computers.
More safer methods are: 1. establish RAID(such as RAID 5) with multiple hard drives in your Network Attached Storage, so one hard drive failure of all hard drives won't destory your data.
2.
Scheduly backup your important data to another location.
I use Total Backup & Recovery( http://www.farstone.com/software/totalrecovery-pro.php ) to do this job.
