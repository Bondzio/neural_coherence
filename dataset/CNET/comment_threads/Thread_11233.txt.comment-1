Hi Everyone, I have been given a Toshiba Satellite L30 - 101 lap top which I have been told if I can fix it I can keep it.
The laptop has a broken screen so every time it is switched on most of the screen is covered in black and all you can see is the surrounding parts.
What I would like to know is if there is any way that this can be fixed without replacing the screen?
I havn't managed to do anything other then connect it to an external monitor which is not practical for what I need it for and search online for a new screen, a new screen is very expensive so if I can fix it that would be amazing.
If anyone knows if this is possible it's you guys as you have helped me a lot over the past few months with other computer problems Thanks all Paul
