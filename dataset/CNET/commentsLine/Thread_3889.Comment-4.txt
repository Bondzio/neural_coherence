in australia maxtor are selling their 80gb ext hd for $99.
i think that is reasonable.
they were $149.
however, when i bought one, and left it plugged in and connected to the power, after a short time, just a day or two, the light went out.i took it back, got a replacement, and the same thing happened again.
now i am being told that maybe i should not have left it plugged into the power so long.
perhaps i should have only turned it on when i wanted to use it, and then turn it off as soon as i had finished my &quot;backup&quot;.
it was only the power cord that stuffed up, and i could not get a new replacement cord and keep the hd.
i had to return the whole lot.
now i am going to get a lacie 160gb which is going to cost a heck of a lot more, but what can i do?
i still think the power cord should not have malfunctioned like it did.
lots of people are leaving things plugged into the power all the time, so why not an external hard drive?
