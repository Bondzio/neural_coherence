Its a Dual Core 4200* 2.20GHz processor. Unless theres two processor in one chip. Which one is true guys? http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1539409&Sku=MBM-A8NSLI-4400

I am assuming the latter would be faster? My dad's server has two Xenon chips, not dual core. Is that still single-threaded? Does it have more physcially because more server stuff is multi-threaded? ~Ibrahim~

They found that the dual core is a bit faster because inter-cpu communication is inside the chip rather than going across the bus. (Dual core intels still have to communicate across the bus and are therefore not as efficient.) Consider this analogy. Assume you want to collaborate with your neighbor on some project. If you're in a house, you have to go in and out of your front door to share things with your neighbor. That same front door is used for your deliveries and your other comings and goings. You might be bumping into the mailman or walking over your kids while they unload groceries from the van. You'll be doing the same trying to get to your neighbor's front door. But if you're in a duplex, you can put a door in your common wall and share things more easily and quickly. And, your're not adding more traffic to your or your neighbor's front door and walkway.
