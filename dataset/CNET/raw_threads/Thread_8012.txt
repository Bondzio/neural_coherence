My next upgrade will pretty much include the works, but my hard drive is fine, currently running full retail win7. Will MS let me use current OS if I get a new MOBO/CPU (and SSD)? I plan to simply migrate the old HDD to my upgraded rig. Or will MS force me to buy new retail OS? In advance, thanks for the advice.
