Everyone tells me to go with AMD then others tell me to go with Intel, can I get some advice??

The AMD's ran cooler than than the P4's. Unfortunately Intel uses the Core 2 name on their mobile CPU's but the are not the great CPU that the Conroe cores are. Eventually they may get redesigned using Conroe architecture.
