bought gateway last year.
the word seems to be just getting out.i have at present 5 gateway and 1 acer machines.
i'm hoping that the tech support will improve at gateway, but i won't hold my breath.
i had a couple of acer's back in the '90's and they were great.
i went to gateway because they had a tech facility and showroom here.
that is gone about 2 years now.
tech support with either (now the same i suppose)has always been spotty or iffy.
