I looked in devices & found only the manufacturer (NEC) & the driver version (5.1.2600). I'm it is US. B 2.0. Short of calling the manufacturer how do I find out? Thank-you

You can try a USB splitter cable that has two plugs that plug into two of yourusb ports and deliver the sum of the two ports' output to your device. I have been using this arrangement for over a year with no problems.However in the event that your laptop can't put out enough juice you can get a very small USB adapter that you connect to one of the cable branches while the other plugs into your computer for data transfer. I think you'll find the first arrangement will work for you as an inexpensive approach Regards Seewart
