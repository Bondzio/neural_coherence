i'm listening to &quot;echoes&quot; on my local hd public radio station right now.
i have a creative soundblaster 24 bit live card, and i run spdif coax out to my yamaha receiver.
the hd stations sound great, but dvds on power dvd deluxe in 5.1 are amazing.
this card is 7.1 capable, but this receiver only puts out 5.1.
7.1 with hdmi will probably will my next stereo upgrade.
i would like to see wireless speakers become more common -- and affordable -- before i do that.
