I bought a emachine t2542 and know it didn't have an agp port.
So i decided i would just buy a new motherboard to put a geforce fx in.
I tried this and the computer doesn't boot winxp anymore.
I'm thinking emachine put something on the HD that detects the motherboard therefore stopping people from using there parts with other computers.
Maybe i didn't uninstall enough, but i did uninstall the video, sound, and ethernet card.
Tell more if there is more to uninstall like IDE devices or all the different Intel controllers.
I definitly need some help otherwise it's buy a new HD and windowsXP something i want to avoid.
Somebody knows the answer i hope.
