I am going to buy a new pc in a couple of months.
My old pc is just that...old, and I want more speed and capabilities.
I have a 2001 custom built pc with Athlon 850Mhz, 384 Rams with millions of unknown stuff that makes it slow.
I am going to purchase a Dell, however, how do I know WHICH Dell to purchase.
I am a machinist and constantly use CAD-style programs, however, my wife is a type of 'gamer' I can affored to spend $2500, but I want 'top notch' (or as close to it as possible) speed, excellent CAD software capability, and the 'gamer' potential all in one!
Ideas?...Dimension, Inspiron?...help me please.
