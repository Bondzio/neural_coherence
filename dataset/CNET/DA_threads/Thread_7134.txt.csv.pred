1.1.1	I have a Dell 2350 running a celeron processor at 1.8 GHZ .	St
1.1.2	Ive upgraded memory , power supply and video and graphics card and now for fun Id like to try a new better processor .	St
1.1.3	Pentium if possible or a faster Celeron .	St
1.1.4	As expected Dell told me no way but Im wondering if any one has had any luck with this.Thanks in advance for any response .	St

1.2.1	Once at the support website for Dell , see if any & quot ; upgrade option & quot ; is being sold/available for that model .	St
1.2.2	If yes , then get it on the open market .	St
1.2.3	What may have happened is Dell no longer offer upgrade parts as stock is depleted or too old .	St
1.2.4	You can check the & quot ; specs & quot ; page as well for what if any info is available , but its important that the bios be able to support any new processor of the same class .	St
1.2.5	IMHO , you maybe able to go to 2.4ghz , but that 's a maybe as if no FSB settings , etc .	St
1.2.6	ca n't be changed you 're locked-in to that processor .	St
1.2.7	Check the mtrbd .	St
1.2.8	itself for any setting printed on possible jumpers .	St
1.2.9	But in most cases the bios itself has to the setting area .	St
1.2.10	Check your bios and see if you can change it at all at least to a lower setting , if lower can be done then very possible a higher setting can be as well .	St
1.2.11	Since this is a OEM type system you 're at the mercy of what the vendor allows .	St
1.2.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	If you change too much hardware in that type of machine , Windows may refuse to work .	St
1.3.2	You wo n't be able to reinstall Windows using the Dell restore disk .	St
1.3.3	Your disk is proprietary to that system .	St
1.3.4	It will be looking for your old hardware .	St
1.3.5	You could end up having to purchase a new Windows XP cd to make it work .	St
1.3.6	Thats why it can be less expensive to purchase a new computer than update a proprietary machine .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the info I figured Im stuck .	St
1.4.2	Just have to start fresh and build something from scratch .	St
1.4.3	Bill W	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the input I may just build a new machine from scratch .	St
1.5.2	I always wanted to so now may be the time .	St
1.5.3	Bill W	St
