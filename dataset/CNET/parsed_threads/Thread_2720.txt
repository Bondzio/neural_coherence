<s> Since that happend my PC has been turning itself off. </s>
<s> To make things funny it only happen when standing. </s>
<s> When I put PC on the side it works fine. </s>
<s> I replaced video card and power supply unit, no good. </s>
<s> It looks to me, there is some loose connection or something gets overheat, but how can I figure out what? </s>
<s> Open case and place it where it seems NOT to work. </s>
<s> using some non-conductive probe, plastic stick or pencil(erarer end) wiggle or jiggle this or that and see if it makes a difference. </s>
<s> I would also swap out the HDMI cable, those are simple cables. </s>
<s> It helps to know what's what, PC? </s>
<s> video card? </s>
<s> etc.. </s>
<s> There also the possibility the mtrbd. </s>
<s> has been compromised, minor crack or component in some fashion, unless you can fix, replacement is only option if found so. </s>
