<s> Hi there, I had borrowed a 120 GB Fujitsu external hard drive from a friend. </s>
<s> I plugged it to my old laptop on which I had run a virus scan and cleaned off all the viruses. </s>
<s> The hard disk got recognized this time. </s>
<s> Then once I unplugged this and plugged back later onto the same laptop, it wasnt recognized. </s>
<s> I then connected it to a brand new laptop and it still wasnt recognized. </s>
<s> I tried connecting it to few other laptops and it still wasnt recognized. </s>
<s> That makes me believe that the hard disk is infected. </s>
<s> Can anyone please help me with this issue. </s>
<s> Thanks, CSR </s>
<s> Try plugging it into a computer with a different operating system. </s>
<s> Do all of these computers have the same operating system? </s>
<s> for some reason unknown, this Hdd. </s>
<s> is corrupted. </s>
<s> You need some partition/data recovery software to help you out. </s>
<s> Search cnet downloads to see what's available. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
