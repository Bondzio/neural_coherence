Well i kinda seen that myself i believe it narrows down to the only 2 i see that is mATX REFURBISHED: ASRock P4VM800 Socket 478 VIA P4M800 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard - OEM REFURBISHED: BIOSTAR P4VMA-M Socket 478 VIA PM800 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard - OEM TD25x said to go with the BIOSTAR but why do that?
i am asking because to me i think the ASRock looks better for one thing it has more USB ports on that one.
