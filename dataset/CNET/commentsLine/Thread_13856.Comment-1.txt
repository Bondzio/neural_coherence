i have two video cards, a nvidia geforce 7300 le (which is installed in my computer) and an old geforce 4 (which is not in my computer) my computer runs slow sometimes when running games and a friend told me that there was a way to run both video cards on one computer and this will make games and such run smoother.
however i am not really sure how to install both, or even if installing both cards actualy makes the computer run faster.
i was wondering if anybody could help me out a bit
