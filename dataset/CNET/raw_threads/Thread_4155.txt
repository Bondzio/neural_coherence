For no apparent reason, after my 1150 has been on for awhile, the power source changes from AC to battery with no warning. The laptop is not being moved or jostled at all when this happens. Can anyone give me a clue as to why this is happening and what I can do about it? Thank you!

It does not matter that you didn't move the connection or laptop since failures run the map and we can't see the parts involved. If it's the usual, a good technician can reflow the solder and maybe clear up the problem. In closing, the number of laptops I see transported with the power cord connected makes me think that this problem is widespread. Bob
