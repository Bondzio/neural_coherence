what is a cross-over cable ?
how is it different from a normal cable, e.g.
cat5 or rj45, ... and when is it used ?
and what are &quot;twists&quot; in the cable, and how does these twists &quot;qualify&quot; the cable ?
[all these with regard to connection of networking devices, e.g.
nic, modem, router, etc.
...] thanks.
christy
