<s> So here is the RAM specs that i have, taken straight from the Ram itself. </s>
<s> Brand - Buffalo Select PC3-10600U - 999 1GB 1333Mhz CL9 1R x 8 DDR3 SDRAM NON ECC Unbuffered S/N 81017 D3U1333 - S1GBJ I have 3 of those. </s>
<s> I would like another 3. </s>
<s> On the motherboard specs looks like i have 6 slots. </s>
<s> I was wondering about the fact that I have 3 RAM, as I thought they always needed to be in matched pairs. </s>
<s> After reading this http://www.tech-faq.com/dimm.html and realising that the slots are for DIMM now i understand that I can have one at a time. </s>
<s> In case you want to check the motherboard is: http://www.giga-byte.co.uk/products/pro ? </s>
<s> id=2958#sp So my question is do i need the same brand as the above or will any 1GB 1333Mhz 1R x 8 DDR3 SDRAM do? </s>
<s> Can you point me in the correct shop direction? </s>
<s> Montag60 </s>
<s> more than three Gig of RAM? </s>
<s> Will your OS (you didn't tell us what it is) handle more than three, even though the board may? </s>
<s> Go to crucial.com and input the PC specs. </s>
<s> If you have a 32/bit windows, you will not be able to benefit from more then 4gig ram, if you run 64/bit I think its about 12gig ram! </s>
