xerox have been producing quality printers for a long time and looks like they also expanded their custormer reach to marketing affiliates that distributes their laser printers for free.
i recently acquired a free phaser 8560 dn from xerox thru freeprinterpromo.com - but you'll have to purchase the supplies from them.
have been using this printer for more than a year now and had no maintenance issue with it to date.
it prints fast with good quality.
this unit is also best for network groups which requires bulk printing.
