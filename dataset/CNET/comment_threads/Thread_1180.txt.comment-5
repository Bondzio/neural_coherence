My first computer was an HP and like you, my first time i opened it up i was dumbfounded :S. No AGP slot!!...
Anyways for a new motherboard u can be upgrading from time to time I would suggest one with PCI-e, if you can afford it.
If you cant, any motherboard with AGP slot will be fine since i can assume you dont play intensive games.
Good Luck!
