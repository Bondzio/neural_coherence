1.1.1	I have two short throw projectors which are used for presentations.	St
1.1.2	I would like to convert these to wireless to allow flexible positioning of the presenters laptop.	St
1.1.3	Connections I have available are USB B, S-video and VGA.	St
1.1.4	I was thinking of a USB B wireless adapter or USB B to USB A and a USB A wireless adapter not sure if any of these would work.	St
1.1.5	Any advise is appreciated.	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	So I have to ask if they are sure they want to spend that many thousand bucks.	St
