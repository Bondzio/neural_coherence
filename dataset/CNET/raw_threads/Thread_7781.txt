I would expect it and the apps that run with it to have growing pains......your call. I'd consider backing up to w7......most of the bugs have been worked out. Product support&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2020. Canada bucks?.......no idea.

Keep away from new versions of Windows until there's a SP1 maintenance, especially for Windows 8. Good luck.
