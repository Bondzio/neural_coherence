while it generally works fine, i have had some issues with this router and various d-link cards.
i tried to replace some b cards with g's after i upgraded the router and had installation issues.
i have kept the b cards which seem to work with this router better than the newer g's though of course there could be more to it that i am not able to diagnose.
i use a security code and my laptop picks up a different wireless network, sometimes i have to reset the router or reinstall the card to get it to work at home again.
my next choice will be the belkin pre-n which i have heard is excellent.
