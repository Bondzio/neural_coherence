Im getting a new Dell Dimension 2400 and what what exactly would i need to share the broadband connection wirelessly? Also, will it effect the wireless connection if my emachines is on my second floor and my dimension 2400 is in the basement? Sorry if these questions have been asked over before. Im a little new at this and dont know where to start.

This WAP can be placed anywhere providing you can run an ethernet cable to it. The route is up to you and should be placed close enough to the wireless PC to receive a strong signal.
