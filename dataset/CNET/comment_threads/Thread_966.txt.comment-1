Hi all.
I am using samsung cdrw sw-252B with 52r*24rw*52w.
I tried to burn a cd recordable but it broke into pieces while trying to do so.
I would like to know if it is true that i should not use a cd recordable that supports way below 52x.
Moreover after removing all the broken pieces from the device, the drive seems to burn slowly as the red light goes on and off throughout the burning process instead of the usual red light that turns on all the way while buring.
Is this normal ?
