And nothing has worked. All other functions with the drive works fine, just nothing I do will enable autoplay. Is this a typical problem with this particular DVD drive? If not, does anyone have advice on how to enable autoplay with this particular drive?

Did you install any hardware together with it's device driver recently? If so check if your device driver is digitally designed for Windows XP, if not then that is your culprit! Many pc user's are ignorant on the importance of having any pc hardware and device driver digitally designed, if not it will create different problems for your OS, including your case. On my experience, I couldn't fix the problem even after 3 consecutive reformats and Windows XP reinstallations. I've upgraded my OS from Windows XP Home to Windows XP PRO and that solved the problem. Try upgrading your OS or reverting it to any previous versions of Windows, then after sometime reformat your hardrive and install your current copy of Windows XP but avoid installing the hardware that caused your problem.

Such is not noted so I can't offer much about that. 2. I do suggest you type XP AUTOFIX into google.com and find the tool that automatically attempts autoplay repair. Keep in mind that DVDs may not have an action to play until DVD player software is installed. Bob

HD crashed, minimal loss of data thanks to DVD RW and external HD for storage. Again, thank you for all the assists.
