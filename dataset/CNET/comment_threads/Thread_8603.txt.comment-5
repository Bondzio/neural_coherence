I was told I can change the operating system to WIN 8 but there is no real need at the moment.
As far as backup is concerned I have a few DOKs between 16 and 32GB each - all I needed was a way to download the pictures - but then it looks like a small laptop will be needed and we have one somewhere if one of the kids haven't already borrowed it.
Maybe Google will fix Picasa, anyway I am sure that whatever happens will be interesting.
Thanks again for the thoughts - heavy Bob any idea on a reasonably priced motor-cycle or advice on a walkabout lense for a Canon 7D?
Have fun - Light Mike
