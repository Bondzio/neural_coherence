1.5.1	If you have a local Walgreens drup store around , they should refill your empty cartridges a lot cheaper than buying more new ones .	St
1.5.2	Once you have an empty one just drop it off at Walgreens and they will refill it .	St
1.6.1	I have had good luck on Ebay with the Abacusfree store .	St
1.6.2	they also have a site : http : //www.abacus24-7.com/ .	St
1.6.3	Same people , ebay site has free shipping , the other does not .	St
1.6.4	Been using their aftermarket cartridges at work for almost 2 years without a problem	St
1.7.1	I buy mine from www.Pacificink.com .	St
1.7.2	They have a wide assortment of the brands .	St
1.7.3	They are usually half price if not better .	St

1.7.7	I 've been buying mine there for a couple of years now .	St
1.7.8	There inks are good enough for everyday printing and decent photo output .	St
1.7.9	If you require top notch finish stick with the retail ink from the manufactor .	St
1.7.10	They are usually the highest quality .	St
1.7.11	But not cheap .	St
1.7.12	This goes for all the generic ink outfits .	St
1.7.13	For me I have n't needed the highest quality .	St
1.7.14	Also I have found by using the cheaper inks I can go for better paper and get pretty damn good quality there .	St
1.7.15	Just my 2 cents !	St
1.8.1	I have been buying compatible ink cartridges from Clickinks.com because there price is a few cents lower that others and they also have a buy 2 and get 1 free offer on all orders .	St
1.8.2	So for the price of 2 I get 3 and save some money .	St
1.8.3	And they are quick on deliverys .	St
1.8.4	They also sell OEM ink .	Sug
1.8.5	check them out .	Sug
1.9.1	For years I 've been buying my ink on-line via http : //www.gotink4u.com/ and have had nothing but good luck with their products .	St
1.9.2	It 's all been non-OEM stuff but it 's also cost a fraction of what it would have cost me through the big name retail channels .	St
1.9.3	Honestly , in the hundreds of cartridges I 've used over the years I can count on one hand the number of bad one 's .	St
1.9.4	If a cartridge is bad it 's not so painful to just toss it because they are so cheap to begin with .	St
1.9.5	I 'd suggest buying a few just to & quot ; try them out & quot ; and see how they work with your printers .	Sug
1.9.6	I certainly ca n't complain as they 've worked great for me .	St
1.10.1	I have been getting mine from printpal.com for the last few years .	St

1.14.1	myinks.com	St
1.15.1	I have bought my ink from two places , the first is 123inkjets.com .	St
1.15.2	Their prices are very good for the printer that I have , about $ 4.00 per cartridge .	St
1.15.3	the last place that I purchased ink from was abcink.com , and their prices were just as good as 123inkjets.com .	St
1.15.4	The only reason that I changed companies was 123inkjets.com no longer uses paypal as a payment source .	St
1.15.5	I received fast service from both of those companies .	St
1.16.1	For Europeans meeding to avoid postage costs from USA sources , the British www.7dayshop.com does quite a good deal on compatible cartridges .	St
1.16.2	Any other good Eurodeals ?	Ques
1.17.1	Sorry it took so long to answer .	St
1.17.2	The replies were not showing up on my profile , so I did n't realize all these had come in .	St
1.17.3	I appreciate all the help .	Polite
1.17.4	I went ahead and bought from Staples , I ended up saving about $ 10 over what I could find from the cheapest store for the cartridge .	St
1.17.5	Since I needed them quickly and needed good quality I decided not to take any chances , plus I could return them right to the store if there was a problem .	St
1.17.6	I appreciate all the help and definitely will be checking these sites for the future .	St
1.17.7	Thanks again !	St
1.18.1	I just tried Office Max brand of Canon ink for my All-in One and the Black started to either dry too soon or clog the print head .	St
1.18.2	Returned it and replaced with Canon brand to fix it .	St
1.18.3	Now about to try Premium Imaging Products ( made in China..damn it ! )	St
1.18.4	from http : //www.inkquik.com , hope it will be better .	St
1.18.5	I do n't think any off brand will ever be as good as the original for ANY printer .	St
1.19.1	Always compare the printer cartridge prices before youre buying , it will save you a lot of dollars which is certainly important in these hard times .	St
1.19.2	http : //www.amazon.com and http : //www.inkguides.com lets you compare prices on the products so you now that you get the cheapest available price .	St
