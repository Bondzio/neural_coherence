<s> I have 2 cat 5 cables one has the network jack end on it and the other end has a usb end? </s>
<s> What is this used for? </s>
<s> Can it be used to transfer data from one computer to another? </s>
<s> Also how can i tell if I have a crossover cable? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your time and help </s>
<s> Not sure what you would use a USB to RJ45 cable for. </s>
<s> They make many custom cables that use common ends. </s>
<s> More than likely it is some form of console cable. </s>
<s> Etherent and USB are totally different, it needs much more electronics than just wire to make it work. </s>
<s> There are a couple of types of cross cables but for 10/100 the wires in pins 1&2 is swapped with the ones in 3&6. </s>
<s> A way that works most the time is to look at the color of the wires on left side of the connector. </s>
<s> Generally they will be orange on one end and green on the other if you have a cross cable. </s>
<s> They will be the same color on each end if you have a straight. </s>
<s> I believe some APC UPS devices, mobile printers, etc. </s>
<s> could use these. </s>
<s> Do you know what it came with? </s>
<s> Maybe this could be use for usb modem to router/LAN connection. </s>
