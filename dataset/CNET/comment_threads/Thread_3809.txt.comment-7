You add all devices, thus all fans installed and maybe the LEDs, ram modules, etc., you get the picture.
That's why the extra 100W comes into play plus anything left over is the room to grow.
As i stated, if the rated value of the PSU is 550W, then the real dependable amount is 82% of that.
As i stated earlier so many makers and vendors offering, and only a small number is ever tested by some PC website like http://www.tomshardware.com should offer some clue.
I tend to buy Antec and if generic go into the large wattage units.
Thermolake has some offerings too.
Newegg is a good source and if they offer it, I tend to feel comfortable buying from them.
