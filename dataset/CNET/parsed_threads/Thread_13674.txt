<s> I have a crashed SATA drive from another system that I want to retrieve info from. </s>
<s> I'm running W2K, MSI mobo KM400-825 Ver 1, BIOS Phoenix 6.00PG, 512 MB RAM, Athlon XP 2500, ST 40GB. </s>
<s> I bought an Adeptec Serial ATA card. </s>
<s> It's installed with the SATA drive connected but does not see the drive when I get the prompt to hit F3 for configuration. </s>
<s> I've already tried 2 of the 3 PCI slots. </s>
<s> What can I do to make the SATA drive available to retrieve the info? </s>
<s> Is it possible? </s>
<s> are the cable connections secure? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> while it is in the original computer, by using a Knoppix CD. </s>
<s> Boot the Knoppix and see if you can see the files on the drive. </s>
<s> If you have two CD drives, one a burner you may be able to save them to a CD. </s>
<s> If the other computer has another drive already in it, then plug the old drive in another SATA port. </s>
<s> Or try the same thing with the Knoppix CD if the drive comes up to speed using the PCI card [running, not necessarily directly useable]. </s>
<s> Thanks Ray. </s>
<s> I had never heard of Knoppix (completely Linux ignorant). </s>
<s> after a little research I downloaded it and I went back and tried it on the original box and HD, but to no avail. </s>
<s> But, now I have one more tool in my bag! </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
