so i'm looking to upgrade my ram in my hp a6157c.
i'm running vista 32. i've learned that means that i can't have more than 3 gb ram.
right now i have 2x 1gb pc2 5300 ddr2 ram and i'm obsessed with having the best i can possibly have.
my question is do i have to buy 2gb more of ram so that it's paired up?
meaning, do i have to have 4gb of ram in the computer even though i'm only using 3gb of it?
thanks in advance!
