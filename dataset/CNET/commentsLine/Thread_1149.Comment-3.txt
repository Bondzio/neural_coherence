is there an optimal way to partition a hard drive?
in general or in any particular situation, like &quot;tell me the details of your pc and what you do with it, and i'll tell you the optimal configuration for that machine&quot;?
if there isn't, the only possible answer to your question is that it is an question without an answer.
something like &quot;how do i walk to the moon?&quot;, or even &quot;how do i reach the end of the rainbow?&quot;.
i think for most of us one partition per drive is optimal.
and that's easy to achieve the first time you use it.
no magic needed.
