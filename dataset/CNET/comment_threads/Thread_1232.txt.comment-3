Willy, You are so right.
I took the HD out of my old Acer and placed it in the HP computer and guess what?!!
Same problem.
I figured the MB on the HP computer was to blame and took everything out of it I could...ie dvd burners and some cables.
Thanks a lot!!
I will be calling HP explaining the problem.
thanks again.
