I've found a barebone system with every thing I want, but hesitant about the Harddrive bundled.
It's a 120 gig IEDE Maxtor ultra ATA 133, but only 5400 RPM and &lt;13 average seek time.
Since I am upgrading equipment (P4 3.0 Mhz, 512MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz) to speed things up; Is this drive considered &quot;old stuff&quot;.
Or does ist matter.
