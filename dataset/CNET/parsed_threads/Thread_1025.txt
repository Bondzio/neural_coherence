<s> I just bought a Dell Studio D540 (Intel Core 2 quad processor Q9400 2.66 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 64 bit Vista) specifically to speed up the data analysis that I'm doing with Matlab. </s>
<s> The program I wrote involves a lot of Fourier transforms etc, it takes about an hour to run on my PC at home, an HP s3500f (AMD Athlon dual core 5400 2.8 Ghz, 6 GB RAM, 64 bit Vista), but over 2 hours on my Dell Studio. </s>
<s> According to the benchmarks on the cnet reviews the Dell should be faster than the HP or at least comparable, it should definitely not take twice as long. </s>
<s> There has to be something seriously wrong with this system. </s>
<s> As a comparison, the program takes about 1 hour 50 mins to run on an old 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 in the lab. </s>
<s> I've tried to get help from Dell but they said it was a software problem & it's not covered by the warranty. </s>
<s> Any ideas for why I'm getting this truly abysmal performance would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Do you remember the old &quot;Windows Thunking&quot; discussions? </s>
<s> You may want to ask for both Vista 32 and XP Pro (32 bit.) </s>

<s> My HP system also has 64 bit Vista. </s>
<s> The Matlab program takes about an hour on this system, which seems reasonable, there's a lot of math. </s>
<s> The cnet benchmark specs gave these 2 systems comparable performance, although the Dell should be faster, all tests were done with 64 bit Vista (if I remember correctly). </s>
<s> The main difference between the HP & the Dell is the processor, but that shouldn't lead to such a vast difference in performance (1 hr on the HP vs 2 hrs on the Dell), should it? </s>
<s> You may be right. </s>
<s> Look up CPUZ to poke around and see not only the CPU speed but memory timings. </s>
<s> One poor guy had a lightning fast CPU but dog slow RAM. </s>
<s> In answer to your question. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
