i would first unplug all my peripherals.. and then remove the digtial sound card..and follow up by removeing all those software programs.. and try a re-start.....what happens??
.. ok..things run good..don't re-install the digtial sound card..you will need to turn-on the integrated sound in the system set up program..f2.. once that is done..re-install the peripherals you use..usb 2.0..ok they run good.. if its that simple..you need to stop useing some incompatible software that was useing the digital sound card.. .. to use a digital sound card you should have a pentium 4 processor..and 512mbs ram.. .. audio projects alone are safe w/celeron..video requires p4..minimum.. .. sometimes i need to remove some software programs i use like once..and then they just sit there for months..remove stuff you don't use more than once..and re-install it if you need it again.. .. i'm quessing your sound card.
