I think I'm one of the unlucky goobers who's forray into hard drive replace has turned into a nightmare.
The physical instillation went great, and BIOS recognizes the new drive because all the specs and info are there.
But when I pop in my Windows XP system recovery disks and try to boot from them, I receive the following error message: &quot;No hard disk found.
System recovery cannot be continued!&quot; I'm running a HP Pavillion 743c, with Windows XP and original hard drive of 80GBs.
The new drive I'm trying to install is a 250GB Western Digital EIDE drive.
Any suggestions at all would be super appreciated.
When I purchased these system recovery disks from HP, they assured me I could use them to completely reformat the drive.
Now I'm wondering if they hosed me out of $25 for 12 disks that might not actually do anything.
Thanks so much!
