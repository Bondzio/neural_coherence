Sorry, I guess I didn't make myself clear.
All I want to do is scan a piece of paper (doc) to become a PDF so I can email it.
I don't want to run it through OCR.
But for some reason the printer/scanner is scanning at 100MG instead of the typical 78kb.
The software for the scan function seems to have hit a glitch.
It is also showing the size of the doc as 22x30&quot;, not the page setting of 8x11&quot;.
I just thought someone else might have experienced this abnormality.
Thanks anyway.
