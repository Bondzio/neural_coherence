It shows &quot;Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)&quot;. It is working fine if connecting 10meter usb extender to a mouse or keyboard. It just can't connect to a usb hub. So is the power problem of the usb hub or i can't connect extender to hub?

The computer can be in the other room and sends all USB activity wirelessly.
