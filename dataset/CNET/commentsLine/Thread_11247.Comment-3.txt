everything was connected correctly, i found some article where the same motherboard was burned in the same spot as with mine:  anyhow, that's no use now, even though it's unclear why it's broken, it is, and i'd like to replace it.
i can't buy the same motherboard as i had, because that would probably give the same weird problem, and fireworks.
