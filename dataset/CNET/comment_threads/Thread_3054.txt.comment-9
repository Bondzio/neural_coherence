I have a Nokia 8290 which uses a BLB-2 battery.
I normally charge this battery fully, unplug and go and charge it USUALLY only when it beeps which means it's ready to be charged.
I have had this same phone and battery for well over 5 years and it still holds a charge for a couple of days if I don't use it (which is rarely the case.)
I spend at least 2000-3000 minutes on this cell phone a month and am very happy with the battery life.
I sometimes get out of the truck before it finishes charging so sometimes it doesn't get a full charge but I'm faithful to put it back on charge when I get back to the charger.
It doesn't seem to matter how I charge it, it still holds a very good charge.
Now I also have friends that have newer Nokia phones and they go thru batteries like they are Alkaline batteries.
I don't know, maybe I'm just blessed - well actually, I know that I am blessed.
By the way, I use a wall charger at home and keep it on charge till I'm ready to depart the house and in the truck I have a smart charger designed for the Nokia phone.
