Thanks for your reply, R.Profit.
So what is cloud printing then?
I honestly don't know exactly but from what I understand it allows you to send a file to a cloud account such as gmail, which I have, and the printer will automatically print it instantly.
May be I am wrong - or am I correct and it is just that my printer doesn't support cloud printing.
I don't know.
