1.1.1	Hi , I 'm having constant lag spikes .	St
1.1.2	I use DPC Latency checker http : //www.thesycon.de/deu/latency_check.shtml On both my desktop ( using PCI wifi card ) and my laptop I have lag spikes .	St
1.1.3	This is a screenshot of the spikes http : //i.imgur.com/cyoLq.png .	St
1.1.4	Although it says its my hardware problems , I doubt its true , as it happens on both devices .	St
1.1.5	As a gamer this is truly irritating .	St
1.1.6	Do you have any idea how to fix this problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	Maybe it 's the router .	St
1.2.2	Maybe it 's interference with a nearby router ( your neighbours ) operating on the same or an adjacent channel .	St
1.2.3	Maybe it 's a hacker using your unprotected wireless router .	St
1.2.4	Maybe it 's some background program that took a millisecond of the CPU or Windows doing its housekeeping .	St
1.2.5	For gaming it 's adviced to use a wired connection .	St
1.2.6	With a desktop that 's usually easy to do , since it stays on the same position so it 's a one-time operation to have a cable there .	St
1.2.7	The same , of course , if you use your laptop usually at the same place ( and not so often at other locations , when at home ) .	St
1.2.8	It 's worth an experiment at least , because it eliminates all wireless issues ( hackers , interference , the wireless logic of the router ) .	St
1.2.9	Changing the channel you use , of course , is a very easy test .	St
1.2.10	Kees	St
1.3.1	WiFi is in the wide open so a neighbor , another PC or a microwave oven can interfere .	St
1.3.2	Gamers learn quickly that WiFi is not the connection of choice .	St
1.3.3	Eventually they move back to the wired connection and even turn off the WiFi in the router .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Absolutely , that is n't uncommon and as you said , if you are gaming , wireless is NOT the way to go , too many variables , can bounce around like a yo yo .	St
