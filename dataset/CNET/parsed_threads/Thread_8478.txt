<s> Hello all, I am looking to upgrade my current desktops processor. </s>
<s> The motherboard is a Pegatron M2N78-LA (Violet). </s>
<s> Is it worth replacing the AMD Phenom II X4 925 2.80GHz that came stock? </s>
<s> If so what would be a good one to replace it with. </s>
<s> I would like it to be decent at running cpu heavy games. </s>
<s> Most motherboards are designed for a certain brand and range of processors. </s>
<s> This is due to varying types of connections, speeds, and connections. </s>
<s> Obviously Intel and AMD use different sockets, but within each there're different sockets, speeds, and features. </s>
<s> Also a processor is designed to work with a certain type of RAM (e.g. </s>
<s> DDR, DDR2, DDR3), so you'd probably need new RAM to go with the processor and motherboard. </s>
<s> So you're looking at $200 to $300 and you still have your old hard drive, ports, power supply, operating system, and probably no warranty. </s>
<s> So I know I'd just spend a little more and buy a new computer. </s>
<s> YMMV. </s>
<s> What game are you asking about as most are fine with that CPU but with the best GPU you can fit. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> you are right </s>
