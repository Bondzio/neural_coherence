It's like there's no power. I've opened the case and checked that the fan in the power supply and on the cpu are not running. I think it's the power supply from I've read in this forum. How do I check the power supply and is that the only thing I can do? Thanks

There are PSU testers, but for that price I can buy a PSU. Here's another test -&gt; http://forums.extremeoverclocking.com/showthread.php?t=137886 Page down to the link where thay write about MANUALLY STARTING the PSU. Bob
