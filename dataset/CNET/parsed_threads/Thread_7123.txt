<s> Hello folks, Now that Back-to-School sales are running high, I thought of getting a printer for my occasional printing needs. </s>
<s> I need black and white printer only, no fancy features required as long as it does its printing job well. </s>
<s> I plan to refill ink from places like cartridgeworld or similar, hence I am looking for a printer that is cheap to refill as well. </s>
<s> I will be glad if I could get some recommendations. </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Pick up any 99 buck HP laser printer from an office store and you won't have a dry cartridge problem again. </s>

<s> Buy an under $100 mono laser and be done with it. </s>
<s> The big plus if you truly do occasional printing, it'll be ready to go and the toner cart. </s>
<s> will last as well for a very long time. </s>
<s> Buy any cheap inkjet printer then expect cheap results over time and any refills you're at the mercy of the source of those refills, false economy. </s>
<s> tada ----Willy </s>
