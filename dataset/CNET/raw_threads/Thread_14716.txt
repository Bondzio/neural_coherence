After much research and consideration, I have decided to give my poorly outdated AGP system another go before I upgrade to PCI-e. The question is: What is a reasonable AGP graphics cards? I know the Nvidia 7800gs is pretty much the best one out there, but after reading about how unstable it can be on the Newegg review's I'm unsure. Has anyone else had problems with it? Also, any other AGP cards you guys recommend? Thanks!
