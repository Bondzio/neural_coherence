if the product is non-functional, it may be best to pack it up and try another product.
you may have issues with usb or didn't follow their install notes.
has many posts where the usb devices are plugged in before the drivers or the motherboard drivers are not installed and usb problems (just like yours) begin.
i read no mention of details on your part about removal of the ethernet card, setting the mode of the usb wifi and more.
this lack of information leads me to think that returning the product will save you a lot of work.
