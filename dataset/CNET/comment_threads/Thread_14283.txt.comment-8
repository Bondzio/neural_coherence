could use another case fan.
Remember that both the video card, and possibly the memory will also get hotter and increase the interior ambient air temp around the CPU's HSF.
Intel says [for their HSF] that holding the ambient by the HSF 38 C [100F] or below will keep the CPU in spec.
Howevwer that is about what you are getting.
Try to get the air in the vicinity of the HSF about 33 C [91 F].
