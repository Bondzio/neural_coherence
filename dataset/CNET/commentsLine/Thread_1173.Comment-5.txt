i am actually on my fourth replacement router from linksys.
i have spent countless hours on the phone with tech support and when i finally get to a level 2 technician they seem to conclude after much diagnostics that the router is faulty.
i recently bought a linksys (yes, not smart) pci adapter when i learned that the usb adapters are much slower.
the connection seemed much better but then, of course, the connection broke and, once again, i cannot get online.
i was hoping to see if others have run into this similar problem and have any recomendations for other products or solutions.
my roommate just bought a mac airport router -- not sure if this is better but willing to try anything at this point to get and stay online!
any thoughts...?
