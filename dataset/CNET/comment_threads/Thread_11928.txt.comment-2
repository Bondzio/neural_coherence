Apparently the iMac will perform a little better with matching pair of memory modules.
I doubt you will notice the difference in everyday use.
Get the Single 1Gb and later you will be able to get the second on and have a matching pair.
I don't know what the Bench marks are for the different configurations but I'm guessing that unless you are doing something really RAM intensive, it will not show.
Good luck P
