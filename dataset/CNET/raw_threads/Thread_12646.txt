To date I have run this wired to my router (a D-LINK DSL-2680) but as I now have a multitude of other (potentially) wireless devices, such as games players etc I wanted to re-rig to run wireless. I have two old redundant (generic) desktops both with ASUS boards and PCI cards installed. I took one of the cards out (a Belkin G) to use but the motherboard ports are different? No amount of google etc has indicated when they or if they changed. I realise having read elsewhere on CNET that I could use a USB adapter (but which one?) but the consensus seems to favour a card. I am a simple soul and your advice would be appreciated; greatly!

And the time has passed where I used to skip USB sticks. Why not something like I use? Example at link. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037G2BMY/ It's about 10 bucks and on Windows 7 I don't have to find the drivers. And even if it notes 54 megabit, the sticks I've received are N compatible. Bob

Hi Bob The same item is available via Amazon on this side of the pond; so I have taken your advice and ordered. At &#163;5.54 which is as near as dam it $10 that will do for me, and got to be worth a punt. Thanks for the heads up regards Richard
