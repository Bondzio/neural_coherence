<s> Hello Friends, I have a problem which I want to discuss with you, I had to find out answer of a question: Are these wireless networks capable enough to completely replace wired networks in future. </s>
<s> I have goggled it and come to a conclusion NO as they have serious setbacks related to speed security etc. </s>
<s> Whats your opinion?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Are they capable (enough) NOW to replace wired networks IN THE FUTURE? </s>
<s> That's like asking if a 5 year old is capable (enough) NOW to become president of the usa IN THE FUTURE. </s>
<s> And why did you have to find out? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Are you including all systems such as cellular? </s>
<s> And without going into the physics or designs why wouldn't I use the right tool for the job? </s>
<s> For example I would not put the video file I need to edit on a wireless NAS. </s>
<s> I could guess the unseasoned beginner might do that. </s>
