But i would like to just say thank you to all others who have helped me in the past.

With so many needing help this gets the usual out of the way. If you need personal service then pay for it. This is free so help others by using the sticky so we get to help more folk. There are a few that consider this rude but I can't imagine why. Do tell! Bob

The forum preferred setup is in the posts at the top of http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?threadID=264135&tag=forums06;forum-threads WEP is well known to cause the issues you are seeing. Also the forum preferred settings work to avoid other common problems. If you want to discuss your setup, PLEASE post the details. Unlike paid support you have to pitch in and help others help you. Bob
