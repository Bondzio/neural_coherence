rather than upgrading your obsolete pc, you should consider a computer like the hp a1100e.
this is their base system, and it costs $250.
spend another $70 on the 160 gig hd (from hp), and buy another 256 mb of ram from newegg.com.
this computer will blow away what you have right now, and you will not need to upgrade for a couple of years.
if you are happy with your periphrals, you should not buy any new ones.
perhaps consider an 80 gig hd, rather than 160. it will save you $$$, and it's still 4 times bigger than what you have.
it would take a true music/ photo junkie to fill a 160 gig hd.
but if you have the $$$, go for the 160. just a thought.
