i am planning on buying a new dell optiplex 980 computer (finally).
the computer choice is fairly easy till i get to the gpu.
planning on getting something like corel draw, but i haven't used any more hardcore programs of this type yet, so i have no idea what to look for.
one configuration is an i5 760 with a 1gb nvidia gt330.
there are other more gpus offered, but to get a better choice of more &quot;pro&quot; oriented cards, i have to look more at a precision line for more money.
does the combo i'm looking decent for running something like cd?
the main thing is i don't want to spend all the money on a box where the mobo won't accept a useable card.
thanks!
