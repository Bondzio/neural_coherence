i cannot find a picture at the ati site for the ati radeon x1600 pro (512 mb) video card.
in the spec, it says &quot;dual-link dvi&quot;, but on page  it certainly does not look as if there are two dvi-i output connectors on the card.
however, on page  where model 256 mb was reviewed, it clearly shows two dvi-i output connectors (no picture where cnet reviews the 512 mb model; further, it does not seem as if the 256 mb model is sold anymore).
does anyone know if there are two or only one dvi-i outlet connector on the 5212 mb mocel?
thanks for reply.
