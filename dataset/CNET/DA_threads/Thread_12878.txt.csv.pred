1.1.1	Hello .	St
1.1.2	Currently I have a network with internet access on 4 computers via a router .	St
1.1.3	Recently I aquired a twisted network cable , and am now in the process of making a network between a fifth computer with one of the computers in the normal network .	St
1.1.4	I have managed to find the other computers on this fifth one , but I have no Internet access on it .	St
1.1.5	The fifth computer is connected to its host with a manual IP config on both computers , this makes it find the network , but can I somehow then make this computer find the internet via its host somehow ?	Ques
1.1.6	I also want the computers on the normal network to find this fifth computer , but not even the host finds it .	St
1.1.7	Both computers use Windows XP Home and have the same network card : IA PCI 10/100Mb Fast Ethernet Adapter .	St
1.1.8	Also , the fifth computer is newly reformated , so it might possibly be missing any program/update .	St
1.1.9	Thankful for any help .	St

1.2.1	You have to install ICS and all the issues and setup nuttiness that comes with it .	St
1.2.2	The real cheap fix is to add a switched hub to your router to add more ports .	St

1.3.1	Thank you for the answer .	St
1.3.2	It does sound quite complicated and I have spent enough time trying to fix it now .	St
1.3.3	I will stop attempting to get Internet on it , and go with my original plan to just set it up so it can be reached from the network , and be used as a file storage/backup center .	St
1.3.4	One question about this , I do n't seem to find it from the other network .	St
1.3.5	And now I can only find and access the host computer from it .	St
1.3.6	Is there any particular settings that is needed to be done ?	Ques
1.3.7	I have the pc to pc network setup as static IP , and the router network as Dynamic IP , can these two networks stil find each other ?	Ques
1.4.1	It 's not easy to setup and in fact so rough that I will not offer any how-to 's in the forum .	St
1.4.2	Adding the hub is the real answer unless you have a lot of hair to spare .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I really should have looked up how this would work before I started with it , but due to lack of time , and having done a simple network with coiled cable before , I thought it the best solution .	St
1.5.2	Anyway , I will find some guides and see how it goes .	St
1.5.3	If it goes bad , I will just have to kick myself a few times and go get a bigger router or something .	St
1.5.4	Thanks again for the answers , it has saved me a lot of time and I now know what to look for .	St
1.6.1	The & quot ; SWITCHED HUB & quot ; is all that 's needed to add more ports .	St
1.6.2	How cheap can it be ?	Ques
1.6.3	Under 10 bucks at http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=FS5005C & cat=NET Read	St
