No profit mate, i wanted to know some things about my PC fans as well as the rest of its problems.
especially why Bios is stating system fan is at 0 RPM readings.
But moving on to my main problem, i will see what google says about i845 boards and BAD CAPS.
About power supply box, i had it changed a year back and repaired couple of months back.
so its not that old.
I didn't understand what you mean by, &quot;leave the cover off until we think we've fixed it.&quot;
