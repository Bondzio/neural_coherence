I went through the installation procedures, and when I first start up the PC, I can see everything up to the Windows loading progress bar screen. But after that, everything goes black. I imagine it could be some configuration problem, but I'm at a loss. BTW, it's not a power supply problem, I have a 500W supply installed. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks

I found a MS support doc that instructed to disable this service (via windows recovery off the CD). So now it just hangs on another service in the boot process. When I don't try safe mode, it exhibits the same problem as before, no problems until after the Windows progress baar screen. I'm at a loss as to what to do, and since I'm not that windows-savvy, I don't want to do anything irreparable. Any suggestions?
