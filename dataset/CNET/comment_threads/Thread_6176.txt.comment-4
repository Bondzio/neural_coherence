came with an ATA drive (regular IDE drive) and will support two of them.
Each one should not exceed 120GB because the LBA used on this series will not support anything higher than 127GB.
As for the first part of the question, put it back where it was and leave it alone.
If the machine is still running correctly, great.
As a matter of curiosity, how did the two pieces become separated?
