<s> The drive has been clicking for about 3 weeks now. </s>
<s> I've moved all files to a new drive, so no fear of losing data. </s>
<s> My question is, if the drive really is gonna crash, is there any way I can have it happen within the warranty period so I can have it replaced? </s>
<s> From my experience, all comp parts tend to fail just after passing the warranty period! </s>
<s> Most have drive diagnostic programs you can download and run. </s>
<s> If a problem is found, a failure code is generated and you can often request an RMA on line. </s>
<s> Here is an excellent video explaining the classic 'HDD click of death' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbq8vfs1wYY </s>
