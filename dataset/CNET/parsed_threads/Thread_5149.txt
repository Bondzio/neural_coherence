<s> i have accidentally lifted the lever seating my cpu while working on my pc. </s>
<s> I put the lever back down. </s>
<s> Will i need to properly seat my cpu again with thermal paste or will it be ok. everything seems to be working fine but i can't help thinking it is a little slower or am i just being paranoid!? </s>
<s> Idle core temp is 52 deg c 125F on an AMD 64 3000+ with standard heatsink and fan on an MSI K8N Neo motherboard. </s>
<s> Don't know what the temp was before. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> Think of it as a sandwich with the CPU on the bottom. </s>
<s> fan - heatsink - cpu The thermal paste is between the cpu and the heatsink (think mayo). </s>
<s> When the lever is down, the socket clamps snugly on the processor pins. </s>
<s> When you lift the lever, it unclamps the pins, and does not necessarily shift the heatsink with respect to the cpu. </s>
<s> So, unless there was movement, you don't need to replace the mayo...er, uh, thermal paste. </s>
<s> The ultimate test is as you implied; if the cpu temp is too high, then replace it. </s>
<s> Also, check your fan speed. </s>
<s> CPU temp is also a relative thing. </s>
<s> if your system temp is 30*C, 52*C (resting) might be a little high, but if your system temp is &gt; 40*C, 52*C is not unreasonable. </s>
<s> Thanks man. </s>
<s> you've put my mind at rest. </s>
<s> I like that comparison!!! </s>
<s> If you do have to repalce the paste, go easy on the Mayo. </s>
