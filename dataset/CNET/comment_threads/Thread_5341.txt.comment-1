I bought myself a 1 GB stick of RAM for an old Tower I had been using, but it has since died (I'm hoping the RAM stick didn't have anything to do with it...).
I believe the RAM is DDR 1.
So I'm wondering, if I go and buy myself a new 3 GB equipped computer that uses DDR3 and I put the old stick in one of it's spare slots... will that helpmate computer in any way?
Or would it just hinder it?
