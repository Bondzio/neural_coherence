I have an internet access by cable connected to my workstation, and everything was fine.
Then i got a server (actually an usual computer: P4 3.0HT, ASUS P4P800-X, 1GB DDR, 2x100Mbps NIC), set up the Win2003 Server and configured Routing&Remote access, so i had i small network.
Then i discovered the speed was decreased when surfing internet.
Made a speed test on server, it shows 600-900kbps, then plug a cable into workstation, and test result was 2000-2200kbps.
The NIC on server are ok, replaced with new one.
Routing&remote acces was turned off when testing, no network applications& extra services running.
What may be the problem?
What can cause Windows Server to decrease the speed?
