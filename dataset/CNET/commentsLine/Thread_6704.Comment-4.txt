the usb drivesr are usually supplied by the &quot;mtrbd.
chipset&quot; driver set.
it may or not actually show as usb driver, but it is as the chipsets is obviously suppling the usb ports.
since, it seems you think the frt.
usb ports are bad, be 100% sure that the cable that is supplied to the frt.
panel is properly seated and in the right place.
at least reseat that wire harness, you have to open case and inspect and verify.
there is the chance if you had a bad usb device, you blew the usb ports to include static(esd) damage.
improper plugging in/out can also dirty the ports, so be sure they're clean as well also any physical damage.
as for video, you need to verify what video card, just what is it.
installing driver for another or mis-id'ed video card is going to cause issues.
if those oem(vendor supplied) discs are improper or wrong driver then having the true video model#, etc.
to get the driver from the maker's support website is a must to know.
download those and install the proper driver.
i can't explain any better than that.
though, in many cases you maybe getting the driver install suite which supports a class of products using ?-video chip whatever.
rather than installing from the device mgr., you allow the .exe file to do all and follow the procedure to better install.
