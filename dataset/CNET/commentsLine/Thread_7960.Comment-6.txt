computers is you don't have to worry about hardware mismatches and warranties.
and you've got that support on their websites, which nowadays is often a live chat.
if you build your own, you run the risk of getting jipped and making mistakes that could cost you a lot of money.
computers nowadays aren't at all what they were 10 years ago.
i don't mean that in the speed and technology sense, but in the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; sense too.
those complete brand name systems offer consumers a no hassle, no nonsense, high quality alternative to the run around and being shafted by people who just want your money.
compaq may have a faster video card, sound card, more memory, and faster chip for you on their web site that could cost you a lot less than a new computer.
