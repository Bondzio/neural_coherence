if the notches match, that's a good sign.
investigate (google) each ram module to learn its type and size.
i would only insert pc133 ram modules.
some pc100 modules may work in that motherboard.
for me, it would be worth it to try some modules in that slot.
why?
that is an older computer and i wouldn't care if something were to go wrong.
plus, i don't invest in pc100 or pc133 ram these days.
i would only upgrade that machine if i happened upon &quot;a box of old ram.&quot; happy hunting!
