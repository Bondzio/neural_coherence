thanks bob, i guess one problem with buying a dell is their funky proprietary mobos and psus that seem to limit the choice of gpus (enough acronyms?).
i'm looking at dells because i think their pro support is decent and this being for work, i want someone i can rely on to call for support and get it fixed quick should something go haywire.
