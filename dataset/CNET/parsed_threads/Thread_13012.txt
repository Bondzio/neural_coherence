<s> I have a D-Link DIR-450 wireless router that I am using to &quot;attempt&quot; to set up a wireless network in my home. </s>
<s> I have a desktop that is hooked up with a cat-5 cable and am having no issues there. </s>
<s> The Verizon broadband card is a little slow, but hey, that's Verizon for you. </s>
<s> The issue is with the laptop... </s>
<s> I am trying to set it up wireless, but can only seem to be able to do this WITHOUT any encryption. </s>
<s> The second I try to secure the router, the Gateway MX6453 laptop is permanently &quot;Acquiring Network Address.&quot; I have made sure I am using the correct passphrase, WEP key, etc. </s>
<s> No kind of encryption will work. </s>
<s> This does not put the warm fuzzies in my tummy... </s>
<s> The wireless card in the laptop is a Broadcon802.11g network adapter. </s>
<s> Help. </s>

<s> And tell us about your setup of the router. </s>
<s> What would you like to know? </s>
<s> I am relatively new at this, so plese bear with me. </s>
<s> Right now, no encryption, I have a valid SSID, Channel scan enabled, Super G disabled (tried different configs here, to no effect), Hidden Wireless is Disabled. </s>
<s> I have DHCP enabled with the proper Mac address and name of the laptop setup in the router. </s>
<s> I did nothing to &quot;Virtual server,&quot; &quot;Port Forwarding,&quot; &quot;Application Rules,&quot; or &quot;Network Filter.&quot; I am Confused... </s>
<s> Could Norton have something to do with this? </s>
<s> &quot;Right now, no encryption, I have a valid SSID, Channel scan enabled&quot; When the router is setup like that and you change the laptop to WPA then it shouldn't connect. </s>
<s> In short, the two must match. </s>
