if anyone out there has successfully done this please tell us how.
i have been trying to use the instructions at apcmag.com but have failed miserably.
my specific questions are 1) can it be done if your xp disc is pre sp2.
i have the sp on a separate disc?
2) can xp be installed on the 2nd hard drive?
3) how is the install done?
-i have tried to boot from cd and after a few minutes just get an error message.
4) are there any problems, flaws, cons w/ doing a dual boot?
i, as well as many others, can not stand vista.
please help!
