thanks for the reply.
i have tried most of what you are recommending.
i toggled the fn key with f2 with no result.
i also tried the repair process but the outcome is still the same message.
i have not run the windows update recently since i have no internet connection.
the laptop has suffered no bumping or other damage.
any other suggestions?
