Hah!
I've got somewhere!
It turns out the BIOS is in fact the culprit!
I started testing out different BIOS's, and when I flashed to the A00 BIOS, voila!
Both 255mb sticks worked, and Memtest86 gave *no* errors!!!
HAH!
Now, I've got to see whether I can begin flashing &quot;upwards&quot; and determine at what point I lose the ability to use both modules!!!
Pretty weird!
