as it is better to stay in budget, you might want to buy an overclocked version for a speed boost.
And then maybe later on throw in another one.
I wouldn't choose the XT because the GS can be had for a little more, and the clocks are different.
If you can save up the cash, go for the GS, if not the GT is fine.

Remember: You can always OC the cards, unlock pipelines, and even throw in another.
