the only way we can use our motorola router is unencrypted.
i have gone into the router numerous times and reset it, unplugged it, retyped the wep key, tried to shift to wpa and nothing works.
none of three computers in the house will connect unless all encryption is off.
we live in a good neighborhood on a cul de sac, don't get a lot of traffic through here, and know the immediate neighbors, but nothing is stopping a stranger with a laptop from sitting on the street and using our wifi.
i've talked to the comcast tech.
the trouble just seems to be our boxes won't get past the wep encryption stage.
has anyone had this problem?
