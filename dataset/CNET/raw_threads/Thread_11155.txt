DO NOT REPAIR THIS PRINTER!!! Repair costs will exceed the 65 bucks this printer might be found for. YES!!! These printers last about 2 years. If it fails at or after 2 years what many do is curse HP buy another brand, then that breaks in 2 years they curse that brand and try another. In about 10 years they'll get it. Bob
