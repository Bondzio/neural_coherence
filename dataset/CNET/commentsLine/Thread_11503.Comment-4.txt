i always hate these boxes that say just push a button and it works.
if you can't make it work using wps then you do it the old school way and configure it with ethernet cable like any other extender.
if it still does not work then you need to consider it is broken.
it could be as simple as wps is disabled on your router..... note it is strongly recommended you leave wps disabled and only enable for a tiny period of time when you need it.
there is a fundamental design flaw that allows a hacker to get access to any router with this enabled.
