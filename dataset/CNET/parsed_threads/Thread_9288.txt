<s> My external hard drive is not working, i have a 1 year product warrenty with the manufacture that has not expired, i lost my receipt..... i was giving up till i found out that my friend bought the same product around the same time, he still has his receipt. </s>
<s> should i inform the manufacture saying that i want my hd to be fixed and send a copy of my friends receipt? </s>
<s> Some have succeeded that way. </s>
