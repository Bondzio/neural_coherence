1.1.1	Hello , thank you for taking the time to read and help me with my question .	Polite
1.1.2	I 've slowly been buying parts for my new computer build over the weeks and I just tried putting it together last night to no avail .	St
1.1.3	After assembled correctly , ( all wiring checked and rechecked ) , The power button immediately starts every fan in the system ( All 5 casefans , psu fan , cpu heatsink fan , gpu fan ) but I hear no sounds similar to that of the actual computer starting .	St
1.1.4	The monitor stops displaying *No signal* when I plug it in , and it 's light just goes orange .	St
1.1.5	Nothing plugged into usb ports will light up ( Mouse/usb storage ) .	St
1.1.6	There are no beep codes during any of this and I am seriously perplexed .	St
1.1.7	System specs- Foxconn AMD AM3 Mobo - ATX 16GB Ripjaws RAM ( Only one 4gb stick inserted for test ) Sapphire Radeon HD 6850 GPU ( Unplugged and sat aside after first test , no difference in result ) 650 watt Antec PSU AMD Phenom II X4 3.8ghz Processor SATA 500GB Laptop HDD ( Test purposes only , hav n't bought the one I want yet .	St
1.1.8	This has Windows 7 already installed onto it . )	St
1.1.9	I would appreciate if anyone could look at this and give me any fresh input , it 's very discouraging .	St
1.2.1	I would install more ram , to make a & quot ; bank & quot ; that refers to at least 2 slots , find what makes bank 0 or bank 1 as the numbers start .	St
1.2.2	next , SORRY but no you ca n't have pre-installed Win7 on a HD and expect it to boot .	St
1.2.3	if the mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	and such were the same as what you 're working it may have booted or error out .	St
1.2.5	In your case , Win7 will remind at a fault level , you have to install Win7 to that system as in fresh install .	St
1.2.6	if your mtrbd .	St
1.2.7	has only USB ports for the kybd .	St
1.2.8	and mouse , leave as is for now .	St
1.2.9	Next , using your Win7 or any windoze install disc , use that to see if it will boot .	St
1.2.10	You will need to verify the 1st boot device is CD drive from the bios setting and save upon exit .	St
1.2.11	-OR- depending on your PC setup if it asks from a boot menu where to boot , again that 's a feature of your bios .	St
1.2.12	I do n't know if that is possible or applicable to your current PC , so check .	St
1.2.13	DON & quot ; T take anything for granted , recheck and verify and what i stated in this post should apply .	St
1.2.14	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I actually just unplugged the CPU and tried reseating it a few times , but I get the same result ( I also Tried the RAM idea , different choices between the 4 sticks on different tests ) Without the CPU in at all I get the exact response , no real computer action but all fans immdiately power on and whirr loudly .	St
1.3.2	This makes me think it 's the CPU because every one of the fans are working , even the GPU fan/ PSU fan , and Heatsink fan , but no actual computing is happening .	St
1.3.3	I ca n't even get to the bios , and that 's what concerns me , Without the CPU , would the Mobo load it 's bios ?	Ques
1.3.4	It just seems like there are n't any POST or beep codes at all .	St
1.3.5	Either way I 've just RMA 'd the CPU to Newegg and hope to get a replacement for this soon .	St
1.3.6	I 'll be back replying on any help I get here after The processor is fresh and I can try it again .	St
1.3.7	Thanks Willy for taking the time	St
