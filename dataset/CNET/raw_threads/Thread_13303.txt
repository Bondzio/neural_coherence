Ok so I'm no expert with gaming and computers but I heard that single core chips are good for handling GPUs. My PC is a 5 year old Dimension with a pentium4 @ 1.47Ghz. If I added the appropriate GPU, sound card, etc. could I keep the chip that I have and just overclock it?

Specs at http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4500S/specs.htm#1101572 But I see the killer issue here. It's running on the i845 chipset and SDRAM. While that was a fine value solution back then, this is a DRAG CHUTE on performance of the CPU. Do not invest more than a &quot;value meal&quot; into this box. Bob
