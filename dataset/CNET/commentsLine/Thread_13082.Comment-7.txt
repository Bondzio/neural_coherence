even though mcafee firewall my look fine, you should still disable it just to make sure.
you never want 2 firewalls or 2 antivirus programs running at the same time so disable 1 firewall.
please review this document on print and files sharing with vista.
network connections should show 2 types of connections.
one is your wireless and the other local connection is for a hard wired ethernet connection.
the hardware local connection should show that it is disconnected at this point unless you plug your laptop directly into your network.
some people may even disable the local connection if they want.
