in a word......nothing.
ide 1: hard drive: disconnected from board and power, nothing.
ide 2: cd drive: disconnected as above, still nothing.
both at once: disconnected as above, lots more of nothing........ even tried the floppy as that is one of the components that survived the frying of the original cd drive.
even more nothingness!
thanks for your help with this btw.
