hi i am the same person whom you answered in the win xp forum about the sata drivers.
both hd's are ide when i plug in my maxtor hard drive with my cd both are recognised when i plug in my western digital hard drive with my cd drive neither are recognised however this hard drive is recognised by itself when the cd drive is not connected.
so i feel that this one hard drive (western digital) which is only being recognised by itself has a problem.
any solutions please.
i tried using jumpers.
i only have one ide connector.
i need to get this working so i can install windows on it.
please assist
