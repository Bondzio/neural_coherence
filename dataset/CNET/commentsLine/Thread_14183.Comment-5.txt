i bought my ti99-4a in 1983. it was so cool!
32k (yes k) of ram, built in os and basic plus a color display.
(well it was color if you hooked it up to a color television) in all honesty, it was pretty darn cool for 1983. at first i only had cassette tape for storage.
but soon i got a single sided single density 5.25 in floppy drive.
i had a multiplan spreadsheet cartridge and actually tracked financial information with it.
i used the ti99-4a for several years for entertainment and real work.
i finally replaced it with a 286 that ran dos in 1988.
