if you only have one stick now then obviously you don't need to buy them in pairs, but you are better off using pairs with most motherboard that support pc3200 memory, since it will run the bus at higher speed and improve overall performance.
you give us no idea about the hardware (motherboard) you are putting this in, which makes it impossible for us to really give you good advice.
in your case you would be much better off buying one more 512meg stick if your bios will support dual memory and the higher bus speed.
to buy 2 more would be absurd since you only have 1 now.
buying 2 would still leave you with the lower bus speed since you would not have 2 sets of matching pairs, which is what gives you the ability to run at higher bus speed.
matching pairs doesn't required identical memory, just identical spec memory.
