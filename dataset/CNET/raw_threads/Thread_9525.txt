14811	0	281024	2686431	NR	Dr.DG	1/23/08 6:45 AM	1.2010707E12	VPN and Routing	A Windows XP user is connected to the Internet through LAN with static addressing (192.168.0.0/24). He connects to a corporate LAN (192.168.1.0/24) using VPN (PPTP) and gets a dynamic IP from a corporate DHCP server. Question: is it possible to access the user's LAN from the corporate LAN through this PPTP connection? If yes, where and how should the routing be set up? Thank you.
