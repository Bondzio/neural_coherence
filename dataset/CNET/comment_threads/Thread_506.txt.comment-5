If you have all the power supply components properly plugged in (main power connector on MB, 12v connector if Intel and power on switch connected to proper pins on MB) try watching the PS fan while you switch things on.
If it sort of twitches and stops, this means it is trying to turn on but has detected a load problem.
Usually something is shorted.
It could be the MB to the chassis due to a hidden mounting post still under the MB.
It could be an improperly seated component.
You can also check to see if your MB has an LED on it to indicate presense of the control voltage needed to turn on the other PS circuits.
If LED is not working, there is no power to MB.
Keep checking and good luck.
