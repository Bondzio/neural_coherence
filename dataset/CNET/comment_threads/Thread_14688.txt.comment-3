Hello, Thanks for your reply...
Tried the Radeon 9600 with and without tape...no luck.
Even if we are talking about only one card (ie:Radeon 9600 or 9800 pro) there appears to be more than one version of the same card which appears to have some physical difference...The most definitive information with regards to hunting for the right card appears to be the part # located on the back of the card (ie: with the correct pin configuration, etc.)...
And apparently, there are some issues with the Radeon 9600 and Quicksilver G4 800 Dual I did read the thread you suggested regarding other cards...I'd like to find a card with 256mb of memory... Any additional advice you have to offer is most welcome...Thanks...
