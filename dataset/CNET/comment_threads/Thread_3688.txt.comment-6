&quot;I would be able to keep the wired USB connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem?
?&quot; You should be good to go, except for the statement that the wireless laptop will connect via ethernet.
The ethernet standard (802.3) is primarily used with CAT5 cabling, while a wireless connection (802.11) is just that.
