My choices are a 250gb 5400 hd and a 200gb 7200 rpm hard drive for about $35 more. Is the speed of the 7200 fast enough to really make a big difference to my system to compensate for less space?

Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
