Hi guys, I am having problem with a Dell laptop having WinXP Sp3,and when I plug in my ethernet cable into this laptop ,the local area network connection icon in my laptop stays busy geting tcp/ip configuration but doesnot get it and then it gets a messege of &quot;limited and no connectivity&quot;.But this same ethernet cable is working fine on my dell dekstop computer having WinXP.
Why am I having problem with this ethernet cable on my laptop?
Could it be an issue of virus or spyware?
I have already scanned my laptop using Avast and found no threat.
Can you guys please help me.
