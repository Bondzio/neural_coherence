The Nexus has the edge on the Kindle as there are more book readers there and you don't have as closed an ecosystem. Games are a few more too. But for Amazon Prime Video the Fire 7 HD is hard to beat as we have ours connected to the HDTV with HDMI. It's the best player I've seen in years. Tough choice but I like the fact the Nexus is more open and still has the Kindle app. Bob
