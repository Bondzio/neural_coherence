strange.
while i've yet to go to italy, i've found common stuff like that in all countries.
guess there's less hot air there?
i'd look at a pc or computer shop for such but at a camera shop i could find this thing:  as to similar cases?
over the years, a few thousand.
however you have to think it's good for the industry folk don't care for the computers.
keeps the industry in business.
