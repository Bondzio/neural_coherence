<s> I recently built a new machine. </s>
<s> The processors I chose was an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core, 5200+. </s>
<s> Up until yesterday, everything was fine. </s>
<s> I was running at optimal processor speed and when I checked Properties of My Computer, it reported as much. </s>
<s> Today, I logged in and checked Properties of My Computer for a totally seperate reason and saw that the CPU was being reported as running at 996MHz instead of the usualy 2.6GHz. </s>
<s> My mobo came with a utility that I can run to dynamically bump the speed of my CPU up, but I am reluctant to try it, as I have no experience overclocking. </s>
<s> What could cause this change? </s>
<s> Should I be concerned about it? </s>
<s> Should I make the change in the utility I have, or is there another utility I can use? </s>
<s> Please help, Eric </s>
<s> Modern CPUs run at variable speeds. </s>
<s> Investigate AMD Cool'n'Quiet technology if you want more information on what it does and how to disable it. </s>
