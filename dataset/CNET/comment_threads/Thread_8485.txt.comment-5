Like Bob said.

Unless you open the DMZ on that router, you're safe.
Don't get too paranoid.
And some port scanning software/web sites will try to sell you something to close those ports.
When I tried that site it wanted to set a cookie.
Why?
I don't know, and I denied it and I won't be back.
BTW, there are almost 40,000 ports on a PC.
Are you gonna try to close them all?
Please, don't worry about it.
