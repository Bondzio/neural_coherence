I bought a Buffalo hds-ph320u2-us external hard drive that requires a password to mount, but this hard drive does not support Mac OS X 10.6 and later. It works on my Windows 7 pc and i know that I can access it through VMWare or BootCamp, but I want a way to access it without any of those. Is it possible to bypass or format the external hard drive so I don't need to enter a password in order to mount it on my Mac?
