thank you guys.
that was quite useful piece of information.
i have the time to try different things, because i will do it at work.
and even if that was not the case, i don't get that much of a salary.
2 days to make it work will cost me less than a new mb .
i'm 100% sure that the beeping and the cpu work fine so i'll try the beeping test .
