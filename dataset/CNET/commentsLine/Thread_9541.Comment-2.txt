the best way: format that disk and get the files from your backup.
if you don't have a backup (why not?)
try the software from  start with the free, then the free to try, then the paid software and finally find a datarecovery company if the worth of the data is more than what they charge.
note that any recovery software that fails to retrieve the data can make it more difficult for the next program you try.
so the very first thing to do is to make a clone of that drive to another drive and work on the copy.
