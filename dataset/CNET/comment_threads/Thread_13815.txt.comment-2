Choice of monitor (CRT or LCD) is irrelevant for performance and independent of old or new PC.
All you need to do, in my opinion: 1. clean install of the OS (including formatting the disk) 2. add a second (internal!)
hard disk if you really need more disk space (#1 tends to free a lot of space because all kinds of rubbish is deleted, but - of course - you might have 60 Gb of music and photo's that you restore and then it's full again) There's absolutely nothing wrong with 1 Gb and a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 for Windows XP, and no reason why it should be slower than it was when it was new.
