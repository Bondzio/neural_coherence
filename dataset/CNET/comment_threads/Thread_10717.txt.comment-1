What is the best way to set up a home network if you have the following: 1 desktop (Windows XP use primarily for work.
This one has a 1 TB external hard drive added to it) 2 laptops (Windows Vista on both, his and hers) 1 desktop (Windows XP, connected to home theater, used for multi media stuff primarily, hulu, internet radio, etc.
As you can see, I am not a technical person.
Is there a software or step by step configuration you can guide me through/to?
