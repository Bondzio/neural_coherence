1.3.1	Just one suggestion out of the dozens of good websites that will help you build your first PC: http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reports/article.php/3580681 Also, Newegg is great at helping you determine component compatibility.	St
1.4.1	these: http://www.overclockers.com.au/wiki/Power_Supply_Unit yes the PSU is important enough to get its own guide (hint hint) www.newegg.com is a good resource for buying parts www.zipzoomfly.com is also a good resource for buying parts I'd also look at: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/build-a-computer.htm mostly because it has videos that show you how to do everything	St
