<s> I'm a college student almost ready to begin my junior year. </s>
<s> I'm also somewhat of a gaming enthusiast and would like very much to dive deeper into that hobby. </s>
<s> The catch is, for the past two years I've been using an HP Pavillion notebook (1.8GHz Celeron, 40gig HD, 447mb RAM, Radeon IGP 340M). </s>
<s> It's turned out to be a real workhorse and has kept up with me admirably, but it's limits are now readily apparent. </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong, it plays some of my favorite games (Rainbow Six 3, Star Trek: Bridge Commander, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), but with newer titles like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, The Sims 2 and Half Life 2, my hands are tied. </s>
<s> Space is also another issue. </s>
<s> I've got a large MP3 collection, download mods for my games and occasionally I'll download music videos/movies. </s>
<s> The space problem has gotten to the point where I recently had to go out and buy an 80gig portable hard drive. </s>
<s> I started computer shopping two months back, keeping important factors like price and expandability in mind. </s>
<s> Two weeks ago, I found the perfect machine; an HP Pavillion (a1034n) with a 3GHz P4, 200Gig Hard Drive, 1 Gig of Ram and a Multi Format DVD-ROM/CD-ROM drive. </s>
<s> Yesterday however, Best Buy pulled the machine from their lineup. </s>
<s> Now, I'm forced to fall back onto my second choice. </s>
<s> It's an HP Pavillion, with the same exact specs as the other machine, except this happens to be a 'Photosmart/Media Center' PC (mod. </s>
<s> m1264n). </s>
<s> http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=320291&pfp=BROWSE Barring any major financial disasters, I should have enough to get this within the next month-month and a half. </s>
<s> For moderate gaming plus day to day stuff (word processing, internet etc.) </s>
<s> I'm thinking this will be a pretty solid investment (esp. </s>
<s> since I'm on a somewhat limited budget), but what does everyone else think? </s>
<s> Comments/Tips/Suggestions would be appreciated as well as comments from people who've actually dealt with this model or similar ones like it =) **Keep in mind, since I'm looking to get deeper into gaming, I'll definitly be upgrading the onboard video/audio setup** </s>
<s> Build your own if possible. </s>
<s> Don't suggest it if possible, no pci-express i think, nor 64-bit. </s>
<s> Get the gateway http://www.compusa.com/products/products.asp?cmid=topnav&N=200005+400756+4294965871&Ne=303930 </s>
<s> the gpu. </s>
<s> it has integrated, which although it is possible to game on,(check intels website and look for the compatability list) you will not get very high frame rates. </s>
<s> it DOES have pcie so i would say get a nvidia 6600gt since you dont have to much money to spare. </s>
<s> it has a good cpu, good sata, 1GB of ram upgradeable to 4GB of DDR2 which is good. </s>
<s> everything is about media and music like you requested, so nice job picking a good machine. </s>
<s> just upgrade the gpu to 6600gt or higher and you will be gaming away. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> Sorry, but no pci-express slot http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?dlc=en&lc=en&product=471588&dest_page=product&cc=us&docname=c00361570 . </s>
<s> Check out the one i recommended. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> go with the gateway, upgrade the gpu to the card i recomended and you will have a 64 bit pc ready for the future of gaming. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> Okay, the lack of a PCI express slot bummed me out, but ahh well. </s>
<s> I went back to Best Buy's website and found a Gateway that slightly outperformed that HP I was talking about. </s>
<s> The specs of this machine (mod. </s>
<s> 830GM) are basically the same, except the P4 Processor uses Intel's &quot;EM64T&quot; technology which basically means it 64-bit compatable. </s>
<s> It's also slightly more expensive, but if this is indeed a good machine, than I think I'll spring for it. </s>
<s> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7131089&type=product&productCategoryId=cat01172&id=1110263403701 And as for the graphics upgrade, I'm either gonna go with an X850 XT P.E. </s>
<s> or a 6800 Ultra. </s>
<s> By the time I get enough money together (months and months down the line), ATI & nVidia's new chips should push the prices of those two I mentioned, down to a more reasonable level. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> good pc, gateways support is superb. </s>
<s> you are right about the gpu prices falling, thats what im waiting for. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> I already recommended that in my first post... Don't think you can get much of a gfx update without a psu upgrade, and not sure if its propritary so might just get a 6600gt, nothing like the 6800ultra or other power consuming chips. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> that power supply is 100% atx compatable, it is the exact same mechanism used on the 820gm, e.g. </s>
<s> my pc which i upgraded to an antec true 480. so you are safe unlike dell konny </s>
<s> So you're saying I'll have to shell out an extra couple bucks for a higher wattage power source before I go and upgrade? </s>
<s> If so, how high should I go (to accomidate a high end card) ?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> anything higher than a nvidia geforce 6600gt will require a new power supply. </s>
<s> (6800 series and 7800 series) ati, anything from the x800 series, including the xl will require a new power supply. </s>
<s> i bought an antec true 480 for $120 at frys, but they fell in price by a lot. </s>
<s> i would go anything above 400 watts. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> I would reccommend switching off of hp and going to a company like dell or emachines they preform better and are worth the price you pay, HP's technology becomes outdated quickly and is never that great in the first place. </s>
<s> HP/Compaq try to turn out as many new systems as they can in a year and that lowers the overall quality of each system. </s>
<s> I highly reccommend purchasing a dell or emachines system, on the other hand there is alwasy the custom option. </s>
<s> Buy the parts and assemble it your self or pay some one to do it. </s>
<s> Check the reply entitled 'What About This One?' </s>
<s> I have already switched off of HP/Compaq and have moved to Gateway, with eMachines as a distant second </s>
<s> I was out doing some comparison shopping & what not today and found this same machine on sale at Nebraska Furniture Mart (local midwest retailer) for $739......a whole $140 cheaper than Best Buy. </s>
<s> You can get a Fortron AX-500a Blue Storm for 78 bucks shipped, Very nice Psu. </s>
<s> Dual rails, Sheilded cables and Fortron is one of the few PSU builders that actually under rate their PSU's. </s>
<s> Mine is solid as a rock and if you check around you will find that Forton's are indeed a quality PSU. </s>
<s> I can't seem to find it at this Nebraska Furniture Mart. </s>
<s> Do you have a link (URL) that we can look at? </s>
