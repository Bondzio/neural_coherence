<s> I want to build a new PC and am looking for suggestions for specs and specific brands of motherboards etc. </s>
<s> Also where have you had the best luck purchasing components. </s>
<s> I am not a gamer nor do I do a lot of high end processing and don't need a top of line speed or high end video. </s>
<s> Prob a dual core. </s>
<s> Want to do 2 hard drives. </s>
<s> 1 for the OS (may want to do a dual boot) and 1 for evything else. </s>
<s> Suggestions appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> since you &quot;not a gamer&quot; and don't &quot;do a lot of high end processing&quot;, you won't save any money building one yourself. </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback but that really doesn't answer my question. </s>
<s> I've never built one from bottom up before and want to do it to learn. </s>
<s> So I realize I may pay a little more, but am willing to do so. </s>
<s> And not from forums but places like tomshardware.com </s>
<s> if you can only afford $500. </s>
<s> likewise, why suggest a $800 build if you are willing to pay $1200? </s>
<s> if you just want the pleasure of building a pc, and you don't have any special needs, then realize that it may perform no better than the $400 weekly special (that often come with printer and/or monitor like this one ) but it will likely cost more. </s>
<s> just giving you notice in advance so you don't get a case of buyers (builders) remorse. </s>
<s> here's a $600 build that i suggested for another poster but it's a small form factor (mini sized) since it's intended use is to watch TV: http://my.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=290837&messageID=2747850&tag=mcnt#2747850 </s>
<s> Why not get some PCs from craigslist for free/dirt cheap and just rip them apart and upgrade them? </s>
<s> Good will sells all of their PCs for $15. </s>
<s> I have see a few P3s there and I still use a P3 as my workstation. </s>
<s> (It has 2x15GB IDE drives raided together for a swap file, 512MB Ram, 1x 40gb drive for storage, 1x20gb drive for OS and a DVD burner.) </s>
<s> It isn't a speed demon but with a dedicated video card (free) it runs XP nicely. </s>
<s> Great idea. </s>
<s> I hand't though about that. </s>
