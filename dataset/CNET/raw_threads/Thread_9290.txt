To my knowlede the only recent update to my computer is the upgrading to the latest Norton Systemworks. Very annoying so any help will be greatly appreciated. Col.

Thanks Col.

I did try to roll back with system restore but got an error on that as soon as I opened it telling me that it could not protect my computer and to restart. It seemed to be after this restart that it all worked again. Very Odd!!!!

Look at what you have recently installed - I totally forgot I had installed Microsoft Publisher, it was this program which caused the bug - delete the program - fix the bug. Only problem now is - I want the program - Oh well - such is life!!!!

The real reason, after much searching has turned out to be Norton systemworks 2004!!!! apparently it has issues with any version of nero burning rom earlier than nero 6. as I only 5.5.9 this causes a conflict. Removed systemworks and no longer have the problem. If you also have this problem then either upgrade to nero 6 or remove systemworks. Apparently no one is getting a response from the manufacturers of norton who are burying their heads in the proverbial sand on this problem with their software. Hope this helps anybody else with this issue and btw - cheapest place I have found for nero 6 is e-bay, worth a try.

After 5 versions (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and now 2004), the only reason I see for it is a cheap way to get NAV (which looks like a misfire in 2004) and Disk Doctor. The rest can be done without. Reference http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nunt.nsf/docid/2000120915010309&src=n The same bug continues on in most if not all versions.

If you boot with a floppy all hardware works great. If you boot XP with a CD in the drive you are able to read that CD. The problem seems to be with Nero Burning ROM. (System also has Norton System Works 2004 on it.) I uninstalled the older OEM version of Nero and installed the newer OEM version 5.5.10.53 and everything works great! I really hope this helps someone as it took me a while to figure out what was going on. Good Luck!
