1.1.1	Monitor is Samsung SyncMaster 2253LW and the video card is Gigabyte Radeon 9200.	St
1.1.2	Both have analog and digital ports.	St
1.1.3	Running WinXP Pro, SP3, and the Samsung drivers have been installed.	St
1.1.4	The analog signal works just fine.	St
1.2.1	some monitors don't autoswitch based on the live signal.	St
1.3.1	I don't believe I know where to go to accomplish that.	St
1.3.2	I looked in the BIOS, but didn't see anything there to change, and the cables are terminated differently for DVI, and only use the rectangular fitting.	St
1.4.1	Look in the monitor menu settings, there should be an option, VGA/DVI etc.	St
