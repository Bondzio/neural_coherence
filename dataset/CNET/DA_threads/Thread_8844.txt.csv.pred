1.2.1	& quot ; ca n't broadcast the internet connection from our main computer. & quot ; That 's not a standard setup so it 's unlikely to work .	St

1.5.12	Need any more info ?	Ques
1.6.1	& quot ; The main computer that I 'm on is connected by ethernet to the modem and the router is connected to the cable modem as well. & quot ; You have revealed a key item here but no make/model of the cable modem or router .	St
1.6.2	What I suspect is that this setup is incorrect in some way but without make and model numbers I ca n't supply a working solution .	St
1.6.3	Your choice to tell all or none when asked .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Sorry bout that .	St
1.7.2	The Fonera model is FON 2100 A/B/C .	St
1.7.3	It 's this small , light router with 1 ethernet cable slot .	St
1.8.1	I 'm sad to say that I ca n't solve it given the setup so far .	St
1.8.2	Was I unclear about the questions ?	Ques
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	Do you know of where you could point me that would have more info on what I need help with ?	Ques
1.10.1	I messed up in that I asked for all the parts involved and you doled them out over different replies so it 's more work for me to piece together the setup .	St
1.10.2	RCA DCM425 is your Cable modem .	St
1.10.3	It has no router or other features .	St
1.10.4	The FON 2100 A/B/C is your router .	St
1.10.5	It appears to be quite rare so you 'll have to find the manual for me .	St
1.10.6	Let 's repeat where I see a problem .	St
1.10.7	& quot ; The main computer that I 'm on is connected by ethernet to the modem and the router is connected to the cable modem as well. & quot ; That 's an incorrect setup .	St
1.10.8	If I were to set this up I do this .	St
1.10.9	Cable modem to Router .	St
1.10.10	All PCs and other things connect to the router .	St

1.12.1	I read it twice and you do n't have a valid setup .	St
1.12.2	That is , the Fon device appears to not be a ROUTER .	St
1.12.3	You do n't have a router so you have all but one internet IP address and without a router this device is only good for & quot ; not much. & quot ; When you get a router , please write back since I 've subscribed to this discussion .	St
1.12.4	The proper setup is noted in section B1 and other places which is ... DSL/CABLE MODEM - & gt ; Router - & gt ; PCs and your Fon device .	St
1.12.5	Bob	St
1.13.1	If it helps , I have a D-Link DI-524 router that I 've been having trouble installing and having problems just broadcasting an SSID .	St
1.14.1	The 524 was nearly tossed in the trash the first week I had it .	St
1.14.2	Thankfully new firmware cured that issue you wrote about .	St
1.14.3	HOWEVER ! ! !	St
1.14.4	You do n't need to fix that if you were to follow the instructions FON supplied .	St
1.14.5	But why not fix it ?	Ques
1.14.6	Tell me which version of 524 you have ?	Ques
1.14.7	A , D , C , OR E ?	Ques

1.15.1	Version A	St
1.16.1	We 've spent a lot of back and forths that we could have avoided .	St
1.16.2	Please move forward on your own to tell if your firmware is the latest and if not , please tell me why you did n't .	Sug
1.16.3	If you have old firmware , write when you 'll be replacing this router since I know that as supplied it 's a dud .	St
1.16.4	Bob	St
1.17.1	Remote desktop assistance , email , or IM ?	Ques
1.18.1	There is a chance you did n't ask me if such would work but given the short number of words it 's up to anyone to guess the real question .	St
1.18.2	- & gt ; It took awhile but at the end I see you are oh so close .	St
1.18.3	Bob	St
1.19.1	I 'm having a problem with the Window Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing service .	St
1.19.2	I was trying to install the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter on the desktop and every time I do , I either get an error ( 5 ) or an error ( 6 ) message .	St
1.19.3	Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter depends on the service and I 'm also guessing the D-Link router .	St
1.19.4	When I try to start the Windows Firewall service , which the Wi-Fi adapter depends on , it gives me & quot ; Error 5 : Access is Denied & quot ; message .	St
1.19.5	I found out from here that I have a lot of stuff missing from the protocols section when I look at it in the msinfo32 console when I compared it to my laptop .	St
1.19.6	However , when I installed it on the laptop , it installed fine , no problems , worked mucho bella .	St
1.19.7	I tried to do what it said in this article too to no avail .	St
1.19.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.20.1	http : //support.microsoft.com/default.aspx ? kbid=811259 http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/892199	Ques

1.22.1	I got a FON router when they had their 5 $ /Euro promotion .	St
1.22.2	Strung it into an old D-Link 614+ 802.11b router - into the non-firewalled port designed for a server ( good enough for my DSL speed ) .	St
1.22.3	The public ssid works fine , but I ca n't connect to the private ssid with my PSP ( it also hates my D-Link - and throughput is brutally slow - reminiscent of dialup ) I 've been thinking about a Wii , but expect it to also hate my D-Link ... and now I 'm pessimistic about how well it will play with the FON , given this and many other posts I 've searched .	St
1.23.1	I found out the problem lies in the Windows Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing service .	St
1.23.2	It 's only affecting our desktop , but due to some nasty viruses we 've had last year and this year , there 's a lot of protocols missing when I look in the msinfo32 console when I click on Network and then Protocols .	St
1.23.3	There should be a lot more than the current 4 I see , when I checked it against my laptop .	St
1.23.4	So is there any way to restore all the protocols ?	Ques
1.23.5	BTW , when I hooked the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter into my laptop , it worked fine with the Wii and both DS ' we have .	St
1.23.6	Also if you want , I can give you a screenshot of the desktop 's msinfo32 information I 've been talking about .	St
1.24.1	I actually can not find an english firmware anywhere for my DI-524 .	St
1.24.2	It has hardware version B2 and it has the German version of Firmware 2.02 on it ... the only problem is I dont speak German and so I cant set it up the way I would like it .	St
1.24.3	( the only reason I bought it is I am stationed in Germany and it is one of the only ones I can get my hands on ) .	St
1.24.4	I tried the UK D-link site but apparently it no longer exists ... any help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.25.1	Sorry , there is no English version I know of .	St
