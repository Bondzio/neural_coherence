Is there any difference or is this just a marketing ploy? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231314 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231416

That would include the testing, heat dissipation(alloys), and then the color and/or looks. It's not what you all see that's apparent, because testing for &quot;every module&quot; you pay for rather than a sampling test. The best attached cooling fins, is yet another step and/or whatever is provided. Next, while color isn't always helpful, it maybe more a selling point to include any LED lightings. Last, if ever needed, the warranty while present maybe more forgiving in order to appease those that make wrong choices or along those lines. tada -----Willy

The other may have great staff and free return policies (higher prices.) Since no two businesses are exactly alike, the price can change. Bob
