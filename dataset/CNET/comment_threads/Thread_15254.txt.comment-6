Bob Thanks for the tips.
My server guy stopped in yesterday.
I was attempting to do what you suggested by changing the IP in the printer, but I was missing the menu item to do that (my wife says I'm blind).
Once we did that we put the driver on the server and voila!
We have contact.
I got the printer from ebay and the prior owner apparently had that setting in there.
As usual I learned something from my mistake which is a good thing.
Thanks again.
