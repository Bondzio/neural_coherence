i think what he was trying to say is... you have several fans in your case.
you could have one or two chassis fans, a fan for the cpu, and one or two in the power supply.
what you are describing is a sign that the bearings in a fan are broken.
try uplugging one fan at a time(while the computer is off), and boot the computer.
if the noise remains, shut down the computer, plug the disconnected fan back up.
disconnect another fan and retry.
if you are to do this with your cpu fan, do not boot up for long as it can overheat your cpu.
it may also be that you have a cable that is touching the fan blades (heard the same sound from that situation before) hope this helps!
