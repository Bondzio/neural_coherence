I have a few general motherboard questions, but since I am specifically looking at Intel boards, I decided to post in this section.
For reference, I am looking at the following boards (with which I intend to use a Q9450 upon release): ABIT IP35 Pro - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813127030 DFI LP UT P35 T2R - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813136037 DFI BloodIron P35-T2RL - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813136038 GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3L - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128059 GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3R - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128050 Here are my questions: 1) Do these chipsets/memory controllers suffer from the problem of slowing the memory down or having to run looser timings if all four slots are used?
2) Are all the sata ports locked on them, or are some unlocked?
Or are all sata ports locked on current motherboards, as I don't see any talk about this with the newer boards (I'm currently running an MSI K8N Neo2 Platinum, which has 2 locked and 2 unlocked)?
3) The first 3 boards state a memory standard of DDR2 800, the fourth says DDR2 1066, and the fifth says both.
Some of the ones that say 800 say they support 1066 on the manufacturers' websites, some don't.
And then some motherboards say 1200, and DDR2 goes up to 1300.
Basically, there's a lot of different numbers flying around, and I'm having a hard time making sense of it all.
What exactly is meant by &quot;memory standard,&quot; and why is the fastest memory (1300) higher than the highest memory standard on the motherboards (1200).
4) Some boards have listed in their FSB and memory standard specs 1600(OC) and 1200(OC) respectively.
What's the deal with this?
Does it help with overclocking, and if so, how?
