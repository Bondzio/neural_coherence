i had the monitor hooked up, but just now i tried again without monitor, and no beeping.
to re-affirm your question, the only things on the table are: power supply, motherboard (on top of static bag), cpu, heatsink/fan.
out of curiosity, how much voltage does the speaker need?
i could potentially put some voltage straight to it to test it ... so you know, there are nothing on the power/reset/etc jumper pins - i am turning the computer on using a piece of metal across the two power pins.
