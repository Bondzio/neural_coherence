1.1.1	Hello to everyone.Ihave a few questions and i need some answers.Ihave 5 years old computer Intel pentium 4 with mobo ASUS P4P800-X , RAM 1GB { 2X512 } , HDD 160GB NVIDIA G-FORCE 6600.I was made 2 partitions .the first working XP I will never change , Isuppose and the second partition was windows 7.My question is does it worth to keep it with some more memory or a new video card or to buy a new one desktop with 300-400 euros ? Iam a daily user i was using for videos , photos , music and a litle games .	St
1.2.1	If this was my dilemma , I 'd get a newer machine but keep the old one until I could fully transition to the new rig .	St
1.2.2	You might even find a use for the old one later .	St
1.2.3	They can become decent file servers or test boxes .	St
1.3.1	The fact that it can run win7 is a good sign that the system has some more life in it , but it has limited or will reach its end soon enough for a 5yr .	St
1.3.2	old system .	St
1.3.3	If possible add more ram , but that 's about it .	St
1.3.4	A new system , plainly said , will have the latest goodies and continue to work as time marches on , so be happy with what you got until you decide to buy new .	St
1.3.5	That decision is more to what you feel you need for now , but while you mentioned it , you are really using the old system in a heavy way .	St
1.3.6	IMHO .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Your computer is five years old , indicating its inner parts may be starting to wear out .	St
1.4.2	If it runs good however , I would just keep it .	St
1.4.3	The only thing that I may do is add more RAM and either another internal hard drive or get a good external hard drive .	St
1.4.4	1GB RAM is n't a whole lot but for five years it is very good .	St
1.4.5	My 5 year old computer has I believe something like 512 or 715 MB of RAM .	St
1.4.6	And 160 GB HD is pretty good as well .	St
1.4.7	You may want to get a new desktop just because the hardware would be much more efficient and effective ; i.e .	St
1.4.8	a faster RPM hard drive or a more energy efficient processor .	St
1.4.9	And speaking of processor , a new system would be sure to have a higher GHz processor .	St
1.4.10	Overall , its really your choice .	St
1.4.11	If you do n't have any issues with your current system and it is n't too cluttered up or anything like that and has no viruses , I would keep it .	St
1.4.12	If it is cluttered , slow , and has some issues with it , I would replace it .	St
1.4.13	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	Why not both ?	Ques
1.5.2	Upping the old one to 2 GB of ram would be the only thing I would do with it .	St
1.5.3	It would extend the life of it for a few more years until XP is no longer supported .	St
1.5.4	As for a new system you can either build one , and it sounds like you could ( if you do n't already ) , or buy a pre-built system .	St
1.5.5	Now I do n't know currency exchange rates very well , but I 've put together an inexpensive system for around $ 500 US .	St
1.5.6	http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=13452646 http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=13452806 Over the years I 've built several systems for friends , family and myself .	St
1.5.7	My oldest system I keep for old games and other old programs .	St
1.5.8	My XP system has become a media server , and my newest Vista system is the one I use all the time for everything .	St
1.5.9	Another plus to a new system is that it should run cooler and use less energy .	St
1.6.1	Hi Kostas , I work in a place where we fix computers so I hear this question quite a bit .	St
1.6.2	The answer is n't always that simple .	St
1.6.3	It would be helpful for you to answer these questions : 1 .	St
1.6.4	Is my current computer doing what I want it to do for me ?	Ques
1.6.5	If not , is it possible to upgrade it to meet my needs .	St
1.6.6	2 .	St
1.6.7	If I upgrade the computer , will the new parts I buy be usable in a new computer at sometime in the future ?	Ques
1.6.8	For example , if you add RAM to your old machine , will it work in a newer machine later ?	Ques
1.6.9	The same logic goes for Video Cards and even CPU Upgrades .	St
1.6.10	3 .	St
1.6.11	If my current computer is usable , will I gain an advantage by putting a bigger , and newer hard drive in it .	St
1.6.12	I say this for two reasons .	St
1.6.13	First , if you 're still using your original hard drive , you should replace it as it 's nearing the end of it 's life cycle .	St
1.6.14	With a new hard drive you can still salvage the data from the old one , and since your system is capable of running Windows 7 , it 's likely to be much faster with a new and larger hard drive .	St
1.6.15	With these questions in mind , you should also thoroughly inspect your existing computer to make sure all of the capacitors are still in good shape ( not swelling or bursting ) .	St
1.6.16	Also , if your old machine is capable of running DDR2 Ram , you 'll probably be able to upgrade the memory for a very reasonable price .	St
1.6.17	If you 're using the computer for videos , find out what sort of video card ( if any ) your current system is using .	St
1.6.18	If your board accepts a PCI Express card you 're in good shape , but if it takes an AGP type card , upgrading would be a waste of money .	St
1.6.19	Finally , find out what kind of CPU you 're using .	St
1.6.20	You mentioned it 's a Pentium 4 , but how fast is it .	St
1.6.21	There are a lot of good deals to be found out there for faster Pentium 4 CPUs up to 3.2GHz .	St
1.6.22	Do n't pay for any upgrade less than 3GHz on the CPU .	St
1.6.23	Most desktops of this type use a socket 768 type processor .	St
1.6.24	You might find that after the cost of upgrading the CPU , RAM , and Video card , you 're better off buying a new desktop but there are good deals out there to be had if you shop for them .	St
1.6.25	Also you should remember that if you buy a new unit , you 'll be getting an new optical drive , at least a dual core processor , in most cases a much larger hard drive , and a probably upgrade to a DVD Burner that your old unit does n't have .	St
1.6.26	Hope this helps .	St
