my scanner was dead.
best buy replaced it tonight, no questions asked.
mind if i ask a newbie follow-up question?
the new scanner identical to the old with the same software.
i had recently updated the drivers on the old one.
can i just plug the new one in and run it on the old software or do i have to uninstall the old software and install the new?
