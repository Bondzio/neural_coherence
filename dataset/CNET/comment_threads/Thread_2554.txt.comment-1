I have this card installed on an XP OS, and have nothing but problems.
The box says &quot;For Best Ports Connection&quot; and it uses an ALi chipset, 4 USB's plus firewire.
The drivers never seem to install right, I also tried one from another site.
Now the hardware wizard comes up everytime I boot.
ANyone have luck with this card?
I got this off eBay for a bargain, but that seems not to be now.
It appeared to work for a bit, but not all devices initially, now it seems useless.
any help?
-thanks, Russ
