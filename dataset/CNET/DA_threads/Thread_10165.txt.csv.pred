1.1.1	Tried to install my Epson Perfection 1260 scanner that worked great on my previous XP machine.	St
1.1.2	Went to the Epson site and downloaded what they say is there Vista driver.	St
1.1.3	As per their site's instructions, I downloaded (at a cost of $15) the ungraded Smart Panel from New Age.	St
1.1.4	All this and guess what?	St
1.1.5	No dice.	St
1.1.6	The scanner is not recognized.	St
1.1.7	E-mail to Epson tech support brought the response that they &quot;are working on a driver for the Perfection and will have it some time in the future.&quot; Wow, does that ever suck?	St
1.1.8	Meantime, does anybody have any suggestions for how to make this puppy work on my Vista machine?	Ques
1.2.1	then definitely get a refund.	St
1.2.2	If you just upgraded assuming , then you're probably SOL.	St
1.2.3	Otherwise there's no real incentive for manufacturers to provide drivers for an OS that's radically different for a 5-year-old scanner.	St
1.2.4	Get a Vista-supported scanner.	St
1.3.1	that the drivers can be downloaded from here http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/SupportIndex.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0999246985.1203900684@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccdladedghmhkdfcgemcfjgdfljdfon.0&cookies=no&oid=-10244&infoType=Overview Rick	St
