<s> At home, can you survive with just using a tablet as your main computer? </s>
<s> -- Yes. </s>
<s> (What task do you perform?) </s>
<s> -- No. </s>
<s> (Why not?) </s>
<s> -- Not sure. </s>
<s> (What are you unsure about?) </s>
<s> I do have an iPad, but I can't use it to VPN into work and get through my work day. </s>
<s> I need applications like Word, etc. </s>
<s> that just aren't available on an iPad. </s>
<s> And may need to do a lot of typing as well, which is not good on an iPad. </s>
<s> For what I do on my iPad, a certain amount of internet surfing, read and respond to email if it doesn't require much typing, play games, watch TV shows and movies. </s>
<s> If there are things that I want to do that involve a lot of typing, my iPad doesn't call out to me, like writing a long letter, or if I need to use an application not on my iPad. </s>
<s> So, yes, I can do a lot of routine stuff with an iPad, and enjoy using it (I have the &quot;new&quot; iPad, so great graphics), but there's a lot I can't do as well or at all on an iPad. </s>
<s> I am not sure since I dont have a clue nor do I see the value in obtaining a tablet/ipad/and iphone - (deaf - so phone is out) texting is a maybe. </s>
<s> A simple answer, would be no. </s>
<s> I use to monitors at one time. </s>
<s> I do E-mail, web search and web sites at the same time. </s>
<s> I have more then one tab on each browser window per screen. </s>
<s> Also I game and check web page for that game at the same time. </s>
<s> So no a Tablet would never work for me. </s>
<s> I don't even own a Tablet, and may never own one. </s>
<s> I like the ability to both consume and produce content, and the Tablet is more suited toward consumption. </s>
<s> I have a Desktop with an i7 860 (2.8 GHZ) (effectively 8 cores) and 8 gig of ram and a 1 terabyte hard drive. </s>
<s> I pad 3, dual core processor, 1 gig of ram, and 16 to 64 gig of storage. </s>
<s> These two products would not even be in the same zip code. </s>
<s> Of course it is is true that tablets can be very effective for some people and do an admirable job with some tasks. </s>
<s> If you don't really do much, an i pad might work out, but not for me personally. </s>
<s> It is kind of like driving a powerful V6 or V8 or driving a low powered 4 cylinder car. </s>
<s> They might both get you to where you are going, but there will be a difference getting there. </s>
<s> Tablets will thrive since there are many applications where they are the best solution. </s>
<s> As a main computer for most people, that is likely not the case. </s>
<s> I simply do not use and will never force myself to learn to use pictures of keys for a keyboard. </s>
<s> I use a 10&quot; netbook as a compact portable computer and I am completely satisfied with it and it will do anything - ANYTHING - that a desktop computer will do. </s>
<s> For example, I have Office 2010 installed on it - the same word processor as on my desktop at home. </s>
<s> It will interact remotely with my desktop just as any other battery powered or remote computer will. </s>
<s> A tablet may be fine for a child that just plays with his toy, but not ideal for anybody who uses computers. </s>
<s> You need the hard drive capacity of a desktop if not anything else. </s>
<s> However; I see a time when desktops become personal cloud servers, where you rarely actually sit at the computer and do things. </s>
<s> That role will be taken over by supersmart terminals like tablets and laptops. </s>
<s> I have observed that everything that a desk, lap or net book computer can do so can a smart phone or pad. </s>
<s> The difference is that every thing has to be stored off of the device. </s>
<s> This means for the phone especially, but the pad also, cloud computing and storage. </s>
<s> Which means monthly payments to somebody that has control of my stuff not me. </s>
<s> With the price of a few hard drives and ocassional replacement of same I can fill my desktop with all my life and not worry that some one will lose it or use it for what ever purpose. </s>
<s> By tablet do you mean only iOS and Android? </s>
<s> If so, no. </s>
<s> If you're including Windows tablets, yes. </s>
<s> I love my iPad, but it can't do everything, not to mention my IT work. </s>
<s> I was playing around with the Samsung Series 7 at the local Microsoft Store, and with it's 4GB of RAM, SSD, and Core i5, I can survive. </s>
<s> If I want to do some writing or image editing, using the tablet is a pain, and sometimes plain impossible for what I need to achieve. </s>
<s> I also often download movies and connect my laptop to the TV to watch them. </s>
<s> This isn't possible with my tablet, nor is transferring that movie to a flash drive (this might be possible with SOME tablets, but none of the popular ones iPad/Kindle Fire/Nook Tablet). </s>
<s> I use my tablet to browse the internet in bed, read books, play some games, IM and watch videos. </s>
<s> I get good use of it, but I couldn't imagine it being my primary computer. </s>
<s> Hi, Simply NO as I use the PC (& laptop) developping and using applications under ACCESS 2010, Word, Excel and graphics (home builder, etc.) </s>
<s> Guess a tablet will not be able to cope with my needs. </s>
<s> Best regards - and thanks for the good work. </s>
<s> The most famous tablet was the one cast in stone on the top of a mountain. </s>
<s> It had ten commandments that were meant to be followed by all. </s>
<s> It was meant to make make the world a better place. </s>
<s> Well before it &quot;got out of the box&quot; it's keeper Moses discovered that his customers displayed needs that this simple tablet was not good enough. </s>
<s> he dashed and broke it. </s>
<s> Now we have civil law and humans realize that it is a work in progress. </s>
<s> So goes computing and networking. </s>
<s> Some day the tablet will evolve into a device that makes laptops look primitive. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> I suspect cloud computing will take care of much of the functionality that is missing these days. </s>
<s> It is a trade off. </s>
<s> Desktops have the electrical and mechanical robustness and work horse power and are easy to upgrade and repair. </s>
<s> They do it all. </s>
<s> They just do not travel well. </s>
<s> Laptops are the next best, but do not travel as well as tablets; specially 7' tablets . </s>
<s> It's a work in progress </s>
<s> and the wonder is ..why are they selling like hot cakes then, especially in this economy? </s>
<s> The demand has caused the tablets, mainly IPAD in ridiculous price range for a limited product. </s>
<s> I guess people have to have their &quot;toys&quot;. </s>
<s> Can't use Wi-Fi enabled devices as they conflict with staff systems for resident care giving. </s>
<s> At the age of 76 my eyesight is not as sharp as it was. </s>
<s> I need my 20 inch monitor. </s>
<s> I need 3/8&quot; tall letters to read and I'm not quite 60 yet. </s>
<s> I have a 27&quot; monitor with my desktop so I don't spend all my time scrolling back and forth. </s>
<s> I'm trying to &quot;Train my Dragon&quot;, Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.5 that is. </s>
<s> Cell phones? </s>
<s> Forget it. </s>
<s> Waay to small to read. </s>
<s> I have one, for emergencies only, and I can only dial the number I need from memory because there is no way for me to read the address book. </s>
<s> I agree + For me, to take with me for complete mobility, tablets are just a bit on the heavy side - yet. </s>
<s> I couldn't bring myself to buy one. </s>
<s> So I do not have any experience with a virtual keyboard. </s>
<s> Bought a netbook 3 years ago and hardly used it. </s>
<s> However, I owned a Psion for over ten years, with great satisfaction, and used it until complete breakdown. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me if I can connect an external mini-DVD unit to a tablet, or do I have to transfer the videos I want to take with me on a jpourney to a 32 SD Card first ? </s>
<s> I regularly burn DVDs which is not easy ( possible ) with my iPad Generation 2 and 3 ( I have both). </s>
<s> I use my quad core laptop for that burning DVDs and a few other things. </s>
<s> I use my iPads and iPod Touch for everything else. </s>
<s> The Apple products are much easier and enjoyable to use while the Windows 7 computers are much more flexible. </s>
<s> I am a retired Electronic Engineer and have used personal computers since they were first introduced. </s>
<s> Before that I used Unix based main frames. </s>
<s> I have used PCs with assembly language, DOS, and Windows. </s>
<s> I enjoy using Windows 7 and iOS 5. </s>
<s> I have tried some of the Linux Operating Systems but prefer Windows and iOS. </s>
<s> All tablet PC use mere GPU or even no independent GPU due to power saving issue. </s>
<s> So how can a game addicted user like me trust on the coming Diablo III can be played well on tablet PC? </s>
<s> Small screen, no handy keyboard and mouse, and poor speaker, are just the minor issue. </s>
<s> The biggest problem is the poor graphic performance, even in the least setting of effect. </s>
<s> So tablet PC is just suit for meeting or on bus traveling situation. </s>
<s> When at home, tablet PC takes no chance to replace desktop PC for me. </s>
<s> Good point, this is my case too ! </s>
<s> Hello: I can do approximately 95 percent of what I need to do, but there are a few apps and capabilities not yet available via my iPad2 that I must do on my laptop. </s>
<s> For instance, Rationale 2 (argument mapping) IHMC CMap Tools (Concept Mapping Tools) and some social network analysis (SNA) tools. </s>
<s> Some esoteric stuff, I admit, but things I'm working with, nonetheless. </s>
