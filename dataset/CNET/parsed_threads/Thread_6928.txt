<s> I have an epson workforce 630. </s>
<s> I am using it to temporarily replace our main office copier/fax machine until its repaired. </s>
<s> Initially I could not send or receive faxes, but then I was instructed to turn off Error Correcting Mode (ECM) and turn off v.3.4. </s>
<s> After I did this I was able to receive faxes and I was able to send a test fax to epson which they received, but when I try to fax to other numbers it does not go through. </s>
<s> Any ideas as to why this might happen? </s>
<s> I've found some machines will not work with each other and the fax does not go through. </s>
<s> You may find folk that DEMAND AN ANSWER but the simple truth is &quot;it does not always work.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Actually, from my point of view you make a big problem of this. </s>
<s> it's much more easier to use an online service for this stuff. </s>
<s> Like http://www.popfax.com/ for example - those are great guys. </s>
<s> They just give you everything you need about faxes and they have really low prices and a free trial period, so... you can just try it. </s>
<s> I looked at the site and did not find ONE word about the problems folk have with FAX. </s>
<s> This issue is not new, but when you have a product to sell, you may not want to talk about the problem areas. </s>
