4569	0	102584	1176491	NR	Mhale	5/7/05 11:08 PM	1.11550728E12	Can anyone help me?	I have just recently started on building my own computer. I have 2 PCI express slots but i was wondering if i could still put a single PCI graphics card in the slot, since PCI express cards are so expensive or do i have no choice but to bite the bullet and spend 250$ on a card.
