your system probably uses build-in video which uses system ram for its own reserved use.
in some cases you can +/- that value to suit your needs.
it then either uses some vendor utility or the setting value in the bios.
you can't defeat it, if you continue to use the build-in video.
otherwise, if capable get a video card that directly installs and uses it own ram.
you needn't woryy about it and you add more ram if you have available ram slots open -or- swap out the ram for a larger mb size in its place.
hope this helps... good luck -----willy
