ok..i've made a little progress but still not working properly.
here's where i am.... trying to connect 2 computers (ultimately 5 computers)through a dlink switch computer ''a'' is xp pro staic ip: 192.168.0.10 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 computer ''b'' is also xp pro static ip: 192.168.0.11 subnet mask: 255.255.255.o i have run the windows network setup wizard on both machines.
if i open ''my network places'' on computer ''a'' i am able to see computer ''b''.
i am also able to access the folders and files in the shared files folder of computer ''b'' from computer ''a''.
however.. when i open ''my network places'' on computer ''b'', i do not see computer ''a''.
if i click on ''view workgroup computers'' i am able to see computer ''a''.
but when i click on the icon for computer ''a'' i receive an error that states ''\\computer a is not accessible....'' i don't understand why i can access one computer but not the other.
any help is again greatly appreciated, mike
