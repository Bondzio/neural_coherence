Before I pay for a disk recovery service, I was wondering if anyone has had problems with XP and the 1394 Fire wire Maxtor 80 gb external hard drive.
I use this drive to store music and pictures.
I was in the process of backing this up to a different Maxtor One Touch 250GB hard drive when I received an error and my computer froze.
After rebooting, unplugging the firewire cables, I was no longer able to see the 80gb drive.
Unfortunately, only half of my 75GB worth of data was saved on my 250GB drive.
Anyone help!!
Also, can you removed the hard drive from the external case and plug it into a IDE controller internally and make it a slave drive?
THANK YOU ALL!
