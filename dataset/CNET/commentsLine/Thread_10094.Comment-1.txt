im looking for advice on the nas220 by seagate before purchasing.
i am looking to know how this device handles streaming movies and music to xbox units and if it can do this without any issues when acting as a media server ?
any advice and support is welcome especially if any members have this nas drjve and use it in the same manor as i intend to.
