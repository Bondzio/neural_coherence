the cables are specific to the monitor in question.
in other words, they're not that generic.
you still hadn't explain your problem does the monitor work?
have you tried anything yet?
is the monitor cable at the monitor side or at the video port?
if not, you maybe able to return cable provide no real physical damage is done, just loose.
otherwise, disassemble the back cover and see what's what, again only if you're capable.
get back.
