I took BMF's advice and upgraded the memory on my 1.67 GHz PPC Powerbook (DDR2 SDRAM PC2-4200S).
I found the compatible ram (PC2-4200 DDR2 533 MHz) and ordered it from Newegg (two Kingston KTA-PB533/1G one gig sticks).
I removed the old 512 and inserted the two 1 gig sets.
When I tried to power back up, all I got was a blank screen, a couple of audible beeps and a sleep indicator light sequence of four flashes and then steady (repeating sequence).
I took both 1 gig rams out and switched them around but still no luck.
I put the original 512 back in and stacked one of the 1 gigs on top, still no luck.
Finally, I removed the 1 gig and left just the original 512 in and it worked again... Am I failing to do some step before powering back up?
