I also have a 19&quot; LCD flat panel display. My question is if I use an HD Tuner Box from Comcast for my cable TV and I run the coaxial cable into the pc, will I be able to watch HDTV through the Media Center app?

The question really is if I have an HD tuner from my cable provider (Comcast) and just rout the decoded output to my TV Tuner card in my MC, will it be able to handle it and push it to the graphics card, an ATI Radeon X600, and then render it on my monitor, a 19 inch LCD that should have more than enough resolution?
