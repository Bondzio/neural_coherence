as long as there is a pci-e 16x slot for dedicated graphics expansion you can then add a dedicated graphics card for as little as $50 or as much as $500 at a later date i noticed &quot;unlimited computers&quot; input and your opinion(although just an opinion and not at all correct)and you mentioned the issue you had with amd cpu's.you must be the only person that has had this issue because ive primarily used amd cpu's over the last 10 + years and they not only don't run too hot,they give almost the exact performance of any comparable intel cpu but at 50% to 75% less cost.if your on a budget do not buy intel,they cost too much and provide too little for the difference in price.check online on any forums for proof,i think the last time the person below bought a pc was when amd just started to compete with intel,things have certainly changed dramatically since the 90's my friend!!
!that's why research is so important because many people give misleading information because they're lacking in pc building skill, don't know any better or just got a bad product.
take for example the newest intel 6 core cpu selling for $1000 to $1500 and the comparable amd 6 core cpu is $250 to $300 but performs within 10% of the speed?why is this because it has nothing to do with overheating at all,just the fact intel is very overpriced but not that much better in performance.read any online comparisons and decide for yourself of course!!
