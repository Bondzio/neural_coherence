I checked the +12V line reading and it said 12.175V, is this a problem?
I am running 4 HDD's and i asked the computer technicians to make it into 2 or 3 I think this is possible am I correct or do I have to reinstall the OS again?
When i was going through the BIOS settings I found out the DRAMs performance was set on Turbo so it was being overclocked for all this time, I switched it back to standard so I think there is more stabillity now then before.
Could this be the problem?
