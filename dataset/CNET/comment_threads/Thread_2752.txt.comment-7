Now you've uncovered my REAL agenda.
What will probably occur is, if all the hype around Win7 creates a real demand (AND supply) of touchscreen monitors, maybe by 2010 there will be a few more players in the market and competition will make larger screens cheaper and give us a few more choices.
HPs touchscreen system got mixed reviews -- well, the two that I read anyway.
But, back to your original suggestion --- for right now, a good ol mouse is doing just fine!
