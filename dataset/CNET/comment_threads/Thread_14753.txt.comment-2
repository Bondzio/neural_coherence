If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.
More info on HD size and OS please.
Makeing the externial hd the boot is NOT a good idea.
The concept behind an external HD is for backup of data files when your main HD crashes or the OS gets wiped out.
