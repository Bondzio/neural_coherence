<s> We had a home network set up for us about 1 1/2 years ago. </s>
<s> We mostly just use it to share the DSL internet connection as well as access a printer from one of our computers. </s>
<s> I am having difficulty accessing the internet and believe that I have isolated thhe problem to a router that has gone bad (i.e., if I bypass the router the internet works fine). </s>
<s> So, I will be buying a new router. </s>
<s> Question is . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> can I just buy the same one and plug everything into the new one the same as the old one? </s>
<s> or do I need to find someone to re-set up the network again. </s>
<s> (The last guy went out of business and I don't have another computer guy yet.) </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance for your advice. </s>
<s> Just follow the instructions. </s>
<s> Easy. </s>
<s> Your PCs are already set up so just replacing the router is a breeze. </s>
<s> Most routers you purchase today come with an installation CD that will walk you through the setup. </s>
<s> Since you have more than one PC and if one of them is a laptop I suggest you setup the laptop first. </s>
<s> You'll need an extra ethernet cable during initial setup procedure before you can go wireless. </s>
<s> Even though you may purchase the same router model it will have a different MAC address which requires going through the setup process. </s>
<s> As long as you're not imtimidated by computers you shouldn't have any difficulty. </s>
<s> If you do...call the router manufacturer's tech support. </s>
