I've had an HP PSC 1210 All-in-one printer/copier for about 5 years. About a week ago, it kept getting jammed everytime I tried to print/copy with it. I went through HP tech support page, and it told me to uninstall the software and reinstall. I tried that, but everytime it got to the end of the installation process (the part where you plug in the USB cable) it didn't recognize the printer. I tried EVERYTHING to fix this, including: - Multiple uninstalls followed by reinstalls - Unplugging everything from every port and receptacle and waiting - Downloading updated drivers from HP - Turning off my antivirus and firewall during installation - Running Windows update - Trying different USB ports and chords - Reinstalling the USB drivers to the mobo - Following the damn troubleshooting tips on HP - Talking to an HP troubleshooter over tech support chat Nothing works. This printer was perfect a few weeks ago, and now its own drivers don't recognize it. Help! PS - Here are my specs: Windows XP Professional SP3, Pentium D 3.24gh, 2 gb of ram, homebuilt PC with a Gigabyte 81945gzme-rh mobo

Thanks for the feedback, all. None of it worked, but i appreciate the gesture.
