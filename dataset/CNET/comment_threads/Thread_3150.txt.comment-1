I know I recently made a post on this, but things have now changed.
I have a printer installed on this laptop (Vista Basic).
I need to share this printer on a network with another laptop (Vista Premium).
I have no idea how to do this.
I know the computer names.
I DON'T know how to find the server or printer names.
And Vista likes to be so damn difficult, I can't find a run feature to use the CMD thing.
Someome please explain to me what the hell I have to do.
