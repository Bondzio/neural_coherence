i am trying to set up a network for my parents.
my mom just bought a new laptop and wants to be able to network it to the desktop for transfering files and printer usage.
i have now spent the last 4 hours fighting it and could use some help.
i have gotten both computers on the 'net by way of a linksys router and sbc dsl.
that end works fine.
for the networking part tho, i get a inaccessable error.
the laptop is an acer using wireless.
the desktop is an older compaq which is wired to the router.
both are running xp home.
i have run the xp network setup wizard on both computers.
i can see the compaq from the acer.
i can see the acer and all shared folders from the compaq.
i cannot move files or folders from or to either computer.
both are running windows firewall.
i have checked the exceptions list to make sure that file and print sharing is allowed on both comps.
i have tried disabling the firewall on both comps to eliminate that as a possibility (didnt matter).
i am sure that i am missing something simple (and prolly stupid) but i am stuck.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks in advance!
