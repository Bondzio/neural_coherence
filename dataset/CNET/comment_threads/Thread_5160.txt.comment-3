&quot;PS2 Logitech Wheel Mouse&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ That's your problem, a Logitech mouse.
Goto the Logitech support website or if you got it, CD/floppy install disk, use it.
Normally, you don't need drivers as native W2K will do fine.
However, in some systems for whatever reason, Logitech mice are problematic.
I find using a plain 2-button non-wheeled mouse or a real MS wheel mouse problems go away.
You can tweek the mouse setting(hardware) if you like and see if it settles down, but i have no fix to speak of other than above.
sorry... tada -----Willy
