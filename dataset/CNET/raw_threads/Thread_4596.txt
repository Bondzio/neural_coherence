House has concrete walls (I know this can mess with the signal) question is. I get an excellent signal with the 2.4GHz wifi (in the room where I need the laptop working), but the 5GHz signal is not that great. any thoughts?

The 802.11g 2.4GHz is in the next section and is noted to be 300 feet. Again the issue here is all about what's in between and what frequencies are absorbed and by how much. Bob
