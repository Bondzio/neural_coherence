<s> I was wondering if it is very complicated to take your hard drive out of your old computer and put it into a new computer we will be buying? </s>
<s> I am pretty good at installing video cards, memory chips, ect. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> as you have an unused IDE port available. </s>
<s> If no port available, there are still ways to do it. </s>
<s> You need to tell us all of the aspects. </s>
<s> You must tell us about the make of the old drive and of the new one because it is possible that the jumpering of the drive may need to be explained. </s>
<s> I assume that the new drive will have the operating system on it, and you only want the old drivefor files that are on it or just the additional space. </s>
<s> Tell us what you want to use the old drive for. </s>
<s> Also is it presently in a working computer, and what Operating System is on it. </s>
<s> The computer the hard drive is on now is presently working but getting old, about 6 years old HP 6545c with win98se. </s>
<s> It has a lot of business info on it and when we get another computer we wanted to just place it in it so we can have all the info we need instead of transferring it over to the new hard drive. </s>
<s> We plan to get another HP so I thought that might things easier. </s>
<s> Would it be better to just transfer everything over to the new hard drive? </s>
<s> How hard is that to do? </s>
<s> I just didn't want to use up all the new hard drives space. </s>
<s> hard drive in the old computer. </s>
<s> It probabably has an operating system on it. </s>
<s> You may want to delete that, but you can wait to make that decision. </s>
<s> You should find out what file system the old drive is formatted with. </s>
<s> Easy to find, just go to My Computer, right click on the drive and left click properties. </s>
<s> It will either be FAT 32 or NTFS. </s>
<s> Then you should find out what file system the new computers drive will be formatted with. </s>
<s> You should know that NTFS can read FAT 32 but FAT 32 cannot read NTFS. </s>
<s> So if the old drive is FAT 32, then it won't matter what file system the new computer will use. </s>
<s> Next thing is when you get the new system to find out if there is an unused IDE port available. </s>
<s> You should be able to find out from HP before buying it. </s>
<s> Also, if they give an option for a little higher wattage power supply, take the option because you will be adding an additional load to the new computer. </s>
<s> Very likely the new computer will use the new 80 conductor ribbon cable and the drive will be jumpered as CS or CSL [cable select] With CS, the connector at the end is always the Master drive and the connector in the middle is always the slave. </s>
<s> You should change the jumper on your old drive to CS and plug it into the middle connector. </s>
<s> Unfortunately this is not always easy with ribbon cables because the two drives must be mounted so that the connectors can be plugged into each drive. </s>
<s> Also some of the newer systems use mobo that favor SATA drives and only have one IDE connector on the mobo [for two IDE drives]. </s>
<s> So you really need to know a little about the configuration of the new system that you intend to buy. </s>
<s> One way tother there will be a way to use the old drive, as long as the case is too small to mount another drive inside it. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I thought that 5 years was a reasonable lifetime for a hard drive. </s>
<s> If it is 6 years old, it would not be more than 20 GB in size. </s>
<s> The data probably occupies only part of the drive, say 5 to 8GB. </s>
<s> Susan may be risking losing all that business data WHEN the old drive dies. </s>
<s> It is unlikely that it is all needed on a day-to-day basis. </s>
<s> It would be safer to store it all on 2 DVDs (with backups for the cupboard too), and load whatever is the 'live' operational information onto the new drive. </s>
<s> Or transfer a copy of all the data onto a second new drive. </s>
<s> You could always network the 2, and get some ongoing use as a second workstation. </s>
<s> But you should still not rely on the old drive. </s>
<s> Faldown </s>
<s> I am aware of all of the aspects, the fact that hard drives fail, the need for backups, the ways to save to CD's. </s>
<s> That wasn't her question. </s>
<s> the making of the old hard drive is it says manufactured by seagate and made in china the making of the newer one is maxtor made under us and foregin. </s>
<s> yes i only want the old drive for information onit that i need. </s>
<s> i want the old drive for this information and things i installed on it. </s>
<s> if by meaning is it also in a working computer yes a old one too. </s>
<s> the operating computer well i only no that i got one of thoes old type the windows 98 ones i wonder if it will mess my computer up if my computer is a window xp one </s>
<s> and not programs that might not move over easily, if at all, hook the old harddrive up as a slave to the XP harddrive (make sure both harddrives are jumpered correctly for Master with Slave (XP) and Slave (old). </s>
<s> Once you get to the desktop, XP's Windows Explorer will see the old drive as letter D: since there is a Primary Dos Partition on it (you can check the contents in a Windows Explorer window to be sure), and then just drag and drop from D: to C: for any files you want to keep. </s>
<s> Once you have done that, you can right click the D: drive, choose Format from the menu, and empty the drive out and use it now just for storage if you want to keep the drive hooked up. </s>
<s> Otherwise, turn the computer off, unhook the old drive, make sure the XP drive is jumpered again as Master or Single, and boot back up. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> NO reason not to -- if she read that, a little counter-comment is harmless, yes? </s>
<s> Besides, you might have had some interesting comeback for me to learn from. </s>
