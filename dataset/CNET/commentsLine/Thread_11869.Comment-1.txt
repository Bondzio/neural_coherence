hi all, i am looking to replace my powerbook g4 soon (waiting til march to see if new pro's come out.)
i wanted to ask realworld users out there if you think it's worth the extra $ to get the 2.4 or if i should get the 2.2 and use the $ to upgrade the ram.
i need to run windows vista on the machine for work (which includes presentations of web based apps, flash, etc to clients) so i want to make sure that the machine runs fast in either os without breaking the bank.
thanks, jan
