1.1.5	I 've looked all over the manual put ca n't find anything .	St
1.1.6	Well , I did find the part about the USB 's .	St
1.1.7	Unfortunately the headers from the case and the mobo are labeled differently .	St
1.1.8	At least they look like they are .	St
1.1.9	M/board -- -- - USB +5V -- - USB +5V USB_P7- -- - USB _P8- USB_P7+ -- - USB_P7- GND -- -GRD Headers -- -- -- DATA - 1 ( WH wire ) DATA +1 ( GRN ) GROUND 1 ( BLK ) VCC 1 ( BLK ) Anybody knows what goes where ? ?	Ques

1.1.12	Header. -- -MIC in MIC Bias GRND LOUT L -- -IN R -- -IN R -- -OUT GRND Any help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	You gave a lot of good info .	Polite
1.2.2	Just to be sure , can you give your case brand and model number ?	Ques
1.3.1	There are 3 USB pin headers on your mobo .	St
1.3.2	Each pin header can be responsible for 2 USB ports .	St
1.3.3	In your manual , the headers are labeled USB78 , USB56 , and USB910 .	St
1.3.4	It does n't matter which one you choose , so let 's use USB78 USB pin header * * * * * & lt ; -- row1 * * * * & lt ; -- row2 Keep all 4 USB front panel connectors in one row , such as row1 .	St
1.3.5	Connect as follows : CASE -- MOBO VCC -- USB+5V DATA+1 -- USB_P8+ DATA-1 -- USB_P8- GROUND 1 -- GND	St
1.4.1	Here 's a reference with pictures : http : //www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_USB.htm	St
1.5.1	Your mobo has a pin header for front panel audio and microphone .	St
1.5.2	It is labeled & quot ; FP_AUDIO & quot ; , and it is located at the back of the motherboard , next to the audio ports for the back of your case .	St
1.6.1	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.6.2	This is the case .	St
1.6.3	http : //www.newegg.com/product/product.asp ? item=N82E16811217002 I know ... I know ... should have got a better case !	St
1.6.4	Oh well .	St
1.7.1	What is your overall impression of this case ?	Ques
1.7.2	A lot of my clients need a light case , having a handle would be a bonus .	St
1.7.3	Thanks Bill	St
1.8.1	It 's not too bad .	Polite
1.8.2	This is my first full build , so I have n't had experience with other cases .	St
1.8.3	The handle , which is plastic , was what made the sale for me .	St
1.8.4	I still have to see how it 'll hold up once I 've finished building it .	St
1.8.5	The fact you have a 500w PSU thrown in is a big bonus .	St
1.8.6	Having said that , I 'm not sure how long the PSU is going to last .	St
1.8.7	The price is ridicules.We 'll see .	St
1.8.8	Value wise , it 's a winner .	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	I always say that hardware that fits your needs is the best .	St
1.10.2	Looks like a nice bargain to me .	St
1.10.3	I like the top handle , too .	St
1.10.4	Happy builing !	St
1.11.1	OK ... I 've put them in .	St
1.11.2	I still have n't finished the whole build yet , but everything you said made sense .	St
1.11.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.12.1	I found the pin header .	St
1.12.2	I still ca n't figure out what goes where .	St
1.12.3	M/board ( Manual ) BLINE_OUT_L XXX Line out_L XXX NC ( JUMPER ) BLINE_OUT_R XXX Line out_R ( JUMPER ) +5V XXX MICPWR AGRD XXX MIC2 My Headers L_IN xxx L_OUT R_IN xxx R_OUT MICBIAS MIC_IN GRND GRND Can anyone tell what goes where .	St
1.12.4	Thanks in advance .	St
1.13.1	If there is a manual that came with the case check that .	St
1.13.2	Otherwise , this is what I would do : MOBO PIN -- CASE WIRE BLINE_OUT_L -- -- -- L_IN Line_out_L -- -- -- L_OUT BLINE_OUT_R -- -- -- R_IN Line_out_R -- -- -- R_OUT MICPWR -- -- -- MICBIAS MIC2 -- -- -- MIC_IN AGND -- -- -- GRND This leaves you with a loose GRND .	St
1.13.3	You could twist its wire together with the other GRND , and then place a new plastic ending on it ( computer store , or online ) .	Sug
1.13.4	Another option is to place it on a GND pin that is nearby .	St
1.13.5	A third option is to place it on the NC pin .	St
1.13.6	I 'm not sure if NC is a true ground , but I 'd probably place the remaining GRND there , especially since there is no other ground pin nearby .	St
1.14.1	Thanks linkit .	St
1.14.2	I did what you said .	St
1.14.3	I 'll let you know if it worked or not .	St
1.14.4	I 'm still waitng for windows Xp to come in the mail .	St
