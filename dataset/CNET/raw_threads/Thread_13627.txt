One thing of note is that they are extremely power efficient. That entire build could probably be absolutely fine with a much lower power supply then a 1050 watt. Find a calculator somewhere on the internet and see what it takes to run that build with two gtx 580's. I bet it is still under 1050 watts and the 680s are I think use like 30-40%less power meaning you would be fine with a 800-900 watt psu. Other then that where is this computer coming from? I'm in the market for a new computer and am 2 lazy to build

After reviewing your choices, I'd like to offer some alternatives (with reasoning provided): PC Case: your choice - Thermaltake Level 10 GT Black My choice: NZXT Switch 810 Why: it will contain all that you selected; with the added bonuses of having an SD card slot reader already installed, the allowance for up to 3 radiators (if you choose to water cool the PC), optional fan mounting (either 120 or 140mm), HDD cage removal, etc http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146089 It's almost $100 less than the Level 10 (not including the SD card reader -$19) Monitor: your choice - Samsung B2240EW 22&quot; Widescreen LCD Monitor ($379) My choice: ASUS VE278Q 27IN Widescreen LCD Monitor http://us.ncix.com/products/?sku=56378&amp;vpn=VE278Q&amp;manufacture=ASUS Why: 5&quot; bigger, 2ms response (for gaming), HDMI, Display port, DVI, and $60 cheaper Antivirus: your choice - Panda Global Protection 2010 Bilingual OEM W/ 1 Year Subscription ($30) My choice: Microsoft Security Essentials Why: will do pretty much everything that the paid versions will...free

I chose the thermaltake level 10 because it just looks like a beast whenever I look at it. Not sure, just really love the case and willing to pay the extra money for it. Also the 27 inch is way too big for where I'm gonna be placing monitor. I actually chose another monitor since I've made this post Samsung S23A700D 23IN Widescreen LED LCD Montor 1920X1080 120HZ 3D 2MS DVI-D HDMI(400) This way I can play in 3D 1920x1080 and 120hz an make use of my 680 a bit more. Let me know what you think. As for the antivirus yeah I wasn't sure about PDP. Guess I'll just scrap it and go with that lol

For the amount of money you're planning on spending for the motherboard/ CPU; if your looking for a fast PC, you might want to reconsider an i5 2500K or an i7 2600K/ 2700K...as the X79 series aren't as fast as people expected. But, it all depends on what you're wanting to do with your new PC... As for Microsoft Essentials; I've been running it on my last 3 PC's, and never been infected with any form of virus/ malware since installing it...more than I can say for F-Secure, etc. If you're bored of the typical &quot;boxy&quot; PC case; the Thermaltake Level 10 GT is definitely not in the same league, but if you want to house all that you can ( + maybe even the kitchen sink), I can think of a few more that you might fancy http://www.ldcooling.com/shop/13-computer-cases Pricing starts @ $480 Euros http://caselabs-store.com/ Pricing starts @ $399.99 US http://azzatek.com/csaz-4000-gallery.html http://www.ncix.com/products/?sku=67080&amp;vpn=CSAZ-4000&amp;manufacture=AZZA%20Technology&amp;promoid=1360 currently (in stock) selling @ $239.99 CAD/ $252.42 US

10479	9	559277	5293722	5293682	Brechan	4/1/12 12:28 PM	1.33328328E12	ASUS...excellent!!	I have to admit; that I've never had any other manufacturers' motherboard in any of my (home-built) PC's, never had a problem (nor had to RMA) any of their boards You might have a problem actually getting your hands on the new NVidia GPU's; I've read on many sites, that they're hard to come by (not unlike the AMD high-end cards). If you have any concerns/ problems when it comes time to actually build your new PC, you know where to find me
