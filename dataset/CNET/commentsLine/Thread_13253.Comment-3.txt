(well i hope you're not promoting a product, eh?)
uhm...let me see...i think i won't opt to change my os (and i think freebsd is a gamble since you said &quot;...but then you wouldn't have games.&quot;).
thanks anyway.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;external video card with enough memory for the game.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; so if i upgraded to let's say 2gb ddr for a 2gb required game, would it be performing the same as a 2gb ddr2 machine runing the same game?
meaning bus speeds won't affect gameplay..is that what you mean?
(same for the video card thinggy...my slot says agp 8x.
i don't have pci-e. i think.)
help!
