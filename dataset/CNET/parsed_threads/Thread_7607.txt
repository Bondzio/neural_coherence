<s> I changed my internet provider from knology cable to ATT dsl today. </s>
<s> I followed the directions provided with the hardware ATT sent. </s>
<s> I am reusing a netgear wnr2000 wireless router that I had used with the knology internet. </s>
<s> The ssid was &quot;mynet&quot;. </s>
<s> I have the network setup as follows: The phone line coming from the wall is plugged into the Modem, which is a 2wired RG2701HG-00. </s>
<s> I have the netgear WNR2000 plugged into one of the ethernet ports on the 2wired box. </s>
<s> If I view available wireless networks, I can see &quot;mynet&quot; network from where I had setup a wireless network when I had knology and a second one with the SSID &quot;2wired534&quot;. </s>
<s> I have two laptops I am trying to setup to use this wireless setup. </s>
<s> One laptop connects fine to &quot;mynet&quot; but the other doesn't. </s>
<s> The other laptop seems to try to connect at different times to &quot;mynet&quot; and to &quot;2wired534&quot; but never get past the &quot;Acquiring network address&quot; stage. </s>
<s> The settings are the same on each as far as type of wireless connection, security, password etc. </s>
<s> for &quot;mynet&quot; It looks to me like both the Netgear box and the 2wired box are access points. </s>
<s> But I don't quite understand why one laptop connects fine to &quot;mynet&quot; and the other doesn't. </s>
<s> I know this is all very rambling. </s>
<s> I guess my question is what is the proper way to set this network up. </s>
<s> Is it as simple as using only the 2wired box and taking the netgear box out of the loop? </s>
<s> CD </s>
<s> The 2 wire device seems to be this model http://www.2wire.com/?p=106 If so, this would be a complete ADSL modem/Router/Wireless solution and you don't need the Netgear -- which was primarily designed for use with cable. </s>
