i work in a public school and i want to network a printer that i have.
i was wondering what is the best way to do that?
could i use a slightly older spare computer and set that up as a print server?
or should i just use an external printer server like an hpjetdirect print server?
if i was going to use a spare computer as a printer server, can anyone give me some direction as to how to set it up?
