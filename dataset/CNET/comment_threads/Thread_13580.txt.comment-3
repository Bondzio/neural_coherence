Well, I did not know that Micron and Crucial is the same.How come one chips is taller that another one ?
That's what I thought was a cheat.
Computer is P4 (it was bought long time ago in 2001 I believe) and it is custom made.
Has an Intel MB GAG915.
4 memory slots present on MB...memory is working in dual channel mode 1GB-512MB-1GB-512MB.
Like I mentioned in my first post - even though I returned to my old configuration that I just stated I still continue having problems.
Should have stayed with my previous config (it was working just fine) but I wanted to upgrade (forgetting about that for Windows XP Pro) which I am running..it would not matter because if I use 3GB or 4GB RAM it will still be as 3.
