i don't want it to try to recognize my handwriting and convert it to text.
i want it to keep it the way it is, but i need it to follow the pen more closely than a passive stylus would.
i expect it to be difficult to adjust to and have imperfect accuracy, but i also expect it to be usable for a first timer like myself.
