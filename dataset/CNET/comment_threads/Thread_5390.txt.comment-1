I need help in deciding what video card I can and could install on my pc.
Nothing over $200, but because I can only work within the parameters of the pc I have now this'll be my last upgrade for awhile.
It's mainly for 3d gaming, videos and movies.
Some of my games now will work but they are very loggy.
Sims2 and 3 in particular.
Here are the basic specs.
Operating System MS Windows 7 64-bit SP1 CPU AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ 32 &#176;C Windsor 90nm Technology RAM 4.00 GB Dual-Channel DDR2 @ 199MHz (5-5-5-15) Motherboard Hewlett-Packard 0A64h (XU1 PROCESSOR) 16 &#176;C Graphics 9005W-B (1440x900@75Hz) ATI Radeon Xpress 1150 (HP) ATI Radeon Xpress 1150 Secondary (HP) CrossFire Disabled Hard Drives 1954GB Seagate ST2000DL003-9VT166 ATA Device (SATA) 33 &#176;C 488GB Seagate ST3500418AS ATA Device (SATA) 39 &#176;C Optical Drives ASUS BC-12B1ST ATA Device Audio High Definition Audio Device Any help is greatly appreciated.
