There are thousands of folk with this issue so my question is why your suppliers have left you out on the road with a dead car and no gas? As you can tell it's rarely the same thing and the advice repeats often. That is, start with less parts and never skimp on the PSU if you can't add up the Amperes and know why you get a single rail when you can't add it up. Bob

Recheck your work and that means tearing it down out of case. Using cardboard, rebuild the system on it and make that a &quot;MINIMUM SYSTEM&quot; just what it needs to boot. In fact you need no drives at all, see what it does upon applying power, it should at least get to the error display or try entering a bios display. In other words, its up and running but can't go far but remains, &quot;ON&quot;. Don't take anything for granted and don't be in a rush to build, check and verify it all. tada -----Willy
