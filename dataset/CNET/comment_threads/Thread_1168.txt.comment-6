hi BoB, I thank you for your help.... unfortunately I believe there is no solution....!!!
I have made tests on tests.... also departing from different driver of the maxtor and windows.
I repeat that the problem is also in USB - the drivers of my model have primarily been written for USB... the firewire 800 probably (even if very more perfomante and then &quot;top&quot; for the plug/unplug) more than so much it doesn't interest on the market.
In fact, on the site Segagates there are not contemplated driver.... and in more, further to a technical absence, they have me &quot;recommended&quot; to use the doors USB (as from you already said).... clearly with the result that you know.
The doubt was tied only to the fact that could exist a some parameter or flag or tip to manage in XP and that it allowed the hardware to understand that the external disk was present and accedible (because indeed in the use of the function of &quot;sure removal&quot; of the hardware the visibility of the same is precise and evident).
hi and thanks still.
Sergio.
