The error message has a MS notation.
The MS Q-number shows your video driver is stuck in an endless loop.
Also shows this mostly happens when Symantec PC Anywhere is installed.
First off, I would completely uninstall the video card and drivers.
Reboot and reinstall, being sure to disable any anti-virus (and PC Anywhere, if it is on the machine).
Probably things are out of sequence.
Also,LCDs have a native resolution.
You don't a lot of choices like a CRT.
Good luck.
