<s> Hi I've just taken delivery today of a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo D1845 laptop with a Conexant PRISM 802.11g (3886) network adapter. </s>
<s> OS is XP Home. </s>
<s> Am able to connect to open network in my building but cannot get IE or Outlook Express to connect - error messages inc &quot;Cannot find server&quot;. </s>
<s> Signal strength is generally good and have Internet options configured to &quot;Automatically detect settings&quot;. </s>
<s> It is not running through a client at all, Windows is controlling the Wireless Network settings. </s>
<s> A friend could connect with their HP laptop running an Intel PRO 2200BG wireless card no problem. </s>
<s> What might I be doing wrong? </s>
<s> All suggestions greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> In Wireless Network connection Properties, I installed &quot;Microsoft TCP/IP version 6&quot; protocol. </s>
<s> The internet works fine now. </s>
<s> Before, it worked like a really sick dial-up connection. </s>
<s> I use D-Link Wireless router. </s>
<s> I also found this on the web: http://www.cableforum.co.uk/board/archive/index.php/t-21444.html </s>
<s> It doesn't work again, I don't know what the hell is going on. </s>
<s> Every suggestions appreciated. </s>
