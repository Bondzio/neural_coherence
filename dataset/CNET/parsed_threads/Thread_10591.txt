<s> I have been looking for a 19 inch LCD Monitor but I am finding that the ones I am trying have a tendency to give off a fuzzy (slight crosshatch) pattern when there is movement on the screen (such as in games or when I drag a window around the screen). </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea what this is that I am seeing? </s>
<s> To my eyes, it appears as a small criss cross pattern that really is noticeable to me. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> have to shell out some bucks. </s>
<s> Samsung and ViewSonic are the best bet in my book. </s>
<s> Make sure you have at least a 600:1 contrast ratio. </s>
<s> You'll spend between $300 - $550. </s>
<s> There are cheaper ones out there but not for games. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack ps..Look at CNET reviews for the best ones. </s>
<s> Look at the pixel response rate/time in the LCD monitor's specifications/details. </s>
<s> The faster the response rate, the less pixelation and smearing you will see. </s>
<s> Aim for 16ms or less. </s>
<s> You will pay more for the faster rate. </s>
<s> Look at display reviews on gaming websites. </s>
