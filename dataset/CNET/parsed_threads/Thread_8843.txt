<s> I have a HP Pavilion Media Center that came with Vista. </s>
<s> I have the capibilities to create a large enough partition to contain Windows XP. </s>
<s> Is it possible to install XP into a partition and then run it as an alternative to Vista? </s>
<s> -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx As to your question the answer is &quot;yes but.&quot; Sadly since you have an OEM version of Windows Vista you can't follow the normal install since you don't have the Retail CD for Vista. </s>
<s> You'll have to either pay for that CD and license or see if anyone will talk about Partition Magic and Bootmagic. </s>

<s> Short answer: google away on this topic, its difficult at times.. Long answer: The best install is starting to have a partitioned(virtual) HD or phyical HDs ready to accept the OSes. </s>
<s> You install the oldest released OS, in your case XP, then Vista. </s>
<s> But you have the added problem of a OEM version Vista. </s>
<s> Usually that implies it wants to go where it *wants* to go and may not be redirected elsewhere. </s>
<s> Thus, you need true full retail OSes release for best install with least hassles. </s>
<s> I exclude any special or other needed s/w to make it easier or seemily so, but it does help for beginners. </s>
<s> It has been done, the google answers such. </s>

<s> Microsoft bought out a company that sold a Virtual Operating system called VMWare. </s>
<s> They then brought out Virtual PC and sold it for $99 bucks a copy. </s>
<s> This Virtual PC allowed you to install it on top of a Microsoft system NT200, XP, and now Vista with Virtual PC 2007. </s>
<s> Here's the kick, Microsoft has made the system free, no more $99 bucks. </s>
<s> You can download it from the Microsoft site http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=04D26402-3199-48A3-AFA2-2DC0B40A73B6&displaylang=en I bought the early version and installed it on a XP system and then installed four other versions of Linux, and Windows 98. </s>
<s> It worked successfully and made it so that I could call up any one of the systems I needed. </s>
<s> I have not tried it with Vista yet but according to Microsoft's site, it works with Vista. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> That is very useful information. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it does not work on my OS, which is Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> As a matter of fact, not much else works on this version of Vista, at least not for me. </s>
<s> I bought a new Media Center PC from HP back February 20 (2007) that came with this version of Vista and right from first boot-up, some of the standard primary functions (such as Help and Support) did not work. </s>
<s> After a month of going back and forth with HP on all of the failing issues, including having to send the PC back TWICE for repairs - which they could not fix, they replaced that computer with a new Media Center PC. </s>
<s> To my horror, that one is now having nearly the same failures. </s>
<s> It seems more likely that the culprit is Vista Home Premium (at least on this kind of system) than getting TWO Lemons, back-to-back, from HP. </s>
<s> Is anyone else having problems running Vista Home Premium on an HP Media Center PC? </s>
