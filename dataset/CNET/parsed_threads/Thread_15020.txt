<s> I want to burn dvds so that they play on dvd players these will contain still and video pictures. </s>
<s> We have a dell Vostro with Vista and a dell Inspiron 6000 with XP. </s>
<s> the Vostro has a dvd burner but dvds done on it may or may not work on players. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for an external burner and software that will produce dvds that will reliably play on dvd players as well as on other computers??? </s>
<s> Thanks Ed S </s>
<s> First there is no standard DVD that holds such. </s>
<s> Then you have players that don't play recorded media to those that play DVD+R but not DVD-R and vice versa. </s>
<s> There is no panacea. </s>
<s> However I continue to use DVD FLICK for simple video DVDs and for photos I may try www.photodex.com or just put the jpegs on a Data DVD and find that many of the newer players work fine. </s>
<s> Sorry but this is a minefield of problems, issues, compatibilities and more. </s>
<s> I've found I need to choose my battles here. </s>

<s> I don't think there is a 100% reliable DVD burner and software out there. </s>
<s> You have to try one (1) yourself. </s>
<s> Have you burned playable videos for TV before? </s>
<s> I use multiple DVD roms (ASUS, NEC, Liteon, TEAC) and Nero software, it works 90% of the time. </s>
<s> You need to try 1 man, no need to fear this. </s>
