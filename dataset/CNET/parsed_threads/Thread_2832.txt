<s> I am wanting to build/buy a PC so that I can watch movies and tv shows on my TV and living room. </s>
<s> Any recommendations on what specs I will want to have on the machine and where to find such a product? </s>
<s> Thanks, Jeff </s>
<s> I have started to gather the parts to build my own media pc. </s>
<s> The build I am considering will cost me under $400 which can be built for less. </s>
<s> My pc will be placed into a gaming pc case, $50, that will not be located near the tv. </s>
<s> A htpc case may cost a little more. </s>
<s> The motherboard that I will be using has built-in graphics with hdmi,dvi,vga and digital audio outputs, $80, so I will not need to buy a graphics card. </s>
<s> The processor is an AMD Athlon IIx3 processor, $80, but a dual core processor is more than adequate for a htpc for around $60. </s>
<s> I will have a 1Tb hdd, $50, at a minimum you may want a 500 Gb hdd. </s>
<s> The ram I will use is DDR3 2 x 2Gb, $40, 2 Gb of ram is more than adequate for a htpc and the cost would vary depending on your components and may be less. </s>
<s> The optical drive I chose is a dvd/cd burner/rom multi, $17. </s>
<s> If you wanted a BD rom or burner it could be as high as $100. </s>
<s> The power supply will cost me $30, for a 460 watt ps , dependent on your system a higher or lower wattage ps can be used. </s>
<s> And at last, the operating system can be free, such as a linux os ubuntu, or as little as $100 for Windows 7. </s>
<s> I am not a computer geek, nor have I built computers in the past. </s>
<s> I have been researching this info for the last month and been watching quite a lot of how to videos on youtube. </s>
<s> You will need to pay a lot of attention to which components are compatible with each other, and that determines the cost. </s>
<s> My favorite websites for parts are newegg and amazon. </s>
<s> There are several free programs to obtain hd content, such as &quot;miro&quot; and free programs to categorize and display your video/movie content such as xbmc. </s>
<s> And if you have Windows 7 then it should come with Windows media center. </s>
<s> You could also splurge on a radio frequency remote to work with your htpc. </s>
<s> If you have specific questions on my build, or more questions on building your own rig, then please don't hesitate to post, or email me directly. </s>
<s> I hope this has been helpful. </s>
<s> I found a refurbished HP/Compaq Evo at I believe Overstock.com. </s>
<s> It had a Pentium processor, a 40 Gig HD, half a Gig of RAM, a DVD drive (useless for this application), and XP Pro. </s>
<s> I upped the RAM to one Gig, installed a D-link wireless G PCI card, and connected it to my Sony 55&quot; SXRD with a VGA monitor cable. </s>
<s> Powered it up, found my network, and voila. </s>
<s> I believe I spend about 150 for the PC, and in total about 200 bucks. </s>
<s> Oh, I bought a wireless keyboard and mouse for about 30 bucks. </s>
<s> So make it 230 bucks total. </s>
<s> I can stream anything from anywhere. </s>
<s> You don't need a lot of bells and whistles. </s>
<s> That is a great solution to jmf4x9 question. </s>
<s> I have not thought of using a refurbished pc as a htpc. </s>
<s> From what you described it had to have either on-board graphics or a graphics card. </s>
<s> Kudoos, Great solution at a great price. </s>
<s> I will use your idea on using a D-link wireless G PCI card thanks for your post </s>
