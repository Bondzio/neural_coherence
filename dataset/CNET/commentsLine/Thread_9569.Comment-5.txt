also, there are so many optical drive failures in old laptops like this that i always find myself demoing how a good drive works.
however, did you try a bootable usb memory stick?
i won't detail how since such is all over the internet.
why i note this is that i have helped a few get onto some linux on usb and get some use out of their otherwise useless broken hardware.
