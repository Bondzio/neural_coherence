It was working fine with both and now it does not work with PC. When I connect it with MAC, I am able to view all the files and can copy, edit, etc. However, when I connect it with a PC, I can see the drive but I cannot see the content in the Drive. What could be the problem with it? Could I have deleted some of the files? Is there any way I can do to fix this problem? Thanks

Then you can format it again on the PC and on your Mac copy the files back onto that drive. There are thousands of prior discussions. Bob
