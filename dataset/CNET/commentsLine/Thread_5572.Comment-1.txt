i've noticed that some external hard drives have a port to connect ac power and then a seperate port for the usb.
does anyone know what the power slot is for?
i know that it's meant for an adaptor to be pluged into, but i though usb ports can provide power as well as transfer data.
just curious.
i've had a drive for some time that has both and i've always just pluged the usb cable into the laptop.
thanks for any information you guys can give.
