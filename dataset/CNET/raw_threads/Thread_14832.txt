Afterall, who doesn't like a PC which play music nicely, and surfs internet okay, and doesn't need Vista? So, why the forum? My PC doesn't seem to have USB 2.0 and my handycam won't like it. I know I could just buy a FireWire cable, or just a PCI to USB thingie. But I just wanted to know if there was a way to get USB 2.0 on my current system itself? I looked here http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d850gb/ and here and they say I could http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-009024.htm But I don't see any option like that in BIOS. I am contemplating upgrading the BIOS, but will that really help? What do you think? Or will I just end up wasting my holiday redoing my OS? Your advice and help is appreciated.

You already know the cure, get a new pci card that can provide it. There is no way to add/or somehow fix your current USB chipset to v2.0. The USB level is strictly a h/w item, s/w only acknowledges or provides access to it to include the bios area. The link for &quot;enabling USB2.0&quot; was if the mtrbd. does have it, then you need a supporting OS to actually use it, and some patches to further support it. This doesn't actually fix a mtrbd. that &quot;physically&quot; lacks USB2.0 but does have USB but only at a USB1.1 level. Any bios update is serious business, so be sure before proceeding and be ready as instructed for a successful update. From link: To Enable USB 2.0: Step 5 5. Enable &quot;High-speed USB&quot;. -If no USB2.0 is found, then that option isn't present, it will read &quot;enable USB&quot; or similar, thus low-speed at USB1.1 tada -----Willy

Also uses RAMBUS memory. Hmm. Big bucks getting that stuff. Anyway, USB-2 standards were finalized in 2001. If your board is of that vintage or older, it's not going to work. A BIOS upgrade doesn't add this feature either. You'll need an add in card. BTW, which OS? Hopefully XP w/SP2.

D/l technical manual from intel site as well. No luck. Currently using XP. Have tried with 95/98/2000 Adv Server SP4 as well. No luck. So if the mb doesn't have it, OS won't add it. Gotta get a PCI-USB card/FireWire cable. Oh btw, are RDRAMs still in production :-?
