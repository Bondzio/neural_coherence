<s> I have a frustrating question. </s>
<s> Over the past two weeks I have been dealing with a video problem on my Dell dnInspiron 8500 (2.2 GHz MP4, 512 Mb RAM, nVidia GeForce4 4200 64Mb Go video card). </s>
<s> After two weeks of searching and toiling and reading thousands of community forum posts the culprit ended up being a little pin (that tells the computer to go into standby mode) that had worked its way out of place and was sending a continuous signal to go into standby. </s>
<s> I fixed it rather easily once identified, inspite of finding MANY posts from DELL representatives stating that the mother board needed to be replaced for this problem. </s>
<s> If I had stopped there everything would have been fine. </s>
<s> Unfortunately for me, while searching the DELL knowledge base, I also discovered that DELL recommended a BIOS upgrade for my video card. </s>
<s> Since I was steeped indealing with video card issues at the time, once I fixed the pressing problem I decided to follow their recommendation and flash the BIOS to update my video card. </s>
<s> They offered two options, and being slightly lazy, I decided to go with the easiest method which entailed downloading the flash utility and running it from my hard drive. </s>
<s> I followed the directions explicitily and quit all applications before starting, then launched the utility and ran it. </s>
<s> It then posted an additional window that stated this should take a few seconds to complete. </s>
<s> After 10 minutes I was starting to get a little worried. </s>
<s> I clicked on the original window only to be told that it was no longer responding! </s>
<s> Of course, I was VERY concerned about what just happened and you guessed it, upon restart I got nothing! </s>
<s> The hard drive light flashes a couple times, but never spins up. </s>
<s> I get no splash screen, and clearly it just stops at that point. </s>
<s> Now I am trying to determine if there is any way to reflash the BIOS (blindly -- without an operational LCD). </s>
<s> I tried making a bootable floppy disk but my laptop will not boot from it...possibly because it doesn't realize I switched the CD drive with a floppy drive. </s>
<s> I am trying to make a bootable CD, but not sure how to get the flash utility to run automatically. </s>
<s> I am desparately searching for any ideas. </s>
<s> Do I really need to buy a new video card? </s>
<s> Can it really not be re-flashed? </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Please. </s>
<s> I had deja vu when reading this post. </s>
<s> My experience is with the exact same equipment and pretty much the same steps you followed with the exact same unhappy results. </s>
<s> I wish I had a solution but I have pretty much given up. </s>
<s> I hope someone replys to this post with an idea. </s>
<s> Try using an external USB floppy drive for the BIOS flash. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, contact Dell and complain to them that you followed THEIR RECOMMENDATION to update the video card BIOS/firmware. </s>
<s> THEIR RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE AND SOFTWAE ''bricked'' your video card and they need to rectify this. </s>
<s> A solution would be a new video card or a utility that repairs the video card BIOS. </s>
<s> I've not received any good ideas that have worked from this post or the others I have fished with. </s>
<s> I tried reflashing from a boot disk as some have suggested, but the system fails the POST tests and never proceeds far enough to actually boot up. </s>
<s> I did talk to the IT person at my place of work and he basically told me my only recourse was to buy a new video card. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, because the cards are fairly machine specific the word &quot;new&quot; refers to a used card purchased from eBay; the only source I could find. </s>
<s> It will run about $120 with shipping. </s>
<s> This is one mistake that I will not make again and that will start with not buying Dell laptops. </s>
<s> I've always been fond of Apple computer and this only reinforces my reason why. </s>
<s> I see a MacPro on the horizon. </s>
<s> Good luck with you endevors. </s>
<s> If you find anything that helps please let em know. </s>
<s> I fully agree with you. </s>
<s> This is Dell's fault! </s>
<s> They should pay for the replacement. </s>
<s> The problem is contacting Dell's tech service and dealing with the hours of waiting and language barrier to likely have to fight repeatedly with them over this issue. </s>
<s> Outsourcing is done for one reason...to save money and that isn't only related to cheaper labor, it's related to poorer service. </s>
<s> I've, this time, chosen to bypass the Dell tech service nightmare and pay the price for a replacement card. </s>
<s> They absolutely, however, need to take the harddrive BIOS flash solution off of their website! </s>
<s> Thanks for the comment. </s>
<s> yea, told a friend i would reformatt and update their pc, installed all the updates, got to the vga bios update and now i own a laptop i cant afford unless i fix it... </s>
