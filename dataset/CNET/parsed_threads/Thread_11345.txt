<s> I know that the Promedia comes with a subwoofer, but how do these speakers compare in terms of clarity. </s>
<s> I listen to a wide range of music. </s>
<s> I like some bass heavy music but listen to a little more of acoustic type music. </s>
<s> I am also looking to hook up these speakers to my TV on occasion for Movies or Sporting events. </s>
<s> I am mostly interested in a clarity comparison though when playing music. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I own a Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speaker set but have not compared them to the Creative offering. </s>
<s> I doubt you'll find anyone here who has but listening quality is just too subjective to rely on other peoples ears. </s>
<s> If there's a way to compare them yourself, that would be best. </s>
<s> I am, however, very pleased with my Klipsch speakers and have had them for quite some time. </s>
<s> These replaced a Creative 2.1 set which I also liked well but the Klipsch are noticeably more pleasing to me in the mid and high ranges. </s>
<s> Actually, my Creative set was made by Cambridge Soundworks who picked up that division and re-branded the products years ago so I don't know if Creative has maintained the quality that Cambridge offered. </s>
<s> As I said, I like the Klipsch. </s>
<s> The sub puts out good bass but I keep it rather low. </s>
<s> I find the music quality from the satellites to be very good for PC speakers. </s>
<s> If you've a compatible output jack from your TV it should be fine. </s>
<s> Just make sure it's un-amplified at that point. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
