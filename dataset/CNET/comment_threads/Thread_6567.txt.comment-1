I need to know what to look for on the specification list of a new computer that will tell me if it has a voice modem.
I need one that will answer the phone AND which I can use to monitor my calls.
My current computer has a modem but I cannot monitor my calls.
I have to wait until they hang up and then play the message.
Not good.
As if it is very important then I do not get the chance to talk to that person immediately.
