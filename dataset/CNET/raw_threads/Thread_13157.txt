Dell customer service is useless. Is there a company that sells a kit to do this (UK cords, power conversion items, etc.)? Any advice is appreciated.

The items that are rated for that higher voltage just need a new cord or plug adapter. Dell has little to nothing to do with this. Your expectations are dashed here. Bob

I ended up hearing a buzzing sound through the computer speakers and then heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound before the circuit blew on the wall outlet. Do you think I damaged the computer? I fear I may need a new power supply for the computer but how can I tell? Also, any recommendataions on where to get power cords/step down converters for the desktop in the UK? Thanks for your help.

The Radio Shack convertor has to be of sufficient size to handle what you plug into it. What parts run directly on 240 (or thereabouts) should not be on the convertor. The Radio Shack people should be chatty about this so take advantage and talk about it there since this medium is not as chatty. Bob
