my first computer was home made from an old popular science magazine!
it explained how to use neon bulbs and a two 90 (yes 90) volt batteries and toggle switches!
all it could do was add and subtract in binary!
not good for anything but it worked and never crashed...just worked.
so if anyone wants to know the sum of 100 plus 100 let me know.
