That's done so the game does not get outdated when better hardware comes along. The overheating issue is only if the machine's maker didn't cool it well. And nice choices. Bob

Are you sure your PC/MB can really use that high speed (expensive) RAM ??? Why the WD 'Blue&quot;.....why not go with 7,200RPM HDD ? Last 3 years ? Probably but you may need to upgrade the GPU toward the end. I'm sure there will be greater challenges forthcoming but that could be offset by a new GPU. Good UPS and backup method recommended too. VAPCMD PS....Best to include links to the products you're asking for input on ...sometimes the devil is in the detail and while I like to help...I don't want to spend it trying to figure out/find exactly which product/ you're referring to.
