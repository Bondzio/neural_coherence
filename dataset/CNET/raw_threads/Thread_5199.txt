I have a 2.5&quot; SATA hard drive that just came out of my previous PC laptop. I have data in there that I wish I could use in my new home computer. I was hoping I can place it inside the computer, but I'm wondering if it is possible to just plug in the hard drive directly into it? If not, is there an alternative to using this hard drive inside my PC?

Physical mounting issues aside, the connections for sata 2.5 inch drives are the same as desktop sata drives. Consider an external USB case if you don't want to deal with the desktop internals such as http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=KM-EN251SV&cat=HDD or http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=EN391&cat=HDD Bob

This will allow you to mount it on your computer so it is stable and won't fall off. It follows the standard hard drive format design so it should allow you to mount it on your case. The other way is to get an enclosure that fits your hard drive. ICY DOCK has other enclosures that might suit your need. You might want to check their website.

I'm not sure about the brand. I'm using an ASUS P4WD2 motherboard with Pentium D 2.6 Ghz and 1 GB RAM. Thanks for all your help guys!!!
