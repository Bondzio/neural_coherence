<s> I love music,movies, tv viewing on my PC with Windows Media Center, but I'm running out of room and we have 3 pcs in the house. </s>
<s> So everyone is fighting to use the master computer with all the files. </s>
<s> I'm looking at the Seagate / 650GB / 7200 / 16MB / USB 2.0 / External Hard Drive but I have heard scary stories about people external harddrives getting corrupted when they power off due to a blackout (even with a backup battery). </s>
<s> Any advice on how to set this up on my home network so we can all use the media I put on the drive and have you heard about this corruption problem? </s>
<s> Drives will eventually fail. </s>
<s> They are not &quot;storage&quot; devices but more accurately temporary storage. </s>
<s> You can help by converting the drive from it's supplied FAT32 formatting to NTFS when you get it. </s>
<s> NTFS is more damage resistant and survived most if not all power loss issues. </s>
<s> FAT32 could indeed vanish... Bob </s>
