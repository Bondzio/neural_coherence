1.1.1	Hi everyone, it's me again with another question, jeje I have a computer with IDE socket, but I bought a DVD-R with E-IDE interfase(I discovered after I bought it) My question is: This DVD-R will work in my computer?	St
1.1.2	PS: I saw a picture of a E-IDE socket and has exactly the same amount of pins.	St
1.1.3	but I'm not sure.	St
1.2.1	compatible.	St
1.2.2	The first E is for &quot;Enhanced&quot;.	St
1.2.3	Most drives have been EIDE for many years now.	St
1.2.4	One possiblity that I ran into in 3 mobo's is that they insisted that the DVD drive be a Slave on either bus.	St
1.2.5	They would not let it work as a Master, I know not why, but the mobo FAQs clearly said that.	St
