1.5.1	Hi Steve , As Twesterh indicates , & quot ; The Gateway is technically the better computer as it has better specs and more features. & quot ; The 827GM also has the Athlon 64 3500 processor which has more power that gamers like .	St
1.5.2	Since you repeatedly post that you do not do gaming , then the lower priced ( especially when on sale ) T6212 without upgrading the graphics or RAM would be suited for you IMO .	St
1.5.3	Also Steve , the emachines T6212 is more in competition/comparison with the HP SR1010z in features & price ... .. http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=97950 & messageID=1130119 The Gateway 827GM is more in comparison to the Gateway 825GM and others like : HP m7070n HP m7060n HP m1297c	St
1.6.1	Course ' if you got the coins , go for the 827GM .	St
1.7.1	Gee Steve , we have been going over you buying different computers since January .	St
1.7.2	I know what you mean about having a 6 year old PC with Win95 .	St
1.7.3	My elderly sister has one and refuses to buy a new computer .	St
1.7.4	It still works fairly good even with Win95 , but I alway have to do some work on it whenever I visit .	St
1.7.5	If you have the coins , Velocity Micro is not overkill for your basic PC needs .	St
1.7.6	Velocity Micro has been discussed favorable quite a bit in the CNet forums and you may desire to run a CNet 'Search ' concerning them .	St
1.7.7	Although my wife has had a emachine for several years , we have not had any problems so have not made any Tech Support calls .	St
1.7.8	nacho1162 promised to let you know about the emachine recovery disk , and he did in that same thread you apparently missed : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=97219 & messageID=1128592 & tag=cnr I 'm not familiar with Gateway on if they furnish a backup disk or if you talk to a person in India when calling Tech Support .	St
1.7.9	Perhaps you can google it or someone else may know .	St
1.7.10	Gee Steve ... .there are millions of people with computers who never ( like me ) have problems to even call a Tech Support .	St
1.7.11	Perhaps you may be one of them .	St
1.7.12	Keep in mind that these forums are mainly 'Help ' type for people with computer problems , although many people who do not have a problem participate .	St
1.7.13	Since it is a 'help ' forum then naturally you will read about people with computer problems and not from the millions ... ..	St
1.7.14	Regards , JR PS ... on your next computer , avoid visiting some of those 'off color ' sites , kaaza , and opening email attachment which will help in not catching viruses & spyware .	St
1.7.15	Take the advice given in the CNet Virus & Scty Alerts forum and download the free spyware programs & free anti-virus/firewall programs if you do not purchase one .	St
