<s> I would suggest going to www.pcpitstop.com and run their free systems check. </s>

<s> In your post at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591_7-0.html?forumID=26&messageID=2236657&threadID=209750 I would not have replied as I did if you had written it was some Ebay item. </s>
<s> Given this information I would immediately contact the seller and ask them to explain why you shouldn't return the product. </s>
<s> There is NO SOLUTION to this issue. </s>
<s> It will continue to click until the drive is replaced or the source of the problem is explained. </s>
<s> However, hard drives do make some &quot;click&quot; sounds as they operate. </s>
<s> There are bad click sounds and good click sounds. </s>
<s> I'll take this one is bad since you took the time to register here to make your postings. </s>
