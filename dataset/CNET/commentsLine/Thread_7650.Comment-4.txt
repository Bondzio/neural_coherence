i live out inthe country fo there is not really any neighboring networks.
my dsl modem doesnt have one of those wireless things built it.
i just bought a d-link di-524 router and an external antenna and that fixed my problem.
the store recommended if i lost signal still to put a pie tin under the antenna.
this helps to reflect the signal and act as a ground for the signal.
once again, thanks for your time.
