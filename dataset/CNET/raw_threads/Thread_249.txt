Turned my computer on and the only thing that shows are the black screen and &quot;No signal&quot; on the monitor. I could hear it boot and all but it doesen't show it on the monitor. The last time I got this problem, I changed my power supply (which was 4 weeks ago) and it worked again. Just a couple of days ago, it did it again. Anyone know what the problem or problems are? I'm open to any suggestions. Thx Pc spec: P4 HT tech (Mobo: Asus p4s800) 1.5Gig PC 3200 RAM Geforce 7600 GT AGP

After relocation of some hardware to improve air flow, I had a floppy drive that would not work. Turned out to be a pin fit to female connector in one of the power supply connectors extensions I had added to move the hardware around. If I follow your previous post, you changed/replaced the power supply, maybe when you did this you fixed the problem only partially. If a connector or even a wire is intermittent, the computer would work for awhile and then the connection or wire would open from vibrations and temperature change. In addition to a connector being bad I also found the connection at the drive to be loose. This required me to solder a pin on the drive back into place. If this is the problem you are having about the only thing you can do is to check out all the connection till you find the bad one. You may even need a magnifying glass to get a real close look at each connection also look at connection points on the PC boards. Look for damaged, misalignment, and wires with too much play. Just as a check, have you tried the safe mode at startup. I'm not sure what OS your are using (win98, it was press F8 at just the right time in the boot up). If you could enter safe mode and found that the display came up in safe mode I would then start looking into software fix, driver update. I read some post that indicated Vista and video card driver compatibility issues were causing blank displays but I believe that was only a problem with laptop. From your original post, you indicated that the display never even gave any load up splash screen. If that is the case then I still feel you have a hardware problem. Because the PS change did yield a positive result, it may still be the problem area. Check the connections closely and if you find nothing you may have a deeper problem such as a short or failing board.
