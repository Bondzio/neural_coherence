i built this computer on cyberpower pc.
i'm looking to upgrade to vista, and enter the computer gaming world.
i want to have a computer that can basically do a little of everything and handle it all efficiently.
this was basically built off what i thought seemed sufficient.
please review and comment.
(is is vista capable, in the first place?)
