always check all networking devices for any settings that change the duplex mode(on most equipment anyways) which basically limits to how much bandwith can be sent and received at a given time, always make your your equipment has the newest stable drivers and/or firmware for routers/switches since new firmware might create new custom settings or have easier control of your bandwith, also don;t forget ethernet (wired portion) of your network will always exceed wireless since wireless can't handle ethernet speeds yet, check firewalls and check wireless coverage since maybe you got a weak signal
