I checked the display drivers through device manager and there are two, the 7660G and another that just says 7000m series. does it switch to the 7730m when gaming?

I can't tell if this is the same issue discussed before but with the ATI series the exact names change with the amount of ram and more. So the &quot;CORE GPU&quot; may indeed be the 7660G but in a laptop where it is clocked down a little it's marketing name would be the hd7730m. This could upset a consumer and for a consumer my advice is to return product where support is lacking. Again, there's a good reason for this. As to the switch. It should. Bob
