1.1.1	Would you suggest buying generic printer ink rather than the company ink that costs 5x the price ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 'm weary of doing this because a friend of mine blames generic ink for breaking his Epson ...	St
1.1.3	Suggestions and opinions ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	Epson printers on thier own are a PITA .	St
1.2.2	They tend to be problematic with any inks even thier own .	St
1.2.3	As for any other printer out there , using generic inks is OK but you are at the mercy of that & quot ; quality & quot ; of inks used .	St
1.2.4	Simply put , cheap ink is cheap ink .	St
1.2.5	I suggest you buy at least from a offcie outlet store like Staples , OfficeMax , Wal-Mart , etc .	St
1.2.6	and enjoy some saving .	St
1.2.7	If you plan to refill your own , then buy from a reputable ink refill source , etc.. Rememeber , usually the only recourse any refill outlet provides is to replace inks/refilled carts for free if you have problems and they agree to .	St
1.2.8	I buy store refills all the time and rarely have problems , however I do n't use Epson printers , I repaired too many to find them on my desk at home .	St
1.2.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I 'd be suspicious of what 's in a 6 dollar cartridge .	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	I have never seen that sort of price difference .	St
1.4.2	But .	St
1.4.3	part of the decision Imade when buying a printer ws the ink , how it works with different papers etc .	St
1.4.4	Introduce a foreign ink , and now the ICC profiles for that printer are no longer valid .	St
1.4.5	Good luck finding an ICC profile for generic ink with a particular printer and the particular paper you are using .	St
1.4.6	Its enough aggravation to find them with the manufactures ink .	St
1.4.7	I took a different approach .	St
1.4.8	I also own a small laser printer .	St
1.4.9	I use that for all my normal printing , saving the color printer for photos and stuff where I truly need color .	St
1.4.10	My HP Lasers go about a year and a couple of months on one 70.00 laser cartridge.. and they print must faster as well .	St
1.4.11	If you choose to use you inkjet and do n't care about color , make sure you print as black and white , so at least you are only using the black ink cartridge .	St
1.4.12	Using a generic ink will violate most warranties .	St
1.4.13	Generic Ink has been known to cause problems .	St
1.4.14	If I were to buy generic , I would stick with a known brand from a known supplier so that if there is an issue I know who to go after for printer repair .	St
1.5.1	I use generic ink in my Epson printer .	St
1.5.2	The economics are simple .	St
1.5.3	The printer itself is now dirt cheap .	St
1.5.4	The expected operational life without breakdown of modern inkjet printers seems to be about two years .	St
1.5.5	( My current one is 3 years old but has not printed in colour , only black and white for the past 18 months - and will not work at all unless I replace the colour cartridges on a regular basis , no idea where all that ink goes to , but definitely not onto any paper ) .	St
1.5.6	You can use cheap ink and throw the printer away after two years , or use extortionately expensive ink and throw it away after three .	St
1.5.7	Even if you have to throw it away after one year the savings on the cheaper ink are greater than the cost of the new printer .	St
1.5.8	For some reason Epson printers suffer from clogged nozzles more than other brands , particularly if you do n't use them every day .	St
1.5.9	On my last one even the drastic Windex treatment failed .	St
1.5.10	Incidentally I have a 10 year old HP Deskjet 500 used once a month or less , and it always works first time without fail .	St
1.5.11	The quality of the print is not as good as on more recent models , but it never fails to deliver what it always did .	St
1.6.1	Define generic printer ink .	St
1.6.2	The ink sold to be used in all printers should be avoided .	St
1.6.3	But if you buy bulk ink intended for your printer from a reliable vender that also has good suppurt such as http : //www.printerfillingstation.com/ then you should be okay .	St
1.6.4	I have refilled my Canon ink jet cartridges so many times I 've lost count .	St
1.6.5	You have to be willing to learn how to refill the cartidges .	St
1.6.6	Once you leara how you should have no problems .	St
1.6.7	My Epson printer has cartridges that require a device to reset factory cartridges and the cartridges are designed in such a way that the ink takes about 24 hours to work .	St
1.6.8	This is where a vendor with good support helps .	St
1.6.9	Follow the directions from the vendor methodically .	St
1.6.10	Cover the work area with lot of newspaper , have paper towels , etc .	St
1.6.11	available .	St
1.6.12	Refill the cartridges before they go dry .	St
1.6.13	I keep a set of full cartridges ready to put into my printer and then refill the ones I take out immediately .	St
1.6.14	I get great results and beautiful photo prints .	St
1.6.15	I could not afford to make aa many photos if I had to pay for the printer company cartridges .	St
1.6.16	Printer are fairly inexpensive because the companies know they 'll make huge printer with their cartridges .	St
1.6.17	Glenn H .	St
1.7.1	I 'm a bit surprised about the negative comments about Epson printers as my 10 year old Epson Stylus Photo that I infrequently use works fine .	St
1.7.2	I 've used both generic and company inks .	St
1.7.3	Only reason that I did n't keep using generic inks is that I would typically buy them several at a time to spread out the shipping charge .	St
1.7.4	By the time I 'd get to the second cartridge , it would already be dry .	St
1.7.5	Turns out that it was no more expensive to by company inks locally with less loss .	St
1.7.6	Only issue there is that the inks would start to run out while I 'm trying to print something important .	St
1.7.7	Solution there was to remove the cartridge and shake it some to position more of the ink over the end it comes out off .	St
1.7.8	That would typically buy me a few print jobs and I could get a replacement in that time .	Sug
1.8.1	Having read the other replies , I will offer my humble opinion .	Polite
1.8.2	You get what you pay for .	St
1.8.3	I will use only HP printers and ink .	St
1.8.4	I think that if you 're only printing letters/documents and using black ink , it most likely would n't make musch of a difference .	St
1.8.5	However , for photos or professional looking presentations , brochures , decals , tee shirt transfers , or any of the other creative things you can do with your printer , I would want the highest quality printer ink .	St
1.8.6	I save by resisting the tempation to print ALL of my photos ( haha ) , and by setting my printer default to print on & quot ; fast draft & quot ; automatically ( which uses less ink and is perfectly fine for documents and everyday stuff ) , and then choose the higher quality for printing photos or other things .	St
1.8.7	I hope this helps .	Polite
1.9.1	I have used generic inks in both my Epson 740 ( which is still working ) and in my current Canon IP4000 ... ..never had a problem w/ inks ... .and there definitely is a savings .	St
1.9.2	Are all generic inks equal ?	Ques
1.9.3	Well for my money I 've been using Insell.com for over 2 yrs and have never had a problem .	St
1.9.4	They are great folk to do business w/ .	Polite
1.9.5	Infact I will not purchase a printer that I ca n't use generic inks in .	St
1.10.1	My first ever printer was an Epson Stylus 800 , and I still kick myself for using generic ink because the print quality deteriorated to the point that I had to chuck the printer out .	St
1.10.2	Perhaps generic inks have improved since then .	St
1.10.3	I happily use generic toners in my laser printer because a bad cartridge does not damage the actual printer , but if I ever get another inkjet it will be genuine cartridges all the way .	St
1.11.1	I buy generic , I have an Epson printer and no real problems .	St
1.11.2	Perhaps my printer does n't last as long as it would if I bought Epson cartridges but as printers are now so cheap it 's almost as cheap to buy a new printer as to buy brand name ink .	St
1.12.1	I regularly print color manuals for a holistic health practice .	St
1.12.2	If I use company inks , it would cost me $ 40 per manual .	St
1.12.3	I use generic inks and drop the cost down to about $ 4 .	St
1.12.4	Regular deep cleaning through the printer maintenance routine keeps things chugging along ...	St
1.12.5	Previously I owned and used Epsons , but got tired of the problems and switched to Canon .	St
1.12.6	I just spent $ 50 after two years to replace the print head , bringing it back to new status .	St
1.12.7	It is against the law , my understanding , for a company to try and void the warranty on a printer because you use generic ink .	St
1.12.8	I also print a lot of photos , and find the generics work just fine .	St
1.12.9	I guess we all have different levels of discernment .	St
1.13.1	I have used generic inks for a while , to print colour photos , and have no problem with them .	St
1.13.2	I am suprised that one one has mentioned continous inking systems .	St
1.13.3	You can get a 6 cartridge system from Everest inking system for around 35 .	St
1.13.4	The tanks hold 6 x 100ml of and costs around 24 , although there is cheaper ink available .	St
1.13.5	This amount of ink represents about 60 normal cartridges .	St
1.13.6	These systems automatically reset the chip so you never have to remove the cartridges from the printer or go through the messy process of refilling , its all done automatically .	St
1.13.7	The eqivalent cost of Epson cartridges would be in the region of 500 in England , is that a saving or what ?	Ques
1.13.8	I never have to worry about the problem of Epsons fault of needing to clean the heads as the ink is so cheap .	St
1.13.9	Look on Ebay there are several suppliers advertising systems and ink at very compeditive rates	St
1.14.1	When I first started using them , I did n't have much luck .	St
1.14.2	However , since I started using Ink Sell on my old HP 970 Cse , I 've had absolutely no problems with their inks AND they 're about 50 % cheaper .	St
1.14.3	Have n't tried them on our Canon i960 yet .	St
1.15.1	Windex is the gentle method .	St
1.15.2	If drastic method is used by the companies that recycle cartridges .	St
1.15.3	They use boiling water and it will usually work .	St
1.15.4	Pour the boiling water into a container big and deep enough to immerse the ink jets or print head .	St
1.15.5	Hold it under water for several minutes until you see ink in the water .	St
1.15.6	You may have to do this two or three times and you may have to squeese the cartridge .	St
1.15.7	Once you are getting ink out of the cartridge wipe everything dry with a paper towel and then top of the ink .	St
1.15.8	To get the ink flowing in your printer print out one of these pages : http : //www.printerfillingstation.com/PFS/color.htm http : //www.printerfillingstation.com/PFS/black.htm If the print head is is not in the cartridge you may have to clean it separately .	St
1.15.9	Glenn	St
1.16.1	I have been refilling my ink cartridges for four years .	St
1.16.2	I used it for a couple years on an old Lexmark Z52 and now on a Dell A960 ( same manufacturer ) .	St
1.16.3	True , useing good ink is important and good advice .	Polite
1.16.4	I have done well with Universal - Color Fast .	St
1.16.5	a few years back i tried another brand that entered my syringe as a jell .	St
1.16.6	needless to say i droped them quickly .	St
1.16.7	I would suggest that if you have pretty much emptied the cartridge before refilling wick the ink through the heads as you slowly refill .	St
1.16.8	This will get the ink flowing around any air bubbles that can block the inks flow .	St
1.16.9	Use papertowel as it wicks more slowly than toilet paper which wicks too quickly and can be dusty ( paper dust ) .	St
1.16.10	I have saved thousands in replacement cartridge costs .	St
1.16.11	I replace cartridges once to twice per year , sometimes more .	St
1.16.12	At one time when my work flow was greater i was refilling three to four times per month .	St
1.16.13	For me , there is no better way .	St
1.16.14	Howard	St
1.17.1	If you 've got the & quot ; black only & quot ; option selected , the printer should n't be using any color ink except when you run a cleaning cycle on it .	St
1.17.2	If you do n't have it selected , it will always use a mix of colors to create black .	St
1.17.3	Technically it 's not & quot ; true black & quot ; , but it looks like it , at least on the printers I 've owned .	St
1.17.4	Incidentally , when you run a cleaning cycle , it uses ink ( or so my Epsons have always told me ) .	St
1.17.5	Where does it go ?	Ques
1.17.6	Christa	St
1.18.1	I have owned many , many ink jet printers , including Canon ( favorite ) , Brother , Epson , Compaq , HP , and Lexmark .	St
1.18.2	I always replenish my supply with generic ink .	St
1.18.3	I order from a couple of on-line sources , and the quality of the ink matches brand name .	St
1.18.4	I have never had problems with the ink destroying my printers .	St
1.18.5	Consider , however , that not all inks are the same .	St
1.18.6	Once , I purchased ink from the shelves of a local discount store at an unbelievably low price .	St
1.18.7	The results were unbelievable too .	St
1.18.8	Colored water does n't work .	St
1.19.1	I agree with most of the posted messages , generic printer ink has too much of a cost savings , ( $ 2.50-4.00 vs $ 11.00- $ 12.00 for Cannon tanks .	St
1.19.2	The Cannon printers ( i.e S500 ) that use the individual tanks , no printer nozzles .	St
1.19.3	By generic I mean the ones you purchase off the web from these ink sites , which do not identify any manufacturer on the box or on the cartridge .	St
1.19.4	For text and most printing purposes they are OK , colors are a little off but for everyday , at home use this is not an issue .	St
1.19.5	I do believe they tend to dried up on the print-heads more often than OEMs but I just use a damp cotton swab or cycling through mulitple clean nozzle cycles .	St
1.19.6	For pictures or any graphics that you require good to perfect results , I can not vouch for them .	St
1.19.7	I know Consumers Reports does not recommend them for pictures , and suggested Text-only if you want to use them .	St
1.20.1	I 've heard a lot of bad things about Epsons too , both here and other places , but it has n't stopped me from using them .	St
1.20.2	I 'm on my third , a CX3810 all-in-one .	St
1.20.3	The second ( R200 ) still works perfectly , but it lives at my boyfriend 's house because I 've been printing DVD screeners for his film .	St
1.20.4	I LOVE the way it prints on discs , they look great and printable CD / DVDs are very affordable these days .	St
1.20.5	The oldest one is dead .	St
1.20.6	Died after using non-Epson cartridges .	St
1.20.7	Never did that again .	St
1.20.8	To be fair , it could have just been that brand ( and I do n't remember the brand ) .	St
1.20.9	I 'm sure there are perfectly good generic inks out there , but I 'm not going to try again .	St
1.20.10	There was a class action settlement a while back for certain Epson Stylus models .	St
1.20.11	Apparently , a lot of cartridges for those models were reporting themselves as empty when they were n't .	St
1.20.12	One of the printers was one I had , but I opted out because I never experienced the problem .	St
1.20.13	I do n't remember what the payout was .	St
1.20.14	I think it was either a printer or a set of cartridges .	St
1.20.15	About the same retail value either way .	St
1.21.1	Can you provide a source for Ink Sell inks on the web ?	Ques
1.21.2	?	Ques
1.22.1	I buy the cheapest printer that I can refill for everyday printing .	St
1.22.2	About 80 percent of normal use does not require high quality printing .	St
1.22.3	Of course I grew up with reinking ribbons on dot matrix printers and started refilling with the first inks out there .	St
1.22.4	They have really inproved over the years .	St
1.23.1	I have used Hp and Canon printers in the past and only lately bought an Epson stylus C65 for home use .	St
1.23.2	I was attracted by the company & quot ; bla bla & quot ; concerning the new 4 cartriges ( black , cyan , yellow , magenta ) system that according to them will save you money being.. & quot ; separate cartriges & quot ; ! ? ! ? !	Ques
1.23.3	To my surprise I realized that if one of the colour cartrige is missing or out of ink , one can not print in the & quot ; black mode & quot ; at all .	St
1.23.4	This is something I could do on my old HP and Canon , I could infact print with the black cartrige even if the colour one was missing .	Sug
1.23.5	We all know that printers companies make a lot more money on the sale of ink cartrages than on printers alone .	St
1.23.6	Unfortunately the end user is paying too much of a high price by being forced in this case to buy a colour cartridge even if he is not using it .	St
1.23.7	I feel as if I have been & quot ; legally & quot ; ripped off !	St
1.24.1	Better than half of the generic ink cartridges that I have purchased for HP printers have failed to work properly .	St
1.24.2	Go for OEM , skip the generics and avoid the hassle	St
1.25.1	I was wondering if your suggestions can be applied to Epson stylus C65 .	St
1.25.2	Is there anyone out there who knows how to clean the heads and nozzles of this printer ?	Ques
1.25.3	Any help will be grately appreciated .	St
1.26.1	I have used ink cartridges by the original manufacturer and also tried those offered by companies that use recycled cartridges and generic ink .	St
1.26.2	You are definitely less likely to have problems with a cartridge from the original manufacturer and the quality of the ink is certainly far superior .	St
1.26.3	Sure , the prices for the generic ink cartridges are attractive , but the quality of the ink is not nearly as good , colors are off , they dry up faster , have more problems with leaking , and often do n't quite fit into the ink cartridge slots in your printer as well as the original manufacturer 's cartridges do .	St
1.26.4	Should you have a printing problem and contact the manufacturer for support after using a generic cartridge , you will find that you have voided your warranty .	St
1.26.5	So if you do want to experiment with the generics , I would strongly advise waiting to do so until a time when your printer is no longer under the manufacturer 's warranty .	Sug
1.26.6	Oftentimes , even when your printer is out of warranty and you do have a problem , if you explain your problem politely and do n't just go off on the customer support person who is trying to help you , they will offer you options to get repair at a discounted rate or if they determine your printer can not be repaired , they will offer you a & quot ; loyalty discount & quot ; to purchase a new printer at substantial savings .	St
1.26.7	I learned my lesson the hard way about generic ink .	St
1.26.8	Yes , it is a great savings , but the problems that result are certainly not at all worth the price of the savings in the cost of ink .	St
1.26.9	I now stick with the cartridges from the original manufacturer , regardless of the higher cost .	St
1.26.10	You will always have more power when in need of tech support if you stick with the manufacturer 's brand .	St
1.26.11	And in regard to the quality of printers made today , it certainly is true that the older printers were made better and from better quality components of those made today , which are lower in quality and do break down sooner .	St
1.26.12	Companies want you to upgrade and had realized that the older models were outlasting their intended life expectancies and sales were slower on the newer models .	St
1.26.13	So these new models , particularly the all-in-ones , do have a shorter life span so customers will be forced to buy the newer and allegedly & quot ; improved & quot ; models .	St
1.26.14	But when you can get a & quot ; loyalty discount & quot ; from the manufacturer to replace a dead printer , it is worth the upgrade .	St
1.27.1	I always wondered about that , so , when ink could no longer be found for my Epson C-62 I went to a place that offered to fill any cartridge for $ 4 .	St
1.27.2	My printer was & quot ; special & quot ; so the refill did not cost substantially less .	St
1.27.3	The machine stopped printing red after the first cartridge and could not be cleaned .	St
1.27.4	I bought a new HP printer and I 'm sticking to HP ink which I can get at a discount store for the same price the $ 4 guy sells it for .	St
1.28.1	I believe your C65 is similar to the CX5200 that I own .	St
1.28.2	Because of their fine resolution the tiny jets can get dry and clog up if you do n't use the printer at least once a week .	St
1.28.3	I 've learned the hard way .	St
1.28.4	Epson says using alcohol or windex will cause damage .	St
1.28.5	I was ready to pitch it , then I discovered www.fixyourownprinter.com .	St
1.28.6	They 've got the cleaning goods for specific models of Epson printers .	St
1.28.7	I bought a small vial of cleaning solution ( they claim it 's what the Epson factory uses ) and a syringe for under $ 10 - fast shipping puts it at $ 15 .	St
1.28.8	The stuff really worked ! !	St
1.28.9	The vial was good for dozens of applications .	St
1.28.10	Give it a try .	St
1.29.1	I have An Epson 880 it must be at least 4 years old .I have used generic inks since I bought it .	St
1.29.2	It still works as well as it did then .	St
1.29.3	I just bought an Epson Stylus Photo RX620 and am using generic ink .	St
1.29.4	If I get 2-3 years out of the printer I will still save money .	St
1.30.1	I use a laser printer for B & W documents , and an ink jet for color documents .	St
1.30.2	Since I do n't use much ink , I go with the expensive & quot ; company brand & quot ; ( HP ) .	St
1.30.3	My understanding is that laser printers have a much lower price-per-page than ink jets .	St
1.31.1	After destroying My Epson c80 with generic ink from a large Office supplier , I would adamently say NO to Generic at all costs .	St
1.31.2	What I do now with my HP 7650 Photo printer is I use HP ink for Photo 's and light text and I purchased a cheap Laser printer for most of my Black text work .	St
1.31.3	It 's far more economical to do this than pay out $ 28 + bucks for ink every 200 pages .	St
1.31.4	Its like 14 cents verses less than 1 cent a page .	St
1.32.1	I have been useing Epson Inkjet printers for seven years now.I have never bought Epson Ink and have never had a problem with generic.I do a lot of Photo printing with very good resultes.If you do n't print color very often the ink has a tendincy to dry out .	St
1.33.1	These generic ink cartridges work very well with my 880 Epson Stylus color printer and I pay $ 6.40 for FIVE cartidges of black and $ 11.89 for FIVE ( YES FIVE full cartridges ) of colour .	St
1.33.2	Staples charges $ 34.95 for one black cartridge the color cartridge at Staples is $ 29.95 .	St
1.33.3	I also have an Epson 1280 large format printer and my cartriges are $ 2.60 for black and $ 3.25 for the color cartridges .	St
1.33.4	Epson black cartridges retail for $ 30.00 and the Epson color cartridges $ 35.00 at Office Depot , Futureshop and at Staples .	St
1.33.5	I have an Epson R300 Photo printer that I use mainly for cd printing .	St
1.33.6	I pay $ 37.85 for 2 sets of cartridges ( 1 black and 5 color ) and I pay $ 9.99 for an additional three black cartridges .	St
1.33.7	This totals $ 47.84 .	St
1.33.8	To get the same amount of ink from Staples would cost $ 271.65 .	St
1.33.9	Staples charges $ 22.41 for each black cartridge and $ 15.96 for each color cartridge .	St
1.33.10	I buy these from an ebay store ( ink123shop ) They have over 10,400 feedback at 99.6 % positive .	St
1.33.11	The few negatives are people who claim they did not get their order or were shorted .	St
1.33.12	( very doubtful claim ) There were NO negative feedbacks about their ink quality that I could see .	St
1.33.13	They ship out of Canada and shipping to me has been 4 - 7 business days .	St
1.33.14	I have used close to 100 cartridges and I have never ever had any issue with their generic products .	St
1.33.15	The reds are vibrant and the blacks are good and dark .	St
1.33.16	Inkjet printers seem to become problematic when they are not used for long periods of time .	St
1.33.17	Ink will dry up no matter what cartridge you use .	St
1.34.1	I have been using generic printer ink for ten years .	St
1.34.2	I have four Epson printers , all of which run on generic ink .	St
1.34.3	I can not vouch for some of the schlock operators , but klassicspecialties.com does an outstanding job .	St
1.34.4	One reservation though -- Lexmark or HP cartridges must be refilled , and the people who refill customarily do not evacuate the package , resulting in shorter shelf life .	St
1.34.5	The Epson inks look and function like new .	St
1.35.1	I have two printers : Brother MFC-3820CN & Epson Stylus Photo R300 and have used compatible cartridges in both printers for over two years and have not experienced any problems with either printer because of using a compatible .	St
1.35.2	I have used the same on-line company/supplier for those two years and am very happy with the service and their products ; all of which I would rate excellent !	St
1.35.3	Their website is : www.inkquik.com and the company is located in Tigard , Oregon .	St
1.35.4	Check it out -- I 'm sure you will be glad you did .	St
1.36.1	I 've tried refills and also Staples cartridges for my two HP printers .	St
1.36.2	Neither worked at all !	St
1.36.3	The re-fill attempt was several years ago and I ca n't explain why it would n't work .	St
1.36.4	( Maybe HP has some super chemical sensor that detected alien ink ? )	Ques
1.36.5	With the Staples ink cartridge on my 3 year old multifunction printer , the mechanism for moving the cartridge just would n't go .	St
1.36.6	I was afraid it broke , but when I replaced the cartridge with the HP brand , it worked fine again .	St
1.37.1	I have been refilling my ink cartridges for years and have n't had any problems .	St
1.37.2	I have a Canon photo i960 with six colored cartridges and I do a lot of photo printing .	St
1.37.3	The only thing I found out is a cartridge will last about a year and then the photo 's do not reproduce properly .	St
1.37.4	When that happens , I buy another set of cartridges and start refilling them .	St
1.37.5	I estimate it cost me about 10 cents to refill a cartridge .	St
1.38.1	I 've been using Inkjets R Us at http : //www.acsmsupplies.com/ for years now on my Epson Stylus 740 with no problems .	St
1.38.2	I recently bought 12 cartridges for just a litte more that the price of one Epson at Office Max .	St
1.39.1	I have n't purchased a manufacturer cartridge for at least four years .	St
1.39.2	I have to say that it was n't a smooth transition and when I started refilling HP cartridges , it was always hit or miss .	St
1.39.3	Love their printers , did n't like refilling their cartridges .	St
1.39.4	I tried Canon printers ( twice ) and they failed mechanically within the first few months .	St
1.39.5	Never got a chance to try refilling .	St
1.39.6	I understand that the newer models are mechanically better and easily re-fillable .	St
1.39.7	I now use only epson printers .	St
1.39.8	I am currently using an R220 and an R320 and went through one R200 .	St
1.39.9	The R220 has had only one set of original cartridges , the ones that came with it , all others have been refillable cartridges .	St
1.39.10	I 'm on my second set .	St
1.39.11	The first set had foam in the ink supply side of the cartridge and lasted through about a year of re-filling before having problems with trapping air .	St
1.39.12	They were replaced with the new foam-less cartridges and have had no problems .	St
1.39.13	My R320 uses an auto re-fill system with external tanks and auto-reset chips .	St
1.39.14	I never have to remove the cartridges from the printer , I just refill the external tanks .	St
1.39.15	I use a good brand of bulk ink that is designed just for the epson models that I use .	St
1.39.16	I have printed pictures and color graphics using the original inks and bulk inks to compare colors .	St
1.39.17	There is always some difference in the colors but , not enough that anyone who was looking at one picture or the other , would say that anything was off .	St
1.39.18	My reason for replying to this is : Epson printers have a bad reputation of failing just after the warranty runs out .	St
1.39.19	My R200 did fail just after warranty , was repaired and failed again within two months .	St
1.39.20	For this reason , I do n't think that I Owe Epson any allegence to buy their ink cartridges since I believe that their printers are designed to fail .	St
1.39.21	I can refill at a fraction of the cost per cartridge $ 2.00 as apposed to $ 13.00 to $ 18.00 per new and I do a lot of color printing .	St
1.39.22	One set of cartridges for either printer is about $ 85.00 .	St
1.39.23	I can replace the R220 printer for that price and It comes with a set of cartridges .	St
1.39.24	It would make better sense to just throw the printer away and buy a new one , each time you needed to replace the cartridges .	St
1.39.25	As long as I am able , I will refill my cartridges .	St
1.39.26	My advise : Search the internet for ink refills and re-fillable cartridges .	St
1.39.27	Find a site that has a good rating and dive in .	St
1.39.28	Once you get the hang of it , you 'll never go back .	St
1.39.29	Oh , buy rubber gloves and keep alchohol handy for cleanup .	St
1.40.1	Here 's not an opinion but facts ... First , the cheaper the printer , generally , the more expensive the inks .	St
1.40.2	Secondly , some printers have lower per page costs than others , and this difference can be significant .	St
1.40.3	I chose to buy a highly rated printer ( MP780 ) from a company that tends to have the lowest per page costs ( Canon ) .	St
1.40.4	Because of that , each cartridge tends to cost less than $ 10 anyways and even the generic stuff is only $ 2 a cartridge cheaper at retail .	St
1.40.5	But it 's not like I buy more than one cartridge at a time since there are 6 separate tanks .	St
1.40.6	Sure I can buy the & quot ; 10 of every cartridge & quot ; on ebay but I 'm not willing to bet that after the second cartridge or so used , the remaining will be dry- it 's true , inks tend to last just a year or two .	St
1.40.7	I guess I do n't print as many photos as the rest of you ...	St
1.41.1	This printer uses a pigmented ink rather than a water based ink .	St
1.41.2	The cartridges work on a complex siphon system .	St
1.41.3	The ink jets may not be clogged but air locked .	St
1.41.4	Go to : http : //www.refillinstructions.com/Epson/E12.htm for more information or email that company with your questions .	St
1.41.5	Note that you also need a cartridge resetter if you refill the original cartridge .	St
1.41.6	You can buy cartridges that do n't need the resetter and that are easier to refill .	St
1.41.7	This company has superior ink and excellent support .	St
1.41.8	Since printers vary so much you need specific advice .	St
1.41.9	Refilling cartridges is the least expensive way to go and if done correctly really does work .	St
1.41.10	Buying generic or recycled cartridges and work also if you shop carefully .	St
1.41.11	I buy generic cartridges from lasermonks.com for their low prices and to support their mission efforts .	St
1.41.12	There are other good sources so you have many to choose from .	St
1.41.13	I avoid the ink refillers and bulk ink companies to send out spam .	St
1.41.14	There is no way I would do business with any of them .	St
1.41.15	If you need more help let me know .	St
1.42.1	You can order the ink carterages from www.inksell.com .	St
1.43.1	Absolutely agree with the short life from Epson printers .	St
1.43.2	I have had 4 R300s fail , due to faulty PC boards , in two years and told that all were uneconomical to repair .	St
1.43.3	Epson were polite but absolutely useless at coming up with any repacement help .	St
1.43.4	As for paying the ridiculious price of their cartridges when I obtain the same results for a tenth of their price , they must think we were born yesterday .	St
1.43.5	Stick to tank feed systems which have no sponge in the cartridges .	St
1.44.1	First of all , Epsons do break down after heavy use .	St
1.44.2	Secondly , with the money you save on generic ink , you can buy a newer , more advanced printer .	St
1.44.3	I have never in five epsons had a problem with klassicspecialties.com .	St
1.44.4	Epson must love your buddy .	St
1.45.1	Printing in colour produces blank pages ( actually I can sometimes get a bit of pale blue ) .	St
1.45.2	Even when I have black only selected in the printer control it will not print unless I have three colour cartridges .	St
1.45.3	Nothing comes out of them apparently but then the printer decides the ink has run out and I need to buy new ones .	St
1.46.1	I have used ink kits for ink refills for Lexmark cartridges with very good results , provided I print out every day a test page or other material .	St
1.46.2	I am now using a kit called iPRiNT with no problems ( I have used up all the ink in the kit in some 3 or 4 refills ) so long as I follow the rule of a printout everyday .	St
1.46.3	I used , in the distant past , a kit called Universal Inkjet Refill System .	St
1.46.4	The results with it were equal to or better than the iPRiNT kit .	St
1.46.5	A refill kit consisting of plastic bellows with attached needle filled with ink from Wal-Mart was a disaster .	St
1.46.6	The iPRiNT I found at Target ; the Universal kit was some time ago advertised by CVS at something like $ 10 for three 25 ml bottles of ink .	St
1.46.7	Included was a syringe , bottle of solvent , and instructions .	St
1.46.8	The iPRiNT kit is essentially the same as the Universal kit .	St
1.46.9	I have also tried the technique of pulling out the cartridge and setting it on a wet paper towel to get the ink flowing after a time of no use .	St
1.46.10	This works very well .	Polite
1.46.11	However , after several removals and replacements of the cartidge a ridge locking the cartridge in place broke off and the cartridge would no longer lock in place .	St
1.46.12	Under those conditions a replacement cartridge was needed .	St
1.46.13	I have used a tool which I made consisting of a strip of metal about three-quarters-inch wide with a layer of felt cemented to it .	St
1.46.14	This tool I use to soak the bottom of the cartridge while in place without removal .	St
1.46.15	The Lexmark cartridge can be parked in place at the center-front of the carriage permitting the water-soaked felt strip to be slipped under ; a minute or less of soaking is generally enough to get the ink flowing .	St
1.46.16	This also worked well .	St
1.46.17	I have used a remanufactured cartridge in one case and gotten satisfactory results .	St
1.46.18	There will always be one that will not perform well , or will leak ink , or show other problems .	St
1.46.19	In the one case , the first cartridge did not work and the supplier replaced it without charge .	St
1.46.20	Remanufactured cartridges save only little in cost and it is a turkey shoot to get a satisfactory replacement .	St
1.46.21	In my view , the difference in cost between a new cartridge , a remanufacture cartridge , and a refill system is totally in favor of the refill and I intend to go looking for a Universal kit shortly .	St
1.46.22	Good luck , Sick of Bush	Polite
1.47.1	It 's a very good question .	Polite
1.47.2	I have just purchased a top of the range Canon all-in-one printer and the integrated software will NOT allow me to use generic inks .	St
1.47.3	It will also record any instances of me doing so and void any warranty .	St
1.47.4	Canon tell me that generic inks are inferior and can damage the print head .	Sug
1.47.5	I am not prepared to risk it because the printer is very pricey .	St
1.47.6	If , however you have a cheaper printer , I would certainly take the risk as the money saved over time would more than compensate if the printer ultimately needed replacing .	St
1.48.1	Do you use a specific generic epson ink or just any one that you see ?	Ques
1.49.1	I 've found the very cheap inks have a tendency for the cartridges to run dry - either that or they do n't actually contain much ink .	St
1.49.2	( Yes easily 5x cheaper than Epson originals ) .	St
1.49.3	More expensive cartridges do much better and are fine for day to day work .	St
1.49.4	But for high quality output on quality papers and for true colour reproduction you really need the manufacturer 's own cartridges .	St
1.49.5	My problems with past Epson printers has been with nozzles clogging .	St
1.49.6	This always seemed to happen more frequently with third party inks and I found I used half my ink doing head cleaning cycles .	St
1.49.7	However I only use my home printer every now and then .	St
1.49.8	The danger is that if one or more nozzles are starved of ink during printing then they can over heat and burn out - the flow of ink acts as a lubricant and coolant to the nozzles .	St
1.49.9	If this happens then your printer is useless and no amount of cleaning will fix it .	St
1.49.10	Anyway after several broken Epson printers over the years I 've now bought an HP printer - that way you get a new print head with every new cartridge .	St
1.50.1	I have an Epson Color 880 for four years .	St
1.50.2	I use nothing but generic ink and I have never had a problem .	St
1.50.3	Occasionally , I print family photos as large as 8 X 10 , with very good results .	St
1.51.1	I have been refilling ink cartridges for years in my HP printer .	St
1.51.2	I had no poblems filling them myself .	St
1.51.3	I would refill original HP cartridges 3 times and then buy a fresh OEM cartridge , refill that 3 times and so on .	St
1.51.4	The one time that I use a refurbished cartridge from Staples , the cartridge leaked and ruined my printer .	St
1.51.5	Luckily , the printer was old anyway so it was n't a loss .	St
1.51.6	Thew problem with refurbished cartridges is that you do n't know how many times it has beed refilled .	St
1.52.1	That was a heck of a testimonial , and their feedback rating ca n't be beat .	St
1.52.2	I 'm gon na try them out .	St
1.52.3	With the money I 'd save on one set of cartridges , I can afford to buy another printer if it does n't work out .	St
1.52.4	Not saying it wo n't work out , mind you .	St
1.52.5	Just needed that last bit of reasoning to talk myself into it .	St
1.52.6	Christa	St
1.53.1	I had never heard of them until now .	St
1.53.2	Thanks for the heads up - they have toner carts for my OkiPage 6e !	St
1.53.3	My little old slow-as-all-get-out 6e .	St
1.53.4	I use it to print plain text pages ( my scripts and research articles mostly ) .	St
1.53.5	It still works great - as long as I 'm not in a hurry .	St
1.53.6	I 've refilled the cart that 's in it about 10 times .	St
1.53.7	( Spread out lots of newspaper , do n't wear good clothes , etc .	St
1.53.8	) It 's time for a new cart and maybe a new drum .	St
1.53.9	It 's seen a lot of use .	St
1.53.10	Ah , they do n't make 'em like they used to .	St
1.54.1	Iv'e been using a Canon i865 for several years now , started of with Canon inks at $ 26Aust after 12 months changed to generic at $ 8Aust never had a problem and the same quallity .	St
1.54.2	I do stay with using quality paper though .	St
1.55.1	Willy , I 'm very interested in the types of repairs you have effected on Epson printers .	St
1.55.2	I am currently wrestling with an Epson C80 Stylus , for a buddy of mine ( I enjoy the challenge of trying to help others , and am generally successful , although not bashful about asking for advice/help from others when I 'm stumped ) .	St
1.55.3	After returning from a three week trip , my friend could not get this Epson to print .	St
1.55.4	He purchased , and installed , replacement recycled cartridges from Office Depot .	St
1.55.5	Still would not print , even though the Ink Monitor indicated plenty of ink in each of the cartridges .	St
1.55.6	I suspected dried nozzles .	St
1.55.7	I 've gone through the ''Nozzle Clean '' cycles more times than I care to count .	St
1.55.8	Printing the pattern started to show a little of the pattern but never more than that .	St
1.55.9	Is there a manual method of cleaning the nozzles ?	Ques
1.55.10	I must confess , I have n't been able to determine the ink path from the cartridge ( tank ) to the paper .	St
1.55.11	Would greatly appreciate any guidance you can offer .	Polite
1.55.12	Thanks .	Polite
1.55.13	Pete	St
1.56.1	I 'm fishing for as much help as I can get .	St
1.56.2	Your description for unclogging sounds extremely useful .	St
1.56.3	Could you please explain the distinction you make between ''inkjets '' and ''print heads '' .	Sug
1.56.4	I 'm dealing with an Epson Stylus C80 and Epson Stylus C82 .	St
1.56.5	Thanks for any assistance you can provide .	St
1.56.6	Pete Edman	St
1.57.1	I have had a problem where I let one color go too far down , and the nozzle clogged .	St
1.57.2	There is no quick fix .	St
1.57.3	I generally , after running the nozzle cleaning utility several times , until I see a faint print pattern .	St
1.57.4	Leave it set over night , and the nozzle ( s ) seem to clear .	St
1.58.1	Your printer uses cartridges very much like the cartridges on my Epson Stylus Photo R220 .	St
1.58.2	They work on a siphon principle .	St
1.58.3	The inkjets are in the box that holds the cartridges .	St
1.58.4	In other words the ink is feed from the cartridge to the ink jets .	St
1.58.5	The OEM cartridges are designed to be used only one time , but you can refill them and use a device called a & quot ; resetter & quot ; which fools the printer into & quot ; thinking & quot ; you have a new cartridge .	St
1.58.6	You can buy replacemeent cartridges that auto reset with each use and are easier to refill .	St
1.58.7	In fact I filled a set of those cartridges today and made some beautiful color prints and some nice CD labels ( The R220 can print right on a printable white CD or DVD ) .	St
1.58.8	I suggest you contact the folks at the Printer Filling Station by email .	Sug
1.58.9	They can tell you just what you need to do and what supplies you need to buy to get started refilling the cartridges .	Sug
1.58.10	BTW the empty replacement cartridges are worth the money .	St
1.58.11	You do n't need the resetter to use these cartridges and you can fill them while the cartridge is in the printer .	St
1.58.12	Very Neat !	St
1.58.13	My Canon BJC 3000 wo n't last much longer but it still works fine for doing a few sheets at a time .	St
1.58.14	I was ready to toss it and these folks told me about the taking out the box and cleaning it with a hot water bath .	St
1.58.15	I also have a HP deskjet 3820 that I hate .	St
1.58.16	The ink drys out unless I use it at least once every two or three days .	St
1.58.17	The color cartridge has all three colors in one cartridge .	St
1.58.18	I can refill it , but I mainly limit this printer to use in printing checks using the Versa magnetic black ink , but that 's another story .	St
1.58.19	You can email the Printing Filling Staion at : mailto : passone @ bellsouth.net or via their web sit at : http : //www.printerfillingstation.com/PFS/contact.htm Glenn H .	St
1.59.1	I 've had good and bad experience with refill ink .	St
1.59.2	good ink I have used is from 123refills.com and also from sameink.com - good comprehensive refill instructions and also they have tech support by email if you need it .	St
1.59.3	I have not used it on an epson printer as I do n't own one !	St
1.59.4	but I have used it on my cannon pixma 3000 and also on my hp all in one unit .	St
1.59.5	they both worked great for regular printing .	St
1.59.6	sameink inks worked best on my cannon for picture printing .	St
1.59.7	the bad ink I purchased was from filljet.com - not that it did not work , but the colors were not as bright .	St
1.59.8	the black was almost gray !	St
1.60.1	www.123refills.com www.sameink.com they both have good inks , and good c/s and suport for their product .	St
1.61.1	wha do you mean by wick the ink through the heads ?	Ques
1.61.2	is this needed to be done for a cannon printer ?	Ques
1.61.3	Bob .	St
1.62.1	If you are getting real cleaning problems I would suggest that you purchase a set of cleaning cartridges , available from 7dayshop.com ; they contain only cleaning fluid .	St
1.62.2	I have found that if the nozzles will not give a good nozzle print after three goes ( colour cartridges installed ) , stop and leave the printer over night , they clear themselves 99 % of the time .	St
1.62.3	Once again go for a feed system cheaper than refill cartridges and no mess and no sponge in the tanks .	St
1.63.1	There are fancy cleaning ink carts you buy from ink refill sources , but again , heres ' what I do .	St
1.63.2	Get your hands on paper shop towels ( like mechanics use ) or clean cloth like an old T-shirt .	St
1.63.3	Cut or tear into a small swatch , soak in warm water , wring out , but leave damp .	St
1.63.4	Place under nozzle parking station where the ink carts rest .	St
1.63.5	The damp swatch is between the ink cart nozzle face and the parking cap .	St
1.63.6	Use the wide printing gap for envelope to increase distance and allow swatch to rest there .	St
1.63.7	Now , allow the swatch overnight and test in the morning , repeat until successful .	St
1.63.8	Since this is long process and uses ink , yada , yada , it really is a last resort for the user .	St
1.63.9	In no way allow a inkjet printer to be left unused too long as & quot ; drying/clogging & quot ; occurs and in Epson 's a PITA .	St
1.63.10	Unlike other inkjet vendors , you can replace the ink carts since the nozzles are part of it , you usually correct the problem , not so with Epson .	St
1.63.11	Canon too has the problem but at least you can buy the nozzle assembly and far easier than Epson to repair .	St
1.63.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.64.1	If finding an ICC is a problem , you can make your own for an Epson , better than this is to puchase one from Pureprofiles at around 20 .	St
1.64.2	I have done this and the difference is amazing .	St
1.64.3	This is a very good , helpful company and is well worth the outlay .	St
1.64.4	Some companies charge 10 times this for a profile .	St
1.64.5	Incidently I have no interest connection with this company	St
1.65.1	Wait till you own a Dell Printer .	St
1.65.2	You have a limited resource , It 's made by Lexmark but Dell has the rights to only Dell Ink Cartridges .	St
1.65.3	I did see a Lexmark adapter for a Dell Printer but none of my friends will take a chance to see if it works .	St
1.65.4	I too have come across fairly new printers with after market ink cart .	St
1.65.5	and boy did it make a mess .	St
1.65.6	To me it was'nt worth cleaning , the sopping pad was over filled and the ink was all over top to bottom with ink .	St
1.65.7	Walgreens advertise refills @ half cost but i do'nt know of any of my friends have tried it .	St
1.65.8	Test it and let us know .	St
1.65.9	Thanks Ron	St
1.66.1	I have 3 Epson printers and use generic ink in the one that I do n't print photos with .	St
1.66.2	I 've never had a problem and it 's 1/3 the cost of the regular cartridges from Epson .	St
1.66.3	I 'm not aware of any hardware problems from the ink. , Is there something specific that you know of that your friend had happen ?	Ques
1.66.4	It does depend on what you are printing , too , as far as longer term quality retention .	St
1.67.1	I HAVE had this happen .	St
1.67.2	I never knew if it was because they are generic or if the Epson ones do the same .	St
1.67.3	But if it has even been just a couple of days I may get terrible color output and once in awhile black , too .	St
1.67.4	But I 've had that happen with the Epson cartridges , too .	St
1.68.1	Could you please explain what a feed system is ?	Ques
1.68.2	Thanks !	St
1.69.1	To all who responded to my inquiries , Please accept my sincerest gratitude for your very timely , prompt , instructive information .	St
1.69.2	I have made a composite of all the input you provided and will make good use of all I 've learned from you .	St
1.69.3	Again , many thanks .	Polite
1.69.4	Pete Edman	St
1.70.1	I have an epson printer and use generic cartidges that are 1/2-1/3 the price of OEM .	St
1.70.2	I have never had a problem with this method .	St
1.70.3	I had a previous Stylus that was ruined by trying to do refills .	St
1.70.4	I strongly advise against .	St
1.70.5	It is not worth ruining the printer head ; which means you might as well get a new printer .	St
1.70.6	I have a one year old canon Pixma 850 .	St
1.70.7	I love it .	St
1.70.8	I only buy generic , both the photo and regular inks .	St
1.70.9	I order online ( from xxx injets.com ) .	St
1.70.10	Shipping is free and no tax .	St
1.70.11	Since I do very little color printing and the black gets used a lot , I buy 12 30ml .	St
1.70.12	cartidges for every one color or black for photo .	St
1.70.13	Although printing with color ( maps , etc . )	St
1.70.14	is prety , I never do it .	St
1.70.15	What a waste .	St
1.70.16	I can remove and replace the color cartridges at will .	St
1.70.17	Ca n't do that with the HP and Lexmark rip-off machines !	St
1.70.18	BTW , if you believe that your cartridge has dried out rather than being empty , here 's a fix .	St
1.70.19	put a small amount of Windex in a shallow saucer and set the catridge in it for a short while .	St
1.70.20	The spongy material will absorb it and dissolve the dried out ink .	St
1.71.1	I used an Epson 777 for about three years .	St
1.71.2	Worked very well in the beginning but with time the print-jets seemed to work less reliable .	St
1.71.3	I would spend endless times and lots of expensive ink to run cleaning-cycles , ever less successfully .	St
1.71.4	Print quality was getting very bad .	St
1.71.5	Because of high cost of Epson cartridges used up just in cleaning-cycles tried & quot ; generic ink & quot ; and cleaning-solutions .	St
1.71.6	Not any better .	St
1.71.7	A Fry offer of refurbished Canon I550 for $ 50 looked great as a replacement : the cartridges in the printer were worth more than the total cost !	St
1.71.8	Two other good points : the print-nozzles are on a separate frame and can be bought ~ $ 50 .	St
1.71.9	Also , the BCI-3e cartridges are only ~1/2 foam and the rest are fluid-reservoir -- - allowing more ink to be put into the cartridge .	St
1.71.10	Refill signal works well : reservoir is really empty when warning comes up .	St
1.71.11	Have used IMS-Ink bought at COSTCO for $ 17 , with 240 ml Black , 80 ml each Cyan , Magenta , Yellow , Photo-Cyan , Photo-Magenta .	St
1.71.12	Did 24 refills by now of the black cartridge delivered with printer , 8 refills each with the three original color-cartridges .	St
1.71.13	Almost used up one refill kit over three years !	St
1.71.14	No problems , no cleaning cycles ever done .	St
1.71.15	Seems to be a good combination for me !	St
1.72.1	The feed system consists of a bank of 6 external tanks ( this is for a R300 Epson ) with a set of tubes going to a bank of six special cartridges installed in the printer .	St
1.72.2	These tubes are a permanent fixture and and designed to travel with the printer cartridges while printing .	St
1.72.3	This is all supplied as a kit , cost approx 35 .	St
1.72.4	Each external tank holds 100ml of i.e .	St
1.72.5	equvilent to six cartridges .	St
1.72.6	When the cartridge in the printer reaches approx 10 % ink level the system automatically resets the chip to full .	St
1.72.7	All you ever have to do is top up the external tanks which merely involves opening the tank and literally pouring the ink from a bottle , no removal of anything and absolutely no mess .	St
1.72.8	Ink can be bought for between 15 and 25 from Ebay sites , this is for 6 x 100ml bottles , which is equivelent to 60 yes 60 cartridges .	St
1.72.9	When a system as cheap as this is available I am bemused as to why so many of these replies are about refilling cartrides .	St
1.72.10	Throw away the cartridges and invest in a feed system , type in ''ink feed systems '' on the internet search , there are lots of sites in America .	St
1.72.11	I have been using this system for 2 years and I get through a normal set of cartridges in 2 to 3 weeks , my outlay for ink over this period has been 40 the equivelent Epson cartridges would be in the region of 1500 , whats that about $ 2300 ! !	St
1.72.12	!	St
1.73.1	do you know if this feed system is also on the Epson R320 ?	Ques
1.73.2	KT	St
1.74.1	I have an Epson R220 and a R320 .	St
1.74.2	The same auto refill system will fit the R200 , R220 , R300 , R320 and R340 .	St
1.74.3	They all take the same cartridges .	St
1.74.4	Follow the directions closly on installation , it can be tricky but worth the work .	St
1.74.5	I use re-fillable cartridges in my R220 and a Auto Fill system in my R320 .	St
1.74.6	When the re-fillable cartridges in my R220 reach the end of their life , ( yes everything has an end ) I will replace them with an Auto Refill system .	St
1.74.7	Once you get set up and running , you 'll never think about going back to cartridges .	St
1.74.8	( Manufacturer , or aftermarket )	St
1.75.1	Yes , cheaper printer = higher ink cost .	St
1.75.2	It 's not all that obvious at first , because you ca n't always tell by the price of the cartridges - you have to consider how much ink is actually in the cartridges !	St
1.75.3	I may be old & fat , but I think I can still run fast enough to get away from someone trying to give me another Lexmark .	St
1.75.4	I have a really cheap Lexmark that I actually like , but no longer use it because I ca n't afford to keep ink in it !	St
1.75.5	Had another Lexmark all-in-one that I gave away brand new in the box - I got it free with a computer I bought ( used the same ink cartridges ! )	St
1.75.6	I have an Epson 1280 I paid around $ 400 for .	St
1.75.7	Besides the fact that the ink cartridges seem to last much longer ( must have had 3-4 times as much ink as the lexmarks ) , I now have it outfitted with a CFS ( continous flow system - referred to in earlier post as a & quot ; Feed System & quot ; aka Bulk feed system .	St
1.75.8	I chose that particular printer because I needed a wide printer and I wanted one that I could get a CFS for .	St
1.75.9	I have n't found anyone who makes a CFS for lexmark .	St
1.75.10	The lexmark cartridges were difficult to refill ( compared to previous experience with refilling HP , Canon , & even Epson cartridges ) and then most did n't work even with a chip resetter !	St
1.76.1	While not all generic inks are created equal , it really depends mostly on what kind of printing you do .	St
1.76.2	If mostly text & 2D artwork , generic is probably OK .	St
1.76.3	I have had experience with some generic ink colors looking muddy or dull on photo prints .	St
1.76.4	On the store branded generics ( ie Staples , OfficeMax , etc . )	St
1.76.5	I do n't see a big enough difference in the cost for the loss of quality for photo printer ( paper quality also makes a big difference for photos . )	St
1.76.6	I also tried some ink that was very cheap I got online , but had to order 4 cartridges to make shipping charges worthwhile - Well I have 3 unopened , collecting dust on the boxes and took the first one out and put it in trash while it still had plenty of ink .	St
1.76.7	I could not accept the poor quality for my purposes ( mostly photos & T-shirt transfers ) .	St
1.76.8	When used for T-shirt transfers , even with professional quality transfer paper & professional heat press , the colors from the cheaper ink ran when washed .	St
1.76.9	The ink I 'm using now is not OEM , but I would n't call it generic or even cheap ( although it does save me more $ than the cheap cartridges ) .	St
1.76.10	I bought a CFS ( continous flow system ) for my Epson that I am extremely pleased with !	St
1.76.11	There are many companies to choose from for Epson printers & even some Canons .	St
1.76.12	I did a lot of research before investing - some systems said you could only use their inks , and others had very complicated installation instructions .	St
1.76.13	I finally chose a system from http : //www.inksupply.com/ .	St
1.76.14	Their system was supposed to work with most any bulk inks , but they had several kinds to choose from depending on your needs .	St
1.76.15	I chose the archival inks for T-shirt transfers ( and they also sell a very good transfer paper actually cheaper than our previous supplier ) .	St
1.76.16	Their archival ink produces better results than the original Epson branded inks .	St
1.76.17	You have to spend a little more upfront for the system , but I 've already done enough printing that I would have already spent more on individual cartidges than what the system & ink cost and I had even bought an extra refill set because I was n't sure how much printing I could do before refilling .	St
1.76.18	The lowest bottle of ink is still over half full !	St
1.76.19	Also , when I need more , I can order just the color I need - not all six .	St
1.76.20	Also , the bottles sit outside the printer and you can actually see how much ink is in them .	St
1.76.21	I am thrilled with this set-up .	St
1.76.22	It will cost a little more to get started if you have a lexmark printer , because you 'll have to trash the lexmark & buy Epson or Canon ( but check which models you can get CFS for before you buy ) .	St
1.77.1	Also known as bulk ink system .	St
1.77.2	See my other post on upper level of this thread or http : //www.inksupply.com/ There are many other suppliers of these systems , the one referenced was my personal choice .	St
1.78.1	This is most detailed instructions I 've found online : http : //www.repairfaq.org/samnew/printfaq/pcfesc800cph.htm Plus , this one is not trying to sell a specific cleaning kit .	St
1.79.1	I use generic ink , and my epson quit working under warranty .	St
1.79.2	Epson fixed it .	St
1.79.3	Let 's face it , the 5x cost of ink makes the purchase of a new printer a viable option .	St
1.79.4	But maybe you like being gouged .	St
1.80.1	The Everest system I have looks a lot tidier set up than the ones from your recommended supplier and costs far less i.e .	St
1.80.2	42 ( 70ish dollars ) filled with dye base and 67 ( 100ish dollars ) with pigment ink .	St
1.80.3	The system has worked perfectly for two years , Type 6739728711 on Ebay search which will take you direst to the site	St
1.81.1	Message from ebay This listing ( 6739728711 ) has been removed or is no longer available .	St
1.81.2	Please make sure you entered the right item number .	Sug
1.81.3	If the listing was removed by eBay , consider it canceled .	St
1.81.4	Note : Listings that have ended more than 90 days ago will no longer appear on eBay .	St
1.82.1	Consider Walgreens , Office Depot or Office Max for an advertised 60 % savings on ink re-fills .	St
1.82.2	If you have them in your area , a fairly new franchise operation called Cartridge World boasts similar savings and offers some & quot ; guarantees & quot ; , but read the fine print ( no pun intended ) .	St
1.82.3	Good luck !	Polite
1.83.1	instead of it consider a cheap b & w laser printer .	St
1.83.2	If you want to print photos , it is better and cheaper to upload them to one of many photo printer sites , or stop by a local drugstore .	St
1.83.3	So unless you must have color for presentations , or such look at laser printers .	St
1.83.4	At Fry 's ( if you leave near one ) and other discount stores you can get a decent laser b & w printer for $ 50 on sale .	St
1.83.5	It prints faster , better and cheaper per page !	St
1.83.6	than any ink jet you can find .	St
1.83.7	It does not waste ink to clean nozzles every time you turn it on , it does not dry out if you do n't use it for days , etc.. since it uses powder .	St
1.83.8	And if you decide to get an ink jet anyway , BEWARE of Epson ! !	St
1.83.9	Epson 's scheming to suck your money went beyond any other company it seems .	St
1.83.10	If you run out of ink in any cartridge the printer refuses to print at all ! !	St
1.83.11	Even if you just want to print a short note , and do n't mind to use blue instead of black .	Sug
1.83.12	NO , they know better what you need !	St
1.83.13	Run to a store for a new cartridge , or take a Valium .	St
1.83.14	If you use printer only occasionally , you will find out that all your ink is gone quickly anyways , just to clean those nozzles .	St
1.83.15	In fact , there is still quite a bit ink left in the cartridge , but you need special hardware gadget to unlock a build in chip , which prevents you from using it .	St
1.83.16	And nowadays , you can also find reasonably priced color laser printers .	St
1.83.17	Go laser	St
1.84.1	I opted in to the suit since my R200 has semi-frequent issues with & quot ; false empty & quot ; reporting ; far from receiving a new printer or the equivalent in cartridges , my choices for compensation were either : 1 ) a 45 $ credit to order cartridges from Epson 's E-store or a 25 $ cheque and 20 $ E-store credit , or B ) a 25 % discount off Epson E-Store purchases for a total discount of up to 100 $ .	St
1.84.2	Since I certainly did n't want the 400 $ worth of Epson stuff I would have had to order to take full advantage of the 100 $ /25 % off deal , I chose the measly 45 $ store credit - at least it gets me a few new cartridges for my ink-guzzling printer .	St
1.85.1	Sorry Got a bit confused some where Numbers are 6839727590 and 6839728711 these item are on the site as of 13-00 UK time 12 Sept Regards derek R	St
1.86.1	I did not use my canon i9900 photo printer for a while. , I did use a generic ink , and had a problem with one cartridge .	St
1.86.2	( to be fair , I have a friend who had the same issue with a canon cartridge ) But , after not using the printer for a while because I did not have time to deal with the problem , I am wonndering whether this method of clening will work for this printer and print head .	St
1.86.3	Would someone please address the canon print heads and cleaning ?	Ques
1.86.4	Thank you .	St
1.86.5	Sandy	St
1.87.1	Can I ask where you bought the new print head from and what Canon printer you are using ?	Ques
1.87.2	I have an i9900 and I may need a new print head .	St
1.87.3	And do you use printer profiles to print photos ?	Ques
1.88.1	I 've used generic printer ink for about 3 years and it has worked fine .	St
1.88.2	I have an HP 820CSe printer and have had no problems .	St
1.88.3	Maybe other printers do n't like the generic ink .	St
1.88.4	amelia	St
1.89.1	Drug store prices are far from being cheaper .	St
1.89.2	Using a bulk feed system the ink for an A4 best quality photo costs 4 pence , using A4 premium photo 275grm paper , from a recognised producer , purchased from an internet sources ( 7dayshop.com ) costs 20 pence a sheet , a total of 24 pence , whats that approx 40 cents for an A4 photo , Tell me where 's the drug store charging these prices ?	Ques
1.90.1	Having contributed several replies to this forum and being aware of the dye based nozzle blocking problems being experienced by so many , just to deviate a bit , is there any evidence that pigment ink is better or worse regarding blocked nozzles compared with dye based inks ?	Ques
1.91.1	Thank you kindly .	St
1.91.2	This information is very usefull for me .	St
1.91.3	Great site !	St

1.92.1	Hi , I actually bought the printhead from Ebay , but it was a Canon printhead and a replacement part .	St
1.92.2	My printer is an i850 .	St
1.92.3	I do n't use profiles , just kind of print and go .	St
1.92.4	& lt ; g & gt ; Tom	St
1.93.1	Thankyou for responding .	St
1.93.2	I appreciate the information .	Polite
1.93.3	Sandy	St
1.94.1	The over night trick to clear the nozzle usually works for me .	St
1.94.2	Another trick is , if one nozzle in blocked , is to print a word document that has a lot of print on it , but change the colour of the print to the same as the blocked nozzle and print on the plain paper setting but change the type of paper to photo/best photo setting , doing this makes the printer deposit far more ink that in the text setting thus acting as a cleaning cycle .	St
1.94.3	It also saves wasting ink form the other cartridges while doing a complete head clean .	St
1.95.1	Generic ink which is much cheaper will not damage your printer as the inks are the same , but under a different name .	St
1.95.2	The best way to save money is to buy your inks in larger amounts , as these can be brought from Coles or Woolworths , Harvey Norman Ect , and fill your cartridge yourself .	St
1.95.3	I have been using these inks for many years in my proffessional photo printer and have researched there origin and there is no difference between them .	St
1.95.4	If you Epson was damaged it was not caused by the ink .	St
1.96.1	I have been using generic ink and toner refills for about 5 years now and have yet to have a problem .	St
1.96.2	You must follow the directions to the hilt however .	Sug
1.96.3	I have used inkproducts.com for years on my Canon 's and HP 's with great results.I have not tried to use any of the special photo catridges or refilled them yet .	St
1.96.4	Their prices are very reasonable and saves me over 50 % .	St
1.96.5	They also have the toner refills for my Xerox P12 laser printer .	St
1.96.6	I have refill the same original cartridge 4 times and it is still perfect .	St
1.96.7	Abtrecyclers.com claims to meet ISO 800 .	St
1.96.8	I ordered HP ink refills for a 3650 just to see their quality .	St
1.96.9	Have n't had to test yet due to my original cartridges are almost full .	St
1.97.1	I have an EPSON Stylus Color R300 and have never had a problem with generic inks .	St
1.97.2	But I just had a bad experience with the company that sells them .	St
1.97.3	Inkjets.com .	St
1.97.4	I ordered 2 complete sets on September 2nd and I just received them today September 19th .	St
1.97.5	I want to warn other people .	St
1.97.6	Really poor service !	St
1.97.7	The e-mail I sent them came back even though I used their web site to write to them .	St
1.97.8	They must be going out of business .	St
1.97.9	I 'm going to find a new company since they 're much more inexpensive this way .	St
1.97.10	Does anybody have suggestions ?	Ques
1.98.1	I 'm on my fourth Canon printer in 15 years .	St
1.98.2	For the last 7 years I 've used generic ink .	St
1.98.3	I find the results are really worth payng 8 times less .	St
1.98.4	The amount of ink in the replacement tanks do n't go as far as Canon 's .	St
1.98.5	I use a tank of ink a month for each color .	St
1.98.6	But that goes really far , 1000 pages .	St
1.98.7	Quality seems the same , even when I make photo 's on preium glossy photo paper .	St
1.98.8	I would recommend it over refilling them yourself which can be messy .	St

1.100.4	Shipping is under $ 10.00 .	St
1.100.5	I buy these from an ebay store ( http : //stores.ebay.com/Ink123shop ) They have over 19,400 sales with feedback at 99.6 % positive .	St
1.100.6	The few negatives are people who claim they did not get their order or were shorted .	St
1.100.7	( very doubtful claim ) There were NO negative feedbacks about their ink quality that I could see .	St
1.100.8	They ship out of Canada and shipping to me has been 4 - 7 business days .	St
1.100.9	I 'm in Alberta nd they are nearly 2000 miles away in Ontario .	St
1.100.10	I have never had an issue with their ink or the way that they conduct their business .	St
1.101.1	The generic inks sold as one ink for all printers are not a good thing .	St
1.101.2	Some OEM are soy based inks , some are water based , some have alcohol ... in other words they use different formulas .	St
1.101.3	The ink I buy from Printer Filling Station is very carefully chosen to match the OEM formula .	St
1.101.4	I gladly use the ink sold by Printer Filling Station but I feel I would be taking a gamble on the generic & quot ; one ink for all printer & quot ; variety .	St

1.102.2	I never had any experience with compatible inks until about a month ago when my small office manager decided to spring for a Xerox 8500 ; we realized right away that we would get killed on ink prices though , so we tried the compatibles .	St
1.102.3	I think the we bought the ink at www.suppliesguys.com .	St
1.102.4	I know the 8500 is a larger printer and not likely to be used by the average consumer , but I can say the compatibles we used were really great and they cost a lot less then the OEM stuff , so I 'd assume it would be the same with all printers ... and when the company is doing good , I 'm doing good , you know what I mean ?
