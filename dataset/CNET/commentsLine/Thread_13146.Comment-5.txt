that's fine and how i see many working drives.
&quot;my computer labels it as a cd-rom, i'll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works.
though somebody gave me this site,&quot; i don't see how that applies.
if you want to play a dvd, you'll need dvd player software such as windvd, powerdvd.
