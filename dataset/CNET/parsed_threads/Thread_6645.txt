<s> I checked one GTX 285 card and it requires: 575W PCI Express-compliant system power supply with a combined 12V current rating of 42A or more* Two 6-pin PCI Express supplementary power connectors -or- One 6-pin PCI Express and two 4-pin peripheral supplementary power connectors NOTE: For the power requirements of multiple GeForce GTX 285-based graphics cards in an NVIDIA SLI configuration, please visit www.bfgtech.com/slipower *Minimum system power requirement based on a PC configured with an Intel Core i7 965 Extreme Edition processor Bottom line you need to pick a card, get the specific specs and pick a good quality PSU ....maybe a 700 or 750W PSU. </s>
<s> It pays to have the head room and an efficient PSU. </s>
<s> Here's one.... 750W by Corsair http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006 $99.00 after rebate VAPCMD </s>
