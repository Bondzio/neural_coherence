<s> Your opinion please. </s>
<s> I bought my Dell 4550 series in 2002 and I'm in need of upgrading it or buying a new one. </s>
<s> What do you think is the best thing to do? </s>
<s> The specs are: Intel Pentium 4 Process at 2.0 GHZ, 256 DDR SDRAM at 266MHz, 30GB ultra ATA/ 100 Hard Drive 7200RPM. </s>
<s> I use it for basic college work, downloading music (have maybe 600 songs & download 10/ per month), take plenty of pics and I'm looking into editing and maybe getting a camcorder to play with a maybe edit. </s>
<s> In the next two years I will also be using in the field of elementary education as a teacher. </s>
<s> Thanks for your ideas! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Get rid of Limewire or similar P2P (security and legal risk) 2. </s>
<s> Remove the spyware and viruses that you let in with it. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Get the RAM to at least 512MB. </s>
<s> At that point, it should be a decent system for basic college/business work. </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4550/specs.htm#1101572 If you really need a new desktop today, look to a system based around an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Adding a larger hard drive and or an up-to- date DVD burner might help too. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Check you system specs, if the cpu is a 478-socket(Intel) then you pretty much got little cpu to grow on, replace ASAP, if at 400FSB. </s>
<s> If a P4 at FSB500 or even FSB800, you got some room to really get better and add some more ram. </s>
<s> However, for all the cost, you can seriously think a replacement system if only to move on an 'investment' the money spent on newer technology and such. </s>
<s> Any upgrades like more ram, bigger HD, etc. </s>
<s> could for a few $ more be spent on new system. </s>
<s> Even a basic new system is in the $500 or less with alot of goodies that would be what any upgrades may provide into an old system. </s>
<s> At this time of year, it would be very possible to get a decent system to select from and be ahead of any upgrades for awhile. </s>
<s> Your old system is still worth something and most data can be swapped to new system. </s>
<s> At the rate you're going, added audio and video files alone require a larger HD. </s>
<s> Since, you want edit/play media a faster system is a practical must, plus if an XP based system you may want to look into Media Center type of OS. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Upgrade may even cost more than a new system. </s>
<s> With Vista so close at hand keeping an old system may just be a waste. </s>
<s> If Missj1235 can hold off with the camcorder side of it then buying a new system after bugs are out of Vista may be the way to go. </s>
<s> I have choosen to wait and see what comes out of the Microsoft OS works. </s>
<s> Maybe Missj1235 should look at what camcorder will meet the need and see what system will work it now. </s>
<s> Then see if up-grading old system will do or hold off till the smoke clears away from Vista. </s>
<s> I'm not sure but wouldn't a new system have to have Xp Media Center OS to have an OS upgrade ticket for Vista? </s>
<s> Yes, I think maybe you should checkout the Media center PC's, it sounds like it would be a good solution to your needs... </s>
<s> If you buy a Media center Computer today, it will get you a free upgrade to Windows Vista Premium, 32 bit ver. </s>
<s> when Vista is released. </s>
<s> A PC with Windows XP, will get you an upgrade to Windows Vista Basic. </s>
<s> I have applied for my Premium upgrade already, and it appears to be going well... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
