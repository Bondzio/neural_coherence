<s> I don't have a DVD-burner [never even bought a CD-burner (stop laughing!)] </s>
<s> but I'm planning to buy one & install it in my PC. </s>
<s> Someone told me to be careful of which make/manufacturer I buy because some are being made with Digital Rights Management technology built in. </s>
<s> This doesn't make sense to me. </s>
<s> What little I know about DRM makes it sound like software looking for...well, whatever it is that signals a copyrighted file. </s>
<s> Would the 'driver' file somehow stop working? </s>
<s> I'm not planning to steal movies, but after the Sony fiasco last year I don't want to trust corporate suits more than I have to. </s>
<s> Is there some feature or warning I should look for on the box to avoid 'Big Brother' DRM features built-in to the burner? </s>
<s> But there has been plenty of talk. </s>
<s> it wont happen.. unless they ALL DO IT at the same time... the first company that does it wont be bought from by the average people... </s>
<s> Consider how *Pistaed* the consumer is when there DVD/HD-DVD/Blueray player does not work.. or when you can't take a Microsoft/apple purchased music to other non approved players... </s>

<s> Thats someone may have confused &quot;regional&quot; DVD play with DRM. </s>
<s> It basically means if you brought a DVD movie in Europe and then came to the states, you will prompted with a regional error message on a DVD player brought in the states. </s>
<s> There is supposablely at issue those DVD movies for HD used for Blu-ray or DVD-HD are touting HDCP, another name(IMHO) for DRM in HD. </s>
<s> Its still in the air, but its gets so confusing that it seems like it was meant to be that way. </s>
<s> None of this should apply to typical DVD players though, only HD. </s>
