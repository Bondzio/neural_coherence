I'm putting together an old PC I brought home from school with all the same parts except for the case.
When I hook everything in, turn on the PSU, and turn on the power, the fans run for less that one second before turning off.
I am positive the motherboard is not shorting out on the case, nor is any other component.
I've triple-checked all of the connections, but I still get the same problem.
It's possible that on the trip back, one or more of the parts may have sustained damage.
Can anyone diagnose this problem?
