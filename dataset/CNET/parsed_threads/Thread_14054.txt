<s> Has anyone successfully installed and used 2 SATA hard drives of different volumes, different manufacturers and different speeds as native hard drives with either Vista or Windows 7? </s>
<s> I have tried to do this for about 3 months with 2 different mobos, different memory and different processors without success. </s>
<s> Here is what I have discovered so far. </s>
<s> Vista. </s>
<s> Vista, depending on mobo, wont always see both SATA drives upon install. </s>
<s> If it does see both drives and installs correctly when My Computer is opened the 2nd (non-system) drive is listed as removable and cannot be accessed. </s>
<s> Solutions: Use only 1 SATA drive and partition, use 2 SATA drives on RAID (requires for best performance 2 identical drives) or use 1 IDE drive and 1 SATA drive (works for me). </s>
<s> Windows 7. </s>
<s> W7 upon install detects all drives connected and installation is problem less. </s>
<s> My Computer displays both drives as Local Discs but when the 2nd drive (non-system) is accessed the computer freezes. </s>
<s> Restart after restart does not solve this problem. </s>
<s> Solutions: As with Vista, use 1 SATA and partition, use 2 SATA drives on RAID or use 1 IDE drive and 1 SATA. </s>
<s> I would like to here if anybody has had any success with this configuration and if so how? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I coming to the conclusion that hard disk setups even in IDE days are far too hard on owners. </s>
<s> I think the design needs to be like a car with 4 wheels and you bolt them on in their specific places. </s>
<s> On many PCs you can change the BIOS to have the tire be a spare, or a dualie with the OS that is installed failing to work after the change. </s>
<s> Sorry the issues I see are a combination of design and education problems. </s>
<s> This industry that does not as practice have a standard. </s>
<s> Or rather standards that you pick and choose from. </s>
<s> Then again we see a lot of homebrew machines with issues. </s>
<s> How do you tell them that you want to change the motherboard? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> it should be no problem at all. </s>
<s> i have one pc with a wd 250gb, a wd 500gb, and a seagate 320gb -- no problem at all. </s>
<s> some original sata 1 ports (on older mobos) don't work properly with some sata 3.0gbps drives and a jumper needs to be set on the drive to 'dumb it down.' </s>
<s> This is one of the major problems with home built systems. </s>
<s> It's nice to go to a supermarket and pick up a defined spec. </s>
<s> system with an OS and other programs already installed. </s>
<s> Just like buying a pre-packed bag of selected potatoes. </s>
<s> For those of us who like to &quot;pick our own potatoes&quot;, different sizes, shapes and varieties we run the risk that the potatoes simply won't like each other. </s>
<s> Enough of the analogy. </s>
<s> The problem for people who buy &quot;off the shelf&quot; systems is that they are not as hardware literate as us &quot;techies, nerds, I prefer entusiasts&quot; and spend a lot of time calling customer support or givng up. </s>
<s> The whole idea of the PC is &quot;personal&quot;, choose the pieces of hardware you want and install them. </s>
<s> The compatability of components is getting much better than it was some years ago but with every new tech that arrives so do compatability problems. </s>
<s> I love the idea of &quot;pick 'n' mix&quot; PCs, I've been doing it for years but sometimes after messing around with components for hours, trying every possible configuration only to see no result is dissapointing. </s>
<s> I guess I could buy a MAC but a MAC is just a supermarket PC. </s>
<s> Let's hope component manufacturers think about the self-builder who sits at home with his or her PC in pieces on the floor trying to figure out what is wrong before releasing a piece of hardware with different or non-compatable standards. </s>
