<s> I want to upgrade my Hp Pavilion a620n desktops memory. </s>
<s> I currently have a PC2700 512Mb ram.Im not tryin to buy from Hp site because it cost way more than in store or other sites online like newegg. </s>
<s> Should i get 512mb maybe cause of dual channel or a 1GB PC2700 memory? </s>
<s> Is dual channel better if i got a 512mb or would it be faster if i added a 1gb with my stock Hp memory? </s>
<s> I only have 1 memory slot left and the mobo max is 2GB. </s>
<s> Heres a link to what kind of memory i would like to get for my HP. </s>

<s> I was thinking to just buy one stick of maybe a 512 or 1GB. </s>
<s> If i buy a kingston or corsair 512mb will i still have dual chanel wit my stock ram? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Believe dual-channel works only with same speed, size, and voltage. </s>
<s> Not sure about the brand, believe you also need the same manufacturer, i'd bet against differnt brands running dual0channel. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> so it wont be dual channel if i bought a Kingston or Corsair 512mb memory and put it in with the Hp Factory memory? </s>
<s> Or should i just buy dual channel system (2X512mb) because i dont want to throw away the 512 i have in my HP that came stock wit it. </s>
<s> i could be wrong, but i'm pretty sure that your system doesn't support dual channel ram. </s>
<s> dual channel ddr usually applies to 800mhz+ fsb pentium 4's and some of the newest athlon 64's(not the athlon xp). </s>
<s> typically you'd have 2 or 4 ram slots and ram would need to be installed in pairs of pc3200 chips. </s>
<s> the difference between 1gb and 2gb is very small for most people so just adding 512mb is what i'd recommend </s>
<s> i saw pc2700(512x2)dual channel system kit on newegg. </s>
<s> I think it will use dual channel because if u have the same amount of ram like 512x2 it will work. </s>
<s> but i duno if i should just get one more 512mb stick from any company. </s>
<s> will it be faster? </s>
<s> well, your cpu does support dual channel operation but the chipset on your motherboard does not, so you might as well just buy any brand of memory for that 2nd 512mb stick, having a matched pair won't make a difference on that motherboard </s>
