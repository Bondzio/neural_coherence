<s> Hey mates all: I was watching a film on the net and all of the sudden,...black screenn...Blue screen,,,and gone without allowing me to read the message in the blue screen...I couldn`t believe it ,since I have a P lV, 2.4 Ghz, 1.00gb of RAm,AMD Athlon (tm)64 processor3800+. </s>
<s> Windows XP professional.SP 3.All my hardware are compatible with XP,the computer have been working fantastically for a year,since I put it together myself. </s>
<s> All that I can think of is the PSU,,,why? </s>
<s> ?because the keyboard is on in Num Lock,but the mouse is not on,when you powewr it on it just go as far as the booting operating system screen,it wouldn`t go further...any ideas ,,pleaseeeeee? </s>
<s> In the BIOS if you can get that far. </s>
<s> If all looks good in there, make sure you are set to try to boot from CD/DVD drive first. </s>
<s> Then try a Live Linux CD or Ultimate Boot CD and start check devices for a failure. </s>
<s> It could have been memory or a heat build up or just a hardware failure. </s>
<s> If you can boot into one of the above CD's more than likely you can find the problem. </s>
<s> Thanks mate,I`ll do it and let you know... </s>
