i too am having a problem installing a new hard drive in a dell poweredge server, 500sc.
i removed the old drive and installed a new one, both ide.
however, the new drive shows in bios, however, when the windows 2000 server cd gets to the point to reformat the drive a message comes up and says no drives are available.
i did clear the bios configuration so it would see the new drive and since then , not even the old drive will boot up.
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
