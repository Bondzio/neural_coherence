<s> This may a well beaten subject, but I must get an answer. </s>
<s> I have used an Iomega External HD (black series/800/firewire) for about 6 months, using it to load up with important files. </s>
<s> Now all of a sudden, it does get recognized by either my Mac G5 (OS X 10.4) or my MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> In fact, I get the Disk Insertion (initialize/ignore/eject) window. </s>
<s> Why initialize, that will only wipe out all of my files on the HD. </s>
<s> Why ignore, that wont help. </s>
<s> Why eject, thats no use. </s>
<s> Please help, any advice? </s>
<s> Frustrated, now angry. </s>
<s> But the lesson here looks to be one about backup. </s>
<s> These drives are not &quot;storage...&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, ill try Disk Warrior. </s>
<s> Any other disk apps. </s>
<s> that would recommend? </s>
<s> I always considered the Iomega External HD as a storage device. </s>
<s> Was this a mistake? </s>
<s> I did use the backup feature, although not on a regular basis, which is probably a BIG mistake. </s>
<s> But with each storage device we also have a backup of what we don't want to lose. </s>
<s> Please post in one of our Mac forums as our Mac expert will then see your issue as well. </s>

<s> Backup of what? </s>
<s> What amount of data can a recover? </s>
<s> The Iomega HD does have Automatic Backup app., should I consider? </s>
<s> By the way, the HD has a MS-DOS file system, with a DOS_FAT_32 partition type. </s>
<s> I also have posted my problem on the Mac forum as well, thanks for the suggestion. </s>
<s> Backup is defined quite well out there. </s>
<s> It's that copy you have put somewhere for the day your hard disk or such device goes wonky. </s>
<s> Where is that backup? </s>
<s> &quot;DOS_FAT_32 partition type.&quot; That's the worst possible file system to trust for USB hard disks. </s>
<s> I always feel sad when I see those. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> Making a &quot;backup&quot; means making a copy of the data on another medium, so you can &quot;restore&quot; it if anything happens to the original. </s>
<s> Usual ways to backup data on an internal hard disk is copying it to a second inernal disk or an external hard disk, copying it to a USB-drive, burning it to CD or DVD, copying to a tape drive, copying it to a drive somewhere else in the (home or office) network. </s>
<s> Usual ways to backup data on an external hard disk are more or less the same. </s>
<s> Generally it are rather large amounts of data, so the easiest way is to use a second external disk. </s>
<s> I assume the Iomega software is meant to copy data from an internal hard disk TO the external one. </s>
<s> Not about copying data FROM it. </s>
<s> FAT32 disks are more error-prone than disks in the NTFS (for Windows) or Apple filesystem format. </s>
<s> So the first thing to do with an external disk that doesn't need to be used on both Windows and Apple is to delete the partition it comes with and make a more suitable one. </s>

<s> &quot;The Iomega HD does have Automatic Backup app&quot; backs up what you have on your PC/MAC to that storage unit. </s>
<s> Since you have two copies, one on the PC/Mac and one on the storage unit it is not a disaster when the storage unit dies. </s>
<s> You appear to have changed something so you had but one copy? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Im guessing that there is no easy solution to recovering data from my HD/external disk? </s>
<s> Are there any recovery apps. </s>
<s> (Disk Warrior) or companies that I can turn to? </s>
<s> You can DIY the recovery on some PC. </s>
<s> Here's the two titles you can try and buy if they work. </s>
<s> ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY GETDATABACK Why hasn't DISK WARRIOR be tried yet? </s>
<s> You didn't tell. </s>
