It can either be a tablet with the screen sitting on top of the keyboard, or the screen slides away from the keyboard to make it look more like a laptop. That's a horrible description, I'm sorry. I also think it was running Windows 8. Anyone have any idea what that tablet was called?

Here's the CNET link about it. http://www.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10424800-269.html It's been done before and given it's lukewarm sales and more, you probably won't see this again. The next things will likely be the Windows 8 tablet with it's keyboard unit. Although the big issue for most will be APPS. http://www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/tablets/windows-8-tablets-release-date-specs-and-prices-916134 Both could run Windows 8 but what is the draw here? I mean you won't be using Office or many current apps for a while. Bob

As the Slate rolls out you can bet you'll see more models as they hope to get you to buy one. Sorry but your description sounds like a fragile thing. Bob
