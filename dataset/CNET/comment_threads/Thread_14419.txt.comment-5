unplugging a few things first.
In a situation like this I would unplug all hard drives, CD/DVD drives, and pull out all memory.
Then try to start computer.
If it starts with everything unplugged, then turn it off and try plugging in devices one at a time, restarting after each device to determine where the problem lies.
If it won't fire after unplugging all of these items, you have at least eliminated several possible problems.
