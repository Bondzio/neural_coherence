<s> I have recently installed a second hard drive on my computer and it works perfectly except for one problem, its 400Gb but it only shows up as 127Gb, is there an easy way to fix this? </s>
<s> because i am running out of space quckly. </s>
<s> thanks Kel </s>
<s> http://www.pcwarfare.com/hdds/fdisk-format.slave.hdd.htm Unfortunately, this would mean that you would have to save whatever is on that 127GB partition to your other harddrive or a bunch of cd/dvd disks, then use FDISK to wipe out the partitioning on it and start over again and create four new partitions...three of 127GB each and the fourth with the balance left over or four kind of equal 100GB partitions and then format them all. </s>
<s> If you have XP, let us know.....different method to do this and it might be able to be done through the Disk Management program in Administrative Tools. </s>

<s> sorry i forgot to say i have xp pro installed. </s>
<s> Admin Tools/Computer Management, then Disk Management. </s>
<s> Locate the drive involved from the list of drives shown and see if you can right click it and get an option to format/create partitions with the empty space. </s>
<s> Sometimes this will work and sometimes it doesn't depending upon how you formatted the drive to begin with..... TONI </s>
<s> in that but in my computer there is a format option, also i have my old 180Gb hard drive attached and it shows up in my computer as HDD but this one with the missing space shows up as local disk, i dont know if that is anything to do with it. </s>
<s> am i going to have to have to re format it, if i am how do i format it without this happening? </s>
<s> ive had to put this drive as the primary now because for some reason the 180gb drive wont work. </s>
<s> when i got the 400gb drive i was planning on formatting it, putting all my files on it and using it as the master then reformatting the 180gb and using it as extra storage. </s>
<s> is it possible to do this without having to put all my files on dvds and starting again. </s>
<s> any of these should fix your problem. </s>
<s> get the tool for your drive's manufacturer. </s>

<s> did the bios see the whole drive? </s>
<s> If not then you have a different problem as well. </s>
<s> primary master shows as 400.1GB, primary slave shows as 200.00GB yet both show up as 127gb </s>
<s> they are both seagate drives so i tried disk wizard on the 180gb drive and it now shows up as 127gb aswell. </s>
<s> i set it as additional storage. </s>
<s> i checked in bios and the master shows as 400 gb and the slave as 200gb. </s>

XP Pro doesn't do past 127GB As noted at http://48bitlba.com XP Pro couldn't support over 127GB IDE drives until SP1. </s>
<s> Any space above 127GB simply doesn't exist until you apply SP1 or SP2. </s>
<s> After you apply the SP, then you use the Disk or Drive Management tool native to XP to create another partition with the new found space and format it. </s>
<s> So it sounds as if when you installed XP Pro you didn't have SP1 or SP2 included in the install disk so you need to head to the update center and get the SP2 update installed before you can use disk manager to do what you need to do. </s>

<s> i had completely forgotten about the sp's. </s>
<s> i installed the updates and im formatting the new partition now. </s>
