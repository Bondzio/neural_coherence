ted: i'm glad you're still here.
my first cd/dvd drive is drive d. do i have to go thru and re-letter each of those drives?
also, i have a drive f that's got all these dell files and folders on it.
i didn't set it up and i don't know what it's for.
i think it might be a partition on my current hard drive.
what happens when i format that drive?
nevermind.
if i format c, it won't format f, will it?
thanks.
i hope you won't be disappointed with me if i don't do this work until next weekend.
as you pointed out in an earlier message, i can still write and do the vital things i need to do without making a major change.
i've got some hard and fast deadlines this coming week, and if i screw this computer up, i won't be able to file my stories and fotos.
is it ok if i contact you next saturday if i mess it up?
ann
