she has a cable modem, and i have it hooked to the wireless capable linksys router, but the router is not picking anything up, thus the adapter is not either.
i don't understand how the two can create an internet connection.
on the router, everything is lighting up that should except the &quot;internet&quot; part.
well, that's obviously because she has no internet connection due to a bad network card.
the adapter installed just like the book said it should, but it's still not creating an internet connection like we were told it would.
am i overthinking this thing or what?
