I would like to buy a mobile broadband modem from Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint for internet access in my home. I currently have a desktop and wireless router that I use to network a laptop to the desktop and several printers. Is it possible to plug a USB mobile broadband card into a wireless router for a home network? I've heard Linksys has a product that does that but I have had problems making Linksys networks work- is there another source? Many thanks- Bob S.
