<s> Another answer to the problem might be the following. </s>
<s> If by chance the files were transfered to the 80 gig by a Take two back up cd made with a program such as Take Two the back up program would partition and format the drive to be exactly the size of the originating drive. </s>
<s> I've seen this happen many times. </s>
<s> An easy check is to run fdisk on the 80 gig and choose show partitions. </s>
<s> You'll see usage thats not 100%. </s>
<s> If that turns out to be the case, hook up the 80 gig as slave with the 40 gig as master and use a program like Ghost to transfer over only the contents drive to drive. </s>
<s> Make sure you run fdisk and then format the 80 first to be absolutly sure you have the whole 80 gig back. </s>
<s> Thought this might be the cause also. </s>

<s> When up grading from 1 size hdd to a larger hdd, some times can be frustrating. </s>
<s> Most hdd's come with an Instal disk and instructions, then some don't. </s>
<s> Some times the Bios will only see a hdd of a say 40 gig. </s>
<s> to get it to recognise the other 40 gig you will have to put a hdd overlay on it. </s>
<s> That (tricks) this bios into seeing the intire hdd. </s>
<s> Even then you will still lose 1-3 gigs from the new hdd as they always do. </s>
<s> Then do the FILE copy. </s>
<s> If you copy the hdd it will show up as 40 again. </s>
<s> You can go to the manufaturer's web site and go to support,then down load's, and look up your hdd to get the install 3.5 disk. </s>
<s> That will have the overlay with it. </s>
<s> GOOD LUCK </s>
