most of the folks that visit these forums are not interested in overclocking......they just want the machine to run and not give them any fuss.
if this was a car forum these folks are not interested in changing carbs/cams/exhaust to make the car faster.
they want the car to start.
when they step on the gas they want the car to go.
when they step on the brake they want the car to stop.
that's it.
the folks here might be able to help with removing some dead weight the machine is dragging around......that's a backward way of overclocking.
