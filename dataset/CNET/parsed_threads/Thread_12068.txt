<s> Could someone please help me make up my mind. </s>
<s> I am a tablet virgin looking to finally pop my cherry. </s>
<s> I am looking to not spend alot of money and Im not a techie. </s>
<s> I will be using it for online classes ( research, test taking, blogging, reading) and my son will be using it to play games and watch movies at home and on trips. </s>
<s> I know that with the Nexus comes Google Play and other apps but it doesnt have HDMI port or SD card slot and less onboard storage (8GB vs 32GB). </s>
<s> They have the same screen resolution but the ASUS is 10&quot; vs 7&quot; for the Nexus. </s>
<s> Does the Asus have an app that I can download a bunch of games for free or at least inexpensively as well as some shows and movies if I went with it instead of the Nexus? </s>
<s> I could really use some advice. </s>
<s> I found them to be subpar for such applications. </s>

<s> No, I have never even used a tablet. </s>
<s> Tablets are not laptop replacements for creating app, docs, yet. </s>
<s> You see folk are trying this by adding keyboards but many have run out and bought these without checking it all out ahead of time. </s>
<s> A few are quite burned up about it. </s>
<s> These things will get better but for now, test drive it before spending your money. </s>
