Compare that HD to the specifications for old HD.
The HD inside that enclosure should be 80GB, 2MB cache, 7200rpm.
http://support.wdc.com/productspec.asp#usb2 If the old HD runs at less than 7200rpm and/or has less than 2MB cache, then you have an improvement.
You may also have an improvement with less noise from the new HD.
