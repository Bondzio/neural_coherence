<s> My computer running Linux and my wifes running XP are connected to a dlink router to share a cable internet connection. </s>
<s> Today I noticed in the router status her machine has 3 connections to the internet, while mine has only one. </s>
<s> Can someone explain why? </s>
<s> It's possible that it used a few in the past but so far, XP would only use one IP. </s>

<s> Try this one: http://www.use.com/e5ba2a6cb1d92612a505 You'll see my computer (sid) has one address...her XP machine has 3 </s>
<s> I can't check the MAC I can't tell if this is the old lease issue. </s>
<s> Sorry I can't see enough to tell if there is any issue here. </s>
<s> I'm going with it's just an old lease. </s>

<s> I just checked again, and all 3 of her connections show the same MAC address. </s>
<s> I can do another screenshot if that would help. </s>
<s> Again I see nothing wrong here. </s>
<s> I know on my linux box I can get more than one IP. </s>
<s> It doesn't mean anything is broke. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Have you checked her PC to see if all those addresses are active at once? </s>
<s> Check her network adapter settings, and try ipconfig from a command prompt. </s>
<s> Maybe there are some virtual adapters in use. </s>
<s> I am much more familiar with Linux than XP but I will take a look tomorrow. </s>
<s> More to satisfy my curiosity than anything else Should have thought of that myself. </s>
