there are 2 modes that i think you may be talking about stand by and hibernation.
i am currently using xp on this pc and when closing down i get the option of putting in to hibernation.
but i to have a problem here, in that when i try to put it in to hibernation i get a message telling me that i can not do so because something is in use.
i believe it is because i have a cordless keyboard and mouse and although they are not being used when i am attempting to put the pc in to hibernation the mouse or keyboard is constantly sending radio waves to the receiver.
but on the whole you should receive a message when you go to close the pc down and in this message window you should have options to either but into hibernation or to put it in to stand by mode.
other than this i can't really advice.
