1.1.1	Hello , I 'm buying a new Imac and am trying to decide whether it 's best to buy a larger hard drive in the MAC or add more storage with an external drive .	St
1.1.2	I currently have an older Dell ( 8200 Dimension ) with an external 750GB Seagate Free Agent Pro drive for back up of pics , movies , etc ...	St
1.1.3	I 'm looking at moving the external HD to the MAC ... but have read some interesting recent reviews on these Seagate drives .	St
1.1.4	My new Imac is being used for photo/video editing/DVD creating .	St
1.1.5	These picture/movie files just seem to swallow up the storage space and I want to configure this right !	St
1.1.6	I have loads of family projects to do which involve a ton of scanning or digital image transfer of some sort !	St
1.1.7	Thanks for any help !	St
1.2.1	I 'd rather have more internal disk space ... .to wit I always put 2 HDDs in my PCs ... and the second HDD serves primarily as a backup to the primary drive .	St
1.2.2	Externals only used for 2nd backup Is a second HDD possible in an iMAC ?	Ques
1.2.3	VAPCMD .	St
1.3.1	and you would n't want to open up an iMac and void the warranty to try to fit two drives in .	St
1.3.2	It 's an all-in-one , so there 's limited configurations and a very limited upgradeability ( RAM only ) .	St
1.3.3	To the original poster : Which iMac do you plan on getting ?	Ques
1.3.4	If you need a lot of storage , go with one of the 24 inch models , which can support up to a 1TB drive .	St
1.3.5	That may work for you .	St
1.3.6	If you 'd rather get a 20 inch model , you could get up to a 750GB I believe on the 2.4Ghz model .	St
1.3.7	The low end 2.0Ghz model will only take up to 500GB , so I do n't recommend that one if you plan on doing a lot of projects .	St
1.3.8	Usually , my iMovie projects take up around 5GB or more while I 'm working on them .	St
1.3.9	Consider how long your films/slideshows will be and how many files you would want to incorporate into such projects before making a selection on internal storage .	St
1.3.10	That said , you should get a secondary backup for your current external drive incase it dies .	St
1.3.11	Hope this helped .	St
1.3.12	-BMF	St
1.4.1	applies to MacPRO ?	Ques
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Apple sells Pro components , in the form of RAM , hard drives , and graphics cards .	St
1.5.2	Those can be upgraded by oneself , I believe .	St
1.5.3	Best to go large with the internal on the iMac and buy a pair of externals just in case .	St
1.5.4	-BMF	St
