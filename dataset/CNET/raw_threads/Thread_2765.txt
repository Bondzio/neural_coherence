There is a product out on the market now from Hamilton Electronics called the USB duplicator express which allows you to copy and pull from 15 targets at once which is a huge time save and is a standalone device. You can read more about it and purchase it from www.AlltecStores.com at this link: http://www.alltecstores.com/store/p/35945-USB-Transfer-Express.html
