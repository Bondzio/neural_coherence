1.1.1	We have 2 computers ( 1 has an XP Pro OS while the other has a Win98 SE OS ) that are connected to the net via a CNSH-800 8-port switch that is hookup to a DSL modem-router .	St
1.1.2	Our problem is that the connection between the switch and our Win98SE PC has somehow stop working .	St
1.1.3	No , it does n't have anything to do with the LAN card or the UTP wire being busted because when we tried to hook them up directly to the DSL modem-router , we could still get a connection .	St
1.1.4	I think the same is also true for the switch because the connection between it and our XP Pro PC still remains unaffected .	St
1.1.5	So my question now is this : where do you think our problem lies ?	Ques
1.1.6	Do you know of any solution to fix it ?	Ques
1.2.1	eventhough you said you have no problem with your UTP , try other cable ... it maybe loose or burnout connector..	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply Gakada .	St
1.3.2	The switch PORTs are ok when I tested them all using the UTP cabble hook up to our XP Pro PC .	St
1.3.3	As for the UTP cable hookup to our Win98SE PC , it works just fine when I connected it directly to the DSL modem-router instead of the switch so I do n't think it has something to do with the problem .	St
1.3.4	One more thing , the switch , the UTP cable , and dsl modem-router are all new .	St
1.3.5	Not even a week old yet .	St
1.3.6	They even all work just fine until yesterday when I found out that I could no longer access the net via the switch using our Win98SE PC .	St
1.3.7	By the way , our DSL provider assigned to us one static IP address .	St
1.3.8	But since we have to 2 PCs I made use of the switch to share the internet connection so I wo n't have to setup a network with one PC depending on another to get access to the web .	St
1.3.9	Just assigned IP addresses to both with the first one having a 192.168.X.XX address while the second one having 192.168.X.XX+1 address .	St
1.3.10	Any more ideas guys ?	Ques
1.4.1	Gakada , I guess I made a hasty conclusion with regards to your suspicion that I maybe having a loose connector .	St
1.4.2	Kinda just found out that when I checked my RJ45 .	St
