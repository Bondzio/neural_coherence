<s> Hi~ First time posting here Here's a problem I have. </s>
<s> Reinstalled XP and it doesn't detect the onboard (VGA compatible) video. </s>
<s> I know have 640X480 and Color quality is 4bit. </s>
<s> Woohooo!! </s>
<s> In device manager as &quot;other device&quot; with yellow question mark. </s>
<s> It's a *Legend Computer* &gt; nothing on their website! </s>
<s> Winbond Motherboard &gt; no luck here either. </s>
<s> At this point i'd be happy with any driver that would work. </s>
<s> M VGA Compatible driver. </s>
<s> Shouldn't be this hard to find?? </s>
<s> Anyone know of a driver that is most likely to work? </s>
<s> A &quot;M VGA Compatible driver&quot;!! </s>
<s> Thanks G </s>
<s> There were several video drivers listed under &quot;winbond&quot;. </s>
<s> You didn't give your model number or any other identifiers so hard to say if yours is there... Also I did find downloads on the Winbond site (once I switched it to english.) </s>
<s> but it was not clear to me of these were what you were looking for... Hope this helps -- good hunting. </s>
<s> sounds like you need the via hyperon 4n1 driver for the mother board then the video driver, http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=2&Type=1 </s>
