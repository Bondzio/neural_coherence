<s> I have problem with my Dell Inspiron 9200 Laptop.I couldn't start it and when I tried harder, pressing the power key a bit longer it started,but after few seconds I saw a smock comming from behind.I tried to start it with and without battery - no result.When I took it for repair they said me the problem most probably was in the moherboard (it is gone and it is no use to do something, too costly). </s>
<s> So I have to buy a new laptop.Unfortunately a disk was left inside and I don't know how to take it out when the laptop is not switched on.Please give me an advise how to do this.Thank you in advance. </s>

<s> a DVD or CD, then use a paper clip and push it into the little hole just near the button you normally use to open and close the CD drive. </s>
<s> That releases the lock and you can pull it open and retrieve the disk. </s>
<s> If however you mean the hard drive disk, then the previous instructions are dead on. </s>
<s> It works.Thank you! </s>
