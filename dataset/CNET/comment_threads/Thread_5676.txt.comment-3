Actually, I've got (almost) the same problem (it's an external USB Audigy 2 NX), and none of the things you described apply.
I know it's not a dead card, because we are getting sound from it.
And, like the guy before me, the card shows up in Device Manager as properly installed.
Anybody got a clue?
