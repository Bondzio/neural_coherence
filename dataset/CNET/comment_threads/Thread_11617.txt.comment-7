I am looking for a PCI or PCI-Express (PCI-E) FireWire/1394 card that has internal pins so that the case can plug in to it if the motherboard does NOT have firewire pins on it.
I am definently not looking for a 1394 card with a simple connector (which you would plug a normal 1394 cable into).
I need a card with the pins... Ray mentioned these, but I cannot find them.
Please help, thanks a million!!
