<s> My dual-usb ibook is not recognizing the hard drive. </s>
<s> The problem started after having to manually shut down and restart from the power button several times in a row due to the bad logic board causing the screen to freeze. </s>
<s> Now when I turn the computer on I get the first gray screen, the little folder icon comes up with the question mark then switches between the ? </s>
<s> and the finder icon and goes no further. </s>
<s> I booted from the tiger DVD and tried disk utility, but it does not even &quot;see&quot; the hard drive, nor does system profiler or startup disk. </s>
<s> I have had to crack open my laptop several times to replace or adjust the shim I installed just below the gpu on the magnetic shield (a temporary solution to my logic board issues). </s>
<s> I'm going to get a new computer soon but I need the data off this HDD. </s>
<s> Is there any way it can be retrieved? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Pull the drive out of the failed machine and into a firewire enclosure to run the usual disk warrior tools. </s>
<s> I'm also eyeing another tool that is PC based called Spinrite. </s>
<s> It can help in the odd situation now but some owners balk at the cost of case and tools. </s>
<s> You? </s>
<s> In closing where is the backup? </s>
<s> It seems strange to know about a machine's issues yet trust it with files you apparently can't lose. </s>

<s> OK, I'll try it your way, but don't scold me for not backing up data. </s>
<s> It's a recurring theme in the forums. </s>
<s> We want you to succeed so ignore that if you wish and tell us how you fare. </s>

<s> This is an indication that the machine cannot find a valid OS to boot from. </s>
<s> You have discovered that the machine does not see the HD at all. </s>
<s> Conclusion, the HD is dead. </s>
<s> These can be replaced with a larger capacity one, quite easily but it is not really a job for those with no experience at it. </s>
<s> I note that you have &quot;Cracked the case&quot; a number of times, so you could do this yourself. </s>
<s> Once the new drive is installed, reinstall the OS from the installation CD's that came with the machine and then restore all you missing files from your Backup set. </s>
<s> You do have a backup, don't you? </s>
<s> Follow Bob's suggestion too. </s>
<s> How long has your machine had a logic board problem? </s>

<s> It will be expensive. </s>
<s> Would a USB 2.0 enclosure suffice, or is a firewire case a better choice? </s>
<s> I've heard USB cannot sustain speeds or something. </s>
<s> for a Mac. </s>
<s> On paper, USB2.0 shows faster speeds than firewire but this only bursts of speed while firewire is able to maintain a constant speed. </s>
