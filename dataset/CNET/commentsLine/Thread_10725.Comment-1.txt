good day, from what i have discovered so far this is an ongoing/reoccurring issue for a lot of people however, i have only just run into it.
i have an older desktop running xp sp3, wired to a motorola modem/router/wireless combination.
the win7 machine is a toshiba satellite latptop connecting with a realtek rtl8188ce wireless card, as well i have only just connected a 2tb wd live book for storage/backups.
all machines access the internet with no issues, it is when trying to network that my issue begins.
i can see/access the win7 machine and the wd live book from the xp machine.
i am not able to access anything from the win7 machine, all settings have been confirmed/reconfirmed, all machines are on the same workgroup, both have file/print sharing enabled, and as near as i can tell both have the required services running in order to see/network with each other.
accessing the router configuration, everything looks as it should to me, i see no glaring settings that need to be changed/turned on or off.
i have tried quite few different suggestions found through google on sites similiar to cnet, as well as some microsoft tutorials (guaranteed to work).
the only step forward was when i was able to see/access the win7 machine through the xp machine.
i updated what firmware that required updating with no results, i tried running microsoft updates on both machines to see if there was some optional updates that might help, as well i went to the nic cards and checked to see if there was updated drivers for these.
to date not one single thing i have tried has had any effect on the win7 machine, it has only been since i wanted to share some files/folders/data without running back and forth copying them that this issues came about.
other than this one issues it works great, i have had no problem with either it or windows7.
hope you/someone can offer some solutions.
thanks
