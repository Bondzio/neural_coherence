1.1.1	I recently had to purchase a new router to accomodate a fifth computer added to our LAN ( our router only had 4 ports ) .	St
1.1.2	I know most routers will control other routers attached to it automatically , so I added another 4 port router ( actually , all I could find was a 4 port switch , is this the same thing ? ) .	Sug
1.1.3	Is there any additional security gained from being behind two routers , and thus behind two hardware firewalls ?	Ques
1.2.1	unless you disable DHCP on the router not connected to your modem , you 'll likely lose your internet capabilities .	St
1.3.1	A router and a switch are different in many ways , but the key difference is in the way each device manages the packets of information exchanged between computers ( we will use the term & quot ; hosts & quot ; ) .	St
1.3.2	A router actually analyzes the & quot ; routing information & quot ; ( layer 3 of the OSI model ) .	St
1.3.3	Many companies have boosted that degree of intelligence to include other services & quot ; built-in & quot ; to the magic box , such as NAT ( network address translation ) , DHCP ( dynamic network addressing ) , and plenty of security-related features , packaged and presented to the owner ( administrator ) with a built-in web-based interface .	St
1.3.4	( NOTE : if your router includes wireless , be sure to read the articles on cnet.com regarding securing your wireless router ) .	St
1.3.5	A switch does not include the intelligence of the router , but if you already have a router , then a switch is perfect for adding ports .	St
1.3.6	A switch is a & quot ; layer 2 & quot ; ( in the context of the OSI model ) device , and while it does not contain the intelligence of the router , it does provide high throughput for the devices that are connected to it ; kudos to you , you got the right box !	St
1.3.7	At home , I have a switch , connected to a Belkin Pre-N wireless router , connected to a LinkSys/Vonage VOIP router , connected to my cable company 's modem .	St
1.3.8	I also have a Lightyear VOIP router connected to the Vonage router , and it all works just fine together : network printing via Konica-Minolta Magicolor color laserjet ethernet printer , two IP phones , 4 laptops , 2 Windows desktops , 1 Linux desktop , and an audio/video recording studio system .

1.3.9	Hope I 've helped some ... -Woody Fairley	St
1.4.1	Well , I did n't directly answer your question in my earlier post ~ a switch does not have the intelligence and safeguards built into it to enhance security .	St
1.4.2	If you had purchased another router ( same brand and model ) , generally speaking , it would not enhance security either .	St
1.4.3	A different brand/model of router might enhance security ( generally speaking ) because it might use a different set of algorithms for the security functions , and hacker attacks would have to crack the first router security firewall , then discover and crack the second security firewall .	St
1.4.4	Honestly , with only one router you are pretty safe , but I recommend viewing the articles on cnet.com regarding securing your home network , ok ?	Ques
1.4.5	-Woody Fairley	St
1.5.1	Adding a switch is the best way to add more ports and less headaches .	St
1.5.2	But for more security you can get more firewalls to the PCs and have a router from each of the big makers lined up one behind the other .	St
1.6.1	cool , thanks for the tips , that cleared my confusion right up .	Polite
1.6.2	Pretty sweet set-up you have there , by the way .	St
1.7.1	never thought of it that way ... you could even have multiple routers from the same maker , only different model numbers that do not share the same software/driver/firmware version running in them .	St
1.7.2	Imagine the security of 86 firewalls ... hehe ... hmmm	St
1.8.1	is that a single network or is it a different network ?	Ques
1.8.2	I just curious how do you manage the network , IP , NAT , DHCP , etc . ?	Ques
1.8.3	I quote : === At home , I have a switch , connected to a Belkin Pre-N wireless router , connected to a LinkSys/Vonage VOIP router , connected to my cable company 's modem .	St
1.8.4	I also have a Lightyear VOIP router connected to the Vonage router , and it all works just fine together : network printing via Konica-Minolta Magicolor color laserjet ethernet printer , two IP phones , 4 laptops , 2 Windows desktops , 1 Linux desktop , and an audio/video recording studio system .

1.8.5	===	St
1.9.1	I apologize for not replying sooner ( I 'll check the forum more often ) .	St
1.9.2	My home network is a single network , however I have configured the routers to provide back-to-back firewalls , and the VOIP phones enter the system at different levels ( between firewalls ) .	St
1.9.3	NAT and DHCP are active at every level , but the hosts receive DHCP assignments from the inner-most level DHCP server-router .	St
1.9.4	It 's easier to visualize if I could draw it on a napkin , preferrably served with a drink .	St
1.9.5	It 's important to change the default settings at every level for security purposes .	St
1.9.6	Admin passwords , DHCP ranges , default gateway addresses , SSID 's , every setting that you can change should be changed , but remember to write it all down and keep it filed for when you forget .	St
1.9.7	-Woody PS - I 've added two Apple systems to the mix since my last posting .	St
