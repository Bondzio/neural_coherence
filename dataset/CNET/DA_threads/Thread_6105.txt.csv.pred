1.1.1	Hi, I've decided to upgrade my existing PC.	St
1.1.2	I'm having a hard time deciding which route to go this time for the first time.	St
1.1.3	I was at first going to upgrade my system to one using a 925X motherboard w/PCI-e, but it seems most of the reviews I've read, the Socket 775 processors do not perform as expected and tend to run hot to boot!	St
1.1.4	I was then thinking about waiting for the nForce4 motherboards that run on the AMD 64 platform w/ PCI-e support.	St
1.1.5	Is either of these platforms an option?	St
1.1.6	Or is there something better?	St
1.1.7	I currently have a system with a Asus P4PE 845 motherboard, a P4 2.53 processor with 512 meg of DDR PC2700 memory.	St
1.1.8	One of the reasons I want to upgrade is so I can run a better AGP card than what I have now (mine can run only a 4x slot card.	St
1.1.9	Thanks for any advise any of you can offer.	Polite
1.2.1	and mobo's with the nForce 4 are available.	St
1.2.2	go to: http://www.tomshardware.com or http://www.anandtech.com and read the details about them.	Sug
1.2.3	Gigabyte may be the latest to come out.	St
1.2.4	If gaming is your thing, AMD still wins hands down.	St
1.3.1	yeah i have a 3.4 p4 on a intel 925xcv motherboard and it idles at around 32 and games at hottest 40 i hope i helped u	St
