btw i just saw the other post on being able to transfer from and to a new and old drive.
so, dont answer that.
but, it did bring up another thought, for the past month or so, every time i even remotely bump my external, the &quot;ding&quot; noise happens and the notification pops up that the drive has been re-attached or whatever it says.
i wonder if all these problems are simply being caused by the wire?!?
that would be crazy!
can i buy just the wire?
