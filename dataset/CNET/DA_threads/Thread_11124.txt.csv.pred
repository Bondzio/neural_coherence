1.1.1	Ok this is very very urgent.	St
1.1.2	i am helping my friend get a Custom configured PC.	St
1.1.3	He wants to know which to choose either a Pentium D 3.4 Ghz or a Core 2 Duo E6300 the lowest one I think 1.8 Ghz.	St
1.1.4	If someone can have benchmarks or something please tell me which is better in performance.	Ques
1.1.5	The pD has a 800Mhz FSB and the Core 2 Duo has a 1066 or something Mhz FSB.	St
1.1.6	Another thing he is asking me that if he had to make a decision, between getting an Nvidia 6200 with a Core 2 Duo OR an Nvidia 7600 with Pentium D, which would be better assuming prices are similar.	St
1.1.7	I told him that if he didnt need gaming graphics, he should go with the Core 2 Duo combo but I would go for the better graphic card.	St
1.1.8	Please i need an answer very fast.	St
1.1.9	I will checkback in a few hours (2-4).	St
1.1.10	Thank You	St
1.2.1	faster than p4 3.4ghz in most benchmarks.	St
1.2.2	the pentium d 945 is a bit cheaper though.	St
1.2.3	the geforce 7600gt is a much better card.	St
1.2.4	if any gaming is to be done, i'd pick the p4-d + 7600gt over the c2d + 6200.	St
1.3.1	Thnx anymore replies	St
1.4.1	CPU CHARTS at www.tomshardware.com	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	just what i was looking for for not just this but many things	St
1.7.1	Core2Duo should be the cornerstone of any system goin forward.	St
1.7.2	The NVIDIA 6200 is a pretty weiner card though - I would go with a mid-range 7600 instead or even an older ATI 1800 depending on price.	St
1.7.3	Many of the tradeoffs you are asking about really require more detail on what your friend is prioritizing going forward.	St
1.7.4	With NVIDIA getting to release the new 8800 cards expect some price compression in coming weeks on the other cards.	St
1.7.5	Frankly the best time to make thes decisions will come during the frenzy the day after Thanksgiving.	St
1.8.1	I dont think he will want a super hgh end pc so I configured this for him.	St
1.8.2	He needs a family PC with some games on it.	St
1.8.3	Basic computer.	St
