<s> Hey everyone, a question about video outputs: I want to use my HDTV as a 3rd monitor. </s>
<s> It would be great if it could be a &quot;true&quot; 3rd monitor, but having the ability to switch my monitor #2 between my 2nd Viewsonic and the TV would also be acceptable. </s>
<s> My graphics card (EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Ti FPB 1024 MB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 2DVI/Mini-HDMI SLI Ready Limited Lifetime Warranty Graphics Card, 01G-P3-1561-AR) has 2 DVI outputs, which currently go to the 2 monitors that I use. </s>
<s> The motherboard (Gigabyte Intel Z77 LGA 1155 Dual Lan 4Way/3Way/2Way CrossFireX/NVIDIA SLI Dual UEFI BIOS E-ATX Motherboard G1.SNIPER 3) has an HDMI and a DVI output that are not being used thanks to the graphics card. </s>
<s> Is it possible to use the outputs from the MoBo to run the TV as a 3rd input? </s>
<s> If so, how do I set this up? </s>
<s> If not, what are some other options (other than getting a new graphics card...). </s>
<s> I looked into KVM switches as a possibly/cheap solution, but it looks mostly like those only go from 2 input sources to 1 output source (which is the opposite of what I need...). </s>
<s> Help is much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> PS - I'm running Windows 7. </s>
<s> And look to see if they let you leave the onboard video enabled when you plug in the video card. </s>
