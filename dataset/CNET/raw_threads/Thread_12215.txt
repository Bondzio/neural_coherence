I have Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit). I have disconnected the reader and reconnected but the problem persists. I have uninstalled the USB controllers in Device Manager, also without joy. The main area of concern is whether it's software or hardware.

In the beginning each slot would show as a drive in Explorer (circa 2000?) and consumers were sorely confused so a change in driver and helper apps caused the drive to hide when there was no card in the slot. HOWEVER this can cause issues if you are attempting to do data recovery since some recovery apps get blocked by the helper app. My advice is to ignore it. Bob
