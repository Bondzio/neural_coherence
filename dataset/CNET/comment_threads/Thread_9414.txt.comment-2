I'm having the same issue as the original poster.
I'm using a Dell Vostro 1500 laptop running XP Pro with a NVIDiA GeForce 8600M GT graphics card.
Trying to use the Acer V223w monitor for a dual display setup.
Any ideas on what I can try?
I've tweaked every setting I can find, using the monitor's button controls, Windows settings, and the included software, and nothing fixes the issue.
Any help would be *greatly* appreciated!
