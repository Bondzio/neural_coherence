Its a 300gb matxor drive in a generic external usb/firewire case (its been plug in through firewire). I've had it hooked up to my gateway laptop for about 4 months, and now I cannot access it. The laptop still recognizes that the hard drive is plugged in, but I cannot get at any of the files. It tells me F:\ is not accessible The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable I ran spinrite on it at level 2 and it detected nothing wrong with the drive. I also tried maxtor's Powermax utility, but it wouldn't even recognize the drive. Help please, its got 170gb of my stuff on there I'd like to keep.
