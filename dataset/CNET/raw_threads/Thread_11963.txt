Like a lot of people, my ''desktop'' really sets on the floor next to my desk. And like a lot of people, I use USB devices, flash memories and aux keypads, and others, that plug into USB ports on the front of my case. The problem; the USB ports are placed on the lowest point on the front of the case, and the cords on the aux components are short. They just barely reach the top of my desk, or can't be moved far enough onto the desk to be readily used. Are there any case manuf. that put the ports closer to the top, or on top of the case insted of the bottom front? The USB ports on the back are already full of things I don't change out, like wireless keyboard and printer conections.
