It's unlikely a photo will be ruined by opening it in a viewer.
Reasonably speaking, it isn't updated so stays unchanged.
To ensure that, set it to read-only from Windows Explorer, My Computer or command prompt.
That way it's safe to experiment with these weird problems, both on your external drive and on internal drives.
