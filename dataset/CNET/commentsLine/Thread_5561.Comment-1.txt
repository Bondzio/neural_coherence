i'm currently running an extremely old piece of junk computer and im looking to build a new one.
i play a lot of online games so i am looking for a powerful build in a budget.
my budget is around $1,300 - $1,500.
i already have speakers but need a monitor.
i have decided on the graphics card (geforce 8800gt for a little under $200) and processor (q6600 for about $250).
i am basically clueless as to the rest of the components like motherboard, ram (although i want 4 gb), case, etc.
