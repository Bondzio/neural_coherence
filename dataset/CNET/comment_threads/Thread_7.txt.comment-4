My Linksys WRT350-N died within warranty.
Since withdrawl is not in my things to tolerate I bought a D-link DIR-655 while waiting for the Linksys to be replaced.
Now I have two Gigabit/wireless N routers.
Was wondering how to do that.
Since I seem to collect PCs (I have five now) I may need extra ports.
Thanks Bob.
