<s> Dell Inspiron Desktop Computer Windows XP Belkin Wireless Adapter Belkin Wireless Mouse My computer has started freezing every few minutes. </s>
<s> (By freezing, I mean the screen freezes, the mouse will not move on the screen, and the keyboard does not work (ctrl-alt-del does nothing). </s>
<s> This happens no matter how I boot the computer (safe mode or normal mode). </s>
<s> Sometimes it even freezes before the Windows XP login screen appears. </s>
<s> Usually, it does not run for more than about 10 minutes before freezing. </s>
<s> The Hardware Profile looks normal (nothing has x-ed out on its own). </s>
<s> Sometimes, after it freezes, the computer restarts itself, just to have the same problem again. </s>
<s> Do you know how I should proceed to troubleshoot this problem? </s>
<s> Might this be an issue with the power supply? </s>
<s> Thanks for any thoughts... </s>
