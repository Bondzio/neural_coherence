<s> I have a hard drive enclosure connected via USB. </s>
<s> It was working fine all along. </s>
<s> I had to disconnect it to move my computer and when I hooked it back up, the drive letter doesn't appear. </s>
<s> When I go into my device manager it shows up and when I click &quot;properties&quot; it says, &quot;This device is working properly.&quot; Any advice? </s>
<s> Its a Western Digital WD300BB. </s>
<s> I am running XP Pro. </s>
<s> If you remember then that's it. </s>
<s> Fixes include software like GETDATABACK and Zero Assumption Recovery. </s>
<s> I take it you put it back in the same USB socket, another socket and have powered down the entire as part of your troubleshooting. </s>

<s> I had tried a couple of different USB ports with no result. </s>
<s> But I had neglected to try a different USB wire. </s>
<s> I did and the disk booted up and all the data is there. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> What I do with said cable. </s>
<s> It's promptly repurposed here but most should cut it in two and toss it. </s>
<s> Such cables can cause data corruption later even if it appears to work. </s>
<s> May I add that was good troubleshooting on your part. </s>

<s> ...Its back to square one. </s>
<s> The thunderstorms in the NE knocked out my power and when I booted back up, its doing the same thing. </s>
<s> Never stick with FAT32 at the end of an USB cable... Bob </s>
