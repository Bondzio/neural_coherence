<s> I've got a Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz Intel processor with Windows XP. </s>
<s> I bought a local non-branded 300 Watt casing for my system here, which is working perfectly fine except for one thing. </s>
<s> Recently my computer has started making annoying noises, i checked Cnet's Help guide to cleaning the pc, and I cleaned my pc, cleaned all the fans and everything. </s>
<s> This casing has two fans, one in the power supply, and another at the top of the casing, a small fan which seems like an extra to me in this casing, guess they were just trying to make the casing more attractive by putting in the extra fan. </s>
<s> Now i checked and the upper fan is making ALL the noise, when i stop this fan, all noise ceases, and even after cleaning this fan is making a lot of noise, although the noise has decreased than before but it is still highly annoying. </s>
<s> I wanted to know if I can just disable this fan and put it away, as I don't think it's of much use in the pc, the casing already has a power supply fan, processor fan, and a video card fan, this seems like an extra. </s>
<s> Please tell me if i can just remove this fan from my pc, or any other tips, also, if I can remove it, is there any safe way of doing it? </s>
<s> There are two red and black wires going from my power supply to the center of the fan. </s>
<s> Help me, my ears are killing me! </s>
<s> When you cleaned it, did you carefully pull the lable back to expose the shaft and place a small drop of oil on it. </s>
<s> WD-40, 3-in-1, or Marvel Mystery oil all works. </s>
<s> This will help the noise, My question to you is: Do you have another fan for the case and does the power supply fan exhaust out the back. </s>
<s> Heat raises and if the only fan you have is the PS then all the heat will be going into your PS and slowly over time heat it up. </s>
<s> yup, my power supply fan exhausts at the back. </s>
<s> I didn't try the oil thing, do I have to lift the silver plastic sticker in the middle of the fan and apply oil under there? </s>
<s> I don't think that is also going to help much because this fan really sucks. </s>
<s> Anyway, ill try it, thanks. </s>
<s> Or you could replace it with a higher quality fan, your choice. </s>
<s> Most fans start making noise as time goes by, some faster than others. </s>
<s> I clean my system every month and oil the fans at the same time. </s>
<s> Love that quiet sound. </s>
<s> Welcome </s>
<s> the top exhaust fan, simply replace it with a dual ball bearing type. </s>
<s> That top exhaust is of huge benefits regarding cooling. </s>
<s> Remember that heat rises. </s>
<s> I only use cases that have top exhaust fans, or add one for one case that I like, whose top comes off separately making it easy to cut the fan opening in the top,. </s>
<s> A drop of oil will help in the short run. </s>
<s> In the meantime, do that and then get your hands on a replacement fan. </s>
<s> The cost of the fan is pretty cheap and the reason for the fan in the first place is to help cool the system case. </s>
<s> The overall cooling allows your system to remain stable. </s>
<s> If you have a quiet system, then the fan is be noticable as a noise source, so buy a decent replacement to offers &quot;low db&quot; noise levels. </s>
<s> This maybe hit or miss as real cheap fans can work great but tend to fail quickly. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help guys. </s>
<s> I checked the fan again, and it turns out that the fan itself is not making the noises. </s>
<s> You see, the fan is screwed to the top grill of the casing, when the fan rotates, the &quot;grill&quot; makes the noise, not the fan. </s>
<s> The fan is screwed to the grill, now i've tried tightening the screws but it didn't help. </s>
<s> I don't think theres any simple way to solve this problem. </s>
<s> what can I do, the grill is fixed, doesn't have any other screws, and it makes noise when the fan is on......any ideas?? </s>
<s> Thanks once again. </s>
