<s> I have an HP pavillion desktop with duo core. </s>
<s> Now that it is just beyond its one year warranty period, it has the modem has started to make a strange noise. </s>
<s> It sounds sort of like a machine gun, and lasts about 5 to 10 seconds at a time. </s>
<s> I have not noticed that there is any action that I take on the computer that trigers this. </s>
<s> It seems to happen at random times, and it may happen once or twice within 2 hours of computer use. </s>
<s> I have not noticed any change in the good performance of my computer. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Should I do something about this? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Maybe I am using the wrong term. </s>
<s> By &quot;modem&quot; I am refering to the computer. </s>
<s> Without much to work with and a false lead on the modem I'm going to take a WILD GUESS. </s>
<s> Here it is. </s>
<s> -&gt; Something has moved inside to occasionally brush with a fan. </s>
<s> To fix I open it up and inspect the areas around any fan. </s>
<s> I might move/push cables to be a little farther back from a fan. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thank you for your suggestion. </s>
