How would I go about doing that?
I don't think I've ever had to reformate something before... And I would LOVE to upgrade to XP, but I think my computer is too old to handle it.
It's sort of a hand-me-down computer and the only reason I got it is because my dad got a new computer that could run a newer version of windows.
I think I'm stuck.
Thanks so much for all the help, by the way.
