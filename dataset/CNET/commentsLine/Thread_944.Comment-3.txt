the jumpers i were referring to were the ones on the hard drive itself.
but whatever setting i think they are ignored.
i can set the jumpers on my maxtor drive to master, slave or cable select and it is always recognised.
i have tried the ibm drive on more than one computer within the usb case and it never gets recognised.
i can now only guess.
i wonder if its a capacity problem, incompatibility or some other obscure reason?
