This then means i have to reset the PC as as Ctr Alt Del does nothing. There is still power though. Any ideas? Ta

I don't have much of a story but even with no story I'll take a stab at this and what stood out is a card that has failed in droves. It seems to match up with the symptom as well so why not swap in any other card for a test? Bob
