<s> Any Ideas? </s>
<s> If you can remember the password, then write it on a small slip of paper and tape it to your router. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work for you, you can press the reset button, setting it back to the factory settings and leave it there. </s>
<s> If neither of these 2 suggestions work then you shouldn't have the router in the first place. </s>
<s> Nor a computer. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
