1.1.1	I have Windows XP on my pc .	St
1.1.2	My question is : Can I redo a hard drive , it has already been formatted and partitioned once , but at the time I wasn ; t sure of how to turn a 40gig drive into 2 20gigs .	St
1.1.3	I ended up with four partitions on a 40gig .	St
1.1.4	three of those four are WAY too small , so I wanted to know if there is any way to go back and strart from the beginning again , without causing a HUGE headache .	St
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.1.6	( I would like to make it only two partitions instead of four . )	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	usaully hitting a function key or the delete key ( it says how to when ya first boot ) and change the primary boot to the cdrom drive , then put in your backup copy of windows xp that came with your computer .	St
1.3.2	It 'll boot off of the cd .	St
1.3.3	From there you can delete all your partitions and start over again .	St
1.3.4	When it asks to format do a low-level format ( the one thats not quick ) .	St
1.3.5	One thing to note though is that you should make sure you have all your drivers .	St
1.3.6	At least your internet drivers , so you can download the fresh ones from the internet if you have to .	St
1.3.7	Also , make sure you have your firewall running before you load your internet drivers .	St
1.4.1	i would not suggest u to make it within windows .	Sug
1.4.2	Because if u merge partitions ( that is delete ) u will lose data ur partition contained , besides it 's quite difficult to complete .	St
1.4.3	The easiest way is to download partition software and merge those two unwanted partitions .	St
1.4.4	Using software u wo n't lose any data .	St
1.4.5	As for software : i 'd recommend Disk Director developed by acronis company .	St
1.4.6	It 's much cheaper than partition magic and has some extra features , such as recovery expert .	St
1.4.7	This Utility recovers ur accidently delete data ( partitions ) .	St
1.4.8	the main con here that it 's not free to use software .	St
1.4.9	Disk Director ~ 45 $ .	St
1.4.10	http : //www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/diskdirector/ whatever , u 'd like to use way 1 : backup ur needed data and it 's better backup on other removable disks ( CD/DVD/USB drive ) .	St
1.4.11	but , in this case u 'll need backup software .	St
1.4.12	i 'd recommend to use partitioing software .	Sug
1.5.1	Thanks for all the info .	St
1.5.2	on re-partitioning hard drive .	St
1.5.3	You ALL have a GREAT DAY ! ! ! ! !	St
1.5.4	Thanks Again ! ! !	St
1.5.5	!	St
