<s> Hi there I'm hoping someone can help me with a very annoying problem I recently found. </s>
<s> There I am enjoying myself playing a game and then the monitor suddenly goes back to the desktop. </s>
<s> It happens with all the games I've been playing and it happens every 10 mins or so. </s>
<s> Ran a virus scanner but it's still happening. </s>
<s> The monitor is a Videoseven 17&quot; tft panel and the graphics card is a 9600 pro. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> that requires your input or you're hitting alt-tab during gameplay by mistake. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> The games were mouse driven so cant be alt-tab during gameplay and to tell you the truth I wouldn't know how to check if another prohram requires input. </s>
