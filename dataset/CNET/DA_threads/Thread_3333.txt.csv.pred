1.1.1	Is it necessary to &quot;safely remove&quot; and disconnect a USB 2 External Hard Disk from a Desktop PC before shutting down the PC ?	Ques
1.1.2	Can it be left connected to the PC ?	Ques
1.1.3	If not, is it better / safer to connect it to the Desk Top PC before pressing the Start-Up Button, or to plug it in after completion of Start-Up.	St
1.1.4	Would appreciate getting advice on this issue.	Polite
1.1.5	Thanks in anticipation.	St
1.2.1	But if it is connected before booting up computer then you CAN NOT be able to do &quot;hot swapping&quot; with the drive (safely remove will not be possible)...at least that has been my experience.	St
1.2.2	So don't disconnect while computer is still on.	St
