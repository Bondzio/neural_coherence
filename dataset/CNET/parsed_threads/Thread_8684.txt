<s> What r the things to look for when matching speakers and amps?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Most PC speakers have a dedicated preamp input to control volume and EQ on the subwoofer and they're almost always unique for different manufacturers. </s>
<s> Most of the time these preamps are hard wired, or at least integrated into the enclosures of the speaker system, and can't be removed. </s>
<s> Assuming that you have a system in mind that has a dedicated preamp (I know Logitech and Bose have some models with dedicated preamps) you'll have to make sure that your speakers connect to your amp. </s>
<s> Also, many newer systems use digital inputs on the preamp and may not be compatible with certain amplifiers. </s>
<s> Most speakers use standard speaker wire and a 3.5mm mini jack to connect with the amp, but not all. </s>
<s> If you're really serious about using different components instead of a mass produced system, I'd suggest a self powered subwoofer (or invest in a component sub and plate amp), home theater style receiver, and speakers of your choice. </s>
<s> Even car speakers/subwoofers will work assuming you want to build enclosures for them. </s>
