The heading on the Peripherals Forum declares that 'CNET's Forum on peripherals is the best source for finding help, troubleshooting, and getting buying advice from a community of experts.
Discussion topics include laser printers, inkjet printers, external hard drives, Webcams, monitors, keyboards, and mouse questions'.
I posted this question over a month ago and have had zero responses.
Is there something wrong with the way I phrased the question?
