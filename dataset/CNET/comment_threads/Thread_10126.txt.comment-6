Hi Bob, 2 and 3 are likely not applicable: the problem happened just after unpacking the machine, without having time to get spyware from internet.
For what concerns bios/drivers, the support of both Dell and D-Link checked this up, I have all latest releases (new machine, new card).
So I go for 1) searching in the event - but no sure what I am suppose to look for.
Kind regards Hedi
