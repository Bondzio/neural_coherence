1.1.1	The time has come to buy a new cordless phone, I'm interested in a 2 handset model, a base with one handset and another handset with it's own cradle which I can install in another part of the house.	St
1.1.2	I'd like to install the new base unit in a bedroom where my desktop PC is located.	St
1.1.3	There's also a Linksys WRT54G router in that same bedroom.	St
1.1.4	I've been reading some user reviews on some of the newer cordless phones, the biggest complaints have been interference with wireless routers.	St
1.1.5	My old phone which I'm replacing is a Panasonic 5.4 model.	St
1.1.6	Do the new 6.0 cordless phone models work good if they are set up in a room that also has a WRT54G wireless router?	St
1.2.1	I've had a Uniden cordless phone sitting within two feet of my D-link modem for at least three years.	St
1.2.2	Never a blip on either the phone(s) or the modem.	St
1.2.3	I have changed channels, though.	St
1.2.4	Since I researched the specific frequencies before hand, I'll let you do the same.	St
1.3.1	Oh so rather than come here seeking good advice you're telling me to go do the research myself.	St
1.3.2	Gee, thanks.	St
1.3.3	Correct me if I'm wrong here, my Linksys WRT54G wireless router operates at 2.4Ghz, my current Panasonic cordless phone which I want to replace operates at 5.8Ghz, 5.8Ghz phones are still being sold and there's the new cordless phone technology, DECT 6.0.	St
1.3.4	Well before I set out to do my research what's your opinion on this?	St
1.3.5	Which cordless phones are better?	St
1.3.6	Panasonic phones or V-Tech?	St
1.3.7	Can you answer that?	St
1.4.1	I have the Dlink wireless router; they seem to work ok for me.	St
1.4.2	I have no idea what their frequencies are.	St
1.5.1	Some of the older phones operated in the 2.x bandwidth.	St
1.5.2	They had a tendency to interfere with routers (B & G).	St
1.5.3	As far as the newer phones and higher frequencies, the higher frequency the better the transmission.	St
1.5.4	Usually.	St
1.5.5	Brands?	St
1.5.6	I only have experience with Uniden, which I'm pleased with.	St
1.5.7	If you decide to upgrade the router to N, they operate at the higher frequencies in and around the 5.x bandwidth.	St
1.6.1	So what would happen if I bought a Panasonic multi-handset DECT 6.0 unit and decided to upgrade my router later to a &quot;N&quot; router?	St
1.6.2	Could I still use a DECT 6.0 phone near an &quot;N&quot; router or not?	St
1.7.1	While it should be fine there will always be someone that has a system that will be upset with what they added.	St
1.7.2	No one can claim there will be no problem.	St
1.7.3	But in this case there should be no problem.	St
1.7.4	That's the honest answer.	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	OT: How was the pumpkin pie yesterday?	St
1.8.2	As Sheriff Andy use to say, &quot;Mighty good pumpkin pie Aunt Bee, mighty good&quot;.	St
1.8.3	Was it that good?	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	Ahh.	St
1.10.2	by R. Proffitt - 11/26/09 12:28 PM In reply to: Re: Why vs. normal.	St
1.10.3	by Big Steve The pumpkin pie is in the oven.	St
1.10.4	Did you mean there is no more pie or that your Mrs. burned it in the oven and that there was no pie yesterday?	St
1.10.5	If it was the latter, sorry to hear about that.	Polite
1.11.1	Unlike the cake is a lie ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the+cake+is+a+lie ) the pie existed for a short time.	St
1.11.2	Now much like a Black Friday sale item it is gone.	St
1.12.1	Well it must have been good.	St
1.12.2	I had one here at my house, my neighbor, Mrs. Smith made mine.	St
