It's now clear you are not using English.
Let's say you have an existing RAID 0 you want to convert to RAID 0+1.
There is NO DOCUMENTED METHOD to do this because you have no details from what RAID controller you are using today.
If it is possible your documentation must tell you how.
DO NOT GUESS.
Read the fine documents and if you don't see it, then it doesn't offer such.
