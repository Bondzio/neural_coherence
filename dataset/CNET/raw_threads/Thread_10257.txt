The Epson only scans up to 34&quot;. Is there a solution that doesn't involve me buying another scanner? I'm wondering if I can find a longer carrier sheet, then maybe I could use that? Where could I get a longer carrier sheet? Due to legal reasons, I can't cut the receipts, only fold them. Folding them thus far has failed because the scanner thinks it's two sheets of paper and tries to tear the receipt apart. I tried a different scanning software, Vuescan, and that didn't work. It scans so far and then indicates a paper jam. Any solution needs to work quickly because I'm only allowed to scan these receipts for a few hours, so I have to work fast. Any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

And not one would deny entry because the copier only supported 11 x 17 paper. It appears your legal reason needs crosschecking. For now the solution is to use a CAMERA of sufficient pixels and crop it to size. However those that think that scanning is the answer, with photoshop and more what proof is there that the scan is legit even if it was scanned in one piece? Hence the &quot;legal&quot; aspect crumbles. Bob

Not knowing what your funds are, it far better to ask the pros on this topic. If this is a common request, then the solution is already known. What, I have found is contacting commercial sources and/or business that deal with such needs and query there. I offer that as while I've fixed many PCs and devices there is a level of commercial needs that goes beyond what if part of the typical desktops. There I'm sure business offering the service and will allow to ask what can be had to fulfill the need in order to get your possible business. Though you need not buy from them. Aren't there any trade papers that offer such services/devices? tada ----Willy

This is a court case where in order to prove the business income, I have to go to the business and copy or scan the documents on site. I'm not allowed to cut or or otherwise manipulate the receipts other than to fold them. If used a camera with a 28mm lens does anyone know if that would be readable? I could copy all the receipts with a commercial copier rental but that would be 5 pages per receipt and the cost would add up quickly. Thanks.
