What is the most efficient, most powerful Intel processsor I can buy, money is no object? On the other end of the spectrum, where money is a concern, maybe up to $200- $250, what is the best Intel offering? I won't be doing games, photoshop mostly.

(if you're a pro that edits extremely large content, vista 64bit + 64bit cs4 + 6-8gb of ram are an ideal combo. read this link for more info: http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb404901&sliceId=1 ) core i7: core i7 920, 2.8ghz, 1mb/8mb L2/L3 cache, $300 core i7 940, 2.93ghz, 1mb/8mb L2/L3 cache, $570 here are intel's mainstream quad and dual core processors. note that the core i7 920 will outperform the q9650 in most intensive photoshop tasks (things that take 20+ sec to finish). if your photoshop work is less taxing, a q9400 will give you great performance. core2quad: q8300, 2.5ghz, 4mb L2 cache, $190 q9400, 2.66ghz, 6mb L2 cache, $240 q9550, 2.83ghz, 12mb L2 cache, $280 q9650, 3.0ghz, 12mb L2 cache, $345 core2duo: e8400, 3.0ghz, 6mb L2 cache, $166 e8500, 3.16ghz, 6mb L2 cache, $190
