I have a home network with three computers.
My desktop (Windows XP Home) and my laptop (Windows ME) work OK. My wife's desktop (Windows 2000) does not participate although it has no difficulty getting to the internet via the same connection.
I have heard that Windows 2000 needs help to share files on a Windows network.
What can you suggest?
Thanks.
