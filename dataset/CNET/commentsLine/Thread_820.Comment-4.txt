interesting.
even after running the installer for a printer, it no longer sees that printer?
do a search for all files that contain the name of the offending printer, even a partial name, and delete everything found.
reinstall.
you say that after &quot;starting&quot; again, the document just goes back in the queue and the queue stops.
did you try deleting the document and starting with a an empty print spooler?
