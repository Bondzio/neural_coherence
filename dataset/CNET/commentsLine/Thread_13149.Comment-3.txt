i bought a lite on 1633s because it was cheaper and i stupidly forgot that one gets what they pay for.
i bought it on a thursady; it was dead by sunday morning.
aside from quality issues, the plextor comes with roxio, while the lite on comes with nero.
nero is not an acceptable substitute for roxio, so - case closed!
plextor!
