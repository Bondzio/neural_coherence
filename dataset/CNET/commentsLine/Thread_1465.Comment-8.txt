this may not refer to you because your talking about a vista beta, which is obsolete.
but vista will slow down any system incredible due to all the resources it uses.
xp should be okay with a gig of ram but a clean install might help.
i would go with simple unix based systems  or  both are very good.
check them out, your computer will run like new.
i recommend deleting the whole hard drive but you can dual boot with windows pretty seamlessly.
there are some limitations with the programs available but it's worth it and a learning experience
