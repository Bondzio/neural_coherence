The uses will be heavy microsoft office functions, possibility of engineering CAD applications in near future, and moderate gaming. I would also like something failry media capable. No need to include OS or office in this budget but I would like a decent set of 5.1 speakers as well as a monitor(19inLCD?). What are my best hardware options here. I'm mainly curious about what CPU, motherboard, video card, and RAM to use. Also any speacial comments on good tv tuner, monitor, and speakers would be helpful. Feedback would be appreciated.

I would go with a pentium 4 640 (atleast) if u are sure you want a Pentium for the mobo, I can't help really, I only know about athlon mobos for the videocard, I would go with one of the Nividia 6000 series cards....probly a 6800 GT (either an XFX, Leadtek or eVGA) and I would go with 1 GB of RAM

I have no idea how they perform for gaming. It would seem that the new Dual CPU Intel with hyperthreading also would be a good plus for CAD, but with the video card and CPU, not much money left. LOL
