<s> To all, I need to buy a graphics card but I have a 200 dollar budget and I want somthing good. </s>
<s> Any suggestions ? </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> In your world or time-space what is 200 or less? </s>
<s> Did you research what you can obtain to see if there are benchmarks at www.tomshardware.com? </s>
<s> And given no applications you could be doing video editing which some of the staff does on 4 megabyte ATI cards that were 12 bucks. </s>
<s> Video editing doesn't strain a video card, games do. </s>

<s> Buy a good game with the $40 saved. </s>
<s> Thanx Dude, appreciate it. </s>
<s> I've recently been looking for that card but every where I found it, it was around $250-$270. </s>
<s> Talking about the 6600GT not the 6600 that can be had for $112. </s>
<s> Right now the eVga version of the GeForce 6600GT for $159 (after rebates) is currently out of stock at Newegg. </s>
<s> Can get on their waiting list or pick another starting at $167 from here: http://tinyurl.com/creg3 Newegg is extremely legit and reliable, many people including myself have had good dealings with them. </s>
<s> I do shopping on line with different merchants, but order and give my credit card number over the telephone. </s>
<s> You can call toll free and they will accept a money order by mail if you do not have a credit card: http://www.newegg.com/CustomerService/ContactUs.asp Their policy: http://www.newegg.com/CustomerService/PolicyAgreement.asp </s>
