<s> Have an iMac 400DV, slot load, OS 9.2.2 that blew up. </s>
<s> Logic board and analog board are toast. </s>
<s> Repair removed hard drive, and determined data was recoverable. </s>
<s> Now, have bought new iMac G5, 1.8, SD.and would like to transfer some files from old HD if possible. </s>
<s> Backup was current to 2 weeks before crash and burn. </s>
<s> What is best way to grab files from old HD? </s>
<s> Do I need an enclosure for old HD as well as cable? </s>
<s> Thanks for help. </s>
<s> Given that your old machine is toast, a good and lasting way to move the files and have an external drive for later use is to purchase a Firewire enclosure. </s>
<s> Other World Computing sell a nice one for about $60. </s>
<s> It comes, as they all do, with the necessary Firewire cable and instructions. </s>
<s> As you are using OS X, no drivers are necessary. </s>
<s> Just put the old drive in the enclosure. </s>
<s> Connect the Firewire cable at both ends and power up the enclosure. </s>
<s> Within seconds, your old HD will appear on the desktop, ready for you to drag your old DATA files to the new machine. </s>
<s> Do NOT drag the Application files to the new machine, they will NOT work, but you knew that anyway. </s>
<s> It's a really easy fix and you have the external drive for extra storage later. </s>
<s> Hope this helps P </s>
<s> Thank you for the quick reply. </s>
<s> Sounds great, I like the idea of the extra drive, and also thanks for letting me know where I can go to get the enclosure. </s>
<s> M.S. </s>
<s> Got sidetracked with taxes, but finally followed your advice and wanted to send my thanks. </s>
<s> I got a firewire external drive enclosure from OWC and everything works like a charm. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the great help. </s>

<s> I appreciate you coming back to say that it all worked. </s>
<s> Enjoy P </s>
