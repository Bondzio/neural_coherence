you have two dsl internet connection (yours and your wife using fiber optic) you want to use that fiber optic to connect to your isp.. am i correct?
if it is .. then its not possible.. because that fiber optic is assigned by your wife isp to one phone line.
you may change your current connection to fiber optic if you want...
