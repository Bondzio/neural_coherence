<s> Hey everybody. </s>
<s> I had my dad put together a new computer for me for Christmas, and I was hoping to use my old 200gb Western Dig. </s>
<s> Hard drive. </s>
<s> It hasn't come in the mail yet (freaking UPS...), but I looked at the specs my dad printed out for me. </s>
<s> It's got 2 SATA2 slots and one IDE slot. </s>
<s> Now, since I already have a DVD-RW drive and a hard drive from a previous computer, I want to use those both on one IDE cable, in the one slot. </s>
<s> I'm assuming to set the jumper on the hard drive to Master and the DVD drive to slave, but I want to make sure I can go ahead with this without it being horrible for performance or just will not work. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if this will be an alright set up or will work at all? </s>
<s> I wouldn't see why not, but I've never linked a hard drive and optical drive on the same cable. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>
<s> Then you can place them on either cable connector ... the system always treats whichever drive is at the end of the cable as 'Master'. </s>
