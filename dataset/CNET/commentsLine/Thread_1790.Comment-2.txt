while most of this can be found on google searches, for the money you paid for the card, they can't supply a manual to document 802.11g, all the possible tweaks, why you may want to change a setting and maybe even a primer on networking in general.
so to cut costs to the bone, i find the product in some small box with possibly a quick start guide and warranty card is the cheapest.
some buyers of networking components need a lot more information and as such can go to cisco training, buy all the books and more.
it's all a big question about how much is the customer willing to spend for such and why penalise those who just want to connect up their laptop.
i don't have this answer, but maybe the answer is as we see it today.
you want more, you can buy it.
