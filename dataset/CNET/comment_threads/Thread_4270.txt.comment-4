I just purchased a Panasonic SDR-H18.
The video transfers to my computer fine using the software in the box ImageMixer.
but i can not get it to imovie or because it shows up as a &quot;.mod&quot; file.
does anyone know what that is and how to send these movies to my clients so they can view them on their PCs?
I am using a MAC.
Also I am assuming this camcorder does not have a DV port because it says nothing about it in the manual.
Obviously I am a newbie to camcorders.
Can you give me any advice?
Thanks.
