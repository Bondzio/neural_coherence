The model of the new one is HP 255, some basic specs are like this: AMD E2-2000 1.75G CPU INTEGRATED Radeon HD 7340 Graphic card 4G DDR3 1600 RAM 500 G HDD hard disk. Win8 OS I never use the computer to play game or watch HD movies, so I thought even this cheap one (300 euros) can satisfy me. But after I got this, I noticed the performance is really really bad. There is even some freezing when I browse the web pages. Flash video is not smooth either, crappier than my 3 years old laptop. The Windows Experience Index is 3.9, which is again much lower than my previous laptop, a 3 years old ThankPad T400 (4.8). So I am really frustrated and got confused why a model which was produced in the spring this year can be this bad. And the specs didn't even look too bad compared to some other 500 euros laptops Then I re-checked the specs and noticed that the graphic card is integrated (didn't noticed that before). Could it be the reason why the system is so slow? Do you think increasing the RAM, for example, to 8GB will help it? And like how much the improvement would be? Like I mentioned, I don't use it to play games. I only need a laptop that I can browse web smoothly. Thanks!
