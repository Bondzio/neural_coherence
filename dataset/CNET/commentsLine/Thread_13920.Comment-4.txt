pressing the on off switch repeatedly.
that worked for me yesterday.
i bought a mobo and put everything in and when i pressed the power button nothign happened.
i thought somethign was wrong so i kept flcking the power supply switch on/off while keep pressing the power button and my mobo turned on.
