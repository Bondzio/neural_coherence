but first, understanding what chip it is will not fix this board.
after decades in the biz and in design i have yet to see anyone fix a motherboard.
these are too cheap for anyone to replace chips.
ok, back to the laser focus -&gt; you have a dead motherboard.
if it failed, then it's not the bios since that's code and on 99% of the boards you can put in new code.
so that's it.
you replace the board.
sorry to see you dancing around what you really want to ask.
i'm guessing you want to know which chip to replace.
