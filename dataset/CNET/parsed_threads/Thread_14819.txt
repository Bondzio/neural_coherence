<s> Hi, I have a 2Wire 1000HG Router in an office in my shop hooked up to a desktop system using a direct Ethernet cable. </s>
<s> I have another desktop hooked up using a 2wire wireless unit(about 30 feet away and works great). </s>
<s> I have another desktop in a home office about 300 feet away(not working to great). </s>
<s> I tried wrieless a couple years ago but it was just to far away. </s>
<s> I had AT&T wire the same phone line to my house as I was using for the DSL service. </s>
<s> I then hooked this home office computer up using the 2Wire PC Port Adapter and it worked so so. </s>
<s> Now it hardly ever works. </s>
<s> What can I do to make this a wireless connection? </s>
<s> Or what can I do? </s>
<s> When this is solved I need to network these three computers if its possible. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> Maybe a couple antennas from www.cantennas.com No one will tell you this will work and it should be unreliable some of the time. </s>

<s> Bob, that site has nothng yet. </s>
<s> I emailed whoever it was that has the site. </s>
<s> Hopefully they get back to me. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://www.cantenna.com/ Btw, typing cantennas into google.com does find this product. </s>
<s> You might try using Homeplug devices that send the network over the power wires. </s>
<s> --- CHAS </s>
<s> I am not familiar with these units. </s>
<s> Do you have one type or manufacturer to recommend? </s>
<s> I would like to read up on how they actually work and/or what they actually do. </s>
<s> Do they plug into a wall outlet by the router? </s>
<s> or home computer that needs to be hooked up? </s>
<s> I have 3 phase wiring under ground to my shop(router location) and very high power transmission lines next to my shop and house. </s>
<s> Do not know if this would help or hurt my situation. </s>
