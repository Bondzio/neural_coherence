first, let's assume you are a &quot;normal&quot; person, living modestly because you have yet to win the &quot;big&quot; lottery.
of course there will be new technologies such as amd's am2 socket, but with all new technologies come premium prices.
when intel or amd introduce new technology, they heavily discount the &quot;older&quot; technology.
by &quot;older&quot; i mean by only a few months.
the big question is: what do you use your computer for?
for the latest and greatest games, you really don't need the latest and greatest technology------just an excellent graphic's card and enough (1gb) ram.
video editing is a different story.
you should definately consider building a system yourself---it is not difficult and there are forums full of people who will help.
the price of an ati x800xt graphics card is half of what it was just six months ago.
intel is approaching another price cut in its processors---about six weeks.
a good motherboard will run you only $100-150.
i would suggest you browse around a site like newegg.com and see how much the parts cost for what you want and then make a decision.
you may wait for new technology, but that technology will have a high price tag and may not be all that much better (as in ddr2 over ddr and especially rdram).
good luck!
