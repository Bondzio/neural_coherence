<s> I have tried the microsoft fix that is posted on their techie site about removing the registry keys. </s>
<s> One problem: i dont have the said keys as i have never had the roxio software that supposedly causes xp to restart rather than shutdown. </s>
<s> if anyone has any idea how to fix this i would appreciate it. </s>
<s> I have taken it to a techie already and he was unable to help me saying it was a microsoft software issue. </s>
<s> so i went home and checked the site with no luck. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> (and i'll keep checking the site) Loren </s>
<s> Two clicks from http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm is the XP Shutdown article. </s>
<s> Here's what you'll have to note. </s>
<s> There is no &quot;do this&quot; to cure your issue. </s>
<s> As to the ROXIO software, you may be unaware that WMP (Windows Media Player) can install a piece of that for you without you knowing. </s>
<s> To pass up a fix because you haven't installed Roxio may have left a fix untried. </s>
<s> Ooops, that's the magic word. </s>
<s> You have to &quot;try&quot; each fix. </s>
