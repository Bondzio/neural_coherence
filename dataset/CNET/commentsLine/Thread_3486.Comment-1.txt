is it possible to use my (no longer in use) linksys (pusu4) print server with my external hard drive to set up a wireless network drive?
my file server recently died and now i have the the files in one of my external enclosures, but its a pain to move it from pc to pc.
it would be nice if i could access it across the whole network.
if anyone has an idea of how to do this, please let me know.
thanks in advance.
