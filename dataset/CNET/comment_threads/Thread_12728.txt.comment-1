I will primarily use it in a home office.
No gaming at all or little use for movies, etc.
Mostly internet with office functionality (quicken, other finacial programs, etc) Maybe some media use.
Looking at the Dell XPS 400 and their 24&quot; widescreen monitor 2405FPW.
I definitely want the monitor so that leaves a max of roughly $1000 for the desktop.
I am very leery of buying refurbished with little warranty.
Dell seems pretty solid.
Any advice?
