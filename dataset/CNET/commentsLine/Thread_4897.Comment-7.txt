anandtech recently had a round-up of p965 based boards and the ecs topped out at a 300mhz fsb.
memory was run as ddr2-900 with 2:3 ratio and very relaxed timings (5-4-4-15).
given the ecs' moderate overclocking potential, i'd recommend you first test your current memory and see what timings they can run at as ddr2-667.
if they're no worse than 5-5-5-12, then just get 2 more sticks of good ddr2-533, set all 4 to the same ddr2-667 timings, and set your fsb to 250mhz (2.3ghz cpu).
