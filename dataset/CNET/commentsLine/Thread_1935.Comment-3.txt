the problem is that it shows that it is connected to the network expect every time you try to do something like load a web page it drops the signal and then gains it right back whenever i'm not trying to do something on the internet.
whenever i run the repair tool in windows 8 it tells me that the problem is the router but the router works with all of the other computers in the house and they never have this problem with the wifi so i'm not sure what it is.
