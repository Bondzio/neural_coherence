i will check the firewall this evening.
however,i thought the process of running the network set-up wizard was supposed to set the firewall properly.
as fo the ip setup i have it set this way..am i correct?
main system: ip: 192.168.0.2 subnet 255.255.255.0 default gateway: 192.168.0.2 preferred dns: 192.168.0.2 second machine; ip: 192.168.0.3 subnet: 255.255.255.0 default gateway: 192.168.0.2 preferred dns: 192.3168.0.2 i have also enabled netbios over ip.
i am connecting the computers through a dlink switch model des1105.
note that this is a new switch being used to connect the computers.
thanks for the help, mike
