<s> Hello I use Itunes on my computer to play my music. </s>
<s> My main music folder is called &quot;my music&quot;. </s>
<s> If I am attaching a mini ipod to my pc computer, will it transfer the music even though the music does not exist in the itunes music library folder. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> The iPod has a files mode which you can place music files into, but such will not play. </s>
<s> This is by design. </s>
<s> To get music into the iPod (the Apple way) you import such into iTunes and have it convert them and put them into the iPod. </s>

<s> SO even though I play all of my music in Itunes anyway (with playlists) if the music is not in the itunes folder it will not copy over to the ipod automatically. </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> And if it is then it sounds like the quickest solution is to open itunes and add the filles back into it again except this time make sure the option &quot;copy into itunes folder when adding to the library&quot; is checked in the advanced settings. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help </s>
<s> You should try that. </s>
<s> But your last reply is slightly different from your first post. </s>
<s> I may have missed it, but some do get confused over that &quot;files&quot; mode. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So if I confused you a little bit, But am I correct in saying that it has to be in the actual itunes folder? </s>
<s> &quot;it has to be in the actual itunes folder?&quot; AFAIK. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> The content has to be encoded with Apple's DRM (I'd rather not dive into that area) so the content on the iPod is not shared. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
