<s> I have a trendnet wireless router and my desktop is connected to the router with a cable. </s>
<s> I had an old laptop with a trendnet pc card and my speeds were great. </s>
<s> The problem is with my new laptop. </s>
<s> I no longer have the old laptop. </s>
<s> My new laptop has a broadcom internal wireless adapter and the speeds are really slow. </s>
<s> I did not change anything, I just took my new laptop out of the box and connected it to my wireless network. </s>
<s> When I connect the laptop with a cable the speeds are good. </s>
<s> I am using channel 6, with WEP and PKA enabled. </s>
<s> As far as I know there are no wireless networks close to my home. </s>
<s> I am not sure why the new laptop is so slow on the network compared to the old one. </s>
<s> Even transfering files from my desktop to the laptop is really slow. </s>
<s> Any help would be apprecated! </s>
<s> I think you may have a defect wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Because you said when you connected with cable speed is good. </s>
<s> One thing you can check. </s>
<s> Go to My Computer properties. </s>
<s> Select Hardware. </s>
<s> Select Device Manger. </s>
<s> Double click on Network Adapter. </s>
<s> Double click on Wireless adapter and check on device status. </s>
<s> It should say device is working properly. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Please let us know. </s>
<s> If you solve this problem. </s>
<s> How far is the laptop away from wireless router? </s>
<s> Is your wireless router support 802.11b/g? </s>
<s> Is your wireless adapter support 802.11b/g? </s>
<s> In my case the ROUTER'S FIRMWARE was at issue. </s>
<s> The update corrected something to allow my laptop to run at the higher 802.11g speed. </s>
<s> That issue drives people nuts since they think it's the laptop since the old laptop worked... Bob </s>
<s> Yes, the wireless adapter says that it is working correctly. </s>
<s> I tried the laptop all over the house, from right beside the router to 3 floors away. </s>
<s> Both support b/g. </s>
<s> I've had these symptoms several times myself and it has always been fixed using one of two methods: 1. </s>
<s> Update your router's firmware. </s>
<s> You should be able to do this by downloading the firmware update from the manufacturer's website and then accessing the Update Firmware option through your router's administration tools. </s>
<s> The details of this vary by brand/model and since I've never worked with yours I'm not sure about it. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Update the drivers for the wireless card on your laptop. </s>
<s> Just because the laptop is new, does not mean the drivers are up to date. </s>
<s> Quite the contrary actually. </s>
<s> To do this, go to the LAPTOP manufacture's website and find the drivers for your model. </s>
<s> I emphisise that it is the laptop manufacturer because they often have different drivers that setup for your laptop's specific configuration (this is assuming the card came with/was built into the laptop; otherwise, go to the card manufacturer). </s>
<s> Download the drivers and install as is instructed/intuitive. </s>
<s> Make sure you do both of these. </s>
<s> I beleive there was an update/change to standards a while back so if the router and card are out of sync as far as standards go there will be improper connecetions and hence terrible speeds. </s>
<s> Best of luck, -Toby </s>
<s> OK, I will check with trendnet to see how to update the firmware. </s>
<s> I guess I have some work to do tonight! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> OK, there was not a firmware update for the router, but there was a driver update for the laptop. </s>
<s> However this did not fix my problem. </s>
<s> I changed channels and that also didn't work. </s>
<s> So, I decided to turn off security and set a MAC filter. </s>
<s> Guess What? </s>
<s> That fixed the problem! </s>
<s> I am not sure if this is the best solution or why the security was slowing me down so much, but everything is working fine now. </s>
<s> My Dlink 524 did the same thing. </s>
<s> Later Dlink issued yet another firmware update and now WEP doesn't incur a slowdown. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What model number is your router? </s>
<s> It is a Trendnet TEW 432-BRP. </s>
<s> My speed is good but I keep losing my connection for no reason! </s>
<s> When I reconnect it works fine for a while, then it's gone again. </s>
<s> having same issue. </s>
<s> Using TEW-631BRP and pc card TEW-621PC. </s>
<s> losing connection. </s>
<s> Did you figure out how to fix this? </s>
