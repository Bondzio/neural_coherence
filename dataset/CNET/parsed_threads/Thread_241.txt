<s> Hi, everyone! </s>
<s> I have a feeling that you ppl may LOL so hard cos the stupid question Im going to ask. </s>
<s> Its okay to LOL cos I can take it! </s>
<s> LOL! </s>
<s> Okay, I have a 2.4P4 533FSB Northwood, I need a new motherboard. </s>
<s> Does any motherboard accept this CPU if it states &quot;Supported CPU, CPU Socket Type Socket 478, CPU Type Intel Pentium 4/Celeron, FSB 800/533MHz, Supported CPU Technologies Hyper-Threading Technology&quot;? </s>
<s> As you can see I dont have any clues about PC's. </s>
<s> So go ahead and LOL im not watching! </s>
<s> LMAO! </s>
<s> Always LOST in space w/o my CNET buddies out there to save me! </s>

<s> I took a look at your profile first and you show owning a Dell. </s>
<s> Though plenty of socket 478s are still out there, putting one in a Dell case might be a problem. </s>
<s> Is this the PC you are speaking of? </s>
<s> If so, the task of replacing the MB becomes more complicated. </s>
<s> As I said, socket 478s are plentyful. </s>
<s> Most of these should support your processor if it's working ok. </s>
<s> I won't offer specific recommendations as that depends much on what you want to do and what features you need. </s>
<s> As for myself, I like ASUS boards. </s>
<s> Dell also uses a non standard ATX MB and power connector, so it you get a non Dell mb and use the Dell PSU everything will go up in smoke. </s>
<s> So you may be looking at new MB, case and PSU. </s>

<s> Okay, my motherboard on my DELL is no good, so I want to buy a new one, a new case. </s>
<s> So I was just wondering when I look for motherboards if it states supports 533FSB that it will work with my CPU. </s>
<s> Btw, tks for the reply on which motherboard you like. </s>
<s> Thats a plus my dear old bud! </s>

<s> Most list the prescott now, Norwood was the predicessor. </s>

<s> but I'd suggest waiting for and getting as many replies as possible as others may have advice to offer. </s>
<s> It sounds as if your processor will work in any of a number of boards such as are offered at NewEgg as already suggested. </s>
<s> You can plug your CPU information into their MB options and get lots of hits in lots of price ranges. </s>
<s> Many are jumper free and will detect your CPU's capabilities and configure it for you. </s>
<s> You might or might not be able to use the memory that's on your Dell. </s>
<s> This is something else to consider. </s>
<s> Make sure you get a board that's socket 478 and not 775. </s>
<s> If you need a new case, get one with a power supply of 350w or higher. </s>
<s> Some folks will recommend more but your processor should run ok at that wattage. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> You have not turned on the feature to allow e-mail through your profile so I cannot respond to your query that way. </s>
<s> Here's my thoughts however. </s>
<s> It's best to keep questions inside the forums where someone with some knowledge of the problem can address them. </s>
<s> My own competence is limited to specific areas or situations. </s>
<s> Many others here are far more advanced or have expertise where I do not. </s>
<s> When you pose a question, you may get lots of responses and not all will be of value. </s>
<s> Sometimes subtopics break off. </s>
<s> Browse the forums and just read about other folks problems and the suggested solutions. </s>
<s> If you do enough of this, I can almost guarantee you will read about a problem you do not have now but will have in the future and BINGO!! </s>
<s> you will already now how to handle it. </s>
<s> Now, while I don't mind carrying certain conversations away from the forums, I think it's best to limit these. </s>
<s> The forums can get cluttered by one way conversations and that might be a time to move to e-mail. </s>
<s> But, for security reasons, I will not give out my personal address. </s>
<s> If you want responses through the forums, you need to edit your profile to allow this. </s>
<s> Okay this forum is close please dont respond to this forum cos I know what to do. </s>
<s> Thanks to the couple of ppl that helped me out. </s>
<s> I found everything that I needed. </s>
<s> So thanks again. </s>
<s> Btw, Steven trust me I wont e-mail 24/7 cos I dont often have problems with PC's to begin with. </s>
<s> It was just this one. </s>
<s> The reason why I asked you cos it might be so simple that its not worth posting on the forums. </s>
<s> Plus I've been reading posts from this website, most of the time it goes off topic. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
