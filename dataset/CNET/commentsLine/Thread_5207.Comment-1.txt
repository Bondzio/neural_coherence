ok, so i have this new state of the art computer, and somewhat older hp 40 (all in one) printer.
when i first connected the printer to the computer everything was ok. after several days, i cannot print anything from a web site.
if i pay a bill and i want to print the confirmation, i get an error message.
if i copy the confirmation and paste it to word, i still cannot print it until i do a reboot.
this happens everytime.
is it something to do with pop up blockers?
i am lost and don't know what to do.
i have the same pop up blocker i had with my older computer and ha never had this issue.
this is a xp professional os, while my ols one was windows 98. thanks for any help.
