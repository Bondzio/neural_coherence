years ago i bought their routers from walmart.
i encountered the same thing as many of you did: i could not find them anymore.
by around mid 2005 i called them and found they were closing down the business.
i could not get any support service as all their tech staff like product managers, product engineers had all got let go.
it is a sad story as these small companies trying to make it but not getting for financial support in hard time.
i guess the best bet is still stick with netgear and cisco or d-link.
i have been using d-link dir655 for years and being able to get firmware update and tech support when i need them.
