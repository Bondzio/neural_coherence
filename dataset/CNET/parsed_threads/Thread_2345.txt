<s> I was wondering if it is possible to use regular windows programs on the Windows server edition, specifically the 64-bit Standard Edition. </s>
<s> How would maxing out the specs with 8 processors and 32gb-RAM affect my gaming experience? </s>
<s> My intention is to be able to play video games at their max potential (as well as the Adobe CS3 suite). </s>
<s> Also, are PC parts compatible with a Server mother board. </s>
<s> but few games can take advantage for more than 2 processors. </s>
<s> as for compatibility, it depends on the server mobo. </s>
<s> some don't have pci-express slots (which would eliminate it as a gaming platform). </s>
<s> some have pci-x slots or may require ecc ram. </s>
<s> Let's say you had 32GB ram. </s>
<s> Ask how long it takes your CPU to compare some byte in a 32GB file that's in RAM. </s>
<s> That 2 or so GHz CPU may take some 16 seconds. </s>
<s> Does that much ram speed up or slow down today's Windows? </s>
<s> You also need to take into account that the computer would be required to run Windows Server Edition (64-bit Standard or Enterprise Edition) rather than standard Windows. </s>
<s> The idea is also to have 8 processors. </s>
<s> Not necessarily because every program I have will use the 8 processors, but because I tend to bog down standard PCs by trying to run the Adobe suite all at once. </s>
<s> Though I wouldn't expect that much ram to slow down Windows because Windows only uses X amount at anyone time. </s>
<s> I don't know if the concept would help with running a game such as Crysis (using it as an example because the game has ridiculous specs at the moment). </s>
<s> The memory interface. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter what CPU(s) you have since the total memory speed will result in many seconds to traverse all that RAM. </s>
<s> Many are just starting to comprehend that bigger (or more) RAM is not going to increase speed of say some game. </s>
<s> Maybe you need to find where the bottle neck is rather than piling in RAM as a cure all? </s>
