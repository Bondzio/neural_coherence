i had the exact same problem.
no rebate for me either on my fuji monitor from tigerdirect.
i will never shop at tigerdirect.com again.
they offer great rebates on everything but you must pay more in advance and hope you get your rebate.
i'll just pay an extra $20 next time somewhere else to avoid the hassle and risk of the rebate.
