i have been using the same wireless setup in my home for over a year.
we have a belkin surf wireless router and an arris modem from comcast, using cable internet from comcast.
in the house, we have 5 devices that are set up to automatically connect wirelessly: iphone 4, an old ipod touch, a macbook pro, a toshiba laptop, and a brother printer.
until recently, there has never been a problem with connectivity.
lately, certain devices have been losing connection.
for example, last night my husband and i were both using our laptops with no problems.
this morning, his is connected and my iphone is connected, but my mac is not (i get a timeout error and am not connected to the internet).
sometimes it's his laptop that drops the connection.
other times it's my son's ipod or my iphone.
it is never all of the devices at once (something is always connected), and each device always recognizes the network as existing yet cannot connect to it.
the only way i've found to solve the problem is to unplug and restart the router.
i have also tried to change the channel that the router is set to, but that has not seemed to solve anything.
the firmware is up to date.
we are password protected in an area with few neighbors, and there never are any unknown devices connected when i check the client list for the router.
any suggestions?
