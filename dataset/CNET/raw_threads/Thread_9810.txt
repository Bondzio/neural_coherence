It's having a Pentium III 450 Mhz clock and 100 Mhz FSB cpu. It's a Katmai Slot 1 SECC2 processor. I want to upgrade the cpu to 800 Mhz. But i think katmai CPUs have max 600 Mhz clock rate. Will 800 Mhz Coppermine be compatible with my ASUS P2B-VT Motherboard having Intel 440BX Chipset ? If no, then would upgrading the RAM from 192 mb to 384 mb (max possible) improve the system performance instead of the above mentioned cpu upgrade ?

You probably will get more bangs for the bucks (just my thought). How much do you think you want to spend?

Basically i'm upgrading this pc for improving the internet surfing(cos' browser is working slow), a lot of downloading and also some applications sometimes takes 30 sec - 1 minute to start up. Does a change from 450 Mhz to 800 Mhz Cpu clock would improve the above or the RAM upgrade from 192 MB to 384 MB or Both?

Might give you a little bump in system perf. Be malware free. You've got a low horsepower machine. Keep that startup list super skinny.
