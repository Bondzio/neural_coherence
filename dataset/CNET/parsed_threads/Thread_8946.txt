<s> I have a radeon 9550 video card with the latest drivers and catalyst control center installed. </s>
<s> I bought a s-video cable for $5 and connected it from the back of the video card to my 27 inch sony tv. </s>
<s> The problem is that the catalyst software doesn't detect the television. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Unlike the F-type connection there is no signal to tell a PC that a connection was made via RCA or Svideo. </s>
<s> Skip past all that &quot;detection&quot; and ask them how to turn it on. </s>

<s> Them who? </s>
