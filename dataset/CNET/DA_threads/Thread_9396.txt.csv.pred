1.1.1	I have an old ( 4-6ish I think ) Dell desktop that I use mostly for messing around with various Linux distributions ( I use Ubuntu normally ) .	St
1.1.2	Everything was working fine with a 1GB stick of RAM ( which I purchased as an upgrade ) that had tested fine with memtest when I first put it in .	St
1.1.3	I tried installing Windows 7 Public Beta just as a test .	St
1.1.4	The installation went fine , but then I was unable to boot the computer .	St
1.1.5	I put in a Linux Live CD ( I ca n't remember what distro ) and restored GRUB so that I could boot the existing Ubuntu installation .	St
1.1.6	That too , though , did n't boot , so I put in an Ubuntu Live CD to reinstall .	St
1.1.7	This is where things get weird .	St
1.1.8	Bits of the screen were blacked out and I could not click on anything .	St
1.1.9	This reminded me of a memory error , so I tried memtest again .	St
1.1.10	Sure enough , it showed up with an error after a couple of passes .	St
1.1.11	I then replaced the existing stick of RAM with an identical piece ( from the same kit ) and tried memtest .	St
1.1.12	It passed .	St
1.1.13	Then I tried to boot Ubuntu again from the computer ( it did n't boot ) and then tried booting Ubuntu from the Live CD .	St
1.1.14	Once again , I got the black marks .	St
1.1.15	I tried memtest and it now fails .	St
1.1.16	In other words , the same stick of RAM passed memtest before attempting to boot Ubuntu/Windows and then failed after .	St
1.1.17	This was true of two sticks of RAM .	St
1.1.18	What is going on ?	Ques
1.2.1	Here 's why .	St
1.2.2	There appears to be some hack tool out there that can rewrite some SPDs on memory sticks .	St
1.2.3	This is not an offer to detail that in any depth but to bring it up so you know to research that .	St
1.2.4	But ram does fail but outside of that one oddity my answer is no .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have heard that a bad motherboard can occasionally cause memtest to fail ( which makes sense , since the data transfers from the RAM to the software via the MB ) , but is it possible for this to only occur after some period of use ?	Ques
1.3.2	In other words , could a MB gradually cause a memory error or something ?	Ques
1.4.1	You have the motherboard , the OS , the power supply , cosmic rays and we ca n't stop there as you list possible causes .	St
1.4.2	It really does n't matter since we ca n't rely on failed sticks of ram .	St
1.4.3	Pull , replace it if you so choose and move on .	St
1.4.4	To diagnose exactly why it failed takes a small lab and a suitcase of cash .	St
1.4.5	Replacements are far cheaper .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Actually , that is exactly what I did .	St
1.5.2	I took the stick of RAM out and replaced it with a new one .	St
1.5.3	It passed memtest the first time , but after attempting to boot Ubuntu it now fails .	St
1.6.1	But looking over your post I ca n't tell if there are other issues with the hardware .	St
1.6.2	You set the direction of the discussion so let me note that memory failures can be caused by overtaxed power supplies , over heating components ( just last week found 2 loose heatsinks ) and the BAD CAPS issue .	St
1.6.3	Then we have that age old issue of setting the BIOS for the ram in question .	St
1.6.4	Today I find many owners glaze over we we need to discuss exact part numbers , bios versions and more .	St
