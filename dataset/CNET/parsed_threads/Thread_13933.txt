<s> Don't break your Alienware case or you'll pay dearly. </s>
<s> I damaged the left side panel of my Alienware case. </s>
<s> Contacted with their customer service and asked them to send me a replacement part. </s>
<s> Instead of just sending me the part, they asked me to ship the whole system to their facility, pay for two-way shipping, 2 hour of labor and the whole case!!! </s>
<s> All those things would cost me around $400 while they can easily send the replacement part to me for much less. </s>
<s> BTW, they don't cover if something happens to my system during shipping or in their facility. </s>
<s> If this is not ripping off customers I don't know what it is. </s>
<s> And here is the best part, when I called their customer service and asked for an explanation. </s>
<s> Their response was &quot;This is the way it is and if I want my case to be fixed, I have to spill 400 bucks&quot;. </s>
<s> They didn't even let me speak their manager. </s>
<s> What kind of customer service is this! </s>
<s> Are you insane! </s>
<s> Well, congratulations Alienware, you win one more complaint filed with the BBB against you! </s>
<s> You've got to realize that, unlike Dell, Alienware isn't a discount computer company. </s>
<s> The gamers who buying their high end machines easily spend 5 or 6 thousand dollars. </s>
<s> They wouldn't be as upset as you would. </s>
<s> Trust me, if this affects Alienware's business a lot, they would've had better service. </s>
<s> So , you think it is ok for some company to refuse sending a replacement part to the customer and force him to ship his whole system to their facility (without any logical reason) and make him pay 10X more what he would've normally paid. </s>
<s> I can easly go to ebay and buy the whole case for $150 if I really need to while they are asking me $400. </s>
<s> And you really think this is fair because Alienware sells expensive PC's. </s>
<s> WTF?! </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I would not feel comfortable sending some parts to some users. </s>
<s> If my company was to truly warrant the system, it might have to be shipped. </s>
<s> You didn't give the full details, but you would be right if it was something like a power cord or mouse. </s>

<s> Remember to keep the forum language G rated. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The damaged part is the left side case panel. </s>
<s> I accidentally spilled some paint striper on it and it ruined the paint. </s>
<s> I accept full responsibility and ready to pay for the replacement part. </s>
<s> But they want me to send the whole system to their facility and pay for the whole case. </s>
<s> That just doesn't make sense. </s>
<s> The rest of the system is perfectly functional. </s>
<s> So it's like I have a dent in one of the doors of my car and the mechanic wants to replace the whole chasis to fix the problem. </s>
<s> Some of the panels would have the the power supply mounted to it or even the motherboard. </s>
<s> This would be proper for them to want to keep the owner out of those areas during the warranty period. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> And for those of you who think that companies like Alienware can just walk all over customers and continue to get away with it, I have a favorite example: NEC used to be the computer powerhouse in Japan. </s>
<s> Their rigs were &quot;unreasonably expensive&quot; and &quot;mediocre&quot; at best. </s>
<s> To top it off, customer service was somewhat less than spectacular. </s>
<s> When companies like HP, Compaq, and Dell first hit the Japanese market with cheaper and better PCs, NEC said something along the lines of, &quot;Who cares? </s>
<s> Who are they anyway? </s>
<s> We OWN 97% of the market in Japan! </s>
<s> No one can touch us!&quot; Anyone care to look up NECs Japanese market share today? </s>

<s> What would you suggest? </s>
<s> Do you think he can get the paint job redone by a third party? </s>
<s> I think it might be worth a try. </s>
<s> Oh, and by the way, couldn't AW have told him that? </s>
<s> I know you're just doing what you have to do. </s>
<s> My bad yo! </s>
<s> I sent you a longer response, but my description of the company in question was apparently unprintable. </s>
<s> (Thinking about changing my name to Howard Stern...) </s>
<s> I can only share what I've seen from the other side. </s>
<s> We did allow such change outs but only after we had it in writing the owner was waiving the warranty from them on out. </s>
<s> Not many would sign. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If I were you, I'd probably just get someone to repaint the case for me. </s>
<s> You can get a really nice custom job for a good price. </s>
<s> As for the warranty, sounds to me like it was voided the moment you decided to buy from AW. </s>
<s> Fix it yourself...cheaper and better. </s>
<s> Next time around, you can either build your own rig or buy from Falcon Northwest. </s>
<s> (*Falcon always gets reamed for the prices they charge, but their kind of &quot;no-headaches service&quot; is worth a lot more than most people realize.) </s>

<s> I'll watch the language from now on. </s>
<s> He only meant me! </s>
<s> And that's okay, because I was being a @#$%*&^%$@#$%^ on purpose! </s>
<s> You're cool yo! </s>
<s> It's unlikely Alienware would end up like NEC. </s>
<s> Companies like HP only give good post consumer support because they'll seel more computers that way. </s>
<s> Their goal is getting more money, not helping you. </s>
<s> The gamers willing to spend thousands will buy Alienware PCs anyway, so there is no motive for them to be nice. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> There is no such thing as being right or wrong here. </s>
<s> People just need to know what they're paying for when purchasing something. </s>
<s> It's a lot easier for some kid to talk his dad into coughing up &quot;more money&quot; than it is for AW to convince someone who works for a living to shell out that kind of cash. </s>
<s> If someone starts producing comparable systems, (with a slightly cooler case, of course) and better service and support for about the same money, AW is toast! </s>
<s> They have no customer loyalty to rely on--they don't think they need it, and they certainly haven't earned it. </s>
<s> Basically, it all comes down to whether or not consumers can find a &quot;reasonable substitute&quot; for any given product or service. </s>
<s> And, as the stories of how poorly AW treats its paying customers spread, purchasing from another vendor or building from scratch become viable alternatives. </s>
<s> Yes, AW is capable of producing great machines...but at those prices would you really want to be one of the few who got stuck with a lemon? </s>
<s> Would you want to spend $400 just to get the paint touched up, or have a relatively simple part replaced? </s>
<s> Would you want to deal with a company that sold you an incredibly expensive machine and then insisted that you had to try to fix it yourself first if there was a problem? </s>
<s> A company that wouldn't take any responsibility for anything you broke while trying to fix it (as per their instructions), or during shipping (for repairs), or while it was in their care? </s>
<s> (Picture someone accidentally knocking your unit off a work bench and saying &quot;Whoops!&quot;) No my friend, you wouldn't. </s>
<s> &quot;Some kid talking his dad into coughing up more money&quot; is exactly right. </s>
<s> That's the kind of customers AlienWare has. </s>
<s> Frankly, AW is doing very well so far, while many other &quot;responsible&quot; computer companies went belly up. </s>
<s> Let's just watch and see, shall we? </s>
<s> will ask for money to buy from the very next company that comes out with the same hardware and a &quot;cooler&quot; case! </s>
<s> Picture this: A: &quot;You have Alienware?&quot; B: &quot;Yup!&quot; A: &quot;Well, so does everyone I know!&quot; B: &quot;But the case is so cool...it looks like an alien!&quot; A: &quot;Yeah, well I'm the only one on my block who has Dragonware...and the case looks like a Dragon!&quot; B: &quot;Wow...that sounds pretty sweet!&quot; C: &quot;Have either of you guys ever seen my Falcon?&quot; No one has a monopoly anymore! </s>
<s> I'm not one of those teenagers that AW usually deals with and I'll show them I'm a tough nut to crack. </s>
<s> I purchased AW because I wanted to get a really powerful system and they were offering free shipping, $200 rebate and most importantly 12 month 0% APR financing. </s>
<s> Believe me, I checked other options like building my own system before I went with AW. </s>
<s> If I got all the parts AW was offering at that time from different reselllers to built my own system, I would have saved only $200. </s>
<s> For $200 I got service(!) </s>
<s> and a cool case plus didn't have to built the thing. </s>
<s> So it was a good choice at that time. </s>
<s> You bought from AW because you expected them to be the best option--and they let you down. </s>
<s> Now you have a case of &quot;buyer's remorse&quot; and you're wondering whether you should've chosen some other option. </s>
<s> You either feel stupid and cheated, or you don't really have a problem. </s>
<s> You can't have it both ways! </s>
<s> Or maybe you just wanted some attention. </s>
<s> (&quot;Cyberspace can be a lonely place...&quot; New song in the works...) Would you buy from AW again? </s>
<s> Well, it would at least depend on how they resolved this issue...right? </s>
<s> Is it within their power to resolve things to your satisfaction? </s>
<s> Yes...since they're such a successful and profitable company...it most certainly is. </s>
<s> (Right, Dag?) </s>
<s> And the simple fact is that they don't seem to be willing to do so--which burns your cookies, right? </s>
<s> Believe me, as a management/marketing consultant, I'd love to be able to run down to the local Walmart and pick up an extra-large can or two of &quot;goodwill&quot; for my clients to spread around! </s>
<s> You're running around CNET forums telling people they don't need cooling fans, anti-virus software, spyware removal tools, or firewalls. </s>
<s> And now you're saying that AW can treat customers like crap and get away with it. </s>
<s> I rest my case! </s>
<s> SAmHughe: We do not sell individual panels. </s>
<s> You would need to purchase the whole case and have it replaced in our facilities. </s>
<s> These cases are custom built and come as a whole unit. </s>
<s> Yes...and if his unit gets busted up in transit, or one of your guys drops it, he's SOL. </s>
<s> We got that. </s>
<s> And you guys couldn't possibly fix things for less than $400, right? </s>
<s> We got that as well. </s>
<s> That is exactly what the customer service representative told me. </s>
<s> I was also told that it's gonna cost around $400. </s>
<s> My point is: Asking $400 for a plastic replacement part is beyond resonable. </s>
<s> Asking me to ship my perfectly working system to your facility instead of sending the part is unnecessary. </s>
<s> In your support site you show how to install a replacement front panel. </s>
<s> That means you let your customers get replacement front panels. </s>
<s> Why don't you send replacement side panels? </s>
<s> Please don't give me the &quot;custom built&quot; crap. </s>
<s> I'm looking at the case right now and don't see my name engraved anywhere on it. </s>
<s> That's what I called &quot;custom&quot;. </s>
<s> I bet dozens of identical cyborg green predator case lying around somewhere in your warehouse as I am writing these words. </s>
<s> If you don't built your cases then who does it? </s>
<s> Let me contact them maybe they are more reasonable then your company. </s>
<s> All I need is a part called &quot;ALIENWARE CT-BO1G-001 &gt;ABS&lt;&quot; It's a plastic part and It shouldn't cost more than 20-30 bucks. </s>
<s> Now you're talking a language they can understand! </s>
<s> You're wasting your breath. </s>
<s> They already got your money, so what can you do now? </s>
<s> Sue them? </s>
<s> And something plastic can't possibly cost $20-30. </s>
<s> Why do they use plastic side panel anyway? </s>
<s> Can't they get a decent stainless steel or aluminum case? </s>
<s> That piece of plastic is probably made in China at 99 cents. </s>
<s> -_- </s>
<s> He can't sue them, but letting other people know how they treat their customers will help to give AW &quot;a pain in the pocket&quot;! </s>
<s> These guys are fighting everyone so hard over a few bucks worth of stuff, so don't think they don't care about all the money they're losing through these forums! </s>
<s> Sooner or later, they'll have to do math! </s>
<s> of the real thing. </s>
<s> You see, I dismantled the case and striped it from all the plastic. </s>
<s> Underneath is a pretty decent looking steel full tower case (people say it's a modified Antec/chieftech/chemning clone). </s>
<s> I don't need any of the metal parts, all I need is the plastic cover panel which fits over the metal side panel. </s>
<s> that the thing would at least be coffee proof! </s>
<s> I just mailed a letter to them explaining my situation and demanding a resonable solution. </s>
<s> If this doesn't work, I swear, I'll let everybody who has access to the Internet know that AW charges their customers $400 for a 20-buck plastic replacement part. </s>
<s> Every major hardware forum going to get a post about this matter. </s>
<s> I am sure couple of their potential customers will hear about this too. </s>
<s> No matter how rich, how stupid, how teenager (in a sense that spend their dad's money)their customers are, nobody wants to pay 10 times more and risk their $4000 system get damaged for a simple replacement part. </s>
<s> They pretend they don't care, but they'll start caring soon enough. </s>
<s> The more noise you make, the more chance they'll resolve the issue to your satisfaction. </s>
<s> I mean, it's not like you're asking them for a brand new system or anything. </s>
<s> You've admitted that the accident was your fault, and stated very clearly that you're ready to pay for the replacement part. </s>
<s> All they have to do is send it to you, right? </s>
<s> BTW, I read a post by a guy who said that Falcon Northwest fixed one of his USB ports (that he'd accidently broken) without even saying a word to him. </s>
<s> He'd sent his PC to them for a completely different problem...and they took care of both problems...just like that. </s>
<s> They even sent him a T-shirt and a pack of really good coffee beans...along with a note saying, &quot;Thank you for being a Falcon Northwest customer!&quot; Now that's customer service! </s>
<s> And the next time I hear someone complain about FNW's prices, I'll gently remind them that the company &quot;earns&quot; its money! </s>
<s> As for AW, I feel like doing a Will Smith on their sorry behinds! </s>
<s> (&quot;Welcome to Earth!&quot; PUNCH!) </s>
<s> Sam seems to have disappeared...maybe there's a plastic side panel in his future after all. </s>
<s> that was the case but unfortunately, no word from AW yet. </s>
<s> I'm waiting my letter to arive their HQ. </s>
<s> If I don't hear from them at the end of next week, I'll go with more agressive ways to deal with this situation. </s>
<s> There are always many ways to solve a problem and you all are bickering over a computer part that has no effect over the functionality of the device. </s>
<s> If the user wants to merely replace that part, then the manufacterers (Alienware)should merely declare any part replaced or altered by the user outside of the original warranty nul and void for that specific part. </s>
<s> The user always has options left open to him. </s>
<s> For example, I can by a replacement battery for my ipod - but if I replace the battery myself that aspect of the warranty is void. </s>
<s> Considering the consumers of the Alienware goods, it would probally also be noted that a person of such tastse and expenditure would have above average experience in computer hardware. </s>
<s> Almost anyone who has bought an Alienware system has probaly calculated the cost of creating an equivalient computing system and the time involved. </s>
<s> So, for a manufacterer to refuse the request under any and all circumstances is obsurd. </s>
<s> If any and all fail, go and have a custom paint job on your case that looks 10x's better and really express yourself --- or just let it be. </s>
<s> That is my $0.02 and let it end - also get a life outside of a desk - multiple posts per day... - there is a whole world waiting out there. </s>
<s> Your pathetic attempt to make a point by the use of half insulting half criticizing comments really does worth $0.02. </s>
<s> So, thanks for self-evaluation. </s>
<s> First of all, you have no right to attack my personal life style. </s>
<s> How many hours I spend on my desk is NONE OF YOUR BUSSINES period! </s>
<s> You may agree, or disagree with what we are discussing here but, keep your passive-aggressive BS to yourself or I wont hesitate to report you. </s>
<s> Secondly, please read the whole discussion before you try to insult people. </s>
<s> While you were gargling with words like altered by the user outside of the original warranty nul and void for that specific part blah bla (as a cheap way to prove that you have some level of intellect) you have missed some very important points of this discussion. </s>
<s> 1- Functionality of a computer part does not (and should not) justify manufacturers unreasonable demand of charging its customers for 10 times more than that parts value. </s>
<s> In other words, if you damage your cars rear view mirror, the car manufacturer cant insist that you should send your car to their factory and let them replace whole windshield and charge you for that. </s>
<s> Your car would still be functional but, I bet, you wouldnt let it go, would you? </s>
<s> 2- Nobody talks about warranty. </s>
<s> This has nothing to do with my systems warranty. </s>
<s> Im not trying to get it fixed without paying. </s>
<s> I can get a new case for much less, have my case custom painted, or purchase a whole new Alienware case from e-bay. </s>
<s> The issue here is not the lack of options but, the manufacturers lack of support. </s>
<s> 3- Yes you can purchase a replacement battery for your i-pod from a third party manufacturer. </s>
<s> Maybe you dont know but, Alienware is the only manufacturer of those cases. </s>
<s> Hello, IT IS THEIR TRADEMARK! </s>
<s> I cannot go to some computer store and say Hey I screwed up my case, give me a replacement side panel! </s>
<s> So, if they proudly advertise that they have the most unique and the coolest cases, then its my very right to expect them to supply replacement parts for a reasonable price. </s>
<s> If they dont want to do that, thats fine, then they should inform their customers about this. </s>
<s> So they should have put a statement into their fine print saying that they wont supply replacement parts if the user damage the case. </s>
<s> People buy Alienware primarily because of these cases. </s>
<s> If I knew that I was going to be asked $400 for a plastic replacement part, I would have changed my mind about purchasing this system, so would a lot of people. </s>
<s> So your ignorant insults stemming from your under-informed viewpoint have no effect on me. </s>
<s> I will keep pushing this issue or I will let everybody know that Alienware has no support for their trademark cases. </s>
<s> There goes 25 more minutes on my desk. </s>
<s> Are you happy now?! </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Have you any experience with other small manufacturers or companies that specialize in a very small niche of the market? </s>
<s> For them, it is not a matter of service. </s>
<s> It is a matter of money! </s>
<s> Alienware may be pretty profitable, but not so much as you think. </s>
<s> Most people just admire from afar and settle for something that is 90% as good and half the price, this is the problem of most small manufacterers. </s>
<s> I had already read all of the threads before writing that commentary. </s>
<s> Alienware will not change its policies because you were ranting on an online thread. </s>
<s> Make them your personal vendetta, not this. </s>
<s> In the end, it seems that you don't care about your computer - just that they will not send you a part. </s>
<s> You know, sometimes these small manufacterers have catalogs for distributers where you could buy your part. </s>
<s> My friend, Jack, got his front panel replaced at Best Buy back when they sold some of the computers. </s>
<s> Remember: the Squeeky wheel gets the GREASE! </s>
<s> We are sitting on 44 messages on this thread (so far) and only 1 compliant. </s>
<s> Is some flunky from Alienware going to run up to his boss after reading this thread and say &quot;Boss, we have a problem!&quot; I don't think so Tim. </s>
<s> IMHO, the main people who buy these systems are parents with money to burn for their teenage boys. </s>
<s> They probably justify the expense by thinking that if the boy is on the computer, he is not getting any girl pregnant and not using drugs (parenting for the 21st century). </s>
<s> I have read all the threads and the only questions that keeps coming to my mind is how do you spill paint thinner on a case? </s>
<s> What project around the house dictated that you had to have paint thinner next to a $3000+ computer system? </s>
<s> Your Quote: &quot;So they should have put a statement into their fine print saying that they wont supply replacement parts if the user damage the case. </s>
<s> People buy Alienware primarily because of these cases. </s>
<s> If I knew that I was going to be asked $400 for a plastic replacement part, I would have changed my mind about purchasing this system, so would a lot of people.&quot; Um... thats why you don't see any &quot;statement&quot; saying that. </s>
<s> Look, I don't have any problem with your statements or how long you stay at your computer. </s>
<s> (actually, anyone who goes to the trouble of adding up how long someone else stays on their computer, just to make an argument about it, has some issues themselves.) </s>
<s> Your Quote: &quot;I will keep pushing this issue or I will let everybody know that Alienware has no support for their trademark cases.&quot; To each his own. </s>
<s> Live and Learn. </s>
<s> Just wait and see...That's all I'm saying for now. </s>
<s> will go running to the boss and tell him there's a problem...the boss will come to them and ask why sales are down by 10%. </s>
<s> Personally, I detest Alienware. </s>
<s> They are very expensive flashy machines that do have good parts, but are way over priced. </s>
<s> My current computer that I built for 500 bucks is the equivalent of one of the 2 grand Alienwares. </s>
<s> They have great video cards, but everything else is little more than average. </s>
<s> Hey Sam, Please give me a call; I would like to see if I could help you out. </s>
<s> Call the AW number and my extension is 4639. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Alienware has finally noticed the drop in sales! </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> Thats what you get for buying a over priced (and very ugly) computer. </s>

<s> Have you been reading up on Dell lately? </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> At least dell doesnt rape ALL of their consumers... only some of them. </s>
<s> Alienware is pretty much just saying &quot;bend over&quot;. </s>
<s> Also dell isnt the only one with a more price friendly computers. </s>
<s> Although HP notebooks dont have anything that can compare with the Nvidia 6800 or Ati x800, the ZD8000 does have a x600 which is still great for gameing. </s>
<s> And actually... alienware's lower &quot;gameing notebook&quot; has a intell extreem graphics 2. </s>
<s> The ZD8000 can not only compete with that, but it kicks its butt and its still way cheaper. </s>
<s> that my problem is solved. </s>
<s> I just got the replacement part today and paid only a fraction of the price which I was initially asked for. </s>
<s> I&#8217;d like to thank Alienware-JuanG and AlienwareRichard for personally interested in the matter and helped me out and also thank everybody who shared their thoughts by posting here. </s>

<s> On Friday 4/22/05 I ordered an Alienware ALX system. </s>
<s> The cost of the system was in excess of $7000.00, and there were only a few unresolved configuration issues that I was assured could be resolved. </s>
<s> Eduardo G. was the sales rep who took the initial order, and it was close to 6:00pm on the east coast and time for his shift to end. </s>
<s> We decided to resolve the remaining configuration issues at a future date, but that the order would be placed immediately in order to receive the discounts on that system which were expiring that same day. </s>
<s> When I called back several times to speak with Eduardo on Monday the 25th he was unavailable, but I did reach him on Tuesday the 26th. </s>
<s> It was like I was talking to a totally different individual. </s>
<s> His attitude was rude and condescending. </s>
<s> To make a long story short, I told him that I didn't call to argue with him, but there remained several unresolved issues. </s>
<s> He snapped back that he would give the technical department a call when he got around to it, at which point I said fine... but until those issues are resolved he needed to cancel this order in its entirety, and refund the charges made to my credit card in the full amount that had be charged and in as prompt a manner that was initially utilized to place the charge. </s>
<s> Needless to say it took almost 10 days two phone calls and three emails before I received the credit on the cancelled system. </s>
<s> But, to their credit, they ultimately did issue the refund for the cancelled system order. </s>
<s> We still needed a new computer, so I called Velocity Micro. </s>
<s> WOW what a difference. </s>
<s> The same system with everything I wanted from alienware (except the case with glowing alien eyes) Peaked and tweaked, dual raid setup, with a dual core pentium extreme edition overclocked to a &quot;STABLE&quot; 3.8 Ghz, all for over $1000.00 less than the Alienware system and best of all... a friendly and professional attitude. </s>
<s> So, I totally agree with your statements on Alienware... and in my humble opinion you can do much better and with less hassles at Velocity Micro. </s>
<s> (As a side note, I recall reading somewhere that the head of Velocity Micro was actually on the board of directors of Intel). </s>
<s> And, they also sell systems with the &quot;OTHER&quot; brand of CPU as well. </s>

<s> Ok i think i know whats going on here like my headline says. </s>
<s> This is what i think, im just going to call it like I see it. </s>
<s> I think your a fake. </s>
<s> My brother works for Alienware's technical support devision and I talked to him about your situation. </s>
<s> After discussing this with him I came to the conclusion that this is what happened. </s>
<s> You somehow got an alienware case, or never owned one at all, and decided to damage it if you did own one. </s>
<s> After doing that you got ahold of alienwares free technical support number and called them making up this bogus story about your damaged case so that you could get a free one in exchange for nothing. </s>
<s> The reason I say this is because Alienware never requires the customer to pay for service to there PC as long as its under the warranty. </s>
<s> They always send via email a free pre paid postage certificate that you can print out and use to put on a box that you ship your computer to them in. </s>
<s> Then they pay to send it back after fixing it. </s>
<s> pigs do occasionally grow wings--even if it doesn't happen very often. </s>
<s> Look, Alienware has dropped the ball on numerous occasions. </s>
<s> Everything is pretty well documented. </s>
<s> Maybe they're doing better these days, and maybe they're not...only time will tell...but don't try to tell us they never screwed up! </s>

<s> Yes, Ferrari parts do cost more, even though it is only a door! </s>
<s> all i have to say to this is one word: EBAY! </s>
<s> dont screw around with the manufacturer. </s>
<s> just go to ebay. </s>
<s> they have almost everything u need for anything. </s>
<s> just find it there. </s>
<s> I think you are both missing the real issue. </s>
<s> In order for them to be able to send a replacement part they would have to be the manufacturer of the case. </s>
<s> I am not 100% sure but I don't think alienware manufactures their cases in house. </s>
<s> In order to get a replacement part and not pay for a whole new case, you would need to contact whoever alienware contracts to build their cases. </s>
<s> Well Sam, many many thanks for that bit of info. </s>
<s> I almost bought an AlienWare Aurora ALX Desktop for 1.899. </s>
<s> After readimng your warning along with a few others I have decided to give Alienware the push, and go for a computer made by a more professional team with a bit of customer service. </s>
<s> i hate these **** who just want to rip their customers off. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Steve. </s>
<s> two things first NEC has taken like 30 steps back now and mostly makes large network &quot;phones&quot; for commercial use now i have not seen an NEC comp in years. </s>
<s> second Alienware made almost all their own componants till the dell take over which actually happened before the old invasion line was even made, so yeah if you have an alienware made after 2001 it is only half alienware and the outer hardware was made by either coolermaster or an off brand company based somewhere in china with no listed contact info oh wait one more thing you said something about their customer service not being good it could be worse try contacting Emachine tech support about a hardware issue, catch the joke yet Emachine does not offer tech support for hardware they only cover software the outsourse hardware tech support to a company who charges by the hour to help you and the hourly rate is not cheap. </s>
<s> I have owned many Alienware desktops and laptops over the years and I know all too well how much it costs to replace cases etc, but when i stumbled on this little gem i could nt be happier, Alienware laps and desktops at upto 60% off!!! </s>
