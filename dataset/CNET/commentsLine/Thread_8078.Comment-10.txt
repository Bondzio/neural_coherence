monitors from some manufacturers.
not as cheap as 16:9/10 because mass production nowadays are in wide formats.
why?
small screens, ie.
for computers, are sidebars for glass mfrs.
tvs are the main customers so monitors get cheaper in wide formats.
why wide tv?
because movie theatre screens are that way.
just gotta roll with the punches but it's ok to whine.
lots in these forums.
