Hello, I would like to buy a Dell Ultrasharp 1905FP 19&quot; TFT monitor, but unfortunately my video card is an old NVidia GeForce2 MX 400 which doesn't have a DVI connector.
Has anyone tested these two together?
How is the image and text quality like when the monitor is connected via the analog input?
Thanks, Vasile
