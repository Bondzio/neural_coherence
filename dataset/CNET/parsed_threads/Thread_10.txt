<s> Hi, I has got a 8 system(Say Node1, Node2,.....,Node7,Node8) in my LAN Network. </s>
<s> i Want a Group a 8 System's in Such a way that Node 2 Should Ping with Node1,Node3 Node4, But not with Node 5,Node 6,Node 7,Node 8. and ViceVersa. </s>
<s> Thank in Advance </s>
<s> It all really depends exactly what you want to do. </s>
<s> In the exact case you specify and assuming that you are using the same subnet for all the machines the solution to this problem is called private vlan. </s>
<s> This is a advanced vlan topic where the switch will not allow ports on the same subnet to talk to each other it will force the traffic via a firewall port. </s>
<s> This is generally done this way to preserve ip addresses. </s>
<s> You could place each machine on its own subnet and vlan and then use a more general ip based firewall solution but it depends on your requirements. </s>
<s> In any case you need a firewall. </s>
<s> If you can get one that contains enough ports you could plug all your machines directly into the firewall and avoid a switch and the private vlan issue. </s>
<s> Firewall tend to get very expensive the more ports you buy so most people use external switches. </s>
<s> Needless to say you need commercial firewalls to do this, most consumer ones do not have the ability to run as passive (ie layer 2) firewalls. </s>
<s> The only cheap solution I have seen involves running a consumer router that can run dd-wrt firmware. </s>
<s> This has many more advanced features and might do what you want. </s>
<s> It will not work at a layer 2 level so you would have to redefine your need so that your machines were in different IP ranges and define rules between the IP blocks. </s>
<s> If you have a lot of traffic between the machines this will not work well on cheaper routers mostly because they do not have the CPU capacity. </s>
<s> Of course if you dig there are methods to use a PC as a router running linux. </s>
<s> You could then build your own firewall of any size you wish but it is not a beginner project. </s>
<s> So given it's a LAN or LOCAL AREA NETWORK you would have to redesign it to be 2 LANs. </s>
