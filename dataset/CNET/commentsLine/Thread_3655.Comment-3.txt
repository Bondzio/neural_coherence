thanks for the info.
64-bit looks even better now.
now, as for 32bit gaming.
no overclocking since i'm inquiring about the longevity of the actual processor.
some top notch gaming laptops possess the athlon64 processor because it seems to handle 32-bit gaming very well, easing the mem to chip bottleneck and utilizing a large on-chip mem cache.
well, my question is simply this.
will the limited (2.2ghz compared to 3.2ghz) chip speed itself present a wall or is it less relevant considerig overall system performance with the amd?
