<s> Im trying to upgrade my dell inspiron 546 due to lack of funds to build a new rig. </s>
<s> I have bought graphics cards in past, but ive never bought a PSU or put in a PSU before, but I am sure, with guidance I could certainly do it. </s>
<s> I want to make sure these parts will actually work with my inspiron before i buy them so thats why I am posting here today. </s>
<s> PSU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139026 Vid Card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130839 I know that the current graphics card i have in now is a 220 GT and its worth about 30 dollars and its pretty old along with my computer. </s>
<s> So I dont know if this new card would even work with my mobo or anything and i also dont know if the PSU would fit in my tower ( Its not a slim so it should? ) </s>
<s> I didn't find your model so you should link to your exact model. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html on the page http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-3.html shows a few 650 video cards so a good choice. </s>
<s> That PSU looks to be the MINIMUM asked for (I read 450 Watt minimum on the pages so far) and the full review at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-boost-gk106-benchmark,3463.html has me worried about longevity of the PSU. </s>
<s> I see about 200 Watts alone for the Video card so if we want a 5 year machine we double the Watt capability of the PSU. </s>
<s> That's a bit high at 900 so the PSU is an iffy choice here. </s>
<s> If you can get another 100 Watts and keep the single rail +12V then you should be fine for years. </s>

<s> This is my computer, im not sure if this is what you wanted or not. </s>
<s> http://www.dell.com/support/troubleshooting/us/en/19/Servicetag/B508GK1 Instead of the 430 maybe a 600W? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139028 Im just worried about the card not being compatible with my motherboard. </s>
<s> &quot;PCI Express x16 one slot supporting full-height cards&quot; So can you share what made you think it was incompatible? </s>
<s> Once in a while you see a question about PCIe 1.x 2.x etc but the answer can un-nerve those that asked. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> While the first PSU choice was the minimum and should work, I winced at being too close to call. </s>
<s> This 600 is a single rail to avoid issues with setup and should get you years of use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ive had a few bad experiences upgrading video cards on a computer of mine when i was a kid, and I didnt know for sure if my motherboard had a PCI Express 3.0 x16 slot or if that card would fit, but thank you for your help. </s>
<s> So in conclusion I could upgrade my inspiron successfully with these parts? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130910 and http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139028 </s>
<s> That is what you can check ahead of time by getting the dimensions of the card and measuring. </s>
<s> As I don't own this machine all I can write is that it looks OK. </s>
<s> If you want, wait for someone that will assure you further. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I measured and it seems the boost wont fit, but the previous one i mentioned will definitely fit in my case. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help! </s>
