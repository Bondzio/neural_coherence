But when I upgraded about 6 months ago, AMD was clearly not the processor to buy. Based on what I've read recently about Phenom, believe it's same today. My advice, try the link below and go from there. Armed with the CPU names, you should be able to find other reviews and articles that should be hitting the stores soon. http://www.anandtech.com/GalleryImage.aspx?id=19 Regards, VAPCMD PS...What kind of problems are you having with the current rig ?
