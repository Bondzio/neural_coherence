does your mobo have on-board video and you installed a separate card and you have the monitor plugged into the wrong connector?
i've done this and by not getting any beeps, the mobo is fine and won't beep a video error (three short beeps)because the on-board is enabled by default in the bios.
if this is not the case, try reseating the video card firmly by taking it out completely and then reseating.
then check for bent pins at the connector for the monitor to the card.
one long beep would be ram not seated firmly or incorrect ram for the mobo....but since you have three sticks, take two out and start with just one, and keep replacing that one with the other two one at a time in the 0 or 1 slot to see if it will boot up.
if it does, then you know that one of your sticks isn't seated correctly or isn't matched up with the other two correctly or you might even have a bad slot for ram on the mobo (warranty item for ram or mobo).
i would also disconnect the floppy drive and only plug in a keyboard to begin.....kiss is the key and you've done well with your troubleshooting so far.
