One day i decided to go off to the store and buy DVDs to burn some of my files, when i cameback home my computer was running yet there was no display no nuttin on my Monitor it was as if everything froze, the power button didnt work either.
So i disconnected it.
reconnected it and got a eeeee sound as if the computer wasnt feeling the power, like a car wanting to turn on but it wont.
I thought it was the PSU, i just bought one today and installed it, i connect it, and i kear the SAME eeeee sound, the sound i think comes from the PSUs ( not 100% sure but pretty certain) and I know that the SPUs is not to blame.
I wanted to know what could be the problem?
Motherboard died?
Or in worse case scenario, CPU died?
