So I need help/tips on possibly improving that speed. Also the router is located in the basement on the left side of the house in the back. Upstairs to the far right front side I have a media player which gets a decent amount of wifi. I am wondering how can I improve the wifi speed and coverage in my house. I dont know if I should use a repeater, extender? I was suggested a repeater and locate it half way upstairs or downstairs(below the upstairs media player) or should I use another router for an extender/hotspot (I think that is what I was told). Please any help and information will help a lot!!

I already thought about putting the router in the middle of the house. Requires long cord from modem to router but that would seem more work with wires etc.. i just prefer if I can use another router or repeater.

I was thinking you meant relocate the router like for me to use a 100ft Ethernet cord from the modem to the router, placing the router in the middle of the house (which would mean staying downstairs still but just in the middle) to receive better wifi signal around the house.

I plug the other in a central location and the ethernet to the router. It's one of those basic things that places that sell them should be able to boil it down to 2 steps and then talk a little about the 2 phases in your AC system. I'll stop here with I've yet to find a bad unit. Bob
