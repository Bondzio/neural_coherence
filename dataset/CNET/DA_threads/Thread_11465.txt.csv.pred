1.1.8	Isumbras	St
1.2.1	is sending out 802.11B and not just G and N. This could be the problem .	St
1.2.2	Access the router , see the manual , and make sure that it is broadcasting on all three channels B , G & N P	St
1.3.1	Many thanks for the tip ~ I 'll check straightaway .	Polite
1.3.2	I	St
1.4.1	Sadly not the root of the problem - Interface Type :	St
1.5.1	Now that we have established that , there is a next step .	St
1.5.2	I assume that you are not spreading the wealth around the neighborhood by running a wireless network that does not have encryption .	St
1.5.3	The next step is to turn OFF the encryption and see if you can now connect to the router with the PowerBook .	St
1.5.4	Let us know P	St
1.6.1	Ok , I 'll give it a go in the a.m. and come back to you .	St
1.6.2	Many thanks again - I 've been working with Macs since 1992 and do Mac support myself but this one has me stumped .	St
1.7.1	Yes that works .	St
1.7.2	Can log into wifi from PowerBook G4 when encryption is turned off .	St
1.7.3	Unfortunately have had to re-enable encrytion as have a lot of data on other machines logged in to wifi .	St
1.7.4	I guess we 're a little closer to an answer though ; you are top man .	St
1.7.5	Maximum thanks for all the help .	Polite
1.7.6	isumbras	St
1.8.1	I have found that my older machines will only work with WEP .	St
1.8.2	The newer stuff leaves them out in the cold P	St
1.9.1	Ah , could be it - encryption type is WPA+WPA2 .	St
1.9.2	Many more thanks .	Polite
1.9.3	I 'll get on to the ISP .	St

1.10.1	It is up to you to set what type of encryption you use on that router .	St
1.10.2	P	St
1.11.1	Many , many thanks for all your help .	Polite
1.11.2	Edited the security preference in the Router Gateway to WEP and Lo the Powerbook now logs in fine .	St
1.11.3	Plusnet - who only came up with the correct solution after I had fed the info on the basis of your information - said i would have no problem logging on with my iMac which was not the case .	St
1.11.4	Are n't they supposed to know this stuff ? !	Ques
1.11.5	Fortunately I managed to remedy the iMac login and now wait to see if I can get my wife 's PC ( spit ) to connect .	St
1.11.6	HeyHo Best wishes I	St
1.12.1	WEP is no protection today .	St
1.12.2	That is , in less than 120 seconds with kid friendly software other folk can hijack your connection and use your internet connection as they wish .	St
1.12.3	BUT IN THIS DISCUSSION it looks like you are stuck with it .	St
1.12.4	When you can , and when the machines allow it , move off WEP ASAP .	St
1.12.5	And let 's be clear .	St
1.12.6	MAC address filtering does not work and hiding the SSID only results in more complaints and no added security .	St
1.12.7	-- & gt ; Use what works but be aware of the downsides .	St
1.12.8	Bob	St
