Back in its day it used to be a BEAST but I'm finding it lagging behind a little. I'm just going to post a list of my hardware and have you guys point out what you would think would be the highest priority upgrade. Thanks for all the help! (Sidenote: My HDD is running out of space, would you recommend just buying an external or getting a new internal and making it a slave drive?) Mobo: GIGABYTE GA-MA790X-UD4P Processor: AMD Phenom II x4 925 ~2.8GHz (O/C'd to 3.0 GHz) RAM: 4GB GPU: Nvidia GTX 550 ti 1024mb GDDR5 HDD: Hitachi HDP725050GLA360 500GB PSU: (unnamed) 750watt Primary use for this is gaming.

Personally I wouldn't have thought it was a hardware problem on a quad-core after only 2 years. Although I see it's overclocked so no doubt you have improved the fans and venting to allow for increased heat. Other than dust around the fans and vents, I would then look at software itself. Even after 2 years a system gets clogged up with software installs affecting startup and load on the CPU and RAM with running Processes and Services, so may be you can trim those down. As to hard drives, I don't think it really matters if it is for storage only. An internal will increase the load on the PSU but 750s watt should be fine. However I understand that PSU wattage drops over time, so you could check that. It's just as easy to copy off personal files onto an external, (and don't forget your backup copies on additional external media), as it is to an internal. I'm no technician, but I'm guessing that cleaning the inside of the case and housekeeping the install itself would help a lot. Mark

And most likely you have a SATA drive. Then the best choice for your new drive is another SATA drive, and those aren't master/slave. The main reason for performance slowing down gradually is software running. So the priority upgrade is a simple reinstall of your OS and the applications you need. Upgrading CPU, RAM or video only is indicated if that particular component is the cause of the machine being too slow. That depends on what it's being used for and what is slow in particular. The best remedy for a long boot time, by the way, is installing the OS on a SSD in stead of a HD. My colleague Bob Proffitt probably would advice you to buy a &quot;hybrid&quot; hard disk and use that to install Windows and programs on, while using your current one only for storage. But it hardly helps for faster video rendering. Kees
