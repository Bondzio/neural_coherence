I have an Android phone that has a SSH application that I would like to use to access the Internet when I am away from my home network. Two questions arise.... 1. Will Comcast allow a SSH server to be set up 2. If so, can regular mobile networks handle SSH activity the way a WiFi network does.

Based on the following link, it looks as if it IS possible to port forward a SSHD on Windows XP...... http://customer.comcast.com/Pages/FAQViewer.aspx?seoid=What-ports-are-blocked-by-Comcast-High-Speed-Internet&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1

Yes, you are probably in violation of some agreement but I leave you to figure out if you want to fret or not. About item 2. Yes. Most do just fine. But you have to test such. Bob
2436	4	528437	5141005	5140842	R. Proffitt	5/31/11 12:19 PM	1.30684434E12	Don't take this wrong but why did you stick to 22?	Here I can put it on any port. In fact, why not change it to be just a tad more secure?
2436	5	528437	5141006	5140998	wein3150	5/31/11 12:19 PM	1.30684434E12	OK	The final question is the setup of the server. I have a residential account - I think a Comcast business account is required to set up and run a web server. I want SSH secure Internet access, I need to access both and Internet server and a SSH server on the same machine- correct?
2436	6	528437	5141027	5141005	wein3150	5/31/11 12:42 PM	1.30684572E12	A tad more secure being	over 1024? for example
2436	7	528437	5141018	5141006	R. Proffitt	5/31/11 12:46 PM	1.30684596E12	I'm left to guess.	Why you think this and whether you are fretting about this or not. Many have setup servers but the ISPs have looked the other way unless you try and go commercial and sell stuff. And since we can use DYNDNS and use another port, why are you thinking there is anything to stop what you want to do? Bob
2436	8	528437	5141032	5141018	wein3150	5/31/11 12:58 PM	1.30684668E12	I guess	I am confused about whether or not I need to set up an Internet server or not if I am outside my home network and want ssh access to the Internet. The app SSH Tunneling (Android Market) gives the user SSH Internet access. It seems too simple to just configure a Windows SSHD on my home PC via port forwarding and get all that safe Internet power..... Doesn't make sense to me, I guess.
2436	9	528437	5141042	5141032	R. Proffitt	5/31/11 1:07 PM	1.30684722E12	Ok, what does not confuse you?	We see that we can put any server on any port. That should be confusing. We know that if we keep away from being commercial, the ISP looks the other way. But why would we think there is a safe internet? Bob

2436	11	528437	5141613	5141042	wein3150	6/1/11 10:53 AM	1.30692558E12	How safe is the Internet	I just had to make this general comment after you raised the question about whether we should think of the internet as safe (at all!) Security on the Internet does seem like an oxymoron - and becoming more so every day. Having said that, I am reminded when I used to do a fresh Linux install and the &quot;what level of network security&quot; do I want to select..... One of the levels was &quot;PARANOID&quot; Now, it seems that this level of network security is the norm, that every developer now must build in so many layers of encryption as to practically render their apps so weighted down due to this security issue that it must burden them beyond belief. My real question to you is this. If I work in a company with heavy computer network security, and I want to use a SSH tunnel or a Wifi to get to the Internet at work, are IT security people able to now eavesdrop on my Internet activity almost out of the air? Now, that's ridiculous paranoia - or is it? You tell me!
2436	12	528437	5141623	5141613	R. Proffitt	6/1/11 11:02 AM	1.30692612E12	Tunneling at work.	That is usually a question for the IT staffers. Most of the time it's not allowed because it's a possible route of something bad getting past the defenses. The same story applies to memory sticks that folk carry in. Frankly I think folk should not break any company rules on this. Their network, their rules. Bob
2436	13	528437	5141654	5141623	wein3150	6/1/11 11:32 AM	1.30692792E12	Sure, that's fair	With regards to networks at work. What about Wifi in the public domain. I assume you're saying that, in reality there is no safe place to be totally free of Internet snoopers. This is a disturbing reality I can't seem to shake off. No safe surfing? I don't know....
2436	14	528437	5141666	5141654	R. Proffitt	6/1/11 11:38 AM	1.30692828E12	Safe?	Since the beginning I never trusted wifi open networks you see out there. For years I knew about packet sniffing since I was designing electronics and firmware that did such things. Then meant I would never do much other than read the news on open wifi. And I was very late to accept buying things on the net. And even then I never do so on open wifi. Bob
2436	15	528437	5141667	5141666	wein3150	6/1/11 11:40 AM	1.3069284E12	How about snooping on mobile	phones, Android and iPhones. Are there new generations of hackers waiting to explode onto the scene with claims of having hacked everyones new toys like these?
2436	16	528437	5141680	5141667	R. Proffitt	6/1/11 11:47 AM	1.30692882E12	You mean that GSM base station issue?	http://www.google.com/search?q=The+Baseband+Apocalypse finds it. Years ago when base stations were in the 6 figure price range that made it part of the security &quot;package.&quot; What happened was the protocols and such were not well done and we are beginning to see issues develop. The major players are attempting to fix all this as well as play down concerns. What stops them cold from a solid fix is the millions of handsets and base stations that would have to be changed. Bob
2436	17	528437	5141675	5141680	wein3150	6/1/11 11:55 AM	1.3069293E12	Thanks for that link	This thread is reaching Pluto. Now that the major players have &quot;their&quot; infrastructures in place, seems that the same principles should get their GSM security in place, too. But that would be too costly! Better to make more dough that prevent the apicalypse be reinvesting in better and more bullet proof mobile networks.
2436	18	528437	5350996	5141666	izmirlig	8/23/12 8:47 PM	1.34575482E12	this whole thread has moved off topic	and in the most idiotic way possible. The original question: why can't you just do ssh through the default port over the cellular network? (apologies for shouting but some people are like....really deaf) but SSH IS RSA ENCRIPTED SO THAT PACKET SNOOPER BETTER BE ABLE TO BEAT TMRSA ENCRIPTION AND WADE THROUGH AN AWEFUL LOT OF CRAP TO GET MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER...and oh....wait...my CELLULAR PROVIDER WHICH IS ONE IF THE MOST USCRUPULOUS ******** ON THE PLANET ALRADY HAS MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER, BOB so....you were juzt saying....?
2436	19	528437	5350988	5350996	R. Proffitt	8/23/12 8:53 PM	1.34575518E12	Not just saying.	The conversation did move to security concerns and so it did change from the opening topic. As this is quite an old discussion it is now closed.
