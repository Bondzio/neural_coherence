i have been doing alot of reading about a lcd monitor that i am getting.
going to be used by a graphic artist and my price range is similar at around 400-600. read about the viewsonic and it seems like a good option.
also saw the hp f2105.
anyone have any thoughts on this?
this is for a pc not a mac, otherwise i would likely stretch and get the apple display.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
