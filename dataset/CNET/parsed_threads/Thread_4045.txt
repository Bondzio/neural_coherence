<s> So I've had my computer for about a year now, and after a few upgrades everything has held together quite well. </s>
<s> About a month ago, I was hooking up a GPU fan that I bought and I heard a crackle and seen a blue light flash from where the pins touched on my PSU. </s>
<s> Now I know something bad had to have happened since not too long after that incident my computer failed to boot. </s>
<s> So after a long day of troubleshooting I decided to unplug everything from the computer and turn it on with just the basics. </s>
<s> Only the 20+4 pin and the 4 pin power connecter to the motherboard and it powered on fine. </s>
<s> I plugged my HDD, GPU cooler and front LCD back in and it worked fine. </s>
<s> But now even with just the HDD plugged in it shuts down after a few seconds. </s>
<s> More like a minute or so. </s>
<s> After some searching I found out it's either the MB or the PSU. </s>
<s> Since that incident I figured it's probably the PSU. </s>
<s> So what I'm trying to get at during this rant is which power supply would you recommend? </s>
<s> Or of any others you would recommend. </s>
<s> My budget is about $50 on a gift card I bought for this occasion. </s>
<s> 1st choice: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1147669&amp;body=MAIN 2nd choice: http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-430-Watt-Certified-Compatible-Platforms/dp/B004W2T2TM/ref=sr_1_15?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327541456&amp;sr=1-15 Of course I know that Corsair is well know to have fantastic PSUs but with 11 reviews of DOA or disappointing reviews, I am skeptical. </s>
<s> Any suggestions are welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> the 430w and it's ok. </s>
<s> Stable, cool and reasonably quiet. </s>
<s> Corsair TX are better but out of your price limit unless they go on sale. </s>
<s> A good compromise on price/performance is this http://www.ocztechnology.com/ocz-500w-700w-modxstream-pro-power-supply.html . </s>
<s> Stable, cool, quiet, efficient and MODULAR! </s>
<s> But dual rail. </s>
<s> Frequently goes on sale at Newegg, et al. </s>
<s> With rebate, the 500w can be had for $35. </s>
<s> It saves folk from learning about balancing rails and more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just tried to buy the Ultra on TigerDirect, and the Corsair on Amazon and my gift card was declined. </s>
<s> &gt;.&lt; I looked up that OCZ on newegg and it's 69.99. </s>
<s> I should learn not to be so cheap, but I don't really know if I buy the PSU and it turns out to be the MB that's the problem. </s>
<s> Cheap experiment. </s>
