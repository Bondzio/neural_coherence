<s> I'm looking for recommendations. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Inspiron 5100 notebook with a 15&quot; screen. </s>
<s> To avoid eye strain I run at 800x600, which is severely inadequate for programming in Visual Studio. </s>
<s> I want to attach a 19&quot;-21&quot; LCD, one that is especially good with text. </s>
<s> I do almost nothing with graphics and video. </s>

<s> Oops--I wasn't as clear as I thought in my first message. </s>
<s> I'm looking for recommendations on specific models others have found valuable--19&quot;-21&quot; LCDs that are especially good with displaying text. </s>
<s> Are there others here who work primarily with text, not graphics, and who can recommend screens they like for that? </s>
<s> I thought I saw an article on CNET a week or two ago along these lines, but I cannot find it now. </s>
<s> Thanks, Brian </s>
<s> I'm still using a CRT moose ...Samsung SyncMaster 1100P that works great. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=reviews%2C+LCDs&btnG=Search The PC Magazine link has a number reviews. </s>
<s> You can also see 'buyer' comments on their purchases over at NewEgg.com. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS..Most of the 20&quot; LCDs have a slightly smaller dot pitch than the 19&quot; units. </s>
<s> All, Since I am looking for a large LCD (19-21&quot;) that I will run at non-native resolution (1024 x 768 or possibly 1280 x 1024), will I get better image quality from a screen with more dots per inch? </s>
<s> That is, will smaller dots create crisper text when the text is scaled larger, or would fewer dots per inch be better, since its native resolution would be closer to what I'm using? </s>
<s> Thanks for any thoughts on how this works, Brian </s>
<s> I was at best buy and showed someone what happens when we change the resolution. </s>
<s> No one can assure you it will work so maybe you have to get out and see it? </s>
