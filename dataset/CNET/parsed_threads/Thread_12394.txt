<s> I had a secondary 3.5 IDE hard drive connected to my SATA motherboard using an IDE -&gt;SATA adapter (using Windows XP Home). </s>
<s> All was working fine for about 3 months until my entire PC froze randomly (no mouse movement or anything else). </s>
<s> I restarted my PC, got past the welcome screen, and would have about 10 seconds before my PC froze on me again. </s>
<s> I did multiple restarts with the same result. </s>
<s> When I unhooked the secondary drive, my PC would start up fine. </s>
<s> I bought a real SATA hard drive and replaced the IDE-&gt;SATA one and my PC now works perfectly. </s>
<s> Now here is the real problem. </s>
<s> When I put my old IDE hard drive in an external USB enclosure to get my stuff off of it, Windows will not completely recognize it. </s>
<s> The drive spins up fine and doesnt make any weird noises. </s>
<s> I get the found a new device screen, and then installing drivers, but it wont get past that. </s>
<s> I cannot see it in Disk Management, but I can see it in my Bios as a USB device. </s>
<s> I tried two other PCs (one XP, one Vista), as well as a different enclosure, and the same thing happens. </s>
<s> I have also set the jumpers on the drive to ever combo (including none at all). </s>
<s> I can only think that stupid adapter corrupted my hard drive, but would love to hear some opinions! </s>
<s> Any help would be GREATLY appreciated, thanks! </s>
<s> That's why data recovery companies exists and make money from people who didn't backup everything they didn't want to loose. </s>
