I just downloaded and used `speed fan' because I was concerned with the heat rising from the top of my rig.
A blackbird 002 01b.
The CPU and other temps are at 41c.
The ram is at 75c.
The ram is not liquid cooled and I believe this could be a fatal flaw in the design.
Any ideas on this kind of thing?
Seems like HP/VOODOO did not quite get their homework right.
I could put the dominator ram fans in there, but this should be hp`s responsability.
Thanks
