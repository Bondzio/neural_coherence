Im not sure what the password is. On my routers page the password is encrypted. If I put a password in when I first set it up, I can't remember it. Any Ideas?

If that doesn't work for you, you can press the reset button, setting it back to the factory settings and leave it there. If neither of these 2 suggestions work then you shouldn't have the router in the first place. Nor a computer.

Once you reset the router you need to reconfigure and the configuration would be depend on your Internet Provider.
