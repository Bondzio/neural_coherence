<s> Would like to replace fried AMD processor on my Gateway Select. </s>
<s> Existing processor is most likely an A1400AMS3C type on a Keystone Motherboard #2514316. </s>
<s> Processor is 1400 MHz with 266 MHz data bus DDR. </s>
<s> System runs Windows ME with 128MB 133MHz SDRAM expandable. </s>
<s> I am really just looking for a suitable replacement - not an upgrade or anyhting. </s>
<s> Swap out the old for a working one. </s>
<s> I started looking ( new egg etc. ) </s>
<s> just want to speed up the process. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The 1000MHz unit should work as well so that widens your shopping from 1000 to 1400MHz. </s>
<s> newegg.com and geeks.com have them from time to time. </s>
