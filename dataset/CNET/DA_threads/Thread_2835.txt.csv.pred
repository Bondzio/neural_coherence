1.1.1	I am using a PowerSpec external enclosure with an EIDE 250GB western digital drive and connected via USB 2.0 , on my & quot ; old reliable & quot ; HP pavilion desktop , XP pro SP2 ... always updated .	St
1.1.2	I use synchronization software ( SyncBack ) to help me manage manual back-ups from time to time .	St
1.1.3	Additionally , I store all of my media on the external drive .	St
1.1.4	Recently , especially when I play video files , the drive appears to spontaneously remove itself from Windows ... the PC CRASHES instantly !	St
1.1.5	I have to use a soft reset , and the system seems fine .	St
1.1.6	I have tried several media applications .	St
1.1.7	All with the same outcome .	St
1.1.8	I have checked the system hardware config .	St
1.1.9	All drivers are installed correctly , and all detectable hardware seems to be fully operational .	St
1.1.10	I suspected that my PCI USB 2.0 card may be bad ... so I installed a new one in an open slot yet the problem persists .	St
1.1.11	I would be grateful if anyone has an idea for me to try ...	Polite
1.1.12	I like having all of these large files on my external , but they are n't readily viewable with this happening .	St
1.1.13	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	When I see that I instantly turn to investigating motherboard drivers .	St
1.2.2	Tell me what make , model PC and what version driver you installed .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hello , My machine is an HP pavilion xl946 , AMD Athlon 1.1GHz , 512MB RAM , DVD-rom , DVDR and 2x USB 2.0 PCI cards .	St
1.3.2	It has USB 1.1 fused to the motherboard ... I have no idea about the & quot ; motherboard driver & quot ; nor do I know where to locate it .	St
1.3.3	I will happily retrieve per your instructions .	St
1.3.4	Thank you !	St
1.4.1	http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product ? lc=en & cc=us & dlc=en & product=61888 & We can look at the specs there to discover the & quot ; Chipset name VIA KT133A & quot ; .	St
1.4.2	This makes it easy to look up the Via4in1 driver package which is at http : //www.viaarena.com/default.aspx ? PageID=420 & OSID=1 & CatID=1070 The date of this version is Feb 28 , 2007 and the version is 5.10a This is what I 'd use .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thank you for the helpful links .	St
1.5.2	It seems that all of my drivers were current except for the VIA AGP driver .	St
1.5.3	I had v4.60a now I have 4.80a ...	St
1.5.4	I went through the entire hyperion 4-in-1 installation anyway .	St
1.5.5	Was this the culprit ?	Ques
1.5.6	Nonetheless , I tested by playing several files ( .avi .mp3 .mpg2 .ogm & .wmv ) The system remained stable through each !	St
1.5.7	Hopefully it will remain so ...	St
1.5.8	Thank you !	St
1.6.1	Although media seems to play stably , now it seems that my data transfer rates are poor .	St
1.6.2	I tried to copy an ~800MB file from a USB flash to the external IDE .	St
1.6.3	Both peripherals are connected through the same PCI , and the flash drive is on a 4port powered hub .	St
1.6.4	This transfer would normally take me 3-5min and now it takes 30+ ... almost seems like USB1.1 rather than 2.0 This has me puzzled .	St
1.6.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.6.6	As always , Thank you !	St
1.7.1	Shutting down , moving the PCI card to another slot helps this .	St
1.7.2	There are software methods to do this sort of refresh of the PCI information but I go with this since it 's less work .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	Everything seems back to expected function/performance !	St
1.8.2	802MB transfer in & lt ; 3min ... files still open/play from peripheral drives !	St
1.8.3	Thanks so much !	St
1.8.4	Have a good one , Scott	St
