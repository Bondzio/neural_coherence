I have been looking around online at a bunch of stores, and i found some computers that says the computer has dedicated memory, even though it's an IGP. Is this true? Just wondering, this confused me. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8661575&productCategoryId=abcat0501001&type=product&tab=2&id=1196470438845#productdetail http://www.jr.com/JRProductPage.process?Product=4211044 (You might have to go down to specs/bullet list area to find it. And there are couple other products like this.) I know they could be lieing, but are they telling the truth?

Assuming these DON&quot;T	have VIDEO CARDS, the GPU chip is on the MB and it is most likely using some of the SYSTEM RAM. If the video meets your need and the OS and APPS have enough RAM...min 1GBs, 2GBs recommended, then not a big deal. VAPCMD

Dynamically, when 3d graphics or higher screen resolution demands it' is can take some memory away from the operating system and use it as video memory. It's pretty much exactly what it says it is, and it's usually substantially faster than system memory (for technical reasons that would probably bore you). A 6150 chipset with 128meg (or 64meg) of dedicated video memory will perform substantially better than a 6150 with shared video memory, and have more memory available to the operating system and the running processes.
