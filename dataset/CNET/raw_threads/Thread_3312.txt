The 2nd cartridge has now got empty and I have refilled it with Jet Tec ink, which I have used for many years, but not on this printer. But it will not work! I have been through the cleaning and priming process 5 times now and still no black. Colour is fine. Any suggestions on how to convince it that it does have ink!!! nilocp
