it might be worth trying 'system file checker'.
you will need your xp cd handy (or if on your harddrive as a partition it will find any files itself) click start &gt; run &gt; type cmd press ok. this will bring up a command prompt type in: sfc /scannow (make sure you have a space after sfc) hopefully this should repair or replace any corrupt or missing system files.
