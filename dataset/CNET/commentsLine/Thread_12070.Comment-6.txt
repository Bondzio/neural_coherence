dear jim, amd motherboard is very easily cook up, get icute power supply 400 watts or more is more stable & user friendly to use especially amd.
second change your cooling fan to extremely faster fan such as cooler master or any bigger and expensive type of cooler fan for amd type.
if you enough money get a better ventalation casing like icute that include six fan, it really help to cool down a lot at cpu, motherboard and other parts when switch on.
this is greatest advise for amd case.
