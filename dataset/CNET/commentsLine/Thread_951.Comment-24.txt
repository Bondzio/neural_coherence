meself, my winxp came with fat32 several years ago and i have not elected to change to ntfs.
mainly because my grandkids and myself do a lot of gaming on my winxp and the high tech 'gaming' experts suggest staying with fat32.
here is what they say: &quot;windows xp supports fat32 and ntfs (nt file system), but choose these carefully.
ntfs is a more powerful file system that can support huge drive sizes with encryption and compression, but it's intended for business users who need to limit access on a drive based on user accounts and who employ advanced network features like active directory.
there are no notable disk speed advantages of ntfs over fat32, so if you're gaming on a home pc, stick with fat32.&quot; have never had a problem with fat32.
