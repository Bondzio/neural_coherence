vista gpu: you'll need direct x9.0 h/w support in the GPU.
on the ATI side, the radeon x800/x1800/x1900 series with at least 128MB of RAM will be sufficient.
256MB will be better.
i would avoid radeon x1300s.
for nVidia, geforce 6000/7000 series with 128MB of RAM is needed.
i would avoid the 6200s and 7300s.
PATA drives: your PATA 'ports' on the mobo each support two drives with the proper cable, so 2 PATA channels support 4 drives.
retail drives usually come with the proper cables.
put the HD on the primary (typically IDE 0) port, and the DVDs can share the secondary port.
