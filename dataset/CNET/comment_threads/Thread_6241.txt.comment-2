I guess I'd better add that neither the connection repair nor the adapter repair functions on XP were successful.
I was online with my ISP tech support for about 2 hours (surprise, they were Canadian) I keep getting an error message saying there's limited or no access.
I guess I'm looking for a fix on the automatically accept IP and DNS addresses problem.
Thanks again Rich
