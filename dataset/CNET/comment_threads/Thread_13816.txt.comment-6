The Power Supply.
While I can't say your problems will go away by simply replacing the PSU, if you plan on upgrading your PC a properly rated PSU is a must.
Others will say their system is running fine on insufficient power....it is only a matter of time.
Your boot problems, I believe, are due to the card itself or flaky drivers.
Drivers not uninstalled before changing cards or out of date drivers can cause your ills.
ATI has been known for iffy drivers.
Install drivers from the CD?
I'd go to the site and get the most current.
Wish you luck, Tom
