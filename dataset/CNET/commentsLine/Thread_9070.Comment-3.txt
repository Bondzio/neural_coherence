this is the only one (+ide dvd writer) and the pc is ready made so not i build it, thats mean if i open it (to change the jumper) i will lose the warranty... but who cares i took off the warranty vignette(of course very carefully so i can replace haha :d) and removed the jumper .
ok motherboard supports 3gb/s as its sata ii and the harddisk also supports 3gb/s but change is resulted with no speed incrase and xp become very unstable (blue screen of death several times) i reinstalled the mother chipset drivers with original ones.
if i can understand you its not good that my drive is on udma5 .. but the bios says its on udma6 so i've reinstalled de ide drives in device manager (deleted first ide channel and restarted) but it's stucked on udma5.. what can i do?
