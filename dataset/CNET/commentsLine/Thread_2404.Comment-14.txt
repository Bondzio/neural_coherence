not all oses will work with such a change.
windows 95 being one i tried that (by accident) and there is no known cure.
maybe it would be a better idea if you entertained using a boot or os manager.
then you can install many os and let the boot/os manager deal with the issues.
your current machine is a compaq and you are limited to bios boot selection that compaq gives you or you may be limiting yourself by not contacting mrbios.
as an embedded electronics designer, i know this design very well and have used various dos/windows as quick solutions.
these pc based systems were made for general usage and as such, when you depart too far, the answer is not exactly what you may want.
i noted that my newer (now dated) machine has a boot from device menu.
it's a nifty feature so you don't have to change the bios to floppy/cd/other drives.
compaq (now hp) is unlikely to implement this in consumer machines since the best/cheapest solution is to automate the entire deal so to reduce support and maintenance costs.
best of luck, bob
