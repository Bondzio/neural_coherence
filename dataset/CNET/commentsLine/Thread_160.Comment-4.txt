now find a fan to point at the open machine.
does it run even longer?
if so, there can be a cooling issue or some part has become heat sensitive.
there are also cases where the power supply has aged and we fit a new bigger one.
but the exact item to replace hasn't been found yet.
try a big fan... bob
