I have some money to blow and want to know what the bottleneck in my computer is.
i have windows vista 32bit home premium.
Nvidia Geforce 8800GT graphics card.
(not sure of sound card.)
Super Multi DVD+RW DL w/Labelflash 4 Gigs of DDR2 Dual-Channel Ram, AMD Phenom 9600 quad processor, 500 gig hard disk.
I myself cannot see an obvious choice so I was woundering if any of you had an opinion.
