<s> Recently I was curious about getting more RAM for my computer but I didn't know which I had to buy in order to make my computer faster. </s>
<s> So I decided to open up the computer and take out the RAM to see what type it was. </s>
<s> After placing it back into the memory slot (pretty secure and in place) I turned on my computer again, only to find out that the monitor had no screen except for the &quot;Self-Test&quot; display, and after 25 seconds, a long beep occurs, then stops and repeats it self in the same process. </s>
<s> Any idea's what's going on? </s>
<s> Specs: - Asus P4SGX-MX motherboard - 128mb GeForce MX4000 - 256mb DDR PC-2100 </s>

<s> I tried replacing my memory, and now I get this long beep when I turn on my computer. </s>
