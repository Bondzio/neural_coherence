my main computer, that i use daily for heavy multitasking work, gaming, watching movies, and more, is not what you'd expect.
i use a $249 black friday el cheapo acer laptop sitting in my desk's keyboard tray.
i then have an external keyboard, mouse, speakers, webcam, headset, camera dock, usb hub, and a 23.6&quot; hd lcd monitor.
i am just as productive on this computer as my wife is with a core i7-920 desktop housing an ati hd4890 video card.
sure i can't play gta iv on my setup (why do you think i got her a 4890 card?)
but i can do everything else.
i play gta san andreas for example.
need for speed games up through and including carbon run nice and smooth at high resolution.
i can play the first far cry.
i can play left for dead 1 and 2. it's not a gaming powerhouse but it's very solid.
the graphics set in my laptop is the latest integrated intel hd graphics.
it's standard with most cheap laptops and desktops these days.
this is called the 4500mhd (mobile version, hd) and it's awesome.
i run my monitor at 1920x1080 all the time.
i don't make it smaller for games if i can help it (gta:sa tops out at 1440x900 for playable fps).
i can have two broswer windows open side by side or say, a word file and an excel file.
the computer doesn't slow down appreciably even with multiple programs running.
i'm looking at the costco el cheapo windows 7 hp pcs now.
if you're looking at the same celeron 450 box i am, pass on it.
get something with a dual core processor.
in fact if you must buy from costco and you must have hp, go for the $699 p6570t model with the core i3-540 processor.
that will have more power than you need for quite awhile and it has the desktop version of my intel hd graphics set.
the $499 model with the celeron 450 single-core chip will frustrate you beyond belief.
the first thing i did with this $249 laptop was remove the celeron 900 (mobile version of the celeron 450) and replace it with a pentium dual-core t4300 chip.
that and a 3rd gb of memory have really awakened this laptop.
i still get about 2 hours on battery but i hardly ever have it not plugged in.
if you get the celeron model, you will be disappointed.
at least get something with a dual-core pentium, like the $599 model with the pentium e5400 processor.
the other $499 computers showing at costco have 6150se or hd4200 graphics.
both of those will also disappoint you.
stick to the intel hd for now or be prepared to buy a video card much sooner.
