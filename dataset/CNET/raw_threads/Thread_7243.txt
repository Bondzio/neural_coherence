I purchased and installed a WD hard drive a couple weeks ago, and ever since, I've been getting the &quot;SMART Failure Predicted on Primary Slave&quot; message on each startup. Also, each time I restart, I receive a &quot;Disk Boot Failure, Insert System Disk and Press Enter&quot; message. From this point I must shut down and reboot. The drive appears to work, and I'm able to store data on it, but I constantly get the above errors. I ran Norton's Disk Doctor, but it always froze while it reallocated bad sectors. I realize something is wrong, but I'm not sure what. Has anyone experienced this type of problem before? Suggestions? Is it possible that my hard drive is simply bad right out of the package? Or could there be another problem such as bad connections, software installation problem, etc? I'm not too familiar with BIOS, etc, so any tips catered to a novice would be greatly appreciated. For the record, I'm running a 900mhz P3 with Windows ME. Thanks.

WD has a drive fitness test (goodbye data on said drive!) to test if there is an issue. And they'll replace the drive if it fails (under warranty.) There were some badly implemented BIOS that would give a false indication, but that is rare in the population of PCs. You've received your warning, so no one will give much sympathy if the drive now fails and takes with it some files you can't lose. I'd get the drive fitness test done and check for BIOS updates.
