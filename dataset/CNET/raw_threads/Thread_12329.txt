Everything is up and running except for when I restart and laptop with wireless connections I get the IP Address conflict popup on my computers. I am setup with Static IP addresses and am positive there are no duplicate nodes. The laptop will connect in the morning fine but if I restart the laptop it conflicts. Looking for alittle advice if there is a function of the wireless that would hold the address looking for the old connection and not refresh with the new connection? network still works fine and I am able to access and my data but the popup is an annoyance and I think it is messing with my wireless printers when they go into standby and conflicting connections.

If you are using anything less than WPA security then I see many rogue users (see SMAC and other tools like it) can hijack what an admin may think was a reserved IP. After the IT staff gets a little more seasoned they return to DHCP and WPA to avoid all the lost hours. Bob

I need to keep static IP's due to my process scope. pinging the IP's all timeout as soon as I turn off the laptops so there is nothing on that IP. Any other sugestions? I will tighten up and change security and see if this helps but I am only seeing my computers on my Domain with no other traffic. Thanks
