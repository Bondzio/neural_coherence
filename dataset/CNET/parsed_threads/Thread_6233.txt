<s> Recently I decided to build my own computer so I went to the library and got a PC book... </s>
<s> It's a couple of years old but I figired that was ok because I only wanted to become more knowledgable about computer hardware and a few other things. </s>
<s> Anyway, in this book the author was talking about AGP cards and that they are much faster than PCI. </s>
<s> I just got to wondering if anybody uses AGP now that PCIe has come out... </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I'm using AGP but PCIe is faster. </s>
<s> If you're building a computer get a mobo with PCIe. </s>
<s> Most new cards are designed for PCIe </s>
<s> the mobo determine that. </s>
<s> Many folks use AGP today and they will tomorrow. </s>
<s> If your a serious gamer get a mobo with pci-e, it's the way the industry is going. </s>
<s> BTW. </s>
<s> Check out SATA, it's the way the industry is going but still some what of a headache. </s>
<s> I was disappointed with sata when I fist tried it because of the messy drivers for it. </s>
<s> IDE is still much easier. </s>
<s> I have a new AGP mobo because I couldnt afford to upgrade my vid card at the same time. </s>
<s> I regret it. </s>
<s> PCIe video cards are much cheaper for performance than AGP. </s>
<s> However because PCIe is taking over, you should be able to make a really nice budget agp system that will handle older games like counter strike source on low settings and anything older than that on high settings. </s>
<s> The m\b I'm gonna get for my first build has SATA 2, and one 16x PCIe slot. </s>
<s> Now... </s>
<s> I know it has SATA 2... </s>
<s> But would somebody PLEASE explain to me why that is good...lol </s>
<s> I am currently running a file server with an agp card. </s>
<s> It's a NVIDIA eVGA e-geforce 6200. </s>
<s> If your building a new rig, I suggest pci-e just for the future upgradablity. </s>
<s> But, if you want to save an old agp card, stick with it. </s>
<s> It's still not obsolite. </s>
<s> Good luck and have fun! </s>
<s> SATA II has faster transfer rates and buffer than SATA-150. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure that if you gonna use SATAII, the hard drive better say is has 3.0gb/s transfer rate. </s>
<s> If you use a normal SATA150 on SATA II, it will work a SATA150 speeds. </s>
<s> I thought it would be something like... </s>
<s> Cause I'm only 15 and have just recently started getting heavy into computers... </s>
<s> So I guess the peak of AGP was before my time... </s>
<s> (I'm younger than you.) </s>
<s> If you want AGP, get it </s>
<s> Because if you ever want to upgrade, you'll need a new mobo. </s>
<s> You'll regret it when all the new cards are for PCIe. </s>
<s> i dont have agp i have pci anyway of adapting PCIe to regular PCI? </s>
<s> Most motherboards sold now have an AGP slot and a PCIe slot. </s>
<s> So you can have an AGP card for now, and when you want to upgrade, migrate to a PCIe card. </s>
<s> Why would you still want an AGP card? </s>
<s> The only reason I see is cheaper price. </s>
<s> All the latest technology is for PCIe, but if you don't need the latest and greatest, you can save yourself a little bit of money. </s>
<s> Radeon 9600s are pretty cheap nowadays. </s>
<s> &quot;Most motherboards sold now have an AGP slot and a PCIe slot.&quot; I have only seen a few of those models that have both AGP and PCI Express X16. </s>
