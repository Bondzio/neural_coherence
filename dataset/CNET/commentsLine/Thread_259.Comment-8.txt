&quot;what is an interview?
what is a usb hard disk what is acronis?&quot; are all at your fingertips at google and other sites.
we have however dropped big hints that the root cause of your issue (no cd/dvd drives) could be a simple issue to fix.
however you haven't written enough about that for us to say &quot;try this.&quot; why not tell about your issue and let's fix that?
---------------------break------------------------ &quot;i talked to the guys from dell last night and i asked if i could install windows on a scsi drive, but i just realized i don't know how to do that.
he said that would work, i.e., installing windows on the external drive, copying the computer drive using pc relocater, format the drive and then using pcr again from the external drive to the computer.&quot; i agree that should work too, but &quot;how to install windows&quot; is another topic i don't discuss.
why?
there are thousands of web sites about that and fine books.
no need to duplicate effort here.
i'll stick to the more oddball issues and try to help people dodge a reinstall.
