what you are saying is, it reads most cds, and not certain dvds.
i noticed you said the disks are fine, not &quot;many&quot; scratches.
dvds are a fussy disk.
i have many dvds and let me say, one scratch in the wrong spot will keep it from playing in my dvd drives as well, or takes a few times to open them.
some drives will play a scratched dvd while others can be a bit more fussy.
most of my old cds that are scratched badly , still play with ease.
this has to do with the format of the disk also.
since the format of a dvd is (well, let's just say more condensed for now) it is also vulnerable to lighter scratches as the laser spreads even a bit and is unfocused, the dvd will skip, not play right away, or at all.
cds are not so(once again just for purpose sake) condensed and have a slightly better range for margin of error.
this is currently my take on your problem but others may have another idea.
i just feel if it was in fact the player, it wouldn't work at all.
also, it may be the software you use.
some won't play certain regions as to where some play more.
this is my take on it.
others may have other suggestions but i do feel this is what's happening.
take care, paul
