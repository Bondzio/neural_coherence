There is a video on youtube of someone with the mouse: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1YWeL0w_tQ Also, on the Gigabyte UK website it says it has been released, However, only one of the three shops they say it is available in actually sell it and they are a distributor which means they are trade only.
