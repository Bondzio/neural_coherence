I made a typo above.
I meant to write &quot;It does NOT mean the sticks are bad.&quot; What a difference when I drop one word.
That extra info helps a little but only in that I would try it with one stick at a time and move it from slot to slot till it boots.
With 512MB and 11MB given up for the onboard video this should boot slowly.
I see nothing wrong with such as low memory machine running vista to run incredibly slow.
