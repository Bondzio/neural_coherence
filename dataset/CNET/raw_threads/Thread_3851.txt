I am on an older Dell Desktop that does not have high speed USB 2.0 A lot of the External Hard Drives I see have 2.0 in the name. For example a random google says &quot;Toshiba's 400GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive&quot;. Does this mean it has to have a 2.0 drive to work? Secondly I am almost exclusively going to be storing music on this hard drive as a means of moving around my growing music collection. Will moving music onto the hard drive and possibly back onto another computer degrade the quality of the track? And lastly if anyone could make recommendation for a good external hard drive that will work for my needs and computer it would be much appreciated. I am running Windows XP and Service pack 2, not a terribly old computer by some standards, it just does not have a 2.0 highspeed USB slot. Thank you again for any help!

Might consider getting a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed PCI card for your Dell to take greater advantage of the USB 2.0 speed (480Kbps) over the older USB speed (40Kbps). The difference is significant ...even if you're not doing it for profit. Just keep in mind...it's never ever safe to keep the only copy of your family photos, music, or anything else you cannot afford to lose or easily replace on a single hard disk drive. It can die, take a voltage spike, or succumb to a virus in an instant. Re recommendations...if you buy retail (a fully assembled external enclosure with a hard drive installed)...I recommend Seagate or Western Digital. If you build your own...buy an enclosure and a hard drive of choice..I'd pick Seagate or Western Digital drive and a brand name, quality enclosure. The difference... most Seagate and WD drive have 5 year and 3 year warranties respectively. Most retail HDDs I see have one year warranties. Good Luck VAPCMD

My only other issue is the question about will storing music on an external hard drive degrade the quality of the music file if I was to move it between computers using the hard drive. From what I have read and gathered it does not but I just wanted to ask to be sure as these things are not my expertise. I planned to just copy My Music folder onto an External drive for a bit of extra protection as my collection is becoming large. Thank you once again for your insight.

Thank you for the reply, so from what I gather you are saying a 2.0 drive will work with my computer I will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds I could be if I had a 2.0 usb correct? Quick answer...&quot;YES&quot; But keep in mind mind...&quot;USB&quot; is the interface standard between the external HDD enclosure and the PC.... it has nothing to do with the drive itself. Even faster is the eSATA interface and for future use...it's faster than USB 2.0. If possible ...get an external with USB 2.0 and eSATA. VAPCMD
