I would write about routing, forward but both 192.x.x.x and 10.x.x.x are non-internet addresses.
Something is not right here.
Or you changed an address to not reveal your internet address.
While you could have just written &quot;internet address&quot; and your lan range is 192.x.x.x your post is such that it's dead.
I can't see how this would ever work.
