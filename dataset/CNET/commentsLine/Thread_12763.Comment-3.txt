the instruction portion of the manual is just a series of pictures, and it didn't say anything about using a heatsink compound - there's no text to that effect, it's not represented in the pictures and no compound was provided in the packaging.
1) are you certain this is the problem?
2) have i done damage to the cpu, permanent or temporary?
3) once i put the compound on, will i be able to take the heatsink off again... is it like glue?
i ask this because i've taken the heatsink off about three times to make various connections in areas that i couldn't access when the heatsink was in place.
i apologize about my ignorance.
thank you very much for the help.
i'm off to buy a heatsink compound.
i'll look for your response when i return.
