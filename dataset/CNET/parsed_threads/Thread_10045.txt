<s> I've been waiting for any sign of a release date for the Aivia Xenon mouse/track pad from Gigabyte or if it's been scrapped. </s>
<s> Could somebody shed some light on this? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> There is a video on youtube of someone with the mouse: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1YWeL0w_tQ Also, on the Gigabyte UK website it says it has been released, However, only one of the three shops they say it is available in actually sell it and they are a distributor which means they are trade only. </s>
<s> I hoped this helped jhb019 </s>
<s> Thanks that helps....I need this mouse!! </s>
