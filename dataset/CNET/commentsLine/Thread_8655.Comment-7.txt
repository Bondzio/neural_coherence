i find a good external case, aluminum for heat dissipation, and with a fan.
then i add a seagate pmr (perpendicular magnet recording) drive, my latest is a seagate 450 gig pmr drive.
pmr because it's faster than the lineal recording drives.
all my other internal drives in my three pcs have been upgraded to seagate pmrs.
i don't like the complete drives because of the extra bells and whistles that can cause problems.
i just use the drive as a temporary backup.
every so often i burn my backups to dvd media.
pmr speed, as my own tests.
i download video files ranging from 800 mb to 1 gig in size, and move them to my home server for storage.
with my old seagate lmr drives a one gig video file across my gigabit network would take between two and three minutes.
since i have upgraded all my drives to pmr, the same size file takes 45 seconds or less.
'nuff said about pmr.
