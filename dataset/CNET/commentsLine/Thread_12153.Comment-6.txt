seagate will provide the needed s/w i mentioned if you buy the retail &quot;hd kit&quot;, if not again they have it at their support website, probably adonis based.
also, if current setup is 2 hds mounted, you maybe better off having &quot;two only&quot; one being the new hd and the old &quot;c&quot; primary drive.
using the s/w will provide all you need to get things going.
i mention 2 drives only so disconnect(or remove for the time being the old 2nd hd).
once that's all done, remove old &quot;c&quot; drive and then mount new &quot;c&quot; as primary drive as well as the old 2nd drive.
if all is done properly it should boot as if nothing happened, but with a new spacious hd.
seagate has instruction, faq or guide for all this, just be sure to back-up critical or all data for safekeeping beforehand.
take your time and enjoy your coffee of soda as well.
