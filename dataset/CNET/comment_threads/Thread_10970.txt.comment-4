This is mostly a consumer forum, with consumer questions about home networks and routers.
It's not a forum for professionals writing embedded software or drivers.
They have books, courses, training sessions, exams, more experienced colleagues, access to the defining standards, equipment to monitor the data flowing through the network, can read open source code and things like that.
