1.1.1	I am building a computer for the first time.	St
1.1.2	So far have decided: OS:Windows XP CPU:Intel Core 2 Duo E6700 Do I need to decide on chipsets now before choosing the motherboard?	St
1.1.3	Do I need to know what RAM first?	St
1.1.4	(I think 2GB DDR2 but don't know more yet, would also like to add more later) HDD will be either WD or Seagate SATA 250-500GB dependent on $ (not sure if you need to know this) Would like to add another HDD later (do I need RAID?)	St
1.1.5	Will need PCIE for sound card This is not for gaming just music production/sound engineering so basic graphics ok. Will not be used on internet or LAN.	St
1.1.6	Asus P5K seems popular but there are many different varieties.	St
1.1.7	Which one?	St
1.1.8	Thankyou, Anna	St
1.2.1	e6750 is about $205USD compared to $300USD for e6700: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005522 go with 2gb right off the bat since it's so inexpensive.	St
1.2.2	ocz gold ddr2-800, 2gb kit, $90 before $30 rebate: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=85236 the asus p5k motherboard series is a good choice as is the gigabyte ga-p35-ds series.	St
1.2.3	both have mobos in the $125-$150 range depending on features.	St
1.2.4	but if you don't need advanced 3d graphics, this gigabyte ga-g33m-s2 has the latest intel chipset, onboard graphics, the features that most people actually use, and is only $118: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10006319 hard drive wise, 320gb and 500gb are the 'sweet spots': 250gb: $67 320gb: $75 ($8 for additional 70gb) 400gb: $100 500gb: $108 ($8 for additional 100gb) raid is a matter of preference.	St
1.3.1	If you are talking production, I believe you want to invest in RAID so you do not lose the music you produced because of disk failure that can happen just from random bad luck or heat.	St
1.3.2	Writing steady streams of digitized music, and read/write of large chunks of digitized music during audio editing can heat up a drive fast.	St
1.3.3	Everything you are buying is for creating the music.	St
1.3.4	It's the only valuable stuff.	St
1.3.5	Raid-5 starts with 3 HDDs; Raid-10 starts with 4.	St
1.3.6	Gets expensive!	St
1.3.7	However, I just read about the Data Robotics Drobo that provides the same protection as Raid-5 but starts with only two HDDs.	St
1.3.8	You can read about it on this PC World link.. http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134339/article.html Cost of this box is pretty competitive.	St
1.3.9	Check it out.	St
1.4.1	Thankyou for the suggestions Drobo does sound really great and simple actually, and reliability is the biggest concern for me.	St
1.4.2	Is there anything stopping me just getting say a 320GB internal HDD now, then buying a Drobo a bit later on and another HDD and transferring the first one to the Drobo (when I have the $, and when prices down a bit)?	St
1.4.3	I am in NZ and am having trouble even finding a NZ price/seller for Drobo, and not sure whether it would be any cheaper to order things from US after shipping and tax included.	St
1.4.4	Also, if did do as I mentioned above (say use one HDD for a few months) would the kind of setup we are talking about be at much risk of overheating problems if in a regular sized box (mid-tower?)?	St
1.4.5	Would moving to the Drobo setup eliminate a lot of heating issues?	St
1.4.6	Thankyou again for your help, it is greatly appreciated!	St
1.4.7	Anna	St
1.5.1	Just checked out pricing, and will definitely choose the E6750 thankyou ramarc.	St
1.5.2	Also the gigabyte ga-g33m-s2 is mATX - which I am thinking means it is smaller than regular ATX?	St
1.5.3	Why not just ATX?	St
1.5.4	Would it make a difference in terms of heat?	St
1.5.5	Thankyou, Anna	St
1.6.1	mATX is microATX.	St
1.6.2	bigger boards are usually more expensive to manufacture so many desktop boards are now microATX.	St
1.6.3	microATX mobos still have the features that most people use (8 usb, firewire, 4 sata ports, 8 channel sound, etc)... full size ATX boards usually add things like on-board wi-fi, additional sata/ide ports, dual ethernet nics, dual graphics slots, etc.	St
1.6.4	if you're interested in raid, the GA-G33M-DS2R (the next step up) has raid support built-in.	St
1.6.5	all you need is add a second hard drive.	St
1.6.6	the DS2R uses intel matrix raid which allows you mix raid levels without only 2 drives.	St
1.6.7	so for $210 (dual 500gb drives) you could have a mirrored (raid-1) 200gb boot drive to store the OS and important files (e.g.	St
1.6.8	final masters), and striped (raid-0) 550gb to house the pagefile, temp/scratch areas, and work-in-progress.	St
1.6.9	GA-G33M-DS2R, $142: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005399&ref=lmcd	St
