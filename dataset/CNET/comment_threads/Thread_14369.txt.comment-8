After all this time, I wanted to let you know what happened.
Basically, everything failed.
The first Socket 462 motherboard wouldn't fire up, although the power supply came on.
A friend gave us another one, never removed from the box ... and the power supply wouldn't even come on.
So I'm giving up.
Repairing this computer is obviously a money pit, and no one seems to be able to diagnose just what is wrong with it.
I'll probably buy another barebones kit from Tiger Direct, although I'm so bitter about this, my third consecutive faulty computer, that I may not buy another one.
Anyway, thank you for your assistance.
