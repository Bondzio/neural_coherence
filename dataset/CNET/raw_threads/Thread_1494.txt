I disconnect network from the internet when not on line by turning the external cable modem off on the box the cable co. installed. After I turn the box back on the router must &quot;repair&quot; the connection. Is there a check box or something else I can do that would simplify this? Please make answer for wireless impaired person. Thanks Jan

On another machine I have ZONE ALARM (a free firewall) which has a setting to effectively block all network traffic essentially turning off the internet. Does that help? Bob
