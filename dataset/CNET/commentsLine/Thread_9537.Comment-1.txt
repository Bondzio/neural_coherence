i am running an emachines 1840 desktop pc pre loaded with windows 7, a 500gb hdd &amp; 64bit dual core processor &amp; 3gb of ram, it is also fitted with an aftermarket asus 5054 1gb graphics card, the onboard graphics card couldn't even cope with some of the supplied games!!!
the system will not run ms flt sim x deluxe or any other flt sims i have, even in compatability mode, so i wouild like to know if i can fit my old 160 gb hdd from my previous pc (a maxdata 3000 mob favorit) as a slave, or to be able to boot-up from, that has xp home edition, loaded &amp; all my flt sims but was only a 32 bit system, &lt;div&gt; i bought the emachines 1840 in january 2011 &amp; it has been returned twice due to faulty hdd's ?
&lt;/div&gt;
