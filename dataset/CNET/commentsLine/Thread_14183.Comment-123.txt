the introduction of technology has presented challenges for museums.
can you imagine on sound/video alone how many devices will need to be available to read/play the material?
take sound starting with the edison wax cylinder,16,33 1/3,78(?
)and 45 rpm records, reel to reel(mono and multitrack), cassette, 8 track,cd, mini cd and dvd.
how many watch/clock repair or shoe repair are there around these days?
going the way of the returnable milk bottle and beer bottle.
