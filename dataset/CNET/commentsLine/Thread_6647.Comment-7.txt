i read recently in pc magazine that amd is challenging the power consumption measurement techniques that show amd to have higher usage.
let's say the power comsumption isn't an issue.
let's say that &quot;clock for clock&quot;intel beats the amd.
but what about &quot;dollar per dollar&quot;?
if the amd machine is around $100 less you can get a faster amd processor which is what should be used in any comparison.
