<s> Hello all, I just purchased a Buffalo Linkstation 250gb NAS, and one of my machines cannot map the drive. </s>
<s> I connected it to my D-Link Wireless Router and installed it without an issue. </s>
<s> My laptop -also running Win XP pro- can see and map the drive. </s>
<s> (whether wired or wireless!) </s>
<s> My desiktop cannot map the drive. </s>
<s> The software included with the drive runs and shows the drive and the IP address. </s>
<s> I can log-on to the drive via a browser and change any setting. </s>
<s> But, when I Select Run from the Start Menu and type in \\BIGDRIVE and press enter .. </s>
<s> I get &quot;The Network Path was not found&quot; I tried searching for the drive, but it was not found! </s>
<s> I called Buffalo tech support and they said it was a Windows problem and I should unmap any other drives and then map this one first. </s>
<s> I disconnected my card reader because that occupies drive letters, and even uninstalled my iomega zip drive, but it didn't work. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>

<s> Hi, I have EXACTLY the same problem.. Any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> But let's share how windows finds \\BIGDRIVE. </s>
<s> Windows has to resolve that name to some IP address. </s>
<s> Sadly there is no detail about how you set up Windows to resolve names to addresses. </s>
<s> But you could find the IP address of said drive and try... \\192.168.0.101 instead but use the IP of BIGDRIVE. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll do my best to explain. </s>
<s> I spoke to a networking person I know and they said the problem was with the way I initially setup my home network. </s>
<s> My desktop computer was initially setup without a router. </s>
<s> A direct connect to the cable modem. </s>
<s> When I later added a router, everything seemed to work fine. </s>
<s> I did, however, have trouble seeing other computers and drives on the desktop machine. </s>
<s> I worked around this by accessing the desktop from the other computers. </s>
<s> I should have paid more attention to this problem because it was an indication that my network was in a somewhat limited configuration. </s>
<s> This is the part I do not explain too well... </s>
<s> If I ran IPCONFIG from the command prompt, it would show 192.168.0.0 as the IP address of my computer. </s>
<s> But the router's IP address was also 192.168.0.0. </s>
<s> I am not sure how this happened, but it had something to do with the initial configuration (before the router). </s>
<s> When I added \\BIGDRIVE to the router, it grabbed an IP address and was only visible to other, newer machines added to the router. </s>
<s> The desktop could not see it. </s>
<s> WHAT I DID TO FIX IT: I forced the IP address of the router up to another number: 192.168.0.1 Made sure the desktop was another number: 192.168.0.150 Also, I made sure that \\BIGDRIVE was yet another number: 192.168.0.101. </s>
<s> After that (and a number of restarts of the desktop, router and \\BIGDRIVE, and suddenly everything was available. </s>
<s> I hope my somewhat weak explanation helps! </s>
<s> Terry </s>
<s> Thx for the posts. </s>
<s> However, I've tried IP Changes... Treid \\IP address of my Linkstation....Any other ideas that may help?.. </s>
<s> Oh, and I checked to ensure I was running the correct firmware.. i.e 2.05...? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> http://www.windowsitpro.com/Article/ArticleID/43166/43166.html notes the 3 ways Windows can resolve a name to an IP address. </s>
<s> If you combine this article with the fact that many install a firewall you see a recipe for lookup failures. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I had a similar problem. </s>
<s> My Linkstation is plugged into a Linksys switch. </s>
<s> I could ping it and open the configuration page through a web browser. </s>
<s> But when I typed \\Linkstation, I got the message 'network path not found'. </s>
<s> Buffalo tech support asked me to turn off my Firewall (I Use Norton) temporarily and retry. </s>
<s> I was then able to access the drive. </s>
<s> I then entered the IP address for the Linkstation in the trusted site tab in Norton and turned the firewall back on. </s>
<s> I have not had problems since. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> I'm experiencing the same problem that others have noted here ie when I try to access my Buffalo LinkStation 250gb network drive, I get the dreaded &quot;the network path was not found&quot; message. </s>
<s> What's so frustrating is that my LinkStation has been installed and working on the same system for over a year, no real problems. </s>
<s> This problem just cropped up in the past week or so. </s>
<s> I'm able to access all the drive settings via the web interface, and the IP Configuration Utility immediately scans and finds the drive. </s>
<s> I've received a couple of responsed from Buffalo Tech Support, but none of their suggestions has worked for me so far. </s>
<s> I'm running XPMCE on a Dell 8400, cable modem. </s>
<s> My LinkStation is attached to a D-Link 614 wireless router. </s>
<s> So far I have tried: * using the \\IP method to address the drive * manually changing the IP address to a fixed value * disabling firewall software (Sygate) * disabling AV (Norton v2005) * disabling Windows Defender * renaming the drive * runing the disk scan/repair utility * moving the LinkStation away from other equipment * removing/reinstalling Client for MS Networks and File and Printer Sharing * Changing the TCP/IP WIN/Advanced setting to Enable NetBIOS I use the drive mainly as a backup source, and I don't think there is too much on there that would be lost, but not having the frequent (nightly) backups of my essential data files is causing me concern. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> After the 3rd round of communications from Buffalo tech support I arrived at the following solution: I turned FTP filesharing on in the Linkstation and was able to access my data folders one at a time using an explorer window and the address ftp:// &lt;ip address&gt;. </s>
<s> Using this method, I backed them up to my HD. </s>
<s> (took some time) I installed an updated firmware file (v1.47) from the Buffalo tech support website using the &quot; /force&quot; install parameter. </s>
<s> (this also took some time). </s>
<s> My original files were intact after this process was completed. </s>
<s> After this was done, everything was working as it should be. </s>
<s> Apparently, the binary files somehow were corrupted. </s>
<s> I just wish I knew how/why this happened so it could be avoided in the future. </s>
<s> The LinkStation lives a sheltered life, in a place where it doesn't receive any bumps, and is powered by a filtered, battery backed UPS of considerable capacity. </s>
