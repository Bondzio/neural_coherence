I got screwed AFTER I purchased mine.
CD drive failed 2 days later.
Dell's outsourced support is indeed a joke, not only they don't speak English, they are generally inept and extremely rude.
I've been hung upon numerouse times just to get an RMA to return the CD drive.
I can't wait for class action lawsuit to end this BS once and for all.
