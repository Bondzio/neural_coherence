<s> If Cd's and DVD's have a shelf life, which appears to be the case, is it more secure to store data and photos on usb flash drive memory? </s>
<s> $9 for 8GB vs. 200GB? </s>
<s> no contest. </s>
<s> My thought ..... USB flash drives are much less secure or reliable compared to CD or DVDs. </s>
<s> How permanent, secure or immune to failure do you think USB Flash Drives are ? </s>
<s> Are you asking about this in the context of primary storage ? </s>

<s> Thanks for your thoughts. </s>
<s> Not primary storage at all. </s>
<s> Purely backup. </s>
<s> I had better stick to cd's and dvd's! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Are you comparing the cost of a usb drive to buying dvd's? </s>
<s> But really do you want to back up 200gb of data onto 40 dvd's (at 4.7Gb per disk). </s>
<s> It takes about 15 minutes (on my dvd in a laptop, it is 5 years old). </s>
<s> So 15 x 40 = a lot of time vs. just drag and drop walk away and come back it is done. </s>
<s> - also you would need rewritable dvd's if you want to update the data. </s>
<s> - also how do you verify that the data is not lost through wear and tear, are you going to test 40 dvd's. </s>
<s> That sounds like a really bad idea It sounds a like a much better idea to have two external hard drives, you can buy a 1terabyte drive for about 120$, back up your data that way. </s>
