Thanks Bill i did just what you siad and it worked out.
but was surprised when i booted up that a blurry section on my monitor was gone.
I originally thought that this was an integrated graphics card problem and was planning to replace it with a PCI-E one.
Could anyone tell me how this happened?
and how to prevent it in the future?
Yes i did try to update the driver.
My monitor is a 19&quot; LG Flatron (L1917S).
and my graphics card is an intel integrated graphics accelerator.
Thanks
