<s> Hi, I have an HP Pavilion 8760C, 733 mhz processor. </s>
<s> I purchased it back in August 2000 (yep, it's an oldie and a slow one at that!). </s>
<s> In June 2004, the original hard drive failed. </s>
<s> I took it to a local computer repair shop, which told me that the drive was unsalvagable. </s>
<s> I replaced it with a Maxtor hard drive and updated the RAM. </s>
<s> I also upgraded from Win 98 to Win Xp sometime in 2003 or 2004. </s>
<s> It's been running fine--nothing fast or special, but it was getting the job done as our printing station, word processor, quick email station, etc (my husband and I both have laptops). </s>
<s> It would give the message that it was running low on virtual memory when we had too many explorer windows or media open, but closing them usually resolved this issue. </s>
<s> Well, I turned the computer on this morning to check my email. </s>
<s> Things were working fine. </s>
<s> I left for a few hours and when I came home, the screen was entirely black with the message &quot;disk boot failure&quot;. </s>
<s> I tried restarting and noticed that it's not recognizing the hard drive at startup. </s>
<s> Naturally, this also means that when I insert the Win XP boot disk, it tells me it doesn't recognize any hard drives. </s>
<s> I opened up the computer, checked the connections and tried a different power supply. </s>
<s> Still the same problem. </s>
<s> So, my question is, am I out of luck and is the drive just dead? </s>
<s> Or is there any chance that the cables are dead and the drive is fine? </s>
<s> I'm not hearing the clicking or strange noises like I did when my first one failed. </s>
<s> Then again, I was gone for about 5 hours, so I don't know what happened in the moments leading up to the failure. </s>
<s> Nothing was open on the computer except my Mulberry email client. </s>
<s> Despite our first rash of bad luck and my repeated reminders, my husband has not been backing up his school work in the past few months. </s>
<s> I'm going to buy a new desktop since there is no point to updating the old one again, but I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to get the data off the hard drive, beyond bringing it to an expert? </s>
<s> And if that is recommended, does anyone have a ballpark on cost? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Joy </s>
<s> That's worth the few dollars. </s>
<s> Later on the new machine consider some 20 buck USB HARD DISK ENCLOSURE at newegg.com or geeks.com and hope the drive shows up. </s>

<s> Since, you're going to be getting a new system, then consider adding the old HD to the new system. </s>
<s> Doing this *may* allow it to be seen. </s>
<s> You will need to jumper the HDs, old and new for CS operation. </s>
<s> Visit the support website of the HD vendor and go from there for details. </s>
<s> BUT, most HDs do have a sticker/decal that explain the jumper setting. </s>
<s> If the new system doesn't see the HD then(once properly setup), then the HD is kaput. </s>
<s> You can then consider what cost you're willing to pay for any data recovery. </s>
<s> Google for such a service and offhand, expect to pay roughly anywhere from $500-2000+ and no real guarantee either of 100% recovery. </s>
<s> Do yourself a favor and don't try any recovery methods should your system see the HD if it repeatedly shows errors of any sort as you'll further corrupt data or start to. </s>
<s> You can try an ext. </s>
<s> USB enclosure for possible access that way as Robert posted. </s>
<s> If the system doesn't see it then nether, then find a recovery service. </s>
<s> This service has done well in the past: http://www.essdatarecovery.com/ use keywords: HD data recovery tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for your helpful thoughts. </s>
<s> I think I know what you're referring to with CS operation--so instead of jumping one disk like you do when you have master and slave disk, I jump both. </s>
<s> Will they load or run any differently when I do? </s>
<s> Also, if this doesn't work, is there any use in trying the external USB method that Robert posted about? </s>
<s> Or they both trying the same thing in different ways? </s>
<s> Finally, does anyone know if newer desktops will still support a 3.5&quot; floppy disk bay? </s>
<s> Up until a year ago, my husband still had to use these to back up data when he was at school, so he has some data on them I need to transfer to CDs. </s>
<s> I was considering taking out the floppy drive bay from my old computer and putting into the new one to back up his old stuff. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Joy </s>
<s> You can use the master/slave jumpering if you like, but CS does OK too. </s>
<s> Once, you jumper correctly, and installed on HD cable properly as well, keeping the new HD as originally connected and place the old HD on remaining connector. </s>
<s> Once all that is done, hopefully when powered-ON the new system sees the old HD. </s>
<s> If it asks for a &quot;dual boot setup&quot; decline should it ask. </s>
<s> Otherwise, if the old HD does get acknowledged, then finish boot, retrieve data to any storage device. </s>
<s> Once, you're finished, remove old HD(power down) and return new system as it was. </s>
<s> The method Robert offered is another way, you can try. </s>
<s> If the process I suggested fails -OR- you play it safe and deal only as Robert posted first then any *POSSIBLE* glitch is keeping on the USB enclosure and keeps the new system from poof factor(rare). </s>
<s> The plus side if it works and you get all required data, you can reformat the old HD and then use it as a ext. </s>
<s> storage device. </s>
<s> You can also use a entirely new larger HD as well of even greater storage capacity. </s>
<s> The FD drive if your new system doesn't have it, more than likely will accept it. </s>
<s> You will the old cables and access to a FD port on the new mtrbd. </s>
<s> and set the bios to accept it. </s>
<s> If you find no *legacy FD port* then using a USB type floppy is still an option. </s>
<s> Using USB for FD usage will require such a purchase if you want to retain that storage method. </s>
