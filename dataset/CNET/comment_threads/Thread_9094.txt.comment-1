I'm having an issue with my network adapter.
My daughter was surfing the web when she says the internet stopped.
I looked and the network adapter is not picking up the network from a router two feet away.
The wireless network is working fine - I can connect with the other three devices in the house.
But this CPU will not recognize the network.
I have updated the device drivers for the adapter and run a basic Windows diagnosis - it says the drivers are up to date and the device is operating properly.
I have also run anti-virus software just in case she picked up something while browsing.
What am I missing?
