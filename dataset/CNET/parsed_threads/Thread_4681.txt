<s> My comp is not a gaming rig, not even close to being one. </s>
<s> I can still play some games but at a slow framerate pase. </s>
<s> What I want to know is. </s>
<s> When you lower the resolution in the game, it shows improvement in every aspect except picture quality, but on mine if I lower the resolution in windows and the game is shows dramatic improvement. </s>
<s> Is this just a thing in my head or does this happen in everyone elses comps? </s>
<s> When computers get tested for benchemarks Frame Rates do they do this or what? </s>
<s> the game, the monitor, the video card. </s>
<s> No standard effect. </s>
<s> at 800x600 the video processor must process 480,000 separate pixels. </s>
<s> At 1024x768 you get 786,432 pixels. </s>
<s> That is almost double the number of pixels. </s>
<s> But the only thing I couldn't figure out was why the performance wasn't along the same lines as the number of pixels.. How can my friend run at 1600x1200 with only a 20FPS difference? </s>
<s> The effect is negated by the number of textures, the number of objects and the number of polygons in the game. </s>
<s> Since these are a constant that take up a majority of the processing power, the number of pixels has a smaller but still noticeable effect. </s>
