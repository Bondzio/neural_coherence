I want to buy a desktop which fulfills all the needs for an IT student like large storage, graphic cards..etc. I am totally confused about what to buy?. I am willing to pay good price for a best configuration. i want the latest one also. Kindly give me your suggestions like brand, hardware configuration...etc. Thanks

Your IT classes may not require you to need much more than a machine with a web browser and not much else. IT covers such a wide range of topics but today you might get by with a web browser, google docs and mail. So the need for large storage and video cards might be for playing games, and not about the college work. Bob

Actually i use pc for programming, web designing, multimedia editing, networking, animation...etc. i can afford a good value for a computer which can run the above programs and i want the latest one i.e from core2duo

And my heavy duty programming machine is the 589 buck HP G62 with i5 CPU, 4GB RAM, 250GB HD and simple Intel 4500 GMA. I author Windows Mobile and other apps with that and it's plenty fast. It's also not a desktop. Animation runs fine on it too. Bob
