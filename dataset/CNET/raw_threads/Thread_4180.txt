My graphics card is an NVIDIA GE Force FX 5200. Several days ago I bought a new monitor - an LG W2061TQ, 16:9 monitor. I set the resolution in my Control Panel&gt;Display&gt;Settings to 1600X900, the highest setting available there. The problem: As soon as I boot my computer, instead of the typical, initial screen appearing (typically for a few seconds) which shows the keys to press to enter the BIOS, and other preliminary screens then appearing, a little error message box appears with the following: &quot;Digital out of range - 74.3kHZ/60Hz.&quot; Then the Windows &quot;Welcome&quot; screen appears and looks fine. Once my computer finishes booting, my desktop screen also looks fine. 1) What does this error message mean and what can I do to eliminate it? 2) Even with this error message appearing when the bootup process starts, do I still have access to the BIOS if I press the correct keys to access it when the bootup process starts? Thanks. Richard

It doesn't produce the right video output for my new big screen and I see that message and others when I try. To fix this I've ordered up a newer card. I bet there are some that will think some driver will help. Bob

So nothing you can do if the FX5200 is just too old or can't provide a matching setting for best performance. If it continues to display the message but yet works, then be happy. Because, the only real solution is to replace the video card to a later model. tada ====Willy

I wanted to ask before I try it and potentially screw something up. Thanks.

That's why i mentioned the monitor generates some messages. Now, when you access the bios that will be a basic video setting/level which any video card will be capable of handling. If for some reason, it can't display the bios display then you have other issues. You should then check the monitor int. setting(on-screen diags.) and see what's being done. If all this gets too involved or becomes such a hassle, again the best course is to replace the video card to newer one. FYI- If you monitor came with a install CD, read the manual. Any s/w, install it for a possible better marriage of video port and monitor. tada -----Willy
