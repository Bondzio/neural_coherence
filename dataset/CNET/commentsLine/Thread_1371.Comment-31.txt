based on my recent buying experience, i am very, very, very happy with dell.
found the best price (although to be fair most compatable systems were within $20-$40, not like i save $150 or anything by going with them) but the biggest thing i liked was the ease of the web site to build my own configuration, the 100 possible options, the friendly (yes friendly) sales folks and especially the speed to get the system.
i actually placed the order tuesday night 8:10pm.
now remember i did a custom job where i picked the hd, ram, dirves etc.
anyway, it came to my door on froday afternoon.
they built it wednesday and shipped it that evening.
anyway, dell gets high marks from me for now.
ps hint - if there is one componant you need but not another (for example, you need a printer but laready have a good monitor and don't need one) watch the site carefully over a course of a few days or more.
they are always moving around their sales, sometimes daily, and one day the printer may be $50 and the next day they are giving it away for free.
i have posted other notes as well about this purchase if you want to search - but basically got p4 530, 512 mb ram, 80 gb hd, monitor and printer $465 with shipping (free) and tax.
main thing i saved on was i did not need the dvd player or dvd burner, so thaty helped keep it below $500, but still a great deal and you add those as well.
anyway, dell is a great choice imo
