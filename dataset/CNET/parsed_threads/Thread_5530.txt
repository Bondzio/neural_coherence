<s> I have a four+ year old Dell desktop with a Geforce3 Ti 200 graphics card. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade to a card with more dedicated memory preparing for adding Vista later. </s>
<s> Don't play graphics intensive games. </s>
<s> Could anyone please confirm my old card is in an AGP slot? </s>
<s> 2x/4x or 4x/8x??? </s>
<s> Any recommendations for models,brands or store would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> all pc's with agp slots made after 2000 are 4x or 4x/8x, so any agp card will do. </s>
<s> for vista, go with at least a radeon x series or geforce 6000 series or later card (avoid geforce 4/fx5000 and radeon 90000 series). </s>
<s> earlier cards may lack driver support and aren't really saving you any significant money. </s>
<s> you only need 128mb since you're not a gamer. </s>
<s> here's a perfect $41 card for you and the absolute cheapest card you should consider: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121542 </s>
<s> Many Thanks ramarc! </s>
<s> Just the help I was looking for. </s>
<s> Appreciate it. </s>
