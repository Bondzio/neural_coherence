1.1.1	Hi all .	St
1.1.2	I 've recently purchased a BenQ 52X24X52 EXTERNAL CD rewriter , and i 'm experiencing some difficulties .	St
1.1.3	I 'd really apreciate it if anyone could help me out ... here we go : I use win2k pro on a sony vaio laptop computer .	Sug
1.1.4	The rewriter came with no device drivers of its own , and documentation suggested the use of standard windows drivers , which worked fine ...	St
1.1.5	I can burn Cd 's just fine , but i can not select any other burning speed than 4X , even with ultra-speed compatible CD-R 's .	St
1.1.6	i went to the company 's site for drivers.. all i found was firmware , which did n't fix the problem .	St
1.1.7	Being a novice in CD burning , i 'm very frustrated not to be able to use the cdwriter to its full potential .	St
1.1.8	Any help at all would be sincerely apreciated .	St
1.1.9	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	You 'll need USB 2.0 ( Hispeed ) to go faster than 4X recording .	St
1.2.2	DO N'T FIX ANYTHING !	St
1.2.3	Your setup is working properly .	St
1.2.4	A poor soul I ran into noted almost the same as yours and ended up reinstalling the OS trying to fix this .	St
1.2.5	The sad part of the story is it was n't broken ... Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for answering ... but i do not think this is the problem ...	St
1.3.2	In the company 's website , they said that the 2.0 usb driver was not needed for win 2k and XP ... only for win98 ... so i think i already have 2.0 in my os ... . Is there a way to check ?	Ques
1.3.3	i could n't find any info in device manager ... besides , i forgot to mention that in nero , at one time , i was able to chose only between 4X and 52X writing speed ... but i could n't chose 52 because my CDR 's are designed for 48 max ... anyways this soon was over because i could n't chose anymore , it was back to 4X only !	St
1.3.4	i 'm goin NUTS ! ! !	St
1.3.5	what 's goin on ! ?	Ques
1.3.6	oh and another problem , i cant format my CDRW with incd , it wo n't read ... maybe smashing the thing against a walll would do the trick ... . no ?	Ques
1.3.7	: ( please help !	Sug
