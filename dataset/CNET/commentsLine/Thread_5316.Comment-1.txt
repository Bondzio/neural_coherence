i need to buy an external firewire-800 hard disk with at least 0.5tb, but i've never did this before.
what are the best reliable options?
things to consider: - my first choice would be a 3.5'' 2tb portable usb powered compatible with any os (some hd comes with software and i don't mind if mine does not) - but i couldn't find any (that would ship to brazil)!
- first thing is portability - no ac power, small size, things like that - but i'm willing to give that up for a good priced with 2tb.
- second and last, but not least, is again warranty and reliability - this is more a question if i should go local rather than international shipping.
- i'm thinking about those two opposite options right now:
