I did that.
Chose to install.
It asked what to install on: which partition There was one partition on my harddrive, and 8 mb of unpartitioned space.
I chose to install on the partition, (where my old OS is) and it said they dont reccomend it, the OS wont work right.
I dont want the old OS at all.
I want to DELETE IT!
How do I delete xp?
Anyone?
