It picks up wireless signals and connects well at hotspot areas, but so far I have not been able to connect at home. The error states as &quot;unable to obtain a server assigned IP address. Try again or enter an IP address in network settings&quot; Is this related to the wireless router settings? please advise.

If so, you have just learned why it should be - so passers-by with unknown new devices can't just walk right in to your network. so...have you configured the router to safely interact with your new wireless device? That will also require you to properly configure your new wireless device to match the security requirements of your wireless router. dw
