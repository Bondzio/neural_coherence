I suppose a dark orange, but not too dark.
They are straight lines that go from the farmost right side to about half way.
I seem to notice them better when I open a window with a white background on the desktop.
I just bought the monitor about half a year ago.
I have an ATI Radeon 9600XT video card.
I just downloaded the latest Catalyst drivers.
I haven't changed any settings besides the TV out configuration.
Are there any changes I can make to fix the problem?
Thanks!
