<s> I have a Emachines T1860 PC with XP home When cleaning out my hard drive, I accidentaly deleted a program that I believe may have been the driver for my Avance AC'87 speakers. </s>
<s> after I deleted the program, I checked the audio and it was working properly. </s>
<s> Since a litle over a week ago, however, I have been experiencing frequent problems with the audio. </s>
<s> Every 3-5 minutes, a loud buzzing sound will come on and off through the speakers repeatedly and the screen will shake at the same quick intervals as the sound. </s>
<s> I do not believe this is a virus, becaus I have had mcaffee installed on my computer and I rountinely check. </s>
<s> Is this a driver problem, or something else, and does anyone know what to do? </s>
<s> Check that all your audio connections are tight. </s>
<s> How close are the speakers to your monitor? </s>
<s> Are they shielded? </s>
<s> (designed for computer use). </s>
<s> Go to your control panel, device manager and remove the audio drivers and reload the drivers with the manufacturers CD, (or their website). </s>
<s> Its also possible that you may have a faulty audio cable. </s>
