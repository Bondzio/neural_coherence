about, including CPU-only ready-to-fit but none of them seem to have the reputation of the usual watercooling systems... but clearly they are more effective than air.
The Cooler Master Aquagate S1 is such an example and it will work with the QX, but I can't give you any firsthand info as I haven't built a machine around self-contained systems like that.
Air-wise have you taken a look at the Thermalright Ultra 120 Extreme?
I'm running a Q6600 (non overclocked) with it and I'd say based on the stock temps I'm getting with a fairly low volume of air wafting over it, it's a good base for decent OC's with the QX.
The case is just as important as the cooler (if it fits for a start, especially with the larger heatsinks which can interfere with side intakes/fans) if you're going to go with air of course... but that's probably another thread.
Personally I kind of tired with all that pre-OCing futzing, which is why I picked up a couple of Dell XPS 710H2C's
