i have a wireless b linksys router w/ two wireless cards.
one on the notebbok and one on the 2nd desktop.
i have a total of 3 computers.
2 of them are wireless.
with the noteboock and the wireless desktop my connection is constan but will range speed.
i can have both wireless computers sitting 6 feet from the router and will get real crappy speeds on the internet.
is it possible that i have someone outside of my two computers accessing my wireless connection.
and if so what can i do to identify and rectify the situation.
thank you for any advice you can give on this topic.
