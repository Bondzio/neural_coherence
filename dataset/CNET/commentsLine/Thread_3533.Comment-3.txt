i confirmed that speakers do work on another system.
also i am the only on who uses this computer and the cabling is relatively difficult to accidentally move.
i do not see any burnt areas on the motherboard.
audio test programs hiss at me.
i don't know what you mean by 2:1 audio, honestly, i'm not really a sound guy.
can you explain?
