I've read that vista 32bit only recognize 2gb? and the 64bit one can recognize more. I'm using Window Xp Pro,And recently I've added 2x 1gb ddr2 ram to my pc. When i right click my computer,properties, it says there is 2.98 gb(2x 1gb,2x 512mb) installed. But what i don't understand is that, why some of my other programs only detect my total ram as 2gb ? I've installed some ram cleaner program(such as Ram Booster,and some other to cross check) and they says my computer ram is 2gb only. I've ran cpuz and it detects all 3gb,all of them have the same specification except one. Here's links to 4 printscreen of cpuz of my rams. http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/foeqiwtctf.thumb500.jpg http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/hvuqexbnqc.thumb500.jpg http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/pfhsxfgngl.thumb500.jpg http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/nszhqaovdb.thumb500.jpg Does the mis-recognize affect the actual total amount of ram that my pc runs on? Is there any methods i could use to make my pc recognize the other 1gb of ram? Thnks In Advance.

Here's a picture of what im taking about, http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/lgkpkeqatf.thumb500.jpg And another question,=D,my computer actually can support window xp 64bit, should i format to 64bit? does it affect my ram problem? and from the link &quot; http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx &quot; it says that it doesn't really affect because 32bit can support up to 4gb while 64bit can support up to 128gb.so what do you recommend?? =)

It says physical memory limits in xp ,for 32bit, is 4gb. but that doesnt explain my situation rite? hmm.. =s 1 more thing, What does loaded image and 4gt means?Where do the loaded image appear in? xD Mind to explain briefly ? thnks in advance.

11530	7	281435	2690775	2690048	mystery blue	1/28/08 4:17 AM	1.20149382E12	Ic	Oh...i see now..i understand. sorry Bob. i really did view the link. but i dont really understand completely so i guess i kinda asked stupid questions.. =s. sorry.. thanks a lot for explaining. hope i didnt make you unhappy.=s Anyways.. thank you. now that clear out my doubts. =) But i still have 2 more questions, if you dont mind answering. 1.Where does my 1gb ram goes to? Is it like,in cases when Applications used up the 2gb of ram, Xp will use the extra 1 gb?? 2.If i turn off paging files will my pc run faster? since no paging into the hard disk and all of the files are kept in the ram.Would you suggest me to turn off paging files?? =) Thnks in advance again ..

No, don't call any question stupid. If you don't ask then you won't find out. This issue is coming up a lot with people ordering machines with over 2GB. As to the paging file, just let XP manage it and all will be ok. There is no speed gain by changing that setting. Bob

Since you say the application is limited to maximum 2gb, would my pc run any faster or will i feel any difference if i add 2 new 1gb rams to get a total of 4gb ? Froz, Darn limitations. haha.. xD

For instance a pair of desktops we used to render DVDs gave me a good measure back then. We could move the ram from one to another and the one with 1GB would finish the 6 hour task 5 minutes sooner. For Vista I think 2GB is the hot spot to be. You can try your own benchmark to see if going over 2GB helps but you will never find 4GB listed in any usable number since part of the 32-bit memory map must leave about .5 GB open for the video card, BIOS and such. You will find common reports of 2.75 to 3.5GB reported in the tools but even with the /3GB switch XP doesn't let the apps use more... Bob
