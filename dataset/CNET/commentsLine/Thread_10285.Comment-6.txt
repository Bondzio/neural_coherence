but after 3 decades of fax the brutal realization for us is that we can't have one fax machine.
well, yes you can but today's crowd won't accept that it could be the sender and then we have downtime on the primary machine (you pick a reason from down phone, power, ink, paper, isn't on, dead, incompatible, long list.)
once you bow to the inevitable and get the second line of defense in and develop a routine of &quot;if your fax didn't get here try our other fax line&quot; then life isn't so rough.
