1.1.1	My neighbor had never downloaded updates to his Win XP - SP2 system .	St
1.1.2	On my advice , he went through the routine to let Microsoft push updates onto his system .	St
1.1.3	When it was all over , he not only found his system has gone remarkably slower , but also found that he had lost access to Internet using IE v6 .	St
1.1.4	His system has a direct Internet connection to a cable modem from Optimum Online .	St
1.1.5	I peeked into his system and found that the typical icons for Local Networking and Wireless Networking have disappeared from the Network .	St
1.1.6	- Using my laptop connected directly to his cable modem , I was able to get to Internet without problems , but not using his desktop .	St
1.1.7	- I can not even get IPCONFIG to release and renew and reset the IP address .	St
1.1.8	- There are no icons in the system toolbar on bottom right to look at the TCP/IP properties settings .	St
1.1.9	- I tried a system restore to a restore point prior to the update .	St
1.1.10	It did not help .	St
1.1.11	- I reinstalled the NIC card driver and even replaced with another brand new one .	St
1.1.12	It did not help .	St
1.1.13	Does any one have ideas on how to restore the networking icons and just connect with Internet ?	Ques
1.1.14	I certainly do not want to format and reinstall the whole darned system all over again .	St
1.1.15	Thanks in advance for the help .	St
1.2.1	After checking the physical connection , try pinging the localhost or 127.0.0.1 to confirm TCP/IP is installed/configured .	St
1.2.2	Does it return 4 packets ?	Ques
1.2.3	If not , use the reset command , netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt .	St
1.2.4	Try recreating the connection with the Internet Connection Wizard .	St
1.3.1	If there is no other way to fix the problem you could use the system restore utility included in XP to restore the computer to a point before the updates were installed .	St
1.3.2	A restore point should have been created when the updates were installed if it is enabled .	St
1.3.3	This would eliminate the need to reformat or reinstall XP .	St
1.3.4	Re-installing IE 6 SP1 may also be an optoin .	St
