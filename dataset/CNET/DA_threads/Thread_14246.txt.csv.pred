1.1.1	I am a PC user who is thinking about making The Switch .	St
1.1.2	The price of the iMac 20 & quot ; is in my range , but I would rather have a tower configuration to make adding RAM or switching out drives easier .	St
1.1.3	The current G5 tower is beyond my needs and price range , ( and from what I understand , being discontinued as Apple moves to Intel chips ) .	St
1.1.4	Any chance Apple is considering a mid price , mid power , tower ?	Ques
1.2.1	the PM G5 range to have a low price , mid price , high price with corresponding power , already .	St
1.2.2	The next line of Power Macs will be Intel driven and will almost certainly be the same price as the G5 versions .	St
1.2.3	You would be surprised how easy it is to add RAM and change out HD 's on an iMac .	St
1.2.4	The current G5 is only $ 300 more than a 20 & quot ; iMac .	St
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	Thanks P , The only thing is that once you bump the RAM on both to 1MB , add Bluetooth and a 250 GB HD to the Power Mac ( to equal the iMac configuration ) , the price difference is more like $ 500 .	St
1.3.2	That does n't include a monitor , so add another $ 400+ or so .	St
1.3.3	A cranky woman at Apple said I could add RAM or change HDs on the iMac myself ( but not add a second HD if I wanted extra storege later or a RAID config .	St
1.3.4	) , but that it was a pain in the you-know-where to do .	St
1.3.5	I 'm not expecting Apple to be Dell , but I 'm wondering if an iMac is not going to be flexible enough down the road and $ 3000 is a bit out of my budget for the Power Mac .	St
1.4.1	Your savings on spyware , pest control , firewalls , antivirus and ongoing battles with virus , spyware , etc .	St
1.4.2	may be where those other savings come from to make the Apple more affordable .	St
1.4.3	I wo n't mention anything about PCs , Windows and the great driver hunts .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I know about all the junk that comes along with a Windows-based computer , though as Apple becomes more popular , that stuff will be written for the Mac OS too to some extent .	St
1.5.2	Right now the only thing I pay for is anti-virus ( $ 30/year for NOD32 ) .	St
1.5.3	I use Spyware Defender and AdAware for spyware , ZoneAlarm personal for a firewall , all free .	St
1.5.4	The main reason for my wanting to switch is I have never cared for the Windows multi-step , counter-intuitive way of doing things .	St
1.5.5	Sometimes I just give up trying to do something .	St
1.5.6	I do n't know how much easier things will be to do on a Mac until I have the opportunity to try one .	St
1.6.1	I had forgotten that the PM range does not come configured with Bluetooth and Wireless .	St
1.6.2	However , changing out a HD or adding memory is reasonably easy and if you are adept at prodding around inside any computer box , you should have no problem .	St
1.6.3	The raid would not be internal but a Firewire raid is no problem .	St
1.6.4	Sorry to hear that you got the cranky woman at Apple .	St
1.6.5	At least you got the one who had an idea what RAM was I 've just read an article about the Intel processors in the iMac and Mini .	St
1.6.6	They are in a socket and the newer versions of the Intel chip ( mermon ? )	Ques
1.6.7	fit into the existing socket .	St
1.6.8	An unexpected upgrade path .	St
1.6.9	You are stuck with the existing Video card in the iMac , it is surface soldered in .	St
1.6.10	Your choice of PM is Top of the Line so a cheap machine is not what it is .	St
1.6.11	Do NOT be tempted to get a discontinued PM G5 when the Intel G5 's are announced .	St
1.6.12	You will be sorry .	Polite
1.6.13	P	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	Internet , word processing , printing , editing photos and home video then burning to disk .	St
1.8.2	I am toying with the idea of TV ala a Tivo type setup ( I assume that precludes the iMac ) or a music server for home intertainment .	St
1.8.3	I am currently using a Dell that I will then move to my business .	St
1.8.4	I assume I can still work with photo and Word or Quicken files from one machine to the other ?	Ques
1.9.1	Yes , I did hear about the impending change over for the PM , as well as the issues with non-native software running slow on Intel Macs until the third party software companies finish their upgrades .	St
1.9.2	I do n't plan on a purchase right now , just setting the groundwork .	St
1.9.3	The PM I was looking at was not the top , the slower processor actually .	St
1.9.4	Just an upgrade of RAM and HD size , and a wireless setup .	St
1.9.5	Do n't forget , I still would need a monitor with the PM .	St
1.10.1	A 20 & quot ; Intel iMac would suit you down to the ground .	St
1.10.2	Nothing you have mentioned here demands a PM G5/Intel .	St
1.10.3	The & quot ; ala a Tivo type setup & quot ; does not preclude the iMac .	St
1.10.4	You may be underestimating the capabilities of the iMac .	St
1.10.5	It is a fully functional , powerful machine with all the normal full sized parts inside .	St
1.10.6	The iLife suite will allow you to deal comfortably with all your photographs , iPhoto , all your music , iTunes , all your Digital movies ( HD or otherwise ) , iMovie and all your DVD creating needs , iDVD .	St
1.10.7	All these programs work together which allows you to easily use any music , pictures or film in any of your projects .	St
1.10.8	( such does not exist in the Windows world ) .	St
1.10.9	MS Office for Mac , if you must , is available with no cross platform concerns .	St
1.10.10	Open Office ( free but kinda flaky ) , AbiWord ( free ) all work well with MS Word .	St
1.10.11	Guess what we call the equivalent of Quicken ?	Ques
1.10.12	Yep , you guessed it , we call it Quicken and the files cross over .	St
1.10.13	Based on your stated use of a new Mac , you have not convinced me that you actually need a PM G5/Intel .	St
1.10.14	For $ 2374 you get yourself a fully tricked out Intel iMac with 2Gb RAM , 500Gb HD , Bluetooth and wireless , OS X , iLife a beautiful 20 & quot ; LCD and NO viruses .	St
1.10.15	Just a thought P	St
1.11.1	Tempting , very tempting ... Can the iMac be set up with some kind of TV tuner ?	Ques
1.11.2	I guess that 's what I meant , adding a TV tuner card that allows watching and recording TV ( and eventually HDTV ) .	St
1.11.3	It 's not a primary concern , but something I would consider adding if I decide to build a PC .	St
1.11.4	Is it true that the fastest speed you can burn a CD is 24X and no dual layer DVD burning ?	Ques
1.12.1	Check out http : //www.elgato.com/ for the tv tuner for OS X. I 'm guesing that you have not been to the Apple store , on line , and actually looked at the specs for the iMac .	St
1.12.2	Yes , the CD burning speed is 24X but remember that this is a drive that does everything : & quot ; 8x SuperDrive ( DVD+R DL/DVDRW/CD-RW ) installed ; writes DVD+R DL discs at up to 2.4x speed , writes DVD-R and DVD+R discs at up to 8x speed , writes DVD-RW and DVD+RW discs at up to 4x speed , reads DVDs at up to 8x speed , writes CD-R discs at up to 24x speed , writes CD-RW discs at up to 8x speed , reads CDs at up to 24x speed & quot ; Oh no , the Dual Layer DVD myth has been busted .	St
1.12.3	Next !	St
1.12.4	Oh yes , if you feel the need to go much , much faster , you can always attach a firewire device , really easily .	St
1.12.5	P	St
1.13.1	The ElGato device looks a bit pricey for something at this point I 'm not sure I really need , though it 's nice to know it 's available .	St
1.13.2	I know , the Superdrive handles everything , but so does my Plextor , which can burn CDs at 48X .	St
1.13.3	I know , nit pick !	St
1.13.4	I guess the main apprehension I have is the whole compatibility issue between my PC , which I would take to work , and the iMac .	St
1.13.5	You said I would n't have any problems moving Word or Quicken documents , and photos , in an editible form back and forth between machines , without any kind of conversion ?	Ques
1.14.1	Office for Mac files are the same as Office for PC files .	St
1.14.2	A picture will open on any machine provided you have a program that will open that file type .	St
1.14.3	IrfanView will do .	St
1.14.4	Check with Quicken but I have moved PC quicken files to the Mac and used them .	St
1.14.5	P	St
1.15.1	I have a 7500 that is over a decade old with 3 display boards one of which is a TV tuner .	St
1.15.2	They were closeouts many years ago from Other World .	St
1.15.3	The drivers are for system 9 and earlier , and I have not tried to run them in Tiger .	St
1.15.4	Three monitors side by side , one over other and any other stacking you wish to come up with .	St
1.15.5	Now if our miniMac had all that i/o it would be hog heaven .	St
1.15.6	The old set is still functional , but with three TIVO 's in the house it is much less used now .	St
1.15.7	And with only 1 G hard drives it ca n't store many minutes of video .	St
1.15.8	On multi-screens , it makes Photoshop really 300 % better with two full screens separating the controls on second port .	St
1.15.9	No , I have n't tried three with PS .	St
1.15.10	Alternative is one of the really huge ( $ $ $ ) displays .	St
1.15.11	duke	St
1.16.1	He could do what I 'd do and that is buy the basic 20 & quot ; iMac for $ 1699 , and then spend $ 450 at someplace else ( newegg.com ) and wind up with More hard drive and More memory for $ 225 less .	St
1.16.2	You can get a 400GB SATA drive and a USB2 SATA drive enclosure for $ 210 , which would allow using whichever drive he chose to put in the enclosure to be used by Both computers if he formatted it in FAT32 .	St
1.16.3	You can also get excellent memory for at least $ 100 less than Apple would charge , with the benenfit of having the 512 stick leftover .	St
1.16.4	He sounds like he knows enough about computers in general to do this stuff without much trouble .	St
1.16.5	What I 've found is that even though Macs can be intimidating on the outside , they 're pretty much the same once you crack the case .	St
1.16.6	I 'm a longtime PC guy ( my job ) who 's been exploring the Mac world for a while now .	St
1.16.7	I have a B & W G3 ( now G4 ) as well as a DualCore Mini that I maxed out the RAM on .	St
1.16.8	Fun Stuff .	St
1.17.1	But even a Mac Mini would be sufficient for your needs .	St
1.17.2	All of the same software that comes with an iMac also comes with a Mac Mini .	St
1.17.3	You can get a Mac Mini with a Superdrive as well .	St
1.17.4	I currently use my Mini for audio editing , creating movies with iMovie , graphics work with Adobe Photoshop Elements , Flash animations , and of course word processing , browsing the web , email and the other common things we all use our computers for .	St
1.17.5	I 've got the old Mini with 1GB RAM , and an external 320 Gig firewire drive , as well as an external Lacie DVD burner with Lightscribe .	St
1.17.6	The little Mini just chugs right along .	St
1.17.7	It never crashes and never gets a virus .	St
1.17.8	I 've even heard of people installing and using Apple 's pro software , Final Cut Pro on these little Minis .	St
1.17.9	Now , granted , you ca n't upgrade the internal hard drive to 500 GB ( unless you can find a 500 GB laptop drive ? ) .	Ques
1.17.10	But all of this just goes to show you how much you can actually get done on the less expensive Macs .	St
1.17.11	But just imagine what you could do if you bought 2 of these Mac Minis , put them together , and hooked them both up to one screen using a switch .	St
1.17.12	You could have 4 GB of memory , up to 240 GB of drive space , and a major multi-tasking capability .	St
1.17.13	For example , encode your DVD on one Mini , and then switch to the other to browse the web or check your email .	St
1.17.14	Or in your case run Mac OS X on one , and Windows on the other .	St
1.17.15	The possibilities here are endless .	St
1.17.16	And it would all take up less than 7 inches of desk space .	St
1.17.17	Hope this information helps .	St
1.17.18	Have fun with your new Mac !	St
1.17.19	~Cliff Mac user since the 1984 Apple Lisa II .	St
1.18.1	Hi just bought myself a powermac .	St
1.18.2	Awesome machine and once you see and open it you know why it is that bit more expensive.Checking out the Apple refurbished site is a good option to save a lot of money .	St
1.18.3	and Buying a rather basic ( still powerfull though ) tower leaves you the update options for later using non-apple memory ( Crucial has a great support site ) etc .	St
1.18.4	Overall I have no regrets buying this machine .	St
1.19.1	... Maybe just nuts over the Mac Mini .	St
1.19.2	I work professionally for a newspaper group and use a Mac Mini since Jan. 2005 .	St
1.19.3	The Mac Mini out-performs any G-4 in our department also .	St
1.19.4	Memory is 40 Gigs and our hard drive is set at 1Gig .	St
1.19.5	I am sure that more is available working with Apple .	St
1.19.6	We run OSX10.4.4 currently .	St
1.19.7	OS10.4.7 is available on an update .	St
1.19.8	This little bugger is just awesome .	Polite
1.19.9	One of my co-workers uses a dual Mac Mini at his home since the intro and loves it being so fast .	St
1.19.10	$ 699 for a dual Mac Mini is inexpensive .	St
1.19.11	The Mac Mini will be here for a long time .	St
1.19.12	It is amazing how many older Mac users do not want to even try out a Dual Processor Mac Mini and only want a tower iMac .	St
1.19.13	You and I could link about a dozen of these little buggers in the framework of a tower .	St
1.19.14	Just Awesome ! ! !	St
1.19.15	Something to think about .	St
1.19.16	Cliff , Thanks for your info .	St
1.19.17	-Kevin	St
1.20.1	& quot ; Memory is 40 Gigs and our hard drive is set at 1Gig .	St
1.20.2	I am sure that more is available working with Apple & quot ; Huge memory and tiny hard drive .	St
1.20.3	You probably mean those figures to be the other way around .	St
1.20.4	There is NO tower iMac .	St
1.20.5	Why are you not running 10.4.7 on your Mini ?	Ques
