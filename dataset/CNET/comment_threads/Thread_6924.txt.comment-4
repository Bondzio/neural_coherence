So I'd have to either get the dual proc 4600 or 4800 to match the current sing proc 4000.
And getting the dual 4200 would't be enough to see a difference.
So I'm pretty much stuck with my current CPU.
I was trying to hold out on the major upgrade.
I'd love a x2 4800 but prices are outrageous!
$350 plus!
