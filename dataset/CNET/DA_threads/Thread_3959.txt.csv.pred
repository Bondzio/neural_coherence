1.1.1	I have just completed my installation of an Intel Pentium D 940 processor on a BIOSTAR P4M900M7 SE motherboard.	St
1.1.2	The box of the CPU shows the CPU as Intel PD 940 3.2GHZ OEM.	St
1.1.3	However my WINXP system info (settings/Control panel/system) shows Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 3.2GHZ 1.60GHZ 1.93 GB of RAM Physical Address Extension Is this correct?	St
1.1.4	Is my CPU running at 1.6GHz or 3.2GHz?	St
1.1.5	If I am only running my CPU at half speed, what can I do to change it?	St
1.2.1	well i got a dual core CPu so it works at 3.2GHz yeh but it says that its 1.6 GHz so if u got a dual core cpu dont worry about it if you dont i dont know whats wrong	St
1.3.1	Thanks, I found the fix.	St
1.3.2	There is an option in the BIOS called &quot;load the optimised defaults&quot;.	St
1.3.3	After I click it, control panel/systems now show 3.2 GHz.	St
1.3.4	I guess it was set at a lower rate when it first installed and started up.	St
1.3.5	This may be the &quot;normal default&quot; of the BIOS.	St
