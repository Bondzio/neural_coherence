Maybe somthing wrong with burner? I bought it almost 1 yr ago from Radio shack and have just recently tried to burn with it. any other suggestions. Thanks for your help

I would try another blank disk, burning it again (maybe at a much slower speed?), but this time, after you click &quot;write CD&quot; and then click &quot;burn,&quot; look at the bottom of the window that appears and put a checkmark where it says &quot;verify written data.&quot; after the burn process it will eject and reinsert the disk automatically and compare the disk to the files you copied. try that and lemme know - fj

I called Radio Shack today since thats where I bought it from and they ran me through a few things and they determined there was something wrong with the unit itself since the write lite dosent come on. they suggest that I just buy a new one since this one is outdated it was a 6x4x6 and it probably be cheaper just to replace. This really sucks since I've had it a year and a half and it had never even used since i bought it. Until this past week. thanks for all your help Nancy

If I run up NERO and select some &quot;image recorder CD/RW&quot; it will ask for some filename and go through all the motions, but the CD is blank. Be sure you don't use the &quot;image recorder CD/RW&quot;

When my pile of hard disks (years ago) was over 50 pounds and the likelyhood of scavenging a circuit board or cable to fix another was diminishing, I took the whole lot to some electronic flea market. The boxes were marked &quot;DEAD HARD DRIVES 2 BUCKS&quot; The units were sold out in 15 minutes. There's a lesson in there somewhere. Bob
