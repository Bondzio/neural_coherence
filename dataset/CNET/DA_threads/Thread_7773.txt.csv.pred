1.1.1	I 'm considering purchasing a HP 5590 Scanner .	St
1.1.2	I have a load of old notes that I do n't want to part with and wanted to digitize ( at last 5,000 pages ) It has an ADF ( auto doc feeder ) and apparently software that will allow scanning of lots of pages .	St
1.1.3	Last time I attempted this the scanner I purchased sporadically loaded pages in Adobe but since it was the read version ( not full ) more often it gave me error messages .	St
1.1.4	Is the 5590 a good product for the job I 'm planning ?	Ques
1.1.5	I use a XP OS .	St
1.1.6	Thanks Pete	Polite

1.2.3	Copier machines that handle paper well are many thousands of dollars .	St
