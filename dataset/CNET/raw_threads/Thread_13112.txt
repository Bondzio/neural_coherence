But then when I connect it (ucb) to the computer it doesn't see it. But hit print and a page comes out blank.Tried different ucb port, reinstalling; any other suggestions?

Does any other USB device work, say a flash drive? Does the printer show up in control panel under printers? There are a few things we need to know.

Yes, the usb plug works for other devices, my mp3 player is recognized and usable. But the printer is not recognized when I plug it in to the usb. I have removed and reinstalled the software but the program says it can't find the printer. Maybe my usb printer cable is bad. Just a guess, I'm not much of a geek.
