1.1.1	I have a Windows XP SP3 PC with the Generic BT 5.1.26 Radio Driver and the same version.	St
1.1.2	Windows BT enumerator I am having no trouble adding an Android device ( HTC Evo ) however, there is no connection held after the successful password matching....... Is there a newer driver that will help this connection error?	St
1.1.3	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	The Bluetooth dongle on the PC is a Cambridge Silicon Radio.	St
1.2.2	It does PAIR ok, but after the passphrase exchange is successful, the connection fails.	St
1.2.3	I am assuming this can be fixed with a driver update, which I have had no luck finding after a pretty exhaustive search.	St
1.3.1	But I found it cheap enough at 5 or so bucks to toss (actually I give the ones I don't like away) it and replace it with units that don't need more than the native Microsoft Bluetooth drivers and stack.	St
1.3.2	Since you have the packaging you stand a better chance of finding the maker's web site than most.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
