<s> Hey guys thanks for looking in on this I need some help trying to power some cold cathode neon lights via an AC wall outlet and unfortunately power currents/transformation is not my expertise! </s>
<s> I'm trying to power several of these: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16800888072 with a regular old wall socket (I'm using them to outline a DJ booth if you're curious). </s>
<s> That product includes the option to plug a SECOND tube into the same sound-activation module that is included with the kit. </s>
<s> That module is then powered by a 12v molex 4-pin which has a 2nd 4-pin connector to daisy chain it to more neons I'm assuming. </s>
<s> I've looked into this a bit and have several questions. </s>
<s> Would it be best to use a $15 adapter such as this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812123309&cm_re=ac_12v-_-12-123-309-_-Product And considering that I could daisy multiple modules together, would one adapter be enough to power a few modules (with each module possibly powering 2 neons for up to 8 neons total)? </s>
<s> Or would I need to use one adapter per sound module (one adapter per 2x neons)? </s>
<s> The second option would be to use an ATX power supply unit. </s>
<s> I've heard that they need to be &quot;loaded&quot; as in connected to a motherboard to actually turn on. </s>
<s> I've also heard that you can &quot;short&quot; that specific connector to get it to turn on w/o a mobo. </s>
<s> I would really appreciate it if anyone could explain this a little more clearly to me. </s>
<s> I'm familiar with soldering wires but that's about as extensive as my electrical circuitry knowledge goes =/ Thanks for looking and any help! </s>
<s> Each light unit draws 700ma, and 8 units will draw 5.6 Amp. </s>
