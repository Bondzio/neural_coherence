What install software cd were you using?
You shouldn't have to be using anything on that drive if you plan to use it as a second harddrive (slave) with XP except to hook it up as a slave and then format it when you get to the desktop.
If you were trying to install XP on it when you already have XP on the system as the boot, then that may be where you ran into trouble.
You don't mention what position you hooked that drive up as on the second machine (master/slave?
)....nor do you say if you hooked it up as a slave what the actual boot drive on that machine is.
