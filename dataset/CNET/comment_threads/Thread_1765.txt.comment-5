Again, much thanks - with your added info, I checked the USB hubs - none set to power save.
Sorry, I'm using the internal Windows Firewall on each unit.
And on your last point, Yes, I know of Network Magic - it came with my router, and for the 1st month of the router's operation, N M did it's thing very well - but I guess I'm one of those nuts who consider problems to be challenges, and I figure that if there's a way to make this work w/o N M, then that's the way I'd rather it be.
Some would say that's just being a stubborn fool, but in my heart I know it's the way I learn the few things I do.
And besides, I no longer have the resourses to support the economy the same way I once did.
