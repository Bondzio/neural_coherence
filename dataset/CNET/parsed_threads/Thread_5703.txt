<s> I need to buy a lot of ink cartridges, so I'm trying to find a place online to buy these for the least cost. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure if anyone had any favorites. </s>
<s> So far I have checked with: Staples Office Depot Office Max Circuit City Best Buy CD Amazon ANTOnline Beach Audio Ace Photo Digital J&R The Nerds.Net B&H Video Direct Inkjet Superstore eBay Wal-Mart KMart Also, if you have any negative experiences with these sites I appreciate that info as well. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> ok lets see - B&H is going to be expensive, staples and offices will sometimes have sales or coupons. </s>
<s> I havent found anything on ebay that made sense yet. </s>
<s> The internet ? </s>
<s> I have tried 2 different places and had nothing but problems. </s>
<s> I have an HP 6210 all in one - 1 black and 1 color cart. </s>
<s> soooo I get mine at wal-mart until I find something better, which I hope may come up in answers here :-)) ted </s>
<s> I have had good luck with my cartridges at carrotink.com Johnny </s>
<s> hi there i have been using phoenix inks for a while now,they give a great fast service and reasonable prices too plus a buyback service on (some) empty cart's.give them a look at:-- http://www.discandink.co.uk/acatalog/contactus.php good luck............steve. </s>
<s> If you have a local Walgreens drup store around, they should refill your empty cartridges a lot cheaper than buying more new ones. </s>
<s> Once you have an empty one just drop it off at Walgreens and they will refill it. </s>
<s> I have had good luck on Ebay with the Abacusfree store. </s>
<s> they also have a site: http://www.abacus24-7.com/ . </s>
<s> Same people, ebay site has free shipping, the other does not. </s>
<s> Been using their aftermarket cartridges at work for almost 2 years without a problem </s>
<s> I buy mine from www.Pacificink.com. </s>
<s> They have a wide assortment of the brands. </s>
<s> They are usually half price if not better. </s>
<s> Free shipping if you join there club. </s>
<s> The club is free just they setup a regular delivery schedule of ink for you. </s>
<s> Which you can adjust as you see fit. </s>
<s> I've been buying mine there for a couple of years now. </s>
<s> There inks are good enough for everyday printing and decent photo output. </s>
<s> If you require top notch finish stick with the retail ink from the manufactor. </s>
<s> They are usually the highest quality. </s>
<s> But not cheap. </s>
<s> This goes for all the generic ink outfits. </s>
<s> For me I haven't needed the highest quality. </s>
<s> Also I have found by using the cheaper inks I can go for better paper and get pretty damn good quality there. </s>
<s> Just my 2 cents! </s>
<s> I have been buying compatible ink cartridges from Clickinks.com because there price is a few cents lower that others and they also have a buy 2 and get 1 free offer on all orders. </s>
<s> So for the price of 2 I get 3 and save some money. </s>
<s> And they are quick on deliverys. </s>
<s> They also sell OEM ink. </s>
<s> check them out. </s>
<s> For years I've been buying my ink on-line via http://www.gotink4u.com/ and have had nothing but good luck with their products. </s>
<s> It's all been non-OEM stuff but it's also cost a fraction of what it would have cost me through the big name retail channels. </s>
<s> Honestly, in the hundreds of cartridges I've used over the years I can count on one hand the number of bad one's. </s>
<s> If a cartridge is bad it's not so painful to just toss it because they are so cheap to begin with. </s>
<s> I'd suggest buying a few just to &quot;try them out&quot; and see how they work with your printers. </s>
<s> I certainly can't complain as they've worked great for me. </s>
<s> I have been getting mine from printpal.com for the last few years. </s>
<s> Service has been great, and fast. </s>
<s> Never had to return any, so I cannot comment about that. </s>
<s> For a 10% discount and free shipping,use www.printpal.com/card 10. </s>
<s> Before I found these guys, I bought from mrink.com. </s>
<s> I had a couple of leaky carts and a wierd message on the monitor due to incompatibility problems. </s>
<s> MrInk made good with minimum hassel. </s>
<s> Urgent needs I usually get at Walmart. </s>
<s> Thinking of trying the refill trick at Walgreens next time O have an empty. </s>
<s> Iheard bad news about some of the E Bay vendors, so I didn`t even try them. </s>
<s> YMMV, and good luck. </s>
<s> Sometimes you meet great people dealing online. </s>
<s> I'm a photographer and a graphics guy who uses a lot of ink. </s>
<s> Ran into a start up guy named Brandon who owns Inkgrabber. </s>
<s> Great attitude. </s>
<s> He saved me a fortune looking for local specials and my Epsom photo printer functions really well on the non-original equipment ink they have. </s>
<s> If you try them out please say Hi from Bob from upstate New York. </s>
<s> I have been buying from http://store.yahoo.com/megatoners for 3 or 4 years. </s>
<s> I have never had a bad one. </s>
<s> They are very cheap, but usually are the same off brand cartridges sold by others for 2-3 time as much. </s>
<s> My canon pixma1500 carts are $.99 for b&w and $1.49 for color. </s>
<s> Has anyone here tried Walgreens' cartridge refill service? </s>
<s> If so, how is the quality of the ink, and of the job itself? </s>
<s> myinks.com </s>
<s> I have bought my ink from two places, the first is 123inkjets.com. </s>
<s> Their prices are very good for the printer that I have, about $4.00 per cartridge. </s>
<s> the last place that I purchased ink from was abcink.com, and their prices were just as good as 123inkjets.com. </s>
<s> The only reason that I changed companies was 123inkjets.com no longer uses paypal as a payment source. </s>
<s> I received fast service from both of those companies. </s>
<s> For Europeans meeding to avoid postage costs from USA sources, the British www.7dayshop.com does quite a good deal on compatible cartridges. </s>
<s> Any other good Eurodeals? </s>
<s> Sorry it took so long to answer. </s>
<s> The replies were not showing up on my profile, so I didn't realize all these had come in. </s>
<s> I appreciate all the help. </s>
<s> I went ahead and bought from Staples, I ended up saving about $10 over what I could find from the cheapest store for the cartridge. </s>
<s> Since I needed them quickly and needed good quality I decided not to take any chances, plus I could return them right to the store if there was a problem. </s>
<s> I appreciate all the help and definitely will be checking these sites for the future. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> I just tried Office Max brand of Canon ink for my All-in One and the Black started to either dry too soon or clog the print head. </s>
<s> Returned it and replaced with Canon brand to fix it. </s>
<s> Now about to try Premium Imaging Products (made in China..damn it!) </s>
<s> from http://www.inkquik.com, hope it will be better. </s>
<s> I don't think any off brand will ever be as good as the original for ANY printer. </s>
<s> Always compare the printer cartridge prices before youre buying, it will save you a lot of dollars which is certainly important in these hard times. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com and http://www.inkguides.com lets you compare prices on the products so you now that you get the cheapest available price. </s>
