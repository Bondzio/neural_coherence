<s> I'm a consultant with a home office---if that sheds any light on my preferences. </s>
<s> At present I'm using a Netopia 3546; no complaints. </s>
<s> I want to add 802.11g and dislike having more boxes around than strictly necessary. </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>
<s> Not necessarily limited to Netopia ... What I'd REALLY like is a wireless gateway/router with gigabit Ethernet. </s>
<s> Not that my DSL service needs the humongous bandwidth; I'd just like to network my computers at high speed. </s>
