just forget about inkjets in general at the rate you print.
you can then look at laser printers.
but, because you want cheap then cheap is it.
look no further than the price because many offer decent output but again, your results are what you pay for.
most seek fantastic color but well within acceptable results for many users.
just about all brands have a bottom-end model that fit under $300 or less.
look for sales or online offerings than meet your needs.
the starter toner cart may last a yr. but it will deplete sooner only because its a small amount compared to replacement and cost should fit your wallet.
if you like you may want to try kinko's(or similar) a office/copy center that with your file or original form will reproduce at roughly 10-15cent per page.
use this when in a pinch.
