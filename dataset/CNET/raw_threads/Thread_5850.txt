Upon looking at the graphics card I noticed that one of the capacitors was &quot;expanded&quot; (the top seemed to be growing up out of the body of the cap), I'm pretty sure it's blown so I temporarily installed a radeon 9250 from another computer that I know is good and connected to a differant monitor as well to eliminate these 2 as potiential causes of the problem...all I get upon booting up is a blank screen! Could I have fried the mobo when the old power supply blew? I am unsure as to how to determine if the mobo is faulty or not. Any help would be muchly appreciated...
