<s> Sometimes when I turn on my PC, and it boots to the Windows Login, then the screen is very blurry and you can hardly read anything. </s>
<s> This did not start happening until I began using my Logitech MX518 Gaming-Grade Optical Mouse. </s>
<s> Anyone know why this would be happening? </s>

<s> I have tried two monitors - one is an e-machines flat panel, and the other is an older dell crt (sold in 2000?). </s>
<s> Also, if by the connection you mean ps2 or usb - i've tried both using the usb-to-ps2 connector as well as just the usb. </s>
<s> If by connection you mean internet - its cable :-P Lol. </s>
<s> if both monitors produce fuzzy text, i assume you've checked the cable on both ends. </s>
<s> is your card OC'd? </s>
<s> if so, reset it to stock specs. </s>
<s> is its fan spinning? </s>
<s> is it seated securely in its slot? </s>
<s> hope the problem's simple enough that this post helps. </s>
<s> Ever since I got the mouse it has produced the fuzzy screen every once and awhile when I startup the machine - sometimes I have to restart quite a few times to get the normal screen. </s>
<s> When using any other mouse - this never happens, however it is an excellent mouse that was $50 so I want to continue to use it. </s>
