1.1.1	Hi .	St
1.1.2	I hope I do n't sound like an idiot , but I just moved to a new home , transported my computer tower in my car without incident , and allowed it to remain in the car for about a half hour after arriving .	St
1.1.3	It was very cloudy and not very hot that day , so I do n't think I damaged it in the move .	St
1.1.4	Now when I use it for longer than 15 minutes or so I hear a repeated whirring about two seconds in duration : whir ... whir ... whir .	St
1.1.5	It 's very annoying .	Polite
1.1.6	I do n't have a cd or any other media in any of the drives .	Ques
1.1.7	The computer is about a year old , and I have n't had any other problem with it so far .	St
1.1.8	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	If its only a year old and still under warranty , take it in for a check up .	St
1.2.2	Otherwise it sounds like a fan might be going bad .	St
1.2.3	Sometimes you can take off the cover plate and determine which fan it might be .	St
1.2.4	Something may have been knocked loose also during the move and maybe just needs a little adjusting .	St
1.3.1	This might simply be what is called a & quot ; sympathetic & quot ; vibration which is a chassis noise that comes and goes as it is vibrated by a motor from a fan or drive .	St
1.3.2	It could also be a & quot ; harmonic & quot ; created by the difference in frequency of two motors ( again fans/drives ) that becomes a third noise when these other frequencies & quot ; beat & quot ; against each other .	St
1.3.3	You need to disconnect one motor device ( except for the CPU fan ) at a time to see if it goes away .	St
1.3.4	That it happens after about 15 minutes might have something to do with things warming up and reaching full speed .	St
1.3.5	Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	Thanks for the help .	St
1.4.2	I 'll have it checked out .	St
1.5.1	An experience I had .	St
1.5.2	In moving my puter around , the computer fan , attached to the body , had become loosened and constantly whirred after it heated up .	St
1.5.3	I made adjustments , and no problem since .	St
1.5.4	Touch wood..	St
