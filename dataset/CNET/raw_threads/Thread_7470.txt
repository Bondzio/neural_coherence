Will I have any problems adding the 160GB drive to my existing syatem? I know very little about this area (no kidding right!).

Only recent OSes support over 137GB and only then with the help of either an updated BIOS or a PCI card that you hope comes with the hard disk. The drive will come with instructions on how to install it for the OS in questions. Bob

I will check with the &quot;friendly&quot; sales people and see if it comes with the card. Thanks for the reply, and I have no idea why this posted 3 times, I only hit submit once!

If you have such a drive and reinstall XP and XP doesn't have SP1 built-in, then the over 137GB drive contents VANISH. Fix for item number 2 is to get or make an XP CD with SP1 integrated. If this is a DELL, then ask for an updated OS CD so you don't lose it all. Bob
