I'm sorry fellows,I forgot to thank my namesake Michael for the advice but I didn't do it because I knew that the problem with my peripheral wasn't physical it was a software thing I knew it, in fact I just installed some DVDs utilities and my DVD works fine with both soundtracks, please don't tell me of Alan, I forgot to include that I have Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition and so on.
But I'll inlcude this kind of information every other time that I need some advice or help.
Thank you both guys, for your time, for your advices.
This community rocks, computer science rocks, the Internet rocks.
Thx.
Michael Borbor Snchez
