<s> that is either not spinning correctly (perhaps the power wire is laying across the blades and is vibrating or dragging) or the video card has a fan of its own that is too close to something as well. </s>
<s> If the system is brand new, I would take it back to the vendor as it's still under warranty rather than mess with opening the case and blowing your warranty out of the ballpark. </s>

<s> Thank's for reply Toni.I put report in this morning to Dell and am waiting for reply.I would really hope not to have to box it back up for shipping.Maybe the sound is harmless.I recently had two ear procedures done and ears may be too sensitive.Maybe Id better ask a few people to come in and listen to it for opinion.Thank's again for reply. </s>
<s> At work I use a Dell GX270 and it makes a whing noise that comes from the CPU cooling fan and it changes under CPU load. </s>
