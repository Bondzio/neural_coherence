xfx has a life time warrenty and great customer support so there are folks which would only use xfx Why ATI?
if you are into mmorpgs many of them like the nvidia better .
If into mmorpgs i had less issues with the 8600 512 then the better more expenxive cards I also suggest using a local shop that would post your cpu and mother board and power it up.
That way you have back up if something goes bump Post means they attach the cpu to mother board with fan and power it up.
Also include decent fans both side back and on top of cpu.
If into specific games have you gone to their web site tech help sections to see what video cards are experaincing problems?
What set ups seem to work best?
Best price isn't always safest way to go .
Sometimes having support after the sale is worth the extra then over the net purchase ( something to keep in mind)
