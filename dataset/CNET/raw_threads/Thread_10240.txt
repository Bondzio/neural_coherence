My hardware i have to work with is my PC, with a wireless connection to my DSL modem, fully functioning. It also has a wired LAN connection to a small router near my computer, not connected to the internet. My XBOX 360 is also connected to this same router. XBOX Media sharing works fine, but i want to route my internet connection from my computer to my XBOX. Is there any way this can be acheived in this setup? I have tried ICS, bridging connections, many things. I am pretty network literate, but i dont know if i can do this and how to go about doing it. Thanks in advance.
