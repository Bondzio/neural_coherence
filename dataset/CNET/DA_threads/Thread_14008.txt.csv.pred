1.1.1	Hi guys , I need some help here .	St
1.1.2	I 've been using my external hard drive and it has been working perfectly for the last 6 months .	St
1.1.3	However , yesterday , quite suddenly , it stopped working .	St
1.1.4	Plugged it into my Windows Vista computer and saw the & quot ; Safely Remove Hardware & quot ; icon pop up , but the drive does n't show on My Computer ... clicking on my J : shortcut link causes Windows Explorer to crash .	St
1.1.5	Tried it on Windows XP , same problem occurs .	St
1.1.6	Both problems are solved the minute I unplug the external hard drive without safely removing the hard drive .	St
1.1.7	I also note that before my external hard drive started to malfunction , I might have accidentally disconnected it without safely removing the hard drive .	St
1.1.8	I 've read somewhere that this may be the cause of the problem .	St
1.1.9	Is there anyway I can fix my hard drive or at least reclaim my files inside ?	Ques
1.1.10	Cheers !	St
1.2.1	Look up these demos .	St
1.2.2	GETDATABACK Zero Assumption Recovery .	St
1.2.3	While CHKDSK may work , it did corrupt a disk thoroughly so I 'm a little shy to write that 's the right answer but many times it did correct the issue .	St
1.2.4	In closing , many externals come in FAT32 format which is easy to corrupt .	St
1.2.5	Convert to NTFS as soon as possible .	St

1.3.1	Hey Proffitt Thanks for replying How do I convert it to NTFS ?	Ques
1.4.1	http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/314097/ If you can afford to loose the data on it , you can also format it again as NTFS using Disk Management : http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/309000 Hope this helps .	St

1.5.1	Awesome !	St
1.5.2	I 've found out that my external hard drive is already using an NTFS system .	St
1.5.3	I managed to retrieve my files ! ! !	St
1.5.4	Now , would it be possible to reformat my external harddrive ?	Ques
1.5.5	It 's not showing up in My Computer or Disk Management ( which actually crashes everytime I try to load , unless I unplug my external hard drive ) .	St
1.6.1	I 'm afraid something is wrong with the drive , if Disk Management aborts with it .	St
1.6.2	Can you try it on another PC ?	Ques
