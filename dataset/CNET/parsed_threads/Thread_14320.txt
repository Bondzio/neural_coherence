<s> Hi there, I've installed the software for scanner but I'm having problems with the hardware. </s>
<s> I plugged it in an available USB port and got the following message. </s>
<s> ''USB device not recognized. </s>
<s> One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it. </s>
<s> Try again.....'' I tried the other port but nothing happened at all with that one. </s>
<s> I uninstalled software, reinstalled and used the other port first, till wouldn't work. </s>
<s> I can't install the scanner using hardware wizard cos the brand name isn't in the list (even when showing all names.) </s>
<s> The scanner is a Mustek 1200 UB plus. </s>
<s> I have the system requirements it asks for, WinXP etc. </s>
<s> Would someone be able to help me please?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Kiai xx </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> While the issue is usually the PC, not a word was shared about it's make or model. </s>
<s> Even less about who installed the OS and if it has all the drivers from it's maker installed. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> Ok, cheers Bob, Now you're asking something. </s>
<s> All this stuff about operating systems and the like....lol....Don't know the make and model (DOH!! </s>
<s> Don't know how to find out either) but my Brother installed the OS and yes all the drivers from it's maker are installed. </s>
<s> (Well all the ones I got with the computer.) </s>
<s> I'm a beginner when with computers but I'm learning all the time (there's so much to learn though) I appreciate the time you took to answer. </s>
<s> You were that quick you must have been sitting waiting for my question.....lol....... </s>
<s> Thanks again, Kiai xx </s>
<s> Everytime a member make a new post, these words appear in RED! </s>
<s> &quot;Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.&quot; -&gt; But you did reveal a clue about which was &quot;all the ones I got with the computer.&quot; Why is that a clue? </s>
<s> Because any driver that came with a machine can be far out of date. </s>
<s> In closing, I see you neglected both my hints and the Forum Note about supplying make and model. </s>
<s> This is a rough way to start digging into your issue. </s>
<s> For now, head to http://www.usbman.com and read the usual about why USB doesn't work for many. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again Bob and sorry, You're very kind. </s>

<s> Hello again, I've accidentally found the make of my computer (and model number as well I think) I was looking for something else and went into system from control panel. </s>

<s> Version 2002. </s>
<s> SP2. </s>
<s> Computer. </s>
<s> AMD Athlon(TM)XP 2600+ 1.25GHz 256 MB of RAM. </s>

<s> Is it any help though?? </s>

<s> Need a motherboard driver package that Microsoft doesn't install for you. </s>
<s> Is the one you installed from this year? </s>

<s> Hi, My Brother installed XP for me this year, I used to have Win98. </s>
<s> He just used the drivers that came with the computer which I bought Christmas 2003. </s>
