Your system is pretty dated.
In that regard you should at least verify that any bios updates have been applied as at least one may pertain to HD sizing issues in what you can install.
Your best bet for ease of install, is to get a &quot;HD kit&quot; that will contain the s/w and h/w plus the install guide, etc.. Further, you consider a &quot;pci controller card&quot; to make better use of the larger HD and bypass possible hassles if your bios doesn't support large HDs.
All this is explained at the major HD makers support website.
While you may find 30-40gb HDs out there, usually there is sale(more bang as see bigger vs smaller) online/local of HDs and 80gb and above is normal so be sure your system can support that.
If so, the controller solution is valid or even part of the HD kit.
