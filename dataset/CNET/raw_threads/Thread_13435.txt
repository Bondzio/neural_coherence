10006	0	112830	1281578	NR	huskerz85	7/5/05 9:17 PM	1.12059822E12	New Computer	I'm a college student almost ready to begin my junior year. I'm also somewhat of a gaming enthusiast and would like very much to dive deeper into that hobby. The catch is, for the past two years I've been using an HP Pavillion notebook (1.8GHz Celeron, 40gig HD, 447mb RAM, Radeon IGP 340M). It's turned out to be a real workhorse and has kept up with me admirably, but it's limits are now readily apparent. Don't get me wrong, it plays some of my favorite games (Rainbow Six 3, Star Trek: Bridge Commander, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), but with newer titles like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, The Sims 2 and Half Life 2, my hands are tied. Space is also another issue. I've got a large MP3 collection, download mods for my games and occasionally I'll download music videos/movies. The space problem has gotten to the point where I recently had to go out and buy an 80gig portable hard drive. I started computer shopping two months back, keeping important factors like price and expandability in mind. Two weeks ago, I found the perfect machine; an HP Pavillion (a1034n) with a 3GHz P4, 200Gig Hard Drive, 1 Gig of Ram and a Multi Format DVD-ROM/CD-ROM drive. Yesterday however, Best Buy pulled the machine from their lineup. Now, I'm forced to fall back onto my second choice. It's an HP Pavillion, with the same exact specs as the other machine, except this happens to be a 'Photosmart/Media Center' PC (mod. m1264n). http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=320291&pfp=BROWSE Barring any major financial disasters, I should have enough to get this within the next month-month and a half. For moderate gaming plus day to day stuff (word processing, internet etc.) I'm thinking this will be a pretty solid investment (esp. since I'm on a somewhat limited budget), but what does everyone else think? Comments/Tips/Suggestions would be appreciated as well as comments from people who've actually dealt with this model or similar ones like it =) **Keep in mind, since I'm looking to get deeper into gaming, I'll definitly be upgrading the onboard video/audio setup**

10006	5	112830	1282820	1281578	huskerz85	7/6/05 2:15 PM	1.1206593E12	What about this one?	Okay, the lack of a PCI express slot bummed me out, but ahh well. I went back to Best Buy's website and found a Gateway that slightly outperformed that HP I was talking about. The specs of this machine (mod. 830GM) are basically the same, except the P4 Processor uses Intel's &quot;EM64T&quot; technology which basically means it 64-bit compatable. It's also slightly more expensive, but if this is indeed a good machine, than I think I'll spring for it. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7131089&type=product&productCategoryId=cat01172&id=1110263403701 And as for the graphics upgrade, I'm either gonna go with an X850 XT P.E. or a 6800 Ultra. By the time I get enough money together (months and months down the line), ATI & nVidia's new chips should push the prices of those two I mentioned, down to a more reasonable level.

Don't think you can get much of a gfx update without a psu upgrade, and not sure if its propritary so might just get a 6600gt, nothing like the 6800ultra or other power consuming chips. Roger
10006	9	112830	1283120	1283095	AKonny47	7/6/05 5:38 PM	1.12067148E12	the psu is not proprietary btw	that power supply is 100% atx compatable, it is the exact same mechanism used on the 820gm, e.g. my pc which i upgraded to an antec true 480. so you are safe unlike dell konny

10006	11	112830	1284036	1283508	AKonny47	7/7/05 8:12 AM	1.12072392E12	well, you only have to buy one when you upgrade	anything higher than a nvidia geforce 6600gt will require a new power supply. (6800 series and 7800 series) ati, anything from the x800 series, including the xl will require a new power supply. i bought an antec true 480 for $120 at frys, but they fell in price by a lot. i would go anything above 400 watts. konny

HP/Compaq try to turn out as many new systems as they can in a year and that lowers the overall quality of each system. I highly reccommend purchasing a dell or emachines system, on the other hand there is alwasy the custom option. Buy the parts and assemble it your self or pay some one to do it.

Dual rails, Sheilded cables and Fortron is one of the few PSU builders that actually under rate their PSU's. Mine is solid as a rock and if you check around you will find that Forton's are indeed a quality PSU.
