The problem is that many chipsets didn't support such large memory sticks back then for simple reasons.
I won't detail how the world has changed but I find some that find it incredible that a machine today doesn't support today's sticks and drives.
But it is so.
Moving on.

http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d865gbf/sb/CS-027111.htm does list a 1GB stick so all that you can do is try it and hope the stick's organization is fine.
This is not to offer a course in memory tech but to write I find the speed to not be the problem here but the organization.
