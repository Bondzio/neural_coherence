The data of the article.
If you were building the machine in 2006 then I can see where a fast dual core might be better than a slower quad core for many folks.
The industry had not quite figured out how to use all those cores.
Today......the industry has figured out how to split things 4/6/8 ways.
Photoshop..video editing.......I'd jump to the 8 core.
