<s> Looking to buy a PC Video Editing System but confused about what makes the system faster where editing and rendering is concerned. </s>
<s> Please advise: Which memory am I better off with? </s>
<s> DDR2 ECC SDRAM or 400MHz DDR Memory 3.40 Ghz Single Processor or XEON Processor? </s>
<s> Does the video card make the difference? </s>
<s> Which video card do you recommend? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Pam 50 </s>
<s> We have a paltry 4 MB ATI RadeonGO card on on DVD rendered box after we tested with some 2 hundred card and found no difference in performance. </s>
<s> It seems to be all about the CPU, CPU CACHE and memory speeds. </s>
<s> Next in line are hard disk speeds. </s>

<s> Most video editing software is extremely dependent on CPU and RAM. </s>
<s> I'm not sure which way to go on the RAM question - I personally haven't put a lot of stock in RAM speed differences. </s>
<s> I use an AMD Athlon 64 CPU and PC 2700 DDR RAM (1.5GB) running Avid Xpress Pro editing software. </s>
<s> I have basically no problems with rendering, layers, etc. </s>
<s> I also am running (internal) ATA/IDE drives and connecting both USB and Firewire external drives. </s>
<s> Access of the externals is sometimes a little slow, but not enough to affect the editing performance. </s>
<s> The video card requirements depend on the software requirements. </s>
<s> For example, Avid - and many other high end programs don't require more than about a 64MB video card in most cases. </s>
<s> I run an NVIDIA 128MB card in my system. </s>
<s> I've been told not to waste my money on a high end/high RAM capacity video card for editing - the current softwares won't use most of the onboard video RAM anyway. </s>
<s> look here 4 the ram ddr2 is better but the site backs me up. </s>
<s> hav fun http://www.alienware.co.uk/news_pages/news.aspx#DualDDR_0621 btw:4 this site may need to press refresh a couple of times till it is all loaded, also look here for your graphics card question aswell. </s>
<s> Pam, Use the faster memory, min 512MB -&gt; 1 gig better. </s>
<s> 3.0 Intel P4 800Mhz CPU will have enough power on a dual channel M/B. </s>
<s> Visit the Video Guys here http://www.videoguys.com/system.htm Lots and lots of information on systems and video editing Bill . </s>
