try using an external usb floppy drive for the bios flash.
if that doesn't work, contact dell and complain to them that you followed their recommendation to update the video card bios/firmware.
their recommended procedure and softwae ''bricked'' your video card and they need to rectify this.
a solution would be a new video card or a utility that repairs the video card bios.
