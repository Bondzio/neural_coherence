hello !
i need help plz !!!
i have an averatec 3250 and it came with xp home installed and has recovery disks with xp on them !
the lap top has problems with the touch pad that only occurs when windows is running and the same as the power supply the screen flickers but never when the system is booting up or when in the bios !
i was going to change the os and install my own xp copy to see if that was the cause ..... but when i go to delete the partion it stops me and says that the volume is a system partion and cautions me !
what is a system partion and can i erase it with out any problems?
plz help !
