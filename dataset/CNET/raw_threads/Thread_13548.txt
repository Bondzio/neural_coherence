Currently I have to print out files and write everything down and transcribe in onto my main computer (when I remember). I have the most detailed herd and milking records for my herd thanks to my computer geekyness and it would be great to access this in the barn. Anyway.... I currently have my two home office computers networked. I want to add my new/old barn computer to the Network and actually use the barn computer as a &quot;terminal&quot; to access my main computer, using the wonderful RealVNC software ( http://www.realvnc.com/ ) that I use to access my main computer when I am out of town. Here's my problem. I know nothing about wireless technology. I do have line of sight to the barn from my office window. The barn is 450' from my office. The &quot;office&quot; in the barn is on the other side of the barn, so we're talking about 490'. The signal would need to go through my office window, the two wooden (oak) walls in the barn that are about an 1 1/4&quot; thick. The barn computer will be running Windows 98 SE. My main computer runs Windows XP. I cuurently have my two office computers &quot;cable networked&quot; using a very old Linksys Router and a hub. How can I set this up?? Is it possible? thanks! Molly
