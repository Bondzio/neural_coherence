Sometimes the ATI and nVidia drivers don't play entirely nicely together, so be careful how you configure the system.
When you go to install 3D applications, ensure the renderer you want to use is selected, etc.
You might consider just going to the AIW board (if it offers similar performance to the nV board you have right now) as your sole board, and bypass the driver headache.
