<s> I have been satisfied with my Linksys CM100 cable modem and Linksys WRT54G wireless router (about 22 mbs down and 1 mbs up). </s>
<s> Security settings were pretty straightforward, and the setup worked well with HomeDNS for my WEBCams in my old Dell E520 XP system. </s>
<s> Last night we had a power surge that fried the computer and the cable modem. </s>
<s> I got a temporary replacement modem, but apparently the wireless router was also hit, so I will have to replace both. </s>
<s> My question is whether there is any reason to move to a more modern system or possibly a combo modem/router. </s>
<s> Someone recommended a Motorola SBG 6580, but I'm wondering if I would likely see any real improvement in performance, and whether I would just be asking for setup headaches. </s>
<s> Right now I am leaning towards trying to find identical replacements, but I would welcome any suggestions. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Charles &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> I was also looking at the Linksys E1200 or E2000 or E4200 as a replacement for the WRT54G. </s>
<s> Would one of these be a more modest upgrade? </s>
<s> First question would be does your ISP use or plan to use DOCSIS3. </s>
<s> You fried modem does not support this. </s>
<s> Of course you also have to ask if they charge extra to use this feature. </s>
<s> If all your equipment is G band then you will see little difference in any of the linksys routers you mention. </s>
<s> The primary difference is if you need wired gig (streaming HD video INSIDE your house would be a example) , or if you need to run on the 5ghz band (your PC would need a wireless card that was compatible). </s>
<s> Do you buy a combo router/modem is a tougher question. </s>
<s> It will generally be cheaper to buy a combo but your selection of feature and brands is somewhat limited. </s>
<s> You also of course would need to replace the unit if you changed technology say to DSL,FIOS,UVERSE. </s>
<s> Since the amount of money is not huge I would go for separate units since you can pick the features that meet your needs the best. </s>
<s> The SBG6580 is a combo modem/wireless router which means if one side goes out you replace the whole thing. </s>
<s> If you like the Mororola modems why not go with a stand alone modem like the SB 6120 or SB 6121 modem, they are all DOCSIS 3.0 and then get a stand alone N wireless router. </s>
<s> If your IP is Comcast and you are in a DOCSIS 3.0 area you will see a improvement because you will have 4 bonded channels down which gives you more constant speeds. </s>
<s> You may end up spending a little more, initially, but I have heard they have problems with the combo units </s>
