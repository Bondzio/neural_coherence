<s> Looking for netbook for dad, Key needs Normal keyboard & screen (Preferrance), Hard disk 40GB or more, Windows OS. </s>
<s> As it is for checking mails only and mostly at home use no need for great battery or light weight or looks. </s>
<s> Max 450$. </s>
<s> Netbooks, by definition, have a smallish screen and a smallish keyboard. </s>
<s> So your requirements aren't quite clear. </s>
<s> Why not specify a minimum and maximum size (10&quot;, 11&quot;, 13&quot;, 15&quot;) or resolution (800x600) for the screen, and a minimum widt (in inches or centimeters for the distance between q and \? </s>

<s> Thanks for the great replay. </s>
<s> I understand all netbooks are generally 10&quot; but seen few like Lenovo Ideapad S10 which are 12&quot; (like standard laptop). </s>
<s> So i was looking for something which is more like standard laptop is screen and Keyboard perspective but low end for just mail check. </s>
<s> - http://www.dell.com/home/laptops calls it's 10&quot; machine a netbook, everything bigger (up from 11.6&quot;) a laptop. </s>
<s> - Lenovo calls it's 12.1&quot; machine still a netbook. </s>
<s> - Wikipedia says: By mid 2009, CNET noted &quot;the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other,&quot;[1] noting &quot;the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices.&quot; So what's in a name? </s>
<s> Don't shop for a certain class of devices, shop for what you need. </s>
<s> Luckily, I see you found one you like. </s>
<s> Nothing wrong with Lenovo, of course. </s>
<s> Did you see and touch it already in a shop? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> no i have neither saw or used it, nor i have decided on one particular brand. </s>
<s> So to not to get into defination of Netbook or notebook. </s>
<s> My need is, I am looking for one 12&quot; portable machine. </s>
<s> Can you suggest few options (amx 450$) which fits the bill? </s>
<s> (Netbooks, notebook, laptop..) </s>
<s> Not from personal experience. </s>
<s> But searching LAPTOP 12&quot; in google finds some hits to shops that have it from HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer, Asus, Fujitsu, Toshiba. </s>
<s> Don't fully trust those shops. </s>
<s> Visit the websites of the makers also. </s>
<s> Hope there are one or more you like. </s>
