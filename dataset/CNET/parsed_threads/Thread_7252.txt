<s> My old battery back-up/surge protector just went dead. </s>
<s> I am debating on buying a new one. </s>
<s> Is it worth it? </s>
<s> I am using a separate surge protector now. </s>
<s> Thanks, Chuck C. </s>
<s> While you can live with just a surge protector, battery backups aren't that much more expensive and give better protection which likely extends the life of your computer. </s>
<s> Sometimes things happen to your house current that cause lights to flicker or blink off and back on. </s>
<s> Surge protectors can't provide continuous regulated power during these whereas battery backups can and do. </s>
<s> Sometimes these momentary outages can be long enough to cause your computer to power off abruptly, risking damage to your data unless you have a battery backup. </s>
<s> Most battery backups have a USB connection which can do an orderly shutdown in case a power outage lasts longer than a few minutes. </s>
<s> This is why I use them. </s>
<s> Your usage determines what's best for you. </s>
<s> Having a battery back-up is added insurance should the time required for its use. </s>
<s> Some areas are more prone to power loss or glitches, so if you feel otherwise, you determine the need. </s>
<s> Overall, I don't see this as a real expensive purchase when compared should the *NEED* arise, it may can be money well spent. </s>

<s> Which anomaly is a concern? </s>
<s> For example, how often do incandescent bulbs dim to less than 40% intensity? </s>
<s> Never? </s>
<s> Then AC power remains ideal perfect for all computers. </s>
<s> Why does a computer need a battery backup? </s>
<s> If voltage is dropping to near zero, then clocks on VCRs and microwave ovens (that are far more sensitive) must be repeatedly reset. </s>
<s> If not, then your battery backup never did anything useful because AC power is ideal perfect. </s>
<s> Battery backup is temporary and 'dirty' power. </s>
<s> So that unsaved data can be saved to disk. </s>
<s> It protects data; not hardware. </s>
<s> Another function is surge protection. </s>
<s> Not near zero voltage. </s>
<s> That is protection from a destructive current. </s>
<s> How often are dimmer switches, digital clocks, and GFCIs replaced? </s>
<s> If surges exist, then all appliances are at risk or have been repeatedly replaced. </s>
<s> Meanwhile read surge protection spec number for that battery backup. </s>
<s> How many hundred joules? </s>
<s> Destructive surges are hundreds of thousands of joules. </s>
<s> At near zero joules, what has battery backup done? </s>
<s> Again, temporary and 'dirty' power during a blackout. </s>
<s> Two anomalies are discussed. </s>
<s> The first is temporary and 'dirty' power so that unsaved data is not lost. </s>
<s> The second is a surge that can damage hardware. </s>
<s> A destructive surge is maybe hundreds of thousands of joules. </s>
<s> A rare and destructive anomaly that is solved where wires enter the building. </s>
<s> Using a solution that costs significantly less money. </s>
<s> How often are a dishwasher, furnace, CFL light bulbs, and smoke detectors replaced due to surge damage? </s>
<s> Which anomaly is a concern? </s>
<s> I guess I will buy the same one that most of our company computers have where I work......the Eaton 3S550 UPS 550VA. </s>
<s> They're around $70.00. </s>
