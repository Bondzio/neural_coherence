<s> I have a very frustrating problem with this monitor. </s>
<s> Sometimes it works fine for days, then suddenly goes black, and stays that way for days then I switch it on randomly, and up it comes again. </s>
<s> When it goes black, and I switch it off and on again, it lights up perfectly for a fraction of a second before going black again. </s>
<s> I can repeat this as many times as I want then some day itll come right again. </s>
<s> I fix PCs for a living, so understand technology in general, but have never worked on screens anybody give me any pointers? </s>
<s> Any help on how to physically strip it down would be helpful too, as I tend to break little plastic catches and things Thanks a lot Roger </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7590_102-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=62739&messageID=744233&tag=forums06;forum-threads where that failure was traced down to a common issue. </s>
<s> Remember that service manuals are rare to non-existent because these are consumer disposables. </s>
<s> It's likely you'll have to wing and do the microscopic inspection of all solder joints and reflow any that look even the tiniest suspicious. </s>

<s> You know, when I started repairing computers not he early 90s, there was no internet, so no forums... how did I manage? </s>
<s> Guys like you make my life liveable! </s>
<s> And of course, as you realise, I didn't do a search. </s>
<s> At least I don't think I did it was late at night here in England. </s>
<s> But I think I assumed this was a one-off... </s>
<s> Thanks again will get the hot poker out tonight! </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> WOW Roger, sounds like a lot of fun! </s>
<s> Intermitents in anything can be a nightmare. </s>
<s> Have you checked the inverter(most LCD'S use one) could be iffy connectivity there that is the first place I would look.If that isn't the problem, like Bob said, get out your jeweler's loop and check solder joints but I wouldn't put a lot of time into it. </s>
<s> It is just a fair monitor to begin with. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> Well, I've completely taken it to bits, and all my boards are very different to this one I suppose I can just check for obvious dry joints on what I assume to be the inverter board! </s>
<s> But, although its vaguely the same shape, and the same yellowish colour, it hasnt got those coils and things. </s>
<s> OK, just in case any other poor sod is reading this, there would appear to be quite different inverter boards in what appears to be the same monitor... </s>
<s> I followed a trail of links from this thread, and eventually found somebody else with the same inverter power board as me no toroidal coils etc, but some big caps, which had ballooned a bit at the top. </s>
<s> He replace them and pronounced it fine one of mine was the same, so I've replaced the lot it's fine so far! </s>
<s> Woo-hoo!!! </s>
<s> Now all I need is a cheap replacement screen for a Packard-Bell C3300 notebook which somebody sat on... </s>
