<s> Which is better? </s>
<s> What's the difference? </s>
<s> My PC config is a AMD Sempron 2400++ Socket A 256 MB DDR PC 400 Inno 3d GeForce 4 MX 440 AGP 8x Kinda sucks cause the GF 4 cant play splinter cell because it dosent have a shader.. Im planning to upgrade my DDR and graphic card so please help me to choose between 6600/6600LE thanks.... </s>
<s> ...show the LE is the bottom of the 6600 tree. </s>
<s> Full review : http://www.pcstats.com/ArtVNL.cfm?articleid=1866&page=1 6600's in LE / Normal / GT are shown. </s>
<s> Geebee. </s>
<s> well i guess about that review you've shown me.. the big difference is the price between 6600LE and 6600GT although LE cuts the power lesser than the GT.. i guess i wont notice that very much... thanks for the reply.. </s>
<s> ...when your target is one of the most power hungry games, and you're considering cutting corners on graphics cards. </s>
<s> As an indicator of just how badly anything lower than a 6600GT will do in Splinter Cell, and keeping with that same site, have a look : http://www.pcstats.com/ArtVNL.cfm?articleid=1983&page=7 Notice the 1024 x 768, Shader Model 3 scores? </s>
<s> Using the frame rates as an indicator (Splinter Cell prefers cards with more RAM), go back to the other review and look for a game there which shows similar 6600GT scores. </s>
<s> Gun Metal - Game 2 1600 x 1200 shows a slightly higher frame rate score for the 6600GT (20% more) than Splinter Cell...and look where the LE comes in (don't forget to substract 20%)! </s>
<s> GB. </s>
<s> 6600LE wont do it huh? </s>
<s> Maybe I could spend some more on a 6800GT or less and more ram maybe a 2 gig will do... </s>
<s> I ve upgraded my pc to a athlon x2 and a 2 gig ddr2 i have a Inno 3d 6200 pcie.. </s>
<s> I think I could buy a 6800GT or a 7200... </s>
<s> I think this would do the trick... </s>
<s> Though i may be too late, try saving up for a 7600gt. </s>
<s> It could play all the latest games at nearly break neck speed. </s>
<s> Though if you could go for, say a 7900gt or an x1800gto or x1900gt, then go for it. </s>
