Were you wearing an ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) strap when you replaced the CPU and Memory ?
Was your power plug still plugged in.
I wiped out two CPU's by NOT following ESD procedures.
When you attach your ESD strap to the computer, it needs to still be plugged into the wall so that you have a ground path through the ground pin on the power plug.
This post is really only for future replacement, it does not fix your current problem.
I agree with the person who told you to try just MOBO, CPU + Heat sink, and speaker and see if you hear BIOS beep errors.
Good luck
