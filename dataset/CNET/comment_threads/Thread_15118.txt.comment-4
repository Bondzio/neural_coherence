My cable company allows multiple IP's (don't ask me why - they just do - and I don't wanna rock the boat and ask them &quot;why&quot;) so both the server and the wireless router are assigned separate IP numbers by the cable company.
The IP's for the 2 devices have the same first 3 bytes (e.g.
xxx.xxx.xxx.yyy - the &quot;xxx&quot;'s are the same for each) - so that should but them on the same subnet.
FYI - I'm not a networking expert - but not a noob either.
Somewhere in the middle.
I don't know about PPP, but I'll read up on that and see if perhaps this could be the culprit.
