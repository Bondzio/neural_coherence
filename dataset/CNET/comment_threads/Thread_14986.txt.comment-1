I'm thinking about building my own computer (basically, a new MOBO, CPU, RAM and PS), and basically want to just move everything over from the old one (DVD Drive/ CD-RW).
But, would it be possible to move the old HD (with OS and programs on it) over to the new MOBO and have it still work, or would I need a new/blank HD?
