i have been using the rx600 for the last 4 months.i have used (and still using on a daily basis) all of its functions, and i am not dissapointed.
printing high quality photos might force me to replenish ink cartridges at a faster rate, but epson cartridges are usually cheaper than hp's.
i also liked the vivid color reproduction of the rx600 (i guess it is a personal choice).
we mustn't forget that it is an mfd; it has a lot of functions, but the output of the functions will never equal the output of specific &quot;single purpose&quot; devices/equipments.
btw, i don't work for epson, but i work in it and come across both hp and epson products everyday.
