1.1.1	Hi , I know it 's a question being asked over and over , but I 'm stumped as to what to get .	St
1.1.2	I need a new desktop .	St
1.1.3	I use some graphics packages and applications like dreamweaver .	St
1.1.4	But nothing too hungry .	St
1.1.5	I mainly use web apps to run my business and 'surf ' .	St
1.1.6	I use spreadsheets etc .	St
1.1.7	I like to work fast ( like everyone ) so I 'd like a PC with some uuummffff , even if it 's just half a dozen browser windows open etc .	St
1.1.8	I 'm not sure whether to stick with XP pro or move onto Vista .	St
1.1.9	My laptop is Vista and I have had no problems so far .	St
1.1.10	I do n't think any apps I 'll be using rely on XP , as I use mainly web based apps .	St
1.1.11	So that is n't an issue .	St
1.1.12	I 'm also torn between getting another Dell or trying HP .	St
1.1.13	I 've always used Dell ...	St
1.1.14	I 'd really appreciate any input into the spec I should look for ( or avoid ) , with regards to processor ( Dual core ? )	Ques
1.1.15	and memory ( I was looking at 4GB my current machine is 2GB and I 'd like to move up ! ) .	St
1.1.16	I use dal monitors and need a hardrive setup I can rely on ( I 'd like to have two drives mirrored ) .	St
1.1.17	Any and all advise appreciated .	St
1.2.1	The P-4 3 GHz with HT ( dual core ) are fast .	St
1.2.2	For your type of use these are perfect .	St
1.2.3	My current two have the P4 3 GHz HT processors and a Gig of ram , with the Gigabit LAN .	St
1.2.4	http : //www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay ? categoryId=2576395 & storeId=1 & catalogId=-840 & langId=-1 Do n't waste your money on four Gig of RAM .	St
1.2.5	More than two is overkill and will not be used by 99.99 % of all applications including XP .	St
1.2.6	Two Gig is all that is needed .	St
1.2.7	Trust me here .	St
1.2.8	Unless you want bragging rights .	St
1.2.9	Wayne ( IBM freak ) Click here to see the CNet faces , learn a little about analog and digital data , Internet connections , Spyware removal , and download free software .	St
1.2.10	My mini-Schnauzer is smarter than your honor student .	St
