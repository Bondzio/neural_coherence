i started wireless using linksys, but after many problems (and having to replace it due to a lightning strike) i switched to netgear.
i was amazed how places in my house that did not have a signal, all of a sudden were getting a good signal.
i was able to take out the extra d-link access popints, which had also not impressed me.
looking forward to trying the new mimo netgear router when the price starts dropping.
