I read a report a while back where someone had done a test of 5400 vs 7200.
In their test they did not see much of a diff.
Yes 7200 was slightly better.
Where they did see a big diff was in cache size.
Bigger is better.
So if your looking to squeeze out all the juice get a 7200 unit with the biggest cache you can find/afford
