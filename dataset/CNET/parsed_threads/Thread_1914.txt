<s> Ok, I'm going in the opposite direction as most people here. </s>
<s> I have a cable modem which is connected directly to a DLink wireless router. </s>
<s> Every PC in my house has wireless cards, so I have had no real use for network cable in a long time... however, what I'd like to do is add a wired hub/switch to my existing wireless network, but I'd like to do it in an area that is nowhere near my wireless access point. </s>
<s> How can I go about doing that? </s>
<s> I do have LAN cards in the PCs in the area I want to add this wired switch if there's the possibility of connecting one of the PCs to the switch in order to join it to the network. </s>
<s> otherwise, do I have other options, or is that even an option itself? </s>
<s> So to recap: cable modem - DLink wiress router on main floor of my house. </s>
<s> Multiple PCs with wireless cards, all with good connectivity to my network. </s>
<s> I would like to add a 4 port wired switch to my ''office'' area in the basement so I can network other devices without continually buying USB network adapters (for instance, my DVR or a printer) or by figuring out some other workaround. </s>
<s> This switch would then handle traffic from my existing wireless network just as if my network were entirely wired. </s>
<s> Thanks for any input. </s>
<s> ethernet ports available for wired expansion. </s>
<s> If feasible, simply run a cable from there to the switch. </s>
<s> But that's not feasible. </s>
<s> the whole point of the wireless network in the first place was to avoid running Cat5 through my house, which this would obviously entail. </s>
<s> I just need a switch downstairs, where there's a concentration of equipment, some with WiFi capability and some without. </s>
<s> And also, just for the record, it's also not feasible to move the cable modem and wireless router downstairs. </s>
<s> thanks for the response though </s>
<s> You can install another wireless router in your home office. </s>
<s> This router can be configured to forward dhcp requests to your main router. </s>
<s> Most routers come with a built-in switch with 4 to 8 ports. </s>
<s> You can run patch cables to the switch from the devices. </s>
<s> The cable drop from the other route can still be a back-up method. </s>
<s> But you would still need a switch to split the connection with either method. </s>

<s> don't the wireless routers have to be the same brand in order to accomplish this? </s>
<s> I had an old 802.11b wireless router and I tried adding it (mainly for the extra broadcast point) to my D-Link and they could never see each other.. </s>
<s> I don't think I still have that old one, but I could certainly buy another DLink if that would work.. that would also help my signal issues I have down here as well.... if I knew it would work. </s>
<s> I have an old Netgear router, could I just add that? </s>
<s> or what would happen if I just ran a crossover cable from my PC into a hub/switch? </s>
<s> the problem with the Netgear router is that there is only one port on it, so I would have to go straight from the router into a switch anyway </s>
<s> It's not the brand. </s>
<s> It's the particular wireless router model with a particular firmware version. </s>
<s> Some routers have firmware that support WDS, but most don't. </s>
<s> Some routers have 3rd party firmware available that can add WDS support. </s>
<s> WDS example: http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1934577,00.asp </s>
<s> Maybe I'll check ebay for a cheap used Wireless AP or router and see if I can get WDS to work.. </s>
<s> If you try with two WDS capable routers, essentially they both have to be the same (or similar) models. </s>
<s> The alternative is a bridge connected to some type of switch. </s>
<s> Internet --- modem --- wireless router ~ ~ ~ Bridge --- switch --- computers KEY: --- wired ~ ~ ~ wireless For more info, look at the user manual for the Linksys WET54G or another wireless bridge from the company of your choice. </s>
