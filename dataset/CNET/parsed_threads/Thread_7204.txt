<s> i'm not sure if this whole thing is a hardware problem, a software problem or both but, my computer doesnt detect the hard drives. </s>
<s> it froze a few days ago and i got the blue screen with the error message and i reset it, but it got as far as the black screen that says windows xp then it went to the black screen that has the options of starting in safe mode, normally, etc. </s>
<s> i chose start normally but it just reset itself and when it loaded that time it didnt detect the hard drives. </s>
<s> i reset it again and it detected the hard drives but wouldnt load windows so i reformatted the master hard drive and installed windows and it seemed to work but after i had installed most of the drivers it froze again and now wont load windows and a few times it didnt detect the hard drives. </s>
