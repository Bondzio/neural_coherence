<s> I need help with Norton Ghost 2003's clone tool. </s>
<s> I have a 250GB hard drive all set up with windows XP and norton ghost. </s>
<s> Now I am trying to clone it to a brand new drive with no setup what so ever. </s>
<s> The problem is, norton won't see the new drive. </s>
<s> Which is weird since I did the exact same thing a couple of minutes ago with another blank drive and it worked just fine. </s>
<s> thanks Ask if you need any more information. </s>
<s> The issues there run deep. </s>
<s> This is why I use G4U (see google) since it's all of 3 (three) words to type to copy a drive. </s>
<s> It's also free. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, you could have just told me that you have no idea. </s>
<s> Any way I figured it out. </s>
<s> The destination drive wasn't partitioned right, here the failure to see the drive. </s>
