1.1.1	Good Day, AS I was reviewing my systems information, something caught my eye.	St
1.1.2	I first read about my system on http://Cnet.com an Emachines T6524.	St
1.1.3	Their specification shows Ram DDR SDRAM PC 3200 @ 400MHZ .	St
1.1.4	When I received my system it came with 1 gig of ram.	St
1.1.5	I added another gig as my first upgrade.	St
1.1.6	Skip 6 months and I'm looking at my systems info and realize that I have 2 gig's of PC 3200 @ 200MHz.	St
1.1.7	So I have my system scaned to see if an upgrade of ram is out there.	St
1.1.8	Sure enough PC3200 @ 400MHz OK now the $64 question If I switch to the 400MHz will I notice a jump in performance?	St
1.1.9	Is it worth the switch?	St
1.1.10	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	pc3200 is ddr-400 and its memory chips operate at 200mhz.	St
1.2.2	since the date rate is doubled, you get ddr-400.	St
1.2.3	more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM if you're upgrading, stick with pc3200 (ddr-400).	St
