3801	0	583913	5415649	NR	Sunsetlover	1/25/13 4:34 AM	1.35908844E12	I moved my laptop 17 feet away from router and...	...the signal strength dropped by 50% to a speed of 24 Mbps I have a 11n 150 mbps router and a USB 11n 150 mbps adapter. Before I had my laptop 5 feet away and there was no problem of course. Now there is no longer direct line of vision. I did speedtests that confirm the loss of signal strength. I changed the router configuration to Channel 11, speed: 11n only. (not auto b/g/n) Any adjustments I can make? Thanks!

In my case I moved it to the adjoining bedroom 15 feet away on the same floor. Probably crappy router?
