My motherboard (ASUS P5E3 WS Professional) has the latest BIOS, and I'm running 64-bit Vista Ultimate. Both of these dual channel memory modules work fine as a pair. However, when I try to have both pairs running for a total of 4 GB, Windows won't boot. Are there any steps I could take to get these modules to work together, or should I RMA one? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks
