I look at the router maker's documentation for this.
As to the hardware, there are some but then again we are back to things very expensive and you know there is software under the hood.
You may wonder why there is no SIMPLE to use software like this.
It's a very simple reason.
The support would cost more than folk will pay for.
That is, folk that can do this, use the free tools.
Those that want it often do not want to know how to configure it and then may grumble about the cost.
Sadly this means that no one has a simple system.
