i am having trouble finding the netbook i want.
i want the 1001, but i cannot find this model with windows xp and 11hr battery life.
i even found a website that sells the model with xp and 6 cell but claims its only 5 hour battery life, but all other sites claim its 3 cell with 4.5 to 3 hr battery life.
why do i have to sacrifice 7 to 8 hours battery life to have xp, besides wouldnt u get even more battery life with xp running and the battery that comes with windows 7 version?
