I just bought and installed ATI 9800 PRO and it works great in XP, but I also use alot of bootable devices - such as floppys, cd-roms, etc...and as soon as the system bios is done, the screen goes blank and I get a 'NO SIGNAL&quot; message on my monitor.
HELP !!!
I have spent 2 days trying to figure this out.
