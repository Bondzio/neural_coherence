read  and see if you have enough power to drive what's in the box.
remember that 300 watt psu is not really 300. tom did a nice writeup about this at  in which out of 21 units, 9 didn't meet their own specification or just blew up.
by stressing the psu, it degrades quickly and your issue is very common.
but the nutty part here is that unless you replace the psu with a 450 or so watt unit and re-test, you can't tell if that's it.
i also asked you to share what you could about the machine, which is rather slim, but did reveal the psu issue.
other items would have been nice, but i know people don't always want to reveal all.
best of luck finding the bad hardware.
