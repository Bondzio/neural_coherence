<s> Hello, I just recently purchased a pair of Bose 2.1 PC speakers. </s>
<s> They are the Bose Companion 3 speakers which were rated very highly in the reviews which I read. </s>
<s> While they do deliver excellent sound and decent power for their size, I feel as though they should be a little better based on their price and the reviews which I read. </s>
<s> As of now they are connected to a P4 PC which is about 7 years old. </s>
<s> The sound card is integrated into the Motherboard, which is an Asus SIS 645 Motherboard. </s>
<s> My question is; if I upgrade my sound card by putting in a good PCI one, will the sound improve on the speakers? </s>
<s> Will they deliver my power? </s>
<s> In a sense, does the sound card act like an Amp or receiver? </s>
<s> Any advice is much appreciated. </s>
<s> Yes it would help, go buy yourself a SOUND BLASTER, there are several variations and they aren't that expensive but that will help. </s>
<s> Good luck!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> OK thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> I am going to look into upgrading my sound card. </s>
<s> Your soundcard is the hardware that's controlling the flow of audio. </s>
<s> The better and faster it is the clearer and stabler the sound will be </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> While a dedicated sound card can improve drastically, the sound quality, it still only sends out a low level signal. </s>
<s> Which will have to go to either self powered speakers, or a separate amp, (or a/v reciever). </s>
<s> I installed a Creative sound card, which goes to my a/v rec. </s>
<s> then to 6 speakers and a sub. </s>
<s> I use the optical output which is virtually noise free. </s>
<s> Plus the musical detail is great. </s>
<s> Two of my spkrs. </s>
<s> are Bose. </s>
<s> In short, the card only processes the signal. </s>
<s> no amp, no reciever. </s>
