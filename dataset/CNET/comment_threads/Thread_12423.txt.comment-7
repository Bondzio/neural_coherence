HI all just a update have taken the battery out and left the sytem without power for 5min power up and it said error on Cmos so i hit F1 to contiunie and now it wornt boot.
i have taken the CD drive out so there is only the HD connected but the thing still wont boot tried CS MASTER AND SLAVE but it just hangs with a black screen after post.
Started changing setting in the BIOS the only way it will boot is if i DISABLE &quot;SIL3512A SATA RAID ROM&quot; ???
i have tried the HD on CS and Master but unless its on SLAVE it wont boot and its the only drive connected to i IDE Any ways loaded windows super slow installed all the driver etc and its still slow egg timer etc open task manager and the CPU is sitting 5% is soon as i move the task bar window the CPU goes to 100% for a second and then idles i have ran the WD hardisk tool and it past all the S.M.A.R.T test so don't think its the HD I am about to run MEMTEST and see what that says Also checked for any blow CAPS and i cant see any leaks or swelling etc Checked temps from BIOS CPU V 1.53 RAM V 2.6V AGP V 1.45V 3.3V VIN 3.34 +5V VIN 4.91 +12V VIN 11.71 - 12V VIN (-) 12.03 5V SBVIN 4.81V VOLT BATTERY 3.20V PWM TEMP 61C CPU TEMP 48C SYSTEM TEMP 47C
