The hardware changed so much that XP may not boot due to chipset changes as well as it may want to reactivate. There is also a chance it may boot but need the XP CD to fetch a few files to support it's new home. Before you get upset, the Dell's that came with XP installed had a very limited license that restricted the OS to just that machine. Unlike the full retail license that would allow you to move between machines. The real fix is to fix the Dell proper. Bob
