Is not hard, just can cost us some coin.
For years I've fixed these by swapping out the parts (CPU, board, etc) until we find the bad part.
But that's the rough lesson for some new techs.
Once in a while you encounter the new tech that thinks it's some bug in XP.
If it was, then what would you do?
You found a workaround for the hardware so there are choices to either replace the parts or just let it stay with APIC disabled.
