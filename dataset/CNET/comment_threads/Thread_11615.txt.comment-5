Hey OG1337, Dude, I've been looking for a review of HP x20LED for days now, yours is the only 'kinda' review I found.
I've got a great deal on this but money's kinda tight so I gotta be sure.
Can you tell me a bit more about your experience with the x20LED, any shortcomings etc.
I'd be really grateful.
