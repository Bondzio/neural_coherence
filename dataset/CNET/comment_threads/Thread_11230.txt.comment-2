Well i see were ur getting at and i also thought about it but i also researched a lil, this is what i came up with: Sony is LOOSING money PER each PS3 they sell to keep the cost compeditive.
I'm guess-timating that for each PS3 they are puttin up ($100-300) dollars per each unit, Or they are getting one HELL of a deal on the components (excluding the Cell processor)
