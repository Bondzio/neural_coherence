it's basically just a mass storage device, so the connection of an external hard drive shouldn't affect the quality of your sound.
in any case, here are some things to check: * did this problem start immediately after you connected the external hard drive or was it down the road a ways?
* just to make sure, try unplugging the external hard drive and see if the problem remains.
* check that the speaker connection(s) is (are) firm...if a plug isn't in all the way it can cause distortion.
* try using a different set of speakers with the computer to rule them out.
alternatively, try connecting the speakers to a cd player, stereo, etc and see if the problem still exists.
* check device manager to see if there is an issue with the audio drivers.
* try downloading the latest software/drivers for your sound card from the manufacturer's website.
also, please include the following information about your setup: * basic pc specs, including processor and ram * operating system installed * sound card (make/model) * speakers (make/model) if there are details about your computer, such as sound card, that you don't know, the free program everest will help determine the specs.
