OEMS would require a new os to as the hardware is only compatible with the factory os.
Also, drivers aren't standard,and would need to be backuped prior to the installation of a new os.
As for the ocmpatibility, just make sure the powersupply motherboard cable (24-pin ,etc...) is the same on the motherboard.
I would highly not suggest upgrading the motherboard.
