<s> Hi Colleagues, I just procured and installed Nanostation M5 wireless AP, but noticed that introducing this device into my network (LAN) brings it down, thereby denying users of internet services. </s>
<s> Could there be a compatibility problem here? </s>
<s> Please help me out. </s>
<s> Since it doesn't work and they don't offer support, return it for something else. </s>
<s> I use routers as WAPs but a Wireless WAP is usually best if from the same maker of your router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Many thanks for your response. </s>
