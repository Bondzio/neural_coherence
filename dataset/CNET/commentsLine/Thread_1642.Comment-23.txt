i just went to that and reconfigured the pc to my standards, which aren't that high, nad the final price was just $2 dollars or less off of the compaq one.
and the compaq price is already including a new video card and power supply.
i'm not going to buy it just yet though, there's no possible way.
like i said before, i need 371 more dollars so there's plenty of time for something better to pop up.
until then though, my sights will be set on the compaq but please, keep suggesting people.
i'm afraid i may have failed to mention a few things i want on the computer: floppy drive cd/dvd burner 1 gb ram at least 100gb hd i don't care if it comes with a monitor or speakers.
in any case, i'll just buy one later when i have money, i mean, this monitor and speakers will still work.
