I was a jack*** for not doing my research and I am afraid the eBay seller is not going to refund my money....I have been reading that there is a way to connect a hub to a router/modem to router, but i want to know for sure how to do it with this crossover cable.
Also if anyone knows any way to connect like computer/360/PS2 to hub/router using crossover cable please comment.
PLEASE I am desperate!!
