....i'm breathless just from reading it.
as far as i can tell you have a coupla probs -- were both systems using the same version of windows (preferably xp) you could do simple internet connection sharing.
that would involve linking the internet connected computer to the older one with an ethernet cable and running windows ics.
whether this will work linking 98 and vista is an interesting one.
so your best bet is probably to buy a wireless adapter which has drivers for 98. personally, with a desktop machine i would buy a pci device, but usb will work.
the wireless adapter will allow the old machine to make a direct link to your wireless router without bothering the new machine.
however you will find that setting up a network connection is more difficult on 98 than it was with vista and i would suggest you get someone knowledgable to help.
though i had 20 years pc experience i had a software engineer friend set up my old 98 machine's wireless for me and it took some time and fiddling -- with xp i could set it up myself.
