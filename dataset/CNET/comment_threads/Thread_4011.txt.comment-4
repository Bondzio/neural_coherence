This forum is about hardware.
Your post has so little information that I can only offer vague fixes like reinstall the drivers, the OS, etc.
Remember this is all volunteer so you get to apply yourself to make great posts with all the needed details.
But as far as the hardware goes the only issue that I noted is done.
