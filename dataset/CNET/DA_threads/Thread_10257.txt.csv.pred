1.1.1	Hello All , I 'm using an Epson GT-S50 scanner on Win7 .	St
1.1.2	I need to scan long receipts , 3 & quot ; by 60 & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	The Epson only scans up to 34 & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	Is there a solution that does n't involve me buying another scanner ?	Ques
1.1.5	I 'm wondering if I can find a longer carrier sheet , then maybe I could use that ?	Ques
1.1.6	Where could I get a longer carrier sheet ?	Ques
1.1.7	Due to legal reasons , I ca n't cut the receipts , only fold them .	St
1.1.8	Folding them thus far has failed because the scanner thinks it 's two sheets of paper and tries to tear the receipt apart .	St
1.1.9	I tried a different scanning software , Vuescan , and that did n't work .	St
1.1.10	It scans so far and then indicates a paper jam .	St
1.1.11	Any solution needs to work quickly because I 'm only allowed to scan these receipts for a few hours , so I have to work fast .	Sug
1.1.12	Any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.13	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	And not one would deny entry because the copier only supported 11 x 17 paper .	St
1.2.2	It appears your legal reason needs crosschecking .	St
1.2.3	For now the solution is to use a CAMERA of sufficient pixels and crop it to size .	St
1.2.4	However those that think that scanning is the answer , with photoshop and more what proof is there that the scan is legit even if it was scanned in one piece ?	Ques
1.2.5	Hence the & quot ; legal & quot ; aspect crumbles .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	You hit the physical limitations of some device .	St
1.3.2	In most case std .	St
1.3.3	office devices may not suffice .	St
1.3.4	Not knowing what your funds are , it far better to ask the pros on this topic .	St
1.3.5	If this is a common request , then the solution is already known .	St
1.3.6	What , I have found is contacting commercial sources and/or business that deal with such needs and query there .	St
1.3.7	I offer that as while I 've fixed many PCs and devices there is a level of commercial needs that goes beyond what if part of the typical desktops .	St
1.3.8	There I 'm sure business offering the service and will allow to ask what can be had to fulfill the need in order to get your possible business .	St
1.3.9	Though you need not buy from them .	St
1.3.10	Are n't there any trade papers that offer such services/devices ?	Ques
1.3.11	tada -- -- Willy	St
1.4.1	I 've called a couple places but they involve bringing the paperwork to them .	St
1.4.2	Unfortunately , I can not do that .	St
1.4.3	This is a court case where in order to prove the business income , I have to go to the business and copy or scan the documents on site .	St
1.4.4	I 'm not allowed to cut or or otherwise manipulate the receipts other than to fold them .	St
1.4.5	If used a camera with a 28mm lens does anyone know if that would be readable ?	Ques
1.4.6	I could copy all the receipts with a commercial copier rental but that would be 5 pages per receipt and the cost would add up quickly .	St
1.4.7	Thanks .	Polite
