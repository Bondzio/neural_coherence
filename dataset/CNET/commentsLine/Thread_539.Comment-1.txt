i have a typcal cable modem with a belkin pre n wireless router, a main desktop, another desktop, both wired, two laptops linked wirelessly, and two identical desktops linked wirelessley.
i cannot get one of the wireless desktops to pick up an ip address.
i get the default address and the limitied connectivity warning when trying to connect.
i have switched everything between the two pcs with the same result (endlessly).
i have the mac address specified in the router, auto ip config and wpa set.
there is no firewall on the pc atthe moment.
out of patience!!
any thoughts?
?
