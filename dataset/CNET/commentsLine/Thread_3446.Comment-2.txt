given the over 70% thumbs down at  i continually am surprised that people try their luck with the 2004 version.
please don't expect me to fix symantec's mess.
in fact, i see no indication you called symantec.
what i would do?
if i have an application that fails i uninstall and reinstall it.
for me, this is easy.
others may need help.
as to the 2004 version, my advice is &quot;get a refund&quot; and get any other av other than mcafee.
again, you are not alone with this issue, but it's clear that 2004 is not a good year for symantec.
