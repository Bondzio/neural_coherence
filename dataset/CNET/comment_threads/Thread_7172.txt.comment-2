Have you upgraded your computer at all in two years?
If you haven't, I would suspect that you might need a new power supply to handle the video card.
According to Nvidia, you need a 550W PSU minimum with 2 6 pin power connectors.

I'm not 100% if that card would even work on your machine, but I would verify that before making a purchase.
