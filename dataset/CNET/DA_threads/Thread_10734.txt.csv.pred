1.1.1	Hi, I have a GeForce 4 Ti 4600, which has served me perfectly well in its aging years.	St
1.1.2	I updated the drivers to the 81.89 ones, which are not the WHQL certified or whatever.	St
1.1.3	Consequently, the next day I recived a nasty BSOD, in which Windows kindly told me it was my Driver.	St
1.1.4	I uninstalled it, tried to rollback, got drivers from 2001 Driver CD; nothing.	St
1.1.5	The BSOD's are gone, but the computer will not or cannot go to a higher resolution and produce 32bit colors.	St
1.1.6	Does anyone know where I might find the older drivers from nVidia, or an archive of them.	Ques
1.1.7	I admit that I should have cancelled the installtion, but I didn't thinking it would be ok.	St
1.1.8	Sadly, I cannot restore the computer, either.	St
1.1.9	If anyone knows where to get old drivers, it be a great help.	Ques
