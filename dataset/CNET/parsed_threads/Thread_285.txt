<s> hey was just wondering about a reccomendation for a router. </s>
<s> it's possible that i may have been able to get ahold of high speed internet for where i'm staying but now that brings up the question of which router to get. </s>
<s> i've seen a wired one that had a phone jack in it too so you could use a normal phone with skype and i'd like to get soemthing like that but also have wireless networking. </s>
<s> do you know of anything that does that? </s>
<s> The only one I have run across was a Linksys and was exclusive to Vonnage. </s>
<s> However, in looking, I did stumble across this: http://www.expansys.ie/p.aspx?i=132455 Not a big market yet, but I suspect this is going to grow tremendously over the nest few years. </s>
