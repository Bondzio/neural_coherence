This time we are considering to bring a tablet instead of our small notebook. We are a bit overwhelmed with all this different tablet models which are currently on the market. Maybe someone could give us advice for what kind of functions etc. we should look in a tablet. We would like to use the tablet for the following: In the offline modus (if we don't have Wi-Fi or not strong enough connection): - Transferring pictures from our camera's to external hard drive/USB stick (Camera's have SD card, might change if I buy a new camera) - Connecting external hard drive to tablet to watch movie's etc. - using a bit word/xls, for budget, lists and so on In the online modus: - Skype - Internet - Upload pictures to blog Tablet size: 7'' or preferable larger Weight: max 17.5 ounces/500g Camera: for Skype good Battery life Price: up to $500 Thanks Tinka

My guess is your tablet list will shrink so fast that this alone may make the choice for you. And if we entertain a wireless hard drive, you might launch into a dozen other questions. The online modus is something most if not all tablets that you read about (Kindle, Nexus, Samsung) do fine. What is &quot;good battery life&quot;? The life span of most batteries is set by the cycles. Most are 300 so if you charged daily I expect 2 to 3 years before replacement. If you are talking how long the tablet runs on a charge that gets you into the no one knows area since you can double the run time by turning off wifi, bluetooth and dimming the screen on most models. Turn everything on, GPS and push up the brightness and the time plummets. Bob

Sorry maybe stupid question; but how can we find out which tablets support hard drives? Is this related to the USB Port connection or to other functions? #good battery life: wasn't clear, yes I've meant once the battery is fully charged, for how long it will last (incl Wifi on)? Tinka

My office has a few tablets and on the Transformer with the dock it gets over 10 hours of use. But that's with items turned off when not in use. I could easily get half that with everything on and the brightness turned up. https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=which+tablets+support+external+hard+drives finds prior discussions and models so I defer to those answers.

Proffitt	3/6/13 7:52 AM	1.36255632E12	Reviews seem kind and highlight the issues with it.	http://www.amazon.com/HyperDrive-iUSBport-Wi-Fi-Storage-Wireless/dp/B009L7MD44 I own a WiDrive and it works fine too. But your average Joe might think it's a PITA to setup. Average Joe that just gets an iPad is a little stumped for a while too. So, a solution for many. -&gt; I also have a few EyeFi cards and in their direct mode, it's pretty cool. Bob
