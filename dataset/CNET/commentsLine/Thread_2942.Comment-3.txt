while you can put ink into the printer cartridges and seal them, the problem you will run into is the chip that is on the cartridge.
the chip needs to be reset.
while you can buy the chip resetter, it runs between $200-$600.
doesn't make it worth it for a home user.
there are reset printer cartridges out there for your printer.
you just need to look in the right places.
