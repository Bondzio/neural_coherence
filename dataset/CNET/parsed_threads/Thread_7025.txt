<s> My current desktop is old, slow and failing. </s>
<s> I need to buy a new one soon, but I can't afford a high-end system. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to connect a stereo to my new desktop to transfer old vinyl and cassettes to CD. </s>
<s> I would also like to transfer digital video from my computer to a VCR. </s>
<s> It seems everything I can afford has integrated audio and most have integrated video also. </s>
<s> If I buy such a system, can audio and video cards be bought and inserted later? </s>
<s> (I'm particularly interested in the audio in/out.) </s>
<s> Upgrading the audio in a system with integrated sound is somewhat easier then upgrading video with the same parameters. </s>
<s> A lot a integrated video motherboards do not offer an AGP slot to upgrade, but most have at least one PCI slot available for sound. </s>
<s> Yes, you can upgrade your audio and video on an integrated motherboard. </s>
<s> It is very easy to make those changes in the BIOS set up on your motherboard. </s>
<s> I purchased an integrated motherboard recently and didn't like the on board sound, so I disabled it and I am using a Sound Blaster Live card, which takes up one PCI slot. </s>
<s> The same thing can be accomplished with your on board video. </s>
