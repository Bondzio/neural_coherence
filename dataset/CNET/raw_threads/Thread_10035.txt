My office computer has a broadband internet connection wired from an antenna on the roof that picks up a wireless signal broadcast from a few blocks down the road. I would like to set up a wireless network inside my house to take advantage of this connection and the printer in the office with my laptop. What is the best way to set this up? The distance from the office computer to the laptop area in the house is about 125 feet with two exterior walls and several interior walls between. Both machines are Dells( Inspiron and Demension Series) operating with Windows XP Pro.
