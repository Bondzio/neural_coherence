<s> I am running an IBM 300PL 450mhz PIII with 256megs of RAM with WinXP and I am interested in the multiple monitors setup. </s>
<s> My current graphics card is an S3 Trident onboard VGA. </s>
<s> I've attempted to include the onboad output with a PCI card for the setup and also 2 PCI cards. </s>
<s> Each card when individually in use works fine, but when i attempt to use them in a multiple monitor setup, the computer says one is a [Code 10: The device does not work.] </s>
<s> My only explanation is that the bios wont let me have the setup cause the second card does not show up when i boot it. </s>
<s> The bios dates to 2001. </s>
<s> Any help would be GREAT. </s>

<s> &quot;My current graphics card is an S3 Trident onboard VGA.&quot; and that's about all we know about your hardware for the video. </s>
<s> Have you tried a dual output PCI card like a Matrox or a pair of things that others have seen working? </s>
<s> It's not a BIOS issue. </s>

<s> No, I have not tried a dual output, I've only tried a combination of PCI cards and I thought this should work because I know others who have used a setup like what Im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue? </s>

<s> I did have a few dual PCI card setups. </s>
<s> All were combos like a pair of ATI cards that had the needed dual display capable drivers or a pair of Matrox Millenium cards. </s>
<s> Been there, done that. </s>
<s> It's all in the cards and drivers. </s>

<s> Thanx, I'll work on it. </s>
