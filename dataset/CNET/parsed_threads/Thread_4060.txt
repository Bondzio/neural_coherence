<s> My present PSU is 250Watts - Is this enough power for my system described below? </s>

<s> This system has to be 3-4 years old, why are you asking this now? </s>
<s> Many systems from that time came with 250Watt power supplies and they were sufficient, more would be better, but if it has run for 3-4 years it probably was enough. </s>
<s> If you needed to replace it you probably want to get a 350-400 Watt PSU, but unless you are having problems you don't benefit changing out a power supply on such an old system. </s>
<s> personally, i'd go with a major upgrade of power supply if for no other reason than eventually you will need to so why not now. </s>
<s> if your system is running fine with your 250, then you may not need one, but any future system upgrades (especially upgrading that cold-molasses speed cpu) will probably require more juice. </s>
<s> You are right - I have had the PC for 4 years. </s>
<s> But I added the DVD RW and Second Hard Disk few days ago. </s>
<s> The shop assistant asked me whether I wanted a 400W PSU also. </s>
<s> I declined as I have already changed the original 200W PSU to a new one (250W P4 Ready)10 months ago. </s>
<s> Some people tell you 250Watts is enough others insist on something more powerful! </s>
<s> I just don't want to spend money on something not useful. </s>
<s> Thanks for your added input. </s>
