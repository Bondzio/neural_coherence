1.1.1	Sorry - aware that several previous discussions have tried to deal with similar issues ... .but the issues vary every time it seems !	St
1.1.2	I have a Fujitsu ( I think - nothing to tell me , and it was given to me new by another person ) Mobile DIsk external data storage USB device , 40 Gb .	St
1.1.3	Several days ago my computer ( with XP SP2 ) said it did not recognise it .	St
1.1.4	Previously it did .	St
1.1.5	I have tried the device on another computer and it installs immediately and functions , so there is nothing wrong with the device , which powers from the computer directly .	St
1.1.6	It powers up on mine , and everything indicates that the USB port is ok since I can plug in other devices ( eg flash ) .	St
1.1.7	Basic question - how does one resolve this kind of problem ?	Ques
1.1.8	I only have a recovery disk for the computer , not a separate set of XP cds , and I hesitate to go all the way back to scratch !	St
1.1.9	If I am correct , this is not a driver issue .	St
1.1.10	Then what kind of isse is it ?	Ques
1.1.11	Would going back to a restore point succeed ?	Ques
1.1.12	I tend to think not .	St
1.1.13	So ... .. ?	Ques
1.2.1	USB devices can be flaky and there 's no end to stories like yours .	St
1.2.2	I 've had a couple , however , that were resolved by simply going into the hardware screen , removing the device , restarting the machine and letting Windows redetect it .	St
1.2.3	It should have retained the driver and will reload it .	St
1.2.4	Now , it does sound as if your device needs more power than most .	St
1.2.5	Such could be the root cause of your issues .	St
1.2.6	What XP will detect is the controller for the drive and the controller will then configure the drive itself .	St
1.2.7	At this time , Windows should see the drive .	St
1.2.8	Can you tell if controller is seen but not the drive ?	Ques
1.2.9	These devices need a bit more current than most others and the lack of power from the 5v to the USB header might be a clue .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for quick response .	St
1.3.2	Minor joy but only because we are on the right track I think .	St
1.3.3	But I hope we can still take further steps , because ... .after doing what you suggested , the rebooted machine initially said it saw an unrecognised device , went through the motions to tell me it was installed then seconds later gave me the old message again .	St
1.3.4	My Asus computer has 6 USB ports - a mouse in one and the HD device in another .	St
1.3.5	Nothing else attached .	St
1.3.6	I presumed it might be the mouse it was recognising on the reboot .	St
1.3.7	I tried removing the two unrecognised USB devices ( that 's what the device manager said ) from the machine and going through the same process .	St
1.3.8	But while the mouse has no problem finding it 's way back , the other still does .	St
1.3.9	I think , in answer to your question that the controller is seen but Windows does n't see the drive and I 'm told anyway the device is unrecognised .	St
1.3.10	A minor annoyance is that my machine speaks Italian ( so do I , but I have to think what the actual terms are in English , so if my descriptions are not precise that will be the reason ) .	St
1.3.11	The quickest way to arrive at the device manager seems to be to double-click the balloon which tells me about an unrecognised device .	St
1.3.12	That brings up the device manager immediately , showing the items under the USB root hub ( 6 ports ) and highlighting one of them in bold .	St
1.3.13	Double-clicking that produces the general properties and driver tabs , the first telling me that no driver is installed for this device ( if I am translating that accurately ) .	St
1.3.14	The driver tab gives me a range of options including uninstall - which I did .	St
1.3.15	I hope that process was all correct .	St
1.3.16	AN option ot update the driver appears to be no help - where would I get it from ?	Ques
1.3.17	So that 's where I 'm at , at the moment .	St
1.3.18	Still without the use of the protable HD .	St
1.3.19	IF power is an issue , it was n't previously - the item worked perfectly on this same computer .	St
1.4.1	Here'w why .	St
1.4.2	If you mean that driver update button in Windows , that is nothing more than a demo from my experiences .	St
1.4.3	Better than 1/2 the time it results in degraded operations or failures .	St
1.4.4	Microsoft does not produce your PC and ca n't get this one right .	St
1.4.5	- & gt ; Use the drivers from your PC 's maker .	St
1.4.6	Please .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	The CD that comes with the HD device seems to be only appropriate for anything under Windows XP - in other words it does not seem to install the device for me , or put another way , the end result is still an unrecognised device !	St
1.5.2	And is the driver the problem ?	Ques
1.6.1	1 .	St
1.6.2	Update the driver .	St
1.6.3	I visit the motherboard maker 's web site for motherboard drivers .	St
1.6.4	2 .	St
1.6.5	Test the device .	St
1.6.6	I try it on another good machine .	St
1.6.7	Hope this helps you narrow it down .	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
1.7.1	In case others out there are still struggling with this vexing and msot annoying problem , the solution appears to be simple .	St
1.7.2	In the first instance , though , it has to be said that after googling my around the net for several days in search of help , it appears the problem with USB recognition being occasionally flakey is widespread .	St
1.7.3	2nd observation is that people try to be helpful but none of the solutions ( aand some are dire and dramatic like reformatting disks ) seem to work -- -- except one .	St
1.7.4	Close everything down , remove all peripherals ANDm importantly , remove the power supply .	St
1.7.5	Leave the computer for about 30 minutes so that all residual electricity goes out , then reboot .	St
1.7.6	Attach USB devices and other devices one by one - XP has been forced to restore all its drivers and away you go !	St
1.7.7	Well , it worked for me , and I 've read three other cases where it worked similarly ( which is where I got the idea from ) .	St
1.7.8	so why not try it ?	Sug
1.8.1	I have been trying for 2 weeks to fix my problem of the USB .	St
1.8.2	You have solved it for me .	St
1.8.3	Thanx heaps	St
1.9.1	Thanks for sharing your solution and I certainly agree that some of the USB stuff just is n't ready for prime time .	St
1.9.2	RE your statement 'remove all peripherals ANDm importantly , remove the power supply . '	St
1.9.3	Do you mean disconnect ( vice physically remove ) peripherals as in internal and external drives ( data and power ) and remove any cards from the MB , etc . ?	Ques
1.9.4	Physically remove PS or just discomnnect it from MB and or remove the AC power cord ?	Ques
1.9.5	Do you get a lot of question about getting into the case on getting everything back together ?	Ques
1.9.6	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	Had the exact same problem , suddenly the computer would not recognise ANY mass storage device - Mp3 player , PSP , ect .	St
1.10.2	I just unplugged everything from the back of the computer and left it over night .	St
1.10.3	No need to mess around inside the system , just took out all the leads .	St
1.10.4	Hey presto , all back to normal in the morning !	St
1.10.5	Thanks Heaps ! ! !	St
1.10.6	!	St
1.11.1	Had the exact same problem , suddenly the computer would not recognize ANY mass storage device - FreeAgent , SanDisk , Scanner , etc .	St
1.11.2	I also unplugged everything from the back of the computer and left it for a few hours .	St
1.11.3	After startup I replaced the USB connections one by one - problem solved .	St
1.12.1	HP 6110 All In One Running on XPSP2 Suddenly showed up as a non recognized USB Device Thought it was because I tripped over the cable and knocked out the USB cable from the machine and might have damaged the port .	St
1.12.2	But it wasnt .	St
1.12.3	As stated , deleted the HP from hardware .	St
1.12.4	Rebooted laptop , printer automatically showed back up .	St
1.12.5	Thank you !	St
1.12.6	MG in LA	St
1.13.1	thank you we need to give this solution some more google juice it took me forever to find it .	Polite
1.14.1	I purchased a 4GB PNY flash drive about three months ago .	St
1.14.2	Up until last week , it functioned OK even though it would constantly open when I carried it in my pocket .	St
1.14.3	Last week , it got bent while in our laptop computer 's USB port .	St
1.14.4	The plug will still snap closed , but I sometimes have to pry it out of the enclosure .	St
1.14.5	And for about four days now , when I plug it in the USB port of our laptop ( Windows 7 ) , I hear the sound that indicates the computer recognizes the device , but the device does n't appear in the list of removable media .	St
1.14.6	When I plug it into the desktop PC ( WinXP ) , I see the removable drive in the list of drives , but when I click on it , I get the message & quot ; Please insert a disk into drive [ letter ] : & quot ; Any way to recover what 's on this disk ?	Ques
1.15.1	wanted to let you know this worked for me as well	St
