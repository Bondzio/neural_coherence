Called Seagate and they said that reformatting is my only option. Also checked out a couple data recovery softwares to see if I could get my data back...but wanted to see if there was anything I could do to get the drive working to how it used to. The drive shows up in My Computer but I cannot access the files anymore....please help. I am running Windows XP Pro and also have a Mac at home. I was using the HD straight out of the box (FAT32 I believe)...just plug and play before...have all my data on it...please advise! Thanks in advance!

In XP Pro SP1 and SP2 the limit was raised to over 127GB (reference http://www.48bitlba.com ) Install the SP1 at least to see if the drive comes back. Also review http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=28919&messageID=328179 for solutions found there. -&gt; AND TRY THE BACK USB PORTS. Bob

It doesn't do 160GB drives	I am on SP1 and I used to be able to access this HD till a couple days ago...I'm going to review the posted solutions on the other forum and see it that works...Thanks for your response. I did try the back USB ports
