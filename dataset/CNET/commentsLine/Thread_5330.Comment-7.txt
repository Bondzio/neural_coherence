hello thank you very much for reply.
however you didn't read it all.... - ups has only four outlets, and all are battery-backed.
no surge-only outlets available.
- washing machine is small, portable model - 600 watts only.
- washing machine, tv, stereo and fan were connected only for testing purpose, one at a time, to see if the ups would work with them.
- battery is perfectly ok, after diconnecting computer i can restart ups, then reconnect computer, and use as if normal.
normally connected to the ups are computer, monitor, printer and power adaptor for external dsl modem.
problem occurs even when computer is alone connected - so problem must be with the computer.
kind regards.... thanh
