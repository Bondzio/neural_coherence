If the &quot;screen remains black&quot; then we're apparently not getting past POST.
Doesn't sound like PSU problem (brand new and plenty of headroom).
RAM that doesn't work with the mobo would be consistent with the symptoms, but ramarc is saying the RAM is compatible.
So go thru the rest of the list: CPU, mobo, or RAM is faulty, or things aren't plugged in correctly.
I'll reinforce the suggestion of taking it to a local shop.
There they'll be able to quickly test the components, and verify the assembly.
One of the smaller shops in my town I know would let you hover and learn while they work, particularly if you came during a slower time (mid-day weekday).
