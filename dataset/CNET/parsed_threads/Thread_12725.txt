<s> When trying to connect from my laptop to the network we set up on our D-Link router I get an error message that says &quot;Windows was unable to find a certificate to log you on to the network [SSID]&quot; My desktop that connects wirelessly and my roommates laptop do not experience this issue. </s>
<s> I've searched the web and found various solutions like unchecking the certificate in the SSID's properties and such. </s>
<s> The problem is though that in my list of wireless clients, the network does not show up as a WPA-PSK connection when it IS. </s>
<s> It shows the network and says (WPA) on my desktop, but this one has it configured as an open WEP connection. </s>
<s> If I go to the advance settings and try to manually enter it as a WPA and enter the password, it just wont connect. </s>
<s> I am COMPLETELY stumped as to why this wont work. </s>
<s> The internet works when I plug the laptop directly into the router, and when I remove security settings for the router. </s>
<s> Thing is... </s>
<s> I live in a heavily populated college area where everyone is trying to steal peoples' internet so I can't leave it unprotected. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated, I feel like I've tried EVERYTHING at this point. </s>
<s> (reinstalling my wireless network adapter software as well) thanks in advance </s>
<s> Oops, sorry. </s>
<s> It appears the details are missing. </s>
<s> sorry that was dumb of me it's a D-Link DIR-616 router I'm running Windows XP on the affected Laptop and the network adapter is a D-Link DWL-G630 also this computer and network adapter both work fine if trying to connect to any other wireless network so it's not like faulty hardware is an issue. </s>
<s> It looks like you set it up for a radius server. </s>
<s> But I can't tell yet. </s>
<s> Focus on the router and be sure the router firmware is the latest since I've seen this error where some machines connect and some don't. </s>
<s> The poor owner couldn't accept it was out of date firmware so they ended up paying 2 companies to come look. </s>
<s> The second one they let change the firmware. </s>
<s> They wanted a refund from us. </s>
<s> We said no. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't really know what that (router firmware) means or how to figure that out... we did JUST get the router though. </s>
<s> I saw the settings on my router for the WPA Enterprise thing that said it uses a RADIUS, but that was not the option we selected. </s>
<s> Also how would that explain the reason my desktop connects wirelessly and it doesn't support the certificate settings </s>
<s> It's busted for sure. </s>
<s> Sorry but you may have to catch up on the wifi terminology and that &quot;new&quot; units ship with outdated firmware to solve this one. </s>
<s> Again, been that, done that and people are very confused about why it works on one machine but not the other and to them it looks like magic when I update the firmware, set it up and it works. </s>
<s> Don't fret about it, people are making good money on this situation. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> how do I go about updating the firmware then? </s>
<s> I've never learned any of this stuff because I've never had a problem connecting before ever but I feel confident that I can do it... </s>
<s> I'm definitely frustrated and determined. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You've set it up our way at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 which includes updating the router. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You found google.com and what others had to say about that message. </s>
<s> If so, it's dead and needs to be seen by someone first hand. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Why would I not set up a router with the same name as your router (you elected to not share router details such as your SSID, firmware version, etc.) </s>
<s> so I could confound and confuse that person and maybe get them off the air? </s>
<s> I'd like to help but your post details are weak. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I didn't know anything about a firmware version until now. </s>
<s> my SSID is Three's Company and the firmware version is 2.3 </s>
<s> With some drivers. </s>
<s> Now go back to a simple 6 to 8 letter name with just ALPHA characters. </s>
<s> It's not a bug you find everyday. </s>
<s> http://www.dlink.com/products/support.asp?pid=565&pv=115&sec=0 notes a 2.23 but no 2.3. </s>
<s> I'd install their latest at 2.24 to make sure you have all the fixes they give us. </s>
<s> I'll use the manual from ftp://ftp.dlink.com/Gateway/dir615_revB/Manual/dir615_revB_manual_220.zip See page 76. </s>
<s> Is this the setting you used? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tried earlier plugging my laptop directly into the router and attempting to update the firmware. </s>
<s> I downloaded the latest version 2.24 and when I attempted to open the file on the router page to load the new firmware version, it didn't work and told me that the version I was attempting to upload may be corrupt and that the gateway would not be updated. </s>
<s> I will attempt to change the SSID to something more simple. </s>
<s> If downloads are showing up corrupt I'd be scanning that machine for: a) Download accelerators. </s>
<s> b) Limewire. </s>
<s> c) P2P programs. </s>
<s> d) Winsock hijackers (see our SPYWARE FORUM) and other things. </s>
<s> Good hunting. </s>
