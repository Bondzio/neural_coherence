My ATI 9600 256mb sapphire atlantis is running a lot slower than it is supposed to.
So i check out Catalyst Control center to see what my AGP speed is set at for my motherboard.
it is currently set at off.
so i try to change it to x8 which it is built for.
but, my system deems the change unsafe and sets it back to off.
is this a hardware problem or somthing i can do with software.
(i need to change the AGP speed to x8) please help
