Thanks for the reply.
The computer is brand new, out of the box so spyware shouldn't be an issue, and I can't believe the BIOS would be outdated already.
I think Dell is just pushing machines that aren't compatible with wireless adapter cards.
Anyway, I decided to compromise and use a USB adapter.
Not as fast but so much easier!
