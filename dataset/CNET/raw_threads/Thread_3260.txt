8532	0	584721	5419856	NR	julieismyname	2/3/13 7:39 PM	1.35992034E12	cursor jumping around-tab2	I have tried 3 keyboard apps so far (Samsung, kii, SwiftKey 3) and the cursor jumps around when I'm editing. With the stock keyboard it doesn't seem to be a problem but the keyboard is terrible so I'd like to try something else. I have been very careful to have nothing touching the screen and I don't have a cover on my tablet, not even a screen cover. Any idea what setting needs to be changed, or anything else I can do? Also, does anyone know how to calibrate a touch screen? Everything seems to be off by a row (swype, radio buttons). details : Samsung tab 2, and version 4.1.1 Thanks in advance for your help, Julie
