Finally saw that link you posted.
That was a fascinating video.
Thanks again for sharing.
I'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however.
I'd just like to use it for video IM, so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid, I don't think I'd mind.
I do appreciate your responses though.
