<s> I just installed an upgrade to my Norton 2005 anti-virus, the upgrade went fine but now my PC crashes constantly. </s>
<s> If I'm downloading something or the PC is running a programme, it'll crash about every 40 minutes or so. </s>
<s> Is there anything relating to the installation of the anti-virus software that could cause this? </s>
<s> I had installed McAfee Internet Security the day before and had HUGE problems so uninstalled it and reverted to the Norton package I had used without problems for the previous 12 months. </s>
<s> Could this have caused this issue? </s>
<s> I have Windows ME. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be great! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> But so little was noted about the hardware and why you suspect this to be a hardware issue. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>
