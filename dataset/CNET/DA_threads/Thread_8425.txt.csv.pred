1.1.1	I bought a K7S5A as new from a retailer back in September of 2005 .	St
1.1.2	Called up ECS and they said they will NOT warranty the board because it 's a discontinued board .	St
1.1.3	Unfortunately for me , the company I bought it from has gone out of business .	St
1.1.4	So , what am I supposed to do ?	Ques
1.1.5	I called ECS , but they do n't want to stand behind their products .	St
1.1.6	Anyone else have this kind of issue ?	Ques
1.1.7	I hope not !	St
1.1.8	Thanks Tim Shanks	St
1.2.1	can get the answser in writing .	St
1.2.2	Sure the board is bad ?	Ques
1.2.3	?	Ques
1.3.1	I had emailed them a copy of the invoice that I purchased the board on .	St
1.3.2	It even says on it that it has a 1 yr warranty .	St
1.4.1	it everywhere !	St
1.4.2	If not in writing , it 's just hearsay 'they said ' !	St
1.4.3	Then send it to PC World , PC Mag , the Better Business Bureau in the state where ECS ( USA ) is located and anyone and anywhere you can post it in user forums ... even on the ECS site if they support user comments .	St
1.4.4	Newegg is another place you might be able to post it ... just make sure you make it clear the problem is with ECS and NOT NEWEGG .	St
1.4.5	In the interim ..get another MB with a better mfg warranty .	St
1.4.6	Let us know if ECS mends their ways .	St
1.4.7	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	My requests and such were all sent via email .	St
1.5.2	Their response was via phone when they called .	St
1.5.3	Wonder if it would make a difference that the woman was hard to understand on the phone ?	Ques
1.5.4	After I got my response from ECS yesterday , I took and sent an email to their MB sales , and the corp sales email addresses .	St
1.5.5	Maybe someone in those departments can help .	St
1.5.6	It makes me wonder how many others are out there that have the same issue as I have ran into .	St
1.5.7	I can understand that if I did n't have the proof of purchase , that they would n't warranty their products .	St
1.5.8	And unfortunately , I do n't have the manuals anymore , but IF I recall correctly , I believe their warranty states ''1 yr from date of purchase '' .	St
1.5.9	Well , normally in the business/retail world , ''the customer is always right '' ... Must not apply to ECS ? ? ?	Ques
1.5.10	Thanks Tim	Polite
1.6.1	User was able to get the OS installed and running but the system would n't reliably find the HDDs during reboot/post .	St
1.6.2	ASUS furnished a replacement MB ( older revision ) but it did exactly same thing ... when the second MB went back ASUS said the they would n't replace it because of & quot ; user damage & quot ; .	St
1.6.3	Later at a PC show a vendor indicated that that specific MB was plagued with problems and they did n't carry it any longer .	St
1.6.4	The purchaser bought another brand MB ( MSI ) and the system booted up 'as is ' with installing any new drivers and ran the OS like the MB had never been changed .	St
1.6.5	My advice ... .pursue it 'til you get an answer in writing .	St
1.6.6	The written word is hard evidence ... the spoken word is easily misunderstood and denied .	St
1.6.7	Let us know VAPCMD	St
