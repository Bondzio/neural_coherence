Hi, My CD-RW has suddenly stopped writing CD's. It was working alright about 3 weeks ago, when I last wrote a CD. Whenever I try to burn some file on it the progress bar stops at 5% and then I get a error where I am told about some session fixation error. I've already lost about 5 cds because of this error. I've never had this problem before. If it is of any interest, I recently upgraded my laptop RAM from 256 Mb to 640 Mb. Please help. Thank you, Varun
