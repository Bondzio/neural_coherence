only go with amd phenom if you can't afford the core2quad.
notice that the phenom 9600 is behind the q6600 in practically every gaming benchmark:        add the fact that the q6600 can be easily overclocked to 3ghz (or higher) with practically any p35 mobo while the 9600 will struggle to hit 2.8ghz and the gulf is even larger.
