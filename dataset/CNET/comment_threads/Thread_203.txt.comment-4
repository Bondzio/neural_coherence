So I should put the modem in bridge mode, go get a router and hook it up to the modem?
How exactly can I get the modem into bridge mode?
Can I get some details at exactly what bridge mode is?
I do need to buy a wireless router anyways, as I have more than one computer that's needing internet at the same time.
Also.
If I went out and got the exact same modem directly from a retailer instead of through ATT/Yahoo, will I be able to use it to it's fullest capabilities?
Thanks a bunch, I know these questions are pretty basic and tedious in nature, and I really appreciate the help : )
