I'm throwing to much money into anti virus programs that aren't doing the job. I need to to scrub the hard drive and start over fresh. Can you recommend a product that can be effective and information on operating system installation? Thanks!

They also have a D partition on the hard drive that has a recovery program. There are several free programs such as Rkill, Malwarebytes, Superantivirus and others that don't cost anything except the price of a blank CD and the time to run them. There are free antivirus programs you can download and run, just Google &quot;Free Antivirus programs&quot; and choose one. Some ISPs will give you free antivirus programs just for subscribing to their service. In my case I am with Comcast and they supply Norton 360v5 at no charge.

In other words, once you're certain the PC is clean, then run the AV pgm. against any offloaded stored media to scan and cleanse them as well. Here's what I do when all else fails and get the go ahead to do a total wipe out or cleaning. Using DBAN or KILLDISK, totally wipe clean the HD. Once done, using the recovery discs to return the PC back to day 1 -OR- the day those back-ups were created. Do a full OS reload, any drivers and then OS updates from service. Install or run the AV pgm. after its own update to check and verify the PC. Finish the PC recovery by installing at that time any pgms. not reloaded or user supplied. if you have data, return it to its proper directories. If all this is from ext. HD or flash drives these have already been AV scanned, otherwise you may introduce the virus back again. Don't take anything for granted, scan to check. Lesser infections may not need a total rebuild as it were but the &quot;time and effort&quot; usually become just as long or intensive. Sometimes, you're reward for shortcuts is finding out you really didn't remove the virus. However, if the infection is known and following any online posted help many times allows an user to continue in good health. Afterwards, be careful of how you possibility got infected in the 1st place, maybe some email, loaned disc, borrowed ext. media or P2P access like Torrent, etc.. tada -----Willy
