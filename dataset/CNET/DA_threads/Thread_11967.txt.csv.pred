1.1.1	I'm new to this, so bear with me, please.	St
1.1.2	My mom just got a digital camera (an HP Photosmart M420) with a Lexar 256MB SD card, and she took it to Las Vegas.	St
1.1.3	While she was there, the camera displayed the message, &quot;CARD HAS THE WRONG FORMAT.	St
1.1.4	Press OK to format card.&quot; When I press OK, it says, &quot;Unable to format card.&quot; So, I put the card in my computer (it has an internal card reader) and it will not even recognize that there IS a card in the slot.	St
1.1.5	The same happens with external card readers and other digital cameras.	St
1.1.6	I realize that the card is probably shot, but I'm trying to figure out a way to recover the images/videos from her vacation.	St
1.1.7	I downloaded Lexar's Image Rescue, but it apparently won't work if the card can't be recognized.	St
1.1.8	Is there anything I can do?	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance.	St
1.1.10	I appreciate it.	Polite

1.2.1	Here's HP's link for the topic: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/fastFaqLiteDocument?docname=c00038738&lc=en&cc=za&dlc=za Surf for more details there.	St
1.2.2	Also, I suggest you stick with the camera format itself rather than the PC side.	St
1.2.3	If this recent purchase, then contact HP and allow them to correct or replace memory card.	St
1.2.4	Cards can be corrupted for various reasons and not to exclude a bad memory card to a &quot;new user&quot; .	St
1.2.5	tada -----Willy	St
