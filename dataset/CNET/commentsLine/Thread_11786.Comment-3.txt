hey samkh, thanks, i'll try 2 hybirds in my laptop.
i'm a photoshopper so i have both a separate windows paging partition and a photoshop/premiere scratch disk on separate spindles from their respective programs.
i'm also a big fan of &quot;ready boost&quot; and i have a 4gb lexar jump lightning flash drive velcroed to my battery.
i'm always short of storage and have multiple external backup drives, so i got exited over tigers offer of $99 for a seagate momentus 2.5&quot; 750gb's @ 7200 rpm and was planning on 2 of those till i saw the hybird 500gb @ 7200 rpm.$119 new egg or $169 direct from seagate-i'm thinking &quot;latest firmware&quot; here....... currently i'm running 2 320 gb momentus @ 7200 rpm and i'm running out of room.
one additional question; my preference for partitioning hd's wont affect anything with the 4gb built in flash memory in the hybird will it?
raymond
