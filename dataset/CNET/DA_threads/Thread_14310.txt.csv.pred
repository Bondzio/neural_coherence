1.1.1	I have a Compaq Presario with an 1.4GHz Intel Celeron Processor .	St
1.1.2	It is equipped with a Realtek Ethernet and a Broadcom 802.11b/g WLAN .	St
1.1.3	Until yesterday I was able to connect to any available network but now the system fails to connect and gives the following message : & quot ; make sure the wireless switch on your computer is on & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	I heard this problem is not uncommon but I have no idea what to do .	St
1.1.5	Can anybody help , please ?	Ques
1.2.1	Hey there augusto1940 , At this point it could be one of many things .	St
1.2.2	Let 's start with a few questions , going from most obvious to least obvious -- you never know what it might be : 1 ) Does your Compaq have a wireless on/off button ?	Ques
1.2.3	Typically there are two types : a toggle switch ( which could have been toggled merely by friction in your laptop case ) , or a function key ( usually activated by pressing the Fn key plus one of the F keys ) .	St
1.2.4	2 ) Have you tried right-clicking on the wireless network icon and hitting & quot ; Repair & quot ; ?	Ques
1.2.5	3 ) Has your laptop been dropped , bumped , or suffered any other kind of impact ?	Ques
1.2.6	4 ) Have you recently installed driver updates , via MS Automatic Updates or otherwise ?	Ques
1.2.7	5 ) Has your wireless card been disabled ?	Ques
1.2.8	You can check by looking at the & quot ; Network Connections & quot ; section in Start & gt ; Settings .	St
1.2.9	6 ) Does your Compaq have any kind of & quot ; smart features & quot ; , such as automatic deactivation of the ethernet and/or wireless card when the machine goes on battery power ?	Ques
1.2.10	This is a rather troublesome feature that I 've seen on Dell laptops ... HTH , Red .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	I have tried most of what you are recommending .	St
1.3.3	I toggled the Fn key with F2 with no result .	St
1.3.4	I also tried the repair process but the outcome is still the same message .	St
1.3.5	I have not run the windows update recently since I have no internet connection .	St
1.3.6	The laptop has suffered no bumping or other damage .	St
1.3.7	Any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.4.1	Hi again augusto , Looks like it 's time to roll up the ol ' sleeves and get dirty .	St
1.4.2	Here are a couple more things you can try : 1 ) Check out the Device Manager under the Hardware tab of your System settings ( Right-click ''My Computer '' and hit Properties ) .	St
1.4.3	2 ) Check if there are any pre-existing diagnostic tools on your compaq .	St
1.4.4	If there are , they may be useful to detect a hardware failure .	St
1.4.5	If you do not have diagnostic tools on your system , you may want to check the compaq website from another computer , download them to a USB disk and try them out from your laptop .	Sug
1.4.6	3 ) If those two things check out , one thing you could try is to use a portal operating system to see if the problems are software- or hardware-related .	St
1.4.7	Using slax or Bart PE , try connecting to the wireless network .	St
1.4.8	You can get them by googling for them ( from another PC , of course ) .	St
1.4.9	Just thought of one more possibility : do you have iPass on your computer ?	Ques
1.4.10	I have a user who had just recently downloaded an update of the iPass client and , when he 'd try to connect to his home LAN , would be unable to do so because iPass taking precedence over his wireless zero config ... Take care , Red .	St
