1.1.1	Hi , I 'm really new to computers and graphics cards and what not .	St
1.1.2	What is considered a good framerate .	St
1.1.3	For instance , I have a P4 3.0ghz with ATI RADEON x600 and I get around 28-30 fps on half life 2 , it 's played around medium .	St
1.1.4	There is no lag , but the graphics look awesome anyhow .	St
1.1.5	Once I get around 25 fps , its starts to lag .	St
1.1.6	I 've never seen a game on HDTV with a high end machine , so I 'm wondering , is the difference really noticeable ?	Ques
1.2.1	The fps dropping usually means that you are in a section of the game where a lot of things are happening and your computer is working hard to keep up .	St
1.2.2	When you play a section of the game where the fps drops and you feel the computer is lagging , does the lag happen if you replay that section ?	Ques
1.2.3	If it does then it is a section in the game that your computer is having a hard time keeping up .	St
1.2.4	The fix would be to upgrade the computer , maybe more RAM , better video card , and faster HDD .	St
1.2.5	If it does not follow this pattern then you may have a background task happening durring the game play that is slowing your computer down .	St
1.2.6	Investigate what is running in the back ground such as a anti-virus program , an auto update for some program and maybe even a virus or adware program is messing around .	St
1.2.7	See what you can turn off .	St
1.2.8	I believe that Half Life 2 has a FAQ you can check with that can advise you on this subject .	St
1.2.9	I have read reviews of video cards that run at 70 fps so yes 28-30 maybe slow but I have played on some older system with frame rates as low as 18 and still had fun .	St
1.2.10	Short answer is YES it is noticeable .	St
1.3.1	hd pc gaming is reallllllly new .	St
1.3.2	only a handful of video cards can run hd , and i havent kept up but i dont know of any pc games that run hd ( im probably wrong though ) .	St
1.3.3	hd gaming is mainly in the realm of xbox 360 and the ps3 .	St
1.3.4	as for hl2 .	St
1.3.5	its kind of old and the graphics arent bleeding edge any more .	St
1.3.6	even fear is lagging behind but its still a system hog .	St
1.3.7	hl2 is one of the most optimized games iv come across therefore it isnt all that demanding .	St
1.3.8	if i were you i would def do some upgrading if you have the money .	St
1.3.9	online play is usually more demanding so if you plan on getting into that it would be a good idea to upgrade to something that can get the job done a little better	St
1.4.1	look @ oblivion , f.e.a.r. , half life , ghost recon , doom , flight sim x , unreal turnament , quake 4 , plent of games ... all u need basicly is a sweet ass system and a good game with good graphics	St
1.5.1	thats such a crappy gaming rig i get 130+ fps in fear full settings @ 1440x900 without vsync on , i dont have an hd display but im pretty sure hd doesnt make that much difference in fps id get maybe up to 90+ fps on 1080p but its pointless since the humen eye sees at 75 fps average .	St
1.5.2	i play all my games @ 75 fps locked , it looks better i wander why	St
1.6.1	na , there is no lag whatsoever .	St
1.6.2	I just started learning how to build a computer and later on I 'm hoping to spend around 3 grand to build one , but I researched around and the highest gaming machine will cost around 6-7 grand , which is why I think the XPS 710 H2C is a good deal since they overclock it and what not .	St
1.7.1	Over the years I have seen the hottest gaming computers become outdated within 1 to 2 years .	St
1.7.2	I tend to wait till I find a game that offers something new that makes me got ta have it .	St
1.7.3	Then I look into what I need to run the new game flat out .	St
1.7.4	Usually , I find that I can run it on a computer I have and then I play the game and see if the sparks dont fade .	St
1.7.5	If I still got ta have it than I build .	St
1.7.6	I bought 1 computer with the idea of it being very hot .	St
1.7.7	I had it custom built to order .	St
1.7.8	In 6 months it was old hat because the industry jumped to new slot design for the video slot ( PCI was dumped for AGP ) .	St
1.7.9	Right now Im waiting to see if the dual core CPUs are trashed due to a new cooling scheme which is done inside the chip that may make single chip design cheaper and faster than dual core hot design of today .	St
1.7.10	On top of the dual core focus issue I cant find a comfort point with the new Vista OS .	St
1.7.11	I got the changing tech blues .	St
1.8.1	What is linux & do you know of free BSD ?	Ques
1.8.2	From what I know these app.s accomodate multiple o/s and might be useful gaming platforms - from what I know ...	St
1.9.1	I put a Linux version on an older pc as a way for me to get a feel for it .	St
1.9.2	The deeper I get the less I like what I find .	St
1.9.3	Anything Linux seem to lead to out of step position in terms of game play .	St
1.9.4	I have not given up on it but at this point I 'm working through a 3 inch thick book on .	St
1.9.5	I had some success with a live CD version but still do n't have a comfort point with it .	St
1.9.6	Have you ever gone to Linuxgames.com ?	Ques
