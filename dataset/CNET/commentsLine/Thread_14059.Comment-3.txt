windows xp home edition has the 127gb limitation which you must obey since there is an issue you don't want to learn about first hand.
go ahead and clone the drive but don't increase drive c past 127gb.
if your machine came with windows xp home edition sp1 or windows xp home edition sp2 then this is not an issue.
