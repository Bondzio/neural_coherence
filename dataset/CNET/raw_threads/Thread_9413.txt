From new Egg Model: AMD Athlon XP 2400+ Core: Thoroughbred. This is your CPU. Not supported by M/B. Key word CORE. M/B supports Athlon/Athlon XP/Duron core. As Intel and AMD improves function on the existing CPU, its core, they give it a new model name. Pins may be the same but not the internal working parts. Did this help or just muddle things up?

You are asking me to back up your decision. Not going to. I will assist you to find the answers. But not do the research. Bill Other members, join in, need help. . .

I have a copy of the Model 10 Data Sheet. All of the design type documents are available as PDF downloads from AMD and Intel. The 2600 Barton Model 8 [333MHz] showed a frequency 0f 2088 MHz where the thoroughbred Model 8 2600+ [same name] was 2133. Now the model 10 Barton [2500+]the Model 10 shows 2133. Not sure but I think the Model 10 vs Model 8 is a different width artwork. I have the entire PDF on the computer, only printed oiut a couple of key pages. Maximum Model 10 2500+ power consumption is 68.3 Watts, typicsl 53.2.
