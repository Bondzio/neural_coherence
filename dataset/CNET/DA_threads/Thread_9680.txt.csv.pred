1.1.1	It 's pretty difficult right now to decide if to go with either the FX 57 or the XP 4800 .	St
1.1.2	On one hand the FX 57 blows the XP 4800 when it comes to gaming ( single application ) but on the other pretty soon games will start taking advantage of the Dual Core .	St
1.1.3	For gamers like me the bottom line is , Frames Per Second , but if the games start taking advantage of dual core procesors I presume that then the single cores will run them a lot slower .	St
1.1.4	The question is , at this time , what 's better ?	Ques
1.1.5	Will the gaming industry start taking advantage of the dual core soon , or will it take another year or two ?	Ques
1.1.6	Is it better to buy the XP 4800 and wait for the games to come out , or get the FX 57 and possibly have to replace it in one year ?	Ques
1.1.7	Is the difference in performance large enough to choose the FX 57 ?	Ques
1.2.1	Hey , you got a spare grand laying around , I 'd wait .	St
1.2.2	As FX-60 is coming out soon , Januaryish , as is the higher X2 's .	St
1.2.3	All , in all : The FX-57 will almost always win with the games , AT THE MOMENT .	St
1.2.4	I assume multi-threaded games will be out , or at least a few before the of 2006 .	St
1.2.5	I 've been browing around AMDZONE and they are saying that an overclocked X2 could easily be better than their single-core counterparts .	St
1.2.6	Again , I 'd wait in January for the new processors ... .. Look for some benchmarks then , and take your pick .	St
1.2.7	You may need a few more dollars though , as they are saying the price may be over 1k .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	the FX-57 is better for gaming .	St
1.4.2	The X2 is for multi-tasking purposes , but do n't get me wrong the X2 is good for gaming ; the 57 is better .	St
1.5.1	the FX-57 is a great processor made by AMD , and i would say if your into gaming , to go with the FX .	St
1.5.2	AMD uses its power more efficiently and if you go with dual core , well thats just awesome !	St
1.5.3	the only problem with double core is the price ... i saw places running the FX-57 up to $ 2000 , but its an investment , and i suggest you do some research on some processors ... you never know what new chips will come into play .	St
1.6.1	For now yes the 57 dominatesm but the 4800+ can help you alot more with running multiple applications .	St
1.6.2	Companies are going to take advantage of dual core processors .	St
1.6.3	Also as said in a previous post , in lines of processors are coming out , which most liely means price break for you .	St
1.6.4	So I suggest you wait .	Sug
1.6.5	Although the 57 will get you more fps , the 4800 still has far more useful value .	St
1.7.1	My bad .	Polite
1.7.2	I suck at typing and am very slow at it .	St
1.7.3	I always look at the keyboard and not the screen , so I never spellcheck .	St
1.7.4	So here is the post : For now yes the 57 dominates the games more than the 4800 , but the 4800 can help you alot more with running multiple applications .	St
1.7.5	The gaming industry is going to take advantage of dual core processors .	St
1.7.6	Also as said in a previous post , new lines of processors are coming out , which most likely means price break for you .	St
1.7.7	So I suggest you wait .	Sug
1.7.8	Although the 57 will get you more fps , the 4800 still has far more useful value and does great on games .	St
1.8.1	what other sites besides this one do you guys use to get news and adivce ?	Ques
1.8.2	i 'm looking to buy a PC this week but the wait till Jan talk is further stressing me out	St
1.9.1	I 've decidedto go with single core .	St
1.9.2	Since my main purpose is gaming and all arrows point out that the FX is a better choice for gaming , at least for the time being and for the next year .	St
1.9.3	Now ... anyone knows when the FX-60 is coming out ?	Ques
1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	CNET , of course ; AMDZONE , Tom 's Hardware , just some general browsing of a product will reveal sites specific to that product .	St
1.11.2	What kind of PC , and budget , are you looking for ?	Ques
1.11.3	~Ibrahim P.S .	St
1.11.4	Best to start a new thread , though .	St
