<s> I am trying to network 5 computers running windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> I am attempting to connect them through a dlink switch. </s>
<s> I can't get the computers to see or access the other computers. </s>
<s> I have run the network set-up wizard many times. </s>
<s> I have tried creating a new connection. </s>
<s> I have tried with static IP and dynamic. </s>
<s> I have gone in and enabled NetBIOS over TCP/IP in the connection properties. </s>
<s> I have setup several other networks sucessfully and have no idea what I am doing wrong. </s>
<s> Any help will be appreciated. </s>

<s> Your IP plan and what firewalls are installed. </s>
<s> Hint: Some firewalls have a disable but still function while disabled so be sure yours has a true off setting. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't know that I have an IP Plan. </s>
<s> The only firewall currently installed is the Windows firewall. </s>
<s> This network will probably not have internet access. </s>
<s> Mike </s>
<s> Without you implementing an IP PLAN such as setting the addresses or having a router with DHCP, the networking should be less than happy. </s>
<s> Try assigning 192.168.0.10 to the first machine, 192.168.0.11 to the next and so on. </s>
<s> -&gt; I don't duplicate web content on how to set this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks... </s>
<s> I'll give that a try. </s>

<s> If you have set up a network successfully before, the switch may be faulty. </s>
<s> Check windows firewall running on all those 5 winxp pcs. </s>
<s> Its blocking ping/other protocols. </s>
<s> Regards, Mangesh </s>
<s> I will check the firewall this evening. </s>
<s> However,I thought the process of running the network set-up wizard was supposed to set the firewall properly. </s>
<s> As fo the IP setup I have it set this way..Am I correct? </s>
<s> Main system: IP: 192.168.0.2 Subnet 255.255.255.0 Default gateway: 192.168.0.2 Preferred DNS: 192.168.0.2 Second Machine; IP: 192.168.0.3 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.0.2 Preferred DNS: 192.3168.0.2 I have also enabled NetBIOS over IP. </s>
<s> I am connecting the computers through a DLink switch Model DES1105. </s>
<s> Note that this is a new Switch being used to connect the computers. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, Mike </s>
<s> Did you install a DNS (server) on that machine? </s>
<s> And also, why is that a gateway machine? </s>
<s> Is there some router software on it? </s>
<s> Also, I noted to start at 192.168.0.10 While I can't write everything in this small space, the reason is that if you installed some router later, starting at 10 could avoid some headaches. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No real good reason....just trying to work this out. </s>
<s> Now if the default IP address of the switch is 10.90.90.90; Should I use that as the gateway and DNS address. </s>
<s> Also, should I use IP's in the range of say 10.90.90. </s>
<s> * If so, should the subnet be 255.0.0.0 ?? </s>
<s> I seem to have just enough knowlege to have gotten myself into troube here and can't seem to get out. </s>
<s> Thanks for the Help, Mike </s>
<s> Ok..I've made a little progress but still not working properly. </s>
<s> Here's where I am.... </s>
<s> Trying to connect 2 computers (ultimately 5 computers)through a DLink switch Computer ''A'' is XP Pro Staic IP: 192.168.0.10 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Computer ''B'' is also XP Pro static IP: 192.168.0.11 Subnet mask: 255.255.255.o I have run the windows network setup wizard on both machines. </s>
<s> If I open ''My Network Places'' on computer ''A'' I am able to see Computer ''B''. </s>
<s> I am also able to access the folders and files in the shared files folder of computer ''B'' from computer ''A''. </s>
<s> However.. </s>
<s> When I open ''MY Network Places'' on computer ''B'', I do not see computer ''A''. </s>
<s> If I click on ''View Workgroup Computers'' I am able to see Computer ''A''. </s>
<s> But when I click on the Icon for Computer ''A'' I receive an error that states ''\\Computer A is not accessible....'' I don't understand why I can access one computer but not the other. </s>
<s> Any help is again greatly appreciated, Mike </s>
<s> What I suggested would ease the migration if and when you installed a router. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>
<s> It seems you need to think more about why you put in a DNS and GATEWAY setting. </s>
<s> Nothing in your posts suggests these are proper. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> There is no matching &quot;account&quot; on some machine. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A firewall is active. </s>
