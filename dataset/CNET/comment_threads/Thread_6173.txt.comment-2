It should be located on the motherboard.
Ususally at the front side of the case, at or near the bottom of the board.
Mine has a double row of small pins for various things to plug in.
The power switch, hdd led, case speaker, etc.
It should be printed on the board &quot;pwr&quot; or something similar.
If you have the manual that came with the computer, there should be a diagram of the motherboard with this information in it.
Good Luck.
