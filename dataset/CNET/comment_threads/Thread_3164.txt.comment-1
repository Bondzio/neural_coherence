I have a Dell Vostro 1500 and I have AT&T wireless internet in my house.
My other computers and Roku connect with no problem, but mine even though it says it is connected, is not connected.
I have Windows XP the other computer is Vista and the desktop is also XP.
Even AT&T came over the house and said something is wrong with the computer.
Can anybody help me.
