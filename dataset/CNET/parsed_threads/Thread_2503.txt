<s> I am interested in purchasing a MC PC. </s>
<s> I would like to place it in my living room in a networked environment to replace my DVD player, home stereo, PVR, and theatre while also serve as a home computer for burning CD's, productivity, and occasional gaming. </s>
<s> What is the image quality for watching TV, DVD's, etc? </s>
<s> Are they easy to use and intuitive in design? </s>
<s> I am considering at systems running Microsoft XP MediaCenter OS. </s>
<s> It looks as though Gateway's 901x is the front runner at this point, but Shuttle also makes a model interesting as well. </s>
<s> Any experiences, info, or opinions are appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, -Shawn </s>
<s> I have a Gateway Media Center PC. </s>
<s> I love it. </s>
<s> Can't even begin to tell you how cool it is. </s>
<s> If you want the specs let me know. </s>
<s> Oh yeah I bought it at Costco and it is a special package you can't get anywhere else, not even Gateway. </s>
<s> The Media Center is a fun thing to have. </s>
