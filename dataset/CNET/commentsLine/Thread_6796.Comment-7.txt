tried your fix using bcdedit/loadset loadoptions disable_integrity_checking.
no luck.
iomega loads their drivers and puts their icon on the drive but it can't be accessed even from an admin prompt.
everytime after the driver program runs i get a message that an entry point could not be accessed for version.dll as i say the moderator of the iomega forum on zips says only usb version will work but you look on iomega's wesite (as someone noted above) and iomega claims that an atapi (internal) zip will work in vista.
if they can't write a driver to enable our atapi zips in vista, iomega should swap us out a rebuilt usb zip for our atapi.
that would be a measure of whether they care about their customers or the allmighty dollar.
