I installed a new hard disk and wanted to go with a clean install of everything due to a couple of simple program problems, so I did not just copy everything from my old disk over to the new disk.
I copied my window 98 folder (which had a copy of my 98se in it over) from my old disk to the new disk and then ran setup, this way both disks have the exact same operating system.
When I boot from my old disk everything is just fine, modem works great, but when I boot from my new disk everything is great except for my modem.
I have a Creative Labs Modem Blaster Flash 56 PCI DI5 (DI15630-3).
The instll new modem does not find the modem, I have copied files from old disk to new one, down loaded new drivers but I still can not get the modem to work.
On the old disk the modem is set on Comm 2 but I can not get the new disk to search for a comm 2 on my computer.
I have searched all files and settings that I know of on my old disk to copy to the new disk but nothing works.
I am completly lost.
Can anyone help me out.
