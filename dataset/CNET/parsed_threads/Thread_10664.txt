<s> I know a little about computers but almost nothing about networking, so I apologize in advance if this is a foolish question. </s>
<s> My wife has a laptop with built-in wireless capability. </s>
<s> Right now it is wired (ethernet cable) to a cable modem for internet access. </s>
<s> She'd like to be able to use it anywhere in the house, without being restricted to using it where the cable modem is; nothing fancy, just basic internet access. </s>
<s> All the wireless routers seem to require that one PC/laptop be wired to the router, and then other computers can connect wirelessly, but we only have the one laptop at home. </s>
<s> Is it possible to set up a system with just one computer connecting wirelessly? </s>
<s> Bonus points: can it also be set up so she can print from anywhere in the house? </s>
<s> Any advice, suggestions, specific equipment recommendations, etc., would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Ease of installation/use is obviously important. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Some settings and especially firmware updates require you have a wired connection. </s>
<s> Once its setup, you don't need the wired connection. </s>
<s> As to printing. </s>
<s> Some routers have printer support, some don't. </s>
<s> And with one laptop, why not put the printer where it's used most? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Even if the router does not support a printer, there are print servers available at prices from about $40 up. </s>
<s> Just get one whose printer connection is compatible (USB or parallel). </s>
<s> As Bob said, it would be convenient to have the printer located where it would the laptop is used most. </s>
<s> This may or may not be where the router is located (if you have cable internet service the router and modem will be located near a cable outlet, but you may want the printer somewhere else). </s>
<s> If the printer is to be near the router, use a wired print server; if the printer is remote, use a wireless print server. </s>
<s> With respect to the requisite wired connection; first connect yoour laptop to the router by wire. </s>
<s> Download the latest firmware for the router, and go through the setup procedure. </s>
<s> Then you should be able to unwire the laptop and use it anywhere in the house. </s>
<s> Whenever you wish to change settings or download newer firmware or drivers, simply connect again by wire. </s>
