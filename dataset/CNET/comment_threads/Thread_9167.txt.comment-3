I was hoping to get a response from you.
Right now I have been using the &quot;Jazz&quot; setting on the Equalizer.
It's the one that sounds the best when using the included Ipod headphones.
I have been shopping around for &quot;in ear&quot; bud headphones, but do not know which ones to get.
Any suggestions?
Thanks again, CHUSITO1975
