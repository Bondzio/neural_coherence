<s> G'day guys I am having some serious dramas with a Hard drive which will just not be recognised by another computer. </s>
<s> The Hard drive was a master in the first computer which the motherboard has just died in. </s>
<s> The Copacitators have started to leak in the motherboard. </s>
<s> I tried to change the hard drive to another computer and make it a master in that one as well. </s>
<s> When the computer searches for IDE drives in the boot up, it just stops there and doesn't go any further. </s>
<s> I thought it must have been something to do with the jumpers on it, once i pulled it out there are a whole lot of different settings compared to a normal hard drive, it has both 16 and 15 head options as master, slave and cable select. </s>
<s> It is a Deskstar hard drive. </s>
<s> If anyone could help me with this it would be apreciated. </s>
<s> I am worried that if i do buy a new motherboard i will have the same problems and i will then have to buy a new hard drive as well. </s>
<s> The model of the hard drive is an IBM Deskstar ic35l040avvn07-0 if that is any help. </s>
<s> I have it set as a master on 16 heads. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>

<s> Another thing is that when i have the hard drive plugged in i cant even make it into bios. </s>
<s> I am stumpped. </s>

<s> You give us no idea how old the system is that you put the hard drive in. </s>
<s> Many older systems can't recognize large drives, and a 40GB may be unusable in a PII system without a BIOS upgrade (or even with one). </s>
<s> If the system is real new then you may need to jumper the drive as CS (cable select) not master or alone (if alone on the cable that is a separate setting and you don't use master). </s>
<s> Do NOT change the jumper for the number of heads, if you do that you will lose all data that was on there before. </s>
<s> cheers for the advice, i placed the hard drive into a newer computer and it worked just perfectly. </s>
<s> Cheers once again. </s>
<s> Justin. </s>
