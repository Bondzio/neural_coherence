I cant find too many unsastisfied customers from this company, but I am not sure if it is because they are really good or if its because they arent as big as Alienware. What do you guys think of Voodoo, the Voodoo Omen to be more specific. Does it seem like a good choice for a high end computer?

If you do order a VoodooPC be prepared for it to take a month or more to be built. I ordered a different model but had a wait time of 45 days from when I ordered it till I received it. That is a good choice for a high end computer and won a competition over on ExtremeTech for the Ultimate Gaming Machine I believe. It can be rather expensive would be the only caution I'd give. You may want to visit the forums that Voodoo has called the Mutthaboards if you want some more experiences. Regards, JB

Alienware told me two weeks and it turned into almost 2 months. I was also wondering how good there customer service is? Can you get on the phone with them quickly, are they nice? can you understand them clearly? From what I have read they seem like quality built systems. I do have a budget, but as far as these high end computers go, the voodoo omen doesnt seem to outrageous. I went to falcon northwests site, and I couldnt figure out why it was costing so much... thanks for the help

Calling them works better than e-mail or posting on their forums I've found and so far no waiting for someone. I did find their menu a little odd as it is press 1 for tech support or just stay on the line so there aren't lots of options and buttons to press to get to talking to a person. Regards, JB
13971	5	228956	2378246	2378223	Willy	1/17/07 11:16 AM	1.16903256E12	IMHO my POV	VooDoo computers are nothing more than top shelf components installed in a great box. They pay attention to details but like anything else there can be problems. They do support or can OC a system but that h/w is meant to take it, so take that into account or is optional. Overall, there are more happy users than not. The same was for Alienware, until they got too big for their britches. You can't build x-number of systems with fine detail under a fast out the door to fill orders which &quot;I suspect&quot; happened with Alienware. The other big gamer or top-end builder is NW Falcon at: http://www.falcon-nw.com/ should want to check them out. If you can afford to check them out and review the specs, you see there's little difference in the components installed within certain levels. I do want to exclude any paint or outrageous case schemes for practical reasons in pricing, look at the insides. tada -----Willy

The Voodoo cost the same as them but without dual cards. The falcons look nice but i changed to parts and it was already out of my budget.. Should I go with voodoo and pay the same price for a single card instead of duals? Should I tell Alienware I want to replace my computer? Or should I go with a Dell XPS? Cant afford Falcon... what do you guys think?

Or take Dell since it is the same company as Alienware. &quot;Gamer Infinity SLI KO&quot; may also be worth a look for a system that uses dual 8800 cards and in the Extremetech article lists it at $3,999 so it is fairly low cost. JMHO, JB

13971	9	228956	2378602	2377722	linkit	1/17/07 5:33 PM	1.16905518E12	Just a consideration	You are running into the reasons why high-end gamers like to build their own computers. Many find the little time invested in learning to build more than pays off in the end. - often cost less - can be ordered and built within days, not months - you know the system a lot better - no parts you don't want - no software you don't want
13971	10	228956	2378575	2378602	bysusan	1/17/07 5:52 PM	1.16905632E12	yea i know what you mean	yea im starting to see that more and more. I dont think I am going to learn all that though, I dont have the time right now. I also want the things only companies can offer, like tech support and a good warranty. Also I am not an overclocking hardcore gamer, I enjoy gaming alot though. This system however will be more for 3d and 2d art and animation, with some good gaming on the side. The cyberpowers are much cheaper but I have read too many bad reviews about them. After being burned by alienware, I dont want the same mistake again. So I think I am going to go with a Voodoo Omen.

In looking at the parts the prices came up about the same, falcons being a little more exspensive. So it was all bout the company. After enough research I have decided to go with Voodoo. I looked at the new xps, it looked nice I am just not sure I want to go wit dell because of past experiences. Also the falcon mach v and voodoo omen and area51 7500 out tested the dell xps in the research i found.

Voodoo has the awesome components and Dell has that cool form factor. It's really hard to decide but you got to ask yourself which one do you want? And I have a question of my own, does Alienware still have that cruddy customer service that's offered with the ALX systems?

This order was actually placed in late 2004, it's an old order, but it will at least illustrate all the pains I have gone thru in the life of this hellish PC Originally, I placed my order in November, but changed in mid December. When I mentioned canceling, they said it would be a 25% fee to cancel, on a $6,500 PC, that's just ********. Dell would have let me cancel the day before it was shipped without a &quot;fee&quot;. The order was not received until about March. A month after they had promised delivery. When I opened it, the sound card was sitting inside the case, not even in a slot, and no loose screws in the box. Despite that, system was wired and cabled neatly. Worked great for about 2 months, then the problems came. I was hearing the sounds of bubbles sloshing thru the water pump, very loud and annoying. I had to contact them about it, and they instructed me how to refill the water tank. I researched this, it was a saitek water cooling system ($200 retail), and the documentation indicated that VoodooPC mounted the tank backwards, and warned NOT to install it that way. My system was running hot, and so hot that eventually I had memory problems. This is a VERY SERIOUS problem, cause one or two bad windows updates with bad RAM will cause your system to get corrupted, so badly in fact I LOST ALL MY DATA! Eventually the leak got so bad, it actually dripped off my CPU down to my power supply. At that point I called their tech support and explained I wanted them to fix the leak, correct the improperly mounted water tank, and replace the power supply as it was now a fire hazzard. To their credit, the RMA was quick and easy, but unfortunatly because of the price declaration, I had to pay additional tarrifs on the shipping, which alerted the state tax collectors in NJ. I had to pay hundreds of dollars more for this POS because VoodooPC didn't properly assess the taxes on the PC. When I did get the PC back, I still had leaks. The top of the water tank was now badly cracked and had to use boat epoxy and caulk to seal it. I still have to refill it from time to time. Memory went bad again, and had to buy new chips to replace the bad ones. It appears that they went bad a third time just recently, except this time the PC doesn't even recognize it now. When I originally bought this system, there was a platinum upgrade plan, allowing you to upgrade it in the future. I really didn't want to buy a new PC so I figured I ask VoodooPC if they could upgrade the components. Their response was, that system is no longer offered by the company. Mine was a Rage SLi, the exact same case as their current Omen system. At every opportunity, this company and their POS system has let me down. I WILL NEVER EVER GIVE THEM A SINGLE CENT FOR ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. I would advise anyone considering them (or their HP equilavlent BlackBird) to look else where for a new system. It is not worth it, not by a long shot. For $6,500, you would expect pefection, and I got a big fat juicy lemon. DO NOT BUY!!!!
