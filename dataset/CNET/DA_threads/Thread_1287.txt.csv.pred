1.1.1	I just put together my first computer and I am running a SATA HD on the new computer .	St
1.1.2	And , I would like to transfer the old IDE hard drive onto the new system .	St
1.1.3	However , both HD have windows XP pro running on them so I am afraid that once I add the old HD onto the new system , a crash/conflict will occur .	St
1.1.4	I 'm not sure where to go from here .	St
1.2.1	After you install the old drive , start compter , go into BIOS settings , make sure the primary/first boot volume is the SATA drive .	St
1.2.2	If Windows XP starts OK , transfer important files from the old drive to the new , and reformat the old drive to have it as free storage space .	St
