i just bought an hp f1905b (along with their hp media center bundle) and this is a great display.
the fonts and images are very crisp and the colors are vibrant.
it is by far one of the best image quality i have seen on the market so far.
great buy for those who are looking for a 19 inch display.
i recommend it.
