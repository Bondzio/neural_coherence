<s> I just purchased all the custom parts to make my new system, but I have run into an annoying snag. </s>
<s> My Seagate Barracuda HD is not being detected in BIOS, and thus wont allow me install Vista. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated, and any further details easily given. </s>
<s> My Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128074 My Hard Drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148288 -Thanks </s>
<s> Do you mean that you cant see it in your POST screen (all the lines of tekst when you computer is starting ) or you can't see the hard drive when your in the vista installation. </s>
<s> If you dont see it in the post, you can try going in the bios and check if the channels aren't disabled or anything else disabled. </s>
<s> If that doesnt help just look if you connected you hard drive correctly and the power cable is connected, sometimes it will help if you connect to an other port. </s>
<s> If you dont see the harddrive in vista, then you have to install the sata drivers so the harddrive can be recognized. </s>
<s> When you have to select your harddrive under that screen is an option to install extra drivers, click on it and put in your motherboard disk or your manufacturers driver disk. </s>
<s> I bet if all the hardware is good you didn't configure the BIOS to enable the SATA ports. </s>
<s> I decline to read the manual for you on this one since I really need to spend more time on a project here but it sounds like you didn't setup the BIOS. </s>
<s> It's not automatic. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The manual said to make sure the &quot;OnChip SATA Controller&quot; is Enabled, and then to set to the mode that you want it (IDE, AHCI, RAID). </s>
<s> When I try to launch with IDE, it asks if I want to swap to AHCI. </s>
<s> I thought IDE was with the long ribbon attachment, rather then a SATA cable? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Is there any way to test to see if the Hard Drive does work properly? </s>
<s> Maybe I should get a return / replacement? </s>
<s> I had some RAID option which made the drives vanish from that BIOS and I get to boot into another BIOS (F10?) </s>
<s> to prepare the drives then Vista still wouldn't see them without a diskette. </s>
<s> Same story here I fear. </s>
<s> You need to try the various permutations and try SATA 1, then 2 connections. </s>
<s> But let's try simple. </s>
<s> Is the hard disk SPINNING? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But the fact is that when I take the case off I really only hear the 4 fans inside, not so much any HD spinning. </s>
<s> SATA power connections look wildly different. </s>
<s> Find that power and get it plugged in. </s>
<s> There are two, and I have tried both. </s>
<s> Still no luck </s>
<s> To spin up a SATA drive I only need the SATA power connection and the machine to turn on. </s>
<s> Forget that SATA data cable for a test. </s>
<s> No SPIN? </s>
<s> And we've found &quot;it.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I think you are having a problem with the emulation that a lot of motherboards use, the AHCI is a mode of that. </s>
<s> IDE means its emulated as an ide drive in the bios and also in installations. </s>
<s> If you arent going to run raid like strping (0) or mirroring (1) you can best use the IDE option. </s>
<s> becouse its most compatible </s>
<s> So I dont think I hear it spinning, but then I listen to my other computers hard drive and I can not really tell if its spinning either. </s>
<s> Under BIOS they have just the IDE Channels 0-5 Master & Slave, but no SATA. </s>
<s> So I really cant see if its in BIOS or not. </s>
<s> You could lose months on this. </s>
<s> Have someone with good hearing check it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You dont see sata becouse the motherboard is settingc the sata drives on the screen As ide harddisks. </s>
<s> So all your sata drives look like ide drives but they aren't. </s>
<s> Do you see your drives there ? </s>
<s> So my motherboard only has one of the long IDE ribbon cable ports, and currently I only have my DVD drive plugged into the &quot;Master&quot; section of the ribbon cable, and then plugged into the slot. </s>
<s> I have two people here at work that are telling me that I shouldn't have the &quot;Master&quot; plugged into the DVD drive, rather the &quot;Slave&quot;, so my computer doesn't see the DVD drive as the master, and thus try and load up from there. </s>
<s> To me, it wouldn't make since, seeing as how the Hard Drive is SATA, wouldn't that make it on a completeley different channel? </s>
<s> But I figured I would ask before I ship my Hard Drive out (already packaged and everything). </s>
<s> -Thanks </s>
<s> But the new BIOS settings can change this answer. </s>
<s> For example I have this new board and it emulates IDE with SATA but I must be careful which I choose. </s>
<s> The manual notes that for emulation (far too many choices for me to write them all here) that I use the SATA 1 and 3 connections will map to the Primary IDE master and slave. </s>
<s> The Primary IDE connector in this case is then dead and I have to use the Secondary IDE for my boot DVDRW drive. </s>
<s> As to master or slave or CABLE SELECT the type of IDE CABLE I use matters. </s>
<s> For 80 Conductor cables I use CS. </s>
<s> For 40 conductor cables with one drive I use master and with two drives one master and one slave. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What's the deal here?? </s>
<s> I also a my sata HD powered and attached to SATA1 port and in BIOS is doesn't show up. </s>
<s> Under SATA 1 it says [Not Detected] but enabled. </s>
<s> What gives?? </s>
<s> My DVD writer is an IDE and set on Slave - something else I need to fix, but that shouldn't effect the hard drive, right?? </s>
<s> The drive is softly clicking about 2x/second - is THAT the right noise?? </s>
<s> I never noticed all these noises from my past computers, but now that I have a problem, my ears are pricked! </s>
<s> If your drive doesn't spin as above, have some one test it. </s>
<s> I have heard you need to format a HD before it's recognized, but how can we do that if we can't even load an OS? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> You can't win. </s>
<s> Sorry for the rhyme but it's time. </s>
