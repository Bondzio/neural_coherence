http://www.goincase.com/ipad/ I have the &quot;grip&quot; in black it is made of soft silicon but mine does not have the bumps in the photo.
It is very good & heavy but protect my iPad very well, I have dropped my iPad a few times on the hardwood floors no problem.
When not in use I have a red &quot;Casecrown&quot; made to be used for netbooks but it fits just right & has a pocket, it has memory foam inside for added protection, unlike most out there.
You have two options out there, cool looking but provides little to no real protection or dull & boring but protects.
I picked option 2, I do not feel like shelling out another $800.
