I have an emachines T6212 desktop that is hardly adequate for the tasks I want to use my computer for.
Therefore, I am seriously looking at an upgrade.
If possible, I am hoping to be able to use the existing case and PSU, just upgrading the motherboard, CPU, and RAM.
Is this a realistic dream?
Or will I need to also get a new power supply, and if so, how powerful of a PSU do I need?
Here are the details: Current Computer: emachines T6212 desktop AMD Athlon 64 3200+ 2.0GHz single core, 512 K L2 Cache 120 GB Western Digital IDE hard drive upgraded to 2.5 GB DDR RAM micro-ATX motherboard (no specified manufacturer), model # MS-7093, ATI Xpress 200 chipset 180W PSU New components (or what I hope to have): sub-$100 micro-ATX motherboard, likely an MSI 880GM-E43 AMD Phenom II X4 955 processor hope to eventually have all 4 RAM slots full Thank you all
