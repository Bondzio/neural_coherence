1.1.1	I have a HP Pavilion a6030 desktop and want to upgrade the PSU and graphics card.	St
1.1.2	It is currently a Delta 300W psu but I am not sure if a standard ATX PSU will fit.	St
1.1.3	Any advice?	St
1.2.1	ATX power supply dimensions are easy to find on the internet so you can check if a stock unit will do.	St
1.3.1	It should take a standard PSU unit such as Antec ATX with no problems, go to a 500w or so and you will be fine, have used them in Hp units as retrofit.	St
1.4.1	Many thanks, I will try that as soon as possible.	St
1.4.2	Thanks for the quick response	St
