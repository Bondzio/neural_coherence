<s> My dvi port on my Gateway FDP2185 monitor (built April 06) has gone bad. </s>
<s> Now I have to use the vga port and there is blurriness around text (images look fantastic). </s>
<s> Native resolution 1680 x 1050. </s>
<s> I have a Nvdia 8600 GT dual DVI card with the latest driver. </s>
<s> I'm using the DVI/VGA adapter that came with this card. </s>
<s> In XP/SP3, I have changed the smooth edges from ClearType to standard and back again. </s>
<s> ClearType looks better than standard, but it is still blurry. </s>
<s> Is there a way to get clear text? </s>
<s> This is my work computer and 90% of its use is completely text. </s>
<s> I was told replacing the DVI port needs microsoldering and it is probably more cost effective to buy a new monitor. </s>
<s> Some 180 buck 22&quot; refurb but it's HDMI and not DVI. </s>
<s> Here's a picture. </s>

<s> Maybe you just need to fix what broke or replace it? </s>

<s> I'm fighting the urge to replace it with a Dell 2408WFP. </s>
<s> Microsoft's cashback on ebay is not helping the urge either! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Try another VGA cable. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Swap ends of the VGA cable. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Try other refresh rates (start with 60). </s>
<s> I did change the VGA cable and it made the text some clearer. </s>
<s> I have to use the Nvidia adapter because my 8600 only has DVI ports. </s>
<s> I'm going to get a DVI to VGA cable to see if that completely clears it (fingers crossed). </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> I don't have the option of changing the refresh from 60. </s>
