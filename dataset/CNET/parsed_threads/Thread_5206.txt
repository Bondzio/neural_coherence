<s> Quick question - I already have mentioned card and am considering buying a 2nd to set up a Crossfire system, does anybody already have a system like this? </s>
<s> Is it worth it? </s>
<s> My mobo supports 1xPCIEx16 and 1xPCIEx8 so in Crossfire they will both run at 8x will that affect performance? </s>
<s> I am thinking that the combined 2gbs of GDDR5 and 2 GPUs will more than make up for the banwidth drop - am I correct? </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice. </s>
<s> at 8X...not to mention the darn near 200 watt power draw. </s>
<s> Which PSU do you have ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> If I can see some serious benefits in buying another HD5870 at 300 quid a pop, trust me buying a larger wattage psu isn't a problem. </s>
<s> Currently using a 600 watt if I bought a 2nd HD5870 would install minimum 800 watt. </s>
<s> Even if I have to buy a new motherboard to get both PCIE slots @ 16x I would buy it...but is it worth it? </s>
<s> Yes I will be able to attach 8 monitors/tvs to these cards...cool, yes I can split screen my video outputs...cool, yes I can have 8 different programs running, 1 on each monitor, yes my friends will eat their pants with jealousy or will they say &quot;what's the point?&quot; You know what I am talking myself out of this, anyone care to tell me it's a good idea? </s>
