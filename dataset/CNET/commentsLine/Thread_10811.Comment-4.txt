your exact steps are still unclear.
i know it's asking a lot but let's say you took this old drive and put it into the enclosure and it didn't show up with partitions and no drive letter.
in that case we want to clone that drive first since what we do next is data recovery and if there is one lesson about that we never operate on the original.
for owners that won't do this they often are new to data recovery and must lose it all since that's how the lesson is (excuse me here) drummed in.
ok, with the drive cloned (i use clonezilla) i take my clone and try the usual recovery tools noted at the top of the cnet storage forum.
a linux boot cd to see if that sees the files, the usual getdataback, zero assumption recovery and recuva are noted there.
let's see what you discover with these tools on the clone copy.
