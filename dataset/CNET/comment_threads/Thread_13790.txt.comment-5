I've looked at these and most of them are pretty expensive.
The cheapest one I found was over three hundred dollars.
The reason I thought of the VGA cable was that I thought I could pay less for that.
But the KVM Extenders I've found so far have been a three hundred dollars at least.
Do you know of any for less?
