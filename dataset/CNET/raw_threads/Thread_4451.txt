The Epson self destructed because I didn't use it enough and it's design is as bad as its inks are good. Clearly, print quality alone, Epson would be it IMHO. However, I'm now taking two other points into consideration: ink economy and maintenance. I want a printer that doesn't jam easily and I'm looking at the Canon PIXMA iP4000. Of course I'm also open to anything else that gets a strong thumbs up, so recommendations would be appreciated. John

If you feel that printers should last longer than what's on the (ink printer) market today is not worthy of your desires. I'd look at color laser since it does not have an ink drying issue and I'm getting 5+ years from such in office settings. Bob

We have a high-priced one at work and the output looks terrible. There are no subtleties in color and the color overlapping is just a tiny bit off. Given the design problems of the C80, do you think the Canon would be any better? John

While the laser you have doesn't do photo, the current class of lasers is much better and doesn't have the ink drying issue or the short 2 to 3 year lifespan. There was not a design problem in the C80. But you wanted something like a refrigerator. Something that just works for 7 plus years. Again, any consumer ink printer will not satisfy what I've read in your postings. Bob

I don't like Canon Inkjets, partly because if there is a quality problem and you remove the ink cartridge, it can take up to 10 cleaning cycles (with the wastage that entails) to get it to print again. I much prefer HP or Lexmark. Bear in mind that due to the nature of my job I only see the problem kit, and I see far more Canons...
