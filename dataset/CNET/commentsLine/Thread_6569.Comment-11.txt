you caught your own mistake before i could pipe in.
you hit the nail on the head.
to clarify for everybody else; when connecting two routers together, you need to use the numbered ports, or an 'uplink' if you have one.
the internet port is only be connected to a dsl or cable modem, not for linking routers together.
glad everything worked out for you.
enjoy the wireless
