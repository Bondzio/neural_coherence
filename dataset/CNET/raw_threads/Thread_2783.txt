You would need either a router designed with that capability or a compatible adapter kit that can provide the DC input your router needs. Baring that, you get creative and fashion your own. You need to add the DC from some area near your modem. The device used is called an &quot;injector&quot;. You then need to split the data and power signals at the router. Typically injectors produce DC at a higher voltage than that which is required for the device they power. This is the hangup you'll run into. If your router gets 6v from it's external PS and your injector produces the typical 48v, you may fry something. Have you checked to see what the DC requirements are of your router and if a kit is available to match? While I've no real experience with such fabrications, I do suspect there is a reason for PoE to need the higher voltage and that is to ensure delivery of enough current over longer distances such as one encounters over longer wiring runs.

So i need to buy new power adapter which could supply 24v and the injector. I thought it could make it in easy way without add something component. I see, That's clear...:) Btw, Do you ever use Buffalo's Router Infinia wireless N? what do u think? thx

Look here to see what a Google search for 12v PoE adaper finds. This does not say that the splitter plug will fit your Buffalo router's jack. No, I've never used that router but have set up a wireless network connecting to several APs using PoE. In my case, I used a PoE switch which carried power and data to all the connected devices. It delivered 48vdc. That's because the APs were designed for PoE. Your router is not so you have to find or make something to make it work in a manner other than the manufacturer intended. I suspect you're trying to locate the router in an area which will provide the best coverage and that the area you've chosen has no AC outlet handy. PoE fills that void and allows you recycle the router by simply disconnecting and reconnecting the Ethernet cable. Good luck.
