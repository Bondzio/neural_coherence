i feel your pain, virginia.
i had a similar problem.
the computer would recognize my external okay but what i didn't know until 3 rebuilds and a week later was that my external had a virus.
i don't know how it got there or for sure where i got it but it went through my firewall and my antivirus software and corrupted my data files on my external.
like you, i had hundreds of pictures of my kids and data files (i write for a hobby) and none of it was backed up and every one of them was corrupt.
i was devastated and vowed to never go on the internet again not to mention i cried for a week.
my husband who is a tech, was able to retrieve those files, somehow make them not corrupt and i was able to back up everything on 16 gb sd cards.
it was a long process for him to get it done and took him several days.
i was a tech myself for years but i'd never seen anything like it.
it still blows my mind.
but since then, i don't use windows to go on the internet except on rare occasions.
i use linux and am much happier and safer with it.
i have a dual boot system with ubuntu one one partition and windows 7 on the other.
i don't know exactly how he saved those files but i am so grateful because basically my life was on that drive.
he worked while i cried.
what a trade off.
i hope your situation has a happy ending as mine did.
