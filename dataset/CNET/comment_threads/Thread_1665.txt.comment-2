I challenged that notion at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7587-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=205741&messageID=2202058 and you might save 10% of the battery life over a year one way versus the other.
But we use the laptops as desktops and the noted article is rather pessimistic as to the desktop notebook temperature so my outlook is that this is more urban legend than fact.
Read and decide.
We leave the battery in and they last years.
