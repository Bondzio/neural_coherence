very similiar to what i have, i have the hp a810n, i checked and both have the asus k8sla (salmon) motherboard.
the a810n came with a 250 watt hipro power supply, i changed to a 450 watt psu because i wanted to run a high end grapics card.
so far i am very happy with my computer.
it runs quiet, cool and after upping the ram to 1 gig and getting a nice agp video card i can do pretty much anything i want in regard to gaming, and playing with dvd burner, etc.
with the upgrades i added.
(except the video card) i was able to get the computer, the memory, and a 17&quot; lcd monitor for under $900.
i paid 679 for the actual computer, however hp had a 100 rebate on any athlon 64 purchased at the time.
i purchased the computer on march 4th and i got the rebate check from hp on around the 1st of april.
(btw, with any rebate, send it certified mail, it truly helps!!)
btw, the e-machines are also nice computers for the money, my brother in law has had a couple and some friends at work have them also and they have never had any issues with them.
