<s> I have a Dell Inspiron 620. </s>
<s> Last night a power surged MESSED up my computer. </s>
<s> I didn't even realize this until I had sat down to a screen that was displaying &quot;windows is loading files&quot; and a full bar underneath just hanging there. </s>
<s> I knew that this meant it had automatically done a startup repair but I wasn't sure why it was hanging. </s>
<s> So I rebooted and changed the BIOS to run from the CD rom first. </s>
<s> I put in a windows 7 cd to try and run startup repair from there and rebooted. </s>
<s> Again it just loaded the &quot;windows is loading files&quot; bar and hanged. </s>
<s> At this point I decided to run an Unbuntu CD to try and salvage what was on my hardrives before I did a clean wipe and reinstall of windows 7. </s>
<s> It displayed the Unbuntu splash page and then went blank. </s>
<s> After this I noticed that there were sounds coming from inside my computer... </s>
<s> Here's that uploaded in mp3 form to help give you an idea. </s>
<s> (after :23 skip to :58) What is this by user668315214 on SoundCloud - Create, record and share your sounds for free It makes these same sounds each time I tried to boot, so I figured it was my hard drive causing this. </s>
<s> To test that theory, I removed my hardrives and used another one from a different computer that was made around the same time as my other HDDs. </s>
<s> Still, no proper boot, and it made the exact same sounds. </s>
<s> All I can think of it being is a mother board issue. </s>
<s> What do you all think? </s>
<s> Sorry, the correct link for the sound file is here. </s>

<s> You can test the setup by disconnecting the HD entirely, just leave in place. </s>
<s> Access the bios and be sure that the CD drive is the 1st boot device. </s>
<s> I hope your Ubuntu is a &quot;live CD version&quot; and then reboot to check status. </s>
<s> If the Ubuntu boots quickly or it does different than before, report back. </s>
<s> If the system boots, then your HD is hosed. </s>
<s> If it hangs again at same point, then your mtrbd. </s>
<s> could be at fault. </s>
<s> Of course, any ram or video still is installed, if you reduce or swap them out if status changes to narrow fault. </s>
<s> Often enough, since you believe that a power surge caused the issue, you maybe chasing problem after problem even if you think you've resolved it. </s>
<s> Too often another problem crops-up soon or it last at least 30 days or more, then I'll consider it resolved. </s>
<s> Yeah, it maybe time to replace PC if issues happen too soon or problems continue AND!!! </s>
<s> you can't trust the parts present in old PC until tested. </s>

<s> The sounds like the HD, but it doesn't seem to continue on. </s>
<s> If that's all, then the HD is probably awaits some system error display to allow to continue. </s>
<s> I suggest you wait and give it more time and see if any error message appears. </s>
<s> Wait about 10-15mins. </s>
<s> The noise itself doesn't suggest a bad HD though, unless this is constantly doing this. </s>
