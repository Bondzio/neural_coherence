<s> I recently installed a CD-RW drive in my computer. </s>
<s> It was purchased from an electronics store as rebuilt. </s>
<s> It's frankensteined. </s>
<s> Before the CD-RW was installed, the CD-ROM drive worked fine. </s>
<s> Now, after the install, it doesn't recognize and CD, including music CDs, games, or blank discs. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drive in device management, I have physically re-installed both drives, swapping the cables (and the master/slave jumpers), I have checked the drive properties and they say the device is working properly. </s>
<s> I have also checked to see if there is a hardware conflict. </s>
<s> None. </s>
<s> I booted in safe mode and the drive still won't read discs. </s>
<s> I have also cleaned the drive with a CD drive cleaning disc. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that my 40-pin cable connecting the CD-ROM drive may be faulty at the connection. </s>
<s> Anybody have suggestions or ideas? </s>
<s> Not wanting to replace the drive as I know it's good; it works in my other computer. </s>
<s> Make sure you have 40-pin/80-wire type cable. </s>
<s> Then use either the master/slave setup to connect. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, use the CS jumper instead for both. </s>
<s> Its important to use the newer type of cable for best operation. </s>
<s> if the problem still persists then the new CD drive just isn't capable to reside with the other CD drive or its really old. </s>
<s> Quite frankly, you could have done better with a DVD drive that's CD and DVD capable even as a burner. </s>
<s> Besides being newer and usually more open to the setup. </s>
<s> You didn't provide details of make and model#, etc. </s>
<s> The details of your PC, OS, etc.. </s>
<s> The provided info is generic so use as it pertains. </s>
<s> Also, are there any bios updates, what do they do? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You wrote IDE but here's my plea. </s>
<s> Please know the rules about IDE cables and jumpers. </s>
<s> These are easy to find today so let's hope it's that. </s>
<s> Also, after I move drives around I boot Windows to SAFE MODE and remove all the CD/DVD drives there so on the next boot Windows will refresh all the drives. </s>

<s> You start out by saying &quot;You wrote IDE but...&quot; Nobody in this thread said anything about IDE until you did. </s>
<s> And I do know the rules for IDE cables and jumpers. </s>
<s> The master goes on the end and the slave in the middle, with the appropriate jumpers set for each. </s>
<s> That was stated in my post. </s>
<s> The computer is an amalgam of three or four computers, and to be honest I don't remember the specifics. </s>
<s> I can access them and post them, but everything was working fine until that CD-RW went in. </s>
<s> I am going to take the IDE cable out and put in a newer one, and if that doesn't work, I will set both jumpers to CS and let the computer figure out what is what. </s>
<s> Thanks for the (generic, your word) information. </s>
<s> I appreciate your time and effort in helping with this issue. </s>
<s> As to IDE and such. </s>
<s> You wrote 40 pin cable so yes there was an odd 40 pin SCSI from the 90's but I doubt that was it. </s>
<s> Take a moment to reflect on your reply. </s>
<s> Will you get more help if you sound a little tense? </s>
<s> But do try that safe boot item. </s>
<s> I've lost count how many times it helped. </s>
<s> Best of luck. </s>
