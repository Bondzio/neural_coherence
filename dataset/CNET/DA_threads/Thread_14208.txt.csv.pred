1.1.1	i have a question about my current power supply , a 850w Thermaltake Black widow modular , and the EVGA Geforce 9800 GTX+ SSC graphics card , the system requirements of the card state that a power supply with a +12v rating of 26A is needed to run the card , and my power supply only offers 18A , so heres my question , is that close to enough to run the card with zero issues ?	Ques
1.1.2	or should i replace it again , even though its new , bought it in november ?	Ques
1.1.3	and if i need to replace it , where can i find a cheap sub $ 200 750w-850w Power Supply with amperage needed by the card ?	Ques
1.1.4	please answer and thanks to those who do .	Polite
1.2.1	the 9800gtx+ using dual 6pin peg connectors .	St
1.2.2	your power supply has multiple rails .	St
1.2.3	each connector is usually on its own rail so 2x18A = 36A .	St
1.3.1	Thanks , i was n't to sure if my power supply could handle it , but i remembered that 18+18=36 , and a graphics card usually takes 2 6 pin power connectors , but i still needed a professional opinion on it just to be on the safe side , since this will be the first time ill be going with a top level graphics card from EVGA , as i have a budget card from them right now .	St
1.4.1	so the price for 9800gtx+ has fallen to $ 160- $ 170 .	St
1.4.2	make sure you 're not paying too much .	St
1.4.3	newegg link	St
1.5.1	i do n't care about price , as most gamers are , since i have $ 488 in the bank and little more during the holidays , and plus , i want to run both FSX and Call of Duty 4 with slightly more than decent frame rates on high settings at 1024x768 or 1280x1024 ( depending if i can afford a 19 ' LCD ) , and im also a EVGA fan ( from last year ) \Nvidia fan ( from 2003\2004 )	St
1.6.1	If money is no object , dont buy evga , they only have a 2 year warranty .	St
1.6.2	BFG nvidia products have a lifetime warranty , and if they have that much confidence in their products ... .well..plus their costomer service is excellent .	St
1.6.3	Google BFG and at least check em out ...	St
1.7.1	im a EVGA Fan since last year , and i already did a successful RMA with them for a nForce 650i Ultra motherboard that fried on me after trying to re-attach a heatsink , so im sticking with EVGA for the long run .	St
