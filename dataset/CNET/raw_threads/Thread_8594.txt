After hurricane Charlie, things got messed up and I'm in the process of networking a different computer to my host (winXP). The guest computer operating system is WIN Mn. I access the Internet through cable modem and use a Linksys wireless router. I've played with this for days. I've unplugged everything, redone it and checked all of the addresses etc., over and over. I used to get 100% signal between the PCs and now the best I can get is 67%. The guest computer won't even log on to the Internet. I'm sure I'm overlooking some simple thing but my mind is now fried! Can you suggest what I might have missed? Thank you. Valerie

I should tell you that a few days ago, I had the system working fine on these same two same computers with a 100% signal. I then decided to reformat the hard drive on the guest computer. I did that and then replaced the software etc. It tells me that I'm getting a 67% signal but won't log on to the Internet. Valerie

People format a drive and install &quot;Windows&quot;. What they didn't know is that drivers for the MOTHERBOARD, USB and other items are not installed for them or don't exist on the Microsoft CD. It's become a bad problem in that years ago we were expected to know this. Today, newer owners are handed working machines and not instructed on how to install an OS. Bob

I will not know what the machine needs and owners often forget. When faced with these setups, we always bring spare routers and wifi client parts. Bob
