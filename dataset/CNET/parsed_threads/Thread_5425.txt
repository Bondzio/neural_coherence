<s> Hi, I have a TFT monitor which provides 32 bit color quality and max resolution(1280 x 768)with intel G33/G31 express chipset family graphics card. </s>
<s> but with a intel 82810 graphics card it provides only 4 bit color quality and 640 x 480 resolution but intel 82810 graphics card provides 24 bit color quality with a CRT monitor and one other TFT. </s>
<s> Can someone help me to get 24 bit color quality with this TFT monitor and 82810 graphics card. </s>
<s> The 82810 was used on thousands of motherboards. </s>
<s> I found it best to use the motherboard drivers but without make, model of the machine I can't make a suggestion. </s>
