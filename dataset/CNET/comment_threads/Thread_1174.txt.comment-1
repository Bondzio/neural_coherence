I need to get an ac adapter for my LCD monitor, but I'm having problems finding a compatible one.
Here's the specs for the original adapter that comes with the monitor: Input: 100-240V, 50/60hz Output: 12V, 2.09A Anyways, my question is would I be able to use an adapter for a different peripheral if the output voltage and amps where higher than the original adapter?
I've been looking into universal notebook adapters that have variable output voltages from 15 to 24 volts, and also higher amp output.
Would one of these adapters work, or would the higher output cause damage?
Thanks.
