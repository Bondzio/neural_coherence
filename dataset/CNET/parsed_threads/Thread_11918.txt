<s> Question: What if anything do you know about Norton's anti-virus software? </s>
<s> I have Norton AV 2004 installed but haven't been able to receive any live updates for quite sometime. </s>

<s> I have had no success in contacting Norton for an explanation and my AV subscription is scheduled to expire in nine days. </s>

<s> it seems like your system is jsut sorta on the fritz you have a few options but what i'd do right off the bat is REFORMAT WITH A CLEAN INSTALL OF WINDOWS do not connect to the internet yet upon reformatting re-install NAV 2004 goto the store, and buy a copy of MaximumPC that includes a CD with at least Firefox (your doing this to get the CD, you can keep the mag if you want (their usually pretty decent) but Firefox is what you want, along with Spybot S&D) still do not connect to the web install Spybot S&D and Firefox (Firefox is a web broswer, if you don't wanna pay $9 for a MaximumPC, connect to the web after installing NAV 2k4, and then go straight to www.mozilla.org, and DL Firefox, and then get Spybot S&D) Firefox keeps spwyare and adware out, and automatically blocks pop-ups it's just such a great web broswer using IE 6 NPF 2003 on my system would give me pop up block alerts, intrusion stuff, and various other things all the time with Firefox, i get Firefox telling me it's doing something, and NPF2003 (and PrevX...which is annoying to say the least, invision NPF's intrusion detection, combined with Spybot's registry protection thing, BTW I HAVE SPYBOT AND NPF! </s>
<s> so i get 3 alerts at about anything that affects Windows...but hey, it keeps the system clean) Firefox just makes the web better </s>
<s> It's a lot less expensive. </s>
<s> Do a clean install; install a firewall and Av and Spybot, Adaware, MS antispy, spywareguard and spywareblaster,CWshredder and Crapcleaner before you go on internet. </s>
<s> New Pc WHY? </s>
<s> When you say simply re-install Windows which in my particular case would be Windows 95; do you mean by use of the Windows 95 CD? </s>
<s> My brother gave me this computer as a birthday gift 6 years ago come this June 2005 and unfortunately a Windows 95 CD wasn't included with it so that would be a problem; correct? </s>
<s> I've got my eyes on that new Emachine T6212 I think; that might not be the correct model number. </s>
<s> Since I know basically nothing about the workings of a computer; if I do decide to buy that Emachine; should I also consider purchasing an extended warranty or not? </s>
<s> If so for how many years? </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Big Steve End Of Reply 04/11/05 </s>
<s> looks like a super machine at that price. </s>
<s> http://www.emachines.com/products/products.html?prod=eMachines_T6212 as far as the extended warranty...there's no &quot;right&quot; answer. </s>
<s> circuit city wants $139 for two years. </s>
<s> Without reading all the fine print, I think this means it is two years in addition to the 12-month factory warranty. </s>
<s> It's really a &quot;peace of mind&quot; thing, a form of insurance like any other insurance. </s>
<s> I guess it all comes down to how long you will keep, and be happy, with the system. </s>
<s> You might be ready to dump it in a year. </s>
<s> Or maybe not. </s>
<s> Regardless, it looks terrific. </s>
<s> Pick up a nice flat-panel monitor and you're good to go. </s>
