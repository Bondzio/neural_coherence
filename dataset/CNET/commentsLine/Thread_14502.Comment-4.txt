the sbg6580 is a combo modem/wireless router which means if one side goes out you replace the whole thing.
if you like the mororola modems why not go with a stand alone modem like the sb 6120 or sb 6121 modem, they are all docsis 3.0 and then get a stand alone n wireless router.
if your ip is comcast and you are in a docsis 3.0 area you will see a improvement because you will have 4 bonded channels down which gives you more constant speeds.
you may end up spending a little more, initially, but i have heard they have problems with the combo units
