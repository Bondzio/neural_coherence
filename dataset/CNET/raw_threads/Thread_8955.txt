After doing some research I learned that Maxtor hard drives have a high failure rate. I have a Maxtor. Return code 7 is bad. I got return code 7. I have a friend who said she has a CD that may find the hard drive but I thought I'd throw the question out to see what kind of advice I can get. Thank you.

As to data recovery, it's done every day by drivesavers.com, ontrack.com and if the drive is spinning, sometimes at home. In closing, all the drives will die in about 5 to 10 years. What does that tell you? Bob

I figured a Dell computer would last more than 1 1/2 years. Could a newly installed program kill the drive? I did install a program about a week before it stopped working.

Yes I've been given &quot;dead&quot; drives only to discover they are nothing but &quot;corrupt.&quot; The drive was actually good. Rare but happens. If the drive doesn't spin then we at least look at the solder work near the power pins. Some owners were changing or removing the drive &quot;for security&quot; and the solder work gives out. Bob
