make sure you have either a laptop with a battery or a ups.
the only shortcoming in normal use of a ssd is the data is far more likely to be corrupted by a power failure than a traditional hard drive.
but i wouldn't (and haven't) let this be a stumbling block.
i just no longer run my laptop without some form of backup power.
most of the time, that just means leaving the battery installed even if i am using ac power.
windows 7 and 8 automatically take care of ssd management.
you don't have to worry about trim or any other esoteric routines to protect your investment.
i fully expect current model ssds to last as long as i will be using the computer in which they are installed.
as for the cost, if you are replacing an existing traditional sata hard drive, you may not need the same size drive when you switch to a ssd.
traditional hard drives need a fairly large reserve to perform tasks like defragging.
since you don't have to, and in fact, should not perform these spinning disk maintenance chores on a ssd, most users can easily get by with a smaller capacity ssd.
for users with larger on-line storage needs and smaller wallets, do consider the hybrid drives.
while not quite as fast as a ssd, they are still typically much faster than a traditional hard drive; especially at boot time.
and finally, most of the people who are disappointed with ssd performance simply don't understand that all you are doing is speeding reads and writes from storage.
if your pc seems slow when running an already loaded application, your application will startup faster with a ssd, but it isn't going to run any faster.
so before plopping down upgrade money for a ssd you really need to ask yourself why you are dissatisfied with current performance.
