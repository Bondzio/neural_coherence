<s> I wish I had pics, but in any case, I switched out everything in my HP case to a Kingwin KT424, was very pretty, but after ordering some lights, I knew I would have to order a new power supply. </s>
<s> But was that safe to do? </s>
<s> Well, I never really found a definitive answer on the web, so, I ordered an OCZ Powerstream 420 and did some multimeter testing, everything seemed to match up voltage/wire wise, and so I plugged her up. </s>
<s> Presto! </s>
<s> I now have an HP system running with a new power supply, inside a new case (switching cases was fun, I -love- the Kingwin). </s>
<s> Adding some rounded cables, instead of the ugly grey ribbons now visible through my new side window, a couple of CCFL on an inverter w/ a sound controller, and a Pioneer DVD writer next week. </s>
<s> Next up is a 7-in-one floppy/card reader. </s>
<s> =) </s>
<s> thats pretty cool that you did that to an oem pc. </s>
<s> cheers mate konny </s>
<s> HP=yes. </s>
<s> Dell is the problem child when it comes to PSU. </s>
