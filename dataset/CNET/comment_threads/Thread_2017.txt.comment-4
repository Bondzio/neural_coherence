Check if your keyboard's LED's light-up during start-up, if it does light up, does the caps lock LED or Num Lock LED activates once the keys are pressed or are they steady (sometimes the 3 LED's are lit).
If that is the case, there might be a problem in the motherboard.
Check the capacitors near the power supply (there are 3 or 5 big capacitors in there as compared to other capacitors some read 2200 uf or 1500 uf 3.3 volts), is it bulging on top (showing a burnt-up capacitor)?
The capacitors in there control or maintain the power supplied to various parts.
Once they are busted, there will be low power output supply to various parts.
The DVR or CD ROM LED's may light-up but will not operate since LED's require a small amount of current to light-up.
Burnt-up capacitors sometimes show after you had put your electronic equipment off, since they had exhausted its reserved charge when they were idle and no power is supplied to it.
