but you've lost me here.
keep in mind i've been around since the ge 210 and was part of a company that made a few light pens decades ago.
to me, any device that translates position into some x, y and possibly z coordinates is in fact a digitizer.
now with that out of the way i think you are asking what resolution these digitizers have.
my answer is they are poor for drawing and do slightly better with a stylus.
the samsung s note uses the active pen as well as the activ pc.
you want to use a stylus so be sure to go for models that have such.
this doesn't cure the other issues that will come back to haunt you.
