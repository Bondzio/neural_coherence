So far the things I have heard about the 2 are this. Logitech g600 is bigger and really is best for people with big hands but its reliable. Naga are small and are reliable. I have touched a naga while at bestbuy but could not get my hands on the Logitech. And most of the people I have ask have said either one thing or another about both. I want a mouse that wont break on me in just a few months because it is bad. I'm not a hard core gamer and I don't mash my buttons hard like some do. So what is the best mouse in your guys opinion?
