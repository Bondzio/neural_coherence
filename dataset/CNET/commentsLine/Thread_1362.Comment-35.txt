for someone who's supposed to be a semi-professional of sorts (i'm not sure what in) some of your info is incorrect.
keeping the side case open in expectations of cooling the cpu is misleading.
the case and fans are designed and engineered to run a certain flow of fresh air in to cool and fresh air out of the case.
by removing the side panel your in effect completely throwing off the designed air flow pattern which could be as harmful as running the fan at half speed.
secondly, the advice of not using free antivirus programs is possibly self serving.
granted, some of the free av programs out there are inherently harmful as they capture users by allowing trojans, spyware, malware into the system unbeknownst to the user who's expecting protection.
programs such as avast, avg, and others are just as good (if not better) than many of the paid type programs such as the misleading norton 360 and even trend micro inclusive packages.
if this is your best advice and your portraying yourself as an expert, you need to do some reading and give better and more appropriate advise.
