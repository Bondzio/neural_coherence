965	0	125592	1421800	NR	mdtaracido	9/15/05 6:34 AM	1.12676604E12	Network disconnected	In order to establish a LAN I've installed a linksys router on my main computer and a linksys adapter card on a second computer. Although each was installed correctly and seem to be working individually, I can't log on from the second computer to the internet nor will it file share. When I try to log on from the second computer, I get the message &quot;network hardware disconnected or unplugged&quot;, which they aren't. What's up with this?

I am assuming that you are making wired (not wireless) connectinos with both computers. Correct? Try swapping network cables to see if one is faulty.

The Router model is WRT546S (Wireless) and the card adapter is WPM54GS (Wireless). I'm told by the computer that the card is working properly. And the computer to which the router is attached is able to copnnect to the internet. But with respect to the card adapater, I keep getting the message cannot associate with access point.

The driver for your WMP54GS may include a new version of Linksys Wireless Network Monitor. If so, the installation process might require you to uninstall the previous version before you can go forward. Another issue: Sometimes using Linksys Wireless Network Monitor to connect to the router is quirky. Try right-clicking on the Linksys Network Monitor (by your clock), and select the option to use Windows wireless network configuration.

Our primary computer crashed and that's when the trouble started. Prior to that I had connectivity and the computers were both where they are presently. I thought that the crash might have affected the router, so I bought and installed a new router with speed booster. I even changed the adapter for the second computer. But thus far, the second computer can't get access.
