<s> So I have a Dell computer and a LCD Acer monitor. </s>
<s> I was useing a DVI-D cable but switched out computers. </s>
<s> Now i have the Dell and im useing a VGA cable but it says i have no signal. </s>
<s> I most likely need to change the input to VGA but i dont know how. </s>
<s> The few buttons that are on my monitor dont do anything cuz i have no signal. </s>
<s> Any suggestions </s>
<s> There are many hundred displays and to look at this I need the model number so I can go get the manual. </s>
<s> Then again you could supply that link. </s>

<s> &quot;How do I switch between the VGA and DVI input signals on my monitor?&quot; Acer writes there: http://acer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14950 &quot;How do I switch between the VGA and DVI input signals on my monitor? </s>
<s> How do I switch between the VGA and DVI input signals on my monitor? </s>
<s> If you have one or more devices connected to your monitor you can switch between the VGA and DVI input signals. </s>
<s> To switch between the VGA and DVI input signals follow the steps below: On the lower bezel of your monitor, press the MENU button to enter the onscreen menu. </s>
<s> Use the arrow buttons to navigate to the Image icon and press the MENU button to enter the submenu. </s>
<s> Select the input signal and press the MENU button to confirm. </s>
<s> Use the arrow buttons to navigate to the EXIT icon, and then press the MENU button to save and exit. </s>
<s> &quot; There is a graphic icon there I can't put in this forum. </s>

<s> I followed the steps listed and when i try to enter the submenu under image by pressing menu nothing happens. </s>
<s> This is what I see in the submenu: 1680x1050 H: 64KHz V: 60HZ Digital Input then my S/N # - I even tried switching the Digital Input to Analog which did nothing. </s>
<s> I am left to guess that someone used a DVI to VGA adapter. </s>
<s> It's not noted so far. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok so my last reply was actually false. </s>
<s> I was under the wrong option. </s>
<s> I double cheked and I followed the steps the right way this time, and I entered the submenu and switched the input from digital to analog and the screen goes black for about 2sec and then goes right back to digital. </s>
<s> Almost as if i dont have an AVG cable connected. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> More clues please. </s>
