I bought a time capsule, intending to use it as a media server but how am I going to backup these files if I store them on a time capsule. Alternatively I can store them on a portable external hard drive. I think that is a better option actually but how am I going to back up an external hard drive? Appreciate some advice.

Remember that such things are not &quot;storage&quot; since one slip of the mouse button and we've deleted or formatted a drive. So the old IT lore of backup rules is written over and over. Safety in numbers and in location. A single backup is not safe enough. Bob
