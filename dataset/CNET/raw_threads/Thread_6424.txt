I am considering purchasing an external Hard Drive to re-load these programs on so they will be usable. Will this work? As it stands programs try to open, but then close again. Thanks

Perhaps the best case would be a good cleanup, AV and pest scan and attempts to reinstall your apps. At worst (and this may not be a bad choice) backup what you can and completely restore your system. You can add an external then. If your USB is 1.1 and not 2, I would not put an external drive on it at all. The performance of the original USB specifications is pathetic in comparison to USB 2.
