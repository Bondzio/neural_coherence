1.1.1	Okay so I've gone through like 4 computers in the past year (jeez, I know!)	St
1.1.2	and I finally received one that has a wonderful DVD drive!	St
1.1.3	I like this one.	St
1.1.4	Which is why I decided to buy a video card for it (uh-oh, investing in a computer when so many have been sucking!?)	St
1.1.5	so I could play the Sims and WoW.	Sug
1.1.6	I must feed my addiction.	St
1.1.7	Anyway.	St
1.1.8	The ISSUE.	St
1.1.9	I purchased a Sparkle GeForce 8400 GS Video Card - 512MB DDR2, PCI, DVI, VGA, S-Video from Tigerdircet.com.	St
1.1.10	I really don't know much about computers and the guys on Yahoo!	St
1.1.11	Answers said this video card will be fine and a whole bunch of garbage about how PCI express is better (I know that, I did my research, but this beast of a computer is a PCI dealio!	St
1.1.12	), so I went with the card.	St
1.1.13	I got it and ran to install it, the generic &quot;quick install guide&quot; confusing me a bit, but it's not too hard to figure out.	St
1.1.14	I got excited and turned on the computer.	St
1.1.15	BAM.	St
1.1.16	No video on the monitor.	St
1.1.17	Like, wtf?	St
1.1.18	So I try it in all the ports (I have 3) and cleaned everything up (carefully), but I keep having to revert to the motherboard video card.	St
1.1.19	So I start looking up help from Sparkle (why shouldn't the manufacturer be able to help me?).	St
1.1.20	I registered my product and all that jazz, went to tech support, and the site had the nerve to ask me questions such as: What's your motherboard model NO?	St
1.1.21	Memory Type and Capacity?	St
1.1.22	Power Supply Wattage?	St
1.1.23	Brand of Power Supply?	St
1.1.24	Blah blah blah?	St
1.1.25	So I decided to get on the forums of CNET before I call and talk to some Indian guy for an hour to get nowhere.	St
1.1.26	Let me tell you what's a bit sketchy.	Sug
1.1.27	The box has a bunch of stickers on it.	St
1.1.28	The one with my model and serial numbers is right (M/N: SF-PC84GS512U2LP), but there's one that has a picture of a PCI express card.	St
1.1.29	Uhh, not what I ordered.	St
1.1.30	Plus, when I went online to download a thorough manual, it was only for AGP or PCI Express.	St
1.1.31	When I clicked the manual for my specific card!	St
1.1.32	The box doesn't even look how it should.	St
1.1.33	I don't think I have a PCI express card because it doesn't have any hangy-downer-things (excuse my unsophistication, that's just how much I need help).	St
1.1.34	So yeah.	St
1.1.35	Anybody have any ideas as to why I can't get video?	St
1.1.36	And where can I find the info Sparkle was asking for me?	Ques
1.1.37	(Please bear in mind I do NOT have any manuals.	St
1.1.38	Which is why I came here.)	St
1.1.39	Thank yuh!	St
1.2.1	I won't duplicate the web but why should it work?	St
1.2.2	You didn't write much about the host machine and maybe it's one you have to change the bios?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
