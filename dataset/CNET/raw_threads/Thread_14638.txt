Since my memory is not the best, I would like to be able to set this up with the minimal effort. I need this to mainly back up business data, but the holiday snaps might be a good idea too. I've been looking into a number of things, thinking that a RAID 1 Solution would be the best, mirroring all the data I have. I'd looked at the Western Digital Pro/Premium II, NAS devices, external SATA drives , people at work mention that all I would need to do would be to add a Hard Drive to my machine and do either Software Raid or if the machine supports it Hardware Raid. I'm just wondering what the best solution would be, if there is any special software that I should be using. Willing to spend up to $600 to get this in place and would like the solution to not effect the performance of it too much. Any help would be gratefully received. Cheers, Stuart

If you restart your computer everytime you use it, you can write a 'batch file' that is placed in your startup folder that can copy data from one drive to another. That other folder could be another computer accessed through a network. I don't have that great of memory, but I get by through using a dvd burner every month. Thats all I need becuase my data doesnt change dramitically every few days. A raid 1 will only help if your computer crashes becuase of bit rot, or a defective drive. Usually data is lost becuase of user error, an incomplete backup before an OS reinstall. You want a backup solution that is out of the case of your computer and most preferably off the same fuse (In case of electrical surge). Good luck finding an easy way to backup data.

RAID will not help you if you delete something and find you need it a few days or few months later. the maxtor one-touch and western digital mybook both come with automatic backup software for far less than $600. maxtor onetouch 3, 300gb, $155: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822144055 wd mybook premium, 250gb, $135: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822136027
