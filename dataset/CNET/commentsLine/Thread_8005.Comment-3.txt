its like windows xp, it says it can run on 128mb of ram but you should probobly have 256mb.
so in this case it probobly means you should have 1gb, which is much more do able then 4gb.
what do you mean by under the hood?
does that mean just over all better performance?
oh and the artice mentions you need a good gpu.
do you think it would turn off all the extra effects while you are playing a game?
its bad enough that windows wastes a lot of your processing power when playing a game... it would really suck if windoes also started watering down your gpu.
