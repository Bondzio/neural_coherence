1.1.1	Hi : I was recently given a Dell Inspiron 6000 Notebook computer .	St
1.1.2	I was told it has wireless internet , but am not able to get it to work .	St
1.1.3	It has Intel Centrino technology .	St
1.1.4	A Pentium M Processor .	St
1.1.5	It does have a WiFi symbol which i am guessing lights up when WiFi is used , near where the caps lock icon is .	St
1.1.6	However , when I go into device manager , it only shows 1394 Net Adapter , under Network adapters .	St
1.1.7	Any idea what I am doing wrong ?	Ques
1.1.8	If this system does not have wireless , is there a way to upgrade it , besides an external wireless card ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks !	St
1.1.10	!	St
1.2.1	will have an available internal PCI slot which can be used for a wireless adapter .	St
1.3.1	Is that Microsoft does n't fetch all the needed drivers .	St
1.3.2	A situation like yours would result .	St
1.3.3	There is a CD from dell you install after the OS install to get all the parts working .	St
1.3.4	Did you try that ?	Ques
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Hi : Thanks for your reply .	Polite
1.4.2	This system was used , and they had it reset so I would n't have to deal with all their stuff on the cumputer .	St
1.4.3	They gave me the Windows XP installation disk , and several others , but no Dell CD like the one you mention , I asked and they said they gave me all the CDs they could find , so I guess it must be lost .	St
1.4.4	Is there somewhere I can download it from ?	Ques
1.4.5	Thanks again !	St
1.4.6	!	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Hi : I looked inside , and yep , there is a wireless card .	St
1.6.2	Which leads me to believe that Bob is absolutely right about the missing disk .	St
1.6.3	I looked on Dell 's site , and found several downloads for my computer .	St
1.6.4	Any idea which one I need ?	Ques
1.6.5	Is it something called a chipset , or maybe quickset ?	Ques
1.6.6	Do I need to re-install Windows again to install this , or can I just install it right now , with Windows and other items I have since installed ?	Ques
1.6.7	Your help is so appreciated !	Polite
1.6.8	Thanks so much !	St
1.6.9	!	St
1.7.1	I do n't ask for that since you see that request in red letters with every post you make .	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	Hi Bob : The page for my computer is found at http : //support.dell.com/support/downloads/devices.aspx ? c=us & cs=19 & l=en & s=dhs & SystemID=INS_PNT_6000 & os=WW1 & osl=EN # There are many options listed , and I am not sure which is the one/ ones I need .	St
1.8.2	Thanks again !	St
1.9.1	& quot ; Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller	St
1.10.1	Hi : Thanks so much to Bob , YOU ARE A GENIUS !	St
1.10.2	Got the wireless working , thanks to you .	Polite
1.10.3	Sorry I did n't provide the right info earlier , I had no idea there were many wireless options available for the same computer .	St
1.10.4	I thought you were asking for the model number of the computer Now , I was wondering how do I determine which mouse/touchpad I have , in order to update the drivers .	St
1.10.5	It seems to be missing several options , such as scrolling etc..	St
1.10.6	Thanks again for being so helpful , you are my hero !	St
1.11.1	If you ca n't sort out which try those tools ( Belarc , Everest ) to narrow it down .	St
1.11.2	The exact model number might help .	St
1.11.3	There were many variants of the 6000 .	St
1.11.4	Bob PS .	St
1.11.5	Hey , you 're doing the hard work .	St
1.11.6	I 'm just pointing or shining a dim light on the path .	St
1.12.1	Hi Bob : Is there any way to find my exact model number ?	Ques
1.12.2	I went into System Information , and it has loads of things listed , but I do not see what could be the exact model .	St
1.12.3	I looked on the back of the computer to see if there was any additional info .	St
1.12.4	Again , lost of numbers etc ... , but I do n't see what could be the exact model number .	St
1.12.5	I tried Belarc , it did give some info , but still no exact model , or what type of mouse i have .	St
1.12.6	I have the service tag number , does that help any ?	Ques
1.12.7	Again , thanks so much !	Polite
1.12.8	!	St
1.13.1	Look for a place to put that in at dell.com Bob	St
1.14.1	I entered the info at dell.com , and it listed all kinds of components originally installed , it even analyzed and listed ones currently installed , however it lists everything but the mouse pad .	St
1.14.2	I am also having trouble finding a driver for my ethernet controller .	St
1.14.3	It lists it with an exclamation point in device manager .	St
1.14.4	Ugh !	St
1.14.5	I should be very happy my aunt gave me this beautiful computer , but it is really proving to be a pain .	St
1.14.6	I think she thought she was doing me a favor by removing all her old work stuff , but I think it would have been much easier had she left it as is .	St
1.14.7	Can you think of any solution to finding the right drivers , short of paying those jerks at dell who wo n't even talk to me unless I pay them ?	Ques
1.14.8	Thanks again !	St
1.14.9	!	St
1.15.1	Great news !	St
1.15.2	I got it working .	St
1.15.3	Installed the correct mouse drivers , and even figured out the ethernet controller drivers also .	St
1.15.4	Now , my last challenge is how to transfer my files and programs from my old computer to my new one .	St
1.15.5	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.15.6	I have an ethernet canle to join the two , and have set up a network .	St
1.15.7	Do I just copy from one to the other , or is there another method which must be followed ?	Ques
1.15.8	I have tried copying and pasting , but things still do n't show up on my new comoputer .	St
1.15.9	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.15.10	Thanks again !	St
1.15.11	!	St
1.16.1	That has to do with a change in Windows circa 1995 .	St
1.16.2	Your files however will be just a copy and paste .	St
1.16.3	Bob	St
1.17.1	I really just wanted to say thank you again for the huge help you 've been !	St
1.17.2	I could n't have done it without you !	St
