<s> Hello, Can someone say something about AMD Athlon 64 (not FX or X2)? </s>
<s> Bad/good? </s>
<s> Is an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ enough to play new games with (with 1gb ram, 128mb rather good graph card)? </s>
<s> Should I buy a AMD Athlon 64 FX instead? </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Is it worth it (I'm a bit short of money)? </s>
<s> MVH Oskar R </s>
<s> Are you building anew or upgrading an existing system? </s>
<s> How much money are you willing to spend on a new processor? </s>
<s> and a &quot;128mb rather good card&quot;, i dont see how it wont be able to play new games. </s>
<s> probably better than me setup. </s>
<s> 512mb of ram, fx5200. </s>
<s> p4 no ht. </s>
<s> and it can play nfsmw at the very lowest settings. </s>
<s> but it can handle flight sim 2004, warcraft III pretty good, doom 3 at 800x600 on medium settings no aa, pretty much everything on low settings. </s>
<s> i would say get an amd 3800+ dual core. </s>
<s> not that expensive, not that cheap. </s>
<s> and it would be worth it. </s>
<s> that can justify the FX price. </s>
<s> There's a lot of the standard AMD 64's that are just fine for you. </s>
