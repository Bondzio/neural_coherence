<s> I had three tablets in my mind:- 1) Ipad 2) Innoversal Lattice Tablet 3) Notion Ink Adam Tablet Ipad has a very glossy LCD screen, which is bad for reading. </s>
<s> Lattice & Adam have Pixel-Qi screens, and while I was hesitating between one and the other, I found that neither do the job, as they are also both glossy, with the Adam using some protective matte thing (not real matte screen). </s>
<s> So, I want a tablet for reading, and I want it to have an OS (like Android) to do some other work; what do you suggest? </s>
<s> A side question: is that screen protective that some use on Ipad a good one just like a matte screen? </s>
<s> I thought all the units were prototypes! </s>
