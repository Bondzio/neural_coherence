i have been using &quot;regcure&quot; by paretologic technologies for several years without major problems.
also i use in conjuction with it: &quot;system mechanic pro 8&quot; by iolo technologies, ccleaner and a new one i stumbled upon: &quot;netcom3&quot; which will optimize your registry, search for parasites, and can be used side-by-side with your current antivirus program.
it includes pop-up blockers, site guards, system back-up and more !!!
the two i like most are system mechanic (which i've use around 5 years now) it will speed up your internet connection you speak of as well as many other individual utilities within it to keep your computer running in top shape.
my second favorite i used in the last six months or so: netcom3.
a good defragmentation program such as &quot;diskeeper&quot; will help if you do a lot of uninstalling/downloading, ect., like i do.
good luck....check them out!!
