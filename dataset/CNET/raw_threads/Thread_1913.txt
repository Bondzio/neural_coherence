That list posted by ramarc looks good; I'd just change the video card to this Radeon X1800XT for $200 from newegg. That card is faster than both the 7900GS and X1900GT. Hell, it's as fast as the much-pricier 7900GT.

561	18	200947	2164217	2162360	ngmofm	8/28/06 6:55 PM	1.1567913E12	??	why do you want to build a computer yourself when you can customize a pc on like alienware's site or like a dell xps or hp for a good price that are great manufacturers for gaming and multimedia with space to download things. you dont need 2 gig ram even with high end games. I have BF2 and call of duty 2. These are games that reguire more than counter strike games and i still have space. also.... why would you buy products from bidding sites. The littlest thing can mess any type of card. If you build your own pc dont get things that are on bidding cause you cant always take their word if they say it's new or if it's in good condition. o yea are you also getting accessories like a printer, router, etc....
561	19	200947	2166264	2164217	upperg	8/29/06 7:14 PM	1.15687884E12	if you didnt happen to know i tried doing customize	in alienware i tried customize and doing the same thing part by part or different brand alienware comes out 1900$ and the parts comes out 1230$ yes with printer/scanner combo keyboard and 19&quot; screen
