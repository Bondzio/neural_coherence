<s> Look at your hardware configuration under Device Manager. </s>
<s> Click on Processors. </s>
<s> How many do you show? </s>
<s> If you show 2, HT is enabled and recognized. </s>
<s> ASUS boards come with a nice manual. </s>
<s> They have several pages on BIOS configuration. </s>
<s> The book should contain this. </s>
<s> If you have not manual, they can be found and downloaded on the ASUS site. </s>
<s> On my ASUS board, the HT setting is under Advanced/CPU configuration. </s>
<s> See if you have anything like this. </s>
<s> I didn't have to do anything to make this work. </s>
<s> If you have a HT enabled CPU, and have either XP pro or XP home with sp1 slippstreamed into the distorbution media, then HT worked fine for me. </s>
<s> I got in a older HP media cenetr PC that was stripped except for the cpu and MoBo. </s>
<s> Three finger csalute the machine and see how many CPUs taskmanager sees. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work I will look in the Bios. </s>
