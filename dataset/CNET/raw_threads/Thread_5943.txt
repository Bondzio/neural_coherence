When i go to mycomp and right click and go to performance a lot of times at resources it says 8% or lower but at startup it says 60%. but using the program optimize memory i downloaded, it said i had like 118 mb of ram available. I think that windows is making a mistake. Is there a way to correct this?

Getting more meory does not help resources in thew slightest. Re memory use by Windows, Windows uses exactly as much memory it needs at the moment, no more. Resources are basically used upo by havint too many programs opening at boot and subsequently. Most meory managers are purely smoke and mirrors. Windows handles memory just fine. [resources, amnother problem]. Here's a link re start up loading. http://aumha.org/a/loads.php Another resource issues is related to programs that are resource leakers, they take resources and don't return them. Here's a link to the general area of that same site. Plenty of info thewre to answer your questions/solve your resource problem. http://www.aumha.org/articles.php

As I recall I gave you a link to the Newbie's forum about the resource issue/startup progs. Did you follow Griff's advice? Get BRUTAL in that area, make it so clean it squeaks. WinME is not a business system, you can't go willy-nilly loading and running masses of things at the same time, it won't work. You could install 10x the ram but resources won't change. Resources are the killer.
