I have random pixels that are strangely coloured all around the screen, things are still visible. I am fairly sure it isn't dead pixels as my main monitor is very new, and when i play my xbox 360 through it, it doesnt seem to occur, i have uninstalled and reinstalled different video drivers and it has had no affect. My specs are as follows.. XP SP2 Evga Nvidia 7900gt/ko acer 22'widescreen and if you need any other specs dont mind asking.

Some videos i open will suddenly stop and the computer freezes, then crashes. I crashed while running a test in ATItool and it also says i have high amounts of artifacting... is there anything other then buying a new card that i can do or...?
