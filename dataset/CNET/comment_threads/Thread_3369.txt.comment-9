Hello.
Well you did not specify a budget, but here is a good computer for the needs you listed at the beginning of this forum.
I would recommend a HP d4100e.
http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_series.do?series_name=d4100e_series&catLevel=2&category=desktops/hp_pavilion&storeName=computer_store This would be a great computer for video editing and listen to your most favorite music files.
Another option is to build your own like recommended by &quot; Francisjakee &quot; .
One other thing, do not buy from: 1.
Dell 2.
Gateway Good Luck with your search.
