i am sorry to report that you are living on borrowed time.
hard drives are mechanical devices with platters that are spinning at thousands of revolutions per minute and like a set of tires on a car, it is not a question of if they will fail but when?
unfortunately, it is next to impossible to predict a hard drive failure which is why having multiple backups is so important.
the average life of a hard drive is typically thought to be about 5 years.
although many factors such as handling, temperature and just plain luck of the draw can result in failures at anytime.
i personally find in my business that laptop drives are lasting about 3 years and desktop drives about 5, but all it takes is to drop your laptop once and you could be done.
external hard drives use the very same hard drives that are found in desktop and laptop computers, however, i have found that they dont seem to last nearly as long.
maybe, users drop or mishandle them more, maybe it is poor cooling, or just plugging and unplugging them incorrectly.
as far as maintenance goes, other than keeping the drive defragmented and always using the safely remove hardware icon before unplugging your drive, there is not much else you can do except avoiding any sudden shock to the drive (especially while it is turned on).
you should treat an external hard drive as though it were a carton of eggs and never, ever use one as your only working copy of any data that you care about without having additional backups.
drives are so inexpensive now that simply replacing them every few years is probably the best course of action.
