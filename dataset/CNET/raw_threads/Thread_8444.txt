12628	0	3459	41152	NR	theTrash	11/19/03 9:05 PM	1.0692759E12	drivers search	My friend has this HP Pavilion 7935 Desktop PC which came with WinXP, 1.3 GHz AMD, 128 MB RAM. He had some problems with it and now, after a format, he has Win2K Pro on one of two partitions. The display adapter has been installed after heavy searching. The Network Adapter was automatically installed by Win2K. Now I need to install the modem and Audio drivers but don't know the manufacturer/model. The HP site was not helpful. Does anyone know this machine (HP Pavilion 7935) and what modem and Sound Card it has? or Do you know a utility that will tell me the manufacturer/model/make etc. of the hardware BEFORE it has been installed and working? Belarc only tells me stuff about hardware that is already installed with the correct drivers. I need to install the drivers for the modem and the sound card but don't know the manufacturer/make/model etc. in order to do a search.
