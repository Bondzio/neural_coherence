i am a junior it manager and i need to strongly protect all my applications software on an external drive.
in such a way that nobody would be able to copy or paste anything into the drive but at the same time they should be able to run an executable / installer from same drive i.e we should be able to run any software installation from same drive... pls kindly help me with answers!
