dell computers, and sony computers, are the most eco-conscious computers with regard to toxic chemicals (i.e greenpeace's electronic report) my dell precision m90 laptop is extremely solid.
it contains aluminum, steel, and thick rubber on the bottom.
it has been dropped from a backpack onto a sidewalk and the &quot;strike zone&quot; technology kicked in, i did not lose any data and when i booted it up, the websites i had been working on as well as the word documents i had been utilizing all popped up.
the keyboard is extremely solid.
it is not &quot;mushy&quot; like apple computer keys.
i plan to consider the dell xps 13'' notebook-the industrial design is exquisite!
as well as alienware's magnesium alloy cased 17''' laptop(also made by dell)
