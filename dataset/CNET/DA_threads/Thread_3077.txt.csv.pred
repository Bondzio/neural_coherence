1.1.1	A friend of mine asked me to try to remove a partition from his hard drive .	St
1.1.2	It 's an older computer and was set up with two 2gig partitions on a 4 gig hard drive .	St
1.1.3	But I think I made the serious mistake of searching google for deleting a partition instead of combining one .	St
1.1.4	Anyways , I followed a page like this http : //www.cybertechhelp.com/html/tutorials/tutorial.php/id/36 and removed the partition , and now I only have the C : drive and it seems like I 've essentially lost the other 2 gigs .	St
1.1.5	Is there anything I can do to either get these 2 gigs back onto the c : drive or restore the 2 gig d : drive .	St
1.1.6	I 've tried a few free partition programs such as Partition Resizer but these do n't even seem to detect that there are 2 gigs on the hard disk doing nothing .	St
1.1.7	Any advice appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	http : //www.partition-recovery.com/ Frankly , if you do n't backup data , then you are revealing how important the data is .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Right .	St
1.3.2	The data was of no importance to me at all .	St
1.3.3	I just wanted to get the 2 gigs back onto the c : drive .	St
1.3.4	Could n't get it to work with partition recovery but partition magic did it .	St
1.3.5	Thanks !	St
