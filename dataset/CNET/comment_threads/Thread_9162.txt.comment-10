http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?dlc=en&lc=en&product=60596&lang=en&cc=us&docname=bph06430 released about the same time as my old HP box...except on the complete opposite end of the product line... you got zero AGP an 800MHZ Celeron 128MB of RAM (stock, i think yours is at?
384?)
yeah, i'd say it's time for a new PC...at least if your a &quot;power user&quot; of sorts... i'd stay away from machines in that thing's original price range...how about a DIY?
