your memory and graphics card are the issue here.
the gma3000 is an integrated card i think and so at higher resolutions it needs more memory which isn't available.
one solution to try first is to increase the memory to a gigabyte of ram and see how well that solves some things.
the better one is to see if that mobo supports a pci-e card and if so then look at getting something like a 7000 series nvidia geforce card or you could look at some of the mid to upper ati cards for another idea.
