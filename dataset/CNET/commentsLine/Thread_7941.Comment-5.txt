quick followup.
some friends told me to open the case and plug hd inside the computer as a slave.
i'm not really sure what that means, or how to do it.
i open the case and unplug the hd.
then i open the tower and plug in the hd?
where?
will it be obvious?
do i have to plug in a power supply for the hd, too?
