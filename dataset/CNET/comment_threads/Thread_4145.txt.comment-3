I have tried different components for everything except the DSL modem and since it is the the only common component in my internet connection, I suspect it the most.
I like your suggestion about trying parts elsewhere.
It seems that there are a lot of people that have signals drop out, routers/NICs/modems fail, & ISPs with shaky service.
I think that this time we live in with computers is similar to the 1920s for automobiles.
They worked but needed attention too frequently to keep them going.
Thanks!
