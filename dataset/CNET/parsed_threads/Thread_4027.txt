<s> I have a computer running xp(home) P4, To improve its performance I have changed its Power unit to 400W,and changed its video card to 256MHz . </s>
<s> Now I wish to install a sound card. </s>
<s> It has not got a sound card at the moment, I have bought an Audiophile 2496, M-Audio Card. </s>
<s> I have been advised to disable m/b sound capacity, (M/B is MATSONIC, MS9327E+(USB) Socket 478, sis 650GL Chipset Pentium 4. </s>
<s> It's sound on board is rather good but not good enough I wish to install the PCI card which I have bought. </s>

<s> computer and enter the &quot;BIOS Setup&quot; (usually the &lt;DELETE&gt; key). </s>
<s> Depending on what BIOS you have is where in the BIOS you'll find where to disable motherboard sound. </s>
<s> Your motherboard manual will assist you in this. </s>
<s> Might as well get the latest BIOS and install it while you're at it. </s>
<s> Those can be found at the motherboard's website. </s>

<s> Thank you Jackintucson, It has been &quot;no no&quot; area thus far, but I am going to try it and shall report.There is an &quot;Audio device&quot; in the &quot;Features Setup Page of the BIOS Setup Utility,which enable /disable onboard AC'97 audio chip whatever it means. </s>
<s> I have tried once before, unsuccessfully, to update the BIoS once before, but could not find the correct number of the M/B on the Matsonic web site, this time I shall persist a bit more. </s>
<s> Thanks for help. </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>

<s> Yes the AC'97 is the onboard sound. </s>
<s> set it to disable, then save and exit the BIOS. </s>
<s> If you are not having any problems with your computer that an updated BIOS is supposed to fix, leave it alone. </s>
<s> You do not have to upgrade your BIOS to go into it and make simple changes such as disabling audio. </s>
<s> You can be in a big mess if something goes wrong during a BIOS update. </s>
<s> If you like to learn, when you have time, do a Google search on BIOS upgrading in general, and go to your motherboard manufacturer's web site in particu;lar, and learn about it (including possible recovery options if it goes bad) before you attempt it. </s>
