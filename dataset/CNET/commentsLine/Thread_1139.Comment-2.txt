a long time ago, alloy made such a card you put in the pc to accomplish this.
today it's ancient history since a pc is cheaper than what you are asking windows to do.
but if you want to try an old ascii terminal on some serial port, just load linux and attach terminals on serial ports and log on.
i will not respond to more pleas to get such working... because it's dead tech.
