i have a wdc wd2500jd-75hbco (233 gb)hard drive in there now.
it says that there is 229 gb (182gb-80% free space)ntfs i don't think that more hard disk space is nessasary with all that free space.
running xp home he has these games on.
desert combat battle field 2 call of duty 2 postal 2 delta force black hawlk down i have a nvidia ge force 6800. the system gets slow some times when he is doing online gaming etc.
i thought that the extra memory to juggle with might help.
i don't really know anything about computers so maybe i'm wrong.
