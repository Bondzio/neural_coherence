<s> OS: Windows XP Professional Drive: Standard 48x/16x/48x CD RW drive ALthough the LED lights on the outside of the drive are on, which means that is recieving power, when I push the eject button the cd draw doesn't eject, instead the drive just makes a buzzng noise. </s>

<s> This is frequently due to the gears inside getting jammed or off track. </s>
<s> In the front of the drive is a very small hole, big enough to put in a straigtened paperclip. </s>
<s> Put one in and it will push the drawer out and open. </s>
<s> Sometimes opening and reclosing it will fix the problem with it ejecting, other times you just trash it and buy a replacement...since they are in the $25 range these days. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> This sorted the problem right away. </s>
<s> No replacement needed! </s>
