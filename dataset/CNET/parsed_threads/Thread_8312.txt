<s> works fine on reinstall, but gets weary having to repeatedly do that. </s>
<s> why would you think that is happening? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> I've never had to install such drivers. </s>
<s> For instance Windows has PS2 mouse and keyboard drivers that are just dandy fine. </s>
<s> I only find problems with replacements. </s>

<s> the ones from windows xp. </s>
<s> i go into hardware devices under the system menu. </s>
<s> then uninstall mouse and keyboard drivers. </s>
<s> then reinstall both. </s>
<s> then it works. </s>
<s> cant be the ps2 ports themselves because they do work after the reinstall. </s>
<s> not the devices cause they work fine on my other computer. </s>
<s> i dont know what the deal is on the ps2 drivers in this computer. </s>
