have you ever given thought to buying local??
i am biased here because i build custom pcs for a living.
&quot;us&quot; smaller custom shops can pull parts from a larger pool and monitor each part for the best warranties/performance.
i start of each sale by asking the customer what they want/expect their pc to do and we build from there.
i encourage customer input and their own research.
did hp offer you a case or a power supply with a lifetime warranty, how about 5 years on a hard drive???
every new system i sell is set-up and running when the customer picks it up because i want them to sit down and play a little before packing it up.
that way i can answer any questions they have and show them where everything plugs in.
