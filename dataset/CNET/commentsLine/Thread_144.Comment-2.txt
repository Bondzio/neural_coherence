i would use to achieve your goal is: 1) change the default password of the router (so trespassers cannot gain entrance to the router's settings).
2) change the default ssid of the router (so trespassers do not what type of router you have).
3) enable mac filtering and allow only those mac addresses for your wireless devices.
wep/wpa is another layer i have yet to find necessary in most home environs.
