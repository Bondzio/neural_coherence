canon i455 a few years old.
was connected to my pc and shared across my network.
a few months ago i got a nas and connected the printer there, still shared, worked perfectly (didn't have to turn my pc on for others to print).
tried to print a text file this morning, no text.
print head moved but no black ink (yes, new cartridge).
did a nozzle check and all colors and black printed.
tried text file again, everything moved but no text.
moved the printer back to my pc and did a nozzle check.
all ok. tried to print the document, no text.
created a document in word, same-same.
changed the color of the text to blue and voila!
so, it's not printing black.
all printer tests work but no black on any document.
time for a new printer?
