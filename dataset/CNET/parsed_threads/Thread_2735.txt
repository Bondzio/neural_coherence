<s> I want to make everyone aware of this!! </s>
<s> I have an HP Pavilion 1703 monitor. </s>
<s> After 5 seconds it blacks out. </s>
<s> I called HP in November 2005, and they told me I was no longer under warranty and could buy a new one. </s>
<s> I did not, but decided to continue to get info. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I found out that they have admitted that some HP 1703 monitors have existing &quot;hardware issues&quot; which HP is NOW willing to replace! </s>
<s> Below is the link. </s>
<s> If you speak to an HP service rep to tell them about your problem, they don't tell you anything about the replacement unless you KNOW ABOUT IT. </s>
<s> Stinks. </s>
<s> But true. </s>
<s> Please pass this along!!! </s>
