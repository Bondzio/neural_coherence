Proffitt	1/5/05 11:03 AM	1.10492298E12	today	looking opterons xeons dual cpu design however ht version show dual cpus windows nt xp linux pretty darn good transcoding sessions good price compared dual cpu opteronxeon based computers today id ghz mhz fsb later year dual core athlon bob

15294	4	55259	658807	658690	revpsychology	1/5/05 12:34 PM	1.10492844E12	motherboards	motherboards good cost effective build decent dual processor system below possible thought amd processors could dual processors motherboard supported multi core faster dual processor systems nowdays though sound same really dumb comes putting computer together good putting processor motherboard those picked take bought system find many places online sell dual processor desktops thanks
15294	5	55259	658844	658807	R. Proffitt	1/5/05 12:51 PM	1.10492946E12	dual athlons	those were friendly builders most builders tried shortchange power supply case cooling pc build happy many places sell dual cpu boards premium product bob

15294	8	55259	659052	658900	carl4286	1/5/05 2:32 PM	1.10493552E12	heres good board	subwebaddr board supports dual xeon processors ghz peice support gbs dual channel ddr ram pci express works board dual processors most likely cost themselves
15294	9	55259	661706	659052	jcrobso	1/6/05 2:52 PM	1.10502312E12	heres good board	never said using anyway built dual processor piii tualitin ghz gb ram years ago fast time render min vedio segment min complete seti unit hours got everything off ebay ended spending amd xp outrun amd eat alvie seti unit hours remember encoding dvd video app multitasking matter how fast processor those programs take cpus cycles getit done faster add cost expensive superfast pc fast pcs reasonible cost pcs kvm switch switch different pc rendering video choice john subwebaddr
