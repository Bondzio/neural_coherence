1.1.1	How do I install a secondary internal IDE HDD into my desktop ?	Ques
1.1.2	My primary drive ( 40GB ) is working fine on the Master connection and I 've tried mounting my secondary ( 20 gig ) and connecting it to the Slave plug ( with jumpers set right ) , but no detection of second drive or extra space has been reported .	St
1.1.3	It 's a used drive , but , while I once temporarily connected it as the only drive , I 've already formatted it .	St
1.1.4	And I have since changed the jumper from Primary to Secondary ( and moved it from Master to Slave on the ribbon ) , but neither new space nor new drive is yet reported .	St

1.2.1	If the drives are not too old you might try setting both drives to the cable select jumper position and use a new 80 wire IDE cable .	St
1.3.1	the make and model of the drive would help finding a solution in stand alone you had it as primary Master , in secondary , is it secondary Master or Slave ?	Ques
1.3.2	secondary usualy ties to the second IDE plug on the motherboard for a second cable which is usualy used for 4 devices Hard drives or CD , DVD etc .	St
1.4.1	Maybe you should check the BIOS setup to make sure all the IDE drives ( Primary Mast / Slave and Secondary Mast / Slave ) are set to AUTO .	Sug
1.4.2	Since you have not mentioned the OS and if it 's a DoS based one like Win9x , then on Bootup you should see a quick flash of the Pheripherals detected - FDD 's , HDD 's , etc .	St
1.4.3	Hope this helps ... ..	St
