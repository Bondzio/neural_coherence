this discussion is due to a complete lack of understanding exactly how wireless anything works, so please excuse my ignorance.
our office is running xp pro with dsl to a netgear router then to a 24 port netgear hub, that everything is hardwired to.
we have recently undergone a medical software change from a server to a web based program.
in order to maximize utilization of our new software, a wireless connection has become necessary.
the office is hardwired to all computer stations, but we are trying to implement tablet pc's (toshiba tecra with wifi), which will be carried into the patient exam rooms by the physician, where a patient charge slip will be created.
i need for the tablet to be able to communicate with the network so that it will not only create the &quot;super bill&quot; on line, but also communicate with the print router to print out patient receipts.
my question is what kind of equipment do i need to achieve this?
i want the best, most secure, and fastest system for my money, and really don't know where to start.
any advice on this would be greatly appreciated, as i am trying to save as much money as possible.
dr's don't make what they used to.
