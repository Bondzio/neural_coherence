I used the MS trackball...thumb version... for years.
I never did like the ball sticking but didn't want the Logitech because it only had 3 buttons, no forward and back buttons.
I finally broke down and got the Logitech and I'm glad I did.
Smooth, smooth, smooth.
I'm still getting used to navigating pages with the explorer foward and back buttons, though.
It's much smaller, too.
