for a long time, and I don't have a problem with their drivers or tech support.
I've never had to call them on the phone, but their email tech support is usually pretty good for me once I was able to get past the language barrier for some of them.
I wasn't crazy about the programs that installed along with the drivers and found some of them confusing to use and went to other programs that were easier, but all in all, I haven't had much to complain about.
The programs were just a personal preference with me.
What kinds of problems have you encountered or was your question just one in general as a comparison type of ATI vs others?
