I have two Xboxes connected to the router, one wired, and one wireless. I'm trying to get both of the Xboxes to have an open NAT, but I haven't had any luck. I spoke with a Cisco tech, and they had me do &quot;Port Range Triggering&quot; for 80 and 3074, change MTU to 1364, uncheck &quot;Filter Anonymous Requests&quot;, and disable &quot;Upnp&quot;. The best it would ever do is make the wired Xbox OPEN, and the wireless one Moderate. But it seemed intermittent, and sometimes the wireless Xbox would change to STRICT. Could you guys maybe give me a hand? Thanks!

Cnet's review wrote &quot;The included desktop application can't be used together with the router's Web interface, and neither provides the complete control over the router's features and functions.&quot; Between that and the failed support I'd return this for a router that is knows to work with Xbox Live.

Which router would you recommend for 2 Xboxes (wired and wireless), a PS3, a Wii, and multiple other devices (iPhones, Laptops). I'd like to stick with an N router, and my primary use for it is gaming. Dual band is also nice. I like the idea of using the 5GHz frequency. Thanks!

While our home uses the simple Netgear http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wireless-n-router/4505-3319_7-33090709.html?tag=lia;rcol it may not work for those that are fascinated by dual band or other than basic router use. There are some that claim it drops but it never has here. However you may guess it's set up exactly as noted in this forum's sticky. I eat my own dog food in other words. Sadly the model you noted failed not once but twice so if the maker is having you play with MTU and more, it is not ready for the field. Bob
