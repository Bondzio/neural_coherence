I recently bought a Seagate 160 GB external HD to use as a backup.
Prior to this I would save any documents on floppies but now with digitial photos and program disks missing (not lost just temporarily misplaced), I wanted to be able to do a full backup.
When I used the XP Backup Wizard I received an error stating that I could not create a file lager than 4GB due to FAT32 formatting on the external drive.
My question is there someway around this in Backup; do I have to reformat the external drive in NTFS or do I have to buy 3rd party software?
Thanks, Rick
