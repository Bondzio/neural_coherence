I need help on the parts, this is for 90% daily gaming and 10% multimedia, prices from 2000-3000 more or less. thx

CPU- AMD Athlon 64 FX-55 (skt.939) Mobo- some ASUS one with 4 DIMM slots and a PCI-Express slot (skt.939) Video Card: ATI Radeon X800 Pro or Nvidia 6800 Ultra RAM: 4x512MB Kingston HyperX RAM Case: NZXT Nemesis Power Supply: Antec 500 Watt True Power Monitor: 19 inch CRT monitor Sound Card: Creative Audigy (different prices) Hard-drive: Seagate 120GB 8MB 7,200RPM u can also probly find the mobo and CPU together in a bundle for cheaper. Even look onto Alienware.com and voodoopc.com if u want them to custom build u one.

The Ram and HB in the previous post is a good choice, if you want a bigger HD you could get a 160bg. In order to keep up with the CPU DRR 3200 is the minium speed. John

Though last time I checked most have dropped their warranty support to one year. And to get a &quot;serial&quot; hdd and cable. Though that won't be hard since &quot;serial&quot; has taken over the market. You could try to get a hdd with 10,000 rpm, though I'm not sure if such extra speed is necessary. The 8mb buffer is nice. Two other considerations. SCSI/raid. Both promise faster performance and both add considerable cost to your PC(especially scsi)
6008	7	62902	754568	751486	cv4stm	2/10/05 12:47 PM	1.10803962E12	RAM and Hardrive	if u still wanna get really good stuff, go with the: RAM- Kingston HyperX PC3200 400MHz (4x512MB) Harddrive- Seagate 160GB 7,200RPM 8MB cache the HyperX is the best RAM that the best RAM company offers. I have also heard lots of really good things about seagate harddrives.
