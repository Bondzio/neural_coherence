Wireless with Dell might a special program. What does the router installation manual say about installing the software? If you don't have it in printed form, it should be on the CD. Kees

If you don't have them on CD, download them from dell.com using your service tag. As I said above, you won't need the router disk, probably. Kees

I formatted the hard drive by using the reinstallation CD that came with the computer. I went to the Bios and get it installed. The computer is running now. I installed Ms Office. But I think the eternet adapter is not activated. I am new doing this but I could not afford to pay to do it as I lost my job. I appreciate any help.
