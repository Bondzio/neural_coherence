1.1.1	My computer is about 3 years old and this is the first time I 'm replacing hardware ( this graphics card ) ... http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814141026 That being said , I 've only got a 250W PSU , which is awful .	St
1.1.2	Can I run this card or will a PSU be necessary ... BTW , I do n't plan on over-using this computer ( I 've got a high end laptop I can play games with ) .	St
1.1.3	So if a PSU upgrade really is n't necessary , I do n't want to buy and install a new one .	St
1.1.4	Also , if you think i should upgrade can you recommend me a certain Wattage to upgrade to ?	Ques
1.1.5	And price range ?	Ques
1.1.6	Maybe a URL link ?	Ques
1.2.1	Most newer video cards want at least 350W psu , but usually to be dependable get a 400W or even a 500W rated psu to be safe .	St
1.2.2	Do n't buy cheap , you will be unhappy in the long run .	St
1.2.3	A namebrand will be fine in the 400W range , like Antec or Enermax , etc.. , so shop again at NewEgg or other online shop .	St
1.2.4	tada -- -- -Willy	St
