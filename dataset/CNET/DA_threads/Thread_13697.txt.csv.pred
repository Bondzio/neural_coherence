1.1.1	Has your external hard drive ( s ) failed on you before ?	Ques
1.1.2	-- Yes .	St
1.1.3	( How so , and what brand ? )	Ques
1.1.4	-- No .	St
1.1.5	( What brand is it ? )	Ques
1.1.6	-- Not yet , but I 'm starting to encounter some problems now .	St
1.1.7	( What problem and what brand ? )	Ques
1.1.8	-- I do n't own an external hard drive .	St
1.2.1	Yes , my I/OMagic harddrive has failed on me before , but it may or may not have been due to carelessness .	St
1.2.2	I was using a very poor quality powerbar and one day there was a power outage ... Well , after that it did n't work .	St
1.2.3	I 'm sure I can maybe fix it somehow , but I do n't feel like it 's even worth it .	St
1.2.4	R.I.P .	St
1.2.5	7000 music files .	St
1.3.1	I 've presently got two connective via USB 2.0 .	St
1.3.2	I 've got an Edge DiskGo !	St
1.3.3	120GB drive that I use primarily to store my MP3 collection and another 120GB SATA drive in a USB enclosure that I use for D2D backup .	St
1.3.4	Like I said - no problems ( yet ) .	St
1.3.5	I happen to agree with the line of thinking that with hard drives , it 's not IF they 'll go bad - it 's WHEN they 'll go bad .	St
1.4.1	WD faileth me !	St
1.4.2	Maxtor has been the best for me ... .but that 's about all I have had .	St
1.5.1	They 've been good to me thus far .	St
1.5.2	I got a new machine two years ago , and then around this time last year , I decided that the 120 GB worth of space was doing me no good if I could n't readily use it , so I bought an Adaptec aluminum drive enclosure and now I 'm using it to expand my storage .	St
1.5.3	So far , so good .	St
1.5.4	Other than an issue with it not coming back to life after standby under Vista , it 's been flawless .	St
1.5.5	And even that , Microsoft has acknowledged the problem .	St
1.6.1	One thing I learned is that the main enemy of external drives is heat .	St
1.6.2	I will never again buy a drive that does n't have a fan , and I do n't care what the manufacturer says .	St
1.6.3	I went through two LaCie drives in short order and went to Avastor which all have nice internal fans and have yet to have any failure .	St
1.6.4	Forget about & quot ; convection cooling & quot ; or the rap that the external wall wart ca n't contribute heat so you do n't need a fan .	St
1.6.5	There 's so much heat coming from the drive itself that it has to be cooled by forced air or your looking for trouble , especially if you use the drive in a hot environment .	St
1.6.6	Now I use Avastor HDX800 series , usually 500 Gigabyte for recording and video editing .	St
1.6.7	They 're extremely fast especially on the high speed firewire bus .	St
1.6.8	They 're not cheap , but are worth the cost .	St
1.6.9	I wo n't even go into how much time and aggravation the other drives cost me through lost data .	St
1.6.10	Now I back up each Firewire drive to another Firewire drive just in case .	St
1.6.11	Eventually it 'll be time for a RAID system so the backing up is automatic , but for now I 'm happy with what the regular FireWire drives are doing .	St
1.7.1	I have a WD 250 Gb Passport external .	St
1.7.2	Use it with a MacBook and Leopard 's Time Machine .	St
1.7.3	No problems .	St
1.7.4	Seamless backups .	St
1.7.5	Easy retrieval , but I really have n't needed it .	St
1.8.1	and it did n't failed me and I hope it wo n't ! !	St
1.8.2	So far I did n't have any hard disk issues with any of my hard disks ( internal and external ) I know it sucks to lose all of your data since my uncle had a problem with his old laptop hard disk and he lost all of his data !	St
1.8.3	( that 's why he bought an ex drive to backup his stuff ) For me I backup my files on my WD external drive , but I do n't trust hard disks that much so I burn my important files on DVDs sometimes .	St
1.9.1	My 120gb Maxtor external USB 2.0 never failed me yet .	St
1.9.2	I 've formatted it plenty of times , took it traveling , dropped it I believe twice , still works without a hitch .	St
1.10.1	It 's a Seagate and I use Seagate for all my customer repairs if they need a hard drive !	St
1.10.2	I have never had trouble with Seagate .	St
1.11.1	I have a Maxtor OneTouch II .	St
1.11.2	To begin , let me point out that I was never able to get the OneTouch function the button on the case that can be used to start a backup to work .	St
1.11.3	However , I still used it very effectively for manually-run backups using Norton Ghost .	St
1.11.4	One day it just would n't work , period .	St
1.11.5	Yes , the drive did spin-up as normal , but nothing I tried would make my XP SP2 system recognize the drive .	St
1.11.6	I de-installed and re-installed the drivers two or more times , but nothing worked .	St
1.11.7	I know drives can simply die for a variety of reasons the electronics , a corruption problem , or even a major mechanical failure but for some reason , I hesitated to believe it was really and totally dead .	St
1.11.8	The only reason why I did n't just & quot ; chuck & quot ; the drive was that it cost me a pretty penny .	St
1.11.9	I also had a feeling it might actually not be busted .	St
1.11.10	I was hopeful for two reasons .	St
1.11.11	First - Because I 'm very easy-going with my hardware ; translation : if a component has high-speed moving parts , I never touch or move it while it 's up and running .	St
1.11.12	Yes , I know they can take a certain amount of jostling , but the way I see it , the less jostling , the better .	St
1.11.13	Second - I kept wondering whether one of my recent Windows updates may have included a patch that rendered the drive unusable .	St
1.11.14	Fast-forward a little .	St
1.11.15	I 'd occasionally retry the drive , but always nothing ... until one day , I clicked the heels of my ruby slippers , and BINGO , it worked again .	St
1.11.16	I ca n't prove it one way or another , but I suspect that one Windows patch broke it , and a subsequent patch fixed it .	St
1.11.17	Note that I 've since moved this drive to my Vista Home Premium system and it worked without having to install any extra drivers .	St
1.11.18	Make sense ?	Ques
1.11.19	Just my two cents worth .	St
1.12.1	When I purchased the current computer , I did n't know until I cracked it open , it uses a SATA drive .	St
1.12.2	I 've always used PATA , and I keep all my non-operating system files on a secondary drive ( WDC 120 gig ) .	St
1.12.3	I quickly learned that SATA and PATA do n't play well together .	St
1.12.4	So , I got one of those kits and mounted and connected the secondary drive through the USB port .	St
1.12.5	Have all my files , and have n't had a problem yet .	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	I have twin 60GB Maxtor external hard drives .	St
1.14.2	I have had them for one at least one year .	St
1.14.3	With an IPOD , a SANSA MP3 player , programming packages -- and I suck as a programmer , and the other & quot ; crap & quot ; on my disks , coupled with my loose use of powerful commands while in my IDEs ( & quot ; FDISK that & quot ; ) , this is pretty good .	St
1.15.1	In all the 17 yrs of computing I had only one hard drive fail .	St
1.15.2	It was one I put in a usb external enclosure .	St
1.15.3	It just totally failed after loud crunching noises were heard .	St
1.15.4	It was out of warranty .	St
1.15.5	It was a backup drive so I really did not lose anything .	St
1.15.6	Bought a new one and did fresh backups .	St
1.16.1	I have two WD externals ; so far , neither has failed , but 1 case did .	St
1.16.2	Got another case for about $ 20 , and all is fine .	St
1.17.1	Sorry forgot to say it was a Western digital .	St
1.18.1	I bought my Western Digital 7200 100 GB drive years ago when they were the largest capacity available .	St
1.18.2	Think about that !	St
1.18.3	I have never had one problem that I can remember .	St
1.18.4	It has all my backup files and still runs like a charm .	St
1.18.5	I have a new 320 GB but just have n't gotten around to installation yet .	St
1.18.6	That 's on the to do list and I hope that gets done before a creash !	St
1.18.7	I 'm still safe though , because I learned years ago to have more than one backup on different media .	St
1.18.8	Flash drives are wonderful for that !	St
1.19.1	I bought a 60 gig Simpletech drive to copy and move files from one computer to the other .	St
1.19.2	When I copy , it does n't just copy ... it destroys .	St
1.19.3	Then the file ca n't be found on the external drive !	St
1.19.4	Obviously this is n't good .	St
1.19.5	I do n't 'think ' it is my fault ... can do the same thing with different external drives fine .	St
1.19.6	So , it looks like Simpletech is just a lemon .	St
1.20.1	Have a Hitachi 40 Gig , Worked great without a hitch for more than 2 years .	St
1.20.2	Still use every day .	St
1.20.3	Have 2 500 Gig Seagates , run constantly , work perfectly , they are silent and cool to the touch .	St
1.20.4	Have 2 Iomega 500 Gig , they are extremely noisy and get too hot to touch after a couple of hours , ca n't remain on for more than minimal time .	St
1.20.5	One crashed and wiped out all my data when only 2 weeks old .	St
1.20.6	Guess what brand I will buy next ?	Ques
1.21.1	I had a western digital hard drive , a my book raid setup it malfunctioned within days and i kept thinking it was a microsoft windows problem .	St
1.21.2	I tried in vain to get help from WD without ANY help for weeks .	St
1.21.3	Finally It completely failed adn then WD told me my warranty was invalid from my purchase at best buy .	St
1.21.4	Avoid these drives .	St
1.22.1	At times I have gone through 2 Maxtor 320 gig external hard drives and 1 Seagate 500 gig drive .	St
1.22.2	I now own a WD 500 gig external and so far so good no problems .	St
1.22.3	Cliff	St
1.23.1	I have had problems with four different drives failing to work properly .	St
1.23.2	The first was with a 40GB Seagate drive that I installed into an external USB box that was to be used for daily backups at work , this unit worked for some time until I believe a Microsoft update stopped it from working , I replaced the drive , and had the same problem , with the same message , then the exact same problem was encountered with with a different drive a WD 200GB unit installed in the same type of device stopped working after updates to my home computer .	St
1.23.3	I might add that all the units were formated NTFS so that drive images could be backed up , and the software used came with the external box called Vipower and Saturn box .	St
1.23.4	I pulled the WD200GB disk and installed it into another computer formatted and installed xp pro and it worked great untill the power supply failed .	St
1.23.5	in the meantime I purchased a WD 60GB Passport drive , that has twice lost all my backup email details , although I was able to retrieve the information using System Mechanic Pro , it has made wary of External HDD backup units , I have had problems with CD and DVD backups as well with errors like & quot ; Cyclic Redundancy & quot ; messages poping up from time to time as well so now I keep multiple digital copies of jpegs and mpegs I want to keep	St
1.24.1	I 've been computerating since Feb. 1995 , and I 've never had a crash or hdd failure .	St
1.24.2	Never had a virus .	St
1.24.3	The worst I ever had was a worm that dialed some porn sites , which I was able to eliminate immediately .	St
1.24.4	I have three external hard drives , all Iomega .	St
1.24.5	I used to have an Iomega zip drive .	St
1.24.6	Hope I have n't jinxed myself by bragging about it !	St
1.24.7	= )	St
1.25.1	I own a WD 400gb Elements external hard drive .	St
1.25.2	I did not want to loose any of my precious pictures or important data so I put it all on the WD .	St
1.25.3	DUMB MOVE !	St
1.25.4	I did not own the drive very long when it failed to function .	St
1.25.5	I tried to view it on several different computers but they did not recognize it .	St
1.25.6	Once I plug the usb plug in , Windows said it was recognized .	St
1.25.7	Yet it did not show up anywhere , even in the systems hardware - device manager or my computer .	St
1.25.8	At this point I would like to say I think WD CSR are just about useless .	St
1.25.9	I emailed , I called , I did everything I was told to do .	St
1.25.10	It took me way too long to finally get a human - weeks and weeks .	St
1.25.11	I am not confident in Western Digitial hard drives any longer , if they had good customer service I would not be so harsh , after all anything can break .	St
1.25.12	The end result is they say the drive is dead , it does not respond ... and it will take hundreds of dollars if I want to sent it back so that my data can be recovered .	St
1.25.13	Not exceptable , poor product , poor customer service .	St
1.25.14	If I may I have a couple of questions .	St
1.25.15	How do I know what type of hd it is ?	Ques
1.25.16	( eeid , sata ? ? ? )	Ques
1.25.17	If there is n't sound do you think it is worth trying an enclosure ?	Ques
1.25.18	Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.25.19	I deleted my data from my computer , very sad .	St
1.25.20	Thanks - Ramona	St
1.26.1	I 've had two Freecom transportable hard drives which I 've used like super thumb drives .	St
1.26.2	The first one was showing signs of failure , so I replaced it .	St
1.26.3	The problem area was the folding USB plug which uses an internal stranded cable .	St
1.26.4	After enough flex cycles , it 's not too surprising that it would fail .	St
1.26.5	So , after a couple of years of reliable service , I began to experience errors .	St
1.26.6	I bought a replacement , transferred the contents , and am now happily using my second one with no more problems .	St
1.26.7	I also took the opportunity to upgrade from a 40GB drive to a 60GB drive .	St
1.26.8	OTOH , I also use a 500GB Seagate Mirra network backup server and it 's been quite reliable baking up 3 Windows machines on my home network 24/7 in the background for the past several years .	St
1.26.9	My only complaint about the Mirra server is that Seagate does n't offer client software to also back up my Linux machines - despite the fact that the Mirra server runs Debian Linux internally .	St
1.27.1	I have a freecom 250GB it caused me no end of problems when I was using the software that was supplied with th hard drive .	St
1.27.2	However I have found that it works great if I dont use their software and use it as a mass storage device letting windows xp discover it with plug and play .	St
1.28.1	That was my experience as well , except I never really even tried the Freecom software .	St
1.28.2	Since WinXP recognizes it as an external HDD , all my access to it is via my file manager .	St
1.28.3	This is consistent with my using it just like a thumb drive .	St
1.29.1	Hi i 'm termed as Oertel on this forum , anyway i 've had hdd failure twice already , i have a 300Gb Seagate IDE Drive running in a Nexstar enclosure powered by a power supply simular to of a laptop .	St
1.29.2	First time , .. now get this & quot ; a first 4 me & quot ; the hdd started vibrating like hell .	St
1.29.3	The following day i took the whole unit to the store where i originally bought it from , explained the matter and had it tested by the tech 's at the store .	St
1.29.4	they were blown away on the behaviour of the unit .	St
1.29.5	At first it was kinda funny cause , they 've never seen som'ing like this before , well i booked it for repair/replacement .	St
1.29.6	The sad thing is not the entire drive was backed up , and i lost data that took a year to create , and there was absolutely nothing to do cause it just would'nt start up on any machine .	St
1.29.7	The hdd was returned labeled & quot ; certified repaired & quot ; .	St
1.29.8	I started fresh again storing , storing and one day again after 2 weeks it just would'nt start up again , the enclosure led displayed a constant flashing but nothing .	St
1.29.9	I got it started a few times after windows updates after a heavy struggle at times yes , but even then it do n't last long cause , after some time it gets hot and then led flashes again and makes a strange pinging sound and then freezes up , thats it .	St
1.29.10	it wo n't start up after that again .	St
1.29.11	maybe the next day or so , if i 'm lucky .	St
1.29.12	I suspected the interface and/or component board on it to be faulty cause the content on the drive itself is not corrupted for the time that it works i can store data on it or copy , cut , whatever untill it malfunctions again , what do u make of this ? ? ?	Ques
1.29.13	I have had the drive installed in other units and pc 's as well , nothing .	St
1.29.14	Now the power supply is to hell and gone as well , not working anymore .	St
1.30.1	My Elements Western Digital 400Gb external drive expired after just 3 months .	St
1.30.2	The reason ?	Ques
1.30.3	Because I was not aware that it was necessary before closing the drive to use the 'Safely remove hardware ' icon in the system tray .	St
1.30.4	The instructions that came with the drive were minimal to say the least and even after searching their website I could n't find a reference to the need to take care when closing the drive .	St
1.30.5	As a consequence I lost about 100Gb of pictures .	St
1.30.6	BUT I had already saved all of them to CD-RW 's as well but that did n't cushion my annoyance .	St
1.30.7	I eventually found out about the SRH button in a French expats forum !	St
1.30.8	!	St
1.31.1	Let 's see - Personally , I 've had five external hard drives over the past ten years .	St
1.31.2	Only the first one , a 300 mb or so drive by a now out of business outfit named & quot ; Spirit & quot ; died on me - but that was after years of faithful service .	St
1.31.3	When it did finally die , it was in use as a backup startup drive .	St
1.31.4	Two of the others - a 1 GB Poweruser Pro and an 40GB APS Drive are n't used much since they 're on a backup machine and are connected via SCSI ( remember those ? ) .	Ques
1.31.5	The other two - an APS 120 GB ( for digital photos only ) and a LaCie d2 160 GB are working fine - the latter has been used for current projects on a daily basis for about three years with no problems .	St
1.31.6	I 've used both with USB ( on a old machines ) and Firewire ( on the current one ) with no problems .	St
1.31.7	In the workplace , I 've lost two over the same amount of time - one LaCie Porsche drive was dropped while running ( never a good thing ) and died , and an external APS drive that was used for photo storage and temporary backups .	St
1.31.8	The APS ran solidly every workday for five years before causing problems .	St
1.31.9	There was plenty of time to replace it , but the new boss could n't see why he should bother - and it died , taking the data with it , since he did n't see the wisdom of doing backups .	St
1.31.10	Overall , the Lacie d2 drives have done very well for me - there were three at my workplace ( although the oldest one developed formatting issues recently with the OS Upgrade ) and I am considering getting another one to replace the old APS drive , which is 60 % full now .	St
1.32.1	From the variety of reports I 've read here , up to this point , there is no clear make , model , size , system info , operating system , number of drives , and any other technical specifics related to the problems , which are the root causes of the external drive issues plaguing this poor user .	St
1.32.2	What matters most is the & quot ; architecture & quot ; of one 's PC .	St
1.32.3	That is to say , & quot ; placement & quot ; on any given surface ( placement of the drive horizontal , vertical , on a precarious perch ? ) .	St
1.32.4	Related and more important still is the relationship , by definition part of any good architecting , between the drive and the owner and/or the other equipment .	St
1.32.5	I warn here , too , that what is not being said is equally important as anything else related to an external drive .	St
1.32.6	It is not the brand names so much .	St
1.32.7	Hold that info aside for now .	St
1.32.8	Think on this : What are the equipment used for ?	Ques
1.32.9	How often ( there is a MTBF for all hardware ) ?	Ques
1.32.10	How long ?	Ques
1.32.11	What are the personal care-taking habits ( re their pc equipment ) of the respondent ?	Ques
1.32.12	These drives mentioned thus far , especially the newer ones , are all competent and reliable .	St
1.32.13	One can get a & quot ; lemon , & quot ; too , or drop a drive on one 's toe , or whatever , of course , shortening a drive 's MTBF .	St
1.32.14	In brief , its the way a modern hard drive ( external or internal ) is used and cared-for ( degragmented , tested , low-level operations ) .	St
1.32.15	In other words , the relationship between equipment and owner matter more than virtually all the other parameters : this is clear from this thread .	St
1.32.16	The thread , then , should move more in the direction of solution , not attribution .	St
1.32.17	As they said , a department mantra , in my old job , & quot ; Fix the problem , not the blame. & quot ; The problem is in the architecture encompassing the relationships between actors that matters .	St
1.32.18	Drives are commodities , like light bulbs .	St
1.32.19	They 're all basically the same .	St
1.32.20	Hence , their low prices , by the way .	St
1.32.21	Good luck .	Polite
1.33.1	I never had an external drive fail on me .	St
1.33.2	Point of Information Keep or Discard A drive that is part of a desktop architecture , a whole , a system , in a way is an & quot ; internal & quot ; drive or one could say an external drive in the classic sense is just another internal drive , albeit differently connected .	St
1.34.1	I had a 300 gb Seagate in an aluminum Coolmax .	St
1.34.2	At some point it got too hot ( which coolmax disputes ) and I had a head crash .	St
1.34.3	Never had a head crash before , but that was a god awful sound .	St
1.34.4	It was n't that I jostled it either .	St
1.34.5	I simply shot straight to hell .	St
1.34.6	Now I 've got the replacement in a transparent enclosure with a fan .	St
1.35.1	Mine failed .	St
1.35.2	A company referred by WD will try to extract data for no less than $ 100 , possible more than $ 500 .	St
1.35.3	I hate these drives .	St
1.35.4	Mine was only about 3 months old .	St
1.35.5	I 'm very mad .	St
1.35.6	I think the old tape drives are the best route or just installing another internal drive .	St
1.35.7	Externals are horrible in my opinion .	St
1.36.1	I 've been using External Drives for about 3 years and have had only 1 problem .	St
1.36.2	The cooling fan went bad and caused the drive to overheat .	St
1.36.3	Luckily the drive was'nt damaged .	St
1.36.4	I was able to replace the cooling fan myself with an aftermarket one .	St
1.36.5	I am currently using 4 external drives , # 1 WD I Book 500 Gig , ION Tri-Select 320 Gig , Fantom Drives 160 Gig and a PC Xgear Dual Enclosure using a Maxtor 120 Gig Drive .	St
1.36.6	I have had one problem with my WD I Book External where I could not shut down windows .	St
1.36.7	I had to disconnect the usb cable to correct this .	St
1.36.8	This drive starts up when I boot up and windows starts .	St
1.36.9	I like this feature as I save all my info to it without trying to figure where to save it to .	St
1.36.10	That 's all for me	St
1.37.1	I purchase a Maxtor One Touch 300GB external HD to BU my files .	St
1.37.2	It lasted 9 months ( 9 monthly backups ) and stopped working .	St
1.37.3	Called Maxtor only to be told that the warrentee was over and there was nothing they could do .	St
1.37.4	Lesson learned .	St
1.37.5	DO N'T BUT MAXTOR PRODUCTS .	St
1.37.6	George the Good	St
1.38.1	I have a Seagate external hard drive with BounceBack Pro software .	St
1.38.2	I have had it for over 4 years .	St
1.38.3	I turn it on to do a daily back up and then turn it off .	St
1.38.4	On maybe 2 hours per day .	St
1.38.5	The only problem I have had was trying to plug the power cord to the hard drive without looking at the pin alignment and breaking some of the pins .	St
1.38.6	My fault !	St
1.38.7	Seagate sent me one at no charge .	St
1.38.8	The drive was 3 years old at the time .	St
1.39.1	Knock on wood ; I have n't had any issues with my external hard drive since I was fortunate enough to come into having one .	St
1.39.2	I purchased a Seagate 300 gig internal hard drive about two years ago .	St
1.39.3	Less than two months later , it died .	St
1.39.4	I went through the rigamarole with the store from which I purchased the drive and eventually had to contact Seagate directly .	St
1.39.5	They sent me a box and some shipping labels to send my drive back to them , which I did .	St
1.39.6	A few weeks later , I was compensated with a 750 gig external hard drive ( worth about 3 times what I paid for the internal drive ) , which I 've used for backup purposes ever since .	St
1.39.7	I went out a few weeks later and bought the same internal hard drive I had sent back to them , and it has ( again , knock on wood ) worked ever since , too .	St
1.39.8	I perform regular backups of everything nowadays , as I lost quite a bit of music and a lot of digital pictures when the drive died in the first place .	St
1.39.9	Like I said , though , I 've not had any trouble with the external drive .	St
1.39.10	I 've got it partitioned into quite a few different sections ( with different filesystems ) and run regular back ups ( at least once a week , sometimes a lot more often ) .	St
1.40.1	Not because it 's old or damaged , but its because of the power supply .	St
1.40.2	My AC/DC converter is failing on me and it wo n't transmit power unless the connector is set in a particular way .	St
1.41.1	This forum seems to sum up my life recently .	St
1.41.2	I have a lot of external drives storing my online movie collection ... and have had a few failures .	St
1.41.3	It is hard to work out why they die ... they just stop .	St
1.41.4	Heat seems to be an issue ... particularly in the 750-1 TB drives .	St
1.41.5	I now run them on the little USB connected notebook coolers and the problems seem to have stopped .	St
1.41.6	A simple and cheap fix .	St
1.41.7	Keep backups .	St
1.41.8	All drives will die sooner or later ... .it is worth having a backup of important data stored on another drive stored somewhere else .	St
1.42.1	Yes it certainly has failed .	St
1.42.2	I bought a 500 gig Western Digital external drive for storage .	St
1.42.3	I had it about 4 months and it quit working .	St
1.42.4	The computer no longer sees the drive at all .	St
1.42.5	I read on the net that I should break open the case and install the drive as an internal drive in my computer but so far I have n't tried it .	St
1.42.6	The case looks like it would be very hard to open .	St
1.42.7	I just have n't had the courage to break it yet .	St
1.42.8	I have a Dell computer running Windows XP .	St
1.42.9	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.42.10	Thanks .	Polite
1.43.1	I had a Maxtor IDE Hard Drive inside of a Mad Dog Brand Hard Drive Enclosure .	St
1.43.2	After a while the enclosure gave the drive too much power and fried the motor controller , thereby rendering the drive and data useless .	St
1.43.3	Mad Dog makes good products , I just had bad luck .	St
1.43.4	Do not even try their tech support though , it is a joke .	St
1.43.5	They did not reply for a long time and were unhelpful when they did reply .	St
1.43.6	They only replyed to the first email .	St
1.44.1	I have a CompUsa 80gig external drive Model : CUHD80U2E-72 that is less than a year old .	St
1.44.2	I turn it on and nothing happens .	St
1.44.3	lt used to work .	St
1.44.4	I 've checked the cord and the two ends .	St
1.44.5	Is there anything else I can do ?	Ques
1.45.1	Yes , I 've had an external hard drive fail on me and I hope it never happens again ! !	St
1.45.2	It was a 250 GB Western Digital My Book external hard drive .	St
1.45.3	The drive would not power up on several different machines .	St
1.45.4	I 'd get three clicks then nothing .	St
1.45.5	After a lot of reading on the net and giving the drive and data up for gone I put the drive in the freezer .	St
1.45.6	Got back all my data and I 'm still using the drive .	St
1.45.7	I do n't trust it with anything important but I 'm still using it to store CD 's I 've ripped and files that I already have several other backups of .	St
1.46.1	We have 3 Simple Tech and 1 Westerne Disgital xternal HDs and none have failed us !	St
1.46.2	We religilously back up to the Simple Techs and have had them for at least 2 or 3 years and they & quot ; keep on ticking & quot ; ! !	St
1.46.3	Because of their reliability , we recommend them to folks who ask about external backups .	St
1.47.1	Maxtor is not the issue ; Maxtor is not the problem at its first principle or very root .	St
1.47.2	I feel for you .	St
1.47.3	Having an expensive ( Maxtor/Targus/Western Digital/La Cie ) drive die on you after only 9 months and only once/month use ( as you indicated ) sucks .	St
1.47.4	But all of the writers here have had this brand or that one fail on them .	St
1.47.5	Drives today are like cell phones or light bulbs .	St
1.47.6	If they break , it is cheaper to buy another one rather than to have it fixed .	St
1.47.7	Thus , hard drives are now , at least , a & quot ; commodity. & quot ; Commodities are , usually , interchangable with eachother .	St
1.47.8	What I mean to say is , at the recognized brand name , fairly expensive drive & quot ; level & quot ; of those drives mentioned here , there is remarkable similarity in parts and integrity .	St
1.47.9	Many drives use another , hidden manufacturer of their actual drive , then have their logo , etc. , silk-screened onto the drive and sell it as if it were made by them .	St
1.47.10	Not too many factories -- even in China -- have the wherewithal to build positive ( air ) pressure clean rooms , needed to ensure air does not contaiminate the room ( it only flows out ) and because , recall , a single speck of dust can ruin a drive/cpu/doped silicon-based device .	St
1.47.11	Look not at the brand of the drive , but at the relationship of the user and the equipment .	St
1.47.12	End users are capable of anything : the dumber the more likely .	St
1.47.13	I have said this before , but it applies to your griping ( no offense !	St
1.47.14	please !	St
1.47.15	nothing wrong with griping we all do it and you did get a bad deal with the Maxtor ) : the major proximate cause , a.k.a. , root cause , cause of all causes , when it comes to hard drives is its config and its use .	St
1.47.16	Please do complain , here and to Maxtor , but know that ( perhaps not in your case , but ... ) it is these parameters that cause drives to fail , not their brand .	St
1.47.17	They 're cheap , they 're manufactured by the same companies in the same factories , in large part .	St
1.47.18	As I said above , today 's state of the art hard drives of all brands are very reliable and very inexpensive .	St
1.47.19	So replace a drive do n't fix it ( have it fixed ) , i.e. , hard drives have become , like the $ 500 PC , a commodity .	St
1.48.1	Last year , due to corrupted MS Office applications , I was forced to reinstall windows and I opted for an external hard drive to backup my computer .	St
1.48.2	I read a lot of information from every source I could find and I opted for a Maxtor 180 GB external drive .	St
1.48.3	I was able to back up my computer files very easily .	St
1.48.4	Only took a few minutes of set up and a few minutes of back up .	St
1.48.5	I used the Symantic restore feature on my Dell 5100 computer , which , in less than 10 minutes , wiped my hard drive and re-installed windows and all factory applications to factory fresh .	St
1.48.6	After re-installing all my applications , I simply had to click and drag & quot ; My Documents & quot ; back to my desk top hard drive .	St
1.48.7	Now , 8 months later , no crashes , and my external hard drive backs up my documents every week .	St
1.49.1	Thanks for your feedback Montdor1 .	Polite
1.49.2	I started my career in systems with the first TRS and Apple back in the 80s .	St
1.49.3	Worked for AT & T 33 years as a systems manager in every capacity .	St
1.49.4	So I know how to handle HDs and all sensitive computer components .	St
1.49.5	The thing that bits me is Maxtors lack of response to a faulty product they sold .	St
1.49.6	I find it hard to walk away from a $ 200 hard drive that failed due to poor quality and not user neglect no matter who the manufacturer .	St
1.49.7	I have 4 machines in my home/lab and about 14 hard drives internal and external .	St
1.49.8	Never had a failure , but then I never had a Maxtor .	St
1.49.9	I do n't trust people who do n't complain because nothing said nothing gained .	St
1.49.10	So I repeat Maxtor Stinks .	St
1.50.1	I used a Fantom Drive 300 GB or so .	St
1.50.2	USB connectivity , and I think , no fans .	St
1.50.3	Just went belly up .	St
1.50.4	I was able to the information off the HD , so nothing lost but I remember having a history of USB External Drive problems .	St
1.50.5	Is it the USB connection somehow ?	Ques
1.50.6	Also , I have Carbonite back up and they do not back up external HD , so I got another internal for back up and storage .	St
1.50.7	Next time , I will look to the ones with fans .	St
1.50.8	Soon I will need another one , so thanks for the input .	St
1.51.1	& quot ; Do n't attempt to change people , change there situation & quot ; .	St
1.51.2	In many situations you engineer your way out of the problem .	St
1.51.3	The failures must be identified then re-engineered so that the & quot ; problem & quot ; goes away , the complaints .	St
1.51.4	This sounds like common sense , unfortunately it is not .	St
1.51.5	Nearly all & quot ; human & quot ; and hardware problems can be re-engineered to eliminate a problem .	St
1.51.6	If people unplug there external drives you make them very difficult to unplug .	St
1.51.7	If there moving them around while there running you attach them to the PC tower where they are less likely to move them .	St
1.51.8	If they over heat you add a better fan or other solution .	St
1.51.9	These are engineering problems .	St
1.51.10	It appears from this forum that 50 % or more of all external drives fail when they should not .	St
1.51.11	They are unreliable , only 15 & lt ; & gt ; - should fail during there life expectancy ( five years & lt ; + ) .	St
1.51.12	I know , & quot ; easier said then done & quot ; but that 's why the Engineers get the big bucks .	St
1.52.1	My External drive keeps switching on and off and failing and I have to switch it off and on again for it to work..	St
1.52.2	It works OK for a while but sometimes if I do n't open it , it starts to open by itself.. Other times it just switches off .	St
1.52.3	My Specs are : HP Pavillion t3729 Windows Home Premium 1G Ram Intel ( R ) Pentium ( R ) DCPU 2.80GHz NVIDIA GeForce 7500LE Ext Drive Iomega 320G Please help Thanks	St
1.53.1	I have no idea why7 .	St
1.53.2	Noone could chkdsk and defrag their disks more than I do .	St
1.53.3	They are also constantly monitored by HDD Life and Intel Desktop Utilities .	St
1.53.4	Suddeenly for no apparent reason it will not work .	St
1.53.5	I ca n't re-format it .	St
1.53.6	Chdsk says it 's repaired errors but generally if I connect it it just drags my whole system , into the mire .	St
1.53.7	Servers me right for for buying French !	St
1.54.1	I had a hard drive failure , but it was in a Toshiba laptop and I never did try to find the brand .	St
1.54.2	It 's a very sickening feeling when you hear ball bearings or something grinding away .	St
1.54.3	The technicians said they could n't retrieve any data .	St
1.54.4	I guess the drive was fully toasted .	St
1.55.1	when the drive was in my tower , i had no problems .	St
1.55.2	soon after using it as a back up external , I was getting disk errors , then after windows found too many errors , It quit forever , 4 yrs old .	St
1.55.3	I started having trouble witha second sixty gig , so I reformated , and fixed any errors .	St
1.55.4	I am VERY cautious not to turn the power on or off if the computer is reading or writing .	St
1.55.5	SOmetimes it is doing something that I didnt know .	St
1.55.6	And ____ & quot ; & quot ; Sorry $ //drive can not be found , your data may be lost , try to save file elsewhere & quot ; & quot ; 40 gigs worth of stuff , that scares the c___p out of a person. , I have a couple of concerns myself , , is there bad connections with the external drive components . ?	Ques
1.55.7	Greg	St
1.56.1	Once it stopped starting , it did n't start again .	St
1.56.2	I had no other problems with the drive .	St
1.57.1	use pc viagra .	St
1.58.1	I have two external hard drives , one being a LaCie Mobile Drive 100GB and the other a Seagate FreeAgent Desktop 500GB .	St
1.58.2	My older extHDD ( LaCie ) works like a clock and has always done , but my Seagate is being very annoying by stop responding at random times , with the transfer-light just flashing ...	St
1.58.3	Sometimes Windows stops responding altogether until I disconnect the drive , and then everything resumes again !	St
1.58.4	I used to be able to use it for Windows Vista 's backup system , but I have n't been able to do that for some time now .	St
1.58.5	I defragmented it some time ago and then it worked normally for a while , but then it messed up again , and now it does n't even help defragmenting it .	St
1.58.6	Perhaps it would help by reformatting the drive ... ?	Ques
1.58.7	I 'll try it as soon as I have access to a computer with a larger HDD than my laptop 's 100GB .	St
1.59.1	Dell Laptop D505	St
1.60.1	I have had several Lacie external drives fail , but it has always been the enclosures and not the drives themselves .	St
1.60.2	I have lost data , however , because some of the drives were RAID , and impossible to re-use without losing data .	St
1.61.1	All of the failures occured on separate hard drives .	St

1.65.1	Mine was virtually brand new when it died on month 7 back around '06/'07 .	St
1.65.2	I never bought another one until yesterday .	St
1.65.3	Bought it from a store that has a super liberal VERY user-friendly return policy .	St
1.65.4	I chose the store with care knowing that external hard drives have a sketchy history .	St
1.65.5	Why the poll ?	Ques
1.65.6	Is it because external hard drives are known to die far more often than a lot of other things out there ?	Ques
1.65.7	If you read the reviews at Newegg and Amazon external hard drives have a reputation , a bad reputation .	St
1.65.8	It 's not all bad .	St
1.65.9	But there are a lot of reviews where people state that their hard drive failed not all that long after they bought it .	St
1.65.10	I 'm one of 'em .	St
1.65.11	As are a great many others .	Polite
1.66.1	I have been using external hard drives for about 10 years and so far have had no failures , but then again I have had no failures on my internal hard drives either .	St
1.66.2	Just lucky I guess .	Polite
1.66.3	I am still using a 10 year old Maxtor 80GB drive and I dont believe it has a fan .	St
1.66.4	It has taken a lot of abuse but still keeps running .	St
1.66.5	I also have another Maxtor One Touch external drive that still seems to be working just fine .	St
1.66.6	My other two are in Venus D53 enclosures that do have fans , one has a Western Digital hard drive and the other has a Seagate hard drive .	St
1.66.7	With the exception of the Maxtor 80GB , these hard drives are rarely accessed and are used solely as backups of backups .	St
1.66.8	I have 3 internal hard drives where my regular backups take place .	St
