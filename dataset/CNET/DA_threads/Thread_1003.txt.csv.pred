1.1.1	I have a 250GB external hard drive which I use as backup and storage for the concerts I download with Bittorrent.	St
1.1.2	My drive is very quickly getting full, and I plan on upgrading to at least 750GB, but in the meantime, I'm trying to make some space for more shows.	St
1.1.3	I'm not very familiar with compressing files, so I'm wondering if it would be okay to zip these files to save space?	St
1.1.4	Is it a good idea?	St
1.1.5	Is there a better way to do this?	St
1.1.6	They're all FLAC or SHN files, so maintaining the quality is the most important factor.	St
1.1.7	Thanks in advance!	St
1.2.1	http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=44228 I used this: zip FLAC/SHN files in Google.	St
