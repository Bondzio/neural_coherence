1.1.1	My sister messed up her Bios out of ignorance, i thought, no problem, ill just take out the battery out of the motherboard for a few minutes and bios will reset settings, but it didn't.	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know an other way to reset bios settings?	St
1.1.3	PS: Why i can't change them back: the picture is al messed up and just has some weird lines on it.	St
1.2.1	What Operating system what type CPU, memory et al?	Ques
1.2.2	There should be a jumper on the mobo, located near that battery that is for the express purpose of resetting the BIOS to the default.	St
1.2.3	Move the jumper to the opposite position and turn off all power to the mobo [only sure way to remove the 5 volt standby power is to unplug the power supply, or turn it off by the switch on the rear]for a few minutes.	St
1.2.4	Then move the jumper back and turn the system on.	St
1.3.1	you removed the battery you may have inadvertantly removed some tension from the battery contact and now have a poor connection.	St
1.4.1	Check to be sure that you put the battery back in correctly.	St
1.4.2	Those button batteries need to go in with the positive + side up.	St
1.5.1	i don't understand why you should know more about the system, and i don't what it would help.	Sug
1.5.2	CPU:celeron 1ghz RAM:96mb video: on board motherboard: i dont know what kind this is but it has a phoenix bios i think i put the battery in right...i think but if you boot it up without battery it should just load default settings	St
1.6.1	BIOS without battery should be the default bios settings.	St
1.6.2	Your earlier post said that the display is just some lines.	St
1.6.3	Check the monitor on another PC to eliminate faulty monitor and try your pc with another monitor.	St
1.6.4	That should give you firm indications as to what is wrong.	St
1.6.5	Hope this helps.	St
1.7.1	The monitor has allways worked fine and the image is screwed up since she changed the settings	St
1.8.1	BIOS settings and the display settings in WINDOWS are not related.	St
1.8.2	I think you are going about this in an odd way.	St
1.8.3	The usual?	St
1.8.4	-&gt; Boot Windows to SAFE MODE, set the settings you want there, OK it and ask Windows to reboot.	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	The screen has weird lines on it at all times, even before windows is loaded, even in the bios.	St
1.10.1	ALL BIOS I've encountered in over 20 years sets the video to a safe 640x480 60Hz VGA display and before VGA, EGA, Mono would do the same.	St
1.10.2	You have a bum video card or display.	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	ok ill try it with different display, but i dont think it'll help.	Sug
1.11.2	She set something from 16 bits to none...she says	St
1.12.1	Those words are what I see when WINDOWS is running.	St
1.12.2	Bob	St
1.13.1	but don't think that zero would be a value.	St
1.13.2	Probably in the video settings not BIOS, but then again zero makes no sense, unless she changed the acceleration slider all the to the left.	St
1.13.3	Good luck solving this one Robert.	Polite
1.14.1	i found it very weird to, ill ask her again...	St
1.15.1	she did it from bios, im sure about that	St
1.16.1	NIL	St
1.17.1	NIL	St
1.18.1	OK but i can only update on saturday, when i see my sister.	St
1.19.1	jump back to the top of the first page from wherever it is when you make the post.	St
1.19.2	Hope that the answer lets you solve the problem.	St
1.20.1	Hi Tod, Just understand that the BIOS as factory set or Default HAS to work the monitor in the basic mode, i.e.	St
1.20.2	640 x 480 resolution.	St
1.20.3	If it does not, then how does one even attempt any change or configuration of the BIOS in the first place?	St
1.20.4	Plz confirm that you monitor / PC video card is OK as suggested in my earlier post.	St
1.20.5	Incidentally, does your monitor have any control or controls that adjust the display Width or Height?	Ques
1.20.6	If yes, then you could try adjusting these and see if the display becomes stable.	Sug
1.20.7	The same, if there is any control for H-Sync or V-Sync, which is not likely unless the monitor is an old version or of a special make.	St
1.20.8	All the Best	St
