I am switching from a PC to a MAC and am somewhat unfamiliar with the inner workings of MACs.
I am going to order an iMac G5 (2.0 Ghz) next week.
I intend on ordering 1Gig of RAM and was thinking of ordering a single one gig DIMM (so I could upgrade later without wasting memory).
But I have seen some comments posted around the web arguing that the imac may run faster with matching pairs (i.e.
2 512 MB memory sticks are better than one 1 Gb).
I was wondering what you guys, who are obviously more experienced with MACs that I, think.
Any thoughts.
Franklin
