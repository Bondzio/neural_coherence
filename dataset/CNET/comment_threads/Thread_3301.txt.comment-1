Running XP Home SP2.
Currently have an nVidia GeForce2 MX 64 Meg video card in the AGP slot.
Going to replace it with a GeForce FX5500 256MB DDR AGP card.
What's the best/correct process to replace it?
The nVidia drivers are listed in Add/Remove.
Can I swap the cards, power up and run the new drivers install CD?
Or should I uninstall the old ones first.
TLIA, Wayne
