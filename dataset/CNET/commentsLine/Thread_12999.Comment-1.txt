sorry in advance for the length... i couldn't really think of a good title to describe my problem, but that's as good as it could be, i guess.
anyway, i've been doing a great deal of work on the hardware for my computer this summer, but i've been as careful as i can be.
the problems started around when i added a modem and installed sp2 for winxp.
i turn the computer on, and at some point, it decides it doesn't want to work anymore.
then, it just freezes up, and i cannot do anything, except reset - which sometimes doesn't work until i disconnect the power, wait till it all drains out, then plug it back up and set to work.
it's not the hard drive, because i put in a brand-new hard drive, and besides; it even locks up in bios sometimes.
various things make me think it might be the power supply, but then again, i don't know - i still am learning about computer hardware.
specs --- psu: antec 300w mb: intel processor: intel p4 (i think), 1.8 ghz ram: kingston dimm (?)
256 mb [pci]audio: astron/ensoniq/audiopci (not sure - says all three) [agp]video: some sort of agp card with added s-video support (don't seem any names...) case: it says mb on the front.
hdd: western digital 200 gb dvd: lite-on dvd +/- rw cd: lg cd-rw i also added an extra fan.
--- any clue what could be up with this?
also, what's up with the 20 pin and 4 pin connectors that plug into the motherboard from the psu?
i've seen 20 pin connectors, as well as 24, but never 20 + 4 (two separate connections).
thanks, g'day.
