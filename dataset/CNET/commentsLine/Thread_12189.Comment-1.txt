win98se p3 800 mhz 256 ram ; mitsumi cr4804te cd/rw this has been a sturdy machine -- but a couple of lock ups and one blue screen happened.
could only restart each with the longheld press on the power button.
now i can not play or explore a cd, though the d drive is visible in my computer, and device manager sees no problem, functioning normally.
have already dealt the *.vxd's that can cause conflicts.
i searched for newer drivers but there is nothing newer than version 3.0d as far as i can tell.
what else can i check?
