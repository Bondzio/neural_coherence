But, the separate cases and PSUs seem to work out (much) more expensive, and the bundled Antecs at my local suppliers seem to come with the &quot;Earthwatts&quot; PSUs but the separate ones don't seem to be those ones.
I wanted to get the Earthwatts one, as I gather they are the energy efficient type.
I think I've pretty much decided what to get (although I'll probably change my mind again LOL) Thanks for the help.
