Ok so i tried a few times to repair the install and each time the machine would reboot itself, but on reboot setup would not re-launch.
Now, when i try to boot the machine i no longer get a NTLDR error, the system does a POST, gets to the line about verifying DMI pool data, and does nothing.
No errors, no activity, just a blinking cursor, keyboard is useless for anything other than ctrl+alt+del.... My question at this point is even if i reinstall, what happens when i install xp, and it reboots during the process and this happens again?
