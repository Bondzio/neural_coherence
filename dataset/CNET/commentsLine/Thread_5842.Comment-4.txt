ideally ur programs shud work with the new motherboard with xp detecting all the new hardware that is identified.
though it wud be nice if u had a fresh installation for ur new motherboard from scratch.
but if u cannot afford that u shud be able to wrk ur old xp installation with the new motherboard.
but there is no harm in backing up ur data.
