there are replacement coolers out there for some of the geforce cards.
my mind didn't think to look beyond the sources i use to solve this issue.
for the people i deal with will not part with the money for a tennmax cooler so i just use generic fans.
however i always get a ball bearing fan if i think the card/system will need to be used for more than a few months.
hint: exacto blade knives, tin snips, plastic nuts, bolts and even plastic cable ties all make for great source material and tools to fashion a new fan mount.
sometimes i have to take up space that blocks the adjacent pci slot, but what other choice do we have?
at least at this price... bob
