<s> Hello I want to buy a new computer and just have a limited budget. </s>
<s> So I thought about buying the new Intel E4700 with 2GB Ram and a HD3850 /256MB. </s>
<s> I just don't know if the E4700 is really fast enough to run Vista in an acceptable speed... </s>
<s> Please tell me your opinion. </s>
<s> Learn memory management and see what the benchmarks are for other operating systems- and by this I mean non-windows and non-mac. </s>
<s> Honestly, buy it and go for Linux/GNU or *BSD. </s>
<s> Can you actually afford it and will another processor do the same job? </s>
<s> All CPUs in the same family have the same cpuflags and will mxecute the same instruction set(s). </s>
<s> Internal speed is more important and if SMP isn't readily supported, you won't b e getting the performance you want. </s>
<s> Also, remember that 64bit systems cannot run certain applications nwithout a compatibility layer. </s>
<s> (This is an added comment to the above post.) </s>
<s> vista can run on single core PCs and the e4700 is as fast as an athlon x2 5000+. </s>
