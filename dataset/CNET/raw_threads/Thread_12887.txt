Thank you for this nice product. I also have, for use with this computer, an external CD-ROM drive Model ESW860, which also works really fine. However, I also have a great deal of archived teaching and consultancy material, which is quite valuable to me. This is stored on the old-type 3.5&quot; floppy disks. Do you have, please, or do you know where I may obtain, an external drive, compatible with my Acer Aspire, which would enable me to retrieve, use and store the material on these drives. I do still have an old desktop clunker computer, with a 3.5 inch built-in drive - but the thought of trying to use this is not very appealing and may not work well, anyway. I like my Acer Aspire a lot. It has proved to be a real work-horse for my professional work. I would love to be able to give it even more work to do, in my teaching and training domain. Much of the material comes from overseas, in developing and emerging economy countries, where I customarily work. it is irreplaceable and thus quite valuable to me. I am looking for something inexpensive but efficient (are not we all?). I am 75 years old, semi-retired, working on a budget and have just become a great-grandfather for the first time. Delightful, of course, but yet another mouth to feed, so to speak, which is why I still work. I can be reached, should you be so kind, at &lt;dcjones2@cox.net&gt;
