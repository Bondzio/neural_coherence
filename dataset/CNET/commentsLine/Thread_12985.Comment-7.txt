i believe that the hard drive will be around for a long time, easily 10 years, but i don't think it will be in its current physical configuration.
i think a direction it might go is a hard card, where there will be no rotating parts, at least not a rotating magnetic medium.
i think there is a possibility that the medium (which might not even be magnetic) will be stationary, and perhaps a laser will scan the surface to read/write the surface.
the beam of the laser will be electronically directed to the various areas and depths needed to access the medium areas.
that sort of scheme would eliminate the weakest link of today's hard drive method.
with no rotating parts, and with electronic means to not only direct the read/write mechanism but also to keep itself calibrated will possibly make this sort of drive &quot;bullet proof.&quot; just a possibility.
