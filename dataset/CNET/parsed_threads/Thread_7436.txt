<s> Hello again. </s>
<s> I have the 3C905C-TX-M Lan card but i can't find windows vista 32/64bit drivers over the internet. </s>
<s> If anybody has this card could you please tell me where can i download drivers for vista? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> http://support.3cbsi.com/infodeli/tools/nic/3c90x/ethercd/english/usrguid.pdf has the support numbers in the last chapters. </s>

<s> the 3c905c line went end of life back in 2002. you might find some generic drivers, but i recommend you get a new nic from dlink or netgear for $30 or less. </s>
