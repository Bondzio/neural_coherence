1.1.2	Having no experience with any of the chat platforms or PC video cameras, I am looking for suggestions on which is the best camera/chat combo to use with my daughter and granddaughter.	St

1.2.1	http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=7&threadID=234997&messageID=2410739&tag=mcnt#2410739 is your former question in one of our other forums.	St
1.2.2	That forum wasn't for posing a question as you may have found out.	St
1.2.3	Why not one of the packages you see everywhere?	St
1.2.4	As to &quot;Best&quot; I think those Macintoshes with the builtin camera to be &quot;best&quot; since you don't have to install the camera or software.	St
1.2.5	It just works.	St

1.3.1	Yes, I found I had posted in the wrong place, but could not see how to delete the first one.	St
1.3.2	I have used other Logitech devices and was satisfied.	St
1.3.3	Will the camera come with software so that if I bought two I could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo etc.?	St
1.3.4	If so, which one of those should I use?	St
1.4.1	Will the camera come with software so that if I bought two I could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo etc.?	St

1.4.4	I can't say why people choose one over the other.	St
