1.1.1	My name is Scott and I could use some help .	St
1.1.2	I am the IT Director for my company which is pretty small .	St
1.1.3	50 employees max .	Sug
1.1.4	We have two offices .	St
1.1.5	One in NJ ( HQ ) and one in NYC ( Sales Office ) .	St
1.1.6	Right now I am running a make shift & quot ; file server & quot ; on a higher end desktop with Windows Vista .	St
1.1.7	I was able to open up access to allow a single VPN connection to this machine .	St
1.1.8	( PPTP ) Just your basic garden variety simple VPN tunnel with basic authentication .	St
1.1.9	( I know not very secure ) .	St
1.1.10	I was able to do this on my own but I need some help with the next step .	St
1.1.11	Innate in this type of set-up , only one user can access the server from offsite at a time .	St
1.1.12	In the IMMEDIATE future , I need to have at least 3-5 concurrent users being able to pull files from this server .	St
1.1.13	Similarly , Ive designed a homegrown software package that will be housed on a separate application server .	St
1.1.14	We will eventually need a multi-user VPN connection to this server as well .	St
1.1.15	Last but not least , we have Sales and Merchandising personnel all over ; including ASIA , EUROPE and CANADA .	St
1.1.16	They will need access to these servers as well .	St
1.1.17	I need suggestions on what type of set-up is best suited for this business model and how do I go about getting started .	St
1.1.18	Unfortunately , as the economy is in shambles , I dont have a large budget .	St
1.1.19	Here is some basic info for both offices .	St
1.1.20	End-user base is comprised of a mixture of Mac and PC users , but mostly PC users .	St
1.1.21	CH ( HQ ) ISP : Comcast .	St
1.1.22	Bandwidth : cable ( not exactly sure of the Mbps ) Hardware : SMC Model 8014 NYC ( Sales ) ISP : Verizon Bandwidth : ADSL ( not exactly sure of the Mbps ) Hardware : Westell Model A90 I 'm only looking at a few hundred dollars in my budget .	St
1.1.23	The powers-that-be are from a different school of thought when it comes to technology and business .	St
1.1.24	They want it to work for the cheapest possible price .	St
1.1.25	Any suggestions .	St
1.1.26	Right now we have one Public IP pointing to the one server internally .	St
1.1.27	Is there a way for me to set up multiple users to access the same server using the one public ?	Ques
1.1.28	or will I need to orders separate public IPs for each user .	St
1.1.29	My total knowledge of networking is limited to the basic and this is the first time I 've ever done something like this .	St
1.2.1	Hi Scott , The easiest solution would be to install a VPN/Firewall at the NJ site and allow users to VPN in .	St
1.2.2	The VPN/Firewall would serve as the VPN termination and once the clients sucessfully authenticate to it , have them get the files from the Vista PC .	St
1.2.3	( server ) Vista Business and Ultimate can handle 10 concurrent connections so you 're okay there at least for now .	St
1.2.4	I understand price is an issue as we 're all hurting .	St
1.2.5	If you can swing it , my preferance would be to use a SonicWall firewall as they can be easily set up and running with IPSec VPN access in no time .	St
1.2.6	SonicWall has their own VPN client software so all you need is a downloaded VPN policy file from the firewall , import it and you 're done !	St
1.2.7	Second choice would be the ProGear series VPN/firewall from Netgear .	St
1.2.8	They are cheaper , but not a solid as SonicWall .	St
1.2.9	I 've had a Netgear VPN/firewall literally take a dive already .	St
1.2.10	If I use SonicWall as an example , the TZ190 can handle site-to-site VPN 's as well as client-to-site VPN 's .	St
1.2.11	Buy additional client VPN licenses as you go .	St
1.2.12	And in either case , ( SonicWall or Netgear ) you 'll really only need 1 public IP .	St
1.2.13	Hope that helps ...	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bkirby .	St
1.3.2	I appreciate the response .	Polite
1.3.3	You 've given me quite a bit of really great information and products to research .	St
1.3.4	I have some homework to do ! ! !	St
1.3.5	Thanks again buddy .	St
