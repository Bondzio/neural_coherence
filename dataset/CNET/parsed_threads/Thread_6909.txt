<s> Hi, I was wondering what motherboards might support Crucial's 2GB kit(1GBx2) DDR2 PC2-8500 Ballistix Tracer 240-pin. </s>
<s> I am looking to buy this memory and also a motherboard, but I do not know what motherboard supports it. </s>
<s> What you want to do is search the mobo sites and find out what the mother board supports. </s>
<s> I dont want to sound lazy or anything, but wuold you might have heard of one. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> have official (you can call tech support) support. </s>
<s> mobos with the intel p35 chipset aren't readily available in the retail channel yet though. </s>
<s> many p965 and 650i/680i motherboard can support ddr2-1066 via the overclocking/tweaking options in their bios. </s>
<s> unless you plan to seriously OC (and have the necessary patience), a good ddr2-800 kit can perform equally well as the crucial kit. </s>

<s> The memory I was looking at had a $75 mail-in rebate. </s>
<s> It made the memory $135, a deal I could not pass up! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> If one uses the search tool at NewEgg.com, that is currently the only motherboard listed as supporting DDR2 1066. </s>
<s> The trick is that many other motherboards with nVidia 680i and 650i chipsets can be overclocked to support those faster RAM speeds. </s>
<s> EVGA 122-CK-NF63-TR LGA 775 NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI ATX Intel Motherboard I think it will work </s>
<s> See if you can Google that model for performance issues and quirks (if any). </s>
<s> NewEgg.com customer reviews: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=N82E16813188011 (At least one reviewer installed DDR1066 RAM. </s>
<s> Mixed results.) </s>
