i'm trying to setup a wd my book live in a small office and am having a bit of trouble.
i can access the drive from any computers on the network by mapping the drive via ip address, but i'd like the computers to recognize it automatically.
i think the problem is our overall network setup.
we have an at&amp;t modem that connects to a netgear router and a netgear switcher.
when i plug the drive into the router, all the computers that are connected wirelessly see the drive automatically as another computer on the network but the computers connected via ethernet to the switcher don't see it.
when i plug the drive into the modem, all of the computers can access it from its ip address, but none sees it automatically.
is that just how this stuff works or is there something i can do so that all of our computers see it automatically?
