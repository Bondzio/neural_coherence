i have the dl-524 and the firmware (the software that it runs internally) was updated just weeks ago.
there is little to no chance yours has the latest version from dlink.com -&gt; and yes, it works better now.
it used to require a power cycle randomly from 5 days to 3 weeks.
i was about to get an ups to see if it was some power issue, but the new firmware since it was installed has made this box more of an appliance rather than something i have to check if there is a network glitch.
