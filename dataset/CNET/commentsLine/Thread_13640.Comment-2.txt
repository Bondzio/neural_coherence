i would go to the store or web site of the software you have listed and see what they recommend.
then use that info as guide for putting together the computer.
make sure the computer's power supply will work in uruguay.
you may need to pick up a power filter system just to get it to work in uruguay.
make sure you can get updates where you live in uruguay.
i bought software that would not work out of the box without being updated.
some computer parts stores will do cod (cash on delivery).
perhaps you can setup an account before you go back.
self build is best if you have the know how but built to order is allot easier.
as to the price list in your post i can not say good or bad.
in the computer world of pricing a price quote is like a letter written on the sand of the waters edge while the tide is coming in.
price the parts out at a site like newegg or tigerdirect.
then try to beat it at dell, or hp built to order site.
watch out for the shipping charges.
