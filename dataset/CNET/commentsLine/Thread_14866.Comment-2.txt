...the same.
same ide / power plug etc., but check your bios and manual first to make sure it has an &quot;auto-detect&quot; hard drive option.
if it can &quot;auto-detect&quot;, it'll almost certainly be able to use any laptop drive, as these are standard across all makes and models.
seagate's momentus (one with perpendicular storage) would be a good upgrade.
these offer better speeds, quicker accesses, lower votage use, and produce less heat than usual (but cost more!).
it might inject a bit of extra life into your laptop.
