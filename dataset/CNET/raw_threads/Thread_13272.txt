6515	0	171331	1893093	NR	Cycleman	4/22/06 5:11 PM	1.14572586E12	External drive no longer is recognized	Running XP, Pavilion 9870, 784 Mb RAM, with an ACOM Data USB 2.0 external hard drive (120 Gb). The external drive is used for picture storage. Mostly jpg, tif, mp3, wmv. I gave it a name (External Drive). Typically, I leave the computer on much of the time. I've had to re-boot the main computer every now and then. I noticed that the external drive doesn't show its name anymore (it's just Local K:), and it will not write data. I tried to open the drive, and it says it is not accessible. I tried to do a disk clean, and it also gives this same message. It seems to be scanning when I click on it, but when I try to open it by double clicking on it, the pilot light flickers, then a window pops up that says &quot;K is not accessible. A file or directory is corrupted or unreadable.&quot; Please advise. Al

This was able to recover most of the data on the external drive. Best 80 bucks I ever spent! And, now, it's time to drop a hammer on this drive, and rid myself of it, once and for all..... Al
