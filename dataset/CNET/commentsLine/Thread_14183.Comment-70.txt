i had a cs100 course in 1968. we had no displays, but punch-cards.
we made holes in the cards to represent code.
the memory (ram) of the system was 64 kbytes.
the first pc i used in 1983 was a portable osborne computer in the shape of a suitcase when packed.
the operating system was cp/m and the memory was (again) 64 kbytes.
it had a 6&quot; green on black display with two 5.25&quot; diskette drives and no hard disk.
as everyone might know, the 5.25 diskettes had capacities of 460 kbytes.
one of the drives was used for the software and the other for data.
i used &quot;supercalc&quot; to calculate the 20-year projection of a 600-bed luxury hotel (sheraton) in ankara.
when i started work in 1985 on the turkish encyclopedia britannica, our software manager came to me and asked that we should raise the capacity of our hard disk that was 5 mbytes to 20 mbytes because our relational database of encyclopedia headings was reaching 100,000. i bought one for 5,000 dollars paying cash!
now i am writing this message on a lap-top with a centrino processor at 1.4 ghz and using a 60 gbyte hard disk with a 256 mbytes ram.
next year, my relation with computers shall be 40 years old.
kind regards, vedat cakmak, istanbul
