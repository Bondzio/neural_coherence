<s> If I have a 600 watt power supply, and I my computer is using 450/600, is my computer really consuming 450 watts of electricity? </s>
<s> If it does, what kind of energy bill am I looking at? </s>
<s> Take the the watts your computer is using then divide that number by 1000. </s>
<s> This will give you KW (Kilowatts). </s>
<s> Multiply the KW by your current electrical charge. </s>
<s> This should be on your electric bill and is read in cents per kWh (Kilowatt Hour). </s>
<s> That will give you the cost per hour of running your computer. </s>
<s> Example of your computer running at 450 watts: 450 watts / 1000 = .45 .45 x $.065 (charge per kWh) = $.03 per hour of use </s>
<s> the efficiency of the power supply. </s>
<s> These switching types are rather efficient [compared to the old series regulators]. </s>
<s> They will run from 60 To 70 percent efficiency. </s>
<s> It varies with with percentage of the design output load is actually being drawn. </s>
<s> Let's use 65 % for a calculation. </s>
<s> Let's assume that the computer components are actually consuming 400 watts. </s>
<s> Thus at 65 % eficiency the input power being consumed by the power supply is 400 divided by 0.65 = just over 615 Watts. </s>
<s> Now the cheapie supplies have no power factor correction so you get to cheat the power supply. </s>
<s> They pump the volt amps, you only pay for the Watts. </s>
<s> With a 0.8 power factor you may only pay for 616 Watts but they generate 768 volt-amps. </s>
<s> Believe it or not, during the part of the cycle where the voltage is positive and the current is negative you are pumping power back to them. </s>
<s> That's why the power companies love it when you buy a power supply with Power factor correction and get the PF over 0.9. </s>
<s> Just so that you know, giving you an exact answer is not simple. </s>
