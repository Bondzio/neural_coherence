<s> Hi, Don't know where to ask this. </s>
<s> I know nothing about Tablets, Ipads, etc. </s>
<s> Is everything called a tablet that's not a netbook? </s>
<s> We just bought a T-Mobile Hotspot so my husband can get internet at his mom's house. </s>
<s> So now I'm interested in getting somthing smaller than the laptop for in the car, etc. </s>
<s> since we can connect anywhere. </s>
<s> So I don't need a device w/ connection or subscription plan, etc. </s>
<s> I know nothing. </s>
<s> What do I look for? </s>
<s> Is there a basic ipad that doesn't directly connect but just uses my connection? </s>
<s> Or should I just get a netbook? </s>
<s> Do you need to run Windows and it's Apps? </s>
<s> Many run out and get some pad then try to install Microsoft Word. </s>
<s> That's always a shocker to some. </s>

<s> We'll still bring our laptops for word, excel & programs. </s>
<s> Do they all open pdf files? </s>
<s> Maybe Netflix? </s>
<s> I have no idea what I will do w/ one. </s>
<s> I want to use it like a glorified gps. </s>
<s> Look up store locations that my gps doesn't have current. </s>
<s> I guess just internet, email, and ? </s>
<s> I just read some articles at Best Buy but they were too general for novices. </s>
<s> I'm pretty tech savy but not up w/ all the latest technology. </s>
<s> Never thought I wanted one but now that we have the hotspot everything is wide open. </s>
<s> I don't even have a cell phone. </s>
<s> My husband has a cheap net10 prepaid cell phone. </s>
<s> Like I said, I know nothing about this. </s>
<s> And fewer still have GPS. </s>
<s> At the 199 price point you will find the Blackberry Playbook (very nice and may have a choice of Android now or soon.) </s>
<s> There's the Kindle Fire and a lot of choices at this price. </s>

<s> I just want to look up on the internet for locations to plug into my garmin. </s>
<s> Like today I was out of town and wanted to find a dog park. </s>
<s> But gps isn't that detailed and up to date. </s>
<s> I don't have a budget. </s>
<s> I'm learning toward the iPad2 wifi only. </s>
<s> I suppose it does the most and has to most accessories? </s>
<s> Why would I want 32 or 64gb? </s>
<s> Is iPad the best? </s>
<s> Are the others comparitable? </s>
<s> If I just go w/ the iPad can I ignore the rest? </s>
<s> The bigger size is for folk that want to carry 32 or more GB of audio or other files. </s>
<s> My tablets get from 8 to 32 GB memory (I'm working with a company on Android apps.) </s>
<s> And that's been plenty for us. </s>
<s> The iPad 2 has very nice accessories too. </s>
<s> Nice unit and what most other tablets want to be compared to. </s>
