tnx for the suggestion.
actually a person on a dell forum mentioned; The Dell Optiplex 745s, 270s, 280s and others from that same time period have this problem.
www.ccl-la.com/.../dell-optiplex-gx620-motherboard-repair So I'm going to assume that is the problem as i have had similar issues with a past dell model and capacitors.
These are a bit bulged.
