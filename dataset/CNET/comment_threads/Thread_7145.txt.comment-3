Thanks for responding!
I was hoping it wasn't the COD.
But some people on that site I mentioned described having clicking problems with the Zip CD 650 that preceded its death, so I was concerned.
Not sure exactly when these CD-RWs were released.
I think it was 2000 or 2001.
The little bugger is sitting there clicking at me as I type.
*sigh*
