You did not say how your monitor worked b4 the new card. If you swap parts to isolate the problem you can often narrow down the problem area to find a solution. If the same prob shows on another monitor that would indicate not a monitor specific prob. The same for video card, cables and drivers.

If the problem persists, then use that warranty NOW! Of course try to adjust the monitor for best results, otherwise you have a bad monitor, maybe caused by shipping, etc. Cjeck also for any bent, pushed, otherwise odd looking pins on all the VGA cable(s). good luck -----Willy

What size monitor is it? Is the video cable built-in or does it plug into the monitor? When I got this 19 inch monitor I found that text was kind of blurry. There was a sort of ghost effect. This may be similar to what you've been seeing. I can't tell. The cable on this monitor is not built-in and the cable I was using was pretty lightweight and not well shielded. When I replaced it with a &quot;heavy duty&quot;, shielded, video cable, the problem cleared right up. If your problem started when you changed video cards, maybe the signal on the new video card isn't quite as strong as the old card or something, so you need a better cable. If your video cable plugs into your monitor, you might try a new, &quot;heavy duty&quot; and shielded, video cable. Especially if you have a large monitor, since they apparently require a better video signal. Cables like this can be had fairly cheap. I got this one on eBay for around $12 as I recall. James
