i just bought a maxtor basics personal storage 3200 (100 gb/7200 rpm).
so i just plugged it in and managed to get about 7 gb of files transfered.
then it went retarded and my comp wouldn't recognize the drive in explorer (there was no icon for an &quot;f drive&quot;).
well, it's recognized in disk mgmt, and i can now create a partition and format the x drive, it says with a max of 93 gb.
question: if i partition and format now, will i lose that 7 gb of files i transfered earlier?
in case it matters, i have windows xp and sp2 upgraded.
