1.1.1	My dog chewed threw the cable to my wireless adapter for my keyboard and mouse .	St
1.1.2	Is there a way replace the adapter so that I can keep using the same keyboard and mouse ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Without make , model and such I ca n't guess this one .	St
1.3.1	Unlikely you will get the just the adapter but they may be sold .	St
1.3.2	If it is just the cable and not the unit on the end of the cable you should be able to buy any cheap USB cable and splice it .	St
1.3.3	The wire colors in these seem to be pretty standard so you should be able to match them up .	St
1.3.4	Soldered would be best but I am sure you can twist the wires together and tape them and they will work .	St
1.4.1	I tried that , do you have any idea how small the actual wires are inside a usb cable ?	Ques
1.5.1	http : //www.usb.org/developers/docs/hs_usb_pdg_r1_0.pdf on page 13 note a smallest size of 28 gauge .	St
1.6.1	Now that I know the exact size of the wire , a simple google search yielded many places to get one for wire that small .	St
1.6.2	Now for the real interesting part , splicing them together !	St
1.6.3	Wish me luck , I 've never sliced wires this small .	St
1.7.1	http : //www.teamnovak.com/tech_info/how_to/solder/index.html PICTURES !	St
1.8.1	I did n't do it , a guy at work did it , works just fine .	St
