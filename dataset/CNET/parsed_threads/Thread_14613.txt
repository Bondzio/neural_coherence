<s> So I went in today to verify what I was going to do for the computer I am getting from HP. </s>
<s> I discovered that they took the instant savings off of the monitor. </s>
<s> But, I also found that they are giving really good savings on DVD burners. </s>
<s> To upgrade from a CD to a DVD burner is free. </s>
<s> To upgrade to Lightscribe it is only $10 more. </s>
<s> So, I figured I might as well add that to my system. </s>
<s> My questions: 1). </s>
<s> I understand that the burner can also burn CDs, is this correct? </s>
<s> 2). </s>
<s> If it can burn CDs, is the speed much slower than just a CD burner. </s>
<s> 3). </s>
<s> Do you need to use special CDs in this burner, or will it accept any CD? </s>
<s> 4). </s>
<s> Does it require a special CD or DVD to burn the image onto? </s>
<s> I just wanted to make sure before I purchased it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The Lightscribe burner is just like any other CD/DVD burner, except that it is equipped with a secondary laser that will print images into the top coatingon special DVD/CD media. </s>
<s> This makes it possible to produce your own CD's with images on them, instead of needing to write on the media with a marker. </s>
<s> I have a lightscribe burner and I really like it. </s>
<s> All the newer DVD burners will burn CD's, DVD's etc. </s>
<s> The prices now are very cheap compared to when I got mine. </s>
<s> The prices on lightscribe disks are more, but now they are becoming much cheaper also. </s>
<s> I just bought a 20 pack of Verbatim 16X for $9.99. </s>
<s> I buy all my blanks in spindles, it is much cheaper. </s>
<s> I buy my cases in packs of 100 for $13. </s>
<s> I really like to do custom labels with the lightscribe for some of my disks, but it takes much more time to scribe the disk then to burn it. </s>
<s> I would recommend a 16X +R, -R burner that will do dual layer at 8X. </s>
<s> I also have used all brands of blanks and have never had a coaster using Verbatim blanks. </s>
<s> You should try to read burner reviews before purchasing. </s>
<s> One of the better review sites is http://www.cdrinfo.com/ . </s>
<s> Have fun! </s>
<s> Here are the details that you need. </s>
<s> 1: DVD burners also burn CD's. </s>
<s> 2: Your CD will burn at standard CD Burner speeds. </s>
<s> You will get slower speeds when buring DVD's. </s>
<s> but be aware that with advances those speeds are pretty fast as well. </s>
<s> 3: The burner will burn to DVD+R/RW DVD-R/RW DVDR DL -- If the drive is listed as Dual layer (8.5gb) DVD-RAM CD-R/RW 4: The Burner will burn data to all media types listed above. </s>
<s> In order to burn images using lightscribe you will have to purchase lightScribe Enabled Disks. </s>
<s> These disks have a special top coating that reacts to an additional laser in the burner. </s>
<s> In order to use the lightscribe disk you have to use the supplied software to design labels. </s>
<s> There are commercial products out there as well that support this. </s>
<s> You then have to flip the disk upside down in the lightscribe burner. </s>
<s> The disk will burn as if you are adding data, but all it is doing is reacting to the laser. </s>
<s> A single decent detail image will take about 30 minutes to scribe, it has been my experience that if you want a nice contrast image you have to perform the scribe at least 2 times. </s>
<s> Lightsribe disks are a few cents more then standard blanks, but when you add up the cost of paper labels, and the fact that paper labels will start to peel, resulting in a new disk is needed. </s>
<s> You will save money in the long term, and have a disk that you would show off. </s>
<s> Are there special DVD blanks that can be used with this system? </s>
<s> As I understand the literature, no paper or plastic labeling can be used on DVDs as it can harm the player </s>
<s> Is this technology available for computers other than HP? </s>
<s> I've only seen ads for HP and this product. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I bought CD lighscripe in feb and have used it. </s>
<s> Just love it the imiges that come out on the cd are great. </s>
<s> when you do pictures to dc then put one of the imiges wiht the litescribe it looks professional. </s>
<s> EVA </s>
<s> The HP units can be put in any computer. </s>
<s> Maxell also has drives with lightscribe. </s>
<s> A couple of warnings about HP drives: 1.) </s>
<s> You must install the software BEFORE the hardware. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> HP uses BACK WEB for updates. </s>
<s> Thanks for the post. </s>
<s> I think that I'll wait a bit and buy a new laptop w/lightscribe installed. </s>
<s> No rush to replace my current machine. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I am considering getting a Mac for the first time. </s>
<s> Can the Superdrive in a Mac write images onto a CD? </s>
<s> Apple would have to licence the technology from HP if they wanted to add that feature to their drives. </s>
