1.1.1	Hey people First of all apologies if this is in the wrong section, I was a little confused to where to create a ew topic and thought this would be the best place but mods please remove if you feel necessary.	St
1.1.2	I was hoping someone could offer me a little support regarding trying to add my new tv/monitor as my secondary monitor to my pc, ideally what I want is when you add a second monitor to your laptop as an extended monitor that is what I require.	St
1.1.3	Is this possible?	St
1.1.4	If so how?	St
1.1.5	Would I need to purchase an additional graphioc card for my pc?	St
1.1.6	Could you recommend me one?	Sug
1.1.7	Or could I purchase something like a vga splitter which I would plug in the back of my vga slot and it would have two female vga connections?	St
1.1.8	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	But without a make or model that's as far as I can go.	St
1.2.2	All the office and home laptops do this.	St
1.3.1	I'm thinking of investing in a hdmi pci card as my tv/monitor has a hd connection.	St
1.3.2	So all I need to do is add this pci card to my motherboard and then buy a hdmi cable?	St
1.3.3	and connect the cable from the pc to the tv?	St
1.3.4	the only query I have regarding this is that would my pc sound also come out of my tv?	St
1.3.5	That is ideal for me.	St
1.3.6	I know I could have gone down the easy route of getting a vga connection for my pc but the hdmi graphics will be better and I might get sound.	St
1.4.1	No laptops today have PCI connections.	St
1.4.2	Also, any USB Video is far too slow to play video such as DVD or games.	St
1.4.3	But about HDMI.	St
1.4.4	A few of the newer laptops in the office have HDMI and those can ship sound over HDMI.	St
1.4.5	But again I can't see a make and model so the discussion runs flat.	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Sorry but this is not a laptop, im talking about my custom built dektop pc.	St
1.6.1	Looking over PCI cards I didn't find any I could find assurance that audio would go over HDMI.	St
1.6.2	Would running audio the old fashioned way be so bad?	St
1.7.1	Are you saying you don't have 2 vga/dvi outputs on your graphics card?	St
1.7.2	If not I would have thought it would be better to have 2 as I don't think you can split 1 output.	St
1.7.3	Bear in mind though that when you have dual-screens (extended desktop) it can have a performance impact on games i.e.	St
1.7.4	tearing on screen etc.	St
1.7.5	So you're better off turning the extended desktop off if you play games.	St
1.8.1	I saw this at Fry's on today paper.	St
1.8.2	It's call &quot;vga video splitter&quot; with 4 ports up to 1920x1440 resolution and it's made by IOGear.	St
1.8.3	$45 with $10 instant saving.	St
1.8.4	I did see another devices for such purpose but I forgot the name or where I have seen it.	St
1.8.5	So it's out there.	Polite
1.8.6	This one could be use as clone or display extension.	St
