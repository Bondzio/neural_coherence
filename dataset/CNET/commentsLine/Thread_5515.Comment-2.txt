generally speaking you can't change a partition if it's the one you're booting from.
if i needed to do it right now....i'd use acronis disk director.
you usually get the sw, load the program and create a bootable cd that allows you to modify the primary bootable partition and the other partitions, if any.
question is....why do you want to do this ?
before going further....have you backed up your data ?
