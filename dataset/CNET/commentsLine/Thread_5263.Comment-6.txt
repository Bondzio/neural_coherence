the ram is 2 x 512mb.
i've gone straight for swaping the slots and being as sure as i can be that they are seated properly.
i'll leave it a couple of days to see if the problem manifests itself again.
i've also obtained the memtest86 boot floppy you suggest in case i need it.
i'll use it anyway to see what it does.
thanks for your advice, and i'll let you know if it works.
