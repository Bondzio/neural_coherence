Hello all I have a Snow Leopard iMac with Virtualbox installed.
On my Virtualbox i am running windows 7.
My job has two different networks.
I need my Mac on Network 1 and I need to have my windows 7 in Virtualbox on network 2.
If i install a USB Ethernet port on the iMac and plug network 2 into it, how can i make it work just for Virtualbox?
I then want to make the built in Ethernet port work on network one and be just for the iMac?
Can it be done or am i just crazy?
Thank you
