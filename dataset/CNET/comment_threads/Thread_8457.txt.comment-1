I have a radeon HD 4850 and I thought I'd replace the fan on my card to cool it better today.
So I bought a fan and was going to install it.
I took out my card (with a little difficulty...just tinkered with it a bit but ended up getting it out seemingly fine).
I took off the fan, and decided instead to do it later.
So I put the old fan back on the card, put the card back into my pc and now I can't see anything on my monitor.
I think I put everything in properly, and made sure there wasn't excess dust or anything.
What could possibly be wrong?
