It almost sounds like the print head is jammed or something. My i9900 makes that noise if I let it sit for a few days without printing anything. I've always assumed it's just cleaning the nozzle, and the first time it happened I was a little surprised. It's my first Canon printer, and none of my other printers ever made a noise like that. I have had it for a little over a year now, and it prints reliably, but I just want to know what that sound is. Thanks : )

This makes some noise, but it should be no louder than when actually printing. I once had an HP printer that made a terrible chattering sound when printing, almost like gears grinding on one another! Turned out that round shiny rail that the printhead assembly moves back and forth across the paper was dirty (and sticky). I cleaned it with a soft dry cloth and all was as quiet as a mouse! Try it on yours - but don't use a lubricant of any kind, the rail is supposed to be dry and clean!

EXCEPT, where before it made the noise when it started up, now it makes the same noise on shutdown! At least it's briefer now. But it's not something we can ignore. This kind of noise really isn't acceptable from any manufacturer, and the fact that so many people are experiencing it is pretty damning. I definitely won't be replacing this beast with another Canon.

If you heard it... you'd known immediately it has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;normal head cleaning&quot; or &quot;a dirty rod&quot; or &quot;a paper issue&quot;. This is VERY loud... sounds like 2 large plastic gears violently grinding against each other. Not sure how that can happen for more than a few times without totally destroying the printer. My printer has been doing it since the day I bought it, 4 years ago. I've taken the printer apart many times, trying to locate the noise... but nothing looks like it's having a problem. The noise must be coming from something inside deeper than a partial disassemble would reveal. Needless to say, I'll never buy anything with the word &quot;Canon&quot; on it again.

I see working ones on ebay for about 20 bucks if you want to salvage one and use up your ink supply. At least you have a few more names to get burned up about. Buying a printer every few years seems to be how it goes now. So if you can eek out that many years on a printer you have a life time of printer makers to use and when it fails, write this every 8 years or so. Bob
