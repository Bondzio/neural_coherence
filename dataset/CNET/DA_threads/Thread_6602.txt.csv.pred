1.1.1	From what I've looked at so far, I don't see much benefit to these tablet devices (iPad, Xoom, etc.)	St
1.1.2	The cheapest iPad costs more than a budget laptop while the most expensive models, along with the Xoom cost almost as much as a very nice laptop.	St
1.1.3	To give examples, a white MacBook costs about $999 and a Dell Inspiron 15R: http://dell.to/hAKxAT costs about $800.	St
1.1.4	Either of these laptops seem like they can do infinitely more than an iPad, Xoom or anything else and are still fairly portable.	St
1.1.5	Additionally, for all of the functions that a normal computer cannot meet, it seems like a smartphone does a remarkable job (mobile email in your pocket, GPS capability, etc.)	St
1.1.6	However, I don't want to completely dismiss them as useless, so I am starting this thread.	St
1.1.7	For this thread please post the things that a tablet can do better (or do exclusively) than a: smartphone netbook laptop (I am leaving the desktop out because the desktop is not a mobile device) Also, post the things that a tablet cannot do (or does significantly worse) than the following devices: smartphone netbook laptop I'll go first.	St
1.1.8	Tablet Pros: Smartphone vs: similar applications but a much bigger screen, making on screen keyboards easier to use (as well as making some casual games more fun).	St
1.1.9	Also better for watching videos and looking at pictures.	St
1.1.10	It doesn't seem like the battery life for a smartphone is as good as a tablet.	St
1.1.11	Netbook vs.: very few have built-in GPS capability.	St
1.1.12	Not as portable as a tablet device, not many have touch screens and the ones that do often aren't as high of quality.	St
1.1.13	A touchscreen on a netbook is more cumbersome to use.	St
1.1.14	It probably doesn't have as good of a battery as a tablet.	St
1.1.15	Laptop vs.: no built-in GPS device, lacks &quot;easy to use&quot; programs like Google Maps (would have to use a browser based version instead).	St
1.1.16	Unless you have a higher end laptop, the battery life on a tablet is assuredly better.	St
1.1.17	Tablet Cons: Smartphone vs: Many smartphones perform the same functions that a tablet does, except they are small enough to fit in your pocket, can make phone calls, go into GPS car docks, etc.	St
1.1.18	Netbook vs.: Incredibly cheaper than a tablet.	St
1.1.19	Has productivity programs like LibreOffice, OpenOffice and Micrsoft Office easily available (one example of how you can do actual work on one).	St
1.1.20	Can run most of the programs you would run on a laptop, but the screen is awful tiny for general computing use.	St
1.1.21	Not many, but some have GPS capability.	St
1.1.22	Laptop vs.: All your standard PC applications are available.	St
1.1.23	You can listen to music, watch videos, edit audio and video, use the internet to its full potential, play a commercial video game if your laptop is good enough (not a &quot;play for 15 minutes game&quot; that you see on smartphones and tablets), customize everything on your system to your heart's content.	St
1.1.24	With a laptop you can do work as well as leisure and be fairly portable.	St
1.1.25	Perhaps when everyone else posts their pro/con lists I may see more instances in which a tablet device is optimal compared to a smartphone or a netbook/laptop.	St
1.1.26	I can see the potential for such devices, but in their current form (a suped up smartphone OS, having to use docks to use an actual keyboard) I see them as being mediocre substitutes for a smartphone (has superior portability) and a netbook/laptop (which run full operating systems and have very few restrictions compared to a tablet device).	St
1.2.1	Is this thread dead?	St
1.3.1	There are open discussions about the post-PC world.	St
1.3.2	Many are not ready and your post lead off that you don't get it.	St
1.3.3	Why would you get one?	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
