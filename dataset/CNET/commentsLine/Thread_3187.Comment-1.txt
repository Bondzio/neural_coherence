post 1 of 2 | back to top your opinion on what to buy??
[readme] by exobrute - 3/23/09 5:53 pm alright now i am soooo frusterated right now.
i dont what to get.
i am getting a new computer for my 16th birthday for sure but idk which one.
my parents are willing to spend about $1200, not much more.
at first i was going to get a refurb aluminum unibody macbook pro 2.4ghz for $1600 but i would have to spend $400 of my own money, i was very set on this until my friend said i should build my own custom pc.
i really really love the look of the macbook pro which is why i was gonna buy it.
i also really love portability.
but the macbook pro isnt very powerful and for $1200 i can get a custom built pc from ibuypower.com.
this is its specs which i would buy: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- case- nzxt tempest gaming tower case case lighting- cold cathode neon light blue power supply- 800 watt -- power supply quad sli ready processor- intel core i7 processor 920 4x 2.66ghz/8mb l3 cache processor cooling- ibuypower napoleon cpu cooling fan system kit motherboard- asus p6t intel x58 chipset crossfire and sli supported w/7.1 sound, triple-channel ddr3, gb lan, s-ata raid, usb 2.0, 3-way sli pci-e mb 3-way sli ) memory- 3 gb [1 gb x3] ddr3-1333 triple memory module corsair value video card- nvidia geforce gts 250 1gb w/dvi + tv out video hard drive- 320 gb hard drive serial-ata-ii, 3gb, 7200 rpm, 16m cache cd-rw/dvd-rw drive- lg 20x dual format/double layer dvdr/rw + cd-r/rw drive black ) sound card- 3d premium surround sound onboard network card- onboard lan network gb or 10/100 flash media- reader/writer 12-in-1 internal flash media card reader/writer black operating system- microsoft windows vista home basic 64bit warranty warranty- service standard 3-year limited warranty + lifetime technical support ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- now the specs of the macbook pro are like a 2.4ghz core 2 duo, nvidia 9600gt and 2gb ram.
now i know the pc specs blow away the macbook pro.
but like i said i love the portability of laptops, now ive had a desktop for ever but occasionally use my dads crap laptop.
so i dont know how much id use it portable but im sure i wuld.
also the macbook pro is amazing looking.
so which do you think i should get?
please leave all your thoughts, thanks
