<s> I own a stationery and invitation business. </s>
<s> I have searched and searched for the perfect printer and have not found it. </s>
<s> I need a printer that will print on heavy card stock and will not smear. </s>
<s> I have tried both laser and inkjet. </s>
<s> (all hp) I sent the HP 3600 back because it would not print on heavy card stock. </s>
<s> The salesperson told me that is would when I bought it. </s>
<s> I am currently using an hp Officejet Pro K550 and an HP C6180 all in one. </s>
<s> They both print text and graphics on my cards beautifully, but has a tendency to smear...especially on matte card stock. </s>
<s> The C6180 will not handle the heavier card stock, but will handle regular card stock. </s>
<s> Can anyone give me a recommendation? </s>
<s> I am looking for an inkjet printer that will not smear. </s>
<s> Does this exist? </s>
<s> I print invitations and note cards on heavy matte card stock and I need an inkjet that will handle heavy card stock and will not smear. </s>
<s> I know that laser printers do not smear, but they curl card stock. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Color laser printers is no longer for luxurious office item. </s>
<s> They can print faster and cheaper than ink jet printer and, most of all, they don't cause smearing problems even in 20 lbs cheap papers. </s>
<s> For me, I have two old color laser printers (phaser 740, HP4500 N)which I got from local Craigslist flee market ( http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites.html ) and their color graphic qualities are better than that of Dell photosmart inkjet printer or Epson 740i inkjet. </s>
<s> Considering long lifespan of printer toner, consummables of color laser printers may be cheaper than those of inkjet printers. </s>
<s> I recommend to check internet review first, then search for items either at eBay (nearby address) or at your local Craigslist, contact nearby sellers, check the printer, and buy it. </s>
<s> You won't regret! </s>
<s> Do your printers handle heavy card stock? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
