i suggest looking at an hp.
it is a middle range brand with good quality.
another good brand is lenovo and for $500 you'll find something nice with either brand.
since you dont need anything fancy, look for something with these specs: * intel core i3 -or- intel core 2 duo -or- amd athlon ii * 3 or 4 gigabytes of memory * 500gb hard drive or more * windows 7 i've read not to bother with any warranty they offer because usually problems occur within the first year and the manufacturer should cover that.
here's a few i've picked out for your price range.
hopefully this helps =)
