<s> I have a wireless router on my computer and a couple of days ago every time I try to get on the internet it gives me blank pages and I have to hit refresh or go several times so that I can access the internet. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the problem could be the laptop that I have a wireless connection is doing the same thing. </s>
<s> Before I bought the wireless router I had a hard wired router and I thought maybe it would work if I put it back on and it does the same exact thing. </s>
<s> Maybe its my computer or I dont know. </s>
<s> If anyone can help me out I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> I connected my cable modem directly to my computer without the router and it works fine no problems. </s>
<s> It only happens when I have the router connected. </s>
<s> Just to let you know I have a D-Link DI-604 and DI-524(wireless) routers. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> The dl 524 is the one I use and it was problematic until I updated the firmware to version 1.11 which is from March 2005. </s>

<s> Would that cause to happen to both routers cause prior to a few days ago they worked great and I never had a problem with them even when I first installed it. </s>
<s> I don't know if I mentioned it but the power in our house went out and after that it started giving me problems. </s>
<s> Do you think replacing the ethernet cables would work? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Current firmware before ripping the network apart. </s>
<s> Of course you can go whichever direction you want. </s>
