Hello All Just wondering whether anyone could recommend a decent 2.1 speaker system or even a REAL good 2.0 system for my computer - not an expert in this field so any advice would be well appreciated!
Some other info: * I use my pc (MS Vista O/S) for watching films as well as listening to music - no games!
* It will be in a small-medium sized room so don't want too many wires, and don't want a huge system as have enough clutter as it is!
* Budget - less than 100.
* I did like the Harman Kardon Soundsticks, and was originally going to go with them (from the great reviews I have read, as well as a great design) but decided against it as I read it does not have a switch to turn it off (waste of electricity - lol) and dont want it to glow whilst I am trying to sleep - need darkness!!!
* A speaker system which is great value and will hopefully last a few years!!!
And advice/recs/help of any sort will be very well appreciated!
Thanks in advance!
T.
