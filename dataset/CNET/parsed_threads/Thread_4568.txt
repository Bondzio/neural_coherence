<s> Hey I'm Isuru and have a problem that you might help I have foxconn mars motherboard, It is 3.5 years old now It has following problems, 1. </s>
<s> Some times PC not power on, mobo led bulb works, but not booting But after 2/3 days its working normally, Once starts it working completely normally, No over heatings, 45-49 C processor temp, 70-72 C while games playing. </s>
<s> (71 C normal in Core2Quad Kentsfield cpu) 2. </s>
<s> Some times processor identified wrongly as Core2Due, but after restart it shows correctly as Core2Quad. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Computer booting and no display, after 4-5 seconds it is restarting and still no disply and keep restarting. </s>
<s> But it is works fine when I re-install the battery,VGA or Ram cards until I turn off the PC. </s>
<s> When next day same problem continues. </s>
<s> (This problem arise when PC is shutdown around 10-12 hrs, boot completely normally otherwise.) </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Some times take too much time to pass the POST screen. </s>
<s> What are your ideas, please reply </s>
<s> Many have BAD CAPS. </s>
<s> Did you research BAD CAPS and then inspect for such? </s>
<s> Also, if the power supply is overtaxed or old, you'll see this. </s>

<s> Have you ever replaced the CMOS battery .... </s>
<s> If I were you, I'd consider an aftermarket CPU HS Fan....check out http://www.FROSTYTECH.COM . </s>
<s> I'm running an i860 that runs at 30C 95% of the time and only reaches 50c when I run 4 to 6 queries simultaneously. </s>
<s> Running at max TDP is a recipe for premature death or erratic behavior. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> motherboard physically looks fine, do you know any other way to check? </s>
<s> PSU also works fine when use with another PC </s>
<s> Yes I tried replacing CMOS battery, And I live in Asian Country, therefore our ambient temperture quite high, so high CPU temp is common around here </s>
<s> Do you know what bad caps look like? </s>
<s> And the fact the PSU works elsewhere does not mean it's good enough for this system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I googled how bad caps looks like, so my board doesn't have such bad caps I planining to buy Axel 500W PSU Can you tell me whether Axel is good brand or not? </s>
<s> And details are too slim about the existing system and there was no link for me to see what this Axel is. </s>
<s> Did you measure the CMOS Battery with a Volt meter? </s>
<s> What was it? </s>
<s> Sorry but troubleshooting this one is not easy on a forum. </s>
<s> Unless some clue pops up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> HS Fan.....the high ambient temp is even more reason to opt for a good CPU HS Fan like the ones reviewed over at Frostytech.com. </s>
<s> I've used a number of them and I really like the ones from Xigmatek. </s>
<s> Decent price....good thermal performance. </s>
<s> Might be good to list the exact system components to see if there are other possibilities. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I don't have instruments to check the battery, So I decided to bring PC to a repair center Thanks for your support </s>
<s> Thanks for your ideas, I decided to take pc to repair center, </s>
