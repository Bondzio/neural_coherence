<s> First off I did not realise a DVD drive used two lasers to read either DVD and normal CD Rom + Music disks. </s>
<s> How long should a DVD or other Optical drive last? </s>
<s> My drive still plays all my music CDs and can read CD Roms but it will not read any of my movies any more. </s>
<s> All they do is spin the drive up and then it says there is &quot;no disk in drive.&quot; Drive is about 14 months old. </s>
<s> Is this how long these things are meant to last these days? </s>
<s> Some machines will get months, others years. </s>
<s> The deciding factor I'm seeing is how hot it is inside the computer case. </s>
<s> While many owners learn about CPU temperatures they often neglect cooling for other parts. </s>
<s> A year may be typical for a box where the drive is a bit warm. </s>

<s> A few yrs. </s>
<s> ago many a CD drive would last longer and the reason is the speed factor. </s>
<s> As drives become more speed-X they have little room for error and &quot;settledown&quot; time is nil and quickly errors out. </s>
<s> However, a basic CD drive is darn cheap nowadays and reflects that, but quality still matters and usually will last longer excludes any other factor. </s>
<s> DVD drives by default are more demanding and quite easily get tossed early after normal wear&tear. </s>
<s> My rule of thunb upon hearing a drive going bad, is it at least 1yr. </s>
<s> and used often, then you got your money's worth if brought with the system. </s>
<s> Plus, now you have the &quot;combo drives&quot; which just allows more possibilites of having a problem, so there you go. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You guys won't believe this but just today I put a DVD into the drive and it WORKED!!! </s>
<s> I fell of my seat almost literally. </s>
<s> I think I have solved the problem of why it did not work when I first mentioned this on Monday. </s>
<s> The drive has drive belts inside that spin the disk. </s>
<s> I am not sure what the belts are made of but they seem to be a bit greasy to the touch and sometimes the drive won't spin properly when the disk is inside it.. DVD disks spin at a higher speed then normal CD or CD Rom and I suspect that all this fuss might be due to the crap quality of the drive belts and this &quot;greasy&quot; substance that builds up on them...... </s>
