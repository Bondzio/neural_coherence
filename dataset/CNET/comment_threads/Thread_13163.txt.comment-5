Does your microphone work OK?
Typically I have used a boom mic placed on the desktop.
With this mobo I had to hold the boom mic next to my lips to get any pick up at all.
Tried switching to headset and attached microphone and still can only just get faint pickup.
Same problem with front panel and rear panel connectors.
Adjusted everything than I can see and can make it no better.
Machines is multi boot with xp pro and xp pro x64.
Same problems on both.
Wonder if it is some issue with the Intel supplied audio software but there is no way to uninstall that I can find so short of re-installing whoile OS that can't be done - close to doing that as I am a Skype user and this machine cannot be used for that the way it is Any ideas?
