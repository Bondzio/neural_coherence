i have windows vista, dont see an override option available in the dxdiag tool.
it is set at 60 hertz though.
i even tried forcing the 60 hertz function in ati catalist control center, no luck.
when i open the game, it still tries to run at 75 hertz and says not optimum setting and goes into standby mode.
