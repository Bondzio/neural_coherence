your old hard drive is damaged.
to recover data, you need the services of a hard drive technician, it could be a lens alignment problem, mechanical problem, but surely not virus related.
doing so (data recovery procedure) will really cost you a lot especially if you have important files in it, it will be wiser to send the hard drive to the manufacturer, they know what to do with their hard drives.
