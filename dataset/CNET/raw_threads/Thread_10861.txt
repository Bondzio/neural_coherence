However, the modem is not in the office, where the phone needs to be. I was able to get the phone to connect to the network in the office by plugging it into a computer on the wireless network, and telling Microsoft Windows to bridge the wireless and LAN connections. However, when I began using the phone, the call would frequently cut out. Someone told me this is because the wireless is not fast enough to relay the voice signal. However, the computers on the network have used voip programs like Skype without any lags or cut outs. Is it possible that the delay is being caused by the windows bridge? In short, if I get a wireless bridge from D-Link/Netgear/Linksys, and plug the phone into that instead of the windows computer, will it eliminate the problem? The computer is running Windows XP SP2 and the wireless network runs off a D-Link DI-524 wireless router (the network is a wireless G network). Thank you for any help, svz90

I used such a system for awhile and found that over wifi it was too unreliable. I moved to another system later in which I wired the voip to the router and that worked fairly well. I don't expect anyone to tell you that this or that will work since wifi is subject to a lot of interference. I decline from writing much about this interference since I'd be duplicating web content. This is likely why it cuts out. Bob
