<s> I have a computer service business that I started over a year ago that I run out of my house. </s>
<s> One thing that I don't have it some diagnostic utility to test hard drives. </s>
<s> When a customer suspects that their hard drive is going bad, I'm not really sure how to check that out. </s>
<s> Is there some utility that can be used for this purpose? </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Are from the hard drive's maker. </s>
<s> Where? </s>
<s> Their web site. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Like Bob said...each HDD mfg has free diagnostic SW to test their HDDs available on their repsective WEBSITES. </s>
<s> It's must have software. </s>
