As some of you might know from previous posts Im planning on buying a computer and I saw that the AMD processor is much cheaper than the Intel processor and I wonder if there is any bigger difference between these two computers: AMD: Cooler Master Centurion 5 Miditower Black/Silver without PSU Chieftec CFT-500A-12S 500W ATX/DualX EPS-12V 120mm Fan 20/24-pin (AMD&P4 OK) Gigabyte GA-MA790FX-DS5 AMD790FX 4DDR2-DIMM 2PCI 5PCIe SATA Raid Audio GB-LAN Firewire Socket AM2+ ATX Samsung SH-S203D/BEBN DVDRW Dual-Layer 20X BLACK Bulk SATA Processor: AMD Phenom 9850 BLACK EDITION Quad-Core 2.5GHz 4x1MB (L2+L3) 125W Boxed (with cpu-cooler!)
Socket AM2+ RAM: A-DATA 2048MB DDR2 PC2-6400 800MHz HDD: Samsung HD501LJ 500GB 7200rpm 16MB SATA2 Graphics: BFG GeForce 9800GX2 1024MB DDR3 TV-out HDTV DUAL DVI RETAIL PCI Express OS: Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit DVD Svensk OEM INTEL: Cooler Master Elite 332 Miditower without PSU Chieftec CFT-500A-12S 500W ATX/DualX EPS-12V 120mm Fan 20/24-pin (AMD&P4 OK) Gigabyte GA-EP35-DS3 iP35 4DDR2-DIMM 3PCI 4PCIe SATA Raid Audio GB-LAN Socket775 ATX Samsung SH-S203D/BEBN DVDRW Dual-Layer 20X BLACK Bulk SATA Processor: Intel Core 2 QUAD Q9450 2.66GHz 12MB FSB1333 Boxed (with cpu-cooler!)
Socket 775 (The other components are all the same as on the AMD computer) Now, the price of the AMD processor ($ 296) is lower than the Intel processor ($ 440) but what are the other differences between these processors?
Ive heard that AMD processors are better for gaming (which I will use it for) is it therefore better to buy the AMD processor?
Any other tips/recommendations on the computer as a whole are appreciated.
