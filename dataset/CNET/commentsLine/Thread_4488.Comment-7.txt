the msi may have hdmi outputs.
i've used the amd version of of this asus as a workstation/guest room pc with a 26&quot; lcd tv so i know it will work great as a home theater pc.
i let my subcontractors/clients rdp into the it to do their work/see demos, and i let my neices/nephews use it as their pc when they spend a weekend.
