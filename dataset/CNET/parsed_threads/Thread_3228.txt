<s> i just got an hp pavillion a1510n, still not sure of what to think of it yet. </s>
<s> i was told it is compatible for all the new software coming up like windows vista, then of course i didnt have a computer at the time to confirm anything, considering i needed the internet to do that. </s>
<s> so if anyone knows how this model of computer will do in the future let me know. </s>
<s> And ill take any suggestions and opinions on what would be a good investment to boost my computer performance. </s>
<s> such as graphic cards, ect. </s>
<s> ect. </s>
<s> These two links should provide you an answer: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/evaluate/hardware/vistarpc.mspx http://www.pcpitstop.com/vistaready/default.asp?AdID=256892 Use and verify for Vista readiness. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy this opinion is mine and no political party supports it </s>
<s> ok thanx theres something that comes up saying i need to download a utility thing to take the test. </s>
<s> but when i need to know, and have the money for vista, ill know where to go. </s>
<s> thanx again </s>
<s> Yeah, d/l the sit, its not intrusive. </s>
<s> It will check your system and compare it to what Vista needs. </s>
<s> Understand also, that Vista will come in various flavours and need a *minium* to run for its most basic release, as more bells&whistles are added, sure it needs more. </s>
<s> As in OSes before it, I don't doubt that Vista(when openly sold) will run its own tests and see if it can be installed, thus the last test before installing for sure. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> ok ill d/l that stuff then and see how it gos thanx </s>
