you're right that i didn't check the jumper.
i didn't need to because when i first installed it, i had set the 250gb drive's jumper to designate it as the master, and the 40gb as the slave.
my cables are even conveniently labeled as master or slave, so i'm very confident i matched them up properly.
since removing the 40gb would only detach it from the slave position, the 250gb on the master position shouldn't be an issue since the jumpers would remain the same as i initially configured it.
or am i missing something?
anyway, with both drives connected, my bios clearly shows that my 250gb drive has priority over the other in boot sequence.
i have gone to double-check that nothing has changed in this setting after removing the 40gb slave drive, but this is the clincher...the 250gb no longer appears as an option.
no hard drives appear as an option, so it's not even a matter of confusing them.
i've double checked and triple and quadruple checked the cables to be sure they're all secure, and they are.
in fact, if i reattach the cables to the 40gb and never touch the 250gb's cables, everything works just fine again.
unfortunately, a windows repair install on the 250gb would never work because my bios has no clue that there's even a single drive there to install anything onto.
the only reason i was able to install windows on it in the first place is because the 40gb happened to be connected at the time.
