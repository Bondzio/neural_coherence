My software is InCD 4.2 and Nero Express 6. For the past few weeks I have been unable to burn on CDRs. I keep getting a burn process failed message. I've tried using different CDR brands (verbatim, sony, imation, kodak etc) to no avail. The drive can still play DVDs, read and write on CD-RWs. The only function that isn't working is the burning process. Sys specs: winxp, 256 RAM 20gb hd 64 ram vid card P 4 1.7 ghz Thanks,
