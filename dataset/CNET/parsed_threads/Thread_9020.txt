<s> I'm switching to a Mac from a PC and have been trying to decide which model to get. </s>
<s> For a number of reasons, rational and emotional, I've settled on the iMac G5. </s>
<s> I was wondering about the various configurations and this question seems at least a little relevant. </s>
<s> If you (the collective you) had the choice between a 20&quot; display with 1GB of memory or a 17&quot; display with 1.5GB, which side of the equation would you come down on? </s>
<s> (I think I've officially entered the nit-picky phase of selection). </s>
<s> Thanks, Jay </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> I can add RAM later. </s>
<s> I can't add 3 inches to the display. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think this is a no-contest. </s>
<s> As Bob rightly pointed out, adding 3&quot; to an LCD is not possible. </s>
<s> Adding RAM is easy. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies. </s>
<s> They make sense and seem obvious in retrospect (one of those ''why didn't I think of that'' moments). </s>
<s> The original question arose because a colleague at the university where I work said Macs are ''memory intensive''. </s>
<s> So after looking at the 17'' iMac on display at the campus store, I was ready to order one with 1.5 or 2 gigs of memory. </s>
<s> Then I made the mistake of visiting a real Apple store and seeing one with a 20'' monitor and I realized I probably can't afford a big monitor plus 2 gigs of ram. </s>
<s> This put me in a tizzy and resulted in my wondering whether I should invest in big memory or big display. </s>
<s> Do Macs need a large amount of memory? </s>
<s> Is one gig enough for a MacIntosh that will be used for standard web duties, some video and photo editing, and the preparation of lectures with Powerpoint? </s>
<s> I'm sorry if I seem obsessive. </s>
<s> Its just that this is my first foray into Macs and I would like to get it at least semi-right. </s>
<s> I also apologize if this submission appears twice. </s>
<s> I sent it from my office but it hadn't appeared as of this evening so I tried again. </s>
<s> Thanks once more, Jay </s>
<s> Your choice of Mac with a Gig of RAM will do everything you ask of it. </s>
<s> Having said that, you can never have too much RAM but, for right now and the job description, you are set. </s>
<s> go get it and enjoy it P </s>
<s> I'm convinced. </s>
<s> Should I order the wireless keyboard and mouse or stick with the default wired units? </s>
<s> I've read that some don't like Apple's mouse and use aftermarket products. </s>
<s> I'm still not sure about the difference between Bluetooth and wireless but is a Bluetooth enabled keyboard and mouse worthwhile technology? </s>
<s> I'll probably install Virex if only to keep from transmitting viruses with email. </s>
<s> Do I need to use an antispyware program periodically? </s>
<s> I presently spend the first 15 minutes of my day clearing spyware that Counterspy detects on my PC. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Jay </s>
<s> Bluetooth is a short range wireless signal, usually for input devices like the keyboard, mouse, headsets, joysticks and some printers. </s>
<s> It's pretty neat. </s>
<s> By ordering it built into your system, you will not have to take up a USB port should you decide to go with it in the future. </s>
<s> The Apple Mouse has only one button, as source of much discussion in the Mac world, but OS X has built in support for a two button mouse, including a third party bluetooth one. </s>
<s> I know of no Anti-Spyware programs for the Mac, I'm sure there are some out there, but Spyware and Malware are not currently a problem on the Mac. </s>
<s> The majority of the stuff is aimed at Windows boxes. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I went all the way with iMac: 20&quot; screen and 2 gigs of memory. </s>
<s> I read on the Apple site that with matched memory sticks &quot;it will operate with a 128-bit data path&quot; instead of the 64 one DIMM would support. </s>
<s> Sounds good to me. </s>
<s> I look forward to learning the system and putting all that power to use. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Jay </s>
<s> I'm sat here using a mere MacMini with 512Mb Ram and a 20'' Cinema Display, and for the majority of what I actually do with my machine, it is more than adequate. </s>
<s> While it is almost certainly slower and less slick than any G5 based machine, performance feels better than the PC in the other room with a roughly similar spec (512Mb, 1.3Mhz CPU). </s>
<s> Then again, I've sussed that most of my wife and I's PC usage is very light, hence going for a Mac Mini rather than something with a top end graphics card. </s>
<s> I am not heavily using Photoshop (and when I do, I am not usually working at photo quality), and I haven't started heavily using iMovie, Garageband or iDVD. </s>
<s> The first time I hit the constraints of the machine was using Garageband, but I was testing how much I could do before it gave up (and that was CPU rather than memory). </s>
<s> SimCity didn't seem to enjoy running at the highest resolution - I've not done any investigation there, my hunch is that it graphics card as 32Mb is the bare minimum suggested. </s>
<s> If you do a lot of Photoshop work or A/V editing, then the more RAM the better. </s>
