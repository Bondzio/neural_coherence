<s> Hi guys, I have a Western Digital MYBOOK 500GB harddrve which i mainly use to back up my music, videos and pictures. </s>
<s> I connect it to my Sony VGN-S2XP which runs Win XP. </s>
<s> Recently it started acting up, not being recognised from time to time, but unplugging it and plugging it back would usually do the trick. </s>
<s> I assumed that my USB ports on my laptop were just loose, which also sounded right for the &quot;disconnect&quot; happening whenever i was transferring lots of data from my harddrive back to my laptop. </s>
<s> The harddrive would not be recognised anymore an dthe data transfer would be stopped. </s>
<s> Whenever it disconnected i needed a few tries to get it LIVE again, and sometimes the harddrive was recognised but whenever i clicked on it, i got a message asking me to reformat it as its not the right format. </s>
<s> (??) </s>
<s> Anyways, I was due to get a new machine anyway (was longing for a desktop) so got a Sony TP1 last week (which runs on Vista). </s>
<s> When i connected the harddrive Vista crashed. </s>
<s> I then tried to connect the harddrive back to my laptop bt it keeps asking me to FORMAT the harddrive (if it actually recognises the harddrive). </s>
<s> 2 questions: 1) I want to save my music collection (and myself from ripping all of it all over again, which took me months) and wondered if there is anything i can do to retrieve the data. </s>
<s> I can't even access the directory in dos mode. </s>
<s> 2) I only recently had the same problem with another 80GB harddrive of mine, which was about three years old so i assumed it was normal wear and tear. </s>
<s> This Mybook Harddrive is less than 4 months old, so very strange. </s>
<s> Could it be some virus causing that? </s>
<s> I ran antivirus and spywareblaster on it and nothing came up for it. </s>
<s> How can i avoid it again next time? </s>
<s> The harddrive stands around on a table most of the time, its not anywhere where it would be moved a lot, or could overheat. </s>
<s> Btw, i did read the comments about not using an external harddrive as the only backup. </s>
<s> I never had any problems until recently but will avoid that in future. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Shareque </s>
<s> putting the disk in another enclosure and see if it behaves as you expect. </s>
<s> But as you still have warranty on it, it night be better to have it done by the shop where you bought it. </s>
<s> They won't like if you come with it in parts and say it doesn't work anymore. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> was the only location for the data ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> As my music collection was over 60GB, and i only had 80 GB disc space on my laptop it just seemed a waste to keep it all on the laptop. </s>
<s> I unfortunately formatted my 40GB ipod just recently and was able to retrieve only 20GB worth of music from it. </s>
<s> So anything i can do to get the data back? </s>
<s> Any program? </s>
<s> Last time this happened with my old harddrive i ended up paying 200 ($400) to retrieve the data. </s>
<s> I dont want to do this all over again. </s>
<s> I am happy to pay for an effective program and be able to use it if this ever happens again. </s>
<s> Also, anyone has an answer why this keeps happening? </s>
<s> Could it be a virus which creates bad clusters? </s>
<s> It depends on the cause of the trouble. </s>
<s> If it's a hardware issue it's unlikely any recovery program will salvage your data, because it just can't access the disk. </s>
<s> If it's just the data being a little bit damaged, it might work. </s>
<s> A program to try: http://www.z-a-recovery.com/download.htm Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Because hard disks fail. </s>
<s> It's not a matter of IF they will but WHEN they will. </s>
<s> Often it takes costly events to get some to learn about backup. </s>
<s> If you have one copy of something on a hard disk, then it's likely to go missing (someday.) </s>
<s> In your case I would buy a NEW USB EXTERNAL DRIVE CASE and move the drive over and hope it comes back. </s>
<s> That 400 buck recovery fee was a bargain, but wouldn't a set of DVDRW (10?) </s>
<s> hold what you can't lose for 20 bucks? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This ZAR recovery program was great. </s>
<s> I did not buy the full version but used the free trial one. </s>
<s> I think its a great item and i'll proably spend the money for it anyway. </s>
<s> It ran for like 3 days and required a few clicks in between as well, but after itw as done verifying the data, my harddrive was recognised again and i was able to retrieve some data. </s>
<s> I lost some data, which is unreadable now, but lets say 75% of the data is there, which is great news! </s>
<s> Can only recommend that link. </s>
<s> Thanks mate. </s>
<s> Helped a lot!! </s>
