dear uncertain: i fix many customer computers.
the first thing i do when i meet with a customer is understand his needs, not mine.
you sound like a very light user who is happy with his computer but needs more disk space.
a savvy tech can transfer all of the information from your current drive to the new drive without skipping a heartbeat.
then you could use your existing drive to copy files to for backup.
in addition, partitioning the new drive with system and data partitions would give you added reliabilty against system failures.
you processor and ram are adequate for the average user and fulfill the needs for xp.
as i said, if that is the only issue (disk space), then you could probably get by another 3 years or so with your current system.
if you think you need or want a new system go for it.
