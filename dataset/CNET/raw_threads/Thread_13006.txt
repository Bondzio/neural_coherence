Both servers get their Ethernet connection by both connecting to a switch and then connecting to my Belkin router. One of the servers is a microprocessor with Ethernet connectivity and the other is a video server. As an initial test, Ive successfully been able to connect to both the video and microprocessor server at the same time while connected to the same network. Ive learned some about port forwarding and I configured my router to forward port80 using the microprocessors private IP address. As a result, I was able to access the microprocessor server remotely. The processor has stored a webpage that has a frame that retrieves the video feed from the video server. So I tried configuring my router to forward another port (I selected and arbitrary port other than port 80) to the video servers private IP address. Question 1: Am I allowed to arbitrarily assign another port (other than port80) for the video server or are theyre only certain ones I can use? I tried this http:// &lt;routers public IP&gt;:&lt;port number&gt; to access servers video feed, but it didnt work. Question 2: After assigning a port to forward for the video server, what would be its URL so that I can access it remotely too? This will be used for the URL written in the HTML code on the framed page that accesses the video server. Thanks so much in advance for your help! Windell

I will not duplicate ready web content on port mapping and port forwarding. Besides you didn't supply the model number so you made a choice to hamper others help. I can't check if your router was a good choice for this. Sorry if this sounds crass, but you must make a good post if you want a &quot;do this on this router's page.&quot; Your post was clear enough but neglected a key item. Who and what I do. I also design and program embedded devices. Some are on ethernet and are remotely accessed via the internet so I've done this mapping. What devices? Cameras, access control, doors, temp, counts, etc. Bob

Mr. Proffitt, My questions were meant to be independent of a specific router because most routers these days already have the option to enable port forwarding. Also, my application shouldn;t really be of your concern because again it is independent of my questions. I understand that my post might've been unclear, but if you're sorry to be &quot;crass&quot; then why do you do it. If you would like for clarification, I would've appreciated it if you asked instead of accusing me that my post was a choice on mypart to hamper others help.

I see you don't want to head to to the solution and let others supply you a do this for a specific router but by doing so you could learn what you need to know about solving your issue. Make better posts, get better answers is what I've heard. I did rewrite my first reply a few times and couldn't find a good way to tell you that leaving out details hampers everyone including you. I also can't be your &quot;tech support&quot; so I've taken to not duplicating ready web content about port forwarding and other topics. There are only so many hours in a day and only so many members that will reply. Even less when the post is not complete. Bob
