1.1.1	I have a old pentium 2 computer with a 3 gig hard drive .	St
1.1.2	My uncle thought it would be & quot ; nice & quot ; to format that and then give me windows xp pro along with microsoft office .	St
1.1.3	I now have about 400 mb of space LEFT ( he thought that was soooo funny ) .	St
1.1.4	I put in another 3 gig hard drive that has already been formated and is compleatly empty .	St
1.1.5	my question is what do I now need to do to make everything work , AND transfer some stuff from one to the other .	St
1.1.6	Or whatever will work the best .	St
1.1.7	HELP ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.8	!	St
1.2.1	Lib , Why do n't you ask your uncle : - ) ?	Ques
1.2.2	I wonder if the machine ( speed of CPU , amount of RAM , speed of hard disk ) is up to Windows XP Pro , even if you upgrade it to 6 ( =3+3 ) Gb hard disk .	St
1.2.3	It might be better to go back to what it was ( Windows 98 ? ) .	Ques
1.2.4	Tell more about it for advice .	St
1.2.5	If you can see the empty hard drive in My Computer and Windows Explorer , it is already working and will be called d : .	St
1.2.6	It will come in handy even if you decide to go back to Windows 98 .	St
1.2.7	The best thing to do is to move & quot ; My Documents & quot ; to that drive , and take care to put all your personal files there .	St
1.2.8	http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1566676,00.asp tells how to do it ( quite simple , in fact ) .	St
1.2.9	And you might consider to uninstall MS Office and reinstall that to a folder on that drive .	St
1.2.10	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.11	Kees	St
1.3.1	MS Office , while nice may be too much for such a machine .	St
1.3.2	I want to share that Open Office from http : //www.openoffice.org is not very big ( megabytes on the hard disk ) and will give you the word processor , powerpoint and spreadsheet you may want with great compatibility with MS Office .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	You did n't mention what PII cpu was present but even so , the system with XP pro on it will work hard just with it alone .	St
1.4.2	In the long haul , the system just ca n't handle the excessive demands of that OS even though MS says it can .	St
1.4.3	It will be slow and outright be a slug , compared to at least win98 .	St
1.4.4	If anything , try a larger hard drive of at least 10gb or better and use it alone in the system with XP pro for simpliticy sake .	St
1.4.5	I just would n't recommend your arrangement now with XP , I think you 'll see that as you get on .	St
1.4.6	sorry ... enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
