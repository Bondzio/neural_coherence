hi skip thanks for responding.
sometimes, it keeps re-booting so many times that i didn't even get to see the desktop at all.
the system freeze up at detecting the ide hard disk when before this, there is a series of re-boots.
it will also re-boot itself when i am on the desktop.
when this happens, i will be prompt to start up at safe mode.
and it re-boot itself even when i try starting it up at safe mode.
after the upgrade, i formatted my old 3 yr old 40gb ide hard disk which is running on win98.
and install xp with sp1.
i have not downloaded sp2.
i had installed a 15-day trial norton antivirus 2005 to temporarily prevent any virus infection.
when you say the heatsink and fan may not be seated right, do you mean that it is not installed properly on the motherboard?
would it be any case of irq conflict?
i notice that 2 or 3 drivers are sharing 1 irq or memory address.
thanks.
