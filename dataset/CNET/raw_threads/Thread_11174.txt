11552	0	191870	2076079	NR	vincebuttons	7/17/06 7:04 PM	1.15316304E12	Need a little CPU help	I'm basically building a new desktop (the only things I'm taking from my old system is the HD, CD/DVD drives, sound card, and the floppy). Mboard: Foxconn NF4SK8AA-8KRS ATX nForce4 SLI VideoCard: Leadtek WinFast PX7300GT TDH Geforce 256MB RAM: 1GB (will upgrade later) I'm still in the planning stage, but I'm stuck between CPU choices. I'm not a huge gamer, but I do pay every once in a while. My main perogative is imaging and video, primarily imaging and 3D graphics stuff. I've narrowed down to two different processors. AMD Athlon 64 3500+ Venice 2000MHz AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Manchester 2000MHz HT Dual Core Budget-wise, I'd go with the AMD Athlon Venice, but I'm not sure if I'd be better off performance wise with the dual core Manchester. Your thoughts, anyone?

Simple. GB.
