1.1.1	Had my custom machine since Summer 2003 .	St
1.1.2	I 'm thinking about keeping some parts while upgrading other core parts .	St
1.1.3	Here 's a breakdown .	St
1.1.4	Keeping : Maxtor 120 Gb HDD Samsung 1 Tb HDD WD 500 Gb External HD 4x 512 Mb RAM Sticks ( Might upgrade to 4x 1 Gb Ram Sticks ) nVidia 6800 GT 256 Mb SoundBlaster Audigy 2 Gamer Case ( its light aluminum , with swinging side doors for easy access ) Need : New Motherboard New Processor ( Thinking Pentium Quadcore ) Gon na buy a Blu-ray Drive and DVD-RW Drive I never attempted anything like this , what are the potential problems I will run into ?	Ques
1.1.5	Software , installation etc .	St
1.1.6	Also , I 'm not that familiar with mobos , whats a good high end product ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Upgrade the power supply , and count on the old OS install to go down in flames .	St
1.2.2	Your disaster plan will come in handy .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	if ddr , ebay it .	St
1.3.2	ditto with the 6800gt since a new $ 80 video card will be faster and you probably wo n't be able to play retail blu-ray discs with the 6800 gt ( since it has no hd acceleration nor hdcp ) .	St
1.3.3	if you have a retail version of xp , you 'll be able to re-use it .	St
1.3.4	otherwise , bank on getting a new OS ( vista ) .	St
1.3.5	look into intel p45 based mobos .	St
1.3.6	here 's a bunch : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx ? Submit=ENE & N=2010200280+107172615+1071740132 & Configurator= & Subcategory=280 & description= & Ntk= & SpeTabStoreType= & Order=BESTMATCH & srchInDesc= do n't be fooled into thinking that higher cost = higher performance .	St
1.3.7	mobos using the same chipset all perform with 2-3 % of each other .	St
1.3.8	if you do n't plan on overclocking , just go by best price with the features you want .	St
1.3.9	( no need to pay extra for things you wo n't use like dual gigabit lan ports . )	St
