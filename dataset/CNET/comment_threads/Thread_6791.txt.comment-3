&quot;could I use 512MB Ram With 256MB Ram in dual channel mode (sounds it could happen) And If yes what kind of 256mb ram could i use in this Situation?
&quot; No.
Then memory must be in pairs.
I will not explain further why this is so.
There may be some that wish such a mismatched pair would work but that's all in the computer's design and not subject to our wishes.
http://www.google.com/search?q=m2npv confirms you need pairs.
Get the second 8HTF6464AY-53ED7 from Crucial and you're done.
