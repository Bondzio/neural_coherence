dell direct replacement should get you going with the least amount of hassle.
though, excluding any 2ndary issues or continuing problems, it will be the least intrusive and you can continue on as if nothing happened.
any other action you take will require extra effort on your part if not a dell mtrbd.
and you can ask questions on this topic later.
for now i see no reason not to continue using dell, if that suits you.
