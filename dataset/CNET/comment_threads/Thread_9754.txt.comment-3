Seems like there's been no improvement in their products or there customer service, I bought 2 Flytouch 8 last week 19 Sept 2012, one seemed ok until you tried to down load anything from app store, just get error message no matter what, second one took 3 or 4 attempts to boot up and when it did the camera didn't work, by day 2 it wouldn't turn on at all.
I was told I had to return them to there office in China, because the package weighed 3.5kg it would &#163;80, a friend of mine bought one at the same time was given a return address in Surrey!
When questioned about this I was told the UK address was a post office address only and if I didn't return it to china I wouldn't get a refund.
At this point we both started a dispute with paypal, hopefully anyone buying from them has paid by paypal, if your not happy start a dispute within 20 days that way there is a chance you may get your money back, hopefully if enough people go down this route they will blacklist them, once this was done I was informed I could send the tablets back to there UK address, I will be posting parcel tomorrow so will update this post regularly untill it is resolved.
There UK adrress is, X ZHANG Suite 226 Arndale House.
3 The Precinct Hight Street.
Egham,Surrey.
TW20 9HN United Kingdom Also fill one of these forms in for Surrey trading standards, they are aware of this company, my friend actualy got a call from them wanting more informatiion, so hopefully they will be shutting them down soon.
