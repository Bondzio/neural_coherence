Michael: I regularly run Ad-aware and Spybot and often have very few items to remove.
Will also use Registry Mechanic to clean registry.
I am running XP SP2, 512 RAM, AMD Athlon XP 1.47G.
Harware includes a Motorola SB4200 modem, logitech wireless mouse and keyboard, Xtasy 9200SE 128MB video card, Audixy SX USB sound card, Creative TV card, and a Pinnicle video capture card.
I have 5 USB ports in the rear and all are full.
2 up front are used infrequently.
2 firewire ports are on the same PCI card that has the 3 USB ports.
Ehternet card is a D-Link DFE-530TX+ So what we are running into is even though there is something wrong with the ethernet connection on the desktop I would be able to keep the wired USB connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem??
Thanks
