1.1.1	So I 'm a college kid ... I have a fairly basic Dell laptop .	St
1.1.2	I mostly use it for school work , and so over the years ( I 'm graduating soon ) I 've accumlulated quite a bit of data and information .	St
1.1.3	I also like to play games on it , but have hit a wall because I can not install any new games because there is no more space on my internal hard drive .	St
1.1.4	Can I run/play games off of my external hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	Meaning I would install the program files onto the hard drive .	St
1.1.6	I 'm assuming there would n't be an issue but just though I 'd check ... .	St
1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	what you can not afford or prefer not to lose .	St
1.2.2	Once you 've done that , then pursue the game initiative .	St
1.2.3	Gaming will put a lot of additional stress on your laptop so take the time to protect your data before you start .	St
1.2.4	Keep in mind data in only once place ... an internal hard drive or especially an external hard drive , it just a second away from complete , permanent loss .	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.6	VAPCMD PS ... Putting games on an external ... you can .	St
1.2.7	Would I recommend it ..no !	St
1.2.8	Why ... . not matter where you install the app ... Windows apps will almost always put at least some files on your C : drive .	St
1.2.9	Perhaps you should consider getting a much larger hard drive for your laptop .	St
