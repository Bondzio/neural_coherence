Belkin 54g access point; Belkin 802.11 router; Motorola 54g access point; Netgear 802.11 router; Belkin wired router; Netgear wired router; no-name switches and hubs.
Offhand, I don't know the exact product numbers of all of them, but these companies usually only have one product in each category - nothing is more than a few years old.
I'm positive that the Belkin and Motorola wireless routers are configurable as access points, since they have that option right there on their HTML-based setup dialogs.
The Netgear, I'm not so sure about, and I haven't played with that one in a year or so.
