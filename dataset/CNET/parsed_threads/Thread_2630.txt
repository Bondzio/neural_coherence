<s> My computer froze up on me recently, so I switched off the power supply. </s>
<s> When I booted up again i had found that my 320GB hard drive now only has 127GB.. All my files are still around but most of my ripped movies now have a size of 0mb. </s>
<s> I am running Windows 7, the hard drive is a Seagate Barracuda 320GB 7200.11 What is going on? </s>
<s> What does Disk Management say about the disk? </s>
<s> http://hubpages.com/hub/Using-Disk-Management-in-Windows-7-Vista is a not too clear article about it. </s>
<s> The most important thing: don't CHANGE anything. </s>
<s> Don't chkdsk. </s>
<s> Don't defrag. </s>
<s> Just look with Disk Management and tell what you see. </s>
<s> I assume your off-line backup still is OK. </s>
<s> So you won't lose anything, whatever you do. </s>
<s> Still, it makes sense to be careful. </s>

<s> Disk management says that there is 170 GB unallocated. </s>
<s> it was deallocated (assuming it was in normal use). </s>
<s> Was it a separate partition (d: in stead of c:) or was there one drive that now has become smaller? </s>
<s> Time for trying a few datarecovery programs and see what they can do. </s>
<s> For example: RECUVA (free), GETDATABACK, ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY (free trials). </s>
<s> It's best to take the disk out of the machine, and into an external enclosure or on the other side of a USB2 to IDE/SATA-cable and do those experiments on another PC (or on this PC once you installed a new hard disk with an OS). </s>

<s> It happens a lot to externals. </s>
<s> This is usually where most learn that these are not storage but where we keep a copy and have backup copies. </s>
<s> The top of this forum has the usual recovery software and the company if you forgot to backup. </s>

<s> A friend of mine put this computer together for me, I'm not too computer savvy. </s>
<s> Don't know why he did not make a partition for windows, all I have is a C:\ drive. </s>
<s> What can I do to re-allocate this lost space? </s>
<s> I'm not too fussed about the lost videos, I have most of them backed up. </s>
<s> I'd reassign my optical drive to say letter &quot;O&quot;. </s>
<s> Then when you create the 2nd partition and format the HDD, it would be automatically be assigned &quot;D&quot;. </s>
