We have the Acer Aspire One Netbook and just like other netbooks you discover that it is not a laptop replacement. If you are in the home, why not a nearly the same price laptop?

The new Acer aspire one comes with 160GB hard drive, 1 GB of RAM and an atom processor for under 300 bucks. These specs are fine for most home users and you can't argue with the price. MSI's U100 Wind is also worth a look, I've had one of these for almost a year of trouble free use.
