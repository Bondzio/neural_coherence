<s> can you use a sata dvd drive with a second ata drive </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Do you have to put the ata dvd drive to slave </s>
<s> All SATA connections are &quot;masters.&quot; I am able to use both since my BIOS allows it to fake a sata connection as an IDE one. </s>
<s> As I answered the first time, I can do this and do. </s>
<s> If you need to convert the sata to ide or vice versa there are cheap adapaters (I use those too!) </s>
<s> to do that. </s>

<s> one of the drives is a sata drive the other one is not a sata drive, i put them both in today and the pc kept crashing because of a driver fault </s>
<s> Many installations of Windows are not ready to support SATA. </s>
<s> It's not a matter of master or slave but the Windows installation. </s>
<s> -&gt; I noted that many machines have a way to emulate IDE devices that are actually attached with SATA. </s>
<s> Your posts are void of any details that I could use to tell you if your machine has such a feature. </s>
<s> But you can check your manuals in the BIOS section to see if it can do that. </s>
<s> Here's an SATA to IDE adapter if you can't -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CX-STI1001&cat=CCD Bob </s>
<s> My pc is a compaq presario with xp media center 05, its an amd 64 x2 it has 4 sata conectors on the mother board and ata conectors i hope this is ok for you. </s>
<s> HP has some dozen plus models like that. </s>
<s> Hopefully you can check your manuals. </s>
<s> Remember that when many owners RELOAD or FORMAT they will omit motherboard or SATA drivers. </s>
