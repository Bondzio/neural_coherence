Hello there, i'm running a HP G62 and trying to connect an iomega 1tb HDD and it shows up in &quot;devices and printers&quot; as USB to serial-ATA Bridge but not in my computer so i obviously can't access anything. After surfing the web for an answer, everyone says i should give it a letter in computer management, but when i try the option to change the letter and path is grayed out so i can't click it=[ Can anyone please help? Thankz!

Your post does not reveal if this used to work or if it was new. If it used to work, any story about loaning it to a friend or a drop is necessary. The usual do it yourself recovery tools are a the top post in this forum. Bob

In disk management it shows up as Healthy(primary partition) but when i right click it, my options are limited to just view its properties. Drivers claim to be updated as well.

Since it sounds like the old conflicting drive letter issue I wonder what other drive letters can be freed up. For example in my (dead) HP G62 I could disable the SD CARD READER in device manager in a pinch. I can't know what's not told and sorry about that. Bob
