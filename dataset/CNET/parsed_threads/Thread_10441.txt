<s> I have a Canon MX310 aio printer that takes # 40 and # 41 ink cartridges. </s>
<s> The store did not have # 40 or # 50 in stock but had # 30 (black) and # 31 (color) . </s>
<s> Both boxers show they will work on the MX310. </s>
<s> The question is... Is # 40 & # 50 preferable or does it make a difference? </s>
<s> Thanks Ben </s>
<s> cartridge labeled for use with your model, you are safe. </s>
