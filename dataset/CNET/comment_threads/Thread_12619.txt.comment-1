I've just bought a new lexmark Z615 printer and it won't install.
On the install screen it says nothing is attached (and it is) if I try to install printer all I get is the little screen saying &quot;updating hardware database&quot; but it is NOT RESPONDING...........
I just don't know what to do, can ayone advise me.
I'm not a computer buff so no fancy language, plain simple english :o) I'm using windows ME
