<s> Anyone have some advice on a reasonabel priced exteral hard drive 40-60GB any info would be appreciated. </s>
<s> But I think today's drives are very reasonable compared to what we paid a few years ago. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> They generally don't offer 60s any more but you can get 40s and 80s. </s>
<s> WD and Seagates will be in the low $50 range for 40 gigs and about $4 more to double the size. </s>
<s> Of course if you expect you'll never approach 40 gigs, you can still get a burger (without fries) for the difference. </s>
<s> In Australia MAXTOR are selling their 80GB ext HD for $99. </s>
<s> I think that is reasonable. </s>
<s> They were $149. </s>
<s> However, when I bought one, and left it plugged in and connected to the power, after a short time, just a day or two, the light went out.I took it back, got a replacement, and the same thing happened again. </s>
<s> Now I am being told that MAYBE I should not have left it plugged into the power so long. </s>
<s> Perhaps I should have only turned it ON when I wanted to use it, and then turn it OFF as soon as I had finished my &quot;backup&quot;. </s>
<s> It was ONLY the power cord that stuffed up, and I could not get a new replacement cord and keep the HD. </s>
<s> I had to return the WHOLE lot. </s>
<s> Now I am going to get a LACIE 160GB which is going to cost a heck of a lot more, but what can I do? </s>
<s> I still think the power cord should not have malfunctioned like it did. </s>
<s> Lots of people are leaving things plugged into the power all the time, so why not an external hard drive? </s>
<s> Try walking into a store. </s>
<s> Staples often has random deals. </s>
<s> I got a Maxtor ext hd 80GB for $80. </s>
<s> Try checking out Best Buy, Comop USA, etc. </s>
<s> Else, try online places like Newegg or search on pricewatch or pricegrabber. </s>
<s> 60GB ext hd should be no more than $60. </s>
