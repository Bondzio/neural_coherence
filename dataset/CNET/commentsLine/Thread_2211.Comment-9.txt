all that said now i know why thanks now my next question is there a particular usb/bt unit that you would recommend for what i'm doing i'm thinking(perhaps wrongly) of a unit that looks similar to at bt unifier like the one that comes w/ a bt mouse or will i have to get a unit that attaches to the vehicle somewhere then uses the bt to trasmit to the unifier in the port
