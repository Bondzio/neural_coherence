I'm tired of moving my notebook around and I'm about to set my outlook to work based on the external hard drive and have all my docs there.
I would be moving far less weight.
I was thinking of getting a disk with a firewire connection so it goes faster.
Would like to know if anybody has tried it before and how it worked...
