<s> Reading through some of these threads it becomes evident how little I know... </s>
<s> I need to set up a wireless, secured network for about 6 individuals located across the country. </s>
<s> I need a central server, probably FTP ability... Where do I start? </s>
<s> I am not an IT guy (obviously, the crowd says!) </s>
<s> but am more than a complete newb on a computer... </s>
<s> This is for a small business startup to give you the obvious context.. </s>
<s> Since this is probably too advanced for me, can anyone recommend a company that provides this service? </s>
<s> Thanks for your time and help Chuck </s>
<s> Do you know if these individuals will be in fixed sites or will they be roaming? </s>
<s> Since you said they are located across the country, I'll suggest you look up VPNs and use virtual private networking. </s>
<s> They could have access either by wired or wireless from many locations. </s>
<s> You mentioned FTP which is simply for file transfer so I presume it's for document sharing. </s>
<s> You'll need a server somewhere that's open to the web. </s>
<s> My best suggestion, since you said you're not an IT guy, is to hire one. </s>
<s> I can't tell you who to turn to as this depends on your location. </s>
<s> You may have someone in your city who you can call that would be happy to sit down with you and chat about your needs. </s>
<s> I appreciate the reply... yes, I think I will hire out a pro. </s>
<s> I just thought I would get a few tips first. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help. </s>

<s> I agree with the other comment about contacting an IT professional. </s>
<s> Starting a company with geographically dispursed staff will need careful planning. </s>
<s> I run an IT consulting firm in Atlanta; however, we consult with companies across the country. </s>
<s> I would love to speak with you to understand your specific requirements. </s>
