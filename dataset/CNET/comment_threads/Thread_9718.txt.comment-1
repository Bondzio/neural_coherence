I have joined sky and today I tried to set up their router, it has connected to the laptop (which is vista) but not to my desktop (which is xp).
I have called sky and they were very unhelpful.
I dont have time to argue with them to get it working so I was hoping to get some help from this forum can anyone direct me to where I can get some troubleshooting tutorials to get around my problem.
I have been looking but so far haven't found anything that has helped
