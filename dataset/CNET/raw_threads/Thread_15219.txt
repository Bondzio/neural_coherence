It went to sleep. I woke up my laptop, and both screens showed the waking up loading windows, then the second screen went black. Before, it still let me use the second screen even though I couldn't see anything, now I can't extend to the second screen through display settings. If I try now, the laptop seems to get set to the lowest display settings possible, and the second screen stays dark. Help?

But I feel like as soon as it falls asleep and I try to wake it up, it's going to not want to wake up again. So it's not that it's not supported I think, since it does work, but it doesn't wake up after falling asleep. I've seen other forum posts like this but there weren't answers to those either.

You can make this a warranty claim now. I have no answers since there is so little to work with in your post. Thus I only can share what it was for me, most of the time. Bob

When the laptop went to sleep, the second monitor could turn on again, but when it hibernated, the second monitor stayed off, but was still there, ie I could move my mouse onto it, as well as other windows. Thanks for your help. Also, I'm out of warranty since I got it over a year ago.

Why is that. -&gt; But tell me what date driver you are using. I see the drivers at http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/CS-022034.htm and the date looks to be 2/15/2008. Again, for completeness I'll install the latest chipset and graphics drivers when I see this issue. Your posts never revealed if you did that. Bob
6149	6	312400	2883402	2883338	theblackred	10/16/08 11:25 AM	1.2241563E12	945gm chipset family	So I tried downloading the driver update (from 6/28/2008) from the intel site for my computer, Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit edition. The first page of the installer said the drivers the installer updated, and the 945GM Express Chipset family was included on the list. Then setup quits saying &quot;The driver being installed is not validated for this computer. Please obtain the appropriate driver from the computer's manufacturer.&quot; Hm... But it says my driver is from 12/12/2006, and when I try to update it from the device manager and tell it to search the internet to find the upgrade, it says that I already have the most up to date version.
6149	7	312400	2883494	2883402	R. Proffitt	10/16/08 12:42 PM	1.22416092E12	That's it.	You have a very outdated driver. 12/12/2006 predates Vista's release. I see we've found the most likely cause. In closing, UAC can block drivers. I know to shut that down during driver installs. Also I didn't see Vista mentioned till this last post. Since you are making incomplete posts, it's unlikely that anyone can guess what the issue is but given that date I'd say you found it. Bob
6149	8	312400	2883535	2883494	theblackred	10/16/08 1:01 PM	1.22416206E12	Yeah, but	I have UAC completely disabled because it's annoying, and when I try to install the update it gives the error message I copied into my last response. Any insight on why that would happen? Since I downloaded the 945GM express chipset update, and that's the chipset I have, I don't know why it's giving me that error message. But I agree that's probably it. Thanks for the help again

There's a reason I haven't and it's because the details are being slowed given out. When you post, everytime you post there is a note asking you to give out details. Without such I am left to wait for the details or just give general responses. You found the most likely cause of the issue. Bob

Proffitt	10/16/08 2:00 PM	1.2241656E12	Let's check those specs.	http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/2007/Oasis/1014554R/1014554Rsp2.shtml &quot;Video controller Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 Up to 224 MB of shared video memory (when 512 MB or more system memory present)&quot; Now let's find the i950 drivers. http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/index.htm is a start and the i945GM is NOT LISTED!!! http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/search.asp?st=pn&param=7515416 is interesting as they show NO VISTA DRIVERS!!! Are you sure this laptop is supposed to be running Vista? Let's take this one step at a time. Try the 4 drivers listed at http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/CS-020683.htm for vista Bob

It had a harddrive problem so they sent me another with factory defaults this past winter, 1/2008, so it's even more strange the driver is from 2006. I googled my installation error &quot;The driver being installed is not validated for this computer&quot; and it seems like other people with gateway laptops have this error.

6149	13	312400	2883688	2883622	R. Proffitt	10/16/08 5:27 PM	1.22417802E12	I can see why.	I see no less than FOUR possible drivers. Using the i945gm should have failed. Again, you have a warranty issue. It's been defective since day one it seems. Bob
6149	14	312400	2883732	2883688	theblackred	10/16/08 6:20 PM	1.2241812E12	Lol	Oh lol. Found the solution on some european world of warcraft forum. Apparently there's some glitch with the .exe file intel's update uses that makes vista unhappy. So I had to download the zip file for the 945gm driver, and then tell the driver to update from a disk, but actually find the place where i extracted the zip file to and say that's where it should update from. Specifically a .inf file in the extracted updater. Tricky. So yeah nothing wrong with driver or hardware or anything. Just vista + intel = stupid. The forum was http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html;jsessionid=88F7ED8ED983C57E193885AE8CD10C02.app03_04?topicId=254595484&sid=1 if anyone wants to read up on it more. So yay happy ending. My video driver is now up-to-date. Thanks for your effort and patience Rob.

I know the issue, the usual cure and have never had to go to that extreme (yet.) Thanks for keeping at it and sharing what you found. I value such feedback since &quot;now I know&quot; and will do better next time around thanks to you! Bob
