1.3.1	The link is for the Logitech QuickCam Fusion .	St
1.3.2	It got a 7.6/5.7 from CNET 's editors/users and 4 out of 5 eggs from Newegg users .	St
1.3.3	Currently it costs about $ 80 and has a $ 40 rebate .	St
1.3.4	Sorry the link did not work for you .	St
1.3.5	For whatever reason it still works for me though .	St
1.3.6	I will definitely try to be more courteous when posting links in the future .	Sug
1.3.7	That 's a pretty bold statement regarding webcams in bad lighting .	St
1.3.8	I will primarily be using the camera at night when lighting is less than optimal since the people I will speak to are literally halfway around the globe .	St
1.3.9	Needless to say this will be a big issue for me .	St
1.3.10	How much should I be expecting to pay and what should I make sure that I get for my money ?	Ques
1.4.1	All you need to do is watch other 's uploads to youtube to see that many do n't understand lighting .	St
1.4.2	Your model is too similar to other webcams I own .	St
1.4.3	To get good results I have to add more light to the room than what you would suspect .	St
1.4.4	A pair of 100 Watt lights in addition to the normal room lighting worked for me .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	2 100watt light bulbs ?	Ques
1.5.2	Wow !	St
1.5.3	Hope the bulk of your video conferencing is not at night !	St
1.5.4	What would be considered different ?	Ques
1.5.5	I 'm reading lots of reviews and the majority of the complaints come from models that are incompatible or have problematic software or drivers .	St
1.6.1	Notice how much light he pours into it .	St
1.6.2	http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=OePFgmyvnWo I wonder if you 've done this before .	St
1.6.3	Those that pan lighting tips usually have n't been at this long .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Since this would be the first webcam I 'm getting obviously I have n't any experience with them .	St
1.7.2	I 'm not panning your lighting tips though .	St
1.7.3	Sorry if you got that impression .	St
1.7.4	What I was getting at though , was you said that the camera I saw was no different from the ones you owned .	St
1.7.5	So I 'm asking , what would be different ?	Ques

1.8.2	That was a fascinating video .	St
1.8.3	Thanks again for sharing .	St
1.8.4	I 'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however .	St
1.8.5	I 'd just like to use it for video IM , so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid , I do n't think I 'd mind .	St
1.8.6	I do appreciate your responses though .	Polite
1.9.1	The basics apply to getting good video .	St
