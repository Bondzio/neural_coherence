1.1.1	Umm , where should I put the sub woofer for my 2.1 speakers for my computer ?	Ques
1.1.2	Also what are some good brands for dvd burners , lcd monitors , and should I go with a modular power supply or just an regular power supply ?	Ques
1.1.3	( I 've heard some bad things about modular power supplies )	St
1.2.1	sure you get a good name brand which would probably not include PSUs by ULTRA .	St
1.2.2	Re CD-DVD ... for the latest check with some of the CD-DVD review sites .	St
1.2.3	Then read some of the user comments at Newegg.com on the units you 're most interested in .	St
1.2.4	That 's it for now .	St
1.2.5	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	From a previous post of mine - ''In a nutshell - front of the room , near ( but not in ! )	St
1.3.2	a corner or wall .	St
1.3.3	''Not-so-nutshell - if you have enough cable , place the sub where you would [ be sitting when ] listening .	St
1.3.4	Play something with at least somewhat musical bass .	St
1.3.5	Walk around near the front of the room slowly , listening to the changes in the quality of the bass - bass frequencies/waves are long , as such very dependant on room shape , size and location within that space- it 'll sound different at point A than it will at point B , even if they 're only a foot apart .	St
1.3.6	So , on your walkabout , you 'll find a place where it sounds best - good oomph , but not too bloated and boomy - that 's where you want to put the sub .	St
1.3.7	Again , pay particular attention to the areas to the front of the room , near a corner or wall , but never up against one .	St
1.3.8	Also , never put a sub at the halfway point between opposite walls - the waves will reflect and tend cancel each other out .	St
1.3.9	After you get the sub placed , fiddle with the sub volume 'til it matches what 's coming out of the L & R speakers ( the z-2300 has a bass volume knob in addition to the master volume on the wired control ) .	St
1.3.10	If you REALLY want to get the most out of them ( hehhehheh ) go to RadioShack and get a $ 30 Sound Pressure Level ( SPL ) meter and a test disc and balance along the frequency range to your heart 's content ! ''	St
1.4.1	I got an Ultra Power supply .	St
1.4.2	Oh well , I guess I 'll try selling it or something .	St
1.4.3	I was wondering about the power supply because I 've heard a lot of bad things about modular power supplies ( especially ones from Ultra ) .	St
1.4.4	Hmm , I 'm thinking about getting an Enermax Power Supply .	St
1.4.5	Got any other recommended brands ?	Ques
1.5.1	All I can suggest is do some reading ... PCPowerandCooling.com is the best ( and expesnive ) and then there 's Seasonic , Antec , Enermax , Fortron , Sparkle Power , OCZ , etc. , It 's a core component so it does n't pay to skimp .	St
1.5.2	Tomshardware.com has some good reading on PSUs .	St
1.5.3	Once you focus on some you like ... check the buyer comments reviews at places like Newegg .	St
1.5.4	When you 're ready to buy and want some feedback..post your choices here for comment ... you know most ca n't resist .	St
1.5.5	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	If you 're going to go with a modular PSU , OCZ makes a nice one .	St
1.6.2	I have n't used it , but it 's come very highly recommended from members on my folding team , and I 'll probably throw one in to my next build .	St
1.7.1	Umm , I 'm not planning to buy a modular power supply since I 've heard some bad things about it .	St
1.7.2	My choices are Ocz Powerstream 520 watts ( This is the one I 'm thinking about getting ) http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817711002 Enermax Whisper II 535 watts http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817103512 SPARKLE FSP550PLG 550 watts http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817103517 SILVERSTONE Zeus SST-ST52F 520 watts http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817163107 Antec TruePower 2.0 TP2-550 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817103932 Umm , the reason I bought my ULTRA power supply was because it part of the package .	St
1.7.3	I thought it would be a good deal since the power supply and the case costs $ 100 each but they were selling the package for $ 130 .	St
1.7.4	I also looked up some reviews about the power supply and they all liked it .	St
1.7.5	But umm , if you guys have some other recommended power supplies for me I 'll gladly listen to them .	St
1.7.6	I 'm looking for a power supply that is under $ 150 .	St
1.7.7	I 'm gon na run an amd athlon x2 , sli ( I 'm not going to run sli right away , not until I have the money ) , 1 gig ram , and a m2n32 sli wireless motherboard .	St
1.8.1	looks way better than most to me .	St
1.8.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817341002 I read all or almost all the reviews for the links you posted ... . many showed DOAs and failure rates that literally scared me and many seem to lack sufficient power to support some of the more power hungry Sli video cards .	St
1.8.3	Unless $ $ is no object I 'd look a little further and repost .	St
1.8.4	So you can bump up to the one I suggested or make sure the PSU you select will support the Sli cards you get .	St
1.8.5	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	Thanks a lot .	St
1.9.2	But umm , the ultra I looked at had really good reviews too .	St
1.9.3	I mean how do you know which one to pick ?	Ques
1.9.4	But yeah , my limit is at $ 150 ( Although , I 'm still willing to spend a few bucks more ) .	St
1.9.5	Hmm .	St
1.9.6	Well , I guess I 'll pick an ocz power supply but do you think it would still be good if I got an Gamexstream 600 watts instead ?	Ques
1.9.7	I sort of have a budget .	St
1.9.8	I mean the GamerXstream is the same you provided below but just 100 watts less .	St
1.9.9	I do n't really plan to overclock anything .	St
1.9.10	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.9.11	Btw , can you help me look for a Ide dvd burner ?	Ques
1.9.12	I would like a fast , reliable dvd burner/player that is under $ 50 .	St
1.10.1	If you have a cabinet around you , drawer , etc & you want BIG BOOMING bass , put the subwoofer in the cabinet , drawer , etc .	St
1.10.2	it will resonate the entire container ... REALLY amplifies the UPH of any subwoofer , so long as you dont get any rattles .	St
1.10.3	thats what i did .	St
1.10.4	also , windows XP comes w/ a lil known program that you can access through the control panel ( cant remember the name ) but its a blue icon w/ a yellow cirle on it .	St
1.10.5	check it out , it allows you to turn your standard output/line-in/mic plugs into a full surround sound system sub & all check it out .	Sug
1.10.6	this is all stuff that i have done & i have a humongous 29 speaker surround sound setup connected to my computer	St
1.11.1	of all people & quot ; Corsair & quot ; ... ..modular too .	St
1.11.2	Looks appealing ... only problem it ; s so new you may not be able to find in the market yet .	St
1.11.3	Another good site ... http : //www.jonnyguru.com/	Polite
1.12.1	But I 'm not a real fan of bass so where else should I out it ?	Ques
1.13.1	Ok well , I 've decided on buying the OCZ Gamexstream Powersupply .	St
1.13.2	Btw , do you know any good brands for Lcd Monitors and dvd drives ?	Ques
