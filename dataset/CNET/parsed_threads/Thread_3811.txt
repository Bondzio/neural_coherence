<s> Hey everyone. </s>
<s> My Linksys wireless router is giving me a headache. </s>
<s> The internet (through Verizon) is connected to the Westell modem. </s>
<s> An Ethernet connects the modem's Ethernet port to the Linksys router's internet port. </s>
<s> Port 1 is connected to a desktop computer which works perfectly. </s>
<s> Laptop 1 connects to the router and internet automatically and quickly, then stays connected to the internet. </s>
<s> Works perfectly. </s>
<s> Laptop 2 manually connects to the router occasionally, the internet rarely, and disconnects after ten minutes. </s>
<s> ____________________________________________________ Now I know enough to post specs. </s>
<s> If there are any more you need, please ask. </s>
<s> Modem: Westell Router: Linksys, Wireless-8 Broadband Router with 4-Port Switch, BEFW11S4 ver. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Laptop 1: Acer Aspire 5920, Windows Vista Home Premium, 32-bit. </s>
<s> It is my Mom's computer and has not had many things done with it. </s>
<s> She doesn't touch advanced settings. </s>
<s> Laptop 2: Acer Aspire 5610, Windows Vista Home Premium, 64-bit. </s>
<s> This is my computer, which I have tweaked. </s>
<s> ____________________________________________________ I know both laptops are connected to the same router name, and it is unsecured so there is no password to get wrong. </s>
<s> When I can't connect Laptop 2 to the router, I click diagnose. </s>
<s> It tells me that a time-out occurred due to user action. </s>
<s> Anything that anyone can think of is appreciated! </s>
<s> If not, do so. </s>
<s> It took me a while to find out what SSID means and to find how to check that. </s>
<s> Yes, it is enabled and broadcasting. </s>
<s> Laptop 2 is also 32-bit. </s>
<s> Sorry! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The router is not setup per our Networking forum admonishment. </s>
<s> In a,b, and c. a. Router defaults except for ISP requirements. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> Broadcast a simple SSID. </s>
<s> 8 characters and &quot;simple&quot;. </s>
<s> c. WPA for security. </s>
<s> Do not use MAC filters. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The new machine is Vista. </s>
<s> Googe the following: DISABLE VISTA BROADCAST FLAG Bob </s>
<s> Router is already set to all defaults (ISP requires none so far as I know). </s>
<s> SSID is Holly. </s>
<s> WPA is being used. </s>
<s> MAC filters are already disabled. </s>
<s> What do you mean, new machine? </s>
<s> Both are running Vista, Laptop 1 connecting and Laptop 2 not connecting. </s>
<s> I did the research looking up &quot;disable vista broadcast flag.&quot; This led me to Microsoft's Help and Support page ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928233 ). </s>
<s> I wasn't sure which (of 3 listed) were the GUID I needed to edit. </s>
<s> I added the Toggle to the first, restarted the computer and no change. </s>
<s> The second already had the Toggle created and at 1. </s>
<s> The third GUID had the Toggle set to 0, which I changed to 1 and then restarted the computer. </s>
<s> Still no connecting. </s>
<s> _____________________________________________________ Something I forgot to mention - I'm using an Ethernet cable to hook up to the router, which does work. </s>
<s> I just can't connect to the router wirelessly and stay connected. </s>
<s> I have images of the router specs (uploaded through Badongo) if you need those, but I'm not sure how I can share them with you. </s>
<s> This will likely end with the laptop being sent out for repair or replacing the router or in some cases, new router firmware. </s>
<s> To test the laptop I take it to other wifi hotspots. </s>
<s> If those fail, I know to call its maker. </s>
<s> Be sure it's loaded up just like it came from the factory without changes to firewalls or such because they will have you do that. </s>
<s> Nothing in your posts suggests it's your router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It works well with other wi-fi connections. </s>
<s> Before here, I had my own router and modem that worked. </s>
<s> It was a different model linksys with a different ISP. </s>
<s> That just makes this all the more confusing. </s>
<s> It's not worth it for me to send the my lappy in to get fixed. </s>
<s> Everything else works and I can still connect with an ethernet. </s>
<s> I'll default Windows Firewall settings. </s>
<s> I'll also try to default whatever other settings I can, since it seems to be this specific computer. </s>
<s> Thank you everyone for your help! </s>
<s> If it does end up working, I'll post why. </s>
<s> I gave up for a while and just used the ethernet to connect. </s>
<s> Then today I got annoyed and started with Google again. </s>
<s> It led me to http://forums.techguy.org/networking/622870-solved-laptop-cannot-connect-router.html On the second page, EGao changed the wireless channel. </s>
<s> It worked for me, too. </s>
<s> So just in case anyone else ever reads this, change the wireless channel! </s>
<s> If you don't know how - 1. </s>
<s> Connect to the router via ethernet. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Find your router's IP address and type it into the address bar of your browser. </s>
<s> My Linksys wireless router's IP address is 192.168.1.1 3. </s>
<s> Click the Wireless tab. </s>
<s> Then beside &quot;Wireless Channel,&quot; there is a drop-down menu. </s>
<s> Options are 1 (2.417 GHZ) through 11 (2.467 GHZ). </s>
<s> Select 1 and then Save Settings. </s>
<s> *NOTE: Remember the channel it was already set to in case this is not a fix for you. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Get the ethernet cable out of the port. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Try connecting wirelessly. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> If channel 1 doesn't work, then repeat steps 1-5 with channel 2, 3, 4 etc until it works. </s>
<s> It worked for me, at least for now. </s>
<s> =) </s>
<s> had similar problem with one laptop not finding my home wireless even if I change SSID name, type etc..never checked channel as it was auto.. </s>
