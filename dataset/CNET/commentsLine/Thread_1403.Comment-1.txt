my windows 2000sp4 does not have msconfig.
i finally found it in a folder (which i didn't creat,on an old hd) xparchive.
i think microsoft is doing us dirt.
the subfolder was $ntservicepackuninstall$ and in that folder i found sp1.
that was a good progam, i used to use it.
i also checked my windowsxp pro sp2.
no where on the scsi main drive or a 200gb drive which used windows 2000 until it would no longer boot.
