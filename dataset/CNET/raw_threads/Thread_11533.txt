I am experiencing a very scary problem with my main hard drive, a Maxtor Fireball 3 40GB that I bought 3 years ago. Here is what is happening. Whenever I open a file in my local drive, the disk space would decrease from its actual level (4.36 GB) to 0 GB and then it would go back to display 4.36 GB. This happens whenever I try to open a file in the drive. During this time, my cpu usage is around 30% instead of the usal 20%. Is this a hardware problem or a software problem (i.e. virus)? Thank you. I would appreciate any help.
