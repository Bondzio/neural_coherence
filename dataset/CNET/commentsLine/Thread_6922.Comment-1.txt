hi; got a 3-4 yr. old acer aspire 4738z that does the following sporatically: * refreshes web pages * changes default browser * reinstalls windows updates that it's already installed * external keyboard (internal no longer works) suddenly won't type certain keys * opens ms outlook all_the_time (close it, reopens) once (wrote about this earlier) it shut the whole computer down and wouldn't even let me into bios, let alone boot windows.
where do i begin trouble-shooting this?
tia, john
