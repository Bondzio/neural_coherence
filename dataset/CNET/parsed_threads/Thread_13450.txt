<s> I do not remember if I asked on here about this. </s>
<s> So, I'm going to see if I can get better assistance. </s>
<s> I've asked on other forums, but could not get a clear understanding/decision, etc. </s>
<s> I have a Compaq Presario S4020WM with everything the same. </s>
<s> The only thing was, I upgraded to a Gig of RAM recently. </s>
<s> At the same time of upgrading the RAM, the power supply died. </s>
<s> A man with his shop at a flea market replaced the power supply. </s>
<s> The power supply was and still is a disaster. </s>
<s> I have to leave the computer case open and keep a tower fan blowing into it, so my computer does not freeze. </s>
<s> I have people telling me that the power supply is too strong - 450w. </s>
<s> The max for this computer is 250w. </s>
<s> I have people telling me that it is not even the wattage and that it is a cheap non-brand-name power supply that does not handle the current or whatever correctly. </s>
<s> So, I need to know, what is the brand name? </s>
<s> I found a power supply that should be a match for my computer, but the price is cheap. </s>
<s> Is it a non-brand-name or what? </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=935375&CatId=1076 As for the hard drive, I am wanting to upgrade. </s>
<s> I'm still having a hard time to choose one. </s>
<s> It seem Seagate is more reliable, according to the reviews I've read. </s>
<s> Western Digital is good, if it is the lucky hard drive. </s>
<s> I recently found out that my hard drive is a Western Digital and it is about 4 years old now. </s>
<s> It runs on 24/7 and still working just great. </s>
<s> I know that the motherboard has a limit. </s>
<s> Right? </s>
<s> Of course, I can only limit the RAM to 1 Gig. </s>
<s> Well, I have people telling me that there is no limit as to how big hard drive I can get. </s>
<s> I have people telling me that there is a limit and that the system would not pick up on full hard drive space or whatever the term is. </s>
<s> I have Compaq telling me the max is 120 Gigs and then the next time told me 160 Gigs. </s>
<s> I'm torn apart over this. </s>
<s> I've looked everywhere and trying to decide. </s>
<s> Now, I just had someone telling me that I can keep my 40 Gigs hard drive and use the new one as slave. </s>
<s> Well, the new one will be much bigger than the 40, so I would like for it to be the main. </s>
<s> If I can make the 40 Gigs as slave, then how can I do that exactly? </s>
<s> The 40 has XP on it, so how do I wipe everything off clean? </s>
<s> I'm going to put XP on the bigger and newer hard drive. </s>
<s> I may or may not use the 40 as the slave. </s>
<s> Or, should I leave everything alone on the 40 and set my computer to boot up from the new drive? </s>
<s> There is so much that I want to be clear on. </s>
<s> I've had good experience on this forum. </s>
<s> Please, help me. </s>
<s> Be prepared for multiple questions, if I am still not able to understand or decide. </s>
<s> Thunder </s>
<s> I was told the hard drive need to be IDE PATA. </s>
<s> Newegg does not have this. </s>
<s> Tiger Direct does. </s>
<s> 200 Gigs http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=715427&CatId=523 250 Gigs http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2205144&CatId=134 There are some that has much higher Gigs, but it says OEM. </s>
<s> If I am correct, it does not include anything with it, so I do not know what to get. </s>
<s> Thunder </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> I'm wanting to upgrade as fast as I can, please. </s>
<s> Should I move it to another section? </s>

<s> Folks may not want to comment on this because they sense a &quot;can of worms&quot;. </s>
<s> The psu supplies as much power as the machine needs up to the limit of the psu. </s>
<s> Ex. </s>
<s> The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 250w psu&gt;works fine. </s>
<s> The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 400w psu&gt;works fine. </s>
<s> The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 600w psu&gt;works fine. </s>
<s> The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 150w psu&gt;does not work. </s>
<s> If it was me...I'd work at making the machine stable in its current config before upgrading/introducing new parts. </s>
<s> Bench time....... </s>
<s> What is &quot;can of worms&quot;? </s>
<s> Well, the machine is stable, as long the tower fan is blowing cooler air into the computer. </s>
<s> So, it is the Power Supply. </s>
<s> I'm going to get another one that manages power efficiently, because this one heating up the system. </s>
<s> When the tower fan is turned off, the computer heats up and freeze. </s>
<s> I'm going to get a Power Supply at the same time I get a Hard Drive. </s>
<s> Be graceful if someone have the patience to work with me on the issue of choosing the good brand-name Power Supply and the Hard Drive. </s>
<s> Thunder </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Since you want to press on, I will give you another suggestion. </s>
<s> The HDD you listed should be an easy fit into your computer but I would not set it up as the master, but as a slave till you see it works correctly (in most cases, you will need to set jumpers on the drive to do this). </s>
<s> Then once you have it working you can set it up as the master drive ( making it the master drive may require the original restore disks, do you have them?). </s>
<s> However, I recommend buying an external USB drive. </s>
<s> That way if replacing the PSU with what you selected does not fix the over heating problem you can at least move the drive to another XP computer easily. </s>
<s> Most external HDDs have their own power supply so it should not tax your systems lower power PSU you are planning to install. </s>
<s> The over heating problem needs to be looked into. </s>
<s> Your current fix is working but I have found that most heat problems get worse with time. </s>
<s> Here are just a few things to check into and learn about. </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> You may find you need to replace the thermal grease which allows for cooling the CPU, your computer is aging and this is one of the things that I replace to keep an older PC going. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> You may find the CPU fan and heat sink need cleaning. </s>
<s> The fan may need to be replaced, they wear out. </s>
<s> 3.) </s>
<s> There are software programs you can get that monitor temperature and fan speed, some BIOSs come with this feature built in. </s>
<s> Compaqs I own dont have it so you may have to get a program to do this. </s>
<s> All the above can be searched on within Cnets forums and reviews. </s>
<s> Try searching over heating, thermal grease, fan speed, and other keywords when you have a question. </s>
<s> I have often found good replies for just what Im looking for which saved me time from posting for info that has been done before. </s>
<s> I looked at the Compaq Presario S4020WM spec page at HPs site and I find the system to be some what dated. </s>
<s> I find older system to good for limited tasks but dont expect to be able to turn this computer into a high speed gamer or run Vista Premium. </s>
<s> For example it only has a 4x AGP slot for video card upgrading, has no SATA HDD upgrading, and only can handle 1 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> So what are you planning to use this computer for once you upgrade it? </s>
<s> Before I attempted to upgrade the RAM, everything was working fine. </s>
<s> As soon I unplugged the computer to upgrade the RAM, that is when I discovered the power supply died. </s>
<s> This replaced power supply, ever since I got this one, computer starts to heat up and freeze. </s>
<s> I use Everant program to monitor the temperature and the CPU. </s>
<s> I notice it would heat up without the tower fan blowing into computer. </s>
<s> When I keep the tower fan on, the temperature stays cool. </s>
<s> The CPU fan is working. </s>
<s> So, that is the only thing, ever since the power supply replacement, this happens. </s>
<s> I will have the CPU checked by a local computer store. </s>
<s> The other guy said that my CPU is fine and that everything is clean and working. </s>
<s> I'll have another store to check the CPU. </s>
<s> I'm going to order the hard drive I listed, hopefully Tiger Direct will friggin approve. </s>
<s> I seem to have problem ordering from there. </s>
<s> I wish Newegg have it, because I order from there easily. </s>
<s> If I have the new hard drive set up as slave and it all works fine, can I change the new hard drive to Master C on my own at home without going into the computer and switching them? </s>
<s> I am planning to be a DJ for an online radio station, so I am going to get at least 80 Gigs of songs. </s>
<s> I'm not a heavy gamer. </s>
<s> LoL A gig of RAM is enough for me. </s>
<s> Thunder </s>
<s> Someone told me to get a brand-name. </s>
<s> Is this a good one? </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=935375&CatId=1076 Thunder </s>
<s> The machine was working. </s>
<s> You upgrade the ram. </s>
<s> The psu dies&gt;hmmmm. </s>
<s> You replace the psu. </s>
<s> Now the machine overheats&gt;hmmmm. </s>
<s> You can do what you want. </s>
<s> I'd have the machine on my work bench. </s>
<s> I'd want to know why. </s>
<s> The machine should function with the cover on. </s>
<s> If it does not and you upgrade/add parts&gt;well your business. </s>
<s> Just make sure it has the correct pin/power connectors so it will plug into your motherboard. </s>
<s> No point in getting it if it won't plug into the motherboard. </s>
<s> If you have the old PSU (the original one) make sure this new one has the same connector setup or can be used with only the connectors that are needed. </s>
<s> PSU have changed in just the last few years. </s>
<s> Which makes buying harder because they are not all backwards compatible. </s>
<s> The goal of the company selling the computer (in your case Compaq)is to keep cost low and one way they do this is by using a small/weak power supply. </s>
<s> They select the power supply size by what the power consumption specs of the parts it is sold with use. </s>
<s> The computer will usually work until you upgrade with a power hungry video card, additional hard drives or maybe even just adding more RAM. </s>
<s> This is why when most people upgrade a computer, a higher wattage PSU is chosen. </s>
<s> In your case at least try and make sure it will fit connector wise. </s>
<s> Sometimes just trying things can lead to a success, good luck. </s>
<s> I just saw this post. </s>
<s> Missed it. </s>
<s> I guess the power supply was about to go out. </s>
<s> As soon I unplugged, it completely died, because it was used 24/7 for 4 years. </s>
<s> I'll post update when the new power supply and hard drive comes in. </s>
<s> Also, I want to note, I put the previous RAM sticks back in to test it with this power supply... </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> It is clearly the power supply. </s>
<s> Anyways, I'll post update soon. </s>

<s> &quot;IDE PATA&quot; is an the best of terms for the technology. </s>
<s> Unfortunately for the consumer, there is more than one name for the same technology. </s>
<s> For today's PC user there are really only two types of hard drives--PATA and SATA. </s>
<s> SCSI hard drives are still around, but they rarely, if ever, appear in today's typical desktop. </s>
<s> Some common equivalents: PATA = Parallel ATA = ATA/33, ATA/66, ATA/100, ATA/133 = Ultra ATA SATA = Serial ATA = SATA150, SATA300, SATA I, SATA II Many retailers refer to PATA hard drives as &quot;IDE&quot; hard drives. </s>
<s> The common speed on today's PATA hard drives is listed as ATA/100 or ATA/133. </s>
<s> All major retailers should still sell IDE hard drives. </s>
<s> * * * * * OEM vs. RETAIL hard drives: RETAIL Hard Drive: new HD, data cable, utility software, fancy package. </s>

<s> Should be: &quot;IDE PATA&quot; is NOT the best of terms for the technology. </s>
