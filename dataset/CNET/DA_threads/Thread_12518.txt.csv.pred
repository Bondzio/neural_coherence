1.1.1	Hello, Have an older Dell laptop.	St
1.1.2	The monitor went dark, smelled that characteristic toasted hardware smell coming from location near the power button (top, middle area) and soon after shut itself down.	St
1.1.3	When I reboot, the screen lights up and after it boots fully the screen goes dark and it shuts down again after a few minutes.	St
1.1.4	What could be the issue?	St
1.2.1	There's nothing that can be done without taking it apart and probably not much buy the user anyway.	St
1.2.2	You'll need to take it to a shop for a diagnosis and estimate.	St
1.2.3	Since you said it's an older Dell, I'd say consider it gone.	St
1.2.4	You may still be able to remove the hard drive, put that in an external enclosure and retrieve you data.	St
1.3.1	That toasted smell is really a harbringer of things to come.	St
1.3.2	The priority here is your data.	St
1.3.3	External enclosures are indeed easier to come by than opening everything up.	St
