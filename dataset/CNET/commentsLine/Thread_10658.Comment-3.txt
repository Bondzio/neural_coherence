despite all the bad rap they get, you will get a great system and as you already know, at a great price.
their tech support is definitely not top notch, but they do get the job done.
i know because that's where i oredered my system from, and i shopped for several months seeking out the best bang for the buck.
the closest price i found for the same exact components and configuration was still $1800 more than what i paid at cyberpower.
i am very happy with my system, i have used their tech support and although it took longer than i wanted to spend on the phone, they took care of me, and to be honest my system f'in rocks.
sit tight, you will be happy in the end...
