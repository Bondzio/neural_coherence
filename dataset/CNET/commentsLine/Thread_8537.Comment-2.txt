are you getting error messages related to corrupt data or bad sectors?
lots of things can cause freeze ups besides hd issues.
and, why must you get xp if you replace the drive?
that system is a bit thin on hardware resoures to run xp well.
you can still buy drives of 40 gigs readily and 20s are available.
your pc, at 5 years, will probably handle a 40 gig drive but might not use the full burst speed of it.
wd, seagate, maxtor and such are plentiful and any should work ok with your system.
as for freezing, it's fairly simple to do some basic cleaning and maintenance.
get the dust out of the fans, reseat boards and ram modules, and do the usual disk maintenance and spyware removal.
if that doesn't help, your power supply might be getting weaker.
make sure its fan and insides get a good blast of compressed air as well.
