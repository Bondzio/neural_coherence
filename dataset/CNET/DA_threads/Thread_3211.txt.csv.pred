1.1.1	Hey all , I am currently in the market for a multi-purpose monitor .	St
1.1.2	I have 2 main priorities with this purchase -- I am a graphic designer , so I need a monitor that will display color accurately when used in conjunction with my PC .	St
1.1.3	However , I am also planning to double it as a gaming HDTV of sorts by using the HDMI input with my PS3 .	St
1.1.4	Ive done a decent amount of research ( Cnet , PCMag and PCWorld reviews + User reviews on Amazon , Cnet , Newegg , etc ) into this and feel I have narrowed down my options to 4 different , potential monitors that suit my needs .	St
1.1.5	Im definitely open to other options , but these are the 4 Ive narrowed it down to : 1 )	St
1.2.1	But not one seem to have accurate color .	St
1.2.2	Even today to achieve this we need ONE MORE THING .	St
1.2.3	Let me share a link to the Pantone Huey at http : //www.amazon.com/Pantone-MEU113-huey-Pro/dp/B000OFC1YY I 'm unsure how else you could achieve accurate color .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Oh , excellent !	St
1.3.2	That looks like a great little device .	Polite
1.3.3	I 'll definitely look into it .	St
1.3.4	You make a good point about it being hard to achieve perfect color acuity .	St
1.3.5	I guess I should add that my main purposes for the monitor will be entertainment related .	St
1.3.6	I will be doing graphic work on it as well , but am most concerned about how it will perform as both an HD console gaming TV and high-def PC monitor .	St
1.3.7	I 'm currently doing PC work on a 5-6 year old old Sony SD monitor with VGA connectivity only .	St
1.3.8	Time for a major upgrade .	St
1.4.1	When I look at games and such I 'll want to avoid smearing so let 's use a little math to find out what milliseconds could be needed .	St
1.4.2	REMEMBER THAT ALL THE NUMBERS are from on to HALF WAY OFF .	St
1.4.3	So a super WHITE dot to black on your average 8 mS LCD is actually not black at 8 mS but half way there .	St
1.4.4	And in another 8 about half way again .	St
1.4.5	Another factor is the screen temperature or more accurately the room temperature .	St
1.4.6	A very cold room , say 55F will result in smears and it gets better as the display warms up .	St
1.4.7	Many makers do n't reveal at what temperature they do the tests .	St
1.4.8	It does matter .	St
1.4.9	Ok let 's see what milliseconds we need to start with a common 60 Hz display .	Sug
1.4.10	I get 16.67 mS per frame .	St
1.4.11	So 8 mS should be our goal .	St
1.4.12	Any faster and you must be a fighter pilot in his prime to spot the dot .	St
1.4.13	Hope this helps .	St
1.4.14	Bob	St
1.5.1	Awesome , thanks !	Polite
1.5.2	Well , the good news is that all 4 of the options I listed above have 2ms Response Time ( save one , which has 5ms ) .	St
1.5.3	So no matter which I choose , I 'm assuming there should be little to no ghosting/smearing at all while gaming .	St
1.5.4	But the question remains ... based on overall dollar to performance ratio , etc , which is the better option in the end ?	Ques
1.5.5	Another thing Im trying to take into account is simply how they & quot ; look & quot ; while displaying visual content .	St
1.5.6	Contrast , tones , etc -- which is something you can really only gauge in person ...	St
1.5.7	So , Im hoping someone around has actually seen or owns one or some of these monitors and can advise to buy it or against it .	St
1.6.1	http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=7Ghcewg8yjE for example .	St
1.6.2	I 'd still want to see it in person but I 've picked up a few displays and the last check point for me would be to dismiss any older CCFL models .	St
1.6.3	Go LED .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Do you have any LED recommendations ?	Ques
1.7.2	I have n't run into many pure LED display monitors on the market that were n't ridiculously expensive .	St
1.8.1	The technology is being tough here .	St
1.8.2	LED LCD today means LED backlight to the LCD screen .	St
1.8.3	CCFL ( see google ) is a bit dated and I 'd pass on those .	St
1.8.4	You listed the Samsung LED LCD and you can find youtube reviews to see what others say .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	Personally I will suggest CRT monitor if colors are important to you .	St
1.9.2	IMO CRT is still the best when dealing with graphics .	St
