While taking the course I noted the MAC monitors in school have much better resolution and color separation than the 20 monitor that came w/ my pc. I dont want to buy a MAC so I figured I could upgrade my screen and then buy a spyder to calibrate it. I am looking for a good 24 to 27 unit that is not in the nosebleed price range (over 1500$) The specs on the machine are; 2.4 GHz quad core w/ 3 gigs of memory and an Nvidia Geforce 8600 GT card. The machine has no problem handling Photoshop CS4 Any help can get w/ this decision would be great. Thanks, Apple 25

Just go get the best you cab afford. Or maybe one with led backlited one. It is soppose to give better contrast ratio (but I don't how important that is to your work). Also maybe a better video card might help as well (just guessing here).

PC Connection has a nice search engine and an endless selection of monitors with a variety of specs. Are you looking for a high-gloss or matte finish LCD ? VAPCMD

I really like the 24 in LCD with the matte finish but really struggle with the gloss finish LCD on the laptop as it seems to reflect almost anything from anywhere. I'm talking about matching the general monitor specs... dot pitch, viewing angle, contrast, color depth, etc., as the starting point to find LCDs that match MAC LCD specs. Like you ...I can't fathom there aren't LCDs made by mfgs that aren't as good or better than those made by Apple. Pink polka dots on the frame ? .... think I'd find those distracting too. Good luck and let us know what you decide on. VAPCMD

I started to look around on camera web sites and it seems the industry standard is LaCie, Eizo or Nec. they all make models w/ caliberation software but they are all very pricey. I don't think I'll be buying a 30&quot; any time soon unless I hit the lottery. I live 20 min north of nyc and they have one of the largest camera shops in the world there. I'm going to call them next week to see if they have any of the units set up for a look see. I'll keep you up to speed on my selection.

They look great for the moment but for day after day long term use ... I'll take the non-glare matte (non-glare) finish anytime. Re visiting retailers in NYC....great idea. No better way than first hand to find what pleases you. Places like Best Buy, MicroCenter also have monitors on display you can see before buying. We'll look forward to seeing your findings and observations. VAPCMD
