hi, i have an hp a1600n computer with 2gb ram (upgraded +1gb) and an athlon x2 3800+ 2.0 ghz processor.
i use the computer for video editing and gaming.
i'd like to get a faster processor, but i had some questions.
i'm looking to spend under or around $200.
since i'm already using an amd processor, will an intel one not work with my computer?
what processor would be best for video editing?
will single core be just as good as dual, becauase i'm not multitasking?
thanks so much for the help!
