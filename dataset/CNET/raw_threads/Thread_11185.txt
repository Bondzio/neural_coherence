There are RAM kits with matching DDR or DDR2 DIMMs for use in systems with motherboards featuring the dual channel memory architecture. It's just DDR or DDR2.

Looks cool, but airflow is poor with the front panel closed - there are only 8 narrow slots in the panel to draw air through. I've since modded and added a 120mm case fan to the door, which helped tremendously, but airflow still could be better. Also, a removable mobo tray would be nice - it will be a requirement on my next case. HD - the SE16 (16mb cache) version is available for not much more. Floppy - my man! Always good to see someone adding a floppy to a new build! I have a Mitsumi that I love - it has a 7-in-1 USB 2.0 media card reader built in - saves space and is very handy. PSU - I have an TP2 550 EPS12V and I've been happy with it, but I'm now in the minority among my peers - they've had a ton of bad luck with Antec PSUs lately. PC Power & Cooling or SeaSonic PSUs are universally loved.
