when the pc first boots BIOS and shows hardware inventory; which means u may have to disable &quot;quiet boot&quot; in BIOS, also &quot;report all errors&quot; or &quot;check for floppy at boot&quot; so u get an error message if floppy isn't detected.
It also will power up the little LED on the floppy briefly in test.
Once in a while, I have to unplug the floppy and power cable and replug them because floppy wasn't found.
As said, get a cheap used floppy drive for quick replacement test and keep for backup.
