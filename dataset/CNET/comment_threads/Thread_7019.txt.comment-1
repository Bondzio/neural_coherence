Hey there, I'm hoping someone can help me out with a decision on a purchase I'm making for a new system.
Where I'm stuck is in deciding between a single 150Gb 10,000rpm SATA150 drive, and 4 7200rpm SATA 3Gb/s drives in a RAID10 array.
I know that the RAID10 will give me added security due to its data redundancy, but am unsure of how performance will compare to the single 10krpm drive.
Basically, if I'm looking at a dramatic performance hit with the RAID configuration, I'd be willing to sacrifice security.
FWIW, I'm going to be using this in a Dual Xeon Quad-core 3D graphics/video editing machine.
Thanks for any and all recommendations!
