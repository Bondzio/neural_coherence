boot from the windows operating system cd or dvd at start up install one operating system to one hard drive shut down the computer then do the same thing for the other operating system that's what works for me and you don't need any other software because windows vista has a built in boot manager that will launch when the system detects multiple operating systems and the system wont boot until you have selected an operating system
