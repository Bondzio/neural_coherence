however, as for the pairing, its a no brainer.
i have gigabit throughout the network.
everything is on and perfect.
am running full duplex and no problems.
even with my current hookup bypassing the wall jack and going to a switch and then to the computer, it is full duplex and green all the way.
this is why it is so confusing.
i can terminate right at the wall jack without the jack, once the jack is hooked up, it goes dead.
i have tried 4 different wall jacks with no luck.
the funny part is that if i put a coupler on the end in place of the wall jack, it won't work, so i figured it was the wiring.
that only makes sense.
but i reran another wire and the same results.
i am with you about the wiring, i still believe it is that, however i cannot seem to find it anywhere.
i also had another person take a look and he gave up.
i have been through several wall jacks, 4 couplers, my own cables, store bought cables.
my pair testing is right on, my resistance testing is perfect.
other then running a third wire from the last run, that is the best i can come up with.
the only other thought is that something is interfering with the last leg of the run.
i am not sure but maybe some wiring in the walls or ceiling that i didn't catch.
