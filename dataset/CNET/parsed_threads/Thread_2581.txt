<s> Windows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) will do it. </s>
<s> Just run the Windows Network Setup wizard. </s>
<s> HOWEVER... </s>
<s> I highly recommend purchasing a broadband router. </s>
<s> It adds an extra layer of security (firewall, filtering, etc.) </s>
<s> between your computers and the DSL modem. </s>
<s> Also, a router will allow your laptop to use the DSL Internet connection without having to turn on your desktop, as ICS requires. </s>
<s> I recommend purchasing a wireless-G broadband router. </s>
<s> Most allow you to make 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time. </s>
<s> Just the info i needed. </s>
