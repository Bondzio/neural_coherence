1.1.1	I have built a new PC - P4 2.6 ( 800 ) , Asus P4P800 Mobo , Asus 128Mb Fx5600 , 512Mb DDR400 , Maxtor 120Gb 7200 HD , Sony 16x DVD , Asus 5224 CDRW .	St
1.1.2	It runs a lot slower than expected.Norton Speed Disc ( defrag ) has been running for nearly 24 hours and has still not completed - a task that usually takes several hours.When i try to install a game it is extremely slow to install when using the CDRW ( although the drive works fine when burning etc ) but is fine when installed from the DVD.The whole PC just seems far slower than it should be - its works but just so slow.The motherboard accepts dual channel RAM but normal DDR is installed.Would upgrading the RAM to dual channel help - could anything be set wrong in the bios that is slowing it down ?	Ques
1.1.3	- could the hard drive be the cause ? Any advice - really appreciated	Ques
1.2.1	What OS are you using ?	Ques
1.2.2	Do you have the latest updates from Microsoft ?	Ques
1.2.3	Is DMA enabled ?	Ques
1.2.4	Try Bob Proffitt 's security suite at : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html ? forumID=32 & threadID=1313 & start=0 Try running the tests at : http : //www.pcpitstop.com/default.asp Ken	St
1.3.1	O/s is Xp Pro Sp1 - all up to date , DMA is enabled.Just remembered this - after installing a game the other day the auto detect in the config said that the CPU was not fast enough - 2.6 p4 ?	Ques
1.4.1	It may be in PIO mode even if you LOOK at it !	St
1.4.2	PERFORM the procedure at http : //www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/tech/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx and do n't come back until you 've done this .	St
1.4.3	It 's safe , easy and has cured a few .	St

1.5.1	Is your cpu fan/heatsink working properly ?	Ques
1.5.2	Sometimes the HS will get clogged with dust and and cause the cpu to overheat .	St
1.5.3	Look in Task manager to see what cpu usage you have with no apps running .	St
1.5.4	Could be something using up all your cpu cycles .	St

1.6.1	OK - i have followed the procedure detailed at microsoft site.No improvement , not a thing.CPU usage is not high - i 'm at a loss to know what it is.Anything else i could try ?	Ques
1.7.1	Faulty boards , outdated BIOS , too much diddling with settings , trying old IDE 40 conductor cables , failing drives , drives fdisked on another machine , drives with odd custom partitions , tunafish in the power supply , WORMS , Nachi Worms , MS-Blaster Worms , Kazaa , iMesh , P2P programs in general , trojans , spyware , malware , badware and the list goes on for a very long time .	St
1.7.2	The clues you supply can narrow it down .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	My Mistake - DMA is not enabled - i have followed the procedure but i can not get it to change from PIO - i have checked for problems at various forums and it appears that the Asus P4P800 does have problems with DMA - unfortunatley i have not found a soultion - Is there any other way i can enable DMA ?	Ques
1.9.1	It 's time to pester the board supplier about this .	St
1.9.2	But let me share that in your post , far too many details were left out .	St
1.9.3	No long dissertations are required , but any number of items like using some odd 40 conductor cable , an odd driver here or there could do it in .	St
1.9.4	Or some outdated BIOS or missing driver .	St
1.9.5	The supplier should be contacted since I do n't have any list of what you built or if you did something oddball like move a drive with an OS from another machine .	St
1.9.6	But at least you 've found the cause .	St
