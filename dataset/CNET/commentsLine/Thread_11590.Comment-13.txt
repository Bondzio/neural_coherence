the software available today is still not good enough to handle perfect conversion of written text or speech into a word document.
i have always tried to find a good program out there and have yet to stumble across one.
i recently purchased mac speech scribe and paid $150 for the latest version and it is still no good.
it skips words and just cant grab ahold of what i am saying, even when i do annunciate.
does anyone have any suggestions of software they know works well and doesn't run into the same problems everyone has?
i feel like i would have known by now if there was, but if anyone has suggestions, please share.
