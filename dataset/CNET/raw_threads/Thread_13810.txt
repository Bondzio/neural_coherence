She installed an knew inkjet cartridge in her Lexmark Inkjet print and it will not print. I had her check to insure that the plastic cover was off. Went through the cleaning drill. Updated the drivers and lastly ran out of ideas. (Weirdly it print then went back to the error message &quot;cartridge empty&quot;-not exact message, forgot what it she said it was.) Anybody have any over ideas, thank you.
