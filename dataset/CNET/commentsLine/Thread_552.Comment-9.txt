that is the general idea with any print server.
if you can connect a print server to a router, then any printer you connect to the print server will be available for any computer that is also connected to the router.
the router doesn't care how you connect a print server to it--you can use a network cable or a wireless signal.
the wireless signal performs the same function as a network cable.
wired print server: wireless router --- print server --- printer wireless print server: wireless router ~ ~ ~ wireless print server --- printer key: --- network cable ~ ~ ~ wireless signal there are two ways to use a wireless print server.
infrastructure mode connects the wireless print server to the wireless router via wireless signal.
ad-hoc mode connects the wireless print server directly to the wireless network adapter of a computer (also via wireless signal).
you can set it up either way.
infrastructure mode is represented in the above diagrams.
