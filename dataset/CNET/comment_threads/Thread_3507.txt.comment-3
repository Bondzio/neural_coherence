your hard drive will probably slow down to match the dma (or even worse, pio) level of the optical drive.
and reading/writing from/to both simultaneously will be even slower than normal.
suggest you convert your hd to sata ( http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CX-ITS1002&cat=CCD ) or get a pci ide controller for your optical drive ( http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CX-VT6410&cat=CCD ).
both are less than $10.
