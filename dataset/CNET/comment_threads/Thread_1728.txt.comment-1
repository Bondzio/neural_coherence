OK, I originally got the error 0x0000009C(0x0000004,0x80545FF0,0B2000000,0x00070F0F) and researched that error.
I changed out the ram from 1Gig to 512Megs, and it seems to run good for basic stuff like web browsing.
However if I try to start up a game it either crashes or gives me a bunch of color on the screen.
I started up both Sim City 4 and the original Neverwinter Nights.
The machine is has an Athlon 64, GeForce 6600GT, 200GB SATA HD, on a ASROCK motherboard.
Any help at this point would be greatly appreciated.
