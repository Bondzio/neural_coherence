If you're going to buy a 32 bit OS (like Windows Vista) there's no need to have more that 4 Gb RAM, because any more isn't being used at all. It's just sitting there. Only a 64 bit OS (like Windows Vista 64 bit) can use more than 4 Gb. But support with drivers and games for 64 bit OS'es is a little bit lacking, so I doubt if that's a good move. Kees

12259	13	322856	2960328	2960249	ramarc	1/23/09 7:07 AM	1.23269442E12	what connectors are you using	did your card come with a double molex to 8pin plug? does your power supply have a real pci-e 8pin plug? (some 8pin plugs aren't designed for pci-e usage.) which plug are you using? if you're using the molex adapter then use molex plugs on two power supply leads (instead of two plugs on one lead). if that fails, then you should get a new sli certified powersupply in the 700w range.

The saphire hd4870x2 is pretty much the king of the hill in gpu`s now. Another fellow techy here on cnet is building a pc, but with the q9550 cpu. I suggested he go to the core i7 920 with mobo. I believe that it`s a bit better for future proofing. Not to mention overclocking and performance. I`ve been researching fo a while here and looking at the specs I think you should up the psu. 650w is the minimum for this gpu, but it`s better to heve a good bit of headroom so the psu is never stressed. Which can hurt your performance or worse. I would realy like to here from you when your done. Then I can compare your build to the other cnet member. Have fun and good luck.

I am going to build myself a gaming PC in the 1500 dollar area and, seeing as how I'm a newb at this stuff, I was looking for some critiques and recommendations from some hardcore techies. The rig I am currently considering is this: EVGA 01G-P3-N891-RX GeForce 9800 GX2 1GB (512MB per GPU) 512-bit (256-bit per GPU) GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI Supported Video Card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130402 XFX MBN790IUL9 LGA 775 NVIDIA nForce 790i Ultra SLI ATX Intel Motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813141009 Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 Yorkfield 2.83GHz 12MB L2 Cache LGA 775 95W Quad-Core Processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115041 COOLER MASTER RC-690-KKN1-GP Black SECC/ ABS ATX Mid Tower Computer Case http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119137 COOLER MASTER UCP RS700-AAAAA3 700W ATX12V / EPS12V SLI Certified CrossFire Ready 80 PLUS SILVER Certified Power Supply http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817171032 Western Digital Caviar Black WD1001FALS 1TB 7200 RPM 32MB Cache SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136284 2 x mushkin 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333 (PC3 10666) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory (equaling 8gb total) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146748 Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit edition and a cheapo functional optical drive. I was looking for some recommendations as far as bang for my buck alternatives either hardware or retailer, and compatability issues. I saw it posted that the video card memory can consume some of the memory cap. Is this true, because if so I would go for a 6bg memory setup since I intend on getting another of the same video card in the future and running them in SLI mode. Finally, would there be a power supply issue if I were to attempt running two of these video cards in SLI?

In the specs that matter, such as data transfer, the baracuda wins. I installed one in my blackbird and I`m happy with it. Also; I use dual 9800gts` in sli mode. The graphics in Crysis are great. Even on my 32&quot; monitor. However, after reading about ATI`s radeon saphire series, I`m really thinking of going for these bad boys. But for the price, its hard to beat dual 9800gts.
