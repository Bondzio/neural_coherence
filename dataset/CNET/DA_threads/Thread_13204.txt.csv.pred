1.1.1	Not sure if my power supply just over heated .	St
1.1.2	I was on world of warcraft and all of a sudden my computer immediately shut down .	St
1.1.3	I tried turning it back on but when I hit the power button , only the fans would turn on for half a second .	St
1.1.4	I tried blowing the dust out with an air compresser but that did nothing .	St
1.1.5	I have tried a new power cord and a different outlet but nothing seemed to make a difference .	St
1.1.6	The fans will turn on for .5-2 seconds then shut down again .	St
1.1.7	Later I the computer turned itself on and the fans were running for a few seconds then I heard a pop and I could smell something burning .	St
1.1.8	So I pulled the power out and have n't touched it since .	St
1.1.9	My specs are as follows : 420 watt ps msi k8n neo2 platinum mobo geforce 6800gt 512x2 mushkin black pc 3200 ram AMD 64 3000+ 200 gb hard drive I 'm worried that my powersupply may have over heated , I only have 2 case fans that were stock with the case .	St
1.1.10	Anyone have any ideas on whats happening ?	Ques
1.1.11	Oh and Hello All !	St
1.2.1	If you 're comfortable doing so , get a flashlight and take a look .	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Took the power supply apart and on the circuit board I found a burnt dyote ( sp ? ) .	St
1.3.2	I turned the power supply on and it started smoking in that area .	St
1.3.3	That piece on the circiut I guess directions current into one direction only .	St
1.3.4	So hopefully it did n't damage other pieces .	St
1.3.5	There is only one other part that seemed like it got burnt a little from the dyote , but it seems to be fine .	St
1.3.6	This part will probably only cost me 2 dollars at radio shack , so hopefully it will solve the problem .	St
1.4.1	I 'd play it safe and just get a new and BIGGER PSU .	St
1.4.2	Consider that your current PSU was likely overtaxed and this will happen again ... or worse .	St
1.4.3	I 'm thinking of 550W or larger .	St
1.5.1	In power supplies all too often more than one componet can be at fault .	St
1.5.2	Thus a whole circuit is comprised even if the obivous is found .	St
1.5.3	Alot can happen as you found a bad & quot ; diode & quot ; , that 's not always good to fix and return as the psu is & quot ; weaken & quot ; and could easily blow again .	St
1.5.4	I suggest , just replace the psu and make it a higher wattage one .	Sug
1.5.5	This is the best advise I can pass on as a decent psu of at least 500W+ even if generic or a known namebrand of 400W+ ( more than 420W ) is goint to be needed .	St
1.5.6	Unless you stress test the psu , then repair for best results , but rememeber when you return it to the system all those componets/devices dempendant upon it have already suffered one blow-out , can they another ?	Ques
1.5.7	Plus , keep an eye on it if problem crop-up soon enough ( 30-days or less ) .	St
1.5.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Why risk everything to save 70 $ for new one that will last for ever ?	Ques
1.7.1	Might be a zener that provides one of the regulated voltages .	St
1.7.2	Either way the diode is likey a secondary failure due to the origina failure causing too much current or voltage to or through the diode .	St
1.7.3	A popping noise fairly loud is usually a Capacitor .	St
1.7.4	Have you looked to see if there are any blown caps ?	Ques
1.7.5	?	Ques
1.8.1	Remember your own advice and next time your car motor conks out , buy a new one .	St
1.8.2	This is logical t/s'ing at least swap out the psu .	St
1.8.3	Of course if you can afford it buy a new system .	St
1.8.4	I think alot of users ca n't do that .	St
1.8.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	In most cars when the motor conks out and needs replacement , it is cheaper to buy a new car than to replace the motor .	St
1.9.2	If you can jerry rig it to work for a while , when it breaks down again the car most likely wo n't explode .	St
1.9.3	It will simply need more motor repair .	St
1.9.4	In a computer everything is very sensitive to incorrect voltages and amperage .	St
1.9.5	An incorrect soldering in the PSU can cuase a short .	St
1.9.6	I have seen a fualty psu kill a mobo , proc , videocard and all the HDDs at once .	St
1.9.7	In this case , a new PSU is usually 1/10th the cast of the rest or less .	St
1.9.8	Put it in prospective .	St
1.9.9	That is a tiny cost .	St
1.10.1	In my orginal post , I did mention & quot ; stress test & quot ; in order to prove the psu is working and in order .	St
1.10.2	This is done by a capable person in order to lessen any failure with the real system .	St
1.10.3	If a person is willing to repair , then hopefully they 're capable of following what 's needed .	St
1.10.4	if not they pay the conseqences , good or bad .	St
1.10.5	I still stand by my & quot ; motor & quot ; example .	St
1.10.6	If a person is willing to repair a diode then I 'm sure they 're willing to replace some broken motor part or replace ( in theory ) to get things going .	St
1.10.7	But heck , if I have a fat wallet I 'll let others do it .	St
1.10.8	Better yet , why visit this forum or any other for advice when & quot ; buying new & quot ; will pretty much fix the problem .	St
1.10.9	Not everyone has unlimited funds .	St
1.10.10	ayyy !	St
1.10.11	-- -- -Willy	St
1.11.1	I dont have unlimited funds .	St
1.11.2	But if it blew in the first place was it really adequate for his needs ?	Ques
