Problem with custom builts is lack of support or warranty. Your best bet may be to part it out. Forget the CRT, too expensive to ship, better to sell locally or better yet to a friend or relative.

I had a friend that hers zapped by a local lightning strike. Getting a decent replacement [non Micro ATX] is virtually impossible. Now that the Conroe Core and others came out, it's amazing how little the older ones are worth. Extremely valuable to the present owner and the darned think will probably run great for ten more years, BUT.
