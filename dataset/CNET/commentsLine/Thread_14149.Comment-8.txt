in my case - a stock hp media pc m7248n with a msi ms-7184 amethystm micro atx motherboard.
the power in the house went down, so the box took a hard powerhit.
after the power came back, the same old sata root drive that came with the box was undetectable.
looking at it on another box - the disk is fine - that leaves the motherboard.
same situation... stock bios, no hardware changes - no intervening msft updates..... box was working - box takes powerhit - box not working.
i conclude bios has nothing to do with it.
i was never totally thrilled with this pc.
when i first got the box, minor physical shock would cause the system to hang.
i reseated all the memory chips and the problem went away.
maybe i'll try punching in the disk parameters manually, but bios just doesn't see it.
