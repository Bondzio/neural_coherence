My OS is Windows XP, SP2. The problem I'm facing, is my computer is not recognizing the hardware for my router. It doesn't have a signal at all. The problems aren't all consistent, because occasionally some things work, but it seems to be getting worse. When the computer restarts, if it is able to connect to the router and get online, it will give a &quot;Serious error message.&quot; Any advice on these problems would be appreciated.

Scan the machine with Free AVG Spyware, eject what it finds but first download WINSOCKFIXXP since some pests trash the Winsock when you remove them. Given no machine details my only other idea is to change the WIFI channel to 1 5 or 11. Bob
