It has an Asrock P4vm800 motherboard. When I did a scan at crucial.com, it told me that it was an Asus P4v800-x for some reason. So I am wondering how do I get the sound to work, and can this motherboard with it's current video and XP Pro support dual monitors? thank you

They seem to have drivers listed for download, but it said something about contacting tech support first to make sure they are correct or something.
