1.1.1	Hi , I have an internet connection ( landline and wifi modem ) at my parent 's summerhouse as I need it for work .	St
1.1.2	Nobody else does around here so I get constant nagging from neighbours to give them the password .	St
1.1.3	I ca n't say no however I 'm afraid they may use up too much of my bandwith connection which could lead to alot of money being lost from my part .	St
1.1.4	Constant and stable internet is a must for my work .	St
1.1.5	Hence my question - how can I limit the bandwith I give to them ?	Ques
1.1.6	Can I create a second public network with limited bandwith or something like that ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks in advance !	St
1.2.1	And given they could download junk that gets you into trouble the answer must be no .	St
1.2.2	Given you 'd have to replace the router or create one from a Linux box , it 's just not worth it to most folk and again it 's back to just say no and then change the router to channel 14 ( I will deny I wrote this ) and then set your wifi to Europe settings and they wo n't even see the wifi router to ask you .	St

1.3.2	I am actually located in Europe .	St
1.3.3	They know I have a wifi internet connection as I sit on the porch and do work .	St
1.3.4	Saying no is also pretty much impossible as they have helped me out quite a few times .	St
1.3.5	& lt ; div & gt ; So in order to limit the bandwith I allocate to them I have to get a new router ?	Ques
1.3.6	No other easier way ?	Ques

1.5.1	Is what you are asking for .	St
1.5.2	This is not a common feature in routers but folk have put such into Linux based routers but it seems expensive to run 100 or 200 or more Watt computer to do this .	St
