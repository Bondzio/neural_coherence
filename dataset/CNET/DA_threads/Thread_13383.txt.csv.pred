1.1.1	Hello , Hoping someone can help here because I definitely ca n't afford pro data retrieval .	St
1.1.2	Have an ext .	St
1.1.3	HD I sadly dropped a while back .	St
1.1.4	Ever since , it 's been fading .	St
1.1.5	Today when I turn it on it sounds like it 's spinning louder and faster than it should .	St
1.1.6	The files appear for a few seconds and I can click through just a folder or two before it freezes and a message box says I 'need to format ' or something very close about formatting .	St
1.1.7	Have lots of files on it .	St
1.1.8	Anything I can do ?	Ques
1.1.9	I 'll gladly provide any more info that might help , and any suggestions will be tremendously appreciated .	St
1.1.10	Thanks so much !	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Get the disk out off the enclosure and see if it works in a new enclosure .	St
1.2.3	If you 're lucky : it works .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	If you are n't lucky ( which is the most likely situation ) : try the usual DIY data recovery programs from http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911.html .	St
1.2.6	This might get your data back on your internal hard drive .	St
1.2.7	3 .	St
1.2.8	If you still are n't lucky : let it do by a professional data recovery company or accept the data is lost .	St
1.2.9	Your choice .	St
1.2.10	PS .	St
1.2.11	Why do n't you have a backup copy of that data ?	Ques
1.2.12	Not making a backup means & quot ; I do n't mind to lose it & quot ; .	St
1.2.13	So why mind now ?	Ques

1.3.1	Sadly , because you dropped the ext .	St
1.3.2	HD there is very probable physical damage .	St
1.3.3	Do what Kees suggests and go at it .	St
1.3.4	However , full success is limited to the damage caused .	St
1.3.5	So , do n't expect a too happy outcome just be happy with what you can get .	St
1.3.6	Plus , continued operation and trying to access *all* files will touch everything and with physical damage produce more damage accessing everything as all areas become touched .	St
1.3.7	Once you got everything you can , see if warranty applies and use it .	St
1.3.8	FYI- As always , learn from this lesson , ext .	St
1.3.9	HDs are n't meant for permanent storage .	St
1.3.10	Critical files should be better stored on quality discs of CD/DVD/BD .	St
1.3.11	The ext .	St
1.3.12	HD should be thought of as working temporary storage .	St
1.3.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I just look at the inside of one of those thing ( my brother-in-law dropped it ) .	St
1.4.2	Good thing it was only movie videos .	St
1.4.3	I was going to swap the storage plats but after looking at how it was put together I decided it was a total loss .	St
