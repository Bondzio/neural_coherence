<s> Hi, I was in Canada for three days and routinely used the internet on roaming which approximately costs $0.015/kb. </s>
<s> I routinely can use approximately 20Mb of data per day in domestic use. </s>
<s> However, the un-billed data usage shows me usage to the tune of 151400KB and likewise totaling to approximately 300Mb over few hours spread over three days which is worth a charge of $4500. </s>
<s> Can someone help me with the answer as to how can such a data usage can occur with normal internet usage (mails and hotel bookings and wiki and NO movie or song downloads) even when I can only normally use 20-30mb of data in a full day domestic usage. </s>
<s> I am pretty sure that this cannot be my data usage. </s>
<s> Is there any problem with the device or can someone else hack and use the device. </s>
<s> Or there are any other technical errors on the part of the service provider. </s>
<s> A call to the customer service tells me that they can verify if the data originated from my device. </s>
<s> However, still I would be sure that I cannot use so much data within such a short span of time on a meager usage. </s>
<s> How should I approach this problem and what are my options. </s>
<s> Please help with the answer. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It sounds like you have little recourse other than politely admitting your usage, since they have it documented. </s>
<s> It doesn't take much to get up to 300MB these days w/ 3G/broadband. </s>
<s> Try to bargain with them to reduce the cost of the bill by offering to add an international data plan for a year if they reduce your bill. </s>
<s> I know you don't want to pay but if you go this route you'll net ahead vs forking over the entire $4500. </s>
<s> In general, I wouldn't expect much leeway if your calculations are correct as to how much you used since you knew the rate per kb prior to travelling with a laptop. </s>
<s> Best of luck. </s>

<s> I dont mind paying anything that is authentic. </s>
<s> I never have any problems with my credit history or otherwise. </s>
<s> I knew the rates and I was well aware that I was on roaming. </s>
<s> And this was not my first experience with roaming and wireless- Yes! </s>
<s> but the first time when I feel so of the undue excess. </s>
<s> What I feel though is that- there is some error (software or otherwise)- and my question lies only on the possibility of the existence of such an error on part of the service provider. </s>
<s> Data usage occurs on the kind of usage I am making. </s>
<s> 3G help me open my email faster but I presume does not increase the data usage for that respective email. </s>
<s> If I am using 20mb daily in USA and then the next day for similar usage I use 200mb in Canada.....I dont understand that. </s>
<s> I would consider that a possibility over a three day period. </s>
<s> I believe your concern is well placed. </s>
<s> I travelled out of the US to Vancouver for 36 hours. </s>
<s> Careful to make few phone calls and text messages. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, my iPhone was set to automatically check in to data network. </s>
<s> AT&T said I used 614MB of data during the 36hours and that I owe them $6140. </s>
<s> They cut my data service off this morning. </s>
<s> I have heard that there is a consumer protection law that allows a one time pass for unfamiliar use and excessive bills for wireless service. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of this? </s>
<s> Any other ideas would be helpful. </s>
