thanks nerdyboy.
i am not quite that out of it.
i had found all of that and have gone to radeon and the update downloads require service pack 2 which i have never installed.
thanks for you help.
ps i cant install service pack 2 because an idiot tried to repartition my hard drive and i lost the recovery capabilities.
just as an after thought.
should i just go ahead and bite the bullet and buy the start up disks from sony so i can straighten all this mess out.
