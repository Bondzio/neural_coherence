I first noticed this the other day when I tried to install a new program. Last time I used it (it has been several months)I didn't have a problem. When disks are inserted the drive light flashes but when I try to check the drive contents in my computer it tells me to insert a disk. I have tested the drive in &quot;safe mode&quot; - sames issues I have uninstalled the drive in Device Manager and allowed Windows XP to reinstall - same issues. The drive is recognized in device manager and it is not flagged. I can open the drive door from my computer. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get the drive working again? Thanks

There has never been one case where we would repair the 20 dollar DVDRW drives. It costs too much to repair them. Bob
