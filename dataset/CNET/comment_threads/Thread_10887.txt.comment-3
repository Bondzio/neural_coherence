Since you appear to already be paying for internet service, the obvious, easiest, and most reliable way would be to buy your own wireless router or add a WAP to your existing system.
Are you wanting to drop your ISP and tap into someone else service?
If so, that may be illegal but is also very unreliable.
I know that some communities have installed wifi that's available to subscribers at a cost that may be more attractive than some ISPs offer.
You could check into that possibility if you wish.
I don't know much about how these work but suspect they may offer less than air tight security.
