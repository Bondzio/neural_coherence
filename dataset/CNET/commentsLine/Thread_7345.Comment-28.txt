i have the same problem.
i rma'd mine and the new one is exactly the same.
speed test with old d-link router(di-604):  speed test with new d-link dir-655:  actually had a tech guy look at it and he can't explain it.
he said the router is defective.
i'm just going to send it back and go with something i can put dd-wrt on.
