Hi all Just about to purchase my first laptop and it will come with 802.11agn.
I have a desktop PC also, but plan on connecting this directly to the router and so it is just the laptop that will be wireless at the moment.
House is single storey (2000 square feet), but construction is concrete walls.
What router would you recommend and why?
Thanks
