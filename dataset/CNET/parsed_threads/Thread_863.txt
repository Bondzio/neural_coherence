<s> I saw on CNET, maybe a month ago, a new tablet/laptop that converts by having the screen pivot on two silver rail-type things on the side. </s>
<s> It can either be a tablet with the screen sitting on top of the keyboard, or the screen slides away from the keyboard to make it look more like a laptop. </s>
<s> That's a horrible description, I'm sorry. </s>
<s> I also think it was running Windows 8. </s>
<s> Anyone have any idea what that tablet was called? </s>
<s> Here's the CNET link about it. </s>
<s> http://www.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10424800-269.html It's been done before and given it's lukewarm sales and more, you probably won't see this again. </s>
<s> The next things will likely be the Windows 8 tablet with it's keyboard unit. </s>
<s> Although the big issue for most will be APPS. </s>

<s> I mean you won't be using Office or many current apps for a while. </s>

<s> This had grey/silver rails on the side that were connected to the tablet and allowed the screen to slide away and up, locking into place to be used as a screen for a keyboard. </s>
<s> But can't see the attraction given the issues with APPs and use. </s>
<s> As the Slate rolls out you can bet you'll see more models as they hope to get you to buy one. </s>
<s> Sorry but your description sounds like a fragile thing. </s>

<s> and it may not work for us, but I was intrigued. </s>
<s> And then when I couldn't find it, I was even more determined to figure out what it was called! </s>

<s> Pretty sure this is the tablet you are talking about. </s>
<s> Let us know if this is the one so we can put this question to rest :-P http://tablet-news.com/2012/08/30/ifa-2012-dell-unveils-xps-duo-12-ultrabook-with-swiveling-touchscreen/ </s>
