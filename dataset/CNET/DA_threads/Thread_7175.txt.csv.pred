1.1.1	Hello =] Ive got a microsft cordless desktop keyboard and while i know that cordless keyboards arent the best choice for gamin i was interested to know how long the battery life would last if i play around 2 -3 hrs of fps games per day... On my keyboard pack it says that most users will experience around 6 months of battery life but i realise that when playing fps games you send out a craplot more signals since your fingers are almost always pressed on 2 mor more keys (WASD kinda stuff) so i would expect the battery life to decrease... Has anybody had any experience with microsoft keyboards?	St
1.1.2	And if so care to share?	St
1.1.3	ThanksYou =]	St
1.2.1	Doesn't it also depend how big the battery is and how used up it already is?	St
1.2.2	Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop &quot;The company claims that the mouse and keyboard can last a whopping six months on just two standard, AA batteries and three months on just one battery.&quot;	St
