<s> Hey everyone! </s>
<s> LAN noobie, here. </s>
<s> I wanna host a LAN party between all of my friends, and being that I have no LAN experience, I pretty don't know much about LANning, but we're close friends, so a little embarrassment won't hurt. </s>
<s> But I do wanna know what I need for the LAN connection. </s>
<s> I know it has to be setup through the Network Wizard or whatever, but what exactly do I need cord-wise, and I need some sort of a hub, too, right? </s>
<s> Steer me in the direction as to what to look for hub-wise, because I have no idea, but if I'm correct, you just use a bunch of Ethernet cables into the hub, don't you? </s>
<s> And I am getting a HUB, not a modem, right? </s>
<s> Well, as long as you can help me with that stuff, then I'm good to go. </s>
<s> Sorry for the |\|00|3 questions, but I gotta learn sometime. </s>
<s> :P </s>
<s> is get a wireless router. </s>
<s> They can handle up to 126 connections. </s>
<s> Then all your friends need are wireless PCs. </s>
<s> Even IF you don't connect to the internet your wiring is drop dead simple. </s>
<s> optional internet-&gt;wifi router-&gt;optional switched hub-&gt; PCs. </s>
<s> It's that simple and widely documented so I'll stop here except to note it's cheap compared to just 2 years ago. </s>
