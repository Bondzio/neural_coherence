1.1.1	Apple is being very shady with there extended repair program for emac 's I have a emac that had been freezing since late fall so for two months i called then and paid for techinical support they told me to go to the store and buy new pather disks which the stores dont sell .	St
1.1.2	I described to at least 4 different tech support people my problem none told me about the extention repair problem .	St
1.1.3	Finally during christmas break i on a wiff typed in freezing emacs and came to a bunch of disscussion boards about the problem .	St
1.1.4	I called Apple and the tech guy acted like he did not know what I was talking bout I had to guide him through to the web page .	St
1.1.5	Finally he put on his supervisor and the guy got smart with me .	St
1.1.6	He told me when i asked him for a case number to take to the Apple Service Providers that I dont need one because it is public knowledge , I was like that is funny I just talked to a apple tech and he did not know what it was .	St
1.1.7	Anypoint , that is great that they are going to fix the project but dont be shady and what sucks the worse I have to wait at least 3 weeks before i get my computer back .	St
1.1.8	If Apple thinks I am going to buy a Iphone they are crazy	St
1.2.1	It is always a good idea , when talking to Tech Support ( any Tech Support ) to get a case number .	St
1.2.2	This number establishes your problem , records it with the company , and if the problem drags on and on , you have proof of when the problem first started .	St
1.2.3	Insist on a case number .	St
1.2.4	Glad they decided to fix it for you P	St
