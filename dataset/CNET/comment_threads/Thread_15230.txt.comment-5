So, if your chipset is that generation and is a recent manufacture it maybe affected.
because its i5 and i7 related plus if Asus based, who jump on current releases it maybe it.
Though, the tech answering the questions may not always know the latest info.
However, yes if possible replace the PSU with a more powerful unit and be sure all connections are fully seated.
good luck tada -----Willy
