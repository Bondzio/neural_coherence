The issue here is simple.
Stocking spare parts, issuing manuals and giving (free) support costs more than a new unit.
Some revolt against this but there is a second hand parts market on ebay for those that want to try replacing a part.
Do not bother asking the makers for parts on printers under a few hundred bucks.
You'll waste your time.
