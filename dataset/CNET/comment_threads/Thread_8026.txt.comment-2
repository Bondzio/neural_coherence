Don't get confused by the way you address a router -- the setup pages are in firmware in the router -- not on the internet.
Log in to your router via Internet Explorer (or similar) using its IP address -- usually 192.168.0.1 but see the manual for precise details of default IP address and Username Password for accessing interface pages.
