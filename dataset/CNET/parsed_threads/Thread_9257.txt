<s> ok so my new computer ran fine for two days, then next day I randomly get BSOD, usually memory management error then 0x0000001a... </s>
<s> So I figured it was the memory. </s>
<s> Uped voltage and made sure ram timings were where they were supposed to be, still BSOD randomly... then I put different memory in from another PC which has been running stable, still BSOD on this machine.. switched the power supply.. no luck. </s>
<s> Updated video drivers.. and yet still no luck. </s>
<s> all tempuratures are cool.. </s>
<s> I have no idea what the problem could be. </s>
<s> Is it possible its software related? </s>
<s> I installed Steam, WoW, and UT3, first 2 days they ran stable.. should I just reinstall windows with totally different drivers? </s>
<s> what could this be? </s>
<s> btw, eventlog had some warnings about TCip or something not quite sure, but they were not the same time it BSOD? </s>
<s> my motherboard is a BIOSTAR NF61S TE AM2 </s>
<s> tests....memtest86+ ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have, but the BSOD are to random and frequent to be accurate, it gets through with no errors til it BSOD, but its always at different times. </s>
<s> and like I said I tested with another pair of memory sticks out of a working stable computer, and upped the voltage (2.0v) along with tinkering and timings, even lowered spped to 667mhz with both pairs, BSOD seemed to happening just as frequent. </s>
<s> and no nothing is overclocked </s>
<s> I see &quot;new&quot; which means WARRANTY. </s>
<s> Be sure to ask the makers, suppliers for support or exchange of any, all parts involved. </s>
<s> -&gt; I wonder if this is a home built. </s>
<s> If so tell me about the CPU heatsink compound you used and how you knew to up the RAM voltage. </s>
<s> Did the BIOS get the setting wrong? </s>
<s> How did you know? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I knew to up the voltage and correct the timings because I fixed many computers before, just never seen an issue like this. </s>
<s> I figured it out though, it was service pack 2, I reinstalled windows, this time X64 edition, loaded drivers, been running stable since, did memtest overnight no errors, then prime 95 for 5 hours no probs. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> I am finding those that build there own are hemorrhaging at repair counters as out of date BIOS don't get the memory voltage and timings automatically right anymore. </s>
<s> What's the opposite of progress? </s>
