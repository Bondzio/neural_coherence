1.1.1	Hi everybody .	St
1.1.2	I just got a brand new PC to manage home movies , make music , and play a few games like WoW .	St
1.1.3	All this hype about consoles make me think that it may be better to do my gaming on them , rather than my computer .	St
1.1.4	It is 2.0 GHZ core duo , 2 gb of RAM , 256mb Nvidia X1600 .	St
1.1.5	What would be the major differences between gaming with a 360 or PS3 and my computer ?	Ques
1.1.6	As a side note , why is it that in a 600 dollar console ( PS3 ) they can include a & quot ; supercomputer & quot ; Cell processor while a 600 dollar pc would hardly get mainstram processing power ?	Ques
1.2.1	Well i see were ur getting at and i also thought about it but i also researched a lil , this is what i came up with : Sony is LOOSING money PER each PS3 they sell to keep the cost compeditive .	St
1.2.2	I 'm guess-timating that for each PS3 they are puttin up ( $ 100-300 ) dollars per each unit , Or they are getting one HELL of a deal on the components ( excluding the Cell processor )	St
1.3.1	But many wo n't put a HDTV on the console ( PC 's usually have far better displays than what most consoles are connected to . )	St
1.3.2	But then again , the headaches of getting some games to work proper makes me love tossing the games into consoles .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	Sony is loosing an estimated $ 500 - $ 450 for every PS3 ( playstation 3 ) console sold .	St
1.4.2	it cost an estimated $ 900 to make , and probably sold to retailers at like $ 400 then sold to end consumers at $ 500 and $ 600 .	St
1.4.3	400-900=500 net loss The blu-ray drive alone costs them like $ 300+ ea ... .. ( normal blu-ray drives cost upwards of $ 1,000 ) the Cell Prossesor cost them like 200+ ea ... .. +all the other stuff like the Graffix prossesor one hell of a losss on their part But at these pricess the PS3 ... .. is HELLLLA Cheap	St
