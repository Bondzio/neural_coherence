I'm not sure I saw the thread on Recuver.
Is this same as Photorec?
And you know what.
I'm just being careful.
Aint a geek geeky like that.
I'm just a Phtoographer.. Have got plenty data in that folder that I can't afford to mess up further.
I will try and see if I can find a local guy here who can work on it.
Cos I cant do drive saver from here and no time for me.
Cos I need the images urgently.
