However, Ultra(PATA) is starting to fade as SATA settles in as the new defacto std., so future offering will either eliminate it entirely, but for now some mtrbds. offer both. SATA, once it truly breaks out will be faster and no thought be it. IMHO, pick SATA if you have the chance and just go in that direction, sooner or later you'll have t. But for now, there's no real hurry to do so. In fact, it seems there are plenty of baragins for PATA drives vs. SATA. tada -----Willy

XP loads a little quicker and apps open a little quicker. There is a new SATA spec. out, and drives based on it can/will be faster than the present specs.
