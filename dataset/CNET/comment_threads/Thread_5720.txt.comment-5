2 seconds of printer timeout between pages being print.
Printer prints 2 pages then timeout 2 sec (loads data into job queue) then prints again, timeout 2 sec (loads data..)...I have no problem with the size of document being sent to printer queue but i have problem with the printer timeouts that are sure connected with size of the document being loaded in printer job queue.
Imagine printing 5 pages of pdf document, or powerpoint doc and printer is printing it one whole minute.
Also i tried printing to another HP 2055dn printer and everything is ok so maybe it's problem with printer network card but problem also appeared on another HP printer HP CM 1415fn.
Anyway if anything else comes to your mind please reply, thank you for your time.
