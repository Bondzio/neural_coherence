thanks for the reply.
i've posted in other places on the internet, and i rarely get anything more than ''pcchips ist teh suxorz!''
and no further direction.
the advice i have basically has made me abandon what i really wanted to do, because i apparently don't understand enough about chipsets, motherboard companies, and types of ram, i shouldn't be allowed to touch the inside of a computer.
but i do know that i want around 500 gbs of hd space, a lot of ram, a dvd drive with a separate dual-layer, dual format lightscribe burner, and a video card that lets me input and output tv.
beyond that, i just want a good computer that works, not the pure performance that i think most are thinking of.
the biggest thing i'm worried about is the video card.
i think i can handle everything else, providing the other parts are compatable.
if i bought an emachine or hp, i still wouldn't know exactly what video card to buy.
