1.2.1	It looks like some old stuff alright .	St
1.2.2	I thought much use can be had unless someone really needs it .	St
1.2.3	Offhand , use the minimum bid of $ 1 as any s/h will cost as well .	St
1.2.4	-OR- sell as a lot for $ 10 or more , but be practical it is old stuff .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	To get an idea of the value of a piece of hardware , search for it on eBay .	St
1.3.2	Use the option on the side of the page to view & quot ; completed & quot ; sales as most stuff like this will not find any buyers .	St
1.3.3	If you live in a Craig 's List area , that 's probably a good place to try to move some of your old & quot ; goodies & quot ; since there is no listing fee or seller 's fee on Craig 's .	St
1.3.4	The eBay listing fees on this & quot ; yesterday 's & quot ; equipment list will bleed you dry .	St
1.3.5	Perhaps a better idea would be to find some place that takes & quot ; tax write off & quot ; where you MIGHT recover a bit of yesterday 's values .	St
1.4.1	ISA is dead and gone .	St
1.4.2	Motherboards that you ca n't prove working are in the 1 to 10 buck range .	St
1.4.3	That JATON was famous for blue screens and more .	St
1.4.4	Take a hammer to it .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I tested the hardware already .	St
1.5.2	How else would I know about the low cmos battery on one of the motherboards .	St
1.5.3	I also loaded an OS and played some Audio CDs on the sound cards .	St
1.5.4	Spent over a week testing everything and except for the battery it all works .	St
1.6.1	Best bet is to ebay it and hope you get it gone .	St
1.6.2	The items you noted are found in dumpsters around my town every week .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Set your opening bid under a buck , 99 cents or a penny .	St
1.7.2	No pics , buy it know or other enhancements will keep your listing fees down .	St
1.7.3	Figure accurate shipping to cover yourself .	St
1.7.4	Be realistic , it 's only worth what you can sell it for .	St
1.7.5	The second highest bidder will determine your selling price .	St
1.7.6	I 'd sell most of it as a & quot ; lot & quot ; .	St
1.7.7	Somebody will buy it , but cheap !	St
1.8.1	I just finished testing a First International Computer Inc. VA-503+ motherboard so that is on the list too .	St
