Hello, I'm not sure if anyone has ever heard of this problem, but I'll still give it a shot.
I will try to explain it as much as I can.
Say I connected to my network, but then, if I turn off the router without turning off the wireless on my laptop, and then I turn the router back on again, my laptop wont connect to the network again -- it can't even find any access points!
(I got two access points in my house) -- (I have to restart my laptop to fix it) But, I wont have any issues if I turn off the wireless on my laptop before turning off the router.
It would connect again with no problem.
Does anyone think it could be a service that I disabled or put on manual?
Any help greatly appreciated.
Thank You!
