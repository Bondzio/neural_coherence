Most of the desktop cards are PCI, which should work in pretty much any current system. The two big names are ATI and Hauppauge, but there are many others. As with anything else, what's &quot;best&quot; depends on what you can afford, your current hardware and operating system, etc. Rather than reinvent the wheel, I suggest you simply Google &quot;PCI TV tuner&quot; and read some review sites, such a CNET's here: http://reviews.cnet.com/tv-adapters/ Good luck!
