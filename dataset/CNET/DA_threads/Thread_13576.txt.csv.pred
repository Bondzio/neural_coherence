1.1.1	Would love to find a laser printer that works with refilled cartridges ( trying to be green ) or at least has cartridges with such high yield that you do n't mind paying for them every once in a while .	St
1.1.2	It 's a small office , we probably print less than 50 sheets a day and do not require color printing .	St
1.1.3	We are switching to laser due to running through our print cartridges so quickly with the inkjet and being fed up with printers NOT working with refilled or refurbished cartridges .	St
1.1.4	If you have a suggestion for or against any laser , we would appreciate it !	St
1.2.1	There are a lot of Laser printers out there , for a basic reasonably inexpensive one , look at Brother I saw one on sale , I believe at Office Depot for around 70.00 a couple of weeks ago .	St
1.2.2	As I said there are many manufacturers out there , it depends on what you are doing from a quantitative standpoint .	St
1.2.3	The best thing to do would be to go and look at a few and compare specifications , cost per page etc .	St
1.2.4	Best of luck !	St
1.3.1	http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/HP+-+LaserJet+Pro+Wireless+Black-and-White+Laser+Printer/9811982.p ? id=1218177897716 & amp ; skuId=9811982 & lt ; a href= & quot ; http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/HP+-+LaserJet+Pro+Wireless+Black-and-White+Laser+Printer/9811982.p ? id=1218177897716 & amp ; skuId=9811982 & quot ; & gt ; & lt ; /a & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; Ive had an HP LaserJet 1018 for 4-5 years now ( not wireless ) and it has run very very well .	St
1.3.2	Having wireless technology will work very well in an office setting .	St
1.3.3	I have never used a stock HP cartridge with this one , except the very first one that came with the printer .	St
1.3.4	HP wants 70 bucks for them , and I 'm getting them on amazon now for 11 bucks including shipping .	St
1.3.5	Our family has always had good luck with HPs .	St
1.3.6	Another thing to keep in mind is that ( at least when I was shopping for a laser ) you might want to see if the drum is a separate accessory , and if so , how many pages you can expect to print off of one , before replacing it .	St
1.3.7	When I was shopping , HP said that the drums are built into each cartridge so you do n't have to worry about this , but they can be quite expensive for other printers .	St
1.3.8	Maybe they are all like this now ( built into the toner cartridge ) , but when I was buying this , a Brother that I was thinking of had it as an extra part that would need to be replaced .	St
1.4.1	Practically all laser ptrs .	St
1.4.2	out there have refillable toner carts available .	St
1.4.3	The more popular , the more likely easily available .	St
1.4.4	There are also , services that maybe local to you that provide the actual refill service or carts when needed .	St
1.4.5	From what I 've seen Brother and Samsung have the bottom end of mono-lasers out there .	St
1.4.6	They 're good and you need to review the specs .	St
1.4.7	Many are under $ 100 and deals can be had .	St
1.4.8	At those prices , you can buy another printer and leave it on the shelf until dire need .	St
1.4.9	Replacement toner carts , while new from OEM are cheaper now , refills still are cheaper , but as always , cheap is cheap .	St
1.4.10	Buy , from a source you deem worthy .	St
1.4.11	Also , HP has low cost mono-laser but here you need to review what options start to fall into place , like wifi , memory , paper handling , duplex , etc. , to include other brands as well .	St
1.4.12	A low-end printer should last at least 2yrs .	St
1.4.13	before some issue crops up and that also depends on usage .	St
1.4.14	As a small SOHO , do n't settle for price alone .	St
1.4.15	I have recommended Konica , HP and Canon while more expensive tend to simply last under normal use .	St
1.4.16	taeda -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Be careful with refilled toner cartridges .	St
1.5.2	I used to spend my days charging a lot more than a cartridge costs to tell people & quot ; The problem is the toner cartridge & quot ; ; or worse yet cleaning up the mess when a & quot ; rebuilt & quot ; cartridge dumped its toner in the machine .	St
1.6.1	Canon , basic , smallest model appears to be the best for home use .	St
1.6.2	It has many features not found in others .	St
1.6.3	I am using it for about 2 years now , without any trouble .	St
1.6.4	I am delighted to use it .	St
1.6.5	& lt ; div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.7.1	Hi , when you are checking out the specs as others have suggested , be sure to check the Duty Cycle , usually expressed in pages per month - it 's a pretty good indication of the workload a printer can handle .	St
1.7.2	that said , most lasers will have no problem with your 1000 pages per month ( 50x20 ) .	St
1.7.3	I 've had a Samsung ML-1750 for about six years now and the quality of the print is still as good as the day I bought it .	St
1.7.4	It happily runs on Cartridge World refilled toner cartridges ut then they do refill genuine Samsung cartridges , not compatibles .	St
1.7.5	The only niggle with Samsung is that the initial cartridge supplied with the printer is half load - a tad mean !	St
1.7.6	HP Laserjet 10xx models have a pretty good reputation too and should be fine for the print capacity you need .	St
1.7.7	I 've no experience with Brother but their price is very attractive .	St
1.7.8	Depending on your needs , you might want to take a look at some of the laser all-in-ones that have now reached the & quot ; affordable & quot ; level .	St
1.8.1	can also result in a blue face if the refill invalidates the warranty .	St
1.9.1	I HAVE A BROTHER 5370DW ITS A WORK HORSE , FAST PRINTING , PRINT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PAPER , WIFI .	St
1.9.2	THEY SELL AROUND $ 170 TO $ 200 .	St
