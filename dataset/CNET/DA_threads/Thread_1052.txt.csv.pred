1.1.1	I 've recently had a problem with my USB mouse .	St
1.1.2	The cursor was locking , and after some time the same happened with my keyboard .	St
1.1.3	So I decided to take my PC to a technician and he replaced my USB mouse with a serial mouse since the problem seemed to be with the USB ports .	St
1.1.4	Now my problem with this mouse is that it frequently acts very strangely in that right-click menus open suddenly without me having touched the mouse .	St
1.1.5	Also sometimes the cursor changes its position on the monitor , yet the mouse is not being moved .	St
1.1.6	Can anyone help me with this problem please ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	whens the last time you ran an updated virus scan ?	Ques
1.3.1	Do you have a PS/2 port for the mouse ?	Ques
1.4.1	I have scanned my PC with no viruses detected .	St
1.4.2	Yeah I have a USB/PS2 port , but I had to change that mouse since the ports seem to be faulty .	St
1.4.3	The PS2 mouse was not working .	St
1.4.4	Therefore my technician advised me to work with a serial mouse , which I am doing , but with this little problem .	St
1.5.1	If both your USB and PS/2 ports do n't work then there is something drastically wrong with the system .	St
1.5.2	There is no correlation between USB and PS/2 , so if both broke it is not surprising that the Serial mouse does n't work either .	St
1.5.3	Are you having any other problems with this system ?	Ques
1.5.4	How old is it , what hardware are we talking about here , is this a REAL old system ?	Ques
