well if i go with an amd board there dont seem to be too many that support ddr any faster than 400 if i remember right.
the one i'm looking at supports 266/333/400 for the type of ddr so i think that's pretty much the ceiling; least for now.
vc: i've actually got almost the opposite philosophy; why not spend lots for a great one now then by the time it's completely outdated (4-5 years) it would be time to probably start over again.
hence why most of the components listed are at least in the upper echelon of the quality and technological edge.
probably runs about the same total cost in the long run; least in that area.
i like pretty much just having something that will do the job until it no longer can.
if i can make a tnt2 m64 last upwards of 4-5 years which i have, what are the odds a 6800gt would last the same amount of time if not longer before the ram size and chipset are no longer even able to handle the min requrements?
good chance as far as i'm concerned... that's my take on things anyway.
2 $250 cards over 4 years or so is pretty much the same as a $500 one.
it's a thought though, i'll grant that.
was considering the x700 series or x800pro but some digging pointed to the 6800gt being better than the x800 and seemed to fit my more long term prefrences.
*shrugs* i'll do some more shopping... figure i'll look into the 6600 a bit.
if its close maybe i will go that direction for now... which might clear up enough room to keep the audigy involved... hmm, i'll check around...
