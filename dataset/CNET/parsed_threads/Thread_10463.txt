<s> Hello, I am running with a GeForce Ti-4200 card on a Abit KG7 motherboard. </s>
<s> For years, if I try to enter a game without letting the machine run for 10 minutes, the video goes into pyscho colors mode and I have to reset. </s>
<s> Temperatures are fine within case and CPU. </s>
<s> Suspecting the 300W PSU, I upgraded to a good 400W with no change. </s>
<s> Downloaded latest NVidia drivers - no change. </s>
<s> I swapped with video card with another (GeForce 256) in another older PC and both PCs work fine. </s>
<s> So, I believe I have some quirky compatibility issue between the MB and the Ti4200. </s>
<s> I would like to get a 6600GT card but would I be throwing away money since the MB only supports AGP 4X? </s>
<s> &quot; I try to enter a game without letting the machine run for 10 minutes, the video goes into pyscho &quot; I swap the motherboard in this case. </s>
<s> You can research the terms BAD MOTHERBOARD CAPACITORS to see this issue, but the symptom is consistent with bad caps. </s>

<s> Thanks, I had thought about that. </s>
<s> I have a little more information now. </s>
<s> After switching video cards in my two PCs, the problem reared its ugly head again on the PC with Ti4200 card. </s>
<s> I guess its time to buy a new one. </s>
<s> I bought a XFX 6600GT card (to replace a Ti4200 that was failing with increased frquency) and placed in my Abit KG7 mb. </s>
<s> Updated BIOS and northbridge drivers and thoroughly cleaned the Ti4200 Nvidia drivers. </s>
<s> New board works until I try to play video using Windows Media Player (video all green) or games like Battlefield 1942 or Half Life2, where the graphics are viewable but messed up (color and images). </s>
<s> I tried the latest Nvidia drivers and now the video goes black when the Windows desktop loads. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Boot safe mode to either set the video mode to something that your monitor likes or remove the new drivers. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Your issues still reverberate with the usual issues of motherboard caps and too small or old power supplies. </s>
<s> Did you try a new 450 Watt or larger supply? </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> I tried a new motherboard (Soyo) and everything works great! </s>
<s> I don't believe it was a cap issue, but some quirk between the AGP2.0 slot on the KG7 and 6600 GT card. </s>
