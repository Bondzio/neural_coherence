i'm sorry you're leaving.
tennessee is not far from here.
i've tried to uninstall roxio and nero, but i can't find the uninstall executable for those two programs.
is there another way to get them off of the computer?
i know what a usb connector is.
i have 8 of them on this computer.
i don't know what a usb drive is.
do you mean a flash drive??
i have a small one and i can buy one large enuf for this hard drive.
i want to know how i can make a complete copy of my hard drive on a flash drive as i did --- and i have been saying this here repeatedly -- when i copied my old computer to this one using an app like pc relocator, not losing any software or files i wanted to keep.
