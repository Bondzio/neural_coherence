EcoFont is a step in the right direction.
Not only ink is expensive, the printers do a great job spending it!
I recently found a software utility, PretonSaver Home, that &quot;turns&quot; every font to eco-font.
It reduces ink consumption by up to 70% and provides excellent print quality.
I did not have to change the fonts I use or change the way I print.
PretonSaver works in the background and very smartly optimizes the ink/toner used by my printers.
Try it for free.
