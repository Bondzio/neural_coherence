Trying to share one printer, an HP PSC 1350V all in one. Using a Netgear PS121 Mini-Print Server and all the computers are also hooked into a Netgear FVS318 VPN. All the computers can send things to the printer with no problem, but need to have bi-directional capability for scans. Any suggestions?

The older all-in-one devices lose both the &quot;all&quot; and the &quot;in&quot; and become just &quot;one&quot; (print) when placed on a print server. Just the way it works, can't be fixed. dw
