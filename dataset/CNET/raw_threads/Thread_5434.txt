I can only boot into safe mode because I'm having XP Home issues. I need to move important files (20GB worth - movies and MP3s) to SOMETHING and I'm purchasing an external hard drive soon. Question is, can I move those files to the external HD when I can only boot to safe mode? If so, how do I do that?
