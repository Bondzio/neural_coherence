I bought a D-Link PCI (internal) because I had the room inside the computer and I don't like having things permanantly hanging off the sides of the case.
I also still have all my USB ports free.
I followed the directions exactly (install drivers from CD before inserting card) and it has worked flawlessly ever since.
$30 after rebate at Officemax, and they did send me my check.
Good Luck, Eric
