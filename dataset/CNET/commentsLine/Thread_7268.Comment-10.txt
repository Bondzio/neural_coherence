you write &quot;my motherboard says theres no pcie slot but i see 1&quot; later you reveal the model number so i go and get what hp writes about that model.
you seem upset about that but i'll try again if you will.
now that we know there should be a slot and it is supported can you explain what you mean by &quot;my motherboard says theres no pcie slot&quot;?
for example some folk will run software such as &quot;what's in my pc.com&quot; and it won't find stuff.
that's not a good test software in my book so let's hear why you think the motherboard is reporting no such slot.
