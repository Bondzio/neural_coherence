<s> Heyyy so I'm wanting to play the Sims 3 on my laptop and all of my specs match up, just my memory card says it has 64 MB of dedicated memory when I need a minimum of 124 MB, but I know I have 1071 MB of total available graphics memory. </s>
<s> I heard you can change your dedicated memory through BIOS, but I honestly have no idea how to do so or if it's safe for someone like me (basically technology UN-savvy) to do so. </s>
<s> If you could tell me if it's kinda foolproof or if it's easy or anything, that would be amazing. </s>
<s> Thank you so much in advance. </s>

<s> This is not an option for this model. </s>
<s> But go ahead and try the Sims anyway since the allocation of video ram is dynamic in this model. </s>

<s> Okay, I'll try it out. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If you're still around lol, what does it mean when you say &quot;allocation of video ram is dynamic in this model&quot;? </s>
<s> &quot;Dedicated Memory: 57 MB Shared Memory: 1007 MB&quot; Those chipsets use system memory when needed. </s>
<s> Its a shame the makers don't have articles about how this works. </s>
<s> But Nvidia and ATI do but who reads those? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Basically, your graphics processor will borrow memory from your entire laptop's system memory when it needs to. </s>
<s> The Sims will most definitely run smoothly on your system. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, try bumping the graphics settings down within the game just a tad. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
