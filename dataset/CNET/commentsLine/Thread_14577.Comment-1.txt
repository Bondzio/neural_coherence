i am looking for an old gateway 2000 desktop computer, preferrably with windows 98. must have a telepath ii (14,400) modem and the faxworks program that came with the computer.
doesn't have to look great; just run so i can replay some old sentimental voicemails of a deceased family member.
for what it's worth, the one i had was a pentium 75 with about 64mbs of ram and a 720 mb hard drive.
doesn't have to match those numbers necessarily.
any suggestions??
?
