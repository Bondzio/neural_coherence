it doesent beep at all on bare minimum power and cpu fan, it's been abused for years, overclocked to over 1000mhz despite the cpu being 858mhz, its had pencil lines on the cpu to do overclockers tweaks to it, agp and isa clocking, too high refresh rates e.t.c, now i have a new pc it was my guini pig, so i kind of expected it to break in a way, but i will get it another mobo and sqeeze a few more years out of her as a linux machine
