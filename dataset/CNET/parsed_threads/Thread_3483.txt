<s> I bought some new DDR2 memory, but it won't fit. </s>
<s> Both my old and new memory have 240 pins. </s>
<s> The memory I had has 64 pins then a gap then 56 pins (each side), which looking at google images and Wikipedia seems standard. </s>
<s> The new memory, (HYF2536481G) has 68 pins then a gap then 52 pins (each side). </s>
<s> The gap is 73mm from the edge I thought all DDR2 memory had the same layout; has anyone come across this? </s>
<s> I thought they might have sent DDR because of the gap position, but DDR has fewer pins. </s>
<s> What help do you need? </s>
<s> You can't change that stick. </s>
<s> So return it and buy the right one. </s>
<s> The memory finder at www.crucial.com surely will lead to that. </s>
<s> Or - if you prefer a physical shop above a webshop - take an old stick with you when doing the exchange. </s>

<s> I would buy the 'right one' if I was confident of what that is. </s>
<s> I would also like to find out if it was my mistake for ordering the wrong memory or the retailer has the wrong information on the memory; Wikipedia describes DIMM DDR2 as being specifically identifiable by a gap 70mm across (which would fit) and not 73mm. </s>
<s> Crucial doesn't have the system listed or I would have ordered from them. </s>
<s> The motherboard is MS-7301, which supports up to 2GB DDR2 memory. </s>
<s> I did a bit of research and can't find any information on different pin positions in DIMM DDR2 memory, so I am a bit apprehensive about reordering until I find out so the same mistake isn't made; PC5300 DDR2 DIMM should be the right memory. </s>
<s> I can't find it on crucial.com, indeed, but http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=MS-7302%20%28K9A2GM-F%20V3%29&Cat=RAM is the page for the 7302. </s>
<s> That says: DDR2 PC2-5300, DDR2 PC2-6400, DDR2 PC2-8500 (non ECC). </s>
<s> Might apply to the 7301 also. </s>
<s> What does the manual say? </s>
<s> Back to the retailer seems the best way to go. </s>

<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Desktop_DDR_Memory_Comparison.svg Note the notch moves from ddr2&gt;ddr3 </s>
<s> HYF2536481G That shows to be ecc ram. </s>
<s> Is that what you want? </s>
<s> I've never played with the stuff.......perhaps the slot location moves. </s>
<s> It's not on their system list, despite being a Packard Bell, but the system scanner link worked on that page you posted. </s>
<s> Memory suggested is 2no 1GB DDR2 PC2-5300. </s>
<s> I don't think the ones Misco sent are proper DDR2, so I'll see if I can get a refund then reorder else where. </s>
