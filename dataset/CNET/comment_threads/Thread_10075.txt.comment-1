I decided it's time to get a new PC and thought it would be a good idea to build one rather than buy one pre-built to save money.
I looked on newegg.com and found some parts and I'm not sure if they're compatible or not, and none of my friends know.
I was hoping someone would be able to tell me if they are and point me to compatible ones if they're not.
And would I need a better power supply with this case?

).
