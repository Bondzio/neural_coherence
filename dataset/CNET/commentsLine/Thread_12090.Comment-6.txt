i know that most people with newer computers have the ability to use the pci-e cards, but for those of us with older, can't afford either new computer or new mobo/chip and have the agp slot, there is still a market.
it may be smaller, but it exists.
my older althon xp 1800+ uses agp.
do i want to upgrade my mobo, etc.?
you bet.
can i afford to upgrade?
no way, not this year at least.
i recently bought from newegg an evga fx5500 256mb 128-bit agp card for under $50.
notwithstanding that i am having weird problems with errors and freezes (could be the driver?
), i'm getting a beautiful clear screen for general use.
