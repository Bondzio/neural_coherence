<s> Hi there. </s>
<s> I am heading off for school in less than a month and I need to purchase a computer. </s>
<s> I have left things a little late and I am torn between two computers. </s>
<s> I have about $1900CDN to spend and all prices are listed in CDN dollars. </s>

<s> You should be able to find a decent pair of speakers for $10.00 US. </s>
<s> The balance of the money can go towards any future software and/or peripherals you need. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> It is the latest in computers.....Dual-Core Processors and also has 64-bit support (EM64T). </s>
<s> Has ATI Radeon X300SE PCI-Express video card which means it has the latest PCIe x16 slot for video card upgrade. </s>
