<s> I'm an architect and about to buy a new PC as a performance upgrade to suffice architecture related software, and i'm in the middle of these two devices the Dell XPS one 27 and Lenovo Ideacentre A720, the highest specs model in each the two brands. </s>
<s> One of the perplexing specs for me was the screen, i actually can't reach a presentable Unit from both to view it myself, so i'm unaware of the difference of screens, whether the Lenovo's is very good for me as an architect especially its touch ability which is good for upcoming operating systems and specific using in architecture drafting, or it's not enough and the high res. </s>
<s> one is the perfect especially in a 27&quot; screen. </s>
<s> I also care to have a device that have the specs that are up to date and even catch up with the afterwards, i don't like to have a computer and just after couple of weeks or months, i find that a feature has been completed developed and flipped over to be something else like the high res screen for example. </s>
<s> Last year's best machine is usually fine for such work. </s>
<s> Maybe we can compare what you use now to these. </s>
<s> Is it a nice step up? </s>
<s> At 27 inches, did you compare the DPI of the available screens? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm very sorry I don't understand which you mean by last year's best machine. </s>
<s> And if you are questioning about my owned PC specs; it's insufficient for my field work, it's a 2.13 GHz core 2 duo processor with 3 GBs of RAM and a 512 MBs Nvidia Display adapter with a normal 5400 RPM Sata hard drive, and a 15.4&quot; screen with native resolution of 1280 x 800. </s>
<s> And, yes too, if you mean by DPI the display native resolution of the screens, then the XPS one 27 has a resolution of 2560x1440 whilst Lenovo Ideacentre A720 has 1920x1080. </s>
<s> Sorry when I ask about DPI, it's not about the number of dots on the screen. </s>
<s> Here's a primer on DPI. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch While it's nice to have a higher DPI some folk explode when they can't see a single pixel change on the display when it's very small. </s>
<s> So while Apple's Retina displays are very nice, I find CAD folk to have issues with very high DPI screens when drawing lines and such. </s>
<s> Last year's high end machine could be some i7, 8GB ram, etc. </s>
<s> So you are talking about a 2 generation leap so it will be fine. </s>
