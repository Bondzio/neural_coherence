After fixing a hardware issue in my computer, I was in the process of copying files from my D: drive to my C: drive and the computer spontaneously restarted.
It would not boot back into windows and I ended up installing/booting from my D: drive.
Back in windows, I discovered that my old primary HDD did not have any readings inside windows (disk size was 0 bytes), and when I try to browse the drive, it says it is not formatted.
I have a backup from February 2005 but nothing since then... Is there anything I can do to possibly get any information off of the drive?
