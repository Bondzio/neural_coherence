9885	0	151523	1687404	NR	mspek	1/20/06 7:09 PM	1.13778414E12	Gateway Standbuy Icon	I had problems with my computer and had to reload everything. If I go to the start at the lower left side click on it then go to turn off computer I used to be able to click on the Standbuy icon, and computer would go into hibernate/ standby mode and since reloading everything it will not go into the standby mode. Not a real rocket scientist when it comes to computers,If some one could explain how to get this working again it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, mspek.
