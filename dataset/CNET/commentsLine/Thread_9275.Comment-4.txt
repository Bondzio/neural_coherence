thanks for your reply, as you can see i don't have a lot of time to troubleshoot this.
i did however use the new cables that came with the mb so i tried the old grey cable with no luck.
what did happen was that the bios gave me a warning that i had just downgraded the performance of my hard drive by using the older cable.
this is very weird.
it's acting like only part of the bios recognises the hard drives.
if i go into the hard drive section of the bios setup, they are both there.
if i look at the primary and secondary master and slave, both on auto-detect, it says none detected for the hard drives and the dvd drives.
anyway, thanks for your idea, next i will look at the mb manual and see if i can clear the cmos.
