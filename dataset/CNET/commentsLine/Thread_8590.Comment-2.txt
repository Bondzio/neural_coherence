the issues are.
1.
4 gigabyte filesize limit in fat32.
no fix (ever) for this one.
why its a limitation is that you won't be able to make an .iso image to make a dvd.
let me clarify that this will not stop you from creating dvds, but a few tricks and methods will not be available to you.
2. resources (64 thousand bytes) video editing is cpu intensive, but some software packages have thrown in the towel on dos based windows and don't run at all on 95/98/me.
again, no fix ever for the 64 thousand pools of memory called resources for windows 95/98/me.
again, this only limits what you can do.
not a stop.
best of luck, bob
