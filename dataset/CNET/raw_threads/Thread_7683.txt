I was just curious as to how safe all these routers are with the frequencies? Is there any health risks? Any help would be appreciated. thanks

I helped someone with a VPN issue that turned out to be problems whenever she would use her wireless phone while using her wireless router at the same time! She ended up having to get a different phone. Of greater concern might be wireless security. When you were going through the wireless setup utility that came with your router, did it have you set some encryption services like WAP? If you want help with setting those up, you could post the model of wireless router you have and we could help.
