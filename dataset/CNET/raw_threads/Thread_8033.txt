SO I have heard that the motherboard ASUS was one of the best out there. So, what is the difference between the A8N Deluxe and the A8N Premium? TigerDirect has a side by side comparison and it looks like you get more bang for your buck with the Deluxe. But the Deluxe is cheaper so I must be missing something.

Deluxe has 2 PCI-e x1 slots. Premium *may* overclock a bit more and/or be more stable due to heat pipe cooling.
