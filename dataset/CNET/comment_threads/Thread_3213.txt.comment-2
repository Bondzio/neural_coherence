Yes.
I am a bit confused of what do you really want to do with your network.
But if I understood it correctly you have a Mac laptop and you are also planning to buy a Lenovo.
There are wireless cards that both are compatible with a MAC computer and a computer running through Windows better look for those device.
I bet Linksys have one, and it have drives for both mac and windows.
