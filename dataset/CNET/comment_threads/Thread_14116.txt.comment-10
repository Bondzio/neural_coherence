If your wireless card has a detachable antenna on it, then you would need to find the proper cable with the end you need for your wireless card, and the right connector to attach to whatever style of antenna you purchase.
To use this setup; yes, you would need to have something within range to connect to.
You were asking about 2-3 block range, so if you had a neighbor with a wireless hotspot and you had permission to connect to their network, then yeah, it MIGHT be possible.
It all depends on what exactly you are trying to accomplish and what kind of distances you are trying to cover.
There are a lot of variables involved.
