Tell me the OS install routine you used. List date and version for: a. Motherboard chipset driver package. b. Sound card driver. c. Video card driver version. In closing, type BAD CAPS at google.com and look for that issue. Your machine is from the days you see this issue. Bob

As to the power supply it's on the light side. Can you unplug that second hard disk, second DVD drive to lighten the load for testing? As to the chipset driver I don't see the version Intel just put out in use. Here's the link -&gt; http://downloadcenter.intel.com/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=816&OSFullName=Windows*+XP+Home+Edition&lang=eng&strOSs=45&submit=Go%21 Use item 2 dated 6/2/2008. Good luck. Bob

You may wish to search them out in the EVGA &quot;support&quot; page, as well as other hardware requirement to run this card. How about the most resent driver?

One available AGP 2.0 compliant slot or better, or one available PCI slot (as required for your specific card). Windows 95 OSR2 (Version 4.00.950b), Windows 98, ME, XP, 2000 or Windows NT4.0. (Service Pack 5 or 6) 64MB system memory. 50MB of available disk space for full installation. CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. I think my PC exceeds all these, but still i have the problem! nd yes, i have the latest drivers installed. My friend tells me to reinstall OS, but its a real pain, and not guaranteed to work, btw, there is no problem with other tasks in the PC, just games.

Under XP OS, having 512mb is practical, 1gb being the most sensible. Gaming just puts it all in a basket and tests the wankle out of it, so upgrade. Since, you system is older don't expect the newer demanding games to run as well too after the upgrades, they want so much more as you review those requirements so beware. If possible, you may want to look for a better cpu as well for the total upgrade path options. Yours *may* support upto 2.4ghz/P4 and that too needs better PSU. tada -----Willy
