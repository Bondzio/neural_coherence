issue: samsung ide hdd 250gb is spinning but the needle keeps going to the middle and back, over and over again ( i took it apart to see what could be wrong), but it's not mounting on any pc.
i used a double usb &gt; micro usb cable.
so it does have sufficient power.
(the hdd is normally in a casing, which dropped yesterday and is probably causing the issue) does anyone have ay idea if i can make it work again, and what is causing the issue if anyone is interested, i can upload a movie of the spinning hdd tonight so people can see what i mean.
ty in advance,
