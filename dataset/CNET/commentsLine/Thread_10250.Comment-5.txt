(i always use the business versions of xp and vista and forgot they are not available in xp home and vista premium.)
you can upgrade to vista ultimate for $159 to get the encryption feature.
it also includes better backup features and bitlocker (a true hard drive data protection system).
vista's encryption is based on a digital certificate that's bound to your user id.
if the hard drive is put in another machine, none of the encrypted data will be readable (except by *serious* hackers).
since it's certificate based and tied to the os/user, you don't need to worry about setting/forgetting a password when using encryption.
