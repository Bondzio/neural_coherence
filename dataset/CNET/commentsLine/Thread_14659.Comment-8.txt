as much as i would love to have a titan, that is a bit much.
i need a graphics card and a gpu that can handle it in the price range of 500 or less.
&lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;one of my friends says his card can run pretty much every game on top settings, he has a radeon hd 6870.
&lt;span&gt;(link:  ) &lt;span&gt;my question is, would it, and if it could, what psu could i fit into my current case that can handle that card?
