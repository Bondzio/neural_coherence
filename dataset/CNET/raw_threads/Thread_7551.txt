The best driver I found was from http://www.diamondmm.com/driversbefore912003.php#stealth These drivers are for WIN95/98/2K. Will the 2K driver be compatible with XP? Does this mean that this AGP 4X card will run on my motherboard that supports up to 2X? Also does this card support 32-bit colour, I've found nothing that says the colour modes this model supports. Thanks for your help.

If you have the card and the time to play around, then go ahead. But that's your choice. What I often find is these out of date drivers will crash if you try to play some game made after 2001... You also ask &quot;Does this mean that this AGP 4X card will run on my motherboard that supports up to 2X? Also does this card support 32-bit colour, I've found nothing that says the colour modes this model supports.&quot; 1. If it plugs in. The cards are keyed to keep you from plugging in an incompatible card. 2. From what I read, yes. Bob

The system isn't really good enough to run recent games so it shouldn't be a problem, I also have a nVidia TNT2 M64 card in a very similar systemand it works fine. I've just been looking into this because my Intel 740 graphics under XP sometimes gives a narrow picture across the middle of the screen in some full screen apps, I think the driver is the problem as it was fine under 98SE and the XP driver is the most recent, nut it doesn't matter now. Thanks, Nick
