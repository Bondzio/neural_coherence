raid level 1: disk mirroring or duplexing would do just that.
any error on the main drive will faithfully be copied onto the other drive.
i've been at this for 2 decades (plus) and never found raid 1 to save anyone time, money or data.
go figure.
maybe next time something simply such as using one drive as a normal drive, then use acronis or such to save a copy of the os plus everything to the second drive as you see fit.
at least you have a copy that should not corrupt when the first drive and its os messes up.
