just set up a typical 2-pc home network (a desktop & a laptop).... both pcs running vista printer is local to desktop & shared successfully found & added the shared printer on the laptop system problem: when sending a single test document from the laptop, the print queue (which started w/ zero documents) now shows a count of 2 documents, but only the job i sent is listed in the pending documents; and that job never prints on the desktop side, no pending documents are listed; however, when i print from the desktop, the job shows up briefly on the laptop queue (as it should) if i cancel the test document on the laptop, a count of 1 still remains on the print queue, but no documents are in the list what am i missing??
big thanks to anyone that can help
