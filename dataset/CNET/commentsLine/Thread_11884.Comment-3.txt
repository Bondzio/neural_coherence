i'm pretty sure other people aren't hopping on the network, it's just my other computer that's conencting wirelessly.
i know this because when i turn that other computer off, the blinking amber goes away.
so if this wireless card is the source of this blinking, how do i correct it?
it wasn't doing it for the longest time..
