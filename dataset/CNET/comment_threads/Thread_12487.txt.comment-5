Hy bro!
ya thats not a big deal.
you can buy a regular psu at about rs.
700/-(Frontech 450W).
And dont worry i also using my old psu.
I am also using the XFX Radeon HD 6670 1GB DDR5 card in my pc & my screen res.
is as same as yours (1366x768).
And I am very satisfied.
I play most games mostly resent releases(Max Payne 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Serious Sam BFE, Fifa 12, AC Revolutions, Saints Row the third, Skyrim V, Crysis 2 etc. )
and it give me verry good results.
