<s> Hello all, I have a question, i own a Sharp PC-AV18 Notebook, about 2 years old. </s>
<s> Lately i have noticed that the cooling fan is not comming on like used to, but some day working fine. </s>
<s> My question is: it is a cooling fan is bad or maybe another problem possible,( like a bad connection or configuration in my PC)? </s>
<s> Any advise welcomed.If the fan is bad, just curious how much? </s>
<s> and where can i order one online? </s>
<s> since I live in Spain now. </s>
<s> Thanks Stefan </s>
<s> Google away for laptop repair/supply source that can help you. </s>
<s> Of course check with Sharp's own services and if you can order the fan itself, just be sure of the proper model#, etc. </s>
<s> in order to get the right part. </s>
<s> It appears you may have a sticky fan, as fans do wear out and get stuck either because of dust or lost lubrication. </s>
<s> usually, in such cases, I take the fan out and re-oil the main spot, dead center usually behind the sticker/decal on the &quot;backside&quot; usually the same side as the wire harness protudes. </s>
<s> One drop of fine oil or light wt. </s>
<s> oil will do, allow it to migrate down into the bearing. </s>
<s> Dab any excess oil and re-attach or tape over decal/sticker, then return fan to location. </s>
<s> Hope that helps, otherwise replace. </s>
<s> Of course check for any loose contacts, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
