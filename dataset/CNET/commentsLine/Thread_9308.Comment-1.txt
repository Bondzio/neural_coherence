i removed and refilled the black ink cartridge on my 880 and and could not get it to print.
multiable cleanings would not improve quality of color so i removed it also and filled all the head wells with head cleaning fluid.
[read this was very effective on episons] now black or color will not print.
is this one of the episons that has a chip to stop reuse of cartridges?
