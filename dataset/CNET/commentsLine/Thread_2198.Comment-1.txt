we are in need of a multimode 120 port approximately 2 inches in width, with the teeth measuring 1.5 inches.
picture available if necessary.
we were given monitors, and the port that comes with them is unusual as far as we can tell.
as such, we are unable to connect the monitor to the tower we would like to use it with.
we are looking for anyone with experience or knowledge to assist us in connecting them--whether we need a special video card or an adapter to connect them.
