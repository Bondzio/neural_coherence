<s> Hi all, im hoping one of you knowledgeable chaps will be able to help me with a problem I'm having. </s>
<s> I have a pc and a laptop both running windows xp pro. </s>
<s> I recently purchased a netgear WGR614 wireless router. </s>
<s> It set up easily enough, with all appropriate connections running fine. </s>
<s> I can access the internet either through a cable or wirelessly no problem. </s>
<s> i can also share files from my main pc to any attached device. </s>
<s> What i cannot seem to do is access my pc's files from another machine, either wirelessly or with cable connected to the router. </s>
<s> I can ping all machines from all others with no loss or problems. </s>
<s> I am running zonealarm but seem to have the network set up ok (problem persists with zonealarm disabled and also uninstalled), and have disabled windows firewall. </s>
<s> To be honest ive run through so many different options that it might be that i now throw myself open to your help. </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
