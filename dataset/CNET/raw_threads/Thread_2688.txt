I'm trying to set up a network where I can share files/printers/drives. From the Windows 98 machine when I open Network Neighborhood I can see both computers. It allows me to open the files I've shared on either computer (from the Win 98 machine). From the Win 2000 machine, I can see both computers in Network Neighborhood. But I cannot open the Win 98 machine (to even see which folders are shared). I get the following error message: Not Accessible - The Network Path Was Not Found If I turn off the desktop it's computer name disappears from the Win 2000 machine's Network Neighborhood...so it does have a live communication/status. I just don't understand why it sees it...knows it's there....but then tells me the path was not found. The user id's that I use to log on to each system are available on both machines. If it matters, the Laptop is wireless and the desktop is wired directly to the wireless router, which is a Netgear. Both computers do have a functioning internet connection. Printer/File Sharing is enabled on both machines. I've uninstalled/reinstalled it on the Win 98 machine several times to no avail. I will name my first born after whomever can help me solve this problem. THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!

Then I might check if the folder is actually shared and file and print sharing is enabled. Don't name your kid Michael, there are already too many.
