<s> I have a Viewsonic LCD monitor and was wondering what was the best cleaning product to use. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> They make special LCD spray solutions. </s>
<s> I use the stuff from Monster on my DLP screen, so it should work fine on an LCD. </s>
<s> Check your local computer store. </s>
<s> Click on this link , then click on step four and read towards the bottom. </s>
<s> Cnet says to take a damp cloth and gently wipe it on your LCD. </s>
<s> I did what they suggested, and it worked fine. </s>
<s> Make sure you don't spray too much water. </s>
<s> Just wanted to make sure I don't mess up my new monitor. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> so it is really critical to make sure that you know how to clean an LCD. </s>
<s> There was this ad I saw about some sort of tough plastic to protect your LCD. </s>
<s> It comes in a variety of sizes like 17inchs, and 19inchs, and is supposed to make text on LCDs look clearer. </s>
<s> It is so tough that you can actually use your LCD as a cutting board! </s>
<s> I saw an ad for this in PC magazine. </s>
<s> I'll try to find it and post back. </s>
<s> I believe this is the product I am talking about. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824999207 For some reason Newegg only has a 19inch size. </s>
<s> The ad I saw for this product had other sellers(Newegg one of them). </s>
<s> I'll try to find the magazine to check for the other sellers. </s>
<s> I think I'll just stick to the method that CNet mentioned in their cleaning lesson. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help though. </s>
<s> I understand that that would probably be the best way to keep the screen clean but it's just too expensive. </s>
<s> With performance comes price. </s>
<s> I won't be using my LCD as a cutting board so I won't need it. </s>
<s> My LCD does get dirty, but a wipe with a damp cloth cleans it just fine. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> To protect my LCD monitor's screen, I bought a piece of thin &quot;optical quality&quot; pexiglass from a local hardware store for roughly $7 -- had to cut it in half. </s>
<s> Taped it on up top. </s>
<s> I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, since it is home brewed, but it is an option. </s>
<s> I did it after a pair of round-nosed school scissors dinged my laptop's LCD; it keeps people from playing &quot;darts&quot; with my LCD monitor. </s>
<s> I bought this for my PowerBook, and it works great. </s>
<s> They include a chamois with the bottle. </s>
<s> You spray, wipe, buff, and all the fingerprints, dust, and beveage splashes disappear. </s>
<s> 20 bucks for 150 ml, but you use it [quite] sparingly for best results. </s>
<s> I used iklear, and Moster lcd cleaners, but both left awful smudges and streaks. </s>
<s> I later found out that they use polymers which do more harm than good. </s>
<s> The Shaggymac Optimist Prime lcd spray is the best laptop lcd cleaner I have used. </s>
<s> When used with their microfiber it cannot be beat. </s>
<s> Even with my Sony glossy Xbrite screen, it leaves it perfectly clean. </s>
<s> Also the Shaggymac laptop screen protector pads are awesome...a must have! </s>

<s> I use an Office Depot store brand product called &quot;Screencleaner Non-streaking&quot; and a Scotch Brite microfiber cloth which you can also get at OD. </s>
<s> Spray on cloth and wipe on any off monitor. </s>
<s> I use it on my TV too. </s>
<s> This system is the goods. </s>
<s> JV. </s>
<s> I use a 50:50 mixture water and isopropyl alcohol, moisten a microfibre cloth, wipe screen from one side to the other. </s>
<s> Continue down the screen til finished. </s>
