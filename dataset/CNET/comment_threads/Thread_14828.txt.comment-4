I use a four port Modem Router and you just have to enable Sharing on each pc to allow other PCs on the same LAN (Local Area Network) to see them UNLESS... you run a firewall (like Zonealarm).
If you do use one, go to Start - Run - then enter winipcfg and hit the enter button.
Select the network card you use and it will tell you the IP address (like 10.16.0.23 or something).
Go into your firewall on the other computer(s) and tell it that it is OK to allow that IP address access.
Don't forget to enter the other PC(s) IP address(s) into the first PC's firewall as well.
If you do use a Modem Router, they sometimes come with a built-in firewall which will protect the whole LAN.
