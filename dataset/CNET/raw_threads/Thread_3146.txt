First thing I would do is complete format and clean install of XP on my system or just build my own. Gateway wanted to charge an additional $49 to &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista to Windows XP on a new system. The customer service rep became extremely confused when I asked him why anyone would pay for, and how XP magically became an &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista as opposed to a down-grade. It's to the point that it's just almost funny that the pc user and consumer are now considered the lower 1 percent on the intellectual scale!

The downfall we have found is that software that we need like Microsoft Office is not being put on systems (aside from trial versions). We need the production software but assume this is one way for the distributors to keep the cost down. The problems with vista we have found are that some software and hardware do not have the correct drivers as of yet.
