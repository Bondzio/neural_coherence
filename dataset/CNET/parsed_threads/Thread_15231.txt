<s> I just bought and installed ATI 9800 PRO and it works great in XP, but I also use alot of bootable devices - such as floppys, cd-roms, etc...and as soon as the system bios is done, the screen goes blank and I get a 'NO SIGNAL&quot; message on my monitor. </s>
<s> HELP !!! </s>
<s> I have spent 2 days trying to figure this out. </s>

<s> The system BIOS is set to AGP, I have the 9800 set as default, but I have also turned on and off in testing the bios vga. </s>
<s> Nothing has changed in this computer except I went from a 9700 to a 9800PRO. </s>
<s> Is there a way to reinstall the 9800 BIOS? </s>
<s> IT seems like it's not seeing it - only the operating system is finding it after it boots up. </s>
<s> I also reinstalled the software twice. </s>
<s> You haven't written much. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No signal means ...NO SIGNAL. </s>
<s> Doesn't matter what I am trying to do - there is no signal - shows on the screen the message NO SIGNAL. </s>
<s> Unless I boot to Windows - then it is fine. </s>
<s> Never had any problems with the ATI 9700. </s>
<s> Please go back and read the original message. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> If you want to get uppity when I double check an item, then I'll wish you well and not tell you my thoughts. </s>

<s> I can only guess you had tried to overclock the board with that other BIOS. </s>
<s> But that's just me guessing. </s>

<s> You're right, I am a little upset, but not at you or anyone trying to assist. </s>
<s> I am sorry if I sounded harsh in my last posting. </s>
<s> It wasn't meant personally. </s>
<s> I also understand people getting a little tense. </s>
<s> And I'll pitch in where I can. </s>
<s> As it stands, this is the only trick I know of so far. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am wondering if, because the Radeon card has both analog and digital outputs, this might be a factor. </s>
<s> Also, does your monitor have both analog and digital inputs? </s>
<s> If the above are true, I would try some cable swapping and/or input selection from the monitor itself to see if you can get a screen from an alternate boot device. </s>
<s> Since I just added a new card(ATI), this is fresh in my memory. </s>
<s> Something very simple, but people do forget. </s>
<s> You DID remove the 9700 in Manager before shutting down and changing out the cards. </s>
<s> FWIW chuck </s>
