go for a new computer only if you are having a custom shop build it for you, or you plan to build a bare bones kit.
otherwise, wait till the new computers with &quot;vista&quot; arrive and get a free new os.
xp will go into extended support this december so why buy &quot;off the shelf&quot; when xp has laess than a year of life left?
