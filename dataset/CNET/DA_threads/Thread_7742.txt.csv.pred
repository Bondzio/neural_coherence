1.1.3	Can also throw in a G15 keyboard and a 17&quot; Dell Monitor	St
1.2.1	Sorry, here's the bad news, not much.	St
1.2.2	Tops would be $250 with EVERYTHING included.	St
1.2.3	Leave something out, it drops more.	St
1.2.4	Maybe, if you sold it piece meal it sell more or not, it's an old PC and roughly when you check the pricing for anything new you get an idea what you're up against.	Sug

1.3.1	selling a used PC and the OS disk separately might get you more money.	St
1.3.2	This would only work if the disk was such as a Windows XP retail as you cannot legally sell an OEM copy for re-use.	St
1.4.1	but someone may &quot;love&quot; it and give you more.	St
1.4.2	unfortunately, new systems are cheap and any i5 based system will match the performance of your system.	St
1.4.3	add a $90 graphics card to a new $500 PC and it's better than your old PC and includes a warranty.	St
1.4.4	best to sell to an acquaintance (not a friend otherwise you become their tech support) who wants what you've got.	St
1.4.5	throw in some games/software to sweeten the pot.	St
1.4.6	or donate it and write off an elevated price as a donation.	Sug
