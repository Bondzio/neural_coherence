I have an old PC (Compaq Presario 4910) that I haven't used in years.
Today, I realized I might have some old files on it that I might want to see again, so I hooked it back up.
Unfortunately, after the standard COMPAQ screen and password check, I received this error: Invalid System Disk Replace the disk, and then press any key I remember that in the days leading up to the purchase of my current PC, I deleted a lot of excess files, but I didn't think I did anything to hurt my computer.
Maybe I was wrong.
What happened?
What does &quot;Invalid System Disk&quot; mean?
How can I fix it?
Thanks in advance.
