<s> PS: It's for a game. </s>
<s> you need to share the name of the game or better yet..tell us what the game requirements are. </s>

<s> If I'm reading the specs correct. </s>
<s> It's a mini/micro tower...that's bad. </s>
<s> It has no video slot...that's bad. </s>
<s> It has a 270w psu...that's bad. </s>
<s> It might have a spare pci slot but: Any card to fit that slot might not be much better than your integrated graphics. </s>

<s> Dell mobo's are usually propriety, which means no upgrades P4's aren't good for gaming, minimum AthlonX2, and if you have the money C2D or C2Q. </s>
<s> Build a new system Buy as best of a video card you can, good framerates come from good video cards. </s>
<s> I recommend you shell out the money for 1 or 2 Radeon HD 4870X2's and a xfire motherboard. </s>
<s> Newegg has them for $500 each I think. </s>
<s> If you have the cash C2Q, if you don't have the cash C2D. </s>

<s> PSU something large. </s>
<s> 1200 if your using dual Radeon HD 4870X2's Hard Drive. </s>
<s> RPM matters more than Capacity. </s>
<s> SSD's if you can afford it. </s>
