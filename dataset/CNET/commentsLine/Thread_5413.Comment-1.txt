i just bought a dvd burner...(liteon lh-20a1p186c)...and have already installed it in my pc, but it's not showing up in windows explorer or in the hardware manager...i tried the registry trick where you delete the upper and lower filters but i don't seem to have them in my registry what seems to be the problem...?
please help..thank you in advanced... by the way...here are my specs just in case: dell dimension 4500s 768mb ram intel celeron 1.70ghz processor
