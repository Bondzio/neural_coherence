Is it easier to buy a PC with the processor, I want, then upgrade from there (graphics card, RAM, etc) or is it easier to just start from the ground up. I have some computer experience, and have changed RAM, graphics card, sound card, drives, HDD's, etc. I don't have any experience though with fans, mother boards, processors, etc. I thinking of buying an HP with an Intel processor, at least 2GB of RAM, and upgrading the graphics card, etc on my own. Also, is there one company that is better than another for buying PC's from and being most upgradable. Finally, are there any books out there that can tell me how to build one. Thanks alot!
