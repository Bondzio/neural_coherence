Last week I bought a new PC (compaq CQ5700F-OS Windows 7).
I am using it with my old monitor (eMachines E17T4W) Problem-there is about a 2 inch strip of black from top to bottom on the right hand side.
I ran through the monitor menu, nothing fixed the problem though &quot;Auto&quot; made the black space smaller by a couple of inches.
I did a chat with a compaq tech who could not identify and fix the problem.
eMachines web site offered no help either.
So I turn to you techies hoping someone might have an idea what is going on and have a possible solution.
Note-monitor worked perfectly with old PC (eMachines), it never had this problem.
Old PC has been taken to recyclers so there is no way to plug it back in and see if it would still work correctly with that PC.
