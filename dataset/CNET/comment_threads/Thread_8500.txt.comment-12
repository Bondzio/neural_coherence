I just noticed this is an old thread - dont know what you did to get rid of your data b4 returning it - but the best and fastest - very complete is with a good size magnet.
this will also render the drive unusable.
Back in the early days when drives went out more often - especially WD's - if it was an intermittent thing, the teck dept there would say there was nothing wrong with it and return it - so I started using the magnet - never had a problem after that getting drives swapped.
Place the magnet on the outside of the case for about an hour - positioned to hit the disk surface that you have to imagine where it is.
then flop the drive over and put it on the chips on the circuit board for a minute or so.
One very dead drive !
