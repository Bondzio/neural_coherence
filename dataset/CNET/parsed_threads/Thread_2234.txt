<s> Hey guys I am new to the forum so bare with me :P I've just gotten a new USB hub (Plexgear office ) and when i connect my harddrive to it, the hard drive starts clicking. </s>
<s> It's a 1 month old hard drive Western Digital elements 1 TB Se portable . </s>
<s> But when i connect the HD to the computer it doesn't click anymore... </s>
<s> The USB hub works with any other devices (I am running Linux 10.4 ) Any suggestions ? </s>
<s> I have googled the clicking sound, and the explanation to that is that the HDD is getting old and is having mechanical problems, and that i should back it up . </s>
<s> Again the HDD is 1 month old, i have approximately 100 GB of photos. </s>
<s> I also have my files from my Linuc PC backed up (PC crashing) and 2 GB of my Android Phone (Lag and space issues.) </s>
<s> I am really concerned, please help me ..... </s>
<s> Seems a power problem. </s>
<s> Try a powered hub. </s>
