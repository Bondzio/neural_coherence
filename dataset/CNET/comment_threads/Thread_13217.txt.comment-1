I recently did a re-install of OS 10.2.8 because I was told I had corruption issues.
Since then, I have been unable to burn CD`s, either with Toast or iTunes; I get a message that the drive is busy or reserved by another application, even though nothing else is running.
I just checked Apple System Profiler and the info about the drive (Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-103) states that disc burning is not supported.
I`ve had this computer for several years (G4 AGP with the builtin burner) and never had trouble burning CDs before.
What did I do wrong with the OS re-install and how can I fix it?
