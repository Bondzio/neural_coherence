it wasn't that i ignored your suggestion, i just remembered once before that netgear had asked me to unplug the connection for a while and it helped then.
so i tried it again and it worked well for the laptop, but the desktop got too low a signal to access the internet.
if it works so well with the laptop, i figured it is not the router, but something else.
i will check again with netgear and give them my updated information and ask about updates.
thanks for your help.
