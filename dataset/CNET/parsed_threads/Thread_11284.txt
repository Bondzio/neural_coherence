<s> I am strongly considering buying a Sony RZ 54 computer, but can't seem to find anyone who has one. </s>
<s> I would like to know a little about their reliabilty and support system. </s>
<s> If you have a Sony, would you buy another one nwhen you need to upgrade? </s>
<s> Thanks for any info Parvin Chastain </s>
<s> My neighbor has one. </s>
<s> It instantly caught the MS Blaster virus and promptly had numerous software problems right out of the box. </s>
<s> This issue isn't just about Sony, but when you ask about reliability, it's easy to see that with all the worms, virus and more, a vendor that ships a machine that catches the worm just by dialup up the internet should be listed as unreliable... Outside of that, for the price they paid, I wouldn't. </s>
<s> But they like theirs. </s>

<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Let them take the machine back if they can't fix it. </s>
