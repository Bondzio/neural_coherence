thats someone may have confused &quot;regional&quot; dvd play with drm.
it basically means if you brought a dvd movie in europe and then came to the states, you will prompted with a regional error message on a dvd player brought in the states.
there is supposablely at issue those dvd movies for hd used for blu-ray or dvd-hd are touting hdcp, another name(imho) for drm in hd.
its still in the air, but its gets so confusing that it seems like it was meant to be that way.
none of this should apply to typical dvd players though, only hd.
