hi..im shoppn for a new computer for me and my daughters..this will be out first...it will mainly be used for internet and music and dvd&quot;s...i'd like to stay around $1000.
to 1400 at the max...the 2 companys so far that interest me is hp...i'll get more specific(models) as i learn more...any help will be grately appreciated...thanks again.
:i also would like to add that i want my operating system to be windows xp and not vista....been lookn at a hp m7659n,m7690n both are about $300 more than the other withiout monitor but that's not a problem for my price range...the only thing i did not like is that hp did not document well what was required to play hd-dvds.
the computer is fully capable but you must have a monitor that supports hdcp (copy protection for hd discs) so no hd-dvd will play because of the copy protection and their are only a few monitors that support it $700 and up range.
works fine if you use the analog output but then you loose the real hd experience.
you can connect it toahdcp tv which all tvs with an hdmi import will support.
pc has plenty of power.
it doesn't record or play high def (with a high def monitor).
it isn't geared for that.
confused as to why it will play the high def dvd's, but, not the high def channels.
i'm gonna make my decision this week(as my daughters are gettn impatient..lol..)it's either gonna be the m7659n or m7690n both by hp...i guess the difference between them is the m7659 is an upgraded system in terms of software and harware.the 7659 gives windows media center as an option..???
i really don't know what this means but to me sounds like it's better..but i could be wrong..i've askd hp reps but all i'm gettn back is a sales pitch becuase they only offer the m7659n and they couldn't clear up the hd dvd ???
'sthanks again...
