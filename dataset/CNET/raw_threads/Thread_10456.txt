A friend told me a long time ago that I can simply create a new drive, but even if that's true I'm sure there are better ways. I already searched out Memorex's site and didn't even find the model listed. This isn't a driver issue. I'm sure I plugged everything in correctly and have done this with other machines before, but this one in particular is giving me problems. Anyone have ideas on what's wrong? HP XP Home

The drive must work in other machines (you didn't tell this.) And Microsoft does not supply motherboard support drivers. Your post is so light on details that matter that I can't do much but offer vague areas to research. Bob

The details I do have are probably irrelevant to the troubleshooting issue, as your USB comment pretty much answered the question, but here's the rest I have which is only hardware details that I sent to Memorex: Compact Disc Ultra Speed Rewritable 52x32x52x CD-RW Drive Model MRX523252AJI-1 Part No. 32023257 This Class B digital apparatus complies with Canadian ICES-003

XP without those patches didn't support USB 2.0 and had issues with USB 1.1 so I think we've uncovered one issue. If you have XP all patched up, it's not in your posts so I can't know this. Glad to see that could be it. Bob
