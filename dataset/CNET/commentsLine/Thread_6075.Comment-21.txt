hey dude just open your cabinet and remove your cmos battery wait for 15 min.
then place it back.
start your computer and it will start with cmos clock error.
just press f1 to enter current date and time and mention first boot device.
such as hdd or cdrom.
then press f10 to save and exit.
you will see every thing working fine.
