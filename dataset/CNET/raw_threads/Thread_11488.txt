Recently I started having problems on boot-up where during the boot sequence the computer would freeze when it reached the NVRAM check. The screen will say: DDR Frequency 400 Mhz Checking NVRAM.. And then it stops booting up. If I turn off the power and reboot it then gets past that part on the second boot sequence and shows the following message instead: Overclocking Failed! Please enter Setup to re-configure your system. Then I press F1 to enter the Bios Setup, exit the BIOS without changing anything, and the computer boots up fine thereafter. This problem now happens every time I boot my PC from having been in a powered off state. At first I thought maybe the Ram chips were loose so I took them out and swapped the RAM slots just in case, but that didnt help to get rid of the problem. Now I am thinking it may be a BIOS setting, but I am not sure what I would need to reset in the BIOS to fix the problem. Any ideas would be kindly appreciated.

I have not changed any jumper or any other settings on the BIOS as far as I know. &lt;P&gt; The only recent change to the PC was the addition of one of those optical mouses with all kinds of lights inside. Maybe the extra power demand is causing a problem? &lt;P&gt; Flashing the BIOS is a good sugesstion though. I will start there by checking to see if there is an update available from ASUS.
