I bought the computer used; it was my first (and only) OS X computer and I never did figure out how to back up the startup disk, so I have no way of knowing what was on it.
The corruption issue was that the computer kept forgetting settings for Netscape and other apps, and that I couldn`t start up in OS 9.2 without the computer hanging up during startup.
I did a Clean Archive and Install.
I still can`t start up in OS 9 but Netscape does seem to remember settings now.
I had described my problems on this forum and was told that a reinstall sounded like what I needed.
Thanks!
