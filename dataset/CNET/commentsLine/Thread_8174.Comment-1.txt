i have an epox ep-9nda3j socket 939 amd athlon 64 motherboard that supports sata and ide hardrives.
i am purchasing a new hardrive and would like to upgrade to a sata 80g drive.
i also have 2 60gb ide drives, one of which i would like to use in either a raid configuration or to store data.
my questions are these: will i have any difficulties using both a sata and ide drive in a raid configuration?
will i have any difficulties transfering data from one to the other if i do not use a raid configuration?
do i need to have two operating systems installed on both drives to use a raid configuration?
what specs should i look for in a sata hardrive so i notice a difference in speed?
thanks in advance.
