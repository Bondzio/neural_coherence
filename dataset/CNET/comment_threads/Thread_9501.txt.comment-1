I have gone through 2 3tb seagate expansion drives, the usb connectors breakfrom the circuit board.
I bought a thermaltake 5g.
When I connect the message that I get is that hd needs to be formated.
What can I do to rectify this?
Do I buy yet again another drive and switch the boards?
And does anyone know if I can get a cheaper drive whose board will work on this?
Thank you in advance
