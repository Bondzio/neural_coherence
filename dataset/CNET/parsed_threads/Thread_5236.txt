<s> Hi, I have a DVR which requires a static IP address to be assigned to it. </s>
<s> How do I find one? </s>
<s> It is being hooked up to our network in the office which uses Windows NT 4.0 on the server. </s>
<s> All the workstations are Windows 98SE. </s>
<s> We use a D link router and a cable modem. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Your IP PLAN. </s>
<s> For instance if your IP PLAN is 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254 then you pick one of those unused numbers. </s>
<s> You'll also want to copy the DNS, Default Gateway and Netmask. </s>
<s> Nothing in your post reveals your IP PLAN. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You'll need to provide more description about your DVR. </s>
<s> That's what you'll need to figure out, how (on your DVR) you can access a setup page to set a static ip. </s>
<s> For a temporary fix, if you have other computers on your network, give them all static IPs. </s>
<s> Then tell your router to only give out 1 ip for the dhcp network, and your dvr will always have the same IP. </s>
<s> For instance, set your IP range for the DHCP to 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.2 </s>
