when system boots up, the wizard finds unknown hardware and searchs for driver, i cancel.
then wizard searches for driver for pci multimedia audio device and i again cancel.
in the device driver menu, there is nothing checked red or yellow.
the only clues i have are: keyboard driver idvkd.sys driver not installed, and the cd-rom is set as secondary slave.
there is no primary slave.
there is no secondary master.
hard driver is primary master.
