I tried to put another blank zip disk and still no recognition of having a disk inserted. I was told it may be because its dirty. I was told to get a zip cleaning disk, but so far i havent seen one for sale. Could you guys help me on this one? by the way i got a pc with windows me. Thanks for any help provided

It flies above the media so cleaning is not the issue. Try that media in another drive. Here's why. Most zip drives are approaching or have passed their designed lifespan. Bob

We used dozens and dozens at the office so when we suspect one, we tried the media on another drive in the office. Have a friend with a zip test the media for you. If need be, decide to move off the zip. Bob
