8021	0	561145	5300581	NR	1Chris	4/18/12 1:56 PM	1.33475736E12	Two android tablets	I have two MiTraveler tablets. I can go to android market and search for Angry Birds and get it on the one with android 4.0. It's not even listed when I do a search on the android 2.2 tablet. I don't know if the versions make a difference.
