1.1.1	Hi everybody .	St
1.1.2	My first post here .	St
1.1.3	I have several old computers - everything from 386 to Pentium III and a HP Pavilion 6535 .	St
1.1.4	I no longer have space to store them and so will be getting rid of them .	St
1.1.5	I want to strip out the components worth saving .	St
1.1.6	I 'm keeping the hard & floppy drives and the DVD/CD-Rom drives .	St
1.1.7	The batteries - most of them still keep excellent time .	St
1.1.8	IDE cables and removable power cables .	St
1.1.9	What about the following for the Pentium 1 and up ?	Ques
1.1.10	PSU ( power supply unit ) fans mother boards video card sound card anything else ?	Ques
1.1.11	( I know that these components in the 386/486 are n't worth saving .	St
1.1.12	Or are they ? )	Ques
1.1.13	If you 're scratching your head wondering why I think a Pentium 1 component may be worth keeping , it 's because I 'm using a Pentium 1 ( Windows NT 4.0 ) for non-internet use .	St
1.1.14	Would be perfect if not for the paltry 2GB hard drive .	St
1.1.15	One final question : how does HP Pavilion 6535 compare to the Pentium 1 ?	Ques
1.1.16	I have searched on the internet , but ca n't find the year the HP was released .	St
1.1.17	I will say this , though - the hdd is in an upright position and everything is jammed together to make it impossible to remove and insert cables , power supply cords , etc .	St
1.1.18	Several times I wanted to take this particular computer out onto the street and smash it apart .	St
1.1.19	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Here in most parts of the USA you can get Pentium 4 machines for free on freecycle .	St
1.2.2	In fact I like to freecycle old gear like this because it costs a lot to take them to the e-cycling centers .	St
1.2.3	120 bucks one time for the dead RPTV !	St
1.2.4	So if you can find folk to take such off your hands , big savings .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Personally anything less than a 2.5 GHz dual processor is something I would n't want .	St
1.3.2	That would include Pentium 1,2 , and 3 for sure , and most Pentium 4s as well .	St
1.3.3	When it comes to hard drives , I would n't want anything less than a 200 GB SATA drive .	St
1.3.4	Floppy drives ?	Ques
1.3.5	I 've kept one just in case , but have n't had reason to use it in probably 2 years .	St
1.3.6	Old psu ?	Ques
1.3.7	Probably not worth keeping .	St
1.3.8	The HP Pavillion 6535 specs at http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? cc=us & lc=en & dlc=en & docname=bph05116 say it has a 466 MHz Celeron processor .	St
1.3.9	The old sound cards probably are n't worth keeping because new PCs likely have better onboard graphics , and the old cards wo n't be PCIe which is what most new desktops are using .	St
1.3.10	An old psu is n't something I 'd want to save because even though they do n't have moving parts ( except for the fan ) , they do age .	St
1.3.11	Most of this older stuff would never be suitable for Windows 7 or 8 , but if you 're throwing together to give to a charity or the like , you might be get something working with a Linux OS like Ubuntu or Mint .	St
1.3.12	` Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	will properly dispose of that which is hazardous and peel away all the gold and precious metals they can find .	St
1.4.2	Those old boards used the good kind of solder with real lead in it until it became unpopular with the environmental crowd .	St
1.4.3	Sadly I 'd say that the recommendation to give this stuff to charity is n't a good idea .	St
1.4.4	You wind up handing over your disposal problem to then .	St
1.4.5	I do some volunteer work for a small school and plenty of well meaning people have wanted to donate their old computers but we ca n't take them .	St
1.4.6	Schools need to mimic what kids have at home and also ca n't afford to deal with troublesome PCs .	St
1.4.7	I 'm also doubtful that older hardware can still run newer versions of Linux .	St
1.4.8	I 've a P-4 mobile laptop that wo n't take Ubuntu 12x due to the processor 's RAM limitations ... something about PAE .	St
1.4.9	It will run 10 and below .	St
1.4.10	To the scrap heap is my suggestion .	St
1.4.11	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	If you plan to & quot ; re-use anything & quot ; then you keep it because for the most part if it is n't a P4 and above , toss it .	St
1.5.2	I recycle all the time and truly strip it down .	St
1.5.3	I cut wire for copper , teardown HDs for aluminium and metals and I keep the magnets , all other drives get tossed for iron metal .	St
1.5.4	Large plastic is trash canned .	St
1.5.5	PSU are stripped for metals and copper wire , etc.. Now , if you want museum pieces that 's what you have .	St
1.5.6	HDs that old just are n't woth keeping unless *you* have a need for them .	St
1.5.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
