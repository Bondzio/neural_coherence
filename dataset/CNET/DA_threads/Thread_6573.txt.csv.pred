1.1.1	I'm looking to set up a wireless network at our neighborhood swimming pool.	St
1.1.2	The internet access would be a DSL line on the phone.	St
1.1.3	Because of the size of the pool area, range would be very important.	St
1.1.4	Therefore I'm assuming an N wireless router would be best.	St
1.1.5	In looking at reviews I keep seeing the Trendnet N-Draft Router TEW-631BRP topping the charts in the 200 foot range tests.	St
1.1.6	Anyone with experience with this wireless router that could comment?	St
1.1.7	Or recommend a wireless router with good range and reliability?	Sug
1.1.8	While the various new draft N routers are coming on the market, it looks like the old Belkin pre-N router is beating the new ones in the reviews.	St
1.1.9	Would that be a good one for range if I can find it?	Polite
1.2.1	If the antenna of the wifi can be seen I see well over 500 feet.	St
1.2.2	Not at 54+ megabit but for a public node that's ok. Bob	St
