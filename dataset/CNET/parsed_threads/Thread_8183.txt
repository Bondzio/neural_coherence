<s> Thanks for the links, I read through all the ones I could (my Japanese and German aren't too great though) and it seems most of the people there managed to fix their problems by simply installing new forceware drivers. </s>
<s> I've been installing every version of forceware for a few days to no avail. </s>
<s> Well, I wish it was that simple. </s>
<s> I mostly play WoW - usually in single GPU mode because I tend to get errors in SLI (SLI worked fine in games like Quake4 etc). </s>
<s> When I got the latest official drivers from Nvidia's homepage, Wow started to lock up every few minutes. </s>
<s> I also noticed slowdowns in other games. </s>
<s> So I reverted to older drivers and still had the same problem (by reverting I mean uninstalling, booting into safe mode and using a driver cleaner - I'm thinking this driver cleaner cleaned more than I bargained for). </s>
<s> Then I went back to the latest drivers that worked well for me, version 84.25. </s>
<s> Wow doesn't lock up anymore but the performance, even with SLI enabled, is terrible. </s>
<s> Low fps, lots of hitching, stuttering etc. </s>
<s> Now, as for the MSI drivers: everything worked fine for months after I added the Asus card so that shouldn't be it. </s>
<s> I cannot manually remove these drivers as they are nowhere to be found (not in the windows program list, not cleanable by driver cleaner). </s>
<s> Just installing other forceware drivers doesn't help at all. </s>
<s> I'm quite at a loss here I even checked my BIOS but all those settings were fine (as in, they haven't been changed in the slightest since the last time everything worked fine). </s>
<s> My mobo is an ASUS A8N SLI deluxe, never gave me any problems before, nor did I fiddle with its settings, drivers or the bios. </s>
<s> The cards haven't been physically moved or altered in any way, either. </s>
<s> They both work as far as I can tell, but they aren't using PCIEx16 or any other setting for that matter. </s>
<s> The file that may need updating is locked for any number of reasons. </s>
<s> I've had to boot safe mode, uninstall, clean manually NV*. </s>
<s> * files I find and even dive into the registry to get another clean shot at installing a video or even motherboard driver. </s>
<s> Which does bring up the motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> Latest? </s>
<s> And then we have the oddity that is DirectX. </s>
<s> We get to run it's setup again after such changes. </s>
<s> Not well documented but I'll share my trials. </s>
