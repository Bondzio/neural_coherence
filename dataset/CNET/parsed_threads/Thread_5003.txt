<s> My boss has a Cisco 350 series WAP using an external antenna. </s>
<s> He now wants a functionally equivalent set up for another location, but doesn't want to spend the $600+ of the original equipment. </s>
<s> Wireless APs start at around $50, and I've seen charts comparing low-cost brands (Netgear, Linksys, etc.). </s>
<s> But before going that route, has anyone seen a spec sheet comparing Cisco to other brands? </s>
<s> Would like to see what we'd be giving up by buying a more down-to-earth model. </s>
<s> Thanks Jim </s>
<s> First of all, That particular product you mention (Cisco 350 series) is more $$$ than which other product? </s>
<s> Netgear, Linksys, 3com etc. </s>
<s> also have an expensive product line. </s>
<s> Usually they divided to two catagory 'Managed' and 'Unmanaged' device. </s>
<s> Those expensive product, usually have more software management or Utility, so they can do much more than just (in this case) an access point. </s>
<s> Have a nice day </s>
<s> My boss only asked &quot;Why can't we buy a $125 WAP?&quot;. </s>
<s> This is for his personal/home use, and he does not need a managed device (despite the earlier choice). </s>
<s> But he still needs reliability and security (& an external antenna connection). </s>
<s> If the basic performance of most access points is similar, and the difference is in the number of bells & whistles, then maybe an inexpensive unit will do -- for example, a Netgear ME103. </s>
<s> Thanks, Jim </s>
