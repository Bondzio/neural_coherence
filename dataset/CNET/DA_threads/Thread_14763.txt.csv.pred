1.1.2	How can I seperate their networks without havign to buy 3 routers?	St
1.2.1	You need one of the pro grade network hubs that run a few thousand and then you create VLANs.	St

1.2.3	I've done this before and supply a complimentary internet access but never solve their network issues.	St
1.2.4	If those companies want their own LANs then tell them to make their own.	St

1.3.1	I am inclined to agree.	St
1.3.2	I have an additional 9 offices to manage and I definitely think it will be in my best interest to let them run their own inner-office cabling and wiring.	St
1.3.3	Seems like a bit of a headache to tackle this on the tenants behalf.	St
