Well it doesn't have any IDE slots, at least not that I can see.

And that the current hard drive, which you can see, is connected with SATA?
From a quick Google search I found these: http://www.cooldrives.com/sata-adapters.html I'm assuming something along those lines would be adequate.
Of course I don't want to buy an adapter and find out it's the wrong kind.
