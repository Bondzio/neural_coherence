memory (RAM) might be a bottleneck also.
There's no magic bullet.
Read the minimum specs for the game, and double them to play comfortably.
Remember Tetris, Jezzball and Pacman?
Work perfectly on my 8 years old 200 Mhz-48 Mb-S3 machine.
But World of Warcraft goes much better on 1 Gb than on 512 Mb.
Hope this helps.
