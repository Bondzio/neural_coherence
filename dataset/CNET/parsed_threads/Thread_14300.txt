<s> We have two laptops in our office with the same symptoms. </s>
<s> Both have internal wireless cards, one a B one a G. Both will function at the respective employee's home. </s>
<s> When at the office both can connect to the local network, see other computers, access files from the server and use the shared printer but can not access the internet. </s>
<s> Disabling the internal NIC and using a different PCMCIA wifi card will allow access to the network and internet. </s>
<s> As far as I can tell all the settings in the properties are the same. </s>
<s> I have tried one of the laptops at a couple of WIFI hotspots in town with no problems. </s>
<s> TCP/IP is set for automatic although I have tried assigning addresses but have the same results. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> &quot;see other computers, access files from the server and use the shared printer but can not access the internet.&quot; Let's reduce this to just this sentence. </s>
<s> To get to the internet we need a few things to work. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The DNS (name resolving.) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A route to the internet. </s>
<s> Break down the issue to item 1 or 2. ie. </s>
<s> test the DNS and then the route. </s>

<s> I can't say I understand exactly how to test DNS but here is something I just tried. </s>
<s> I am currently working with a plug in card, all items are accessed. </s>
<s> Ran IPCONFIG and noted all the settings. </s>
<s> Removed the card and reenabled the internal nic, again run IPCONFIG, all the information is the same except for MAC address and IP address. </s>
<s> But still can not access internet. </s>
<s> I don't have the details to see where the error is. </s>
<s> But it appears you need some IT staffer to look over the areas I noted. </s>
<s> You could ask google.com &quot;How do I test my DNS?&quot; and &quot;How do I test with traceroute?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I think not enough information is worse than no information at all. </s>
<s> I don't believe it is DNS but hey I could be wrong. </s>
<s> Running nslookup gives me the same results with either card. </s>
<s> Can't quite see how DNS is related to a specific NIC. </s>
<s> I'll keep looking for an acceptable answer. </s>
<s> Since that step is done I'd check your route(s). </s>
