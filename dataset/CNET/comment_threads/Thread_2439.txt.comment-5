Thanks for the answer R. Proffitt I have looked into the GT220 and 240's and have found this card: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5507336&CatId=3669 It looks good and the price of it seems right, would this card be capable of running 720p movies on my 32&quot; screen without a problem?
