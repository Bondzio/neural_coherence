My question is, if the monitor has a HDMI input, can I plug it to DVD player and watch movies? or does it have to be a monitor / TV? the model I'm considering buying is the HP W2207h http://www.shopping.hp.com/product/display/display/1/storefronts/GM757AA%2523ABA would it be up for the job? playing movies from the DVD?
