1.1.1	Hi all , My boys are interested in getting XBox live ( Internet gaming like Halo ) access .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone have any experience with Netgear 's WGE111 gaming adapter ?	Ques
1.1.3	Its configured for 802.11g at up to 54 Mps .	St
1.1.4	I am looking at this one because of our current network setup .	St
1.1.5	Dell computers ( one withXP Home and the other with XP Media for OS ) Comcast broadband Netgear wireless router , WPN 824 ( 802.11g/MIMO ) .	St
1.1.6	Main computer is hardwired to the network while the other has WPN111 USB wireless compatible to WPN824 .	St
1.1.7	Currently network is configured with WPA encryption .	St
1.1.8	The wireless computer is often used to play WOW and will compete with other computer and XBox for bandwidth .	St
1.1.9	My concerns are : Compatability of gaming adapter .	St
1.1.10	( I expect staying with Netgear should cover that even though the adapter is strictly 802.11g - Yes ? )	Ques
1.1.11	Bandwidth sufficiency .	St
1.1.12	Netgear works well with XBox ?	Ques
1.1.13	Any comments would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.14	Thanks , Jim	St
1.2.1	I assume this is first generation xbox you 're talking about .	St
1.2.2	That particular adapter is not listed as compatible with the xbox , however , any ethernet bridge will & quot ; work & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	By work I mean it will connect you to the live service .	St
1.2.4	However , depending on range and environmental factors , you may notice some lag .	St
1.2.5	There are adapters that are specifically adjusted to reduce lag time on the service .	St
1.2.6	I can tell you from experience that people who lag on Live are picked off and hated for & quot ; teleporting & quot ; .	St
1.2.7	The best solution is , of course to run the system wired , but if that is not possible make sure you get an adapter that is Live compatible .	St
1.2.8	With an MIMO router , bandwidth and sharing with the other wireless computer should n't be an issue .	St
1.2.9	Hope that helps .	St
1.3.1	I hate the thought of wired ( another network outlet to put in and wire ) although it does have the advantage of avoiding interference .	St
1.3.2	Boys do get lag playing WOW now but that may because they have too many programs running simultaneously on their PC .	St
1.3.3	Today I get to clean their startup menu to see if that helps .	St
1.3.4	Thanks again .	St
1.3.5	Jim	St
1.4.1	It sounds like you have a relatively nice setup already , but as far as routers go , there are routers that are designed for gaming as well , d-link makes one of them and linksys another , and they are supposed to improve online gameplay by reducing lag time .	St
1.4.2	Most computers should be able to handle WOW without too much trouble with anotehr program running in the background as long as you have good quality memory and a good quality graphics/sound card .	St
1.4.3	The bottleneck may either be your service ( Cable slows down with increased traffic in the area ) or your router .	St
1.5.1	going on with my sons ' computer that may cause some lag .	St
1.5.2	Today I cut down on the startup programs through msconfig .	St
1.5.3	I 'll see how that works and cut more if it helps .	St
1.5.4	They wo n't like it but the parental controls ( MacAfee ) stays on .	St
1.5.5	I do n't think the lag should be the router/wireless USB as they are capable of 108 Mbps which is almost twenty times the broadband connection rate ( 6 Mbps ) which should cover the bandwidth consumption between multiple computers in-house , encryption , etc .	St
1.5.6	Computer memory may make some difference as their computer has 784 MB of RAM along with a GeForce 5500 with 256 MB onboard .	St
1.5.7	CPU is 1.4 GHz which should be fine for WOW .	St
1.5.8	I 'll see how the startup config works before looking at more memory .	St
1.5.9	By the way , I decided to go hardwire on the XBox setup .	St
1.5.10	For about $ 10 bucks I picked up two Cat5e female connectors , cable , wall outlet boxes and faceplates .	St
1.5.11	I am simply going to wire from the office through the wall to the game room and connect via cable .	St
1.5.12	Already have the junction cable put together and tested .	St
1.5.13	Tomorrow I 'll install the outlets in the wall for the cable hookup .	St
1.5.14	Thanks for your help .	Polite
