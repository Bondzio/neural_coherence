1.1.1	Hello, I own a USB Prestigio pocket hard disk 40GB, that has a password protection.	St
1.1.2	It has 2 visible partitions, 20mb each ( public and AP ) on the AP partition is the autorun for the security.	St
1.1.3	The drive has been set on the &quot;safer&quot; mode - meaning that it is not so wonerable to disconnect without &quot;safe to disconnect&quot; rutine.	St
1.1.4	Even so, I guess the forcible ejection must have damaged or corrupted the autorun file ( even though it is write protected ) so I cannot get the program to start and unlock the drive.	St
1.1.5	I have a lot of important stuff on the hdd, and I dont care about the disk itself - I just want the data back.	St
1.1.6	Is there a way around this?	St
1.1.7	I can't attempt to fix the autorun because it is write protected, and without it - I can't unlock the hdd.	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions and opinions are welcome, thank you.	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Back to it's maker and their support to see what they suggest.	St
1.3.2	My suggestion is to use your backup copy.	Sug
