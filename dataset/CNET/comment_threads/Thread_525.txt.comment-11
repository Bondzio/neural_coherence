The new monitors do increase in height slightly but are proportionally much wider.
OK, the answer I am getting is: The LCD monitors are the way that they are, so don't ask why and just buy a wide-screen LCD like everybody else, or buy a normal LCD and don't expect the height and width to increase proportionally in the future, no matter how logical it sounds, because the bottom line is making money and that trumps everything else.
So be it and thanks for your help.
