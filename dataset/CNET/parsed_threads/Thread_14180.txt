<s> I'm pretty sure my computer got a virus, trojan, etc. </s>
<s> I have a cable modem with no firewall nor anti-virus (I know... </s>
<s> I'm getting them both now). </s>
<s> My computer would bout on in the middle of the night, some of the settings were changed, clock was hours off, but everything ran fine. </s>
<s> I disconnected the cable, and thought all was fine. </s>
<s> Then, when I blew a fuse, the computer rebouted, scan disc found an unusually long file name, and everything is in Safe Mode. </s>
<s> (Although it doesn't state it is in Safe Mode, it looks just like it-- 12 color). </s>
<s> Error Msg: &quot;Qttask caused invalid page fault in module KERNE32.DLL at 015f:bff9dba7&quot; I can still use it for basics. </s>
<s> Is there anything that would find and fix the problem (Scan Disc locks up around 50%)-- free or retail? </s>
<s> Or do I have to wipe the hard drive clean and reinstall everything? </s>
<s> Oh, yeah-- I have Windows 98. </s>
<s> Thanks, Kristin </s>
<s> Try this... </s>
<s> Boot to the DOS PROMPT (use the boot menu by F8 or Control Key) and run... SCANREG /RESTORE Pick the time just before the error. </s>
<s> If all the driver files are still there, you might not have to find the video driver and install that. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> If I were you and this doesn't work, post in the Windows 98 Forum for a bigger support group. </s>
