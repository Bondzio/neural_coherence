hi i'm building my own pc and i require a suitable power supply.
the spec is: pentium 4 @ 3.0ghz geforce nvidia 6600gt 1 cd-dvd burner 2x hard drives a few usb devices 1 pci card for video capture i think this will require no less than 350w.
a local shop has no 400w units but they do have a 500w unit on special offer (cheaper than the 350w they stock).
i was hoping to get a 400w unit.
will it be ok to use a 500w unit even if it's full potential is not required?
will it overload my motherboard???
?
