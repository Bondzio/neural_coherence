IF there is a corrupt error, there should be a number or more info when the window pops up.........we need to know what that says.................if nothing else, do a clean install of Windows, add the applications I listed, update everything including your anti-virus, tweak your security settings and your chances of this happening again will lessen........NO-ONE is IMMUNE.................................
