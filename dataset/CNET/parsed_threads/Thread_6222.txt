<s> In mobile adhoc network which is not fixed, there is a centralized node and other 100 nodes are at 1 hop and 2 hop distances and so on.. </s>
<s> Calculate the distance for 1 hop, 2 hop till 100. </s>
<s> Also consider an other network with 200 nodes containing the nodes at 1 hop and 2 hop from the centralized node. </s>
<s> Calculate the probability of accessing the centralized node and also compare the probability of both network with 100 and 200 nodes. </s>
<s> There are no such networks so the answer is that you'll never encounter such in real life. </s>
<s> Yes, in the past they tried this concept in the &quot;Ricochet&quot; service and products but it's long gone and a testament to the idea. </s>
<s> Don't let anyone talk you into figuring this out or investing in it. </s>
