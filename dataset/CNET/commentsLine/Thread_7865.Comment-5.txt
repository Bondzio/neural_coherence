but first, i will not intentional take a swipe at others that want to help you.
i'm only an embedded systems designer that wrote some router code in the 90's so my view is from the inside out and recently an incident with netgear has me wondering about them.
on to work.
at the office we removed all range extenders as they created more trouble than they solved.
we moved to waps or &quot;routers configured as a wap.&quot; that did wonders for connection issues.
however we did have to find a misbehaving machine in the lot.
the neat part was that with only 15 or so connections per access point it was easy to figure out it was in that group.
in your case i read all the machines connect to one access point and now extenders.
you may have to think how to get some off loaded onto another access point to figure it out.
and here's a lesson from the field.
ban the 802.11b devices.
your less seasoned networker may not know to do that.
