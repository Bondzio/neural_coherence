Most IP address are Dynamic, meaning they change every day. That way it is harder for spyware, etc. to catch on. But some places need a solid IP address, like servers. People are always accessing websites and it would be very difficult if google's IP address changed ever day. Might be a bad example, but you get the point. To &quot;renew&quot; your IP address: Start, Settings, Network Connections. Double click your active connection and click repair in the support tab. ~Ibrahim~
