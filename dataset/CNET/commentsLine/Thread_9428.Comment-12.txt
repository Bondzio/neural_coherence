heck, if you need the system then buy what suits you.
things are going to change soon enough once ms vista becomes available and h/w, etc will need to change over or adapt to it.
it will be the next driving force of the windoze based systems.
though you can skip along to keep up it maybe a waste to buy a budget system when vista will practically demand higher end componets and/or resources, so it may well pay to wait until it is available.
as i see it a decent xp system is pretty awful to leave just to get the next new os.
alot depends on your needs so decide.
if this isn't a critial time then wait otherwise buy.
understand also things change relativly quickly in computers now, so buy what you truly &quot;need&quot; and alittle to grow on.
