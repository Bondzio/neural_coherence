thanks for responding!
i was hoping it wasn't the cod.
but some people on that site i mentioned described having clicking problems with the zip cd 650 that preceded its death, so i was concerned.
not sure exactly when these cd-rws were released.
i think it was 2000 or 2001. the little bugger is sitting there clicking at me as i type.
*sigh*
