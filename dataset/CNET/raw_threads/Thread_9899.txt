Can someone tell me if the following is above adequate for a graphic design computer - parts quoted by a local computer shop? {I love using 2 monitors and need that capability in a new system} T 2.33 GHz Core 2 Duo 965 System includes 2.33 GHx Core2Duo, 975 m'bd w/X3000 graphics card 1 GB RAM DDR2 667 Fast Memory 250 GB SATA hard drive 7200RPM 1 DVD+RW burner 1 DVD drive 16x reader XP Pro OS [my request] XFX GeForce 7600GT 250MB 570MHz DDR3 Dual DVI 3 port fire wire pci card adapter [my request] I don't want the cheapest or most expensive available. Just something reliable and fast fast fast. I use Adobe InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop. Also occasional use of QuarkXpress. Thanks anyone for your advice.

If you'd be so kind as to make suggestion as to which things would be better?? I don't know much about computers except how to make my graphic design projects beautiful and successful marketing tools for my clients.

I use laptops with GMA 950 and 3000 solutions and it's graphics speed for 2D work (pictures, web, video) is good. In fact I'd rate it &quot;excellent&quot; compared to our 5 year old laptops. The card you selected seemed to be something that a gamer would list. Gaming wasn't on your list so I thought I'd ask. You could leave that off at first and see if the onboard is fine for your apparent non-game use. Bob

I was thinking about trying Dell but thought it would be a pain to get serviced -- if I had to send it back to them, for example. I will ask about the upgrade to 2 GB or RAM adn DDR2-800. I would love to find someone local that could just put the components together for me...but haven't found a reputable person yet. The local shop also suggested RAID1 -- which I was planning on getting. How do you feel about the Core Duo Quad? I don't do 3D renders so one of your card suggestions will probably work fine. I do have 2 monitors I like and to date haven't had finished [printed projects] render differently than what my monitors do. So, I'll keep them for now. Again, your input was extremely enlightening.
