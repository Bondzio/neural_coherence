I've got a Dell DM051 series computer that was working fine till it started re-starting by itself and giving the following error message: &quot;Alert!
Previous attempts at booting this system have failed at checkpoint [ithr].For help in resolving this problem, please note this check point and contact Dell Technical Support.&quot; This is how I tried to solve the problem: 1) Unplugged all USB devices and any other devices except the Monitor.
2) Entered CMOS & disabled &quot;Boot From USB&quot;.
3) Cleared CMOS by removing the battery & moving the &quot;Clear CMOS&quot; jumper.
I did not add any new device to the PC!!!
What else can I try?
Please help.
