<s> Running off a laptop now, I am upgrading to a desktop (the first in years), and I am wanting to use a separate video card in conjunction with the existing video card already existing on the tower I plan to upgrade to. </s>
<s> Can someone lend me a hand with this? </s>

<s> if you want the two cards to work together or entirely separately. </s>
<s> If you're wanting something like crossfire, I believe you need cards with matching chipsets, RAM amounts, etc. </s>
<s> Someone here is probably going to say that you might want to move up to larger PS as well. </s>
<s> In any event, tell what sort of a hand you're looking for and you'll probably get a better response than mine. </s>
<s> If the seller is not answering a pre-sales question imagine if you really needed help! </s>

<s> I agree with Bob, the best thing is to ask them question before buying to determine who your buying from. </s>
<s> You can go to CyberPower site and and ask questions. </s>
<s> http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/ A word of caution, I have never bought from these folks, I have heard good things about them and I have heard really bad things about them. </s>
<s> Do some research and check out who ever you buy from. </s>
