well im not looking to play crysis and i dont have any need for an 8800 yet.
but the memory speed and pcie speed on my motherboard are so bad that i cant hit any benchmarks that my computer should be able to hit.
i called dell and the guy i talked to said it would work but the people they have working there arnt the brightest in the world.
