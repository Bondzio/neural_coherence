Even though the question started out as ranking of Intel's top of the line proc's, it inevitably leads I believe into the top of the technology line in memory.
From the research I've done DDR3 gives you 16000MTps & 25600MBps over a puny DDR2.
So my question then is, if I am going with the top of the top of the Intel line (looks like Xeon so far) especially in a quad config.
wouldn't it just make more sense to marry these to DDR3 to give you the top perf?
Am I correct on this?
Pls clarify anyone on this.
