<s> My daughter is moving into an apartment complex that is supplying wi-fi for the whole complex. </s>
<s> She has a 3-4 year old Dell desktop and has been using cable for her internet. </s>
<s> What is the best way for her to connect to the wi-fi, USB adapter or a pci card also, would it pay her to purchase 802.11n draft or 802.11g. </s>
<s> if a slot is provided. </s>
<s> They're easy to install and configure and they stay firmly parked in the laptop. </s>
<s> 802.11g should be fine. </s>
<s> There won't be an advantage with the n draft...especially if it's not implemented in the apartment complex. </s>
<s> when he turned that desktop into a laptop. </s>
<s> That said, get a PCI wireless NIC for the desktop, stay away from USB units. </s>
<s> He is correct in that unless the complex provides -N, just stick with -G. Unless you can find a -N unit on sale as they are backward compatible. </s>
<s> Wayne Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, Internet connections, Spyware removal, and download free software (and a GREAT chocolate-cherry cobbler recipe). </s>
<s> There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't. </s>
<s> PCI of the type that has a detachable antenna and cable that's not fixed to the card will be less limiting as you can move the antenna for best signal strength </s>
<s> I disagree about the G vs N....always get the best technology you can afford....cuz if she moves and the next place has N and she wants more speed, she'll have to cough up more cash...what a waste. </s>
<s> and she has more flexibility with wi-fi usb...she can just pull it out and nobody can surf for garbage when she is not around </s>
