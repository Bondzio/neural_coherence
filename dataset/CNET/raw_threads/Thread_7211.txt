I've had this problem for 2 months without being able to fix it, so help would be greatly appreciated. I had AMD graphics drivers installed which I downloaded from the official HP driver site, but my programs and games often crashed because of my display driver restarting. I googled the problem, and I found out that some other people had the problem as well, and that it could be because of outdated graphics drivers. So I uninstalled the graphics drivers from HP and I downloaded some newer ones from the AMD website (I now know that this isn't the proper way to upgrade them), and it worked, my GPU wasn't crashing anymore, but after a while I wanted to switch back to the HP drivers, because of some functions missing. So I uninstalled the drivers from AMD and I downloaded the HP drivers for my product again, however this time the installer does not seem to be able to install the drivers at all. Right now I am using the GPU that's built into the Intel CPU, and it's obviously not good enough for gaming. When I try to install the drivers, the only things that the installer wants to install are these: http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2889/ebeb7fb844f04b65aed6907.png And when it's done, it says &quot;Installation complete (warnings occured during installation). View Log for details.&quot; But when I click &quot;View Log&quot; it doesn't show any errors: http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/4568/2a40459816524eb6aa76fdf.png And when I go to my installed programs, the only new program that seems to have appeared is this: http://i.imgur.com/hj0pz1P.png I've tried removing ALL AMD drivers before installing them again, but it still doesn't work. It's like my computer doesn't even know that I have an AMD GPU, or maybe it thinks that the drivers are already installed. Thank you in advance.

My advice is to use HP.COM and their chat or research more on the web (I haven't done this recently so maybe folk have found a better way.) What I did was a factory restore and then install the newer drivers. It appears there are other drivers and apps that are required to make this work but HP did not document how to perform a clean install of Windows so I can't see what else is required. It's usually some chipset (not the GPU!) driver and some helper app. Bob

It may work to install that way, just be sure to select during the boot-up, pick the &quot;with networking option&quot; as well from the menu rather than simple safe mode alone. If that doesn't work, get a 100% feel for what you have. I use PCWizard 2012, maybe 2013 now and install it. Allow it to report what GPU and chipset you have. ID'ing the right h/w may lead to what you really require. I find that using the proper HP provided install s/w should done it right the 1st time, but laptops are a world of thier own. You may want to use your SN# in order to get the right install s/w. Last, i don't see anything wrong using AMD provided installs from their support website. Of course, again you need to get the right s/w as well. You could also do a refresh of the OS install or use SFC /scannow. If refreshing the OS providing it actually installs over itself AND doesn't wipe clean the current install. What it does is simply reloads the OS and returns everything whatever got corrupted. The other method is using the &quot;restore feature&quot; and select a date prior to your 1st changes. One method or the other should work, but again it depends as OEM type s/w can be too restrictive. tada -----Willy
