of inexpensive monitors that are good in the 19&quot; range.
Unless you have obvious resolution, refresh or performance issues, its a matter of support and price.
Got to someplace like Frys, CompUSA or Best Buy and see which ones look good to you.
I've been very pleased with I-Inc monitors from www.TigerDirect.com at 1/2 that price and use them in dual monitor mode at work, both wide screen and normal.
About $149 - $169 after a mail-in rebate (usually).
