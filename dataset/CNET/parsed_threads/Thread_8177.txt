<s> &quot;What exactly does liquid cooling cool off?&quot; In the case of desktops, the current models cool the CPU. </s>

<s> As Bob says, the CPU. </s>
<s> Just like your automobile, the PC has an &quot;engine&quot; that gets hot and can get hot enough to stumble and fall without adequate cooling. </s>
<s> Mostly this occurs when one attempts to push the CPU beyond it's reasonable capabilities....for who knows what good reason. </s>
<s> Liquid cooling systems are similar in concept to automobile cooling systems in that they circulate cooled liquid to the &quot;engine&quot; and hotter liquid away in an enclosed system. </s>
<s> Hopefully it will never leak or more than the CPU may be damaged. </s>
<s> my computer runs so hot now, that i have a 12inch fan blowing directly into the case, so, water cooling might be my only other option, thanks </s>
