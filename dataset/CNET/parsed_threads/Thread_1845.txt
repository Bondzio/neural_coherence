<s> PC with printer attached is Windows XP Home SP2. </s>
<s> Running McAfee. </s>
<s> Printers have &quot;enable sharing&quot; turned on (the little hand icon appears). </s>
<s> Laptop is Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> Running Norton. </s>
<s> When I tell the laptop to search for printers on the wireless network, it never finds them. </s>
<s> I should note that my previous laptop (Windows XP) never had an issue connecting to the same PC's same printers that I am trying to connect to now. </s>
<s> Very strange. </s>
<s> Is this a Vista -&gt; XP issue? </s>
<s> I have poked around in the McAfee setting and I don't see anything obviuos blocking the printer sharing. </s>
<s> Also, as I mentioned, it worked fine with my old laptop, and I haven't touched the McAfee settings. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> There's a special thing to be installed for it to cooperate in a mixed Vista XP setup. </s>
<s> See the forum sticky. </s>
<s> Interesting. </s>
<s> I don't know about this Vista thing. </s>
<s> I'll try and find it in the sticky and give it a whirl. </s>
<s> can be found here. </s>

<s> OK, I installed that patch on the XP machine via the link to Microsoft in the sticky. </s>
<s> Restarted the pc and checked on the laptop...still doesn't find the shared printers plugged into the PC. </s>
<s> The PC DOES show up on the Vista network map. </s>
<s> However, when I click the PC's icon, it just opens up Media Player and accesses the media I have on that computer (which I was able to do before that patch as well). </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> It's firewall is likely blocking it. </s>
<s> And it will do little good to disable it since in some versions even disabled it still blocks the share. </s>
<s> -&gt; Go try NETWORK MAGIC too. </s>
<s> Norton is on the laptop that I'm trying to search with. </s>
<s> I have &quot;share printers and folders&quot; enabled. </s>
<s> Anyone know a step by step I can follow to be able to print from my laptop? </s>
<s> In case it helps, I want to reinforce that even after I installed the &quot;vista thing&quot; on the xp machine, my laptop shows the pc as &quot;Media Devices&quot;...not like a real computer I can click into and brose te shared folders and printers, like I used to be able to do with my old xp laptop. </s>
<s> If I click the PC's icon, it just opens WMP because it thinks it's a Media Device! </s>
<s> While we can cover accounts, permissions, firewalls and more PLEASE go try Network Magic. </s>
<s> The demo is free and often corrects what was overlooked. </s>

<s> Will this program interfere/overwrite, or conflict with Norton in any way? </s>
<s> Which machine do I need to run this thing on, the PC or the laptop? </s>
<s> Also, the PC can see the laptop fine, and all of its shared folders...just not the laptop-&gt;PC (and hence the printers) </s>

<s> Norton is likely the reason you haven't got it working. </s>
<s> Again, Network Magic removes the need for you to learn about accounts, permissions, firewalls, network names and more. </s>
<s> If you want to do it manually, please check each area in depth. </s>
