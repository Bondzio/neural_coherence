thanks bob.
that is exactly what i needed to know.
you know, that kind of sucks about the os.
i am sure of my decision now: installing new drive as master and fresh os install.
that's the way i'll feel most comfy.
i can copy all my graphics to cd and erase the old drive.
my art is the only important thing.
