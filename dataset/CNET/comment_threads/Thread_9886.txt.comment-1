hi, i am moving and i have HP 6122 printer-- the thing jutting out the back comes off so the rest can fit in the original packing styro, but now I don't know where this rear mechanism goes-- doesn't seem to fit anywhere.
I seem to recall this was an add-on to allow double sided printing -- do i just need to find its own box?
thanks - fj
