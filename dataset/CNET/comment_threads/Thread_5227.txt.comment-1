I want to build my first gaming pc, but I dunno wut CPU to get i have all the other parts picked out but I dunno if I should go with a AMD Athlon X2 5200+ or a Intel Core 2 Extreme QX6700 or the Intel core 2 Extreme X6800.
Everyone tells me to go with AMD then others tell me to go with Intel, can I get some advice?
?
