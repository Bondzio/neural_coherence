well OK - didn't know there was such a thing.
I'll check it out.
thanks.
Re your reference to permissions, etc - I wouldn't think that would be the problem since it was working before, and none of that was changed (unless something in a windows update changed them - they change all kinds of stuff...arrggh).
Thanks for your time.
