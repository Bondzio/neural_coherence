the lesson is simple.
keep what you can wired.
wifi is shared space do with one machine you get all that it can be.
add one machine and it can drop to less than half and even more as the other machine now chatters to stay connected.
it all goes downhill from there.
mixing in that 802.11g brings it all down to 802.11g speeds in all the tests i've done.
so we have post 18 or about that in the forum sticky about using a wifi router as a wap to give the airspace more capacity.
that's what i would do.
&quot;how can i get something out of it, like the 300mbps it says on the front of the box?&quot; that's under ideal conditions and in some lab.
if you get close to half that your setup is fine.
