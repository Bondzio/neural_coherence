Thanks all for your suggestions.
About the OS: Bob, I use a non sp XP cd, you're right.
The weird thing is that once I installed the OS, everything seemed to work, untill I rebooted.
I'll try to borrow a friend's vesion.
By the way, I cleared the old XP before I started install.
About the Power supply: I'm not at home currently.
I'll post the values tomorrow.
Thanks all, Claus
