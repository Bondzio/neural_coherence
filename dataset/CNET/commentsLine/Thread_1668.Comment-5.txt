thanks tharpeli, but unfortunately i live in canada.
i think i will upgrade my bios and then see what the local tech shop can do.
r. proffitt, i was just curious as to what method you use to upgrade the bios.
the gigabyte website has three utilities, one updates from the operating system, one searches the internet and the other is through dos.
i just want some more advice because i really don't want to screw this up.
