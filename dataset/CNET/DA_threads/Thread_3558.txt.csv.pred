1.1.1	Hi All I have a 7 & quot ; Zeki tablet that was working well and then one day , I turned it on and I got a white screen with a distorted black line running through it .	St
1.1.2	It resembled a picture from an old etch-o- sketch .	St
1.1.3	Any ideas on what the issue could be ?	Ques
1.2.1	Most tablets are never repaired for reasons such as no spare parts , no service manual and of course the old B.E.R .	St
1.2.2	issue .	St
1.2.3	What is BER ?	Ques
1.2.4	For example this tablet seems to go for under 90 bucks and a service counter here is over 100 .	St
1.2.5	It does not make sense to fix such a thing but to replace it .	St
1.2.6	You bring up a good point such as should products be offered that are not going to be repaired ?	Ques

1.3.1	This would't surprise me much .	St
1.3.2	Planned obsolescence .	St
1.3.3	Thanx	St
1.4.1	If you are in the repair business there is a minimum counter charge of about 100 bucks .	St
1.4.2	So if any product is less than that , then it 's BER .	St
1.4.3	This was not planned at all but the consumers want products that are cheap and we got there by designing out parts that would add cost to the product .	St
1.4.4	As you pass the 100 buck mark in parts you can drop more parts such as screws since it 's not going to be opened for repairs .	St
1.4.5	The price continues down after that .	St
1.4.6	The cheapest tablets in bulk run 50-60 bucks wholesale by the container load .	St
1.4.7	Would you be willing to pay more for a serviceable product ?	Ques
