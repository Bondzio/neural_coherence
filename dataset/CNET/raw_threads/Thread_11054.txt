With ATI's improvement on the x1600 they are about the same in power, and when ATI improves its drivers the x1600 should be even more powerfull. The x1600 is also a newer technology that has more features. So I have decided to go with the x1600 now Im not sure what brand to get Im deciding between the Powercolor x1600xt or the HIS x1600xt ICEQ turbo. They both have the same stats but the HIS has their special cooling/overclocking technology, but I havent heard much about HIS as a brand. I guess I just want to know is this turbo cooling a big joke or is HIS a good brand to go with. However powercolor in my experiences seems to be a respectable brand. note I do overclock when needed so if it is a good technology I would make use of it. At max i will run 3 screens but for the most part i will probably game on one. if my system stats matter i (or will have for crossfire) the amd 3800 venice, 1gb of ocz performance enhanced latency ram, A8r-mvp mobo, and the hiper type r 580 wat sli/crossfire psu thanks

10090	5	145949	1633199	1633183	keabler	12/28/05 8:00 PM	1.1358E12	... what	x1600 xt http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814161160 i dont think tha could fit in a note book and id have to argue that the rereleased x1600xt is about the same as a 6800gs im not a know it all when it comes to video cards but doesnt the core clock and memory clock have the greatest effect on performance and the x1600xt has the lead in that by quite a bit

I suggest not getting x1600s, wait for the x1700s or just get the 6800gs. The performance of the x1600s can't beat a 6600GT, when they're supposed to compete with the 6800gs. Roger
10090	7	145949	1633288	1633269	keabler	12/28/05 8:57 PM	1.13580342E12	thx	alrighty dude thanks alot i i would wait for the x1700 cuz my x800pro does alright but my parents r putting a puter together and said they would buy my psu mobo and vid card so it wouldnt cost me all that much to go to dual video cards. i think im going to go with a couple of 6800gs's and an a8n-sli, but id like to get the new a8n-sli premium ai life but its a bit much for a mobo

It ofers 2 GS's and a PSU. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1696973&CatId=0

10090	11	145949	1633435	1633403	Eddiefromalienwarecomps	12/28/05 10:13 PM	1.13580798E12	Get the 7800gt	Provides way better performance than the GS and at a solid value. Dual GTs running in SLI beat dual X850XTs PE in Crossfire. Get the 7800gt, you will be much happier. Check this 7800GT out, it comes overclocked. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1699446&Sku=P450-7814

10090	13	145949	1633460	1633452	Eddiefromalienwarecomps	12/28/05 10:29 PM	1.13580894E12	Tough choice	Get the dual 6800GS then. I'd also get some memory like 1gb for the whole PC. You may get more depending on your needs, but 1gb should be fine. Also, rememeber don't ever skimp on the PSU. Get a good high quality PSU from a reputable company such as Thermaltake. Make sure the PSU has plenty of volatage so it can handle the cards running in SLI. You many want to look for a PSU has the SLI tag which certifies it can run SLI. This is a good PSU for your SLI cards. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817151025

10090	15	145949	1633468	1633460	keabler	12/28/05 10:34 PM	1.13580924E12	psu	its a new psu i looked into it read some reviews and it is suppose to be good its 122 dollers and is suppose to run quite and provide good power. i kinda thought of this as a quality indicator but i read the fan stays on after you turn your puter off to cool it down
10090	16	145949	1633478	1633462	Eddiefromalienwarecomps	12/28/05 10:37 PM	1.13580942E12	SLI will be useful in the future.	As games get complexed, SLI will be there for those games. Primarily right now, SLI will give your more FPS in higher resolutions than a single card solution. People with great monitors and have say dual 7800GTX running in SLI will be able to see every detail of games in a resolution of 1600x1200 with the games running smoothly. SLI allows the games to run in the higher resolutions.

10090	18	145949	1633517	1633403	keabler	12/28/05 10:59 PM	1.13581074E12	m'kay	ok i was talken to my friend and im not sure what brand to get of 6800gs cuz i know pny is a very high quality brand but its a bit more expensive is it worth getting or should i jsut stick to xfx or somethen else
10090	19	145949	1633527	1633517	Eddiefromalienwarecomps	12/28/05 11:08 PM	1.13581128E12	They are all basically the same	They are all basically the same but others might have a higher clock speed, or might come overclocked, etc. Get the cheapest one you can find and that will serve you fine.

10090	23	145949	1638343	1634347	keabler	12/31/05 2:02 PM	1.13603772E12	hmmm	i got a 19&quot; dell ultra sharp monitor i like it it not a gaming monitor the refresh rate is only 78 but it works good so a higher res will be good for me and for me sli wont cost much cuz im selling my old mobo and psu(my parents r buying them) my mobo will cost me like 20 and my psu will cost me like 30 and then my video card costs about the same so all i really have to spend money on is the second video card all in all i plan on spending about 300 ish

Meaning power of vid cards will be limited, You'll still get good performance, but it will be limited somewhat, the only advantage is parody raid anyway. Reccomending to just get the deluxe model, It's cheaper too.
