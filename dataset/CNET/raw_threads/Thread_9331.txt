I'm following the same parts as the $647 pc recommendation from the magazine maximum pc. the parts are: CPU: AMD Anthlon II X4 620 MOTHERBOARD: Gigabyte GA-MA74GM-S2 MEMORY (RAM): Patriot 4GB DDR2/800 VIDEO CARD: Sapphire Radeon HD 5770 HARD DRIVE: Seagate 500GB Barracuda 7200.12 CD DRIVE (OPTICAL DRIVE): Samsung SH-S223C POWER SUPPLY: Cooler Master RS-460 the recommended case was &quot;Rosewill R220&quot; but apparently they aren't in production anymore. I don't know much about computer cases so I need some help on finding the right case that's affordable at a decent price and supports those parts. Also, if there's other recommendations on other parts, please let me know. Thanks.

Is there anything in particular I should be aware of when finding a case? How will I know if it'll fit my video card since I've heard that some cases have problems fitting newer video cards. I'm not sure if this is true or not so I want to make sure.
