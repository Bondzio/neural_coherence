<s> I currently have 2 Seagate 500GB SATA II HDDs in a RAID 0 array with 128k stripe. </s>
<s> The RAID controller is an Intel Matrix Storage Manager. </s>
<s> First question, is that a software implementation? </s>
<s> Second, I would like to buy 2-10k raptors and put them into a RAID o for perforance, image the Seagates to a 5th &quot;working drive&quot;, copy that image to the raptors setup in a RAID 0, clean everything but the OS and apps, and then use the Seagates in a RAID 1 array (mirror) for pictures, mp3s, etc. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> Do I need a hardware controller to do it? </s>
<s> Any suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> It's in the FAQ at http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imsm/ </s>
<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> I will do some reading there. </s>
<s> If anyone has any recommendationas they would still be appreciated. </s>
<s> I keep coming down on RAID 1 since it's not a viable backup solution. </s>
<s> I can't count how many think it is but when I delete a file from one, it's gone on the second drive too. </s>
<s> Also I've see the primary drive corrupt and find the mirror is corrupt as well. </s>
<s> A dead end for most in my view. </s>

<s> on an external HD. </s>
<s> If the internal gets corrupted is it likely that they external will as well? </s>
<s> With RAID 1 it's automatic... </s>
<s> I understand that the RAID 1 will automatically mirror the files....is there anyway to check files that are being backed up to the external to determine if there is corruption? </s>
<s> And then to automatically fix them? </s>

<s> I can't say the same for PATA, however. </s>
<s> Of course accidental deletions or copying of corrupt data is a pure loss but I've had &quot;hiccups&quot; on one drive in a set that were recoverable and have lost a drive in a set that allowed the other to run ok until I could replace it's dead mate. </s>
<s> Another time I had a bad power connector that caused one drive to spin down intermittently causing a data mismatch which was recoverable by booting to the hardware rebuild utility. </s>
<s> It took a doggone long time...overnight in fact...for the rebuild...but it did survive. </s>
<s> I'd agree it's not a sole basket to keep your eggs in, however as I have lost other data due to human error. </s>
