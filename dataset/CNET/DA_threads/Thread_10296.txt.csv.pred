1.1.1	i have a hard drive that has virtually failed when i get another hard drive and transfer everything that i can from it , is there anything i can do with it e.g .	St
1.1.2	recycle it or use it for backup or secondary drive or is it garbage ?	Ques
1.2.1	service and that 's EXPENSIVE .	St
1.2.2	Is you data backup up anywhere ?	Ques
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	first , if the drive is recognized in the bios and the drive is not making any noises ( clicking/screeching ) then you might just have alot of bad sectors .	St
1.3.2	I would try the spinrite program ( $ 89.00 but has a return policy that if it does not help you get your $ $ back ) It works by looking at a secotr and trying to recover and if its bad it tries to get the data off the sector and relocate it for you .	St
1.3.3	It has had alot of sucsess from what i understand and there is little risk .	St
1.3.4	If its is making noise then there is a mechanical fault which this program ca n't fix	St
