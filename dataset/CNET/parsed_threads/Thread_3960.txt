<s> Good evening all. </s>
<s> I am experiencing some difficulty getting into my system. </s>
<s> I believe someone has changed my password and I can not get into my system. </s>
<s> I have a dell 8400 system with an XP OS. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with this? </s>
<s> with the hidden admin account and then reset your password. </s>
<s> At the welcome screen, instead of clicking on a user name's icon, press ctrl+alt+delete two times. </s>
<s> In the Log on to Windows dialog box, type administrator for user name and leave the password blank if this account doesn't have one. </s>
<s> Thanks Darton fury. </s>
<s> Now, if there is a password placed on that account is there another way to get in or do I have to rely on that individual to get me into the system? </s>
<s> As you can see, I am a novice at this stuff. </s>
<s> I wont be able to try this until I get home. </s>
<s> I will keep you informed. </s>
<s> I appreciate the assistance. </s>
<s> Is all that's needed. </s>
<s> For machines where the ADMIN account has a password this is just one step harder. </s>
