<s> I have been considering to buy a netbook for basic applications like -web browsing -downloading stuff(download a lot of movies) -watching movies and listening to music -typing and editing documents I am considering Dell Mini,Sony Vaoi VPCM126AG/P and HP Mini 210series My prime concerns are: -Would a netbook be able to pull maximum internet speeds? </s>
<s> I am currently using a broadband internet connection of 1Mbps. </s>
<s> -How much of multitasking can it handle? </s>
<s> For instance how comfortably can it pull web browsing (with multiple tabs on), editing documents,a download in progress while a movie is running simultaneously? </s>
<s> -Could you name a few softwares that are likely to bringdown its performance, the ones I better steer clear of.. </s>
<s> Please help me decide if netbook is a good choice at all Thanks a ton! </s>

<s> Netbooks are fine but you describe using one just like a full sized laptop. </s>
<s> Given a full sized laptop is the same or not much more price why would you sacrifice your hands and eyes to a netbook? </s>

<s> I am looking for something very light and portable... </s>
<s> Something like the old Gateway ex1440u. </s>
<s> It's one step up and away from a netbook and what I use on travel when I don't have to do much. </s>

<s> NETBOOKS HAVE THEIR PLACE....THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO 'REPLACE' AN UPSCALE LAPTOP....I HAVE ONE I USE WHEN TRAVELLING, THEY ARE EASILY CARRIED AT AIRPORTS, CAN ACCESS WIFI WHILE WAITING....ALSO USE IN HOTEL ROOM TO CHECK EMAIL, LOOK UP STUFF ON WEB, ETC. </s>
<s> ...A NETBOOK IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FOR LONG CORRESPONDENCE, LENGTHY EMAILS, ETC... </s>
<s> The thing to look for in a Netbook is to be sure it is upgradeable to 2 GB! </s>
<s> !, thats the first thing I did. </s>
<s> Makes 100% difference in performance. </s>
<s> The other thing is the KEYBOARD, there are differences in how far the keys are apart/spaced...which helps in input. </s>
<s> Other wise, Dell, H.P., ACER, whatever, are all about the same... You could say its a difference between a loaded larger laptop, and a PDA or an email/net capable Cellphone....Bottom Line again is, what are you going to use it for ??? </s>

<s> I'm with Bob on this one, you can pick up a full function notebook that isn't dramatically heavier or much more expensive than a netbook and get a better screen for watching Movies and a more capable multi-threading processor (Intel Core, rather than Atom). </s>
<s> Your specific questions: Will a netbook handle maximum internet sppeds? </s>
<s> Probably not but it will have no problem at all with your 1 Mbps. </s>
<s> How much multitasking can it handle? </s>
<s> Your list looks too heavy to me - you'd be much better off with an Intel Core processor than an Atom that sacrifices performance for lighter weight (of the whole unit) and battery life. </s>
<s> I am trying out an Acer Aspire with 1G RAM & 250G memory. </s>
<s> It is very, very slow; the touchpad is very skittish no matter how I adjust it; and it simple is not powerful enough to have multiple screens open. </s>
<s> I'm extremely disappointed and am returning it (I purchased on a TV shopping channel that gives me that ability to return with no restocking fee). </s>
<s> But, I do like the portability and long battery life. </s>
<s> There is an HP Pavilion DM1Z that has an 11.6&quot; screen, 3G RAM, 320G hard drive, and you can select a Turion dual core processor for about $525. </s>
<s> It only weighs in at 3.25 lbs. </s>
<s> according to specs. </s>
<s> I'm seriously considering this purchase since I would be able to multi-task, not be so frustrated by slowness, and still have portability. </s>
