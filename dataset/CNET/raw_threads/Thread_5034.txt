Since my old drive has no cs setting wouldn't I just set them as master and slave? Would this cause any problems? I don't mean to sound like an idiot but it has been 8-10 years since I have done this! Somewhere I read that because one is ntfs and the other fat32 there might be problems? Thanks Mike

The question is what can you cable the old HDD to in the new system ? Is the hard drive in the new system connected to the hard drive by a long skinny cable (SATA) or is it connected to the hard drive by a wide flat cable (PATA)? Perhaps it would help if you identified new system's HDD...make and model number. VAPCMD
