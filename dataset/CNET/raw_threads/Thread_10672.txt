I just got a new LCD Samsung SyncMaster 930B I must say, I'm fairly dissapointed at the fact that no DVI cable was included. I was wondering if there was a big difference between DVI and analog. Also, how can I check for any problems on my monitor, such as dead pixels etc. I have noticed some backlight leakage when I set the screen black, is this a major issue? Where can I buy cheap DVI cables? The only ones I found are $170 Monster Cable ones.

But I have heard many people claim that there is a signifigant advantage to using DVI over analog. I was wondering what your opinions were on this topic?

I saw a monster tv DVI cable for $170 and then I found this http://www.anitec.ca/?mode=product_detail&pid=2300&mcid=16 for $20 what makes the monster tv cable cost $150 more? I might just get the $20, cause the price isnt that bad.

Im just going to stick with analog. Is backlight leakage a big deal? Because it only shows up when the screen is black... I could return it if its a big deal as I bought from FS

I wasn't looking real hard however. This is kinda subjective. Some ppl will notice a diff while others won't be able to see it for the life of them. Only way I can tell u for sure for my model LCD is if i had 2 of them side by side, but htat' won't happen with only one LCD monitor of that model.

Ive got an NEC multisync LCD.....seemed to me, good computer(Alienware ...Nvidia 6600gt) good monitor.....yet after switching the included monitor cable( you'd think alienware would include it as well or at least offer it on there website.....regardless luv the thing anywayz ) either way made the trip to &quot;Fry's electronics&quot;(Las Vegas....based in California) was like $60. switching back n forth.....&quot;seemed&quot; to me that the screen seemed to refresh or &quot;pop&quot; up faster WITH the DVI cable than wothout. If indeed using a Utility, Movies or Gaming where it makes the most difference (Clairity, Refresh) then Definately GO DVI.If not applicable then save yourself a few bucks.

The DVI produces a MUCH crisper display. Others apparently have different results, but I am sold on DVI. Like you, I find it irritating that not all monitor manufacturers include the DVI cable. I got an NEC monitor for my daughter and it only had the Analog cable. I did find a good deal on DVI cables by looking on e-bay. Some are as low as $8 including shipping costs. Good luck.
