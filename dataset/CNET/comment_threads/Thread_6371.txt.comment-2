checkit's &quot;memory allocation error&quot; is a software problem in checkit... it is not an indication of a hardware problem.
try downloading everest ( http://www.lavalys.com/ ) and use its memory tester.
it takes a while to count and test 2gb of ram.
you can skip the mem test by enabling &quot;quick boot&quot; in the bios boot menu.
