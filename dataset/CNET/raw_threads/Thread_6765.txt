Anyway, I was able to start up in Safe Mode, and I had something like 5.8 GB of space on that computer's hard drive. I decided to re-install. I made a boot disk, and typed FDISK to re-partion my hard drive. I deleted by old partitions, and made a new one. When it asked if I wanted to use the maximum space for my partion, I hit yes. It said 508 MB. I figured something was wrong, so I restarted, and did the process of FDISK over. This time, instead of clicking yes to the maximum, I just set the value of space to be used on the partion I wanted (in percent) to 99%. It came out as like 500 MB. What happened!? It's like my hard drive was randomly reduced to 1/10 the size! Any ideas? My first thought was that the hard drive was shot, but I later proceeded to install Windows 98 on it, so I fail to see how only 90% of it was ruined... Any suggestions as to where to go would be helpful. Thanks, GarciaOwens By the way, I'm 100% sure that my hard drive -was- very near 6 GB, so it's not just be seeing things or something.

There was also an update to FDISK. Even if you downloaded that it DID NOT automatically insert the new version into the file that makes the Boot floppy. You must do that manually, either on the floppy as just for that floppy or in explorer to replace the old FDISK that is in the boot disk file. For large drives the FDISK works just fine, however then the format reports the incorrect size, however if you proceed it actually formats the drive correctly.
