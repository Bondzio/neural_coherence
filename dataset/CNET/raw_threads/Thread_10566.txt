Lots of pundits out there but I'm sticking to what I think are nice enough machines. Here's my short list for gaming today. 1. Dual core or better. 2. 2 to more GB RAM. 3. A current OS. 4. Cards over the 100 buck mark from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-radeon,2151.html Having said that, my game rig is a paltry dual core 2+GHz, ATI 3850, XP SP3, etc. Still nice enough but I'm not an avid gamer.
