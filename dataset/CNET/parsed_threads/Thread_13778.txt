<s> Recently i bought q8400 Quad Proceesor and Intel DG43GT Motherboard but its giving CPU fan Error in the startup.If i disable CPU fan warning from the BIOS then it doesnt give the Error. </s>
<s> Can anybody help me. </s>
<s> If this is the stock cpu fan that came with the cpu kit, then be sure to mount it correctly. </s>
<s> Then assure you're using the proper cpu fan power connection on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and set the bios for such, etc., as required. </s>
<s> Now, verify if any temp setting that too is set to default(for now). </s>
<s> Check all bios setting as these bios setting get spread out all over the menu when in bios, check it out anyways. </s>
<s> Save any changes, etc. </s>
<s> and save upon exit and check results. </s>
<s> If not a stock cpu fan, again be sure its mounted correctly. </s>
<s> Proper thermo paste, etc. </s>
<s> and fan what direction it blows, on or off the cpu. </s>
<s> Its important as best operation may dictate that but each vendor may follow their best situation. </s>
<s> Of course, the HSF setup is graded for your cpu installed. </s>
<s> It actually provides info that Q8400 is listed and not some quad-cpu rated, below that. </s>
<s> Take this advice, &quot;do not take anything for granted&quot;, check it and verify before damage can result. </s>
<s> Also, don't disable the warning, once properly set it should become stable. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Are you using the stock Intel HS fan ? </s>
<s> And you're sure the fan is connected to 'processor fan header (4-pin)' ? </s>

<s> Thanks for the advice,its a stock fan i removed and fixed several times but still i am getting the same warninig error,what should i do now.HELP </s>
<s> Since this is a stock fan, then it must be using the same wiring as its mtrbd. </s>
<s> connection, thus a 4-pin for 4-wire plug, etc.. </s>
<s> If not, then that's not correct. </s>
<s> Also, because you've mounted this several times, you may have defeated the thermo tape scheme of application(you did remove the protective cover?). </s>
<s> You can simply clean/remove the thermo tape application and use Arctic Silver in its place. </s>
<s> Last, you need a bios update as this mtrbd. </s>
<s> takes several different cpus, it could have been stocked too long and a bios update correct this glitch, but aware of what if any bios updates does. </s>
<s> You problem should be a simple fix or re-running the correct install. </s>
<s> Otherwise, it boils down to some outside error you have no knowledge of. </s>
<s> Its a manufacturing glitch, mis-wiring, bad cpu or bad mtrbd. </s>
<s> in some fashion or even possible weak PSU. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Sometimes you get an error message if the fan RPM is below a certain (user designated) level or because the CPU is running above a default temp. </s>
<s> If checking and or changing the settings don't help... go direct to Intel for tech support. </s>
<s> Let us know the outcome. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> First of all i will thanks to everybody for helping me, I have updated the BIOS of the motherboard and problem got solved but one advice i will give when i started updating bios the display gone blank for 10 mins and after that bios update process got started. </s>
