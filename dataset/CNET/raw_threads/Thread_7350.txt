I have speedfan, a program that monitors fan speed, temperature, and has a S.M.A.R.T. drive utility to show the health of the HDDs installed. On my laptop, there are no drives shown, whereas my desktop shows my drive just fine, so I was wondering if my drive might not be supported, or something? I even tried hddtemp in Linux, and while it gave me the HDD's temperature, it did not tell me anything about the health of the drive. Notebook model: HP Pavilion dv2915nr Drive model: Toshiba MK2552GSX Software used: speedfan (Windows) & hddtemp (Linux)

So no worries that SMART doesn't see some piece of hardware, the author probably hasn't gotten around to your particular hardwares yet.

As for the suggestion that speedfan doesn't have a complete database, I can accept that. Speedfan links to an external website to show more detailed results ... is there any way I can visit that site without using speedfan, and get the results for my drive?
