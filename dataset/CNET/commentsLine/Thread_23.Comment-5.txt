thanks... i found that bout 2 seconds after i posted.
i didn't even get to follow all of the instructions on netgear when started to work.
it seems to work fine now (at least the ics is working right) still working on getting the network to show up on my pc, but i think that's another issue alltogether.
also, i can't access my router now.
it keeps trying to access the modem instead, even though i renamed the router ip to 192.168.1.99, it keeps showing me the modem which is 192.168.1.1. any idea why this is a problem?
i'll keep trying, and thanks for the help.
it was far easier to use than i was trying to make it.
