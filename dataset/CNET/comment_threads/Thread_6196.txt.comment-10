I tried the above solution, didn't work, but I don't think I did it correctly.
There were three slots; one was empty and had no ribbon.
The second one was connected to the CD Drive and it had a slave port.
The third one was connected to the primary hard drive but had no slave port.
I connected my laptop hard drive through an adapter to the secondary hook-up of the second ribbon (didn't work), then disconnected the CD drive and connected the end of the ribbon to my laptop hard drive, still didn't work.
The screen would blip on and there would be a loud beep from the machine and it would say that the hard drive couldn't be detected.
I'm thinking that the ribbon connected to the primary hard drive needed a slave port.
Can anyone correct me if I'm wrong?
