have you tried to boot from the old copy of xp or from your system restore?
you wont want to start a restore or anything but it seems like you just need to be able to access the hardrive to get your files out.
and for the future, i would recommend that you get a backup program and a nice, fat external hdd.
1tbs run for around $200 or less now i think.
