<s> I have an old computer with no USB, just a parallel port. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend an ink jet printer that still uses parallel ports--and can be run with Windows 98? </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>

<s> I do see such at the local stores so it may be time to go shopping. </s>

<s> Most newer and definelty cheaper end model don't have LPT ports, just USB. </s>
<s> You really need to check the specs on anything that interests you. </s>
<s> However, if you find no such creature, try adding a USB pci card, that will allow use of newer printers. </s>
<s> Just be sure to request one that supports USB2.0 vs 1, but it should anyways for most newer USB cards, just ask. </s>
<s> To check specs on ainkjet model, visit the makers support website for info/details that refelect your model. </s>
<s> It seems only laserjets come with any ports to attach as it were. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
