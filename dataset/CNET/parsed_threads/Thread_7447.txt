<s> I have enabled file sharing on the 98 computer and have both of them in the same workgroup. </s>
<s> XP can see the other computer but can't access any files. </s>
<s> The 98 computer doesn't see any of the network. </s>
<s> Both computers are routed thru DLink 624 and are able to access internet at the same time. </s>
<s> Where can I find more info on configuring this system? </s>
<s> I looked at several sites but they all pertained to using 2000 and 98 together. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Got a firewall? </s>
<s> You have to enable a trusted zone. </s>

<s> I got it. </s>
<s> Used www.wown.com/j_helmig. </s>
<s> I had to enable file sharing on &quot;both&quot; computers. </s>
<s> Then restart both machines. </s>
<s> Worked fine. </s>
<s> I was able to transfer and share folders between each. </s>
<s> By the way, the Dlink (Di-624 router) worked fine out of the box. </s>
<s> I called support about upgrading the firmware because one update on the VDI624(revC3) which I have, said DO NOT update firmware. </s>
<s> Contact your ISP for an upgrade. </s>
<s> There is another upgrade but Dlink support tech told me not to do any of them? </s>
<s> Wonder why? </s>
<s> on my DI-614+. </s>
<s> Works perfectly. </s>
