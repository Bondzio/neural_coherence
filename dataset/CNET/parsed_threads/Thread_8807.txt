<s> Ok here's the deal. </s>
<s> My home network consists of two laptops both sharing internet and files through my wireless router. </s>
<s> I recently bought myself a 40gb external hard drive (connect via usb) for backing up my data from both laptops. </s>
<s> I want to know if I am able to plug my external hard drive into my wireless router so both computers have access even if one is turned off. </s>
<s> My first thought was somehow getting an ethernet to usb device. </s>
<s> Do these even exist and will they with the aim I have in mind? </s>
<s> Comments are greatly appreciated! </s>

<s> Each computer can the access it for files. </s>
<s> I don't think, but don't quote me on this, an external hard drive can be setup to do what you are asking. </s>

<s> USB 2.0 is 480 megabits per second and ethernet is at best 100 megabits per second. </s>
