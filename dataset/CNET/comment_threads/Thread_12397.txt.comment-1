My sound has gone out on my secondary PC.
It is a Gateway about 4 years old using a creative labs soundblaster pci 64v.
It looks like everything is integrated on the motherboard since I see a creative chip on the motherboard and no separate soundcard when I open up the case.
Can I simply install a new soundcard in one of the expansion slots to fix this?
The machine is running Windows 98.
Thanks in advanace to anyone who can/will help.
