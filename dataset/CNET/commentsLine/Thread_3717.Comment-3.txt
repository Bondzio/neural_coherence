i had considered the possibility of a drive going out, but two drives at once?
along with that the fact that the same drive that i burned the dvd with won't play all of it?
i suppose it's possible, but the fact that neither drive will play all the files has me scratching my head.
i used a lens cleaner on the drives today, regrettably didnt help any.
