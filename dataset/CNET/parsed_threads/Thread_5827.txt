<s> I am thoroughly confused. </s>
<s> I have a desktop running Vista, 2 laptops running Windows 7 and a laptop running XP. </s>
<s> I had a home network where we could all share files and printers using my Linksys router. </s>
<s> I had to purchase a new router yesterday and now the Windows 7 laptops are not accessible from my Vista desktop. </s>
<s> The XP is accessible, but when I try to view files in the Windows 7 laptops it tells me &quot;Windows cannot access this XXXXXX.&quot; I called Netgear for help since it is brand new but they will not help unless I purchase a extended contract. </s>
<s> I just found out our Wii will not connect either. </s>
<s> The new router has that new firewall. </s>
<s> Did you configure that to allow shares? </s>
<s> I am on my log in and their help page about Firewalls and do not see my firewall setting. </s>
<s> I see netgear but can't find the model. </s>
<s> Many had firewalls and &quot;client isolation.&quot; As I can't find the model, my guess may be a bad one. </s>
