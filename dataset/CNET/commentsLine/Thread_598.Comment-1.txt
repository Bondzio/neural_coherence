i have a emachines t3120 with a sempron 3100+.
i have tried many times to overclock the cpu but the bios is crippled by emachines.
there are no overclock options.
i have tried to use software to overclock but the overclock is never saved.
it reverts back to the original speed every time i restart my pc.
people have been telling me that it is possible to overclock an emachines with a little know-how like getting a third party bios.
my motherboard is a fic k8mc51g and there is no bios updates.
can anybody help me thanks
