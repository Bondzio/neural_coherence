<s> Two years ago I had purchased an HP Pavillion dv6736nr Entertainment PC. </s>
<s> It had a Samsung HM250JI 250GB HD. </s>
<s> This June, that laptop died. </s>
<s> I purchased a Samsung R580 two weeks ago. </s>
<s> However, I wanted to take the old Samsung HD and put into a hard drive enclosure kit (there's data on it I need). </s>
<s> However, the connector that is on that HD does not match any of the connectors of any of the last 4 kits I purchased. </s>
<s> I even tried a HD dock, but to no avail. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I could do? </s>
<s> Are there any models of enclosure kits that would work w/ my drive? </s>
<s> Thank you.. </s>
<s> what kits did you try ? </s>

<s> So look closely of the mating connections and see what is wrong. </s>
<s> If it doesn't look right, then tell why (with some description). </s>
<s> should have worked. </s>
<s> Are you sure there isn't an adapter of some sort still attached to the hard drive from when you removed it from the laptop? </s>
<s> If you still have problem....might be best to post a PIC of the hard drive ... esp the part showing the interface connectors. </s>

<s> As you can see, this connector is not compatible with any of the kits I have purchased or come across. </s>

<s> Do you see anything that looks like that ? </s>

<s> ...thought of that. </s>
<s> It appeared to me that it was a permanent connector. </s>
<s> Tomorrow, I'll check to see if what you're saying could be the case. </s>
