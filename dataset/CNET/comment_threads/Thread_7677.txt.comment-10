Let's take an iPad and given it's current system there is no virus so there is no antivirus.
But you will have folk that grew up on a PC so they can't accept that.
And they may need months to research and understand why the iPad tablet differs from a Windows PC.
Same story for the XBox and Smart TVs.
I'm unsure if there is a good answer that can fit inside 3 paragraphs but I will share this.
If you were to create an antivirus for the iPad and you managed to get it on the market then you would get plenty of sales for the reason I gave.
Few will want to know why there isn't a virus on the iPad.
They were trained to get an antivirus and they will buy one in spite of the fact.
