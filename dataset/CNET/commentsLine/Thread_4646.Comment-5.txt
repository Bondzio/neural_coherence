despite what ordinary day-to-day logical thinking by us mere mortals might suggest, the idea of a connection vs. passing data through that connection are 2 separate events.
the wireless devices will announce a connection whenever two of them discover each other somewhere up there in the air.
if the security settings on both ends are the same (e.g., none, as so many fools are set; or encryption where both parties know the password; or mac filtering, where the serial number of the client adapter is on a &quot;pre-approved&quot; list of authorized users) the two devices will begin to communicate and pass data.
but otherwise, if the client can't demonstrate to the access point that it has acceptable credentials, the access point will sit there unresponsive.
