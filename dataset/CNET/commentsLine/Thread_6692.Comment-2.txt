you said it was a slave in your desktop.
if the jumpers are still set as such, this could be your problem.
set the drive to cs (cable select) and try again.
now, did the pc recognize the enclosure's controller?
it must see this first.
afterwards the drive should be recognized.
sometimes, however, it cannot read the drive properly and requires partitioning/formatting using the disk management tool in xp.
