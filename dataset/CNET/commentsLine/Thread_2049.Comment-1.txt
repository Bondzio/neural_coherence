okey dokey - so i've got a quad 2.4 with 4gb 677mhz installed and 256mb hd radeon.
system shows 3.25gb installed.
occassionally i get error messages saying the system has run out of available memory and i must close the program i am running.
this happens a lot when i am running ms flight sim x and it just happened again when i was editing a large photoshop file(75mb).
it wasn't a big concern when happening with the game ... but now it's happening with stuff related to my job...i need to get it figured out.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
also..am is my system still utilizing the 4gb of installed memory even though it only shows 3.25?
is there a tweak to fix this?
