<s> Hi guys, a bit of a tricky question. </s>
<s> I will be traveling to the US over the next month and given the usually lower prices compared to the UK, where I live, I would like to do some shopping. </s>
<s> I was thinking about the Kindle Fire HD, but apparently it doesn't work as well outside the US (unless of course you buy it directly in your country). </s>
<s> I don't really need 3G/4G as I would like to mainly use it at home with Wi-fi to watch movies, listen to music, play some games, surf the net and manage emails. </s>
<s> Does anyone know which tablet could be good for me, possibly allowing me to buy apps or other stuff with an English account and credit card? </s>
<s> Many thanks! </s>
<s> Cheers, Fede </s>
<s> You won't be supported by the maker. </s>
<s> You will find support to get around the issues of obtaining content non-existant from Amazon and others. </s>
<s> I don't see how this would be a good experience. </s>
<s> It will work as a stand along tablet but since you have to get around all the roadblocks you lose all the ease of use and more. </s>

<s> Thanks for the answer Bob. </s>
<s> I was hoping that some Android ones would have been less linked to makers. </s>
<s> If that is not the case I agree with you that it's not worth saving money on that anymore. </s>
<s> But your average run of the mill devices are not so locked down. </s>
<s> They are close but not like your generic PC. </s>
<s> You lose a little of the ease of use that the new Kindle Fire provides but you do gain in areas you were concerned about. </s>
<s> -&gt; There is that one thing that continues to cause folk pain. </s>
<s> I continue to find folk that think these tablets will equal the usual Windows PC for content playback. </s>
<s> Nothing can be further from the truth. </s>
<s> That is, you learn to transcode video, shuttle files around and in short, fiddle with it a lot more than expected for video playback. </s>
<s> All those demos are just that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
