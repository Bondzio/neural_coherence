melati, as far as i'm concerned, you are right.
your step-by-step is how i set up this new laser, or any printer...that's how i had the old laser set up.
i agree with not accessing the printer via network places, i'd rather they just choose their printer in the print function of word, excel, quickbooks, act, photoshop, etc.
but the access denied message appears using this method.
so by going into network places, the enter user appears, the computer name is typed in , and access is granted until a reboot.
i thought i had set up this laser identical to the other.
but i guess not.
thanks royala
