hi, i just built a new pc, and this weird chemical smell is coming from it.
everything is running fine, the temps are absolutely normal.
speed fan shows that my core temp, i.e.
my cpu is running at 29 celsius to 32. depending on what i am doing.
when opening my case as best as i can tell the smell is coming from the cpu area.
it is most prominent at the fan right next to the cpu expelling air from the case.
it is definitely not coming from the power supply.
when i have the case closed the smell fills up the room.
it is not a burning smell, more like a new rubber chemical smell, or a aerosol smell.
is this normal?
can thermal grease create this smell as it breaks in so to speak?
last i checked the bios was saying the cpu was at 38 to 40 degrees celsius.
i am a little concerned.
i don't see any melting wires or anything.
is it possible that this could be cause by using too much thermal grease?
