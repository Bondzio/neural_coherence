Grandson had evidently lost the windows cd and backup cd's when moving, so, do not have that aid ( Grandson's comp IS registered with windows though)....is there any other way to get drivers to download free?
Grandson's Mom is helpless with comp and I am just a touch more able, lol...but not much where this area is concerned!
(Grandson is autistic, and if he knows, he isn't sharing!)
Grandson's comp is a Compaq Preasio with windows xp home edition service pack 2
