i had hoped for details about firmware version of the 614, any setting different from defaults and such.
without those i can't comment if one or another would create an issue.
but the 614 is what it is.
while a &quot;maximum performance dual-band wireless-n router&quot; is a nice idea we didn't get the details about the 614 out so you might repeat the same settings on a better router and complain same.
