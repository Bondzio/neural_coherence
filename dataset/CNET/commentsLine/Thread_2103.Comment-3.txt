...to be good to my electronics.
the one that failed on me was a good quality aluminum enclosure called enermax by laureate.
but it doesn't even have a model number on it so it's not that great.
i had a good hitachi sata 80 drive in it and i used to use it as part of my backup routine.
i never had to touch a cable as i would do as you said and just &quot;turn it on&quot; by pressing a power button when ever i wanted to do a backup.
other than that, i really hadn't move a wire or cable or touched the drive because you have to dis-assemble this one to access the drive.
and i was reall happy with it till one day, shortly after the warranty i'm sure, it just wouldn't turn on.
then i tried everything i could think of.
another drive in it, removing and using different cables, and i finally decided that the unit was bad.
that really surprised me because it actually gets very little use and i expected it to last a lot longer.
maybe it was just one of those freak things.
i just thought i would ask and see if anyone else had problems with that type of unit.
