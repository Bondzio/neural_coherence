<s> I am building a new computer, and purchased a dvd rom, and dvd burner (Sony DWU18ABK). </s>
<s> My motherboard (MSI K7N2 nVidia ILSR)has only one plug for audio for the master rom drive. </s>
<s> How do I connect these two and get sound from both, or do I not need to connect this 4 pin cable? </s>
<s> Any help is much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Since DVD audio is played digitally, the cable in question is not required. </s>
<s> Even CD Audio could be played digitally so it's not needed. </s>
<s> Only when you play some CD Audio in analog mode will this be needed. </s>
