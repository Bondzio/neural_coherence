Most NAS will be connected with 100 megabit ethernet.
When a new to server design talks about RAID for file servers it's time to do a little review of transfer speeds involved.
We know that most people will connect with 100 megabit ethernet.
So will your slowest IDE hard disks that you can buy keep up?
-&gt; An ATA100 IDE drive can burst some 100 megabytes per second so the bottleneck is surely not on the hard disk since it's burst speed is some 8 times that of your connection speed.
Think over your basics before complicating your server.
