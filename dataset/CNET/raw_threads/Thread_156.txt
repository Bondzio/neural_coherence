If that doesn't allow sharing WiFi outside your own home (and usually it doesn't), this discussion is a no-go on this forum. So please provide a link to their TOS. We're a law-abiding forum, you know. Kees

Here's the video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBfxbpxosA 50 meters might not need anything but I find folk stick the router in the basement then ask why WiFi is so terrible. Bob

6504	11	585077	5421769	5421786	R. Proffitt	2/8/13 1:30 PM	1.3603302E12	So did you stretch the truth?	I thought you wrote &quot;50m away from in LOS&quot; so what are you saying here? If it's not in Line Of Sight (LOS) then it's not and all bets are off. You can forget about 300 Mbps since that's under ideal conditions such as 6 meters or less with no obstructions. Try plain old 802.11g settings on the router. Bob
