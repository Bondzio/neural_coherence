<s> I have a Seagate external 160 GB HD that I was using successfully over the last 4 months and then all of a sudden now when I connected it via USB (same way I have been doing in the past) it is not recognizing the drive and asking me to re-format. </s>
<s> Called Seagate and they said that reformatting is my only option. </s>
<s> Also checked out a couple data recovery softwares to see if I could get my data back...but wanted to see if there was anything I could do to get the drive working to how it used to. </s>
<s> The drive shows up in My Computer but I cannot access the files anymore....please help. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP Pro and also have a Mac at home. </s>
<s> I was using the HD straight out of the box (FAT32 I believe)...just plug and play before...have all my data on it...please advise! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> I only know what you write in your post. </s>
<s> In XP Pro SP1 and SP2 the limit was raised to over 127GB (reference http://www.48bitlba.com ) Install the SP1 at least to see if the drive comes back. </s>
<s> Also review http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=28919&messageID=328179 for solutions found there. </s>
<s> -&gt; AND TRY THE BACK USB PORTS. </s>

<s> I am on SP1 and I used to be able to access this HD till a couple days ago...I'm going to review the posted solutions on the other forum and see it that works...Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> I did try the back USB ports </s>
