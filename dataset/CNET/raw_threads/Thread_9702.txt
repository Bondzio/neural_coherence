The average is one syetm a day basing upon different specs.The one thing my clients require is a full system recovery option (one button recovery solution)I would like to do the following: - Create a samll partition on my hard drive for drive image and be able to hide it as well. - After fully installing and optimizing Windows XP Pro alongwith system drivers create a full-system image (like the OEMs) - Be able to access the image upon boot (like that one-button recovery stuff used by OEMs) whenever I want to resort to a full system restore. - Also, please advise me on which software should I be using for this purpose which should be reliable and professional. Help will be appreciated!!

I only need to listen (or read) to compalints about hard disk based backup failures to learn that such is an ok idea for a spare or fast copy but is too unreliable to be called professional. Maybe some bootable CD with an image would work. Bob
868	2	118582	1345636	1345557	Fouad Bakht	8/7/05 7:40 AM	1.1234004E12	True	This is something you, me and few others may understand but most people like the idea of &quot;one-button recovery with no-disks-to-lose solution&quot; and probably dont consider the CONS. I initially gave them the idea of a single DVD-ROM based recovery solution and I think I'll press on with it. So whats your advice on this one??

As such, it's never an issue if they have to pay up for it. -&gt; Such restore systems are not free unless you are a programmer. Most will pay homage to Acronis or another company to add in such a feature. Are you a programmer? Bob
868	4	118582	1345951	1345645	Fouad Bakht	8/7/05 11:33 AM	1.12341438E12	Not Really	I wasn't one but I thin i'll have to start off with something. Just integration. How about Norton Ghost 9.0? What do you think?
868	5	118582	1345983	1345951	R. Proffitt	8/7/05 11:50 AM	1.1234154E12	Pricey.	Have you asked them for the numbers? It's a shocker. Linux images are a fav but I can't teach that here. It's a trick of linux and it's fdisk, dd and maybe gzip. When it works it's a great thing and the price is time to make it work. http://www.dantz.com/en/products/express.dtml is another software I find on some laptops and more of those external USB drives for restoring an image. Again, you pay for such a priviledge.

I always use it, and I think it'll completely satisfy your requirements. You could create a small hidden partition (called Secure Zone - because of its inaccessibility to any other software) for strongly compressed drive image and further incremental backups. After fully installing and optimizing Windows, drivers create a full-system image. You'll be able to access the image upon boot, whenever you want to resort to a full system restore. But I think the best way to make sure in it to read review about most popular backup software. reviews.cnet.com
