<s> I just tried to install a floppy drive on my Dell Dimension 3000, but it didn't work. </s>
<s> I removed the floppy drive, then changed the BIOS to not show the floppy drive. </s>
<s> Now, Windows is booting so slowly it's unusable. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Hi, there. </s>
<s> Just reset the bios to default settings, that should put thing back to normal. </s>
<s> Regards, Jim </s>
<s> make sure that fast boot is enabled in the bios..Mine boots in about 20 seconds... ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> some of the startup programs might be using the floppy drive. </s>
<s> That use to happen a lot in win98. </s>
