long live the commodore 64k , basic and whatever that crazy old ibm model was with the big ole off white mouse kinda thingy with the blue button... lol i even forget what stuff was called.
the original macintosh was all the rage but to me the thing looked like a 1000 dollar toaster oven with a stupid little smiley face on it.
and let's face it.. did i use my first pc to program stuff to save the world from endless repetitive tasks or to professionally format that book report on catcher and the rye i submitted to mr. edwards in 6th grade?
absolutely not.
what i wanted to do was kill as many aliens as possible and figure out just the perfect way to sneak that little body blow into piston hurricane as he came sneaking back up after the &quot;come on come on&quot; call out.... not much has change... by the way.. the new macbook pro is awesome.
sorry i keep gushing but this thing is the best thing since american cheese came sliced thin &lt;g&gt;.
