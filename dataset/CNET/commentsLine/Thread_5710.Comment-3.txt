works for me, every time power consumption for computers is a big deal.
for example, a couple of the big names (yahoo, msoft) located new centers near my in-law's home, specifically because the county has among the lowest electrical costs in the us -- the electrical costs are a significant portion of their expense.
another e.g., a single &quot;super computer&quot; will use as much electricity as a medium-large town.
it's expensive in monetary terms, let alone if you consider the environmental effects.
it seems to me the industry has been rather slow to wake up and care - there's just little/no emphasis or interest in consumer markets.
awareness is the first step.
