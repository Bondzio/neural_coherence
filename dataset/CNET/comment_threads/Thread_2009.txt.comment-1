I just went to cable from dial up.
Got five email addresses.
Decided to keep records of which email is used where.
I used one of them for one time, to go to Linux central to buy a Knoppix CD.
I am now getting SPAM mail against that email address which has been used only once.
What can I do to report this??
Any ideas.
