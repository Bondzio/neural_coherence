i got a very weird problem with my daily use machine...it is shutting itself down every 5 minutes...almost on the dot.
it isn't temps, last shut down was 36c on cpu...very cooled off.
i don't know what is doing it, it's not overclocked, i pulled all things that i wouldn't normally use (like my uneeded 56k modem, cold cathode lights) ideas to get it work?
amd athlonxp 2600+ dfi lanparty kt400a 400w psu ati radeon 9600pro 1.5gb ddr ram 80gb hdd sb audigy 2 zs plat.
(w/front drive) flopyy drive 4 case fans 56x cd-rom 16x dvd-rom any thing else you want to know?
i am safe from crashes right now...since i am using my other computer (not a system i like btw)
