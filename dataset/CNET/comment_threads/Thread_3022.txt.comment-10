You wrote that the video appeared on the new Radeon card so we have no reason to &quot;check&quot; the BIOS.
As I previously wrote, your selection of card and machine is not assured to work.
You can read many horror stories about it, but I have supplied what I do to get the ones that will work to install.
If it doesn't, then you won't see any magic fix from me.
