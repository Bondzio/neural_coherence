<s> I just purchased a Linksys srx router , and I have an old dell true mobile router. </s>
<s> Is it possible to extend my network using my old router as a repeater. </s>
<s> with two Linksys routers by turning off DHCP, NAT and changing from Gateway to router on the remote router. </s>
<s> Of course the remote router was hard wired to a switch in the upstairs closet. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> will be the access point, hard wire a PC to it and enter it's web based setup program. </s>
<s> From here you have to see where the settings are that I referred to. </s>
<s> If you mentioned the routers model numbers, further research can be done but until then I would be guessing. </s>
<s> on which do i have to change the settings. </s>
<s> And do i need two separate ssids </s>
<s> TrueMobile as the AP and use the Linksys as the Gateway. </s>
<s> Only one SSID for this network. </s>
