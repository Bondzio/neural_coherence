While you didn't share the message about the bios not installed, there is a common message like that but it is not a failure but informational.
I often disable the message so the owner isn't confused by it.
Many don't know a new drive will have to be prepared for use.
With XP we use the DRIVE MANAGEMENT tool noted in XP's Start, Help and Support.
This preperation is not optional.
