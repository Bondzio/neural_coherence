you are right that it only needs one pci 2.0 express slot to use.
abut you dont neccessarily need any slot for the second space it takes up.
while it doesn't need a second pci slot, it does at least need space available to be in.
so it doesn't need the second slot, but it will still take up all the space in that second slot making it so you can't use it for anything else.
