if that dell server has a bios area for this, check it.
it seems some dell servers when in bios, asks if you &quot;repaired the cpu&quot;, check yes and then will check the hds required to boot-up from.
maybe, i got this confused but if the hd has been repaired as well(replaced) be sure it look for a bootable path.
dell sometimes offers encpyrtic lingo and suggests something but its what you need to check into.
surf, the bios into all areas and verify that.
dell offers similar and better help at thier support website.
