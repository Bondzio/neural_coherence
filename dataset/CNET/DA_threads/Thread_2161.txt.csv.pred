1.1.1	Hi built a new system but things are a bit touch and go.	St
1.1.2	The whole computer cuts out when i try to play gtlegends or after playing Call of Duty 2 for a while.	St
1.1.3	And i guess it will be the same for any other resource heavy program.	St
1.1.4	I bought a 600w PSU for a bit more than 15 and i take it that means its that not being able to hold a stable enough voltage or something like that?	St
1.1.5	Thanjs for any help, i'd really like to sort this out.	St
1.2.1	Two issues are prone to a demanding system; heat a stable power.	St
1.2.2	While a crappy psu can cause problems it is further compounded by the fact, the psu also is the 2ndary exhaust port for build-up not only of the psu but the system case as well.	St
1.2.3	If the system case is &quot;hot&quot; then expect the psu to be that much hotter.	St
1.2.4	The hotter it gets the less stable the psu, crappy or not.	St
1.2.5	Sooner or later it crops up.	St
1.2.6	On top of all that, a gamin system is far more demanding of its componets than typical home use.	St
1.2.7	All in all, gaming is pushing whatever you have to it limits, especially if tweeked to do so, as I've yet seen any gamer not have hi-end options for a game NOT tuened on.	St
1.2.8	if the game itself isn't causing a problem, then expect the componets to less than desired.	St
1.2.9	Otherwise, more cooling and attention to a DYI build system to overcome, heat, improper assemby, weak componets, and/or lousy cooling.	St
1.2.10	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	Hi Vimesey, Wouldn't rule out the power supply, but it could also be either a config problem or a cooling problem.	St
1.3.2	How does your computer 'cut'?	Ques
1.3.3	Are we talking about a bluescreen, a sudden reboot, or does the thing just power off?	St
1.3.4	In the case of the two first symptoms, it may well be that something's up with your BIOS config.	St
1.3.5	I had a misconfigured PC reboot on me without any warning once when I tried installing McAfee enterprise...	St
1.3.6	Took a while to figure out that it was a setting for the graphic card that was triggering it!	St
1.3.7	If the computer just powers off, it could be in order to prevent overheating.	St
1.3.8	Granted, this is usually more frequent with laptops; however, I wouldn't discard that possibility.	St
1.3.9	Hope this helps.	St
1.3.10	Red.	St
1.4.1	I forgot to say its these specs: Gigabyte DS3 Mobo Intel core 2 duo e6300 Ati x1900GT 2GB Crucial Ballistix DDR2 667MHz And my cooling, apart from the psu, is a 12cm fan for the exhaust, 12cm fan at the front for intake, and a 25cm side intake fan.	St
1.4.2	As to your question, there is no blue screen or anything, it just suddenly turns off and reboots.	St
1.4.3	Any idea what bios etting could cause this?	St
1.5.1	Mmmh, can't be too sure...	St
1.5.2	It had to do with the graphics card, some advanced setting of some sort.	St
1.5.3	I could remember it if I saw it but apart from that, not sure.	St
1.5.4	Silly question: can you confirm that both fans are working?	St
1.5.5	Take care, Red.	St
1.6.1	For a test run, leave the cover off.	St
1.6.2	If it works fine then you've found the cause.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	I usually recommend besides the beforehand advise, to remove the side cover of the system.	St
1.7.2	Then if it settles down, you have a heat issue.	St
1.7.3	Understand any componet besides the cpu could be heat stressed and cause a reboot.	St
1.7.4	The psu is prone to such and if the cpu reaches a certain hi-temp(bios setting) it's response is to reboot or shutdown, and/or go into alarm(if on).	St
1.7.5	Weak ram if pushed too much or failing itself can also cause a reboot or lock-up.	St
1.7.6	Try all this and get back to us.	St
1.7.7	tada -----Willy	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	I bought a 600w PSU for a bit more than 15 and i take it that means its that not being able to hold a stable enough voltage or something like that?	St
1.9.2	Exactly.	St
1.9.3	NEVER cheap out on the PSU; it's what's powering your whole system.	St
1.9.4	If it's not stable, then your computer's not stable.	St
1.9.5	If it dies, then your computer (or at least parts of it) die.	St
1.10.1	Turned out i didn't see BSOD because my computer was set to not show me.	St
1.10.2	Now i've seen the BSOD i'm convinced my power supply is fine.	St
1.10.3	The BSOD reports the problem to be one of two things, some times it is a &quot;Page fault in non paged area&quot;, and others it is something to do with &quot;ati3duag.dll&quot;.	St
1.10.4	Could a driver fix fix this?	St
1.10.5	Also new, when playing call of duty 2, it sometimes now just closes after a while instead of the whole computer dying.	St
1.10.6	The PC gives the usual sorry this had to close error, and if i try to play it again, as soon as i start an actual game, it repeats this closing immediatley.	St
1.10.7	By the way, its a SANSUN 600W.	St
1.10.8	Thanks very much for helping me try ans solve this, any more ideas?	St
1.11.1	ATI3DUAG.dll is part of your video driver library, get the latest drivers or at least reload the current video drivers.	St
1.11.2	It appears that error is known, so google for other corrective actions if so warranted.	St
1.11.3	Also, if your video ram gets too hot, that too can be at fault, as a weak ram chip peteers out, so swap if possible or try another video card.	St
1.11.4	tada -----Willy	St
1.12.1	Firslty, i looked at other forums with people with this problem, and i havn't seen one good solution found.	St
1.12.2	I don't know where to find a newer driver, windows can't find one, my version is 6.14.10.0425.	St
1.12.3	This is really getting me down, i thought building a pc would be easy enough, but mine is pretty useless, its so frustrating.	St
1.12.4	I might try running memtest86 or MS memory diagnostic to test things.	St
1.12.5	Would that be a good idea?	Polite
1.12.6	If so, what kind of result would i be looking for?	St
