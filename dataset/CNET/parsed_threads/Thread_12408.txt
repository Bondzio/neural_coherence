<s> I have Window's Vista and want to use my hp Scanjet 3970 scanner to scan some old slides. </s>
<s> I haven't been able to use it it in about 2 yrs. </s>
<s> Is there a tool I can download to have the scanner work on Vista? </s>
<s> The disk would not work when I fist got Vista and now I need to use it. </s>
<s> So you tried HP's drivers at http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?os=2093&softwareitem=sj-47402-1&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=298548 </s>
<s> Thanks for the link No, I haven't tried it. </s>
<s> It won't effect my other scanner Lexmark will it? </s>
<s> Does this mean below only if 3970 was installed on Vista, which it didn't work on any? </s>
<s> System requirements: Recommended: Uninstall any previous software/driver for your scanner </s>
<s> As you suspect you'll want to make a copy of your system just in case. </s>
<s> At least that's free. </s>
<s> Read and pick yours from http://lifehacker.com/5303067/five-best-free-system-restore-tools </s>
<s> Well now you have me Worried! </s>
<s> What are the chances that it would mess up my system? </s>
<s> Is it worth downloading? </s>
<s> I'm not that computer smart. </s>
<s> I just want to download a tool...if it works good, if not well it just doesn't work. </s>
<s> As you may suspect I'm a bit fearless since I would have a backup ready. </s>
<s> Since you have another scanner, must this scanner be brought back? </s>
<s> And also look at what HP offered. </s>
<s> It's a &quot;basic&quot; driver so who knows (they don't tell and I don't own this scanner) if they enabled the backlight for the film accessory or not. </s>
<s> Maybe this needs a test on another machine or you to learn if System Restore on XP, Vista is functional on your machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, I sure liked this scanner that it scans negtives, but I could go to wal-greens Thanks I will give it thought. </s>
<s> But let me share one last thought. </s>
<s> -&gt; The cost of a trip to any computer repair or support counter pays for how many trips to Walgreens? </s>
<s> Not that this is a good reason not to try but you wonder. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Your welcome and thanks for helping make up my mind I still loved that Hp scanner....guess that's life and the way things change. </s>
<s> Bob, I have been thinking(not good) My Old Windows &quot;ME&quot; that the 3970 scaner worked with. </s>
<s> The last time I tried to use it would not power up, any way to get the power start? </s>
<s> I know, but I can use the scanner :)I'm trying to get pictures from some slides with out sending the slide off for a week or two. </s>
<s> Type THE DEAD PC and you find the usual dead PC troubleshooting. </s>
<s> I can't tell you exactly what and which part to change to suspect here. </s>
<s> Hut with XP and Vista we do have System Restore to fall back on if you want to install that driver. </s>
<s> -&gt; But first, Norton and some other antivirus programs or suites can have you do one more thing to get System Restore (SR) to work. </s>
<s> Here's a search about that issue -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=NORTON+SYSTEM+RESTORE&aq=f&oq=&aqi= Hope that helps, Bob </s>
<s> Bob, I haven't had a chance to try what you sugguested yet. </s>
<s> Thanks for links. </s>
<s> I will let you know how I come out </s>
<s> Hi have? </s>
<s> ?, The link to the basic driver for your Scanner that Bob provided should work for your scanner and not cause any problems with your other Lexmark scanner. </s>
<s> If for some reason you did run into a problem after installation, you can always use Windows System Restore to roll your PC back to a time before the installation. </s>
<s> Thanks Mr. Do I still haven't face the problem yet....but if you think the tool for Hp scanner for Vista will work with out it causing problems I will give it a go. </s>
<s> Thanks for reading the post. </s>
<s> As always everyone is so helpful....I love coming to this forum, it's the BEST! </s>
