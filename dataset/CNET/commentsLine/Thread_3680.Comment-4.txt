ok, this is the pro microatx suggestion this case isn't exactly micro, but it's still considered a microatx case (and not so ugly if you ask me)  avliable in other colors, green is just my favorite...if you goto newegg, and into cases select aspire as the brand, and microatx-desktop as the case type, and then hit enter, it should give you all the options if not just select aspire as the brand, and then they should all be on pg 3 or 4 (possibly 5, they are all together as they all cost the same) also for low thermal design you need to avoid pentium 4, as it will run way to hot (it's like 130w currently) i'd go with athlon64, something like a 2800+ or 3000+ for socket 754, or a 3200+ for socket 939 (you can get the 3200+ for socket 754, it'd be fine) that case isn't amazingly small but it's not huge it'll fit any microatx motherboard, and it's cooled by a 120mm fan (which isn't common for a microatx, most get an 80mm or lesser) 99% of all microatx motherboards will sport onboard video, as their usually designed as a value soltuion (cheaper to build given that they use less pcb/parts, and therefore you can set up an entire system on a microatx board and a celeron/sempron for around $200 (how do you think dell does it)) as for a motherboard, i would look for the best chipset you can find...for intel on microatx the best i've seen (that still stays cost effective) is the 865, going to lga 775 on microatx is just very expensive, as it's the 915 with pcie (or agp) and the gma 900, which is actually a good graphics accelerator (for integrated graphics) as to cooling there are a lot of modern retail pc's with cooling lesser than a single 120mm fan (it will move a lot of air, and if it's not powerful enough:  please note, i'm not responsible if the computer becomes airborne while this fan is being used) if your able to afford maybe..hmm, $1500 total you could check out  and pick up a basic water cooling system that uses a 120mm or dual 120mm radiator, and cool the cpu/nb that way, keeping both noise, and internal heat down i would not advise a water cooling kit, as their parts are very low quality and will not give the performance of the same cost if you buy a higher grade of parts, and assemble it yourself
