1.1.1	I am considering buying one of these two cards for gaming purposes: Either the Nvidia 7800 GT, or the 7800 GTX.	St
1.1.2	Is the difference between the two cards justifies the price of the GTX?	St
1.1.3	Will I notice a significant improvememt while using the GTX in 'normal' conditions?	St
1.1.4	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Check Out this link http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2496&p=2	St
1.3.1	The GTX allows for moire frame rates in higher resolutions, but not that much.	St
1.3.2	In my opinion, it doesn't justify the price so I say you go get the 7800gt.	St
1.3.3	Saves you alot more money and you can probably get something else with the saved money like speakers, or RAM.	St
1.4.1	get the Gt its fast and is like the 6800U and when the prise goes down get another GT, amke sure u have a SLI mobo and PSU.	St
1.4.2	Good luck	Polite
1.5.1	GT, because you can use Rivatuner to unlock the locked pipes on the GT and you'll get the same performance as the GTX.	St
1.5.2	Then you should consider increasing the core and memory clock speed on your card with Rivatuner to get a card even more powerful than the original GTX.	Sug
1.5.3	That's what I like about video cards these days, so much things to unlock.....	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
