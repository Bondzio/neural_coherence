I just bought the same machine from Circuit City.
(T6212) The first thing I noticed was that the 512 MB of RAM was registering as only 384.
The reason was that the video card shares memory so right off the bat 128 MB went to the graphics.
I went to Newegg and picked up an Abit 256 MhZ graphics card (make sure you get one with a PCI-Express connection) and (1) the graphics improved and (2) now all 512 MB of memory is dedicated to the processor.
Hope this helps.
Good luck.
