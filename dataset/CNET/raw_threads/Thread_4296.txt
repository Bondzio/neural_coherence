This makes it easier to do backups because the partitions are smaller (only OS and APPs vs OS APPs and DATA) and makes it safer to recover from a system crasj because your data is isolated on D: To faciliate backups, restores and minimize downtime ...I always put a second drive in every system I build to store my backups of C: and D:
