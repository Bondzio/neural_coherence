for any future users, do not rely on the bbb to determine if a company is a good company.
check out all the companies acid posted and notice how they're all a+.
cyberpower used to be around c- about this time ago, and in two short years have managed to increase to it an a+.
i find this highly unlikely, as the number of complaints that come up about the company have only been increasing, and as to the suggestion of digital storm.
while digital storm does build quality computer, their prices have only been increasing with their popularity.
there are cheaper solutions that offer the same quality as digital storm.
i mean digital storm doesn't do anything special that any other company can't do, it's just a matter of how much time and care is put into each computer.
check out ironside computers to see what i mean.
they offer good quality products and realistic prices, while they're definitely not as popular as digital storm, their quality is, at least in my opinion, on par with them.
at least from my own experience and what i've seen from their youtube videos, their quality seems to be relatively consistent.
the point of what i'm trying to say is, just because a computer is more money, it doesn't always necessarily mean it's better quality.
keep in mind that digital storm does not manufacture their own parts, they use the same parts ironside does.
