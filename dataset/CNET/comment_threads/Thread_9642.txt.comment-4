OK, so Ram pkg to be added should have exact same specs as existing, if I understand.
Mfr's site showed all size options at 667 speed only, huh.
Bob's link to Kingston offered both 667 and my PC's 533.
The part abt adding same stick for stick Ram seems easy enough, but I'm confused on these -- Questions: A) How do I ID what I have, one 1GB stick or two 500MB sticks?
Someone said that with a DualCore processor it might be 2 500s?
B) And Kingston tech specs on these says 'Modules must be ordered and installed in pairs for Dual Channel mode'.
?Does this mean same as 'DualCore'?
If yes, then logical that I WOULD have two 500s and then would add two more?
C) A brief yes/no regarding questions 1 & 3 of my first post, please.
