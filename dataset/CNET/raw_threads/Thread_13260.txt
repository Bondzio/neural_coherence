Hi, I bought a splitter to split (obviously) the only ethernet port from my modem to two different computer, but for some reason I can't. When I try to connect two different computers to the splitter, both of them keep struggling to stay connected. The messages than appear are: Limited but not connectivity The cable is unplugged The normal message than appear once there's a successful connection established I believe than both of them are using the same IP Address What can I do? Thanks in advance
