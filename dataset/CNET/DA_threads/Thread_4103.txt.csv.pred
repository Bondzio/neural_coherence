1.1.1	Have had a external 1T WD I use for backup for about 3 years .	St
1.1.2	Have run tests on it about every 3 months .	St
1.1.3	Everything passed .	St
1.1.4	The last two times it shows Random seek test and Funnel Seek test failed .	St
1.1.5	When I run CKDSK on it , it will go for about 3 hours and says test ca n't be completed and locks up where I have to reboot it before Windows can see it again .	St
1.1.6	I assume this drive is about ready to crap out on me or is there something else I could look at .	St
1.1.7	External drives are pretty cheap right now so is it even worth messing around with the old one ? .	St
1.1.8	Thanks Wayne	St
1.2.1	see if it would run and make the drive write and read more reliably .	St
1.2.2	If that did n't work I 'd replace the drive perhaps as an internal ( fixed or dockable ) or second as an external .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Ext .	St
1.3.2	HDs have a shorter life-cycle than int .	St
1.3.3	HDs , they just do .	St
1.3.4	While you may not recall all those times it & quot ; moved & quot ; from a safe area or got jostled now and then when running , all this adds-up to begin a faltering HD .	St
1.3.5	Not only that but even the non-operating times it was handled , it can take only so much .	St
1.3.6	Let 's not forget it 's a simple device that besides the HD itself inside , the small i/f pcb with electronics can be easily overcomed by outside surges , etc.. Plus , all too often its been left to run continuously ( heat stress ) and that may not always be desirable for long life of the ext .	St
1.3.7	HD .	St
1.3.8	You can test or if you like replace the HD ( inside case ) using the manufacturer 's provided diags .	St
1.3.9	The diags are pretty much required should any warranty be done in order to say , this or that and fulfill the warranty return process .	St
1.3.10	If no warranty , save whatever before it dies and test if you care to .	St
1.3.11	Take the results as the basis to decide on replacement of some sort .	St
1.3.12	As always , errors are n't good .	St
1.3.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I ended up putting everything I had to have on thumb drives .	St
1.4.2	Out of curiosity I formatted the WD external hard drive and found the backup software on the HP web site and loaded it to the drive .	St
1.4.3	I can now run the tests and everything passes ?	Ques
1.4.4	I put it back on my computer and everything seems to be fine , but for how long ?	Ques
1.4.5	Beings it 's 3 years old I will watch it very close and when it fails again , I will pick up a new on .	St
1.4.6	Thanks for that information VAPCMD and Willy .	St
1.5.1	looks the best and go with it .	St
1.5.2	If you do n't have a lot to back up maybe even a smaller SSD might be an alternative .	St
1.5.3	The good thing is if you 've got the original data , a full backup of the data , plus the thumb drives you got some redundancy and some time to shop for your longer term solution .	St
1.5.4	Thanks for the feedback and keep us posted .	St
1.5.5	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I have seen these little portable hard drives that are USB 2 and 3 .	St
1.6.2	What is the story on those ?	Ques
1.6.3	My son is a contractor and uses a laptop , he is looking for something for backup that is portable and reliable .	St
1.6.4	He ask me about them and I really do n't know anyone who has used them .	Sug
1.6.5	Mine has a outside power source , but that would n't fit with what he does .	St
1.6.6	He asked around at Best Buy , Staple and places like that , but those guys tell you anything to get a sale .	St
1.6.7	Any idea on those ?	Ques
