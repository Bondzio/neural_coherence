<s> After you are connected to the VPN Search for the computer you are looking for. </s>
<s> You should then be able to double click on it and access the shared folders... </s>
<s> Once you VPN to the other machine, it's not unlike you unplugged from your network and plugged into that remote network. </s>
<s> To allow access to both at the same time would be a violation of what a VPN does. </s>
