Proffitt	1/4/11 8:51 AM	1.29413106E12	Let's look at the requirements.	http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/systemreqs/ It seems very hard to get a new machine with 1GB RAM today and the other requirements seem far below your average PC. What you want to avoid is getting a very high end machine for the web designer since they might make a site that would work fine on that but not for folk that visit the site. Bob

AM3900-U3042 Desktop, Intel? Pentium? Processor E6700, 6GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive Windows 7 Home Premium. I don't know much about media cards. Is it alright to say that this computer would work perfectly fine for running dreameaver?

That was beat by 8 bits! &quot;OpenGL* 2.0. Intel GMA X4500HD&quot; is just a snippet from intel.com so we're met that requirement as well. -&gt; NO ONE will write it will be &quot;perfectly fine&quot; but it should be fine. Bob
