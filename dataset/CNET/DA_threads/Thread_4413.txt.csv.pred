1.1.1	I just replaced my motherboard with a used one of the same make/model/chipset , so bootup was quite easy .	St
1.1.2	However , there 's one problem : my floppy ( A ) drive is n't recognized .	St
1.1.3	It does n't light on startup , and is n't shown in Windows Explorer .	St
1.1.4	( OS is Win98SE ) .	St
1.1.5	I 'm sure one possible reason for this is a damaged/defective motherboard , but am hopeful there 's another , less drastic , cause .	St
1.1.6	Can someone please give me some insight as to what 's causing this ?	Ques
1.1.7	Also , am I correct in my understanding that the red stripe on the IDE ribbon cable goes to the outboard side of the floppy drive ?	Ques
1.1.8	My FD connector has alignment slots on both top and bottom , so I want to verify that I 've installed the cable correctly .	St
1.2.1	If the drive worked before , look at the ribbon cable , the motherboard and the drive itself .	St
1.2.2	All have Pin 1 configuration marks .	St
1.2.3	Make sure the red mark on the ribbon ( pin 1 ) goes to pin 1 on the motherboard .	St
1.2.4	Some floppies do not have the mark - so try the cable both ways .	St
1.2.5	If this does n't work try a new cable .	St
1.3.1	A look in the Bios is called for to see if the drive is set to 31/2 inch/1.44mb capacity .	St
