After each outage, service would continue as usual. The customer service rep at Comcast tested the modem remotely and said the problem was the modem, not the signal. The unit is a Motorola SURFboard. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thanks

Today's electronics in many cases are designed for cost targets and sacrifice longevity. 2. Where is it? Why I ask is that one member had theirs in an enclosed space. Another had it buried under a pile of debris. Treat it nicely and keep it cool without burying it under other devices. Bob

It's sitting in the open on an uncluttered computer desk, but the room does get hot at times. What I was curious about is why the modem works perfectly at times then cuts out occasionally. Thanks for your input.

Like drinking from a shared garden hose. More people drinking, less water for each. So, from what your times of signal loss are, my brain instantly tells me that is WHEN the KIDS are HOME and playing ONLINE GAMES. (which is a big drain on the system) Unlike browsing or email, gaming needs lots of input to update many things at once. Add lots of kids, and poof - signal is weak. So, either do your IMPORTANT COMPUTING when the kidz are in school, or try DSL or DIAL-UP. Or, throw a big neighborhood party, with lots of free food, and when they come to eat, run inside your house and quickly do your Internetting. &lt;grin&gt; Check out http://www.broadbandreports.com/ for more info as it is a great site. You can even check out your actual signal speed. DO it at different times to get more data to help you figure this out. Hope this help'd you. Thanx, DRIX

According to customer service, my modem and one other in the neighborhood were the only ones offline at the time I called. My service was briefly interrupted one time since I first wrote but has been fine since. I'm going to check out the site you suggested.
