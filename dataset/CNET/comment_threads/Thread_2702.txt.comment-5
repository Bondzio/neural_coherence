If WAP is a wireless access point, I have a wireless router (D-Link DI-624).
THe router is wired to the DSL Modem and my PC.
My laptop has an ATHEROS AR5001X+ Wireless Network Adapter.
The problem is that, on both the PC and the laptop, when I try to dial into the internet, Enternet says there was no response from the remote computer.
As well, although I'm pretty sure the computers are connected I can't get them to share printers or files.
Eveything I've read on networking so far has either been for Windows 98 or XP, never for 2000.
I'm sure it will be pretty easy to enable file and printer sharing,but my bigger problem is the internet.
If know a way to fix this let me know, but if you know any good sites that could help, that would be fine.
Thanks for your help.
