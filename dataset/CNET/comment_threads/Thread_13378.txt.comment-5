One day my wireless was working and then it quit.
Then the next day I lost the entire network.
I couldn't even open the connect to menu.
I have a gateway t-1628 and on the internet connections where it has the icons for the broadband and dial up networks the wireless is no where to be found.
I thought if I tried reinstalling windows vista home edition everything would go back to normal but it didn't.
I don't know what to do.
I read another guys message saying he had a similar problem where he lost his wireless network and someone said to call the laptops company and tell them about it.
I'm tempted to do that but I just wanna know if there's a way past this before trying to call somebody.
