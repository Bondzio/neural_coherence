may be an odd question(or may be not).
just added a breakout box to my computer.
headphone, microphone, and 2 usb plugs work fine.
my problem is the firewire plug.
the cable for it has connections for a header(as did the others).
my firewire card's internal connection is a plug.
now to my question.
are there firewire plugs available?
the other choice would be to buy a firewire cable and cut the end off and graft it.
this is also a problem.
the header connections are labeled, but i have no way to match those to the plug wires.
if anyone can point me to a source for a 1394 plug and/or a means of identification of wires i would greatly appreciate it.
