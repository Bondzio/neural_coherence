Hi All - I have been using a packard bell audiodream mp3 as a flash drive on my PC with no problems.
Recently atarted using a new usb flash drive (fingerprint) and ever since i've had problems with the packard drive.
the packard drive is recognised by my pc and is assigned a drive letter - i only know this as it comes up in the safely remove hardware window.
but it does not come up as a drive in 'my computer' any ideas?
Austin.
