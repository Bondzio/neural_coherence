i have a windowsme pc that has a box in the middle of the screen that says &quot;video cable connected?&quot; it appeared out of nowhere.
the screen is black & red with this box in the center.
the screen looks like a tv when the cable goes out or no signal.
you can hear the programs loading up ibut nothing appears.
this was my pc and i gave it to my son.
he has alot of programs morphous downloads music, hotmail,all that stuff.
i did take the pc back to original state after i gave it to him but it still isn't working correctly.
i don't know if this is fixable or should i just get another pc?
all he wants is something to make cds and play games.
any suggewstions would be appreciated.
thank you for your time
