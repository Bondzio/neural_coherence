Hi everybody.
I just got a brand new PC to manage home movies, make music, and play a few games like WoW.
All this hype about consoles make me think that it may be better to do my gaming on them, rather than my computer.
It is 2.0 GHZ core duo, 2 gb of RAM, 256mb Nvidia X1600.
What would be the major differences between gaming with a 360 or PS3 and my computer?
As a side note, why is it that in a 600 dollar console (PS3) they can include a &quot;supercomputer&quot; Cell processor while a 600 dollar pc would hardly get mainstram processing power?
