thanks for the advice, i thought about just getting a new one, but um...yeah really weird story.
you probably wont even believe it, the computer is just sitting there turned on while im over here on this one, and it just like turns off randomly.
so i turn it back on, and the drives work (take note this is maybe the 8th or so time the computer has been restarted) but now i need to find a driver for the ricoh.
my problem was firmware, and now its the driver
