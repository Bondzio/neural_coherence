<s> I've been having a problem with my computer, and I don't really know which part goes wrong. </s>
<s> when I first bought my computer (like 6 months ago), everything went fine except the VGA card (GeForce 7600GS) and one of the memory stick (1GB), so I decided to go buy a new VGA card and new memory stick. </s>
<s> now, I have 1 VGA card, GeForce 8600GTS and 1 GB memory stick (Corsair). </s>
<s> I was pretty sure that this time everything would go fine. </s>
<s> alas, my computer froze again after I had installed the driver =(. </s>
<s> this time is even worse, I can't even start my windows. </s>
<s> so I decided to take off my VGA card and use onboard VGA card. </s>
<s> with on board VGA card I can run any application as much and as long as I want, but as soon as I run any other heavy game application, such as Warcraft, it will freeze =(. </s>
<s> I really have no idea what's going on with my computer, - is it because the VGA card not compatible with the motherboard (GA-VM900M, chipset: VIA P4M900)?? </s>
<s> - is it because the driver itself(NVidia GeForce 8600GTS driver) clashes with the motherboard?? </s>
<s> - could the problem is probably caused by the power supply (not enough power or something)?? </s>
<s> As a note here, Motherboard GA-VM900M support PCI-E, and I bet you guys have already known that GeForce 8 series are mostly available for PCI-E. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to solve my problem?? </s>
<s> or has anyone encountered the same problem as mine before and has got it solved?? </s>
<s> I completely stuck here please help, any feedback will be appreciated! </s>
<s> the following actions have been done in order to detect the problem: 1. </s>
<s> Memory testing, result: ok 2. updating motherboard driver 3. downloading the latest VGA driver from the site </s>
<s> Depending on what version of the video card you have, the recommended power supply size is 350w to 400 watts. </s>
<s> What size and type power supply do you have and did you connect the extra power connector to the card? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
