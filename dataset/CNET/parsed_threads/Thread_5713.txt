<s> I tripped over the power cord to my WD 500gb My Book external hard drive today. </s>
<s> The power cord came out of the unit, and it fell over onto the carpet. </s>
<s> I plugged it back in, and it makes a sort of grinding noise about 5 times before seemingly giving up. </s>
<s> I plugged it into my Windows 7 computer once it was done, and it recognizes the drive as a USB disk, but not as the D:/ drive like it used to. </s>
<s> What might the problem be? </s>
<s> Can I get it fixed? </s>
<s> Are all of my music and important documents gone forever? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> http://www.drivesavers.com does this sort of recovery daily. </s>
<s> But where are the backup copies? </s>
<s> Externals fail more often than internals which means we can't go without backup. </s>
