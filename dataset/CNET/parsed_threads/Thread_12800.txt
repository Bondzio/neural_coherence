<s> I recently purchased a Hypersonic desktop - the small form factor. </s>
<s> I also purchased the on-site warranty. </s>
<s> The PS2 port does not work. </s>
<s> Well, I can use my USB mouse, of course, but I prefer to leave the USB port free for other things in the future. </s>
<s> Anyway, when I called them this morning they said that I should send the machine in. </s>
<s> No on-site warranty if they have to replace the motherboard (which seems likely). </s>
<s> Of course, I do not want to do that. </s>
<s> For one thing, I need the machine, and for another, they were a month late sending me the machine, so who knows when I will get it back if I mail it in. </s>
<s> I really should never have done business with them again. </s>
<s> The laptop I bought from them has bad speakers, and now I am afraid to send it in, since I may never see it again. </s>
<s> Anyway, I am avoiding Hypersonic forever after this. </s>
<s> I should also mention that the software they gave me for the external modem does not install properly for some reason, and I have yet to hear from them about that. </s>
<s> I have made arrangements to make a formal complaint with the New York Consumer Protection Agency. </s>
<s> Maybe that will get their attention. </s>
<s> If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know. </s>
<s> as the company has been in business for some time. </s>
<s> It is always good to check about a company's &quot;on site&quot; warranty. </s>
<s> Besides the New York Consumer Protection Agency, which I assume is like the Better Business Bureau (BBB), I would write a letter to the president of the company. </s>
<s> Came across this old 2000 interview and this Mr. Fred Kohan may still be president. </s>
