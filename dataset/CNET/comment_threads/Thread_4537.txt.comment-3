of course they ARE connected to the WAN port... All 3 routers are connected to a switch that is connected to the access point... To make it simpler: when i connect 3 laptops on LAN with static ip it works perfectly, when i connect 3 routers instead with same static ip.
All three doesnt work... Is there anything else i should configure in the routers?
maybe assign each a different dhcp range ?
