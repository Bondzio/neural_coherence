1.1.1	My girlfriends dell laptop recently got a bad virus.	St
1.1.2	I reinstalled windows xp to get rid of this virus.	St
1.1.3	Everything with the reboot went ok.	St
1.1.4	I noticed that when scrolling through internet pages it was very sluggish.	St
1.1.5	I did some research and found that I didn't re-install the graphics card driver after the reboot.	St
1.1.6	Unfortunitley my girlfriend didn't have the driver disk for the graphics card.	St
1.1.7	I instead tried to manually install it from the list and accidently installed the wrong one.	St
1.1.8	Now, when you turn on the computer you can see the screen that says &quot;Dell&quot; and then the Screen that says &quot; Microsoft windows with the progress bar&quot; once this is done loading the screen goes black.	St
1.1.9	You can still here everything booting up but no picture.	St
1.1.10	How can I remove the bad driver without being able to see anything?	St
1.1.11	Any suggestions?	St
1.1.12	Thanks Andy	Polite
1.2.1	If you really had a bad virus, it would be wize to start by completely reformatting your hard drive.	St
1.2.2	Many times those things sit deeply in the registry.	St
1.2.3	That will also solve your wrong driver too.	St
