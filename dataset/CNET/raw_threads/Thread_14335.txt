The overall number is 5.5 with the video being 6.5. Sorry but I won't install Everest today. The pixel shader the last time I looked was 2.0 or greater. But we never looked at that since all games play fine. Hope this helps. Bob

12548	5	398581	3325724	3325731	R. Proffitt	6/21/10 10:44 AM	1.27711704E12	Why such low res? My kid	Has it hooked to a 1080p Samsung display and never changes it from 1920x1080. I don't know all the titles but The Orange Box and Bioshock run fine. Bob
12548	6	398581	3325755	3325724	fema2129	6/21/10 11:01 AM	1.27711806E12	Because...	My comp is single core amd athlon 64 1640 2.6 overclocked to 2784 mhz. Yours is quad core intel and cpu sped might be 2.4 or 2.66,2.5 i dont know.My is 2gb ram,160gb hd 5400rpm,and m2n x plus asus motherboard. I should mention, that my processor is &quot;green&quot;, and it us 45W of power, and yours is 95W.And my display is CRT 17&quot; philips, on 1024x768 res. Stalker Call of Pripyat running on 1024x768, on static lighting,because gpu cant handle so high object lighting, and the game going slow on full dynamic lighting(dx10). My cant even start Bioshock 2. Greetings,Fema. PS I recommend S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat
12548	7	398581	3325746	3325755	R. Proffitt	6/21/10 11:09 AM	1.27711854E12	Ahh.	My kid's machine taps about 95 Watts or less sitting there and I think I measure 110 Watts during game play. Which is far better than some older machines we had. While it only had 2GB when we installed Windows 7, we knew to install the 64 bit since we didn't want to install the OS again later. It ran very well and then later, the second 2GB was added. The HP d5000 was all of 369 bucks at geeks.com and quite the bargain unit. Yes we added the gt 220 and used one of the Windows 7 family pack licenses so you can get an idea what the grand total was. The kid's happy so I can only hope that he doesn't bug me for a new machine this year. Bob
