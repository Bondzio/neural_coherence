i had 3 old units under the bench in my computer room that i intended to upgrade and soup up.
one day i put them all out in the back yard, went in the house and got my 12 ga. shotgun.
when i stepped out the door they got fast real quick.
the last i saw they were heading over the next ridge, and i think they are still on the run.
all ''joking'' aside, i would junk it, you can build a new workable system today for less than $600, and a higher end system for around $1000.
