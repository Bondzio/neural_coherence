ok more like to a wheel bearing on a car since it's more similar.
too random to predict.
new cars get bad bearings, old cars get bad bearings.
sorry i can't give you a definite answer, but i will say that i have had in my lifetime probably close to.....50 drives (laptop and desktop) that i own and/or still own, and none have died.
now, if you drop it or do something silly, that's your fault.
but i will mention that i have an old maxtor 40gb, that while it still works, is very loud.
the bearings are going bad.
i'm throwing that one away soon.
another note: i was an early adoptoer of ssds (solid state hard drives), paid $450 for a tiny 1.8&quot; sized 32gb slc mtron drive for a dell x1 ultraportable (awesome laptop), and it failed.
currently is being rma'd back to korea.
i hate rma processes with companies that make you send the defective product halfway around the world...it takes months to get another one.
