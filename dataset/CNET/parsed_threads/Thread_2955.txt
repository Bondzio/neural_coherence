<s> Iam looking at a Dell Dimension XPS,model MM8,PII...when I turn it on it Beeps...I pulled slot boards-cleaned connections -reinstalled...tried again ...sounds like 1p111p111p1 (p=pause)...also the monitor dosent activate. </s>
<s> this unit also has wires (2) coming fron a key lock and plugs into circuit board..whats this setup for ...and if the lock is on does it limit what I can do? </s>
<s> it's not turned on ...on this unit..but i have another problem child that Im not sure of </s>
<s> If I could make two guesses, I would say likely culprits are video card or memory. </s>
<s> A missing or defective video card will do such as will defective memory. </s>
<s> If you have more than one memory module, you can insert them one at a time into the first slot (usually slot &quot;0&quot;) and see if you can make it work. </s>
<s> Another common one I have seen with AGP video cards is they are not quite seated properly even though they seem to be. </s>
<s> Check this closely. </s>
<s> As for the key lock, these are sort of outdated but were used to disable the keyboard...sort of a cheap and ineffective security device. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> dumb question probly...but the video card ...is that the slot card that the monitors serial connector mates to?...I did notice someone had pulled all the ram sticks out...I had a couple so I put 2 in ....but then I dont KNOW if their good...question about the keyboard locks..I think I had a chassis that had a keyboard error...if I pull the wires from their conn. would that disable it's function or would I have to install a jumper on the connection? </s>
<s> If the connector goes to a standard keyboard lock on the front panel of the PC, removing the connector from the MB only disables your ability to lock the keyboard. </s>
<s> A jumper would just lock it again so leave it disconnected. </s>
<s> If the RAM has been removed and not properly reinstalled, you will get beeps, especially if in slot &quot;0&quot;. </s>
<s> I recall something about the first 64k as being mandatory. </s>
<s> There is no beep code standard for MB manufacturers so, if you can, I would check for a support site for yours. </s>
<s> Most likely the BIOS chips are from AMI or Pheonix. </s>
<s> okay, so I did what I was suppose to do...count the beeps an research....I think I got it now...I told ya I'am not a computer wiz ...I had 2 sticks of memory I inserted in the ram slots 0&1...same problem...beeps...so after a cooling off period...I thot maybe those were bad...so I pulled them out an put another stick ....guess what ...it loads up ...yep, no beeps...I think I just stuck the wrong type of ram sticks in...not that I understand the difference between sdimm or dramm or whatever.. </s>
<s> I guess the motto is...dont get frustrated..step away for a while..oh and that just because they fit the slot ...dosent mean there RIGHT. </s>
