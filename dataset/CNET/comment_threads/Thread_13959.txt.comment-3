Part of my problem right now with the ASUS setup is it no longer will boot.
The MB does not POST any clear message as to the problem and I have no Keyboard and/or monitor.
I did you and external device to check the output of the Antec Neo 650P and 550S power supplies and they checked out OK. As far as what I would like to use with the new Intel MB I am considering the option below.
Crucial (qty 2 sets for 8 GB) BL2KIT25664BA1336 DDR3 PC3-10600 timing 6-6-6-20 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR3-1333 1.8V 256Meg x 64
