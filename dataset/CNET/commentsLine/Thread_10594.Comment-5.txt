i have realized that the reason i was having a difficult time setting up my printer for ad hoc was that windows 7 and the software for the printer was not communicating that i needed to followup with more actions.
i needed to remove the default printer software that came with my laptop.
(not that i received a printer.
not sure why this was on my computer) i then told my pc to look again for the printer.
other things that may have helped but not sure it really mattered in my case was checking the firewall protection is not to strong and making sure that my pc was set to share with other devices.
