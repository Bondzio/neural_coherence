im making a computer for the first time.
im doing this partially to get to know the inside of the computer, partially to start a new hobby and partially cause i need a new computer.
my budget is pretty low cause im pretty young and cause i dont need it to be extremely high end.
just looking for advice on what i can do to have it run at an average load and small computer games (mainly world of warcraft on low graphics if i decide that i want to go back to that).
the link to my plans are  .
any help is appreciated.
