1.1.6	Any advice or tips of what I should do PLEASE HELP .	Ques
1.1.7	Feedback is much appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Try a repair of the OS .	St
1.2.2	Provided you have a OS install disc or access to hidden OS restore/recovery partition and it allows a & quot ; repair mode & quot ; , then use it .	St
1.2.3	Doing the repair mode process should clear some OS issues .	St
1.2.4	-OR- use your restore point feature and select a date prior to all this happening .	St
1.2.5	You can also check by doing an AV scan and see if no malware or virus is at work .	St
1.2.6	The other side of this is you may have a true h/w fault and it lies in the laptop itself .	St
1.2.7	You could have blown USB ports with an & quot ; iffy & quot ; device that took down each port as you swapped it to make it work , If any of your USB devices work elsewhere , check them maybe a desktop PC , etc.. Last , you can prior to anything being done under the control panel , using the device manager and see if the USB listing is showing OK or active or no red/yellow flags .	St
1.2.8	A laptop does n't tell much , what is your laptop model # and have you checked the maker support website for your model , users having problems ?	Ques
1.2.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Make , model , age , if reloading the OS helps or not .	St
1.4.1	It is a Lenovo G570 about a year old I do n't know what to do	St
1.5.1	Its a Lenovo G570 and I have looked at reviews and nothing comes up as these problems one of the support members recommended restoring my computer to factory settings with the risk of losing files .	St
1.5.2	although I do n't really have a lot of things on my computer to begin with but I am just stumped .	St
1.6.1	Out of warranty and it 's too expensive .	St
1.7.1	Do n't confuse & quot ; restore point & quot ; feature with OS restore , they are different .	St
1.7.2	Using the restore point to a date prior to this problem arising *may* resolve this .	St
1.7.3	You would need afterwards to update and/or it will act on its own to update as it sees itself now & quot ; back dated & quot ; and will try to correct that .	St
1.7.4	This is normal but if the past process got hosed or wayward , using the restore point could correct a past problem .	St
1.7.5	This is NOT restoring the OS as in & quot ; reloading the restore/recovery ( install ) & quot ; process procedure .	St
1.7.6	Also , a & quot ; repair & quot ; of the OS could be done but you need access to the OS install process which provides a menu selection of & quot ; repair mode & quot ; .	St
1.7.7	having the OS install disc and/or to hidden partition that is found on many laptops should offer that .	St
1.7.8	It 's best your fully understand how yours is accessed .	Polite
1.7.9	The laptop maker 's support website all too often outlines how this is done , get the manual/doc that explains this .	St
1.7.10	You can google the & quot ; repair process & quot ; for your OS used as this similar to all vendors .	St
1.7.11	# rd party vendors offer a & quot ; repair disc & quot ; as well , however for Win7 users and possible Win8 , this repair disc can be made from other PCs using the same OS type .	St
1.7.12	Generate one and then use that on your PC to start a repair .	St
