I have had exactly the same problem since I acquired my E521 in February.
Dell even replaced the entire system, but the same has happened.
I'm sure it's the combination of software that they bundled in with the PC, but I don't yet know what I should be removing.
My view, however, is that Dell must surely be responsible for the s/w they package with the PC.
It hasn't worked since out of the box and it's extremely frustrating.
