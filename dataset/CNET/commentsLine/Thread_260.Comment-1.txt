hi everyone i have a plextor px-712a drive.
it does not read some dvd roms which other drives are able to read.
when i insert that dvd rom in the drive the drives led blinks with an orange colour (orange colour usually indicates that there is some problem with the disc).
the discs are fine as they have not much scratches on them.
some people told me to clean the lens using a lens cleaner cd.
i used it but it didnt work.
my system info is: 1ghz intel celeron windows xp professional 256mb ram 40 gb harddisk dvd burner px-712a.
what should i do.
your suggessions are highly appreciated.
