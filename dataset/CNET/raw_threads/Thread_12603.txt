My girlfriend's laptop (Compaq Presario 715US) has the older USB 1.1 ports and her new iPod Nano required the quicker USB 2.0 port so we purchased a PCMCIA card with two USB 2.0 ports and two FireWire ports (Adaptec DuoConnect AUA-1422). However, the iPod recharges it's battery via the USB port, and I'm guessing there's some power &quot;loss&quot; through the PCMCIA card because the iPod was plugged into the PCMCIA USB 2.0 port for 16 hrs without being able to get up to a full charge (we gave up at the 3/4 mark), even though the iPod's directions said it should only take about 3 hrs to fully charge. To be sure it wasn't an issue with the iPod I tried charging it via my desktop's USB 2.0 port and it charged right up the remaining 1/4 after less than 20 minutes. So, I was wondering if there's a PCMCIA USB 2.0 card that'll transmit enough power to charge the iPod. The Adaptec card, like others I've seen, has a jack for plugging in an AC adapter for additional power, but we'd like to avoid having another cord coming from the laptop if possible. Are we right that it's not getting enough power through the PCMCIA card? If so is there one out there that'll put out enough power to charge the iPod?

I find when using &quot;adapters&quot; you're stuck with what it can do for the initial purpose. If you complain about a feature that simply isn't supported or intended to be thought of, you get out of the scope of the product. You've best served to read the specs of the product and see what the power range is provided, but basically most should be the same. range. Be happy, you anything out of it. You should consider returning it to at least get your money back for now if possible. As for USB product, look here: http://www.usbman.com tada -----Willy

The reason we bought this PCMCIA card is because the packaging makes specific reference to it's ability to be used for the iPod. That's why we figured that it would do what the iPod requires of a USB 2.0 port; provide quick file transfer (which it does) and provide power for charging (which it doesn't). Granted, it didn't specifically state that it would provide enough power to charge the iPod, but since that's a key feature of the iPod's connection through a USB 2.0 port it would seem logical that providing the power to charge the device would be within the scope of the product since it represents itself as being for the iPod.

I had been thinking the same thing, but that's why I mentioned in my first post that I ruled out the problem being with the iPod because I was able to succesfully charge it via one of my desktop's USB 2.0 ports. And to reconfirm that it wasn't an issue with the iPod I drained the battery some and again tried charging it via the PCMCIA USB 2.0 port and it still wouldn't charge (or if it was it was charging *EXTREMELY* slow), but when I plugged it back into the one on my desktop it charged right up again. That's why I'm fairly certain that it's an issue of not enough power being transmitted through the PCMCIA card.

It is doing its job but not at a rate you like. As for iPod, the USB port will accept any USB device provided it isn't that power hungary on a true USB port alone. Laptops themseleves have always been poor subsitutes for outside devices unless specific to laptop. In other words you can push it only so far. PCMCIA is of itself a small powered device and then onto a outside USB device, you can see the venue it has to go through, it really does what it can. It appears the adapter you got worked but not at a level suited for 100% satisfaction. Of course, there could be a chance that device is bad, return to try another one. Let's not foprget the laptop battery status should be darn good or outlet powered for best results. enjoy -----Willy

PCMCIA slots have minimum power output so you could try plugging into another USB port (swapping with a low power device such as a mouse) You can also get a Splitter USB cord so that you can draw power from two USB sockets although it seems you are short on case mounted sockets. Your best approach would seem to be to get a 5V adapter and charge direect from that as putting an extra load on a laptop is not a great idea. Regards Stewart
