i have changed my settings on my computers and this way the computer no longers shuts down the ubs ports.
go to device manager(right click my computer, left click properties, left click hardware, left click device manager) go to the usb controller section and click the + sign.
go to each usb root hub and right click on it, left click properties, left click power management.
uncheck the box, allow computer to turn off this device to save power.
