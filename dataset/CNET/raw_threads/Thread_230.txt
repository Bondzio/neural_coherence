I wanna host a LAN party between all of my friends, and being that I have no LAN experience, I pretty don't know much about LANning, but we're close friends, so a little embarrassment won't hurt. But I do wanna know what I need for the LAN connection. I know it has to be setup through the Network Wizard or whatever, but what exactly do I need cord-wise, and I need some sort of a hub, too, right? Steer me in the direction as to what to look for hub-wise, because I have no idea, but if I'm correct, you just use a bunch of Ethernet cables into the hub, don't you? And I am getting a HUB, not a modem, right? Well, as long as you can help me with that stuff, then I'm good to go. Sorry for the |\|00|3 questions, but I gotta learn sometime. :P

Even IF you don't connect to the internet your wiring is drop dead simple. optional internet-&gt;wifi router-&gt;optional switched hub-&gt; PCs. It's that simple and widely documented so I'll stop here except to note it's cheap compared to just 2 years ago. Bob
