The problem is that one of the disks has failed and I want to know if it is possible to remove and reseat the disk without powering off the server.

Only the RAID 5 and up may support disk replacement. And even then I must know which controller or software is used. Some of them have you use some software or control panel to mark the failing drive for removal then you use that again to add the new drive. No guessing allowed from my experience. -&gt; Let me share what usually happens. If the owners can't find out more they usually end up replacing the server or rebuilding it from scratch. -&gt; Can you reveal how you got into this big hole? Bob
