<s> I have a Gateway K7 950 that quit working a few months ago, wouldnt boot. </s>
<s> I stuck it in the closet until I had time to look at it and forgot about it. </s>
<s> When I finally got it out I tried to reload it (Win XP Pro) but it locks up before completing the install - it did the same thing with Win 98. </s>
<s> I tried another HD, then memory and it did exactly the same thing. </s>
<s> Whatever is wrong with it seems to have come to the surface, the last couple of times I turned it on it instantly fills the screen with strange letters and characters. </s>
<s> No beeps or anything, and as fast as it begins making these it clearly isnt going into the BIOS or Post Codes. </s>
<s> Now, my question: what are the odds it is the motherboard, BIOS etc instead of the processor? </s>
<s> I know where I can get a motherboard very reasonably, and wonder if it would be worth the gamble, any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions. </s>

<s> Strange charaters or filling up of same on display suggests ram problems. </s>
<s> Remove ram and clean the slots with soft toothbrush and alcohol, allow to dry and then re-install ram and check results. </s>
<s> Of course try other ram if possible or test elsewhere, that ram. </s>
<s> That's where I'll start... tada -----Willy </s>
