<s> after going through hell with alienware I think I am going to pick up a voodoo computer. </s>
<s> I cant find too many unsastisfied customers from this company, but I am not sure if it is because they are really good or if its because they arent as big as Alienware. </s>
<s> What do you guys think of Voodoo, the Voodoo Omen to be more specific. </s>
<s> Does it seem like a good choice for a high end computer? </s>
<s> http://www.voodoopc.com/whyvoodoo/customerspeak.aspx </s>
<s> Well, HP bought VoodooPC so in a way they are as big as Alienware which is owned by Dell, at least in one way. </s>
<s> If you do order a VoodooPC be prepared for it to take a month or more to be built. </s>
<s> I ordered a different model but had a wait time of 45 days from when I ordered it till I received it. </s>
<s> That is a good choice for a high end computer and won a competition over on ExtremeTech for the Ultimate Gaming Machine I believe. </s>
<s> It can be rather expensive would be the only caution I'd give. </s>
<s> You may want to visit the forums that Voodoo has called the Mutthaboards if you want some more experiences. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> thanks for the info guys. </s>
<s> I was kinda expecting the long wait time for my computer. </s>
<s> Alienware told me two weeks and it turned into almost 2 months. </s>
<s> I was also wondering how good there customer service is? </s>
<s> Can you get on the phone with them quickly, are they nice? </s>
<s> can you understand them clearly? </s>
<s> From what I have read they seem like quality built systems. </s>
<s> I do have a budget, but as far as these high end computers go, the voodoo omen doesnt seem to outrageous. </s>
<s> I went to falcon northwests site, and I couldnt figure out why it was costing so much... thanks for the help </s>
<s> They don't have 24/7 support though so you do have to call them when they are open. </s>
<s> Calling them works better than e-mail or posting on their forums I've found and so far no waiting for someone. </s>
<s> I did find their menu a little odd as it is press 1 for tech support or just stay on the line so there aren't lots of options and buttons to press to get to talking to a person. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> VooDoo computers are nothing more than top shelf components installed in a great box. </s>
<s> They pay attention to details but like anything else there can be problems. </s>
<s> They do support or can OC a system but that h/w is meant to take it, so take that into account or is optional. </s>
<s> Overall, there are more happy users than not. </s>
<s> The same was for Alienware, until they got too big for their britches. </s>
<s> You can't build x-number of systems with fine detail under a fast out the door to fill orders which &quot;I suspect&quot; happened with Alienware. </s>
<s> The other big gamer or top-end builder is NW Falcon at: http://www.falcon-nw.com/ should want to check them out. </s>
<s> If you can afford to check them out and review the specs, you see there's little difference in the components installed within certain levels. </s>
<s> I do want to exclude any paint or outrageous case schemes for practical reasons in pricing, look at the insides. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I can get an alienware computer, or dell Xps for around 5,300 bucks, and they come with dual 8800 768mb cards. </s>
<s> The Voodoo cost the same as them but without dual cards. </s>
<s> The falcons look nice but i changed to parts and it was already out of my budget.. Should I go with voodoo and pay the same price for a single card instead of duals? </s>
<s> Should I tell Alienware I want to replace my computer? </s>
<s> Or should I go with a Dell XPS? </s>
<s> Cant afford Falcon... what do you guys think? </s>
<s> Or take Dell since it is the same company as Alienware. </s>
<s> &quot;Gamer Infinity SLI KO&quot; may also be worth a look for a system that uses dual 8800 cards and in the Extremetech article lists it at $3,999 so it is fairly low cost. </s>
<s> JMHO, JB </s>
<s> Is CyberPower a good company? </s>
<s> I am really considering this computer. </s>
<s> What is the general word on CyberPower, are they reliable or do they have alot of issues? </s>
<s> thanks man I appreciate it! </s>
<s> You are running into the reasons why high-end gamers like to build their own computers. </s>
<s> Many find the little time invested in learning to build more than pays off in the end. </s>
<s> - often cost less - can be ordered and built within days, not months - you know the system a lot better - no parts you don't want - no software you don't want </s>
<s> yea im starting to see that more and more. </s>
<s> I dont think I am going to learn all that though, I dont have the time right now. </s>
<s> I also want the things only companies can offer, like tech support and a good warranty. </s>
<s> Also I am not an overclocking hardcore gamer, I enjoy gaming alot though. </s>
<s> This system however will be more for 3d and 2d art and animation, with some good gaming on the side. </s>
<s> The cyberpowers are much cheaper but I have read too many bad reviews about them. </s>
<s> After being burned by alienware, I dont want the same mistake again. </s>
<s> So I think I am going to go with a Voodoo Omen. </s>
<s> HAVE YOU GOTTEN A VOODOO YET AND HAS ANYBODY SEEN REVIEWS ON DELLS NEW H2C COOLING GAMING COMPUTER I VERY INTRESTED IN THAT ONE </s>
<s> after looking at voodoo and falcon northwest i have decided on a voodoo omen. </s>
<s> from what i have researched they seem to be put together with the best craftsmanship. </s>
<s> In looking at the parts the prices came up about the same, falcons being a little more exspensive. </s>
<s> So it was all bout the company. </s>
<s> After enough research I have decided to go with Voodoo. </s>
<s> I looked at the new xps, it looked nice I am just not sure I want to go wit dell because of past experiences. </s>
<s> Also the falcon mach v and voodoo omen and area51 7500 out tested the dell xps in the research i found. </s>
<s> Personaly I think that the Alienware has the best bang for the buck but then Falcon NW has that tricked out paint job with the excellent customer service. </s>
<s> Voodoo has the awesome components and Dell has that cool form factor. </s>
<s> It's really hard to decide but you got to ask yourself which one do you want? </s>
<s> And I have a question of my own, does Alienware still have that cruddy customer service that's offered with the ALX systems? </s>
<s> Forget gaming - i need a computer i can use in the field and edit video with. </s>
<s> How's this 133 stand u? </s>
<s> This order was actually placed in late 2004, it's an old order, but it will at least illustrate all the pains I have gone thru in the life of this hellish PC Originally, I placed my order in November, but changed in mid December. </s>
<s> When I mentioned canceling, they said it would be a 25% fee to cancel, on a $6,500 PC, that's just ********. </s>
<s> Dell would have let me cancel the day before it was shipped without a &quot;fee&quot;. </s>
<s> The order was not received until about March. </s>
<s> A month after they had promised delivery. </s>
<s> When I opened it, the sound card was sitting inside the case, not even in a slot, and no loose screws in the box. </s>
<s> Despite that, system was wired and cabled neatly. </s>
<s> Worked great for about 2 months, then the problems came. </s>
<s> I was hearing the sounds of bubbles sloshing thru the water pump, very loud and annoying. </s>
<s> I had to contact them about it, and they instructed me how to refill the water tank. </s>
<s> I researched this, it was a saitek water cooling system ($200 retail), and the documentation indicated that VoodooPC mounted the tank backwards, and warned NOT to install it that way. </s>
<s> My system was running hot, and so hot that eventually I had memory problems. </s>
<s> This is a VERY SERIOUS problem, cause one or two bad windows updates with bad RAM will cause your system to get corrupted, so badly in fact I LOST ALL MY DATA! </s>
<s> Eventually the leak got so bad, it actually dripped off my CPU down to my power supply. </s>
<s> At that point I called their tech support and explained I wanted them to fix the leak, correct the improperly mounted water tank, and replace the power supply as it was now a fire hazzard. </s>
<s> To their credit, the RMA was quick and easy, but unfortunatly because of the price declaration, I had to pay additional tarrifs on the shipping, which alerted the state tax collectors in NJ. </s>
<s> I had to pay hundreds of dollars more for this POS because VoodooPC didn't properly assess the taxes on the PC. </s>
<s> When I did get the PC back, I still had leaks. </s>
<s> The top of the water tank was now badly cracked and had to use boat epoxy and caulk to seal it. </s>
<s> I still have to refill it from time to time. </s>
<s> Memory went bad again, and had to buy new chips to replace the bad ones. </s>
<s> It appears that they went bad a third time just recently, except this time the PC doesn't even recognize it now. </s>
<s> When I originally bought this system, there was a platinum upgrade plan, allowing you to upgrade it in the future. </s>
<s> I really didn't want to buy a new PC so I figured I ask VoodooPC if they could upgrade the components. </s>
<s> Their response was, that system is no longer offered by the company. </s>
<s> Mine was a Rage SLi, the exact same case as their current Omen system. </s>
<s> At every opportunity, this company and their POS system has let me down. </s>
<s> I WILL NEVER EVER GIVE THEM A SINGLE CENT FOR ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. </s>
<s> I would advise anyone considering them (or their HP equilavlent BlackBird) to look else where for a new system. </s>
<s> It is not worth it, not by a long shot. </s>
<s> For $6,500, you would expect pefection, and I got a big fat juicy lemon. </s>
<s> DO NOT BUY!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> run and hide cyber power will *uck your world up run run run </s>
<s> The computer got the name years ago when people put anything together and made it work..well most of the time. </s>
<s> The computer is good just find out what ware it has anything weird just don't buy it </s>
<s> The voodoo got its name from years ago when we would put computers together with anything we had and they worked ...most of the time. </s>
<s> thus voodoo They are systems that have been build from non standard parts..there good they don't have a company name on them. </s>
<s> Just find out what's it running..duo core, amd, good luck </s>
