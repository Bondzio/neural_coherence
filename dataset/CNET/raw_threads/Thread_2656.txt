Therefore I need a portable USB hard drive with a built in card reader that can read compact flash. Or, I'm not sure if hard drives come like this, but are there any USB hard drives that have their own USB port? If so then could I plug a card reader into the hard drive? I plan on being without computer or internet access for stretchs of a couple weeks at a time and I need a solid setup to encourage my digital photography. Thanks.
