<s> My mobo: ASRock 770icafe chipset : AMD RD770 Current CPU: AMD Athlon II x2 255 (Socket AM3 938) Can I buy any processor that says AM3, or do I have to take note on the number 938 and only buy something that has 938 in the title? </s>
<s> I tried googling this.... </s>
<s> It must be a dumb question.. For instance, I am looking at: AMD Phenom II X4 965 Black Edition Deneb 3.4GHz Socket AM3 125W Quad-Core Processor HDZ965FBGMBOX Does the number 965 have any significance? </s>
<s> Is it 965 pins and will not fit my socket am3 that only allows 938 pins? </s>
<s> Please, someone tell me I'm looking to far into this and slap me with a simple answer. </s>
<s> Thank you very much in advance. </s>
<s> All the motherboards I've ever bought come with a list of specifications for which processors they will support. </s>
<s> This can be restricted to a subset of all the CPUs with the same socket because of speeds and features that might not be supported. </s>
<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> And note what requirements the board writes for each CPU. </s>
<s> Long ago I ran into boards that did have the CPU on the list but required the BIOS be updated BEFORE you installed the CPU. </s>
<s> For those boards we had to have an older CPU to do the upgrade. </s>
<s> Frankly my vote was to RMA the lot. </s>

<s> What exactly looks bad? </s>
<s> Thanks, the page said it was down ealier. </s>
<s> I didn't know I had AM3+ socket xD (hopefully, assuming all ASRock 770iCafe are the same and I just had an older CPU in mine.) </s>
<s> And then I finally find the book that came with the mobo... </s>
<s> Which has a list of CPU's .. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time. </s>
