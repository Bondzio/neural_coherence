I'm trying to find information on what printers are the most environmentally friendly.
I bought an Epson inkjet several years ago, and they say the cartridges aren't recyclable, but HP cartridges are.
I'm also considering a laser printer, and want to know what the environmental issues are there too.
But so far I haven't found any info on this on cnet.
Can someone help?
