1.1.1	Alright , I 've knocked out the possiblity that it 's the keyboard/mouse , because I 've tried three different mouses , and two different keyboards .	St
1.1.2	The mouses are not picked up at all .	St
1.1.3	The keyboards are picked up , but not very well .	St
1.1.4	They work fine in Windows , but they do not respond in the BIOS .	St
1.1.5	It also takes multiple tries for the computer to pick up the pressing of the F1 key ( for entry to the bios ) .	St
1.1.6	This is not my own computer , this is a computer I 'm working on for a friend , and I 'm thoroughly stumped .	St
1.1.7	At the moment , I 've been dealing with using the numberpad to control the cursor , but I do n't want my friend to have to deal with that for the rest of the life of this computer .	St
1.1.8	It 's fairly new , only bought within the past six months or so .	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	The only item about the machine shared was the 6 months .	St
1.2.2	That 's a warranty issue .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	However , if sent away , I was told that they will do whatever they have to to fix it , without contacting us first either .	St
1.3.2	Which means , all the data might be wiped , so we have to back everything up first .	St
1.3.3	That 's not something that 's real fun without a mouse .	St
1.4.1	Did you just reveal there is no backup plan ?	Ques
1.4.2	Ouch .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Now there is , but there was n't .	St
1.5.2	We 've decided we are going to send it away , but I taught them how to back everything up so I did n't have to do it for them .	St
1.5.3	No , we were looking for a way that would not require a backup first .	St
1.5.4	It 's very tedius backing up files without a mouse , if you have n't tried before .	St
1.6.1	How can I avoid backup ?	Ques
1.6.2	The only answer I know of is to never put anything I want to keep on that machine .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Anyway you can help me explain that to someone who 's only computer skills are turning it on , getting into the internet , and checking e-mail ?	Ques
1.7.2	Really , I just assumed it was n't worth it .	St
1.8.1	It sounds like you wo n't be losing your files today .	St
1.8.2	& quot ; Anyway you can help me explain that to someone who 's only computer skills are turning it on , getting into the internet , and checking e-mail ? & quot ; In their case it looks like there is nothing to be saved .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	That 's one way of looking at it .	St
1.9.2	Nevertheless , I did show them one way of doing it , although difficult , and they 're waiting for the box to arrive any day now .	St
