I found that in Safe mode my display looks good.
But I also found I could set a new display size but that the box to set refresh rate was greyed out.
So no joy after rebooting.
I will move on to try other advice, such as re-installing the ATI card and drivers.
Thanks for your help, Bob (PS, for what I need, running in safe mode is also acceptable, just tedious)
