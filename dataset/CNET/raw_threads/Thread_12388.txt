What I am confused is the Setup shows 384MB of system memory and video memory as 128 MB. Similarly, Task manager on windows XP OS shows total physical memory as 384MB. Called up HP support, they said that video memory is taking 128 MB out of 512 MB thats why my system memory is 384 MB. Is tha true? Is it not that video cards( ATI Radeon 9000) shoud have its own 128 mb memory and my system should be having 512 MB separately. I just want to make sure that I am not cheated. Help me out you experts......

You want more memory for programs you can buy more and add it to the system, there is probably a second free memory slot to do this. You didn't get cheated, that's how it works.

The video taking from the base ram and providing the resources it needs. While some video ram can come strictly for itself on its own, more often than not it uses whatever the system memory provides. Check to see if you can tailor the video ram to a lesser amount using some ulitity pgm. or onboard bios setting. The only other option is to upgrade the system ram even more if capable to increase overall system memory. There are very few notebooks where the video ram itself is a separte item any more. Check your model's specs at HP support website, they provide that, surf there. good luck -----Willy

There is a setting in your video properties where you can select how much RAM is allocated to video depending on the PC. You might right click the desktop, Properties, Settings tab, Advanced. This will get you into your video card/drivers and you should be able to change the amount of RAM used. You damn sure don't need 128 Meg of RAM for a laptop screen.
