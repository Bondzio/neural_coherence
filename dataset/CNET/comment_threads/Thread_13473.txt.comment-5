If the reset jumper in the bios is closed the mobo will not start, try checking that.
I've had the same problem 2 times with separate asrock mobo but always was the power supply the issue.
I discovered that if I left the on button pushed for 5 seconds and then pushed again I can recreate kick off problem (the computer powers on briefly and the shut down).
