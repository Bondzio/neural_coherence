these new tvs with usb connections have other issues.
since the tv determines the format of the drive and more than why not a simple usb drive and be done with it?
you may want to forget usb and use the network feature if your tv supports it.
again this area is full of broken promises.
all you need to do is read the samsung and other forums to discover the pitfalls and more.
next time, supply the links to the hdtv so others can see what other solutions are out there.
my advice?
go get a common usb hard drive for under 99 bucks and we are done.
