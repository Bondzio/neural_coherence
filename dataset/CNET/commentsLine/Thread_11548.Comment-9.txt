seems to me corrugated cardboard would provide an insulation layer (more pieces = more &quot;r&quot; value) to the bottom of the unit, and aluminum foil would provide a reflective surface to radiate heat back to the laptop.
the triangular scale, or other spacer allowing air to circulate is the only thing to do unless and active cooler (ventilator) is used.
at home i just use a piece of hardboard (masonite) with a strip of wood glued to the top end to elevate the back end of the laptop letting air move and it makes a big difference in thigh temp!
reply to an old post - but still current problem.
