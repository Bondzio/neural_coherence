1.1.1	I recently did a fresh install of Windows XP Pro and threw in SP3 .	St
1.1.2	When I go to update drivers for my 8800GTX , my resolution and color drops from 1400x1050 - 32 bit down to 800x600 - 4 bit .	St
1.1.3	I tried to increase the settings but it drops the setting back down on its own .	St
1.1.4	I had to do a rollback to the previous drivers to fix the problem .	St
1.1.5	Is it the SP3 thats causing the issue or something else ?	Ques
1.1.6	The previous drivers that I 'm on right now came with the gfx card , which is 2+ years old and cant play any games with outdated drivers .	St
1.1.7	I 'm thinking about just going back to SP2 .	St
1.1.8	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	delete your display adapters in device manager before doing the install .	St
1.2.2	after rebooting , do not allow windows to reinstall the drivers .	St
1.2.3	then install the latest nvidia drivers -- that should fix what ails you .	St
1.3.1	OMG , there really IS a Holy Cow .	St
1.3.2	IT WORKED !	St
1.3.3	Thanks !	St
1.3.4	Can you explained to me what happened ?	Ques
1.3.5	All of my previous Driver updates , I 'd just click to update without having to do what you told me .	St
1.3.6	Is it just a new procedure that I have to go through with SP3 ?	Ques
1.4.1	who knows .	St
1.4.2	but if a device has become misconfigured , the driver installation should be replaced , not updated .	St
1.4.3	deleting the device and preventing windows from reinstalling it usually lets you do a clean driver instation , rather than updating the existing driver ( which is misconfigured ) .	St
