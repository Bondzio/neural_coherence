1.1.1	I am running a Dell Dimension DIM4600 with an Intel Pentium 4 CPU (2.66GHz), 512MB of RAM, and Windows XP Home Edition SP2.	St
1.1.2	I am looking into upgrading my RAM, so the system will run a bit faster, and for gaming purposes, but I don't know what RAM is compatible and what RAM isn't.	St
1.1.3	I want to upgrade to either 2GB or 4GB of RAM.	St
1.1.4	I was wondering if there is a website I can look at that will tell me what is compatible, and what isn't?	St
1.1.5	Thanks, Arcelios P.S.	St
1.1.6	: It would be very ideal if I could find something...less than expensive.	St
1.2.1	You need DDR1 memory.	St
1.2.2	Windows xp home edition can support up to 3Gb memory but your laptop motherboard only supports up to 2Gb.	St
1.2.3	your memory can not over 2Gb.	St
1.3.1	max memory is 4GB ddr-400 but the practical max for your OS edition and hardware is 2GB.	St
1.3.2	anything more will likely be unutilized.	St
