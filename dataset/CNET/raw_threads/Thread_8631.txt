I can't remove my video card, I think it's locked!	hi there, someone helped install my computer for me. however, i'm trying to send my pcie video card in for repairs and i don't know how to remove it from my motherboard. i can unscrew it and half of the video card comes out of the motherboard slot, but then there is one part of the video card that can just not come out. i asked my friend about it and he said something about a lock and pressing down on the lock would remove the video card, but he is not in town and cannot help me with this. i've tried searching for this lock and i found a gray thing at the end of the pcie slot, but it's rigid and i can't push down on it (nothing happens when i try). can someone please tell me what to do? thanks a lot.
