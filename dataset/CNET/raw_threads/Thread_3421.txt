Help me I'm desparately in need of help here, I have received a bootable copy of Windows 64 on a DVD. Im so eager to try it out, but the prob is I cant get it to boot in my system. No this is not a problem with the DVD , cos I tried it in the morning and it worked then ! ( meaning it booted into the Windows setup 'bluescreen' ). Since I dint have time then I thought I'd install it later. But in the eve when i popped the DVD into the Asus DVD Writer it didnt boot at all. My system is like ignoring the drive completely at startup and going into the Hard drive for booting. I tried with the Windows XP bootable CD that I used to setup XP on this machine and nor does it boot with that CD now. But previosuly it was working fine. Im sure this is some settings gone off in da BIOS, so could someone help me in giving the correct settings. No matter how much I change the boot priority ( from Hard drive to CDROM in the first boot device ) it doesnt work. I tried resetting the BIOS nor did it work then. I disabled RAID and that wudnt help either. The biggest mystery is that altho the drive is ignored at startup it is detected in Windows and Im able to run the DVD ( altho Im unable to setup Windows 64 within Windows , cos Windows XP is a 32 bit environment ) My MoBo and config are : Gigabyte GA-k8nf-9 motherboard, AMD Athlon64 3000+ ( 1.8 GHz clock ), ASUS 16X DVD Writer, 1 Hitachi 160 GB SATA drive 1 Maxtor 120 GB ATA Diamond Plus drive

It's jus 1 month old and was included with the first AMD system I built. But the mystery is the 2 IDE drives dont get detecetd at all when POSTing ( meaning they dont appear on the screen with their names ) but at times they DO ! When I first built my system and wanted to install Windows, I think I had truble here too and I cant remember what I did to get it work. And yesterday when i wanted to give a try with the BIOS again I started the PC and then it showed the 2 IDE drives at POSTing and when I went into the BIOS the 2 IDE drives were there with thier names under &quot;Standard CMOS Settings&quot; but when I restatrted the PC ( without saving chnages to BIOS and exitting ) then it did not show the names of the 2 drives at POST !

If it picks up then you rule out the drive or DVD being a problem. If it doesnt work try to flash your BIOS to a newer version. Long procedure but the process of elimination is a no fail. Good Luck... -Ciao
