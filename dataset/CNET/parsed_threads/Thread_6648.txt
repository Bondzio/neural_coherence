<s> Ok, i have a Dell Inspiron 1150 notebook with a Dell Truemobile 1300 WLAN card. </s>
<s> I am attempting to connect through a Netgear WGT624 (v1) router and all i am getting is Acquiring Network Address, and then nothing. </s>
<s> I am on XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> Any ideas of what may be causing this guys? </s>
<s> I have problems. </s>
<s> I turn off all the routers and wait 15 seconds. </s>
<s> Turn everything back on and then try to connect. </s>
<s> Everything is fine then. </s>
<s> I usually have this problem after a power outage and/or surge, thank goodness for surge protectors. </s>

<s> Such as did it ever work. </s>
<s> If not we look at testing at some hotspot which if that works we suspect the router (old firmware, dead, etc.) </s>
<s> If the hotspot test fails we think about spyware damage. </s>
<s> Of course my neighbor has the classic call. </s>
<s> I asked him to push the button to turn the wifi on the laptop. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It all worked fine when i first hooked it up. </s>
<s> I went through netgear's Smartwizard, and configured everything for the first time. </s>
<s> It worked great for a few days, then all of a sudden it started dropping the connection and then reconnecting, now it won't even renew the ip. </s>
<s> The router is still working just fine wired, and my computer recognizes the network on wireless, but refuses to Acquire the network address. </s>
<s> Maybe just a setting somewhere? </s>
<s> It should only be a setting if you had changed them from when it worked. </s>
<s> Try the usual and hold the reset on the router (see the manual) and run the setup wizard again. </s>
<s> However I'd test at a hotspot first so I know my PC is OK then the reset, wizard and if the laptop fails to connect in the same room, pack and return the router. </s>
<s> I've already noted updating firmware so I won't repeat that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If Verizon, the Westell modem/router uses the same ip address as the Netgear router. </s>
<s> You'd have to change the ip address in the Netgear router to prevent the conflict. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> I have Earthlink broadband through Time Warner Cable. </s>
<s> I will try to locate a good hotspot to see if i get anything there. </s>
<s> Thanks guys. </s>
<s> I'll also look for a reset, but i have unplugged everything, given it time to reset, and plugged it back in, but same same. </s>
<s> I'll update again once i hit a hotspot. </s>
