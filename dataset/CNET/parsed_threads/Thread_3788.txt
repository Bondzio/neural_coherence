<s> I have an old motherboard that is used in a Digital Video Recorder. </s>
<s> The motherbaord is a 2003 Bayfield, the memory chip is a 256MB SDRAM DDR DIMM 184 PC133. </s>
<s> I want to put a 1 Gig chip in but not sure if the faster chips will work in the motherboard. </s>
<s> I dont need the faster speed chip, but they are all that is available now and also much cheaper. </s>
<s> Do you think a PC2700 or something similar will work in a 2003 Bayfield Motherboard. </s>
<s> I think all it takes is One Memory Chip. </s>
<s> I haven't opened the case up yet because I need it recording my store. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> PC133 should be 168 pin but you mentioned DDR 184 PC133. </s>
<s> That 184 is a valid pin count so I'm not sure what you have but the mix isn't compatible. </s>
<s> You'll need to open the case, I suspect. </s>
<s> I can't find that board at Crucial so maybe it has another name. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=cctv&q=2003+Bayfield+MOTHERBOARD finds this board. </s>
<s> The problem is that many chipsets didn't support such large memory sticks back then for simple reasons. </s>
<s> I won't detail how the world has changed but I find some that find it incredible that a machine today doesn't support today's sticks and drives. </s>
<s> But it is so. </s>
<s> Moving on. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/dsktpboards/d865gbf might be this board. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d865gbf/sb/CS-027111.htm does list a 1GB stick so all that you can do is try it and hope the stick's organization is fine. </s>
<s> This is not to offer a course in memory tech but to write I find the speed to not be the problem here but the organization. </s>
