Looking to upgrade my eMachine T5026.
Putting in a Gigabyte GA-MA69GM-S2H and AMD64 X2 6000+ CPU,2GB DDR2 800 Ram.
The power supply that comes with the T5026 I believe is 300w, is this enough to power my new system or do I need to go 500w.
Thanks in advance Also i'm using integrated graphics, may use PCIe slot in the future.
