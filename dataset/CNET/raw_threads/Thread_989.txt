I was using it with my old desktop computer when the ole girl went kaput. Id like to use this printer with my Dell Latitude D820 laptop computer but the laptop doesnt have a compatible connector. Is there any way to hook up these two components via an adapter or something? I'm using WIN XP Pro as my OS. Thanks
