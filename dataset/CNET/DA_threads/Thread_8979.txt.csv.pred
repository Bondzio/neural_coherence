1.1.1	I had installed the graphics card on my PC (emachines T3882) with an intergrated graphics card.	St
1.1.2	So i had set up the graphics card right and disabled the integrated one.	St
1.1.3	Then i went to their website to install a more recent driver which they said came out April 15, 2005.	St
1.1.4	Then after installing they asked me to restart and i did but after it started the screen was just black.	St
1.1.5	I could not see anything so to make it work i had to take out the nvidia card and i uninstalled the drivers.	St
1.1.6	now if i plug the card back in will i have to update the drivers?	St
1.1.7	Couldn't i just stay with the ones that came on the CD?	St
1.2.1	if it works with what was on the CD use those just out of interest, what version is on the CD?	St
1.2.2	(i'm guessing somewhere between 56.xx and 66.xx)	St
1.3.1	i am not sure where i can find the verson of the drivers.	Res
1.3.2	when i installed the graphics card and then used the CD to install the drivers it said that the drivers that were on the PC were newer than the ones on the CD so i said not to install it.	St
1.3.3	I guess Windows automatically downloaded the drives but what is weird is that i did not see anything saying it was installing it.	St
1.3.4	I guess the pc came with the drivers installed	St
