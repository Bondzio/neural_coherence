1.1.1	Hello, I have a WSN, as applied part for BSc dregree .. and I need some advices please:),and I mention that I don't know very much about this subject (even if I am at a faculty with such profile ..) but I want to &quot;struggle&quot; .. for this degree and until this mom.	St
1.1.2	, I read something on the net, in some books ..so , I have an idea of what I want to do: Wireless Network (WSN) will be composed of four sensors that detect smoke .. placed in two adjacent rooms, besides the four sensors I need a gateway = node (which in this case I don't know what it can be(Access Point or Router Wireless or smth else)) to the four sensors that transmit ... and the gateway node will be wired to the PC .	St
1.1.3	Now, questions would be more .. but currently I am sticking to what could be the devices for this kind of wireless network?	St
1.1.4	And what type of network will be?	St
1.1.5	ad hoc, LAN .. .. or something else?	St
1.1.6	Thanks in	St
1.2.1	Mostly your question should be what do the sensors devices support.	St
1.2.2	Most these type of devices use a proprietary communication method even if they use 2.4g.	St
1.2.3	You have to remember these do not run intel/AMD type processors.	St
1.2.4	These processors are very limited but cost more than the general PC ones, not sure why the cost.	St
1.2.5	There really is no need to run a full IP stack and then wireless much less WEP,WPA etc etc for a device that sends very little data.	St
1.2.6	The overhead in the IP packets will be more than the data.	St
1.2.7	So if we assume such devices exist and support wireless.	St
1.2.8	The application is hub and spoke since it is unlikely the devices need to talk to each other.	St
1.2.9	You could run adhoc but a simple AP will be easiest.	St
