<s> from past experience with LCD tvs, i know that the native resolution of an LCD always produces the best picture. </s>
<s> i just bought a Samsung 32&quot; LCD hdtv (LN-T3253H), and was planning on hooking my laptop up to it, but my laptop does not output WXGA (1366X768). </s>
<s> is there any way to make a video output at this resolution? </s>
<s> if not what is the best resolution to run an LCD TV at? </s>
<s> just for reference: i will be using a the TV's VGA input, also my laptop has a nvidia Geforce GO 7600 PCI-E video card. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> that's the resolution of 720p so most LCD TVs render it nicely. </s>
<s> depending on your laptop's graphics chip, you may be able to manually add the 1366x768 resolution. </s>
