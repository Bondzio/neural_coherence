I would like to be able to keep the PC in my bedroom, but be able to use it in my living room by using another monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse.
So I was looking for a longer monitor cable, about 50ft.
Right now I have it connected with the monitor cable that came with a Dell monitor.
I guess your standard monitor cable.
So I just want to buy a longer version of that..Will any 50ft VGA cable do?
It's just a regular Dell Monitor.
And my computer info is below,just in case you need it.
