When I first set up my home network, we only had 2 computers connecting to the internet, a Compaq desktop pc which is connected via cat-5 to the back of the router and an HP laptop that connects over the wireless. recently our family has added 2 more laptops and an xbox 360 to the network. all was good for about 3-4 months then we started getting disconnected frequently. iv had people tell me its my network security, so iv tried non at all, wep, and wpa, all giving me nothing. i tried flashing the router with dd-wrt, nothing changed at all, still getting disconnected randomly. its like the router has a mind of its own. iv also been told to trade in for a new modem, which is what i will end up doing if nothing else works. i would really appreciate some help.

Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 As it stands today there is no place to hide in &quot;no-security&quot; and WEP. I've seen too many wifi setups failing and fixed too many with the move to WPA. + -&gt; Change the RF channel. Try 1 then 5 or 6 then 11. If need be, get wired. The less wifi clients the better. Also, don't expect the move to WPA to instantly knock the pest off your back. I had one system that they attacker didn't give up for days. Hope this helps, Bob

This area is fairly new so you won't get too many to flatly state this but the last year has me writing this. The security angle is still a possibility since we had that one instance where the attacker was clogging up the channel for days. It was not friendly and about a week later the client is finally happy that we solved it. Those first few days were rough. As to old router it could be. Our tech carries spare routers to make a quick switch when that is the suspect. Routers are cheap when the man or woman is on the clock. Bob

So all output the same &quot;strength&quot;. Those with MIMO and other tricks help but offer no more strength than any other router. You can focus the signal with antennas and relay it with repeaters or bridges. The biggest obstacle would be an owner that wants a &quot;guarantee.&quot; There is none since it's uncontrolled RF air space. However we can improve it with the items noted. So it all comes down to buying the parts and implementing. Bob
