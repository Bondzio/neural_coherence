i dodn't remember the name brand of my first computer, but it had 4 megs of ram and a 261 meg hard drive and a 14,440 modem and was top of the line.
i thought i was in heaven after learning on my wife's apple 2e that she brought home from her teaching job every summer.
oh the memories when we were young!
well i was 40 at the time.
