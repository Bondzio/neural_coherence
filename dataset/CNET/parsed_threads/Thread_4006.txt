<s> Currently, I have an Athlon XP 2000+ CPU and 512MB PC2700 333MHz RAM. </s>
<s> I believe the CPU can only operate at the 233 FSB level. </s>
<s> The MB is MSI KT333 Ultra. </s>
<s> I am looking to upgrade without upgrading the motherboard which can support upto XP 2700+. </s>
<s> Would it be worth the money to upgrade to the Athlon 2700+ XP CPU and 1GB RAM? </s>
<s> to first spend the money on a better mobo and get like a 3000+ or 3200+ processor. </s>
<s> I would leave the RAM for a later time. </s>
<s> FYI, I have a 2000xp with 512mb it will do a SETI unit in 4~5 hours. </s>
<s> I also have a 2700xp with 1gb it will do a SETI unit 3~4 hours. </s>
<s> So draw you own conclusion. </s>
