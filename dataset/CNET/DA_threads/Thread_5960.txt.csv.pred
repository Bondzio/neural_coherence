1.1.1	I upgraded the RAM on a Dell 131L laptop from two 512 MB cards to two 1 GB cards .	St
1.1.2	I purchased the RAM from an Ebay store .	St
1.1.3	It is DDR2 533 MHz .	St
1.1.4	The specs on this system say it can handle up to 2.05 GB .	St
1.1.5	The cards register on the system as 1.9 GB .	St
1.1.6	When I initially installed the new RAM the computer would boot normally and operate with improved speed for the duration of that first boot .	St
1.1.7	On subsequent boots Windows either would not boot or would crash within 5-10 min ( blue screen of death ) .	St
1.1.8	I went through two or three rounds of installing the old RAM and running it for awhile ( with no troubles ) and then installing the new RAM ( after which the same series of events would occur as I just described ) .	St
1.1.9	After reading several internet forums ( including this one ) and visiting the seller 's troubleshooting site , I went to the Dell website and updated the BIOS .	St
1.1.10	This solved the problem of Windows crashing within 5-10 min on subsequent boots .	St
1.1.11	The computer would run normally during active use but when left alone with no programs open several hours Windows crashes .	St
1.1.12	I do n't know how long it takes for it to crash , just that when I return to the computer , the blue screen of death is up .	St
1.1.13	The message says something like & quot ; new hardware has been installed and is causing a problem .	St
1.1.14	If this is the first time to see this message re-install the hardware .	St
1.1.15	If it is not the first time ... & quot ; I do n't know the exact wording because each of the two times it has happened , my girlfriend ( its her laptop ) has just shut the computer down .	St
1.1.16	Today I downloaded memtest86+ version 4.10 and ran each memory card on the program .	St
1.1.17	I ran one card for 5 passes with no errors .	St
1.1.18	The other card is currently on its 3rd pass with no errors ( I will let it run a full 5 passes ) .	St
1.1.19	I will happily provide any other system info if it will help , just did n't want to make the post longer than it is right now .	St
1.1.20	What should my next step be to solve the problem ?	Ques
1.1.21	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	If both cards apart test OK , do n't forget to test with both cards together ( so the full 2 MB ) .	St
1.2.2	I do n't really see what you mean with : - the specs saying it can handle up to 2.05 GB , because there are not .05 GB cards - the cards register as 1.9 GB .	St
1.2.3	1+1=2 , not 1.9 .	St
1.2.4	Where do you see that strange amount ?	Ques
1.2.5	Kees	St

1.4.1	I went to crucial.com and used their software to scan my computer for available memory upgrades .	St
1.4.2	They list this model as having a maximum of 2048 MB ( 1000MB is a GB right ? ) .	St
1.4.3	I believe that is what is listed on the Dell website as well .	St
1.4.4	When I posted I converted to GB and rounded up .	St
1.4.5	As far as the 1.9 GB , I went through the control panel to the system properties icon under the & quot ; General & quot ; tab .	St
1.4.6	Here it lists the the OS w/ service pack , computer model , CPU and amount of RAM .	St
1.4.7	For example , I am currently running the computer on one 1GB memory card but when I go through the control panel it lists 896 MB of RAM .	St
1.4.8	I am not sure about the weird numbers either ( maybe a difference between binary/base2 vs decimal/base 10 notation ? ) .	St
1.4.9	Sorry for the confusion .	St
1.5.1	I will run memtest with both cards in and report back .	St
1.5.2	I have done some more internet reading and found that it may be a motherboard issue ?	Ques
1.5.3	I found a site where someone had a nearly identical problem to mine and he concluded his motherboard could not handle that amount of RAM even though the spec sheet stated that it could .	St
1.5.4	Any thoughts on that ?	Ques
1.5.5	Thanks for your help so far .	Polite

1.6.1	or 1024MBs ( 1 DIMM ) minus 128MBs allocated for video RAM for systems with onboard graphics leaves you 1.92GBs or 896MBs respectively .	St
1.6.2	Bottom line , your system will always show something different than the actual RAM installed .	St
1.6.3	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Running memtest with both cards installed showed several failures at test 8 pass 3 .	St
1.7.2	Any suggestions for fixing the problem ?	Ques
1.8.1	How did you select the memory ?	Ques
1.8.2	What did you do to ensure it was the right kind for your system and would be compatible ?	Ques
1.8.3	Please provide brand and model numbers on the memory .	St
1.9.1	If the sticks apart are OK , it seems more like a motherboard issue indeed .	St
1.9.2	I do n't expect the seller of the sticks to return your money .	St
1.9.3	So now it 's time to contact Dell tech support , maybe ?	Ques
1.9.4	Either they acknowledge it 's a motherboard error or they have you buy Dell certified memory .	St
1.9.5	If that does n't work either , Dell at least should give your money back .	St
1.9.6	If the original Dell memory works , you can return the sticks you bought now as defective or not compatible and ask your money back .	St
1.9.7	Kees	St
1.10.1	RAM speed .	St
1.10.2	The spec shows ... . Memory module connector	St
1.11.1	I searched ebay for Dell 131L laptop memory and chose a seller because of his 30 day money back guarantee and free shipping .	St
1.11.2	In retrospect , I did n't do anything to ensure compatibility .	St
1.11.3	The memory is Avant brand DDR2 PC2-4200 533 MHz .	St
1.11.4	I just noticed that the memory Crucial recommends is DDR2 PC2-5300 .	St
1.11.5	While I am not sure the of difference between 4200 and 5300 , I would be willing to bet that is what is causing my problem .	St
1.11.6	I 'd be open to any advice you may deem pertinent at this point .	St
1.11.7	The memory is going back Mon and I will give Crucial a try .	St
1.11.8	Thanks	Polite
1.12.1	Long story short , the seller sent me new RAM and the computer is working well .	St
1.12.2	More details below if anyone is interested ... .	St
1.12.3	I contacted the seller and made arrangements to return the RAM for a refund .	St
1.12.4	A mistake was made on the seller 's end and they processed it as an exchange .	St
1.12.5	Good thing I decided to wait until I saw the money refunded in my account before buying the RAM from Crucial .	St
1.12.6	Since I did n't realize the mistake had been made until I received the replacement RAM , I decided to give it a try before sending it back .	St
1.12.7	The computer has ran with no problems for the past week .	St
1.12.8	Still , I think I will try Crucial next time .	St
1.12.9	Thanks again for all the advice .	St
1.13.1	out with a working PC and more RAM .	St
