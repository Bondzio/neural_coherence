The seller was a Vista user and didn't reformat the drive before sending it to me. I tried the HDD on my XP PC, and though the power light came on and the computer recognized it, I couldn't see it in Explorer. When I go into Disk Management, I can see it there, but when I right click on it all the options - including Format - are greyed out. The drive works fine on my Vista laptop though. When I went into Disk Management there with the drive connected, I could see it and reformat it. So I did, but when I plugged it back into my PC it still didn't appear in Explorer. I've also tried a fix I read in some other forum - disabling my 1394 connection and rebooting, but that didn't work either. I need the drive to work on both systems so I can transfer files from my PC to my laptop. I'd appreciate any help.

The &quot;delete partition&quot; option and all others are greyed out in Disk Management when I right click on it. But, unlike my two internal hard drives, this one has little diagonal grey lines through it's section of the lower right pane, and it reads &quot;Healthy (GPT Protective Partition)&quot; instead of &quot;Healthy (Active).&quot;

It's why I try to help others find out about the issues and what words to use at Google or search bars. Bob

But I did find another fix - http://blog.paulgu.com/2008/01/06/how-to-delete-gpt-protective-partition/ - that showed me how to use DOS commands to completely wiped the drive, and that worked. ^_^
