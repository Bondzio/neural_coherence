<s> I am planning on buying a wifi router. </s>
<s> However i am confused between 3 of them. </s>
<s> Please help me on choosing the best possible one. </s>
<s> Here's the link of all 3. </s>
<s> Cisco Linksys E900 Wireless-N300 Router Belkin Basic Surf (N300) Router Netgear JNR3000 N300 Gigabit Router And here is the URL in which i've compared all 3 of them. </s>
<s> Comparison </s>
<s> I got it to work after I read advice to go back a firmware version. </s>
<s> I see new firmware but why did it take them months? </s>
<s> Sorry, I'd remove netgear. </s>
<s> My neighbor had too many problems with the Cisco models so by removing those names we are left with the Belkin. </s>
<s> Even Belkin has had issues in the past such as http://www.michaelhanscbsi.com/eclecticism/2003/11/07/belkin-routers-hijacking-websurfing/ but that's a decade ago and they corrected this and learned their lesson from what I can tell. </s>

<s> try ASUS DSL-N10E i've been using this from last 8 months have not encountered even a single problem till date .. the range i quite good too ! </s>
<s> While you cannot go wrong with Cisco or Netgear , you should relly also include Dlink Routers. </s>
<s> Wireless AC1200 Dual Band Gigabit Cloud Router DIR-860L </s>
<s> Cisco has some models that are pretty poor in coverage. </s>
<s> And Netgear had that issue for months about connections with Apple products. </s>
<s> My advice is to return defects rather than try to work with the makers. </s>
