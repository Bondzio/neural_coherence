i did some internet &quot;window&quot; shopping yesterday and came up with four pc's that seem ready for vista right out of the box.. two were gaming pc's.. and two were not.. ...................................................................... #1...dell at $$5400.00/xps 710 h2c .. #2...dell at $$1900.00/xps 710....these both would use duo core and ddr2 ram modules at 667mhz../ .. #3...dell at $$700.00/dimension 9200..i would pass on the pentium d and also get a duo core processor..that pc might run $$1200.00 .. #4...hp at $$900.00/pavilion media center m7790y series.. ...................................................................... if you get a 160-gb hdd..from my understanding it must be partitioned to run windows..windows does not operate over 120-gb's.. so i would just get a 80-gb hdd..because external hdd are a real positive in running a desktop..for archiveing your files/folders..i use 4-external hdd.. ...................................................................... i have two pc's useing a 30-gb system drive and a 80-gb system drive.. both are western digital hd's.. ...................................................................... for video games....i would switch to the xbox or sony ps3...nintendo...what-ever..video games are rough on the pc hardware in my opinion.. ...............[end]
