<s> I have some files (family videos) having close to 1gb. </s>
<s> Can you tell me if a dvd recorder (dobule layer) will be good? </s>
<s> Im worried if everybody will be able to see it. </s>
<s> What is the best bet? </s>
<s> Adolfo </s>
<s> I'm currently using a 45 dollar TEAC all format DVD recorder. </s>
<s> There is some issue that DVD PLAYERS don't play recorded media, some will do DVD+R, some like DVD-R and some play both. </s>
<s> I had to add a field to my contact list as to which type to send them! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Sure a double layer is not needed for that file size, but since they are getting cheap, Im planning to get them unless there are bigger problems with them. </s>
<s> I mean, the only difference is the size of data that the disk will hold right? </s>
<s> Adolfo </s>
<s> But I expect you to find that sending a double layer to friends and family to result in a better than 50% reduction in who can play it in their DVD players. </s>
<s> Just my advice. </s>
<s> Buy the recorder if you want, but send out the single layer media... Bob </s>
<s> You need a good media (use branded one)and a very good burning software. </s>
<s> Some softwares will not allow you to view the recorded clip in normal household DVD players while others have slides or errors in it. </s>
<s> Just an added information. </s>
