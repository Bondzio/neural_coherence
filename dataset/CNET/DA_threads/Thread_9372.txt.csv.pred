1.1.1	Three main questions .	St
1.1.2	1 ) I 'm upgrading some peripherals ... drives , RAM , HD ... how can I know how much power my system requires now and how much it will after the upgrades ?	Ques
1.1.3	2 ) I 'm limited ( very ) in my CPU upgrade .	St
1.1.4	I have a P4 1.4GHz and specs allow for 1.8 .	St
1.1.5	I came across some kits that state they can upgrade to higher processors ( 2.8 ) with the use of an adapter .	St
1.1.6	What are the benefits/problems of using such kits ?	Ques
1.1.7	3 ) Finally , again regarding my CPU , which is supposed to have a 400Hz BUS .	St
1.1.8	I recently ran a utility test and the results were that it was running at 100 .	St
1.1.9	What can cause this difference ?	Ques
1.1.10	If anyone can help with any of these I 'd appreciate it .	Ques
1.2.1	To run at 400 MHz FSB you need DDRSDRAM [ DDR 200 ] .	St
1.2.2	Are you sure what the 100 MHz report REALLY means .	St
1.2.3	The DDR 200 is actually 100 MHz memory that gets double clocked .	St
1.2.4	[ =200 ] , then gets quad clocked as the FSB from the MCH to the CPU [ =400 ] .	St
1.2.5	Then , of course , the multiplier in the CPU multiplies that up to run the CPU at its rated speed .	St
1.2.6	What speed is the CPU reporting .	St
1.2.7	If you were not actually acheiving the 400 MHz FSB the CPU would be running less than 1.4 GHz .	St
1.2.8	I do n't think that DDR came any less than 100 MHz , so think that it simply the reporting scheme being confusing .	St
1.2.9	Now there were some mobos that would take either SDRAM or DDRSDRAM [ different physical sockets ] and could not be mixed .	St
1.2.10	If perchance you are running with PC 100 SDRAM that would actually be only 100 MHz .	St
1.2.11	Many BIOSes will give the basic memory speed [ 100 MHz in this case ] as the setting to get the 400 MHz FSB .	St
1.2.12	It varies by mobo/BIOSes .	St
1.2.13	Do you have the manual ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.14	?	Ques
1.3.1	I guess I should 've included this , but I 'm running PC800 RDRAM in my system .	St
1.3.2	Because it was a custom order they left out several of the hardware manuals .	St
1.3.3	It 's now that I 'm upgrading some things that I 've been looking into the specifics .	St
1.3.4	And your responce gave me an idea , so I found a new tool that showed my speed back at 400 .	St
1.3.5	The one that was giving me 100 was from Compaq 's ( HP ) site .	St
1.3.6	I contacted them as well , and by their lack of information and knowledge in their responce , I think that their tool was more of a basic preconfigured automated responce for standard prebuilt units ( which carry the regular RAM like you mentioned ) .	St
1.3.7	Since mine was custom , it did n't fit the profile that was given .	St
1.3.8	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.4.1	I agree with the other replys , that your reported 100mhz buss speed is not something to worry about .	St
1.4.2	It is a multiple of 400 , and 800 , so you are probably doing just fine .	St
1.4.3	It does get doubled then quad pumped to the memory buss on most motherboards .	St
1.4.4	On the cpu upgrade , make sure you have enough power supply , 350 watt will be good .	St
1.4.5	400 watt is even better if you want to overclock .	St
1.4.6	The newer processor will generate more heat , so be sure you have a good cooling fan and a well vented case .	St
1.4.7	Additional case fans are good if you have the space to add them .	St
1.4.8	They are cheap insurance against component failure .	St
1.4.9	No advice on the cpu adapter kits ... .use caution .	St
