hi this decision is painfully difficult for me right now.
i can't decide between tablet hybrids.
i know the specs and everything, but the design type is eluding me.
i need to use a tablet mostly as an e-reader and math writer (stylus) for my books and math class, but i need it to function well with a keyboard for typing essays and reports for english, science, ss, theology.
the ultimate goal is to have a mid-cheap atom based tablet plus keyboard, preferred to have trackpad.
most have 2gb lpddr2 and 1.5(1.8)ghz clover trail.
i'd like to keep it in the atom tablet range to keep it cheap.
i'm mostly stuck between tablets like the asus vivotab tf810c, and the dell latitude 10 business model plus bluetooth keyboard case and larger battery.
other than that, hp envy x2 is nice, but no digitizer.
any help with this or added tablet options would be great.
with the asus vivotab, i'm reaching $870 with msd card and keyboard dock.
this is getting into ultrabook range, but the lenovo yoga doesn't support active digitizers, and i don't know any other convertibles in this range that reach 8+hr for a full day's use at school.
