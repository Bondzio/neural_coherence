Yes, I'm sure this is a more immediate fix than the route I'm currently following - But, it discounts the fact that I am an old, obstinent, bull-headed codger with an intense desire to work out the bugs from my current buggy setup.
If the current setup just flatout did nothing, then I'd sure look for an alternate solution such as a print server, or even Network Magic (which I also know will solve this as well), but each of those would require an investment which I simply don't have - $50 may be inexpensive from your perspective, but from mine, it'd require a budget adjustment I'd be hard pressed to make!
It's as simple as that.
So, I am very thankful for your willingness to assist in my quest, and if you have any additional insight into how we might tweek it a bit more, I'd love to hear your ideas - In the meantime, I'm going to continue looking for answers to my frustration.
Much appreciation, ajtrek.
