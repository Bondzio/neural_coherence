we would never run any wap over a dozen connections.
you gone over 10 tens that.
nice idea, if it works but it didn't so if you believe this router can do that many connections then you know who to call next.
you also know that wifi interference is common but i see no mention of that in your post.
there is a bug that seems to be in many router firmware versions and it's one i encounter a lot.
i see no mention of where you tried the latest and a few prior versions.
i'll be honest with you, i would not expect that many connections to work reliably.
there are many reasons since you have 50 odd computers and all it takes is one bad one to misbehave and knock others off the air.
i mitigate that with more than one wap.
