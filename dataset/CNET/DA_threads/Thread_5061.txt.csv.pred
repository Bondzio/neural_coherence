1.1.1	So I just got a motherboard to work with, and I need some help with its graphics.	St
1.1.2	It is a Socket 775 Motherboard, with a Pentium D, 3.4 GHz.	St
1.1.3	First of all, its a 24-pin power supply slot in the motherboard, but I only have a 20-pin power supply connected.	St
1.1.4	I've read that that shouldn't be a problem as long as I don't use any PCI cards, thus I haven't used any.	St
1.1.5	However... Everything is hooked up as it should be, and it powers on and everything, but my monitor remains in standby mode.	St
1.1.6	I tried to turn it off, and turn it back on, and that didn't work.	St
1.1.7	I have no clue why the integrated graphics aren't working.	St
1.1.8	Does anyone else know?	Ques
1.1.9	So after this all happened, I put in a graphics card.	St
1.1.10	However, the graphics slot is PCIe x16, and the only card that I have that will fit is a dual-DVI-E. No problem, I just bought a DVI to VGA converter.	St
1.1.11	So I put that in, plug it all in, and it still doesn't work!	St
1.1.12	This is driving me crazy, and I need to come up with a solution quick because this is my dads main computer.	St
1.2.1	It's a shame the make and model of the video card was not supplied.	St
1.2.2	Some will never drive a VGA display.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	My bad.	St
1.3.2	I tried it with a Radeon HD2600Pro, 256MB DDR3.	St
1.3.3	If that won't drive a VGA display, thats fine, but I still am wondering about how to get the integrated graphics to work.	St
1.3.4	Thanks!	St
1.4.1	There are too many cards that fit your description but DVI does not mean and adapter will work.	St
1.4.2	Try a DVI or HDMI display next.	St
1.4.3	For me to check further, I'll need MAKE and MODEL NUMBER on that &quot;Radeon HD2600Pro, 256MB DDR3&quot;.	St
1.5.1	I found the problem - two of my RAM sticks were ECC, and I didn't know it.	St
1.5.2	As far as the adapter goes, I'm happy to believe that the graphics card couldn't support VGA.	St
1.5.3	Thanks all!	St
