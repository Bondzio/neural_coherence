i'm positive that the venue's internet connection is not dial up or better than 56k.
the standard voltage in the philippines is 220v but there are adapters available locally so it's not a problem.
can you give me an advice on the security camera set up based on how i want the event to be broadcasted.
the camera that i was thinking is the one with it's own ip address so other people can log in and view it also.
do you think this is possible for multiple viewers?
please advice.
thank you.
