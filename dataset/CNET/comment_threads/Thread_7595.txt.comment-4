Hi Bob, Tried that and I got lost.
I'm probably not doing something right.
My scanner works on another computer so it is definitely something on my computer.
It still doesn't recognise the scanner.
I have checked with Norton and it's nothing to do with the firewall or security system as it still was not recognised when they were turned off.
I'm now looking for remote assistance for someone to check my system through.
I did use CNET 24 once but I can't find it now.
Kind regards John
