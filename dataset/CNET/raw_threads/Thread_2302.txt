I have disconnected it and re-connected my old Voyager 2091 router which is working perfectly. Finding that this worked, I replaced the Voyager with the Belkin, but it still fails to connect the internet (amber light flashing so I am back on the Voyager!). I would prefer to be using the Belkin - any suggestions to cure the modem? Thanks

It is just called an &quot;Belkin N wireless Modem Router&quot; I think the internet supply is called ADSL. I bought it just one year ago but it has not had a lot of use as I ran my Voyager for aprt of the time.. Is it possible that it could suddenly have died?

I have contacte the Belkin help desk, but, after three lengthy emails from them and having followed all their guidance, I still get no contact. However, taking into account that the Belkin router will not work on either of my two computers (one is a MAC and the others a Windows XP) and also that my old router works perfectly on both, it seems likely too me that the router itself has a fault. Rather than waste any more time on it, I have decided to cut my losses and dump the router! Many thanks for you comments Gerald
