1.1.1	i am currently using a 200 gig ata drive running office xp 2003. i want to add a new 80 gig ata drive for strickly game use.i have 512 memory and a 2.8 intel 4 processor and mother board .	St
1.1.2	can some one please tell me the best way to set up the new drive so that i can still maintain maximum speed and performance with 2 drives .	Ques
1.1.3	do i need a raid drive or what ? ?	Ques
1.1.4	if so how do i configure one thanks	Polite
1.2.1	As to installing the drive , it 's no different than any other drive and you follow the makers install instructions .	St
1.2.2	If you do n't then you have your reasons why .	St
1.2.3	As to RAID , that is again where you get a RAID controller and follow the instructions .	St
1.2.4	Worth noting is that with just a 200GB and one 80GB drive , you do n't have enough drives to make a RAID setup .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	There is no reason adding a second drive would slow either one down , as long as you jumper the drive correctly ( probably both will be jumpered CS ) then it will use UDMA 5 and you will get optimal performance .	St
1.3.2	To use RAID you need to have identical size drives .	St
1.3.3	To use RAID 0 you need to start with 2 new drives and build the OS from the beginning , you ca n't just add a 2nd drive and RAID them together .	St
1.3.4	If you use RAID 0 and either drive dies you lose all data on both drives .	St
1.4.1	I have to make some assumptions here : 1 .	St
1.4.2	That your C drive is on the primary master .	St
1.4.3	2 .	St
1.4.4	That you have a primary slave drive on the same IDE .	St
1.4.5	If you want to put an 80gb hard drive as a secondary slave on your ATA you should have no problems in doing so .	St
1.4.6	Just install the game on this drive .	St
1.4.7	Keep in mind that no matter what drive you install the game on some system files needed will be stored on your C drive .	St
1.4.8	Also make sure that this drive is the same speed as your 200gb hard drive .	St
1.4.9	Most are 7200 RPM these days .	St
1.4.10	You should not really notice any performance degradation in setting it up this way .	St
1.4.11	You do n't really need to set up a RAID array for this .	St
1.4.12	If you did , you would need to have another 200gb hard drive to do so .	St
1.5.1	I tend to setup dual drives as primary on each IDE / ATA port , with CD drives and DVD 's as secondary .	St
1.5.2	This maximizes transfers from the hard drives .	St
1.5.3	This is especially true if you are doing a lot of disk access or program swapping due to low memory .	St
1.5.4	If however your games etc .	Polite
1.5.5	require the CD or DVD to be online , then hook the two hard drives up on the same port and your CD and DVD drives on the other .	St
1.5.6	Same reason , so that you are not constantly swapping between the CD and a hard drive on the same port .	St
