especially for gaming, an athlon 64 3000+ would be a much better choice than a p4 520. in doom 3 for example, an athlon 64 3000+( $133 for the socket 754, or $150 for the socket 939 ) beats a $780 pentium 4 3.2 ghz ee.
it is also a great performer for other games and general use.
the socket 754 athlon 64 3000+ is cheaper than the 939 version, and the 754 motherboard is also cheaper, but the 939 motherboard will give more room for future upgrades, and a 90nm socket 939 will probably use less power and run cooler than a 130 nm socket 754 one.
it doesn't make sense to even consider a 2.8 ghz (520) pentium 4 at $162, when for less you can get an athlon 64 3000+ which beats a pentium 4 3 ghz (or even a much faster p4) in most games.
