<s> I am unable to share my PC with my smart TV. </s>
<s> I have checked &quot;share files/drives&quot; on my PC to no avail. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> My TV sees the computer in the network, however when I go to open it, I only get access to C/users/pictures/video, (the demo ones) that came with the PC. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I also do not have my audio and video, pics in the &quot;My Documents&quot; part of my C drive. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> They are all on my D drive and I think there in lies the problem? </s>
<s> How can I access my other drives so they will be accessible on my TV? </s>
<s> Thanks for any info! </s>
<s> A TV is not a PC so that's the short reason why. </s>
<s> Also, many require us to install some DLNA server and that app (DLNA server) may only be coded to share specific folders. </s>
<s> You can imagine the security types would go bonkers if a TV could see all files on your PC. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You will need to right-click on the folder(s) on your D: drive and select the &quot;Sharing&quot; tab, then enable sharing. </s>
<s> You may need to reboot the PC once you make the changes. </s>
<s> Bob, I finally solved this problem.! </s>
<s> I had to go into my network (click on the little house-windows 7) to the PC/media devices/&quot;media player&quot; and add the other drive and/or folders to the media player's &quot;library&quot;. </s>
<s> Seems so simple yet I thought all I had to do was &quot;share&quot; the drive/folders I wanted to see on my TV. </s>
<s> At least with my TV; it has to be in the PC's Media player library. </s>
<s> The files are not physically in the library; they are just indexed, so to speak:) </s>
