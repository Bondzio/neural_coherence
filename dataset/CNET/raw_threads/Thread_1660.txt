If needed run a restore on the computer(non-destructiive to prevent Data loss, to test the disk go ahead. if you would like burn it with the CD's included, it goes through fine on that. If you have Audio problems while playing a CD, go to start-&gt;control panel-&gt;swtch to classic view(left hand side of the screen)-&gt;system-&gt;hardware-&gt;device manager click on the plus sign next to IDE ata/atapi controller then right click on secondary IDE controller, then click on settings, and change it to DMA if available, this fixzes that problem If you are having trouble burning disks, right click on IDE ata/atapi controller, all three and then right click and select uninstall, if it asks to restart select no, if they do not disappear that is okay, once you have done that to all three, or more sometimes there are duplicates, restart the computer, it will load into windows, and go through the found new hardware, and then it will ask to restart again, and do that the computer will come up and everything should be fine now, if not call tech support and set up an order for a disk drive. This is what i do for my customers that is Get, and i am trained and qualified for eMachines tech support, as well as Gateway.

Dual-core maybe? How about laptops, when are they going sell them again? I'm just curious if you have any inside info. Thanks.

I am unable to burn a recovery DVD (eMachines tech support has agreed to send me one), but I also cannot burn anything else on the DVD drive. It plays DVD movies, but will not burn photos to disk. I do not understand the post that explains how to fix the the problem. Can you please explain in more detail? When I go to the Device Manager and click the plus sign next to IDE ATA/ATAPI CONTROLLERS, it lists: ATI IDE CONTROLLER PRIMARY IDE CHANNEL PRIMARY IDE CHANNEL PRIMARY IDE CHANNEL SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL STANDARD DUAL CHANNEL PCI IDE CONTROLLER STANDARD DUAL CHANNEL PCI IDE CONTROLLER Which ones am I supposed to uninstall? Thank you for your help!
