<s> I am wanting to use OpenDNS on my entire network w/o configuring all the computers. </s>
<s> The router I have is a D-Link WBR-1310. </s>
<s> It is currently using the 1.04 firmware upgrade. </s>
<s> Changing the DNS server does not work using this firmware. </s>
<s> But I saw somewhere that 1.02 will work. </s>
<s> It is not on the D-Link web site, and I was wondering if anyone had any clue where I could find the 1.02 firmware? </s>
<s> Or if there is another solution (other than configuring it on every machine) Thanks as alway. </s>
<s> You're right. </s>
<s> You can't even in 1.02. </s>
<s> But you can turn off the DHCP function in that router and have your own DHCP server to hand out the IP and more information. </s>
<s> I decline to write how here since that's in the TCPIP 101 course. </s>
