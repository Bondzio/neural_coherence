<s> Hello all, Just a thought. </s>
<s> I use a normal microphone headset with my laptop to communicate to my contacts via Yahoo. </s>
<s> This setup is pretty good apart from the fact that i cannot move around my home whilst using it. </s>
<s> I recently came up with the idea of connecting my bluetooth headset that i use with my mobile phone. </s>
<s> This would free me up from me desk and allow me to easily move around. </s>
<s> All went well with the connection, i.e. </s>
<s> pairing up the headset to my laptop, then nothing. </s>
<s> At this stage i cant use it. </s>
<s> I was wondering if it was indeed possible to use a bluetooth headset with a bluetooth enabled PC so that you can communicate. </s>
<s> Anyone had similar thoughts about this? </s>
<s> Any help would be most appreciated. </s>
<s> Regards...... </s>
<s> I have been trying the same experiment to get my BT Jabra200 headset to operate as headphones on my PC. </s>
<s> The PC recognises the bluetooth device (WindowsXP Pro SR2) but I can not get any communication established to use it on my VoIP program 'SKYPE' it will only communicate with my mobile phone. </s>
<s> If you, or anyone knows how to get this to work it would be a great breakthrough. </s>
<s> Regards, Bob. </s>
<s> Hey, Nah, no luck as yet. </s>
<s> Ive spoken to a few people regarding this and they think it would be easier just to get a normal headset. </s>
<s> That still doesnt solve the problem. </s>
<s> I want to be able to move around freely and without cables. </s>
<s> Try this: http://www.lordpercy.com/skype_headset_review.htm JoKer </s>
<s> Yes, I've paired it with my laptop using Widcomm Bluetooth driver. </s>
<s> Use it to listen to MP3 from my laptop. </s>
<s> However, note that headset battery will drain pretty fast if use continuously. </s>
<s> Quote &quot;I was wondering if it was indeed possible to use a bluetooth headset with a bluetooth enabled PC so that you can communicate.&quot; I think you may have to replace the bluetooth driver by one from Widcomm to handle this. </s>
<s> Read here:- http://www.geekzone.co.nz/forums.asp?ForumId=8&TopicId=2200 </s>
<s> I have had that idea as well. </s>
<s> I think the problem with using internally-built Bluetooth connection in the laptop is that the VOIP software (or in my case, my mapping program with voice prompts and voice command recognition) is looking for input/output from the microphone and speaker ports, not the Bluetooth port. </s>
<s> Jabra makes a Bluetooth adapter for non-Bluetooth phones that plugs into the handsfree mini jack on the phone. </s>
<s> I think some sort of adapter to split the phone connector into one input and one ouput that plugs into the laptop would provide the connectivity to Bluetooth headset you want. </s>
<s> Of course, right now that probably means a home-built signal splitter made from parts from the Radio Shack or other electronics store. </s>
<s> I have the Jabra Bluetooth adapter, I guess I will run down to Radio Shack and try to cobble up a splitter in the next few weeks (gone on vacation in the interim). </s>
<s> If you installed the Bluetooth support properly and ensured that the headset connects to the laptop, to make this work you need to tell the software (Skype, for example) to use &quot;Bluetooth Audio&quot; as the Audio In and Audio Out devices. </s>
<s> I use my Sony Ericsson Blueetoh headset with Skype: go to Options, then to Sound Devices; for Audio In I select &quot;Bluetooth Audio&quot;, and the same for Audio Out. </s>
<s> For Ringing I selected the laptop's sound card. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip, but I have tried that a few times and only get Windows Audio as well as SigmaTel Audio as choices. </s>
<s> Driver issue? </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Signed, Corded in Connecticut </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for all your tips and suggestions but I have tried them all and had no luck so far. </s>
<s> I have a Jabra BT200 which has been paired with my Desktop PC and recognised. </s>
<s> However, I can not get any Audio in or out. </s>
<s> The Bluetooth Radio Device setting does not recognise the Jabra BT200 - is this device not compatable with PAN (Personal Area Network) ? </s>
<s> My Skype audio settings only show my soundcard (SoundBlaster) and the Windows Default as the two only choices of i/o. </s>
<s> I have also tried to find that driver &quot;WidComm&quot; (or something) as a replacement driver for the Windows Bluetooth driver but I can only find discussion forums for it - Not the actual driver. </s>
<s> To conclude I am using WindowsXP Pro SP2, Skype and a Jabra BT200 headset but no way can I get these to talk to one another never mind to me and my contacts. </s>
<s> In the age of Blootooth technology, why is this proving to be such a problem. </s>
<s> there must be thousands of of users trying to get this VoIP link to work wirelessly. </s>
<s> All ideas welcome, please continue to research and help on this issue. </s>
<s> Hutchy. </s>

<s> the description on http://www.bluetoothpcheadsets.com/ worked perfectly when I installed a Sabre 250v headset thanks </s>
<s> I own a different Jabra headset but am looking for how to get it recognized by XP Pro SP2 as a telephony headset to use with Skype. </s>
<s> Now it's almost a year later and still no solution! </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> where can i get the bluetooth audio software. </s>
<s> it is not an option on my laptop. </s>
<s> I too have been struggling in the dark with Bluetooth. </s>
<s> The general idea about Bluetooth is that it is just a wireless wire, a connection just like a simple cable. </s>
<s> If two devices have bluetooth ''plugs'' then the magic bluetooth cable will connect them. </s>
<s> Not so it seems. </s>
<s> I have a Plantronics M3000 bluetooth handsfree which I bought for use with my mobile. </s>
<s> It works fine with the phone. </s>
<s> Like others I got a bluetooth USB adapter (A-link) for the laptop and it didn't work with the handsfree. </s>
<s> I tried a D-Link product and didn't work either much to the confusion of the in-store technical department guru. </s>
<s> After digging it appears that there are two protocols for these things: one is called Handsfree Protocol (HFP)the other Headset Protocol (HSP). </s>
<s> Some USB adapters only support HSP. </s>
<s> Hence the problem? </s>
<s> The Belkin F8T012/013 USB adapter ''should work with all headsets which support either or both the HSP (Headset) or HFP (Handsfree) bluetooth services'' according to their technical support staff. </s>
<s> Bluetooth versions are backwards compatible as you probably know so v.2.0 will work with v.1.1 and v.1.0. </s>
<s> Having said that, I have yet to get hold of the Belkin adapter. </s>
<s> They do not have a supplier in Nordic countries I am told by stores here in Finland, even though the Belkin web site says they do! </s>
<s> To make matters worse, hardly anyone seems to know of this protocol issue so it's very hard to find out what protocols are supported by any particular USB adapter. </s>
<s> The wondrous world of consumer electronics! </s>
<s> Does anyone else know anything about this? </s>
<s> i have tried to change the driver as you suggested, but there is no option for bluetooth audio in my drivers. </s>
<s> i have searched the net for one to download including microsofts site with no success. </s>
<s> where do i get this animal? </s>
<s> pat </s>
<s> i have read thur this. </s>
<s> in the installation it goes into a wizzard for bluetooth configuration. </s>
<s> i don't get and can't find this wizzard. </s>
<s> pat </s>
<s> if your laptop doesnt have bluetooth bulid-in then you need to get a Bluetooth USB adaptor to make your laptop Bluetooth enable. </s>
<s> the software will come with the USB adapter. </s>
<s> if your laptop has Bluetooth bulid-in, then the software should be already in your laptop. </s>
<s> i have a Bluetake stereo headphone and USB adapter. </s>
<s> i can listen to the music and also chat on my MSN. </s>
<s> it also work with my cell phone. </s>
<s> it will auto switch to pick up the phone calls if you are listen to the music. </s>
<s> I got a Bluetake BT400GL headset for my girlfriend. </s>
<s> it's very small and specially in PINK color. </s>
<s> =) it has 15 hours talking time, and a recharging dock. </s>
<s> also, it has vibration alert. </s>
<s> it's around $70 bucks their website is www.bluetakeusa.com </s>
<s> I have an IBM T60 with XP and which has the Widcom BT stack. </s>
<s> I bought a Cardo Scala 700 BT headset since it can pair with two devices (cell phone and computer). </s>
<s> Yahoo IM has a feature Actions&gt;Call Setup that allowed me to ensure the speaker and mike signals were re-directed from my computer to the BT headset. </s>
<s> Really cool but I want all audio to be transferred to my headset - and I cannot get it to work. </s>
<s> Found some excellent suggestions at http://www.bluetoothpcheadsets.com/audioproperties.htm but it did not make the connection. </s>
<s> Everyone is talking about this functionality - has no one got this to work? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I have a Motorola H300 headset, made specifically for phones. </s>
<s> I was having the same problems as you guys. </s>
<s> After having my headset identified by my laptop. </s>
<s> I went to quick connect and disabled the connection while my headset was still on. </s>
<s> Then I enable the connection through the quick connect and I got a sound from my headset like I was getting a call. </s>
<s> I answered through my headset and then the headset worked as both speaker and microphone. </s>
<s> Hope this helps =) </s>
<s> I have read through all suggested material, but I fear my problem is a bit more basic than most people here. </s>
<s> I have an Inspiron 9300 by Dell that I am trying to connect to a Motorola h300 BT headset for phones. </s>
<s> First things first, how do I put my laptop into &quot;search&quot; mode for the bluetooth? </s>
<s> I have a bluetooth light on my keyboard (that isn't lit) so I assume my laptop is already BT enabled, but I have no idea how to &quot;turn it on&quot; so that it can then seek my headset. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> I did the same thing. </s>
<s> I clicked on quick connect then disabled then enabled the bluetooth then my i heard my headset ringing so i pressed the answer button. </s>
<s> Then after that I just setup my yahoo messenger to use bluetooth instead of the system default. </s>
<s> Then it worked ! </s>
<s> my windows vista i have bluetooth transferring wizard can i use blue tooth headphone to talk on msn MESSANGER has any one done this .plz any help will be useful. </s>
<s> thankyou in advance. </s>
<s> i cant set up the bluetooth headset on my yahoo messenger but it works on my mobile phone and on my laptop when i use media player... i really wanted to use it on my yahoo messenger because i bought it for that purpose... thak you so much for listening! </s>
<s> where is quick connect in Windows vista? </s>
<s> If your system doesn't have a bluetooth antenna built in, no but the good news is, get a bluetooth adapter, USB input and you are in business. </s>
<s> Shop around, they are not that expensive. </s>
<s> How do you do the quick disconnect and connect in Windows XP. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> use following link to configure the same. </s>

<s> Just to let you know that all bluetooths were not designed the same. </s>
<s> The bluetooth headset that you use to talk on your phone isn't the same as a bluetooth stereo headset in which you can, listen music thru it. </s>
<s> From reading the previous posts no one mentions this fact. </s>
<s> So for example, if you were trying to use a non stereo headset for let's say gaming purposes, unless it is a stereo bluetooth you won't hear any audio on it. </s>
<s> To test this try listening to music from your phone with a non bluetooth stero headset, it won't work. </s>
<s> It can't stream the audio from it. </s>
<s> My suggestion would be to invest in a bluetooth headset that offers stereo on it. </s>
<s> You should then be able to use it on your computer(as long as it has bluetooth or bluetooth adapter) </s>

<s> I own an HP dv5 series laptop, and i called HP to solve the bluetooth issue we're discussing here, they told me that Wi-Fi and bluetooth use the same 2.4 Mhz range, and since wi-fi and bluetooth use the same input/output port, bluetooth in this devices are only to be used for quick and not broadband connections because wi-fi uses almost the 90% of the band width. </s>
<s> I believed them, so i connected via DSL and paired my sony bluetooth headset and the music remote control of the headset works pretty well with iTunes, but i still can't listen any audio. </s>
