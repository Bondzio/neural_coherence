1.1.1	Greetings, I'm looking for a solution, basically the requirement is to have a monitor of some sort, displaying basic info on the wall, that changes about once a day.	St
1.1.2	I.E.	St
1.1.3	0800 - Meeting in Conference Room 1000 - Video Teleconference 1130 - Some sort of activity 1300 - So on and so fourth This information would need to be easily editable and displayed on a monitor mounted on the wall.	St
1.1.4	I am trying to keep it from being attached to a stand alone computer if at all possible, however if that is the only way to do it then so be it.	St
1.1.5	What would be ideal is to have a connection on the monitor that you can either Serial Port, or IP address in and change what it displays on the fly, and have a weeks worth of data displayable in one form or another, possibly with controls on the front of the monitor to be able to flip days.	St
1.2.1	Smaller: digital picture frames Update with a flash memory card or even wireless.	St
1.2.2	Larger: information kiosk Can be expensive, but I have no idea what your budget is.	St
