graphics handling is one of the most resource consuming tasks for any computer.
that's why some companies put a lot of money into specialised graphics cards, money that the buyer has to reimburse.
previous generations of cpus could not handle demanding graphics as a task among others.
as monitor sizes grew and game designers took advantage of the technically possible the graphics part needed a gpu (graphics processing unit) and very fast memory.
that expensive stuff is not found on a motherboard.
what can be integrated on a mother board is a level below the highly sophisticated stuff.
i work a lot with photos and videos and i do not need the high speed of modern games.
so for me the integrated solution is fine.
the fact that 256 mb are taken away from 2 or 4 gb main memory does not make much of a difference.
modern computers have high speed buses and approach in their throughput the performance of some good (not top) dedicated graphics cards.
so the performance may be suitable for most people's needs.
if the future computer has 2 or (better) 4 gb of memory, if the front side bus has a speed of 800 mhz or better, if there is a fast 2 or 3 or 4 processor cpu provided and the graphics adapter can handle 1600x1200 pixels then the machine should be decent.
oh, by the way, if future games need even more power you can still buy a dedicated graphics card if the computer has an available pci express x16 slot.
the x16 stands for 16 times the normal pci speed and is usually available in one slot only.
with two graphics adapters a computer can run two screens what i do and enjoy a lot.
then again, you cannot be to pretty or to rich or have to much computing power.
