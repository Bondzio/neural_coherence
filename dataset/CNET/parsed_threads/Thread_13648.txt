<s> Hi, I just built my first computer and it actually works!! </s>
<s> The issue I'm having is there is no sound. </s>
<s> The motherboard I purchased has a sound jack, so I thought I didn't need a sound/audio card. </s>
<s> Do I need to add a sound card, install a driver from of the CDs that came with motherboard, other??? </s>
<s> And yes, I checked the volume level on both the monitor and computer. </s>
<s> Here's the link to the motherboard I bought. </s>

<s> What I find is many of the newer home PC builders are unaware of how Windows installations work. </s>
<s> That is, it's a very old system that rarely works on its own. </s>

<s> You do need to install drivers from that. </s>
<s> You didn't mention your OS but let's assume it's Windows. </s>
<s> Windows won't have all the needed drivers. </s>
<s> A trip to &quot;device manager&quot; will probably show you what hardware has been found but not configured. </s>
<s> Here's where you do this from the CD. </s>
<s> You start by installing the chipset drivers and then add the on board devices. </s>
<s> The CD might have an autorun feature to help guide you. </s>
<s> Sorry, I should have mentioned OS, it's Ubuntu 10.04. </s>
<s> I browsed the CD, I don't see a linux driver. </s>
<s> Not saying it's not there, I'm just looking for the file name that says LINUX in bold letters with lights flashing etc. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Also, without a working link or make and model number folk can't look for you. </s>

<s> 11.01 just recently came out and I loaded it on, but didn't care for it. </s>
<s> I'll eventually install it, but until I get my computer up and running like I want, I think I'll stick to an operating system I'm somewhat familiar with. </s>
<s> I'm very very new to Linux. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what happened to the link. </s>
<s> Here's the make and model and I posted the link again. </s>
<s> GIGABYTE GA-P67A-D3-B3 LGA 1155 Intel P67 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128487 </s>
<s> http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3800#dl does not list a single Linux driver. </s>
<s> Time to ask for these in the Ubuntu forums. </s>
<s> About 11.01. </s>
<s> I see 11.10 at the Ubuntu site. </s>
<s> Since you can run that LIVE without installing you should be able to test the sound there. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob! </s>
