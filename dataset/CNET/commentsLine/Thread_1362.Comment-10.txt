manfacturers' estimates of life expectancy are educated guesses.
and, of course, heat is the enemy of electronics.
i have a ''hot'' new system: pentium d 3.2ghz, 2 gb of ram, 3 hds and a heater called a graphics card.
although my lian li alum case has 4 fans, i still get heat warnings from pc probe ii software and wired temperature probes (thermaltake hardcano 13).
two of my hds are western digital sata raptors.
these fast 10,000 rpm drives are noisy and generate more heat than standard 7200 rpm drives.
but, hey, i love the speed of the raptors.
the solution to hd heat and noise?
''smartdrive 2002'' enclosures (  ).
these hd enclosures are copper lined (copper conducts heat better than plastic, alum, steel) and fit into a 5.25 drive slot (visible on front of case like an optical drive).
air slots around the smartdrive 2002 enclosure helps remove the heat conducted by the hd.
not cheap, but an essential part of a quality system.
