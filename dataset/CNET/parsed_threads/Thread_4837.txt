<s> I am going to network a laptop with XP Home and a desktop with XP Pro (through a router). </s>
<s> I plan to buy an external hard drive (probably Western Digital Passport) to be the central place where all the files are for both machines to access. </s>
<s> I also want the laptop and hard drive to be mobile so I can take it out of the office and still access and use my files. </s>
<s> What I'm trying to figure out is if my laptop with XP Home (which doesn't have encryption capabilities) will be able to open/view/edit a file from my external drive that does have encryption. </s>
<s> Also, am I right to assume I can network XP Home through a router? </s>
<s> You didn't tell so all I can tell you is there is no hardware issue here. </s>

<s> What info do you need? </s>
<s> The encryption is on the Western Digital external hard drive and it's WD Sync with AES. </s>
<s> That's all I can find out. </s>
<s> I do know there are BIG ISSUES why Windows own encryption would fail. </s>
<s> Best of luck but in parting there is no known HARDWARE issue here. </s>
