thanks, i kinda expected to hear that.
i recently d/loaded a new driver for vista 32 from the guru of 3d site.
it does allow a few of the progs to work but not all.
particularly the one i wanted most, the player/recorder.
it has the record &quot;what-u-hear&quot; setting, and is pretty useful... it does show, but with no recording abilities.
i have it installed on my xp machine, and it runs well.
thanks...
