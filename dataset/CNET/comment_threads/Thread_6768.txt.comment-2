Let's clear one thing, you can't run RAID using one physical HD, you have a partitoned HD that acts as if two.
In other words you need two real HDs in order to run RAID of even sizes.
Next, I suggest you use either Partition Magic or any other so-called partitioning s/w in order to combine the partitions, either buy or use shareware s/w.
However, the old fashion way is to delete all on the partitions using the s/w the HD maker provides, usually free.
Goto the support website of the HD maker and get the diags or s/w that's available.
Running such s/w is destructive to data, so save what you need or simply proceed once ready.
When asked, combine or accept the HD as one large HD, non-partitioned.
