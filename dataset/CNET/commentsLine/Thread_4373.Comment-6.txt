ignore the message about the emachines, if your capable of building a system yourself, stay on that path, even if your not, stay away from emachnes.

there is a danger that during the winxp setup, you format and install to the wrong drive, and/or, windows picks up the data drive as c: and you have no clue how to fix it.

as a rule of thumb, on regular ol' ide channels, better to have your primary windows drive on it's own channel by itself if possible.
if not make it the master on the primary channel, meaning is jumpered to master or cable select, and connected to the ide connector at the end of the cable, not the one in the middle.
