hello, i am having problems getting my computer to recognize my digital camera all of a sudden - it worked just fine a few weeks ago.
when i plug my usb mouse into both usb ports, it works fine.
but when i try the same thing with my camera.
.
and palm pilot, i don't get a response when i try to synchronize.
the strange thing is my computer does make a .wav sound when i try to sync the palm, it just never makes a connection.
but it does recognize it.
i don't have any conflicts in my hardware manager and i haven't installed anything new other than the windows xp updates.
some background my my system, i'm running windows xp on a dell dimension desktop - 600 meg, 128 megs of ram.
any help you can provide is greatly appreciated!
