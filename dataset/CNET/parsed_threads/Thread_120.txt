<s> I'm certainly no sound expert, but I've used many different speakers over the years. </s>

<s> I have an older pair of NEC desktop speakers that I've used for the past 4 or 5 years. </s>
<s> When playing music, none of the others, that I have experienced, seem to sound as good. </s>
<s> They are approximately twice as large as most newer models. </s>

<s> Thanks for your comments, Stan! </s>
