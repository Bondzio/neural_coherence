i found a bunch of stuff on how to install the drivers.
it looks pretty complicated though.
not stuff i'm familiar with.
i'm going to give it a try in a few days.
it's a pain in the butt having to pull my graphics card out each time i want to boot ubuntu.
otherwise the system hangs up on boot.
i'm a single dad with 2 toddlers and my littlest one was diagnosed with pnuemonia today so i'm gonna just spend time with him and come back to it when he's healthy.
thank you.
sincerely, steve
