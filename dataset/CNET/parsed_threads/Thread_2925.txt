<s> Dear all, I have a problem when copying files from my laptop to DVD+RW. </s>
<s> There are files inside my DVD+RW, so whenever I want to copy or add more files into the DVD+RW, it always ask me to erase all the files inside the DVD+RW before copying or adding files. </s>
<s> Hence, every time I want to copy or add files into the DVD+RW, I have to copy the files inside the DVD+RW to my laptop and then recopy those files from my laptop back to the DVD+RW together with some new added files. </s>
<s> I believe that DVD+RW shouldn't work this way but I really don't know how to solve this problem. </s>
<s> Can anyone help.....? </s>

<s> &quot;Hence, every time I want to copy or add files into the DVD+RW, I have to copy the files inside the DVD+RW to my laptop and then recopy those files from my laptop back to the DVD+RW together with some new added files.&quot; That's the safest way to keep your files intact. </s>
<s> While InCD and other software will allow use of RW media as a disk drive the stories you read here when it burbs and they want to know how to recover the files are legendary. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> When I do my backups to DVD-RW I do the quick erase first, then copy files. </s>
<s> On the other hand, if the disk is not full, it should add the files. </s>
<s> Not closing the disk will enable this. </s>
<s> If you close the session then you need to erase the disk first. </s>
<s> Hi Coryphaeus, FYI, I know that closing the DVD will not allow me to write my files into the DVD. </s>
<s> So, I did not even close it but why I can't write my files into the DVD ever there are more than 50% of the space? </s>
<s> I believe that DVD+RW works like a floopy disk. </s>
<s> Hence, can anyone tell me what should I do? </s>
<s> &quot;why I can't write my files into the DVD ever there are more than 50% of the space?&quot; The answer to this is &quot;how things work.&quot; Have you researched or do you know how file systems and then &quot;packet writing&quot; works? </s>
<s> If not you may not be ready for the technical answers. </s>
<s> But let it suffice there are limitations to multisession CD/DVDRW use. </s>
<s> Is that good enough? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Dear Bob, Thank you for your reply. </s>
<s> I believe that my problem is not a matter whether my technical knowledge is up to a standard. </s>
<s> I believe that copying of data into DVD+RW is a simple thing, just like copying data into diskette. </s>
<s> Hence, if you could guide me the steps of copying the data, that will be great. </s>
<s> FYI, I did format my DVD+RW before the 1st usage. </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether formating will affect my DVD. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Two questions. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> What's your OS (Windows Vista or Windows XP)? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> What burning program do you use, and how? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Hi Kees, My OS is Win XP Service Pack 2, Home Edition. </s>
<s> The Burning program is Sonic. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> &quot;I believe that copying of data into DVD+RW is a simple thing, just like copying data into diskette.&quot; That is not true. </s>
<s> There are deeper issues here and limitations in the packet writing systems. </s>
<s> I can't duplicate how it works here but in a nutshell multisession does have limitations and is not exactly like a diskette. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, If it is true as what you mentioned that DVD+RW have limitations and is not exactly like a diskette. </s>
<s> In the first place, why DVD+RW is created? </s>
<s> How come it is not user-friendly? </s>
<s> DOS was considered user friendly just a few decades ago. </s>
<s> Some may not consider this an answer but if we add on that there is NO STANDARD in packet writing and the makers competed (campaigned?) </s>
<s> for theirs to be &quot;it&quot; you might begin to understand how we got here. </s>
<s> -&gt; There it is. </s>
<s> You would not only want to research how packet writing works but how we got here and the battles/skirmishes along the way. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> many many times. </s>
<s> We can also use it just like a floppy but what we are trying to tell you is that it is NOT as reliable when use in such method. </s>
<s> Sigh.... </s>
<s> So many ding dong here and there. </s>
<s> So, what is the simple solution to write data to DVD+RW without erasing the exsiting data in the disc? </s>
<s> Might be solved by changing which packet writing software you are using. </s>
<s> But then again the lessons learned here show it's not reliable enough. </s>
<s> What I find is most won't agree until it happens to them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Nero call its program Incd. </s>
