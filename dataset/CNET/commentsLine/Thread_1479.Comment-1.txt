i have a basic configuration question on the t6212 that im hoping you can help me with.
i have a limited budget to work under, so the cost of the t6212 appeals to me.
also, my kids gave me $100 in best buy gift cards for christmas, so between being able to apply those to the package and having 0 percent financing for 12 months, best buy is where i will purchase whatever system i end up getting.
i would be using the pc mainly for: internet surfing and downloads; email; cd/dvd ripping and burning; digital photo work/editing; and perhaps down the road attempting to put some old vhs footage on dvd.
i dont really do any gaming, though i might be inclined to try a bit with a new system, but it certainly wouldnt be heavy duty in the least.
so here (yes, finally) is my question: is the configuration of the t6212, as it is sold out of the box, adequate for what i will use if forat least for the time being?
i dont have any problem with upgrading as my needs grow, but is that necessary right now?
when i do upgrade, any suggestions on priority, with regard to memory, video/graphics and audio?
also, any ballpark costs on doing those things?
again, i dont have a lot of $$$ to spend, but i want a solid system that will meet those needs i listed.
any help is greatly appreciated.
thank you.
