1.1.1	I have some older at and atx systems .	St
1.1.2	Two I am stumped about what is going on .	St
1.1.3	One just beeps and does not activate the screen or does not spin the disks .	St
1.1.4	just beeps .	St
1.1.5	The other one does the same thing , but plays a musical tune repeatedly .	St
1.1.6	Help !	St
1.1.7	David	St
1.2.1	Given the amount of information to work with , I ca n't help but tell you the systems need repair .	St
1.2.2	What repair is not known since ... there is no story in your post .	St
1.2.3	Not only about your machines , but your background .	St
1.2.4	You could start taking PC Repair courses , read a few books on PC repair and hang out , get a job at a small PC shop to gain the knowledge .	Sug
1.2.5	As it stands , the machines chould be missing RAM ( common ) or just burnt out .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	those beeps are commonly caused by ( and lets hope it 's caused by ) one of the following problems : *one of your Mobos various connectors is loose/dicsonnected ( ie : usb header , pci card , etc . )	St
1.3.2	just check all of your connections and push in anything that looks loose ( use your mobo manual to make sure you 've covered all of the connections ) *your CMOS button cell battery ( on the MOBO ) is dead/fallen out and needs replacing .	Sug
1.3.3	check your mobo manual for specifically what kind of battery you need .	Sug
1.3.4	find some one who sells that battery , buy it and pop it in .	St
1.3.5	more severe/pricy-to-fix problems include : *you HDD is shot , you need a new one .	St
1.3.6	it is still possible to recover the lost files using various methods described by various internet sites .	St
1.3.7	*your power supply in inadequate/broken and needs replacing .	St
1.3.8	NOTE : if you shut off/unplug your power supply to check internal connections , wait about 30 seconds after turing the power supply back on before you boot up to allow the mobo to rcharge or you will get that same beeping .	Sug
1.3.9	When you restart your comp after a beeping fit , you may get a CPU speed error message .	St
1.3.10	this is usually caused by the cpu trying to start but it did n't have enough power .	St
1.3.11	that error message will let you know with more ( but still not complete ) certainty that your power supply is failing .	St
1.3.12	good luck , and if you have more questions i 'll check up on this thread occasionally for a couple days	Polite
1.4.1	Virus or Motherboard Itself ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.2	http : //www.europe.f-secure.com/v-descs/fur_elis.shtml The beeps you get will depend on the hardware that 's failing .	St
1.4.3	Three beeps usually is a video card ... ..one long continuous beep usually is a RAM problem .	St
1.4.4	TONI	St
1.5.1	Thanks to everyone for replying .	St
1.5.2	I will apply the suggestions you have offered .	St
1.5.3	A little about me .	St
1.5.4	I am a therapist who recently got a donated computer given to me , with a box of parts , and a motherboard .	St
1.5.5	I asked for a case , and ended up with a lot of older computers ( 166 win 95 type of machines ) I decided to start to rehab them for children and needy families .	St
1.5.6	I started PapabearCares http : //www.kellin.org/papabearcareshome.html .	St
1.5.7	I am learning as I go , and am learning to ask questions .	St
1.5.8	Luckly , I have a number of spare parts now so if a component is bad , I can replace it .	St
1.5.9	One day I will probably get into the classroom for more formal training .	St
1.5.10	Thanks again for your help .	St
