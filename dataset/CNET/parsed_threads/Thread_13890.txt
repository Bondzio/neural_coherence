<s> my 4-5 year old build's power supply finally crapped out last week, and i have replaced with a corsair tx650. </s>
<s> Receive new PSU, plug it all in, power up and everything seems fine. </s>
<s> The LEDs on the mouse and keyboard turned on with the computer, so i assume everythings perfect. </s>
<s> However i get no response from either mouse or keyboard when trying to log in/access BIOS. </s>
<s> I switch USB ports, with no success. </s>
<s> Infact, the LEDs on mouse+keyboard would only be on if you boot the computer up with them plugged into the USB port. </s>
<s> If i try to switch ports when the computer's on, the LEDs will go off and stay off, but they would flash on briefly when i pull them out of the ports after the first swap. </s>
<s> Very weird. </s>
<s> I figure worst case scenario i scoop a ps2 mouse/keyboard but i certainly dont want to if i dont have to. </s>
<s> ayudame! </s>
<s> But try the rear USB ports and then consider that when a PSU fails it can fry things on the way out. </s>
<s> Be sure to test that keyboard and mouse on another PC as well as consider the old issue of extra mounting studs we find all the time in home built machines. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As Bob Proffitt said, trying units on another system is one check to do. </s>
<s> I'd get my hands on a Ps-2 mouse to make further checks, specifically device manager to see what is going on with USB function, errors update(s) etc. </s>
<s> since it is possible that it could me a device (hardware) failure. </s>
<s> If that should be the case get a PCI slot USB card and stuff that in the system, that might just remedy the situation. </s>
