1.1.1	Hello , I recently upgraded my Dell Dimension 2350 to Windows Vista Ultimate .	St
1.1.2	Unfortunately , the Intel integrated graphics ( 82845 G\GL\GV ) is only recognized as & quot ; standard VGA graphics & quot ; which only allows the monitor to run at 800x600 resolution .	St
1.1.3	I 've looked for an updated driver without success .	St
1.1.4	Anybody know where I could find one or know any other tricks to fix this problem ?	Ques
