Ever since I've added in another 512ram to my comp to get it up to 1gb, my comp begin to load applications and games slower. Even when I have winamp and mozilla firefox running at the same time, my comp would lag intensely; as before i added the ram, this woulnd't happen. Anyone know why? Or could it be something else other than the ram? My comp specs: -Asus a7v8x-x motherboard -AMD Athlon 2600 processor -1GB Ram -ATI X1600 512MB vid card -Western Digit 120gb HD

My daughter's PC had the same MB....it developed BAD CAPS...not saying that's what wrong with yours or causing the slowdown but do take a close look for bulging and or leaking capacitors surrounding the CPU socket. Let us know what you find. VAPCMD

Could missing/changed registry on my windows cause this? since i've been having quite some spyware and trojans hits? You think repairing my windows would help?

Then, you get to reinstall XP, all the proper drivers, and everything else...except Limewire and other P2P file sharing programs.
