1.2.1	Not worth it , get emachines t6212 .	St
1.2.2	this does n't have a pci-express slot .	St
1.2.3	You can get the same performance for half the price .	St
1.2.4	do n't get fooled by ddr2 , its not faster , amd 's with its integrated memory controller still beats it .	St
1.3.1	I 'd pay the extra ( which should be discounted anyway ) for XP Pro , Home has petty annoyances , I found .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for your input .	St
1.4.2	I will look into the emachine .	St
1.4.3	I did do some brief research awhile back on this machine and I kind of remember it getting a somewhat average review .	St
1.4.4	I will look further into it .	St
