I can go to any other page and I can go to an ebay listing that I have saved in my favorites, but I can't go to ebay.com. I am the only one that uses this computer and I know I didnt block it. What could be going on??

Besides the five scans I note in the Anti-Parasite Suite at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 the HijackThis LOG could be posted in a new thread here or over in the Security Forum for others to dissect if you don't find it.
