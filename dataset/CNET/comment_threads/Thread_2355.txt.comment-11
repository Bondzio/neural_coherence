Then you need to refer to what information can be gotten using some s/w analyzer, like PCWizard 2012.
Irt will report what you really have and then use that to google for your needs.
The report should state what mtrbd.
you have, like Brand XYZ-123-a, google away for the manual and thus review what your specs are.
The information is more than anything else, real hard facts about your build.
