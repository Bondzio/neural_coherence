thank you for the quick response.
does your laptop have a hdmi connection or is there a cable that runs between vga and hdmi?
my vga signal is not recognized by the tv.
i have a request for information out there to toshiba -- i'm using a vga cable (15 pin, male both ends, to connect the two).
so far no response.
the printer is not something i do not want to replace, got a great deal on it and it is more heavy duty (small business vs home use).
i'd rather move all equipment back if i could find an alternate way to stream movies (more important to my husband than me-- i need the office capability).
i'm taking a serious look at the dell you sent the link for, thanks again.
