1.1.1	I 'm runing XP home SP2.I have all windows updates installed .	St
1.1.2	AVG virus scan , MSAS , Ad-Aware SE and Spywareblaster installed .	St
1.1.3	All find nothing in a scan.My problem is the computer will just radomly reboot itself.Sometimes it reboots fine and other 's it gets & quot ; stuck & quot ; in a constant reboot cycle .	St
1.1.4	So in one of it 's reboots , I hit F8 and boot up in safe mode.So far that has worked every time .	St
1.1.5	I then shut down and reboot again and the computer boots up and works fine again for awhile.Sometimes for a day somtimes for a week .	St
1.1.6	So far I have not been able to find out why ?	Ques
1.1.7	Do n't know if it is a well hidin & quot ; bug & quot ; or a hardware problem ?	Ques
1.1.8	Any idea 's ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thank 's Rick	St

1.3.1	Type BAD CAPS into google.com and look at the pictures , then check your motherboard .	St
1.3.2	Also an overtaxed power supply does this .	St
1.3.3	Why no detail about your PC ?	Ques
1.3.4	Did you see those words in RED ?	Ques

1.5.1	& quot ; That 's not good. & quot ;	St
1.6.1	But my money is as the previous poster said , this is most likely due to an overtaxed power supply .	St
1.6.2	If you 've added any new hardware to your system , this may explain it .	St
1.6.3	Also - you may have a dusty power supply and it 's overheating as a result .	St
1.6.4	Try a can of compressed air to blow out the dust from inside the power supply .	St
1.6.5	Of course , you 'll have to do this from the inside of the case .	St
1.6.6	So be sure to turn off the power supply or unplug it from the wall .	St
1.6.7	Then hit the start button on the computer to discharge any residual power .	St
1.6.8	Then ground yourself BEFORE you remove that side panel .	St
1.6.9	Otherwise you may short out that computer .	St
1.6.10	Then you 'll be left with an expensive paperweight .	St
1.7.1	I had a very bad experience with an overheating or intermittent router that would cause my 5 computers connected by lan or wan to crash and or reboot depending on how I had the windows error cofiguration set .	St
1.7.2	To modify this setting : right click on the My Computer Icon , select properties , click on advanced , select startup and recovery , deselect automatic restart .	St
1.7.3	This will at least let you look at the blue screen and see what kind of error caused your restart .	Sug
1.7.4	The error I was getting with the bad router was Driver Fault , HTTP.sys , page fault in nonpaged area .	St
1.7.5	Lots of luck .	Polite
1.7.6	Mike	St
1.8.1	I will try that..	Sug
1.8.2	When it go 's into it 's reboot cycle , I get a quick BSOD , but can not see what it says ... ... Rick	St
