Which case should I buy?
There is the Praetorian 730 and the Antec P180.
I have researched both and they both seem like good choices.
I have recently found the Antec P180 at Provantage for under $130 with shipping, while NewEgg offers it for $157.72 with shipping, a rather large price difference for this case.
The Praetorian 730, no matter where one looks for it, is still $160+ with shipping.
Here are the two cases, both very attractive in my opinion.
