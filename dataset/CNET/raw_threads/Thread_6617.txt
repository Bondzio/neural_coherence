Most of us are here for several days consecutively and using work computers for such business is forbidden. My question is, will installing a cable splitter, new modem and a WAP successfully isolate our server from virus dangers? I plan on installing the splitter at the wall where the cable comes into the building, before the modem that's conected to our server. -Thanks

The employee would catch some pest and when they connect to the work network pass it on to the rest of the crew. It's not that safe to give then such access unless you lock it down to &quot;approved&quot; sites and block email access. Bob

Maybe someone else could tell you that, but I don't think you can just split the line and put two modems on it. And even if it were, if your work is so worried about you using company resources for personal use, I seriously doubt they would be very understanding of you leaching bandwidth off a company cable connection reguardless of the security issues involvoed.
