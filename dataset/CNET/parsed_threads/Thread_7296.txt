<s> A few days ago I posted about the malfunction of both my cdr and dvd drives. </s>
<s> It turned out to be a problem in the registry caused by Adaptec Easy Cd Creator. </s>
<s> I found the solution (thanks again Bob) and then both drives worked fine- until I installed the update to the Adaptec program so it would recognize my cdr again. </s>
<s> Okay, so now the cdr works, but the DVD doesn't. </s>
<s> I'm not even getting an error code- the DVD drive doesn't show at all in Hardware Manager. </s>
<s> I tried the Hardware Install Wizard- nothing. </s>
<s> I tried the same regedit that worked before- nothing. </s>
<s> I just watched a movie on the thing, I'm pretty sure its not broken. </s>
<s> It is a one year old Sony. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> That's a possible clue. </s>
<s> I haven't put ANY Adaptec software in machines for about 5 years. </s>
<s> Tell more and if the DVD shows up in the BIOS. </s>

<s> Musta been Gremlins. </s>
<s> I did nothing to the pc except turn it off for the night...I just turned it on for the first time and the DVD player is working despite being identified as a cd drive in My Computer. </s>
<s> THe misbehavior of the dvd drive persisted through many reboots, maybe it just needed a goodnights rest. </s>
<s> I wish everything would fix itself. </s>
<s> Bob- you mentioned that Adaptect software may be a problem. </s>
<s> I know you can't advertise here, but is there a program you would recommend? </s>
<s> There are a few noteable free CD recording freebies out there. </s>
<s> Today I use http://www.cdburnerxp.se and it's very usable without being locked to the CDRW make/model. </s>
<s> Nero is nice too. </s>
<s> On Linux, it's K3b. </s>
