<s> I work from home taking inbound calls for a satellite TV provider and we are now transitioning to a different type of system and there are new pc requirements that my current pc no longer meets. </s>
<s> can someone please give me a good suggestion on what make and model desktop or laptop I can get that meets these requirements, P.S I'm looking for the absolute cheapest option and I live I Oklahoma city, ok I am willing to buy online and would appreciate any suggestions on legitimate financing options &#8226; </s>
<s> My son got this Asus K55N DS81 that was all of 380 bucks and appears to exceed those requirements. </s>
<s> Was there some other requirement that something like this won't do? </s>

<s> im not adverse to a laptop i will take whatever is cheapest. </s>
<s> i lokked @ the suggestion you made but the processor on it is 1.9ghz and i need 3.0ghz processer speed i have been looking on qvc and hsn because they have flex pay options and i am not trying to spend a small fortune all at one time being as though this was unexpected but it seems that the only ones that meet those spec are $800 and up. </s>
<s> i would appreciateay other infoyou can find. </s>
<s> There are thousands of web pages that detail how CPUs have advanced and how this 1.9GHz is far faster than the P4 GHz. </s>
<s> I fear that you need to talk to folk in the stores about this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I suspect you could go to Wally-mart or the like and get the cheapest desktop on the shelf and it would exceed the specs you listed. </s>
<s> 350/450 buck range. </s>
<s> Just an example and not a recco. </s>
