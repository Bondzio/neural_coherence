It has an ethernet cable and power supply cord. I has a 4-port switch. What I have is a computer with DSL, and a box/modem with the first plugin for DSL, 2nd, usb, 3rd, ethernet, and 4th power. The ethernet is plugged into the back of the tower. I am wondering how to hook up the Linksys(where to plug it in)and also, it doesn't have a little antenna which I though all of these did. I don't see anyplace where one might have been either? Any help is appreciated. I have Windows Vista SP2 and can give you further info if needed. I want to be able to pick up the DSL signal from my laptop;) Denise

The internet &quot;light&quot; is not coming on and when I try my browser it is not connected. Can anyone tell me what I might try to fix this? The lights are on on the router so it appears to be functioning properly. I think these instructions, http://www.tech-faq.com/how-to-setup-a-linksys-router.html are correct but I can't get to the &quot;configure&quot; part where you go to the IP address online. Can I configure that before I hook up the router maybe? Thanks again for any help, Denise
