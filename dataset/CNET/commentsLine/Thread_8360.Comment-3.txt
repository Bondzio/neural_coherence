if its that old, then your use of win8 or ubuntu has &quot;orphan&quot; it.
you need to move on as you already found out one way or another its no longer supported or its out of your grasp.
this is not uncommon for any new os that gets released and since this is before xp, well that's a long run.
at least i don't see any fix for you, unless you click on win8 &quot;update driver&quot; and allow it to go online and see if it resolves it that way.
