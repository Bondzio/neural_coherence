<s> just set up a typical 2-PC home network (a desktop & a laptop).... both PCs running VISTA printer is local to desktop & shared successfully found & added the shared printer on the laptop system problem: when sending a single test document from the laptop, the print queue (which started w/ zero documents) now shows a count of 2 documents, but only the job i sent is listed in the pending documents; and that job never prints on the desktop side, no pending documents are listed; however, when I print from the desktop, the job shows up briefly on the laptop queue (as it should) if I cancel the test document on the laptop, a count of 1 still remains on the print queue, but no documents are in the list what am i missing?? </s>
<s> BIG THANKS TO ANYONE THAT CAN HELP </s>
<s> MSFT (see google) tends to call these issues COSMETIC as the system works but does what you wrote about. </s>
<s> Since it works, the printer prints they may leave such a bug unfixed. </s>
<s> This can upset those that have no history with MSFT. </s>
<s> Ok, one idea. </s>
<s> MANUALLY clear the print queue. </s>
<s> Here's a google on that. </s>
<s> But my thought is if it is printing, why fix this? </s>

<s> Hi, Bob. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I did clear the queue (cancel the document) manually. </s>
<s> Upon doing so I noted that the printer status window still showed that there was &quot;1&quot; document, although none listed in the queue. </s>
<s> It appears to me that the OS is creating something that is put &quot;first in line&quot; before my document Ultimately, MY document never printed from the laptop. </s>
<s> (no problems printing from the desktop) I hope my attempt at this clarification is helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Uninstall the printer entirely and make a new instance. </s>
<s> Again, a MSFT issue. </s>
<s> They really need to make this stuff better. </s>
