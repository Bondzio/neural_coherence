1.1.1	Hi There i have a 400GB WD external HDD that has failed to respond of copy files from it .	St
1.1.2	I have tried to retrieve some data from it but most of it still sits there .	St
1.1.3	I have been given a replacement drive from WD but i need to recover the files before the drive is sent back .	St
1.1.4	The drive is behaving strangely , sometimes it says that it has an I/O drive error and can not open particular files but i can see the files in there .	St
1.1.5	Most of the bulk is digital pictures ( 30-50GB ) and rest being pdf and MS office related files .	St
1.1.6	i did try chkdsk feature but it kept telling me that the files are unreadable ( I/O error ) .	St
1.1.7	However , I have copied some pictures a meager fraction that i was able to move successfully but it took ages to do so .	St
1.1.8	Can some one really suggest something intuitively that may prevent me from spending too much money to get the piece of junk workable .	St
1.1.9	ALSO WHEN I CONNECT THE DRIVE IT KEEPS ON SPINNING AND DOES NOT STOP AND I HAVE A HARD TIME EJECTING IT TOO .	St
1.1.10	ANY COMMENTS WOULD BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED .	St
1.1.11	Thx MI	St
1.2.1	If you have n't already use a rear USB port .	St
1.2.2	Since , a replacement HD is present , open the HD ext .	St
1.2.3	case and reseat the connections found inside several times and retry again to access it .	St
1.2.4	Check results , if OK , retrieve data ASAP .	St
1.2.5	If not , then the HD is going south and no amount of fiddling will do .	St
1.2.6	Since , you have success in whatever method to retrieve some data , repeat until done or at least until it really fails .	St
1.2.7	You could also swap HDs with the replacement ext .	St
1.2.8	case itself and if its a power issue .	St
1.2.9	If nothing works , then google for data recovery s/w either free or paid for .	St
1.2.10	if the data is that important , stop now and allow a recovery service to retrieve it .	St
1.2.11	You could also , mount the ext .	St
1.2.12	HD , removed from ext .	St
1.2.13	case and mount int .	St
1.2.14	to PC and check results , Again , if none of this helps or seems to get worse , data recovery service .	St
1.2.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	are there any softwares that could help fix this issue ?	Ques
1.4.1	and it looks like that , software wo n't help .	St
1.4.2	Only an ( expensive ) data-recovery company can get your data off then .	St
1.4.3	Did nobody ever tell you that you should n't store data on an external hard disk ?	Ques
1.4.4	It 's useful to transport data between different PC 's that are n't in a network , and it 's useful as a quick backup .	St
1.4.5	But surely not as primary and only storage of data .	St
1.4.6	Much too unreliable for that .	St
1.4.7	Kees	St
1.5.1	I have yet to get a 100 % or reliable recovery rate with any s/w .	St
1.5.2	No amount of playing gets it all done , though some files may have been recovered it seems its never the one critial one the user needs .	St
1.5.3	Below is a google webpage : http : //www.google.com/search ? rlz=1C1_____enUS373US374 & aq=f & sourceid=chrome & ie=UTF-8 & q=data+recovery+s/w http : //www.pctools.com/file-recover/download/ ? ref=google_fr & gclid=CM2aw9y-w6QCFSExiQod8Ai2kQ Robert , usually has a small listing he always posts , but I have no direct CNET link to it .	St
1.5.4	I suggest you search here on forum for it , as data recovery is a hot topic too often associated with ext .	St
1.5.5	HDs .	St
1.5.6	The lesson here is also store data on CD/DVD discs as well for critial data as yet another storage source .	St
1.5.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
