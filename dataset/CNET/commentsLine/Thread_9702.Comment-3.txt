this is something you, me and few others may understand but most people like the idea of &quot;one-button recovery with no-disks-to-lose solution&quot; and probably dont consider the cons.
i initially gave them the idea of a single dvd-rom based recovery solution and i think i'll press on with it.
so whats your advice on this one?
?
