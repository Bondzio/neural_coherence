The price difference does not concern me. I am by no means an audiophile, and I'm pretty sure that the difference in satellite sound will not concern me. What I am most concerned about is the subwoofer. I primarily listen to rock music, but I do enjoy a little bit of everything. I know that the Klipsch sub is able to hit lower notes, but does this actually mean anything? Can anyone recommend one sub over the other? This system will travel back and forth with me to school, so durability and portability are also a bit of a concern, but I don't expect the speakers to be banged up. Also any comments about any aspect of each product is really appreciated. None of the stores around me carry either of these products to listen to, and I'd have to drive about a half hour to pick up the Klipsch...the z2300 is closer. I'm having a really hard time deciding, so any and all input is greatly appreciated!

I haven't listened to the Klipsch, but I've never been a fan of the brand - too much sizzle comin' out of their horn-loaded tweeters... but some people like that... :? I have the Z-2300s, and I like them a lot. For computer speakers, they're great- they even have a semblance of a sound-stage! I don't think that you'll have to worry about low-end output - If you're going back and forth to school, I'm assuming that you're not going to be putting them in a very large room - you should easily be able to reach adequate sound pressure levels- as always, take a little care with the placement of the sub. Oh, on the portability side of things... they're not very... the set probably weighs 40 lbs+. Oh, and to directly address your question about the real-world difference in frequency response range of the two subs - the cnet review said that there was some distortion... I would take the sub with less distortion any day, even if it doesn't go as low. A good sub, that's setup well, will blend in with the main channels - if you close your eyes, you shouldn't be able to tell where it is, bass frequencies are omnidirectional. Distortion kills that illusion. That, and the fact that you probably wont miss that frequency range anyway (unless you listen to pipe organs!), would make me lean towards the z-2300s

Not-so-nutshell - if you have enough cable, place the sub where you would normally listen. Play something with at least somewhat musical bass. Walk around near the front of the room slowly, listening to the changes in the quality of the bass - bass frequencies/waves are long, as such very dependant on room shape, size and location within that space- it'll sound different at point A than it will at point B, even if they're only a foot apart. So, on your walkabout, you'll find a place where it sounds best - good oomph, but not too bloated and boomy - that's where you want to put the sub. Again, pay particular attention to the areas to the front of the room, near a corner or wall, but never up against one. Also, never put a sub at the halfway point between opposite walls - the waves will reflect and tend cancel each other out. After you get the sub placed, fiddle with the sub volume 'til it matches what's coming out of the L&R speakers (the z-2300 has a bass volume knob in addition to the master volume on the wired control). If you REALLY want to get the most out of them (hehhehheh) go to RadioShack and get a $30 Sound Pressure Level (SPL) meter and a test disc and balance along the frequency range to your heart's content!

If you're going to listen more from the edge of your bed, put it there, etc.
