1.1.1	I have 2 monitors and 2 computers .	St
1.1.2	For this question , here 's my coding for the arrangement : Monitor-A , Computer-A , Monitor-B , Computer-B .	St
1.1.3	Basically , I want to soft-key command my configuration so that I can flip between my two computers and have the monitors flip simultaneously so that I can have the following : 1 ) Monitor-A displays Computer-A , while Monitor-B displays Computer B .	St
1.1.4	2 ) Press soft-key switch 3 ) Monitor-A displays Computer-B , while Monitor-B displays Computer A .	St
1.1.5	4 ) Press soft-key switch to reverse the above .	St
1.1.6	IMPORTANT : I do not ever want both monitors displaying the same computer at the same time .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions on the KVM ( or similar ) device that will do this ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search & q=kvm+dual+display	St
1.3.1	I see where you are going , you 've got like a datacenter with 1 montor in the overhead rack and one in front of you but I hav n't seenanything like this .	St
1.3.2	Even looking for dual display KVMs is probably just going to find you one that works with 2 dual display conputers buying stuff you need one KVM for the keyboard and mouse ( the only thing that will do you soft key bit ) you need a KVM for each monitor to control which computer is on each monitor and you need a splitter for each computer to send the same immage to mintors KVM but none of that is going to be pretty or cheap with all the equipment .	St
1.3.3	You could probably just build a manual rotary switch .	St
1.3.4	I ran some google searches and you should be able to find not the plans for what you want exactly but what you need to buy for parts Your box for the monitors needs to be shielded or your likly to pick up noise in them	Sug
