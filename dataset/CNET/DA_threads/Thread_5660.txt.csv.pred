1.1.1	Three years ago I put together a machine , as carefully as I could .	St
1.1.2	( Everything was double-checked , static precautions observed , all connections secure . )	St
1.1.3	I didnt get to the point of installing an OS , because the computer had intermittent problems .	St
1.1.4	Right at that time my girlfriend ripped me off of all my money and left , so I got really depressed and just kept using my old machine .	St
1.1.5	Now I want to fix the problem , but Ive forgotten almost everything I knew about putting computers together .	St
1.1.6	Plus its been a long time , in computer years , and technology marches on .	St
1.1.7	But Im hoping someone could give some advice .	St
1.1.8	The machine shows no problems at all if started cold , with 15 minute breaks in-between .	St
1.1.9	( I tried 25 times yesterday , to be sure of this . )	St
1.1.10	When warm and by that I dont mean overheated , just not turned off for long -- I do get intermittent problems .	St
1.1.11	When I start up using the power button , the monitor gets no signal maybe 1 time in 4 .	St
1.1.12	( This almost never happens when I use the reset button . )	St
1.1.13	The power button doesnt always work the same way .	St
1.1.14	Also , the machine sometimes goes to Setup and complains that its now in safe mode because the last time it was booted the speed settings for the processor were inappropriate .	St
1.1.15	( I never altered any speed settings . )	St
1.1.16	I also seem to remember it complaining three years ago that I had the wrong processor , but that was a long time ago , I dont remember the exact message , and I cant duplicate the problem .	St
1.1.17	Any ideas about what I should do ?	Ques
1.1.18	Replacing the motherboard seems like an obvious step to me , but there might be a better idea than that .	St
1.1.19	And if I do replace it , does anyone have any suggestions about what boards to get ?	Ques
1.1.20	As I said , its been a long time .	St
1.1.21	Below is a list of the parts .	St
1.1.22	I dont know what I had in mind , putting so much in there I cant remember why I thought I needed so many drives ( and both types !	St
1.1.23	) , or what scheme I had for partitioning them .	St
1.1.24	Ill have to take something out , as the temps get too hot when the ambient temperature gets up there .	St
1.1.25	Thanks for any help .	St

1.2.1	From what I see , that syste is still a good system .	St
1.2.2	Before you go out and buy a nw mother board , I would try a bare bones setup .	St
1.2.3	You may have a PCI card malfunctioning .	St
1.2.4	Also , you power supply may be the culprit .	St
1.2.5	So I would try to boot it up with bare bones and a PATA drive .	St
1.2.6	And for good measure , try with another power supply .	St
1.2.7	And it may just be as easy as your heat sink not being attached correctly , so check that first !	St
1.3.1	... especially as I ca n't find the CPU support for the P4G8X motherboard !	St
1.3.2	Whatever happened to websites that actually showed old support pages ... . & lt ; sigh & gt ; The problems you describe , ie : CPU type errors , Speed Setting messages , and even Power button operation changes all indicate a problem with the motherboard BIOS .	St
1.3.3	These settings are all saved in the BIOS ( even how the reset button works ) and if you 're having problems with them , it 's easy to check ... .look at the time shown by your PC 's clock .	St
1.3.4	Any failure or loss of BIOS settings usually has the clock show obviously wrong times .	St
1.3.5	This can be as simple as the battery on the motherboard is discharged ( shove a new one in ) , or the jumper for resetting the BIOS is in the wrong position ( look in the manual for the ''clear '' and ''normal '' positions ) .	St
1.3.6	More fundamentally , the motherboard may not actually have the relevant CPU support ( which I ca n't find ) without an updated BIOS flash , or you 're suffering some hardware failure .	St
1.3.7	The last would require testing the system out of the case , with less bits plugged in , then gradually adding boards and drives , to see at what point it becomes unstable .	St
1.3.8	Anyway , with a failed battery you would initially have the system start up as normal , but after use any power it did contain would be lost .	St
1.3.9	Then when you power off and retry you 'd get odd errors as the BIOS battery is now completely drained etc .	St
1.3.10	This has less apparent effect if you only reset , as the BIOS entries have already been checked when you first powered up .	St
1.3.11	The simple fix is ... .do n't power off so much !	St
1.3.12	lol Switch on , use your PC as normal , and when you 're done either go into standby ( switch off your monitor remember !	St
1.3.13	) , or use it 's inherent processing power to help ... . http : //folding.stanford.edu/ ( help find treatments/cures to cancer and other diseases ) http : //www.worldcommunitygrid.org/ ( HIV/AIDS treatments , decrypt the human proteome ) http : //www.grid.org/ ( Cancer treatments , and human proteome ) http : //www.bbc.co.uk/sn/hottopics/climatechange/ ( climate change ... .by leaving your PC on ! )	St
