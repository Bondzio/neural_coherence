Would the port be located on the motherboard?
It is a 2Y832.
I've had this thing apart several times and don't recall seeing a SATA cable, but if I could plug in to the motherboard I'll do that and save the converter for something else.
Also, can I use the cable from the old CD player.
I believe it is SATA and does'nt work anyway.
In doing this, how would I change SETUP?
