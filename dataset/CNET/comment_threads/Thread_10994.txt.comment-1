I just wanted to mention that I was so upset about the teck support at Dell I wrote a letter on 1/20/05 and I received a call from the head office today.
He was very nice and I told him there were many many customers who are unhapply about the support.
He said he wished more people let him know about a problem with the support so they know where they stand.
I am only posting this to suggest that anyone who has had problems write a letter so they are aware of how many customers are/were dissatisfied.
