i've got a similar setup and scarchunk is bang on the money.
the artic freezer pro 7 is (imo) the best after-market coolor for a p4.
it's cool and quiet (to steal a phrase) and cheap ($35).
unless you're absolutely sold on a 6800gs, take a look at current pricing on an x850xt.
both it and the 6800gs are starting at $170 on newegg.
but the x850xt is significantly faster out the box (no tweaking necessary).
it's fan is a bit noisier (but artic makes a silencer for it also).
