8393	0	65862	781633	NR	MagellanGuy	2/21/05 7:05 PM	1.1090127E12	Using one Linksys WRT54G to Extend the Range of Another	I have one WRT54G connected to my DSL modem and configured as a Gateway. I have a computer connected to one of the Gateway's LAN ports and another WRTG54G connected to an other of the Gatway's LAN ports. The second WRT54G is configured as a Router. Both are configured with WEP security. When the computer cabled to the Gateway WRT54G is turned-off, another computer can maintain a flawless, highspeed Internet connection with the WRT54G configured as a Router. When I turn-on the computer that is cabled to the Gateway, I lose the wireless connection on the WRT54G configured as the Router. I can get the connection back by re-booting the computer with the wireless connection, but then I lose the Internet connection on the computer cabled to the Gateway. Basically, I can only have one computer connected to the Internet at any given time. Any suggestions? Thank you!

One in the living room and one in the room at the back of my house. I connected them together via cable. I us one of them as a AP (access point) and the other one as a router connecting the DSL modem. I get excellent connection every where in the house.

It almost sounds too good to be true. I have a 4 computer wireless network now and would love to be able to use my wrt54g to connect to my d-link di-624. --John M. www.bigskymassage.com
