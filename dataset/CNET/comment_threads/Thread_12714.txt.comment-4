Because RAID 1 recovery is very unsure and unsafe to the files on the RAID 1 set.
If you had not mentioned RAID I would have linked to the CNET Storage Forum &quot;Lost and Found&quot; sticky top post where there are many recovery titles for free and free to try.
But your post had RAID so I have to defer to the safest methods.
I can't help people destroy their last copy of their files.
Hope you understand, Bob
