the usual way to copy a dvd is to use roxio toast and choose copy.
you should also be able to use the disk utility to make an image of the original dvd, provided that it is not a commercial encrypted dvd.
once you have made the image, you can reproduce as many copies as you want using the finder as the burning software.
if you need further help, just holler.
