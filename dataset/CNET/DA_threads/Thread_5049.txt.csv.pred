1.1.1	Think I've boiled it down to these two for the upgrade of my Dell C521 with 4GB 32-bit 280 Watt Any ideas..it's for tv wacthing and gaming (GTA4,Oblivion,Far Cry2) Thanks again for the help	St
1.2.1	Ok, those are two of the best cards around.	St
1.2.2	I personally have a Geforce 9800 512 MB and it runs great, I play CODWAW, Simcity Socitites, Age of Empires III, and many other graphic heavy games and i can run all my games on max quality with no lag.	St
1.2.3	(Mind you that I custom build my machine and i run 64 bit windows 7 rc) However i think that the Geforce 9500 1 GB card might be better because it has more dedicated graphics memory, and it should be able to play games for many more years to come.	St
1.3.1	The 9800 is the winner here.	St
1.3.2	It may need a big power supply but given these 2 choices, the gamer should pick the 9800.	St
1.3.3	Again.	St
1.3.4	That POWER SUPPLY will have to be upgraded.	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Shouldn't the 9500 1 GB card be better as it has more dedicated graphics memory than the 9800 512 MB card.	St
1.4.2	Just a thought.	St
1.4.3	Also, he is right on the power supply, it will probably need to be upgraded also but their not that expensive.	St
1.5.1	You can research this at tomshardware.com.	St
1.5.2	But either should be too taxing for the 280 Watt power supply.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Both cards are pretty good however from the info on tigerdirect.com the 9800 card is much better.	St
1.6.2	However with that said it is about 50 bucks (US) more.	St
1.6.3	Read the info below.	St
1.6.4	Geforce 9500 GT 1 GB http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4111742&CatId=3669 Geforce 9800 GTX 512 MB http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4893208&CatId=3670	St
