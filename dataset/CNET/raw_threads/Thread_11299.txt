We've previously been using &quot;HP V-M200&quot; access points, but we encoutered heavy throughput problems with these. During my tests of the network, I've seen these APs decrease their tranfer-rate to 30Mb, during file-transfer and ping-test. The issue here is concerning the transfer-rate from the Network Interface Card of my laptop to the wireless AP (did an iptraf while testing, and then noticed the 30Mb). Suffice to say, we're after the best of the best in wireless technology, but our realistic demands are as follows: - Supports 802.11n, a-b and g. - Supports up to 2 ESSIDS. - Supports VLAN. - Supports WPA2 and RADIUS. Any suggestions? Or is there somebody with some good experience, with certain APs that fulfills these criteria?

Your seasoned IT person uses FTP or a test tool. Since WiFi is a shared access system, it's proper for the speed to drop off so that others can get access. I wonder if folk in this industry talk to buyers about all this. It's been a few years but the last we used Cisco. The models have changed so I won't tell what we used back then. Bob
