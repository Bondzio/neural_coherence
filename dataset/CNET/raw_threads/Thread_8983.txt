I've never done any upgrades to items like the processor. How do I know what processors my motherboard will handle and other such info? My system is about 5 years old at this point, an HP Pavilion 8575c (more detailed specs at - http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?lc=en&cc=us&docname=bph05190#top ) Can somebody explain this to me or point me in the direction of some documentation to help? Thanks

It will give you detailed specs. of all the hardware installed on your computer. Then go to the motherboard manufacturers website and search for maximum cpu support for your board. Note: If you can locate the manual that came with your machine, you may find this info there.
