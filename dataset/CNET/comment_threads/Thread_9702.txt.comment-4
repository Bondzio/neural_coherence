The restore CD I taped inside the case.
It's never lost unless they lose it.
As such, it's never an issue if they have to pay up for it.
-&gt; Such restore systems are not free unless you are a programmer.
Most will pay homage to Acronis or another company to add in such a feature.
Are you a programmer?
