<s> All we want to do is be able to have the laptop go on line wireless so we don't have to have an external modem and a phone line hanging out the side connected by one of our only two usb ports.We have dial up service and the laptop has no internal modem.just the wireless intel mini n card.We don't need to share the connection with any other computers/printers.Just need plain simple wireless dialup connection if it can be done.The laptop is bluetooth 2.0 equipped if that helps. </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> The BT solution will cost more and be harder to setup. </s>
<s> It will also be slower. </s>
