<s> Hi, just got this iBook 12&quot; in the mail been to a mac shop before i bought it where the owner was told the screen had died. </s>
<s> Motherboard was said to be Ok by the repairer I replaced the screen with a know working one and the screen was dead. </s>
<s> Then after the fiddle of pulling it apart again wondered if i could use the hard drive on another ibook. </s>
<s> The hard drive i put in another iBook which loaded up fine with display. </s>
<s> later i tried again but it was a dead screen? </s>
<s> *Is it that both ibooks have faulty motherboards? </s>
<s> Motherboard determines a display? </s>
<s> Or could it be the display module ? </s>
<s> What else could cause dead screen? </s>
<s> Cables good. </s>
<s> Cheers Cas </s>
<s> then try applying pressure, squeezing, to the left of the trackpad but on the same level You may be surprised at the results. </s>
<s> The iBook G4 was notorious for this problem which is caused by broken solder joints on the graphics chip connections to the logicboard. </s>

<s> Hi, thanks i pressed on the area and there was sort of change. </s>
<s> it opened up on it's own last night and worked perfectly, some flashing of screen, but worked. </s>
<s> Can the solder joints be repaired? </s>
<s> Read that you can re-heat this area to re-solder/ place bit of lino in case to pressure the spot............. Or do you just end up with a pile of un-fixable ibooks? </s>
<s> Is the earlier Clamshell less faulty? </s>
<s> Cheers Cas </s>
<s> the trick is to find someone who can do it. </s>
<s> Google for it, there are places that specialize in all sorts of things. </s>
<s> The earlier clamshells were less faulty but, on the other hand, they only had a G3 processor, went slower, not all had Firewire but they were built like the proverbial outhouse. </s>
