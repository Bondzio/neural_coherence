Hi, I installed a Network card on a PC with windows ME.
Earlier the same card was installed on a windows 2000 pc.
Now, when i have connected the PC to the network, i was able to see the LAN status icon in windows 2000.
There was a option to activate it in windows 2000 too through network properties.
I not able to see this status icon in windows ME even am using the same NIC card.
I was not able to find any option too like windows 2k to turn it on.
Please help me as how to display this network status icon on windows ME
