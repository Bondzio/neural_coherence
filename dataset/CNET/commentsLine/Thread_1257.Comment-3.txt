&gt;&gt;try updating the drivers, and i think you will have to use one of the ps (post script) ones.&lt;&lt; thanks for suggestion, unfortunately i already tried this.
it is definately the printer and wordperfect.
i switched with co-worker and her printer (hp) worked fine.
i may have to see if we can make switch permanent or see if boss will spring for new printer.
but will would like to see if i can resolve it first.
