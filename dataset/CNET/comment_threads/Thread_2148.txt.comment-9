her's the thing, dvd shrink will pull files off a dvd (and you can then view them on your pc) but has no software for writing dvd's-- instaed it looks for nero's dvd writing software and if you don't have it it tells you to install nero.
be advised, home burned dvd's in my experience work pretty well on most nachines but they don't last very long.
after a few months they get funky and unplayable.
