<s> I have just bought a Ricoh Africo AP4510. </s>
<s> It will not print. </s>
<s> It is online. </s>
<s> the cables are correctly plugged in. </s>
<s> the power supply is on. </s>
<s> i send a page to print and nothing happens and it comes up printer error. </s>
<s> Even a test page will not print from my computer. </s>
<s> I have connected it through the LPT1 port. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what i am doing wrong. </s>
<s> Do I need to clear out some registers or other stuff on my computer. </s>
<s> The computer tells me the LPT1 port is working and ok. </s>
<s> Please help i've spent hours on this. </s>
<s> Since DOS can send to LPT1 I boot to DOS and tap the PrtScr (print screen) key about 3 or 4 times to see if the printer is alive. </s>
<s> If not I know its my machine or cable and proceed to fix that. </s>

<s> hi thanks for your help. </s>
<s> It is still not printing. </s>
<s> I have checked the cable and changed it. </s>
<s> The printer will print a test page from its own menu - so i know the printer is working. </s>
<s> http://www.gcopnet.com/pdf/ricoh/AP4510.pdf I do NOT own this printer but a cousin of this model needed a menu item turned on to allow the printer port to work. </s>
<s> http://www.ricoh-usa.com/downloads/manuals.asp is where the manuals are. </s>
<s> I haven't read it yet but leave that to you. </s>
<s> Good luck and try the network connection next. </s>

<s> Hi thanks for the links. </s>
<s> I have went through the setup process again. </s>
<s> I am not using this printer on a network. </s>
<s> It is connected to my stand alone desktop computer. </s>
<s> I am completely confused by this problem. </s>
<s> I'd move to a network connection next if service is not available to show you it functioning. </s>
