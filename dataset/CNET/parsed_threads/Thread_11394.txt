<s> I bought a system a few months ago powered by an AMD Athlon 64 3200+. </s>
<s> I'm now wondering what, if any, the benefits are of having the 64-bit processor. </s>
<s> I see that Windows has a trial 64-bit version of XP, but I'm not likely to install anything that's still in the trial stage of development. </s>
<s> Is there anything out there I could/should be taking advantage of at this point? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> For me, the one tool I use is Virtual Dub which gains percentage in time reduction. </s>
<s> XP SP2 as well as Suse Linux 64 is a bonus as well. </s>
<s> There's also a bufferoverflow protection feature worth noting. </s>
<s> I'm not going back to all 32. </s>
