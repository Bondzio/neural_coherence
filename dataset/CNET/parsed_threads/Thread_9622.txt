<s> I have two external hard drives that I want to wipe clean (not reformat; wipe clean). </s>
<s> Are the disks still usable after being wiped? </s>
<s> Is it possible to reformat the hard drives for further use, and if so how? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Methods vary depending on your intended purpose. </s>
<s> When I do this, I usually look for the manufacturer's destructive utility that performs a complete diagnostic test of the drive to disclose any problems such as bad sectors. </s>
<s> Once this is completed and if no deficiencies are noted, you use it as if it was a new drive. </s>
<s> You partition and format the external drive using the computer you attach it to. </s>
<s> and format the drives as desired with the your system OS....specifically 'disk management'. </s>
