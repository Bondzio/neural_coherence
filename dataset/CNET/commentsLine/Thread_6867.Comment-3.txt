there's been some talk on here about motorola xoom and i thought i'd give it a review after getting my motorola xoom.
i've been a member for 2 days now and so far its been really good.
i've been able to download all the harry potter books, the entire twilight series, some david balducci books, and even the comic book of that new movie 'kick-ass the only downfall i saw is when you turn up the volume the sound get distorted because the speakers cannot handle very high volume i seem them on sale on amazon
