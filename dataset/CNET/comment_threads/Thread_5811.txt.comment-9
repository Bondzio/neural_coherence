The powersupply will start to falter in a year or two?
Really?
Would you say that's the only disadvantage of this PC?
Could you take a look at this link: http://www.komplett.dk/k/config.aspx?ConfigSystemId=10746 Under &quot;Stromforsyninger&quot; (means powersupply), there's a list of power supplies to choose.
Which one would you then recommend?
