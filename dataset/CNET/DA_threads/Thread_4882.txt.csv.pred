1.1.1	For occasional home printing needs what company has the cheapest in term of $ cost ie replacement cartridges?	St
1.2.1	The cheapest up front costs on an everyday basis are generally the store brands of paper and cartridges.	St
1.2.2	Staples, OfficeMax, etc., have their own.	St
1.2.3	Sometimes there are special sales on name brand items.	St
1.2.4	I prefer to wait and stock up then.	St
1.2.5	Now, a lower cartridge cost does not guarantee that you will get as many usable pages of print.	St
1.3.1	Bought an Epson printer some 4 years ago; thus got introduced to high ink-cartridge prices and chips on cartridges (to prevent refilling).	St
1.3.2	There are &quot;work-arounds&quot; available to re-use the same, refilled cartridges again, but they are cumbersome.	St
1.3.3	Did dozends of refills on a couple of black cartridges, but the print-head finally clogged and could not be &quot;cleared&quot; (maybe as claimed by Epson, because of using &quot;off-brand&quot; inks).	St
1.3.4	Because of high cost of a &quot;shop-repair&quot; / cleaning of the heads I decided to look around for alternates.	St
1.3.5	Found a Canon &quot;remanufactured&quot; printer for $ 50, bought it, since the cartridges in it were worth the cost!	St
1.3.6	Also &quot;lucked out&quot; on several features that came with the printer: each color has its own cartidge (my earlier Epson had 3 colors combined in one cartrige, making replacment necessary each time only one of the colors ran out!!!	St
1.3.7	--- except when doing refilling).	St
1.3.8	The Canon does not use the chip on the cartridges, allowing hazzle-free refilling.	St
1.3.9	The cartridges are only half &quot;sponge&quot; and half liquid-reservoir (while most others are completely filled with &quot;sponge&quot;), thus they are running longer, before replacement / refilling is necessary.	St
1.3.10	Finally, the printer has a &quot;user-replaceable&quot; print-head assembly, which is available as &quot;re-built&quot; via the Internet, allowing home-replacement in case of failure, rather than shop-repair, that would have been needed with the Epson, with its &quot;built-in&quot; print-heads.	St
1.3.11	All these features make Canon printers using the &quot;BCI-3e&quot; cartridges and replaceable print-head assemblies a very interesting and cost-efficient printer.	St
