if removal of power and that reset fails, it's likely to be dead.
reading  is interesting in that it could have a security issue.
bring that up when you call in for rma.
tip: be nice, but firm on the phone.
no threats, growls or such.
if in warranty, good.
if not, use that security issue to make your point it should be exchanged.
tip 2: accept a replacement of another model if it does the same job.
observation.
officemax had a belkin router for 10 to 15 bucks.
i have no use for another one, but the problem is that shipping can run as much as replacement.
this makes a mess out of repair options.. bob
