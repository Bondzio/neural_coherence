It's a Pavilion a1747c, running an AMD 64 dual processor with 3 Gigs of ram. I am running Windows Vista Home Premium. Lately on boot, I receive a notice that the system fan has failed and to press F2 to ignore. The system then boots normally. I keep all vents clean and blow dust out of the Mother board at least every Month or so. Both internal fans are running normally and they are quiet. Is there a way to clear the message? I have never had a shutdown because of heat. Thanks.

If you find more than 2-wires going to the fan, that maybe the fault lies. I suggest you at least reseat the fan connection several times, clean it and see if it changes or goes away. Otherwise, if the error doesn't cause a non-boot for the the PC it becomes more of an nuisance, provide the fan actually works. tada -----Willy

The result is when the bios does it's scan the rpm's are too low......error. When you open the case and look at the fan it is now up to speed.....looks good. The fix......replace the fan.
