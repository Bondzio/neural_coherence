1.1.1	What about the new fantastic Sonys ?	Ques
1.1.2	Does anyone have experience with those ?	Ques
1.1.3	?	Ques
1.2.1	I have n't used the new Sony Desktops ( I build my own desktops now anyway ) , but I usually recommend avoiding Sony for a few reasons .	St
1.2.2	1 .	St
1.2.3	Sony products are usually at least slightly overpriced .	St
1.2.4	They 're good , but not at that cost 2 .	St
1.2.5	Sony 's warranty services .	St
1.2.6	Sony 's products are good WHEN THEY WORK .	St
1.2.7	However , if you have a product/component quit working for any reason , be prepared to fight like hell to even get them to acknowledge the warranty .	Sug
1.2.8	They will actively try to get out of replacing something that is clearly in warranty .	Sug
1.2.9	3 .	St
1.2.10	While not so much anymore , Sony used to be big on using proprietary formats for EVERYTHING ( MD players using ATRAC3 , Digicams using Sony memory sticks , etc )	St
1.3.1	sony does use ATRAC3 for audio on lots of things , as it provides a tighter compression ( it 's like 2x MP3 or something ) but it 's always used on stuff that includes software to break it back to MP3 ( like PSP , which uses ATRAC3 , but it 's software for PC ( that loads the music ) is capable of putting it into MP3/converting it , so that you can use it on either ) also all OEM builders have their own format for the motherboard ( most do , to hinder upgrades/save money ) Dell is horrible about this ^	St
1.4.1	support is & quot ; famously & quot ; bad ... so you 're better off returning anything within the & quot ; no questions & quot ; return period if you find any kind of problem .	St
1.4.2	Lemons are usually just & quot ; lemons & quot ; ... and usually ca n't be & quot ; fixed & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	What they usually need is to be & quot ; refurbished & quot ; .	St
1.4.4	So , if there 's a problem , do n't allow anyone to delay you with double talk -- just return the unit .	St
1.4.5	( Delaying tactics that cause you to wait beyond the return period are becoming more and more common in the industry . )	St
1.4.6	Tell them you & quot ; do n't like the color & quot ; .	St
1.4.7	You can also always buy another one later -- and no one really cares how many times you do so .	St
1.4.8	( One of my friends is famous for returning stuff and going back as many times as it takes to get a fully functional unit ... always at a super discount . )	St
1.4.9	That said , Sony does make some fine equipment ... even if it is a little expensive .	St
1.4.10	JDM ( *BTW , their laptops tend to be on the delicate side and overheat easily on AC power .	St
1.4.11	It 's best to run them as much as possible on battery power ... and do n't drop anything made by Sony ! )	St
1.5.1	You got that right , i would love to get my hands on the RA or was it the RB , idk , but the one with the liqid-cooling .	St
1.5.2	Roger	St
1.6.1	JDM	St
1.7.1	The title says it all .	St
1.7.2	Avoid Sony .	St
1.8.1	Sony makes really good stuff -- but if there 's any kind of problem , you 're better off returning your purchase .	St
