1.1.1	Hello !	St
1.1.2	i am a new user here on the cnet forums .	St
1.1.3	I have recently purchased a Series 7 chronos , it came with a 1TB hybrid drive , i have recently installed an intel SSD , however , the SSD ( 8GB ) from the hybrid drive still shows up on my system ( even after a fresh windows 8 install ) i would like to know if anyone has ever came across somthing like this .	St
1.1.4	i am wondering if it is pulling this from my SSD , but i have a 180GB 520 series ( disk manager says its actually 167 GB ) is there a way to see what & quot ; port & quot ; this thinks its plugged into ?	Ques
1.1.5	keep in mind , i can format this , move files to it because i can do all this im wondering if its actual memory that i just cant see .	St
1.1.6	i have 8GB of ram , but i do not have a RAMdisk set up , so im ruleing that out immediately .	St
1.1.7	Anyone have any ideas ? !	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	I do not have that model but many Samsungs have a wake from zero power sleep feature and they use such memory to accomplish this feat .	St
1.2.2	Since you are dealing with a fresh install of the OS you may see this as a drive and not hidden as normal .	St
1.2.3	From what I read this memory is on the mainboard and ca n't be unplugged .	St
1.2.4	You might be able to disable it in the BIOS but that 's a question for Samsung support .	St
