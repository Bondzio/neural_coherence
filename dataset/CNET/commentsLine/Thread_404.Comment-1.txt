does xp allow for people who wish to use 1980's or early '90's monitors?
my monitor is &quot;impression3 plus&quot; non interlaced the display (& printout) is out of wack, for example a webpage can sprawl over 2 pages when it's supposed to be only one page.
i've been trialling this old spare monitor, since i'd been experiencing acute electrosensitivity with the samsung syncmaster 151s lcd.
i'm *definitely* experiencing less electrosensitivity with it than with the &quot;high-tech&quot; lcd.
with the latter, i'd sometimes wake up the next day with acute abdominal pains.
i suspect it's because i cannot adjust the syncmaster to be dimmer than a certain point.
anyone know whether there are any lcd manufacturers who *do* cater to photosensitivity by allowing the brightness to be turned very very very dim, the way dial knob crts are?
