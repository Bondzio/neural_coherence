and reading other responses (including yours); if you have a new case, then why not try that first (what can it hurt, and it won't cost you anything).
second; i tend to lean towards the psu &quot;this has gone on since very early on&quot;; a psu can crap out at anytime, try unplugging all the components except the mobo (see if the mobo/heatsink boots, should hear error beeps), then plug in components one at a time (booting between each component).
it may be your 'favourite' psu; but it sounds like it has been causing problems from the start.
you don't have to spend a fortune on a new psu, just get one from a reliable manufacturer (thermaltake, corsair, antec, silverstone).
