1.1.1	i have a HP a6407c AMD 64x2 4400+ 2.3gh pc with NVIDIA GeForce 6800 card .	St
1.1.2	i have no idea how to figure out what video upgrade i can use .	Res
1.1.3	i want one with at least 1g for playing WoW and other games .	St
1.1.4	any help is appreciated .	Polite
1.1.5	Happy Holidays to all	St
1.2.1	or download cpu-z ( http : //www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php ) to determine if you have a pci-express or agp graphics slot .	St
1.2.2	if agp , your options will be very limited since it is obsolete .	St
1.3.1	If you are going to install an after market vid card in the HP system you would do well to also replace the PSU , the standard PSU will not likely fly a 1GB card very well , if at all .	St
1.4.1	I would suggest going with the 4000 ATI series , it actually doenst matter if you use 512 MB or 1 GB in terms of power usage	St
