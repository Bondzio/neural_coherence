1.1.1	I do n't have any kind of technical background with computers , so your help is greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.2	I am getting into video editing and just got PowerDirector 9 .	St
1.1.3	Our current laptops could run it , but I would rather use a beefier machine that can handle it with ease .	Sug
1.1.4	In addition to that , the computer would mostly be used for simple internet browsing and Microsoft Office 2010/beyond .	St
1.1.5	We would like to store all of our photos on there as well .	St
1.1.6	Without any true computing knowledge , I do not know how much computer I really need .	St
1.1.7	I would like to keep the total package under $ 1,000 .	St
1.1.8	Any guidance , assistance , or suggestions would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.9	I can post additional information if it is needed .	St
1.1.10	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	for video editing you will need a computer with a lot of memory , at least 500GB ( I would recommend a 1TB { TerraByte } hard drive ) .	St
1.2.2	A fast processor ( a 2ghz+ at the minimum ) , graphics card , optical drive with write capability and some expansion slots for future upgrades .	St
1.2.3	You CAN get one for under $ 1,000 but you will find that quality desktops capable of editing large movies will run over your budget .	St
1.2.4	You do n't have much computing expierience ... are you comfortable attempting digital editing ?	Ques
1.3.1	As for the digital editing , the program I got is called Power Director 9 ... it had very good reviews and the demo was easy to use .	St
1.3.2	I am pretty good with user-friendly software , just not tech specs .	St
1.3.3	To be honest , most of this editing will just be photos and not actual video ...	St
1.3.4	I would be creating DVD slideshows set to music with some graphical overlays and/or transitions , but I do n't plan on much beyond that .	St
1.3.5	What kind of processor does that put me in ?	Ques
1.3.6	2ghz+ makes sense , but what I struggle with is Intel vs. Athlon vs ... . ?	Ques
1.3.7	I just do n't know .	St
1.3.8	I was thinking probably 1TB of memory , so that sounds good .	St
1.3.9	Other specs though ?	Ques
1.3.10	Are there any particular brands I should or should n't check out ?	Ques
1.3.11	I know this is subjective , but I have no frame of reference and need input .	St
1.3.12	Thanks so much for the response !	St
1.4.1	Hi Ray , Well I must be honest I am not too familiar with editing software so I am going to give you some general advice that should help you .	St
1.4.2	Since you are creating DVD slide shows you will need an optical drive with writable capability .	St
1.4.3	If you can afford it you should get one that will write to both standard DVD 's and Blu-ray .	St
1.4.4	This will allow you to produce DVD 's for a wider variety of players ( important if your selling these ) .	St
1.4.5	Also look for a term called LightScribe .	St
1.4.6	LightScribe is a method of burning data into DVDs .	St
1.4.7	It also allows you to & quot ; print & quot ; artwork directly onto a dvd vs having to print out a label and sticking it onto the dvd later .	St
1.4.8	This is what the pros use and it will give your DVD 's a more professional quality .	St
1.4.9	It does n't add much more to the cost anyway .	St
1.4.10	Processors are a different matter .	St
1.4.11	You want the best processor you can afford .	St
1.4.12	Both Intel and Atheon make good processors .	St
1.4.13	I would recommend no less than an Intel i5 Core processor as your minimum ( or the Atheon equivelant ) .	St
1.4.14	The processor is like your computers brain and the faster the processor , the faster your computer .	St
1.4.15	Also make sure that your computer has the appropriate connections for whatever your using to record your pics / movies .	Sug
1.4.16	I would recommend no fewer that 4 USB ports .	St
1.4.17	Be nice if it came with an eSATA port but I do n't think that is essential ( eSATA ports are going to be the USB replacements and are much faster that the current USB ports ) .	St
1.4.18	If you will be using a camcorder take a look at the cables that came with it and make sure the computer can accomadate them .	St
1.4.19	If the computer comes with a graphics card it should be able to .	St
1.4.20	Make sure you have a graphics card .	St
1.4.21	I will be honest , you will have to trust the salesman on this as I do n't know too much about graphics cards .	St
1.4.22	Again you will need to get the best you can afford as that will make your editing easier .	St
1.4.23	As far as computer brands go almost all of the major brands are good .	St
1.4.24	I do n't know too much about the Systemax brand other than they sell for cheap .	St
1.4.25	I would stay away from them .	St
1.4.26	Dell , Lenovo / IBM , apple , HP , etc .	St
1.4.27	are all good .	Polite
1.4.28	I will say that everyone I know that works in video /photography has strongly recommended apple and they use apple computers for their editing .	St
1.4.29	Might look into those but they will be expensive .	St
1.4.30	Hope this helps .	St
1.5.1	Thank you again for your response .	St
1.5.2	That gives me a good place to start .	St
1.5.3	I do n't plan on selling an DVD 's ( though that could be a good business opportunity !	St
1.5.4	) ; it is more for family/friend purposes .	St
1.5.5	I will be making the slideshow for my upcoming wedding with the software , and may do the same for other friends getting married soon .	St
1.5.6	I 'm at the age where our families start to grow , too , so I 'm sure I can use the software to chronicle those memories as well .	St
1.5.7	If a business springs out of it , great !	St
1.5.8	I did consider Apple , but I really want to stick with a PC .	St
1.5.9	I ca n't stand using Microsoft Office on a Mac ... and I will be using that fairly frequently as well .	St
1.5.10	I think the software I have will be more than adequate for my purposes and should be fine on the PC .	St
1.5.11	Thanks for that suggestion though .	St
1.5.12	Again , thank you for the input and I will get to looking around .	St
1.5.13	Much appreciated !	St
