it's up-to-date.
here's the link for your motherboard (mobo):  your mobo uses standardized usb pinouts.
if your firewire card has an internal port, it will be standardized also.
your mobo has front-panel audio port (page 1-30) and an s/pdif port (page 1-28) with simple and fully documented pinouts.
if you're still having problems connecting your multifunction panel, you should replace it, and not the motherboard.
