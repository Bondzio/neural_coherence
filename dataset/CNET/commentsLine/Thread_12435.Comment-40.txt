so these guys go and download the amset utility, which changes the parameters of the seek travel in the drive so it no longers slams into the stops at the end of the travel or reduces the speed of the motion slightly so the noise is less noticeable.
seems to me the manufacturer should have made the drive quiet to begin with.
i have a wd 120gb hd and not only can i just barely hear it running, but the only time i even hear it seeking is when it is really looking hard for something, like during a search.
the sound it makes is like a geiger counter, but it is so quiet you actually have to have your ear close to the tower to hear it at all.
