the KVM is EXACTLY what you need!
Your problem is the PCs (Macs, laptops, whatever) are not supplying enough current thru their USB ports to adequately power the KVM chip.
Since the TK-209 has no option to use a power adapter, you have to attach at least one PC (not laptop) from its rear USB port.
Or buy another KVM which has a DC power input option.
