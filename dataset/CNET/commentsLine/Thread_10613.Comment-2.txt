the memory is obviously not compatible with your system.
you should check with a company like crucial ( and put in the specifications of your system so you can get memory that is recommended.
not all systems that use 100mhz ram work with 133mhz, most will, but not all.
do try removing and reseating the memory as a final test before returning it.
