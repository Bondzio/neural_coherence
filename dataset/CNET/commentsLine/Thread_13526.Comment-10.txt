i am enjoying my new pc, it's so fast!
i did call best buy because i didn't see a windows xp with my new pc, and they told me i could create a recovery cd like you said, or buy one from hp.
i am still planning on putting the cpu in my old presario as soon as my brother in law pays for the one he fried.
i'll keep in touch.
thanks
