for what you want to do with your new computer, why not get a mac?.
they are a lot easier to set up then an xp, and you can not only watch dvd's but burn them too (on selected models).
i reccommend going to an apple store and finding out all you can about macs... and if you do like the look of the macs, you can install bootcamp on it and still run windows xp.
good luck
