XP is so much more stable than W95/98.
That's why the reset button is gone.
XP can recover from frozen screens, if and when they ever happen.
I have four PCs running XP Home and Pro and it never happens to me.
Then, again, pressing the power button for &gt;5 seconds powers off and you can power back up.
