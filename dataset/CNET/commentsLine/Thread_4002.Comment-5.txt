but you could create a script to delete it.
i won't bore you with why windows is coded to remember it and why it would cause users to erupt into flame as the connection dropped and they would have to re-enter the password.
but think about these tools to research where it is stored to write a script.
(you do this!)
so there is it.
regmon, filemon or just use the new thing.
sorry but you ask a good question but it flies in the face of ease of use so you get to craft your own solution.
