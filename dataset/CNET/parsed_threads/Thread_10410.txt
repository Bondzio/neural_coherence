<s> About three weeks ago i posted a problem with my Hp pavillion xt853 that would not boot when powered up. </s>
<s> Some of you suggested that i replace the battery for my BIOS so i did. </s>
<s> So far no luck, the only thing that i notice differently was the beep sequence that it gives when i first turn it on. </s>
<s> It starts with one beep than two consecutive beeps twice and at the and one solo beep. </s>
<s> (beep------beep,beep,beep-beep,beep,beep------beep) if you guys have any more suggestions i will greatly appreciate it. </s>
<s> thanks for your help \ freddy </s>
<s> Beep code 1-3-3-1 is memory sizing problem. </s>
<s> Check dram seating, if possible try one pair, or single dimm as appropriate, try different memory stick(s) if available. </s>
<s> Also could be the Mother Board. </s>
<s> Holtr, I was originally thinking of just swapping the mother board and upgrading to a pentium 4. </s>
<s> If i drift this way do you have any suggestions to what kind of board i should purchase. </s>
<s> thanks for your help man freddy </s>
<s> That my friend is a memory problem, you have a bad stick of memory. </s>
<s> if you have two sticks take one out try booting the machine again. </s>
<s> If problem still, take the other one out put the first one back in. </s>
<s> My hp dv6700 laptop just stoped working and would not boot. </s>
<s> It just beeped a few times but didnt boot up. </s>
<s> I replaced the ram and its working perfect again Thanks for the tip !!! </s>
