1.1.1	A friend of mine got me a USB thumbdrive on her recent trip to Hong Kong .	St
1.1.2	The first time i inserted into the USB port on my laptop it worked fine , but when i tried to write some files onto it , my antivirus start popping out saying there 's a worm/virus , not sure which one actually is on the thumbdrive .	St
1.1.3	So after ignoring these messages and choosing & quot ; Ignore & quot ; every single time , it still wont go away .	St
1.1.4	Finally i started selecting & quot ; Delete & quot ; instead and after that the antivirus messages stopped popping up .	St
1.1.5	But that 's when my problem started , the next time i tried to access the thumbdrive , it says i have to format it and i select ok. Then it gives me an error message , saying that the formatting of my thumbdrive could not be completed .	St
1.1.6	When i checked Properties for the thumbdrive , it now shows that amound of disk space available and used are both 0 when its supposed to show 7.85GB .	St
1.1.7	Then whenever i double clicked on the thumbdrive , it gives me this error message & quot ; Please insert disk into drive G & quot ; .	St
1.1.8	I dont even know what that means or what am i supposed to do .	St
1.1.9	I then thought of going to the manufacturers website to download a tool or utility to solve this problem , but this thumbdrive happens to be one of those anonymous made thumbdrives .	St
1.1.10	It is printed on the thumbdrive the word & quot ; SONY & quot ; and & quot ; Micro Vault & quot ; but when i went to Sony 's website , non of the Micro Vault thumbdrives looked like the one that I have .	St
1.1.11	My laptop uses WinXP SP2 Home edition and i 've tried the thumbdrive on all of 3 USB ports , and also on my sister 's desktop but still to no avail .	St
1.1.12	Can anyone help me out here , because it would be a real shame if i have to throw away this 8GB thumbdrive .	St
1.1.13	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	http : //www.seoulcc.org/consumer-alert-sony/Report_on_Sony_Thumb_Drives.pdf It 's some 64MB chip inside so you will be wasting your time on this one .	St
1.2.2	Hopefully the time I 've saved you will pay for any other stick .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
