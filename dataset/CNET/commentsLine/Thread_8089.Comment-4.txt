maybe years ago you needed to worry about the details.
routers and pc are very standardized and have many features that just automatically handle these detail.
many routers have gotten to the point they even generate all the security keys and such for you.
the only time you worry about your radio frequency is when it doesn't work because of things like interference.
it is unlikely if you live in a area that you must use satellite you will have neighbors overlapping your wireless router channels.
you can spend your time looking at how b,g,n work but it will mean nothing in your case.
you are limited by the satellite technology.
no matter what you do you cannot solve the issue of having your data travel the huge distances all the way to the satellite and back to the ground on the remote end.
certain types of programs do not work or work very poorly.
if you want to study something study the issue related to running data over satellite.
you can't fix it but at least you will know which type of network problems you can fix and which you cannot.
