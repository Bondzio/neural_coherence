I am looking for a BIOS update later than 1.1, which is already on the computer. I can't find a website for Procomp, and I can't find any BIOS updates anywhere !

Go to http://www.biosupgrades.com/global/model.cfm?model=1952 . That must be the bios update you need. Watch out though. Updating the bios is kind of risky. So be sure to follow the direction for that specific update.
