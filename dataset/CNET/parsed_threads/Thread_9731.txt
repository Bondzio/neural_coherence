<s> I have a Linksys router (Model: WRT54GS) that I purchased in early 2007. </s>
<s> So far it has worked ok. With all the extensive changes in technology (almost every day) is there a time frame when I should look to upgrade my routher, or just wait for it to wear out? </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice. </s>
<s> the Internet completely changes to IPv6. </s>
<s> And you'll need to change the modem also. </s>
<s> Only one modem and one router today (that I've found) are IPv6 and DOCSIS-3 ready. </s>
<s> The modem is the Cisco DCP3000 (mine) and the D-link DIR-825. </s>
<s> and I would add that, if the modem is supplied by your ISP they will most likely want to supply any new one. </s>
<s> So you will have to trust to your ISP to upgrade when they are IPv6 ready. </s>
<s> If they do not offer an IPv6 capable router at the same time, that is when you should get a new one. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
