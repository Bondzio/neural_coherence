1.1.1	I have a computer&lt; they call it a computer but i call it a piece of junk that i'm stuck to use:( I'm needing a cheap jump in performance out of my old computer here are the specs: Hp pavilion intel celeron processer 797MHz, 128 of RAM A guy tho was @ my house and he said that the computer ran faster than he expected as in the processer speed i have upgraded it from widows me to windows xp home edition so i ask for your help, please tell me what i can do to get this baby running faster plz!	Ques
1.2.1	Adding RAM is the first step.	St
1.2.2	Visit the HP site and find out the maximum that it will take and install it.	St
1.2.3	Replace the Hard Drive with a faster one.	St
1.2.4	Yours is probably a 5,400 RPM model, replace it with a 7,200 RPM drive.	St
1.2.5	If you get a Maxtor it will come with cloning software that will copy the existing drive to the new one.	St
1.2.6	If you have a second Hard Drive bay this is painless.	St
1.2.7	After you replace the drive the old one can be used for &quot;stuff&quot;.	St
1.2.8	Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software.	St
1.2.9	If you can remain calm, you just don't have all the facts.	St
1.3.1	You made a mistake going from Me to XP, as the OS itself needs more resource support and you can feel it.	St
1.3.2	Your best bet is to increase the ram as much as possible or what the HP can tolerate.	St
1.3.3	256mb is nice, but 512mb is the most desirable ram amount to have.	St
1.3.4	Check the HP specs as to what each ram slot supports.	St
1.3.5	If you're lucky, you can swap cpu and install a faster one.	St
1.3.6	Alot depends on the HP model, so check those specs, HP does provide this either for the model or model line and/or generic info to do so.	St

1.4.1	Depending on what you use that comp for... a new graphics card might boost performance	St
1.5.1	alright the largest performance boost you can give to a computer in a single part is the graphics card upgrading your memory would be very smart (XP decreased your performance over ME...sorry bud) i would suggest getting your memory up from 128MB to at least 256MB, if it will support 512MB (or even 1024MB) go for that if the best you can do is 384MB, still do it if the best you can do is 256MB, still do it 1GB is currently what most gaming PC's (Any credible gaming PC that is) use, or super fast 512MB RAM (but that is usually more common in overclocker machines) i would suggest the memory upgrade and the next step is graphics as for 5400RPM to 7200RPM it's pointless to worry about it, as it doesn't really improve performance 5400RPM is fast enough for average use and even light gaming a 7200RPM is what you want if your getting a new disk, but if you have a 5400RPM, just leave it now if it's a 4200RPM or slower, i'd consider an upgrade (mainly because 90% of disks that are 4200RPM are 10GB or smaller)	St
1.6.1	I think i'll upgrade that ram:)	St
1.7.1	the recommended minimum for XP is 256, although 512 would be better.	St
1.8.1	As ozos mentioned, the graphics.	St
1.8.2	If you don't know what you have, tell us what the model number is on your HP and perhaps it can be determined.	St
1.8.3	If you have integrated graphics you may also have an AGP slot for a video card to upgrade, or go to a PCI card to improve performance and gaming.	St
1.9.1	My computer is a Hp Pavilion XG843 its got intergrated everything basicly and can handle up to 512 ram i just bought one stick of 256 to add to its empty slot:\ i'm gonna get a new computer as soon as possible so i didn't feel like spending 160 bucks on some ram so i spent 80 at 4 all memory.com	St
1.10.1	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?dlc=en&lc=en&product=60596&lang=en&cc=us&docname=bph06430 released about the same time as my old HP box...except on the complete opposite end of the product line... you got zero AGP an 800MHZ Celeron 128MB of RAM (stock, i think yours is at?	St
1.10.2	384?)	St
1.10.3	yeah, i'd say it's time for a new PC...at least if your a &quot;power user&quot; of sorts... i'd stay away from machines in that thing's original price range...how about a DIY?	St
1.11.1	I've always thought RAM was the key to performance.	St
1.11.2	How do I find out more about my particular graphics card, and is it easy to upgrade?	St
1.11.3	I have an HP Pavilion a305w desktop running Win XP w/SP2.	St
1.11.4	I have a Xeon Celeron processor, 2.7MHz.	St
1.11.5	I have moderate computer skills, enough to install a second hard drive, but that's all I've done to it hardware-wise.	St
1.11.6	I have 256MB RAM, and would like to upgrade to 512MB.	St
1.11.7	Is there a website I can go to that gives specific (VERY specific) instructions on how to do that?	St
1.11.8	I stupidly bought a 512MB thingy that just plugs in, but when I opened the case I realized that that is the wrong kind for my PC.	St
1.11.9	I didn't know there were different kinds.	St
1.11.10	My PC uses one of those green cards for the RAM.	St
1.11.11	How do you add to THAT?	Ques
1.11.12	A whole new card?	St
1.11.13	I also use a program called Fast Defrag 2.0.	St
1.11.14	It indicates that my total physical memory is 247MB, and I have 37MB of free physical memory.	St
1.11.15	Plus, it also tells me I have 606MB of VIRTUAL memory, and 174MB free virtual memory.	St
1.11.16	That doesn't sound good to me!	St
1.11.17	What's the difference between physical and virtual memory?	St
1.11.18	Any advice and suggestions appreciated!	Ques
1.11.19	Ali	St
1.12.1	that I have a broadband satellite connection, so speed seems to be fine.	St
1.12.2	Before though, when I had a dial-up, my PC was incredibly slow!!	St
1.12.3	Ali	St
1.13.1	model.	St
1.13.2	Graphics &quot;card&quot; is same as Video &quot;card&quot;.	St
1.13.3	In your case, the system's video is from a chip mounted on the mobo.	St
1.13.4	Additionally you DO NOT hava a socket to intall an actual video CARD into.	St
1.13.5	You are in absolute good luck to get memory info.	St
1.13.6	Simply go to http://www.crucial.com enter the model number of your computer and they will tell you what type of memory it has and how much it can take.	St
1.13.7	If both of your memory slots have memory sticks in them, you may have to remove a smaller one and put a larger one [in memory capacity] in.	St
1.13.8	Get familiar with the HP website it provides a wealth of info about your computer [hp.com].	St
1.13.9	Vitual memory is where the system uses the hard drive as memory when it starts to run out of RAM [it is much slower].	St
1.13.10	Windows will always use as much RAM as it needs at any instant, so having a high percentage being used is not unusual [as long as it doesn't sit at 100% continuosly].	St
1.13.11	You actually have 256 MB of memory, however the onboard video is using some of that.	St
1.13.12	If you go to 512 MB, check to see in the BIOS, if then you could assign a litte more memory to the video &quot;card&quot;.	Sug
1.14.1	either a RIMM, DIMM or DDR 2 DIMM in addition a video card is a seperate controller for processing 3D objects in real time your computer uses an onboard solution, compared to a stand alone solution (onboard means it's on the main board, stand alone is a seperate card such as a GeForce FX 5900 Ultra, which is a stand alone AGP 8x card) you can add a video card, in the form of a PCI card as for RAM, you will just need whatever speed and type of RAM stick that your mainboard supports in addition to THAT the written information of your processor is way out of whack (just figured i'd correct you to help you out) Xeon is not a company, it's a seperate model from the same company that produces Celeron that company would be Intel and it's 2.7GHZ, not MHZ (if it were 2.7MHZ it'd be AMAZINGLY SLOW (1985 apple computers operate at around 1-2MHZ, modern desktops operate between 1.5 and 3.8GHZ)) Xeon is a professional grade server processor offereing from Intel, while Celeron is a consumer grade low-range to mid-range offering from Intel and it depends on what your doing to whether a graphics card is key to performance in gaming yes, the graphics card is king but in most applications the processor and memory are the best upgrades (memory not just capacity, but also timings and speed, and as far as processor goes, the more powerful = the better) then down the line from there would be hard-drives, but that's a rather pointless thing to fret over	St
