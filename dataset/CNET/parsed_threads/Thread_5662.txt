<s> I have an AMD Athlon 3200+ processor with a Soyo mobo. </s>
<s> I was playing with the BIOS settings and put the CPU FPS speed at 200MHz from 166 MHz and the CPU Ratio at 11. </s>
<s> Now my monitor doesn't display anything. </s>
<s> Has my graphics card died? </s>
<s> (I have a GeForce 5500)Has my RAM run into problems? </s>
<s> Did my processor die? </s>
<s> Is it a BIOS problem?? </s>
<s> ?What can I do to fix it?????? </s>
<s> Pre-overclock my CPU was running at a max of 56 C/132 F. Thanks for any help you may have; I've really done it this time. </s>
<s> to the defaults, to start over. </s>
<s> Be aware that as you increase the speed of the memory bus you also proportionately increase the 33 MHz PCI bus speed and the 66 MHz AGP bus. </s>
<s> Thus it is not easy to tell which device couldn't handle the speed change. </s>
<s> Most overclocking of the memory bus is done 1 MHz at a time and test the system for a while after each step. </s>
<s> 166 to 200 is simply one BIG step. </s>
<s> turn off your machine,take the battery out of your mobo,wait,then put it back.this will reset the board.... </s>
