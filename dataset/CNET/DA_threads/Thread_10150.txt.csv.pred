1.1.1	Hello there!	St
1.1.2	I just got a wireless router, and when i play a game and left it and go Away from Keyboard for the night I always disconnect cause the router is shutting itself off cause it thinks that i dont use the net anymore, so it shut itself off to save power and such.	St
1.1.3	Ive putted &quot;Idle Timeout&quot; to 0.	St
1.1.4	Heres the discription of idle timout: &quot;An idle Internet connection will be terminated after this time period.	St
1.1.5	If this value is zero (0), then the connection will be &quot;kept alive&quot; by re-connecting immediately whenever the connection is lost.&quot; But when it reconnect, ive already disconnected from the game.	St
1.1.6	So its useless.	St
1.1.7	I have oxo marked &quot;Connect automatically, as requied&quot; Heres what the connect automatically description says: &quot;Connect Automatically, as Required Normally, this option should be enabled.	St
1.1.8	An Internet connection will be made automatically after each timeout, whenever Internet-bound traffic is detected.	St
1.1.9	This provides connection on demand and is potentially cost-saving.	St
1.1.10	If disabled, you must connect manually, using the &quot;Connection Status&quot; button on the Router Status screen.	St
1.1.11	This manual connection will stay up all the time without timeouts.&quot; And yes, ive contacted my ISP and they said it wasnt any problems with their stuff and my modem.	St
1.1.12	But they said it was my router.	St
1.1.13	Iam using a NetGear RangeMax WPN824 v2.	St
1.2.1	I didn't check the version but I have firmware version V1.0_51 NA which helped a few items.	St
1.2.2	It does not shutoff like you note.	St
1.2.3	Ever.	St
1.2.4	I wonder if you are connecting with WIFI?	St
1.2.5	Try this.	St
1.2.6	WPA, SSID enabled and all other settings at stock save the item you noted.	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I got the newest firmware o_O Which is V2.0.10_1.2.17 SSID and WPA is enabled, it was enable before too.	St
1.4.1	If it is as you say it is, the router is broken.	St
1.4.2	Mine does not disconnect with the settings noted.	St
1.4.3	Your post is still light.	St
1.4.4	But that's good enough for me.	Polite
1.4.5	I won't ask if you are checking the router's status page to see if it's truly disconnected from the internet or it's just your machine... Bob	St
1.5.1	Iam really new at this stuff, so i really dunno.	St
1.5.2	I will go to the shop where i bought it and ask about the router.	St
1.5.3	The router is very new, i bought it with my laptop.	St
1.5.4	=X Account Name WPN824 Hardware Version V2H1 Firmware Version V2.0.10_1.2.17 Internet Port MAC Address 00:18:4D:8A:E3:CF IP Address XX.XX.XX.XXX DHCP PPPoE IP Subnet Mask XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX Domain Name Server	St
1.6.1	That's telling.	St
1.6.2	Some ISP's chop off users at set times.	St
1.6.3	Drives the users nuts.	St
1.6.4	Your ISP should tell you this but some won't.	Sug
1.6.5	Again, your status given looks fine.	St
1.6.6	What does it look like when the router (as you claim) has disconnected?	St
1.6.7	In closing, one member posted over a dozen posts before they revealed all the details.	St
1.6.8	The problem was an incompatible setup on their DSL modem.	St
1.6.9	Again, always the member's choice to share details.	St
1.6.10	Bob	St
1.7.1	I got ADSL, so i really dont want to get/have my net shutted off in some specific time.	St
1.7.2	Its really annoying.	St
1.7.3	And, i dunno how the router status looks like when the router DCs or disconnect.	St
1.7.4	I will try to check that out next time my router gets disconnected.	Sug
1.7.5	I hope i can fix it ASAP.	St
1.7.6	And Thanks for helping me R. Proffitt ^^ Still posting more information later when ive seen how the router status looks like when it gets disconnected.	St
1.7.7	Sorry my bad english	Polite
1.8.1	DSL, ADSL, etc is &quot;close enough&quot; at the level of discussion.	St
1.8.2	Let me be very blunt here so I apologize if it seems not well written.	St
1.8.3	You stated the router is doing the disconnect but didn't look at the router status page.	St
1.8.4	I have to guess you are looking at some LED or other indication or something else.	St
1.8.5	That scrap of detail is sorely needed to gain some traction on your issue.	St
1.8.6	So let be be even more blunt.	St
1.8.7	Nail it down.	St
1.8.8	When it's disconnected, look at the router's status page.	St
1.8.9	Also check that lease time.	Sug
1.8.10	It could be &quot;one of those ISP's&quot; that hand out 1 hour leases.	St
1.8.11	Sorry if it appears you have to become a network IT guru but it's tough to sort out without these items.	St
1.8.12	Hang in there!	St
1.8.13	-&gt; In closing there was a nice one the tech fixed recently.	St
1.8.14	The owner was on DSL and complained of similar after checking email.	St
1.8.15	It was the old setting in Outlook Express called &quot;Hang up after checking email.&quot; Bob	St
1.9.1	Ive tracked it and it seems not to disconnect anymore, and it might be the game i play.	St
1.9.2	Since the game servers are in california @USA.	St
1.9.3	And iam in Oslo @Norway.	St
1.9.4	But other ppls and my friends does not have that problem, so i wonder...Hmm	St
1.10.1	I putted the game on and went to sleep tonight, and when i woke up i got shocked.	St
1.10.2	The game hadnt disconnected.	St
1.10.3	But it was might luck.	St
1.10.4	I will try tonight too.	Sug
1.11.1	I caught the router shutting down, but this shutdown was for very long so i think its not like those other shutdowns i had before.	St
1.11.2	I unplugged my modem and the routers power to fix the net again, but heres the router status.	St
1.11.3	Router Status Account Name WPN824 Hardware Version V2H1 Firmware Version V2.0.10_1.2.17 Internet Port MAC Address 00:18:4D:8A:E3:CF IP Address 0.0.0.0 DHCP PPPoE IP Subnet Mask 0.0.0.0 Domain Name Server	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	Yes i do =o Its standing like..4-5meters from the router and the modem	St
1.14.1	the same frequencies as the routers.	St
1.14.2	You can try disconnecting the cordless phone to see if this stops you from disconnecting.	Sug
1.14.3	If the problem is gone, then you need to get a cordless phone that is 5gh.	St
1.14.4	Better yet, while you're connected, turn on the cordless phone and see if you get disconnected.	St
1.14.5	If you phone allows you to change it's channel, it may or may NOT help.	St
1.14.6	This is one of the big culprits.	St
1.14.7	The second one is, when you view the wireless networks in your area, do you see others?	St
1.14.8	What channel sre they using(right click and left click details)?	St
1.14.9	They may be using the same channel that you are or one close to yours.	St
1.14.10	Rick	St
1.15.1	I will try to check the phone, but i cant see others wireless ch.	St
1.15.2	I only see 3 other wireless stations (routers) but i cant see which ch their're using.	St
1.16.1	I'm not sure if this is related, but, under wireless settings you may try changing from &quot;108Mbps&quot; garb to &quot;both b and g&quot;, then changing to channel 1 or 11. these channels do not normally recieve interference from phones and whatnot.	St
1.16.2	Hope this helps	St
