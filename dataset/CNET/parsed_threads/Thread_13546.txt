<s> so I still havent bought my cpu, mobo or video card. </s>
<s> The more I keep reading the more ppl keep bringing up the 64bits that are scheduled to come out. </s>
<s> Anyone know the price range that these babies will be in when they come out? </s>
<s> I ask because if its something that will be in the $200-300 range for a cpu -then I will wait and get that but if they are going to be $500+ chips then id rather just spend the $200 and get my 3.0P4 now and think about going 64bit next year or later. </s>
<s> 64bit were out long time and they arent that expensive. </s>
<s> in fact they are cheaper than some p4s. </s>
<s> amd athlon 64 3000+ cost 153 bucks amd athlon 64 3200+ cost 190 bucks. </s>
<s> i think what ppl are talking about is dual cores not 64-bit. </s>
<s> AMD has had the Athlon 64 for an awful long time. </s>
<s> Intel came out with 64-bit (EM64T) in their 6xx series around February and Newegg along with other retailers have been selling them ever since: Click here: http://tinyurl.com/8vyuz </s>
<s> then im just in 'moron' phase and u can disregard is it worth going to 64bit ? </s>
<s> Your answer might be answered as time passes. </s>
<s> By December the 64-bit hammer may be in full swing as retailer shovel off the &quot;old&quot; 32-bit only offerings. </s>
<s> -&gt; Ask yourself if you are happy to run what there is today and not what may be in 64-bit next year. </s>

<s> Do not get a socket 754 type, they are old news. </s>

<s> Yes, since you are building new, the 64-bit is the wave of the future. </s>
<s> Nerdyboy mentioned Dual Core which also has the 64-bit support and is even newer. </s>
<s> Dual core provides two execution cores in one physical processor allowing the platform to do more in less time, performing multiple tasks with smooth interaction with your PC. </s>
<s> Intel currently has Dual Core: Pent D Processor 820, 2.8GHz = $241 Pent D Processor 830, 3.0GHz = $316 Pent D Processor 840, 3.2GHz = $530 in 1000 unit quantities The Dual Core Intel Pentium Processor Extreme Edition 3.2GHz, with motherboard, Intel D955X BKLKR, and 955X PCI-Express chipset with DDR2 is supposed to be $1050. </s>
<s> The AMD 64 Dual Core Processing family should be out by the end of September and is supposed to include models: 4800 Processor = $1000 4600 Processor = $803 4400 Processor = $581 4200 Processor = $537 respectively, in 1000 unit quantities </s>
