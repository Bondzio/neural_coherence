hp 4240n?
doesn't meet your requirements of footprint and wt.
but thousands of them (and earlier gen siblings) work everyday in thousands of offices around the world, including hp's down the peninsula from you.
support?
i had an hp technician helping me on the phone for 45 minutes troubleshooting a networked printer under warranty and when it appeared the machine was defective, hp offered free repair service at local qualified shops or a refurb replacement at the cost of shipping.
i chose the latter and it turned out to be a new machine.
is that bad or nonexistent support?
i don't think so.
