<s> I have a really old computer running a web-server. </s>
<s> This was my experiment with Linux, and it was successful. </s>
<s> This old computer is an Acer Aspire (1997). </s>
<s> Because this computer runs 24X7, I want to estimate its power consumption, to calculate how much I pay for the electricity it consumes. </s>
<s> The specs are: - Intel pentium MMX 166 MHz (Consumes 2.9 Watts, source: http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/prodbref/273209.htm ) - 72 MB SIMM RAM (two modules) - 1GB Fujitsu HDD 5200 RPM - Unknown motherboard (presume 1997 build) - No graphics accelerator - Network card: D-Link DFE 530TX+ - Startech 2-port PCI USB card (Never in use) - 8X CDROM drive (never in use) - 1.44 inch Floppy drive (never in use) - One processor fan - One Power supply fan - Monitor: 15 inch CRT monitor permanently turned off - One power indicator LED (green/orange) Can someone help me in getting a trustworthy estimate of power consumption of individual components? </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Try 80 watts for the box. </s>
<s> The only way to really tell is to measure it with a wattmeter but this is the number my old box consumed. </s>

<s> since this about power use I just looked in the book for my switch and it says the max power output is 80 watts is that allot of juice or not allot what I am worried about is that with it and the server my home power bill will jumps will 80 watts equal a huge diff in power bill. </s>
<s> If your switch consumed it's maximum of 80 watts and your power company charged 10 cents per kWh, you would pay about $6 for the energy it used if left on continuously. </s>
<s> Since most products are rated according to its load while being used, the components that you don't use will consume just a fraction of its rating. </s>
<s> The big consumers will be the motherboard and HDD. </s>
<s> The 80 watts given earlier for the box is probably a good estimate. </s>
<s> The monitor will not consume any power if turned completely off and not just in standby. </s>
<s> This document is not based on your exact specs, but might be a good guide for you: ftp://download.intel.com/support/desktopplatforms/communitypc/sb/motherboardpowerconsumption.pdf </s>
<s> Thanks, it solves my question. </s>
<s> The conclusion: Power consumption for this old PC is 80Watts, and it amounts to $6 per month of energy expenses. </s>
