<s> I have a Belking 64mb USB jump drive. </s>
<s> Has anyone ever compressed the data from within Windows Explorer to increase the size? </s>
<s> Is it possible? </s>
<s> I didn't want to try it if it might ruin the jump drive. </s>
<s> I don't use compression since zip, jpeg and such files are already compressed. </s>
<s> Just ZIP what you want that isn't in MP3, JPEG, and other compressed formats. </s>
