I have a HP dv6000 laptop.
It is almost 2 years old.
Since yesterday, the display has not been working.
Whenever I switch on the laptop, i can only see 'static', sort of like the image old tv's would show when the signal was lost.
I can hear the hard drive starting up, but there is nothing on the display...what should i do?
thanks
