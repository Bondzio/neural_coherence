i have had maxtor drives forever.
the last drive before this 160gb unit was a 40gb.
i was surprised that the new drive was way more noisy than the old one.
what happens is at times when the drive is doing an access i hear like a ''clunking'' sound.
at that time i get a ''pause''.
a couple of times it has done this-mostly when loading windows xp and it has paused for ''minutes''.
after looking into it i saw that the ide controller had defaulted to pio mode instead of the proper dma mode 6-which is correct for an ultra dma 133 unit.
i have read posts everywhere to try to see what is going on and i am convinced it is some sort of maxtor recent manufacturing problem.
what makes me angry is that the fact is most people these days have huge groups of files, and just changing out drive is way to time consuming.
w all know with windows xp it is worse becasue of the fact you must have the ''default'' ide controller drivers installed prior to swap or risk the blue screen of death.
in maximun pc magazine there has been recent informamtion on seagate problems as well.
my fear, and your case confirms it, is to get another drive and then go through it all over again!
