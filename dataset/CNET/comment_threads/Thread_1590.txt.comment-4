I have DSL with the modem hooked up to the first PC.
I have added a new PC (both are XPSP2) in an office in another building(same phone line).
I would like to connect to the Internet on the new PC and was told by ISP to use a router.
I bought a Linksys Etherfast Cable/DSL Routher with 4-Port Switch, but cannot get connected.
The phone line works, but as soon as I connect the phone cord from the filter that houses both phone and dsl, into the router, no phone and no connection.
When I manually set the IP address on the new PC it says connected but IE says not connected when I try different websites.
Any help would be so much appreciated!
