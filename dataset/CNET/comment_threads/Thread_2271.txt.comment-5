Interesting.
Glass is an insulator, but it does have a property (all materials do) called permitivity that could impact the capacitance of very closley spaced PCB tracks, at high frequencies.
Modern MBs are astounding, and really do push the limits of PCB design, a can see how a minor thing like this might impact the system's behaviour, but this is still a bit surprising.
