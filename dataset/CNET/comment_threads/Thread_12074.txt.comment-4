when using two routers to link multiple devices, would be to enable one as the DHCP server and disable DHCP on the other.
In this scenario the router connecting to the Internet is the DHCP server.
Many will trip over firewalls not set to allow LAN sharing.
When this happens, I will turn them off to verify sharing can happen and then reconfigure them.
