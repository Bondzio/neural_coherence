if you had a dvm you could do a continuity test across the mic plug with the switch in both positions.
a dead short during an attempted higher current output from the sound card's final amp stages just might damage it but i'm surprised they're not better protected.
as well, if you used a mono mic in a stereo jack that could have some strange effects.
you might be better off to disable that sound device in your bios and get an half way decent card.
