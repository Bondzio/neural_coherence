hi all, i'm currently running windows vista home premium 32-bit on an intel duo 2.2ghz with 2 gigs of ram.
i recently acquired a panasonic tx-26lxd50 tv, with the intention of using it as my primary monitor so i could play wow on a larger screen.
i've connected it via a scart to s-video cable.
the problem is that the setup for my graphics card (nvidia geforce 8400gs) informs me that i can't have a resolution higher than 1024x768 on the tv, which is rather blurry and not very easy on my eyes.
i've tried updating my graphics card driver (which did allow me to choose 1440x900 for my -smaller- monitor, but not the tv... i also tried using powerstrip to force a custom resolution, but if anything that's worsened the problem.
can anyone possibly help me to fix this, or even just inform me that what i want to do isn't possible and i just wasted money on a tv i don't need?
:p
