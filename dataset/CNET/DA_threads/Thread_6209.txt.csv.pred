1.1.1	I replaced the power supply in my computer .	St
1.1.2	Everything seemed good but , when I plug a thumb drive into either usb port on the front , they do n't work and , worse , they disable the mouse and keyboard so I have to do a hard shutdown .	St
1.1.3	Rebooting re-enables the mouse and keyboard until I try the front ports again .	St

1.3.1	If everything worked before then properly replacing the PSU should n't have caused a problem .	St
1.3.2	What I suspect is that either your mis-routed the USB harness or it became unseated/misaligned .	St
1.3.3	Inspect and verify your past work and do n't take anything for granted .	St
1.3.4	If in fact you did mis-route the harness , the damage may already be done and that USB hub is hosed .	St
1.3.5	That 's a physical damage item , though not seen , it 's damaged .	St
1.3.6	If you want to return USB access , install PCI card of USB with an int .	St
1.3.7	mounting for USB access for the frt..	St
1.3.8	I exclude any s/w issues , but again I find it hard to believe that the frt .	St
1.3.9	USB ports got whacked and not any other USB ports .	St
1.3.10	The reason the frt .	St
1.3.11	ports cause remaining USB issues , it that the USB calls for service become bogged down and are n't released fast enough , IMO .	St
1.3.12	Again related to possible hosed USB hub .	St
1.3.13	Follow the frt .	St
1.3.14	USB harness and reset the harness fully , several times .	St
1.3.15	If the problem persists then damaged hub .	St
