<s> HI all I am looking to build a desktop and is currently examining the various CPUs. </s>
<s> I have opted to go with AMDs as they are, in general, cheaper than Intel's counter parts. </s>
<s> (by core counts, quad-core AMD is generally cheaper than quad-core Intel). </s>
<s> So I am looking through the AMDs and noticed the Phenom and Athlon family. </s>
<s> I was just wondering which family is better? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Google up Tomshardware CPU CHARTS 2011 (or 2010) and put the CPUs you want up for comparison. </s>
<s> However with current Intel CPUs including hyperthreading with each core, you may be discounting them a little too soon. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> keeping track of amd's family is a moving question since they're always introducing something to compete in the low-mid range. </s>
<s> if you're not interested in high-end performance, just go by price since they're very competitive in their price range. </s>
<s> personally, i'd go with a phenom x4 to get the extra cores at only a little more cost and 90% of most users, they're more than sufficent. </s>

<s> Hi all, thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I went with the intel instead. </s>
<s> jzou, I don't know which AMD and Intel processors you considered, but figuring out what CPU to buy is probably the single most diffficult decision when you're building a PC. </s>
<s> Used to be, you could just look at the processor family (386, 486, etc.) </s>
<s> and speed, then look for a DX or SX suffix, and you had all the information you needed to compare parts. </s>
<s> These days, you need a good, up-to-date reference in order to know just how one processor compares to another. </s>
<s> While in the past I have favored AMD processors for the same reason you originally did -- lots of bang for the buck -- I'm no longer sure if AMD still offers a significant price advantage. </s>
<s> OTOH, unless you're building a computer for gaming, AutoCAD or Photoshop, almost any of today's common desktop processors will have more than enough power for your needs -- and even with those power-hungry apps, the video card is probably more important than the CPU. </s>
<s> I'm more concerned these days with the amount of power a CPU draws, how much heat it generates (those two go together), the amount of on-board cache, and in some cases whether it has onboard graphics; for general computing use, just about any mid-range processor is fast enough, and even some budget procs have plenty of oomph for most of the things my family does. </s>
<s> those are very important questions that unfortunately I didn't have a lot of time to research. </s>
<s> So I took a short cut instead. </s>
<s> I asked three different computer stores to recommend a setup for my given budget and went with the one that I liked. </s>
<s> Then I searched for the cheapest seller of each parts. </s>
