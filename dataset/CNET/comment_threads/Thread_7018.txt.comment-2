Can't be too bad.
I'm currently on a P4 a t 2.8Ghz (underclocked from 3.6ghz).
Looks like you have 1GB ram.
Should be fine as long as you're not playing the latest rpgs and fps at really high resolutions.
Your specs does not specify a graphics card, which may actually contribute more to your gaming experience.
