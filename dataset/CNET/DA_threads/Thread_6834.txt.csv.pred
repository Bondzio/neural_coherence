1.9.3	And why do you say that ?	Ques
1.9.4	I thought that this one would be fantastic with the huge RAM and HDD , processor speed and the supossedly & quot ; alright & quot ; graphics card ( According to some reviews I found ) Thanks again .	St
1.10.1	It 's not a company with reviews by the usual sites ( such as Cnet ) and is what you can find at mom and pop PC clone shops all over .	St
1.10.2	Yes , the parts are there but are you ready to figure out if they forget a driver or some other thing ?	Ques
1.10.3	For example many clone shops omit/forget Intel 's little Rapid Storage app and the owner suffers needlessly .	St

1.10.5	The final choice is yours but I would n't buy that .	St
