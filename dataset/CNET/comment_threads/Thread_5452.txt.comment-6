I did a clean windows install when I reformatted, don't have a chipset driver.
I did check for available bios updates, but the only one available was for the pc series I have, but not for the model itself (it mentioned 'specific for...'.
I've never had to reinstall those particular drivers before, so I might be missing something there.
How would I go about finding this information?
