So my questions are ,is there a way I can access the drive by just finding a similar pcb? Or am I going to have to find the same or similar pcb & swap & solder a chip from the donor to the dead pcb board? and last,I was looking @ something called cloning the broken pcb's ROM ?There is a guy on E-bay that claims it will work &quot;Dariusale HDD solutions&quot;I would appreciate any info on this topic Thank You for your time & Patience I'm @ a loss b/c there were no signs or problems b4 it went kaput, no odd sounds,beeps ,or clicking. I ran a diagnostic program(ontrack easy recovery) 2 try & get the data out (w/ the good pcb ) It spun up smoothly seemed perfect but ,failed the test saying it couldn't go thru w/ the test b/c of bad or errors or sectors or something 2 that effect.. Hopefully you can enlighten me . Thank you for your time & patience ,Angela MDL#:WD800-22JHAO 7200rpm 2 cache IDE caviar DATE:08NOV2004 DCM#:HSCANTJAH PCB#2061-001292-000 AD made in Thailand

I hope to.If I can find a match.& I did call DriveSavers & even W/ a 10% discount It would still cost from 1200-2400 just to swap out the PCB. What is cloning a boards ROM ? Is this a real thing? There is a guy in canada who says he can do this esp. w/ WD drives & he has an E-bay store called ''Dariusale HDD solutions''.Im a total newbie so forgive my ignorance,but is it really possible to clone a PCB's ROM?

Besides the equipment to do so can run past 4 figures. As to finding the PCB, I re-read your first post and you seem to claim you already did this. If not then you get on google.com and search for who sells said drive, or on ebay. You might even buy a complete machine that has the drive. You do the search... As to ebay data recovery. I wouldn't do that. I'd stick with the names such as Drive Savers or Ontrack. Best of luck, Bob
