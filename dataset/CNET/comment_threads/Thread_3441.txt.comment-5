Well, another look at Dell website.
This time I do a search on Dimension 3000 and it comes up with drivers for download.
However, in Audio section, the driver is not for Realtek AC97.
I wonder what can be the case.
Nevetheless, my trouble is pretty much solve.
My friend put in the recovery CD from Dell (which he got from another computer) and reinstall everything again.
Then somehow the drivers work.
(Now I don't understand what is the cause of my prior annoyance.
Oh well, guess that is what I get for not using a Mac. )
