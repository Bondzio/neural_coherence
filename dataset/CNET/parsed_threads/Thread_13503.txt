<s> I have a new HP laptop, 6633us and it works great. </s>
<s> But my modem seems to be shot. </s>
<s> Sigh. </s>
<s> SBC yahoo wants $80 for the 2wire, and $50 bucks for the regular modem. </s>
<s> They refuse to give me a new one since my warranty was only for one year. </s>
<s> Are there any cheap places to get a dsl modem? </s>
<s> I see on ebay says that it does not have a cable or phone port. </s>
<s> just ethernet ports. </s>
<s> ???? </s>
<s> do i need to get a 2wire that has phone port or do i need to get an additional piece of equipment? </s>
<s> The usuals. </s>
<s> Craigslist, Freecycle and ebay. </s>
<s> as long as it is the same type of dsl modem that at&t/sbc sells, do I have to check the serial number before buying? </s>
<s> the at&t/sbc rep told me to just buy a cheap one from best buy </s>
<s> Sorry to ask that. </s>
