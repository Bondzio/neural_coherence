Both the bios and DirectX Diagnostic say that there is 1GB RAM, so it is installed correctly. The thing is, the computer really doesn't seem faster. As far as page filing goes, the system is managing it. It says that the recommended is 1486MB while 1487MB is allocated! Why is a gig and a half allocated when I should have more than enough proper RAM? My processor speed is something like 1.8GHz and I have gotten rid of all but the required start up programs. It's so annoying when iTunes takes 25 seconds to load! Arrg! Any ideas? Alex M

If it is a Celeron or Sempron then you may have your computer needing more processing power which isn't the same as speed. The idea with more memory is that for memory-intensive tasks things may be done in shorter time. Generally I don't think it'll seem that much faster. As for the 1486 MB recommended allocation this is likely due to windows wanting 1.5 times the physical RAM which is common. I have 2 GB of RAM and windows recommends I have 3069 MB of virtual memory that just seems unnecessary to me so I have it set to 0. Regards, JB

The 1400 number is simply telling you how much hard drive space is being allocated for virtual memory. As far as normal running of XP not much improvement when one goes above 500 Mb. There are some specific areas where a little more will help. High level gamers know what they are.
