You gave the slim version of the details.
First, is it setup per our forum sticky?
Some enable AP ISOLATION, disable SSID, try MAC filters and end up with slow speeds.
Sometimes its the firmware in the router or someone is running P2P on the other connection.
The story is much too light here and I can't ask all the questions.
Let's let you tell more.
