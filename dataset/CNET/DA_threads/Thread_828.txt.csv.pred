1.1.1	Hi , Suddenly my previously reliable HP 950c printer has started giving me a & quot ; Fail to print & quot ; error message , followed by repeated printing of the top 1/4 of the page I wanted printed ( I have to unplug the power cord to make it stop ) printing page after page ) .	St
1.1.2	I unstalled it , removed drivers , HP software , deleted any mention of HP in the Registry .	St
1.1.3	Then , downloaded latest drivers from HP 's website and reinstalled .	St
1.1.4	STILL have problem .	St
1.1.5	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	Try cleaning up the temp files with something like CCLEANER .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Ran CC Cleaner with no luck .	St
1.3.2	I 'm about ready to throw it out the window !	St
1.4.1	If you get 2 years from a printer you 've done well .	St
1.4.2	I would open the window and do n't hit anything valuable with it .	St
1.4.3	I 'd write more but clues are slim .	St
1.4.4	About the last hurrah test would be to see if Linux prints ok on it .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 've had 6 years out of it and still prints fast and great .	St
1.5.2	It 's got to be a software issue as the part of the page it prints looks fine .	St
1.5.3	No Linux on my computer .	St
1.5.4	I think for giggles I 'll try a System Restore to before the problem began ...	St
1.6.1	I do n't install Linux but boot it from a LiveCD so I can test hardware outside of Windows .	St
1.6.2	If it does n't work outside and inside of Windows that 's a fine clue it 's gone .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	I still think this has something to do with a Windows Update conflict since I have n't installed anything else .	St
1.8.2	I ca n't believe it 's the printer , since it will print a & quot ; Windows XP Printer Test Page & quot ; perfectly when the printer is installed .	St
1.8.3	Everything else prints 1/4 page then the Failed to Print error box comes up .	St
1.8.4	I really like ( d ) the printer , but I do n't know if I like it enough to do a Reformat to fix the problem , and it 's sure not worth paying someone to troubleshoot this .	St
1.8.5	Has anyone else run into this problem with a HP printer ?	Ques
1.9.1	If you ca n't then look up HOW TO PERFORM A XP PARALLEL INSTALL and test from that .	St
1.9.2	Bob	St
1.10.1	1 .	St
1.10.2	Disk Cleanup .	St
1.10.3	2 .	St
1.10.4	Uninstall , reinstall printer and drivers .	St
1.10.5	3 .	St
1.10.6	Test on another PC .	St
1.10.7	4 .	St
1.10.8	Test with another printer .	St
1.10.9	5 .	St
1.10.10	Move to another USB port .	St
1.10.11	That last item is cruel .	St
1.10.12	One owner dismissed it and the tech came out , moved to another USB port .	St
1.10.13	Bill ?	Ques
1.10.14	$ 120 .	St
1.10.15	Go figure why people do n't try free advice .	Sug
1.10.16	Bob	St
1.11.1	# s 1 , 2 , and 3 ( GeekSquad also printed a Windows Printer Test Page ) .	St
1.11.2	I have no other printer to test .	St
1.11.3	I 'll try # 5	Sug
1.12.1	OK Bob , I owe $ 120 .	St
1.12.2	I had the printer connected to a USB hub , where it has worked fine for years .	St
1.12.3	I pluged the printer 's USB cable directly into the PC 's USB port , and bingo .	St
1.12.4	Why the hell did n't the techs at HP think of that !	St
1.12.5	THANK YOU !	St
1.12.6	!	St
1.13.1	Wish I had read this post before spending countless hours trying to make my laser printer work .	St
1.13.2	It was working and just stopped responding .	St
1.13.3	Tried almost everything to get it going again .	St
1.13.4	Computer would not recognize it at all , even after uninstall and reinstall on same port .	St
1.13.5	Not sure what made me finally try a different port on same computer but I was instantly back up and printing .	St
1.13.6	Sometimes , things just work out .	St
1.13.7	= ) Don	St
1.14.1	So does anyone know WHY changing the printer to another USB port works ?	Ques
1.14.2	If the port still works for other things is there a software fix that needs to be considered as well ?	Ques
1.14.3	Just curious as I have recently had the same experience .	St
1.15.1	It 's not supposed to matter .	St
1.15.2	The reality is that it often does .	St
1.15.3	Sorry but without a long discussion about USB and more ... and even then we only have a theory why yours did that .	St
1.15.4	Let 's go with a working printer anyday ... Bob	St
1.16.1	The thing that had me confused was that my computer was recognizing the printer and I could get it to print something from it .	St
1.16.2	Plus , everyone told me it must be the printer due to it 's age .	St
1.16.3	Glad I hung in there and tried one more post that Bob was kind enough to respond to .	St
1.16.4	Happy to hear yours was a happy ending as well !	St
