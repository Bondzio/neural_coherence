1.1.1	Just purchased a Netgear Wireless N-300 Router to use with an HP 311 netbook , equipped with a wireless N card and running Windows XP .	St
1.1.2	I also have a desktop with Windows XP , not that this matters as far as the router is concerned I 'm sure .	St
1.1.3	My question is did I purchase the right router to use with my HP , or should I have gone with the more expensive & quot ; RangeMax Dual Band Wireless N & quot ; router ?	Ques
1.1.4	Your help will be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.5	Note : The Best Buy people recommended the N-300 Router and seemed to think the Dual Band was overkill .	St
1.2.1	I have the simple wrn2000 here and some 3500 that I 'll switch to when time permits .	St
