This file contains all of the backups of my operating programs. The computer is a Windows XP and uses NERO Express to burn the DVD's. I tried to find something in NERO Express to allow the scheduleing and failed. I tried Microsoft Scheduled tasks and failed. I need some step by step suggestions. Bill

I have it, but I turned the Back-Up off, because it can automatically tell you to back-up after like a month or something. The only thing is if you use CDs and not DVDs that it takes like 5 of them.. Sorry, just an idea. -Ibrahim
