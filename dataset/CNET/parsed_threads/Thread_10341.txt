<s> From memory, HP had some software to wipe out the installed scanning software and drivers so you could reinstall it as if it was a new install. </s>
<s> They don't &quot;fix&quot; an error, but just wipe and reinstall. </s>
<s> Unplug the scanner and do the work. </s>

<s> &quot;I've tried reinstall but I didn't un plug.&quot; Why not? </s>
<s> I offered it as a clue to try. </s>
<s> &quot;Could you please explain the exact order of steps. </s>
<s> &quot; No, I give guidance and direction. </s>
<s> No &quot;steps.&quot; Steps are likely for paid support services. </s>
<s> &quot;Should I uninstall present software?&quot; In my first reply, I noted that. </s>
<s> Maybe I was unclear? </s>
<s> But hopefully this time you will unplug the scanner USB connection, look to an uninstall in Add/Remove, put in the CD add it as if it was new and see if it helps. </s>

<s> dear sir: I did exactly what you told me to do and in the presence of a technician. </s>
<s> I'm still at step one, that is in Windows ME I get msxml.dll not regestered whereas in X.P. </s>
<s> the scanner works ok. Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I even tried to install an update for msxml and the dialogue box said That it's already installed and it wouldn't let me install. </s>
<s> Your prior post did indicate you didn't follow my suggestions. </s>
<s> But it doesn't matter. </s>
<s> I also noted that HP often has a &quot;cleaner&quot; software to remove the traces of the scanner software so you can start over. </s>
<s> I leave it to you to find it. </s>
<s> Just FYI, again, this is just someone thats done this many times and doesn't get a dime for offering direction to the issue. </s>
<s> Sorry, no step by step. </s>
