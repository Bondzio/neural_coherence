The recommended resolution is to be at 1680x1050@60HZ. How do I get the monitor to go to 1680x1050. I can't figure this one out. I'm kind of dumb when it comes to computers. I'm trying to get better. Please help! Thxs, Cris

Select the Settings Tab and there will be a slider to adjust. If 1680x1050 is not available, you will need to supply the driver file with .INF extension found on a CD that came with the monitor.
