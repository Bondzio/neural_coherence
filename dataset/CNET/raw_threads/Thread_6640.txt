6080	0	577439	5383035	NR	Ryan309	11/9/12 6:33 PM	1.35248598E12	New PC	Here are the parts I was thinking of (Any suggestions are very welcome): Motherboard: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157330 Power Supply: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139022 Case: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139006 CPU: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116504 GPU: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103201 RAM: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233374 SSD: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227791 HDD: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136533 Optical Drive: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827118031 I have a few questions: Number 1 - I would definitely like help with that motherboard just to make sure I'm not missing out on anything or paying too much. I'm also wondering if new egg includes the instant savings for bundling the items right in the estimated total (it doesn't look like it but I can't be sure). Any knowledge is greatly appreciated (I'm looking to you Bob)

Suspect you can find the same functionality ....internal and external drives, fans, etc., without spending $189. RAM....the timings (latency) are higher (slower) than most DD3 1600....the DIMMs selected show 11-11-11-30 whereas most DDR3 1600 DIMMs are 9-9-9-24 and some are 8 -8-8- 24 or even 7. Bottomline, for $75 incl shiiping, I'd look for the highest rated 8GB (X2) or 4GB (X4) DIMMs rated at 9 or better and then pick the kit that gives you your total 16GB Here's a well rated 2 DIMM X 8GB kit with 8 latency (runs faster than 9 and 11) http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148561 Here's a well rated 2 DIMM X 8GB kit with 9 low latency (runs faster than 11) http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231568 Let us know what you ultimately choose and how it goes.

6080	3	577439	5383324	5383035	Ryan309	11/10/12 10:57 AM	1.35254502E12	New Parts	So I am now adding that Crucial RAM instead of the stuff I had before. I am also still wondering whether the 7970, GTX 670, or GTX 680 is the GPU I should get.... I want the best performance, but I am also wondering if PhysX and tech like that will still work with the AMD card? It's probably a dumb question, but hey I gotta ask.

Frankly I'm never done this in the past 2 years as I use the BEST VIDEO CARD FOR THE MONEY and go home. Link follows Bob http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html
