<s> I have a Canon PIXMA MP170 all in one printer/scanner/copier. </s>
<s> I bought it in 2005 installed it on my computer, Windows XP operating system and it worked fine. </s>
<s> I have a 200Gb hard drive with plenty of space, 1 Gb of ram, 2.4Mhz processor. </s>
<s> My computer crashed in March 2006. </s>
<s> I reinstalled all my software but the computer cannot find the scanner. </s>
<s> It has found the printer which works brilliantly. </s>
<s> I have deleted and reinstalled all the Canon software to no avail. </s>
<s> If I click on &quot;Start&quot; go to &quot;Control Panel&quot; then &quot;Scanners and cameras&quot; the scanner is not there. </s>
<s> If I click on &quot;Add device&quot; nothing happens. </s>
<s> I have rang the Canon help line, they downloaded the latest drivers and it still doesn't work. </s>
<s> The tech. </s>
<s> said it must be something to do with my operating system. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Thanks John </s>
<s> Install the latest motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Cheers Bob. </s>
<s> I'll give that a go tomorrow (Saturday) Kind regards John </s>
<s> Hi Bob, Tried that and I got lost. </s>
<s> I'm probably not doing something right. </s>
<s> My scanner works on another computer so it is definitely something on my computer. </s>
<s> It still doesn't recognise the scanner. </s>
<s> I have checked with Norton and it's nothing to do with the firewall or security system as it still was not recognised when they were turned off. </s>
<s> I'm now looking for remote assistance for someone to check my system through. </s>
<s> I did use CNET 24 once but I can't find it now. </s>
<s> Kind regards John </s>
<s> I'd need more clues to do more. </s>
<s> No make, model, specifics on the host PC make this a bit tough. </s>
<s> I didn't see a SP1 or SP2 listed so that's missing? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, I have SP2 I've just signed up to webex.com for remote assistance. </s>
<s> I'll let you know if they sort it. </s>
<s> Kind regards John </s>
<s> Something you might like to think about. </s>
<s> I have two HP printers one DJ350 and a 3in 1. </s>
<s> Both developed significant faults. </s>
<s> The 3in1 would not print in Word but would print a web page. </s>
<s> The DJ450 would not print in colour. </s>
<s> We tried everything but could not improve the situation. </s>
<s> Some months later we had to re-install Windows XP and lo and behold both printers worked perfectly. </s>
<s> I have no idea what the fault was but re-installing the printer software didn't improve the situation. </s>
<s> I have damaged my Canon Pixma MP170 installation CD and could do with a copy software or CD. </s>
<s> Can anyone help please? </s>
<s> Mike </s>
