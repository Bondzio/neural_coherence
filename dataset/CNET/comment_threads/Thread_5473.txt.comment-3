OK.
So right now I'm starting with a 1TB Seagate hard drive.
What you are saying is, when I am ready to add matching hard drives, I should buy an extra one to make a backup image, build the raid array, and then restore the image now on the raid array.
I guess then I could wipe the back up hard drive and take it back to the store for a refund.
This is a good idea and defiantly solves the problem of losing my data, but the process still isn't what I'm looking for.
Maybe I'm asking for too much but I just want an easy way to add hard drives to an array without having to rebuild the array or back up my data.
After all, one of the main advantages of using raid is that you don't need to make backups because you would have to have two or more hard drives fail at the same time before the array failed.
