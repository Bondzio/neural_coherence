1.1.1	First , let me say , I 'm very impressed with the knowledge of the members here .	St
1.1.2	Last weeks question about sharing files and printer between PCs prompted my own question .	St
1.1.3	I have a MAC G4 OS 10.2 hooked up to a HP SmartJet printer .	St
1.1.4	I also have a Fujitsu laptop PC running XP Pro .	St
1.1.5	They 're both on a Linksys wireless network .	St
1.1.6	My question is does anyone know if it 's possible to share files and the printer between the MAC and my laptop .	Ques
1.1.7	If so , how would I go about doing that ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Hi Rhender105 , Yes it is possible to setup file sharing between the 2 over your network .	St
1.2.2	Windows isnt very & quot ; friendly & quot ; with non-windows computers so your non-windows computers have to trick windows into thinking its just another windows pc .	St
1.2.3	The way this is done is via Samba .	St
1.2.4	Samba is used in Linux and MacOSX environments to allow sharing of files .	St
1.2.5	I dont have the exact instructions for MacOSX but I 'm sure Apple 's website provides good information about it ( I 've seen it there somewhere before ) .	St
1.2.6	I may not be a MacOSX user currently but I use Linux ( which both run off Unix environment ) and they use a lot of the same technics and programs .	St
1.2.7	Hope this helps !	St
1.3.1	Select a folder to share on the XP machine , say My Documents , and share it .	St
1.3.2	Go to the Mac and & quot ; connect to server & quot ; and you should see the XP machine there .	St
1.3.3	Double click , enter the username of the XP user and the password and it should just connect .	St
1.3.4	I connect to a W2K machine with no problem .	St
1.3.5	Hope this helps too P	St

1.4.16	Rickey	St
1.5.1	using the Disk Utility in the Applications/Utilities folder .	St
1.5.2	That 's a start .	St
1.5.3	Disk Warrior is a must have for Mac users .	St
1.5.4	It is a directory rebuilder .	St
1.5.5	Download Onyx and run the routines in that .	St
1.5.6	In a worst cast scenario , a Clean Archive and Install will replace the system with a new one and save all your data and settings .	St
1.5.7	Do NOT start deleting things you do not recognize P	St
