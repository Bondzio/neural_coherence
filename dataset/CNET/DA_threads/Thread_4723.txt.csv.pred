1.1.1	I have recently acquired an older Slot 1 Intel Pentium II motherboard, and included in the box was a power button.	St
1.1.2	This power button has four holes on it.	St
1.1.3	That is where the trouble is.	St
1.1.4	The motherboard has a two pin power button connector.	St
1.1.5	My question is, how do I connect this power button to this motherboard?	St
1.1.6	Are there any adapters out there that I can use for it?	Ques
1.1.7	Or am I out of luck?	St
1.1.8	I have to buy a new case for it, will I get a two pin power button?	St
1.1.9	Thank you in advance for any answers.	St
1.2.1	Is it an alternate action type which are used with an AT type system??	St
1.2.2	Or is it a momentary contact type switch as used with ATX type systems.	St
1.2.3	Possibly you have one of the mobos that could take either AT or ATX type power supplies, and one had to set which in the BIOS.	St
1.2.4	These had two sets of power connectors on the mobo.	St
1.2.5	Most AT systems used a power switch with four pins.	St
1.2.6	The switch controlled the AC power via a bundle of wires from the power supply.	St
1.2.7	It was alternate action, push once, it stays in and the switch contacts stay closed to allow AC power to the power supply.	St
1.2.8	Push again the contacts open.	St
1.2.9	In the ATX type the contact is only a momentary one and the logic on the mobo actually turns the power supply on.	St
1.2.10	With ATX there is no 120 volt leads inside the case itself.	St
1.3.1	All I know is that the switch doesn't stay in when I push it.	St
1.3.2	And, it isn't connected to the power supply.	St
1.3.3	Does that help	St
1.4.1	Is there an adapter that I could use for it so that I could use the switch safely with the mobo?	St
1.4.2	There are two red wires and two white wires coming from the switch into the connector.	St
1.5.1	had an ohmeter.	St
1.5.2	It seems that the switch is a two pole switch.	St
1.5.3	Most likely one red and one white wire is for one switch and the other pair for the second switch.	St
1.5.4	The switch simply closes the connection between the two pins on the mobo, thus it is not polarity sensitive, matters not which wire goes to which of the two pins on the mobo.	St
1.6.1	And I don't have an ohmeter.	St
1.6.2	How would I do that, if I did have one?	Ques
1.7.1	4 wires used in pairs thus only possibilities; both reds call them A and B, both Whites call them C and D. Thus due to fact that polarity of the two wires is not of interest, simply try the combinations AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD.	St
1.7.2	If it is an ATX mobo, trying each combo will not hurt anything, If there is actualy two separate switches inside the body [2 poles], two of the combinations should work.	St
1.8.1	AC, AD, or BC?	St
1.8.2	I would need extra wire, right?	St
1.9.1	were already on the switch.	St
1.9.2	Do the wires have the &quot;connector&quot; on the end that slips onto the pins on the mobo??	St
1.9.3	For a simple test just put the switch near the mobo pins, strip the insulation off is necessary, remove the present wires connected to the two pins.	St
1.9.4	Then touch one wire to each pin.	St
1.9.5	There is not voltage there that can even tingle you.	St
1.9.6	Might be a little tricky holding the wires connected and pushing the button.	St
1.9.7	Maybe a second person would help.	St
1.9.8	What type of switch is presently on the case and why can't you use that???	St
1.9.9	Or the wires from that???	St
1.9.10	I guess that I should have asked this question first.	St
1.10.1	If you are buying a new case for an ATX type mobo it certasinly will have the two wire momentary contact switch.	St
1.10.2	I am still trying to determine if the mobo is an AT type, an ATX type or one that can either be AT or ATX powered.	St
1.10.3	AT and ATX are type for both mobos and Power supplies.	St
1.10.4	The connectors for the power from an AT type supply are actually two connectors placed adjacent to each other such that when the power supply connectors are plugged in, at first glance they appear to be one connector.	St
1.10.5	If the mobo was one that took either, there would also be a single 20 pin connector located next to the two 10 pin connectors.	St
1.10.6	Until I am certain as to the mobo configuration, I can't be certain that my answers are valid.	St
1.11.1	This is my brother's computer when i get a case for it, so I don't really want to strip any wires, or anything destructive for that matter.	St
1.12.1	One large 20 pin ATX connector.	St
1.12.2	no AT connectors.	St
1.13.1	I don't have one.	St
1.13.2	Hopefully I can get a cheap or free ATX case with 8 expansion slots.	St
1.13.3	where could I get one with that many expansion slots?	St
1.13.4	Everywhere I looked (even eBay) only had 7 slot cases for ATX, or 12 for AT, which I don't have, and don't expect to have another one (used to have a Pitney-Bowes 386) for a long while.	St
1.14.1	NIL	St
1.15.1	It'll have its own wired power connector whose wires will reach the correct place when the mobo is installed.	St
1.15.2	So why play with the four wire switch???	Sug
1.15.3	If you have an ATX supply and that mobo, simply put them on a table with cardboard under the mobo, plug the power supply in to the 120 VAC line, plug the 20 pin connector from the supply into the mobo.	St
1.15.4	[no need for CPU, memory or anything else, just the mobo and PS] Take the blade of a small slot [metal blade] screwdriver and momentarily short the two mobo pins for the power switch together [momentarily].	St
1.15.5	The power supply should turn on as evidenced by its fan running.	St
1.15.6	To turn it off short the two pins together ago, for this you may need to keep them connected for 4 to 5 seconds.	St
1.15.7	[depends on the Pwr Mgt settings in the BIOS, which you don't know at this time].	St
1.15.8	Why 8 expansion slots all of one type????	St
1.15.9	Sounds way overkill unless you are including 5 1/2, and 3 1/2.	St
1.15.10	If you really need that many get an ATX server case.	St
1.15.11	Big, heavy, and not too cheap, lighter in aluminum but higher cost.	St
1.15.12	You also need a pretty high wattage power supply if you plan to occupy 8 drive slots.	St
1.16.1	That means that I can use any case!	St
1.16.2	YAY!	St
1.16.3	!	St
1.17.1	Do not get a Micro ATX case.	St
1.18.1	but it has an AGP slot, 4 PCI slots, and 3 ISA slots.	St
1.18.2	Every case that I have seen, as huge as they may be, consistently have 7 expansion slots.	St
1.18.3	but I need a cheap case because I am a bit short of cash.	St
1.19.1	Why no MicroATX cases?	St
1.20.1	also some of the narrow MATX cases one's will only take a MicroATX supply and then one is very limitied on power supplies power to choose from.	St
1.20.2	Yes that mobo and sytem may never be a big power consumer, but get a case for the future.	St
