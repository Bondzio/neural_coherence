hi there.
i am also in this business, and in the market for a high quality, high volume printer.
i am thinking the xerox phaser 8560 is the way to go, but i have a question - does it print full bleed?
i do mostly custom size prints, 4.25 x 5.5. also, what does this compare to, in card stock weight - 60 220 gsm?
i saw it goes up to 80 lbs, but is 220 gsm heavier than that?
thanks!
!
