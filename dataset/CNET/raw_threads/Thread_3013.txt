1755	0	52372	624484	NR	Beamerlover	12/20/04 9:27 PM	1.10357802E12	Adding Memory	I currently have a Compaq Presario 6420nx - specs: OP Sys - Win XP; processor - AMD Athlon XP2200+ 1.8 GHz; Memory - 256 MB DDR SDRAM; Hard drive 80gb + 120gb (added). I would like to add another 256 mem stick. Does the new stick have to match the current system (2100) or can it be a 2700? Thanks

I am not sure what the price difference is between those two. but I would recommend spending a little more for higher speed, so you can use that for the future as well. in two years, you probably dump that 2100 bcus it would be so outdated. you will still be able to keep the 2700 in two years though. you can check out WhoSave.com, maybe they list some 2700 on sale.
