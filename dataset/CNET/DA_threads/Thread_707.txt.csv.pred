1.1.1	Hi there, I had a HP laptop die on me last week (not a huge surprise considering age, use and the fact that that line of Pavilions had a tendency to overheat) but I was hoping to use the HD as an external HD for my other laptops and desktop.	St
1.1.2	I'd also like to retrieve the few files I hadn't backed up (some downloaded mp3's and a few Word docs).	St
1.1.3	I'm wondering though, since I can't boot the laptop to reformat the hard drive, is there going to be a problem with an already formatted master HD being plugged into one of my other computers as an external HD.	St
1.1.4	If so, is there a way to pull the files from the HD and reformat before building the external HD?	St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Purchase an external drive case (I recommend a USB-2 connection) and an adapter for the laptop drive.	St
1.2.2	Your choice on the case, here's the adapter cable, big bucks.	St
