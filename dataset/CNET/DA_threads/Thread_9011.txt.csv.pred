1.1.1	I just got a Seagate FreeAgent Pro 500GB external hard drive .	St
1.1.2	I was excited about it because it has an eSATA port , and so does my mobo .	St
1.1.3	So thinking I 'd finally get to utilized my computer 's eSATA capabilities and that backing things up would be so much quicker , I spent the extra money on the drive and an eSATA cable ( drive did n't come with one ) .	St
1.1.4	I got everything up and running and started to transfer some stuff to the drive , but it seemed to me the transfers were going a lot slower than they should .	St
1.1.5	After all , eSATA boasts speeds of 3GB/s .	St
1.1.6	So I downloaded a little app called HD Tune to test my transfer rates , and here 's what I got : with eSATA connected - 20.5MB/s burst with USB2.0 connected - 25.6MB/s burst What the hell is going on here ?	Ques
1.1.7	Not only is the eSATA not moving very fast , but the USB is actually faster than it !	St
1.1.8	The only thought I had is that either my computer does n't have it 's eSATA configured correctly , or I bought a bum eSATA cable .	St
1.1.9	Here is the cable I bought : http : //www.amazon.com/36IN-Esata-Signal-Cable-7PIN/dp/B000IAJZ76/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-1416624-5455203 ? ie=UTF8 & s=electronics & qid=1178737372 & sr=8-1 and here is a link to my mobo info : http : //www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Reviews/p5wd2/ Does anyone know what might be going on ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //www.sata-io.org/esata.asp	St
1.3.1	just noticed your mobo has eSATA port .	St
1.3.2	Have you flashed latest BIOS and installed all mobo drivers , incl .	St
1.3.3	RAID SATA driver ?	Ques
1.4.1	Yeah I just flashed the latest BIOS and the Sata drivers have n't been updated in 2 years according to the asus downloads page , so I have all those .	St
1.4.2	Seems odd that the mobo would have an eSATA port just because , and not actually have it working to eSATA standards	St
1.5.1	the Disk Drive Policies to 'Optimize for Performance ' and 'Enable write caching on the disk ' in XP Device Manager .	St
1.5.2	If set as such , DO N'T hot-plug/unplug or you risk losing data .	St
1.5.3	Also partition the disk as extended and format the logical drive in NTFS for better security and data integrity .	St
1.6.1	Something fishy is going on .	St
1.6.2	In addition to my onboard SATA II 3.0 Gbps ports , I am using a Promise SATA150 TX4 PCI adapter , which only has a 1.5 Gbps transfer rate ( long story why I am using the old controller , so I wo n't go into it ) .	St
1.6.3	I attached two drives to this adapter : a Seagate 320 GB ST3320620AS SATA II 7200.10 internal drive , and the Seagate FreeAgent Pro 500 GB drive via an eSata back panel adapter .	St
1.6.4	I am using Linux on a Core 2 Quad Q6600 system , so raw power is not likely to be a limiting factor .	St
1.6.5	I first noticed the speed differential when I ran a large copy ( 31 GB ) to each drive .	St
1.6.6	The FreeAgent drive was a LOT slower , IIRC , 23 minutes vs 10 minutes .	St
1.6.7	I then ran timings , with all OS buffering disabled , using the Linux hdparm utility .	St
1.6.8	I decided that I would time the transfer rate from the disk on-board cache , to factor out variations .	St
1.6.9	The command I used was hdparm -- direct -T /dev/sdX I was very disturbed to see that the FreeAgent Pro consistently did read transfers about 46 % slower than the 320 GB drive - ON THE SAME CONTROLLER .	St
1.6.10	Specifically , about 86 MB/s for the 320GB and about 68 MB/s for the FreeAgent Pro .	St
1.6.11	Now this is supposed to be reading directly from the drive 's cache , which should return the maximum transfer rate of the drive electronics , regardless of the disk 's mechanical characteristics .	St
1.6.12	Just for comparison , I ran the same command for the same 320 GB model , but on a SATA II 3.0 Gb/s on-board internal port .	St
1.6.13	The transfer rate for that was 200 MB/s ! !	St
1.6.14	I have not tried the FreeAgent Pro on a SATA II port , but I suspect it will not fare a lot better .	St
1.6.15	Finally , I ran some diagnostics on the drives , and the FreeAgent Pro does not have NCQ ( the 320 GB model does ) .	St
1.6.16	I do n't know if this would make a significant difference .	St
1.6.17	It *is* a SATA II 3.0 Gbps drive , so that 's not the issue .	St
1.6.18	One way or another , I am sorely disappointed and am going to return the drive .	St
1.6.19	Pity - it is pretty looking , and big , but why is it so slow ?	Ques
1.6.20	I am wondering if Seagate decided to save on costs and is using the same ( slow ) back-end circuitry for both the USB 2.0 and eSATA connectors ?	Ques
1.6.21	Maybe their marketing people thought it was a good selling point to include eSATA , but who uses eSATA anyway ?	Ques
1.6.22	By the time enough people were actually using eSATA to notice , they would have brought out a new model that really does run at SATA II speeds .	St
1.6.23	Maybe I am just being too cynical .	St
1.7.1	I 'm just going to have to live with this BS , since it 's too late to return it now .	St
1.7.2	Could you explain to me how you set it up so that it 's doing 68mb/s ?	Ques
1.7.3	even that is better than what I 'm getting right now .	St
1.7.4	all I know is seagate just lost a customer	St
1.8.1	While this might seem obvious to some people , others might go & quot ; What ?	Ques
1.8.2	That could make a difference ? & quot ; Are you leaving the drive connected to the USB port , while you 're trying to use the eSATA connection ?	Ques
1.8.3	If so , it might be defaulting to the slower connection , or somesuch .	St
1.8.4	If you 've already tried only connecting one port at a time , then I do n't know what else to try .	St
1.8.5	This might be in the same category of questions as & quot ; is it plugged in & quot ; , but I can see how someone might not think of this as a potential issue .	St
1.9.1	The problem may be with your external hard drive .	St
1.9.2	First , be sure you have your Operating system up to date with the latest updates , latest bios update , etc , and check to see if your system recognizes the sata mode of the drive .	St
1.9.3	I would also think that the file systems should match , HTFS file system of your computer to HTFS file system of your External hard drive , not sure if this would make any difference , but it may .	St
1.9.4	I have a WD my book and am debating switching from USB 2.0 to eSATA .	St
1.10.1	A standard drive with some electronics to have USB and eSATA ports ?	Ques
1.10.2	Or a SATA drive with some electronics to add a USB port ?	Ques
1.10.3	http : //asia.cnet.com/reviews/pcperipherals/accessories/0,39053287,40574900p-2,00.htm did n't test the eSATA speed , but they 'expect ' it to be much higher .	St
1.10.4	http : //www.pcworld.com/article/id,129566/article.html notes 80 seconds for 3 Gb of files and folders in eSATA mode , but does n't mention USB speed .	St
1.10.5	And just a bunch of files is n't the best speed test imaginable , of course .	St
1.10.6	Anyway , you 've got a perfect point when returning it .	St
1.10.7	The product data sheet on their website ( http : //www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/external/freeagent_pro_data_movers/ ) just mentions the theoretical maximum ( 480 Mb/s for USB , 3 Gb/s for eSata ) under the heading & quot ; performance spec & quot ; .	St
1.10.8	They surely ca n't deliver that , so whatever it is , it 's not a performance spec , as your measurements show .	St
1.10.9	Hope you find the problem , however .	St
1.10.10	It 's a nice looking drive .	St
1.10.11	Kees	St
1.11.1	I bought this drive from Dell , and their policy is 21 days or less for a return .	St
1.11.2	It 's been much longer than that , so I do n't really think I have any recourse .	St
1.11.3	Just stuck with a mediocre drive that sucked me in because it was flashy .	St
1.12.1	I have a via sata card and a 500gb free agent drive and my sata port is the slowest thing on earth .	St
1.12.2	I returened the first one cause it was crashing and stoped working , and the new one is slow and basically comes to a hault almost for a long while before it finishes .	St
1.13.1	I had the same problem before .	St
1.13.2	I upgraded the firmware using http : //support.seagate.com/rightnow/downloads/FA_Pro_eSATA_Update.zip and it helped a bunch .	St
1.13.3	Now I get 40MB/s average and 79MB/s burst rates ( as per HD Tune ) .	St
1.13.4	Make sure you follow all the steps given in the PDF .	Sug
1.13.5	Also , I had to turn off the drive for like 30sec before re-using it after the upgrade .	St
1.13.6	Any other solution around ?	Ques
1.14.1	I 'll give the firmware upgrade a try , thanks for posting it .	Polite
1.14.2	Hopefully it will do something positive .	St
1.15.1	I have the same problem with my Seagate FreeAgent Pro 750GB eSATA drive .	St
1.15.2	After 2 hours on phone with level 2 support ( half of the time I was on hold ) ... the stupid level 2 support rep. suggested that I go out and buy a eSATA controller and not use the one that 's built onto my motherboard ( Asus A8R32-MVP Deluxe ) .	St
1.15.3	I asked him about the firmware upgrade and he said that it probably would not help and I should take his advice and buy a dedicated eSATA controller and give support a call back if I am still experiencing the same issue .	St
1.15.4	I told him he 's an idiot and hung up on him .	St
1.15.5	Anyways ... my FreeAgent 's firmware is currently at 40.0A .	St
1.15.6	What 's the new firmware version ?	Ques
1.15.7	And what transfer rates are you getting with it ?	Ques
1.16.1	should your source data be also on a SATA ?	Ques
1.17.1	I upgraded the firmware like you did , and now it 's getting gaster speeds , but not as fast as you 've put down .	St
1.17.2	I only get like 42mb/s burst	St
1.18.1	what 's the new firmware version ? ?	Ques
1.18.2	i have yet to upgrade because it will only work on an xp machine ... i have vista installed .	St
1.18.3	i 'm trying to get my hands on an xp machine ... but want to know if the firmware upgrade is higher than 40.0A .	St
1.19.1	My 79MB/s burst and 40MB/s average was from the FreeAgent to my Western Digital 120GB IDE HDD .	St
1.19.2	I do believe you would need to work from a SATA drive to get the full speed ( 300MB/s ) .	St
1.19.3	When I get some time I 'll try to use an older IDE drive on a SATA converter and see if it improves anything .	St
1.19.4	I do believe the max speed for IDE is 133 as opposed to 300 for the SATA , but my guess is most of the slow speed problem comes from the conversion from one standard to the other .	St
1.19.5	If anybody has tried that already ( or simply has a SATA drive ) , please let me know ! !	St
1.19.6	!	St
1.20.1	Is n't that an update for your SATA drivers ?	Ques
1.20.2	http : //dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/Driver/SATA/SiliconImage/SATA_SiliconImage_V10190_V32.zip Check the content of that link before installing anything .	St
1.20.3	I found it by looking up drivers for the P5WD2 on support.asus.com .	St
1.21.1	Hi , I just got the 750 ... and this eSATA cable I bought from Frys is a total piece of crap .	St
1.21.2	I have to really push hard for it to actually stay connected ... with HDTune I was getting about 50Mb/sec initially but again with having to hold the connector in is NOT the way to go for me .	St
1.21.3	Can you tell me where did *ALL OF YOU* get your eSATA cables that WORK ?	Ques
1.21.4	( Online links would be handy ) I dont want to have to make a dozen trips to different computer stores to try out eSATA cables ...	St
1.22.1	My internal drive is a Seagate 300gb sata drive .	St
1.22.2	So that shouldnt make a difference .	St
1.23.1	Just do a search of eSATA cable .	St
1.23.2	Frankly I 'm wondering if my cable is maybe the problem .	St
1.23.3	I 'm not really sure how or why there would be different types of eSATA cables , but it could be .	St
1.23.4	I just got one that was a good price and looked decent , but it had no packaging that described anything really .	St
1.24.1	Ok ... so after talking on the phone with Seagate ... they said not to use the eSATA to internal sata bracket .	St
1.24.2	There 's some weird stuff they can not account for with that bracket .	St
1.24.3	If you want to achieve the drive 's full potential ... you will need to get a true eSATA controller .	St
1.24.4	I did n't like that answer ... but I caved and went out to my local Fry 's and got a PCI Express x1 eSATA controller ( SI3132 chipset ) .	St
1.24.5	Sure enough ... it worked out for me .	St
1.24.6	I had a Foxconn 6150B motherboard and was using a bracket .	St
1.24.7	I was getting 30MB/sec sustained transfer rate and the drive was erroring out after waking my computer up from sleep .	St
1.24.8	Connected it to the PCI Express x2 eSATA controller ...	St
1.24.9	I get a sustained transfer rate of about 49 MB/sec and it works just fine after waking up from sleep .	St
1.25.1	Same here .	St
1.25.2	got it on Amazon .	St
1.26.1	Out of curiosity , would you guys mind posting your internal hard drives speeds so we can compare ?	Ques
1.26.2	Please use HD Tune so we start from a common basis and list your internal hard drive type ( IDE , SATA , magnetic tape ? !	St
1.26.3	) , average speed and burst speed and same for your FreeAgent .	St
1.26.4	Because after messing around with my FreeAgent on a SATA to eSATA bracket , I get : 45MB/s average , 82MB/s burst .	St
1.26.5	My IDE drive gives me : 52MB/s average , 91MB/s burst .	St
1.26.6	I also ran HD Tune on a laptop ( VAIO with Intel T5500 , 1GB RAM , 80GB HDD ) and got : 32MB/s average , 92MB/s burst .	St
1.26.7	Not really sure it 's comparable since I do n't really know how laptops work .	St

1.29.1	I just bought FreeAgent Pro 750GB USB/1394/eSata unit yesterday , looking forward to faster backups and faster large file transfer .	St
1.29.2	I do some video editing and 3 - 10 GB files are not unusual .	St
1.29.3	My primary interest was eSata - USB2 and FireWire are ok , but ... ...	St
1.29.4	This thing flat out sucks .	St
1.29.5	I read these postings , tried the firmware upgrade , and no joy .	St
1.29.6	See www.precise.ca/esata for test results .	St
1.29.7	I thought after the firmware upgrade it started to look pretty good , but then tried my real world test - transfer 2 large .avi totalling 3.3 GB .	St
1.29.8	Took 2:22 on USB2 ; 2:04 on FireWire , and an astounding 12 minutes and 44 saeconds with eSata ... ... that 's after the firmware upgrade .	St
1.29.9	I was so puzzled I ran HD Tune again , and totally different results - 2.5 MB/sec min , max , avg AND burst .	St
1.29.10	I do n't know where to begin to look at this point .	St
1.29.11	System is a 4 year old Shuttle SB65G2 with on board sata support - I have a 160GB Seagate Sata as my main ( and only ) harddrive in the box .	St
1.29.12	I 'm connecting to the FreeAgent with one of those adapter dealies that connects to the Sata connector on the main board and out through the case to an eSata connector .	St
1.29.13	Drive seems to work ok , and seems to be recognized , but sloooooowwwwww .	St
1.29.14	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.29.15	Thx ... ..Randy	St
1.30.1	http : //stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/07/11/hardware-problems-my-esata -- sata-ii-enclosure-wont-play.aspx In this link , he mentions that with an internal SATA port , the mere act of adding a SATA to eSATA bracket and second cable can be enough to reduce the SATA signal strength to a point where SATA II ( 3 GB/s ) speeds can not be achieved .	St
1.30.2	He jumpered his drive to SATA I ( 1.5 GB/s ) and that made a big difference .	St
1.30.3	This explains why buying a separate eSATA adapter works better .	St
1.30.4	It 's apparently not Seagate 's fault at all ( the drive in the above article is a WD ) .	St
1.30.5	It seems that the onboard SATA connectors often just do n't have enough grunt to drive the bracket/second cable properly .	St
1.30.6	I wonder if anyone makes a bracket that has a built-in signal booster ?	Ques
1.31.1	But I 'm not sure if this applies to me or not .	St
1.31.2	My computer has an eSATA jack built directly into the motherboard that I plugged my drive into .	St
1.31.3	So I do n't know if that makes a difference ?	Ques
1.31.4	I 'm a bit confused figuring out exactly what you mean .	St
1.32.1	I seem to be having the same issues as everyone ( slow ) ... but I notice some interesting things..first my & quot ; supported features & quot ; on HD Tune seem very sparse : Checked : SMART 48-bit Address Write Cache Power Management Un Checked : & lt ; everything else ! & gt ; Second , it says my Buffer is 0KB .. is that right ?	Ques
1.32.2	By the way , my situation is I have the 500G FreeAgent Pro and I 'm using a new eSATA adapter card ( pcie - & gt ; eSATA ) by SIIG and an eSATA I-Type cable by i dot Connect ( which seems like its in there firmly ) .	St

1.34.1	I do n't think it 's eSATA per se ; I think it 's Seagate problem .	St
1.34.2	I bought one of the 320GB pro , the esata portion did not even work .	St
1.34.3	Needless to say , the thing went back for a refund the next day .	St
1.35.1	Sad Seagate would n't put out a better , higher performance solution .	St
1.35.2	My Adaptec eSATA/USB2.0 with the WD HDD worked very very well .	St
1.35.3	Adaptec 's enclosures have worked well across the boad ... .would have been nice if they had used active cooling .	St
1.35.4	I bought one of the Antec MX-1 ... appears to be a great product..but only time will tell when I put it to use .	St

1.36.2	Perhaps with so many people having the same issues Seagate will take notice and do something about their crappy products .	St
1.36.3	I never expected this thread to be so popular , but I 'm glad it is .	St
1.37.1	I bought the same drive but my motherboard does not have an esata port .	St
1.37.2	I had to also buy an esata bracket and cable .	St
1.37.3	I connected the esata bracket to the internal sata ports .	St
1.37.4	It was very quirky .	St
1.37.5	Sometimes it would work and other times it would completely lock up my system .	St
1.37.6	I tried using the USB connection and that worked fine .	St
1.37.7	But I purchased an esata drive specifically for the speed .	St
1.37.8	I returned the drive to buy.com where I purchased it .	St
1.37.9	I 'm still waiting for a refund .	St
1.37.10	The drive was to be used exclusively for system backup .	St
1.37.11	In the meantime I purchased a WD internal 500G hard drive for backup .	St
