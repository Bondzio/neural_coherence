hi, my laptop is toshiba satellite basic model m55 s135, i want to watch video in my laptop on the tv screen, i am not sure what is wrong, but when i connected the s-video cable to the tv and my laptop, the tv screen only shows blank dark with absolutely no sound or image, although i can watch video on my laptop with no problem, but i want it connect to tv and watch in a big screen , can anyone tell me what the peoblem is?
do i need to purchase a external device such as graphic card or video card or something to make it work???
thanks
