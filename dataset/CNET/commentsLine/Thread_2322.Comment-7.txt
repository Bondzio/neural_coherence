all you need is the dvd burner, since it will do everything and save $22.
you can add it later.
if you do get both, make the burner the primary.
your link for the hd is a 200gb with a limit of one, but it is a good drive.
you could get one drive now and add the other one later.
here is another hd option.
i assume that you are into gaming by the video card you choose.
if not you could save money there.
all in all a good system.
by droping the dvd rom and the second hd will save $120, and you can allwise add them later.
