<s> Ive got an external hard drive that I use as a secondary storage. </s>
<s> For some reason when I go to look for my music files and Videos on my hard drive the files are hidden and not accessible. </s>
<s> I have my options set to view hidden files but yet it still is not viewable. </s>
<s> When I go to copy the contents from my desktop hard drive back to the external hard drive, it tells me that the folder and files are already there. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how to fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any all the help that can be provided. </s>

<s> At http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=243631&messageID=2463540 I note another file browser that shows such without Explorer's issues. </s>

<s> Once you find the folder you might be able to rename it with Gyula. </s>

<s> Explorer (windows) can give us the wrong error message. </s>
<s> For instance I've seen the error message &quot;Can't create folder xxyxx&quot; when there was no folder on the external drive. </s>
<s> A little sleuthing and we found out the external drive was in a FAT32 format which didn't support the directory or filenames in the directory. </s>
<s> The error message was incorrect. </s>
<s> Go figure if that bug would ever be fixed. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> Bob, I checked my external Hard drive and it is configured as NTFS. </s>
<s> I also downloaded Gyula and that didn't show the files. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks for all of your help so far. </s>
<s> We copy the files we need to save out then remove the partition and start over. </s>
