Right now, I have 3 computers and 1 printer hooked up via ethernet cable to the router. My laptop uses the wireless capability. So all ports are used. I am buying an external hardrive to be shared by all the computers and it will be hooked up to the router via ethernet so I am going to be short 1 port on the router. Do I need a router with extra ports, or can I somehow combine the new external hard drive's ethernet cable with one of the existing computer's so they share a router port? If I need a new router with extra ports, can you kindly recommend one for me? All I've come across are 4 port routers. Thanks

But a 5 port will be about $20 or less with rebate. Unplug one of the ports in your router and plug the swtich in, then plug the other stuff into the switch. John

By far the easiest, cheapest, way to extend the number of ethernet ports on your router. On any given Sunday, you can browse the sales circular from Best Buy to Staples and buy a switch for under $20! You'll love it!
