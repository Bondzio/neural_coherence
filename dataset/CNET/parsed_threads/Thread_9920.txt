<s> Hello, I have a PS/2 optical Logitech mouse that works in Linux (Ubuntu 8.04), but not in Windows (XP Pro SP2). </s>
<s> It's plugged in when I start the computer, so what's the deal? </s>
<s> I've attempted the following to get it to work: *Check Device Manager: no yellow or red devices *Try to use &quot;Add Hardware&quot; - it found nothing *Tried to use &quot;Add Hardware&quot; manually - no mouse in the selection Suggestions on getting the thing to work? </s>
<s> It's slightly annoying when using some programs to not have a mouse. </s>
<s> The logitech mouse driver it can cause that. </s>
<s> More at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256233 and there is a XP version of the article but I'll let you dig it out. </s>

<s> No, I haven't used the Logitech drivers, it was a mouse I received from a friend after my last mouse stopped working consistently (I think it had a short in the wire). </s>
<s> I just shut the computer down, plugged the mouse in, and turned the computer on. </s>
<s> I can't remember, but I think the first time, or first couple times, the mouse may have worked in Windows ... though maybe not. </s>
<s> Aside from Logitech drivers, any other suggestions? </s>
<s> The same filters can be installed by spyware and other maker's drivers. </s>
<s> It's a common failure and unless the PS2 port or mouse is dead which your Linux test shows it's not then this is the registry tree I check then I delete that and the files it points to. </s>
<s> I consider this just above average user repairs so not everyone survives this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So ... </s>
<s> I booted back into Windows today, expecting the PS/2 mouse not to work, or my wireless mouse to work (dead battery, I thought). </s>
<s> To my surprise, they both work, and I haven't done anything to actually fix the situation. </s>
<s> But hey, I'm not complaining. </s>
<s> Just figured I'd let you all know that this computer is magical, or something. </s>
<s> That, and that it works again. </s>
