thank you.the reason i own such a high end system with a mid range video card is cause i just bought the computer and upgraded the vid card a bit when i bought it as it origionally came with the x300se and im a casual gamer so i dont need too much also i was waiting for direct x 10 so i didnt want to break the bank twice in a 4 month period
