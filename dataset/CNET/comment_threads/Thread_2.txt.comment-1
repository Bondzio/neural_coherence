Hey, I have setup a Static IP address through Windows XP, and I am trying to forward ports to my Xbox 360 (to avoid Strict NAT settings).
The problem right now is that I cannot access my routers set up page.
I am using a D-Link WBR-2310, which is not installed on the PC, but runs a password-protected wireless network.
I have run IPconfig, and have obtained the IP address and Default Gateway.
When I type either in my Web Browser (tried Firefox/IE) I am led to my DSL modem's setup page and not my wireless router.
I have tried every IP address possible (from the default router address to the IPconfig) and I cannot access my wireless router setup.
Through the D-Link website, I have also tried to use an emulator, but I am unable to make any changed regarding Port Forwarding.
Once again, my wireless router is not installed, and the installation is not working because &quot;The router is not detected- Error 322&quot; I have been trying to solve this problem for the past 4 hours with no luck so I would appreciate any help!
Thanks in advance
