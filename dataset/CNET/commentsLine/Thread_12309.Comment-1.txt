hi all, i own 3 80gb drives (model - st380011a) purchased at different times, due to some problems in the smps one of the drive had burnt one of the ic on the circuitry and now i can not access the drive completely.
my office it ppl suggested to remove the burnt circuit and put the circuit of a working drive and try booting the drive again.. i tried but the drive did not detect.
however i could find that the platter is rotating freely (from the sound).
so i guess the head and internals of the drive are fine.
can anyone help me with that.
let me know if you require more details.
looking out passionately for a response.
thank you in advance, kritz.
