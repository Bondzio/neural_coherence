<s> I am looking at used Workstations. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Looking at the Dells specifically. </s>
<s> I will install hard drive, more ram or OS if necessary. </s>
<s> Any recommendations on workstations versus building one myself. </s>
<s> I don't plan on using it for gaming, video editing or design. </s>
<s> Only want it for web surfing and home office use. </s>
<s> Why not look at freecycle and the free area of craig's list if you as inclined to low to zero cost machines? </s>

<s> I am looking at workstation computers only. </s>
<s> Doesn't Dell use different hardware for the workstations versus the home pc? </s>
<s> If Lenovo or IBM has used workstation desktops, I wouldn't discount one of them either. </s>
<s> are work stations, but complete. </s>
<s> Unless you want what we used to call a dumb terminal? </s>
<s> Don't know where you can get one of them. </s>
<s> But the IBMs are complete machines. </s>
<s> No need to add anything at all. </s>
<s> Unless you just want to go to the trouble of installing hardware, an OS, digging for drivers, and spending hours on this. </s>
<s> Me, I'll take a complete working machine any day, especially at that price. </s>
<s> Good luck on your hunt for a dumb terminal. </s>
<s> a workstation (even used/refurb'd) is definitely overkill. </s>
<s> workstations usually use more expensive CPUs and ram (any may have professional graphics card with certified open-gl support) and they won't do diddly for your intended use. </s>
<s> i suggest you look into a desktop from any major brand that has core i3 or i5 for $600 and save yourself money and get a full warranty. </s>
<s> any new core i5 based desktop will be faster than a two or three year old workstation. </s>
