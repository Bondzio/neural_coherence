1.1.1	I have an Acer laptop I recently purchased.	St
1.1.2	I know it has built-in storage capabilities but whenever I attempt to download anything to store, a message appears saying that I must insert a CD.	St
1.1.3	Why won't the unit simply use it's built-in storage?	St
1.1.4	What kind of CD must I buy?	St
1.1.5	I bought the unit mostly for surfing the web but once in a while, I find an interesting article or image that I want to save.	St
1.1.6	I am not computer savvy so I am probably doing something wrong.	St
1.2.1	You don't tell what browser you use (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, to name the 4 most common), so I can't be specific about HOW to do what you must do.	St
1.2.2	But I can tell you WHAT to do in your browser.	St
1.2.3	And that's setting the default folder to store the downloaded files to something else than the CD-drive.	St
1.2.4	Some people download everyting to the desktop.	St
1.2.5	Others prefer to have a dedicated folder on the hard disk.	St
1.2.6	It's your own choice.	St
1.2.7	But a CD-drive is rather unpractical indeed.	St
1.2.8	If I were you, I should change that setting.	St
1.2.9	Kees	St
