Proffitt	11/29/12 1:40 PM	1.3541964E12	Clarification request: Did you read Microsoft's answer?	http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-hardware/will-windows-8-support-windows-7-external-dvd/33fc109c-b7ce-40ed-82f7-6ec258acba24?msgId=b37dd510-576e-4713-9cad-7c72bf985393 Looks like the usual drives will be fine. There will be folk that will overpay for units that are &quot;on the list.&quot; But why would we need this? It's not like we could install software from such. Bob

Here's the problems you face. 1. There's no DVD or Blu-Ray playback codecs/capabilities included with Windows 8 RT, and (currently) no add-on ones. 2. You can't install software, drivers or such from said drive. Hope you are getting the message fast that RT may stand for Restricted Tablet. Bob
