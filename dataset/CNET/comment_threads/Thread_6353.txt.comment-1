Hello, I just burned a DVD (with a bunch of pictures) on my PC, then put the DVD into my Mac G4.
Mac won't open it.
It won't recognize it.
Then I put another DVD with some files on it, also burned on my PC.
Same thing.
When I put a picture CD (from Ritz Camera) it opens it just fine.
When I put a DVD movie it opens it fine.
Is it possible that this problem comes from the fact that these DVDs were burned on the PC?
Thanks a lot!
Exp.
