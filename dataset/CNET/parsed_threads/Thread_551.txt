<s> I would like to get rid of my house land line since it seems to be hardly ever used with all the kids and myself having cell phones. </s>
<s> My only issue is occationally I need the land line to dial up a modem at work to connect to a computer that is not on any type of network. </s>
<s> Is it possible to use my DSL internet connection to connect with this modem and still leave the modem connected for dial up functionality? </s>
<s> We did such as a dial up server years ago. </s>
<s> Here's the setup. </s>
<s> We placed another machine (a PC) at a location with dial up connections. </s>
<s> We then would run VNC (see google!) </s>
<s> to that machine and do the dial up from that machine with our machine controlling the remote PC. </s>
<s> As you can imagine the setup is fairly technical but proved it could be done. </s>
