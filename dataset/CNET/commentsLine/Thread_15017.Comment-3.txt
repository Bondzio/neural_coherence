i have the same problem with an ipod nano connected to the usb port.
the message arises even if the ipod is not connected and only the cable is connected.
i am using windows xp home.
the port on the back is used for a printer and another port on the front is used for a blue tooth device.
they function ok. when the &quot;power surge&quot; message appears the curser for the bluetooth mouse is frozen.
anyone familiar with this problem?
