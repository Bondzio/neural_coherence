<s> hp pavillion, windows me, 30 gb hard drive suddenly shows only 28 gb capacity, can i get back the 2 gb that are lost? </s>
<s> &quot;So this same 30 GB hard disk is 30,000 MB in decimal terms. </s>
<s> But its 27.94 binary gigabytes are equal to 28,610 binary megabytes (27.94 times 1,024).&quot; http://keppanet.netfirms.com/keppanet/supports/harddisk.htm Nothing to fix here. </s>
<s> It's something that takes awhile to sink in. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Robert didn't quite fill in the full calculation If you see 28GB you need to do this calculation 28*1024*1024*1024 That equals 30GB, exactly what you are supposed to have. </s>
