My Vaio T9550 has a 500gb SATA data drive which is almost empty plus a 45gb SSD system drive which is almost full. Can I transfer any of the larger programs from the system drive to the vast emptiness of the storage drive? Or do I just have to keep deleting decent programs from the SSD drive as it fills up?? Thanks!

You uninstall and then re-install them to the other drive. -&gt; But that's not why I wrote. Some folk &quot;delete&quot; rather than uninstall and the forums find the question &quot;Why didn't that work?&quot; Bob

I'll try uninstalling from the SSD what can be downloaded and reinstalled on the SATA drive, but I'm not sure that'll free up too much space... If I have to upgrade to a bigger SSD drive, what pitfalls should I look out for? Any particular drives you'd recommend?

Though not really meant for Win XP, it does what its supposed to do. I have been using it quite a bit. Just make a copy of the Program Folder P2BMvd (Program to be Moved) on another drive, run COA2. Rename the original folder as, say &quot;Copy of P2BMvd&quot;, just to be safe! I have moved a large variety of Programs from the Program Files on C drive to other Drives and have not had an need to undo the change. I delete the &quot;Copy ....&quot; after a few days. Ramesh

It's not free - $15 - but a whole lot cheaper than a new hard drive. http://www.funduc.com/app_mover.htm
