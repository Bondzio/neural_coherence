it will help you get a better perspective on value and performance.
just keep in mind every $$ you spend on an agp gpu could be going toward a new system with room to grow, a warranty, etc.,  vapcmd ps...re the 128mbs vs 512mbs ram ... that's part of it but i'm under the impression lots of ram with a whimpy gpu chip just doesn't make it fast or materially faster.
i take from that performance has as much or more to do with the gpu chip itself.
