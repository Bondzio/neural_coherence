<s> Hi i have a problem with my pc it will switch on but will not fully boot up. </s>
<s> when it is switched on it just sticks on a grey screen and stays there. </s>
<s> sometimes it will go the whole way but other times i have to end up pressing the button to try again.it won't even boot in safe mode. </s>
<s> i recently have just been putting it in stnd by mode but we had a power cut the other day and it shut the pc down while it was on.when i tried to boot it up it was running through all the files and saying file segment unreadable.i called my local computor shop and he cant fix it,he has now formatted my pc and put window 7 on and it works fine but now i dont have any of the software i used to have like power cinema, blue soliell,microsoft office 2000, outlook express,my wireless drivers dont work either.It runs great and boots up fine but all my stuff has gone.can anyone help </s>
<s> I read where you install Windows 7, and it works. </s>
<s> However your post makes me think this is your first Windows install. </s>
<s> That is, drivers and more are not automatically found and installed. </s>
<s> Same for applications. </s>
<s> About your stuff. </s>
<s> Has anyone talked to you about backing up your stuff? </s>

<s> Hi Thanks Bob Yeah i have backed up my photos and videos and music but since the guy put windows seven on i cant run my power cinema which runs my Tv card and also my blue soleill ( blu tooth) which runs also my wireless card.is there anyway a can get these drivers to run on windows 7. or ideally i would prefer to fix the initial boot up problems and run my pc on xp again.My pc is an Advent T12 </s>
<s> Sounds like someone needs to find drivers and apps for what hardware you have. </s>
<s> Sometimes you can't find such things. </s>
<s> What I'd like to hear more about is blue soleil. </s>
<s> As an author of some mobile apps that use blue tooth, the microsoft stack is more than good enough for blue tooth work. </s>
<s> And with those sub 5 buck usb bluetooth adapters there is little reason to keep an old incompatible adapter. </s>
<s> Just to cover more ground, if you are asking members to do driver hunts, you must ask for that and supply every scrap of detail about that card or thing. </s>
