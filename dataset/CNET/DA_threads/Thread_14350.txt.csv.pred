1.1.1	Hi All , I need to use an ericsson 4425 VOIP phone over a Cisco Switched network .	St
1.1.2	The switch i 'm presently testing with is a catalyst 3550. i have created an access and a voice vlan for data and voice respectively ... on the switch access port .	St
1.1.3	Although the traffic from the voip phone could have straightaway gone into the voice vlan in case of cisco phone ... with Ericsson , it does n't seem to be happening that way .	St
1.1.4	The voip phone still takes an ip from the access VLAN DHCP .	St
1.1.5	pls suggest the ideal way to segreggate traffic into voice and access VLANs at the ingress switchport .	Sug
1.2.1	I have the same problem Help , plis !	St
1.3.1	Changing the port that the new phone is in to the vlan for voice may help .	St
