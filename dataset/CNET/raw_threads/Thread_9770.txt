That computer is running XP Pro and it is a Dell. The funny thing is....that it works on that computer under my coworkers usernames, just not mine. It recognizes the drive (a message pops up saying that the USB port is not high-speed), but when I go to my computer, the drive is not listed. Are there settings that I can change? Help!

You have to &quot;pitch in&quot; on this discussion and not only supply the &quot;we dont have norton...&quot;, but tell what you have. You can imagine we only have 20 questions to use and then I have to give up what you do have. Please help the forum help you out. As to TWEAKUI. Please look it up on Google.com and look at the Drives tab to see if it's unchecked. Bob
