Where can I procure the screen component for replacement. I am an electronic tech of 30 years but I do not know of a source for this. Any ideas? Thank you, Mike Crosby

But it seems very well possible to me that the price of a spare screen for a unit that was sold from 2004 is much more than the current price of a comparable unit. Better check before you order. Kees

Google for model# and see if so-so has anything and of course the full cost. If the LCD is real old and/or at least 3yrs. old, I would consider it a lost unless you really got to have it. In most cases a LCD subassy.(alone) or if used, maybe the whole assy. the cost varies. Buying a new 19in. LCD, especially now during this Xmas time, there has to be a decent deal out there, well worth the checking out. Of course, there is eBay too just find a F1903 out there. BTW, the HP F1503 and F1903 were part of a bad series of LCDs that had poor componets used and caused failure. So, the parts got used/repaired often and/or these bad LCDs were sold, so verify it is a working model component/LCD. tada -----Willy
