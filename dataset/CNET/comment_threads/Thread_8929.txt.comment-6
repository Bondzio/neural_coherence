&quot;What about if the router is not fully utilised by me?
For example, the router is connected to 20 people, so I'd get 1/20 of the bandwith.&quot; You get a portion of the unused bandwidth.
If no one is using the internet, you get 100% of that.
It appears you are very new at this and need to get out there and watch what happens.
