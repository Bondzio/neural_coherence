3651	0	341183	3035729	NR	hoaxey	5/1/09 4:56 AM	1.24115376E12	Booting up problem	I have just taken a hard drive from out a slower machine and put into my older but more powerful system but the when the pc loads it just hangs at the 1st screen after it has detected primary master (the new ide drive) and goes up to secondary master (the cd drive), Its says press del to enter setup or alt-f4 to continue but i cant get anything to happen-i noticed at this point there are no lights on the keyboard, but they do light up quicky on initial power on. I know the keyboard is fine cos im using the same one now. Any help would be gratefully appreciated-thanks very much.
