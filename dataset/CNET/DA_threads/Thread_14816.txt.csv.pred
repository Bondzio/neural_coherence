1.1.1	Hi, I have 2 linksys wireless routers, a WRT300N and an old BEFW11S4.	St
1.1.2	I do not get good signal with the WRT300N even when I'm just a couple rooms away.	St
1.1.3	I was wondering if it would be possible to connect the old router to the new one so I would be able to have 2 wireless access points in my house.	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	We got it covered at about post 18 in this forum's sticky post.	St
1.2.2	Yes you can!	St
1.3.1	Thank you so much!	St
1.3.2	I was looking everywhere for an answer.	St
