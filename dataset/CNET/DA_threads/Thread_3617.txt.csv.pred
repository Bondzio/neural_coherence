1.2.1	You need a wireless card in your desktop PC.	St
1.2.2	You need to network the laptop and desktop.	St
1.2.3	By this, I mean get them connected via the wireless devices.	St
1.2.4	Once this is working, you can configure ICS (internet connection sharing).	St
1.2.5	Your desktop hosts the internet connection.	St
1.2.6	A call from the laptop to the desktop can initiate the dial up process.	St
