1.1.1	I have replaced my video card ( ATI 1800X Wonder Card ) with the new Radeon 3870 .	St
1.1.2	I have tried using the Wonder card for video capture only but it seems to conflict with the primary 3870 .	St
1.1.3	It gives me 2 extra displays , but I do n't need them and disabled those displays .	St
1.1.4	ATI Tech Support said it does n't support the 1800X anymore so I can not get any advice from them .	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know how to set up the two cards to work in the same machine .	St
1.1.6	They are both PCIx .	St
1.1.7	I hesitate buying a new video capture card when the 1800 model is also a video capture card .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	But you 'll have to use a current OS like XP with SP2 , latest BIOS , motherboard drivers etc .	St

1.3.1	I will double check again but I installed the new Asus Magnus motherboard , that has just been released , so I believed it has the most recent BIOS update .	St

1.3.3	Also have XP with SP2 and keep up with all updates .	St
