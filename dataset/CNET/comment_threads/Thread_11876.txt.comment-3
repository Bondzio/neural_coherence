the other 'RETAIL', then another difference is product warranty.
Warranty on OEM products is from the retailer/seller and is usually whatever the retailer/seller provides ...30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc.,.
On the otherhand, retail boxed CPUs whether Intel or AMD, usually have 3 year warranties from the manufacturer.
My recommendation, get a retail boxed CPU which gives you the HS fan and the longer 'manufacturer-backed' warranty.
