5504	2	160944	1786426	1785787	bigdaddya	3/3/06 3:59 PM	1.14140154E12	electronic workings	nope electronics design experience question though double sided doesnt necessarily mean chips sides ram stick mean stick chips side could double sided way works words way tell stick memory double singled sided looking
5504	3	160944	1786457	1786426	R. Proffitt	3/3/06 4:16 PM	1.14140256E12	yup pretty	thats why use places crucialcom keep track models memory sticks sort those things stick fits mean compatible bob
5504	4	160944	1786597	1786457	bigdaddya	3/3/06 5:20 PM	1.1414064E12	thanks lot	thanks time youve probably saved big headache trying figure why memory chip looks double sided isnt working system glitters gold chips sides dimm doesnt necessarily double sided memory

Proffitt	3/3/06 7:19 PM	1.14141354E12	thing	run mostly many year old machines specifically those old workhouses based lx bx xx chipsets chipsets many memory select lines quite often where dance around find right memory sticks fairly robust machines rarely died explains why run often pny those store memory sticks usually double sided usual mb sticks ones rarely work why sticks made purely lowest price work most systems little tough keep trying bob
