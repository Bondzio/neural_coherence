i clean out my fans quite often so i dont think it is a cleaning issue.
the main thing that bugs me though is that it seems that the laptop is using the one fan too an extreme when its not necessary.
what happens is i leave my laptop for 10 minutes, when i comeback the one fan is roaring while the other does nothing, but if i dont leave my laptop and am constantly browsing the web or typing neither fan is really blowing.
once the fan starts going it goes on and off until i shut down or restart my computer.
my bios is up to date.
my laptop is an alienware m17x r3 with i7quad core and radeon 6990 hd graphics card
