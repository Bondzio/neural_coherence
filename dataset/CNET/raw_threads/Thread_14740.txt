My router isnt recognizing my 360. When I first bought the router the two worked fine. For some reason it stopped. I called Microsoft and they tell me that its the router. I called Netgear for tech support and Im told that I have to pay for that support. Im not. Could anyone help me reconnect? Pleeeaase!

I went through the set-up procedures that Netgear provided. I have tried to look for some type of installed program offline helper but there isn't one.

But I did have to add a wifi client or wifi &quot;bridge&quot; to my 360 and configure that. For the official xbox 360 wifi thing there are screens on the 360 you go to, to set the wifi network you want to use, etc. I don't duplicate web content on that but here's a page about the official wifi thing -&gt; http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360wirelessnetadapter/default.htm Here's a video about setting that up -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCGorxtSqbM Bob
