So I do all my research and perform this properly, but my system is reading my new processor as an Athlon 1.15Ghz. Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought it should be somewhere around 1.9 - 2.1 Ghz? Do have to do the Flash Bios thing?

Someone on the board should have the correct settings, but I can't recall them (the settings, that is) off the top of my head.
