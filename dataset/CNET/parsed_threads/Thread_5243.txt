<s> I have a XPS Gen 4. </s>
<s> I have one gig of ram memory (250 hard drive) and since my son has lots of games on it I'd like to purchase more memory. </s>
<s> Of course he says I should buy Geil or Cosair-extreme memory. </s>
<s> Here are two choices I found. </s>
<s> Any advise...

<s> I have a WDC WD2500JD-75HBCO (233 gb)hard drive in there now. </s>
<s> It says that there is 229 gb (182gb-80% free space)NTFS I don't think that more hard disk space is nessasary with all that free space. </s>
<s> Running XP Home He has these games on. </s>
<s> Desert Combat Battle Field 2 Call of Duty 2 Postal 2 Delta Force Black Hawlk Down I have a NVIDIA Ge Force 6800. </s>
<s> The system gets slow some times when he is doing online gaming etc. </s>
<s> I thought that the extra memory to juggle with might help. </s>
<s> I don't really know anything about computers so maybe I'm wrong. </s>
<s> for the games listed, you might see some improvement with more ram but tweaking may help more. </s>
<s> for example, battlefield 2 can consume &gt;1gb on its own but you can reduce ram usage and stuttering by setting texture quality to medium. </s>
<s> http://www.tweakguides.com/BF2_3.html http://www.tweakguides.com/COD2_3.html http://www.tweakguides.com/JointOps_3.html also make sure you defrag your hd and use a fixed page file (1.1x your fixed ram) since content fetches are typically the cause of stuttering. </s>
<s> 2gb will be the power-user setting when vista debuts early next year, so if you plan to keep the pc for 18+ months, a ram upgrade may be more worthwile. </s>
<s> but if you plan to get a new pc in 2007, tweak what you've got. </s>
<s> While a nice video card there are much faster now. </s>
<s> It's only my opinion that 1GB is plenty for today. </s>
<s> About your hard disk. </s>
