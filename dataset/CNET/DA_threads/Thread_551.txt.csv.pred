1.1.1	I would like to get rid of my house land line since it seems to be hardly ever used with all the kids and myself having cell phones .	St
1.1.2	My only issue is occationally I need the land line to dial up a modem at work to connect to a computer that is not on any type of network .	St
1.1.3	Is it possible to use my DSL internet connection to connect with this modem and still leave the modem connected for dial up functionality ?	Ques
1.2.1	We did such as a dial up server years ago .	St
1.2.2	Here 's the setup .	St
1.2.3	We placed another machine ( a PC ) at a location with dial up connections .	St
1.2.4	We then would run VNC ( see google ! )	St
1.2.5	to that machine and do the dial up from that machine with our machine controlling the remote PC .	St
1.2.6	As you can imagine the setup is fairly technical but proved it could be done .	St
