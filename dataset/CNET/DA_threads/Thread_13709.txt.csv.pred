1.1.7	My drive is set to master .	St
1.1.8	I have n't tried hooking it up to another computer yet .	St
1.1.9	That is my next step .	St
1.1.10	Any other ideas or has this 7 yr old dell given up the ghost ?	Ques
1.2.1	The last time I saw a machine that the BIOS did n't see a HDD but Windows did , involved some SCSI controller card .	St
1.2.2	But you wrote IDE .	St
