I installed it and in the &quot;My computer&quot; window it shows that I have two hard drives installed when I really only have one. What does this mean? It shows that there are files stored on this &quot;second&quot; hard drive. Is there a way to delete this &quot;fake&quot; drive?

If so, that cd might have created the second harddrive (partition) by default because that's where it keeps its files in case you want to add/remove components or need to replace a corrupt file.
