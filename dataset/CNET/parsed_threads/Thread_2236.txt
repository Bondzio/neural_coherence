<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I'm looking for advice about this computer. </s>
<s> I'm looking for e new desktop for digital imaging. </s>
<s> How has this machine preformed for everyone? </s>
<s> The Gateway GT5032 is a great computer for processor-intensive operations, if you aren't afraid to do a couple of upgrades. </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> You need a 'real' graphics card. </s>
<s> The cpu ships with an onboard nVidia GeForce 6100 video processor on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Good for everyday stuff, but not so good for serious computing. </s>
<s> I upgraded to a GeForce 7800 GT OC PCI Express card. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> It ships with 1 gig of PC-3200 DDR memory (DO NOT believe the tech assistance info here. </s>
<s> It falsely says the system uses PC-4200 DDR2, it does NOT.) </s>
<s> Install at least one more gig (there are 4 memory slots each supporting up to 1 gig) of high quality DDR (I used Dual channel matched Corsair memory). </s>
<s> The unit ships with 1 gig CAS 3 memory, you can do much better. </s>
<s> After these upgrades I can easily play 2 instances of Dark Age of Camelot on the computer without missing a beat. </s>
<s> Photo editing is a breeze, even if my antivirus is scanning in the background. </s>
<s> One caveat here, while the Media Center computer has 7 USB2 ports and 2 Firewire ports, it only has one PCI Express slot and 2 PCI slots, one of which is occupied with a useless 56K modem, and the other with the TV tuner. </s>
<s> Consequently expandability is very limited. </s>
<s> The GT5032 does not have a 3.5&quot; floppy drive. </s>
<s> On the plus side, thanks to its BTX motherboard/layout this is one very quiet computer! </s>
<s> It also has convenient memory card slots in the front. </s>
<s> This is a good little computer, that with some cash and a bit of tweaking can be a great one. </s>
<s> Bought this computer yesterday, and tv locked up minutes after install...saw lots of peoples' reviews at retail stores after purchase, who stated same problem. </s>
<s> Found it hard to believe the &quot;pros&quot; at Consumer Reports #1 Retailer - MicroCenter (KS) did not have a clue about this problem and recommended this as a great media center computer for tv use. </s>
<s> Went back to store next day and they offered to exchange..hahaha. </s>
<s> Luckily, searched Google one last time for a solution tonight...and here it is...the update from Microsoft provided by &quot;The Wesker&quot; fixed the problem asap!!!!! </s>
<s> Have been running tv now for about 2+ plus hours without skips, stalls, freezing, etc. </s>
<s> lpaultracy, I noticed that the power supply on the GT5032 is only 300W max. </s>
<s> The minimum for the GeForce 7800 GT OC PCI Express card is 400W. </s>
<s> Did you also replace the power supply when you tweaked your GT5032? </s>
<s> I'm getting very flaky results with the standard 300W power supply and the BFG help desk said that it was because of the lack of power. </s>
<s> I would also like to know if he had to upgrade the power supply. </s>
<s> I did end up upgrading my power supply. </s>
<s> However, I am still having problems running two monitors. </s>
<s> If I leave the hardware acceleration at ''Full'' then I get both monitors going black, with the only recourse left is to reboot. </s>
<s> I have monitored the video card and cpu temperature and they are all in the normal range. </s>
<s> It varies from 15 minutes to several hours before it shuts off. </s>
<s> I have hibernate and all power saving turned off. </s>
<s> If I run just a single monitor, it seems to stay up longer, but even then I have had it lock up. </s>
<s> I tried setting the Hardware acceleration to None and it ran for over 24 hours with no problem. </s>
<s> I'm now notching it back up one tick at a time. </s>
<s> I am now several hours into the second tick up from None. </s>
<s> Has anyone else had these kinds of problems? </s>
<s> By the way, I already replaced the BFG GeForce 7800 GT OC card once. </s>
<s> The second card exhibited the very same symptoms as the first. </s>
<s> Is this a problem with the Gateway, the video card, or an incompatibility between the two? </s>
<s> Any ideas out there? </s>
<s> System specs: Gateway GT5032 4GB Corsair ValueSelect RAM BFG GeForce 7800 GT OC Video Card Antec SmartPower 2.0 500W power supply Samsung SyncMaster 914v Gateway FPD2185W </s>
<s> I actually never replaced the original power supply in the GT5032. </s>
<s> Have had no issues with it even under a load. </s>
<s> I have had no problems at all with the BFG 7800 GT OC card out of the box. </s>
<s> When I put in the card I didn't notice the manufacturer's requirements for a 400 watt power supply, but have experienced no issues at all with the stock Gateway 300w PS. </s>
<s> I am using the integrated sound card and I do not use the TV tuner card at all. </s>
<s> Like I said I have had great luck with this system/card set-up. </s>
<s> I have an outside-the-box question for you... Is it possible that one of your power dongles from the PS to your card are screwed up somehow? </s>
<s> This could result in lower than expected current flow to your video card and all sorts of funky problems. </s>
<s> I know the Gateway didn't have sufficient power cables on the PS when I got mine so I had to pick up some splitters. </s>
<s> It may be possible that one of yours has some hidden damage. </s>
<s> If so, this could be a three dollar fix. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> ---Paul </s>
<s> Paul, That is a good idea. </s>
<s> Although I have been having this problem even before I replaced the power supply. </s>
<s> I have just now used a second PCI-e power cable that came with the Antec power supply and plugged it into a different outlet on the power supply. </s>
<s> Another thing that I forgot to mention is that the Hardware acceleration is set independantly for each monitor. </s>
<s> The setting for the Samsung has been set on full since the beginning. </s>
<s> The setting for the Gateway is the one that I have been varying. </s>
<s> I found that either None or the very first notch seems to work (at least up to 24 hours). </s>
<s> When I tried the second notch yesterday it failed after several hours. </s>
<s> Today I have switched the power cables as described and set the Hardware acceleration to full to see if it fails. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestion! </s>
<s> I have a GT5032..I see you put a new video card in...How do you install a new video card in it (PCI-e)..I bought an ATI X1600 PRO card..but am a little unsure about installing it..Do I disable anything first?..Jumpers..Uninstall drivers..Can you tell me how to install the new video card..into the GT5032?..Thanks!.. </s>
<s> I ended up returning the my Gateway and going for an HP. </s>
<s> However, in general, you should follow the instructions that came with the video card. </s>
<s> I believe they suggest that you install their drivers first, then instal the card. </s>
<s> The one thing you will have to do is upon startup go into the boot settings and change the video from the built in to PCI-e. </s>
<s> I don't remember the exact settings, but you should be able to find it. </s>
<s> Hope this helped! </s>
<s> I'm going to try a 7600GT in the stock GT5032. </s>
<s> Will let you guys know how it goes. </s>
<s> im going to be buying one in the next few days , i have a 400w psu now , someone told me that they require 26 amps on the 12v rail , know anything about that? </s>
