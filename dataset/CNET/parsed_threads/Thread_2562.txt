<s> I have just changed my graphic card. </s>
<s> I had an ati AIW 9700pro and I just installed my brand new x800gto. </s>
<s> I plugged it in and the driver automatically recognized it (both use catalyst I wonder If I should have reinstalled it though ??). </s>
<s> Everything worked fine when I installed it this morning but when I got home from work today, weird things started happening. </s>
<s> My cpu was on the &quot;Choose your session screen&quot; because I had been away for a while which is normal but when I clicked on my session it asked me for a password ( I never put a password on my session). </s>
<s> I tried typing nothing and clicking enter and it didnt work so I rebooted my cpu. </s>
<s> I could log in w/o password on my session no prob but just as it loaded my desktop the screen turned black (I could still hear all the fans running). </s>
<s> I rebooted my pc a couple times with the same problem and after like 5 times it finnaly worked... </s>
<s> I am starting to think that my psu might be the problem, Its an old 300watt and ati says the x800series need at least 300watt. </s>
<s> Might it be the problem ? </s>

<s> your login name isn't &quot;administrator&quot;), when it asks you to choose your login session, hit ctrl-alt-delete & then click on the login name, & backspace the whole thing..... type in &quot;administrator&quot; (without quotes obviously) with no password and hit &quot;ok&quot; & you'll be logged in to the default administrator account. </s>
<s> if it logs in to this account without problems, then you know it's most likely a file corruption problem. </s>
<s> if that's the case, manually remove all the drivers from your new hardware & then try reinstalling them. </s>
