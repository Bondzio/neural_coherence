It does not recognize the new system's hardware. Most likely will have to a new install, including mobo drivers and other drivers. You can save your data to a CD before moving the drive, but not most of the App's. They need to be reinstalled to restablish the .dll's etc..

You will need the new MB drivers. Here is a link that may help.

With XP, everything gets a little hairy, so beware you need your product key, so get it(save) to later input it or know it from the MS sticker. But, here's what I do using Ghost from Norton. Copy the old HD to new/old -OR- partition to partition and/or HD to partition. It should wipe out whatever is on the &quot;destination&quot; in order to copy from source. I like to use partition to partition, don't proceed until you're sure. Other s/w like Arconis does this too. You may use the HD s/w provided from HD maker as well, but sometimes that gets confusing, but its free. If for example the old/new HD is from Maxtor use MaxBlast s/w. Other HD vendors have different names but the task is similar. As always save whatever you deem critial data before hand. tada -----Willy
