1.1.1	Hi.	St
1.1.2	I've run out of ideas trying to solve this problem, so now I'm begging for help &lt;strong&gt;History/Syptoms.&lt;/strong&gt; I have an &lt;strong&gt;Asus M2N-VM DVI&lt;/strong&gt; mainboard which has on-board HD sound (&lt;strong&gt;ALC662 High Definition Audio&lt;/strong&gt;) and on-board video adap.	St
1.1.3	On a fresh instal of Win XP Pro SP2 everything worked great.	St
1.1.4	Then, after about two weeks, the sound just stopped working (nothing had changed, no new drivers, no new hardware, not even installed any new apps at time of failure).	St
1.1.5	I tried removing and re-installing drivers (methodology later) but no luck, so eventually I re-installed windows; hey presto, sound worked again...for a few weeks!	St
1.1.6	Then it stopped again!!!	St
1.1.7	I really don't want to have to keep re-installing Windows, so I need to sort out this problem.	St
1.1.8	&lt;strong&gt;Here's what I've done so far...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I disabled the soundcard in the BIOS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Booted into safe mode and used add/remove progs to remove all chipset and soundcard drivers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Re-booted into safe mode to ensure nothing was listed in device manager under sound, nothing was.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Re-booted into BIOS, enabled sound device&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Re-booted into normal mode&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cancelled the Windows 'Found new hardware' dialogue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Installed latest chipset drivers from Asus&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Re-booted...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Now the problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Windows detects the soundcard as 'PCI device' but will not associate it with the correct drivers.	St
1.1.9	I've tried using the Windows 'found new hardware' function to search, nothing found, even with driver disc in tray, I've used the 'don't instal automatically, I will pick the best driver' option, but Windows always says 'the location does not contain information about this hardware', I've tried just installing the driver package using its own setup.exe, this installs but the soundcard doesn't work and on re-boot windows finds new PCI device again.	St
1.1.10	I've gone through many variations of this process but nothing will make the soundcard work.	St
1.1.11	Any suggestions?	St
1.1.12	Please?	St
1.2.1	I won't supply a link to that issue but when this happens we'll just disable the onboard sound and install a sound card.	St
1.2.2	Why we do this is &quot;time is money&quot; and no owner would pay to troubleshoot the issue or replace the motherboard in case that was it.	St
