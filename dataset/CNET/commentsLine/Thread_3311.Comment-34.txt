guess the simplistic answer would be go as fast as you could afford.
as far as image processing and sound goes, you might want to do some looking around at benchmarks on intel setups if you havent already done that.
intel does do better than amd when it comes to those sorts of applications, if i remember correctly.
it's in gaming where amd's really shine.
if you want to go amd though, either a 754 pin 3400+ or 939 pin 3500+ or above would probably be best.
this given of course the rest of the machine is up to speed with that(no pc133 ram etc).
i think definitely try to stay in the 3k range.
dont know how high you can go in the 3ks with a socket a but the higher the better.
