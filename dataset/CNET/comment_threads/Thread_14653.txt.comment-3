The LCDs do indeed do that.
First let's find that LCD burn out article.
http://www.calce.umd.edu/articles/abstracts/1999/indiumtext.htm In short, the materials in the LCD have degraded.
There is no fix available except to replace the LCD panel.
Sadly this is not economically sound since panel replacement exceeds the cost of the total display.
Hope this helps.
