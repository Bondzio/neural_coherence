I have a buddy that dives in and can edit file allocation tables but he's always busy and charges a few hundred per hour for his services.
The ontrack software is free and would tell you if it would work.
Why not?
I didn't re-read the entire thread but I NEVER had to repair the system volume information (read http://www.theeldergeek.com/system_volume_information_folder1.htm ) since that's just part of Windows.
I did run into a toasted OS last year and to save some of their work without reinstalling the entire system I put the drive as a slave and deleted that directory, ran chkdsk and got lucky that a repair install of XP brought it back, but the damage was quite odd.
The bottom line was they were a P2P user and took a hit.
