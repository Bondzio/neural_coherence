1.3.1	Anytime you use a hub to connect devices , each device connected to the hub diminishes the bandwidth from the source ( in this case your internet connection coming from your pc ) .	St
1.3.2	I would suggest you get a switch instead and plug all 8 machines into it along with the incoming internet connection .	Sug
1.3.3	Everytime something is plugged into a hub , it cuts the original bandwidth or transfer speed in half .	St
