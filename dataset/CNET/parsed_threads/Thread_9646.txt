<s> Hi there, I have a issue with my new pc. </s>
<s> I have install 64 bit windows 7 but it did not detect my 2*4 GB G.Skill Ram[instead it only use 4 GB of it]. </s>
<s> When I recently upgraded my laptop from 2 x 2 GB to 2 x 4 GB, it didn't detect either one. </s>
<s> I went back and noticed that I hadn't pushed the little suckers in all the way (even though I thought I had), so I pushed them in with more force (more than I had expected) and rebooted. </s>
<s> It could be that one of your might have the same problem. </s>
<s> If that's not it, I've read that sometimes there's a BIOS setting you have to tweak, although I've never personally seen it. </s>
<s> Since you say it's a new computer, I don't suppose there's a 4 GB hardware limit, but I'd check that just to be sure. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> What does the BIOS show? </s>
<s> And before you answer, Windows will never show more than what the BIOS shows. </s>
