I'd also like to retrieve the few files I hadn't backed up (some downloaded mp3's and a few Word docs). I'm wondering though, since I can't boot the laptop to reformat the hard drive, is there going to be a problem with an already formatted master HD being plugged into one of my other computers as an external HD. If so, is there a way to pull the files from the HD and reformat before building the external HD? Thanks.

Your choice on the case, here's the adapter cable, big bucks. http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=HD-108&cat=CBL
