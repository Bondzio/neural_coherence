if i use some dvd media as a drive software then when i take this dvd to another machine the files are missing.
back to the machine i created it on and my files show.
why is that?
it happens because the machine that it worked on has special drivers (called filters) that enable use to see and write to the dvd media as if it was a slow hard drive.
i discourage use of such titles for the very reason you posted.
if you can supply the title of software you used or if you used the native os feature we can look into how to get at the files on other pcs.
for now you can look up isobuster and see if it sees the files.
