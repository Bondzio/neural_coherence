2381	0	570157	5346849	NR	teresa1020	8/13/12 10:30 AM	1.3448538E12	Help..	I have a Dell Hybrid that will not boot to the OS. It loads about halfway and goes to this screen. I cannot reload windows at this point and would like some help on what to do. I ran a diagnostics test and the HDD test passed. Press F2 for run setup. Press F11 if you want to boot from the network. Press F12 for BBS POPUP. The MCH is operating with DDR2-667/CL5 in Dual-Channel. It will not let me boot into Safe Mode. What can I do to reinstall the OS.

Try cd/dvd lens cleaners first then a new drive. 2. There are USB things plugged in. Try without. 3. The HDD has one of those boot virus infections. To fix that has too many solutions from bootable CDs to reinstalling the OS. Keep supplying clues so other ideas can be put forward. Bob

I have changed the boot order to cd and still nothing. I can't seem to get past this page at all. I can go into the the system using F11/F12 and F1 and F2 and that is it. Tell me what information you need and I will be happy to give it to you. By the way, thank you Bob.

If the CD comes out in the same orientation the drive is likely dead. There isn't much more information needed yet. It sounds like some repairs are required. More story would be nice such as that infection you noticed and cleaned off. Bob

She states that she was on facebook and had to run to town so she just left the page open and when she got back she had the page with all the information. She also says that this is her 3rd cd rom and she was having problems with it as well. Is there anyway other way to reinstall the OS? When I put the CD in it takes forever for it to let me eject it. I was hoping I could put it in and the option would pop up to reinstall.

As to replacing many drives that's pretty common in some machines as the drive is in some hot area of the case. The drives last a year or 2. At least drives are cheap. As to installing Windows, I used Dell's install notes for that machine. I rarely have to dream up another method. Bob

What do I need to do next? It originally had Vista and she upgraded to Windows 7. Do I need to get her Vista disk in order to reinstall. Right now when it asks where do want to download there are no options.

Dell does offer the downloads if they are missing on some machines. You might have to call it in. Here's an example -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/7726-13974_102-5325452.html?tag=posts;msg5325452 Sorry to read it's being difficult but nothing seems out of the ordinary so far (failing drives, missing restore media, etc.) Bob

OK to use a knife or such to pry the plastic cover off the CD tray (part that comes out when ejecting the CD disc) to get you fingers on it to pull on it and thus get the tray to open manually. If broken.... The CD drive is getting power to it, right? Ensure it does have power before you attempt this. Does it appear to try to open, but won't?

The drive is good because it will load the CD in it which does me no good because it is the wrong CD. There is no pinhole in which to stick a paper clip into. This model does not come with one. That was the first thing I looked for. I took the CD drive out and still cannot get it out.
2381	12	570157	5347383	5347393	R. Proffitt	8/14/12 9:16 AM	1.34493576E12	This could be a first.	This would be the first Dell I've heard of without a manual eject. Too bad the exact models of the Dell, the drive are not in the discussion. With the details I could look for pictures or more. Bob

2381	15	570157	5347389	5347379	R. Proffitt	8/14/12 10:21 AM	1.34493966E12	Can't find a clear picture of that model.	But it is time to look for the eject pin hole on the face of the drive. Bob
