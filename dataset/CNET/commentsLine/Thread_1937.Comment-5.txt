downsizing...lol the reason i was looking for -r was that, it's my understanding that -r media is more compatible with stand alone dvd players and such.
so i want to try what i can to make sure if i burn any videos they will play in most dvd players.
and i always thought +r worked, but -r worked better.
is that wrong?
