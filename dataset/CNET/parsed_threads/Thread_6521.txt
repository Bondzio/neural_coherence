<s> Hello All, A couple of days ago my mouse was freezing up and I would reboot and it would work. </s>
<s> Well now it will not work at all. </s>
<s> I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and everytime I try to add the device it says Windows was unable to exchange passkeys with your device. </s>
<s> The device has indicated a passkey failure. </s>
<s> You may have entered an incorrect passkey or the time to enter the passkey might have expired. </s>
<s> and it says to try again... Well, it won't even let me put the passkey in before this pops up.... </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas what is going on??? </s>
<s> Is the mouse going bad???? </s>
<s> The keyboard still works fine(also bluetooth).... Any help would be greatly appreciated..... </s>
<s> Thanks Flu Oh yea... Dell XPS 420 Vista Ultimate 32 Bit 4 Gigs Ram NVIDIA 8800GT </s>
<s> No passkey. </s>
<s> Odd. </s>
<s> try checking the bluetooth mouse battery, the same thing happedned to me. </s>
<s> tried the thing you just did but i realized it must be a 'power' problem. </s>
<s> maybe but i hope it helps. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I put new batteries in it. </s>
<s> I did fix the problem though. </s>
<s> I uninstalled the mouse and then added it again and picked No Passkey instead of letting it pick one for me....and it worked fine... Crazy when it is something that simple. </s>
<s> Thanks for trying though.... </s>
<s> Flu </s>
<s> i don't have a dell, but i would still question the possibility it could be the bluetooth server (the laptop) is the culprit here. </s>
<s> especially if something else works. </s>
<s> then it's the mouse. </s>
<s> i'm having the same issue, only mine only came back to life once. </s>
<s> yesterday. </s>
<s> and now today it hasn't worked at all. </s>
<s> *shrug* i hope it's nothing that would require me to send in the laptop to toshiba. </s>
<s> i thought bluetooth worked by a 'pairing' of devices... that it would pair up with another device (get in sync). </s>
<s> and windows 7 has hardly anything that is of use, there's a control panel that lets me add com ports. </s>
<s> like there's a slew of com ports open right now. </s>
<s> i've tried removing and reinstalling com ports, but nothing. </s>
<s> so i'm hoping he gets a suggestion that i could try. </s>
<s> thnx -leQ </s>
<s> And paired my logitech bt mouse on both. </s>
<s> It does not come up as a serial port so that's not it. </s>
<s> Did you follow the logitech directions at logitech.com? </s>
<s> For example I didn't read where you press a connect button. </s>
<s> &quot;Logitech keyboards and mice are in discoverable mode when you press the 'Connect' button located on the bottom.&quot; </s>
