3688	0	125506	1420941	NR	fauxflamepropagandacorp	9/14/05 3:44 PM	1.12671264E12	Is there hardware that can simulate two PCs	Given the problems with trying to use WINE / Crossover Office, VMWare, Bochs and other non-solutions, is there hardware that can simulate two PCs, allowing one to load two operating systems and comfigure how much memory to allocate to each OS perhaps in CMOS / BIOS if in the motherboard or by a Windows, DOS, or Linux program otherwise? There are a few concerns of mine here. There are bound to be some device-related issues here. Perhaps have some devices accessable by only one OS at a time such as sound cards. I am not so sure this is appropriate /workable for displays. Another real concern would be bus mastering devices. The only search terms and phrases I can think of lead to irrelevant results.

I suppose one might manage to use an Ethernet card to boot over a network and make one of the machines diskless (no hard drive, floppy drives or CD / DVD drives) and perhaps no sound or USB as well (or use USB instead of Serial ATA).

One kind of hibenates while the other is active. Now if you get yourself one of the big IBM water cooled main frames from 15 years ago you could do it easly. I do it Bob's way. John
