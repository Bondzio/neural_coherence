1.1.1	I have a Compaq Presario Intel-P4 with 256MB-RAM.	St
1.1.2	I have been using a CDwriter-***-DVD combo for several months.	St
1.1.3	I recently updated to XP-SP2 and also patched my system from WinUpdate site.	St
1.1.4	I also just updated Nero6-reloaded packages 1 and 3, without yahoo toolbar.	St
1.1.5	My CDwriter-***-DVD combo drive is suddenly refusing to open the drive, either from pressing the hardware switch on the drive, or right-clicking the drive in MyComputer and selecting eject.	St
1.1.6	I am only able to open the drive by inserting a pin in the front-hole of the drive.	St
1.1.7	Is this a potential hardware issue, or some software conflict (driver, dll, etc.)?	St
1.1.8	Thanks,	St
1.2.1	A bug in INCD would leave the door locked.	St
1.2.2	Not a XP issue but in what you added.	St
1.2.3	Uninstall INCD and delete the upperfilters, lowerfilters as noted http://support.microsoft.com/kb/270008/en-us I did not look up the article listing NERO.	St
1.2.4	You can do that but the fix is the same.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
