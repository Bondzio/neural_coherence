6339	0	322224	2937451	NR	ag400187	12/27/08 10:38 AM	1.23037428E12	ATI Radeon XPRESS 200 Distorted Image	I have an ATI Radeon XPRESS 200 embedded in the motherboard of my eMachine T6424. The picture that I see is distorted and I cannot remove the graphics card. I have tried this with numerous monitors and have even reinstalled the video drivers that came with the machine, yet none of this seems to fix the problem. I am considering purchasing a new graphics card, but hope that I will not need to resort to this. I would greatly appreaciate if someone knows how to fix this without purchasing a new graphics card. Thanks!
