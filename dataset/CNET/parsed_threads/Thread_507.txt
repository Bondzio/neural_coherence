<s> thought the 2 partitions on my new hard drive got formatted cause I &quot;tested&quot; by copying some file to both partitions and saw them on BOTH partitions and observed when clicked &quot;Propertie&quot; for BOTH, saw tabs called (1) &quot;Sharing&quot; & (2) &quot;Quota&quot;, whatever those are/significance, I don't know yet/understand. </s>
<s> Then proceeded to rename BOTH, also in the &quot;Properties dialog box&quot; (the names that the partitioning AND formatting program gave the 2 partitions were generic-sounding names (like DRIVE2Vol#1 & DRIVE2Vol2, cause I hooked it up as an INTERNAL drive to a computer running WinXP Home Edition SP1. </s>
<s> The new drive was the only hard drive other than the other drive that's already in the computer running as the bootup drive (in other words, I hooked it up on the same cable as the bootup drive, using the spare connector that was hanging off of the cable...so I jumpered the new drive as a SLAVE drive (in a 2 drives on 1 cable, which presumably is the PRIMARY channel cable)). </s>
<s> Thinking I liked what I saw, I turned off PC, removed hard drive, jumpered it as a &quot;SINGLE&quot; drive by removing the jumper-thingy and put it in my EXTERNAL case that has BOTH FireWire/USB 2.0 interfaces and hooked it back to the same WinXP computer I used to format it, except this time using USB. </s>
<s> Turned it on after the computer, ONLY 1 partition is usable, by which I mean (1) the &quot;DRIVE2Vol2&quot; lost that name and now takes on yet still another generic-sounding name &quot;Local Disk&quot; and when I (2) clicked &quot;Properties&quot; for the partition that lost its name, the 2 previously observed tabs above are not there anymore, and (3) when I double clicked on it to find the files I copied to it when it was an INTERNAL drive, those files weren't there and Windows asked me if I &quot;wanted to format the drive?&quot; I'm not sure if I should click &quot;Yes&quot; button to format it or not........thus I'm here in this forum (AND I THOUGHT THE ABOVE MENTIONED PARTITIONING & FORMATTING SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH THE DRIVE SHOULD HAVE FORMATTED IT--ALREADY!!!) </s>
<s> Now for some details, the HD is a WD 250GB Caviar and the software that came with it is WD Data Lifeguard Tool v11.0 version for Windows (vs. for DOS). </s>
<s> I partitioned 2 equal partitions. </s>
<s> The sizes shown before I removed it to make into EXTERNAL HD were 116GB x 2 (BTW, should I have only this much GB as usable after formatting? </s>
<s> 18GB &quot;lost&quot;, not usable for my own data? </s>
<s> Is this common?). </s>
<s> When it's an EXternal drive, only 1 partitions of 116GB shows up......the other &quot;missing&quot; asks if I want to format it? </s>
<s> HEEEEEEEEELP please!!!! </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> (Oh, BTW, the SW asked me if I wanted to &quot;add the drive as an additional storage device&quot; or &quot;add the drive as the new boot device&quot;...I elected to use &quot;add the drive as an additional storage device&quot;.) </s>
<s> Moving a drive from an internal IDE to an external USB 2.0 case may find out that such moves are just not supported. </s>

<s> hola, Bob! </s>
<s> quote: &quot;Prepare the drive where it is to stay and move forward.&quot;..........................are you saying something or exactly like if choose internal installation stick with internal; if choose external stick with external? </s>
<s> Just clarifying. </s>
<s> OK, so if I choose EXternal like I wanted to to begin with all this time............... quote: &quot;Moving a drive from an internal IDE to an external USB 2.0 case may find out that such moves are just not supported.&quot;..............................maybe not supported by the hard drive manufacturers especially if they also have external product lines........but I'm sure you know there's a thriving external enclosures business out there,no???? </s>
<s> Oh, and mine has BOTH USB 2.0 AND FireWire(400), if that makes a difference.....as in should it make a difference whether I choose to partition & format the new hard drive with one interface (USB or FireWire, pick one, doesn't matter), then after (& IF) I succesfully did, I should be able to write data to it with the other interface since it's already prepped-to-receive-data? </s>
<s> And vice-versa as far as the interface to prep-the-drive? </s>
<s> And to be successful, what software (combination perhaps?) </s>
<s> should I use in your opinion (within the OS whether WinXP or Media Center 2004 or WD's Data Lifeguard Tool v11.0)?? </s>
<s> quote: &quot;There are many older USB cases that don't support over 137GB drives. </s>
<s> You may have such. </s>
<s> I see them in the cheapest offerings.&quot;......................I would consider mine new cause I bought it around April 2004 as a QPS DVD burner that I'm &quot;recycling&quot; the external enclosure for my Caviar WD2500JB (250GB)............Do you think it's certain electrical/electronics issues as far as external enclosures of any brand/manufacturer that we need to put our fingers on? </s>
<s> Can you help me find out what these issues are? </s>
<s> What exactly do I need to look for in buying an external enclosure??? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help and best regards, P.S. </s>
<s> and my WinXP & WinXP Media Center 2004 computers were also bought in April so they shouldn't have BIOS/chipset limitations for LARGE hard drives (or I am going on those assumptions).........And any more info you need to ask, please do. </s>

<s> ?&quot; In short, yes, no, and support for over 137GB drives. </s>
<s> The issue is well worn, well discussed by many thousands (hint: check Google groups.) </s>
<s> I'll offer that it's very likely your enclosure has this limit too BUT!!!! </s>
<s> Why not just pop the drive into the enclosure and use XP's Drive Management tool to delete the partitions on it, create what you want, format and see what happens? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks for the fast help Bob! </s>
<s> OK I'll Google and follow what you suggested in last paragraph but can't do these until in a couple of days (got a few other things right now).........but will get back after if still got issues....Toodle-loo </s>
