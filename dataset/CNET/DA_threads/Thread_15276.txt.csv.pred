1.1.1	So i over clocked my AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2Ghz to 2.46Ghz and when i use my computer for any reason sometimes its 5 minutes sometimes more i get a Blue Screen that says something about hardware i 've never finished it but after it i turned it down to 2.25Ghz and i dont get it anymore .	St
1.1.2	Is this hardware , software , maybe not enough cooling ?	Ques
1.1.3	Please help	St
1.2.1	When you OC , you 're pushing things .	St
1.2.2	You have to find a happy medium and then it 'll settle down .	St
1.2.3	Cooling is very important as well as adding a slight voltage increase for the cpu to be OC'ed .	St
1.2.4	This is a go or no go process , until you finally get there .	St
1.2.5	As you increase cpu voltage then cooling even in a default system is critial it becomes even more so with an OC'ed one .	St
1.2.6	So you take your chances as it wre .	St
1.2.7	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
