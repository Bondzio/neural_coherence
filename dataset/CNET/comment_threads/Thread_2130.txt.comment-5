~$20 (tiger direct) Video Card http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=4035118&sku=E145-9500&srkey=E145-9500 $44.99 Motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128358&Tpk=GA-EP45-UD3P $110 Harddrive?
(I have a 80gb in my old computer atm) ~$40 Excluding monitor/mouse/keyboard/speakers, am I missing anything?
Would some of these not go together well?
Is there anything I should get instead of what I listed?
What memory would go with that motherboard (I looked on newegg but they didn't have the motherboard listed in their memory finder).
If I were to get dual gpus or a better one, would it be able to play intense games like crysis at 40fps+?
Thankyou so much!
(And please, if there is one thing you can answer, tell me if the case and power supply are good, because the sale ends 11/26).
