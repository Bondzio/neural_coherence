murata appears to be a manufacturer components for a variety of devices, such as mobile phones.
you can always lock out access to that device through your router and see which of your devices loses access.
i once had a mac address that i didn't recognize on my network.
it took some time but i figured out it belonged to a media streamer that i only occasionally used.
i make a list of all devices and associated mac addresses so that i can periodically review the list on my router and make sure there are no unauthorized devices connected.
