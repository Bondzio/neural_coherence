<s> I'm having trouble identifying memory sticks in my computer. </s>
<s> Just decided to combine two old pc's from HP. </s>
<s> One of the sticks has a label with 16X64. </s>
<s> Is this 128mb of ram or 64mb ram? </s>
<s> Download and install Everest Home Edition (free).That will tell you about all hardware details of your PC. </s>
<s> www.crucial.com You don't need to buy their RAM (it's mad expensive) but you can easily have the RAM in your computer identified either by downloading their tool or just by finding and selecting the make and specific model of your computer. </s>
