Then whoever pays the bill for the DSL owns that account.
If your roommates username/password was used to access the download site, that could be related to the problem.
If you pay the bill, that's a different matter.
This is beginning to sound like an issue you'll need to take up with your ISP if it's just related to software they offer with a subscription to their service.
Sorry...can't help in that regard.
