In the past, there is no problem with the computer after reformatting and the same drivers &amp; softwares have been using.
During reformatting there is screen which shows all the drives and 8MB unpartitioned space, which ask the user where to install the OS.
Since it is showing only 2MB, i feel that there is something wrong some where which make the PC to show errors.
Is this the main problem?
Whether we should always get 8MB?
