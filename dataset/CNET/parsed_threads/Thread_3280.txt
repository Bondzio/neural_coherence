<s> I have been trying to shop for a new, high quality, flatscreen monitor. </s>
<s> The DELL Ultrasharp U2711 has very good stats, features and reviews, but it is more than 2 years old, and I find very little info on anything to replace it. </s>
<s> IS there anything out there in the same general price range, with equal or better qualities and features? </s>
<s> I know it is supposed to run &quot;hot&quot;, but other than that (and the fact that it is a two-year-old design)....would it be a poor choice for a new purchase? </s>
<s> Thanks, jp </s>
<s> If I were to take bets it will be that next wave of &quot;Retina&quot; displays. </s>
<s> Are you sure you want such a display? </s>

<s> Well, I have been using an ancient, huge, Viewsonic CRT, which I have always liked, but which is beginning to SHOW it's age. </s>
<s> I like BIG, and I want GOOD...trouble is, I haven't shopped in so long, I have lost the &quot;thread&quot; on what to look for. </s>
<s> I would say 80% of my useage is managing images, and text documents, some photoshop work, and the rest in online games like WOW, SWTOR, and Second Life. </s>
<s> I want to SEE it, and I am not getting any younger . </s>
<s> I can afford $500 to $700. </s>
<s> Does any of that help? </s>
<s> Thanks, jp </s>
<s> Since you are doing photoshop you probably already have the usual Pantone Huey thing so why not go shopping as well? </s>
<s> That is, head out to Fry's, BB and such for a little face time? </s>

<s> are disproportionately priced, it might be worthwhile to consider dual displays ...like two 23&quot; or 24&quot; equivalents. </s>
<s> I see great offers for monitors including Dells on Techbargains.com ....look right at the top of the webpage under 'Top Deals by Product Category'. </s>
<s> You'd probably spend the around the same amount but you'd have two displays ...more screen space and options if that would be any benefit to you. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
