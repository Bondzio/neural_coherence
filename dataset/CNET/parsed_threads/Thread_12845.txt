<s> Hey, I know this has probably been covered before but i couldn't find one that matched my situation. </s>
<s> Ok so i bought a sata hd as a backup dive, and at first xp recognized it. </s>
<s> But i got an error half way though formatting the sata and since then xp will not recognized it.And don't say disk management because that the typical solution I keep finding except for the fact that it doesn't show in disk management. </s>
<s> Any idea's people ?? </s>
<s> system is - Amd athlon 3200+ 64 bit , msi RS482m4 mother board, 1.5 gigs of ram , with a ide main hd and the sata is a WD Caviar Black </s>
<s> Try that; if not then maybe go to WD website and download some. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> I guess you didn't read the part that the hd doesn't show in disk management. </s>
<s> It shows in the bios , not in windows . </s>
<s> And i've tried all of the software to download from WD and still nothing </s>
<s> it may be worth deleting your sata controller driver from device manager. </s>
<s> after removing it, and rebooting, the system will automatically reinstall, and redetect devices attached. </s>
<s> if it still fails, preform the same again, with the sata drive detached, and after it's reinstalled, then attach the sata drive. </s>
