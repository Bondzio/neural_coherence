Can you provide a link for &quot;apple juice?&quot; P2P sharing software can cause problems and allow for nasties to get into your computer. Shutdown problem could be heat. Possibly nasties (viruses, spyware, malware). Try: software firewall (free ZoneAlarm) antivurus scan scan with more than one antispyware program

It runs VERY HOT. I haven't had the shutdown problem...YET. As R. Proffitt outlined in his other posts, I am expecting to have to clean the heatsinks and vents and within the next year. I will get a cooling pad if the temps still get too high. I use SpeedFan (Download.com) to get an idea of how hot the CPU is getting.
