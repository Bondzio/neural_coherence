Will a Prescott series P4 operate properly in any 800Mhz mainboard or does it require special chipset support.
I tend to think that because the main difference between the Prescott and other 800Mhz P4s is the L2 cache AND that it is an on-die cache, it should not require any special mainboard but......
I could be wrong.
Also what types of uses is the 1meg L2 cache going to benefit the most?
