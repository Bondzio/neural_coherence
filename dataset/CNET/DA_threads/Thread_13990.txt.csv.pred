1.1.1	One of my roommates just purchased the Linksys PLK200 Powerline Adapter set for about $200 at our local Best Buy.	St
1.1.2	Looking around the internets it seems that I can get an additional Adapater (PLE200) for about $85.	St
1.1.3	My question is would I be able to buy a Powerline Adapater from a different manufacturer (less $$) that would still be compatible with his system?	St
1.1.4	I think the answer is yes, but I was hoping for a 2nd opinion from someone with a bit more networking smarts than me.	St
1.2.1	$5 difference at the most; so why not just stick with linksys?	St
