Different BIOSes use different beep codes for a specific hardware problem. Try reseating the video card. Then try to find out whose BIODS is being used. Do you know amnything else about the computer, such as the name the mfr, the mobo type, ert al? Can try checking the mfrs site for beep code info.

Before you do, be certain that the power is completely OFF, by unplugging the Power supply [or turning it off by the switch on the rear of the supply]. Be aware that the computer always has some power on the mobo as long as the power supply is plugged in to a hot outlet.[un less its switch is off]. When you take the cover off, be sure to touch some part of the metal chassis to ground yourself and discharge any static electricity that could damage components, Touch the metal as frequently as possible. The video card, of course, is the one that has the monitor cable connected to it. Remove the card and reinstall it physically. The AGP socket takes considerable force to engage the card fully.

(these are much smaller and flat than the video card) try to push the edge levers of the memory socket simultaneously, then CAREFULLY, insert it back following where the notches of the memory should fit and wait until a click sound or it locks up with the lever. (YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE MEMORY MODULE)
