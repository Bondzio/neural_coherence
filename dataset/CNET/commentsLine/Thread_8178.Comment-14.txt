rist off, thank you so much for your expertise and patience with me.
i tried downloading the firmware and i am running into a problem that i hope you can talk me through.
this is what i have done.
i went into the linksys downloads website and entered the type of router i have and began the firmware download.
i get a box that asks if i want to save this file, which i do (i save it to desktop).
when i do that i get a box that shows it is downloading, then a box that says download complete.
with the download complete box i get three options, open, open folder, close.
when i chose open folder, absolutely nothing happens, not even a window opens.
when i chose open, i get a box that says i am attempting to open a bin file that could damage my computer or my operating system.
when i ask to open it anyway i get a box that says windows cannot open this file.
to open this file windows needs to know what program created it.
what do you want to do?
and it give me two options and they are 1) use the web service to find the appropriate program or select the program from a list.
when i click select the program from a list a box comes up that states &quot;choose the program you want to use to open this file&quot; and it has recommended programs with internet explorer highlighted.
under that are other programs such as microsoft word, notepad, wordpad, etc.
and then under that there is browse button.
when i hit the browse button it goes to program files with a bunch of folder in it and none of them are linksys.
when i change it to go to desktop, the downloaded firmware is not there until i change the option to search all the files and then it is an option.
when i click on the download, a box comes up that states it cannot be opened.
that is where i get stuck.
am i doing this completely wrong?
