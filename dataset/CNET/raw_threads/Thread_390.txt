However my machine reports through Device Manager that the USB mass storage device will function at reduced speed and I need to add a high speed USB host controller. Si Soft Sandra reports the speeds as varying from 1.5 to 12 Mbps. XP SP2 Professional What is going on please and how do I sort it out? Thanks

I have the CD supplied with the motherboard - and don't know if the guy who built it used it or downloaded drivers! Is it likely that this will be the driver package you refer to and in which case do I simply load it and see what happens. Any likelihood of screwing things up as I am not competent in this area? Thanks

You paid for this work so decide to install the drivers or call the suppliers (of board or who installed the OS) to get your money's worth. I install such drivers daily it seems since Microsoft doesn't do it for us. There is no worry for me about messing up since we can always start over. Bob
