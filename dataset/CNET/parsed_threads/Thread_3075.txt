<s> I'm looking for a new flash drive and would like some suggestions. </s>
<s> I currrently have a 512mb cruzer titanium which is now not big enough (i got it because of it's speed). </s>
<s> i am looking for something that has a 1 or 2Gb storage capacity. </s>
<s> i like the &quot;new&quot; cruzer titanium but don't know if it is any good. </s>
<s> Thos bigger ones(1mb or better) I've come across haven't failed yet, but most are relativity new, so I can't yes/no on any certain brand. </s>
<s> Lower capacity ones have done quite well and when they do fail, they just do, more than likely because of &quot;static/ESD&quot; damage. </s>
<s> I do find the Kingston brand more to my liking as I've had a 32mb for years and still works, all others have failed, like Memorex and Secure jumpdrives. </s>
<s> Some other &quot;give-aways&quot; when they were 128mb or less didn't make it and died too, but they certainly lasted at least 1-2 yrs. </s>
<s> before biting the dust. </s>
<s> Earlier Cruzer drives had some glitch and I stayed away from them, but it seems they've corrected that(not recongized) or resolved it. </s>
<s> As for any flash drives, I like those that have an easily &quot;recappable&quot; cover for the business end. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I've got a Cruzer Titanium 512...nice, solid, fast; a memorex TravelDrive 1GB ...light, fast and a 4GB Corsair Voyager...link below. </s>
<s> All have worked well and the latter has a 1o year warranty. </s>

<s> Over the years I've used a variety of brands of off-system storage, including the Cruiser 1Gb which worked flawlessly except for the need for a clean reformat at time of purchase (can be said of most of them -- work best/most reliably if they are wiped occassionally). </s>
<s> Things to consider/watch for: - If you have a Mac anywhere in your workflow (home/office/local print-house/etc), make sure the drive is cross-platform compatible. </s>
<s> The Cruiser is, although file names get truncated. </s>
<s> - Consider whether you would be better served by a dual-purpose machine, such as an iPod (which can be used for storage as well for any model except the shuffle, while still providing MP3/AIFF/AC3/etc playback capabilites with the rest of the dedicated memory), or a cell-phone that takes mini-CF cards and an USB dataport, or even a digital camera with a large memory card. </s>
<s> I have used all of these methods at various times to move data, and one of my HD-based iPods commonly serves as a field-boot drive for client macs in addition to just being an ''iPod''. </s>
<s> - Finally, consider how long you want the data, how much you'll need in a year or two, and whether a micro external HD (eSATA, USB-2, FireWire/IEEE-1394) makes sense for you. </s>
<s> If you just need to move the occasional document, it may not, but if you move entire projects or need active back-up of your stuff, it may make better sense... </s>

<s> I recently got a &quot;My Flash&quot; 1G online for a very good price. </s>
<s> I first did a Google search for a &quot;1G USB&quot; and then went to one of the price comparison sites to find what I wanted for the best price. </s>
<s> You should also check local weekly sales at such places as Staples, Office Max, etc. </s>
<s> They sometimes have outrageous sales. </s>
<s> I recently had a friend pick up a 512 USB for $15. </s>
<s> And thats it! </s>
<s> Office Max, Staples, Circuit City and Comq USA all have had the 1Gbyte for $25 the past few weeks (rebate) and 512 Mbyte for $ 15-18.00. </s>
<s> Yes the Cruzers have a nice, tough body. </s>
<s> But they are all just memory chips and unless you know who provides the vendor the CHIPS buy by price. </s>
<s> With the advent of Large, large scale Chips which is replacing discrete electronic components and everything is manufacture in China or Indonoesia......quality is more uniform. </s>
<s> If u buy from retailers like Staples, CC, ZipZoomFly, and Newegg, this shouldn't be an issue. </s>
<s> I'm not sure ot the extent they test for opened returns and refurbs, but even so, u could get your $$ back on grounds of defectiveness. </s>
<s> If purchasing from a site where more dubious selling conditions are possible like ebay, u'll wanna check that your 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB flash memory can really hold that capacity. </s>
<s> Sometimes they just use 32MB to 512MB chipsets and disguish it so Windows sees the full, claimed capacity. </s>
<s> When u go and try to use all that capacity however, u get corruption errors since that extra capacity in truth does not exist. </s>
<s> A simple to perform is to write a single 900MB file onto a 1GB flash memory, and then try to read or load off it. </s>
<s> While USB speeds vary betw PCs, if you're certain it keeps writing/reading &quot;infinitely&quot;, then you may have a fake capacity. </s>
<s> I got an retail Memorex 512MB USB flash memory from Staples just under a year ago. </s>
<s> It costed $20 w/o requiring any MIRs. </s>
<s> Came with driver CD, lanyard, and warranty info. </s>
<s> One day, I couldn't find it. </s>
<s> Searched everywhere I could've thought of, but nowhere to be found I got an OEM Memorex 1GB flash mem for $32 back in early April this year from 3bTech. </s>
<s> It's just the module and the protective cap over the plug. </s>
<s> Bought some lanyards from a one-dollar store and strung that up. </s>
<s> As of now, it hasn't failed on me yet. </s>
<s> I'm partial to the SanDisk Cruzer, and Staples has them on sale this week--after all the rebates it's $22.98 for 1GB. </s>
<s> If you have a brand you like, I'd just wait until they go on sale and try to get the lowest price you can. </s>
<s> I've never had any major problems with Staple's mail in rebates, but some ppl do NOT like them at all. </s>
<s> U can still get cheap stuff w/o MIRs, but u'll need to be patient, and your selection will be less </s>
<s> Just got a 1GB Corsair flash drive from New Egg for $24.99 which included free 3 day shipping. </s>
<s> I ordered it Tuesday and already have it. </s>
<s> There were many good reviews for this particular flash drive so I thought I would mention it. </s>
<s> It comes with a lanyard, CD for Win98 (should anyone have that), and an extension. </s>
<s> Seemed like a good deal. </s>
