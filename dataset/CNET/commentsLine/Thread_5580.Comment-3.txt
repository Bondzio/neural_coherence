you have done most the easier things to do.
most the tools that monitor utilization on a pc work fairly well and unless you are running virtual machines they see all the traffic.
this means it is most likely something you are not running there tools on.
the only common point all this has is your router.
most consumer routers do not have any ability to keep historic data on traffic and most cannot even tell you what is running right this instant.
you have to get a data collection device in the path.
what you want is a feature that is generally part of a traffic shaper or intrusion detection device.
most are extremely expensive hardware devices but free user written linux versions exist.
you still would be placing a device into your network.
i think you are on the right track with the tomato or dd-wrt method.
this is the ever changing world of user developed software but they had a version of netflow that would track session information as well as some tools used for security logging.
there are also lots of commands that let you see whats going on in the router live so you may get lucky and see you bad guy.
been a while since i played with this.
like most &quot;free&quot; things you are trading your time figuring it out instead of paying money to the companies who make the appliances to do this.
