<s> I just installed my mom's wireless router for her. </s>
<s> Long story short, it took six hours. </s>
<s> Who knew that the only WEP key that would work correctly is the first of the four? </s>
<s> Why even give me for if three of them don't work. </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm terribly concerned about this new fangled wireless internet. </s>
<s> I have two Bellsouth Fastaccess DSL connections in my house. </s>
<s> The one I'm posting from now is mine and a trip to dslreports.com tells me that I'm sitting pretty at a 2980kbps download speed. </s>
<s> My upload speed is a meager 319kbps, but that's not what the problem here is. </s>
<s> My mom's DSL, post-wireless connection, is chugging along at about 150kbps down . </s>
<s> That's awful. </s>
<s> Her upload speed is fine, it's in the 290's. </s>
<s> I checked her speed before I switched her over to wireless and it was going just fine at about 2900Kbps. </s>
<s> I was using her connection for a long time because mine was accidentally cancelled by the geniuses at Bellsouth. </s>
<s> And I never experienced terrible connection speeds. </s>
<s> Wireless isn't suppose to do this to a connection, right? </s>
<s> Are there any settings I'm missing the resolve this issue? </s>
<s> The icon in her system tray says that it's connected at like 54Mbps. </s>
<s> We've got two laptops and a printer on the wireless network. </s>
<s> One laptop is running Windows 2000 and the other is running Windows Vista. </s>
<s> The router is a &quot;Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router&quot; with.. get this.. &quot;Speed Booster&quot; . </s>
<s> It's 2.4Ghz, whatever that means, and the model number is WRT54GS. </s>
<s> Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Oh, and Happy Easter. </s>
<s> What you did to check that the units were not on the same RF channel (I read your post twice and it appears you have 2 wifi routers.) </s>
<s> Or how you tested your site to see which channel is not used as much in your neighborhood. </s>
<s> What many forget is that when we go wireless we now SHARE the air around us. </s>
<s> Besides the items I noted so far a recurring glitch is out of date firmware and no one reads the manuals or takes a class. </s>
<s> But it's fun to dive in and figure out this stuff. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll be checking the drivers to make sure they're up to date the next chance I get. </s>
<s> My other router is actually not wired, I've only got the one wireless router. </s>
<s> How would I check to see what channel is not used as much in my neighborhood? </s>
<s> I only pick up on one other wireless network in my neighborhood. </s>
<s> The FIRMWARE in the router is often out of date and/or buggy. </s>
<s> As to the channels, not only could a neighbor be on the same channel but who's saying it's WIFI. </s>
<s> So we test at channels 1, 5 (or 6) and 11 to see what works best. </s>
