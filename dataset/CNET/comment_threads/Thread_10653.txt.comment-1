I recently updated my 64 GB Wifi/3G iPad to iOS 4.2.1 and now my iPad Mail app cannot get my mail from the Yahoo!
Server.
It tells me I need to enter the password.
After I enter the password it takes forever &quot;verifying&quot; then tells me &quot;The IMAP server &quot;apple.imap.mail.yahoo.com&quot; is not responding.
Check your network connection and that you entered the correct information in the &quot;incoming Mail Server&quot; field.&quot; I cannot find any &quot;incoming Mail Server&quot; field and the outgoing mail server fields are grayed out so I cannot make changes.
I can still get the mail when I go to the Yahoo!
Web site using Safari.
Does anyone know what the problem is or have suggestions?
I didn't have any problem getting the mail prior to my software upgrade.
