If not, continue to boot into safe mode and take a second listen. If the sound is only heard when Windows fully loads, it's a background process accessing the hard drive. What process that is may not be simple to find. These aren't unusual. Your computer just doesn't always sit there and wait for you to input something. It does stuff on it's own.
