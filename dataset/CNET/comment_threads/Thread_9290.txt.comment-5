Didn't get round to delting the quarantine in spybot - all of a sudden the computer started to recognise the drives again without me doing anything extra.
I did try to roll back with system restore but got an error on that as soon as I opened it telling me that it could not protect my computer and to restart.
It seemed to be after this restart that it all worked again.
Very Odd!!!
