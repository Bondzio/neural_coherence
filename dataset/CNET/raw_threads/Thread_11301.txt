The version with the six-cell battery runs for $300. I'm seriously tempted... I actually played around with the Acer Aspire 751 at Office Max, although they had the version with Vista on it. I also looked at the Gateway LT31 series at Best Buy, which is quite similar in form factor, although the internals are different. In any case, I'm a fan of the 11.6&quot; screen and full-size keyboard. But that Atom Z-series processor is holding me back... even if I uninstall all the bloatware, add another gig of RAM, how well would this thing perform? I wouldn't use it to watch full-screen video, although regular YouTube or Hulu viewing would be nice... although even that is not essential to me. Browsing and office apps, perhaps with playing MP3s simultaneously, is as demanding as it would get. I know that the Acer Aspire 1410 can be had for $450, but that's still significantly more expensive than $280-300. I wouldn't use it all that often anyway. So, do any of you have the AO751h with XP? Would you recommend it? Thanks in advance.

And I see no reason to bump the RAM. I only use it for running out of the office for demos, patching up our applications so my view is that it is no laptop replacement. It's a fine get out there for cheap spare laptop (but it's no laptop!) bob

Some have said that uninstalling these free and trial apps helped speed up the computer somewhat. I don't have time to find the URLs to these reviews (go to CNet, Amazon, etc.) but they're not difficult to find.

I'm not sure what you are insinuating here, I certainly do not &quot;know more than (I) let on in this post.&quot; I did buy the Dell Mini 10v a couple of months ago, but I returned it a week later. I didn't care for its keyboard. The Mini 10v had the Atom N270 CPU with the 1024x576 screen. The Aspire 751 has a slower Atom Z520 CPU that must drive a higher resolution 1366x768 display, which has nearly 50% more pixels. I think it's perfectly fair for me to ask whether there's a significant performance hit between these two machines.

My desktop is my primary machine, so I don't necessarily need a laptop to replace or substitute it with. As they say, the netbook would complement my desktop. I'd rather not lug around a six-pound laptop with a 15.6&quot; screen. You'd also have to carry around the power supply with one of those as well, whereas you wouldn't necessarily have to do that with a netbook that has a six-cell battery, making it an even more lightweight and compact solution.

It's running Office 2003, Visual Studio, our apps and so much more. I can say I won't be upgrading its RAM or anything else. Our application is Bluetooth centric so I did add the small Bluetooth adapter. It's the same size as the Logitech v450 Nano Mouse's adapter. There are zero performance issues to date. And the 6 cell version is hovering at 300 bucks so not a budget buster. Bob
