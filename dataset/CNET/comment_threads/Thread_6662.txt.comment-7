I think i already have some idea why it doesn't work in windows.
I do not have the RAID controller driver for my chipset installed on my system.
It is from VIA.
Actually there is some problem as reported by many other users due to which the VIA raid controller driver for my chipset starts throwing BSODs.
The only workaround for the problem is, if you do not have a raid configuration then don't install the RAID driver.
Thats what i have done.
And that may be the reason why WD diagnostics doesn't work in windows.
But since my system is working fine, i really don't care about the RAID driver.
By the DOS diagnostics, i am atleast assured that my HD is fine.
