well lets start off with the basics.
the hard drive is a thin mettallic layer of magnetic material.
this magnetic material is divided into clusters, pipes, sectors and all that fun jazz.
what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer, namely the clusters.
when chkdsk finds these errors on the platter (the term for the hard drive) it will attempt to fix these.
it will not go through your files and fix them.
