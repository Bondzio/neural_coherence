It recognized the change to 2GB, but then I got 5 blue screen errors and shut-downs in 2 hours. Never happened before. Before removing the new stick (yes, it's seated correctly), I decided to run the memory test that's on the Ubuntu Linux install disk. It's been going for well over 3 hours now, and I have to go to bed sometime! Is this normal? If it ever finishes, will it give a simple &quot;result&quot;, telling me for instance, that my new memory stick is bad? I'd hate to shut it off now and have to re-start it again when I have all day!

I won't write much about the Ubuntu memory test but from memory it runs forever because memory is only good when in use and you have issues like temperature, power stability and more that means a test has to run forever while you may want it to run once and point out the issue. As it stands I can't say it's a RAM issue. It could be that adding more RAM taxed the power supply a little more, blocked some air flow or that RAM is used for video display and isn't quite compatible. Try this. Exchange the 2 sticks. That is take the one in slot one and place in slot two and the one in slot two to slot one. No. I can't cure the industry. Bob

I swapped the two sticks, and used each one individually, but whenever the new one was in there I still got blue-screen errors and immediate shutdowns; so quick I couldn't read all it said. But everything I did read, there and in Event Viewer, pointed to a RAM problem, so it's being returned for exchange. A useful memory tester would still be nice, but in this case I didn't have to tax my brain to figure out what the problem was. Simple problem-solving techniques usually work well.
