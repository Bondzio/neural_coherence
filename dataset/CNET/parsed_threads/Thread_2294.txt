<s> I woud like to connect my two laptops together to be able to transfer files from one pc to another. </s>
<s> For the life of me i cannot figure it out. </s>
<s> can someone help me please? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> What do you mean ''wirelessly''? </s>
<s> I would say share the folder and then access the computer by typing ''\\&lt;computername&gt;'' in the run dialogue. </s>
<s> Personally for security reasons I would say go buy a cat5 link cable (my mind went blank can't think of the name of this cabling specifically) but its a slight increase in price and it allows you to directly connect two computers for the transferring of files etc, connects through an ethernet port btw. </s>
<s> Hope this helps.. </s>
<s> But the most common gaffe (mistake) is that people will install a firewall without knowing how it works. </s>
<s> Setup the WiFi to adhoc mode, then share the folder. </s>
<s> Works for me. </s>
