I already have an internal CD - Writer that came w / my machine. My question is, should I remove the CD - Writer, or install the burner also. If I do remove the writer, can I hook it up just like the writer?

Alot depends on your usage, so take it from there. Install both for now and if you feel later you're really not getting the use out of both, then stick with the new. Yes, you can install the new burner as your old, but remember to remove/delete any old s/w related to the old drive. tada -----Willy
