I have a GeForce 5200 128mb video card, and the fan has become very noisy, especially on startup.
It is about a year old, but I can't find any warrenty information on it (manufacturer is Interage, purchased at Sam's Club).
My gaming consists of Madden and other sports games.
What can I do with this?
My brother suggests unplugging the fan, but that doesn't sound like a good option to me.
Any information is appreciated.
