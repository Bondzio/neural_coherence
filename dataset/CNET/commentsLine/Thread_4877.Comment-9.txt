xeno, tell me something, did you lower the brightness down and the contrast?
what are your settings?
i also noticed then when the screen is set to 100% black, there is some light bleeding from the background around the edges, do you have the same problem too?
what about video playback?
on mine when i played my seinfeld dvd it looked all grainy.
does your do the same thing as well?
now, don't get me wrong, i really find this monitor way above average, but this is my first lcd, so that is i am being a bit more critical about it.
thanks for your reply.
