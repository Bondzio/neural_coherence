i have a late 2007 mbp 2.2 ghz intel core 2 duo with an upgraded 4 gb 667 mhz ddr2 sdram and an upgraded 500 gb wdc drive which is running fine but when i'm running video files this laptop is cooking at sometimes 200 degrees fahrenheit with the fan running at 5000-6000 rpm.
i often have this laptop sitting on my legs and needless to say it gets pretty uncomfortable unless i put a pillow or something between the bottom of my mpb and my legs, so i was thinking of replacing my hd with an ssd.
however, i don't know what i would need to do so and was wondering if you happened to know what i would need (or if i need anything) other than the ssd.
i currently only use about 185 gb of this drive so i'm figuring i could probably easily get away with a 256gb replacement.
do you have any recommendations or tips on where i need to start?
if i lived close to a apple store i'd go in and visit them but unfortunately the nearest one is about 100 miles away - and while i had to do that once to have them replace my video card (which fortunately was under warranty) i don't like to make that trip often because that's a $50 bill in just gas alone, not to mention the time it takes.
