1.1.1	Hi guys , Need advice on whether or not I should upgrade my rig .	St
1.1.2	It has served me well for the past 3.5 years .	St
1.1.3	I plan to upgrade the following components as my 670 gtx is perfectly fine : i7 920 === & gt ; i5 3570k ASUS P6T === & gt ; ASUS P8Z77-V PRO Windows 7 premium 64 === & gt ; Windows 8 Do you think there is a need right now if my primary purpose is gaming ( Planetside 2 for example ) ?	Ques
1.1.4	My i7 920 is stock and overclocking on air is not an option where I live especially during summer .	St
1.2.1	I think your going to spend a bunch of bucks and not get much .	St
1.2.2	920 & gt ; 3570 ... ... there will be a bump in cpu perf ... .as to how that will xlate to some game ... ..unknown .	St
1.2.3	I doubt it will much .	St
1.2.4	W7 & gt ; W8 ... ... No ... ... Let the dust settle with W8 .	St
1.2.5	Get enough ram that the swap file stays quiet while your gaming .	St
1.2.6	If your games are hammering your HD for data ... ... think about a SSD or a hybrid .	St
1.3.1	& quot ; Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $ 225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $ 1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X , even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved .	St
1.3.2	It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput do n't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines .	St
1.3.3	& quot ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html A long time ago tests changing motherboards yielded single digit performance changes .	St
1.3.4	Rarely pays off .	St
1.3.5	The same thing with OS changes but 7 does have an edge on compatibility for now .	St
1.3.6	Bob	St
