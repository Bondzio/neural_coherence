1.1.1	Hi i am looking for some professional type of information about this.	St
1.1.2	Is window,s own defragmenter utility good enough or I need another one?	St
1.1.3	If so, is there free one.	St
1.1.4	How often I should defragment my HD.	St
1.1.5	And does it really increases performance.	St
1.1.6	Can frequent defragmentation decrease the physical quality of disk or its life?	St

1.3.1	http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=58776&messageID=697851 There are similarly other discussions that you can read and decide.	St

1.4.1	all I could see were a lot of opinions, that gave me no idea who is right or wrong, infact i could not read all, a lot of stuff.	St
1.4.2	may be wanted some spoon feeding.	St
1.5.1	No answer.	St
1.5.2	While you could run the defragmenter once a year or month and easily say that's better than none at all, beyond that the analysis gets tangled up in how the PC is used and more.	St
1.5.3	There is no right answer here.	St
1.5.4	Once you figure that out, you cand run defrag once a month and forget about it.	St
