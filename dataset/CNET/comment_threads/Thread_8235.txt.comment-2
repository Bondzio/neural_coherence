This could be caused by a number of things: 1.
CDs and DVDs became corupt by some external influence 2.
The optic drive's optics are misaligned 3.
The laser head is dirty I choose #3.
Purchase a lens cleaner CD and use it.
If that fails a new drive is in order.
Less than $50 for a new DVD+/- drive.
and life goes on... Jack
