From your post it may be that you didn't know about the heat sink compound.
It's about ONE DOLLAR of compound so I'd remove the heat sink one more time to wipe off the old and apply about ONE DOLLAR of heat sink compound and button it up.
Worst case is the motherboard was damaged.
That can be painful as this is a Lenovo and if we change to a generic board the XP license dies with the motherboard.

The next failure could be the CPU fried from lack of the heatsink.
While I may get the wrong CPU, Pentium 4 CPU's came in a variety of packages and are now plentiful on Ebay and other places for not much.
