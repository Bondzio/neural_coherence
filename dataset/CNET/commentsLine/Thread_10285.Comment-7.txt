bob, you have been very forthcoming with assistance and i appreciate the help, but the issue you are addressing is not the issue i'm having.
our clients have never had a problem with being able to get through to our dedicated fax line.
the incoming faxes are consistently received by the fax machine, are stored in the unit's memory and are available to be reprinted as hardcopy.
my problem is that the software that came with the hp professes to be able to save those incoming faxes as pdfs but it does not always work correctly.
so, as a result i always end up having to choose the &quot;reprint last&quot; function on the machine and go through the various previous faxes until i find the one that hp toolboxfx failed to save.
which ends up using all the toner and paper i was attempting to conserve.
i understand this may be a windows issue, but i can't get away from windows at this point, so i just need to find a machine with better software.
to recap: i'm not trying to find a fix for frustrations with faulty faxlines, friend.
i'm simply soliciting suggestions for setups with a superior software solution.
