<s> I'm new to this, so bear with me, please. </s>
<s> My mom just got a digital camera (an HP Photosmart M420) with a Lexar 256MB SD card, and she took it to Las Vegas. </s>
<s> While she was there, the camera displayed the message, &quot;CARD HAS THE WRONG FORMAT. </s>
<s> Press OK to format card.&quot; When I press OK, it says, &quot;Unable to format card.&quot; So, I put the card in my computer (it has an internal card reader) and it will not even recognize that there IS a card in the slot. </s>
<s> The same happens with external card readers and other digital cameras. </s>
<s> I realize that the card is probably shot, but I'm trying to figure out a way to recover the images/videos from her vacation. </s>
<s> I downloaded Lexar's Image Rescue, but it apparently won't work if the card can't be recognized. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I appreciate it. </s>

<s> Here's HP's link for the topic: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/fastFaqLiteDocument?docname=c00038738&lc=en&cc=za&dlc=za Surf for more details there. </s>
<s> Also, I suggest you stick with the camera format itself rather than the PC side. </s>
<s> If this recent purchase, then contact HP and allow them to correct or replace memory card. </s>
<s> Cards can be corrupted for various reasons and not to exclude a bad memory card to a &quot;new user&quot; . </s>
