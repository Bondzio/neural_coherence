I rebooted it, and immediately went to it again. I tried going into the BIOS, and tried CD ROM first. I have a Windows XP Service Pack CD(I forgot to mention I have that version of Windows), and tried that. When I put it in my CD ROM drive, it goes in, does nothing, and the door opens up. So, I put it in the DVD and it spins, but nothing happens. I have tried F8, F10, and nothing. There are tons of files, pics, that I really can't lose. Please help. Thank you.

We pull that hard disk out and set it aside. A new blank drive is put in and we install the OS, drivers and get the machine working. If your CD dose not boot we fix that too (new CD, new CD drive, whatever it takes.) Now that we have a working machine we add the old drive on the slave or other connections and get our files back.

Nothing to be ashamed of. When my daughters laptop needed a new hard disk (well, it turned out it needed a new motherboard) I went to repairshop also. Kees
