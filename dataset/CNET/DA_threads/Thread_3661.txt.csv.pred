1.1.1	I need to know the signs of a failing power supply .	St
1.1.2	My computer is constantly crashing and locks up , then reboots .	St
1.1.3	The power supply is running hot most of the time ( the fan is working ) It crashes and reboots the same way with Windows XP , Windows 98SE and Windows ME .	St
1.1.4	The RAM tested ok. ( 512MB DDR ) .	St
1.1.5	The HDD tested ok no errors .	St
1.1.6	I have 2 additional exhaust fans installed .	St
1.1.7	Internal system temp is 78F CPU temp is 115F .	St
1.1.8	I shut this computer down and borrowed another computer to use in the mean time .	St
1.1.9	I do n't want to risk destroying the motherboard with the power supply shorting out .	St
1.1.10	I have n't taken it in for testing yet , but should I consider replacing the power supply anyway ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	with a known good PS .	St
1.2.2	If the reboots stop , you have the answer .	St
1.3.1	Unfortunely , a weak p/s unit causes all havoc and just makes the system flaky in general .	St
1.3.2	P/S problem can effect all aspects of the system , so you really ca n't trust anything .	St
1.3.3	Thus , the quickest fix is to replace/swap .	St
1.3.4	But , you mentioned your heat is hot , that alone can effect the p/s worthiness as it starts to falter under such conditions .	St
1.3.5	Leave the side cover off the system and it seems to settle down , you truly got a & quot ; heat problem & quot ; .	St
1.3.6	Further , you can place a household fan to better cool the innards and it really settles down , you found a heat problem .	St
1.3.7	That being the case , damage maybe already done and replacement may still be called for on the p/s or any other fan ( s ) , plusa they have to sucking in air and exhausting it as well at a rate capable of cooling the system .	St
1.3.8	Air circualation is must to better help air flow through out the system case .	St
1.3.9	A good p/s unit should be 400W+ or better and be a quality build unit as well , so pick a namebrand if that what it comes down to .	St
1.3.10	Hope this helps ... enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	That is , if they are valid readings .	St
1.4.2	Have you checked for bulging or leaking capacitors ?	Ques
1.4.3	The large ones located around the CPU .	St
1.4.4	What did you test the memory with ?	Ques
1.4.5	For how long ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.6	Probably much cheaper to put a new supply in than pay someone to check it out .	St
1.4.7	Have you done the complete gamut of things to do to eliminate spyware , parasites et al ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.8	?	Ques
1.5.1	take the side cover off and leave it that way .	Sug
1.5.2	The case is designed to be closed for proper airflow .	St
1.5.3	You will get more dust inside as well .	St
1.5.4	Just swap out the power supply and see what happens .	St
1.6.1	What size is you power supply ?	Ques
1.6.2	Also look for swolen or leaking capactors on the mother board .	St
1.6.3	Any way per A+ stuff the first thing is to replace the power supply .	St
1.6.4	John	St
1.7.1	I decided to replace the power supply , the computer responded well , no problems .	St
1.7.2	I had the system temp sensor tested , it was ok .	St
1.7.3	It was just the power supply itself that was running hot and malfunctioning .	St
1.7.4	Everything is back to normal .	St
1.7.5	It is still running well .	St
1.7.6	P.S .	St
1.7.7	this was the first time I had a power supply unit fail in my own equipment .	St
1.7.8	This was a great lesson learned .	Polite
1.7.9	I know what to look for in the future .	St
1.7.10	Thanks to everyone .	St
