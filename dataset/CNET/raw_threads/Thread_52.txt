Specs: CPU: Quad Core Q6600 MB: Asus P5N-D RAM: Kingston Hyper X 2GB HDD: Seagate Terabyte GFX: NVidia GeForce 8500 OS: Vista Ultimate 32 bit The question i now ask is will crysis warhead run on my PC? i downloaded the original crysis singleplayer demo and turned the spec way down, this caused it to look horrible...which doesn't suprise me neither does it appeal to me. The reason i now ask this is because apparently they optimized crysis warhead to run far better on a wider range of pcs (im guessing lower spec). So what is your opinion do you think it will run at an acceptable level?

You may have to look at &quot;the list&quot; and see how far up you can go on that list. -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/Best-Graphics-Card,2011.html Bob
