1.2.1	time to read.	St
1.2.2	PS - Might want to start by adding RAM ... 256 RAM ain't not enough for fast anything under Windows.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Affordable ...that's relative to your means.... but spending a few bucks on 256MBs RAM may be better than burning up an entire PC while overclocking it.	St
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	if not then just change the settings in bios.	St
1.5.2	google overclock to learn what to change.	St
1.5.3	as for the gfx card, just download nvtweak (coolbits) google that for the download.	St
1.5.4	and i agree with the ram upgrade.	St
1.5.5	pc133 is cheaper than pc100...i have a 256mb pc133 made by pny unused.	St
1.5.6	i rememeber i got it for around 12 bucks after rebates.	St
1.5.7	i bought the wrong ram, my computer used pc100 which i found cost more than pc133.	St
1.5.8	it originally came with128 and i bought another 128 for 50 bucks and have seen no improvement to date.	St
1.5.9	waste of money.	St
1.5.10	but if u can, upgrade to 512 as it probably would show some improvement.	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	...you need more than 256MB of RAM.	St
1.7.2	I didn't even know that they made P4 motherboards that use SDRAM; you'll be much better off getting a new CPU and board; post the rest of your system specs, though; you might be better off with a whole new PC.	St
1.8.1	out of the current machine with that amount of memory.	St
1.8.2	Exactly what make model and revision is your motherboard....if you're not 100% sure run CPUZ and tell us what it says about your motherbioard mfg and model number..	St
1.9.1	what is the highest and most stable oc i can do on my opteron 170, post the numbers, i want to stay under .5v thanks	Ques
1.10.1	Intel 845 is a chipset ...again...Exactly what make model and revision is your motherboard....if you're not 100% sure run CPUZ and tell us what it says about your motherbioard mfg and model number.	St
1.10.2	Re OPTY....it really just depends on your system components.	St
1.10.3	What do you mean by 'stay under .5V' ??	Ques
1.10.4	?	Ques
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	...you should get your Opty to 2.4GHz+	Sug
1.13.1	my p4 is an mtiac mobo, no model number stated bt cpu-z, and on my opty i got a zalman 9500 LED, 2 gigs of corsair xms with heat spreader, 2 120mm fans going at 5000 rpm, a 90mm fan going at 7000 rpm, artic silver 5 liberally appplied, each fan producing 80 fan movement, and its in a poor man's btx mode.	St
1.14.1	...especially with the XMS RAM.	St
1.14.2	Good luck.	St
1.15.1	What video card do you have in the AMD ?	Ques
1.15.2	Out of curiousity...why mess with the P4 for games when you've got an Opteron 170 and 2GBs RAM.	St
1.15.3	BTW...couldn't find anything at all on mtiac...so are you saying it says nothing in CPUZ under the the 'Mainboard' tab ?	Ques
1.15.4	VAPCMD PS...Liberal use of Arctic Silver is usally counterproductive...suggest rereading the mfgs directions...it's use should be more like Brylcreem..' a little dab will do ya !	St
1.16.1	nothin on the mainboard tab, weird huh?	St
1.17.1	So what part of the OPTY system doesn't meet your gaming needs ?	Ques
1.17.2	You could certainly upgrade the video in the event that hasn't got enough umph.	St
1.17.3	VAPCMD	St
1.18.1	NIL	St
1.19.1	NIL	St
1.20.1	The two processors in question are so close performance wise it's really a matter of how deep are your pockets and what's your time worth ?	Ques
1.20.2	Like with most everything however, there comes a point of diminishing return where the cost for the faster processor or bigger hard drive just doesn't make sense...and only you can decide where that sweet spot is for you.	St
1.21.1	NIL	St
1.22.1	...you shouldn't bother, just for a couple extra MHz.	St
