<s> Okay, I have a couple of question about adding a video card into my computer. </s>
<s> I have the following: Brand: Compaq Presario SR2170NX Pentium 4 1 GB of RAM Radeon Xpress 1100 on board memory (128 dedicated and 128 shared) Vista OS Okay, now for the questions: 1. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of getting the Radeon x1300 256 mb pci-express graphic card. </s>
<s> Is this a good card for my computer? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Will it work with my computer? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Should I get the Pro version of Radeon x1300? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Also, it states this: 350-Watt power supply or greater recommended (assumes fully loaded system). </s>
<s> What does fully loaded system mean? </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if my system has a 350-watt power supply or greater? </s>
<s> (I don't want to open up my computer right now). </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, could I buy any 350-watt power supply for my computer? </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> Can my computer take a higher watt power supply or does it not matter? </s>
<s> 8. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I need to buy if I want to install the graphic card? </s>
<s> 9. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> http://www.epinions.com/Hewlett_Packard_HP_SR2170NX_Compaq_Presario_Desktop_PC_RK549AA_ABA/display_~full_specs Describes your computer, but probably a trip to HP's website would give you more details. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Will it work with my computer? </s>
<s> YES you have a slot for PCI-Express 3. </s>
<s> Should I get the Pro version of Radeon x1300? </s>
<s> Don't know your graphic's requirements. </s>
<s> If you are a super intensive gamer, probably if thats the brand you like. </s>
<s> What does fully loaded system mean? </s>
<s> Enough devices and power consuming gear to max out 350W. </s>
<s> If its configured as you bought it, one drive and one optical drive and not too much USB power requirements, you should be OK with what you already have. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> Can my computer take a higher watt power supply or does it not matter? </s>
<s> Yes, no not usually. </s>
<s> Bigger is usually better in this case. </s>
<s> You will need to know how to go into setup and disable your existing onboard video and how to uninstall its driver. </s>
<s> the x1300 *will not* give you any substantial improvement in vista's general performance. </s>
<s> unless you plan on playing games like world of warcraft or need for speed, the integrated graphics are fine. </s>
<s> if you still want to upgrade your graphics, get at least a radeon x1650pro or a geforce 7600gs. </s>
<s> both are about $105 from web hardware shops and both will work fine with your 350w power supply. </s>
<s> is at most 350 watts, and probably 300. </s>
<s> And the reviews i've read of ati are good at hardware, bad at software. </s>
<s> So, given how early it is with Vista still, I'd hunt down an nvidia card that specifies vista compatible. </s>
<s> With a high performance graphics card you should have a powersupply higher than the recommended. </s>
<s> But just so that you know, I have a dell with an ati x1900 that supposedly needs that big power too, and I kept my power supply. </s>
<s> Seems to work fine. </s>
<s> I wouldn't worry about the power requirement, unless I was getting one of those super expensive top of the line graphics cards. </s>
<s> And even then, I'd not replace the powersupply unless the card seemed to be giving me trouble. </s>
<s> My dad has a compaq too, and they're pretty stock power supplies from what I can see. </s>
<s> Unlike dell that isn't even shaped like a stock. </s>
<s> So if you DO need a power supply, it should be pretty easy to find. </s>
<s> Those new graphics cards have their own hookups now directly to the power supply. </s>
<s> And some of them even 2! </s>
<s> So watch that when getting one. </s>
<s> Ok so I own the same computer: http://www.dealtime.com/xPF-Hewlett-Packard-HP-SR2170NX-Compaq-Presario-Desktop-PC and am looking to upgrade so I can play ElderScrolls Oblivian. </s>
<s> I was looking at the Nvidia e-GeForce 6200 LE 256MB DDR2 PCIe Video Card: http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0281568 Will this work with the computer. </s>
<s> It has the PCI express slot but I wasn't sure if vista, the motherboard, or the onboard radeon xpress 1100 would cause problems when I put in the new Nvidia. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Have the same system as the first post..was wondering what kind of upgrade i would need in order to play warhammer online...just upgraded my ram but the gameplay is still choppy any help is appreciated </s>
