<s> Hi all, I'm building myself a new &quot;budget&quot; PC as the old P4 one is getting ancient now The components I selected are as follows: CPU : INTEL Core 2 Duo E7200 2,53GHz (1066MHz) 3MBL2 WOLFDALE LGA775 - BOX VGA : ASUS EN8800GT/HTDP/256MB or 8800GTS (I'm still not sure but I'm probably getting the GT as its quite cheaper ) MB : GIGABYTE Sc 775 EP45-DS3, Intel P45 RAM : DIMM DDR2 2GB, 1066MHz, A-DATA, CL5-5-5-12 (KIT 2x1GB) Extreme Edition HDD : WD CAVIAR BLUE WD3200AAKS 320GB, 16MB cache Case : REDSTAR Happy16,400W,12cm fan Questions: Does this look like a nice &quot;ballanced&quot; PC build? </s>
<s> Is it OK to buy a case from Redstar? </s>
<s> Is 400watt PSU enough to supply all the power even if I buy the GTS video card? </s>
<s> Note: I'll be running XP, I'll update to vista only when it's absolutely needed (I want to keep my XP as long as possible) Thanks, J.M. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> I have an all too similar system that peaks out at 165 Watts on the AC meter (I have a Watt meter.) </s>
<s> So that gives you a 50 percent load on the 400 Watt PSU. </s>
<s> If you load up the machine with much more I'd shop for a new PSU if you ever suffer random reboots. </s>
<s> In closing ask the supplier that the motherboard be supplied with the current BIOS version F7 so you don't have to learn why. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> no-name power supplies usually can't handle the draw from a good video card. </s>
<s> look for a 450-500w from a brand like antec, cooler master, corsair, ocz or seasonic. </s>
<s> you should be able to find one for $45-$60USD. </s>
<s> to offset the extra cost of the power supply, stick with ddr2-800 cl4. </s>
<s> unless you plan on overclocking, there will be hardly any performance difference. </s>
<s> also, save a few dollars and stick with a gigabyte ep35-ds3 since the only significant difference between it and an ep45 is pci-express 2.0 slot (but pci-e 2.0 cards work fine in 1.0 slots). </s>
<s> the bios is also more mature on the ep35. </s>
<s> The EP35 mainboard has the intel P35 chipset which is to my understanding inferior to P45. </s>
<s> To the PSU, well the whole case is $60 including psu with 12cm fan, I dont want to spend another $60 on a psu if its not absolutely needed... What can happen if the power supply gets overpowered? </s>
<s> Can this damage any of my components? </s>
<s> Ok and last question, is there any noticable performance drop by running the RAM on different clock than the CPU, or it does not care? </s>
<s> In my original configuration they both run @1066mhz. </s>
<s> Thanks again, J.M. </s>
<s> saying the p35 is &quot;worse&quot; is like saying the '07 bmw 535i is worse than the '08 model. </s>
<s> the p35 is the most mature and stable chipset for core2duo/quad. </s>
<s> the p45 adds pci-express 2.0 support and xmp profiles (only of benefit on ddr3 or while overclocking). </s>
<s> if you want to build a budget pc that won't require a lot of fuss, a p35 based mobo is a solid choice. </s>
<s> if you want to help shake out the bugs/kinks in the bios of p45 based mobos (which only launched 45 days ago), then be my guest. </s>
<s> either will support any current/future core2duo/quad but neither will support bloomfield (nehalem). </s>
<s> http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/mainboards/display/asus-p5q3-deluxe_11.html#sect0 quote: The new Intel P45 Express chipset has no evident advantages over its predecessors. </s>
<s> Nevertheless, it is extremely interesting as a very new solution and for a number of objective reasons, such as the use of more advanced production process. </s>
<s> Therefore, enthusiasts pin a lot of hopes on Intel P45 expecting the boards on this new chipset to become one of the best overclocker platforms out there. </s>
<s> http://www.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTUxNSw0LCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA== almost no performance difference between p45 and p35. </s>
<s> http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2325039,00.asp tagline: We look at four P45 motherboards built using Intel's latest mainstream chipset. </s>
<s> Some are still a work in progress. </s>
<s> as for the power supply, don't expect a $60 case+power supply combo to last powering an 8800gt. </s>
<s> that's a nice midrange board attached to cheapo power supply. </s>
<s> a bad power supply can cause strange, hard to pinpoint errors (random shutdowns, freezes, lines on the screen, etc.) </s>
<s> and sometimes damage motherboards. </s>
<s> that's why i recommend you save $20 on your motherboard and another $25 on your memory -- the saving pay for a good power supply. </s>
<s> 1:1 memory ratios do perform the best, but the difference between ddr2-800 and ddr2-1066 is only noticeable in benchmarks. </s>
<s> 2 fps difference in games that already running at 115+fps (&lt;2%): http://www.anandtech.com/memory/showdoc.aspx?i=2867&p=3 </s>
<s> Hey thanks mate, you just saved me from paying extra money and getting nothing more! </s>
<s> what do you think about the P43 chipset? </s>
<s> So i decided to buy the PSU separately, this is what I found for cheap: Fortron 400W ATX-400PNR 12V v2.0 (silent 120mm FAN), do you think it's okay? </s>
<s> Looks good, I too would recommend a heavier supply, preferably 500w or more, Antec is good. </s>
<s> I would also probably stuff in another GB of DDR just in the event you might for some reason decide to go to Vista. </s>
<s> for an 8800gt. </s>
<s> the p43 is just as new as the p45 (it's the 'value'/low end model). </s>
<s> but if it's the same price as a p35 go for it. </s>
<s> remember that you *may* need to get one or two bios updates if run into problems. </s>
<s> btw, here's the link with benchmarks between ddr2-800 cl4 and ddr3-1066 cl5. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/memory/showdoc.aspx?i=2867&p=3 it was chopped off of the other post. </s>
