Proffitt	12/30/06 3:25 PM	1.1674923E12	I advise &quot;no.&quot;	http://www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium4/index.htm I see a few 3.8 GHz CPUs that may work but then again the gain is minimal. What is driving this need? Games? If so a graphics card will pay off. Bob

Your system has a built-in graphics CPU (vice a graphics card) and the memory to run it is borrowed from the system memory. You're OK re RAM but onboard video doesn't cut it for games. Adding a more powerful video card, one suitable for gaming, takes a more robust PSU. You could look for a video card that doesn't require more than a 300 WATT PSU but that will really limit your options. Good Luck and keep us posted. VAPCMD
