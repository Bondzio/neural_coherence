Really just to check if anything was loose, but if its risky,I'l leave it, unless he decides he is going to buy a new one.
He is holding the front together with tape at the moment, any ideas how to bend the front panel back into place?
When I had a look there were lots of small round marks round the edge but could not see any screws missing.
Thanks MF
