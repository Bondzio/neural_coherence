<s> Hello, Is it possible in any way for someone who is using a web-based form to enter & submit data to have a user defined IP address each time the user is logging in and out? </s>
<s> E.g: I have a form1 which has to use IP 122.230.255.255 and lets say form 2 to use another IP 123.230.255.255 Thanking you in advance for any positive help provided. </s>
<s> For information, i am on a network where the IP addresses are assigned automatically by my ISP and i dont want to use this IP, i want to use the specific ones which has been provided. </s>

<s> Back to the basics I guess. </s>
<s> 255 would be a broadcast address and not what we use for an address. </s>
<s> Here's more about that. </s>
<s> http://www.comptechdoc.org/independent/networking/guide/netaddressing.html &quot; The value of 255 is never used as an address for any part of the IP address. </s>
<s> It is reserved for broadcast addressing. </s>
<s> Please remember, this is exclusive of CIDR. </s>
<s> When using CIDR, all bits of the address can never be all ones. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I picked a wrong sample address i guess but my question still remains valid. </s>
<s> IP1: 122.2.120.0 IP2: 122.4.109.2 Rgds, Coolhans82 </s>
<s> http://serverfault.com/questions/10985/is-x-y-z-0-a-valid-ip-address and many other discussions abound. </s>
<s> I have serious doubts you will be getting far with such basic IP address issues. </s>
<s> Your question sounds as if you need some basic courses on WEB servers and how a log in works. </s>
<s> I've yet to find anyone use the IP address. </s>
