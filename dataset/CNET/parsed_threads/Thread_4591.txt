<s> During startup, a slight hiccough in 'The Microsoft Sound' fanfare is always experienced. </s>
<s> Same file, when played via Windows Media Player or Winamp is perfect This has just been of slight nuisance value until recently when I installed Yahoo Messenger beta for it's Worlwide calls. </s>
<s> Using Messenger, transmission is excellent (Apparently!) </s>
<s> but reception is badly broken up and I was wondering if there could be a connection between the two? </s>
<s> When a headset is connected to the speaker, the breakup is reduced somewhat. </s>
<s> I have substituted the original speakers without any improvement. </s>
<s> Any assistance would be most gratefully received. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> That hiccup is a sign that DMA is not enabled or the motherboard drivers were not installed. </s>
<s> In rare cases, you see this in low memory machines. </s>
<s> For that the cure is to up the ram to the 256 or 512M region. </s>

<s> 1022 Megabytes Installed Memory Via Audio Driver Setup is listed in the Add/Remove Program Properties window so I can only assume it to be installed? </s>
<s> As to DMA...It's all Greek to me! </s>
<s> You are dealing with an antique here...Me! </s>
<s> Might you advise as to how I might check/correct the DMA problem you mention? </s>
<s> Again thank you for the courtesy of your prompt reply.&quot; If that were true, I'd expect no sound at all. </s>
<s> There is some other issue here and that's the 1022 Megabytes or installed memory. </s>
<s> Windows 98se does fail in odd ways when you put it on a machine with more than 512M RAM. </s>
<s> As to DMA, there is not enough detail about your machine to comment about needed drivers. </s>
<s> But here is where the DMA is enabled -&gt; See figures 1 and 2 at http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-010694.htm You'll want DMA checked for hard disks and CD drives. </s>
<s> Bob Bob </s>
<s> Many thanks again for you equally prompt response...I'll get busy! </s>
<s> Whether successfully or no remains to be seen! </s>
<s> R.McL </s>
<s> All the appropriate DMA entries in hard disk and CD drives were checked as instructed and no changes were required. </s>
<s> &quot;In Control Panel/Multimedia/Multimedia Properties/C:Media WDM Audio Device/&quot;Status:Driver is enabled but inactive due to an unknown problem&quot; Additionally 'Use audio features on this device' is enabled.&quot; This is indeed the case as would be seen from a screen shot were I but able to attach one. </s>
<s> That just leaves the excessive memory problem you suggested, which leaves me up the creek without a paddle Again many thanks </s>
