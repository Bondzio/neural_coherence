Now I also have an 80gig IDE hard drive running Ubuntu; which I have from my old machine. The 80gig IDE ran perfectly with a different SATA hard drive in the old machine (all I had to do was switch the boot order to use either Ubuntu on the 80gig IDE or Windows 7 on the old SATA hard drive). I just recently tried bringing the 80gig IDE drive over to my new computer but it doesn't seem to be working. The Bios recognizes it as a 2500mb drive for some absurd reason. Any Ideas on how to get this to work? Additional Info: Mother Board: Asus A8-NE Jumper settings for the IDE drive: CS

I've seen this mainly if a RAID configuration is possible. If you select to use SATA, the corresponding IDE ports become unusable. Check your manual to see if this is the case.

While browsing the manual I came across this, &quot;If the hard disk was already formatted on a previous system, the setup BIOS may detect incorrect parameters. Select [Manual] to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters.&quot; After looking up the parameters for the hard drive, I tried to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters; however, I was not able to do so. The Sectors, Heads, and Cylinders all had adjustable values but when I set them to the proper values and hit enter, they just reset to the incorrect values. Any other suggestions? Thanks
