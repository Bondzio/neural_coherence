o.k.
heres the deal, i have a computer (old) that i'm supposed to fix, an emachines 366i2.
i connect the peripherals (keyboard/mouse) and as soon as i connect the power cable it turns on - on it's own but won't stay on very long.
it goes on for about 3secs.
and powers off then turns on for another 3 secs.
and turns back and continues doing that non-stop!
until i unplug the power cable...it takes about 10 minutes until i can get it to power on correctly but when it does, it give me an error message saying &quot;disk not ready insert boot diskette in drive a&quot; so i insert a windows 2000 diskette, which is the main o.s.
installed on the pc, but when the p.c.
reads it, it says &quot;cannot read from partition&quot; and it goes on into windows 2000 setup and stays there for a while and turns right back off and repeats itself with the (*power-on power-off problem)with no results....its like one big cycle with the same thing over-and-over again....i fix p.c's as a hobby and someone (a customer, if you will) brought this p.c.
for me to fix... what in the world do i do?????
the machine is pretty, if not, really old.
specs: emachines 366i2 192mb ram 10gb hard drive windows 2000 o.s.
(p.s.
sorry for the essay, it's that i really need your help.)
thanx in advanced!!
!
