<s> Hi, I hope this is in the right section I recently upgraded my AMD socket 939 Mobo from an Athlon 3500 and Radeon X1650pro to a dual core AMD 4200 with a Thermaltake Blue Orb2 fan and Radeon X1950pro. </s>
<s> I also installed a fresh copy of my Windows XP Home and it's fully updated (this was a few days after I installed the new stuff, hoping it would fix the problem). </s>
<s> Problem: The old system ran fine, no crashes whatsoever. </s>
<s> After I installed the new components and installed the catalyst 7.10 &quot;driver only&quot; on the system, it would just randomly crash (with the old XP). </s>
<s> Whether is be trying to install software, playing a game, looking at pictures and videos or browsing the net. </s>
<s> So I then installed a fresh Windows and the catalyst 8.2 control centre and driver, which is what i'm using now. </s>
<s> It has fixed it to some degree, so I can now play games and install stuff. </s>
<s> But on a random website or trying to save a random picture or even watching a youtube video, it will either freeze or the monitor will turn off or it will say &quot;out of range&quot; and then restart. </s>
<s> It is a clean install of Windows, 2 weeks old. </s>
<s> And the BIOS settings are exactly the same as with the X1650 which worked fine. </s>
<s> I know it may be a stability issue or a setting I must change in the bios, but I have no idea what the problem actually is. </s>
<s> My system is as follows: ASUS A8V deluxe M/B, AGP 8x, socket 939, bios 1017 (latest) AMD Athlon X2 4200+ ATI Radeon X1950pro Windows XP Home SP2 fully updated 750Watt TT PSU I would really appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Games fly, but I surf the net just waiting for it to crash. </s>
<s> I'm lucky I could write this message! </s>
<s> Thanks PS. </s>
<s> I was just about to press submit post and guess what it did... </s>
<s> This time it said &quot;non-preset mode&quot; and just froze. </s>
<s> Thank goodness for Firefox's restore </s>
<s> Take them out and put them in again. </s>
<s> Double check that you put the ram in the right way. </s>
<s> Do they match? </s>
<s> Do you have the right one in the right slot? </s>
<s> Run this diagnostics check: http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp The CPU did you install it correctly? </s>
<s> Is it the right one for the board? </s>
<s> How about the power supply is it big enough? </s>
<s> This one is tough to diagnose: http://www.efficientpowersupplies.org/pages/Generalized_Internal_Power_Supply_Efficiency_Test_Protocol_R5.pdf 500 watts is the upper limit for most systems. </s>
<s> Anything more then this is &quot;over kill&quot;. </s>
<s> If you have a $5,000.00+ system this may apply. </s>
<s> If you have a $5,000.00+ system this may not apply. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply I didn't think about re-seating the RAM and video card, I will try this and let you know what happens. </s>
<s> The CPU is in properly and matches the M/B, so that's fine. </s>
<s> I also have 2GB of Geil DDR400 RAM (4x512MB), I've had these for over a year now and seem to work fine. </s>
<s> The PSU is a ThermalTake 750Watt and is brand new. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to think that the video card may be faulty.... </s>
<s> I hope that's not the case. </s>
<s> I'd check the RAM thoroughly first. </s>
<s> Run a memory test utility. </s>
<s> Vista has one within it. </s>
<s> There are others as well. </s>
<s> Two tests might be advised. </s>
<s> I've been thinking It can't be a problem with the memory or GPU because I can play games, listen to music and watch videos for hours without any problems. </s>
<s> ?/?-.- Thanks though, I'll do a memory test soon. </s>
<s> oiling the fans is a good idea also. </s>
<s> Might be heat. </s>
<s> Try this software: http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php </s>
<s> Never thought of that, so thanks. </s>
<s> The temp is running pretty good, CPU is at 40 to 45 degrees and mobo at 23-27 degrees. </s>
<s> The case is an Antec 900 which helps alot. </s>
<s> I also changed the resolution colour to 16 bit, down from 32bit and it seems to be working fine, no crashes and I've been all over the web. </s>
<s> So it might be fixed although it now looks pretty average, there might be some colour distortion. </s>
<s> I'm not game enough to go back to 32bit Thanks guys </s>
<s> Sorry for the double. </s>
<s> I posted the one above and it froze 5 seconds later, lol. </s>
<s> I then restarted and tried to change to 32bit colour, hit apply and it froze again. </s>
<s> So i'm either thinking of changing the voltages and see how I go or go back to an earlier catalyst driver. </s>
<s> Something its still wrong but you have to live with it. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> oil it while your in there. </s>
<s> Here's another tip if you wrap your fan with rubber bands they run quieter. </s>
<s> That around the out side of the fan cases not over the top of the fans, most figure that out, most. </s>
<s> Run &quot;dxdiag.exe&quot; to test your system for porblems. </s>
<s> I have run DX Diagnostics and it comes up with no problems. </s>
<s> I did change my AGP setting to 4x instead of 8x and it seems to be working ok. </s>
<s> I have been on sites that have made it crash without trouble such as youtube. </s>
<s> I think I'll just have to change to 4x mode when I'm surfing the net for a while and go back to 8x when playing games. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> If changing to 4x does not fix it, then I'll post here again </s>
