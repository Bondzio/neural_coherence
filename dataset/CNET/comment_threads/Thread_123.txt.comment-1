I want to add an 80G Western Digital hard drive to my Dell, which has a 20G right now.
I don't want to replace the 20G...I'm keeping it.
So....I'm running XP, and I don't know what the heck they are talking about with the &quot;bios&quot; thing.
Is this going to be beyond my capabilities?
The directions seem fairly straightforward, other than that bios thing.
Tell me if I'm nuts, and should just pay somebody to do it.
I got a great deal on the drive, and was hoping to be self-sufficient, if I could.
:-P Thanks for your help~ Sharon
