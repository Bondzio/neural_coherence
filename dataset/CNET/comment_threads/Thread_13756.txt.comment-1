Hi My pc seems to have a odd problem.When i boot my pc, it shows the window xp desktop screen and then immediately shuts down(does not reboots).
But if i start the system, and go into the bios setup ,remain there for about 10 min and exit without saving, then it functions normally.
Is this due to weak cmos battery or something else.
Pls help Thanks
