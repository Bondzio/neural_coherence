Darton Fury gave you good tips.
I highly recommend purchasing a wireless broadband router.
Some DSL modems are actually combination modem-wireless router devices, so you need to confirm what model your buddy is already using before spending money on a wireless broadband router.
Regarding security, make sure that both the wireless broadband router and any wireless network adapter you use supports WPA-2 encryption.
WEP and and WPA are not as secure as once thought.
