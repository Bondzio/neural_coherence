1.1.1	I am new to computers so I need some help .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know when I do a powerpoint presentation of only 4 slides do I copy it to cd or dvd .	Ques
1.1.3	I have never used these two functions .	St
1.1.4	So if someone can explian what I use these things for it would be appreciated .	St
1.2.1	With just 4 slides you should fit it on there easy .	St
1.2.2	Otherwise use a CDROM and just cut and paste .	St
1.2.3	But you have to close it out or burn it ( rendering the CD unusable for any other writing ) .	St
1.2.4	Then when you do your presentation , just double click on the cd ( assuming powerpoint is loading on that computer ) .	St
1.3.1	So that whatever you do can be removed later and you can reuse your CD for other purpose , later..	St
1.4.1	I do n't know what a memory stick is but I managed to burn it on CD thanks for your help	Ques
