In all the systems I've seen, NONE allow one to &quot;extend&quot; the RAID 0 array.
All required destruction of the existing RAID 0 and then we created such anew with the drives that were on the RAID controller.
All could be as it should be if you have RAID 0.
RAID 5 on the other hand did offer ways to eject a drive and add a replacement.
But that's not in this system.
