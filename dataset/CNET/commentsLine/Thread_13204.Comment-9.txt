in most cars when the motor conks out and needs replacement, it is cheaper to buy a new car than to replace the motor.
if you can jerry rig it to work for a while, when it breaks down again the car most likely won't explode.
it will simply need more motor repair.
in a computer everything is very sensitive to incorrect voltages and amperage.
an incorrect soldering in the psu can cuase a short.
i have seen a fualty psu kill a mobo, proc, videocard and all the hdds at once.
in this case, a new psu is usually 1/10th the cast of the rest or less.
put it in prospective.
that is a tiny cost.
