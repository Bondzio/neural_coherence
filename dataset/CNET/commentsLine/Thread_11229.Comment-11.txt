we can stop this discussion for awhile because i am gonna reformat my computer.
since i am a student, i really have nothing important to backup so it ain't a big deal.
only games and school work on here.
just a couple questions: 1) what will reformatting do to my home network.
this computer is the main source with internet also going to another desktop and a laptop thru wireless adapter 2) what do i do, in order, after i reformat so that my computer stays fine and safe also, any other comments/help about this would be appreciated
