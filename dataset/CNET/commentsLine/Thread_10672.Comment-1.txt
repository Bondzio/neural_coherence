i just got a new lcd samsung syncmaster 930b i must say, i'm fairly dissapointed at the fact that no dvi cable was included.
i was wondering if there was a big difference between dvi and analog.
also, how can i check for any problems on my monitor, such as dead pixels etc.
i have noticed some backlight leakage when i set the screen black, is this a major issue?
where can i buy cheap dvi cables?
the only ones i found are $170 monster cable ones.
