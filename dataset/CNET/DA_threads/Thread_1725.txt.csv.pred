1.1.1	Hello All Just wondering whether anyone could recommend a decent 2.1 speaker system or even a REAL good 2.0 system for my computer - not an expert in this field so any advice would be well appreciated !	St
1.1.2	Some other info : * I use my pc ( MS Vista O/S ) for watching films as well as listening to music - no games !	St
1.1.3	* It will be in a small-medium sized room so do n't want too many wires , and do n't want a huge system as have enough clutter as it is !	St
1.1.4	* Budget - less than 100 .	St
1.1.5	* I did like the Harman Kardon Soundsticks , and was originally going to go with them ( from the great reviews I have read , as well as a great design ) but decided against it as I read it does not have a switch to turn it off ( waste of electricity - lol ) and dont want it to glow whilst I am trying to sleep - need darkness ! ! !	St
1.1.6	* A speaker system which is great value and will hopefully last a few years ! ! !	St
1.1.7	And advice/recs/help of any sort will be very well appreciated !	St
