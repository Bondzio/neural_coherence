except when i follow the instructions to reformat the drive in disk utility, the &quot;volume format&quot; dropbox and the &quot;disc name&quot; entry field are grayed out, and won't let me select a format for the drive.
when i click the info button regarding the drive, it has a line that says the drive can't be reformatted, even though all of the literature provided with the drive says it will work as ms-dos thanks for any help you can provide!
