Hey, I'm having a very annoying problem.
Just after Windows XP Pro launches on my computer, the motherboard begins to let out one long annoying beep and it doesn't stop.
I have no idea what is causing it and I can't get it to quit with the beep.
It is really loud and makes it so I can't use my PC out of sheer frustration.
What is the problem and how can I fix it?
Thanks!
