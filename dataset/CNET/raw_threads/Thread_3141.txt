I'm having a problem with my speakers, which are Altec Lansing ACS295 speakers with 2 satellites and one big subwoofer. The problem is that they are making strange sounds -- not like static, because if that were the case I would know the speakers are blown, it's happened to me before. The noise is more like someone blowing into a microphone or tapping a microphone that's plugged in to a speaker so you can hear it, and it happens repeatedly. Also, I don't need to be sending any sound to the speakers and they will still do it if they have power -- I can even remove the input cable from the cable, and as long as they are plugged in, they make these noises. I've noticed that the subwoofer makes more of a &quot;tapping on a microphone&quot; kind of a sound, and the left satellite makes louder sounds like blowing into a microphone. Actually, the subwoofer kind of sounds like when you are adjusting the cable to a speaker, but I checked all the cables and they're all in good condition and plugged in fine. I haven't played music on these speakers too loudly, and they're good quality speakers anyway. Any way to fix this?

Are you sure there compatible with your computers configuration? How about a web cam? This could be reverberation from the microphone on the web cam. Your audio software should have a setting to minimize this effect.

If it does, you know it's something in the set. If not, it's coming from the PC. This doesn't fix your problem but you've got to track down the cause first.

But the weird thing is, with the mp3 player, the sounds are much more infrequent and much less noisy than with the computer. Also, the subwoofer isn't making any sound when the speakers are connected to the mp3 player. One idea I just had is that it could be because the subwoofer is so close to the two satellite speakers. It does have a sticker on the top that says that &quot;the subwoofer is not magnetically shielded and should not be played near a video display. Placing the subwoofer on the floor under a desk is recommended.&quot; What do you guys think?

It would seem that something in your speaker system is acting as a detector/demodulator. This could be a faulty component, a design flaw or any of a number of things. A simple diode can act as a detector and some oscillating circuit act as a demodulator which just removes the carrier signal. Even a poor ground or solder connection can act something like a diode depending on the circuit it's in. An unintended oscillations in electronic circuits would be hard to isolate and resolve without proper instruments. You can try shielding but my guess is your success will be limited. At least you have something to work with now. Good luck.

Low frequencies tend to be less directional and you'll hear them just as well....or maybe even better....if placed on the floor.
