<s> I'm thinking of building of a new pc and I have looked at some components that I think are good and will work together and I was curious if they really will work together, and if there are similar components for a better price. </s>
<s> Finally should I just by a version of windows xp, or vista? </s>
<s> The parts are as follows: XFX nForce 680i LT SLI Motherboard, Diablotek CPA-901 Black ATX Mid-Tower Case with Ultra LS600 600-Watt Power Supply, Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Quad-Core Processor, 2.40 GHz, 8M L2 Cache, LGA 775, Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 250GB Hard Drive - 7200, 8MB, Serial ATA-300, OEM, Sony DRU-V200S/BR DVD Rewritable Drive SATA, Corsair XMS2 2 GB (2 X 1 GB 240-pin DDR2 800Mhz Dual Channel Memory Kit,EVGA GeForce 9600 GSO - 384MB GDDR3, PCI-Express 2.0, Dual DVI, HDCP, DX10. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help. </s>
<s> they seem like they are from a list 3-4 months old. </s>
<s> the q6600 processor is a still a good choice but i'd lean toward the q8200 instead. </s>
<s> likewise, 680i motherboards have been replaced by 780i mobos which address data corruption and cpu compatibility issues. </s>
<s> and if you're not going to use SLI, mobos based on the p35/p45 chipset are a better alternative. </s>
<s> seagate 7200.10 hard drives have been superseded by 7200.11s and a 500gb .11 is only $20 more. </s>
<s> and the 9600gso never gained a lot of manufacturer support and a $90 9600gt is certainly a better all-around choice. </s>
<s> I choose them basically for the performance for the cost, and apparently I made a few decisions which obviously weren't the best, but thats why I made this thread in the first place and your help is appreciated. </s>
<s> What are you going to be using it for? </s>
<s> What is your budget? </s>
