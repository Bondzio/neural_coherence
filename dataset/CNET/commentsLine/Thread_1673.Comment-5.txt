i'm not sure i fully follow what you are saying... when i have the original connection to the main it work great, as soon as there is an additional connection made by a separate vpn tunnel to the network (which netgear says it supports up to 8 simultaneous vpn tunnels) it will connect but the lan of the remote end is inexcusable.
if the lan was unable to be accessed by the 1st tunnel i would follow you, but the 2nd tunnel is the one that is having the problem.
