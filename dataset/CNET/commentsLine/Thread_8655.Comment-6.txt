actually, to be honest, i have no idea in hard disk world.
specially, external drives 2.5''.
in 2002 i bought 40gb barracuda iv 7200 rpm.
and it was recommended on internet and had good review rating those days.
i found it very good!
similarly, i find some good rating for maxtor and segate freeagent go on iinternet.
that's the reason i asked for either one.
well, do lacie has internal fan?
and what is global rating of it?
your help/guidence is highly appreciated!
thanks.
bye, viki.
