1.1.1	Hi all , I work in a production facility and a majority of my day is spent away from my desk either in meetings or out on the production floor .	St
1.1.2	While I am on the floor I get a lot of questions I am not able to answer because I can not access my email ( Microsoft Outlook ) , sharepoint sites , SAP etc .	St
1.1.3	This causes me to have to take notes , walk back to my desk and then follow up with the person later on .	St
1.1.4	This creates a lot of wasted time in my day .	St
1.1.5	I also use SAP heavily .	St
1.1.6	I was wondering if there are any tablets that are capable of doing a remote desktop back to my office where I could then use SAP on the floor .	St
1.1.7	If I was able to do a remote desktop it would probably be the best for me so I could keep all files on one computer and only use the tablet to link to my office while on the floor .	St
1.1.8	I would assume a tablet could not support having its own SAP program therefore I am pursuing the remote desktop .	St
1.1.9	So my question is there a tablet capable of remote desktop connection which is reliable and able to use SAP through the connection ?	Ques
1.1.10	I would assume most any tablet could connect to sharepoint sites or Microsoft Outlook so my biggest question is being able to use SAP .	St
1.1.11	I also have a laptop but it does not work well on the floor because I usually do not have a place to set it down to work .	St
1.1.12	This is why I am pursuing the use of a tablet .	St
1.1.13	Thanks for your help !	St
1.2.1	Plenty out there .	St
1.2.2	If you mean best , Panasonic Toughbooks are best for such things .	St
1.2.3	Example at http : //www.panasonic.com/business/toughbook/toughbook-products.asp # /U1 Bob	St
1.3.1	You could also try the ASUS EP-121 which is a Windows 7 tablet .	Sug
1.3.2	I have one that I use both for home and work which provides more versatility and flexibility .	St
1.3.3	Only disadvantages are its weight of 2.6lbs , battery life of 3.0 - 3.5 hours and of course the price of 1199.00 for the 64gb version which I recommend .	St
1.3.4	I comes with a leather cover , and Bluetooth keyboard with pen for writing .	St
1.4.1	I saw this post and thought I 'd answer even though I am a year late .	St
1.4.2	I have been using & quot ; jumpdesk & quot ; app on my ipad , my iphone and my acer mini to get work done on the fly .	St
