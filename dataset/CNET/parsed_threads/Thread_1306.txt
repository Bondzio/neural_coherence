<s> I have a Maxtor OneTouch III Turbo Edition 600 GB FireWire 400/800 and USB 2.0 Hard Drive, which you can see at this site: http://www.superwarehouse.com/Maxtor_OneTouch_III_Turbo_Edition_600_GB_FireWire_400_800_and_USB_2.0_Hard_Drive/G01Y006/ps/726077 I just ordered this enclosure: Galaxy METAL GEAR Metal Gear Box 3500SAP-SESIL Aluminum 3.5&quot; Silver USB 2.0 External Enclosure - Retail http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817716016 But I don't think they are compatible. </s>
<s> The connectors don't seem to match, and there are two hard drives in the Maxtor, so should I have bought two enclosures or one that fits both into it? </s>
<s> I tried to connect one of the hard drives into the Metal Gear Box, but the white plastic connector wasn't the same as the one to the Maxtor HD. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me to a compatible enclosure or tell me what I'm doing wrong? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> There are enclosures from that same company but for SATA hard disks. </s>
<s> Does this picture look like your drive cable and connections -&gt; https://www-304.ibm.com/systems/support/supportsite.wss/sata2.jpg If so, you need to shop for the SATA drive housing. </s>

<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> The maxtor has 2 300 GB drives, so should I get 2 SATA enclosures? </s>
<s> Would this one work for the two 300GB hds? </s>

<s> The Maxtor case no longer work? </s>
<s> That's not an USB 2.0 housing and would stress most owners to get it connected. </s>
<s> Why not the usual USB 2.0 housings that support a sata drive? </s>
<s> Can you please find what you're talking about and send me a link? </s>
<s> I'm not understanding what you mean. </s>
<s> And what happened was that I put a power adapter that was too strong into the Maxtor external HD, so it didn't read on my computer anymore. </s>
<s> The LED light kept flashing, but not steadily. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> You mean: too high voltage, like 20 V in stead of 10? </s>
<s> That might damage more than just the enclosure, but also the electronics of the disk itself. </s>
<s> No guarantees they work even in the right enclosure. </s>
<s> In that case, all you can do with it is throw the disks away. </s>
