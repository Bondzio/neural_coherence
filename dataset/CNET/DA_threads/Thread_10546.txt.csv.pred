1.1.1	I have a idotconnect metal gear box 3.5 & quot ; Hard drive .	St
1.1.2	The box reads 3.5 & quot ; IDE TO USB 2.0/1394A I lost the power adapter for this hard drive and ALL my stuff is on it.. it 's 6-PIN and it says & quot ; DC IN & quot ; where it plugs in to the Hard Drive .	St
1.1.3	I 've been googling this company , the product , the adapter..	St
1.1.4	I cant find anything with this PIN layout.. is this a typo ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	I found something similar , with the 5V and the GND Reversed.. SEE PIC BELOW http : //i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i440/grimlocksmom/Photoon2011-04-06at23542.jpg	St
1.2.1	Get a new enclosure .	St
1.2.2	I owned a few of those speed metal drives and that enclosure is not special .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Having your link explains alot ( thanks ) .	Polite
1.3.2	As Robert offered , replacing the enclosure would be the better fix & quot ; if & quot ; you ca n't find another AC wart .	St
1.3.3	Plus , the cost may push you into getting a new enclosure anyways , if you found one .	St
1.3.4	I also consider this an unique adapter , because of the dual-voltages , so it becomes harder to replace .	St
1.3.5	Check these links : http : //www.alleletronics.com http : //www.bgmicro.com -OR- google away for surplus or used parts vendors .	St
1.3.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I just need to get the data off this hard drive first.. but I need to power it up !	St
1.4.2	what should i be searching for ?	Ques
1.4.3	is there a specific name for this kind of adapter ?	Ques
1.5.1	and plug it into a port on your computer 's motherboard .	St
1.5.2	It should be either IDE ( PATA ) or SATA , If no port is available , disconnect one from such as a CD ROM or secondary hard drive .	St
1.5.3	Plug that drive in and pull off what you need .	St
1.5.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	As explained to you the simple fix was to replace the enclosure .	St
1.6.2	The new enclosure would have the required AC adapter .	St
1.6.3	You swap HD out and then use the new enclosure to access data .	St
1.6.4	Once done , you have the new enclosure as a working ext .	St
1.6.5	HD again .	St
1.6.6	If that does n't work provided all was done correctly , then you have some true or 2ndary fault to deal with .	St
1.6.7	Also , Steven 's suggestion to gain access for data alone , provided you have the required port and cabling , use a desktop PC and mount it as an int .	St
1.6.8	HD in proper setup .	St
1.6.9	Either way will work to gain access to data .	St
1.7.1	Try this one .	St
