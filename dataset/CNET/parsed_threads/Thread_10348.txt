<s> Can ANYONE tell me if it is safe to buy a monitor on ebay and how in the world can they sell them so much cheaper that Dell does. </s>
<s> Some guys have 25 of the same monitor. </s>
<s> I know this is not a technical help question but I wonder how they do it. </s>
<s> Guess my main question still is whether it is safe and will Dell honor the warranty? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for any light on this question. </s>

<s> I bought my 17&quot; CRT on E-Bay about 4 years ago and still using it daily. </s>
<s> I never had a problem. </s>
<s> Just like shopping anywhere, read the customer ratings and make your choice, I have no idea if Dell will honor a warranty, I expect not if refurbs. </s>
<s> If these monitors are stolen (could be?) </s>
<s> the SN# will disallow any warranty. </s>
<s> In fact, you'll probably get a call. </s>
<s> Of course, monitors are mass produced and some models aren't always needed, thus dumped in order to generate revenue. </s>
<s> If Dell does this and &quot;an agreement&quot; is made between seller and vendor to honor a warranty, its usually posted. </s>
<s> Also, don't expect a generous warrnty. </s>
<s> Many a monitor gets returned for repair/problem and can't be used as new, thus sold to 3rd party sellers. </s>
<s> Read the fine print and any eBay seller history. </s>
<s> The choice is yours. </s>

<s> I bought a new dell computer and lcd monitor on Ebay for a price that I couldn't get it for on the Dell website. </s>
<s> It arrived in perfect condition. </s>
<s> After a week, the hard drive stopped working. </s>
<s> So, I called Dell and they sent out a tech person to replace the hard drive and it all was covered under their warranty. </s>
<s> The person I bought it from had purchased it under some discount program available only to educational institutions and then used all of the rebates to get the puter for a price that isn't available to the general public. </s>
<s> I got a great deal, he made a little money and everyone is happy. </s>
<s> It is just frustrating to see someone abuse the educational discount system that Dell so generously makes available. </s>
<s> The computer and monitor were packaged in the original Dell packaging and arrived in great condition. </s>
<s> Boxes weren't damaged nor was the monitor. </s>
