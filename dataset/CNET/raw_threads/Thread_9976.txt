I want to get a graphics card that can play most 3D games (counterstrike: source). It has to cost less than $50 not be outdated too quickly and be compatible with my system: AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800 2.00GHz onboard video: VIA DeltaChrome PCI express video: GeForce 7300 (can't run anything 3D eg. all games) Asus m2v-mx motherboard 1GB kingston RAM 250GB maxtor HDD Windows XP SP2 Thanks in advance for any help
5969	1	259493	2557765	2557786	ozos	8/7/07 5:33 AM	1.18646478E12	Well	There's not much you're going to be able to find for $50, I know you won't like this answer, but its fact. The only cards available in that price segment are the GeForce FX series, which is much slower than the GeForce 7, the GeForce 6200, which is again slower, and the GeForce 7300. Additionally, anything you find in this price segment is probably already &quot;outdated&quot;. I'm not sure what your issue with the 7300GS is, however it should be easily capable of handling CounterStrike:Source (no, it will not give you 2560x1600 + all settings max at 100 FPS, but it will give you playable frame rates, if it isn't, thats something that can be troubleshooted [sic])

5969	3	259493	2557962	2557765	The0	8/7/07 10:41 AM	1.18648326E12	That was not the problem	I do not think that was the problem. It couldn't do ANYTHING 3D, the only game it could run that I had was Age of Empires (2D game). I think the GeForce was not compatible with my system because my on board graphics could play games (with a lot of lag cs: 12fps). About outdated graphics cards: My 5 year old laptop has a ATI Radeon 9700 and it still plays all my games, when I play cs there is some lag but good enough to play. BTW I was thinking of an ATI X1550 256MB. What do you all think about it? Thanks for the help

Check the reviews, google away, but a new card just can't be had at $50(256mb range) that's going to be game happy for ya. Ebay and any other user supplied used source may though. I think buy.com offers $10 off on a google recommendation buy. tada -----Willy
5969	5	259493	2558420	2558333	The0	8/8/07 12:19 AM	1.18653234E12	Thak you	I think $50 is going to be enough money. If my 5 year old laptop can play counter strike source resonably well I think that most graphics cards that came out recently should be able to suit my needs. Look at what I found http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102079 Tell me what you think. Thank you

5969	7	259493	2558589	2558483	The0	8/8/07 7:43 AM	1.18655898E12	Good?	So this could play a game like counterstrike: source at 1024x768 and graphics set at medium? Would it play well? Thanks alot for all your help
5969	8	259493	2558810	2558420	Willy	8/8/07 1:05 PM	1.1865783E12	Under $50, by a penny :)	Well, it fits the $50 mark and pretty much what the reviews state about it one way or another. Of course, should you buy it come back and post your real world results. Your money, your decision. tada -----Willy
5969	9	259493	2559035	2558589	R. Proffitt	8/8/07 7:21 PM	1.18660086E12	My kid played most with less.	Now it's some x1300 which he says works fine. Yours is a model up from that. You can spend more but at 50... I'd do that. Bob
5969	10	259493	2559518	2558810	The0	8/9/07 1:05 PM	1.1866647E12	Thanks to everyone for all the help	I think that this card will suit my needs because it can play counterstrike: source (which is my most graphically demanding game). The only thing that I am worried about is that it might not be compatible with my system (my geforce 7300GS is not). But maybe an ATI will be more compatible with my system than an nVidia. I will give it a try for $50. Thank you
5969	11	259493	2559981	2559518	ozos	8/10/07 6:06 AM	1.18672596E12	one thing i'd say	which you are doing, is going with ATI, not because of compatability, but because most Source engine games (Half-Life 2, CS:S, etc) are more tweaked for ATI (ATI was involved in the development process on some level) which could/should net you some gains I'd still love to know whats up with the 7300, it should be working fine, if you can RMA it, I'd also try that (shouldn't cost more than a few dollars, and hey, you might end up with two working cards)

5969	14	259493	2560336	2560314	ozos	8/10/07 2:43 PM	1.18675698E12	questions	RMA stands for Return Murchandise Authorization: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_Merchandise_Authorization most companies provide RMA numbers on their websites, as well as RMA directions, assuming the 7300 wasn't included with the system originally, you should be able to return it to its manufacturer, if it was included with the system originally, you'd need to contact the system builder and they will likely do something similar to an RMA for the board (might also cross-ship too, Dell has done this before) to the other two video cards Don't know a whole lot about the 2400, its a new DX10 entry level part, supposed to be decent for the money, but cant say much for it the X1650 is the older mid-range, equiv of the 7600 series, so it'd be faster than most of the boards in that price range, however that looks like a vanilla board, which means its performance won't be similar to an X1650Pro or XT, but it shouldn't be bad, the hitch is that I can't tell you which is faster, the 2400 or the X1650, I'd look for reviews

It comes with 128mb DDR2 onboard with TurboCache Technology. PCI-Express with TV-out, DVI-I, VGA. On Windows XP it would report 512mb video ram. I just updated to Vista Home Premium with dual monitors and TV. I am limited to using only 2 of the 3 outputs but with no hesitations or flickering. I am not much of a gamer, but love watching online content while surfing the web. It is just under the recommended cards for Vista, but I have yet to hit that wall.

5969	17	259493	2561700	2561651	The0	8/13/07 4:53 AM	1.18698078E12	Definitive Choice	Now I am looking at these cards: Asus Radeon HD 2400PRO 256MB 64-bit GDDR2 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121084 and SAPPHIRE Radeon X1650PRO 256MB 128-bit GDDR2 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102098 Which one should I get? The Sapphire only has DVI ports, but I suppose you can get a VGA adapter. Am I right? Thank you
5969	18	259493	2561736	2561700	ozos	8/13/07 6:52 AM	1.18698792E12	Yes you can get	DVI to VGA adapters, most cards include one, some include two I'd go with the X1650Pro for one reason and one reason only, it has a 128-bit memory interface, even if the HD 2400 is a faster GPU, it will run slower due to being bottlenecked for memory bandwidth. The X1650Pro, from the newegg pictures, looks to include a pair of DVI to VGA adapters, so you should be set with that board.
5969	19	259493	2561762	2561736	The0	8/13/07 7:16 AM	1.18698936E12	Thank you	I have made my decision: I will get the ATI Radeon X1650 Pro. Hopefully it will be compatible with my system and I will be able to play games smoothly.I Also hope it will be easy to use with Ubuntu (which I just installed the other day and it is AMAZING) Thank you for all the help

5969	21	259493	2562058	2557786	The0	8/13/07 2:43 PM	1.18701618E12	That doesn't really matter to me	I am currently using my GeForce 7300 with Ubuntu. It manages beryl (the cool thing where you turn your desktop into a cube and spin it around) without a problem. But as soon as I start a game... CRASH I don't think the ATI drivers will be too bad. Anyway, all I will do with them is beryl. For playing games I will use windows (which is installed on the other drive). Thank you

I was looking at that originally, but I've decided I'll more likely go for the 8600 when I have a little extra to spend.
