but to be on the safe side.
closely examine the mother board for areas that look odd.
everything should be bright and shiny.
all resistors, diodes and the like should look the same.
look for dark and discolored areas.
double check that all of your components have seated well into there slots and that all cables are plugged in well.
(i hope i don't need to remind you to unplug it first.)
if things aren't seated in well, it could be arching.
fans can be lubricated using three-in-one (tm) oil.
there is usually a plug or label that covers the bearing, these can be removed, a drop of oil applied and the the label or plug should be re-installed to keep the dust out.
if the labels will not adhere use duct tape to cover the bearing.
make sure the fans go back in the way they came out.
even new fans can be bad.
did you notice any static electric discharges during the build?
you know those little zaps you get in the winter when the house is dry and hot?
if you did, you may have fried something.
do you remember what it was?
these little finger &quot;thunder bolts&quot; can really screw things up.
hope this helps.
