1.1.1	I just purchased a video card that has dvi, i mistakingly bought a DVI-I cable, when my monitor has a DVI-D input.	St
1.1.2	Since the 4 extra pins on the cable wont leet it plug into the input, and since they carry the analog signal, i was wondering if there was any little DVI-I to DVI-D connectors?	St
1.2.1	Read http://www.dvigear.com/education/dvi_faqs.html and only then look at those adapters.	St
1.2.2	If the adapter fails it's likely you didn't understand what the FAQ told.	St
