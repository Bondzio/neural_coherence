thank you, which machine will i need to put the subnet 255.255.0.0 into, would i just put it on all 3?
what should i have the default gateway set to?
i have no router just a hub that all 3 machines plug into!
isn't 255.255.0.0 a class b mask which would mean that the ip address starts with something different to 192?
thanks again,
