<s> I can't beleive Epson doesn't have an updated driver for their software to use in Vista. </s>
<s> I can use it, but limited functionality. </s>
<s> Original software had slick interface for copy, tweak scan settings - resolution, etc. </s>
<s> Anyone know how to do this? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Unpopular or outdated devices may not get the new drivers for a new OS, if not never but later, much later. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Because that is the time for manufacturers can sell newly released models not only supporting the new OS but may have better or updated features. </s>
<s> Vista does offer &quot;native support&quot; but is generic or basic but at least it works and doesn't totally abandon the old device. </s>
<s> Rarely do 3rd party support get into windoze drivers area unless it is so sorely needed. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The Epson web site contains information on the availability of Vista updates for Epson scanners. </s>
<s> You have a good chance of finding Twain drivers and the Epson Scan Utilities. </s>
<s> However, you will probably not find Vista updates for the Control Panel. </s>
<s> I believe this provides the functionality you are looking for. </s>
<s> NewSoft Inc does have Vista updates of Control Panel for many Epson scanners. </s>
<s> There is a charge for this software. </s>
<s> I installed it for my Epson Perfection 3170 scanner. </s>
<s> It seems to work fine </s>
<s> I have a Perfection 1650. </s>
<s> Epson does have a bare bones twain update, but as far as I can tell so far - it does nothing whatsoever. </s>
<s> So would newsoft have a fix to get the control panel up and running on this? </s>
<s> Is there any way to get the original software in here to run in compatability mode with XP? </s>
<s> When I put the cd in here now it says it can't use it - go to Epson site. </s>
<s> We have been trying to get Epson twain drivers for vista & or Vista 64 for our Perfection 1200u photo scanner.. thay say they're not supporting this model in Vista !! </s>
<s> They are probably hoping to sell more scanners as people upgrade to vista... What they are doing is ruining customer confidence in their product line !! </s>
<s> If we can't get this scanner some support ,,, why should I or any of you want to buy their printers or scanners !! </s>
<s> 1 person - 1 vote - 1 buying decision Ol'Pal </s>
<s> The one thing you'll find is that most 5 year old devices are going to fail in this regard. </s>
<s> There is no revenue here. </s>
<s> But you can cut the cost. </s>
<s> Sell yours and get a new one. </s>
<s> Even if you get 20 bucks for the old one that's that much less. </s>
