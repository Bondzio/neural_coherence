I have previously looked at buying a new emachine or other computer, but I found that a)emachines' highest-end computer only has a dual core, and b)getting a quad core from another company would be at least $500.
Seeing how as I plan on using this new computer for moderately intense gaming, as well as 3D design, I am trying to get as much power as I can possibly get for my money, and the components I have mentioned in my original post cost less than $250 total.
Even if I did need a new case and PSU, that would still be below $300.
Thanks for the suggestion, though
