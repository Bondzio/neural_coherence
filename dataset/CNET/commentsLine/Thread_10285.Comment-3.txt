but it's not quite the same issue that i'm hoping to resolve.
i don't have a problem with people not being able to send a fax to our office (to be honest, we've attempted to get all our clients to simply e-mail their correspondence, but many still cling to their antiquated fax machines), my issue is needing to save the incoming faxes as image files on a pc instead of printing a hardcopy into the tray.
i should mention that we did try installing a modem directly in the pc and using microsoft's included &quot;fax console&quot; program, but had similar, unsatisfactory results.
