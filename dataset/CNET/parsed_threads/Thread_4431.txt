<s> I've had this HD for a couple of years and it's always worked fine. </s>
<s> Today, I was downloading an opera from the internet when the cat jumped on my desk and disconnected it. </s>
<s> It didn't fall far, just disconnected. </s>
<s> Now, I can't get it to be recognized by either computer. </s>
<s> It lights up. </s>
<s> but can't be found. </s>
<s> HELP!! </s>
<s> I can hear a clicking inside when it's on and also it was beeping at me. </s>
<s> I unplugged it. </s>
<s> I have lots of room left abut also lots of things I'd like to save. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> If it's not repairable, can someone save my information? </s>
<s> Many thanks Oh yes, I have Win XP. </s>
<s> Try the drive (the drive inside!) </s>
<s> in a new case or in a desktop. </s>
<s> The clicking is either the drive's death or a power issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't feel comfortable taking the drive out, so haven't tried it.l I did try it with a new cable in a laptop and it was listed on the Device Manager, but I still couldn't access it. </s>
<s> It said that it didn't have any problems, but that's not true! </s>
<s> I could hear it spinning and sometimes a bit of a click. </s>
<s> I've spent allot of time today reading and the suggestions vary greatly. </s>
<s> One is to freeze it. </s>
<s> Would this help? </s>
<s> Also to smack it. </s>
<s> I tried. </s>
<s> Maybe I should smack the cat who disconnected it! </s>
<s> But, I wouldn't -- he's too nice! </s>
<s> We live in a fairly rural area, but there are a couple of computer geeks in the next town. </s>
<s> Do you think it would be worth it to take it there? </s>
<s> I don't mind paying something to get it to work. </s>
<s> Somewhere I read that if it was disconnected while downloading something, it become corrupted. </s>
<s> That' seems what happened. </s>
<s> I have been so carefully filling the 2TBs with full backups of my computer and dozens of operas both audio and video. </s>
<s> Sure would be nice to get it back. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help, Peggy </s>
<s> It seems odd to me to abuse a drive rather than try a known method that allows folk to get their files out or fix the drive. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Problem is, I don't have a clue how to take the drive out and put it in a new case. </s>
<s> If I can figure it out, I'm happy to try it. </s>
<s> Just one of those things I've never done. </s>
<s> As far as abusing the drive, I was only following some suggtestions on another forum that seemed to have work. </s>
<s> Peggy </s>
<s> https://www.youtube.com/results?hl=en&safe=off&q=how+to+remove+a+hard+drive+from+an+usb+enclosure Freezing and boiling a drive is abuse. </s>
<s> I never do that first. </s>
<s> It's a simple mechanical bit of work but it's your data, your choice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You've basically answered you're own question, it fell because of the cat. </s>
<s> The posters have already provided you with the typical fixes, but you seem not able to proceed. </s>
<s> Thus, you're left asking some service to do this if you feel worth the costs. </s>
<s> This is now left to you. </s>
<s> I leave offering that you should have stored critical data to discs whenever possible as yet a further back-up or only back-up to count on or yet another ext. </s>
<s> HD. </s>
<s> In other words multiple back-ups. </s>
<s> Understand clearly, besides removing HD to another USB case that using any recovery s/w or methods may in fact compromised the data if in fact the HD is damaged. </s>
<s> You reduce the chances of a service being able to recover(as much) as well up to a point. </s>
<s> As it stands, you're not able to do this, so contact a service, google for vendors, but DriveSavers is popular. </s>
<s> Any service is not cheap, IMO. </s>
<s> http://www.cnet.com/topic/data-recovery.html http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; check recovery tips too FYI- Use Velcro strip attached to next ext. </s>
<s> HD or non-slip mat and use under HD. </s>
<s> Don't block any vents. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I found this via googling: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYyJVlSAEVU It should help and of course, try by all means. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the exact video. </s>
<s> Does the pry bar have to be green? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I use a &quot;nail file&quot; that's been bent yet flexible to open cases or laptops, very effective. </s>
<s> as for green pry bar, that looks pretty heavy duty. </s>
<s> maybe, I'll post YouTube video of recycling old HDs. </s>
<s> For the OP, that's a std. </s>
<s> Hitachi full size drive. </s>
<s> Even, if you can't fix the bad HD, you could swap it out, provided it was only the HD that's bad not anything else. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> Okay -- probably everyone is pretty bored with this, so I'll bring you up to date and maybe disappear! </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> As I think I mentioned we live in a small 5,000 person town with the biggest nearby town with about 49,000. </s>
<s> So our choices of expert help are somewhat limited. </s>
<s> Today, I took the HD to a fairly well-established computer repair shop. </s>
<s> They plugged it in, the light came on, and when they heard the clicking, said it was beyond repair, didn't seem to think that removing the HD was of any use. </s>
<s> So? </s>
<s> They suggested that banging it in a certain spot might help. </s>
<s> So, now either I take it to another repair shop, or give up. </s>
<s> Re backing-up, this was my backup! </s>
<s> Don't really want to or can afford to pay for someone to try and get the info back,So, guess I'll have to try to reconstruct from my main computer. </s>
<s> Thanks for suggestions. </s>
<s> Wish it had turned out better!! </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> The whole idea of providing a YouTube video was the means to teardown the ext. </s>
<s> HD. </s>
<s> Once you have the HD in hand you could try as 2nd HD mount it &quot;inside&quot; the PC(desktop) using spare cabling or getting that. </s>
<s> This way you test to see if the HD is at fault and not the electronics that were part of the ext. </s>
<s> case. </s>
<s> if you find the HD is bad, then you can buy another std. </s>
<s> HD and mount it in the ext. </s>
<s> case, at least you have that going for you. </s>
<s> I realize the the other half of this is retrieving the data. </s>
<s> Unfortunately that is all too often too late or too challenging for the user. </s>
<s> if there is physical damage, it's pretty much shot. </s>
<s> Yes, there are retrieval services, but they truly teardown the HD and actually mount the HD &quot;platters&quot; or discs on yet another mechanism to do that. </s>
<s> As for your local PC repair shop, hearing the &quot;clicking&quot; is called the &quot;click of death&quot;. </s>
<s> having to hit or knock on the HD is basically a last resort or hopeless act. </s>
<s> Don't fall for all those fixes online, many are old tricks and don't readily apply no more or you do what you hope can help(rarely). </s>
<s> IMHO, you now own a brick, I wish it did out differently. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
