i upgraded my 60mb hard drive to a 200mb; how do i transfer all my data to the new hard drive.
i realize that having two hard drives don't hurt but my system boots from the 60mb drive and i would rather have everything boot from the 200mb drive.
i'm a diy so i'm trying not to go to a tech center.
can this be done?
do i need two computers to accomplish this?
system info... compaq presario s4120wm windows xp home edition mobo am37 fic amd athlon xp 2600+ 2.1mhz 512mb ddr ram
