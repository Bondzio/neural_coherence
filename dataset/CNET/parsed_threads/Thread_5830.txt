<s> HELP MY DAUGHTER HAS A PROGRAM SHE USED ON MY OLD EMACHINE. </s>
<s> SHE INSTALLED IT ON THIS MACHINE BUT IT WILL NOT WORK. </s>
<s> A MESSAGE COMES UP SAYING NOT ENOUGH MIXER LINES FOUND TO MATCH RECORD AND PLAYBACK. </s>
<s> PLEASE CHECK SOUND CARD DRIVERS. </s>
<s> WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO CHECK? </s>
<s> Too hard to read so I gave up. </s>

<s> Sorry about the CAPS Bob, but if you can read this now please HELP. </s>
<s> My daughter has a program &quot;The Official American Idol Audtion Kit&quot; She used it on my old emachine (eTower 500i) On the T5026, she gets a message 'Not enough mixer lines found to match Record and Playback. </s>
<s> Please check you soundcard drivers' How do I do that? </s>
<s> My grandson told me to take the soundcard from the older machine. </s>
<s> In the system requirements it does say Sound Card that supports full duplex. </s>
<s> The older Emachines (Wife has a etower 766id) had the Integrated Intel AC 97 sound. </s>
<s> The newer T5026 has the improved Intel High Definition 6-channel audio (5.1)sound, but it is also Integrated. </s>
<s> &quot;Integrated Sound&quot; has no actual card that can be transferred. </s>
<s> The older Emachines had the WinME, or Win98 Operating Systems. </s>
<s> Your newer machine has the WinXP Operating System. </s>
<s> It could be that like many other older programs the &quot;American Idol Audition Kit&quot; is not compatible with the WinXP operating system. </s>
<s> If you have the original box or specifications sheet, it should state the minimum requirements to play. </s>
<s> If you not, you can contact them at customersupport@auditionkit.com to see if they have a 'patch' to operate under WinXP. </s>
<s> From what I can determine the 'American Idol Audition Kit&quot; sold at Target stores and Best Buy at least a year ago, but I cannot find it listed at those stores anymore. </s>
<s> The only other advice is to contact Emachine support where you could still be under warranty. </s>
