for the voltage part, for both kinston and murshkin, it's 1.8v as labeled on the ram for the cycles, i tried manually setting the cycles to whatever that's listed in the cpu-z info and the problem remains.
i'm starting to think if there is something wrong with the motherboard.
the chance of getting stucking at exactly the same place during windows memeory test due to ram is really low i think.
also, as i noticed, when i turned the sound chip off in bios, the frequency of crash reduced significantly in windows and in some of the games... i'm going to see if i can get hold of a similar motherboard and have a try.
thanks
