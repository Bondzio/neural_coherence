1.1.1	I have a Hitachi external hard drive that worked fine one morning and stopped working when I came back from college .	St
1.1.2	It simply does not power on at all , as if the power cable is not even connected .	St
1.1.3	I have tried it on two different computers the unit is definitely not receiving power So my question is , would buying a new enclosure save my data ?	Ques
1.1.4	I use my external hard drive to stream music and video from my Nintendo Wii and it 's imperative that I save it .	St
1.1.5	A new enclosure would have to conform to the specs of 3.5 & quot ; and 2TB .	St
1.1.6	I ca n't afford data recovery and I want to save my approaching 1TB worth of content .	St
1.1.7	This is it and thanks for any help I 've had trouble finding answers .	Polite

1.2.1	Why ?	Ques
1.2.2	Because we ca n't try it .	St
1.2.3	But if you want your data , it 's the best 20 buck gamble you can take today .	St

1.3.1	Sounds as if the dc inverter has failed ( the adapter that plugs into a/c power ) .	St
1.3.2	If you take the unit to a Radio Shack or someone who has a volt ohm meter handy this is a very easy thing to check. , there is a pretty good chance that the drive itself is fine .	St
