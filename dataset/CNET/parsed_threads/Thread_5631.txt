<s> I have a HP 4315 ALL-IN-ONE printer..... and it seems to be stuck on FAX. </s>
<s> When ever I try to print something it goes to the fax settings and not the printing settings... and I have no idea why... </s>
<s> I don't fax things, ever(its not set up to fax). </s>
<s> I turned it on today and it says fax on the little LCD... where it should say print. </s>
<s> Anyone have this printer or know what to do? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I've tried restarting it... nothing. </s>
<s> There are no actual buttons either to enable printing, it should be the default setting. </s>
<s> However, if I want to Fax, Scan, or Copy, there are buttons for those. </s>
<s> Mods can delete. </s>
