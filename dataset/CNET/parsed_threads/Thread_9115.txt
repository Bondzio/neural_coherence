<s> Id really appreciate some help with this, cos im stumped. </s>
<s> I had 2 computers, one running XP pro, and the other Win2000. </s>
<s> The 2000 machine connected to the internet through a wireless card and and a wireless router connected to the XP machine. </s>
<s> It was also connected to the XP machine as part of a network. </s>
<s> On the 2000 machine, there was a folder called ''shared'' that sat on the desktop. </s>
<s> Users on both computers could put stuff in there, and take stuff out, BUT, anything the XP machine tried to share (mark as a shared folder and/or put into the shared documents folder) with the 2000, the 2000 was never allowed to access it ''access denied''. </s>
<s> When it would let me ''access'' it, it asked for a name and password, but no matter what i entered it still wouldnt let me log in. </s>
<s> Only a few days ago i upgraded the 2000 machine to XP, and now i cant even access the ''shared'' folder on the new XP machine. </s>
<s> I've got no idea whats going, and I've tried everything I know, which doesnt amount to much, so any help in this matter would be VERY greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks Frank ps: I am also, since upgrading the 2000 to XP, getting an ''error 777, problem ceonnecting to signup'' message all throughout the day. </s>
<s> What's that all about? </s>
<s> If your shared folder that is on the desktop is a shortcut or mapped drive, delete the desktop folder. </s>
<s> CAUTION: if the folder on your desktop is the actual folder that is being shared, deleting it will delete all the folder contents. </s>
<s> If you are unsure, backup the folder contents to another folder. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Find the acutal shared folder (not a shortcut or mapped network drive) 2. </s>
<s> Rt-click it and disable file sharing and click Apply. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Enable file sharing again on the same folder and click Apply. </s>
<s> Go to the mfg. </s>
<s> website for your modem and download the latest XP driver. </s>
<s> Info: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q318009 </s>
<s> ok thank you. </s>
<s> I've done that but cant get onto the other computer at the moment, so theres no way for me to tell if it worked or not. </s>
<s> I'll post and say whether it is or not when i get the chance to have a look. </s>
<s> ok im on the older XP machine now, and i still cant access the shared folder, i cant even access the other computer (the one that i just recently put XP on. </s>
<s> ''You might not have permission to use this network resource, contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> access denied''. </s>
<s> It was my brother-in-law who set the computer up a while ago and he knows a lot more than i do, so could it possibly be something ''advanced'' thats stopping me? </s>
<s> as for the Error777, thats still popping up, especially on this site. </s>
<s> I downloaded a driver and installed it, but that didnt seem to do anything. </s>
<s> the link you gave me said it was for HP computers(which mine isnt) but the 3rd party page is where i got the driver from and it still didnt work. </s>
<s> thanks again for your help! </s>
<s> Run XP's Network Setup Wizard on each computer. </s>
<s> Make sure to give all computers the same Workgroup name. </s>
<s> Also, enable file sharing. </s>
<s> that was one of the 1st things i did after putting XP on the other computer, but it just said &quot;you have to run network setup wizard on each computer you want to join the network. </s>
<s> i ran it on both and its still saying i dont have permission, when im logged in as the admin on both computers. </s>
<s> is there some kind of order i should do them in? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
