they have better communication between the two CPU's by far.
HOWEVER the situation is so dynamic and Intel is a far biger company than AMD, yopu can be sure that they will very shortly have equal or better.
By putting the MCH [Memory Controller Hub] inside the CPU [a great idea] AMD unfortunately locked themselves into DDR memory.
Thus they are frantically working on a new set of CPUs that will support DDR2 and possiblly something newer, [they just signed an agreement with another memory developer].
Thus it will be a different socket type and thus a different mobo.
One shouldn't make a decision until they have money in hand and ready to place the order.
Then on that day you buy the greatest and a month later it is the old slow one.
LOL Keep up by going to http://www.tomshardware.com and http://www.anandtech.com [as well as others] and read the test that they present regarding such things.
Fantastic source of current info.
