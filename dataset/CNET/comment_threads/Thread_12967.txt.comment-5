generally considered to be better than the VIA's, not so for the nForce 2 or 3's [nothing wrong with them, but no advantage over the Via's].
There are 3 versions of nForce 4's and certainly they are totaly compatible with with ATI video cards, unless you go with the PCI X16 video and also want SLI, then the latest ATI &quot;SLI&quot; thing may have problems.
I doubt if you want to spend in that class of video.
