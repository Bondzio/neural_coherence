the first computer i remember using was a burroughs b6700 main frame at college in 1976. if you were lucky, you could go intereractive on the green sceen terminals, or one of the two graphics terminals.
i remember we booked both graphics terminals one day and played 'star wars' on them.
i think we took a good proportion of the processor cycles to do this.
we also had commodore pets with the built in tape drives.
i managed to collect a large number of games for this.
my first home computer was a self assembled 'microtan 65', this was a kit consisting of a single board with 1k ram and a 6502 processor, storage was via cassette tape and the keyboard was 20 charactors.
programming was in machine code.
larger i bought an expansion board and 2k rom to run assembler.
later i progressed to a bbc microcomputer which had a wordprocessor application in rom.
i still have an amstrad pcw green screen computer which ran cp/m on a z80 processor.
my working life saw texas ti99/4a, sinclair z80, spectrum 16 & 64 and ql, amstrad cpc and pcw, commodore vic 20, 64 and 128, atari, dragon, bbc, acorn, nortstar advantage (green screen, cp/m & mp/m and fixed format 5 1/4 floppy disc) as well as the ibm at.
that was just the 70s and 80s.
now working with thin clients.
