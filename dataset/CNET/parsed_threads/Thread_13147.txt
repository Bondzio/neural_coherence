<s> I have an older 74gb 10,000rpm Raptor drive with a 1.5gb SATA connection and a 2tb 7200rpm with a 6gb SATA connection. </s>
<s> The Raptor has much faster read and seek times, but a smaller cache and smaller bandwidth to the mobo. </s>
<s> What to to?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The usual result is seek times trump the faster transfer rates. </s>
<s> I can install on both and compare the boot times... </s>
<s> I've spent wnough on this project as it is, but the other option is to bye a solid state drive for the sole purpose of hosting Win 7 </s>
<s> I've seen some users go the SSD route and are happy as long as everything is working. </s>
<s> That's not a given, as the SSD drive can crap-out with no clue that it would. </s>
<s> The usual cure is to replace the drive. </s>
<s> Overall, IMO it works well other than what I stated. </s>
<s> Recovery of any data is on par for any device like a flash drive. </s>
<s> For now though, I would recommend continued use of a SATA type HD. </s>
<s> They're at the top of they're form and seem to be just as good as SSD minus the speed. </s>
<s> However, that speed difference isn't going to really be noticed until intensive tasks like audio&video editing may come into it. </s>
<s> As for game play, that too isn't all that impressive. </s>
<s> Game forums/websites aren't really pushing SSD other than bragging rights. </s>
<s> However, for OS usage, it works well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I appreciate that info Willie, I'll probably stick with one of the SATA drives for now if not only for $$$ purposes... Did you have any opinion or technical reasons for me to decide on the Raptor drive or the 6bg SATA drive? </s>
<s> 6Gb i/f is the highest level and if your PC supports it why not use it. </s>
<s> Until the corrected Sandy Bridge and complete chipsets arrive, other mtrbd. </s>
<s> chipsets will do and they do good. </s>
<s> Since, you have 6Gb ability and if HD is capable, use it. </s>
<s> I see no reason, not to at least I don't. </s>
<s> If you do some reviewing and checking, IMO most users just don't see great improvements, however it is there. </s>
<s> If it was my system I tend to lean towards stability/reliability issues. </s>
<s> My tasks are simple or relatively so, so I'm easily pleased. </s>
<s> But, if some spec means more to you, then get it. </s>
<s> I don't think I can expand anymore on the topic. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks very much </s>
