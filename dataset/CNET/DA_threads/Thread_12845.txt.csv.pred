1.1.1	Hey , I know this has probably been covered before but i could n't find one that matched my situation .	St
1.1.2	Ok so i bought a sata hd as a backup dive , and at first xp recognized it .	St
1.1.3	But i got an error half way though formatting the sata and since then xp will not recognized it.And do n't say disk management because that the typical solution I keep finding except for the fact that it does n't show in disk management .	St
1.1.4	Any idea 's people ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	system is - Amd athlon 3200+ 64 bit , msi RS482m4 mother board , 1.5 gigs of ram , with a ide main hd and the sata is a WD Caviar Black	St
1.2.1	Try that ; if not then maybe go to WD website and download some .	St
1.2.2	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	I guess you did n't read the part that the hd does n't show in disk management .	St
1.3.2	It shows in the bios , not in windows .	St
1.3.3	And i 've tried all of the software to download from WD and still nothing	St
1.4.1	it may be worth deleting your sata controller driver from device manager .	St
1.4.2	after removing it , and rebooting , the system will automatically reinstall , and redetect devices attached .	St
1.4.3	if it still fails , preform the same again , with the sata drive detached , and after it 's reinstalled , then attach the sata drive .	St
