bob is correct but you need to know if the processor is a coppermine or tualatin core and which your motherboard can support.
tualatins were late entries as the p4 release was imminent, as i recall, so older socket 370 boards did not support it.
btw, oem means &quot;original equipment manufacturer&quot; which means these are the components pc builders buy in bulk and get a better deal.
you don't get the boxed products warranty from intel and you do not get a fan/heatsink.
hope that adds some helpful info.
