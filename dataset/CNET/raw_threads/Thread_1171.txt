It will be working fine, then it will become lazy and barely follow my movements. Is there any maintenance I can perform to bring its performance back to standard, or must I buy a new mouse? If so, which would you recommend for a: HP Pavilion Pentium 4 CPU, 2 Ghrtz, 512 RAM running WinXP Home, Service Pack 1?

You should clean-up the system to see if recent installs, etc. aren't tasking the system resources. Review &quot;startup&quot; pgms. remove little used pgms. etc. for a better overall operationg system. Plus, using the latest AV updates check for virus, trojans, and worms. Also, any malware that Spybpt or Ad-Aware may find intrusive. If none of this seems to clear up the problem, then maybe the mouse is bad. Logitec is the best for this type of mouse, but any other should perform as well. good luck -----Willy

If this is a standard ball type mouse, unscrew the bottom with a simple twist and take out the ball. Make sure it's free of dust. then, take an eraser and clean the roll bars, they may have deposits of grime and dirt that are making the roller ball slip. you shouldn't have to replace it. good luck.
