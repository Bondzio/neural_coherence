<s> Hi I want to install an AGP video card into my pc but I have a problem. </s>
<s> I do not have the manual for the motherboard and I cannot figure out which keys to press to enter the bios. </s>
<s> I searched google and found many different combinations but none seem to work. </s>
<s> I need to get into the bios to disable the on board video and enable AGP. </s>
<s> Is there anyway I can track down my bios key? </s>
<s> Also is there another way to disable on board video without using the bios? </s>
<s> Anyway my Bios is AMIBIOS ver 7 and the numbers at the bottom of the screen are &quot;AMIBIOS-0AAWVP06-Y2KC-F&quot; Thanks </s>
<s> or motherboard have a name and model number? </s>
<s> That's the first place to look. </s>
<s> Usually DEL, F1, F2 or F10 gets you in. </s>
<s> on most systems as &quot;setup&quot;, as in in &quot;press [whatever key] to enter setup&quot;???? </s>
<s> The BIOS is stored on a CMOS chip. </s>
<s> Some call the BIOS CMOS. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I do not have the manual and the screen says nothing about what key to enter setup which is why I am stumped... </s>
