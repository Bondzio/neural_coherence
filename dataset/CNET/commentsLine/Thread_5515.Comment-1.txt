i've been working with gaining space on my hard drive, i had 3 partitions: primary (220 gb) backup (around 8 gb) empty (1 gb or something) now, i've deleted the empty one and shrunk the backup one (it was vista and i have 7 now), but i can't extend the primary partition in to the unallocated space.
the problem might be that the backup partition is &quot;in between&quot; the primary and unallocated areas.
is there a way i can fix this?
by the way, i already know about the diskmgmt thing, that's what i've been using.
feel free to ask for clarification.
thank's for your support, deven p.s.
can i upload pictures to this, or is that not allowed?
