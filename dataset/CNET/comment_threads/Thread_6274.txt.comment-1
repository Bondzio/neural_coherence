Turned on my dual 2.0 yesterday morning and it went bang!
All initial thoughts pointed to the power supply, so I opened the case to see if I could see any evidence of component failure.
I've removed the power supply and nothing seems dead (looks and smell) but i saw this next to the combined fan/speaker arrangement.
&lt;img src=&quot; http://www.benlawrencephoto.co.uk/G5.jpg&quot; &gt; So the questions are: 1) what are these cables for, and should they be connected?
2) If this cable disconnected itself and shorted with the case, would it damage the power supply or the logic board... or both.
I'm happy to replace the power supply, but I don't know if it is the power supply that's dead, or the logic board!
I'm having to do this myself as I can't afford to have it done professionally.
(i've built PCs for years, but not macs) ANY help you can offer would really help..... please?
