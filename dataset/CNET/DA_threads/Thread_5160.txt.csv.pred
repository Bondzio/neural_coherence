1.1.1	I have recently built a computer for my father , and after 15-20 mins of being in Windows , the mouse pointer freezes .	St
1.1.2	The mouse still works , but the on-screen pointer does n't move I have tried a different mouse but with no luck , and updated and re-installed the drivers twice over .	St
1.1.3	Spec : P4 3Ghz 512MB DDR RAM 80GB SATA HDD 10GB & 8GB IDE HDD nVidia FX 5200 Graphics Soundblaster 5.1 Digital Sound Windows 2000 Professional PS2 Logitech Wheel Mouse .	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	HEAT .	St
1.2.3	Remove case cover and see if gets better .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	Power .	St
1.2.6	Too many toss an old power supply or some 300-350 Watt PSU in the box since & quot ; it should be enough. & quot ; The power supply is missing from your parts list .	St

1.3.1	& quot ; PS2 Logitech Wheel Mouse & quot ; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ That 's your problem , a Logitech mouse .	St
1.3.2	Goto the Logitech support website or if you got it , CD/floppy install disk , use it .	St
1.3.3	Normally , you do n't need drivers as native W2K will do fine .	St
1.3.4	However , in some systems for whatever reason , Logitech mice are problematic .	St
1.3.5	I find using a plain 2-button non-wheeled mouse or a real MS wheel mouse problems go away .	St
1.3.6	You can tweek the mouse setting ( hardware ) if you like and see if it settles down , but i have no fix to speak of other than above .	St
1.3.7	sorry ... tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	Power Supply was bought new with the case .	St
1.4.2	400W me thinks .	St
1.4.3	Ca n't think it could be the heat cos I 've got 4 fans in the case , but I 'll try it anyways !	St
1.5.1	I think that 's the most logical , if I ca n't fix it over the weekend , I 'll just go by another mouse , and I 'll stick with Microsoft this time round !	St
1.6.1	Did n't think the heat would be a problem , but it seems as though it could be .	St
1.6.2	With the upgrade I replaced the motherboard , CPU , memory , case and PSU and everything worked fine .	St
1.6.3	It 's only recently the problem started happening , so was reluctant to think the heat could be the problem and thought it was down to the Remote Registry service running on startup which I was told about by an I.T .	St
1.6.4	Technician where I work , or some sort of Software corruption to the Mouse drivers or registry .	St
1.6.5	Anyway , taking the cover off seems to solve the problem , so would investing in another fan solve the prob ?	Ques
