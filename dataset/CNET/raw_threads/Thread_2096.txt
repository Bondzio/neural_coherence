I finnaly decided to get a new video card(current is fx 5500) cuz mine cant play new games anymore. Basicly I want a card with which I can play all the games coming out over the next year(SupCom, Hellgate, C&C 3 ect.) In septemer when I go to Univercity(hopefully)I plan to build a PC from scratch so the card is gotta last till then. Anyways I got some limitations when choosing a card 1st is that I only have 300 watts power output and 2nd I dont have a PCI - E slot so I'am limited to AGP cards. Anyways so far this is what I have come up with. http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2484234&CatId=0 So is there any other options for me? Also my budget is about 250CAN$. Any help or suggestions are appriciated. Thanks.
