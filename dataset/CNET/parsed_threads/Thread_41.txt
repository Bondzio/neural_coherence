<s> I am replacing the power source on an HP computer. </s>
<s> Had to order the replacement and it has a 4-pin video connector and the computer has a 3-pin connection. </s>
<s> Can I buy an adapter to convert the connector to a 3-pin or do I need to return the power source. </s>
<s> The power source is smaller in size than usual (thanks HP) and finding a replacement has not been easy. </s>
<s> Thanks for any info you may have. </s>

<s> Why no model numbers in your post? </s>
<s> Here's the forum tip that isn't showing up it seems. </s>
<s> The computer is an HP Pavilion 8533Z The original power source is a Delta Electronics Model DPS 160GB A Rev 00 HP P/N 0950-3623 The P9 (video?) </s>
<s> connector is a 3-pin Connector one green, 2 black wires The replacement is a Micro ATX 200W P4-12V Model MPS3ATX20 The connector is a 4-pin connector- 2 yellow and 2 black wires. </s>
<s> All other connectors appear to be the same </s>
<s> &quot;Only choose the 4 pin unit if you have the 4 pin plug connected to something in your PC, otherwise you do not need it.&quot; There may be extra connections that are never used. </s>
<s> You didn't reveal if the 3 pin is used on the old setup. </s>
<s> Sadly, I haven't found the service manual for that model, but did find the note and clue above. </s>

<s> what makes yourPower Supply an ATX 12 V. The 4 pin is the 12 volt power plug that many mobos use to power the CPU now. </s>
<s> [older mobos used the 5 volts or 3.3 volt connector] It's a mobo issue not a CPU issue. </s>
<s> A given CPU can be fed from the 4 pin 12 volt on a newer mobo and work without such a connector on a mobo not set up for that connector. </s>
<s> Had you plugged that in to the viseo card you would have fried video card for dinner. </s>
<s> Yellow wires are normally 12 volts [of course black wires are grounds / returns]. </s>
<s> I might guess that the Greeen is for 3.3 volts, HOWEVER 3.3 volts is normally Orange. </s>
<s> The only green wire in the standard is the PS-ON lead on pin 14 of the 20 pin connector or pin 16 of the 24 pin connector. </s>
<s> Check with HP before plugging anything in. </s>
