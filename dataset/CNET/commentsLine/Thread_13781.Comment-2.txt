when the system boots up??.
maybe you should do some troubleshooting.
maybe simply cpu overheating due to clogged fan/heat sink, or loss of other fans.
there are so many causes of freezing, and the least likely is a bad cpu.
imho you are simply ignoring what seems to be the real indications of what is wrong with your pc.
