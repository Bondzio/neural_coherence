<s> Hello First of all I would like to apologize if mu questions seem silly. </s>
<s> I have been into computers for a long time, but now that winter break is coming and I have some time to play games, I am ready to upgrade my computer. </s>
<s> I just bought a 24inch monitor and would like a video card that would make it look pretty. </s>
<s> First of all, this is the computer that I have - Sony vaio VGC-RB30, with following specs listed on this website: http://www.superwarehouse.com/Sony_VAIO_RB30C/VGC-RB30/ps/471790 I did upgrade my memory, I have 1.5 gigs. </s>
<s> I also have a geforce pci card in there but its kind of old (512mb, i believe its 6800). </s>
<s> I was looking to upgrade it to either GeForce 8800 GTX, Radeon 4850 or GeForce 9800 GTX. </s>
<s> I do not know if my power supply would allow for those and if it does not, what are my options. </s>
<s> Also, with my previous radeon card, I had problem of overheating. </s>
<s> I think my tower does not have good cooling system. </s>
<s> I did install two extra fans, but one went dead so when I play I have to place an outside (big home fan) by the computer. </s>
<s> I would also like to purchase a video card that I could transfer to a new computer when I have money to buy it. </s>
<s> For right now though I just want an upgrade. </s>
<s> Please, let me know what I should do! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I forgot to say that I would be willing to change the tower if it someone thinks its possible. </s>
<s> I do need a better cooling tower with a bigger supply. </s>
<s> My question is though how hard is it to change towers and which tower would my motherboard and other things fit into. </s>
<s> Thanks Again! </s>
<s> good work that would make your desk proud </s>
<s> If you have heat issues you must get a new case. </s>
<s> As for the power supply, you will need a new one get around a 500 watt but try to get over just to be safe you wont need more then 750 watts. </s>
<s> It is easy to swap out components from the old case unless Sony is annoying and built it so you can't take the stuff out. </s>
<s> Here are a couple things I recommend. </s>
<s> Cases:It doesn't really matter just get lots of fans but it looks like you have a micro ATX mobo so be sure your case is compatible with that:) Here are some good ones: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811103011 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119152 Power supplies: Get one with 80 or higher efficiency http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139005 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371015 Graphics:You only have a PCIx16 so you can get a PCI 2.0 card but you wont get the full potential: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103057 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127387 I hope this helps and fits your expectations, sorry for making it so long. </s>
