<s> Hello, I want to gift a gadget to my daughter leaving to Kuwait on Nursing employment to skype call, email, surfing, music and light computing, say writing a message etc. </s>
<s> No serious computing involved. </s>
<s> A laptop is heavy and unnecessary since no computer is involved in her job/work, but need a gadget with bigger monitor mainly to see others online when call, see movies, music etc. </s>
<s> Also at a low cost, but reliable. </s>
<s> I shortlisted 4. </s>
<s> Please guide me the best or an alternative one at nearby price: 1. </s>
<s> Coby Kyros 7&quot; 4 GB Wi-Fi Black Tablet $100 2. </s>
<s> BlackBerry PlayBook 7&quot; 32 GB Wi-Fi Black Tablet $176.95 3. </s>
<s> Coby Kyros 10.1&quot; 8 GB Wi-Fi Black Tablet prices from $149.99 4. </s>
<s> Coby Kyros MID8048 8&quot; 4 GB Tablet - Wi-Fi - Telechips Cortex-A5 1 GHz (Multi-touch Screen 800 x 600 SVGA Display - 1 GB RAM - Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich - HDMI) prices from $114.99 Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I'd load their Android on it to get more apps. </s>
<s> Why not a netbook and avoid learning why a tablet is not near a laptop? </s>

<s> From my suggestion you have to go with BlackBerry PlayBook.As it is a fast, powerful 7-inch tablet with HDMI output, and it is capable of advance multitasking and it also comes with adobe flash 10.2 for awesome experience. </s>
<s> How much the price? </s>
<s> But I dont think loading android on a B.Berry is easy, even loaded it will work faulty always. </s>
<s> What about the Coby thing? </s>
<s> No good? </s>
<s> You lead with prices for the playbook in your post and then ask which is odd. </s>
<s> But your questions are the same as others that want a PC/laptop and try to get a tablet then in a short while discover they need the PC to load or configure or do what they wanted in the first place. </s>
<s> If you don't have a PC you will learn why folk warned you later. </s>
