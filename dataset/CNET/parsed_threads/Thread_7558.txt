<s> Today I discovered that I have lost about half the info on a 2gb pin drive. </s>
<s> Needless to say, I am sick! </s>
<s> Awhile ago, we thought we were going to have to reinstall Windows, so I removed everything and put it on my pin drive. </s>
<s> Computer problems not totally resolved, so pending possible visit from serviceman, I've just been using the pin drive. </s>
<s> It was on my list to put info back on hard drive as a backup and still use pin drive as main, for now, but I never got around to it. </s>
<s> After reading recent e-mail from C-Net about how info can be lost from a pin drive, I was a little concerned (and can't say I wasn't warned). </s>
<s> Yesterday, the power flickered and computer rebooted on its own, with pin drive in. </s>
<s> Today, I try to access the folder that has about 800 mb of info; it's gone. </s>
<s> Rest of pin drive is okay. </s>
<s> Let this be a warning, I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else. </s>
<s> What was lost represents about 10 years of carefully-accumulated files that backup the cause I work for. </s>
<s> There will be some of the older stuff on floppies, but all recent, since I started using pin drives, is gone. </s>
<s> Don't let this happen to you! </s>
<s> You never know when the power will flicker, or you could even accidentally knock the pin drive out. </s>
<s> While 800MB is over your one common CDR, the entire 2GB fits on DVDR. </s>
<s> The cost of a DVDR blank is less than 1 buck here. </s>
<s> -&gt; Given a cost of 1 dollar, why aren't people creating such a backup? </s>

<s> Of course I should have done this! </s>
<s> Could a, should a, would a! </s>
<s> I'm just warning others to take this seriously. </s>
<s> Okay, I put a CD in and tried to transfer using Drag-to-Disc and the CD drive, but I get a message that Windows encountered a problem trying to copy this folder. </s>
<s> What's wrong? </s>
<s> This is a desktop Dell, only a couple months old, XP. </s>
<s> To avoid drag to CDR and such due to too many failures. </s>
<s> Try it the old fashioned way where we put our files in the hard disk, open up the CD recording software and create a data CD. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I sent this in once and it hasn't shown up, so something must have happened. </s>
<s> I came back in here and noticed that I had the wrong pin drive in. </s>
<s> I put the current one in and everything is there. </s>
<s> I can't tell you how thankful I am! </s>
<s> So, the question is, could a power loss cause data to be lost? </s>
<s> They have been very lucky to date. </s>
<s> But the file system is FAT32 (most) and a bit easy to corrupt. </s>
<s> -&gt; Your near brush with loss is a good way to learn about this issue. </s>
