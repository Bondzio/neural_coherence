I work at a historical society and use a couple of portable USB-powered scanners (Canon, Xerox) with a laptop to do just as you say.
Either brand and others can be had for &lt;$100.
By the way, scan black and white photos as full color, not greyscale, to get a good quality scan and be sure to save as TIF files.
You may want to scan at 600dpi as well to get the best image.
