I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit and have 4 GB of ram. I have replaced the CMOS battery twice with new ones thinking this is the problem. Does anyone know what else could be my problem?

There is that CRACK PIRATE VERSION of Ultimate 7 that we encounter at the shops and this is how it stops activation (by changing the clock.) Some folk bristle about this but we can't fix or help if that version is involved. One owner was jumping mad and threatened to sue because we put it on the machine. Since we only had the machine for 10 minutes we thought they should take the machine home and sue away. Bob
