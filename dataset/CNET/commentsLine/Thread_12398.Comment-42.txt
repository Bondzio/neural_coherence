i have the same printer, the xerox phaser 8560. so far, since i bought it, its perfect.
the quality of its printing is good and its very easy to setup.
i've been recommending it to my friends.
new phaser 8560 solid ink technology from xerox.
better prints, lower printing costs & less ink cartridge waste.
