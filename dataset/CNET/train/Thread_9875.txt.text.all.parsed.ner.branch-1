14722	5	198395	2132553	2132512	itintern	8/14/06 2:21 pm	1.15556526e12	been there....	i have been on the phone with sun a little bit and got some reccomendations on which machines they think would suit my needs. i have also done some researching on ibm, dell, hp and a few others machines also. i would just like to get some information about what others out there are doing and how it is working out for them. not to mention we will need long term support for this hardware so if sun is in financial disaray that could be disasterous. it is imperative that we not have this hardware be unsupported. if it were to go down.....lets just say many bad things that would effect us all would happen.
14722	6	198395	2132558	2132553	r. proffitt	8/14/06 2:32 pm	1.15556592e12	sun has billions in cash still.	you could make a case against every hardware maker on that area. the days of 7 year support seem to be long gone. sun is today your answer for multi-year hardware. the downside is that with the current advances those that want 10 year computers are bound to be upset in 2 years as what they bought is now 1/4 the speed of new and maybe 1/2 the price. be sure your goals are not conflicting on this area. if you jump into intel/amd powered servers (what's a mainframe?) then there is no issue as one box looks like another as you look at what google does for their server farms. they wouldn't give sun a call. bob

14722	8	198395	2133706	2133440	itintern	8/15/06 7:49 am	1.15562814e12	the only problem with that....	i have looked at the new mainframe systems as well. the only problem with them and the main reason we are looking at migrating off them is the cost. the main focus of this migration is long term cost savings. the goal is to lay out x number of dollars to save x^2 over the next several years. not to mention saving the company that kind of money while i'm at intern could almost guarentee me a job as long as i don't screw up the rest of everything too badly. haha!

14722	10	198395	2134105	2134007	itintern	8/15/06 11:05 am	1.1556399e12	would this not be considered homework?	as per my initial question....&quot;what have others done and how has it worked?&quot; i am in the middle of setting up a couple of simple test environments right now one for solaris and one for suse. the problems i am going to run into with those are the machines i have them running on are not even close to the configurations of how they would be implemented, but i think it is a good place to start. so again, i have looked at ibm both servers and newer mainframe units, dell, hp, and sun servers for hardware. i have looked at solaris, suse, red hat and aix op systems. i can look at the specs and the features all day, but i would like to know what others have been successful - or not- with and some of their experiences.

14722	14	198395	2137305	2137011	mainframekid	8/16/06 7:15 am	1.1557125e12	hey the mainframe cannot do everything	never said it could. the question here is can you move a current mainframe workload to intel or unix? a mainframe is not right for a specialised web environment like google or ebay or hosting the olympics website or even the us open tennis. but we are not talking of someone with the massive compute power requirements of these megalyths!! i think he said 50 mips. a mainframe is great at running a huge mix of data processing work consisting of integrated online transaction processing, webserving, database and batch. infact the mainframe is the true data processor that runs most of the leading enterprise businesses. we all benefit from a mainframe as we go about our daily lives - every day you touch the mainframe that sits behind things like atm, pos and many websites. if we switched off all mainframes today the world would stop. and many people forget just how complex batch - we are talking about doing i/o here and not raw horsepower.
