1.1.1	I have the following configuartion : Intel Pentium IV 2.4 GHz ( Non-HT ) Intel D845GEBV2 Board 512 MB DDR Inno3d GeForce FX 5500 256 MB , VIVO , AGP 8x ( supporting 4x ) Yesterday i moved my system upstairs and tried to connect it to the TV and it worked .	St
1.1.2	After about 3-4 hours i experienced some strange hangups ( but the card - graphics card ) was still working .	St
1.1.3	I removed the card and the hangups discontinued .	St
1.1.4	The graphics card to me was okay .	St
1.1.5	Today , when i tried to install the card again in the AGP slot .	St
1.1.6	it simply refused to boot up the system .	St
1.1.7	As soon as i start it , it hangs up , No Display , No moving forward .	St
1.1.8	No respone whatsoever .	St
1.1.9	Then , when i removed the card from the slot , the system works fine ( & lt ; -- i am on the same system atm ) .	St
1.1.10	I also noticed one of my DDR was not tight .	St
1.1.11	But i tightened it , and tried to repeat the process .	St
1.1.12	No luck !	Polite
1.1.13	I also tried to clear CMOS by removing the battery/cell .	St
1.1.14	and then still NO LUCK !	St
1.1.15	The card doesnt give any smell .	St
1.1.16	It is still in good condition .	St
1.1.17	No burning sings on it .	St
1.1.18	Except that I ca n't see whats beneath the heat sink .	St
1.1.19	It 's the 2nd week since i bought this card .	St
1.1.20	I believe my Graphics card is blown ?	Ques
1.1.21	Anything to check out ?	Ques
1.2.1	Your motherboard supports the Intel D845GE Chipset .	St
1.2.2	Besides your AGP connector you have Integrated ( on board ) Intel Extreme Graphics controller and 'Integrated retention mechanism ' .	St
1.2.3	It is possible that your graphics switched to the integrated and you need to disable it in the BIOS for your AGP Card to operate properly .	St
1.2.4	I have n't checked in a long time , but sort of remember for WinXP you keep clicking the F8 key while booting to get safe mode & the BIOS .	St
1.3.1	Let me write it this way , Whenever I try to put the Graphics Card in the AGP slot and try to restart the PC .	St
1.3.2	It just not responds .	St
1.3.3	I ca n't go the BIOS , Windows or anything if i have this card inserted .	St
1.3.4	As soon as i put the card out , it auto .	St
1.3.5	goes to onboard graphics and works abs .	St
1.3.6	fine .	Polite
1.3.7	I tried switching the graphics .	St
1.3.8	The only thing i can do in VIDEO CONFIG .	St
1.3.9	is select AGP/PCI , FRAME BUFFER AND APERATURE SIZE .	St
1.3.10	I switched between AGP/PCI , failed ! .	St
1.3.11	I cleared CMOS , nothing again .	St
1.3.12	The card was working tremendous yesterday .	St
1.3.13	What that suggests ?	Ques
1.3.14	Graphics card has gone bad ?	Ques
1.4.1	Depending on different computers , many automatically just switch the on board graphics to the new AGP card in the BIOS without doing anything .	St
1.4.2	If you have also tried disabling the on board graphics while the AGP card was out and then putting the card in without results , then you may have a defective AGP card .	St
1.4.3	AGP cards normally come with instructions and a disk .	St
1.4.4	Your mobo or computer instructions should also talk about the integrated/and AGP enabling/disabling features .	St
1.4.5	Sorry I ca n't help further .	St
1.5.1	Altough , i am going to call for repair/replacement on Saturday on warranty .	St
1.5.2	But , connecting to TV matters ? .	Ques
1.5.3	Can it blow up a card .	St
1.5.4	I inserted another card in the slot .	St
1.5.5	It worked fine .	St
1.5.6	So i am 98 % sure its the card now !	St
1.6.1	I have played with my comp on a tv a few times ... didnt have any problems .	St
1.7.1	No chance that the card was hit by a static discharge ?	Ques
1.7.2	If everything was properly grounded , sounds like it 's just a defective card .	St
1.8.1	It could be that some specific driver files for the card have become corrupted .	St
1.8.2	I seem to remember something like that happening to a friend of mine , however , I ca n't quite remember how he resolved the issue .	St
1.8.3	Probably by removing/replacing the corrupted driver files and then re-installing the card .	St
1.8.4	I also seem to remember something about video card and monitor conflicts ... but in that case I do n't think the card would 've worked at all .	St
