1.1.1	So I was wondering if it was possible to use an add-in card AND the intergrated video on a motherboard at the same time..like crossfire .	St
1.1.2	... .and if the intergrated video was nVidia that was/is set up as a PhysX to supplement the ATI add-in .	St
1.1.3	I am not sure if it is possible I have an original PhysX Ageia card ( PCI ) but now nVidia owns it and maybe they would not let such a thing work .	St
1.2.1	Like crossfire = No .	St
1.2.2	Let 's keep it short .	St
1.3.1	I know it would not look like crossfire ; thats ATI .	St
1.3.2	SLI is nVidia .	St
1.3.3	I just wanted to know if i could run them at the same time as physx and ATI	St
1.4.1	As you suspected , the code , the drivers would not do this .	St
