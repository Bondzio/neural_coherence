1.1.1	hi all, i have two internal HDDs, and i want to use both of them.	St
1.1.2	heres the catch, i want to install windows XP on both and i want them to be completely independent of each other.	St
1.1.3	probably a select menu on startup.	St
1.1.4	when i say completely independent i mean that these hard drives cannot access each other at all.	St
1.1.5	it must be as if ive physically replaced one hard drive with the other when i choose one at startup.	St
1.1.6	no apps, viruses or even windows processes can access both hard drives at the same time.	St
1.1.7	is this possible?	St
1.1.8	the computer is a gigabyte G31 motherboard and a E8400 chip.	St
1.1.9	the hard drives are two sata 250 GB	St
1.2.1	The Boot Magic feature of Partition Magic does what you ask with partition hiding.	St
1.2.2	Look into that.	St
1.3.1	Hd selector switch....use google.	St
1.3.2	Never tried one.	St
