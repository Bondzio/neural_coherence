1.1.1	I have been using a Netgear RangeMAX WPN824 wireless router for my home network for the past year or so .	St
1.1.2	We have 5 computers in our house , two wired desktops and 3 wireless laptops .	St
1.1.3	I also have a wired backup server and my son has XBOX 360 connected ( wired ) to use the XBOX Live service .	St
1.1.4	At any given time , we may have a few more machines connected when visitors come through or my daughter is home from college .	St
1.1.5	Aside from my son complaining about occasional lags with XBOX games , the router seems to be able to manage the load reasonably well .	St
1.1.6	I recently purchased a new D-Link DIR-655 Xtreme-N Gigabit router after reading the reviews .	St
1.1.7	I was hoping to improve range and performance .	St
1.1.8	After connecting the router and starting with default settings for the most part , our connections kept randomly dropping .	St
1.1.9	So I called D-Link tech support .	St
1.1.10	The rep told me that home routers are not meant to support more than 5 connections at a time .	St
1.1.11	I was really taken by surprise by this .	St
1.1.12	My question now is ... is that true across the board ?	Ques
1.1.13	What are the practical expectations of routers used for home networks ?	Ques
1.2.1	Until you feel the shared connection is too slow .	St
1.2.2	For instance most routers support about 250 wired connections ( that can be increased but let 's talk near stock settings ) and from 16 to 32 wifi connections all at the same time .	St
1.2.3	This is no issue save sharing the internet bandwidth here .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	... using a broadband cable modem service , it should be able to manage 6-10 connections at a time , correct ?	Ques
1.3.2	Especially a draft-N router I presume .	St
1.4.1	My old 802.11b router could service over a dozen machines .	St
1.4.2	Maybe more ?	Ques
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Mostly people who are hardcore gamers and have around 1-2 machines .	St
1.5.2	The tech support person probably did improvise though ... Eventurally firmware updates will fix the problem .	St
1.5.3	and do n't try flashing over a wireless connection , only wired , or you 'll brick your router .	St
1.5.4	I emphasize eventually .	St
1.5.5	One possibilty is that it can not handle many global connections , as in total connections from the the outside world to your network .	St
1.5.6	My DI-624 had a cap of 200 ; past that it would disconnect , so maybe someone is runing a p2p program like Limewire , Ares , Bittorrent , or Azureus .	St
1.5.7	This affects ( somewhat ) many routers , across brands .	St
1.5.8	Also , it may have a problem with its UPnP , like other d-link routers ( like mine ) .	St
1.5.9	I go around that by using portforward.com and manually fixing the firewall .	St
1.5.10	Some links that could help : www.portforward.com ( in case your UPnP is faulty and you have to manually port forward ) www.bittorrent.com -- & gt ; help -- - & gt ; keyword : router -- & gt ; BitTorrent Client -- Routers known to have problems with BitTorrent clients Sorry the link to the place is huge and would take up the whole page .	St
1.5.11	Should help a little bit .	St
1.5.12	gets updated .	St
