there are a tremendous range of options to create a very high speed system.
mine had a striped raid drive, over 2 gig of ram, a 256 nvidia go card, a 3 ghz processor, and a complex series of fans and cooling fins.
corrections are in bold.
nonetheless, this is just one of the many bad stories that i've heard about alienware support; sorry to hear it.
i personally would never buy a system from them after hearing stories like this.
i'll second that opinion to go to the bbb; you might even want to suggest a lawsuit.
this computer runs hot - and i mean super hot.
that makes sense, as it's powered by what looks like a pentium 4 prescott processor.
prescotts are known to run (extremely) hot in desktops; they are not suited for use in laptops.
i personally had a prescott (3.2ghz) in my (ex-hp) computer.
the cpu regularly acheived temperatures above 60c and fried after about 9 months of use.
