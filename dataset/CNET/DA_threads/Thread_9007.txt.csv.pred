1.1.1	Previously I was trying to setup a pre-n router with another computer using the pre-n pci wireless card .	St
1.1.2	Because of software issues from Linksys , I downgraded to the SRX router , and I 'm using the 54g + speedbooster pci wireless card in the other pc to connect wirelessly .	St
1.1.3	My other laptop connects to the internet just fine , as well as the hardwired pc .	St
1.1.4	The PC running the linksys card is running XP and we just upgraded to 512mb ram .	St
1.1.5	I believe it 's a 1.7mhz so it 's not a terribly old computer .	St
1.1.6	Well , we finally got all the hardware and software installed , and the computer is able to acccess the internet , but whenever you try to change to another website other than the initial one that 's bookmarked , the computer restarts itself .	St
1.1.7	Any ideas on why it might be doing this or how to get it resolved ?	Ques
1.1.8	After the whole Pre-N problem , I 'm about ready to toss this Linksys stuff out the window .	St
1.1.9	Not sure if this would apply , but the PC has also updated to run the new explorer 7 version .	St
1.1.10	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated !	Polite
1.2.1	This is still a problem , is there any suggestions from anyone to why the computer might be doing this ?	Ques
1.3.1	Why do I note that ?	Ques
1.3.2	See a post I made at http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html ? forumID=5 & threadID=225224 & messageID=2356803 Some machines are rebooting or blue screening with some versions of Broadcom drivers .	St
