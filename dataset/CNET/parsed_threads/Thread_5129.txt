<s> I have an inspiron 1525. </s>

<s> What if you set the wallpaper to none? </s>

<s> Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> I can't get to anything because EVERYTHING is covered by the wallpaper. </s>
<s> I need for the wallpaper to go away so I can get to the start button, icons, ect. </s>
<s> Any more suggestions? </s>
<s> Then a right click on the desktop would let me set the wallpaper. </s>
<s> Sorry but I have to disagree with you about the wallpaper covering the icons. </s>
<s> I think the machine has the usual malware damage. </s>
<s> Repairs vary with the user's skill level. </s>
<s> I see you posted in the Newbie forum so I'm guessing you don't do a lot of PC repairs. </s>
<s> Here's an article so you can get your files out of the machine then restore the PC to its factory issued OS &quot;load&quot;. </s>

<s> I've tried right clicking and nothing happens. </s>
<s> Duplication of effort. </s>
<s> Locking this one. </s>
<s> Please continue in the newbies forum. </s>
<s> However I'm getting the feeling this is your first encounter with a balky machine. </s>
