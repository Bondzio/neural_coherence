I'm going to be doing mostly regular computer tasks, like word processing, internet browsing, more than a bit of photo editing, and a lot of music playing (not much video/audio editing that i could think of). Would it be worth it to get the pro just for the discrete graphics card, processor that's a little faster, and a 2 inch larger screen? Does it make that much of a difference, and is there anything that I'm missing that'd make the pro the (much) better choice?

As far as screen real estate, I find the MacBook's 13.3 inches a lot roomier than I had imagined. Why not go to an Apple store and play around to see which screen you like better?

Why do you want to use a lesser OS when you have a superior OS. The Macbook, *currently* has an integrated graphic card which take s aaway a bit of your Mac's RAM. For Vista this MIGHT work. But I am pretty sure that for Vista premium with the Aero theme and all the fancy stuff, you will need a powerful graphic card, maybe even more powerful than the Pro's card. Maybe the Macbooks will get updated or maybe they wont come out at all. If you DO need Windows, then you can install XP which is in some ways better than Vista.
