<s> Hi, I have just bought a 400GB Freecom external hard drive. </s>
<s> I plugged it in and it seems to work OK but all my mp3s now sound distorted. </s>
<s> I thought at first it was just the mp3s I put on the hard drive. </s>
<s> But infact its all sound played on my computer whether on the Freecom, on my internal hard drive, or from the internet. </s>
<s> Has anyone come across this before? </s>
<s> I think my computer might have USB 1 rather than USB 2 but Im not sure how to find out. </s>
<s> It shouldnt affect the sound either way though should it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> It's basically just a mass storage device, so the connection of an external hard drive shouldn't affect the quality of your sound. </s>
<s> In any case, here are some things to check: * Did this problem start immediately after you connected the external hard drive or was it down the road a ways? </s>
<s> * Just to make sure, try unplugging the external hard drive and see if the problem remains. </s>
<s> * Check that the speaker connection(s) is (are) firm...if a plug isn't in all the way it can cause distortion. </s>
<s> * Try using a different set of speakers with the computer to rule them out. </s>
<s> Alternatively, try connecting the speakers to a CD player, stereo, etc and see if the problem still exists. </s>
<s> * Check Device Manager to see if there is an issue with the audio drivers. </s>
<s> * Try downloading the latest software/drivers for your sound card from the manufacturer's website. </s>
<s> Also, please include the following information about your setup: * Basic PC specs, including processor and RAM * Operating system installed * Sound card (make/model) * Speakers (make/model) If there are details about your computer, such as sound card, that you don't know, the free program Everest will help determine the specs. </s>

<s> Many are blissfully unaware about motherboard and other drivers for their machine until they see an issue like yours. </s>
<s> Microsoft does not fetch or find the latest drivers so you must think back to the old ways of making sure your motherboard and other drivers are current. </s>
