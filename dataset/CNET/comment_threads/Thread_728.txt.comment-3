The original SP2.
During installation, I partitioned the disc in half.
Here is what Belarc advisor says: 104.86 GB Usable Hard Drive Capacity 102.00 GB Hard Drive free space Now I'm using the Disk Manager of XP, created a second partition of 90 GB from the unallocated space, formatted, but still have unallocated space which I cannot format to use as a third partition (the only options right-click gives are &quot;New Partition, Properties and Help&quot;.
Here is what I have right now (from Disk Manager) 1- C: 97.66 GB 2- E: 87.89 GB 3- Unallocated space : 93.94 GB.
Still have about 20 GB missing (Windows XP should not take that much).
