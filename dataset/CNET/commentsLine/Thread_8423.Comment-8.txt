all, thanks much for your help, after reading all the problems with xp & sata drives, i just loaded vista and all went fine.
i will work on a way to load xp as well, but for now it is up and running.
hard to believe ms doesn't have an easy fix, especialy when floppy drives are a thing of the past.
thanks again.
tom
