<s> I have tried to install OFFICE XP Service Pack 3 on my Win 2000 machine and it always tells me the installation was unsuccessful. </s>
<s> I have used the 17 MB package and the 54 MB and get the same thing. </s>
<s> I checked the programs that come with the Office programs and they all show that I have SP3 but the automatic update says I need to install it. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with this? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
