<s> Your post implies that you haven't used this device on this particular machine before. </s>
<s> I looked up you specs, but they don't specify usb 2.0 or 1.1. </s>
<s> You can look here: Start/Control Panel/System/hardware tab/Device Manager. </s>
<s> Click the plus sign beside the universal serial bus conrollers. </s>
<s> Look for any description that says usb2. </s>
<s> If not listed there, your system may support usb 1.1 only. </s>
<s> all it says is... ALi pci to usb open host controller and usb root hub </s>
<s> i found this 2 USB, 1 Parallel IEEE 1284 (EPP/ECP), 1 Serial RS-232, 1 Keyboard / mouse Generic, 1 Headphones Output, 1 Microphone Input, 1 Display / video VGA, 1 Display / video S-video output, 1 Modem Phone line, 1 Network Ethernet 10Base-T/100Base-TX does this mean yes or no? </s>
<s> and would i get the correct drivers if i did the factory instal? </s>
<s> It appears that your hardware is usb 1.1. </s>
<s> If it were usb 2.0, Windows xp will install it's own drivers for that. </s>
<s> If you have an open pci slot, you may be able to buy a usb 2.0 pci card to upgrade to 2.0. </s>
<s> Otherwise you just have to accept 1.1 speeds. </s>
