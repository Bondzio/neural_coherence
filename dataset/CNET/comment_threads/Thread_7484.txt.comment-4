Cory, Oh, I'm sure it will work perfectly in G mode -- that isn't the problem.
The problem is that G mode isn't fast enough for what I need (my existing Linksys works fine in G mode as well -- but I need about double the speed of what G mode can provide).
As I said, I'm streaming very high bitrate files (I need at least 29mbps).
The lower rate files I stream (anything less than 10GB total size) work fine.
I will need to run the DIR-655 in N exclusive mode in order to get it to do what I want.
