Recently, I bought a few upgrades for my desktop.
After a few hours of troubleshooting, I still can't get the thing to boot up.
The only thing that I can think of at this point is that maybe the power supply isn't strong enough to handle everything.
Here is a list of the upgraded parts: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128514 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&N=-1&isNodeId=1&Description=evga+geforce+560&x=0&y=0 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139023 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103727 Any help resolving the issue woul dbe greatly appreciated.
