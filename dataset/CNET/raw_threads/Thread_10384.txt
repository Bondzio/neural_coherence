10671	0	318386	2918073	NR	10mccutl	11/30/08 7:38 PM	1.22807388E12	A newbie building a computer...oh no	I have decided to build my own gaming rig to shave some $, and I am in need of some guidance. So far I've semi-decided on the following parts: Motherboard- -ASUS P5N-T Deluxe Motherboard Video Card -EVGA GeForce 9800 GT Video Card Processor- -Q9650 Intel Core 2 Quad Proc Hard-drive- -Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB RAM -Kingston 1GB(x3) 667MHz DDR2 I know that I haven't listed an optical drive, case or monitor but that's not really a concern. Anyway, my question is, am I missing anything important? Is this a terrible mixture of components? Am I off my rocker? Any help, advice, suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

So the easier you make...the better chance you'll have for getting help. Feel free to start with the ASUS MB but it looks to me like its really a crapshoot or just crap. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=ASUS+P5N-T+Deluxe&x=0&y=0 You didn't indicate a PSU...pretty important component and 1GB RAM ain't enough for a high-end PC with a Q9650. I'd also look at the WD640GB...the WD6400AAKS or WD6401AALS. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136218 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136218 VAPCMD

Motherboard- -ASUS P5N-T Deluxe Motherboard http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?modelmenu=1&model=1981&l1=3&l2=11&l3=610&l4=0 Video Card -EVGA GeForce 9800 GT Video Card http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=33091&vpn=512-P3-N971-TR&manufacture=eVGA Processor- -Q9650 Intel Core 2 Quad Proc http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SLB8W Hard-drive- -Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2795126 RAM- -Kingston 1GB(x3) 667MHz DDR2 http://www.jr.com/kingston/pe/KGS_KVR667D2S51/ I totally forgot to mention the PSU, but I've one that works so no problems there. As for the RAM I indicated 3X but that was probably too small, sorry. The motherboard is where most of my uncertainty lies and I'm definitely not set in my ways with regard to that particular one.

Re the 3 GBs RAM....OK if you get 2 @ 1GB and 2 @ 512MB but you don't want 3 @ 1GBs ... you need RAM in pairs to maximize system performance. If it were mine, I'd just bump it to 4GB RAM total....then there's no need to worry about upgrading later. Re the MB....ditto my comments above. While ASUS usually makes decent MBs...buyer comments on the model you've proposed are poor at best. Re the HDD....WD640GB has better ratings and higher density per platter. Last....re PSU....make sure it's a decent PSU..there's lots of pretty ones that aren't worth anything. VAPCMD

Any thoughts on how the Core 2 Duo E8400 Wolfdale 3.0GHz would hold up? It seems like enough and I've heard a lot of good things about it. http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=27784&vpn=bx80570e8400&manufacture=intel . As for the mobo/graphics card combo, I can see myself going sli in the future, so the p5q pro you suggested seems like a good choice. With that extra money in mind, I could go upgrade to the gtx 260 like you suggested and spring for a better hd and ram, (any preferences on the latter?)
