<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> I recently recieved a Siemens SE505 Wireless Router. </s>
<s> The quick installation guide told me to first disallow Windows from configuring the Wireless Network. </s>
<s> Once I had done that, I had to change the SSID of the adapter to ConnectionPoint. </s>
<s> Once I had done this, the Computer could see the router, and I had excellent signal strength. </s>
<s> I then had to enter the IP address of the router and this would allow me to configure the router. </s>
<s> I configured it, was able to surf the net, and everything was fine. </s>
<s> I then went again to the cofiguration page, and enabled WEP encryption and MAC control (if that is how one refers to that). </s>
<s> Then I logged out, and since then, I have never been able to connect to the router. </s>
<s> I always have excellent signal strength, but I can never connect to the router or enter the cofiguration state. </s>
<s> When I type in the routers address in Firefox or Explorer, I get the message saying the connection was refused. </s>
<s> I tried both enabling and disabling WEP on my adapter, but niether setting helps. </s>
<s> I tried the factory reset on the router which should have reset all passwords and settings, but i still have no luck. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is relevant, but when I directly enter my routers IP address and Subnet mask rather than saying to look for the IP address automatically (as i am supposed to do), I am able to enter the configuartion pages. </s>
<s> However, I cannot connect to the Internet when I log on to the router this way. </s>
<s> I have also tried updating the firware, and this also has not helped. </s>
<s> I would greatly appreceate any help or info. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> How do you know all this works? </s>
<s> Go back to factory settings and try each item one by one. </s>
<s> What no one tells you is that all this doesn't always work. </s>
<s> If you don't like that, return the defective product. </s>
<s> In closing, another thing no one tells you is the &quot;new&quot; product can arrive with out of date firmware and drivers. </s>

<s> BTW, what MAC address did you enter? </s>
<s> Your router mac address or your Ethernet card mac address? </s>
<s> With WEP enabled, usually you need to enter username and password - add it manually in your wireless network configuration. </s>
<s> I entered. </s>
<s> But it shouldn't make a difference once I've reset the router, should it? </s>
<s> I am going to try the reset again, and try all the options. </s>
<s> Excuse my networking illiteracy here, but does Windows automatically know to try and reach the router address (when i type it in) using the wireless connection, and not my regular internet connection (which is offline)? </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies. </s>
<s> Nothing is &quot;automatic&quot;. </s>
<s> The wizards may help or they may not. </s>
