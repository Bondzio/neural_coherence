I know a little bit about computers but I would be too scared to try replacing the drive myself.
Getting someone else to do it is costly.
So I'd probably go the external USB route.
But that's at least $60 on eBay at the cheapest and of course money is tight these days.
I just wanted to make sure I had exhausted all possible avenues before buying a new one.
Anybody got any other suggestions for me on how to fix this one?
