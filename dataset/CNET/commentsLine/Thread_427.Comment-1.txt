i have been looking around online at a bunch of stores, and i found some computers that says the computer has dedicated memory, even though it's an igp.
is this true?
just wondering, this confused me.
(you might have to go down to specs/bullet list area to find it.
and there are couple other products like this.)
i know they could be lieing, but are they telling the truth?
