<s> My college has a network, their dhcp will allot us a xx.xx.67.xx ip (Wifi), i found that in their lab they use a different proxy that is restricted for our ip range(Squid) (xx.xx.1.xx is their ip range). </s>
<s> when i am manually configure my network interface to their ip range it doesn't ping to the both proxy, but in default dhcp i can ping both. </s>
<s> Is there any emulators that can emulate my ip address to their range of ip ? </s>
<s> so that i can fool squid ? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> It would help knowing what you are trying to achieve, but your college network is likely designed to keep the student network distinctly separate from the classroom network. </s>
<s> There is no emulator that would fool this system of security. </s>
<s> You would need to contact the network administrator if you need access to those lab resources. </s>
<s> If you want to use an IP nothing stopped you from setting such manually on almost any PC to date. </s>
<s> So no fooling required! </s>
