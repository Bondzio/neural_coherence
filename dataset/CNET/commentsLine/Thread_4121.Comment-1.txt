the following machine is going to be the general-purpose family machine.
this means that it will mostly be used for web surfing, office utilities, etc.
no one in the family is a gamer (yet), so it does not need to be optimized for gaming.
i might hook it up to the entertainment system for the digital home experience, but im not dead-set on that.
the one thing i do want it optimized for is video editing.
for the past three years i have been using pinnacle studio (versions 8 and 9) on my dell x300 to do video editing.
i will keep using this for a while on the new machine, but ultimately want to jump to something more high-end.
since i havent decided which editor to go with when i do upgrade (adobe, avid, vegas), i am getting a cheapish video card right now.
so, i need a decent, stable system that is capable of low-end video editing right now and can be upgraded in the near future.
oh yeah, and i probably will not be doing much tweaking, although overclocking still remains a possibility.
the following set-up is just about the limit of what i can spend.
as far as the alternate options go, i can probably add up to $100, but that is it (i.e all of the alternate options are not a possibility).
any and all feedback is more than welcome!
