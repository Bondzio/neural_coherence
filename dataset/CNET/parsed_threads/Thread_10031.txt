<s> I did my research, but I still couldn't find a solution. </s>
<s> I had 2 DDR 512mb ram pc3200 bars A year ago I installed 2 more 512mb DDR pc3200 modules, and it read in bios it is 1gb of ram but I managed to solve it somehow. </s>
<s> A week ago I changed their places, but restored everything as it was before I started &quot;solving&quot; another problem. </s>
<s> The two old bars are double sided and new ones are single, both 400mhz. </s>
<s> When everything was ok, double where placed on green slots and single on purple. </s>
<s> Every module works fine on its own, and 2 double or one single & one double or 2 single also work fine. </s>
<s> Motherboard is MSI K8N Neo4. </s>
<s> What to do? </s>
<s> You could have an issue with the number of chip selects available and the &quot;density&quot; of the ram. </s>
<s> The fact that each pair works on its own is interesting but does not mean that both pairs can work at the same time. </s>
<s> It's very technical and I will not write the long answer anymore. </s>
<s> But to fix this I'll order the sticks from Crucial.com Bob </s>
