<s> I would like to find out if the USB ports on my Toshiba Satellite 5205-S503 can power a portable storage device such as the Lacie Porche mobile hard drive (80 GB 5400 rpm). </s>
<s> I looked in devices & found only the manufacturer (NEC) & the driver version (5.1.2600). </s>
<s> I'm it is US. </s>
<s> B 2.0. </s>
<s> Short of calling the manufacturer how do I find out? </s>
<s> Thank-you </s>
<s> USB 1.x or 2.0's power is 500 milliAmps and every laptop drive I see listed 1.0 to 1.5 Amperes. </s>

<s> You can get ab optional AC adapter with that product. </s>
<s> Adaptec has an enclosure for 2.5&quot; hard disk drives that pull power from two USB ports or an optional AC adapter. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Agree with Bob , however that drive is sold as a USB/Firewire external so there are two possibilities. </s>
<s> You can try a USB splitter cable that has two plugs that plug into two of yourusb ports and deliver the sum of the two ports' output to your device. </s>
<s> I have been using this arrangement for over a year with no problems.However in the event that your laptop can't put out enough juice you can get a very small USB adapter that you connect to one of the cable branches while the other plugs into your computer for data transfer. </s>
<s> I think you'll find the first arrangement will work for you as an inexpensive approach Regards Seewart </s>
