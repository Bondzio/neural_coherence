1.1.1	Hi everyone : I notice that when using Word 97 my cpu temp shoots up dramatically .	St
1.1.2	This does not happen at all with openOffice .	St
1.1.3	My PC 's got Windows XP Home , 250 RAM , P4 2.4 GHz .	St
1.1.4	Can anyone explain this ?	Ques
1.2.1	All CPU 's will heat up when they are busy , Openoffice is open source and as with most open source Programs and OS 's It 's light and easy on hardware , whereas Microsoft word is more heavy and power hungry , Can I ask what tempreatures you are experiencing , Normal running 50oC could be acceptable , but more than that and you are looking at instability and a reduced lifetime .	St
1.3.1	That 's not compatible with XP and it 's a known bug .	St
1.3.2	Microsoft will not be issuing a fix .	St
1.3.3	While Word 97 does run , it has this and at least two other bugs .	St
1.3.4	Again , no patch will be arriving for these issues .	St
1.3.5	Ever .	St
1.3.6	Forget about it .	St
1.3.7	What to do ?	Ques
1.3.8	- Endtask Word when it hangs like that .	St
1.3.9	- Try the usual Word cureall .	St
1.3.10	Delete all NORMAL.DOT files .	St
1.3.11	- Go get Open Office from http : //www.openoffice.org and use it instead .	St
1.3.12	Sorry about that , but I have to be direct and brutal about this issue since I found if just be subtle , people miss the message .	St
1.3.13	Bob	St
1.4.1	Oh , sorry I did n't know about the bug , wish I could have been more help , but I still think you should post your temps , so You can make sure that your CPU is ok , Even if not your motherboard probably had failsafe procedures anyhow , Why not upgrade office , THe student editions are reasonable priced .	St
1.5.1	Thanks for your advice .	Polite
1.5.2	Not sure how high cpu temp might reach but it gets to 55 - 56C pretty quickly and that 's when I decide to close down Word 97 .	St
1.5.3	Do you think Word XP would be more compatible ?	Ques
