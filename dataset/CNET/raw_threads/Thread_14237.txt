I've always been tweaking computers, whether it is installing new ram, new hard drives, installing Operating Systems, so instead of buying a dell like i usually do, i figured that I'd just build my own and save some money. But I need some help. First of all, which brands are the best for the following? 1. Case 2. Processor (I'm pretty sure I want Intel from what I've read about) 3. Motherboard 4. Video Card ( 5. Ram Memory 6. Hard Drive (SATA or IDE) 7. LCD Monitor Also, I'm not looking for budget parts/brands. I'm a light gamer, Like the Sims 2, Starcraft, Warcraft III, Rollercoaster Tycoon Games, I will eventually buy Starcraft 2. Also, I do some small photo editing. Suggestions for brands, types, sizes of the computer parts would be awesome.
