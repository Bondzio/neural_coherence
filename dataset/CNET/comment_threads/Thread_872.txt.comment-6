Sometimes I wonder how I miss such things.
But the 2200 might be the DGN2200 which is why I asked.
http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/dgn2200.aspx Keep in mind that Netgear's latest may not be their best version (research their iPad connect issues.)
As Netgear does not publish an user manual I won't be able to provide an exact answer.
Again, I see you may dislike this but in the future be sure to select routers that have a manual.
