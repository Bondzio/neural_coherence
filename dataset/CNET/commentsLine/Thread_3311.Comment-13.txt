plan ahead.... i would leave the 32 bit realm and go for an amd athlon 64, socket 939. judging by what your spending on vid card you must do some gaming.
i wouldn't put any money in a cpu that is basically obsolete before you get it.
there's a lot of agrument over the piv verses the 64. i am currently running a 64 and it will humble any piv out there.
you are shopping in the right place.
the best prices and service.
have fun & good luck
