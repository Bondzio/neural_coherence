<s> Hi buyer brown here Hope all is well I wanted to know: Since I feel safe to say that computers no longer come with floppy drives anymore And it seems that I have been reading a lot about flash drives are suppose to be the new floppy, Although I have yet to find one that acts like a floppy on any of my pcs I tried The Hp solution and some other tutorials but none of them have worked for me as of yet. </s>
<s> Of course I change the boot order as well, No dont get me wrong Im sure that it works in some way just not for me or Im doing something wrong So what are Real IT pros using is it better to just get a portable floppy drive and why and why dont computer creators just make it so usbs also act like a floppy they knew floppy was dead and something had to replace it Thanks </s>
<s> Can you share why we need this? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> But what if the CD Rom doesnt work and if you dont use floppy utilities then what do you use when things go wrong Im sure you Know of IT personal using floppies to boot up a system to work on a pc that has gone south Now keep in mind that Im just learning about Networking and batch files and such But I know the whole dos on disk was used to fix a lot of trouble, even to the point where portable floppy drives where made so one could still use such utilities. </s>
<s> So ok if Im way off base then what do IT pros use now to work on a pc that a CD Rom wont work and needs to boot into a messed up system thanks </s>
<s> hardware support in a big company will either just swap the hard drive or swap the entire unit and then dump the user's data on a network share after it's been retrieved. </s>
<s> and with most newer systems, the bios can be configured to boot from a usb device, so a usb flash drive with bart-pe or a linux distro is all that's needed. </s>
<s> If your necessary I/O is dead, fix it first. </s>
<s> And check that RAMs are OK. </s>
<s> I never asked you to argue with me, am I frustrating you or something? </s>
<s> I just wanted to understand what happen to the use of floppies and there utilities and how people used them and if they are used at all anymore Im sure you were not born an IT pro and neither was I It appears that the I/O between me and you is what needs replaced. </s>
<s> Thank you kindly for your advice, but you can DEL [drive:] [path] your Attitude [/P] </s>
<s> So ramarc Are you saying as far as any newer systems I would ever come across say after 3yrs When I graduate would be completely USB based and a good working knowledge of Linux in general and in trouble shooting would be to my benefit </s>
<s> I'd think you best be prepared to boot from floppy OR CD OR DVD OR USB Flash OR whatever next comes along. </s>
<s> Part of school means learning things that are out of date. </s>
<s> For example, your A+ certification requires you know what wire is DSR on COM1, and to know DOS error codes. </s>
<s> Don't be misled that you'll actually use that knowledge. </s>
<s> Nor a floppy drive, in most cases. </s>
<s> The bigger picture is getting a good understanding of how things work, generally, so that you'll be able to adapt to the rapidly-changing IT world. </s>
<s> I think I see your point There is no way to know whats coming but no matter what it is Will be based on what has been in some sort of way. </s>
<s> A good base in how it all works, will give me the skills I need to adapt to whatever comes Thank you for your input Ill keep all the lessons that I have learned from these post in mind </s>
<s> Simple, portable, fast, fewer moving parts, larger storage space. </s>
<s> I seldom use anything else. </s>
<s> Just an occasional DVD movie on the DVD drive/player. </s>
<s> I also back up to a second Hard drive. </s>
<s> The real professionals uses other drives to back things up to on specialized computers called servers. </s>
<s> They might also make backups to off-site locations to avoid disasters. </s>
<s> This explanation is an oversimplification to reduce confusion, this can be very complicated in the real world. </s>
<s> Given today's support costs it's too cheap to fix that fix. </s>
<s> Also there is little that fits on a diskette that would help get in. </s>
<s> Now I'm writing about the systems I run into and not those old DOS based Windows. </s>
<s> The DOS networking would incur TOO HIGH A SUPPORT COST and few would find the needed DOS driver for the network card do that's a dead end. </s>
<s> Maybe if you had unlimited time and no budget but why would anyone go there? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So, It's unwise to use a DOS system because of over head. </s>
<s> So why did you &quot;go there&quot;.....too DOS I mean? </s>
<s> http://youtube.com/watch?v=ejweI0EQpX8 </s>
<s> I see I typo'd too much there. </s>
<s> I see many confuse going to DOS with going to a command line. </s>
<s> DOS is rarely usable to access today's systems. </s>
<s> I still may find an old system I want to update the BIOS to enable a memory upgrade but that's it. </s>
<s> The command line is a great skill to have. </s>
<s> You can boot (XP, others) to a command prompt to repair small annoyances such as a file that won't delete in Explorer and many other things. </s>
<s> Not that you have to learn the entire command set but deleting a file is all of TWO commands to learn. </s>
