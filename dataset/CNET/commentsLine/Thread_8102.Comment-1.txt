i must replace the hard drive in my ibm i1412 laptop.
the drive being replaced is marked &quot;ata/ide.&quot; question: must the replacement drive be ata/ide as well, or can it be ata 3, or ata 4, ultra, etc.?
finding a replacement drive described as simply ata/ide has been difficult.
im unable to determine if my motherboard supports any of the variant interfaces.
