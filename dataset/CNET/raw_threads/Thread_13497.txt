However, I don't think this problem I'm asking for advice on has to do w/ the cartridge: this time when the black ink ran out, I never got the message on the little screen &quot;low ink&quot; replace ink soon or whatever, my copies just got so faint that I replaced the cartridge. Now, the message on my little screen says, &quot;press enter to align cartridges&quot; and, when I do so, it begins and the screen reads: &quot;printing align cartridge page&quot; then it goes about it's business for a minute then says, &quot;alignment failed, please try again&quot; and I can't get past this... over and over. I take the cartridge out, I replace the cartridge, I even got a new cartridge and, even tho I'm only replacing the black, I take the color out too and reinsert it: nothing... and no option to just clear the error and use the machine as is... I can't even send faxes out which requires no ink at all... any advice? thanks

You have to press and hold the 'enter' button, then press 'setup' Here's the HP support document on it: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=us&docname=bpu00657&product=60259&dlc=en&lang=en
