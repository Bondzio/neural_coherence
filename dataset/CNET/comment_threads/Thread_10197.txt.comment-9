98% of getting your printer fixed is &quot;attitude&quot; and being in the warranty &quot;zone&quot;.
I hope you've vented enough here so when you call it in that you are the nicest cup of tea that the person on the other end has had in days.
If you tell them all that you have here, then they may not want to deal with you.
Hope this has helped you, Bob
