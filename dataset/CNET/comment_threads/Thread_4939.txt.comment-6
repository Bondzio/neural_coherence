Here's what Intel's P4 data sheet says about the THERMTRIP condition.
My interpretation of this is that the system is still powered but the system clocks are stopped (or the CPU clock at least) and, probably, certain voltages lowered.
Here's Intel: The processor protects itself from catastrophic overheating by use of an internal thermal sensor.
This sensor is set well above the normal operating temperature to ensure that there are no false trips.
The processor will stop all execution when the junction temperature exceeds approximately 135C.
This is signalled to the system by the THERMTRIP# (Thermal Trip) pin.
Once activated, the signal remains latched, and the processor stopped, until RESET# goes active.
There is no hysteresis built into the thermal sensor itself; as long as the die temperature drops below the trip level, a RESET# pulse will reset the processor and execution will continue.
If the temperature has not dropped below the trip level, the processor will continue to drive THERMTRIP# and remain stopped.
