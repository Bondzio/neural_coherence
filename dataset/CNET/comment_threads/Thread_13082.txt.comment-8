I read and followed the suggestions of kaufmanmoore - at first I couldn't get the host desktop to create a new local port, but then, being a basically paranoid guy, I uninstalled both instances of Network Magic (came with the Zyxel router)from each machine, and backed up each to a date prior to NM's initial install.
Worked like a charm!
Now I'd hate to be left thinking that the folks at Network Magic slipped a gremlin into their software that causes newbies like me to think nothing will work except buying that expensive solution, but, ...
I do anyway.
Only problem left is I'm still getting a message each time the laptop prints that says the printer driver needs updating - However, I did dl the new needed driver, but since there is no actual printer to install in the laptop, I had to manually install the driver, and it installed into the same folder in dl'ed into.
I suspect that's incorrect.
Any final suggestion on how I can get it into a better location?
Thanks Rick - I appreciate your invaluable assistance.
