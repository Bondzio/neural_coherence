the processor fan extracts all heat from the processor and removes it out of the cpu so that your cpu doesn't get heated.
no need to change it's position.
it can cost you a whole cpu to whole computer.
anyway, what temp bios is showing?
till 50-60 degree(c).
it is okay.
if it is beeping in less temp than that, disable the waring beeps in bios.
