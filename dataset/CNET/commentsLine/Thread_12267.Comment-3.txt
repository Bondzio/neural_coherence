i didn't have to do anything to make this work.
if you have a ht enabled cpu, and have either xp pro or xp home with sp1 slippstreamed into the distorbution media, then ht worked fine for me.
i got in a older hp media cenetr pc that was stripped except for the cpu and mobo.
three finger csalute the machine and see how many cpus taskmanager sees.
if that doesn't work i will look in the bios.
