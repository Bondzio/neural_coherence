1.1.1	as I ponder buying a printer ( for printing sheet msuic and pdf 's thereof ) , i am wondering if I am going to see any real benefit from a 1200 as opposed to a 600 dpi printer .	St
1.1.2	any insights folks ?	Ques
1.1.3	-- fj	St
1.2.1	I 'll say & quot ; yes. & quot ; It was readily apparent as we moved from 300 DPI lasers to 600 and finally to 1200 DPI laser printers .	St
1.2.2	In that case we could put the mug shots on the warrants and the clarity was needed .	St
1.2.3	In & quot ; color & quot ; work , you do n't need as much dots , but more colors .	St
1.2.4	But for B/W such as music sheets , DOTS RULE .	St
1.2.5	And what really can make/break all those dots is the PAPER .	St
1.2.6	I can make 1200 DPI output look bad and 300 DPI look great by selecting which paper goes to which machine .	St
1.2.7	Welcome to the Guild of Pressman .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	600dpi fill about any need you should get into .	St
1.3.2	Of course if your picky or get into specific needs like CAD or such , then 1200 is better , but some printers use a & quot ; rastering & quot ; to smooth the jaggies into better output .	St
1.3.3	The scheme like from HP is firmware driven , maybe s/w too , but Canon better models offer the same to get 1200dpi effects as well as others , so *read* the specs to find out how they arrive at dpi rating , but most modern printers are 600dpi capable at least .	St
1.3.4	Your old HPIII was default at 300dpi .	St
1.3.5	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	hey robert- interesting .	Polite
1.4.2	I got an HP 1012. has 600 dpi with some sort of simulated 1200 which i do not understand .	St
1.4.3	anyway , can you give some guidance about what paper to buy for printing sheet music that will look better than this not-so-hot copy paper i got at staples ?	Ques
1.4.4	hopefully not photo paper ?	Ques
1.4.5	thanks !	Polite
1.4.6	fj	St
1.5.1	There are papers specifically optimized for laser printing and some for ink jet .	St
1.5.2	Others are just generic copy machine paper .	St
1.5.3	If you are interested in producing a quality product yourself , you will need to use quality materials .	St
1.5.4	Both HP an HammerMill make papers which specify their intent to be used on laser printers .	St
1.5.5	I prefer 24lb as a minimum .	St
1.5.6	If you examine the surface of laser papers versus others , you can see something about the sheen and lack of visible texture in them .	St
1.5.7	This must enhance their apparent sharpness compared to inkjets which rely somewhat on absorbsion characteristics .	St
1.5.8	Laser toners are fused with heat on top of the paper rather than be absorbed into the paper fibers as are inks .	St
1.5.9	It makes sense when you think about it .	St
1.5.10	Watch for the sale prices and promos and stock up when you can .	St
