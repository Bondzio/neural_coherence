I do and have found some difficulty in adjusting my Viewsonic CRT for a perfect edge to edge picture when looking directly in the middle.
I see some color distortion toward the edges which disappears when I move or turn my head.
Keeping it degaussed helps but isn't perfect.
I do get some color distortion my laptop's LCD screen as well.
It also lessens depending on my viewing position.
I suspect glasses cause some subtle color distortion when light is refracted and the color spectrum components separate.
