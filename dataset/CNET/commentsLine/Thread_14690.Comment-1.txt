i bought my vista 64 bit desktop 6 months ago and have been trying to connect two wireless laptops running xp.
i have been all over looking for help on the web.
hp will not help without paying more or will geek squad.
i have a linksys router wrt54g that i am using and both wireless laptops connect to the internet fine, but just can't get a network.
i have made sure all pcs have the same name and been through settings after settings.
can anyone help?
