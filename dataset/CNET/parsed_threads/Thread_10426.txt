<s> I bought my computer with 256MB memory but windows only shows 224MB. </s>
<s> What is the problem? </s>
<s> How can I fix it? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Buy more RAM................lots more! </s>
<s> theres no problem that happened to my computer, it's just that you might have a lesser quality ram in your computer (no need to worry) </s>
<s> You don't have RAM loss, you're just using 32MB for your video card. </s>
<s> If you want to get it back you can purchase a video card with 32MB on-board RAM (not shared) for less than $30.00. </s>
<s> You really aren't going to be getting much processing power back from this, though. </s>
<s> RAM is pretty cheap, it would probably be more cost efficient and gain you a lot more performance to just buy another 256 chip and be done with it. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
