<s> HELLO, Recently I upgraded the RAM to 2GB. </s>
<s> I have Intel Mother B. model: D102GGC2. </s>
<s> I'm using WIN XP HOME SP2. </s>
<s> When I changed the RAM to the new one, the windows immediately recognized it and at the control panel/system its shows OK. </s>
<s> But, when I'm using the computer like I did in the past, I don't see any changes (not with speed and not with functionality). </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions for me ? </s>
<s> Please send and answer. </s>
<s> Thank you very much, & Regards, SARA </s>
<s> Adding RAM above 1 Gig will not always, if ever, result in a noticable increase in performance. </s>

<s> Usually, it's to improve bragging rights. </s>
<s> Not that you did of course, but Windows is really pretty good at allocating RAM and its use. </s>
<s> I have four machines with only one Gig of RAM. </s>
<s> Any more, in my case, is wasted. </s>

<s> As I run my normal stuff I watch the swap file. </s>
<s> If there is a lot of swapping going on then more ram might be of help. </s>
<s> If there is not much swapping going on then adding ram might be of limited value. </s>
<s> If you feel the machine is slow and there is not much swapping then the bottleneck is in some other area. </s>

<s> I was lucky a few years ago to have 2 identical machines right down to the same make/model of everything. </s>
<s> We had a DVD rendering job that took 6 HOURS. </s>
<s> The test runs were made and then the machine's ram sticks were switched and the test rerun. </s>
<s> Both machines ran XP. </s>
<s> The machine with 1GB finished the 6 hour task ahead of the 512MB machine by 5 or 6 minutes. </s>

<s> applications you're running and how you're running them. </s>
<s> If you run one program at a time or programs that don't need much RAM...more RAM doesn't make a noticeable difference. </s>
<s> Had you started with 256MBs RAM...you would have seen a greater difference. </s>
<s> If you upgrade or switch to Vista....2GB RAM becomes the new user standard. </s>
<s> If you go to tomshardware.com, you should be able to find an article saying essentially the same. </s>
<s> I'm sure there other similar articles or reviews. </s>
<s> Hope this clarifies. </s>
