<s> I have an ATI Radeon XPRESS 200 embedded in the motherboard of my eMachine T6424. </s>
<s> The picture that I see is distorted and I cannot remove the graphics card. </s>
<s> I have tried this with numerous monitors and have even reinstalled the video drivers that came with the machine, yet none of this seems to fix the problem. </s>
<s> I am considering purchasing a new graphics card, but hope that I will not need to resort to this. </s>
<s> I would greatly appreaciate if someone knows how to fix this without purchasing a new graphics card. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Assume that you have tried resetting display settings, resolution, etc? </s>
