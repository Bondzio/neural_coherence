11353	2	95334	1080122	1079784	John Robie	3/29/05 12:32 AM	1.11205632E12	Re: emachines T6212	The emachine T6212 seems to be a brand new machine that Circuit City and CompUSA have recently put on their site for sale. Checking the emachine home page and their support department they don't have anything listed yet for the T6212. Checking retailers (including BestBuy) that emachine suggests, don't have the T6212 except for the two above. The T6212 is indeed an AMD 64 3200+ with the ATI Radeon XPress 200 integrated on board graphics, but has a PCI-Express x16 slot for upgrading to a graphics card. Looks to me that this one with the PCI-Express x16 capability will slowly be replacing other AMD PC's which have Emachine AGP capabilities. Their Pentium models with Intel should also be coming out soon with PCI-Express.

11353	5	95334	1096816	1096369	twesterh	4/3/05 7:41 PM	1.11255726E12	Does have 939 socket, so I've heard...	I read a review someone posted on Circuit City's website that it does indeed have the 939 socket, tell me how find out for sure and I will because I bought the thing today! Question, though, what kind of ram can I put in this? Will one module of Kinston 512mb, 400mhz/PC3200 work? (Do I have to install memory upgrades in pairs or is that just for the first pair?I've looked at PNY, Kingston, and Crucial's web sites but it wasn't listed, because it's so new I guess? Also, what video card would you upgrade to (in the $200 range)? Will the Nvidia 6600GT work or could there be a conflict with the ATI IGP? I posted the memory question on another post before I saw this one... Lastly, what soundcard? I want something cheap that will still work with my old Altec Lansing surround sound speaker system... Thanks

If you're lucky, shouldn't cause problems, have compusa or someone else install it for you, if you think you're going to run into trouble. I would get a sound blaster audigy 2 zs, it runs great. Go to newegg to get it for $89. You can check the socket by downloading cpu-z, tell me about the results. Roger

About the sound card, is there anything else a little cheaper? Or will going cheaper be a mistake? Do you have any idea if I can install one 512mb module or do I have to install 2 at a time? Thanks

Here is what will work, according to Kinston phone rep: Kingston KVR400X64C3AK2/512 512MB This is a 2-256mb piece &quot;kit&quot;. Ordered from zipzoomfly.com for about $60. In case anyone else has this computer and wants to upgrade the RAM.

What PCI-Express x-16 video card will you be using, the GeForce 6600GT PCI-e? That is what I'll be using before long in an AGP version for one of my computers. Let us know how it all works out. JR
11353	14	95334	1098948	1098346	d__	4/4/05 4:09 PM	1.11263094E12	Watch out!	Watch out! I've seen performance figure for that ATI integrated chip. Doom 3 runs at less than 5 fps assuming driver settings are set at low.
11353	15	95334	1099122	1098948	John Robie	4/4/05 5:17 PM	1.11263502E12	Gonna check y'all who have it...eh?	Probably, I don't know, but for gaming, disable the on board ATI integrated video and putting in a PCI-E GeForce 6600GT card, should make it scream.
11353	16	95334	1099267	1098948	twesterh	4/4/05 6:11 PM	1.11263826E12	Tried to run Call of Duty	At maxed settings... it ran, but not well... I definitely will be getting a new card, whether I'll shell the money for 6600GT, I haven't yet decided, but I probably will. And I need a new sound card. I don't have Doom 3 and probably won't get it, but from what I've heard, it probaby wouldn't work at all!
11353	17	95334	1099271	1098346	twesterh	4/4/05 6:12 PM	1.11263832E12	Probably the 6600gt	I haven't yet made up my mind but I'll probably end up getting it. Should I go for a certain brand or just whoever has the best price?

Err....Damasta, AMD does not have a FSB (Front Side Bus) for the Athlon 64 processor, but replaced it with what is called HyperTransport link and operates at a frequency of 1600 MHZ for socket 754, and 2000 for socket 939. AMD does have a Front Side Bus (FSB) for their Athlon XP series: 2800 = 333MHz 3000 = 400MHz 3200 = 400MHz

And the t6212 probably wasn't even out when you got your computer, right? You can only wait so long and something better will always come around...
