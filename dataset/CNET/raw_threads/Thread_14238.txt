They are pretty reliable but one drop or oops delete and your last copy is gone. I see many under 99 buck externals on amazon,. newegg and at the stores so it's easy to get one and backup what you have today. Bob

I have a site online where I keep my photos and I have them on my desktop hard drive as well. But my desktop is getting very old and I seldom use it, except to store pics/music.

Folk that drive their copies down to ONE LAST COPY on any single device tend to lose them all. If you have an old machine and use this for a backup copy, that's a good idea. But it's only the first line of defense. Here I have our family photo collection on no less than 3 devices. Bob

I've never had any problems losing music or photos...of course I realize that doesn't mean it could happen. I'm just afraid my desktop will give up some day.

If you copy them there as &quot;backup&quot; then if your PC fails, you have a copy to bring back to your new system. Bob
