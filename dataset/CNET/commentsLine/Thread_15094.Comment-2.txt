find your favorite cad and rendering software and see what it minimum and recommended system requirements are.
if you go (somewhat) above the recommended requirements you should be ok. the higher you go, the faster it will be, of course, but there certainly is an area of diminishing returns (or: a smaller outcome of value/money).
things that probably matter: - cpu speed and number of cores - 32 or 64 bit os - graphic card - amount of ram - windows or apple or linux kees
