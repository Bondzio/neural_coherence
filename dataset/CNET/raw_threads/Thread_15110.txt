I have an elderly lady friend who needs a home phone, email, occasional web surfing and streaming video (TV) - all-in-one portable device. Can a tablet do all that? Or do you have to add something like a VoIP adapter/phone?

I know the next size down has the phone, but this one is one I haven't checked out in deep detail. It does do Skype so would you consider that a phone call? Bob
13583	4	562256	5306451	5306433	pemisan	5/2/12 10:20 AM	1.335954E12	I meant the ATT website	I know Skype would work, but was looking for actual cellphone functionality using built-in speaker/mic and Bluetooth headsets. The ATT site only gives basic details.

But I have seen folk make &quot;calls&quot; on the Samsung Galaxy Tab with the cell phone in it. But you may want more assurance than that so your best insight would be to go to the store that has this model and get a demo. Bob

Models for Europe are fully functional, though... And if you unlock your tablet I am sure there are ways to make it work - there are articles about it on the net....

Months ago at some meeting (I am in some work that involves cellular) I saw this make a call over the cell phone so I used that for my answer. Thanks for the correction. As this is an old discussion, it's now closed. Bob
