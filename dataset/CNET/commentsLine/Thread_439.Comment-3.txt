you said you are running in raid 0. this means the two drives are joined as one continuous drive and would only have one drive letter.
as such, they cannot operate independently.
is it possible you meant they were on raid capable channels on the mb but configured as basic sata?
in this case, you normally can just connect them to an sata channel of another pc and see if it's recognized and readable.
don't try to boot from a bootable partition, however if your os is xp.
it won't work.
