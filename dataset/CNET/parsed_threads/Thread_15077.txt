<s> I'm looking to buy a basic desktop PC which I would use to do email; surf the web; some word processing as well as some Quicken. </s>

<s> Something on the order of a Sempron 64 3200+. </s>
<s> In my opinion, again, Intel systems just don't cut it, AMD systems work faster. </s>
<s> I have had both and am using a self built and a Compaq pre-built, both with AMD's running things. </s>
<s> As for retailers, Walmart in my area usually has low prices, but NO in-storegeeks to help you. </s>
<s> Check Best Buy and Circuit City or Frye's if you are near one. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> Pick a national store. </s>
<s> They all usually have in-store service. </s>
<s> Very good suggestions. </s>
<s> He may also want to check out Dell. </s>
<s> So-called computer purists nay argue against them, but you can't beat them for the money. </s>
<s> Deffinitely worth looking into for a basic PC that will be used for light home use, won't break the bank, and is backed by _great_ tech support. </s>
<s> Due to this great tech support, Dell has learned where they went wrong with their older computers and made them a hell of a lot more reliable. </s>
<s> Just my two cents. </s>
