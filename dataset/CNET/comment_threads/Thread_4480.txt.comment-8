Do not overlook the power supply.
Inside your case, on the power supply, you should see a label with several, perhaps confusing, numerical values.
You want to find the value that represents the Total Watt Output - or something like that.
If it is below 300W, I would consider replacing the power supply as well.
The good news is that your case is probably standard ATX.
You should be able to install a good 500W + power supply without problems - if you need to.
