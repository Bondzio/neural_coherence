<s> Hello, I've been looking at a Western Digital - My Passport Essential 500GB External USB 3.0/2.0 Portable Hard Drive. </s>
<s> What is the speed of this drive (5,400 or 7,400 RPM) and does it make a big difference? </s>
<s> I have looked everywhere for this spec. </s>
<s> My primary purpose is save my finished audio and video projects to an external drive. </s>
<s> Would this be a well recommended drive, since I would like to have two, to be on the safer side? </s>
<s> Thanks, Eric </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Will it make a difference? </s>
<s> I would say yes but I don't think it's that much faster that you could notice. </s>
<s> Your computer already have usb3 support? </s>
<s> Although it is backward compatible to usb2. </s>
