Basically I start university on the 16th of September and will be moving away from home for the first time. After much consideration, and due to my limited budget I have decided to try and build a new desktop PC, rather than buying a cheap laptop. My budget is around &#65443;500 for the system and monitor, and due to limited desk space I will definitely need an LCD screen (19&quot; maybe?): Primary Uses: - Listening to music, I am planning to purchase a set of 2.1 speakers and to use my PC as my main audio device instead of taking a hifi system down to university. - The usual sort of office stuff, word, excel, running together with IRC, MSN maybe and also the music playing together with any other background things (Makes me wonder if I need a dual core?). Secondary Uses: - I will likely watch movies regularly, in order to make use of the unlimited download bandwidth in campus in the first year. - I will probably play on a few games, but I'm not a big gamer and if I do play games they tend to be strategy games and the like, rather than first person shooters and stuff, so frame rate isn't a huge problem for me, but a nice looking screen would be good. As I will go very soon, this leaves me just a few days to decide upon what parts I want for my PC so that I can order them and get the system put together before I head off to university. Therefore I would really, really appreciate any support and advice any of you can offer on this subject... as to be honest I just don't know what combination, within my price range will give me the best performance for the above stuff? Thanks in advance to anybody who is willing to give me a helping hand! Kindest Regards John

I can give you advice, and give a rough list of parts, but I have no idea what UK prices are like, as I live in the US.

So my advice is just make sure you price match some pre-built systems against what you are going to build, you may be suprised.
