1.1.1	- Maxtor 80 gig 3100 PS - have had for about 8months - used about 70 gig of space - it stopped allowing me to access the data - the drive registered that the space was used , and some files were visible , but most folders showed as empty .	St
1.1.2	- I have just set-up a 300gig Maxtor OneTouch II , and managed to move almost all of my data off of the 3100 PS .	St
1.1.3	- The last folder to copy is the biggest and consists of MP3s and AIFF files .	St
1.1.4	I am still having trouble moving or even getting the drive to recognize the contents of this folder .	St
1.1.5	- When I woke up this morning the drive was making a loud noise and the orange read light is solid .	St
1.1.6	- I can no longer get the drive to mount .	St
1.1.7	- When I unplug the power for 10 secs and the USB cable for 10 secs , then replug in same sequence , there is a beeping noise that happens about 3x , then the read light goes solid , the humming noise begins , and I can not get the drive to mount .	St
