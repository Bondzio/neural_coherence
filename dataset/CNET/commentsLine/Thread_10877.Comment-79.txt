here was something i found out about ssds by going to the seagate website and doing some reading (i suggest others do this): seagate has been a maker of disks and other storage devices for a long time.
they do make ssds and sshds (hybrid drives).
what they are saying is that the nand technology used in ssds is inheritly unreliable.
however, the controller is responsible for negating this unreliablity so the overal drive is reliable.
they also confirm the limits on the number of write cycles.
what they go on to say is, that there are two types of ssds: single-bit and multiple-bit with the single-bit having one bit of information per memory location and the multi-bit having two or three bits per location.
i won't bore anyone here with all of the reasons to go with one or the other but it is in the reading (part of the issue is cost).
so i would suggest to anyone thinking about or interested in learning about ssds that seagate is a good place to start looking for information on the technology.
my suggestion would be to buy the latest model ssd that you can and keep up with the latest firmware.
if you do buy a used, older model, at least update to the latest firmware for the drive.
just my opinion.
