<s> Hi My computer is 3 years old and I am thinking of getting a new one but I am considering two options. </s>
<s> I have some idea about what goes on inside the case and am pretty sure that I could break the comp down and build it back up. </s>
<s> I have removed and reinseted my modem, my video card, my burner and I have installed a new hard drive and have dual booted my system (not anymore though, cause I have a new scanner and don't need Win ME for my scanner). </s>
<s> I want to use back some parts from my old machine: 1. modem 2. hard drives (I have two of them) 3. </s>
<s> I have a 32MX Nivda card, and I think that its good for me. </s>
<s> I think thats about it I want to get some new parts 1. </s>
<s> Upgrade from a 1.3 GHz to something faster (not sure what speed is best) 2. </s>
<s> I have 2 x 64MB RD-RAM. </s>
<s> Need new RAM not sure what brand? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> DVD/CD-Burner So I think that its time for a new comp and was wondering which method is cheaper and why I should choose to buy or build my system. </s>
<s> This question is full of more questions. </s>
<s> The goals of building it yourself must be revealed as well as if you are your own best support. </s>
<s> Keeping in mind what you wrote and that you may get to reinstall the OS since Microsoft doesn't handle motherboard changes well, you could look at some motherboard+CPU+HSF+PowerSupply+RAM to move up to what you feel you want. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that all the old parts will run at the same old speed. </s>
<s> There is no &quot;best&quot; in the CPU brand, so you choose AMD or Intel and move on. </s>
<s> For me, it's AMD's 64-bit or some Intel CPU since I've tired of dealing with the Athlon (non-64-bit) heat issues. </s>
<s> As to RAM, no current boards take RDRAM, so you'll get new sticks to match. </s>
<s> And DVD-/+RW drives are plentiful. </s>
<s> Just make sure you get bundled recording software. </s>
<s> Bob Bob </s>
<s> IMO. </s>
<s> If you build it then you are the support. </s>
<s> Can you handle that? </s>
<s> If someone else builds it and it does not work then it is their headache. </s>
<s> As for cost, it is tough to beat some of the pkg deals. </s>
<s> Stan: I am not an expert by any means, but I have built a computer. </s>
<s> I did it just to see if I could. </s>
<s> It was a great experience and I learned a lot from it. </s>
<s> If you think you are going to save money by building, forget it. </s>
<s> You can buy Dell, eMachines, etc. </s>
<s> a lot cheaper. </s>
<s> If you like tinkering, build your own. </s>
<s> There are dozens of sites on the web that have advice on building. </s>
<s> Do some research, read some forums, then decide. </s>
<s> You will need a Case, a good Power supply, a Motherboard, CPU w/heatsink and fan, new RAM, and a Phillips head screwdrive. </s>
<s> BTW, the RD Ram is probably out, but save it. </s>
<s> Older Gateway users may have use for it. </s>
<s> If you have all the Program CD's from your present computer, and they are not proprietory, you can install them on the new rig and save some money. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you will have to buy new software. </s>
<s> I don't mean to discourage you from building, but as an example, my home built cost me around $900 US. </s>
<s> and it's just a 1.83Ghz. </s>
<s> I could have bought a Dell for $400 US and maybe got a new Printer thrown in. </s>
<s> But then I would not have had the fun of building. </s>
<s> Good luck Hal </s>
<s> I am going to buy a cheap customized dell without a modem, soundcard, (i'll get a better video cad) and without an Operating system or hard drive. </s>
<s> I have all the software I'll ever need so thats why I didn't want to get a brand new comp. </s>
<s> My main motivation was saving money. </s>
<s> I get all my support from this forum and from the net so I don't really care much about getting support from dell. </s>
<s> So does my plan sound like it make sense. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Stan the man, I'm actually at the same cross roads. </s>
<s> My machine is old and very slow compared to todays standards but it treats me good. </s>
<s> I update and upgrade some components but somtimes feel as though i'm spinning my wheels. </s>
<s> Think of the Future whats gonna come out next? </s>
<s> Your gonna want to build an expandable computer. </s>
<s> 1). </s>
<s> Get a quality case w/500watt power supply 2). </s>
<s> Asus P4C800 motherboard or the comparable intel board both have the i875P chipset. </s>
<s> 3).CPU whatever you prefer this board can handle over 3ghz. </s>
<s> I'd stay w/ hyperthreading Technology. </s>
<s> 4). </s>
<s> Quality hard drive (seagate, western digital) 7200 rpm, capacity is your preference. </s>
<s> I've priced out a dream system for close to $1000 but you can build a very good system thats fully expandable from $600-$800. </s>
<s> The best part about doing it yourself is its your creation. </s>
<s> Asus provides good support if you have problems but these forums are the best way to solve issues you may encounter. </s>
<s> Do your homework and enjoy. </s>
<s> Thanks alot but that sounds like too much trouble when I can buy a cheap dell and move the good parts from my old comp into the new one. </s>
<s> Well Stan, I didn't know you could get a Dell without a OS, and Hard Drive. </s>
<s> You can get a Dell with integrated sound and video, but I would suggest a Dell MB with a sound card and a Video Card more capable than the MX you have. </s>
<s> Dell selling without sound & video? </s>
<s> Please let us know how you are ordering this Dell sans a OS, HD, Sound & Video. </s>
<s> It would depend on how much you have to pay for this Dell. </s>
<s> What about Shipping Charges? </s>
<s> I was not aware that what you are trying to buy is available. </s>
<s> I would also check with a local dealer and compare prices. </s>
<s> Either way, good luck Hal </s>
<s> just curious, just how easy will it be to put non-dell stuff into a dell? </s>
<s> I have no direct experience with them but when I help friends who own dells and gateways it always seems like the companies tell me &quot;you can't add that component to the system unless you buy one of ours.&quot; you're married to them and their bios downloads and whatnot . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> any real mucking about (like overclocking) can void the warranty real fast and you're back here talking to us ! </s>
<s> (not that there's anything wrong with that) in my experience, my home built computers are more expensive to start but they are a lot more expandable (at least in the near run, before the whole system becomes obsolete) in terms of adding cards and drives and so on . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> and what can I say, I love messing around with this stuff. </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> First of all, you shouldn't do ANYTHING if you aren't prepared to solve unexpected problems. </s>
<s> So, the answer to your question is &quot;maybe&quot;. </s>
<s> It depends on some other factors. </s>
<s> Like, are you A+ certified? </s>
<s> If not, why? </s>
<s> Do you not have the knowledge to pass the cert test? </s>
<s> You shouldn't even be attempting it if any of these answers are &quot;no&quot;. </s>
<s> The reason being you may do something wrong and ruin the brand new components you've purchased. </s>
<s> Or you may mess things up to the point that you have to pay a tech to fix it anyway. </s>
<s> I would say, if you have the knowledge, prove it. </s>
<s> Get certified. </s>
<s> Then build a system. </s>
<s> At a Microsoft TechNet meeting I attended a few months ago, the Microsoft rep giving the lecture was giving some acronyms they had made up. </s>
<s> One of them is a &quot;STITE&quot;, meaning a &quot;Self Taught IT Expert&quot;. </s>
<s> By reading some of the advise given in these forums, I would venture to say that probably around 60% of those giving advise are indeed &quot;STITES&quot;. </s>
<s> They have little knowledge of what they are saying, and following their advise would be foolish. </s>
<s> Per my A+ book (yes, I have my cert, as well as N+, Windows 2000 Professional, and Windows 2000 Advanced Server certs along with a college degree in Computer Science), the main point to consider when you build your own is this; YOU ARE the technical support. </s>
<s> You can't call Compaq or whoever when you have a problem. </s>
<s> That is why you MUST know EXACTLY what you are doing. </s>
<s> Otherwise you will end up paying someone like me to fix it. </s>
<s> The biggest advantage to building your own is you get to chose what you want in your computer. </s>
<s> You can get a motherboard where the NIC, video, sound, and other components aren't integrated into the motherboard. </s>
<s> Also, you buy the components at a computer supplier or wherever, so when it goes out, you can go to the same store and buy another one. </s>
<s> Compare that to Compaq, Dell, HP, and others that are using integrated parts as well as proprietary parts. </s>
<s> There computers are cheaper to buy, but there is a reason. </s>
<s> Say the power supply goes out after a few years. </s>
<s> Dell likes to use a proprietary power supply that has a unique shape. </s>
<s> That way when it goes, you have to call Dell and buy a new one at whatever price they want to charge you (usually two to three times more than a generic power supply). </s>
<s> Many of the manufacturers are putting out systems that don't allow you to disable the onboard sound, video, or whatever. </s>
<s> That way, when the part goes, you must order a new motherboard (they are hoping from them). </s>
<s> That is why they are so cheap. </s>
<s> Anyway, the answer to your question is &quot;how much do you know?&quot; </s>
<s> Hey stan. </s>
<s> I personally have built my own computer and bought from a major OEM. </s>
<s> I actually found that building your own computer was quite a bit cheaper and not to say the least...fun. </s>
<s> You have the ability to buy parts at the cheapest prices from verified resellers such as newegg.com and zipzoomfly.com. </s>
<s> If you dont decide to purchase parts online, you can shop in your local store and look for sales. </s>
<s> Besides, it's a great feeling to put all your components together and have your system work lol. </s>
<s> One thing to watch out for is bad parts. </s>
<s> If you buy online, then you have to go through the whole process of sending the parts back, and they will often charge you a small fee. </s>
<s> If you buy from stores such as Fry's Electronics, Best Buy, CompUSA, etc. </s>
<s> then the process is simplified quite a bit. </s>
<s> You have stated that your computer is 3 years old. </s>
<s> What are the current specifications of your computer? </s>
<s> For example, the cpu that you would like rated at 1.3 Ghz may not be compatible with your current motherboard etc. </s>
<s> In addition, you have to make the choices between major brands such as Intel and AMD. </s>
<s> Weigh your choices and choose. </s>
<s> You currently dont know what RAM to get. </s>
<s> There are different types of ram such as RDRAM, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM etc. </s>
<s> These days, DDR RAM is pretty cheap as well as SDRAM. </s>
<s> You have to know what your motherboard supports before you go off and buy new RAM. </s>
<s> I suggest that either 256 or 512 MB of RAM would be enough for your everyday applications. </s>
<s> What do you plan to use your computer for? </s>
<s> If for example, you just need it to do the basics of word processing and spreadsheets then you wont need top of the line components. </s>
<s> If you game or run graphic intensive programs, think about buying higher end components and more memory. </s>
<s> When you buy an optical Drive such as a DVD/DVD Burner/CD Burner, then the minimum speficiations are generally located on the box. </s>
<s> I personally think that you should drop Windows ME as it has shown a great deal of instability, however, some people like that OS. </s>
<s> I hope I have helped you stan. </s>
<s> If not, turn to the other users of this board. </s>
<s> It sounds like a good idea, just watch out for some differences. </s>
<s> For example, my DELL Hard Drive had an IDE cable with some of the wires switched. </s>
<s> This ensures that any new hard drive you put on wont work. </s>
<s> At least I think so. </s>
<s> I'm not an expert. </s>
<s> I agree with what was said here. </s>
<s> I looked at many packages, none seemed to have quite what I wanted, building my own(with some help from a tech friend) taught me a fair bit and I am now a lot more confident about future re-builds. </s>
<s> It did'nt really save me money, I shopped around a lot on the net and at computer fairs, but I enjoyed it and do now understand more about what goes on inside a computer. </s>
<s> Stan, Dell will not sell a computer without an operating system. </s>
<s> So, you have no choice other than building your own if you want try using your own software. </s>
<s> If you are using Windows XP, you will not be able to activate it over the internet. </s>
<s> You will have to call in and take your chances. </s>
<s> I have found that Dell is extremely competitive with low end machines, but if you are building a higher end machine, you can save money by building your own. </s>
<s> That's where they make their profits. </s>
<s> There are some mail order sites where you can buy hardware at virtually wholesale prices. </s>
<s> But watch out for excessive shipping and special charges. </s>
<s> Buy a new hard drive. </s>
<s> THey are cheap. </s>
<s> Your modem is about the only thing I would save. </s>
<s> Maybe your case and power supply are salvagable. </s>
<s> I assume you have an ATX Powersupply with the extra power connectors for either Intel or AMD CPU's? </s>
<s> If not, get a decent powersupply. </s>
<s> Don't fall for those 450 watt PS for $9.99 ads! </s>
<s> As far as AMD vs Intel goes, I prefer Intel. </s>
<s> I personally only use Intel motherboards and Intel CPUs. </s>
<s> However, standing up for one or the other is somewhat like attacking a religion. </s>
<s> People support their favorites with religous fervor! </s>
<s> I believe you can build a good system for a fair price and have a lot of fun doing it. </s>
<s> There is one bit of technical advice I want to give you: The order of software installation is - 1) load the OS, 2) load the motherboard drivers (THe disk that comes with the motherboard) and finally, install any other required drivers such as the video card drivers. </s>
<s> If you use an Nvidia based video card, get the latest driver from their site. </s>
<s> They offer a unified driver that suports their entire family of graphics products. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> I have just had a new computer built. </s>
<s> Used the following components: Plextor 708A CD/DVD burner Pentium 4 2.8E GHz &quot;Prescott&quot; 1MB KingMax 512MB PC-3200 DDR400 SDRAM ASUS P4P800-E-DLX Intel 865PE, 800MHz FSB, Dual DDR400 Very pleased with the machine. </s>
<s> Well, Stan, I'd like to say, in defense of all us STITE's out here, that the proof is ALWAYS in the pudding. </s>
<s> While certs look really nice on your wall and your resume, they won't do you a lot of good if you don't need them to get your job done. </s>
<s> In addition, many of the certs are easily bought today, so having one doesn't necessarily reflect what you know. </s>
<s> Lots of good old &quot;hands on&quot; experience, however, is, IMHO, the key to knowledge. </s>
<s> So please don't be discouraged by the first paragraph in ereedks post. </s>
<s> Instead, pay close attention to what he/she says in the second paragraph of the post. </s>
<s> The last sentence of the post is key, &quot;how much do you know?&quot; Be realistic about your knowledge limitations, ask as many knowledgeable people as you can, verify answers to your questions with others, and, most importantly, learn as much as you can about the components you plan to use (starting with the motherboard) BEFORE you buy. </s>
<s> In my experience, building your own is definitely NOT cheaper than buying a pre-built system, but, as has been said many times here, you can avoid the problems associated with integrated and proprietary components as well as get exactly what you want in your system. </s>
<s> And, if you're careful and do well, you may just eventually gain enough knowledge to become a proud STITE yourself! </s>
<s> Much luck to you! </s>
<s> You won't save much money by building your own, reason being builders like Dell get their parts in huge quantities much cheaper than you will be able to buy them. </s>
<s> Building your own is fun and you get exactly what you want. </s>
<s> Keep in mind, the most expensive parts of any computer are the processor and the RAM. </s>
<s> Suggest for your first build, you buy a so-called &quot;bare bones&quot; system from any number of online suppliers. </s>
<s> They get the same big discounts as Dell so you are not disadvantaged going this route. </s>
<s> You'll get the case/powersupply/fans/motherboard/processor/heatsink, all compatible and all assembled and tested. </s>
<s> Your old RAM won't work so you should probably buy your RAM from the barebones supplier. </s>
<s> Do the research and compare bare bones packages terms of cost and processor speed, get the best motherboard money can buy (they're cheap)and then add video/audio/modems etc. </s>
<s> depending on which on board features you have on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Add drives of your choice and you're done. </s>
<s> For an operating system, suggest buy and OEM version of Windows XP for about $100. </s>
<s> Ok Stan Before I disperse my STITE knowledge, I feel that you should know I am one of those people that think experience leads to understanding what you're talking about. </s>
<s> But a good degree is obviously better looking in an interview. </s>
<s> So then; I have built all the computers I have ever owned from bits and pieces of other computers. </s>
<s> They have all turned out to be good machines for the time I had them. </s>
<s> (approx. </s>
<s> 5 machines) I chose what parts to use. </s>
<s> Whether or not I needed to change a part; and that was all pretty simple. </s>
<s> Building a PC is alot easier than most people think. </s>
<s> It's kinda like a labeled jigsaw puzzle. </s>
<s> (if you have a motherboard diagram) BUT, if there was ever a problem, I had to figure it out my self. </s>
<s> I was always taking care of the computers. </s>
<s> They never seemed to work how I wanted, when I wanted. </s>
<s> It was a major hassle. </s>
<s> Then, for graduation, my dad bought me a Gateway PC. </s>
<s> I got to choose certain parts over other brand names, but that's about all the customizing I could do. </s>
<s> When it finally came in, all that was required of me was to plug everything in and turn it on. </s>
<s> This was very nice. </s>
<s> Now my computer was virtually free of the problems I had before...untill I installed my programs. </s>
<s> Then I had some of the same problems, and some new. </s>
<s> I had a file manager stuck on my desktop for a while, and I figured that my Tech Support I paid for would help me out. </s>
<s> I was WRONG. </s>
<s> Help Desks, Tech Support, they all pretty much stink. </s>
<s> Granted they are getting better, but they could not solve my problems. </s>
<s> For the prices I paid to get that 3-year warranty, have my PC shipped, and the PC itself (not to mention the customization I did later on) I could have built my own PC, FULLY customized to my liking, and ended up with the same problems. </s>
<s> Building your own PC can be cheep. </s>
<s> Buying a PC from Dell, Gateway, HP, etc. </s>
<s> can be cheep. </s>
<s> It all depends not on how much you know, but do you understand what you will get either way. </s>
<s> Build your own: Get what you want; some online places it's cheep; no tech support; you know what's there; may have limited warranty on individual parts(varies); if there's a problem, you fix it Buy from &quot;Big Company&quot;: may get what you want; can be much cheeper than building yourself; some tech support; warranty on all parts; you may not be able to upgrade from other than &quot;Big Company&quot;; some problems tech support can't fix better than you can. </s>
<s> I recomend building it yourself IF you have the knowledge to fix the problems that will arise or have a buddy that does. </s>
<s> It is fun, and a great experience as we move into the &quot;computers run the world&quot; era. </s>
<s> But if you are just some average joe that goes to work everyday, and plays with his kids, has BBQ parties and likes relaxing while fishing-and you think it would be interesting to build a PC because it would, then find a friend who will let you help build his. </s>
<s> You'll get the same experience, but won't have to deal with the problems. </s>
<s> From my own experience, for low-end to mid-range PC's, the better value are prebuilts. </s>
<s> But for bleeding-edge gamer/graphics systems, I can build systems with top-of-the-line components(thanks NewEgg) hundreds cheaper than what Alienware or Falcon Northwest can put out. </s>
<s> But irrespective of what kind of system you buy or build, I would encourage you to strive to be the best STITE you can be. </s>
<s> As lvfinch noted, &quot;hands on&quot; experience is the key. </s>
<s> Don't be turned-off from building your own system just because you lack the &quot;papers&quot;. </s>
<s> As a self-confessed STITE since the Intel 8088 days (padded with a Computer Science & Engineering degree, and well over a decade of IT work experience), you don't need certification to build your own computer. </s>
<s> I've built a fair amount of systems for myself and others, and along the way I've &quot;burnt&quot; some components. </s>
<s> But you learn and get better. </s>
<s> What with the Internet, peruse the many Modz and Overclocker sites to garner knowledge and understanding. </s>
<s> I'll bet most Modders and OC's don't have and don't need certification. </s>
<s> But do purchase one of those &quot;Build your own System&quot; books to fill-in the holes. </s>
<s> Also, do your research before buying any component. </s>
<s> As there are so many variants out there, compatibility is a big issue. </s>
<s> Lastly, seriously consider upgrade-ability. </s>
<s> What with the upcoming PCI-X format, many of todays components will be obsolete in regards to performance. </s>
<s> Once these new boards are out, my next system will be an AMD 64 running Linux-64. </s>
<s> I have built many computers and consistantly find that if I need all the parts (and software) it is a lot cheaper to buy a fully assembled computer. </s>
<s> If you want to reuse the parts you listed you can build your own computer and save some money although a bare bones computer with Memory, MB and Cpu will probably be cheaper then buying the parts seperately. </s>
<s> You can easily check this out on line with some of the larger online retailers. </s>
<s> Think first about your budget and what you want your new pc to do. </s>
<s> Buying a new pc will be easier and more cost effective in the short run, especially if you don't do much besides word processing, internet and older games, but you may still have a machine that's behind the times. </s>
<s> If you want to have a pc that's mostly state-of-the-art (except for what you're migrating in) build it. </s>
<s> It is not tremendously difficult and is quite a lot of fun. </s>
<s> I've built my own pc that I use daily for video editing as well as pc's for others from pieces I've cannibalized from other pc's. </s>
<s> You probably won't save a lot of money but you will know each and every piece of equipment, which is a lot more than you can say for an off the shelf pc. </s>
<s> There are lots of resources, both on the web and in print, on building. </s>
<s> PCWorld has articles on building (that will be $49.95 please) and also check extremetech.com, as they have many project pc's with cost estimates and build lists. </s>
<s> Dear E. Reed from Kansas (ereedks), With your A+ book and college degree you seem to be suffering from grandiosity. </s>
<s> It might be just the thing Stan doesn't need to give him the confidence to build his computer. </s>
<s> I've built three and haven't broken anything yet. </s>
<s> If I do, I'm not afraid to pay you to fix it! </s>
<s> It's kind of a hobby for some of us. </s>
<s> And yes, I had a college degree long before you were born. </s>
<s> I'll be 70 in December. </s>
<s> Here is a some advice other posters may not have touched upon. </s>
<s> Before you start your quest, backup your harddrive. </s>
<s> Make sure you have a static map to work on in a clear area and use a static clip. </s>
<s> Take your time inserting cards, memory modules and processors. </s>
<s> One of the most difficult issues one might face is the installation of a processor fan. </s>
<s> They can be tricky, be very patient here. </s>
<s> Don't put all of your boards into the motherboard right at the start. </s>
<s> Just put in the video card, the memory and the processor and test this. </s>
<s> This will save time having to remove parts toisolate problems if any should arise on the first post. </s>
<s> If you get no video on the first post, listen for the beeps and consult your motherboard manual. </s>
<s> I'd usually advise first try clearing CMOS before removing memory, video card, and/or processor. </s>
<s> The one disadvantage you have is you probably don't have extra memory, processors or video cards lying around. </s>
<s> In regards to your old cards, there is never a guarantee they will work. </s>
<s> Just like moving in the real world, you should consider if you really need a card. </s>
<s> Many new motherboards offer most of the amenities you'll need outside of decent video and sound. </s>
<s> Good Luck You don't need an A+ by all means nor more than you need a plumber to unclog a toilet. </s>
<s> . </s>

<s> Suggest you go to www.tomshardware.com for research. </s>
<s> Hi Stan, I'm a PC duffer, little technical knowledge but a bit of experience. </s>
<s> A friend built me a PC 3+ years ago & I wanted to upgrade. </s>
<s> First decision was the processor - what could I afford? </s>
<s> Once decided the processor mfrs. </s>
<s> website gave a list of compatible boards. </s>
<s> The board I decided upon narrowed the sound & video card choices & memory sticks. </s>
<s> I got them all from a real cheap shop here in Edinburgh. </s>
<s> Other components I reused. </s>
<s> OS inst. </s>
<s> went OK & I was in business. </s>
<s> I had a couple of knowledgeable friends on hand to help but they were not need. </s>
<s> I felt real pleased when XP came to life . </s>
<s> Have a go & feel smug like I did. </s>
<s> I'M building a computer upgrading from 1.1 amd to a p4 4gigs of memory 80 gig hard drive and new os either xp or windows 2000 havent decided yet caus ei cant see paying 1000 to 1600 for a new pc </s>
<s> Let's see. </s>
<s> I've built several dozen PC's and good gosh...with no Class A Cert. </s>
<s> I guess I should disassemble them all and tell my clients that I am not qualified to work on them. </s>
<s> This asside, putting a PC together isn't rocket science. </s>
<s> If a person can read directions, they can put one together. </s>
<s> Then you will know what is going in the unit and will save a bundle even over discount $500 or less deals. </s>
<s> Way back in 1989 when I built my first unit, I was surprised that it pretty much snapped together like a tinker toy. </s>
<s> In fact I could show a 10 year old how to build one. </s>
<s> Your upgrade will depend on what OS you're using. </s>
<s> Upgrading is quite easy. </s>
<s> Installing the processor is actually quite easy. </s>
<s> Installing the fan/heatsink assembly is the tricky part. </s>
<s> You'll need a thermal compound to put between the heatsink and the processor. </s>
<s> You have to make sure the motherboard supports the chosen processor. </s>
<s> As far as memory goes, motherboards may have from three to five slots for RAM. </s>
<s> Kingston makes good memory and offers the option to get heatsinks. </s>
<s> Make sure you have a good power supply, at least 300W. </s>
<s> I give each drive 50W. </s>
<s> (CD-R/RW, DVD, Hard Drive, etc.) </s>
<s> I also recommend getting more than one case fan, as well as a case with enough room to work. </s>
<s> Antec makes nice cases, but there are many out there. </s>
<s> Go to www.newegg.com to look at parts. </s>
<s> There are other sites, but I like the prices at newegg. </s>
<s> Getting back to the motherboard, it should come with a booklet with instructions to get you started. </s>
