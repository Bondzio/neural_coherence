i am having the exact same problem with the same router.
no matter what security setup i have played with, i haven't been able to make it stop disconnecting me.
this wasn't too big of an issue until i hooked up my new ps3.
it drops connection about every other match.
i have been debating just buying a new router even though i can't afford it.
i've been looking for a solution for about 6 months now and still havent found one.
i'm even up to date on the firmware.
