Yes, a good suggestion.
Here's the spec: A Packard Bell ixtreme 9200 i package containing: P3 1Ghz, 128MB SDRAM, 40GB UDMA HDD, Creative SB Live, GeForce 2 MX 32MB.
As far as I know all of these are the proginal compoenets and have hot been upgraded/changed etc.
The problem has only recently occurred, so I'm guessing that one of the components has had it.
Based on my very limited knowledge, I'm guessing perhaps the Motherboard, or possibly the power supply.
Just wondering if anyones encountered a simlar problem.
Thanks
