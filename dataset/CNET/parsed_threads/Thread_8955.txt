<s> I have a Dell Dimension 4700 and it no longer boots up Windows XP. </s>
<s> After doing some research I learned that Maxtor hard drives have a high failure rate. </s>
<s> I have a Maxtor. </s>
<s> Return code 7 is bad. </s>
<s> I got return code 7. </s>
<s> I have a friend who said she has a CD that may find the hard drive but I thought I'd throw the question out to see what kind of advice I can get. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Maxtor makes a lot of drives. </s>
<s> As to data recovery, it's done every day by drivesavers.com, ontrack.com and if the drive is spinning, sometimes at home. </s>
<s> In closing, all the drives will die in about 5 to 10 years. </s>
<s> What does that tell you? </s>

<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> That gives me some hope. </s>
<s> It tells me that it is a wise idea to frequently back up data. </s>
<s> I figured a Dell computer would last more than 1 1/2 years. </s>
<s> Could a newly installed program kill the drive? </s>
<s> I did install a program about a week before it stopped working. </s>
<s> Yes I've been given &quot;dead&quot; drives only to discover they are nothing but &quot;corrupt.&quot; The drive was actually good. </s>
<s> Rare but happens. </s>
<s> If the drive doesn't spin then we at least look at the solder work near the power pins. </s>
<s> Some owners were changing or removing the drive &quot;for security&quot; and the solder work gives out. </s>
