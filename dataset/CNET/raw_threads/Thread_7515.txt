Basically what I am scratching my head at is this. My router is telling me it is not connected and has a solid orange light, but my wired internet from the belkin router is working fine. Wireless works fine coming from the belkin router as well but tends to drop at least once a day on all my wireless devices (tablet, galaxy s2 phone, PS3 etc), usually only for a few seconds. I am just wondering what could possibly cause these problems, if they are connected and how to fix them.

After a month of putting it off I dove into it and tried the usual then turned to the web. I lucked out that others were having troubles and the maker's web site was only reporting there were reports of the issue. The other discussions found folk that found the prior firmware version to not have this issue so I rolled back one version and it's much better. I suggest you do the same research. Bob
