From Amazon's page selling this http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FreeAgent-External-Drive-ST901603FGA1E1-RK/dp/B000ND75CU When I first thought of buying an external hdd I was worried to buy one without external powersupply.
But this one is cool.
It works like magic.
5400 rpm hdd but it will take up two of your USB slots.
I think it uses two to gather power.
I guess the drive was faulty.
I didn't see a box or a mounted drive.
