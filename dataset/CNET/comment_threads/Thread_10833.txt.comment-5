Thanks for the link to Wikipedia for the explanation of twisted pair technology.
I have an unopened box for a D-Link DIR-655 WIRELESS Router that I was going to return for credit.
Would it make any sense to use this router for a WIRED network, since it probably has more updated technology, unlike the LinkSye BEFSR41 that is from the dark ages?
If I connect a switched hub to my BEFSR41 wired router, why will the PC to PC traffic move faster?
Forgive me for asking these educational questions, because it takes far too much of your time to answer them and direct me to helpful sites, but maybe someday I can help someone else with the same problem.
Thanks for the advice and help, Thomboy
