compaq presario sr1950nx Windows Xp 2.4Ghz processor 2G ram Vid Nvida 8400 Gs The other day I was installing a new game and recieved a processor error.
This was how I was notified of this issue.
My processor has recently stopped registering as 2.4g and is now registering as a 1002.2 Mhz.
I've been trying to find answers with little success.
I was hoping someone here would have an idea for me to try.
