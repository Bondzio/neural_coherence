well I was able to get to the BIOS and checked the temp of the CPU and well it was 240 F it did that when it first started up...so I know my comp is shutting down for safety reasons but how do I fix the heating problem...I have a really good CPU fan on there I have the right amount of Artic silver paste.
I cant ge to the BIOS to change any options.
My problem was that when I started my computer it would start (everything ran) then seconds afterwards it would shut off..so I know the problem so now I need ya'll to tell me the solution..I dont want to take it in to the shop b/c of the high costs and Im sure I can fix it so please help!
