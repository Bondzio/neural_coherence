Let's say you build a machine from a pile of parts.
The warranty is not on the machine but the parts.
So you are the point person and sole contact for figuring out which part or parts are in need of swapping out.
What's interesting is that decades have passed in the PC world yet no standard emerged for diagnosis.
That is, unless you consider the old swap parts routine a standard.
