i would do a survey of the wireless signals in your area.
i use inssider for this.
there are some good programs, just do a google search for wireless signal survey programs.
you want to make sure your router is on a channel that does not have a lot of other devices on it.
you also should check your wireless settings.
make sure you don't have your device set to autochannel.
this would make your channel change whenever it detects a problem with the channel it's on, possibly kicking off your devices.
