<s> Hi, I live in a 10 story apartment in Central Etobicoke. </s>
<s> I have a HP Pavillion a1542n PC 2.8GHz Duo, 2Gb Ram . </s>
<s> I bought an Airlink Awll6070 USB Wireless Adapter 3 days ago. </s>
<s> After installing the driver and native software I have detected around 3 consistent networks (available almost 24/7) on my location with a strong signal usually 3/5 and 50 Mbps. </s>
<s> Two of them are WEp encrypted and the other WPA. </s>
<s> I have installed Backtrack 3 on a 2GB Sandisk Cruzer USB Port. </s>
<s> Using airodump-ng, and aircrack-ng I have determined the WEP (128 bit) of one network after analyzing about 800,000 codes. </s>
<s> I have tried this three times to ensure i got the right key. </s>
<s> I tried connecting to the network using that key in ASCII format so 13 hexadecimal numbers. </s>
<s> I get IP autethification and can send packets, but I cant seem to receive any packets from the network. </s>
<s> I tried ping [IP] and it worked, but I still cant connect to the internet, any suggestions? </s>
<s> Check the forum policies. </s>
<s> No one will aid others in breaking into other people's internet connections. </s>
