i am not sure where i can find the verson of the drivers.
when i installed the graphics card and then used the CD to install the drivers it said that the drivers that were on the PC were newer than the ones on the CD so i said not to install it.
I guess Windows automatically downloaded the drives but what is weird is that i did not see anything saying it was installing it.
I guess the pc came with the drivers installed
