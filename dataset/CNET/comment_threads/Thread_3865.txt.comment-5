I just got a call back from Lexmark and they ran me through the fix.
Apparently, the lxdr_device service was disabled so I just had to go into services.msc to enable it to start automatically.
All told, a very simple fix, but it took a lot of wrangling to get it fixed.
Ah, well.
Life is good again now that I can print again!
From my other searching on the net regarding SP3 and lexmark printers, this is a common problem with SP3 disabling this service.
Thanks for your help and input.
