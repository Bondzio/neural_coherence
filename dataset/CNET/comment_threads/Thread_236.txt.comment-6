I bought myself a Samsung galaxy Tab2 at Xmas, and after a couple of days it started updating to JB.
It warned me I might &quot;lose&quot; some of the apps i'd installed,so I held my breath, but all was ok. Can't say I noticed any change after the upgrade(it told me it had updated successfully), but am still getting used to it anyway.
So far i'm loving it!
