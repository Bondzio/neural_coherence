All WiFi links are subject to interference and 802.11n has only 2 channels that don't overlap -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels so you can imagine that any neighbor has a 50/50 chance of messing up your connection speed.
Power line works well but be sure to talk to them about the limitation such as both outlets must be on the same side of the power system.
I'll stop here as I will duplicate the web.
