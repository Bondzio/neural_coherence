I get the full 54Mbps but no internet. Any ideas?

But beside that picture it said &quot;OR&quot; just plug the mobile router in, and you can get a wirless connection. I will try the DSL line today.

Meaning, Plug it in to the DSL line... NOT just any line. that WRT54GS can be use as a router only or as a wireless access point.. OR as a repeater.
