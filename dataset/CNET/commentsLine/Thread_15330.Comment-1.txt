i have an almost 10 year old pc that i've kept limping along, but finally seems to have bit the dust.
it simply won't turn on.
a power supply failure is the most obvious reason; however, i never heard any noises coming from it nor did i get a burning smell.
instead, over the past week on other occasions when it wouldn't power on, i simply unplugged the cord and plugged it back into a different outlet.
i did this successfully probably three different times.
so i'm wondering whether this sounds more like a power cord issue rather than the power supply.
yes, i could simply purchase a new cord and try it out, but thought i'd ask first since i've never heard of a power cord not working.
by the way, i don't expect to keep using the pc, but it would be nice to access a few things that had not been backed up.
