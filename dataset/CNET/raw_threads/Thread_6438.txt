I've pretty much specced my PC, but I'm currently looking into speakers (I don't like to use headphones). Anyone have any suggestions as to which I should purchase?

I use a Logitech system and am well pleased plus they don't cost you an arm and a leg. Their other peripherals are also excellent, keyboards and mice, joysticks etc. All of my peripherals on all systems are Logitech.
