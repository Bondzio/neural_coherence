1.1.1	I have an old Dlink DI-604 that I 'd like to configure to work as a switch .	St
1.1.2	I think this is possible but not sure how to do it .	St
1.1.3	Switches are cheap but if I could save a few bucks with some tweaking I 'd prefer that .	St
1.1.4	Plus I figure I 'd learn a bit about networking .	St
1.1.5	Dlinks site on the DI-604 : http : //www.dlink.com/products/ ? pid=62 My main problem is I have Uverse and I 'm out of wired ports on the Residential Gateway .	St
1.1.6	I would like 2 more ports to network my PC and NAS , so my laptop and Xbox can access their files .	St
1.2.1	I 'd configure it as WAP .	St
1.2.2	I see no reason to use any other method even if this has no wifi .	St
1.2.3	I 'd use the same instructions .	St
1.2.4	Google this - & gt ; How to configure a router as a WAP .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'll give it a go .	St
1.3.2	How about this tutorial , looks detailed enough but I have never done this before and do n't have a lot of networking experience .	St
1.3.3	http : //www.speedguide.net/articles/how-to-set-a-wireless-router-as-an-access-point-2556	St
1.4.1	I know it 's a little difficult but the idea is to play along with those instructions as if it 's a wifi router .	St
1.4.2	Just skip over any wifi areas and it should work .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I have to be honest , I do n't 100 % understand what I did and it took a bit but I got it working .	St
