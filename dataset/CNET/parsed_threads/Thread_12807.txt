<s> I know you cannot upgrade xp x32 to vista 64 while xp is installed. </s>
<s> But i know that vista upon a fresh install off of an upgrade disk will only ask you to insert a disk from a previous OS to prove you are &quot;upgrading&quot;. </s>
<s> Will that work if i am installing vista x64, and insert xp x32 for the proof of an upgrade. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> Well, it looks like they do not make an upgrade version of x64. </s>
<s> you just need to get the x64 dvd. </s>
<s> if you know someone with the x64 dvd, use their's but enter your vista license key. </s>
