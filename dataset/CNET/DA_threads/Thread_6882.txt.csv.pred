1.1.1	My sister got a used Apple 1705 monitor but no cable.	St
1.1.2	Upon checking, it does have a DB15 connection on the back.	St
1.1.3	The original cable(googled) says, it would work provided you use the &quot;adapter&quot; that came with it for PCs.	St
1.1.4	No cable and no adapter.	St
1.1.5	Now, investigating further suggests it will work with a DB15(male) to DB15(male) cable to a VGA card.	St
1.1.6	But, it seems there maybe a scanning issue.	St
1.1.7	If this is the case, will it work at all using a std.	St
1.1.8	VGA(PC) cable from monitor to video card.	St
1.1.9	No need getting a cable if it won't sync as googling provides, but others says it will work.	St
1.1.10	I want to believe a newer PC type video card will be able to sync but hate to waste $ for a new monitor cable.	St
1.1.11	I just wonder if anyone has gone through this?	St
1.1.12	Otherwise, it be recycled via the Goodwill.	St
1.1.13	Yeah, they do recycle, not resell.	St
1.1.14	TIA -----Willy	St
1.2.1	As you have noticed, the connector on the 1705 is not a standard VGA connector so the VGA to VGA idea will not work.	St
1.2.2	That connector is actually a DA-15 but is often referred to as DB-15.	St
1.2.3	The Apple monitor cable is wider than VGA and will need an adapter to bring it down in size.	St
1.2.4	There is an adapter, See it here that will work for you but you will need to buy an Apple monitor cable to connect the monitor to the cable.	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps P	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the help.	St
1.3.2	I already seen the adapter side of things.	St
1.3.3	Basically, they offer use with an Apple cable, since I have no cable its another expense.	St
1.3.4	The costs are getting to be heavy and thus won't go that route.	St
1.3.5	I can buy a working PC monitor for the costs of all the cable(s)/adapters, Again, thanks -----Willy	St
