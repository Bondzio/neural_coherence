the first 2 disks i burned, were not muli session so it would not allow an erase.. then 2nd disk was an iso.. so you can't even multi-session those.. once its burned it's burned.. i tried eraseing them anyway.. so now i hve 2 disks that report 0used space 0 free space.. and are now useless =/ currently searching for software that will allow multisession burns.. mostly for mp3s.. i want them to be on a dvd so i can take it with me, but i also want to be able to erase and re-record if errors are present.
