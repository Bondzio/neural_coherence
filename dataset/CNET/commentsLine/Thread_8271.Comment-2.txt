unless your drives on the new system and old systems were jumpered cable select then you must change the jumper when you move the drive.
if both the old and new were cs then that is fine, but there is no way to do this at the bios.
the fact your husband thought he could do it in the bios shows he doesn't have a clue about working inside a computer.
does the computer beep at all when you turn it on.
you must firmly seat the video card in the slot, was that done, sounds like it night not be all the way in.
you could try his video card in your system to see if that works.
putting your drive in another system may have been the biggest mistake, it is going to get nothing but errors unless it goes into a system that is exactly the same.
if you booted it up in a different system with different hardware it may be be real messed up now and need windows re-installed.
