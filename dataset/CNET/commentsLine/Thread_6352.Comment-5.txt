i shorted the green and black wires on the psu and it worked, but there's something i don't understand: should the psu be on as long as the two wires are touching, or should it continue to work after they have been separated?
when i tried it, it would only function when the two wires were touching.
i have already taken everything off of the motherboard and hooked it up to the psu, and it still would only work for a second.
