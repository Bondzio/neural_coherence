<s> I have an HP Desktop that came with an AGP video card that has died. </s>
<s> I have an Nvidia PCI card that I installed and have display. </s>
<s> I have been reading that the motherboard supports only one type. </s>
<s> Obviously mine would support the AGP as it was in it when bought. </s>
<s> Can I do this or do I have to buy another AGP. </s>
<s> You shouldn't have any problem. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> The PCI card is very old. </s>
<s> If you don't change the motherboard, buy another AGP card instead of it. </s>
<s> This one is pretty good. </s>
