Have an ipod and Maxtor 3100 external hard drive running Windox XP Professional on Dell D600.
Can connect each individually through USB with no problem.
If ipod is plugged in while external hard drive is connected, Windows XP indicates &quot;USB Device not recognized&quot;.
Likewise if ipod has been connected by itself working fine, then connect external drive, ipod no longer recognized.
Can someone help?
