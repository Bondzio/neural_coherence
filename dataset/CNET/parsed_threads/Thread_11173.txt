<s> I have a 6 yr old HP pavillion, desktop. </s>
<s> This computer shuts down without warning. </s>
<s> Sometimes I can restart. </s>
<s> Sometimes it won.t restart for hours. </s>
<s> I think its overheating, but cannot proof this ther. </s>
<s> I have opened the case to keep it cooler but it still shuts off. </s>
<s> Some days it does not shut off. </s>
<s> Help </s>
<s> Besides opening case, clean it out and blow out any dust build-up, etc.. Further, make darn sure all *fans* are working 100%, not intermit. </s>
<s> Makes ure the psu fan itself is running, if itsn't it won't be apparent and the psu becomes weak and cuases power problems, plus it may blow. </s>
<s> Also, verify the cpu HSF(heatsink) is OK, not dangling at an &quot;angle&quot; or such, because it must be fully in contact with the cpu to disperse heat and do its job, in other words don't take anything for granted, check it. </s>
<s> Finally, being 6yr. </s>
<s> old it could be on its last legs and showing that the psu just has degraded to a point to become, &quot;iffy&quot; and replacement is the real cure. </s>
<s> Further, all componets together due to age taht any one componet is dragging down and being old system it won't take much. </s>
<s> However, you probably have a weak psu, rep;lace it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks willy, I just went through a recovery cycle and was putting XP back on over an old windows 98 when it shut down in the middle of installing xp. </s>
<s> Is there a fan that will fit over the cpu? </s>
<s> Is the psu plugged into the mother board? </s>
<s> RKILLGORE </s>
<s> PSU = power supply unit HSF = heatsink fan setup The power supply/psu can get old and degraded and simply behave as you described, though it could be another problem, I'm betting possibility on the psu being flaky. </s>
<s> Further, a HSF over the years can creep away or fall abit due to gravity and heat/cold cycles of running on/off. </s>
<s> You should inspect closely to see or simply reseat the whole HSF setup. </s>
<s> This is located on the cpu itself. </s>
<s> depending on your model HP you may(or not) have a secondary fan blowing on or away for greater cooling effect of the cpu, it may also be just a platstic tube or tunnel to allow the cpu fanm outside air. </s>
