Hi, In the very near future, when all the PS3 buzz settles down, I would like to purchase the PS3 unit along with the Gran Turismo HD (as I've invested in steering wheel/pedal hardware in the past). And to certainly take advantage of the &quot;high definition&quot; output of the PS3 and GT HD, I would need a 1080i display. But I don't want to invest a couple of grand in a large 40 or 50-inch family room LCD/Plasma display, but instead would like to upgrade my current ViewSonic 17&quot; CRT monitor and get myself a either a standard or a widescreen LCD computer screen. If that's the case, would I be able to take the HD (HDMI?) output of the PS3 and display it on the computer LCD screen? Would there be a conversion with cables/adaptors that I'd have to use? The PS3 is already a big investment itself, so I'd like to balance it out with a LCD display that would be used for my regular computer games, internet surfing, digital image editing, etc. Appreciate anyone's feedback! Paul

Once I hookup the hdmi to dvi cable and get video, how would you get sound? Would you just use the white and red cables that came with the TV hookups? Thanks
