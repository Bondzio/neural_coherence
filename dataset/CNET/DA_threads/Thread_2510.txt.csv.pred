1.1.1	ok, i got a deal on a compusa house brand dvd drive with lightscribe a few months ago .	St
1.1.2	.	St
1.1.3	.	St
1.1.4	works pretty well but lately i have been getting a lot of bad burns.	St
1.1.5	&quot;burn failed&quot; etc etc .	St
1.1.6	.	St
1.1.7	.	St
1.1.8	granted my software is not great, VERY old sonic recordnow and now a slightly dated copy of nero.	St
1.1.9	but they were working well enough up til recently.	St
1.1.10	i also had a failed lightscribe label burn once.	St
1.1.11	I am using various media, altho the sony CD's i have here are the worst offenders.	St
1.1.12	so i don't know if it's a bad stack of blank disks or the drive.	St
1.1.13	any way to test a drive to see if it's dying?	St
1.1.14	thanks - fj	Polite
1.2.1	A cd/dvd lens cleaner then reduce the burn speed to at least 1/2 the rated media speed or 1/2 the recorder's max speed whichever is less.	St
1.2.2	As to tests there aren't many.	St
1.2.3	If playback is an issue I use a GEEXBOX cd to test.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well this may sound odd, but I had the same problem happen to me, I was getting more and more failed burns, but on both of my DVD burners.	St
1.3.2	So I was sure it was something else going on.	St
1.3.3	What I found that fixed my problem was to clean up my computer, I ran a regcleaner and removed any old programs/files/temp files.	St
1.3.4	This did not fix it.	St
1.3.5	Then I defragged the HD and this is what fixed my problem.	St
1.3.6	By the way I have also had problems with Sony discs in the past.	St
1.3.7	I now buy the Fry's cheap (always on sale) brand and have had no problems with them.	St
1.3.8	Also you may want to see if your DVD burner has an updated flash BIOS available.	St
1.3.9	I updated my Emprex (which is really a BTC), to allow more types of media to work.	St
1.3.10	One other thing, you may want to turn on verify after burn in Nero for awile until you are sure everything is working.	St
1.3.11	Its a bummer to find out your backup is no good.	St
1.3.12	Hope this helps.	St

1.4.1	Nero Six and Seven have a tools section that can test both the drive & Discs	St
1.5.1	When you start to see bad burn's and have also problems reading, it is usually caused by a dirty lens in your optical drive.	St
1.5.2	In a house/office where people smoke, you will have to clean your lens every 2 weeks.	St
1.5.3	The smoke does the same as on your lungs, the lense get covered with e layer of tar or whatever the brown gunge is.	St
1.5.4	Manufacturers used to suggest to clean the optics after every 8 hours of use, although this is a bit too frequent I think.	St
1.5.5	Normally once a month - depending on how much you use it - will do fine.	St
1.5.6	I find it unbelievable that so few people do maintenance on their equipment and perhaps it is because these things have become so cheap.	St
1.5.7	Still, using a good cleaning disc for these optical drives cost around the 5$ and it still cheaper than a new drive and can be used many times.	St
1.5.8	I also saves you the job to open up your system to replace the drive.	St
1.5.9	The good cleaning disc's have like 2 &quot;false eyelashes&quot; stuck to it.	St
1.5.10	You can even find then in the superstores in the CD section or at Radio Shack's.	St
1.5.11	If the drive has been a long time in use without maintenace you might have to clean it manually, but that is more for a tecnician to do as you would have to take the drive apart.	St
1.5.12	Also cleaning up and unfragmenting your system as mentioned before does wonders on improving speed to supply the data to your writer.	St
1.5.13	The Nero tools can help to diagnose, but do not fix anything.	St
1.5.14	Best of luck.	St
