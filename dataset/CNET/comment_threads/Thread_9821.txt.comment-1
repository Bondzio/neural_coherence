I'd like to learn more about VOIP.
Is there any articles to recommend for reading?
And is application like Skype, PC Telephone also considered as VOIP?
And I came across an advertisement of D-Link DVG-G1402S wireless router with embedded VOIP functionality.
Does this router provide the same functionality of a traditional router (that is to provide Internet connection to the PC) and at the same time, you can connect a analogue phone and fax machine to it if a VOIP service is engaged?
Thank you.
