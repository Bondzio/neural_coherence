willy, thanks for your usual good advice.
my question concerns the second power supply unit (psu) fan you mentioned.
a psu comes with a built-in fan and this fan exhausts itself outside the computer case, hence good cooling.
if we put in a second fan to cool the psu, where would this fan go?
if it were an exhaust fan, wouldn't there need to be a second exhaust opening in the case?
alternatively, if a cooling fan were just pointed at the psu, that might not do anything more than move hot air from the psu to another point inside the computer case.
also, there would be other fans in the case, too: one for the cpu and another for the video card (all just assumptions).
all fans might just end up shuttling hot air from one to another.
pc power and cooling's web site says, &quot;a well-designed cooling scheme utilizing two fans is just as effective at ventilating your case as adding 15 fans with no overall plan&quot;.
how then can we come up with a well-designed cooling plan?
i know this may be difficult to describe without a diagram, but can you get us pointed in the right direction?
