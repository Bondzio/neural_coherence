well, there is little that can be done outside of what a professional data recovery service could offer.
by cracking the case, yes, you are voiding the warranty with the manufacturer, however, you may have that rare fortune of getting the internal ide drive recognized if the problem was with the external case interface.
there are several exceptional recovery services available.
actionfront data recovery - actionfront.com (a seagate subsidiary) is at the forefront, and currently is promoting their service with a free pocket drive.
i was unfortunate enough that my data was critical and i needed it recovered and i used them.
(note, they are also the backbone of seagate data recovery -  well, $750 later and some tears and sweat, i am much further ahead.
their customer service was hands down exceptional, and they recovered 100% of what i needed.
(if they could not, i would not have been charged!!
)...needless to say, had their service not been available, my data would have been lost forever!
good luck with whatever course of action you take.
