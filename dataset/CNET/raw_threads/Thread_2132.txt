You may be asking how to set your wifi connection to connect automatically but you seem to think this Hotspot shield does that. I have tripled check what Hotspot Shield does and it does not manage the connections. Bob

Hot spot sheild is a VPN Client used to secure your Internet traffic. What he would like to have happen is for the HotSpot Sheild VPN client to connect automatically upon system startup. I would assume that he/she already has an active Internet connection and would just like to establish a connection to the VPN. Samibytn let me know if this is what you meant as I am also seeking a solution to this issue. Regards
