I am also looking for ssd drive but damn these things are expensive.
I am leaning more towards OCS MLC drives because they seem cheaper than anything else.
Intel 30GB is selling for around $370 and OCZ is right now for $99.
I have been using this website http://www.easypricetracker.com/searchex.wsh/ocz+ssd/0/0/25/0/0/-/-1/-1/result.html to check for prices and price charts - hopefully prices will go down to $69 which is the lowest reported by this site.
