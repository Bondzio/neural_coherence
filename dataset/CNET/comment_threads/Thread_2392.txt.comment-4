If this was my machine I'd watch for signs that a drive was on the verge of failure.
The BIOS boot screen could read &)(*()(DVD)*)(*( instead of LD DVDROM MASTER.
These clues lead us to what to do next.
Also, I know to see if the FIRMWARE is current and I also will fit 80 conductor cables, set the jumpers to CS since that's my most trouble free setups.
Sadly, the drive or part with the issue didn't reveal itself (yet).
