When paying extra for USB 2.0 cables, I noticed they don't appear to be any different than my USB 1.1 cables. Asked a knowledgeable salesperson, he said USB 2.0 cables are marked. I can find no difference! Either this is just a marketing ploy or I have been using, then giving away USB 2.0 cables. Does anyone have any info about this? chuck

You don't want to know the number of times I see some complaint about a USB 2.0 device not running at full speed and the line goes silent when you ask &quot;Are you using 2.0 cables.&quot; Given that such a cable is not a premium price (note the price is $1.19 at http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=USB2-10-AB ) I'm unsure what &quot;extra&quot; price people pay for this. Seems not much could be saved. Bob

At Microcenter where I got my hub, USB 2.0 cables were running $10-20(found $4.95 in town source). I understood 2.0 cables and hubs were different(throughput), but can't find VISUAL difference. They won't let me take them somewhere to bench test them before I buy them. chuck

You also need a piece of gear such as HP's RF Network Analyzer http://wwwasic.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/testlab/g_info/HP4396A.html to see what the signals do on the cable from your USB 1.x speeds of 11 Mbps to 480 Mbps. Given that it's a dollar for the cable, I don't understand when people don't use the right cable. And since the cables are a dollar, why not slice a few open and see the difference? Bob
