In the hostel our lan connection its limited : we can not use torrents, or things like dc++ and also we can not have routers so we can share the lan. i really want to work this out cause i have 2 laptos , ipad and phone so i need wireless.

Cnet forum policies don't allow help with hacking. You'll have to contact your ISP and plead your case as an exception.
