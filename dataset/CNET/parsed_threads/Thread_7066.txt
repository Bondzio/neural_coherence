<s> I have been looking into getting a Wireless G PC card (Not the At&t/phone carrier ones, the Netgear and Linksys ones). </s>
<s> I know that the PC cards boost your bandwith and help you to get a better internet connection. </s>
<s> Now, I've noticed that these handy gadgets can be very expensive. </s>
<s> Does anybody know a good, not pricey PC card that works great? </s>
<s> My laptop's internal works very nicely. </s>

<s> My laptop's internal is good for at home, but I travel around a lot. </s>
<s> I just wish that my laptop's internal had a better connection.... </s>
<s> http://www.cantenna.com/laptop.html notes an Hawking unit that has an replaceable antenna. </s>
<s> Arm yourself with that and pick up a better antenna too. </s>

<s> I'm not sure that I will get this product, but thanks! </s>
