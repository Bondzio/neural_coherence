hello all, yeterday i bought a thoshiba store art 3 1tb external hard drive.
it had some drivers inside(200mb) and when i checked the available space, it was showning 931gb.
i checked with the vendor and he said &quot;the acutul and the available capacities are always different and moreover it is having some space reserved for backup&quot;.
i do not have the access to the 1024-931=93gbs and the moment and i feel confused.
i can see two partitions /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 but only one is accessible to me.
also i am using fedora 13 and the speed i am getting is 1mb/s which is very low.
pls advice.... thanks in advance|adarsh
