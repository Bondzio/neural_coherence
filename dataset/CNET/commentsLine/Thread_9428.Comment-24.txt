i don't upgrade often, don't buy bleeding edge technology, and keep my pcs in service for several years (typically more than 5).
i do this by gradual upgrades.
i've found a local white-box store that will configure a system to my specifications and needs.
they're not cheap because my requirements are complex, but the resulting systems are almost always a lot less expensive than those from the brand-name places.
usually this process starts with choosing (with their help) a motherboard with the fastest available fsb that is compatible with a really fast cpu, with a really cheap cpu and with more ram than i'll ever need.
then i add the very slowest and cheapest cpu compatible with that board and the least memory possible to run the operating system.
i try to buy a stand-alone version of the os so i can (re)install it myself as needed.
add peripherals as needed (be sure to include a floppy drive -- they're too cheap to leave out) and a linux-compatible modem so i can convert it to a linux box for use with a few dial-up sites when it becomes too obsolete.
then i monitor the cpu and ram prices for the next two or three years.
when they come down far enough, i max out the board.
in the end, this can be less expensive.
for example, my current box is maxed out with a 2.8 ghz p4; when i first bought it, i got a 1.7 ghz celeron for $120 (iirc) when the 2.8 ghz p4s were selling for somewhere between $700 and $900.
a few years later, i replaced the celeron with a 2.8 ghz p4 for around $200 (plus a pitiful trade-in on the celeron) and in the process upgraded from a 400 mhz fsb processor to a 533 mhz fsb processor.
total outlay for cpu: $320 rather than somewhere between $700 and $900.
i also quadrupled the ram because those prices had also come down.
in addition, of course, i upgraded the various drives as needed and as new technology became available.
meanwhile, i converted my old box (acquired in 1999) into a dual-boot w98 se / suse linux 8.1 pro box and still use it.
