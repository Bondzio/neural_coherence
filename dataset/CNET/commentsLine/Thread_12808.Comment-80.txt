i have only bought one computer.
and, it was a very long time ago.
after that peice of junk, i decided to build every computer i have owned since, for various reasons already mentioned in this thread.
but, pimarily because i have the knowledge and abilty to do so.
and, i can always build a better one that suits my needs now,primarily as a gamer.
i started building/engineering computers back in the 1970's
