1.1.1	Hi Thanks In advance for any help.	Polite
1.1.2	I recently tried to upgrade my Dell C521 4GB 32-bit, Radeon x1300/1550 graphics card with this: SPARKLE SX98GT512D3L-NM GeForce 9800 GT 512MB 256-bit GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready Low Profile Ready Video Card - Retail from Newegg It was a bit difficult to insatll but i pluged it in and turned on the pc....the button usually green is yellow and only the the fan and dvd drive come on..the pc dosent boot up.	St
1.1.3	I was thinking i need to replace the power supply which was 280Watt.	St
1.1.4	My warranty recently expired and I'd like to avoid paying $50 only to be told to order a power supply.	St
1.1.5	Thanks -T	St
1.2.1	appears to have a separate power connector on the rear side.	St
1.2.2	It needs a direct connection to the power supply in order to work.	St
1.2.3	Did you see it and plug in the connector?	St
1.3.1	yes I did see it but was not clear what pluged into what.	Res
1.3.2	plus the cords didnt strecth.	St
1.3.3	But about the power supply..do you think I need to replace it...is there a &quot;reset&quot; button?	St
1.3.4	All my product doc is on the hard drive, so I cant look anything up.	St
1.4.1	and it may not have the 6 pin PCI express power connector that the video card needs.	St
1.4.2	No, there's no reset button.	St
1.4.3	You may not have zapped the PS but it's a good bet it's under powered for your system now.	St
1.5.1	So you mean I will have replace power supply?	St
1.6.1	SO then I'll have to replace?	St
1.7.1	I don't want to sound rude but, if the answer is &quot;No&quot;, the answer to your question should be obvious.	St
1.7.2	If it does have the connector and you haven't plugged it in, the next step to take is also obvious.	St
1.7.3	That's all I can offer.	St
1.7.4	Best of luck.	St
1.8.1	Sorry I wasnt clear....I actually pluged in the video card turned on the pc and it ran bu didnot boot up.	St
1.8.2	Seconds later i kind of smell a burning smell and tuned it off.	St
1.8.3	the smell was comming from the power supply.	St
1.8.4	I tried to turn it on and and then the fan would only start, and dvd drive.	St
1.8.5	So this is why I'm thinking the power supply?	St
