<s> Hello, I've some problems getting 4GB DDR2-800 RAMs. </s>
<s> Currently, I've one 2GB DDR2-800 connected, working perfectly. </s>
<s> But when I connect another RAM of the same type with the same bus speed (Kingston KVR800D2N6/2G, the computer fails to boot. </s>
<s> My motherboard is Intel DG41RQ. </s>
<s> On the Intel's website, it says that the mobo can support 8GB of Maximum RAM. </s>
<s> I'm only connecting 4GB with 2GB, same type, same bus speed in each slot. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=39683 DG41RQ Specs. </s>
<s> My doubt is pointing towards the PSU. </s>
<s> I've a generic 400W PSU, could it be a problem? </s>
<s> My Specs are as under: DG41RQ 500HDD SATA nVidia 9500GT 1GB DDR2 2GB DDR2-800 RAM 400W Generic (Xilience) PSU Intel Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz (E7400) PS. </s>
<s> I bought a new HDD along with the RAM so there was no OS in it. </s>
<s> If the one stick at a time test passes. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
<s> If I put the RAMs separately, they work. </s>
<s> But they don't work together. </s>
<s> See if the motherboard maker has issued a new BIOS. </s>
<s> Be sure not to twiddle with the bios settings, try the defaults. </s>
