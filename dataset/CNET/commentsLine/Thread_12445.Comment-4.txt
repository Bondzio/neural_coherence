more confusion.
if all you want is something to hear sound with, and are not really worried about the acoustic quality of the sound you hear, the a cheap set of speakers will do.
(still powered ones though.)
there are speakers out there that do not require any power but the audio output of your mac does not have enough ooomph to make them work.
the sound it produces requires amplification before it is strong enough to hear and for this, the speakers need power.
the jbl speakers are 120v powered as are the logitech ones.
i didn't find any information on the altec lansing v52420 and i now know that is because it is actually a vs2420!
(tsk tsk) this one will be good too as it is also 120v powered.
so, whichever one you fancy from j & r will be good for your machine.
of course, you can still check out radio shack.
let us know what you decide p
