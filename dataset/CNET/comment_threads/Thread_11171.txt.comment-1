Hi I am a bit confused with whats going on with my Router Signal.
I previously had a Linksys WRT54G, before I upgraded to my new router I was getting quite good signals and my internet speed on my pc was ranging from 3.7 - 4.5 Mbps.
After upgrading to a Cisco Linksys E4200 based on the great Cnet ratings, my internet speed has plumetted to a range of 2.5 - 3.1 Mbps and the Signal Strength on my wireless connection has gone to &quot;Very Low&quot; I have checked the channels of the surrounding routers (using a software called network stumbler ).
I am using channel 1 which is not being used by anyone else.
I am just surprised, I thought my speed and connection strength would sky rocket after getting such a good router.
Anyone got any idea what I may be doing wrong?
