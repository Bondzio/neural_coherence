what you are saying about registry cleaners being 'all bad' is probably a holdover from the days when they were new and a bit shaky around the edges.
it's also like saying, &quot;my dad had a chevy truck and it was a lemon' and refuse to even consider another chevy anything, ever, because someone else had a bad experience.
learn from the bad experiences, but don't let it color your own attitudes about stuff to the point where you lose more than you gain by avoidance.
and yes, try a freebie that will give you a demo first, look at what they find, do your homework by finding forums for that cleaner, online, and what problems they're having.
dont listen to the hype in the ads.
listen to users.
