Hello, I am an aspiring PC builder, and after much researh I have come upon many questions.
I guess my main question is this: Should I wait until Vista and Direct X 10 come out before I build my first system?
Will the new top of the line cards like the ATI 1900 512 mb be direct X 10 ready, or will a whole new set of cards come out just for DX 10?
Thanks you.
