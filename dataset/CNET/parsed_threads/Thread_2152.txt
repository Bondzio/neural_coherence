<s> What is amount of power that needed for a case of P4 with a CRT monitor (17&quot;) (350 W, 400 W or more)? </s>
<s> Trick question? </s>
<s> With such no power supply is needed because without memory, hard disks and more, there is no need to power it. </s>
<s> You can also read this one for a power budget -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ My selection is now 450 or larger since I don't need to stress or tax a power supply. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Which graphic card is the best if high performance in 3D Game and other graphical programs and also TV-OUT needed? </s>
<s> Please mention few cards. </s>
<s> Another trick question? </s>
<s> You should supply what you can buy since some countries can't get the latest Radeon or Nvidias. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If a computer has a motherboard with Bus 400 MHz and 512 MB RAM (DDR400), Which CPU needed for it to perfectly improve its performance (2.4 MHz or more)? </s>
<s> and for 533 MHz? </s>
<s> Is this in September or July? </s>
<s> Frankly, you should look at benchmarks at http://www.tomshardware.com and others to find a ready answer. </s>
<s> But the simple answer is that within a CPU technology, more MHz is faster. </s>
<s> Change technology such as a step up in FSB, then you need to re-run the benchmarks. </s>
<s> Do another change in technology like HyperThreading or Centrino and then you run the benchmarks again. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Which CD-RW drive (internal and with ATA or likely SATA connection) is best in point of view quality and speed? </s>
<s> This is a good one. </s>
<s> There is NO QUALITY in the CDRW drive market. </s>
<s> The simple proof of this is no-one will give you a 3 to 5 year warranty and the the price for this sort of drive is from $9.99 to about $69 for a DVD-CDRW combo drive. </s>
<s> At abotu $69 and up, you get into your DVD recorders which do CDRW as well. </s>
<s> But let me ask this. </s>
<s> What defines quality? </s>
<s> Would you pay 500 dollars for a quality CDRW drive that you can keep for 5 years or would you be OK to replace a 10 dollar drive every other year? </s>
<s> Visit http://www.cdspeed2000.com/ to get an idea about some models, but bear in mind that CDRW drive models are changed out about every month it seems. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Which flatbed scanner in A4 size and at least 1200x1200 dpi resolution is the best one in point of view quality and speed of scan? </s>
<s> This one is almost brutal. </s>
<s> You'll need to obtain a short list of what you would buy, toss them in a spreadsheet and start filling in the numbers. </s>
<s> While I my just pick up a box with some HP or other scanner and go home to scan, you'll be doing your research. </s>
<s> While you may flame me for this, I will not be doing your research, but will note the HP and other scanners you see at the stores are pretty nice to have. </s>
<s> All seem to do A4. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Rub, rub rub, rub rub rub. </s>
<s> Sorry the crystal ball seems to be broken at the moment. </s>
<s> You need to post more information about the computer so you can get a better answer. </s>
<s> However, a 400-watt PSU does fine for most everyday systems. </s>
<s> You should post CPU size, memory, how many drives, video card and what ever else you may have. </s>
