It would have to be a flat bed type as these photographs would not survive a journey through the sheet fed variety. I would need on-board storage (as much as possible) and portable power supply. Output to a MAC would be preferable but not a necessity. I couldn't find any product in previous threads on this subject, but wonder if there are any new products on the market. I gather a high resolution (&gt;10 megs) digital camera might be the answer, but I need the highest resolution I can get. Any suggestions? Thanks.

A favorite (I bought 2!) is the now discontinued HP C9900A photo scanner. I decline duplicating specs or how it works but suffice it to say it's been grand to carry along to capture photos that fit on it. Bob
