Desktop system: Pentium 3, WinXP Pro I am looking at the following: SYBA PCMCIA PCI to Cardbus Add-on Card Model SD-PCI-PCM - I want to install in one of the Desktop expansion slots so I can use my Express card on the desktop as well as in my Dell e1505 Notebook.
Vendors can't tell me if this SYBA card will work.
Anyone know?
Or know of another product that will get the job done inexpensively?
