it was a new seagate barracuda 320gb (3mths old, sata - seemed to be a spate of these at one point which quickly tailed off) it was a platter defect i believe - after a normal shut down it lost the boot sector and mbr - i was unable to restore either and had quite a bit of stuff i did not have duplicated on other drives in some form so after a spinrite session which found the data areas to be fine, and no luck with free recovery applications, i bought a copy of seagate's recovery software.
found all my files, and then some - internet cache... except for a few mp3s the data was intact.
i then nuked the drive and tried a clean install on it - it failed right after the 1st reboot so it got rma'd
