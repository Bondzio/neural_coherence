Have you ever actually checked to see if your cartridge levels are accurate?
Or checked to see how much the printer really cost you?
Lexmark is well known in the inkjet printer world to be one of the, if not the most expensive printer to own, not buy, but own.
Can you actually see how much ink is left in the cartridge?
Only brands that you can are Canon and Brother, because on some of their cartridges they use clear plastic.
Now that being said, I do like Lexmark laser printers, and give them high regards, but for a home user, Lexmark is a costly investment.
