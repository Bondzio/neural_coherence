<s> I'm in the process of restoring an old computer for a friend to give away to charity. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, she threw away the CDs and floppies that came with the computer including the replacment sound card. </s>
<s> I've tried everything I know to try identify the sound card and download the correct drivers without success. </s>
<s> Does anyone have some advice or suggestions on how I can find the brand and model of the sound card? </s>
<s> I have not removed it from the tower but will if that is what's needed. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> glb, If this is a name brand system and the orginal Sound card is still installed go to their web site and download the drivers. </s>
<s> If it is not the you will have to pull the card. </s>
<s> Look for a Mnf name and model on card or on the largest chip. </s>
<s> Then you will have to do a Google search. </s>
<s> Post back what you find for futher assistance. </s>
<s> Bill . </s>
<s> I got it fixed thanks to the owner. </s>
<s> It was the one CD she didn't throw away. </s>
<s> I didn't know she had the sound card replaced so I was trying to install drivers from the manufacturer's web site for her model. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I never did find any utility that would identify the sound card for me. </s>
<s> Had she not come up with the name and CD, I don't know if I would have ever figured it out. </s>
<s> Since I didn't need to remove it, I didn't have a chance to look at it. </s>
<s> Do sound cards have the name written on them anywhere? </s>
<s> If you really didn't know which one was installed, how would you find out? </s>
<s> glb613, There are several programs that you can use to id the parts in the box. </s>
<s> I use aida32 and Belarc. </s>
<s> Both are free and can be downloaded at different sites. </s>
<s> Just type in Google search. </s>
<s> The mfg. </s>
<s> of the chipset on the card is of primary importance. </s>
<s> In many instances they are the same mfg. </s>
<s> For example, the mfg. </s>
<s> may be Creative, Turtle Beach,CMI, etc. </s>
<s> While this may be a clue to chipset identity, you can not rely solely on this info. </s>
<s> You must identify the chipset. </s>
<s> For example, CMI8738 or ES1312, etc. </s>
<s> Each chipset has its unique model number. </s>
<s> Another way to identify is to visually inspect the card. </s>
<s> The id is usually printed on the chipset. </s>
<s> Then you can go to the site of the chipset mfg. </s>
<s> and search for the proper driver for that chipset. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> I ran Belarc and it didn't identify the card until after I installed the drivers and software. </s>
<s> Had the owner not come up with the CD, I would have needed to remove the card and inspect it. </s>
<s> The computer is now up and running great. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
