I have not kept up with the CPU wars and motherboards like before everyone headed off to college. Can folks recommend some solid dual core - motherboard combination's for the non-overclocking crowd? Also need input on case/power supply combinations and midrange video cards. My last several builds were with ANTEC cases along with PC Power and Cooling power supplies. He has a PS3 for playing games and BluRay. If there are some good links to budget builds - please send them on! Thanks in advance, SKIMEISTER

I've seen many in the $400 range to include the monitor which maybe a LCD type. If you really shop, then be prepared to drop the bucks and these are sales prices, and easily go up within a week. Just find what you want, but don't expect these $400 releases to be power systems, but they'll do far better than that old HP. Look at Dell, eMachines, Compaq from vendors like Best Buy, OfficeMax or their own online sales. tada -----Willy
