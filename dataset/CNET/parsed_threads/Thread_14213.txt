<s> I have a problem that I've assumed was with my Internet service provider, but I'm beginning to believe that it's the result of a problem with my Netgear WGR614 (v6) WiFi/wired router. </s>
<s> After rebooting the cable modem, the router, and the PC, I get the advertised 4000Kbps download speed. </s>
<s> After half an hour or so, it's down to 2000Kbps. </s>
<s> Within hours, the speed is less than 100Kbps (no, I'm not missing a zero there) and sometimes is as low as 30Kbps. </s>
<s> The results of restarting individual components have been inconclusive at best, as have searches for trouble reports regarding the router. </s>
<s> If others have seen this problem or know either that it does exist (or that it doesn't) that information would be helpful as I wrestle with my ISP. </s>
<s> I'd like to pin the problem on the actual cause of the problem and fix it. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> All of these had a LEECH using their wifi system. </s>
<s> To fix it we first disable the WIFI and get wired. </s>
<s> For wifi there is some issue with P2P apps so to fix that we get wired. </s>
<s> For the other issues we enable SSID broadcast and use WPA. </s>
<s> Sorry if this is so much to swallow in so few words but I can't write novels for each post like this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, Bob. </s>
<s> I'm fairly certain there's no leech involved here. </s>
<s> * Currently I'm testing a direct connection to the cable modem. </s>
<s> This will either confirm or refute my original theory that the problem is the cable modem or the ISP. </s>
<s> Once I get past that, if it's not the cable modem or the ISP, I'll need to start looking for local causes. </s>
<s> *I have reasons for thinking this, including the fact that the neighborhood is made up of people older than I am, and I'm old enough to remember when dirt was in beta test. </s>
<s> Would be used by any compromised windows machine since there is no security. </s>
<s> It seems I'm teaching more about security today that doing any real repairs. </s>
<s> Remember, it's not people I'm finding to be the leech... Bob </s>
<s> Bob, I know that out of the box the security is crap. </s>
<s> I've fixed that. </s>
<s> There is no leech here. </s>
<s> Although Ive thought that the problem was not within the LAN, Ive had this back-of-my-mind suspicion that maybe it wasnt Wide Open West. </s>
<s> Maybe it was the router. </s>
<s> I disconnected the router, connected the desktop system to the cable modem and At 3:37 pm on Saturday, July 21, 2007, immediately after rebooting the modem and the computer and after taking the router out of the picture, I saw 4309Kbps. </s>
<s> This makes it look like it might be the router after all. </s>
<s> But less than half an hour later (with the desktop computer still connected directly to the cable modem) my downlink speed is a quarter of what it was. </s>
<s> Eight minutes later, the speed dropped to 684Kbps (this is still a direct connection to the cable modem -- no WiFi; no leech.) </s>
<s> So I withdraw my question. </s>
<s> The problem is clearly not with the router. </s>
<s> Not with a leech. </s>
<s> The problem is squarely in my ISP's court. </s>
<s> Just a note. </s>

<s> I'll share a link where I reveal WEP and MAC filtering is dead. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 I've also used the 614 so unless you have one with ancient firmware or it's busted I don't think the error is there. </s>
<s> To summarize use WPA and broadcast the SSID. </s>
<s> Some find the speed or connection drops if they disable the SSID broadcast. </s>
<s> Eight minutes later, the speed dropped to 684Kbps Is this some P2P app? </s>
<s> Some are unaware about ISPs that do bandwidth shaping. </s>
<s> Sorry if this seems nosy but it's something you might want to know about. </s>
<s> Here's a link that notes a few ISPs that do this -&gt; http://www.azureuswiki.com/index.php/Main_Page See the article on Traffic Shaping. </s>

<s> and I updated the firmware http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/wgr614v6.asp Broadcast SSID WPA security do NOT use Mac address filtering I have elcheapo DSL. </s>
<s> I connect at 54.0 Mbps on the router and my download speed is aroung 90 Kbps. </s>
<s> Did you update the firmware and follow Bob's advice? </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> Maybe I'm not being clear here: WiFi is NOT in the picture at this point. </s>
<s> The router is not connected to anything. </s>
<s> The computer is connected directly to the ISP's cable modem and I'm seeing the same degradation I saw when the router was in the picture. </s>
<s> The means (at least to my feeble mind) that the router isn't involved. </s>
<s> Wide Open West (aka &quot;Wowway&quot;) provides http://www.dslreports.com/ as a place to check uplink and downlink speeds. </s>
<s> Wow may not be the sharpest ISP in the tool kit, but it doesn't show up on the AzureusWiki list. </s>
<s> for the firmware for you isp's cable modem. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> The desktop computer is connected directly to the cable modem. </s>
<s> The router is out of the picture. </s>
<s> Disconnected. </s>
<s> Not turned off, but it might as well be because nothing is connected to it. </s>
<s> Nothing at all. </s>
<s> Would updating the firmware of a router that's not connected to anything have any effect? </s>
<s> If there is some P2P software in use. </s>
<s> That is where most are complaining since many ISPs are adding shaping. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> I missed &quot;If there is some P2P software in use. </s>
<s> That is where most are complaining since many ISPs are adding shaping.? </s>
<s> No P2P. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I measure speed using the tool that Wide Open West provides to their clients. </s>
<s> I provided the link in an earlier post. </s>
<s> Here it is again. </s>
<s> It's a fairly standard speed test: http://www.dslreports.com/ </s>
<s> This is not a good format to hold all the info so if I miss a detail or you don't answer a question then I ask. </s>
<s> It appears to be something between you and your ISP to work out at this point. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> And that's the direction I'm headed. </s>
<s> Wow had sent &quot;technicians&quot; to diagnose the problem, but they claimed it was my router. </s>
<s> Today when I took the router entirely out of the picture, I revealed their lies for what they are. </s>
<s> With a direct connection (no router involved) my current connection speed is below dial-up speed (32Kbps). </s>
<s> I've attracted the attention of some Wow corporate folks, so I'm hoping that they'll actually fix the problem now, not just lie about it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help and the thoughts. </s>
