is that a single network or is it a different network?
i just curious how do you manage the network, ip, nat, dhcp, etc.?
i quote: === at home, i have a switch, connected to a belkin pre-n wireless router, connected to a linksys/vonage voip router, connected to my cable company's modem.
i also have a lightyear voip router connected to the vonage router, and it all works just fine together: network printing via konica-minolta magicolor color laserjet ethernet printer, two ip phones, 4 laptops, 2 windows desktops, 1 linux desktop, and an audio/video recording studio system.
