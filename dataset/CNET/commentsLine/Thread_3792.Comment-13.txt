some earlier versions of partition magic may not handle the newest version of ntfs partitions used by xp.
why are you wanting to partition?
if it is for performance or better disk utilization, don't bother.
ntfs is inherently more efficient than the older fat or fat32 file systems, and unlike the older fat files, ntfs does not benefit from smaller partition sizes.
if you are partitioning so you can boot multiple oss, then partition magic with boot magic would be my first recommendation, 2nd would be partition commander with boot commander - either way, use the latest version.
