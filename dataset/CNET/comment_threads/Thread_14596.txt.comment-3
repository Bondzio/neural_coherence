Thanks Bob.
Just checking - so I can replace a wired hub with a, say Linksys WRT54G, router (even tho I currently use dial-up and won't use broadband or DSL access; the wired network is only used basically for back-ups) and will be able to 'talk' to the other wired hub and all other wired computers via wirewless from my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop via the router ?
Regards, Tom
