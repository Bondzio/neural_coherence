<s> My problem is that my PC has lost its operating system and now I am trying to connect my laptop to my PC with a crossover connection. </s>
<s> I am hoping that I can get to my PC's hard drive to copy &quot;My Documents&quot; to another folder or to my laptop. </s>
<s> Looking for some step by step directions. </s>
<s> Can't seem to find my PC in my network places. </s>
<s> Where am i going wrong? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> What do you mean by ''lost its operating system?'' </s>
<s> I am assuming that the operating system was installed and you have run into some problem that will not allow your PC to boot into Windows. </s>
<s> What operating systems are on your computers? </s>
<s> You won't find your PC in My Network Places. </s>
<s> To transfer files over two computers that are networked with a crossover connection, the operating systems needs to be running on both computers. </s>
<s> Have you tried troubleshooting the hard disk by trying to boot to it in Safe Mode? </s>
<s> Have you tried a recovering files with a Knoppix cd? </s>
<s> What have you tried? </s>
<s> If you have tried everything to fix software issues that may be causing your hard disk not to boot, you need to connect the hard disk directly to another computer. </s>
<s> You can make it a secondary disk in another desktop, you can put it into an external enclosure and attach it to your computer, or you can attach it to your notebook via a USB to IDE adapter . </s>
<s> The error is a missing operating system. </s>
<s> Both have XP. </s>
<s> We tried to reboot every possible way. </s>
<s> The recovery disc offers a standard recovery and a full reformat but I would like to recover &quot;my documents&quot;. </s>
<s> I was told that a crossover connection could get me access to my PC hard drive even though it will not boot. </s>
<s> Is that incorrect info? </s>
<s> You recommended putting hard drive in another PC or a USB the 2 together? </s>
<s> The USB would be easiest. </s>
<s> Instruction would be welcomed, thanks for your thought and assistance. </s>
<s> The correct information is that it is ABSOLUTELY necessary that both computers have working operating systems to network them together via a crossover cable. </s>
<s> http://www.practicallynetworked.com/qa/qa20030213.shtml It will cost you no money to put the second drive into a working computer as a slave or on a separate cable. </s>
<s> INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL HARD DIVE AS A SLAVE: Disconnect the data and power cables from the back of your hard drive (HD1). </s>
<s> Pull your hard drive from your computer (comp1). </s>
<s> Look at for a jumper pin diagram on the back of your HD and you should see cap settings for CS, MA, SL. </s>
<s> Those symbols stand for Cable Select, Master, and Slave. </s>
<s> Place the jumper cap over the two pins that designate the drive as a slave. </s>
<s> Now move HD1 to another computer (comp2) and install it on the same data cable as the new computer's hard drive (HD2). </s>
<s> Insert the middle data connector of the cable into HD1 (the slave position). </s>
<s> Install any free power connector into HD1. </s>
<s> Boot comp2 and see if HD1 shows up in comp2's My Computer. </s>
<s> If you have trouble booting comp2, you will need to enter comp2's BIOS settings to tell comp2 explicitly to boot from HD2. </s>
<s> INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL HARD DRIVE ON USB TO IDE ADAPTER: Instructions included with device </s>
<s> Slaved the bad drive, saw it but could not read &quot;parameters not correct&quot; was error message. </s>
<s> Checked Properties of bad drive - file system -RAW not FTNS??? </s>
<s> Knoppix CD????? </s>
<s> tell me more? </s>
<s> (a) Do not worry if you have all your data files in the MY DOCUMENTS FOLDER & you have not deleted this folder OR formatted the hard drive. </s>
<s> b) First step is to use a bootable CD (having Windows 98 Second Edition / XP). </s>
<s> (c)Prior to that - go to the BIOS setup (pressing F2 while the system reboots)- and in the boot device priority, select CD ROM first and then the hard disk. </s>
<s> Save and exit. </s>
<s> (d) The bootable CD should be in the drive when you boot. </s>
<s> It will take you to the A:\ prompt and its directory will show the bootable files that should not be of any concern. </s>
<s> (e) Type d:\ (or any other where you can find your DE drive). </s>
<s> This should show the windows setup files. </s>
<s> (f) Type SETUP and the installation starts. </s>
<s> (g) Once the setup is finished in all respects and the system reboots - press F2 again to enter the BIOS SETUP MENU - go to the boot device priority and set it back to hard disk first and then the CD ROM. </s>
<s> Save and exit. </s>
<s> And let Window do its work to install other drivers and files. </s>
<s> (h)Once Windows has been installed - go to the networking option and install your network computer - (its much easier in XP) Hope it helps otherwise for further information please ask me at: intrstat@lhr.comsats.net.pk </s>
