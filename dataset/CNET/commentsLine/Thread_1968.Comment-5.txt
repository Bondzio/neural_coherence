connecting two pc's isn't a big deal.
having one computer go 'through' another to get to the internet can be a little more complicated.
i don't know what you would have to do to get the cell card to work with your computer, or how your office keeps track of who's connected when.
when you say switcher, i think you're referring to a switch.
you can get a switch, but you'll still have to enable internet connection sharing on the office pc to allow the other computer to use it to get to the internet.
you could possibly attach your second pc to the one that gets to the internet directly, but you'll need a crossover cable.
