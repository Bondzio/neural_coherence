1.1.1	Ok, here is the scenario.	St
1.1.2	I have two rooms, one has the cable modem and wireless router, the other has everything else - printers, Vonage device, etc.	St
1.1.3	I'd like to connect everything in the second room to the wireless network without running a wire or using the ethernet over powerline adapters as I've heard they are worthless.	St
1.1.4	I have two laptops that connect to the wireless network with no problems.	St
1.1.5	I have no desktops in the second room and I don't want to use any of the laptops as servers.	St
1.1.6	So, here's what I have: Room 1: Cable modem with Linksys WRT350N wireless router hooked up to it Room 2: 3 printers (all USB, one is LAN also), Vonage device (LAN) As I said, I can't run a wire to the second room nor do I want to use a ethernet over powerline adapter.	St
1.1.7	Obviously, I can buy a wireless print server for one the servers but there are no N-draft printer servers yet and I would need 3 of them.	St
1.1.8	So, that's out.	Polite
1.1.9	I don't want to buy a N-wireless adapter for each device either.	St
1.1.10	So, what are my options?	Ques
1.1.11	Buy an Access point and plug in a switch or a hub into it, so I can add more than one device?	St
1.1.12	Will it connect to the router and register all the deviced plugged into it to the wireless network?	St
1.1.13	What about a N-draft bridge?	St
1.1.14	Any other ideas?	St
1.1.15	Cost is not an issue Thanks, Chris	St
1.2.1	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=wgps606&btnG=Google+Search I use that to extend my lan to another area.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	thanks Bob, will look into it	Polite
