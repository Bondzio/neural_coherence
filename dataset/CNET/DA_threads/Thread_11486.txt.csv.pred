1.1.1	I just hooked up a Linksys Wireless G 2.4GHz router on a Gateway PC-Pentium 4 , 3.0GHz and 512mb Ram .	St
1.1.2	I 'm now experiencing a major slow down or non-response in opening up programs , logging onto the internet , opening up email and spastic mouse movements ( also wireless , but with two new batteries installed on 8/30 ) .	St
1.1.3	Anyone know what 's up with this ?	Ques
1.2.1	I find new routers to have out of date firmware .	St
1.2.2	Try updating that then and if the problems continue return it as defective .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The wireless signal will always be slower than than the ethernet cable , wireless is affected by the enviroment , the materials of the wall in your house will affect the wireless range , also the 2,4 Ghz phones cant cause interfernce .	St
1.3.2	Try this , go to 2wire.com and choose the speed meter option , check with your ISP what 's your bandwith and if this is lower than the bandwith you 're paying for should be a hardware issue , if is higher there 's a software problem on your computer .	St
1.3.3	Another thing you can try is connect a computer with ethernet cable , and see if the issue with speed still the same , if it does , you better contact your ISP	St
