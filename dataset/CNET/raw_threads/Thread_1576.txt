ALL i really want to do is set up a wlan... no routers no nothing, just to be able to share files between two laptops i just recently bought ( vaio and dell both with internal wireless network cards and wlan) . I would greatly greatly appreciate it if someone could take the time to walk me through the steps one by one please... thanks you.

The one thing that wipes most out is they installed a firewall. But you didn't note it so your issue may be elsewhere. The machines were new so after Windows Update and installing the antivirus I selected a folder to share, set it to adhoc and rebooted. The other machine I did the same and it asked if I wanted to connect to the adhoc network. Very easy and I can't see how a step by step would be needed. But a firewall could squash this. Bob
