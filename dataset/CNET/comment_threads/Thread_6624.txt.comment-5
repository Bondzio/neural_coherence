yeah the eSATA isn't really a big deal for me.
So i should just get it with the 3gb then huh?
im down for that too.
I really wanted this to be available with XP too.
I've heard of way too many glitches and problems with vista.
Is there anything else that i need if i wanted to use my 42&quot; HDTV with this machine?
if so what else would i need?
