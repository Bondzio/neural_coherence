<s> My PC boots normally under light load for nearly 1 hour if I keep my PC OFF for nearly 1 day. </s>
<s> It may run smoothly for more than 1 hour but I never checked it. </s>
<s> (I can play songs, movie, browse internet simultaneously).If I restart the PC, it freezes. </s>
<s> And if I try to boot it again, it doesnt boot. </s>
<s> I keep it OFF for 1 hour. </s>
<s> After 1 hour it runs for sometime and freezes again. </s>
<s> Mouse and keyboard also stop working. </s>
<s> The only way to restart it to press cabinet button for 5 sec so supply to motherboard get cut off. </s>
<s> So if I want to run it for long time, I need to keep it OFF at least 1 day and I cant restart it. </s>
<s> I checked RAM. </s>
<s> IT is working fine. </s>
<s> My configuration is AMD phenom x2 550 black edition. </s>
<s> ASUS M2N68-AM Plus motherboard PSU: Xtech 450-24,Max 450w GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 7025/nforce 630a Initial processor temperature is 36C which increases to 48C in 5 mins under zero load. </s>
<s> I have updated my BIOS version from 0701 to 0804. </s>
<s> So what could be the problem? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Remove the side case cover and point a box fan (those 2 to 3 foot fans) at the machine and retest. </s>
<s> If it runs longer it means that some part is heat sensitive. </s>
<s> Your guess which. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Open case and clean out the dust bunnies. </s>
<s> Leave side cover off and see if the system stays running longer. </s>
<s> If not, then place fan to help cool it. </s>
<s> If it continues to cause a problem at the same stop intervals as before, you may have a &quot;bad caps&quot; situation, google for examples. </s>
<s> Next, your PSU maybe petering out, check all fans to see they're running to include PSU one(if present). </s>
<s> I won't return side until it appears fixed. </s>
<s> If upon returning side cover and it still stops/freezes, then you have some component(anything) that's been compromised by heat stress and will fail all together at some future point. </s>
<s> Then and only then will it becomes obvious as it will work intermittently until failure. </s>
<s> In this case only swapping parts may do to help determine cause. </s>
