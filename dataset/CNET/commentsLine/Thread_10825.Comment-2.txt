i forgot to mention, the only event that i can think of that immediately preceded the drive not working was that the external drive lost power while it was still plugged in.
however, i figured i could treat this similarly to the drive being disconnected from the usb port by accident and simply restart the computer to have it read the drive properly.
this did not work and now i am stuck in my current situation.
