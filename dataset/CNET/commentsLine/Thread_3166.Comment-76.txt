i recent had my external hard drive die.
in fact, it ended up dragging my system down - causing 4 hours to boot up windows, etc.. i was not able to access the drive in its original case.
but, i was able to extract it from the original case, and install it into a new case.
it was just a regular ide hard drive.
the new case only cost $17.99.
and, now it works fine.
