I just installed a motherboard, Intel Desktop Board D865PERL, that has 2 sata ports and 2 pata ports.
The problem I'm having is that my hard drive, IBM Desktop S/N A4DBP79F, and secondary optical device is IDE/PATA and I have installed a new DVD writer that is SATA.
When I change drive settings in the bios to enhanced and re-boot the system will not see my hard drive.
I then changed the drive setting to legacy and chose PATA Pri/SATA Sec and the system will re-boot properly but it will not see the secondary optical device.
There are multiple pin configurations on the hard drive and I was wondering if the jumpers could possibly be the problem.
Its set to master now.
