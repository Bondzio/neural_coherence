Suddenly, for some reason, my two Lenovo laptops last week (one is Windows XP and one is Windows 7) couldn't find any wireless networks. When I click on &quot;View Wireless Networks&quot; all that comes up is the Iban computer to computer network. I know the wireless network router is working as I can connect to it with my non 3G iPad. I also took both computers to work and couldn't connect to an open wireless router there. I am puzzled as to how to even begin troubleshooting.

I uninstalled Norton but the wi fi network still does not show up as an available network. Any other ideas? I&quot;m thinking maybe I should do a system restore if someone can guide me in how to do that.
