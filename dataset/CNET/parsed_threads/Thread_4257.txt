<s> I've got an old Dell Dimension 4300 desktop and am looking to upgrade it's RAM. </s>
<s> I know what type it needs (168-Pin SDRAM PC 133), but I'm not sure about the size. </s>
<s> According to the specs the system has two slots and will accept 64, 128, 256, and 512 MB sticks. </s>
<s> But it also says that the maximum amount of memory is 512. </s>
<s> My question is, does that 512 MB limit refer to each stick, or does it refer to the total system memory? </s>
<s> The crucial website claims the system can support 1 GB (as two 512 sticks). </s>
<s> Are they mistaken? </s>
<s> Also, if the limit does refer only to the size of each individual stick, can I get a 512 to go along with my current 256 stick, or do they have to be the same? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me out with this. </s>
<s> The system, in case this helps: Dell Dimension 4300 desktop (circa 2001) 1.5 GHz Pentium 4 processor 256 MB 168-Pin 133 MHz SDRAM (as one 256 stick) </s>
<s> If the computer boots with both the 256 and 512, then you can do the full GB. </s>
<s> If not then having one stick of 512 is better than having two sticks of 256 anyway. </s>
<s> It's safe and meets your needs. </s>
<s> Also you may want to try flashing your bios. </s>
<s> If you have a working floppy drive it really is no big deal. </s>
<s> It may add more functionality to the motherboard you are using. </s>
<s> Interesting thing about Dell, is that your computer varies from other computers with the same name. </s>
<s> The way Dell keeps track of what exactly is in your machine is based on the service tag. </s>
<s> You can type your service tag into Dell's website to give you detailed information about the exact parts in your computer. </s>
<s> By researching the specs of your specific motherboard you can track down any issues and problems that are known to be present in the boards as well as any fixes. </s>
<s> Have fun. </s>
