I recently installed a pcie esata card to my quad core dell running Vista home premium.
I had a WD mybook home connected via esata.
It worked immediately after install.
It worked for a week or two and now if I reboot and the card is in I get an error message: AHCI bios is not installed..this appears right after Dell splash screen.
cannot enter bios from splash screen.
If I remove the card windows boots normally.
Update: Flashed BIOS no change
