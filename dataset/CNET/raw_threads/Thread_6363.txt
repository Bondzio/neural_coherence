Though, if it doesn't work, newegg will send another one, so if you're using newegg and you're buying say a very expensive part, and you can get a refurbished for a huge difference, go for it. Roger

10358	6	111365	1266180	1265449	ozos	6/27/05 2:39 AM	1.11983994E12	i'd avoid that card	the 9800Pro won't do certain games, such as HL2 or FarCry due to it's limited SM abilities http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814145107 ^ that will beat the 9800 AND will run any game you want

10358	8	111365	1266862	1266815	AKonny47	6/27/05 10:32 AM	1.11986832E12	well, comparing those three	the 9800 pro is knocked out by both, the x800 will out perform the 6600gt, in most/all games except doom 3. check out tomshardware, they have a lot of gpu comparisons, or google it. but both the 6600gt and the x800 will do fine for bf2. i have heard about low fps for the 6600gt, but it is a demanding game. konny
