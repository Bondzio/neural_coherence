The home PC is on a workgroup and has a wired connection to the router. The work laptop is on a domain. I am able to access the internet wireless fine from my laptop. IP addresses are as follows: Wireless router: 192.168.2.1 Home PC: 192.168.2.2 Laptop: 192.168.2.3 Both the home PC and laptop can ping the router but they can't ping each other. I don't know why this is happening. 1 reason I have in my mind is that the laptop connects to the wireless connection created by the router. But the Home PC does not connect to this connection. Still my friend said that they should be able to ping each other as they are in the same subnet. Please help. Thanks.

We have firewalls (even in the router), the OS settings and a feature that has MANY NAMES. I'll give it one and leave it to you to find what your router calls it. The name is CLIENT ISOLATION. I decline to write down the other hundred names I've seen this by. But what is DIFFERENT about your post is &quot;The work laptop is on a domain.&quot; This can mean that it's on a VPN and it would be absolutely proper to not be able to ping machines that are not on the DOMAIN. Your IT staffer should explain this but it is proper. Bob
