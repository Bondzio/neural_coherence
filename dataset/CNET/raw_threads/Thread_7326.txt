I don't really mind which brand though I would think to stick with ATI. Also please find graphics cards that are under the range of about $350. Thanks! Specs Graphics Card (Not really needed) : ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series Chip Type : AMD Radeon Graphics Processor Processor : Intel Core i7-2600 CPU 3.40GHz Ram : 8.2gb

Also that link I gave with the full thing to my computer says &quot;Chassis Type : Microtower&quot; so would that be considered normal size?

Since we're inside the case every 6 months to keep it clean, it's just another thing to read while we're inside. As to the case size, it wasn't clear to me so you can take measurements to see if a full size card fits and if there is a heat issue you can always cut a big hole in the case or leave a cover off.

And im guessing this card can fit into my case and work with my computer. I was thinking of getting this card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16814130841

I get the Watts off the old supply and if it's the usual under 500 we take that number then add double the Watts the new card will draw. Reviews seem to write about 112 Watts so we double that and add that to your current PSU. Now find a PSU with a Single 12V rail unless you are adept at figuring out Amperes. Bob

4353	12	581560	5403734	5403696	R. Proffitt	12/29/12 10:53 PM	1.35682158E12	That's Watts. Now what about AMPERES?	You're also falling into the trap of the just big enough PSU. So we have a few issues to cover. Are you going to exceed any PSU RAIL? (that's in Amperes, not Watts most of the time) How old is the PSU. I ding the spec by 25% per year of age for the first 2 years. Bob
