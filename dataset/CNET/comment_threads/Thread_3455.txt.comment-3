I define &quot;backup&quot; as a scheme or plan but not as a device.
You develop the plan suitable for your own needs.
You must capture the information that is important or even critical.
You must determine what might threaten it and take precautions against these, etc.
You should also have a recovery plan.
No backup plan is any more important than is the ability to recover what is lost.
Once you've made all these decisions, then you get the appropriate hardware, software, etc.
Then you get to be diligent in using it.
My own scheme involved actual testing of the backup and recovery methods until I tuned them to meet my needs.
