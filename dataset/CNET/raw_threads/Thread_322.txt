Now most people like to choose a brand tablet because of its high quality, high end configuration, good after-sales, or just the famous brand logo. But, have you made a detailed consideration before making a decision? In my opinion, when you are choosing a tablet pc, first you need to make clear what you want from it. In other words, what do you want to to with a tablet pc? Just want a tablet pc for watching videos or reading e-book? a cheap one with simple configuration is enough. If you want a game playing pc, you have to consider its configuration, basically you need to consider its memory, CPU, screen resolution, material and type, etc. Want to surf the internet, the tablet you choose must have the 3G function. Need a tablet pc to make calls, 3G/2G function is a must have. After you know what you want from a tablet, I think you will make a wise choice. Generally speaking, tablet with more functions will be more expensive. if you don't need so many functions, why not choose a simple one with a small sum of money? For a brand tablet pc, in additon to the charm of brand itself, it usually comes with high configuration, and features many functions. All of these make it have a high performance and more attractive, expecially for those young people. However, the price is relatively pretty high. Of course, if you can afford it, the price seems to be not a problem. Freely choose your favorite not considering so much. If you can't afford an expensive brand tablet, just like me, are you still insist on a brand tablet? If I were you, the anwer is no. Considering my economic problems, i am not so interested in brand products. I like to hunt bargains online, my recent phone voto x2 and tablet pc are bought online. Maybe i am lucky, most items i bought online are of pretty good quality. At least, they worth what i paid for them. As we all know, electronics made in Chins are pretty cheap, so i always bought phone or tablet pc from some Chinese online stores. My phone above mentioned was bought from a chinese site of tinytrade. Mostly i like to buy on Amazon or ebay, because i can get more guarantee on these big B2C websites. It seems that i told too much. Just ended here!

I'm looking to buy a tablet & am trying to define my needs. There are some many deals that come through ever day in sites like Nomorerack.com that might be good enough. I usually buy on Amazon or ebay too.
