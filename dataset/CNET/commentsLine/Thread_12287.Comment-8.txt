looks way better than most to me.
i read all or almost all the reviews for the links you posted .... many showed doas and failure rates that literally scared me and many seem to lack sufficient power to support some of the more power hungry sli video cards.
unless $$ is no object i'd look a little further and repost.
so you can bump up to the one i suggested or make sure the psu you select will support the sli cards you get.
