Sometimes we find the old machine does not have a BIOS that allows one to boot from the PCI SATA card first so for those we have no real cure except to try an IDE to SATA adapter and see if the PCI SATA card has an onboard boot rom with such control.
Given such slim details I can't offer much more.
