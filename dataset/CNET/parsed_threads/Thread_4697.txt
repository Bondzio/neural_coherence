<s> I just replaced a hard drive in a compaq desktop, loaded xp home, and now dont have sound, or recognition of the wireless (on board) card that was operating prior to drive replacement. </s>
<s> Downloaded original drivers for wireless card and sound and mb.. etc, and when i go to install them, error message says that &quot;c&quot; drive has no memory, (&quot;c&quot; drive now shows as a removable drive, and the OS is on &quot;H&quot; drive). </s>
<s> only have one hard drive. </s>
<s> 1.Did I make a mistake on original installation of OS (drive/partition choice) when installing windows? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do I reinstall/format the OS and look for the &quot;C&quot; drive? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> How can I reassign where drivers are installed? </s>
<s> (tried to re-name primary drive from H to C, and windows wouldnt let me. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Is this something I can do in DOS? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for any help! </s>
<s> Rick:confused: </s>
<s> Microsoft's OS does not have the drivers for all that to work. </s>
<s> -&gt; Next time use the RESTORE MEDIA that came with the machine. </s>

<s> bob- wouldnt i have had to use the media restore from prior to new install? </s>
<s> I do have the old drive still, and an enclosure I can recover old data from the folders. </s>
<s> should I copy all drivers and try and paste into the new H drive? </s>
<s> what folders do i retrieve? </s>
<s> There is no accepted method to copy drivers from an existing windows install. </s>
<s> We can clone (copy) a drive, we can copy files but drivers have more than files with registry entries and more. </s>
<s> Its good you tried but why not clone the drive next time? </s>
<s> well, i am not a real trained whiz at this, all of what i know and do is done from trial and error.... and reading a bit. </s>
<s> Is it still possible to &quot;clone&quot; the old drive if i get it mounted in an enclosure? </s>
<s> how do i go about doing that? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The hard disk makers give away clone software. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It's widely written about on the internet. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I use G4U about once a week it seems but some run away from a free software that doesn't have a mouse interface. </s>
<s> Hi - I am assuming of course that you used your original Windows XP CD to install onto the new hard drive - the reason that you would get your OS 'seen on the H:drive' is quite possibly because you ran the installation whilst you had an external drive connected via USB to your computer during installation of Windows or you had a USB stick or card reader connected - if you have an integrated card reader, please disable it from the bios first - if you have any drives or sticks connected to USB ports, these must be disconnected as well. </s>
<s> Only have the CD drive and Hard drive connected when installing windows. </s>
<s> But you still need to re-install windows if you don't wish to clone your original hard drive. </s>
<s> A good cloning program is Paragon Drive Copy - you can get a trial version of the internet - many computer magazines offer such programs in a CD/DVD off the shelf for less than 5 - that's also an option. </s>
<s> I need to remove my post. </s>
<s> i ended up re installing xp, and paid attention to the advanced install part. </s>
<s> everything is good now. </s>
<s> thanks again! </s>
<s> thanks for all the advice. </s>
<s> i reinstalled xp again, and it worked right this time. </s>
