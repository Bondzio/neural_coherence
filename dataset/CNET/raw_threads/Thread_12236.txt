I'm not trying to go broke but looking for something solid and handy. Anyone know of any good wireless keyboard with integrated mouse?

If your L/T has a BLUETOOTH antenna built in, would suggest going that route, see if there are any Logitech units that suit your fancy they generally work very well.
