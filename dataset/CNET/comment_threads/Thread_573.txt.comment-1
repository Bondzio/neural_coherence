I have just set up a wireless network in my home and everything works great except that i lose sthe signal for my laptop on the second floor.
I have a 3com OfficeConnect Wireless 11G cable/dsl Router.
Does 3com make an signal extender for their routers?
I have emailed them but to no avail.
My house is made of solid concrete, I live in Mexico.
If they do not make that product what would be my best option for use of my laptop on the second floor?
Appreciate any help you all can provide.
