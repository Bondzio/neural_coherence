Not building it; this will be from the factory and RAM will be installed.
Perhaps one advantage of the Xeon is that I can always add another processor later on?
I also understand that equal clock speed doesn't necessarily mean equal real-life speed.
Benchnarks for almost identical Xeon and C2D processors show marked differences in programs such as Photoshop.
