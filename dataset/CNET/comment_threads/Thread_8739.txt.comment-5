If I was tasked with fixing that, I would populate the installation Apple's own routers for a test.
Having the same SSID proved to be problematic and I found some gear confused (some call that a bug!)
by this.
I moved to SSID names like ZONE1, ZONE2 etc.
and told the devices to autoconnect when needed.
Let me be clear that seamless roaming is not implemented today.
It's a wish they would do that.
