i'm getting a new computer, and use it mostly for music recording (acid or the like) and video editing (short teaching vids with sony vegas), as well as general internet use/downloading.
no gaming.
will this setup be ok?
i'm a massive user of computers but for some reason know nothing about what's inside one.
here's what i have written up by the dude who's building it: cpu - intel q8300 (2.5) ram - samsung 2g 6200 (2 of these) motherboard - asus p5q se2 vga - ati hd 4670 hdd - samsung 1tb odd - lg h22ns 30 case - able a201 power supply - aone 500w monitor - esys ex2201w some of this stuff i'm not even sure about what it is, but i do know that it's got a ton of space on the hard drive and it seems pretty fast.
so far the bill's $975 won.
does that seem about right?
i'll also be getting a nice soundcard for recording, though i'm not sure what kind just yet (any recommendations?).
by the way, i'm in seoul, korea, so that's why i'm using asian products.
i trust samsung; not sure about the other brands.
