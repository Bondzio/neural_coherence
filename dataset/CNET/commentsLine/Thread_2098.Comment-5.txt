exactly what i was thinking.
can i change the bios to read the new cpu?
if so can you tell me how?
and as to the fan thing i dont have a clue why it doesnt fit the old system was a alu block mounted to the cpu with the fan mounted to the casing.
the new systems clamps are completly different to the old.
