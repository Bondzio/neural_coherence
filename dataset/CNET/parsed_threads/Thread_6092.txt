<s> I have an iMac and will soon be buying a macbook. </s>
<s> The iMac is connected wirelessly to my Airport Extreme. </s>
<s> The macbook will be wireless as well. </s>
<s> don't feel the Time Capsule is worth buying since I already have the Airport and don't want to pay for another router. </s>
<s> Can I connect an external hard drive to the Airport and use it to backup both computers wirelessly? </s>
<s> If so, would I need to partition an external drive to back up each one separately? </s>
<s> Or are there ready-made options for backing up multiple computers wirelessly in this fashion? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> All hard disks require at least one partition and if you want more or required more this would be dictated by the backup software and optional otherwise. </s>
<s> Since you didn't share what backup software was being considered it's unlikely we can discuss this further. </s>

<s> ...for backing up and I'm horribly delinquent in getting a solution in place. </s>
<s> SuperDuper was recommended as a good backup program. </s>
<s> But I'm not sure if I need to hardwire each computer to an external drive separately or if there is a good way to take advantage of my wirelss Airport network in backing up both computers to a single backup unit. </s>
<s> It was suggested I would need to partition an external drive to backup the iMac and macbook separately on a single unit. </s>
<s> I have approx 100MB of videos, pics, tunes and documents that I need to backup. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice. </s>
<s> http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html seems to note you don't need more than one partition since it looks like you can use a folder for each backup. </s>

<s> I cannot (or would not want to) connect an external drive to my Airport and run my backups from each computer wirelessly? </s>
<s> If you insist on specific non-supported file systems on said device. </s>
<s> That is, read the airport manual as to what it supports. </s>
<s> I don't duplicate the manuals. </s>
<s> to answer questions 1 - yes your Airport extreme was made to share a USB HD 2 - no reason to partition 3 - the ready-made option = Time Machine or whatever you want to use </s>
<s> NIL </s>
