1.1.4	However the last two times I kept getting a BSOD with BAD_POOL_HEADER on the 3rd or 4th line down .	St
1.1.5	I 've been told it could be a number of different things wrong with it .	St
1.1.6	Overheating , bad mobo , faulty PSU , bad RAM etc .	St
1.1.7	I 've checked the mobo for defects and bad capictors and they all seem ok. Its had a fresh install of Windows XP pro , I did a memtest and after about 2 hours it came up with 2 errors with the RAM .	St
1.1.8	The CPU temps according to Speedfan are running at 36-43'C depending on load ( this is with the side of the case off and a small deskfan blowing inside the case ) .	St

1.2.1	Is the case cover off and the dust bunnies moved out ?	Ques
1.2.2	And with the cover off and that fan there , did it still reboot ?	Ques
1.2.3	Also , since it reboots I wonder if you can tell us the 10 or so drivers you installed after you installed XP .	St
1.2.4	It 's not unusual to find a driver that was forgotten .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	The case has been cleaned out , it has restarted on a few occasions with the side off and a fan blowing into the case .	St
1.3.2	the drivers that were installed , the CD-rom and DVD-RW drivers were installed I think , the graphics card driver , mobo driver , Wireless card driver .	St
1.3.3	Thats all I can remember ,	St
1.4.1	The chipset drivers .	St
1.4.2	Notice the first 3 drivers are all about that at http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html ? forumID=69 & threadID=271360 & messageID=2699006 # 2699006 If you can supply the make , model of the mainboard I might find these .	St
1.4.3	Also , my kids older machine continued to reboot oddly ( rarely ) for months until I figured out it was the audio driver .	St
1.4.4	You can test for that by disabling the onboard sound .	St
1.4.5	One last thing .	St
1.4.6	Did you refresh the CPU heatsink & quot ; compound & quot ; ?	Ques
1.4.7	I would .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	Where would I find the motherboard model .	St
1.5.2	The motherboard is made by Asus .	St
1.5.3	In reguards to the heatsink , I have reasons to suspect this as it was kinda dusty before I cleaned it .	St
1.5.4	I havent got any thermal paste so I cant take the heatsink off to see .	St
1.6.1	I have an AMD 64 socket 754 system and my random reboots ended when I moved some USB things off the onboard USB connections .	St
1.6.2	That was my clue a driver was n't quite right .	St
1.6.3	Oddly the PCI USB 2.0 card that I moved them to worked fine .	St
1.6.4	OK , how to identify the motherboard .	St
1.6.5	You have the visual method and you can try BELARC ADVISOR and the free version of EVEREST .	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
