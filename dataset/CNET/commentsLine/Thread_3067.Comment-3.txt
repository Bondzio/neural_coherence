and same timings, you'd be better off getting 2 dimms at 4gb each and combine those with 2 of the existing dimms.
you'd have 4gb dimms in the channel a slots and 2 gb dimms in the channel b slots....for a total of 10gb.
using 3 dimms in a dual channel system or mismatched dimms in the same channel suboptimizes system performance.
vapcmd ps...the triple channel kits can be used on the dual channel systems but they're really geared toward x58/socket 1366 mbs...otherwise you end up with leftovers/spares/or some variation of system suboptimization.
