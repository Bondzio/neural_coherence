seeing as how i am a college student, money for the whole mb/processor/ram at one time is going to take a while.
in the mean time i think i'll up the ram to 768 and save for that exotic system of the future.
on a slightly different subject, if i shoot for a future price point, $2000 would pretty much get me the best processor/mb/ram/video at any point in time right?
