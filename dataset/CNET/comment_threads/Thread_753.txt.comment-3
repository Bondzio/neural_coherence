HD won't spin, its a goner from any end user part of recovery.
Yeah, you could try this or that but more than likely its a goner.
As Robert mentions, try some data recovery service provided the data is worth it and/or depends on how much worth for the cost.
However, you can search these forums for HD help ideas, but it has been my experience any HD that can't power-ON or spin usually has gone beyond typical fixes.
However, if its the electronic PCB, swap with another exact working one and hope for the best.
