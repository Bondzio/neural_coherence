<s> am getting broad-band access in my home mainly for general email and streaming video usage. </s>
<s> I was thinking of just buying a modem and wireless router rather than renting either one ($2/mth) or both ($5/mth). </s>
<s> I have a computer that is a few years old, so everyone has told me that most likely I have a &quot;G&quot; card, but I am not sure (Dell Inspiron 600m). </s>
<s> So, then should I just get a G router, or is it worth it to get a N one, in case I ever want to upgrade my card? </s>
<s> Right now, my wireless range would only have to be 100 feet or so. </s>
<s> How are the Blinkin routers (recommended by Comcast and only $60)? </s>
<s> Does the brand matter all that much? </s>
<s> Also, I was thinking of getting a modem. </s>
<s> Staples offers some (Zoom, Linksys) compatible with Comcast, but they are all DOCSIS 2.0. </s>
<s> I heard that Comcast might upgrade to DOCSIS 3.0 in the next year. </s>
<s> In which case, will my modem become obsolete and I will have wasted my money? </s>
<s> Basically, I am trying to decide whether it is worth it to rent or buy (and if so, what equipment and will it become obsolete very quickly........). </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> You'll pay $100 to $120 for a midrange, home use router and modem so you start saving by buying your own after a couple of years. </s>
<s> However, if your rented device fails, they replace it. </s>
<s> If your owned device fails, you get to do that. </s>
<s> Personally, I'd split the ownership. </s>
<s> Let your ISP provide the modem. </s>
<s> It's going to be MAC address linked, most likely to their system and they'll set it up for you. </s>
<s> Buy your own router. </s>
<s> Go with a good brand. </s>
<s> I've always liked 3Com and US Robotics but others prefer Linksys, Dlink, etc. </s>
<s> Read some reviews and posts here about these brands. </s>
<s> You can easily enough replace your router as your needs change but let your ISP handle the modem. </s>
<s> My two cents. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
