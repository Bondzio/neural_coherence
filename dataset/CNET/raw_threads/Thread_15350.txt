I just recently had a SONY CD-ROM drive installed because mine crashed. I'm using software called &quot;Ashampoo Recording Suite 4&quot;. The program will let me burn a new CD but will not let me burn an existing CD. It wants me to select a CD writer form the drop-down list but there are none in the menu to select! What can I do to fix this?

If it was a CD/RW, how you &quot;closed&quot; it would have a lot to do with your ability to &quot;append&quot; data to it. If all you want to do is reuse it, then you will have to re-initialize and/or re-format it. Your software's help file will show you how. If you're talking about a CD with data already on it then you won't be able to write to it. It's a one-time deal. If it's something other then please provide a detailed description of the problem and what you have already tried. and life goes on... Jack
