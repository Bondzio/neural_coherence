1.1.1	I am planning on upgrading my pc , and need to know what I would need to be able to use it as a DVR , preferably with HD capability .	St
1.1.2	I have digital cable ( Comcast ) coming into the house .	St
1.1.3	The current PC configuration is OLD ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.4	and slow .	St
1.1.5	About the only thing I may be able to salvage is the keyboard and case/powersupply .	St
1.1.6	I am currently running an old ASUS motherboard with an AMD Athlon 800 mHz cpu with 512 mb ram and XP-Pro .	St
1.1.7	I have a generic 256mb graphics card with no TV reception .	St
1.1.8	I built this computer years ago as a project just to see if I could do it .	St
1.1.9	Now I want more !	St
1.1.10	I was thinking a 2gHz processor , a gig of ram , and an LCD monitor would do the trick .	St
1.1.11	I have a small 60gb hdd , and I suppose I will have to increase that too .	St
1.1.12	I would like to be able to record from the cable line ( or digital box if necessary ) onto the hard drive and then transfer to dvd , if possible .	St
1.1.13	I know a little about assembling a computer ( enough to be dangerous ) , and I 'm not afraid to try things , but I know very little about video .	St
1.1.14	Any specific suggestions on hardware would be appreciated ( i.e .	St
1.1.15	motherboard/cpu combo , video capture card , dvd recorder , etc ) .	St
1.1.16	Brezzio	St
1.2.1	Look at Hauppaugge or ATI 's capture cards since they have the necessary software as well .	St
1.3.1	if you plan on recording hd digital cable content from non-local channels .	St
1.3.2	if the channel is on a pay tier , it wo n't be in the clear ... usually , only local stations are sent in the clear .	St
1.3.3	to get the pay content you 'd need a tuner with cablecard capability and those are n't available retail .	St
1.4.1	My cable company ( Comcast ) currently supplies me with about 20-30 HD channels .	St
1.4.2	These are not pay-per-view channels .	St
1.4.3	Will I be able to record them ?	Ques
1.4.4	Is there any software/hardware available that will allow me to record them without having to rent another cable box ?	Ques
1.5.1	Check out the names I noted .	St
1.6.1	the digital tier is not 'free ' .	St
1.6.2	so you wo n't be able to record hd programs that require you to have a digital cable box .	St
1.7.1	If I run the output from the digital cable box into the video capture card , will that allow me to record the hd channels ?	Ques
1.8.1	there are no capture cards for the consumer market that have component inputs .	St
1.8.2	you 'll be stuck with s-video and that 's standard def .	St
1.9.1	Simply put , yes , you can turn your old computer into a DVR with a lot of work , and yes , you will be able to record most of your channels , but it will only be in 480i ( STDV ) or 720p ( HDTV ) depending on the channel , and you will not be able to record any channels that require a CableCARD ( i.e .	St
1.9.2	DiscoveryHD , HBO|HD , etc ) .	St
1.9.3	Basically , when you put together the system , make sure your TV Tuner card supports ASTC ( digital broadcast ) , and simply try out your channels .	St
1.9.4	Some will work , some wo n't .	St
1.9.5	I wish you luck .	Polite

1.10.1	Last minute update : if you 're willing to spend the money , grab a System Builder copy ( about $ 120 ) of Vista Home Premium .	St
1.10.2	The Media Center application is one of the best out there , with built-in ASTC ( digital ) support and DVR functionality .	St
1.10.3	Plus , it will support almost any TV tuner card out there .	St
1.10.4	( Just be sure to grab either a 32-bit copy , or a USB-based TV card , as 64-bit OSes almost never work with internal TV Tuner cards . )	St

1.11.2	untracked thread	St
