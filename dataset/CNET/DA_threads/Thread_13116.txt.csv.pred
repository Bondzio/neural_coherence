1.1.1	Hello my WRE54G is giving me problems .	St
1.1.2	Whenever I try to log into the webpage to configure it ( 192.168.1.240 ) it does not load .	St
1.1.3	I have it wired to my router ( WRT150N ) and have tried accessing it from a Windows 7 wireless connection and a Windows Vista Ethernet connection .	St
1.1.4	But both ca n't access the page .	St
1.1.5	I have tried holding the reset button for 15 seconds and still the same thing .	St
1.1.6	I was able to access it before but had to reset it for some reasons ...	St
1.1.7	Anyone with some help ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks , Tony	St
1.2.1	http : //homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/wireless/lbc/WRE54G shows this is a range expander .	St
1.2.2	To access that after a reset we have to set it to pair with our router FIRST .	St
1.2.3	This is far from automatic .	St
1.2.4	& quot ; If the wireless network is secured , you can not use the Range Expanders Auto Configuration button. & quot ; And I see if your PC is connecting to the router , you ca n't configure the range expander .	St
1.2.5	Ouch .	St
1.2.6	This one is a bit tough on owners .	St
1.2.7	I bet a lot get returned .	St
1.2.8	Try this .	St
1.2.9	Turn off the router then turn on the extender .	St
1.2.10	Now reboot the PC and see if it picks up the extender and try the setup per the instructions .	St
1.2.11	At some point you can configure the extender and tell it how to connect to the wifi router .	St
1.2.12	Bob	St
1.3.1	& quot ; Try this .	St
1.3.2	Turn off the router then turn on the extender .	St
1.3.3	Now reboot the PC and see if it picks up the extender and try the setup per the instructions .	St
1.3.4	At some point you can configure the extender and tell it how to connect to the wifi router. & quot ; The extender has a power plug and a Ethernet cable .	St
1.3.5	I might sound stupid , but I can see the extender in my wireless connections , but it fails to connect ...	St
1.3.6	If I turn off the router where do I plug the Ethernet cable into ?	Ques
1.3.7	I have been able to access it before but for some reason it stopped working and I can not access it .	St
1.3.8	I usually access it by plugging the Ethernet cord into the back of the router , then just type in the IP address .	St
1.4.1	We ca n't run ethernet and wifi at the same time .	St
1.4.2	As to explaining all this I must decline .	St
1.4.3	I offer ideas on what I would try along with references to the manual .	St
1.4.4	In the FAQ from the maker the setup should work .	St
1.4.5	If not we call it defective and ask for a refund .	St
1.4.6	It 's that simple .	St
1.4.7	If the makers ca n't get the instructions to the point we can use the products they deserve the returns .	St
1.4.8	Again , I used their FAQ and my experience to see if we could find another way to setup .	St
1.4.9	It 's possible your LAN is not on that address range but I would be guessing that .	St
1.4.10	By using wifi and no router the extender may be reachable .	St
