1.1.1	I recently changed monitors from a bigger screen to a smaller (the smaller one looks nicer).	St
1.1.2	I had to take lots of time to size it up my screen to look nice.	St
1.1.3	the problem is when i play battlefield vietnam, it doesnt have 1280 x 1024 resolution meaning i play with two big black bars across the sides of my monitor.	St
1.1.4	I dont want to make my screen fit and get rid of the black bars because when i exit out of my game my desktop resolution will make my screen all screwed up.	St
1.1.5	Is there anyway i can fix this problem.	Ques
1.2.1	I don't know what monitor you have.	St
1.2.2	For instance, an LCD would not do that, so I'm GUESSING you have a CRT.	St
1.2.3	My only GUESS is that you can try another REFRESH RATE setting for that game.	St
1.2.4	I will not know how to change that for that one game.	St
1.2.5	You may have to ask the game supplier.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Ill try talking to the battlefield people.	St
