i have ordered a printer from the online store (rx800) and they send it without the cartridges.
ive called imediatly and they lied to me for more then 2 weeks that they will send it.
(that was 2-3 mounths ago)...they didnt send it till now.. do not order directly from the site!!!!!
epson should reconsider the online store because is killing the epson name...
