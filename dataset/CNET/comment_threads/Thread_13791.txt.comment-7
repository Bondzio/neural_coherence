Yes, I reuse drive but only because I have an OS and applications image stored on an external drive.
I'm frugal to the extent that I'll squeeze the last bit of life out of any drive.
Current drive capacities are such that storage space isn't really a worry.
Smart testing and other disk checks provide warning of impending failure.
No specific reason to ditch an old drive before it shows signs of stress.
