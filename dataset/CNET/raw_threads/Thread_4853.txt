AVG virus scan,MSAS,Ad-Aware SE and Spywareblaster installed. All find nothing in a scan.My problem is the computer will just radomly reboot itself.Sometimes it reboots fine and other's it gets &quot;stuck&quot; in a constant reboot cycle. So in one of it's reboots, I hit F8 and boot up in safe mode.So far that has worked every time. I then shut down and reboot again and the computer boots up and works fine again for awhile.Sometimes for a day somtimes for a week. So far I have not been able to find out why? Don't know if it is a well hidin &quot;bug&quot; or a hardware problem? Any idea's? Thank's Rick

But my money is as the previous poster said, this is most likely due to an overtaxed power supply. If you've added any new hardware to your system, this may explain it. Also - you may have a dusty power supply and it's overheating as a result. Try a can of compressed air to blow out the dust from inside the power supply. Of course, you'll have to do this from the inside of the case. So be sure to turn off the power supply or unplug it from the wall. Then hit the start button on the computer to discharge any residual power. Then ground yourself BEFORE you remove that side panel. Otherwise you may short out that computer. Then you'll be left with an expensive paperweight.

I had a very bad experience with an overheating or intermittent router that would cause my 5 computers connected by lan or wan to crash and or reboot depending on how I had the windows error cofiguration set. To modify this setting: right click on the My Computer Icon, select properties, click on advanced, select startup and recovery, deselect automatic restart. This will at least let you look at the blue screen and see what kind of error caused your restart. The error I was getting with the bad router was Driver Fault, HTTP.sys, page fault in nonpaged area. Lots of luck. Mike
