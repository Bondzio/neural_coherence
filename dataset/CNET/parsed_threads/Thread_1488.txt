<s> I have a slightly older laptop that has XP and I'm thinking of upgrading to Vista Home Prem. </s>
<s> I ran several tests to see if my laptop is &quot;Vista Ready&quot; including the one from MS and they said my laptop passes in everything BUT the Nvidia site told me no because of the following: Mobile intel 845GM express chipset family (Intel GMA950) Video HW Transform & Lighting Required (don't have) Vertex Shader Ver Required 2.0 (my ver is 0.0) I should note that MS upgrade advisor told me it was ok to move to Vista Home prem which is what i want. </s>
<s> Based on my intel chipset specs do you think it could run Aero i/f? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=GMA+950+VISTA+AERO Sorry, I wouldn't count on it. </s>
<s> the i945gm chipset uses the gma950 and is the oldest/first intel laptop chipset that supports vista. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/products/notebook/chipsets/945GM/945GM-overview.htm if you have gma950 graphics, then you can definitely run aero. </s>
<s> if the upgrade adviser says you can run aero, then you can definitely run aero. </s>

<s> The three tests I took, NVIDIA, MS, and PCPITSTOP all told me my laptop was capable of running Vista. </s>
<s> That wasn't the problem. </s>
<s> The problem is none of them told me WHICH version of Vista I could use (except MS - see below). </s>
<s> The part I'm angling for is support for Aero. </s>
<s> In my original post that portion was given to me by NVIDIA's own Vista readiness test. </s>
<s> I think I had to install some plug in. </s>
<s> With NVIDIA being a graphics company they for sure took a hard look at my graphics chip. </s>
<s> If I interpreted their results correctly it meant to me Vista ok but just use Vista Basic. </s>
<s> MS Upgrade Advisor however I think told me I was good for Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> So I'm getting conflicting information. </s>
<s> I could of course go to the store and try it out but what if Aero doesn't work. </s>
<s> I'm stuck with a copy of OS I can't give back. </s>
<s> Finally looking at link a previous responder listed for me http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/ it states in there the WDDM model is supported with updated drivers but for a certain Vista build only. </s>
<s> Though pixel shader is supported I don't know if this is enough. </s>
<s> Pretty confused here. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> you don't have nvidia hardware in your laptop. </s>
<s> if the micrsoft ugprade advisor says you can run aero, you can run aero. </s>
<s> and i'm typing this message on a laptop based on i945gm + gma950 running aero with vista ultimate. </s>
<s> download cpu-z and gpu-z if you want to find out precisely what your laptop has. </s>
<s> http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php http://www.techpowerup.com/downloads/SysInfo/GPU-Z/ </s>
<s> Not all owners can find the drivers (for this one I go to intel.com) And a few GMA's that should do Aero (Microsoft said so in the test) failed to ever show it. </s>
<s> No one is sure why on those cases but it was early GMA hardware that likely needed a motherboard BIOS change. </s>

<s> what if Aero doesn't work Is this an academic exercise or are you spending $100 for frustration to prove that if you got it, flaunt it? </s>
<s> Lots of consumers buying laptops today would give an arm and leg to have XP on it and you are going the other direction? </s>
<s> Is MS giving a better deal for Vista to W7 upgrade than XP to W7 that I don't know about? </s>
