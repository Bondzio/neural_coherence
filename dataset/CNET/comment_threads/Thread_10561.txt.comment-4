When you start the machine there are some THINGS that happen before you load the OS/WINDOWS.
These THINGS are a function of the BIOS&gt;basic input output system.
Look at it like a machine startup pkg, not to be confused with loading an OS/WINDOWS that's the next level up.
One of the things the bios does is look to see what devices the machine has, that's the probe.
If it does not see the &quot;D&quot; drive then when you load Windows I doubt that Windows will see it either.
Unplug the &quot;C&quot; drive, power the machine on, you'll see a few screens of info appear on the monitor.
Where did it come from?
It's not from Windows, the &quot;C&quot; drive is unplugged.
That's the BIOS running.
