1.1.1	Hi Everyone Can anyone tell me when installing a hard drive I usually put the jumper to Master or Slave but there is normally another option called & quot ; CS & quot ; What does this stand for & quot ; Cabke Select & quot ; or something else and when would you use this jumper position .	St
1.1.2	Kindest Regards Tony B .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	If you use the cable select jumper position , placement of the cables connector determins whether drive is master or slave .	St
1.3.2	The 80 conductor cables use color coded connectors .	St
1.3.3	The easist thing to remember is that the master drive resides furthest from the motherboard connection .	St
1.4.1	Thanks to all who answered this question .	St
