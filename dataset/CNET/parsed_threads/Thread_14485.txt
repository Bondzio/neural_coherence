<s> Hi experts, So my system is now three years old and I do not realize the urge to upgrade anything until I get in touch with the Total War series... </s>
<s> Here is my specs: Motherboard: Asus M2N-E SLi CPU: AMD Athlon X2 Dual Core 6000+ (3.02Ghz) Memory: Kingston DDR2 4GB RAM Hard Drive: WD 500GB PSU: Corsair VX 450W OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit Graphic Card: Asus GeForce 8600GTS Without upgrading any other parts, what is the best graphic card now that I can purchase that will work properly and without bottlenecking the card? </s>
<s> I also have a friend wanting to sell me his MSI GTX460 Twin Frozr II card. </s>
<s> What minimum upgrade do I need to get the card running? </s>
<s> All replies are appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Another member settled on the 460 at http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7591_102-538859.html?tag=contentBody;threadListing It's quite a step up from the 8600. </s>
<s> The power supply is a little on the low side. </s>
<s> Be sure to cheap if the Amperes for this card can be supplied. </s>

<s> Here is an image of the amperes http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Corsair/VX_450W/images/sticker.jpg And here are the cables: Main Power : ATX 20 + 4 Pin 5.25&quot; : 6 Floppy : 2 4 Pin CPU : 1 + 2 SerialATA : 8 PCI-E Aux Power : 1x6 The next card in line on the lower end is GTS 450. </s>
<s> Will get that if it fits better with my system Thanks so much for the help! </s>
<s> http://www.guru3d.com/article/msi-geforce-gtx-460-cyclone-oc-1024-review/8 seems to peg this card to about 15 Amperes on the 12V rail. </s>
<s> Since your PSU is a Single Rail design it's probably fine. </s>
<s> Unless this machine has some odd ball setup like 7 hard disk drives. </s>
