I installed XP on the old one recently and all it did was install over all my old files which is not what I wanted. So now I want to format it because is beginning to run slowly. I have about 400-500 mp3's that I do not want to lose. I have a cd burner on the old pc but it can not burn in dvd format like my new pc. So I'm trying to figure out some way I can do this. (the cheapest way) Both computers have ethernet cards so I could connect them together. What cords would i need and could someone explain the process. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
