many thanks again, bob, for the clarification about the switched hub.
i should be able to find an inexpensive one, and complete the network without problems, due to your help.
question: is there any reason to use the d-link dir-655 wireless router in place of the befsr41 for my wired network?
i have been told over and over that using a wireless router for a wired network is ok, but wireless is more expensive.
comment: the d-link dir-655 cost me $129 while the befsr41 cost $$65.
a cheap switched hub can't cost more than $30 or $95 versus $129.
if the d-link is better, i don't mind spending $34 more for better long-term use.
thanks again for the reply, thomboy
