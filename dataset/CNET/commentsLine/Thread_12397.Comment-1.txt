my sound has gone out on my secondary pc.
it is a gateway about 4 years old using a creative labs soundblaster pci 64v.
it looks like everything is integrated on the motherboard since i see a creative chip on the motherboard and no separate soundcard when i open up the case.
can i simply install a new soundcard in one of the expansion slots to fix this?
the machine is running windows 98. thanks in advanace to anyone who can/will help.
