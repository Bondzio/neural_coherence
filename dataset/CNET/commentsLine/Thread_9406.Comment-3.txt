so it would seem that my problem has gotten worse, now my computer is crashing in some instances, it seems to be triggered by gpu usage.
some videos i open will suddenly stop and the computer freezes, then crashes.
i crashed while running a test in atitool and it also says i have high amounts of artifacting... is there anything other then buying a new card that i can do or...?
