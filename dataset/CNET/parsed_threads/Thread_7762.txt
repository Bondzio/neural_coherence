<s> Hello, I am totally new to netbooks and have only had my laptop for about 1 year. </s>
<s> I am NOT a Techinal person when it comes to computers. </s>
<s> I can't tell you what the difference between a gigabit and a megabit is. </s>
<s> LOL When I have a question I have to get my kids to come and help me! </s>
<s> It is sad I know. </s>
<s> But I am wanting to buy my kids Notebooks or netbooks for christmas. </s>
<s> I have two 15 yr old boys and an 8 yr old girl. </s>
<s> They will all get their own. </s>
<s> My question is can they use a netbook with a wireless printer to print school assignments. </s>
<s> Can I block their computer somehow so they don't get on adult websites? </s>
<s> and last question...i have a internet card for my laptop...will they be able to pickup that signal on their netbooks? </s>
<s> or will i have to go to a wireless motum? </s>
<s> they are smart as can be on computers but I do not allow them on my computer, because it is for work not their games. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> A netbook is just the same as a laptop, but it's smaller, lighter and slower, it has a keyboard that's unsuitable to type on, a screen that's too small for everyday use, it usually doesn't have a CD- or DVD-drive and it's hardly suitable to play games. </s>
<s> It's hardly imagineable somebody would buy one as their primary machine. </s>
<s> But it's nice if you go backpacking and want to check your mail, provided you can find a hotspot for the Internet access. </s>
<s> Most netbooks come with Windows XP, although you might find others with Linux or Windows 7. </s>
<s> So to answer your questions: 1. </s>
<s> Yes, you can use it with a wireless printer (provided it has a driver for the OS on the netbook). </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Yes, you can use the same parental control options as on your own laptop. </s>
<s> That's totally independent of the hardware. </s>
<s> But don't expect too much from that. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> A wireless modem/router is a very good thing to use to connect to the Internet from 2 or 3 or 4 laptops simultaneously. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Yes, you will be able to use a wireless printer for printing documents. </s>
<s> most notebooks and netbooks sold today have built in wireless capabilities. </s>
<s> no worries on setting that up, that must be found on the manual. </s>
<s> If you need information more about handling laptops go to this link: http://laptoptroubleshoot.com/ Now for blocking internet access, I totally agree with you on that. </s>
<s> Your kids should always be protected from violence in the internet. </s>
