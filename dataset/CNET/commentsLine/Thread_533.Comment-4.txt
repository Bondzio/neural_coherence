i use an asus n66u black knight 3x3 stream 450 mbps router and ea66u 3x3 access point now.
in order to get full advantage of this speed, i need a laptop with three antennas using either an intel centrino wireless-n 6300 or killer 1103. the only 3x3 mimo laptops i can find are macbook pro and alienware m17 and m18.
