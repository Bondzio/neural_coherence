[3] how upgradable is the pc you plan to buy? inlcuding how many open 'slots' [of what kind pci or pci express or pci express x16 for new graphic card - graphics being one of the technologies changing the fastest.] how many open [unused] 5.25 & 3.5 drive bays [internal & external note: externals are accessable from the outside] which not only can support additional hard drives; but, things like additional dvd, cd, multi-card reader, etc.] how many unused eide & sata connections are there for hard drives, dvd, cd, etc. this could include moving your existing hard drive as a secondary [slave] in your new pc. how many ram slots are there and how many are used? [4] is the pc vista compatable? in case you want to upgrade later to vista [e.g. vista requires a dvd drive, should have 1gb - preferable 2gbs of ram, a 64mb - preferably 128mb or better yet 256mb graphics card note: the new ati graphic cards have capability to reformat graphic formats, e.g. reformat your ipod music video so it will play on your pc or burn to cd or dvd. [5] recommend that your ram be divided evenly into two 'sticks' [e.g. 1gb ram in 2x512mbs 'sticks'.]; since, most newer processors [amd or intel] have some kind of dual processing [or 'threading'] capability that works best if each has a seperate 'stick' of ram associated with it. [6] what type of sound 'card' do you want? on-board [i.e. embeded in the mother board (mobo)] or seperate pci or pci express card? creative labs [sound blaster, audigy, x-fi, etc.] is considered the industry standard for sound, and i personnally prefer seperate sound card [i have audigy ii 24-bit cards in my 3 pcs]. also make sure that the sound 'card' has at least a 5.1 speaker connectors [also some have 7.1 or better]. what type of speakers do you have? with subwoofer? note: 5.1 stands for a center plus left & right stereo front speakers plus left & right rear surround sound speakers = '5' plus a subwoofer [i.e. the '.1'] if you don't already have a subwoofer, i would add one; since, this gives the biggest improvement in sound after stereo spreakers, in my opinion. [7] does the pc have convience of 'front panel' connectors for usb-2.0, firewire, sound [head phones, microphone, other inputs?] my creative audigy ii platnium sound cards have a module in one of my front panel extenal 5.25 drive bays with varius sound card connections. [8] what peripherals do you have [or plan to add] to your new pc and what type of connectors do they utilize [e.g. parallel, serial, usb, firewire, etc.] how many connectors does the pc have? parallel & serial ports are manily used for older peripherals [e.g. printers, scanners, cameras, etc.] before usb & firewire [ieee] became available. usb-2.0 is now usually the prefered connector [i would not buy a pc that had older usb-1.1 connectors]. firewire is used for many digital cameras and some external hard drives. how many of these ports are in the front and how many in the back? many pcs now come with 4 to 6 usb-2.0 in the back and 2 in the front, as an example. [9] relative to dvd drive, i would opt for one that has all four +/- dvd r/rw formats [also lg makes one with a fifth format as well as these four in it - dvd-ram]. also all dvd +/- r/rw drives have cd-r/rw capability as well. some higher end pcs will come with a combo [dvd-rom + cd-r/rw] drive & dvd+/-r/rw drive; so, you can read from one drive & write to the other. also you mentioned that you currently have a cd-r/rw drive. what speed is it? depending on how old your existing cd-r/rw drive is, you may find the current drives are significantly faster [e.g. 48x or 52x read speeds as an example.]; so, may want to get new drive anyway for it's faster speed. you may also see reference to 'dual-layer' capability, this means the drive can read & write to two layers on a cd or dvd [e.g. for writing (burning/ripping) this takes special disks mfg for dual write capability - that are of course more expensive than 'single' layer disks.] [10] finally, do you have a surge protector or ups [uninterupted power supply] or 'smart' ups [e.g. an ups that communicates with pc, usually via usb cable, that will automatically save your data & shut down your pc in prolonged power outage.] note: surge protector only takes the 'spikes'/'surges' out of incoming power. most ups will also increase low power [e.g. 'brown-outs'] to even the flow of power to your pc and protect the various 'chips' in it. i personnaly have apc smart ups on my pcs and surge protectors on my phone lines [to all my phones as well the one connected to the pc] my satellite cable connection and all my tv & stereo equipment. also please note that power surges follow least resistant path to ground; and telephone, cable, dsl & satellite lines are all susceptable! so anything connected/'wired' to your pc can carry an unwanted surge [e.g. if monitor, speakers and/or printer, or other peripherals are plugged into wall or phone line, etc. and not into a surge protector/ups first; then they can carry a surge to your pc via its connecting [e.g. usb?] cable; even if the pc itself is protected. hope this helps and is not too confusing or overwhelming...bwh

13790	44	188979	2071053	2049119	brandon eng	7/14/06 9:13 pm	1.15291158e12	no need to spend more than $500 for your needs	your needs seem pretty simple, and retail desktops have really dropped in price. i would highly reccomend an hp/compaq or a gateway. i build my own desktops, but have laptops built by both above named companies, and can vouch for their excellent tech support. since you don't play demanding games, i'm sure you'd do well with an onboard video chip. same for sound- onboard sound has come a long way, and you'd be surprised at the quality you get nowadays. so as far as hardware, that pretty much leaves the hardrive- depending on the model, you're bound to get a hardrive at least 100 gig or more. that leave a burner; most retail sellers will include a dual layer burner. no matter what brand you buy, i'd suggest getting a pc (assuming you're getting a pc- sounds like a mini-mac would suit your needs also) with a 64 bit chip so you wont get left behind when 64 bit applications become more available. you should be able to get a pc in the $500 or less range that should suit your needs. i don't often see gateway desktops, but e-machines are cheap and pretty reliable; i believe e-machines was purchased by gateway; however, i don't think you'll get the same quality tech support as you would with a gateway- i know this only from what i've read, not from personal experience. my brother in law bought an hp with an amd 64 bit chip for less than $600 (which included a 19&quot; lcd monitor) more than a year ago, and he's very happy with it. it normally retailed for well over $1200, but he bought it when there was some kind of super sale at circuitcity. that particular model may have been discontinued, but i still peruse the sunday flyers just to look, and there's always sales. he's very happy with their tech support, and recently, when he was having trouble with the dual-layer burner, tech support troubleshot the problem with him and it was determined that he needed a new one which was sent to him in 2 days. i have an hp laptop, and can definitely say their tech support is top notch. luckily, i haven't had to have any hardware replaced. one last thing: don't buy a dell. since you already have the monitor, i see no reason why you shouldn't be able to get a desktop with a 64 bit chip, a gig of ram, and a hardrive at least 100 gigs big. you want to purchase an extended warranty from either the manufacturer or the store you buy the unit from. happy hunting, and good luck.
