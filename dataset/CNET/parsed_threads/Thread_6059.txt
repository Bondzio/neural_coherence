<s> Hello, I'm wondering what some of you would do in this situation... Ok I need a new Graphics Card and I was about ready to buy a Radeon 9800Pro for $200 from MSI, but the new GeForce 6800 (not ultra and not GT just 6800) costs $275 and will outperform that 9800pro but 2x in most cases. </s>
<s> Now would you either buy that 9800Pro or would you save that extra $75 and go for that 6800 from eVGA? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> This is one of those areas that you have to look at your application. </s>
<s> A gamer may opt for that lastest card. </s>

<s> ok, well for me the application is games, but I also want it to last for at least 14 months, so that is the agrguement in favor for the 6800, it supports all of the latest technologies, and its faster. </s>
<s> But the 9800Pro still can come in costing less and performing very well at various games. </s>
<s> Do you think that the GeForce 6800 in 14 months will be the same as a GeForce FX 5800 is today, still performing great but basicly phased out? </s>
<s> any ideas on how long it should be considered top range? </s>
<s> (I ask that because I don't want to be buying a new $200-300 part every 8 months) </s>
<s> Did your last card last 14 months? </s>
<s> If not, why didn't you get that much out of it? </s>
<s> As to the card being the top of the range, once you get near the top, the top position can be a tenuous thing since a better video driver could cause the number 2 card to move ahead. </s>
<s> If you are in the top 10, then you can run any game offered today. </s>
