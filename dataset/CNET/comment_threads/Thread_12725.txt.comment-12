I tried earlier plugging my laptop directly into the router and attempting to update the firmware.
I downloaded the latest version 2.24 and when I attempted to open the file on the router page to load the new firmware version, it didn't work and told me that the version I was attempting to upload may be corrupt and that the gateway would not be updated.
I will attempt to change the SSID to something more simple.
