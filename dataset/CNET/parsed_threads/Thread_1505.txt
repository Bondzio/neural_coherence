<s> I wasted the last few months with a brother mfc-240c its going to the trash i wouldnt even give it to my worst enemy but i digress. </s>
<s> can someone recomend a printer that would be able to handle different types of paper with out jamming or not feeding? </s>
<s> I'll spend the necessary amount of money this time. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help. </s>
<s> Epson and Canon. </s>
<s> Zero problems. </s>
<s> My latest i455 is nice. </s>
<s> I have researched this very subject for 3 months. </s>
<s> I want a duplex laser however, I found the inkject printer to be superior for this type of printing. </s>
<s> I have concluded that the HP Officejet Pro K850dn or K550dtn. </s>
<s> Both have fast and crisp 2-sided printing, both can be used with a network. </s>
<s> Go to shopping.hp.com for further information regarding paper sizes. </s>
<s> Check Amazon.com and Tigerdirect.com for competitive prices. </s>
<s> Check out the HP 1600/2600 series. </s>
<s> I took the 2600tn and love it. </s>
<s> Printing 50 full color/photo flyers is quick, easy and cheap on toner. </s>
<s> The series has optional duplexers, input trays, output trays, hard drives, RAM, NIC, trully customizable. </s>
<s> Hi, if you want photo print quality, you need a hi-res colour inkjet - I'd recommend Epson or Canon - I have an Epson R200 - superb printer. </s>
<s> For flyers, business cards, etc., I'd suggest a low end colour laser, the quality will be just fine and the consumables are way cheaper. </s>
<s> I'd suggest a model from the HP 2600 or 3500 series. </s>
<s> Lasers are better suited to duplex printing, IMHO. </s>
<s> Both these series have a duty cycle appropriate to Small Office / Home use. </s>
<s> The only snag is they are a bit bulky and they weren't designer to handle heavy business duty cycles. </s>
<s> You really don't want to be printing business cards and newsletters with any water based ink jets - they may look OK, but the ink runs and smears. </s>
<s> I purchased a Dell 3100cn (color laser) about a year ago. </s>
<s> Duplex is available although optional. </s>
<s> This printer has been jam free, does a high-quality for both photos and type, and as economical as it gets. </s>
<s> I've duplex everything from vellum to card stock with no problems. </s>
<s> I've worked with the HP color lasers and Xerox during the last few years and find the Dell to be superior for the photos and as good as or better on text. </s>
<s> I have been using a Oki color laser, doing cards flyers ect. </s>
<s> for our local bowling club, table tops and other small print items. </s>
<s> Been very happy with it but its time to get a new one. </s>
<s> Any one out there using paper plus card material, and gloss paper. </s>
<s> want good quallity print, . </s>
