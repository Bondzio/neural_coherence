Here's the situation.
Our historical society is publishing a photo-oriented history book using photos from individual's private -- and often family -- collection.
What I am looking for is a high quality scanner that I can reasonably pack up and take to the contributor's home where I can scan the photos on site.
Specs required for scans: 300 dpi Output size: at least 8 inches wide or 16 inches wide for a double spread.
Color Mode: grayscale (8-bit) Recommendations?
Thanks S
