xp was suppose to be out of the picture by now but vista still has issues and thus being offered.
if you want vista, get it, if not and far more stable use xp.
as for the dual optical drive, you can always add that later, even vista should you need to provided you went with the xp system.
the difference isn't that great and imho, you'll be more happy with xp based system.
dell, is also having some problems with vista itself for whatever reason as least it seems so.
