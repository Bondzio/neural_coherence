<s> I need to know what i need to have to be able to install a second CPU. </s>
<s> -Your new CPU should be the same socket as the last one -Buy some Thermal Grease -Make sure you have a fitting heatsink and cooling is efficent -It should be compatible with your motherboard, a few Dual Cores, I hear, are not 100% compatible with old motherboards but can be, usually, fixed with a BIOS fix/update/patch. </s>
<s> -Be careful, don't break any pins on the CPU Here is an OK guide, just a basis. </s>
<s> I'm trying to find a better one: http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/tutorials/109/10/ ~Ibrahim~ </s>

<s> If you want to add a cpu to your existing you'll need a server type motherboard like a Tyan Thunder. </s>
<s> I plan on adding a second Cpu </s>
<s> Well, then he is right. </s>
<s> Just wondering: Is this for a server or something? </s>
<s> Because I've only seen one setup with more than 1 physical CPU, and its a server running four Xeon's at 3.0GHz which is alot of processing power. </s>
<s> If you want power, and save a butload of money, just upgrade this one. </s>
<s> In todays Programs and Applications it is almost always overkill to add a whole new Processor, and the money is big, I mean new motherboard, new CPU, it adds up. </s>
