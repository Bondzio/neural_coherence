I'm recently subscribed to Verizon DSL, and am attempting to network my 2 computers (a desktop and a Laptop.
I ran the home networking wizard in windows on both computers, and correctly installed the Westell Versalink router I received from Verizon, but when I try to send something from my laptop to my printer (connected to desktop), I get a printer not responding error message.
I am running Windows ME on the desktop, and XP on the laptop if that matters.
HELP!!!
!
