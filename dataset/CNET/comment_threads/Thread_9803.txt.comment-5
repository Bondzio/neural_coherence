It's unlikely to take damage (we can watch the tomshardware video) but random reboots are often traced back to aging or overtaxed power supplies (did you tell what you used?)
or a failed memory stick.
Here's a test I use -&gt; http://www.memtest86.com The only good result is zero errors regardless how long you run it.
