<s> Im not sure that my title is clear or not, so here is my question: I just moved to a new apartment, and after a quick WLAN search on my laptop, I found out that I have a few open & free Wireless LANs in my neighborhood (YAY! </s>
<s> :D). </s>
<s> So currently, I access internet on my laptop and cell phone using these networks. </s>
<s> Now, I want to kind of expand my home wireless network using the access point feature on one of these wireless routers (Cisco-Linksys WRT54G2 or Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL). </s>
<s> Here is how: I want to have internet on my Belkin Desktop Skype Phone. </s>
<s> It has an Ethernet port on it, and I am going to connect it to the router. </s>
<s> I want to connect my Western Digital WD TV Live to both internet and my laptop. </s>
<s> Again, it has an Ethernet port on it, so I want to connect it to my router using a RJ45 cable. </s>
<s> Moreover, by using the access point feature on the router I want to access internet, and I also want to stream video files from my laptop (which will be connected to router wirelessly as well). </s>
<s> Lastly, will I be able to use my printer from my laptop (it has wireless capability)? </s>
<s> Im pretty sure that I can do that anyway I am not so familiar with wireless routers and networking, so is it doable? </s>
<s> Id appreciate your help </s>
<s> To people who might think I'm stealing (! </s>
<s> ): (1) I asked my next door neighbor and he said it's OK if I use his wireless connection! </s>
<s> Plus, (2) I don't do hard-core downloading or video streaming or anything!!! </s>
<s> I only check my emails and make Skype phone calls! </s>
<s> Also, (3) according to state law it's not stealing if the network is not locked! </s>
<s> One more question: Which router do you recommend for this matter? </s>
<s> But such a setup would tax most users. </s>
<s> So my answer is if you can't then no. </s>
<s> If you could you'll do that. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> And NO to the printer over wifi in such a setup. </s>
<s> Just use USB. </s>
<s> And while wifi printing may be possible where would you find support for such a cranky setup? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ... you are using other peoples' open[i.e. </s>
<s> unsecured] Network .... have you thought about security ? </s>
