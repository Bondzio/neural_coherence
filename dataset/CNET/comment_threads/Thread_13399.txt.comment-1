Hello!
I have a 2Ghz celeron, XP, and an audigy sound card... now for some reason, its making a popping sound whenever i try to play a CD or a DVD, yet a mere 3 weeks ago, when i installed the card, it was playing back perfectly fine.
all other sound is fine, it only 'pops' when i have a CD/DVD in the drive, so i know theres nothing wrong with the speakers.
i was wondering if any of you nice clever people knew what i have to change/hit hard, to sort my problem out!?
greatly appreciated!!
!
