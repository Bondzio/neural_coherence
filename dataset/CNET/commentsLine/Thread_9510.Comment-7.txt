when the p4 home built unit failed and the printer and scanner on the parellel port were not up to par for any other pcs, i dug up an old wired router that supported a parellel port and added it to the wan port on the wifi router with a cat5e cable.
the other wired ports helped fill an overflow on the wifi wired ports, like the dtv sat box and a server behind a firewall.
a $20.
investment originally.
but sidelined for the wifi.
now reclaimed for duty.
