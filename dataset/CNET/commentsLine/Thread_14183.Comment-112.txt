the first computer i bought was in 1986, it was a commadore 128 which ran cp/m, c64, and c128 programs and i paid about $1000 for it plus a color monitor.
in 1987 i bought my first amiga, a 500 also for about $1000 with monitor and in 1989 (or was it 90) i splurged and bought an amiga 4000 with a 68040 chip, 2 megs of chip ram and 8 megabite memory card with multi sync monitor for about $2500.
i still use it its right next to the cheap pc clone i'm writing thir on.
