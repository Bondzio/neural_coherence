well, i've seen a few sites that showed benchmarks stating that the card's max power consumption is under 20w... which makes sense... if the video cards requires a full 400 watts, then what's left to power the rest of the computer?
i tried the wattage calculator on newegg and said that with the systems specs and that card, total min would be 248w which... kinda pushing it since likely dell's 275w power supply isn't really 275w.
well... guy never replied back for the computer anyway, and found another dell with a 305w power supply, same system but the mid-tower and read where a few people have installed similar cards without problems.
url examples.
