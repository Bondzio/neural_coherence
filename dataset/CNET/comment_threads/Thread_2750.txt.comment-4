It would be the 1st step, however as always, its a logical procedure should it not be the problem.
The other candidates are weak psu and/or mtrbd., also possible bad ram.
Reseat the ram and/or use less if more than 1 stick present.
Also, are there any beep sequence or error message, maybe a beeping sequence then?
If not, then the cpu again.
Good luck -----Willy
