<s> The PC I am using now is using windows xp service edition two, and is running fine but i also have another pc i dont use. </s>
<s> i was wondering if there was anyway i can connect the two to give more memory and make my current pc run better than it is now. </s>
<s> im looking for more memory and maybe a faster pc. </s>
<s> if anyone could help that would be great. </s>
<s> you can't make the other pos faster. </s>
<s> You could make it server and client, but that would just be a waste of money and time. </s>

<s> A motherboard doesn't have options for hooking up other boards to it. </s>
<s> However, if you really know your electronics, it could be a slim possibility. </s>
<s> I had the same dilemma a few days back, didnt know what to do with my old pc, no one wanted it for free. </s>
<s> Did some research spoke to some techs, was adviced on buying an enclosure kit which would allow me to use my old hard drives as files/media back up & my DVDROM/CDRW cud be used to copy media onto my new DVDRW in the same kit. </s>
<s> I had one slot for memory empty on my new pc so I pushed in the old one on the other slot. </s>
<s> Looking forward to donate the motherboard, Nvidia Ti Geforce 64MB & P4 processor. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
