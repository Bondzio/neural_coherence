<s> I have 3 computers on my home network. </s>
<s> However, one of them, a laptop, cannot get onto the network. </s>
<s> I have 1 desktop, connected straight to the router, and 2 wireless laptops. </s>
<s> One of the laptops has no problem accessing the network. </s>
<s> The other one though, cannot recognize it though. </s>
<s> Still though, the laptop that cannot recognize the network still can access the internet wirelessly. </s>
<s> I don't how that happens if it cannot access the network. </s>
<s> When I go into My Network Places and go to View Workgroup Computers, only 2 of the computers show up. </s>
<s> That one laptop does not. </s>
<s> Therefore, I cannot print wirelessly or do anything like that with that one laptop. </s>
<s> So does anyone know how I can fix this problem? </s>
<s> By the way, I am using a workgroup, not a domain. </s>
<s> And the name of my workgroup is MSHOME. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> an extra layer network tweaking to get simple file sharing to work. </s>
<s> Other issues can be firewalls not properly set to allow LAN traffic, or simply not enabling file and print sharing. </s>
