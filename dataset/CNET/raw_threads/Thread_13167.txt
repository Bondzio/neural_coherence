My friend bought me a wireless router as a Christmas present, and I set it up in my house so everyone in the household can get access to the internet anywhere in the house. But since my son can access the internet anywhere in the house, I want to monitor what sites he had been to. Please help me on that issue

Proffitt	1/2/05 3:45 PM	1.1046807E12	No. But try these...	&quot;&gt;How we will programmatically get the information of the Bandwidth of &gt;an access point. &gt;Otherwards how we will keep track of the bandwidth strength of an &gt;access point. If the access point supports SNMP, then MRTG, RRDTool, or a wide variety of SNMP based utilities will draw nice looking graphs. http://www.mrtg.org http://www.rrdtool.org However, if your access point does not support SNMP, then you can build a scripting tool that will extract the same information from a web page. For example, this Java program will extract the numbers from a WGT624. As always, it would be nice to know what you are trying to accomplish and what you have to work with. -- Jeff Liebermann &quot;

(I don't konw if my router supports SNMP or not) I went to both website that you told me and download the software from that site, but I have absolutely no idea how to work them out (since there is not a single EXE file within the archive). All I wanted to do was to monitor what sites that my son had gone to. Thank You!

Proffitt	1/5/05 5:37 AM	1.10490342E12	Yes, your router/wap did do SNMP, but no click here solution	As you can tell, no ready to use application is ready for your make/model. Since this is true, then you have to use the noted software I linked to. If you were looking for a &quot;click here to use&quot; application, I didn't find it. However I have seen MTRG working and it would satisfy your question. Bob
