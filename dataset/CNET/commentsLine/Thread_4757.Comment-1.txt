i have 2 separate dsl lines the original phone line is capable of dsl and phone usage, the second is a dedicated dsl line.
both lines are connected to two seperate 2 wires... i have 2 computers connected to the first line and a wii, xbox 360 connected to the 2nd line.. my question is every since i got the second line i have drops in connection alot, are these two lines interfering with each other?
i can only access one of the routers configuration page, if i try to access the other from another computer i have to shut the other 2 wire off... any insight into this matter would be greatly appreciated... thank you
