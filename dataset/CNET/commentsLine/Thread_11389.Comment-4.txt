anyone know for sure how to disable a faulty usb port i have two and one blew a while ago been having trouble with visuals recently and suspected a cracked wire or something but today os (i assume) threw up a message that a third port was not working either this is spy ware or the port is causing problems went in to device manager and found enhanced usb controller running on 24cd usb controller running on 24c2 usb controller running on 24c4 usb controller running on 24c7 usb root hub usb root hub usb root hub usb root hub have looked at this before and always wondered about 4 root hubs when only have two ports the error message showed two extra ports in yellow with warning usb root hub usb root hub usb root hub warning usb root hub warning usb root hub usb root hub and i was advised to either click no and disable device or click yes to reset i clicked yes to reset and then went into device manager and disabled managers one and two i now have enhanced usb controller running on 24cd usb controller running on 24c2 disabled usb controller running on 24c4 disabled usb controller running on 24c7 usb root hub usb root hub when put my stick in i get enhanced usb controller running on 24cd usb controller running on 24c2 usb controller running on 24c4 usb controller running on 24c7 usb mass storage device (which seems to be working fine by the way) usb root hub usb root hub anyone know if this is viable solution to problem or have i just cut available memory in two or something?
why are there two controllers or even three controllers for 4 ports when there are only two and why did the port not show as faulty - it blows pc should one be dumb enough to put in stick or device and takes a full 10 mins to calm down - but wondered if broken port was draining energy etc thanks for any input
