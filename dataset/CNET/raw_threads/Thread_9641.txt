No product I've purchased has fulfilled this question. I have however revceived sage advice over a meal that I've paid for and that was worth more than the pennies I paid. Bob

One's a G5 and one's a G4, etc. Might be better to compare an iMac with an eMac or an iBook with a Powerbook. But even then, you get what you pay for. More or less.
