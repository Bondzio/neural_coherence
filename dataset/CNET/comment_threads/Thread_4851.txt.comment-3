My network works great, as far as the laptop connecting to the internet.
But I would like some input on setting up file sharing, as well as printing from the wireless laptop.
The PC is hard-wired to the modem and router (D-LINK WBR-2310).
The printer is connected to the PC.
The PC is running Windows XP.
The laptop is running Vista.
The printer is a Canon PIXMA MP450.
Thanks.
