&quot;Motherboard Intel CPU P4 1700Ghz RAM 256+256 External Hard drive is connected throw USB port When I unplug the External HD it restarts normally&quot; While interesting, it didn't tell exactly where the USB port is, or the make/model of the motherboard and if the BIOS was up to date.
You may want to either become more familiar with what you have or just make this a warranty issue with the machine's supplier.
