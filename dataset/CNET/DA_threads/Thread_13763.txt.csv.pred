1.1.1	I'm replacing my old sound card.	St
1.1.2	I just bought a set of Logitech Z-5500 THX speakers.	St
1.1.3	http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/speakers_audio/home_pc_speakers/devices/224&cl=US,EN I almost bought this card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16829102005&nm_mc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel&cm_mmc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel-_-Content-_-text-_-N82E16829102005 but I found out I couldn't make a direct digital connection to the speaker systewm via optical or digital coax.	St
1.1.4	So I'm seriously considering getting this card http://www.auzentech.com/site/products/x-fi_prelude.php I have seen some reviews where people had problems with crackling popping etc if they use a mobo with an Nvidia chipset.	St
1.1.5	http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=29-156-005&SortField=0&SummaryType=0&Pagesize=10&SelectedRating=-1&PurchaseMark=&VideoOnlyMark=False&VendorMark=&Page=1&Keywords=nvidia Here's what it says on Auzentech's site &quot;Q: Why do I hear cracking and popping in the audio?	St
1.1.6	A: Apparently this problem can affect a portion of users using soundcards based on the X-Fi chipset in computers that include NVIDIA hardware.	St
1.1.7	Below is a quote from NVIDIA: Creative and NVIDIA have been investigating reports of performance issues in some systems that have NVIDIA components as well as Creative's Sound Blaster X-Fi soundcard installed.	St
1.1.8	There were complex, bandwidth-related issues involving memory allocation that made isolation of the issue and subsequent resolution time consuming and difficult.	St
1.1.9	After thorough QA and testing, NVIDIA released a BIOS update for motherboards designed by NVIDIA and based on the NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCP, which has resolved such issues.	St
1.1.10	For any X-Fi owners using these motherboards but are still experiencing issues, we advise you to contact your motherboard manufacturer regarding the availability of an updated bios.&quot; I am using an ASrock 939 dual sata2 mobo http://www.asrock.com/mb/overview.asp?Model=939Dual-SATA2&s=939 which has the ULi 1695 chipset (ULi M1695/ ULi M1567) .	St
1.1.11	Anyone think there would be any problems using this sound card with my mobo?	St
1.1.12	I'm running XP SP2 Thanks	St
1.2.1	ok so I got on my computer one day and I couldn't listen to music.	St
1.2.2	I went control panel, then to sound and audio devices, and where it used to say the sound card I have, it just says no audio devices.	St
1.2.3	I know I have a sound card, but I think my sound card might have come loose or something when I was messing with my computer.	St
1.2.4	I have no idea how to check or anything.	St
1.2.5	Can someone please help me to figure out how to get my sound card to work?	Ques
1.2.6	thanks	Polite
1.3.1	http://us.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=209&subcategory=669&product=15854&nav=1 Connectivity Speaker and Headphone connections for stereo to 7.1 (Line Out via three 3.5mm mini jacks) Line In / Microphone In / Digital Out* / Digital I/O** (shared 3.5mm FlexiJack) Auxiliary Line level Input (via 4-pin Molex connector) I/O Console connector (for optional upgrade) * Digital Out supports stereo SPDIF out and pass through of multichannel DVD sound ** Digital I/O requires Sound Blaster Digital I/O Module (Sold Separately) Digital Out is standard.	St
1.3.2	Digital In/Out requires the i/o module.	St
1.3.3	Your older mobo won't suffer from the x-fi/nvidia 600 chipset issue (which has been corrected for over a year).	St
1.3.4	vista 32bit x-fi drivers are also stable but 64bit drivers may still be problematic.	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the info on the Nvidia chipset.	St
1.4.2	For the digital out, yes I saw I could buy an extra module to obtain optical or coax out, but I would prefer a direct optical connection to my z-5500 speakers.	St
1.4.3	Thanks	Polite
