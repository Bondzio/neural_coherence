1.1.1	Hi!	St
1.1.2	Got a USB lamp (for night flights etc...) and when plugging it into my Dell D600 running XP Pro, I only get the message &quot;Power Surge on SUB - reset the chip after removing the device&quot;...	St
1.1.3	I still would like to use that lamp.	St
1.1.4	Any ideas how?	St
1.1.5	Thanks Chris	Polite
1.2.1	Deeply discussed at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=52185&messageID=622109 I will only note that if there is a patch, Dell has it.	St
