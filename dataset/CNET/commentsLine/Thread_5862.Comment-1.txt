i'm currently using a d-link 802.11g/2.4ghz wireless router to link my modem to my computer system as well as my xbox gaming system to the internet.
currently i'm not using any wireless features, just the 4 wired ports on the back.
randomly the router disconnects and reconnects to the internet for no reason.
this problem never happened while i was only using the modem.
so i'm just wondering if anyone has any sujestions?
