have had a external 1t wd i use for backup for about 3 years.
have run tests on it about every 3 months.
everything passed.
the last two times it shows random seek test and funnel seek test failed.
when i run ckdsk on it, it will go for about 3 hours and says test can't be completed and locks up where i have to reboot it before windows can see it again.
i assume this drive is about ready to crap out on me or is there something else i could look at.
external drives are pretty cheap right now so is it even worth messing around with the old one?.
thanks wayne
