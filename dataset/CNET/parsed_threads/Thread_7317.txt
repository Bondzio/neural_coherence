<s> Recently I've turned off my psu and unplugged my computer then replugged it from moving. </s>
<s> But then from then on, my computer would go straight into the BIOS setup seconds after I turned on my computer. </s>
<s> So then I would save setting and exit my bios setup after checking all setting were correct. </s>
<s> But after this, my computer would just go to a blank black screen and freeze and wouldn't boot into windows. </s>
<s> I would restart, but it would do nothing forcing me to force shut down my computer. </s>
<s> Then I would turn it on again, same thing happens. </s>
<s> Because it goes into the BIOS setup in seconds after turning it on, I cannot prompt it to go to safe mode or anything. </s>
<s> My computer has been like this for weeks. </s>
<s> I've also check my boot settings as it boots first from my hard drive and then my dvd rom. </s>
<s> I've also switched this around with no luck. </s>
<s> I've tried to have it boot from my DVD-rom so I can try reformatting it. </s>
<s> But still it jumps straight into the BIOS setup. </s>
<s> Any one got suggestions to fix this? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> computer boots to bios Several options there, it sounds like a hardware problem. </s>
<s> What do you by chance mean? </s>
<s> You shifted the computer to a new location? </s>
<s> If so, sounds like loose cable somewhere internally, either on your harddisk side or motherboard size. </s>
<s> Check all cables internally are connected securely which could have came off while moving, else, it seems quite bad news to me regarding your harddisk. </s>
<s> In your bios, is your motherboard able to detect the harddisk? </s>
<s> If no, your harddisk may have it's cable loose, or worst, damaged. </s>
<s> If yes, your partition may have crashed big. </s>
<s> If you can remove the harddisk, test it on another system as an external or something to see you can save off important files before doing anything else. </s>
<s> Are you able to hear whether the harddisk is making some spinning noise? </s>
<s> If it doesn't, there's possibility the powerline supplyiing the harddisk has failed, thus need to switch to another powerline. </s>
