<s> I have a compaq presario, running windows ME that we purchased either late 90's or early 2000 that recently when booting up will not boot up. </s>
<s> For awhile it would only get to a black screen with the cursor blinking and then after a while change to a bright display, and you could hear clicking coming from the hard drive area. </s>
<s> Now after turning it on I receive msg 1720-hard drive detects imminent failure. </s>
<s> On this same screen at the bottom a box with f1 boot option and in another box f10 computer setup. </s>
<s> Are there any options available to get the system up one last time in order to get some family photos that were not backed up off??? </s>
<s> Or is it time to lay this one to rest? </s>
<s> Would even consider taking to professsional service, Geek squad?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I put in the new drive, install the OS, drivers and all that then add the old drive as slave to copy out the photos. </s>
<s> I never try to repair the old drive filesystem and get it booting at this point. </s>
<s> It's time to save the files. </s>

<s> Sounds like the CPU has FAILED.. </s>
<s> I would get a new PC or LapTop.. also ME for LapTops I think is no longer covered by Microsoft.. .. </s>
<s> I would make a new purchase. </s>
