Today I left my computer on when I went to school.
We are trying to sell our house and had a showing, so my mom yanks the power cord out of the wall to hide it.
Now, my secondary internal 1 TB drive doesn't show up anywhere.
Not in my computer.
Not in Device Manager.
It is just gone.
It was working perfectly until this happened.
Please help.
I need the data on this hard drive.
Computer is a widows 7 desktop.
