The drives are a double layer 16X multi format I use for CD and DVD writing and 16X DVD drive. I have a Pentium D Processor 820, a gig of memory and a 250 gig hard drive. My problem is that I installed iTunes (which I have been using for a while on another PC) and have had no problems (I authorized this PC) until I tried to burn a CD/R. Itunes tells me &quot;disc burner or sofware not found&quot;. I have spent hours on the Apple support site. I have uninstalled and reinstalled iTunes (Version 5) to no avail. I can insert an audio CD and iTunes recognizes it and plays the tracks but I cannot figure out how to make iTunes find the CD drive when I want to burn a CD. Seeing I do not have an iPod, I use CDs to through in the car. If anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate it. Joe

There are lots of folks with this issue. If you can install ver 4.9 it would probably work.

I have run this a couple of times and the results indicate that the NEC drive is there and lists the contents of the CD I have in the drive. Needless to say, I am a little frustrated with Apple's support on their &quot;free&quot; iTunes product.

I have searched for version 4.9 but the couple of links I have found to this version have been &quot;disabled&quot; with the message that posting the earlier version violates Apple's software terms and conditions or some such &quot;anti user&quot; tripe. I appreciate your reply and information but I think I (and others) may need to ride this out until Apple releases a new version correcting such problems without admitting they exist.
