I am looking for a new pc.
I have been researching and found that SEVERAL people are having problems with live tv freezing, or locking up their system.
No one seems to know what the root cause is.
some theories are the duel core processor, the tuner and an AMD processor.
The list goes on.
Are there new pc's that have a tv tuner that does not lock up.
Thank you for your help.
