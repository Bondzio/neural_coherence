I would like it to have the following: approximately 10&quot; display solid state harddrive Wireless G at least 1 GB of memory, maybe 2 depending on price metal chassis Distro of linux installed so I don't have to pay for Windows/office (I already have some experience with Ubuntu and Suse...&quot; Also, the larger the keyboard the better... Any suggestions would be appreciated. I've tried looking for several hours and haven't found anything that appeals to me. Also, I'm not in a terrible rush so if there's something that may be coming out in the near future I can wait. Thanks

Acer will roll out the 10.1 inch any day now and it's all of 350 on Amazon.com You can install Open Office and you're done. My Acer netbook is very nice and I'd buy that again. Who has a metal chassis? Bob

Also, this netbook will be in my bookbag, so it may get jarred a bit. If I have a standard HD I won't have to worry so much about scrambled data.

That little Asus Eee seems to be pretty tough, here's a torture test. http://asuseeehacks.blogspot.com/2008/02/asus-eee-pc-torture-test-french-video.html How is the keyboard on your Acer and how long do you typically use it in a session? What about compared to a full sized keyboard?
