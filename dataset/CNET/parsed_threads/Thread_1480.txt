<s> Hi, I installed a Network card on a PC with windows ME. </s>
<s> Earlier the same card was installed on a windows 2000 pc. </s>
<s> Now, when i have connected the PC to the network, i was able to see the LAN status icon in windows 2000. </s>
<s> There was a option to activate it in windows 2000 too through network properties. </s>
<s> I not able to see this status icon in windows ME even am using the same NIC card. </s>
<s> I was not able to find any option too like windows 2k to turn it on. </s>
<s> Please help me as how to display this network status icon on windows ME </s>
<s> and not having ME in front of me, I would say the option is on the Properties page of your Local Area Connections of your NIC. </s>
<s> From what i learnt after seaches and searches on google, and other persons on different forum too, is that this feature is NOT avaiable in windows ME. </s>
<s> But, now to moniter network status you can use another free network status monitering tool like Netgraph http://www.snapfiles.com/get/netgraph.html Its a neat and free program... </s>
<s> I am using it and works great for me. </s>
<s> Thanks to a person on annoyances who helped me. </s>
