the problem is not that imoviehd is a &quot;free&quot; program or that the video is in the wrong format or even that final cut express is required.
the problem is that the poster has, is themselves!
quote &quot;i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire.&quot; unquote this poster, apparently, has been trying to upload video from his camera by creating a method of his own.
i thought usb but this camera does not have usb, that i can see, and the macbook does not have s-video input.
the manual covers connecting with an ieee1394 cable but the cable is an optional extra.
i think a little more information is needed as to how the poster was attempting to upload video.
right now, i would say this problem is a picnic p
