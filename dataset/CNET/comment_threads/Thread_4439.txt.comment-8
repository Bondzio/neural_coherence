Ok...I was able to get this old box working and install a new hard drive.
News is that due to its age, my new Arca Sim Racing game will not work....so...im going to take the challenge on.
Im not that up with all the hardware stuff.
The gentelman that suggested the things above I think are excellent suggestions.
What If I wanted to put say another 600 bucks in the deal?
That would total out to 1,100?
If you were in my situation, what setup would you get?
Also, will my existing case support the new mobo?
Thanks, nascar4num9
