figure 100 watts for under 1ghz machines, 200 for above 2ghz.
printers vary widely with my old laserjet ii sucking up 1,000 watts when the heater element kicks in to today's laser that sips 4 or less watts when just sitting there.
if the printers/scanners are newer, guesstimate 10 watts each.
if you feel you don't want to guess, go to radio shack and buy the wall mount ac watt meter.
