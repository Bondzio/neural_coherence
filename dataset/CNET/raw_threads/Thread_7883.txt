Hi there, I have 4 brand new hard drives that that i would like to thoroughly check before putting them into use. What are some things i can do or use, besides checkdisk, to stress test a new hard drive, seek out bad sectors, and to sniff out future problems?

I don't need that kind of reliability so have never done burn-in on my harddrive.

Electronics usually fail within the first hour of useage. Keep the drive(s) cool and you won't have any problems. WD blacks are the best with samsung running a close second.
