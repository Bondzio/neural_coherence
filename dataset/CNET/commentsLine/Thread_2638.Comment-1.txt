i have had tv wonder card for many years and i enjoy having tv and a dvr capability on my workstation and laptop.
now here is the problem: next year most over the air signals are going silent.
what i want to buy is anew tv tuner appliance that will take the cable tv cable and decode the digital channels and also decode and show the hdtv channels.
this appliance should be usb as the interface to the computers.
is there anything out there right now that does this?
is there going to be ??
thanks
