this is quite frequently caused by using a 3rd party partitioning program to allow large drives to be recognized by older computers.
if you used disk manager or ez drive to partition the drive then you need to run that software to get the data recognized.
best bet in those cases is to network the old drive from the original system to the new one and copy the files over the network.
then wipe the drive out completely (repartition) if you want to use it with xp.
