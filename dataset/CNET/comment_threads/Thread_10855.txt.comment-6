Get the Radeon X700Pro.
The extra 128 Megabytes will come in handy when playing more complex games like Doom 3 and Farcry.
Future games and apps are starting to demand more memory and you're going to wish you had sprung for the extra memory.
I've always found ATI to be more efficient in their card's core architecture which is why I suggest the X700.
It will last you longer down the road then the other cards.
