This was how I was notified of this issue. My processor has recently stopped registering as 2.4g and is now registering as a 1002.2 Mhz. I've been trying to find answers with little success. I was hoping someone here would have an idea for me to try.

I opened the properties to &quot;My computer&quot; It told me My processor was registering at 1002.2 Mhz, then I ran a benchmark Perform test and same thing, it registered as 1002.2. I do not have power save turned on.
