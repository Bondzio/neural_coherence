I am currentlly putting together a computer with a quad core processor and want to be able to add two video cards and a physics accelerator so I expect the computer to get pretty hot.
I have looked at the Asus Arctic Square ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835101010&Tpk=asus%2barctic%2bsquare ) and the Zalman CNPS9700 Led Fan ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835118019 )and they both have good reviews.
I plan on having a case with clear sides and in the case there are a few blue LDS so I would prefer if it went with the style, looked nice, and wasn't out of place but it also has to be good at cooling the system because I would like the computer to be as QUIET as possible.
Any suggestions would be great!
Thanks, Chris
