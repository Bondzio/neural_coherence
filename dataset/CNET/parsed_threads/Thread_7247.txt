<s> i have two 400gb(800gb total) hard drives setup as raid-0 . </s>
<s> what i want to do is, i want to take out one of my hdd and just have one 400 gig in there but i dont know how. </s>
<s> Can anyoe shed some light on the situation? </s>
<s> For RAID 0 you would have to copy what you want out from the set, then install the single, install the OS then restore from backup. </s>
<s> Usually too much to ask for some since they won't want to reinstall the OS or applications. </s>
