I think it is pretty high and it may reduce my cpu life. Should I get a better CPU heatsink? Any suggestions? Thanks! computer spec: 3.2ghz pentium 4 640

After i replaced my powersupply (it was burnt), i think i touched the heatsink during the process and no matter how i mounted and tighten the heatsink, it is not as good as it was b4. Im sure it has nothin to do with the psu because i replaced with the same one. I think it's just my heatsink clamps are not as tight as it was b4
