The monitor has had a flicker from the beginning, which is getting worse. I have tried everything in HP help and nothing seems to correct the problem. I have heard of the blackout problem. Is this the way this problem starts?

Set it at 60 hertz and see if it helps. When it starts blacking out you will know because after about 1 minute when the computer turns on the monitor will blackout

I changed it to 75HZ yesterday and it worked fine for about a day, then began flikcering again. I begins slowly and gets worse. Sometimes the screen turns red and there are lines across the screen. Any other suggestions?
