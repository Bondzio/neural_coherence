Hello, I am a beginner so my apologies if i do not understand or have to ask again anyways, I just got a Toshiba laptop with windows 8 pre-installed.
It had a 1 TB hard drive and I added another 1 TB as it has a slot I want to install Linux.
How should I go about partitioning my extra hard drive that I added?
Currently it is unallocated and currently i do not see this hard drive i added in the list of my drives in the My computer but yes i do see it in the Disk management area any help is much appreciated
