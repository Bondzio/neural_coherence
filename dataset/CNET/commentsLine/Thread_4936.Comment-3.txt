thanks for your advice.
it is really confusing because my hp network sharing center has the network in my name and the mcafee has it in his name.
i also wanted to ask this, the network is stating it is public.
should i make it private or keep it public?
it is only me and his laptop a desktop and the printer we share and a roku device.
and i am not going to starbucks any time soon to use my computer.
