1.1.1	I have a linksys wrt120n connected to my cable modem at one end of the house, I have run a cat5 cable to the other end of the house, where I need to connect multiple devices, so I have a netgear wgr614 router that I will be connecting to that end of the cable, to be fed by the linksys router, question is do I configure the cat5 cable as a straight through or as a crossover cable to enable internet access from the linksys to the netgear?	St
1.1.2	I know how to config the routers, but need to know whether to use a crossover or straight through?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	What you need is an ethernet switch.	St
1.3.2	Most routers contain a few ethernet ports so they do have something of a built-in switch.	Sug
1.3.3	Modern switches tend to be &quot;auto-sensing&quot; so you can use either type of cable.	St
1.3.4	The simple thing is just use the straight through that you mentioned rather than a crossover cable.	St
1.4.1	You need a switch, not a router.	St
1.5.1	Yeah I know a switch would have been the better to use, but we are talking about devices I already have as opposed to devices I don't have.	St
1.5.2	Anyway it is up and running perfectly and all of my devices are sharing internet connectivity now..	St
1.5.3	Thanks for your quick responses.	St
1.6.1	DHCP in the router you are using as a switch.	St
1.6.2	Odd things can happen if you don't.	St
