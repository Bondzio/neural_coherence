i've wanted to build my own pc for some time now, but i have no real knowledge.
i would like some patient guidance on some of the general knowledge such as which is best to get, or compatibility and maybe some advanced tips.
i want to build is a gaming pc that can run the current games smoothly without having to lower the graphic settings to blocky blurs.
i would also like to be able to do this with out spending a fortune, but i realize the limitations of that aspiration.
