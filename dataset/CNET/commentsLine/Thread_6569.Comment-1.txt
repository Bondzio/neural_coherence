i am trying to set up a wired router to a wireless router.
i would just get rid of the wired router (model no.
r1524su - actiontec), except my internet requires the phoneline (it's a modem -dsl connection) to function.
the router has a phone-in port and 4 ethernet ports for connecting 4 computers simultaneously... when i try to connect my wireless router (model - netgear wgr614 (v6)), the network will work for a small amount of time and will then kick out on me - i will experience frequent connection problems and the like.
how can i connect the two together so that they will function correctly together?
thanks everyone, help is much appreciated
