thanks for the reply.
i have read that, but i can't trust it with sixty-something gigs of my data, when even the marketing departments of the hard drive companies don't seem to trust it enough to tout it.
you'd think that this would be a selling point, but it's not mentioned, even on the company sites' descriptions of their drives.
at least on the ones i've gotten to so far.
microsoft's vista-compatible hardware tool is very slow, and is of no use unless you know already know the, i guess it's model number they list by.
why not list by manufacturer, which i think would be more useful (especially for someone who wants to know where to start in looking for new hardware for vista)?
also, a web search for various combos of &quot;vista&quot; &quot;external&quot; and &quot;hard drive&quot; returns nothing substantial.
and then you have problems like what sfdrivesaver's original post here mentioned and i feel even less confident that it's as simple as an ntfs format.
i really think both microsoft and the hardware manufacturers should, especially by now, allow customers to easily locate and confidently purchase hardware for their vista systems.
that they don't, makes me suspicious.
either they aren't sure what works with vista, or they don't care about customers spending their hard-earned money for nothing but trouble.
neither scenario is even half good.
finally, on the maxtor sub-site of seagate, some drives are listed with a hardware-yes, but software-no for vista.
i'm guessing that means i can get the external to show up as a drive in windows explorer but that any special software (say for one-touch back-up) won't function.
am i correct on this?
