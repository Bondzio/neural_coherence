Didn't your new burner come with it's own software?
When I got my burner, it came with a Nero disc that was, supposedly, only for that particular burner.
Do you know what burn engine is being used?
Just a couple of ideas: 1 Check out TaskManager and see if InCD is running 2 If know what the old burn engine is called goto run in your start menu and type msconfig and edit your startup menu.
You might have a whole bunch of things running that aren't really needed.
3 Failing that get a startup Editor like GeekSuperhero, or TuneUp Utilities, or Spybot or anything you can find on the net to edit which burn engines start when you boot up your PC.
4 Try other CD/DVD burning programs.
Good Luck!
