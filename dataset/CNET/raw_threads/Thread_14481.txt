I got a new HD (since Sony has no recover program other than wiping the whole HD) reloaded the drivers and OS and then tried to access my old HD using a stand alone SATA portable HD case (Rocketfish). Problem: I can see the folders, and even access down a level but when I tried to open/copy/move a folder/file it locks up. I had tried copying through the cmd.exe interface and it can list the directories, but when you ask it to copy it states it can't find it. Does anyone know how I can get data off my old HD? Thanks in advance! Matt

I do think it may have something to do with the registry - the program from MS that addresses &quot;file not found&quot; registry errors cannot be selected for an external HD which this is - any suggestions? Thanks in advanced- Matt
