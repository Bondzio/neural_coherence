I looked at my video card and it does not have this as a res (likley since wide-screens were not being offered at the time). I downloaded an updated driver but it still does not support that resolution (I also made sure to show all resolutions, not just the ones supported by my current monitor). So I guess I need a new video card and I am trying to figure which to buy. I currently have the NVIDEA GeFORCE4 MX 440 with AGP 8x. I mainly use the pc for photo editing, not really for games (the only game played is SIMS2 occasionaly). I've looked at some cards but they were close to $200 which is more than I would like to spend, would rather put it towards a new PC is I were going to spend that. Any advice on which to purchase, which brand is good, and what I need to know when purchasing a graphics card???? Also, the new monitor is both digital and analog. My current monitor is only analog, and that is the only way it connects to the PC. If I buy a new video card, would it allows to use either analog or video, or is that dependent on another factor. Basically I am cluseless with video cards as I've never had to upgrade or replace it. Thanks for the help...

But I did go into the control panel/display/settings/advance and un-checked &quot;hide modes this monitor can not display.&quot; Since I did not see the one I specified above, I am assuming this is an issue with the video-card and not with the monitor driver. I would hope you are right, but from what I've read, it sounds like I likely need a new card.

You may be replacing a card that could do the task but that's up to you to decide whether to try the monitor.inf or driver and hook it up for a test. Your time and money... Bob

Is it possible to download the driver onto my PC without the new monitor, and seeing if I can change the resolution, or would my current monitor be disabled as a result?

So unfortunately can not provide a link. I currently have the hp pavilion vf17.
