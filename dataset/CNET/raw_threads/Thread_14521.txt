If it's the former, it's completely normal. It's what the CPU does when it's not working on anything else. It's typical to see this running close to 100% when the computer is idle.

Then when SP2 came out, installed it, same for SP3. I used the disks that came with my motherboard at time of XP install drivers. Allowed all XP updates by auto-update. Thanks again, Ben
