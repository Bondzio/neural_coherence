3951	0	198640	2134136	NR	dustemikkel	8/15/06 11:15 AM	1.1556405E12	Connecting TV and PC - Gainward GeForce FX5200	I have connected my TV to my Gainward GeForce FX5200 s-video output, I get a picture, but I am unable to view both my TV-set and my PC-monitor at the same time. I have updated my drivers. I suspect that my graphics card does not support this feature, otherwise the option to run both screens (clone-view or whatever, my driver is Norwegian) would appear in the Nvidia control panel, right? Is this correct? Does this mean I need a new graphics card in order to use both? How do I identify which cards support this and which don't? Or is it simply something I'm doing wrong?
