In the interest of not repeating the many many posts on the subjects addressed, please take a look at some of the searches below...starting with the one on 'backup'.
I would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas.
The one thing I recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location...whether it be electronic bits and bytes .
.
especially an external HDD, or even hard copy.

Hoping this helps.
