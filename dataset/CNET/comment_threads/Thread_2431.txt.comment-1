I have a 20.1&quot; DELL monitor that I use with my notebook in my office when I'm not traveling.
My setup used to be that the monitor on my notebook had a different resolution (1024 x 768) than the external Dell monitor (1680 x 1050).
Something happened and now I don't have that 1680 x 1050 resolution as an option, and the external monitor and laptop monitor are now set the same.
I redownloaded the drivers from the Dell CD that came with the monitor, but I still can't set the resolution correctly.
HELP!
Thanks.
