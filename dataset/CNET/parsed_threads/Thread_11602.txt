<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/43303-43-verizon-jetpack-connect-router is the usual response. </s>
<s> But what you need is to configure this is one thing and a google. </s>
<s> Here's the thing -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-Wireless-4-Port-Bridge-TEW-640MB/dp/B004FMI3DA Now you have 4 ethernet ports and if you want to add your router as a WAP (can't see why if you get the thing) then google this -&gt; How do I use a router as a WAP. </s>

<s> Since all I'm asking about and all I want to do is provide internet to my non-wireless equipped home computer using my Verizon mobile broadband device I'm wondering why I can't just buy a USB wireless adaptor and plug this into my home computer and send wireless to the computer from my Verizon device? </s>
<s> or is there a reason to buy something else? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> It is not what you asked above. </s>
<s> &quot;Verizon mobile broadband to router&quot; is solvable with the model I shared and there are other ways to get this to work with your router. </s>
<s> If you want to add WiFi to your machine, yes that works but means we are not using the router. </s>
