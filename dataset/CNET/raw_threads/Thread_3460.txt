When I plug my d-link router directly into my comcast cable modem then my pc into my d-link, I get a connection but internet explorer can't connect to web. So, I tried my laptop it gets a strong signal from router but again can't acess web. Router has lastest firmware, is reset, not wep or wpa enabled (yet) and the laptop can see the channel and that the router it is an open network. By the way PC works fine when pluged directly into the cable modem. Please help! Thanks

They like give the router an IP address and make it Gateway, or something like that. Most companies have a online tool to do it, but I couldn't find one on their site. Your best bet would be to call them and they can walk you through it. Best of luck! ~Ibrahim
