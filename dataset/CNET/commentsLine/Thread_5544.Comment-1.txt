my friend has offered to build me a pc if i buy him a motherboard.
there are so many choices out there and i'm a noob anyway so i would like some suggestions.
i need a motherboard that can handle games like age of empires 2, blood bowl, team fortress 2, portal 2, and other similar games.
i don't think i particularly need a gaming computer but i want something reliable and capable to get me through college.
any feedback would be appreciated thanks.
