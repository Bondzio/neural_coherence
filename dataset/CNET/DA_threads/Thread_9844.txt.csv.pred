1.1.1	I took my Netgear WGR614v10 back to Walmart and exchanged it for a WNR2000v2 .	St
1.1.2	I find out after I got home that not only is it not windows 7 certified but its not certified for xbox either .	St
1.1.3	It seems to be working better than the old router on the laptop but when I test my 360 connection I get a moderate NAT warning .	St
1.1.4	I have followed all the steps listed on the xbox support .	St
1.1.5	I have forwarded port , set xbox as the DMz .	St
1.1.6	I do n't know what else to do .	St
1.1.7	The connection seems to be some better but I ca n't get the NAT changed to open .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions on what to do or should I just give it up and order a wireless modem from my ISP and pay $ 4.00 every month ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	We have that router .	St
1.2.2	But .	St
1.2.3	( What ? )	Ques
1.2.4	Ours is setup like this forum suggests as to latest firmware and the rest of the suggested settings .	St
1.2.5	I did n't have to open ports , forward , touch anything NAT .	St
1.2.6	It just works .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	If I plug the 360 straight into the modem it reads an open NAT ; but that 's from where I had to reconfigure it before with the old router .	St
1.3.2	I plugged the new router in and that 's when it read a moderate NAT .	St
1.4.1	Here I did nothing .	St
1.4.2	Or very little .	St
1.4.3	I did exactly what this forum asked .	St
1.4.4	Lastest firmware , router defaults , and WPA-PSK for wifi security and a simple broadcasting SSID .	St
1.4.5	Your post sounds like you are trying many interesting things .	St
1.4.6	I 'm glad my 2000 just works with the 360 without touching any setting .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I reset the modem to factory defaults and tried it again and got the same results .	St
1.5.2	Still a moderate NAT .	St
1.5.3	I thought maybe the issue was the fact the router is n't certified for the xbox but if you have no issues then that 's probably not it .	St
1.5.4	I tried to upgrade to the latest firmware and it said none was available .	St
1.6.1	I went to the router maker 's web site since those router web interfaces are not reliable .	St
1.6.2	Ok , maybe I 'm missing something .	St
1.6.3	Both our 360s work with live fine .	St
1.6.4	But you keep writing moderate NAT .	St
1.6.5	Is there more to this story ?	Ques
1.6.6	That is , are you attempting something other than Live ?	Ques
1.6.7	It will be a few weeks until I get back to home ( on travel today ) to see what firmware I have in our 2000 router but here , the stock settings and the forum advice works .	St
1.6.8	Parting idea .	St
1.6.9	See if you can put the xbox 360 into the DMZ .	St
1.6.10	Bob	St
1.7.1	I just purchased this router and was having a problem connecting xbox live via my laptop .	St
1.7.2	Try the following to resolve your problem .	St
1.7.3	1 ) Go to the & quot ; router login & quot ; 2 ) Click on & quot ; WAN Setup & quot ; 3 ) uncheck the box labeled as & quot ; NAT Filtering & quot ;	St
1.8.1	I meant uncheck the box & quot ; Disable SIP ALG & quot ; then check the box & quot ; OPEN & quot ;	St
1.9.1	Yes you may set the NAT filtering to & quot ; open & quot ; , Disable the firewall and also you may lower the MTU size to 1400 and if non of these steps work advise to upgrade the firmware of the router .	St
1.10.1	I had three diff routers before this one .	St
1.10.2	I did the DMZ open prt forwarding ALL the things forums said , and nothing helped !	St
1.10.3	The NETGEAR WNR2000v2 has to the best router ever for MWCOD , and black ops and any xbox 360 game !	St
1.10.4	All I did was plug it up and it ran !	St
1.10.5	Open NAT every time , no configuration , It even saw the gateway without cofiguration .	St
1.10.6	It has a good range as well on the wireless .	St
1.10.7	If your fighting the open NAT like I was , You will love this router !	St
1.11.1	i have the same NETGEAR WNR2000v2 router and ive tried everything and still get & quot ; nat type moderate & quot ; its really pissing me off think we should just throw the thing away and buy a belkin router i had one while i lived in England and ive never ever had any problems with it	St
1.12.1	potwillams try this as i have the same router .	St
1.12.2	go to your router setup for net gear its 192.168.1.1 or routerlogin.net then go to WAN setup and make sue that NAT filtering is on open .	Sug
1.12.3	secured will give you moderate or restricted .	St
