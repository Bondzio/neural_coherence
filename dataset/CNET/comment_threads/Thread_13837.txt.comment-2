Some questions,, Find the HD that came with the PC.
What kind of cable is hooked to it, a small roundish one with a small connector on the end or a wide flat one with a big 40 pin connector??
If it is the small doundish one then it is SATA.
If the wide flat one with the big 40 pin then it is ATA.
Now what kind of connector does you old HD have on it??
