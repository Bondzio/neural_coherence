<s> this is a noob question, but what power supply is needed for Athlon 64? </s>
<s> The ATXV12 of the latest spec 2.01 or later is used by all CPUI's, However, there is a new kicker, which depends on the mobo, the normall connector PS to mobo was 20 Pins, now the newer mobos use 24 pins. </s>
<s> Thus you should now what the mobo takes and then buy a power supply that has the correct connector. </s>
<s> Most PS's with a 24 pin connector provide a 24 to 20 adapter cable with them. </s>
<s> Re power rating of the supply go 450 watts or better, this is nad business on my part, you really should tell us what the system will have on it. </s>
<s> It is possible that you might more than 450 watts to give the supply some operating margin. </s>
<s> Ok i also was looking to upgrade my PSU . </s>
<s> After checking Newegg i seen the 24 pin one but they also list a 20+4 pin . </s>
<s> Are they the same or will we burn our Mobo up if we get the wrong one ?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
