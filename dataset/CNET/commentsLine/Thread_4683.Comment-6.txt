this would work fine if the computer has a static ip address.
you could still connect without having a static ip but you would have to call the relative each time you want to connect and have them tell you the current ip address.
some isp's don't offer static addresses or they charge you more for the convenience.
but if they have a static ip, simply create a vpn on your computer and then configure the relative's computer to act as a vpn server.
