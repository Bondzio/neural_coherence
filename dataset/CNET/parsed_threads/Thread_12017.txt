<s> I want to set up a120 GB SSD with a 1 TB HDD. </s>
<s> The SSD will be used for boot, some games and often used programs. </s>
<s> The HDD wil be used for lesser used games and programs and movies, etc., storage, not backup </s>
<s> Easy? </s>
<s> Put the SSD on the lowest numbered SATA channel, the HDD on the next then follow the install instructions for Windows 7 to the letter for your PC. </s>
<s> Let's hope it includes Intel's RST, BIOS updates and such rather than guessing at this. </s>
<s> Your PC's maker should have this instruction. </s>
<s> Let I lead off with. </s>
<s> Easy and hard! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since the SSD will be the boot drive that dictates where it has to go, 1st device or link to be booted. </s>
<s> You just treat it like any other HD out there. </s>
<s> FYI- Don't try to use the SSD too intensity it becomes harder and harder for the SSD to maintain its level of keeping all in order as unlike a std. </s>
<s> HD it tends to have the problem of frequent area of media becoming unable to clear media for use, thus the TRIM cmd. </s>
<s> is required. </s>
<s> All is done to help maintain the storage media doesn't over use same media area and maybe rendered unable to store/clear itself. </s>
<s> Which defeats the purpose of any storage media. </s>
<s> Google for TRIM to understand what its trying to do. </s>
<s> I offer this as what you plan to use it as gaming, that it isn't at some time become inoperable as it can't recover from frequent use. </s>
<s> Some SSD just up and die, giving no warning. </s>
<s> Yes, some SSD are better than others, so if compared you'll noticed a price difference for similar rated storage do vary. </s>
