your less known brands are (which tend to be of some good quality), but sony, dell, and even hp (sometimes) will offer laptops to rival the mbp for ridiculous prices, even if their specs are a bit better.
i've done research before, and it's true.
macs aren't cheap, but all the &quot;top&quot; brands are up there in price too.
building your own desktops with your own components is a different matter i'd think.
the mac mini... that thing is worth $400 at the most.
i'd get one to say i have one and to put xp or vista on it, but it's way too overpriced.
midstream desktop for regular prices = not cool.
