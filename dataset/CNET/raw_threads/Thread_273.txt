11798	0	582382	5407876	NR	chzuck	1/7/13 12:08 PM	1.35756048E12	WPC54G wireless adapter issues on a T22 Laptop.	I have a Thinkpad T22 running W2k with all the updates and hotfixes installed. I am having issues with a Linksys WPC54G wireless adapter. When starting the laptop with the adapter software installed, I get this error when the wireless monitor and wireless connection are enabled: External exception E06D7363. I also get a runtime error on WPC54Cfg.exe file saying abnormal program termination. I can eliminate this by removing the configuration utility from the Startup menu. I think there is a software conflict somewhere, but have no idea where. I can get it to work after I exit the wireless monitor providing I don't have any security enabled. I am using a Linksys WRT54G wireless router. The other wireless computer on the network (a Dell tower running XP Professional using a USB wireless adapter) works fine.
