They start at $100 and up depending on the features. I like the Movie Box Plus at $150 for the better features and much better software. At the least you can capture video to your computer with any of these and play it back once in. The better cards will let you edit your video for a more polished look. You can also google &quot;video capture&quot; for more options. These can be found at Best Buy, Circuit City or almost anywhere computer related devices are sold. Check out pinnaclesys.com for more info. As for #2, almost any VHS machine can hook up to these cards. What worked best for me was two things. #1. Get a capture card that supports S-video and get a vhs machine that also has that option. #2 Get a good quality cable! This will ensure a higher quality of video on your computer. I hope you find this of some help. Good luck!

Right now I have the Pinnacle Studion 10 to capture the PC Cam mini tape then edit it. The Pinnacle capture card will go right along with it. I have never bought one and did not want to spend the money until I had some input. Thanks for your help on that

Is the CPU speed too slow to work with my Cam Corder or Home Made movies for YouTube ? Thanks, the Cajun Crawfish are on the way.

I run 1 gb on win xp and can still use my computer while its doing its thing. You might consider some external storage for your media. On average it take 13 gb for one hour of raw video. Some crawfish etoufee would be SWEET!
