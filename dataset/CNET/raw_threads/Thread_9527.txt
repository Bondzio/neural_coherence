It's technical and has to do with device identifier numbers in the USB chips on the products. More at http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb5.htm Notice that if a vendor cheaps out and does not have unique serial numbers as well as other entries your issue can occur. You can try putting one of the drives on some USB hub but it's a sign that there is a problem with the production of said product. Bob
