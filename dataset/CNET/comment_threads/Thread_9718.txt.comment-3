So it isn't their problem anymore.
That's understandable.
You might tell more, such as: - If the desktop connects wired (did you use the right cable, do the LED's light up) or wireless.
- What the XP troubleshooting tool told you.
It should come up in IE if it can't connect.
- If it did work with your previous router.
- What ipconfig tells you (run from the command prompt).
- What exactly you mean with &quot;connect&quot;.
Can you ping the router, for example?
