I need the wiring diagram for an XT 1110 chassis based Transformer, Input 240V AC 50hz Output 12V AC 100mA One side has 2 black wires Other side has 2 Red & 1 white I'm mounting it in a box with circuit printed board, Question; which wire goes where??

The one with 2 red and one white probably means one is a center tap but it could be on the primary side to accommodate either 200 or 240 V. The primary side will have more coils and will probably have wire that is more thin. If you can see the which coils the colored wires attach to, that's a good clue. I know a simple way if you have another transformer with a known and measurable output but won't get into this just yet. I also know a way to use a 1 1/2 volt battery and your tongue to do a crude step up/ or step down test but it probably isn't advised here. Good luck.
