All of the 3.5&quot; hard drives in external enclosures I've seen require more power than the USB ports can provide.
Some 2.5&quot; laptop drives in external enclosures can run off the power from one USB channel but for larger drives...probably 80GBs or 100GBs and above require power from 2 USB ports ...they have a &quot;Y&quot; cable and can also run off AC adapters too.
Hope this helps.
