Pam: I too will soon be faced with that same dilemma; my 6 year old PC which is very old runs on WIN 95, is a P2 or a P3 and has a 4.0GB HD.
You mentioned you have a new Dell 4700.
Is it a Dell 4700 or the mini-tower Dell 4700C?
How long have you had it and how do you like it?
Anything come up yet requiring you to contact Dell's tech support?
