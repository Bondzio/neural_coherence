my comp has been having trouble running some new games that have just been released and since i am on a limited budget i cant buy a new comp so i need some advice on what to upgrade first.
i have a gateway gm5474 that i inherited from a family member but i built the last 2 computers that i had previously from scratch so i can do any upgrade, i'm just not sure where i should start.
my specs are at  any help would be greatly appreciated
