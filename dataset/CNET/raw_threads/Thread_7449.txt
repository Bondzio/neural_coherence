101	2	164126	1815696	1815262	honico	3/18/06 4:27 AM	1.14265602E12	This is what happened...	I decided that I wanted a duel core. I fell that I will get more time out of it. I usually like about 3 years out of a new machine. Then, I decided my video card the ati 9600xt is really a good card and there is no reason to get a pci express card so I chose a motherboard with both pci express and with agp. I want to continue to use most of my existing dell for my kids so I am going to purchase new drives. I have a hard drive and memory alrady. Before I push the button is this the best setup?

I like the Aspire cases with the top exhaust [have used three of them]. With side intake and added rear exhaust never a cooling problem. Unfortunately I don't think that they offer them sans power supply.
