Also note that you need at least the SP1 CD to be able to use such a large hard disk. The original Windows XP won't work. Kees

Said another way...if it won't recognize a 320 SATA HDD it won't recognize a 320GB IDE either. Did you try jumpering the drive to SATA 1.5 vs 3.0? VAPCMD

Can you return the SATA or perhaps use it in an external enclosure ? In any event ... good luck and keep us posted. VAPCMD
