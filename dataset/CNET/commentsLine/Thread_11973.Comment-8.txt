i tried to replicate the problem again by cntrl+alt+deleting, and by waiting for the servers to change maps, and it hasnt happened since i turned down my speed a little.
i took it from 300 core clock speed to 250 and memory clock speed from 500 to 400, and it is a little more laggy, but hey, i would take a little lag over terrible tearing and shearing any day.
thanks for your help, and i hope this fixed it.
if it didnt get fixed, i will report back to let you know.
