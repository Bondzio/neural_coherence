<s> I have an emachines T6212 desktop that is hardly adequate for the tasks I want to use my computer for. </s>
<s> Therefore, I am seriously looking at an upgrade. </s>
<s> If possible, I am hoping to be able to use the existing case and PSU, just upgrading the motherboard, CPU, and RAM. </s>
<s> Is this a realistic dream? </s>
<s> Or will I need to also get a new power supply, and if so, how powerful of a PSU do I need? </s>
<s> Here are the details: Current Computer: emachines T6212 desktop AMD Athlon 64 3200+ 2.0GHz single core, 512 K L2 Cache 120 GB Western Digital IDE hard drive upgraded to 2.5 GB DDR RAM micro-ATX motherboard (no specified manufacturer), model # MS-7093, ATI Xpress 200 chipset 180W PSU New components (or what I hope to have): sub-$100 micro-ATX motherboard, likely an MSI 880GM-E43 AMD Phenom II X4 955 processor hope to eventually have all 4 RAM slots full Thank you all </s>
<s> If you were happy with the old eMachine, get another one. </s>
<s> Newer ones are in the entry level and offered at $400 or less. </s>
<s> While you may need to wait when a deal pops-up, now is a good time as the &quot;school sales&quot; are happening. </s>
<s> You can get your hands on decent systems, mutli-core cpu, std. </s>
<s> ram, large HD, and warranty woo to include the Win7 OS. </s>
<s> That's a good bargain in my book for those looking for a deal. </s>
<s> Compared to building an &quot;upgraded PC&quot; you may find the costs similar but compare anyways. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have previously looked at buying a new emachine or other computer, but I found that a)emachines' highest-end computer only has a dual core, and b)getting a quad core from another company would be at least $500. </s>
<s> Seeing how as I plan on using this new computer for moderately intense gaming, as well as 3D design, I am trying to get as much power as I can possibly get for my money, and the components I have mentioned in my original post cost less than $250 total. </s>
<s> Even if I did need a new case and PSU, that would still be below $300. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion, though </s>
<s> Major upgrades to an old machine do not normally return much bang-for-the-buck. </s>
<s> Round numbers. </s>
<s> Cpu...........100 bucks mobo.........100 bucks Gpu...........100 bucks.........since you mentioned gaming. </s>
<s> Psu............100 bucks.........maybe you can use the old one. </s>
<s> Ram...........100 bucks If the new mobo won't support pata. </s>
<s> HD +optical ..........100 bucks Now you've got a bunch of parts that you have to assemble and hope they work. </s>
<s> Then you get to install some old OS on this new hardware........that can be a joke/chore. </s>
<s> Your call. </s>
<s> If you change that mobo and you have a OEM OS I suspect your looking at getting a new OS. </s>
<s> OS.........100 bucks </s>
<s> Let's be fair, you didn't mention gaming and 3D usage. </s>
<s> So, basically you're trying to build a cheap PC that may fulfill the bottom end of what you plan to see. </s>
<s> You mentioned $250 for those components, but I'm very sure you will be above that. </s>
<s> Because, the video alone will push it higher getting a better one at least $100-150 or more. </s>
<s> Plus, as already posted here, if use of an OEM OS, you will need to replace that as well. </s>
<s> You see where this is all going. </s>
<s> I suggest you save some more get whatever you really need and then match as best as possible. </s>
<s> Building too cheaply will cost you sooner or later if you plan to really get into gaming and 3D usage. </s>
<s> Also, a decent PSU that's aname brand is roughly $100+ or more. </s>
<s> I offer at least 500w unit may do, but its not uncommon now for 600W or even 700W PSU's to get the nod. </s>
<s> This is all about building a tough yet stable PC that will last and hopefully endure long play with proper cooling. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> Thank you all for your contributions, but I feel I need to clarify my situation, so here are my components, or what I hope they will be: - CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 955 or higher processor ($120-$140) - Motherboard: MSI 880GM-E43 ($80 -$20 MIR) or MSI 870U-G55 ($90 -$20 MIR) - RAM: Corsair 6GB Tri channel XMS3 DDR3 RAM ($53) - GPU: have an EVGA Geforce 8400GS 1GB card already, and once I upgrade, I'm pretty sure I can get my hands on a Nvidia Geforce GT420 for a small sum of money - HDD: planning on using my old 120 GB hard drive until its served as long as it will. </s>
<s> - OS: opting to use a copy of Windows XP Professional, as I am more than hesitant to upgrade to Vista or 7. </s>
<s> - Case: If an upgrade to the PSU is necessary, I will probably spring for a Thermaltake V3 Black Edition ($45 - $10 MIR) - PSU: If necessary, something like an Antec Basiq 500W would probably do the trick ($50 -$10 MIR) (that is, assuming 500W will adequately supply my components. </s>
<s> * Total:$348-$378, before a total of $40 in rebates. </s>
<s> Again, this computer will be used for only a light to moderate amount of gaming and 3D modeling, mainly to get me started on a more high-performing computer setup. </s>
<s> Tell me what you think, and thanks again for all the advice. </s>
<s> Both mobo's you selected use dual channel for the ram. </s>
<s> You might want to re-think that tri-channel kit. </s>
<s> Just to be sure. </s>
<s> You might want to visit the MSI site and verify they supply drivers for XP and those mobo's. </s>
<s> If indeed that memory kit will not work with that motherboard, I will probably go for the Patriot 8GB Dual G2 series ($53) or Corsair 8GB XMS3 Dual Channel kit ($60). </s>
