1.1.1	I have Sony VAIO VGC-RC210G it comes with an ATI X300 PCI-e. Needless to say it 's a bit low on the gaming scale .	St
1.1.2	So I was looking to upgrade to say an ATI 1900 xtx , or Similar .	St
1.1.3	I was wondering if any one with a RC210G has upgraded there graphics card and to what , ATI , Nvidia ?	Ques
1.1.4	Also how well it works for you ?	Ques
1.2.1	... looks ominous !	St
1.2.2	Maybe that model only got one sale ?	Ques
1.2.3	Judging from reviews such as : http : //www.gcn.com/print/25_17/41142-1.html sony uses a massive amount power , and like all things with a big name badge , it likely does n't come with an over specified PSU .	St
1.2.4	In other words , it already uses a lot of power , and the PSU it comes with will not be an expensive model with a massive overhead for a huge 3D upgrade .	St
1.2.5	Huge ?	Ques
1.2.6	The graphics card you 're after requires more power than any other option which is likely to be doomed to failure in a ynos PC : http : //www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/geforce7900gtx_6.html You 'd only be compounding possible problems , and you might have to consider a PSU upgrade , which may or may not ( the latter is more likely ) be an option .	St
1.2.7	Or you could opt for a graphics card which does n't draw so much power .	St
1.2.8	No doubt with a trendy ynos , something as horrible ( even though it works ) as this would be out of the question too : http : //www.hexus.net/content/item.php ? item=6221 Good luck in your endeavours though , GB .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info .	St
