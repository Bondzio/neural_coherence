thanks, i had good time with this forum, must say.
and also worth a try, as i hoped actually it will work, cause i realy don't want to run that cable again.
but, i've connected a small second hand 4port switch, and that seems to help, and i have space for another 2 cables to fit in case i need more.
thanks for your time guys.
i appreciate it a lot
