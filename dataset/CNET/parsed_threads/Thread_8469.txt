<s> processor: AMD athlon64 3200+ 2.0ghz memory (ram): pqi pc400 1023mb (512mbx2) system type: 32 bit motherboard: epox 9NPA3 Ultra bios: phoenix - award worrkstation operating system: windows vista ultimate edition a few weeks ago,my os needed reformating but i didnt have extra hard disk to back up my files(since i wanted a complete re4mat including partitions). </s>
<s> my old hard disk was a seagate barracuda 160gb SATA. </s>
<s> i was able to borrow an external maxtor 40gb PATA from a friend. </s>
<s> since d enclosure was broken, i took out the hard disk and connected it manually through an IDE cable. </s>
<s> i also borrowed a seagate 160gb PATA and everything went well. </s>
<s> ive backed up all my important files. </s>
<s> few days later, i was bought a new seagate barracuda 250 gb SATA and installed it. </s>
<s> i now have a -seagate 160gb SATA (the one that needs to be reformated) -maxtor 40gb PATA (where most of my files are backed up) -seagate 160gb PATA (few important files backed up) -seagate 250 gb SATA (the new hard disk) now that i want to restore my backed up files, im now having trouble detecting the maxtor PATA hd while the seagate PATA hdd is going well. </s>
<s> i was able to restore my files from the seagate ata hdd but not from the maxtor. </s>
<s> i already checked maxtor's website and reviewed the jumper settings http://eshop.macsales.com/Tech/manuals/idehdsettings/Maxtor72.pdf i also checked the IDE cables and the power cables and they're all properly connected. </s>
<s> i also tried disconnecting my working dvd rom's IDE and used it on the maxtor drive but nothing changed. </s>
<s> my bios just cant detect the maxtor hdd, not even disk management. </s>
<s> the weird thing is when i connect the seagate PATA, it detects it easily but when i connect the maxtor PATA with the same IDE cable and power supply, nothing happens. </s>
<s> actually sometimes, when the maxtor PATA is connected, windows boots slowly or sometimes it hangs on the bios information screen. </s>
<s> what should i do? </s>
<s> could be the hdd broken or damaged? </s>
<s> i cant feel the disk spinning but the whole hard disk is getting warm while it is connected to my mobo. </s>
<s> is there any way to correct this problem? </s>
<s> and if the drive is broken, how can i recover my IMPORTANT files since it cant be detected? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> We use 80 conductor IDE cables. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Cable Select or Master (I never use Master but we are in crisis mode.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Put the drive on the master connection of the ide cable. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Put it on the known working IDE port (unplug the DVD). </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Check that power is connected. </s>
<s> Does the BIOS see it with either CS or Master? </s>
<s> Is the cable no good? </s>
<s> Try it as Master on the cable the DVD uses. </s>
<s> Next? </s>
<s> Data recovery houses like drivesavers.com Bob </s>
<s> 1) i used an IDE cable. </s>
<s> 2) connected it to the 2nd IDE slot since the dvd drive is using the first slot. </s>
<s> i set the jumper and the IDE cable to master settings but nothing happens. </s>
<s> 3) now i tried all the connections to slave settings and same happens. </s>
<s> 4) i unplugged the IDE cable from the dvd drive and used it on my hard drive but nothing happens. </s>
<s> 5) i always check the power cables and it is very noticeable because i used the same line of power cables connected to the case fan. </s>
<s> i mean if there is no power, the case fans shouldnt also be running. </s>
<s> 6) BIOS cannot detect the drive with either slave or master setting. </s>
<s> now this is my latest observation: if i disconnect the maxtor hard disk and let my windows boot everything is fine. </s>
<s> i logged on to windows and connected the maxtor hard disk, i then went to device manager and tried &quot;scanning for hardware changes&quot;, my screen turned to blank and blue for a millisecond then restarted. </s>
<s> and this time, while the maxtor hard drive is connected to my mobo, my windows cannot boot or start. </s>
<s> it hangs or lags during the loading of bios or the part where the IDE is being detected. </s>
<s> i mean the part wherein when you press DEL you can access bios configuration. </s>
<s> but if i disconnect the maxtor hard disk again, everything comes to normal. </s>
<s> what should i do now? </s>
<s> the files on the hard disk are too important to me and the hard disk itself isnt mine. </s>
<s> is the hard disk broken? </s>
<s> is there any other way to save the hard disk and my files? </s>
<s> please tell me what to do. </s>
<s> i really need to restore my files. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> &quot;he part where the IDE is being detected. </s>
<s> i mean the part wherein when you press DEL you can access bios configuration. </s>
<s> but if i disconnect the maxtor hard disk again, everything comes to normal.&quot;... All that means is that something is wrong with the drive. </s>
<s> If it's worth saving, get a quote from drivesavers.com or ontrack.com Not to bother you but why is what you can't lose only on hard disks? </s>
