first thing i would look at would be to ensure the switch over rate for that ups is fast enough.
in other words, you may need a 8 millisecond rate to keep the computer going but the ups is only switching at 10 millisecond.
(these rates are not actual, just used as example) i would suspect you will find your problem there.
