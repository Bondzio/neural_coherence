Thanks for your help thus far, Bob.
But since I swapped in the new power supply, things have been running as smooth as a gravy sandwich.
But, if it follows the pattern, things will go belly up in a month or two...
The good news is, I can't think of anything else to replace!
Thanks again for your prompt responses!
