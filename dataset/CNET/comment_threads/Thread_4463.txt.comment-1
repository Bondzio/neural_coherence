Ok, so I had a 2.4ghz cordless phone in my kitchen and then I went wireless and installed a DI-614+ router in my living room.
The problem that I'm having is simple.
When using the cordless phone, I notice a pulsing sound in the background, which I'm sure is the routers signal.
That I can deal with.
The real concern here is that sometimes when the phone rings, I'll go to answer it and it won't pick up.
Is a 2.4ghz router supposed to work alongside a 2.4ghz phone (except for the pulsating noise)?
Should I consider paying more for a 5.8ghz phone or can I just get another 2.4 phone that isn't a piece of junk?
