1.1.1	I have two video cards, a NVIDIA GeForce 7300 LE (which is installed in my computer) and an old Geforce 4 (which is not in my computer) My computer runs slow sometimes when running games and a friend told me that there was a way to run both video cards on one computer and this will make games and such run smoother.	St
1.1.2	However i am not really sure how to install both, or even if installing both cards actualy makes the computer run faster.	St
1.1.3	i was wondering if anybody could help me out a bit	St
1.2.1	Please don't do it.	Sug
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	People who put two toally differant Video Cards together (not SLI) do it not for real perfomance but to have more then one monitor.	St
1.3.2	If you want good perfmance you have to have a SLI bridge.	St
1.3.3	Idk if any of the cards that you metinoed are SLI ready but if they are you might be able to bridge them then you get a small perfomance upgrade.	St
1.3.4	But not really worth it most likely.	St
1.3.5	-sai	St
