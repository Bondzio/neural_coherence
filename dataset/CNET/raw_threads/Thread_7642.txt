11582	0	261800	2570960	NR	dvae	8/26/07 1:03 PM	1.18813338E12	PC to TV connection	I have been told that I can set up a wireless connection between my home TV and my PC (different parts of the house of course), thus enabling the Lady Wife to view projects which I have downloaded and can play thought the PC. I could burn a DVD but this has not always proved possible, so this seems an answer. Wot I need to know is what attachments I require to accomplish this task. All info very gratefully received particularly if it impresses the Lady Wife!!! Dave

You see I really have no requirement for xbox or the wish to spend so much money, if it can be avoided. So any other suggestions would really be welcome for the reasons already given. Thanks dave

I can't find a price for it. I am sure it will have a big price tag. Something to look at. Looks like it will do what you need. Bruce. http://www.teqavit.com/WID110.html
