I have a wireless router problem and have spent hours on customer service with dell, linksys, and at&t. I am desperate for help. I have a dell desktop and dell xps 1530 laptop, and dsl service through at&t. I recently purchased a linksys wrt310n router and could not get it running with help from all 3 customer service reps. It was determined that the router was bad and I returned it in exchange for a linksys wrt160n. I have set the router up. My laptop says it is connected (local and ineternet), but every time I open ie it says webpage cannot be displayed. When I run the check for problem it displays &quot;cannot communicate with dsn server 192.168.1.254&quot; The desktop is connected via the dsl modem and router and can access the internet fine. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Do you know where the mentioned IP address comes from? Modem or router? It looks a bit suspicious. As for connection settings, are you doing these manually or automatically?

Hello! i have read the same problem on the supportrix forum and you may try this and see if this help solve your problem. make sure your computer is directly connected to the router Step 1: Shutdown the computer. Step 2: reset the router while power on then Unplug the routers power cable. Step 3: Unplug the Broadband modems power cable and wait for 30 seconds. Step 4: Plug in the Broadband modems power cable and wait for its lights to appear stable. Step 5: Plug in the router's power cable once the modems lights appear stable. Step 6: Power on the computer on and check internet connection. If you still have no internet connection, access the router setup page and configure the router settings; change the router LAN IP address to 192.168.2.1, set the connection type to PPPoE and manually type yoour att username (in email format) and password, save settings. Go to the router setup page and click on the connect button Step 7: test the Internet connection once the status indicates connected and IP address show up if this still didnot work, upgrade the firmware of your router and repeat the same steps. note: configuring the router settings will depends who is your provider. if your isp is dsl you need to configure your ISP username (email address format) and password on the router. if your router is a cable no need to change any settings on the router. it should automatically work

This will bring up run. Type cmd hit enter type ipconfig /all (space between the g and /) hit enter Look for the default gateway. Put that number in the address bar. Log into the Linksys Router. Broadcast SSID Use WPA-PSK(TKIP) Security Mixed b and g mode(n if available) Use channels 1, 6 or 11. Most wireless devices work best on these channels. Save and exit. Power everything off for 30 seconds. Now power everything back on. Try and connect. Rick
