<s> I want to buy a widescreen LCD display (native resolution 1920x1200). </s>
<s> I want to know if I need a new video card. </s>
<s> I am not into games or other stress graphics applications. </s>
<s> My systems is Sony VAIO 2002 vintage. </s>
<s> It uses a SiS 650_740 chip set and has an AGP card (from manual). </s>
<s> The manual says the resolution available from the AGP depends on the graphics monitor. </s>
<s> I use a Sony Multi-scan CRT which I drive at its max resolution of 1600x1200. </s>
<s> I want to know if my existing video card can drive the LCD in its native resolution of 1920x1200. </s>
<s> Or whether I need something new. </s>
<s> If so what? </s>
<s> Although you did very well providing specs for the system, I'll need to the make and model of the AGP card in the system to answer that question. </s>
<s> It neesds to be determined whether the card will support that kind of resolution. </s>
<s> If not, most new 128 MB AGP video cards will support that kind of resolution and higher, but you also must know if the agp slot on your motherboard will support a newer spec card. </s>
<s> If it's from 2002, it is possible that it's not a slot compatible with newer agp cards. </s>
<s> I do suspect however that your existing video setup will support that resoution. </s>
<s> I will tell you everything I have learned from the PC manual: MODEL NUMBER PCV-RX730 1.7GHZ SIS650_740 INTEGRATED GRAPHICS WITH REAL256 2D/3D GRAPHICS ACCELERATOR & 32MB SHARED WITH PROCESSOR. </s>
<s> DRIVER 4/6/02; VERSION 6.13.10.2076 THE MANUAL SAYS THERE IS A AGP BUS AND A AGP CARD. </s>
<s> IT IS IN SLOT 5. </s>
<s> AGP INTERFACE SPECIFICATION, VERSION 2.0 (SUPPORTS 2X/4X). </s>
<s> I'm still not entirely sure if the board has an agp card installed or an available agp slot. </s>
<s> If it has a card installed it will probably support the resolution but it's hard to say with out knowing the make and model of the card. </s>
<s> That said I do believe it's runing on onboard video, and information on the video capabilities of this chipset video are limited at best. </s>
<s> The other problem is that the slot whether occupied or not, is a AGP 2.0 specification. </s>
<s> The newer specification is 3.0. </s>
<s> The compatibility issues there are complex to an inexperienced user and given the limited info on that chipset, I wouldn't attempt it if I were you just now. </s>
<s> If you install a 3.3v card were only a 1.5 is supposed to go, you're not going to like the result at all. </s>
<s> &quot;Doctor, I smell burnt Toast&quot; I'm going to do some more reasearch on the chipset and get back to you. </s>
<s> From what I can gather from the SIS support site, Even their newest IGP chipsets only support up to 1600x1200. </s>
<s> This doesn't meet your demand. </s>
<s> If you do intend to then upgrade to an agp card, when you purchase it, make sure you go to a reputable dealer and explain to them that the AGP slot is 2.0 2x 4x. </s>
<s> The card &quot;should&quot; state if it's backwards compatible. </s>
<s> Make for darn sure the guys or girl knows what their talking about because if they're wrong, bye bye motherboard. </s>
<s> It appears from what I can determine that a MSI AGP in the range of E would suit your needs and I believe would be compatible. </s>
<s> This may be hard to find, but as I've said, just make sure it's compatible. </s>
<s> In addition you'll probably want a card with 256 MB of ram to keep that kind of resolution running smothly. </s>
<s> Good luck, feel free to contact me if you decide to make any purchases. </s>
<s> The typo in that last message was supposed to read in the range of a MSI Nvidia 5700le if you can find one or something comparable. </s>
