<s> I am wondering if someone can &quot;sell&quot; me on a wireless networking system or if I should just stick with good old Ethernet cables. </s>
<s> I am only hooking 2 computers to a DSL modem. </s>
<s> The modem is between the 2, and the distance between the 2 computers is only about 25 ft. </s>
<s> Seems the wireless router and 2 wireless cards I would need cost way more than simply purchasing a wired router and two 25' cords. </s>
<s> Is there any real need for me to go wireless with this setup??? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> L.T. </s>
<s> No need for the extra expense of a wireless NIC. </s>
<s> A wired NIC is less than twenty bucks, wireless around fifty. </s>
<s> Wireless is good for laptops, or in instances where wiring would be a PITA. </s>
<s> I have three PCs wired to my router, and the laptop travels around the house using wireless. </s>
<s> Most consumer oriented routers on the market combine wired/wireless features. </s>
<s> The added wireless function is nice to have if your want to add a roaming laptop and since it comes already there it's a no-brainer. </s>
<s> hi in all cases there is one golden rule: if it can be done with cables, then do it with cables; no interference,no leaks, no nothing </s>
<s> Thanks for all of the input. </s>
<s> I think I will just go with cables and put the $100 I save toward a really good printer/all-in-one. </s>
<s> I appreciate the feedback. </s>
<s> Have a nice weekend, everyone! </s>

<s> VERY WISE!THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT BBC PROG: ON THIS VERY SUBJECT OF WIRELESS PCs! </s>
<s> THEY HAD A COUPLE OF GUYS CRUISING A HOUSING ESTATE IN A CAR, AND IT SEEMS THEY COULD PICK UP EVERY WIRLESS CONNECTION ON A LAPTOP. </s>
<s> MOST WERE NOT SECURE, AND EVEN THOSE THAT WERE COULD BE HACKED! </s>
<s> GLAD I WATCHED IT AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO OVER TO WIRELESS, NOT ANYMORE, IM STICKING TO WIRED CONNECTIONS. </s>
<s> HAVE A NICE ONE. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> SORRY ABOUT CAPITALS, I HAVE AN OPTICAL DISADVANTAGE. </s>
<s> This is a very old thread. </s>
<s> Locked. </s>
