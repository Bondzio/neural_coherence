(i5 vs i7)	Hey i'm buying a new system (FINALLY) and I'm having trouble deciding which one. Here they are... System number 1 Specifications Processor Intel Core i5 Processor 750 Motherboard Intel P55 Chipset Graphics AMD ATI Radeon HD4890 / 1G of GDDR5 memory Memory 2x2G 1600MHz DDR3 gaming memory Hard Drive 500GB 7200RPM SATA Optical Drive 22x DVD+/-RW Chassis Velocity IW-C583T Mid Tower Power Supply 500W Power Supply (3x18A on 12V) Operating System Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit System number 2 Specifications Processor Intel Core i7 Processor 920 Motherboard Intel X58 Chipset (x16, or x8 + x8) Graphics nVidia GTX260 SC with 896MB memory Memory 3x2G 1600MHz DDR3 gaming memory Hard Drive 500GB 7200RPM SATA Optical Drive 22x DVD+/-RW Chassis ANTEC Nine Hundred Ultimate Gamer Case Power Supply 850W Power Supply Operating System Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit Obv I save some money on the first one and I get a really capable machine. But i'm thinking in a year and half or two years am I going to wish I spent a little more and got the better system, faster CPU and better graphics card??? Is it worth it spend that much more on the processor? The socket for the i5 is actaully newer, so does that mean it will be more upgradable? which one will likely be more upgradeable??? ...because I could spend the extra money on a second video card instead. Just wondering what the more knowledgeable ppl think about it, thanks in advance

That would game nicely anything we have today and at 600 bucks less I have money in the bank for 2 years from now. Bob

The i5 doesn't do hyperthreading and is currently limited to only one processor. As for your comment &quot;But i'm thinking in a year and half or two years am I going to wish I spent a little more and got the better system, faster CPU and better graphics card???&quot; I'd bet that, if you spent the extra cash how, in a year and a half or two you'd be looking around at what's new and still be wanting a newer faster system.
