i can't even get that far.
and every time i run checkdisk it just give me lots of errors like this: the disk does not have enough space to replace bad clusters detected in file 3248 of name \music\artists\phanto~1\ph0781~1.wma.
anything i can do to fix that?
i still have 20 gb free space on the drive.
is it fixing the problem?
