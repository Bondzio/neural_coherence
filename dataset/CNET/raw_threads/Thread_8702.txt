I started a small at home business of taking digital pictures of weddings, family portraits, school pictures and things like that. I am getting more shoots than I ever thought I would and my AMD 4200 and 3 gigs of pc3200 ram is just too slow. I will be changing the mother board, Ram and CPU, but don't know if I should be looking at a duel or quad core processor. It will be a Intel and so far I have looked at a E8600 duel core processor. Also my computer has the built in card reader does that make a difference? I am using a Sandisk Extreme III CF card for the camera. I am running Windows Vista home premium and Adobe CS3 Any advise would be appreciated. Thanks Wayne

Then once I do the editing and click save, it may take 20 to 30 sec before I can save each picture into a folder which takes another 20 to 30 sec. I don't count the time it takes for editing as I shoot in RAW and I know that takes a little longer to process the pictures. You gave me advise awhile back about the 3 gig switch which did help, but as I am doing more of this now I would like to get it done faster if possible. Thanks again. Wayne
