(note: it was 54c on cpu beforetaking it to bestbuy.) so i have a few things suggesting power supply overheating and a few saying CPU overheating. please, can anyone give me suggestions. if any further info is need please ask.

Yours is beyond this so I'd at least leave the cover off until you can get some fresh heatsink compound. Then I'd get the HSF off, clean and put on the fresh compound. I can't count how many times I'd seen a tech remove the HSF, look at it and put it back on without even a small drop of compound to help fill in the voids they created. Bob

It has enough clues plus a story to have me to think about something specific to try. And yes, the new techs at many &quot;shops&quot; will think nothing of pulling off the heatsink to look and of course it works fine &quot;in the shop.&quot; You made the &quot;perfect&quot; post and put the advice to good use. Best of continued self made luck! Bob
