To solve it, I would start with a clean install of Windows (back to factory conditions, be sure you have a BACKUP of EVERYTHING you don't want to lose). If the problem persists, it's a hardware issue. Otherwise it's solved. Kees

If its working properly so maybe it is problem with your operating system. Some file might be corrupt. I was facing the same problem last month then I got windows reinstalled into my pc and never see the problem again.
