I'll write &quot;unlikely.&quot; But the issue is well known that some desktop replacement laptops are not suited for lap use since the surface temperature can reach scalding heights.
Unlike a desktop which can be built by many, laptops are hopefully engineered design pieces that are rated to operate withing some range of temperature and in the case of those desktop replacement notebooks, should be on a desktop.
