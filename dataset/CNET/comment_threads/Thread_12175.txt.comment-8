You have the right idea but do not use disks ; they involve a lot of swapping back & forth & if one gets a little scratch you wind up with a set of 'coasters'.
Use the Maxtor +flash drive.
Your help on the Maxtor should be on the disk itself.
By opening it from 'my computer' you will see them.
If not there you can download them from Maxtor/Seagate (who brought Maxtor.
Good luck!
