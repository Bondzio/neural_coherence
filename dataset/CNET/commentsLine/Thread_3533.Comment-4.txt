there was a topic over in the asus forums that this is do to a bad chipset on this onboard audio..i have the same problem.
i use teamspeak for gaming and its been a nightmare....this is the second asus mb purchase and the first one was the a8nslidelux and i had to return to asus for a 4week repair job....looks like i will be contacting asus and get a rta to send it back in...:(....my last asus purchase!
peace!
