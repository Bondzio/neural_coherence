I have a wired desktop and a wireless laptop (both XP) going througha linksys router to the internet. I have file sharing turned on and shared folders on both computers; but, I can only access the folders on the laptop. I can see the folders of both my desktop and laptop when I look at Network Neighborhood on both PCs but can't access the folders on the desktop through Network Neighborhood (on either computer). Everytime I get the error &quot;XXX is not accessible.&quot; Both are on the same workgroup and I never changed the permissions of the folder on the desktop. I know for a fact that the shared folders have worked in the past, but I don't know what happened. Oh, and the printer works fine on the shared network. It is connected to my desktop and I can print to it from my laptop. Please help!
