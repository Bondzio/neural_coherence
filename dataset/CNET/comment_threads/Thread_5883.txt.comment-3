Thanks for the help and advice, Willy.
OK, i took the pc to a computer specialist...just to confirm.
It is the mobo that's giving problems.
it's the one playing up... probably a chip or track or something on the board is burnt or damaged.
so the best thing to do now is buy a new m/b.
So this case is officially closed.
anyone else who faces the same problem can learn a thing or two from this thread... cheers!
