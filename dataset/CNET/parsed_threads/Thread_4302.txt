<s> When turning the computer on I get a series of beeps. </s>
<s> One long and 2 short and the computer doesn't boot up. </s>
<s> For my Bios that is the beep code for a problem with the on board graphics. </s>
<s> I have talked with emachines support and they had me unplug and re seat every thing that could be re-seated. </s>
<s> I was then instructed to get a new graphics card. </s>
<s> I bought a new readon 9250 graphics card and installed it. </s>
<s> I get the same beeps and the computer continues to not boot up. </s>
<s> I can not get any kind of screen on the monitor and it seems as though I can not enter safe mode to disable the on board graphics. </s>
<s> Any clue as to what I should try? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> By the way I should mention that this problem occured then after a week all of sudden and then some one powered down my computer and it went back to the beeps and no booting up. </s>
<s> I tried the following: To disable on-board devices you need to be into the BIOS setup, not Windows in safe or any other mode. </s>
<s> To get into the BIOS you usually hold down the DEL key as soon as you power-on, and keep it pressed until the blue BIOS setup screen appears. </s>
<s> If DEL doesn't do it, try F1 or some other F key. </s>
<s> When in the BIOS category page, highlight ''Integrated Peripherals'' then press Enter to open that page. </s>
<s> You should see an entry for 'on-board video' - press 'Page Up' or 'Page Down' key till it says 'Disabled'. </s>
<s> Press 'Esc' key to get back to main category page - then press F10 (usually) to save and exit. </s>
<s> If you get a prompt ''Save and Exit (Y/N)? </s>
<s> '', be sure to press the 'Y'then press ENTER. </s>
<s> PC will re-boot. </s>
<s> You may have to remove and re-install drivers for new card AFTER making sure that integrated video driver is uninstalled from device manager first. </s>
<s> This did not work. </s>
<s> I still get the beep code and nothing displays in my monitor. </s>
<s> Any idea about what else I can try or what may be wrong? </s>
<s> so do u have a screen at all? </s>
<s> try starting it up on the integrated gfx...then in win, go control panel, then system, then hardware, device manager, then display adapter and then disable the integrated graphics. </s>
<s> i'm not sure it is a video problem because u mentioned being able to get into the bios so u must have gotten a screen </s>
<s> I tried to get into the BIOS but couldn't. </s>
<s> I do not get any kind of screen at all. </s>
<s> The monitor goes into power save mode. </s>
<s> Sorry for the misunderstanding. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I have tried with it connected to both the onboard graphics and the graphics card with the same result. </s>
<s> No screen. </s>
<s> It is like it isn't even getting to the part of the boot up process that will let me get into the bios menu. </s>
<s> No matter what I have tried I get the same BIOS beep code and nothing on the monitor. </s>
