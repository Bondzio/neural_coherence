In my experience, cases that come with power supplies often times like to rip you off and give you crap.
Antec I would trust, and lite-on, yeah maybe I'd trust them too.
But an alternate solution would be to buy a case without a PSU, take the money you save on that, and buy a PSU of your choice.
That's how I always do it.
and the 350 watts is kinda low for your hardware.
Definetly go higher, it never hurts.
Hehe, if you can get an xp 3000 i dont think an extra 50-60 will hurt?
then again maybe im wrong.
