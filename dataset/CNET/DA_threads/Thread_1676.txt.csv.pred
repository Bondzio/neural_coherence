1.1.1	Let me say in advance , I thank you for any advice you may have for me .	Polite
1.1.2	I currently have Compaq SR1910NX that has an ASUS A8N-LA ( NAGAMI2L ) motherboard with 2 GB of RAM .	St
1.1.3	I am having trouble multitasking so I did a little research online .	St
1.1.4	I have learned from multiple sites that the A8N-LA motherboard will support an AMD Athlon 64x2 cpu .	St
1.1.5	I would like to know if this is in fact true and if I would gain any noticeable difference in my computer with the swap .	St
1.1.6	I am confident in my ability to swap the cpu 's however I am concerned that I will need to alter the BIOS settings .	St
1.1.7	Can anyone point me in the right direction ?	Ques
1.1.8	Again , Thank You for your advice .	St
1.2.1	I neglected to include in the original question that I currently have an AMD Sempron 3200+ cpu ( socket 939 )	St
1.3.1	I have an ASUS A8N-Sli Deluxe with an AMD64 X2 4800+ A new CPU will drop into the socket but may not work at all , may work partially but not ever show the correct CPU info or may work as it should in any PC with a correct BIOS .	St
1.3.2	See if you can find if Compaq made a version of your system with an Athlon CPU and check for the BIOS updates .	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I 'm actually getting ready to do a very similar upgrade .	St
1.4.2	It should work .	St
1.4.3	Just ensure that you have the latest BIOS flashed onto the motherboard .	St
1.4.4	Problem with 939s is that you really do n't have far up to go .	St
1.4.5	You might be able to go dual-core or 64-bit , but will your software take advantage of it ?	Ques
1.4.6	For the longest time , I just clocked my Sempron up a bit .	St
1.4.7	The only reason I 'm even doing my upgrade is because I 'm using Windows 7 64-bit and doing lots of audio and video encoding .	St
1.4.8	Before you even consider a major hardware refresh , do the following .	St
1.4.9	1 .	St
1.4.10	Ensure you are running a clean and organized system .	St
1.4.11	A P4 system full of malware will run substantially slower than a clean P3 system .	St
1.4.12	Registry errors , unnecessary services , and disk fragmentation will do the same thing .	St
1.4.13	2 .	St
1.4.14	Ensure that the CPU is the bottleneck .	St
1.4.15	Watch your Task Manager closely .	St
1.4.16	Check the Resource Monitor .	St
1.4.17	Are you sure the bottleneck is n't the hard drive ?	Ques
1.4.18	Is ReadyBoost a viable option ?	Ques
1.4.19	3 .	St
1.4.20	Try overclocking what you 've got .	St
1.4.21	If you rarely push the hardware and you have decent cooling , you can get up to 20 % gains .	St
1.4.22	The PC I 'm posting from runs at 100 % most of the time ( due to grid computing software ) , and I clocked the Sempron 3200+ up to 2.2 GHZ ( from 1.9 GHZ ) .	St
1.4.23	4 .	St
1.4.24	Ensure that your software would take advantage of a better chip .	St
1.4.25	Windows previous to Vista really did n't , especially multi-core .	St
1.4.26	64-bit will generally just limit your hardware support .	St
1.4.27	If you really need an upgrade and really feel that THIS is what you want , grab the latest BIOS from HP and take it for a spin .	St
1.4.28	What do you have to lose ?	Ques
1.4.29	Are there really any expensive socket 939 chips out any more , anyway ?	Ques
1.5.1	you should be good to go .	St
1.5.2	See here on your motherboard : http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? docname=c00683218 & lc=en & dlc=en & cc=us & product=3184155 It lists the AMD Athlon 64 X2 as supported .	St
1.5.3	Good luck finding one , though .	Polite
1.5.4	Try EBay .	St
1.5.5	You will see quite a difference in performance from what you now have .	St
