But not one code from a blue screen so I'm going to write it's some overtaxed power supply.
I see various sites write about 100 Watts just for this card and http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/7000/7770/Pages/radeon-7770.aspx#3 asks for a 500 Watt or better PSU.
While I'm inside I'd replace the CPU heatsink compound and ask the machine's maker about BIOS updates and compatibility.
