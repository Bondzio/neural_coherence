if the osx is dates it can't see the ntfs (file system) and files.
current versions can see ntfs volumes just fine.
there is also other solutions like having a friend with a pc copy then out to dvd or another hdd.
i've used linux (ubuntu to be specific) to connect 2 hdds, one in ntfs and the other in afs and drag the files over.
macfuse is worth some research if your osx is outdated.
