while there are loyal android users, i don't know any that have also used apple devices (it seems once an apple user, always an apple user).
after looking through your list it seems like an ipad is the way to go.
imo if you go with something else you're either going to disappointed, or you're not going to be aware of what you're missing.
make sure you pick up a nice, solid case for your new tablet too.
cheers, chase
