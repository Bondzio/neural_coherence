The trick is to read the auction carefully, and send a note with any questions. If you do not get a response back that is sometimes a bad sign. I have not purchased anything as expensive as a PC off of ebay, but have bought 60+ things over the last 3-4 years and have not had problems yet. BUT I think if you use PayPal they have something where you can get the 4 back I believe.
