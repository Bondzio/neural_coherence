click 'start' go to control panel.
click on ' add remove' find the nero and roxio.
click on one and then answer yes to uninstall.
then do the other.
then - do what i sugested b4 and get rid of the cd/dvd drives.
then the rest to get new drivers loaded.
doing a backup now will also be saveing all the problems.
if you wish - you can backup selectively by folder to save your data.
so far you have been given some other good advice.
u can get a good seagate hard drive in an external usb port case to backup stuff to.
but lets try the simple stuff first.
cant hurt.
