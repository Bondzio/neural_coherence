<s> I recently set up my wireless router (a linksys wireless B cable/DSL router) and I have cable for the internet. </s>
<s> Well everything seems to be working fine (the cable is connected to me Dell computer, and the wireless is only used by my new HP notebook), but I can't share files across the internet with people. </s>
<s> You see, I have this internet program called winMX, where you can share pictures, movies, music, etc. </s>
<s> Of course I only download pictures. </s>
<s> It seems that recently since Ive got the wireless router connected that only I can download pictures off of people, yet, no one can download pictures from me. </s>
<s> And that is the problem, before I could download pictures from others, and others could download pics from me, yet now no one can download from me. </s>
<s> Does anyone have answers as to why others cant download off of me now? </s>
<s> could it be because of the wireless network I set up? </s>
<s> WinMX uses 2 ports(I'm not sure which two but you can look in the options\settings in the menu) a TCP and a UDP. </s>
<s> You'll have to get into you DSL router and turn those ports on. </s>
