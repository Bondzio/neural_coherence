968	0	21873	236550	NR	showtime48	5/4/04 11:21 PM	1.08371286E12	Power Supply	Does anyone know if you can take a p/s right out of the box, put it on the counter, plug it in and everything should work fine or does it have to be installed? I bought a 400w coolmax and when I plugged it in the fan ran for a second and shut down. Both on the counter and in the case. No other cables connected. Thanks

However I am not in the PC build-it/fix-business.

I assume when you say, &quot;does it have to be installed?&quot; that all the required wire harness were hooked-up and if so and it still did that either an improper connection or bad unit. I exclude any possible mtrb(system) problem besides the p/s, as if that's the reason you brought it the 1st place? good luck -----Willy

An ATX supply is actually turned on via the motherboard. The switch on the back of the supply, if any, only switches on/off the AC going into the supply. To test on the bench, you need first attach a &quot;load&quot; to the supply to prevent damage, then jumper pins 14 and 15 to start the supply. PLEASE DO NOT try this if you are not comfortable playing around with electricity! See http://www.compute-aid.com/atxspec.html for more info.
968	6	21873	237453	237139	Willy	5/5/04 5:35 PM	1.0837785E12	Load required still	You need a true load whether it be the actual mtrbd. or a &quot;dummy load&quot; sold for that purpose. http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com shows such a device. Other vendors offer it as it as well, probably called an ATX p/s dummy/load tester. I believe http://www.computergeeks.com has it as well. good luck -----Willy
