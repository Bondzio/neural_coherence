<s> I just bought a Samsung HD204UI, which is a 2 Terabyte hard drive. </s>
<s> When I plugged it all in my computer installed a driver for it. </s>
<s> I run Windows 7 on a Dell XPS Gen 5. </s>
<s> It's been updated with a few more hard drives as well as 4 gigs of ram and a new graphics card. </s>
<s> It seems to me that it, for whatever reason, thought it was a blu-ray player and installed the blu-ray player driver. </s>
<s> I looked on the Samsung site for a driver specific to this hard drive but to no avail. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what I should do or where I should look? </s>
<s> Should I call Samsung or Microsoft? </s>
<s> Will either of them actually help me? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> Typical HD install doesn't require a driver, though the system should be ready for it. </s>
<s> I suggest you check the Dell support website and verify what bios updates maybe present for your model#. </s>
<s> While there query their support forum on this topic. </s>
<s> If bios status is behind, do the update it *may* address the problem. </s>
<s> If possible see what the bios update actually addresses. </s>
<s> But since, you have a 2.1Tb HD, that alone makes it somehow unique. </s>
<s> To add further all the other devices just stacks on the issue if they are related at all. </s>
<s> It maybe treating the HD as a BR drive only because the capacity issues or is close to what BR is and defaults to it. </s>
<s> Samsung may offer a FAQ on this topic, query or review their support website. </s>
<s> How is it treated as a BR player, is there an actual message/error/display to that effect? </s>

<s> edited from WWW... -- Start your computer and enter the BIOS. </s>
<s> -- Get your motherboard manual and check sections -- Do you see the Blu-ray and the HDD on your computer screen? </s>
<s> If not, try changing your SATA configuration - open screen in your BIOS. </s>
<s> -- Configure SATA as AHCI(if present) -- Save and exit the BIOS. </s>

<s> Thanks a lot for the advice. </s>
<s> I will let you know what happens when I get the chance to try it. </s>
<s> I wonder if the BR player software was set for that drive letter and when you added this new drive it thought &quot;aha!&quot; </s>
<s> How would I go about checking that? </s>
<s> Because my computer says that I have 3 CD drives (I only have two) and 4 Hard Drives. </s>
<s> It see the new one, but it won't come up in &quot;My Computer&quot; and it also won't let me into it. </s>
<s> Also, within Device Manager it says Disk: Disk 3 Type: Unknown Status: Not Initialized Partition Style: Not Applicable Capacity 1907729 MB Unallocated Space: 0 MB Reserved Space: 0 MB The &quot;Type&quot;, &quot;Status&quot; and &quot;Unallocated Space&quot; ones seem wrong to me. </s>
<s> Do you know how to fix these? </s>
<s> or change which drive letter it is? </s>
<s> I figured it out once but have since completely forgeten how also, the drive is 2.0 TB not 2.1 Thank you again. </s>
<s> I re-read this post and can't tell where you prepared this drive. </s>
<s> A new drive is often BLANK and will do as you have written. </s>
<s> Tell the forum how you partition and format a new drive. </s>
<s> I do this with the OS's tools. </s>
<s> For Windows this might be Disk Management. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, I fixed it. </s>
<s> Many thanks to R. Proffitt for pointing me to Disk Management. </s>
<s> I just sort of poked around in there for a bit and my computer all of a sudden recognized that the hard drive was there. </s>
<s> What I did in Disk Management was tell it to create a new volume within the disk that was going to be the entire thing. </s>
<s> I told it to go ahead and do a not quick format, which seemed to be taking forever, so I stopped it. </s>
<s> Then, my &quot;My Computer&quot; found the hard drive, and decided that it wasn't formatted and that I should format it, which I did. </s>
<s> Quick this time. </s>
<s> My computer still however thinks that there is a shiny new blue ray player, but I suppose apart from not being able to use Disk Letter &quot;H&quot; it's not really an inconvenience. </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone for the help! </s>
<s> Sorry it got fixed just by me messing around. </s>
