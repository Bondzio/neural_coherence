No reviews at http://www.epinions.com/pr-Pacific_Image_Prime-Film_3650u_Flim_Scanner For now, I'll keep noting the Coolscan. Such as http://www.epinions.com/Nikon_Coolscan_IV_ED_APS_Film_Adapter__Scanners_9296 But look at the other coolscan units too. Bob

Unless you can get some better feedback from users, I'd not buy one. P.S.: Unless I can get a refund, or get it working, I'll have a new, unused one avialable real cheap, real soon!

I'm running on an HP with Windows XP, don't think my computer is the problem. When scanning slides, I get half the photo green, half red. Anybody have any idea what would be causing this? It's a brand new scanner, I have yet to have any useable scans completed. Grrrrrr...

My issue is that occassionally I get colored bars that run parallel to the long (width) of the slide. I have yet to find its cause and a consistant method of fixing the problem. The4se bar may cover the entire slide or may show only a few in varried positions, but always apparllel along the width. IBM T43 with 1Gb RAM and 80 Gb HD in Windows Explorer Professional. Is there as help out there on this matter? Uncle Marty
