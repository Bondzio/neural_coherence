there are newer motherboards with three pci express x16 slots.
even though all will fit an x16 sized card or smaller, it's common for at least one of the slots to be less than x16 electrically.
that means that you could install an x16 card into the bottom x16 slot, but it will operate with a maximum of, say, x8 or x4 bandwidth (depending on how the slot is wired).
check the motherboard's specifications and manual to learn what the types of slots you have.
