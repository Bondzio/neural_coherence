1.1.1	I recently discovered the SMC Barricade broadband router I use does not allow me to log the IP addresses of external clients accessing an apache web server which sits behind the router .	St
1.1.2	Is there some special protocol or feature I should look for in a router so that I can log external IP addresses , or can anyone just point me to any SOHO routers that can do this ?	Ques
1.1.3	thanks.kah	St
1.2.1	And does it send items to SYSLOG ?	Ques
1.2.2	Your post neglated details so I ca n't answer .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	but I do n't think that 's too important .	St
1.3.2	Logging external IP addresses is a known limitation of all SMC SOHO routers ( according to them ) , so I 'm looking for a replacement router which can log external IP addresses , or at least a term or feature that I can use to look for a replacement .	St
1.3.3	thanks again.kah	Polite
1.4.1	I 'll go get the manual and read about it .	St
1.4.2	I hope you do the same and pay attention to any mention of SYSLOG .	St
1.4.3	In closing , should I reply without details I feel are not important ?	Ques
1.4.4	Or should I toss in a little extra to make sure you can solve this ?	Sug

1.5.1	http : //www.monitorware.com/Common/en/stepbystep/sample-syslog-device-configs-MWA12.php shows an example of not your model router to turn on the SYSLOG output .	St
1.5.2	Then you could look up WINSYSLOG to catch the results and filter them as you see fit .	St
1.5.3	Cheers , Bob	St
1.6.1	I appreciated your help , but maybe I have n't explained what I 'm interested in .	Polite
1.6.2	I simply want to purchase a router which will pass external IP addresses to an apache server log , or allow something like phpbb to associated external IP addresses to posts .	St
1.6.3	I just need to know what to look for when I 'm shopping for a new router .	St
1.6.4	thanks.kah	St
1.7.1	The SYSLOG feature is what does this .	St
1.7.2	Maybe details are important to understand this , but you wrote that details are not .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	Okay , I get I should apologize , or something , for saying the details of my existing router are not important .	St
1.8.2	I only wrote that since SMC says my router , and none of their routers , will do what I want .	St
1.8.3	SYSLOG is new to me , so I 'm reading up on it .	St
1.8.4	You 're suggesting that somehow by using SYSLOG , the IP addresses which are logged in my apache access log file ( and by extension the IP addresses sent to applications like phpbb ) will be the actual external IP addresses of the clients accessing my server instead of the IP address of my server itself ?	Ques
1.8.5	thanks.kah	St
1.9.1	SMC 7004AWBR with firmware 1.41.004 was noted as not passing the IP address in 2003 .	St
1.9.2	Here again the details are causing me pause .	St
1.9.3	Maybe they fixed that in later firmware ?	Ques
1.9.4	There is also a chance that MANY routers will never pass the IP address even if a HTTP PROXY setting is enabled or disabled .	St
1.9.5	You have n't told how you set yours or the firmware version .	St
1.9.6	I now have a complete picture of the issue and grasp what you want to do , but details are important to see whether you are able to flip a setting or it 's a new router for you .	St
1.9.7	Bob	St
