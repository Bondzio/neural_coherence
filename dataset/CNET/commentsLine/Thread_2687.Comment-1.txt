i moved from europe to the us a couple of months ago, and none of my wireless network devices was working as well as before.
i blamed the building materials or other equipment in our appartment, but now we moved to a new house and have the same problem.
i have been trying with 5 different routers/ap's, and all have the same problem: if there is a wall between the device and laptop there is hardly any reception, and the connection drops completely or get extremely slow every 15 minutes or so.
if there is nothing between the device and laptop, i still have to limit the distance to 5 ft to get more than 50% signal strength.
in europe i always got more than 80%, even through concrete and brick.
here it's only drywall and wood.
the same problem exists when bridging between two netgear ap's/bridges (so the problem is not the laptops...) does anyone know if there is anything different in the us that can cause this problem?
interference from other household appliances, other building materials, or simply being on another part of the earth?
details: used routers and ap's: - netgear wnhde111 (3 different ones) - trendnet tew-639gr - zyxel nbg4614 used laptops: 3 different dell laptops - running windows 7 (prof 64 bit; home 64 bit; ultimate 32 bit) all with intel wireless adapter
