complete and utter crap also i'm going by THG's non-AA/non-AF tests as hardly any previous generation mid-range card can handle that with newer games the FX 5600 vs 9600Pro is unfair, the 9600Pro is more capable (kinda odd that an ATi card got beat by a GeForce FX in AA/AF testing (normally Radeon 9 whipped GeForce FX in AA/AF) i'd avoid the 5600 though the 5700 is faster than the 5600 Ultra, and is roughly on par with the 9600Pro
