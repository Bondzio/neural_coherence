you can use google.com to research what a 423 socket cpu looks like as well as a 478 socket cpu.
then you can answer that question.
you post is all i know of your machine's failure.
since you've tried the other ports with known good keyboards... 400 is far too much for this repair.
you can find boards galore for 99 bucks.
i wouldn't do this.
400 gets a new box... with xp...  there are many more out there like this and frankly that repair price is a _____ (pick a word).
