<s> I have inherited an old 500Mhz machine that I am looking to turn into a media server. </s>
<s> It came with a 10GB HD, so for obvious reasons, I'm looking to increase the storage. </s>
<s> I have found a 300 GB ATA/133 that I am interested in, but I don't know if my machine can handle it. </s>
<s> Are there maximums for a machine's HD size? </s>
<s> Also, before I buy a hard drive, I want to make sure it has a compatible interface. </s>
<s> I know my machine works with ATA drives, and this drive says it uses parallel ATA. </s>
<s> Is this the same thing? </s>
<s> My machine is a HP Pavillion 6630. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> They both are the same thing, PATA and ATA. </s>
<s> You should be good to go with the 300gb, but to make sure: What OS are you using? </s>
<s> And you are putting the 300GB on the NTFS file type, correct? </s>
<s> Sometimes old OS's won't allow or won't recognize the full size of the hard drive. </s>

<s> Not even worth to turn into a server, with those low specs. </s>
<s> How long would it take to upload the files... 300gb could take weeks, non-stop. </s>

<s> I agree with Roger, making a media server out of that??? </s>
<s> Go try but you won't have any fun. </s>
<s> You can get a new computer or build one your own. </s>
<s> Those older PIII systems almost always need to have an ATA/100 or ATA/133 hard disk controller card added to a PCI slot to use drives over 137GB. </s>
<s> You also need an operating system that supports large HS's. </s>

<s> I would not sink much money into it. </s>
<s> $$$ Harddrive + more memory ++++Etc = You can buy a cheap computer and have a machine that will work for you a lot better. </s>
<s> Some media cameras, mp3 players want USB 2.0 or you will need alot of patience. </s>
<s> Read some of your media apps requirements they also may want a bigger system. </s>
<s> I have 2 desktops that are 400 mhz they are great for the kids to surf the net and play older games. </s>
<s> I won't upgrade the computers. </s>
<s> I bought myself a new Computer and they have the older ones. </s>
<s> it just not worth it to turn that old thing into a media server. </s>
<s> like everyone else said---slow -slow and just slow-!! </s>
<s> u could just buy an emachine desktop for $550 emachines are not bad as ppl think they are. </s>
<s> they have good quality with bring cheap. </s>
<s> i had a dell and then i bought another desktop (e-machines) everything is awesome - i am gamer and so i buy a lot of PC games and emachines never let me down. </s>
<s> i actually got it for multimedia purposes and it has never ever let me down except for the fact that i have been having problem with burning from cd-r/dvd combo drive but they have a really good tech support. </s>
<s> and it wasn't the computer's fault either. </s>
<s> the person from the tech support said that i mus have downloaded some software and when i uninstalled it, it probably deleted some of my file, and the tech person gave me instructions on how to solve it, too. </s>
<s> also, i download a lot of free software from internet especially from download.com and unistall a lot of them, too and the comp. </s>
<s> never caused any problems in that either. </s>
<s> for $550, u will probably get (if u look for deal in flyers--there are many every two weeks of so) 1gig DDRAM atleast 160gig HDD Microsoft Media Center 2005 (i recommened it) some good graphics card (probably ATI) wat else do u need???!!! </s>
<s> i hope this helps! </s>
