For some reason, my wireless receiver decided to stop working this morning.
It's not a battery problem, otherwise the receiver would still light up.
I still get power to the receiver, since I can still charge my mouse, and I sincerely doubt my USB ports died during the night.
I can't get by the BIOS since it doesn't detect a keyboard.
Any advice?
It's a shame when expensive stuff doesn't work.
