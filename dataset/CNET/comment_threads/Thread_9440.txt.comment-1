Hi,everyone, I am looking for a new desktop and need some advice.
Currently my computer is hook up to TV as the monitor and I feel the video card is not good enough because it is blurry and I have tried to change the setting, but it still not clear on file name but all other looks fine.
I always have a hard time to see the file name on the desktop.
So what kind of video card is good when the desktop is hook up to the TV.
Also if I brought a new PC that don't have S-video card to hook up to the TV, can I take the s-video card from the old pc and install to the new PC.
I will appreciated if anyone can give me some advice on what to look for when I shop around for a new PC.
Many Thanks
