many berate the printer companies for printers that only last a few years, but the prices have come a long way so some slack is needed.
do we really need to return to 1,000 dollar printers so you can get 10 years of use?
-&gt; about your ink on the paper issue.
it's this simple.
some ink is on a roller, guide or another part along the paper path.
if you can't clean it up, then you buy a new printer.
