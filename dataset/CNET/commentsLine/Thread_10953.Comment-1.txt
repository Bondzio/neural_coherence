after installing and uninstalling a hard drive, and installing a 56k modem, whenever i boot up the pc i get the message - &quot;com a configuration changed&quot;, then the option to press f1 to resume or f10 to enter set-up.
everything looks fine in the settings, i have even tried resetting defaults.
pc works fine when resuming, but the boot process stops until f1 or f10 is pressed.
i installed the 2nd hard drive to move from old pc (p90 dell) to the compaq.
pc is a compaq presario 4528, 233 mgh, 32 mg ram, 3 gig hard drive, win95 platform.
thanks for any help someone can provide.
