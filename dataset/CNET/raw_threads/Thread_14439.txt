Because of that, i only found one networking card that works, well sorta works. Its a piece of s**t. Last week, my friend convinced me to try Linux. So now i have a dual boot system. So since i have a 32bit version of Linux running, i wanna throw in a D-Link wifi card that i just bought that does not work with my windows so i figure i would throw it in my computer and use it for my linux. Well when i did that, i booted into windows and because i had 2 wifi cards in here, the original one didnt work. I even disabled the d-link one in device manager and the working refused to find my router. Is there a way this can be done?
