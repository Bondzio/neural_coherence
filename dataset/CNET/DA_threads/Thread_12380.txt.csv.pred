1.1.1	I am planning on buying a new gaming computer soon-ish , and I would need to decide which hard drive configuration I should get for optimal speed , with out breaking the bank .	St
1.1.2	My options are 1 ) dual Western Digital 7200RPM configured to RAID 0 or 2 ) WD Raptor 10k RPM + a seperate 7200 for storage Now , config # 2 is actually a bit more expensive than the dual 7200RPM , and I know RAID 0 adds speed by combining the read/write speeds , etc , but I dont know enough to make an informed decision without help .

1.1.3	Thanks in advance , zach	St
