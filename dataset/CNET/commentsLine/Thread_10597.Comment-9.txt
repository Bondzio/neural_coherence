i have the same issue.
i have put the drive into my pc and it saw it as unallocated space.
i then mounted it.
and so far i have tried everything to fix it with no luck.
it just will not take again.
maxtor said it had to be an ext3 partition so i put it into linux and formatted it back.
then placed it into the drive and still it will not recognize the drive even after a reset.
can someone help i know i must be able to get it back to life.
i tried this
