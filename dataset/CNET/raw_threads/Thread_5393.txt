Hard disks now can be enormous. I have a couple of internal 1 TB hard disks and if ever I feel I have to reformat them I would prefer to physically break them up first with an axe, then burn them, I know that attempting to reformat such large capacity hard drives will take my system hours, if not days. I intend to avoid that for as long as possible. So, your external hard drive. How large is it? I suspect that, in any case, data transfer speed to and from a USB connection may be slower than an internal cable, so a reformat may be slower to begin with, but I am prepared to be corrected if my surmise is incorrect. The other issues you mention seem to be unfortunate. It is a difficult way to learn about computers, hardware, maintenance and general usage. Mark

I have never defragged it or reformatted it. But beware, like any hard disks, USB hard disks can fail too, at any time, so don't use it as your only backup copy. USB hard disks are relatively cheap so may be you could get another? Mark
