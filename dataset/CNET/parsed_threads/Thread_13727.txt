<s> Hello everyone, I'm kinda desperate here. </s>
<s> In the beginning of the year my almost new 500 GB HD (in a 2010 MacBook Pro) crashed. </s>
<s> I replaced it. </s>
<s> Then my refurbished airport extreme (new) crashed also. </s>
<s> Apple replaced it for me. </s>
<s> I blamed the refurbishing (&quot;never gonna get refurbished any more&quot;). </s>
<s> Then, last week, the Airpot board of my MacBook Pro went out. </s>
<s> The Mac simply didn't recognize it anymore!! </s>
<s> I sent it to Apple and they said I have to replace it. </s>
<s> Now, incredibly, I come back home and my brand new Airport Extreme (that which apple gave me for my refurbished) also stopped working! </s>
<s> Suspecting of electrical problems in my apartment I bought last week a power stabilizer (I don't know how you call it in english), which I didn't have. </s>
<s> But it seems it didn't work out, since now my Airport failed on me..... </s>
<s> Anyone got an idea here?? </s>
<s> I'm seriously considering moving away from this apartment, since the building is not very trustworthy, and since in 10 years I got almost no problems with Apple whatsoever, and then this year all my hardware is failing on me!! </s>
<s> Thank you very much for the attention, and forgive my english. </s>

<s> Just sort of throwing out the idea but, if the hard drive was just a normal failure, all the other things seem to be related to wireless, I have to wonder if there is a chance that there may be some strong RF signals hitting your apartment. </s>
<s> Possibilities might be television or radio transmitters, maybe a new cell tower in the immediate vicinity, amateur radio operator in your building, microwave transmitters (or even a malfunction mw oven? </s>
<s> ), aircraft tracking radar, or military transmitters all come to mind. </s>
<s> I had a problem where something from a nearby airport was blasting my TV and making reception of UHF signals fail about every 12 seconds. </s>
<s> Then one day, and I did nothing at all different, the problem cleared itself. </s>
<s> I say from the airport because the interfering signal became less noticeable if I swung my antenna away from the direction of the airport but it was still present. </s>
<s> I would also consider that someone else with wireless in your immediate area my be coming up on the same channel your system is trying to use and causing some conflicts. </s>
<s> Do you have the same kind of problems if you use your MBP away from your home? </s>
