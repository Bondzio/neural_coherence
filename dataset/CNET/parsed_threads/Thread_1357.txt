<s> I am running an AMD 2600+ on EPOX 3RDA+ NForce2 board. </s>
<s> Every time during installation finalising stage of windows XP professional the computer will shut down automatically during the Finalizing Installation stage. </s>
<s> And it won't be able to power on unless I take out the processor and put it back again. </s>
<s> I suspect it is either MB problem or processor problem. </s>
<s> (tried installing server 2003 and same problem occurs) Anyone have experienced this problem before can confirm which one is to blame? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The recurring themes are: 1. </s>
<s> Heat. </s>
<s> Remove case cover and try again. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Memory failure. </s>
<s> Try with one stick. </s>
<s> Run memory tests from http://www.memtest86.com 3. </s>
<s> BIOS is not the latest. </s>
<s> New to PC builders don't understand why a new board wouldn't have the latest BIOS. </s>
<s> I can't explain it, but unless the BIOS is latest, you may crash and burn. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> BIOS SAFE DEFAULTS until it's up. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> POWER. </s>
<s> I still see small power supplies driving big rigs. </s>
<s> Easy to test. </s>
<s> Just downsize the machine to one hard disk, one stick o'ram, one CD drive, one video card and try again with the case cover off. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> The WORMS. </s>
<s> A new install of today's Windows will catch a worm infection as soon as you go to install the patches. </s>
<s> Drives people insane. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Check the bios area and reset to defaults, reboot and then configure as needed, be on the safe side though. </s>
<s> Review what the setting is for &quot;heat overtemp&quot; and the action taken if meant. </s>
<s> Don assume, check it/any. </s>
<s> Next, since you reseat the cpu, only way to do that once with orginal heat compound is a no-no multiple times. </s>
<s> In other words, don't trust re-using what the vendor gave you. </s>
<s> Buy a heatsink compound paste, instead of the &quot;heat pad&quot; the OEM provides. </s>
<s> Of course make sure the whole HSF setup is seated and fully engaged. </s>
<s> Overall, I think you got a &quot;heat&quot; problem. </s>
<s> If none of this helps, return the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and cpu, etc., it also suggests bad parts. </s>
<s> Understand, if you handled these wrong, ESD(static) can do strange things as well. </s>
<s> IMHO, Epox brand isn't top rated with me, but that's me. </s>
<s> good luck -----WIlly </s>
