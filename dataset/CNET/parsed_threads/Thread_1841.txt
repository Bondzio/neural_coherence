<s> Hi, I'm trying to retrofit a Compaq Presario 8000Z with new motherboard so I can upgrade my video card and processor. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can tell which motherboards will work for this? </s>
<s> I can even do the research myself if someone knows a good resource to use. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ryan </s>
<s> A friendly shop is your best bet since most of these &quot;computer in a box&quot; systems can use odd size cases, custom power supplies or have some flange that doesn't line up. </s>
<s> You may be looking at a new case/power-supply as well. </s>

<s> I bought a new chip, AMD 64 3000. </s>
<s> Went to AMD web site and researched the chip. </s>
<s> They also had a listing of suggested motherboards to use with this chip. </s>
<s> Probably have similar lists at other chip manufactures web sites. </s>
