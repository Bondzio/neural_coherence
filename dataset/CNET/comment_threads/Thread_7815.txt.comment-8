...and discovered that the native SCSI host adapter is exactly the same as the one I was planning to install on the PCI bus, Apaptec 2940W, a 68-pin output going to the HDD with an unused connector between.
I am planning to install the new BU tape drive in the native SCSI chain, setting the SCSI ID to the proper ID I got from the server's SCSI utility and disabling termination in the tape drive.
Thoughts?
