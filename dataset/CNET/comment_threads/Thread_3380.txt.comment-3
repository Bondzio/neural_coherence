My Dell PC only has USB 1.1.
The Western Digital USB 80bg drive I'm trying to install is USB 2.0 but is &quot;backwards&quot; compatible.
When I first installed out of the box everything worked, drive letter was assigned (I didn't put any data on it).
Then I unpluged it without EJECTING HARDWARE (as I should have).
Then when I plugged it back in, the plug and play recognized it, added it in device manager but &quot;My Computer&quot; now didNOT recognize it.
Since then I've uninstalled all usb hubs/drivers etc in SAFE MODE, restarted Windows XP, plug and play recongnizes all my devices again, but now gives me a message when I attached my USB Drive - &quot;HI SPEED USB Device added to non-hi speed usb&quot; and &quot;Problem with install device may have problems&quot; and now the USB Drive doesNOT show up under Disk Drives in Device Manager and under USB Controllers, there is a yellow exclamation point.
I have SP1 and all updates to WindowXP.
Enough info?
Thanks for any help!
