1.1.1	I recently installed an old Epson 580series printer as indicated by the manufacturer 's CD , where clearly states that it should be used instead the Windows wizard for new hardware .	St
1.1.2	Well , my PC ( Win XP Pro ) & quot ; accepted & quot ; both the drivers and the hardware and everything seemed OK , but now , whwenever I start my PC , it shows the & quot ; New HArdware ... . & quot ; window and asks for its installation .	St
1.1.3	I simply click on & quot ; Cancel & quot ; and things go normal ... printer is still there and working !	St
1.1.4	But how can i tell XP -for good- that there 's already a printer ?	Ques
1.2.1	& quot ; the & quot ; days have gone when you install manufacturer 's driver 's instead of windows driver 's unless they have been certified - those cd 's you have probably were written with win9X in mind .	St
1.2.2	In short delete the driver you have - reboot and see what winxp installs for you - if you are not happy with the winXP version go to & quot ; device manager & quot ; and ask to update the winxp driver - then say have disk and search the cd for the *.inf files - and then force XP to accept the one from the cd ( ignore it if you are told the driver was not written for your printer ) .	St
1.2.3	any problems let me know peter	St
1.3.1	Uninstall printer .	St
1.3.2	then reboot , and let Windows look for a driver .	St
1.3.3	If it 's an older printer , chances are Windows wo n't find a driver for it , and will ask you if you want to install from disk , or other .	St
1.3.4	Then use your CD , and tell Windows to install from there .	St
1.3.5	This should do it for you , and Windows may be happy that it has done it 's job of bugging you	St
1.4.1	Think you said the same thing , but better than I did .	St
1.5.1	Just too close to call for this & quot ; G & quot ; rated forum .	St
1.5.2	No offense please , just too close to call so I deleted it .	Sug
