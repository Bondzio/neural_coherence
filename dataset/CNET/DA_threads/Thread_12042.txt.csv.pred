1.1.1	I was helping my Dad configure things on his PC.	St
1.1.2	It suddenly started to reboot by itself, but nothing appeared on the monitor.	St
1.1.3	I tried to shut it down by pressing the Power button on the tower.	St
1.1.4	When it wouldn't react, I held in the Power button until it started to reboot again.	St
1.1.5	This time all I got from what I believe is the PC speaker is an audible beep that lasts 1/2 second, then repeats about every 5 seconds.	St
1.1.6	The beep is much like you'd hear on public utility equipment when it warns surrouning drivers of its presence.	St
1.1.7	I have no idea whether the hard drive or power supply has failed, or what the problem might be.	Res
1.1.8	This PC is a Pentum III, 450 MHz, Windows XP Home (SP2), with an Asus MB (don't have model no.	St
1.1.9	written donwn), and likely a 40MB hard drive that wasn't nearing capacity last time we checked.	St
1.1.10	An external ION 60MB hard drive is installed that was only added to keep a specific program's records isolated.	St
1.1.11	Other hardware consists of a floppy disk drive and a Creative PC-DVD drive (believe this is a CD/DVD reader only), Microsoft Internet Pro keyboard and Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer mouse.	St
1.1.12	Yes, we know this is an old system, but it's used primarily for e-mail and stock quotes by an elderly couple.	St
1.1.13	Does anyone have any experience with this type of failure, where a repeating audible beep is heard when the tower's Power button is pressed to boot the PC?	Ques
1.1.14	Any clues what might have happened, or what component might be producing the problem?	St
1.2.1	I'm not sure if this will be able to narrow te problem down.	Res
