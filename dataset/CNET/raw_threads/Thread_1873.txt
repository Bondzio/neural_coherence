Firewall is off, I am downloading files wirelessly from Netgear site to laptop, from there I'm etherneted to the router &quot;internet&quot; connection, files seem to transfer to print server, PC does detect EXCELLENT connection and does refresh, still no logon? I may not be connected right or I am setting up dynamic and is not detecting ISPs... MIke

When I was finished, I had to put in the CD for the Printer and tell it I was setting it up for a network printer. It will then ask you how you have it setup. After you select the right answer, it will then install the drivers for you. I don't know if this is what you are looking for or not. Rick
