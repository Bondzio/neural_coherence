01) Can anyone recommend a good monthly cell provider coverage for a built-in 4GWiMax cellular chip that is in a laptop I am thinking of purchasing?
02) I was told that with a built-in 4GWiMax cellular chip that if I am not a light user that there will be bandwidth caps.
What are bandwidth caps and how do I get around them?
03) If the laptop I decide to purchase has a 4GWiMax cellular chip already installed and I have a monthly contract with a provider, will I be able to connect to the internet anywhere/anytime?
