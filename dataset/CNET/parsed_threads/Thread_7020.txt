<s> I have a NFORCE 570 Slit-A motherboard. </s>
<s> I have a single hard drive (250GB) that I have plugged into the SATA1 connector. </s>
<s> I have 2 IDE Channels (one primary and one secondary). </s>
<s> I currently have my DVD RW drive plugged into the secondard IDE channel. </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> I was reading on a post that I need to buy an IDE card for the DVD but I don't see the sense in that if I have 2 IDE's available. </s>
<s> Thank you for your thoughts. </s>

<s> Get a nice 80 conductor IDE cable and from the primary IDE to the master connector on the cable with the drive set to CS plug it in there. </s>

<s> Bob, Is SATA supposed to be faster than IDE? </s>
<s> Also, Would it improve performance by moving the DVD drive to the primary master IDE? </s>
<s> Thanks again for your thoughts. </s>
<s> Tim </s>
<s> And to get the best effect I would use both channels. </s>
<s> -&gt; Yes SATA can be faster but most DVD drives have read limits well below the SATA speeds and even IDE rates. </s>
<s> Let me comment that for XP, installing to a SATA drive (XP retail versions) can be troublesome for some. </s>
<s> If I wanted to make it harder to install I'd give my tech all SATA components. </s>
<s> This changes in Vista but that's another can of worms. </s>
