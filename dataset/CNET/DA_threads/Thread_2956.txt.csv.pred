1.1.1	I've just been given a solid state drive to test out (2.5 inch notebook style hard disk drive).	St
1.1.2	Can I use this with any operating system or am I limited.	St
1.1.3	I'm not sure were to find the information I'm looking?	Res
1.1.4	Which would be the best?	St
1.1.5	Windows Vista/XP/2000?	St
1.1.6	Linux (which distributions would work best)?	St
1.1.7	I have two systems I could install the drive in, either a low-end desktop system or a midrange notebook.	St
1.1.8	Which would be the better way to go?	St
1.1.9	(I was leaning towards the low-end desktop over the notebook though I know it's probably overkill for the system).	St
1.1.10	Thanks for the input.	St
1.1.11	Todd	St
1.2.1	vista won't install on anything smaller than 10gb.	St
1.2.2	xp and 2000 will need about 4gb.	St
1.2.3	for linux, it will depend on the distro and the features you're planning but 4gb should be sufficient for most distros.	St
1.2.4	i think the notebook will benefit most from an ssd since a) it should improve battery life; b) the ssd's read/write speed may be faster than a run-of-the-mill notebook drive but slower than a recent desktop drive; c) the ssd should be a cinch to drop into the laptop.	St
