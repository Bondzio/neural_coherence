<s> I have a GeForce 5200 128mb video card, and the fan has become very noisy, especially on startup. </s>
<s> It is about a year old, but I can't find any warrenty information on it (manufacturer is Interage, purchased at Sam's Club). </s>
<s> My gaming consists of Madden and other sports games. </s>
<s> What can I do with this? </s>
<s> My brother suggests unplugging the fan, but that doesn't sound like a good option to me. </s>
<s> Any information is appreciated. </s>
<s> Sorry to yell, but don't do that. </s>
<s> There are sources for replacement fans such as you see at http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/article/1750/ It's out there. </s>

<s> Replace the fan with a new one.U can find one for a GeForce FX5200 very easily in the market.But never ever unplug the fan or else yor card might get overheated and may damage </s>
