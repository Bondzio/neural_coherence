1.1.1	Hi , My 40G laptop HD has some bad sectors .	St
1.1.2	By trial and error I have been able to isolate the bad area .	St
1.1.3	I have partitioned off the good sector ( 25G ) and left the bad part ( 15G ) unallocated using XP 's disk management tool and reinstalled XP on the 25GB partition .	St
1.1.4	So far its working well .	St
1.1.5	My question is will the bad part spill over to the good part over time and cause problem ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Do n't think I 've ever heard of a hard disk drive with that large a percent of the space bad If that were mine ... I 'd be looking to replace it ASAP .	St
1.3.2	Did you test it with the nfgs diags ?	Ques
1.3.3	Goof Luck	St
1.4.1	Well , probably not .	St
1.4.2	Here 's what I did .	St
1.4.3	I first tried to format the entire disk .	St
1.4.4	XP stalled at the very start ( no 1 % even ) .	St
1.4.5	So I created two partitions , 5GB and 35GB and tried to format the 35GB partition .	St
1.4.6	XP stalled again at the very start .	St
1.4.7	Then I did 10+30 .	St
1.4.8	same result .	St
1.4.9	Then when I did 15+25 , XP quickly showed 1 % , and finished formatting the 25GB on time .	St
1.4.10	Thats what I meant trial and error .	St
1.4.11	I am not a geek and do n't have the time to be .	St
1.4.12	This how I do things .	St
1.4.13	If I could do it better in a non-geeky way ( without a third party SW , specially non-freeware ) I would appreciate letting me know .	St
1.4.14	Thanks	Polite
1.5.1	The point is you got a & quot ; failing HD & quot ; even if it works , enjoy it while you can .	St
1.5.2	The HD will sooner or later entirely fail .	St
1.5.3	I belive you got & quot ; soft errors & quot ; or hard error in a certain spot ( s ) that 's not good but confined .	St
1.5.4	The point is , it just is n't good news .	St
1.5.5	Prepare to replace the HD .	St
1.5.6	Far too often a HD dies for one of these reasons , drops or heat damage .	St
1.5.7	Physical drop of laptop ( ouch ! )	St
1.5.8	or prolonged usage in hot ( not well cooled ) laptop , the HD actaully works for a time but drift starts to phase in and data becomes corrupted and/or the HD heads actually touch the media due to swelling/expansion of media .	St
1.5.9	You may want to try Spinrite to correct or check into it , its about the best recovery HD s/w out ther for the price , if it does n't work , then the HD is a goner for sure .	St
1.5.10	Or save that Spinrite cost and apply to new HD .	St
1.5.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Hi , It is almost impossible to have that many faulty sectors on a HD and still being able to use it .	St
1.6.2	If it is working is is totally unreliable and I would replace it at once before you loose your data .	St
1.6.3	If you know sombody who own 's & quot ; spinrite & quot ; you could run that to see what 's going on .	St
1.6.4	If you have to buy spinrite , skip that and and spent the money on the new HD .	St
1.6.5	Cheers , Joseph .	St
1.7.1	I fully agree that the HDD is on its way to the big scrap bin in the sky - Incinerate it if you can , to destroy your personal data , or smash it flat with a heavy hammer .	St
1.7.2	Spinrite has got to be the absolute best in surface recovery .	St
1.7.3	If you do n't know about it - it is a sort of non-destructive low-level formatter .	St
1.7.4	It low-level formats , high-level formats , pattern tests and then , only if the sector passes all tests does it put the data back .	St
1.7.5	If it fails , the data is transferred to a safe area on the HDD .	St
1.7.6	I 've revived loads of drives with it .	St
1.7.7	Ideal for rejuvenating sectors Before they fail .	St
1.7.8	It can also recover data .	St
1.8.1	When using Win2000ProSp4 Always get back to same problem : At bootup , blackpage comes up with Win can not start because xxxx/missing files ( name of file ) But at each restart the name of missing file changes..	St
1.8.2	Adds : you can repair this file usiing Win2000 CD-Rom .	St
1.8.3	NOW is this Related to BAD SECTORS or is it simply a current bug with that OS ?	Ques
1.9.1	1 .	St
1.9.2	Run Scandisk-Thorough and see how many bad sectors are actually there .	St
1.9.3	2 .	St
1.9.4	Go to Hdd 's Mfg website and download an Hdd floppy that can check for same and might allow zero-fill .	St
1.9.5	But that wipes the whole Hdd and you 'd have to reinstall .	St
1.9.6	As with SpinRite , I 've recovered many bad sectors and more of Hdd that way , as the Hdd was n't failing .	St
1.9.7	The bad sectors got made by data hard errors and sudden power-off .	St
1.10.1	Well , first i think you should download HD Tune from http : //www.hdtune.com/ So you can throughly check your hard drive for problems and the SMART Status if your Hard Drive supports it .	Sug
1.10.2	Bad Sectors do tend to spread over time .	St
1.10.3	YOU CAN fix bad sectors if you really want to save your drive , and the software i recommend for that is HDD Regenerator @ http : //www.dposoft.net/ however it is shareware but it can repair the first bad sector it finds .	St
1.10.4	If you have alot of bad sectors like you think you might have then it probably can restore your drive back to good working form if you buy the software , or better yet buy a New Hard Drive as they are not expensive nowadays .	St
1.11.1	Also worth checking using the drive manufacturers software becuase if it is new enough , they will replace it for free if their software says it is bad .	St
1.11.2	Also , usually when you get a drive RMA 'd , they do n't make the same drive anymore , so it will usually be replaced with a larger faster better one .	St
1.12.1	Hi , For whatever reason your disk has lost some clusters the same , aside from accident damage eg dropping , is likely to be ongoing.So the drive over a few months more use will prob get worse .	St
1.12.2	Lost clusters are serious stuff since the os can not read across them and a crash or freeze results.That crash usually means more data loss or software damage which in turn causes yet more probs .	St
1.12.3	Even when clusters can be restored and got working or at least isolated they can still cause probs eg slow to read/write or the area has got to be skipped by the os , not good ! .	St
1.12.4	So on a drive of mine any bad clusters and the drive is from then on is suspect , back ups are taken quick.If they can not be repaired or any more deteriation is suspected then the drive is scrapped and back ups applied to a new one .	St
1.12.5	Best wishes Chris .	St
1.13.1	I had a laptop hdd I was using in my old PC that would do this or lose the bootstrap from time to time , that drive failed about a month after I upgraded .	St
1.13.2	I never found out why it did this but it only lasted 4 months , occuring more frequently as time passed , then no more HDD .	St
1.13.3	HDDs really should be replaced as soon as errors appear as their engineering does n't leave much time between the first error and a failure that will stop you retrieving your data .	St
1.14.1	Go to the next Computer Fair , you will usually find someone with the proper software needed to isolate just the bad sectors , you most likely do n't have 15 GB bad .	St
1.14.2	But truthfully , the drive is going and you can lose everything , buy a new HD .	St
