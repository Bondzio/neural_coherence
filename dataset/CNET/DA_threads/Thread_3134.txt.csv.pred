1.1.1	I'm installing a new motherboard and processor - ASUS A7V8X-X with AMP 2500 XP.	St
1.1.2	I've inserted the motherboard, connected the processor/heatsink/fan, conncted drives and PCI boards.	St
1.1.3	Last I connected all of the power cables and pin connectors.	St
1.1.4	When I try to start the machine everything lights up but the CPU fan doesn't start, so I switched it off immediately.	St
1.1.5	Any idea why the fan wouldn't work?	St
1.1.6	I tested the fan in a different machine and it works fine.	St
1.1.7	I also tried a good fan in the macjine but it didn't work.	St
1.1.8	Thanks Gary	St
1.2.1	The CPU FAN Connector didn't work.	St
1.2.2	I used another connection for the housing fan instead.	St
1.2.3	Your choice to return the board if thie works.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	which connection did you use instead?	St
1.4.1	.	St
1.5.1	I've tried using the other connection (chasis fan) but still doesn't work.	St
1.5.2	I've also tried swapping from a 230W PSU to a 300 watt.	St
1.5.3	But again, no joy.	St
1.6.1	230Watt is something quite old.	St
1.6.2	300 Watt units are often exaggerated and frankly you should be looking at a shiny new 450 Watt unit.	St
1.6.3	References: http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ Seek some help to get the right parts before you burn them up.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the info.	St
1.7.2	I'll try a bigger PSU.	Sug
1.7.3	Cheers Gary	St
1.8.1	I bought a particular HSF that used a different technology and wouldn't go unless I nudged it.	St
1.8.2	Can you say RMA?	St
