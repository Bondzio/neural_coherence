tell me something, why is it that you're asking this woman to update the firmware on a brand new router when the device has no problems whatsoever?
disable dhcp?
for what?
you're creating more confusion and an extra set of instructions this woman does not need.
did you also forget that she needs to clone the mac address on the modem?
again, do not upgrade the firmware on the router, if it ain't broke don't fix it.
