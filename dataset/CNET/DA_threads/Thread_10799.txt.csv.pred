1.1.1	I have been searching cnet 's site for a basic how-to for a non-computer-literate person getting their first computer .	St
1.1.2	One that can take the newbie through the steps starting wth taking the computer out of the box and setting it up , through the first time it is powered on and also covering the basic maintenance steps to take from the start to keep the computer operating at its optimum for the longest possible time , things like the best free antivirus , back-up methods ( especially ) and other general stuff for optimum performance and health .	St
1.1.3	It needs to explain things in step-by-step form and assume the newbie knows nothing .	St
1.1.4	Is there such information on this site that is all in the same place ?	Ques
1.1.5	I am desperate for a how-to here so that I do not have to try and explain it all for several reasons .	St
1.1.6	Firstly because the person that needs it will take no notice of what I say and also because I do n't actually know it all well enought to explain it in a coherent manner .	St
1.1.7	If it does n't already exist , how do I find the right person here at cnet to try and set up a page like what I am after ?	Ques

1.5.1	I know all the info I want is out there , it just does n't seem to be collated in the one place and the person I am looking for it for is lazy and a little slow on grasping complicated things .	St
1.5.2	If it is not in the one place , she will not bother doing any of it and it is for her kids safety and future benefit that I want to try and get her into the good habits from the start .	St
1.5.3	As I said , she wo n't take a lot of notice of me , she reckons if I know it it ca n't be right , but she sets great store in cyber world and thinks that if it says so online , it must be right regardless of where it actually comes from .	St
1.5.4	She is the type to fall for a nigerian scam .	St
1.5.5	So I hope you can see where my problem lies .	St
1.5.6	I do know I will be the one she comes crying to when things go wrong , but I am only a relative novice myself and do n't know how to get out of existing problems , only how to try and avoid them in the first place and that knowlege base is probably incomplete too , lol .	St
1.5.7	That 's why I was hoping there was a beginners guide to refer her to so she might at least get some good info to set her up .	St
