i bought one external hard drive, it actually explained that it has fat32, not the nfts.
which i did't kow about it until i read the document.
and i bought another one external hard drive, it is also fat32, but it didn't even bother to put it on the brochure to explain it.
so i am just wondering if i should reformat to nfts ?
or just leave it ?
most computers are using win xp now these days.
so...
