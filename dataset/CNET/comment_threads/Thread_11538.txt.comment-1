I broke my USB Belkin N adapter, metal cap went off after I stomp on it accidental(it fell off of my desk)and it may broke the chip, I heard I have the warranties since I brought this early 08 or 09(forgot) and broke it few day ago.
Will Belken willing to replace it or am I SOL and have to buy a new one.
I don't know if they willing to replace it or not since I cant find the warranties information on their site, or how much it will cost?
IF anyone know or have inside info with Belkin please post the information.
