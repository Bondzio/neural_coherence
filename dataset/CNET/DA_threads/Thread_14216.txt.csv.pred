1.1.1	I have a virgin superhub downstairs with my TV and Xbox attached .	St
1.1.2	I also have a DG834G router upstairs with a bt connection with two pcs and connected .	St
1.1.3	I want to use the netgear router to extend the reange of the super hub so that I only have 1 network in the house as the range of the superhub is not good enough .	St
1.1.4	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.5	I have tried to set the netgear as an extender but can not get it to work .	St
1.2.1	Sorry but no step by step is available .	St
1.2.2	Only guides .	St
1.2.3	Many over at https : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & as_q=how+to+use+a+router+as+an+access+point This will make it look as if there is one network .	St

1.3.1	I do n't want to connect a cable between the routers as its not an easy route .	St
1.3.2	Can they be connected wirelessly ?	Ques
1.4.1	I often use a powerline bridge to make that last link .	St
1.5.1	Most routers are capable of configuring WDS .	St
1.5.2	This allows the two routers to communicate with each other and still support your wireless devices .	St
1.5.3	You should refer to your owner manuals to see if you have this option .	Polite
1.5.4	WDS has it 's downsides though .	St
1.5.5	You cut your throughput in half and the connection is not always the most stable .	St
1.5.6	Keep this in mind .	St
1.6.1	I recently bought a Netgear WN2000RPT unit http : //www.amazon.co.uk/Netgear-Universal-WiFi-Range-Extender/dp/B003LAD8BY/ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=UTF8 & qid=1352280572 & sr=8-2 Within 5 minutes the extender was up and running and a strong-excellent signal across the first floor of our house .	St
1.6.2	If you want to use an old Netgear router , I have also tried this in the past and took it wired into another part of the house ; not as flexible though as the above wireless unit .	St
