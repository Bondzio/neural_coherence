Windows xp came up fine, no problems until I tried to set up the internet connect. In the middle of the process, the system rebooted. This was a problem that I have had and thought it was tied to the OS. I am starting to think it may be the processor. This computer took a lighting strike last summer and I had to install a NIC to bring it back on line. The computer is: Compaq SR1130NX AMD Athlon 3000 512 memory Note, I have replaced the ram as well, as I thought that might be the problem.

It does go in to windows, but it seems to reboot every time i try to perform a task. e.g., I try to set up the network connection or I try to check stats under my computer and all of a sudden the computer reboots. I was having this problem before putting in the new hard drive and running recovery on it. I thought I had it fixed when windows went through the entire new user start up process. But it seems as though, whenever I tax the system, the computer reboots. Could the temp files be bad if the entire system was restored?

2446	5	156658	1739661	1739102	VAPCMD	2/12/06 10:30 PM	1.1397834E12	Have you	tested the RAM using something like DocMem v3.2 or MemTest-86 ? run scandisk to see if there any corrupt files on the hard disk ? tested the hard drive with the mfg's diagnostic utility ?

Both are new as well, so I don't think that would be the problem. I keep coming back to the processor. Is there a way to &quot;load test&quot; the processor to see if it will cause the system to reboot? I would replace it, but don't have a chip that will work in the socket. I haven't run any of the tests that you recommeded. Given that I have replaced both items and ran a recovery, should I run these tests?

We installed Google Desktop and started having spontaneous reboots. We uninstalled Google Desktop, but now have new problems: All printers disappeared from Printers list. Can't move desktop icons (as if they're locked). Unable to copy & paste anything, in any program. Unable to listen to streaming audio with WMP. We have run all of these anti-spyware and anti-virus scans: PestPatrol, AdAware, HijackThis, Spybot S&D, Spyware Doctor, SpySweeper, Norton, AVG, Panda, TrendMicro, CW Shredder and RootKit Revealer, both while the HDD was in the computer, AND as an external drive connected to a clean computer. Each scan revealed some issues. After deleting the items it finds, the printers all reappear, desktop icons are movable, everything works again!....... but then the spontaneous reboots start happening! Apparently, we can't have it all. The spontaneous reboots do not happen when we're in safe mode, so is it proper to assume that it's not a PSU issue? We're running MemTest now to see if bad RAM might be an issue. Or can we trace it all back to the installation of Google Desktop? We THINK we deleted every trace of it, including all registry references. Then again, maybe we missed something?

You were giving some advice to a guy trying to help his daughter. I thought I might chime in and pick your brain. My Compaq Deskpro at work keeps rebooting just before the login dialogue box. I think that when I shut down the last time I may have shut down from the logon/login dialogue box. Would that cause a problem. Anyway it rebooted all night the other day. I turned it off before I left work Saturday. What I have tried. Safe modes. The computer will not go into any safe mode. It begins to load, but before the logon dialogue box the computer reboots. I never see windows only the progress bars. Unplugging the hard drive and A: drive. I have tried using the A Drive to reboot with floppies that I downloaded from bootdisks.com. I can't get passed the administrator's logon line. The administrator at work tried his password and it did not work. My computer does not have a CD-ROM. But maybe I can borrow one. I got a page of advice for Windows ME, but this computer still has Windows NT 2000 Professional. Thanks
