I have more than 100,000 designs on this drive. I have a Dell inspiron-E1505 laptop that is about 8 years old. I am running XP Pro Vers 2002 - Service Pack 3 - It has an Intel CPU T2400 @1.63GHz - 1.83Ghz @.00 GB RAM Every once in a while if my machine turned itself off with the hard drive attached when I got back on it would say that it could not finish writing to the device - the E drive $MFT file. I would click on the drive and it would bring up the maxtor window asking for my password and it would unlock the drive. Today it showed a different file quickly and then it closed another message popped up with the MFT file name. When I tried to open the drive it said, there was an I/O error. I tried logging off and then doing a shutdown but nothing has helped. When I went into device manager it said that the drive was a CD drive instead of an external drive storage. I tried to use the trouble shooting help system at the Seagate site but you can't do much if it thinks it is a CD Drive. Any help is really appreciated. Thx, jane

I've had to boot up and chkdsk the drive or try a chkdsk on boot (not going to duplicate chkdsk discussions at this point. If you haven't learned why USB drives are not reliable yet I'd be a little surprised. It's time to get that drive internal so you don't have this issue. Bob
