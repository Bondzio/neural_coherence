i have just recently built a pc, epox mb,intel p4-1.8 g 512 mb pc2100 ram, .
the power supply seems to be working fine and no problems booting or running.
however i have noticed that even when the pc i shutdown the case seem warm where the power supply is located.
i have built several other pc before but have noticed the heat build up.
any ideas
