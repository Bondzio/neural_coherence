1.1.1	Hi all Just got the NETGEAR - RangeMax Dual-Band Wireless-N and set it up ( no issues setting it up , in fact surprisingly easy ) and it is set to dual band ( 2.4 & 5GHz ) .	St
1.1.2	House has concrete walls ( I know this can mess with the signal ) question is .	St
1.1.3	I get an excellent signal with the 2.4GHz wifi ( in the room where I need the laptop working ) , but the 5GHz signal is not that great .	St
1.1.4	any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	The absorption of the signal does vary with the frequency .	St
1.2.2	It would take a boatload or equipment to measure this but you should ... Go with what works best .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I am OK with the 2.4GHz , I was just wondering .	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the reply	St
1.4.1	http : //www.cse.unt.edu/~rakl/Tum05.pdf On page 15 or so you see the range of 5.8GHz to be noted at 200 feet .	St
1.4.2	The 802.11g 2.4GHz is in the next section and is noted to be 300 feet .	St
1.4.3	Again the issue here is all about what 's in between and what frequencies are absorbed and by how much .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
