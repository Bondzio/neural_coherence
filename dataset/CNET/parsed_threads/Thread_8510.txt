<s> Hello, I inherited a Bretford Netbook 32 cart with no instructions. </s>
<s> There are 4 cords in the back. </s>
<s> Could anyone tell me exactly how I configure these? </s>
<s> Which ones do I plug in at which time? </s>
<s> Also, can anyone direct me to an online instruction manual? </s>
<s> Thank you, Lisa </s>

<s> Yes, this cart. </s>
<s> I got it second hand, so not sure if the maker will help, but a good idea to try. </s>
<s> Thank you, Lisa </s>
<s> I don't think it was a Bretford, however, but did have 32 slots. </s>
<s> It's design was accommodate 32 netbook sized PCs and act as a charging station. </s>
<s> The one I did had only 2 power cords that went external to the cart but there were 3 or 4 cords in total. </s>
<s> On the back side of the cart were 2 power strips with probably 20 outlets each for a total of 40 outlets. </s>
<s> The power cord for each of these outlet strips connected to a timer inside the same cabinet. </s>
<s> The timer box had the longer power cord attached that went to a wall outlet. </s>
<s> The timer would cycle the power to the outlet strips so that only one would be &quot;hot&quot; at a time and would alternate between the two. </s>
<s> This reduced the load at any given time. </s>
<s> Another power cord went to a pop-up accessory outlet for the top of the cart. </s>
<s> On the one I did, we placed a printer on the cart with a wifi print server. </s>
<s> The accessory cord supplied power to those as, when the cart was rolled into a classroom for use, the charging circuit cord was not needed....only the accessory cord if printing was to be done. </s>
<s> There were separator panels between each netbook. </s>
<s> These panels were constructed to allow attachment of a charger for each netbook. </s>
<s> The wiring wrapped (fairly) neatly around the panels and there were holes drilled that would allow cable/zip ties to hold the charging bricks securely. </s>
<s> Each charger cord went into an outlet on a power strip. </s>
<s> It was a good idea to follow some scheme so you'd know which tier (upper or lower) of netbooks was receiving charging power at any given time. </s>
<s> I can't direct you to a manual but I can tell you that, once you get into the thing, how to hook it up should just about hit you in the face. </s>
<s> Good luck with it. </s>
<s> http://bretford.com/resources/downloads/instructions/B_NETBOOK32_%28031_8115%29.pdf It's not step by step but it's something that might be useful. </s>
<s> Their site does have more. </s>
<s> This is the one I did. </s>
<s> I lied...it's only got 30 compartments. </s>
<s> It was fairly easy to figure out. </s>
