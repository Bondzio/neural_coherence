I would say out of the choices you have listed, go with the AMD dual-core 3800+ over the Intel. Only the newest Intel chips (still cost about $1000) can compete with similarly priced AMDs (but it does smoke everything them all, from what I have read). Good luck!

INTEL C2D is the way to go, if you have a platform that will support it. If you are buying a prebuilt, it's still the way to go.

With dual cores already becoming main stream and quad cores just around the corner, you can be assured that programs utilizing multiple cores will be flooding the market in the next year. I just finished building a Core 2 Duo E6600 system and couldn't be happier. I was originally going to go with and AMD, but once Core 2 Duo's hit the market there was really no competition. If you are looking to compare CPU's, look no further than Tom Hardware's CPU Charts, they are incredibly helpful in determining how much bang you will get for your buck. Good Luck!!! http://www23.tomshardware.com/cpu.html?modelx=33&model1=432&model2=463&chart=171
