1.1.1	Amateur here and any help would be appreciated .	St
1.1.2	I have a Gateway computer ( about a year and a half old ) running XP with a LCD flat screen monitor .	St
1.1.3	All was well until today when , after the computer had been on & quot ; stand by & quot ; mode , the monitor failed to automatically come on when I started the computer up again .	St
1.1.4	I turned off the power button to the monitor , then turned it back on again and received the message , & quot ; no signal & quot ; .	St
1.1.5	After checking to see if the connections were all secure , I restarted the computer ( not just & quot ; stand by & quot ; ) and the monitor came on as normal .	St
1.1.6	I tried & quot ; stand by & quot ; again with the same & quot ; no signal & quot ; results .	St
1.1.7	I 'm at a loss .	St
1.1.8	Do n't know if this means I need a new graphics card or perhaps to at least check if it is seated correctly .	St
1.1.9	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	The monitor has a low power state activated and deactivated by the video card .	St
1.2.2	Either the card is not sending the signal or the monitor is not responding .	St
1.2.3	Swap one or the other for a test .	St
1.3.1	Thanks much , Cory .	St
1.3.2	I 'll give a shot to swapping the monitor out first .	St
1.3.3	Hopefully , by process of elimination , I 'll have a culprit at that time .	St
1.3.4	Will probably take me a few days to get to it though .	St
