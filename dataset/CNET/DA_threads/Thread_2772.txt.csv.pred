1.1.1	My college has a network, their dhcp will allot us a xx.xx.67.xx ip (Wifi), i found that in their lab they use a different proxy that is restricted for our ip range(Squid) (xx.xx.1.xx is their ip range).	St
1.1.2	when i am manually configure my network interface to their ip range it doesn't ping to the both proxy, but in default dhcp i can ping both.	St
1.1.3	Is there any emulators that can emulate my ip address to their range of ip ?	Ques
1.1.4	so that i can fool squid ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	It would help knowing what you are trying to achieve, but your college network is likely designed to keep the student network distinctly separate from the classroom network.	St
1.2.2	There is no emulator that would fool this system of security.	St
1.2.3	You would need to contact the network administrator if you need access to those lab resources.	St
1.3.1	If you want to use an IP nothing stopped you from setting such manually on almost any PC to date.	St
1.3.2	So no fooling required!	St
