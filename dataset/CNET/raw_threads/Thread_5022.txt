I am deciding to buy P4M800PRO-M2 (V2.0) from my computer engineer. I would like to know 2 things. 1. Does the above mentioned motherboard support Intel Dual Core Processor 3Ghz? 2. Does the above mentioned motherboard support Sata 2 Technology. B'coz, I am also planning to buy WDC Caviar SE 160 G.B. 7200 r.p.m., 300Mb/s Sata 2 Hard drive 8MB Cache. Please reply back as soon as possible... Apoorva.

Anytime you have a similar question like this the maker's support website is the definitive answer source. tada -----Willy
