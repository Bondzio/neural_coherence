Hi.
I am using 3G network over Huawei EC315 usb.
I have an TP-Link TD-W8950ND device too.
I want to bridge my TP-Link device with the Hawei usb which doesn't supports more than 5 connections at a time.
TP-Link router supports Bridge function but I don't know how to do this to expand my network connections.
Guide me in performing this function!
