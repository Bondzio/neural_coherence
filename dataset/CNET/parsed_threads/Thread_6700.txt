<s> On my Zebra 2844-z I can't print. </s>
<s> I load the media; plug in the usb cable install the driver from the CD. </s>
<s> I print a confiuration page from the printer it's self, and it works. </s>
<s> I go to print a Windows test page and The printer gives me a flashing red light. </s>
<s> It seems to me to be a callibration issue or something wrong with the media or media settings but I'm out of ideas on how to figure out exactly the problem. </s>
<s> I run windows xp Pro SP3. </s>
<s> I've tested it on multiple computers and I always get the same thing. </s>
<s> Any advice is greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> I would think printing the windoze test page is too large or wide for that matter. </s>
<s> The Zebra is probably 40-col. printing and normal PC output is 80-col or more. </s>
<s> So, if you use the std. </s>
<s> windoze test pattern, that's not going to work. </s>
<s> Generate a dummy file, of small size and dump that instead, if possible. </s>
<s> example: 1 22 333 4444 55555 end of test Just is the final use of the Zebra intended for? </s>
<s> Install the app. </s>
<s> you want it to use and then configure that as well. </s>
<s> This is where it may start to work right provided it knows the configurations of both PC and printer match to accept each other. </s>

<s> I can get it to print a windows test page (it's just a picture of the windows logo) After I send the print job and it errors, I can restore the defaults. </s>
<s> It runs through and calibrates to the label size and prints what ever print job was in Que. </s>
<s> Even if it's multiple print jobs (either the windows or the intended application.) </s>
<s> However, the whole process repeats it's self after that. </s>
<s> Since you already stated you tried on various PCs, the error remains the same. </s>
<s> That suggests the Zebra is somehow misconfigured or its bad. </s>
<s> I checked the manual, after some time and it offers nothing to resolve this other that to check the physical h/w(platen, etc.) </s>
<s> or use the command lingo, as in ^SC, if I recall. </s>
<s> the error is in the Zebra physically or the setup. </s>
<s> While you have tried USB connection, try the parallel port if available, unless of course ONLY USB is present at the printer. </s>
<s> If you swap to various USB ports, that will cause an issue as quenes get hosed unti returned to proper last connection of that request. </s>
<s> The manual also refers to the media being(paper), be sure its routed correctly and refers to same media. </s>
<s> If I remember right, the Zebra post is a repeat of a past post. </s>
<s> If this is so, then maybe its best to query Zebra for support. </s>
<s> If in fact there is something wrong it will diagnosed and maybe covered under warranty. </s>
<s> If you have access to another Zebra printer, copy those settings as reference. </s>
<s> It shouldn't be taking any issue, because you say it prints a windoze test(logo) but the typical windoze test is more than a logo, far more. </s>
<s> Because it stops and errors and doesn't finish the job, it should try again when cleared, maybe that's an area to review. </s>
<s> If I had this setup in frt. </s>
<s> of me, it makes more sense to try this or that. </s>
<s> The options should be few and it works or doesn't. </s>
