i'm by no means a wireless expert, but i switched from my linksys to the airport express recently.
i wasn't able to get video ichat to work with the linksys and of course the ae lets me use my isight camera.
well, i've got my studio about 35 feet from my bedroom where i've got my ae taped up high on a window so i can get reception in the other building!
not the best arrangement!
i heard about wds which allows ae or another airport extreme base station to act as another remote access point, thereby extending the range of my wireless.
i don't have another ae, but i have my old linksys wrieless router.
i nosed around on the web and found this blog that looks terrific!
this afternoon, i'm going to attempt to make the linksys act as my repeater or the ae act as one.
whatever i can get to work.
another little tidbit, do a google search on 'macstumbler' and download this little piece of software that will show what your actual signal strength is throughout your wireless network.
since i'm new to wireless, i'll really be interested to hear how your dilemma plays out.
good luck!
phil
