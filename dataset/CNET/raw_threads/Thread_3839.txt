Using my old ipod's plug that connects the Zune to a TV, I attempted to connect the Zune to a friend's TV. However, it did not work and I lost ALL of the directional buttons and touch-features on the directional pad. The play/pause and back buttons work fine. HOWEVER, I cannot restart it because this involved pressing up on the pad and back, and this is obviously impossible with the pad out of commission. Is there any software I can download to refresh the Zune? Additionally is there any other way to manually reset it? I've held down the play/pause button many times and the Zune software is up to date.

I wouldn't mention you used a non-Zune(non-compatible) cable with it and the problem appeared. Afterall, I suspect the Zune and iPod cables are different at least *assume* they're not interchangeable. tada -----Willy
