1.1.1	I recently bought a 2.5in USB II External HD (40Gb) after a trip to Hong Kong.	St
1.1.2	I intended to use it as a back up drive for all my documents.	St
1.1.3	I was told by the vendor that it was like a USB flash memory stick (simply plug n play) and this was also what the instruction manual told me.	St
1.1.4	However (suprise, suprise) I'm having difficulties.	St
1.1.5	As soon as I connect it up my computer (New Sony Vaio FS series with Windows XP Home) registers it as a 'removable USB Mass Storage Device' but when I look in 'My Computer', there is no associated drive icon for it.	St
1.1.6	Following advice from Microsoft Support, I've looked in 'Computer Management' under 'Administrative Tools - Control Setup' and it's there, but labelled as: 'Disk 1 - No Media' as oppossed to my main hard Hard Disk [Disk 0 - Recovery Partition 6.99Gb EISA Config, VAIO(C: ) 27.95Gb NTFS & VAIO(D: ) 58.23Gb NTFS].	St
1.1.7	Looking at the forums here and at Microsoft Support pages, I get the feeling I need to Partition and Format this disk, but I'm a little bewildered by the instructions Microsoft are giving about using Fdisk and Format tools.	St
1.1.8	Am I on the right track and can anyone give me clear instructions?	St
1.1.9	CHL	St
1.2.1	Well XP dosen't have fdisk.	St
1.2.2	Noe go back into 'Computer Management' under 'Administrative Tools - Control Setup' and it's there, but labelled as:Disk 1 Now you will have right click on it, set as active, then format it.	St
