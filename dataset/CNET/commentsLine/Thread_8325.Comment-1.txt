ive been using computers for about 17 years and ive always been far behind the times in keeping a system updated.
i recently purchased a new system from a random dealer and thought i would be happy with just average.
my problem is this, it gets old looking at the hourglass all the time more than i think i should have to.
i dont have many programs in the background and i keep my system clean daily from spyware, reg probs and other slow downs.
i know its a lousy system atm but here is what i have.
- 3200 sempron (i know, iknow ) - asus socket 939 motherboard - ati chpipset (dont like nvidia) - 1 gig 3200 400mhz ram - ultra ata 133 hd (i cant aford 2x wd raptors on a raid 0 config lol) - ati x550se - pci-e (added this) these are the main thing i am working with here.
i dont want to drop alot fo cash on this system but i want to replace a few peices to make my daily internet and gaming use runnning smooth enough.
i play wow so nothing that is graphically strenuous.
i like to play at mid high setting and i can raid in a high end guild quite easily.
processor is a big concern but i just want someones knowledge as to what should really be my first priority because a higher processor with a sub par things around it is usless.
i have run several benchmarks on my system after several tweaks i have done.
i have used sis sandra and pc mark05, keep cpuz and passmark's performance test (i get roughly a 310 score) i know its a convoluted questiosn but i just dont want to drop money on parts that are going to make the biggest diff.
any information anyone can provide would be awesome
