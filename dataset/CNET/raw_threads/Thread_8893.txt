I've searched the forums for an answer to this question, but the information I've found has been pretty old. So I wondered if there might be a more current answer. I have no land line, using only my cell phone for calls and cable broadband for internet. What, if any, options do I have if I want to be able to fax documents from home? I tried eFax once upon a time, several years ago (2003, I think), but found it to be twitchy with a Mac. (Fonts would frequently get messed up.) I imagine the service may have improved by now, but I would *so* prefer being able to fax in a more conventional way. Most of the documents I need to fax are not originating from the computer, often being forms filled out by hand. I'm having a hard time believing that there is *no* faxing option for those of us without land lines! It's becoming more and more common to not have one. Can anyone help? (Just in case it might be relevant: I have an older iMac running OS 10.3.9 with a mere 500MHz G3 chip and 384 MB of RAM.) (...Please don't laugh. I'm a poor social worker!) Thanks!!

Since we get faxes daily and only use ureach for receiving faxes, I think we have gotten lucky. I know my spam folder does a good job of catching stuff, but I just click empty and never look at it.
