<s> I have a mates computer which im trying to fix after it stopped working yesterday. </s>
<s> What heppens is when you turn the computer on it posts fine and then goes to the black and white windows screen saying something along the lines of there was an error last time windows was used blah blah. </s>
<s> It has a countdown from 30 in one corner and gives me the options: Safe mode Safe mode with command Safe mode with networking Last known Good configuration Start normally If i select start normally it resets itself, if I select safe mode it begins to load but when it gets down to JGOGO.sys it freezes or restarts itself and if I select last known good config it just gives me a completey blank screen or resets itself. </s>
<s> I thought that maybe some file was corrupt so I tried booting it from the windows disk.The windows disk boots up everything on that blue screen, and then when at the bottom it says starting windows it dies or resets itself. </s>
<s> I have tried: Different Ram Different Graphics Card Tried to reinstall windows (from 2 different disks) Re-sat all heatsinks Tried Different Hard drive Tried different cd Drive Tried clearing cmos and updated the bios to latest version I suspect that the motherboard is broken. </s>
