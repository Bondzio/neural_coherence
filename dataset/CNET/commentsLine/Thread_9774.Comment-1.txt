i currently have an amd athlon 1.4ghz, ali alimagik 1 chipset, iwill award bios, 128mb nvidia agp video card, 512mb ddr ram, 2hd, cdr, dvd.
i am running windows xp pro.
i've had this computer for almost 2 years or so without any issues.
a few months ago it looked like the lithium battery on the mb was starting to go.
on every reboot it asked if i wanted to update the iwill smart settings in the bios.
a few weeks ago, the computer started to randomly reboot.
sometimes it would reboot in repeatedly and then remain stable.
i recently rebooted the machine to reset some setting on my router and now it keeps rebooting after startup.
usually within 10-15 seconds of seeing my desktop, it will reboot again...and again.
i've had some success working in safe mode, but even there it has rebooted a couple of times.
i then replaced the litium battery on the mb... still rebooting.
i checked my error log while in safe mode and it gave the following mesaage: amli: acpi bios is attempting to write an illegal io port address (0x70), which lies in the 0x70-0x71 protected address range.. i checked with the microsoft website and it said the solution is to update you bios.
after going to the iwill website, it looks like that i am already up to date with the most recent version.
i checked for any acpi setting in the bios and couldn't find any mention of it there.
does anyone have an idea what is causing this error or what i could do to solve it?
i even switched out each ram to see if either of them were bad.
any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!!
thanks!
