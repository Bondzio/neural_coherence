Hello Everyone!
I think I have thought of a way to backup my current HDD.
Would it be possible to buy a DVD Writer, put all my data on DVDs, install the new HDD and put files on?
But don't DVDs only hold video files?
I have a 9.39GB HDD and I am going to upgrade to 80GB HDD.
I am using a Desktop PC.
All suggestions appreciated, -Larry
