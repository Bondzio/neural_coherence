I was on the verge of buying a new PSU for my HP XW6000 Workstation when I read on several forums that they may not work as some manufacturers use motherboards designed to be compatible with proprietary PSUs only.
Is there a converter plug or something I can use to make them compatible?
I dont want to have to fork out on another standard PSU when I could get a higher quality, less noisy, more efficient PSU.
Btw, I am considering changing my PSU as the computer emits an annoying high pitched whine.
I have exhausted other reasons: not the monitor, cleaned the inside of dust and put the CPU on the floor away from speakers.
The whine comes on when I boot and stays all the time...not intermittent.
I read it could be due to failing capacitors and a PSU change is called for...apparently those bundled in CPU packages tend to be less than top quality.
If I am barking up the wrong tree, then some advice would be appreciated!
