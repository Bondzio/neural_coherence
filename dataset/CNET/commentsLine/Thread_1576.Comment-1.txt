hi everyone... i have a little bit of a problem, im very sorry for the inconvenience if you get this alot but ive tried really after reading other posts on how to successfully set up an ad hoc network... however i have failed.
all i really want to do is set up a wlan... no routers no nothing, just to be able to share files between two laptops i just recently bought ( vaio and dell both with internal wireless network cards and wlan) .
i would greatly greatly appreciate it if someone could take the time to walk me through the steps one by one please... thanks you.
