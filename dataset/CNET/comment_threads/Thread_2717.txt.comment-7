Thank you Alan.
HP did not have the 1G memory in their inventory.
I told the salesperson who had called me that I had found a source.
She confirmed the compatibility and that I could add the two in the empty slots alongside the 2 - 512MB it was compatible, as did Ray H in this forum.
The cost of purchasing it was about 1/2 of what HP would have charged.
I am getting the 2 - 1G modules from Amazon/Tiger Direct...
