A router is a Layer 3 device in the OSI model.
It connects two networks with different IP networks.
It makes forwarding decisions based on the IP address.
A bridge or switch is a layer 2 device (OSI) and it makes forwarding decisions based on the hardware address (MAC address) Most consumer routers are effectively a 2 port router (LAN side & WAN side).
The LAN interface is usually attached to a 4 port switch.
A wireless Access Point is a bridge that connects the wired to the unwired devices.
The AP is an extension of the 4 port switch side of the router.
