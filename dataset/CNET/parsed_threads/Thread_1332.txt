<s> Hello everybody, I now have two hard drives, both with Windows XP SP2 on them. </s>
<s> Currently the original HDD is now connected. </s>
<s> I installed a new 320 GB WD Caviar hard drive in our desktop computer where the original 120 GB Seagate Barracuda HDD was located. </s>
<s> I successfully installed Windows XP SP2 on the new HDD. </s>
<s> I reinstalled the original HDD beneath the new one. </s>
<s> I disconnected the new HDD. </s>
<s> I then reconnected the original HDD until we have time to install all the updates, drivers, etc, as we ran out of time and needed the computer. </s>
<s> We wish to keep the old hard drive as it is for now, until we can transfer just the files we need to the new HDD. </s>
<s> We would then format the old HDD and use it without Windows XP. </s>
<s> The jumpers on both HDDs are at factory settings. </s>
<s> The data cable (which is round) is labeled: &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot;. </s>
<s> Our computer is about 3 years old, purchased from a local shop: AMD Athlon XP 3000 2.16 GHz, 2 GB RAM, ATI All-In-Wonder w/128MB RAM, 120 BG Seagate Barracuda HDD. </s>
<s> I need to know what my options are. </s>
<s> Questions: 1. </s>
<s> Is our cable possibly a &quot;Cable Select&quot; type & how can I check? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do I need to do anything with the jumpers? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Can I now connect both HDDs? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> If yes, what will happen when I start the computer? </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> How might we transfer files from on HDD to another? </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Can we access both HDDs without rebooting, how does this work? </s>
<s> TO all: TIA fro your help. </s>

<s> Did you buy a Retail WD kit or an OEM drive? </s>
<s> If former, there should be an accompanying CD with migration software and instructions on how to move everything from old drive to new w/o re-installing OS. </s>
<s> At your knowledge level that's probably the best solution. </s>
<s> Thank you for the response. </s>
<s> We purchased the WD HDD retail. </s>
<s> We do not want to copy anything but some specific files from the old HDD,...because back in February a Windows Auto Update for MS Office 2003 caused our ATI video card to stop working properly. </s>
<s> We turned off Auto Update. </s>
<s> We contacted MS and ATI about this and nothing they recommended has restored the TV function to our computer. </s>
<s> That includes current updates to the drivers and MS help suggestions, reinstalling drivers, etc.. </s>
<s> The store we purchased the PC from recommended formating the HDD. </s>
<s> We do NOT want to copy the problems from the old HDD to the new one. </s>
<s> We wish to do a clean install with the OS, the drivers, and NOT install MS Office 2003 at all on the new drive. </s>
<s> Now, I may not fully understand how this copying software you refer to works, but I do know I don't want to duplicate the same driver conflict/problems by copying it to the new drive. </s>
<s> Thanks, Dan Now, can anyone please provide some answers to my questions since I have a bit more information about the issue at hand? </s>
<s> Sam, I appreciate your help. </s>
<s> I'm sorry if my reply was a bit testy. </s>
<s> This computer problem has gotten to me. </s>
<s> I hooked up the new hard drive so my wife can load the drivers and programs this weekend while I am at work. </s>
<s> I'll try setting the jumpers to &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot; next weekend, when I am off work and do have time to work on it again. </s>
<s> Dan </s>
<s> 2 drives with active partitions with Windows, even when one is master and the other slave, is Windows may get confused and write to the wrong drive. </s>
<s> Then, neither will work properly w/o the other present. </s>
<s> Better for you to get a USB enclosure or adapter such as http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812232002 and connect the old drive with it. </s>
<s> Your SATA/IDE to USB adapter idea sounds interesting. </s>
<s> I appreciate the info. </s>
<s> I better understand your earlier comments about this issue. </s>
<s> I checked and see that local MicroCenter has four different models. </s>
<s> It has been nothing but a pain since that Windows auto update back in February. </s>
<s> Wife lost her TV feature she used to record shows. </s>
<s> System Restore didn't even work. </s>
<s> Google &quot;Remove MS Office 2003&quot;, some time, and you'll see what I mean. </s>
<s> Nothing. </s>
<s> Can't remove the update, can't remove Office, can't get old or new video drivers to work. </s>
<s> I'll be glad when my wife gets all her necessary files saved to the new HDD. </s>
<s> I'll see about buying one of these adapters try it out next weekend when I am off work. </s>
<s> Thanks, Dan </s>
<s> AIW cards http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-in-Wonder have always been klutzy hardware. </s>
<s> CCC suite too. </s>
<s> Try removing CCC leaving only the HW drivers, and of course keep TV software. </s>
<s> I dump CCC on any ATI cards I use. </s>
<s> In one installation, it caused the whole screen to be a nice shade of magnolia pink in default settings and it wasn't even Spring! </s>
<s> Don't know why MSO2003 and patches would be a problem. </s>
<s> I don't use auto update but have installed MSO SP3 and XP SP3 and post patches which include all previous hotfixes and some optional components from SP2. </s>
<s> Don't install HW driver updates shown in MS Update unless you know for sure they will work (duh, how can anyone know that unless testing in a lab); been known to crash or hang up some PCs. </s>
<s> Auto Update should not be delivering HW drivers. </s>
<s> Finally, tread carefully when using TV adapters because I have found some tuner and PVR SW break too easily when other HW/SW are installed/uninstalled. </s>
<s> Good luck with your recovery. </s>
<s> I got home from work tonight and the wife tells me of her adventures loading drivers onto the new HDD. </s>
<s> Then she mentions the new drive is now f:/ and she had to change things when they wanted to go to the c:/ drive. </s>
<s> Now how am I going to straighten this mess out? </s>
<s> Good Lord, what next? </s>
<s> What do I have to do to format this drive and install it so it is recognized as the c:/ Drive? </s>
<s> We had gotten as far as loading windows xp sp2, the wireless adapter for the internet, and some drivesrs. </s>
<s> I have now reconnected the old HDD so she can use the computer until we get sorted out. </s>
<s> Boy is this a PITA. </s>
<s> Please, Help! </s>
<s> Dan </s>
