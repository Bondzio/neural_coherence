I have a Dell Dimension 2400 series PC running Windows XP Home. It is a year old. I also have a HP 2175 or something on that order. It is an all in one. Here is the problem. First, without the printer attached to the PC through a USB port the PC boots up just fine. But if I have the Printer plugged in The POST runs fine but just before the OS loads the computer hangs for about 10 minutes and has just a cursor blinking in the upper left hand corner. Eventually it will boot into windows but it takes forever. I never get any warnings from the system saying that there is anything bad with the printer or the USB port but when I look in the device manager in Windows with the printer plugged in I have a &quot;USBnull HPO08&quot; by the USB ports??? If I look in the &quot;show printers&quot; window on the system I can see the printer and it says it is online and ready?? Does anyone have any idea why this is happening??

LOL	Just kidding, but when I found you were usingXP I remebered that there are three great tools available to see what is possibly causing the problems. They are: Event Viewer, Bootlogtext file and Boot ini log. I have only used event viewer. One way to get there is go to DStart Run type eventvwr and hit OK. This gives a list of all of the events that have been occuring with the system. You can clear them and get a new set the next time that you turn the system on. I'll try to find a link to how to use the other two.

I did look at the event log and did not see anything out of the ordinary. But maybe there is a way to get the information I need from the boot.ini file or the boot log text file. Thanks again, Loren
