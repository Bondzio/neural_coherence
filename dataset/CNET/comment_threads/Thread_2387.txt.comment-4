Okay my dad had a similar problem.
The HD has to be in NTFS format not FAT for windows XP to recognize it.
You also have to install the latest drivers for your particular hard drive- which was his problem.
Once you do that, you should be able to restart your computer and the hard drive should be recognized.
I assume then you can delete windows 98 se if you haven't already from your computer.
