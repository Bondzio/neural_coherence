i read a bit about various routers and chose belkin for all of the required equipment.
i firmly believe in one brand in this situation, as that means only one support group instead of pointing fingers.
prior to purchasing the belkin pre-n, i did some reading here on this system and also spoke with two salesmen at compusa.
the second person was their &quot;expert&quot; and he answered every question i had.
anyway, from conversation with the &quot;expert&quot; and the reviews here on cnet, i choose to stay with belkin and upgrade to their pre-n system.
50% signal strength in my situation meant that i did sustain a loss in speed, though for surfing the net, it was neglible - though when hitting the network printer or moving a large file around, i did see a drop in performance.
i have yet to see a significant degradation in accuracy (packet resends).
this evening i went down the end of the street (about 500 feet line of site and 20 feet behind a wooden house) and was able to pickup my router, though it was a weak signal.
however, i did pickup six other networks and only two of them were protected.
i was able to log on and off of one router with ease.
my configuration involves no ssid broadcast, wpa-psk and mac addressing.
i changed a setting for the laptop not to automatically connect with my router - and to get it going again, i had to temporarily turn on the ssid and re-enter the pre-shared key to get it to again automatically connect.
