<s> So I've finally snagged myself a dandy gaming computer for $660. </s>
<s> Here's the specs. </s>
<s> http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp138/NightHawkXi/ComputerSpecs.jpg It came with an intel graphics card, integrated, which I imagine isn't good. </s>
<s> It runs Counterstrike Source, and other games just fine, smooth, no lag, half life 2 runs like a peace of cake, but I want to upgrade the graphics card to play better looking games, like Modern Warfare 2, APB, Global Agenda, and Blacklight Tango down. </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>
<s> I'm looking between $119 - $169 </s>
<s> My recommendation would be an ATI 5770 card. </s>
<s> It would be near the upper end of you budget, but with some looking, you could find something. </s>
<s> What kind of Power Supply do you currently have on your computer? </s>
<s> Depending on what you get, you might not have the power(or proper connectors) to use the new card. </s>
