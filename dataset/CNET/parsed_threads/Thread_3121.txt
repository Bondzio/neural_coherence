<s> I have a 3.5&quot; samsung hdd from a computer that was dead and converted it to a external hard drive but when i tried to format with Easus partition software i got an error message that the format could not be completed and a second later a message that the USB storage driver could not be detected since then i have tried many ways to connect the external hdd but it's not recognized since then. </s>
<s> Any ideas of what could it be and how could i solve it. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Why not use the partion and format tools that Windows offers? </s>
<s> I can't be specific here as I can't find which OS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am using Windows 7 and i couldn't use the windows tool because i wanted to create 2 partitions, one with like 100GB in FAT32 so i could use it to backup my PS3 data while the rest of the hdd in NTFS. </s>
<s> Since there are limitations for FAT32 partitions when using the windows tool i had to use another partition software. </s>
<s> Such details would change my answer to &quot;Use GPARTED.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Well the problem is not my partition software but the hdd, while formatting and creating the partitions for it i received an error that the process couldn't be completed and then it stopped being recognized by the PC. </s>
<s> Everytime i connect the hdd i receive a message saying that the USB driver could not be installed however it was working before i made the format and partition processes. </s>
<s> Runs from CD I wouldn't get such a message from that. </s>
<s> Are you sure you tried GPARTED? </s>
<s> It's fairly simple as it has a mouse interface and well, it's what I would use next. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll try that and post my results. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
