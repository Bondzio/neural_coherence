1.3.1	If your information is valuable , you should probably contact a data recovery company .	St
1.3.2	If not or you do n't want to spend the money , give knoppix live cd a try .	St
1.3.3	You would want to use a program called dd_rescue .	St
1.3.4	Make sure you have the input file and output correct or you will overwrite your information .	St

1.5.1	I do n't get what you mean .	St
1.5.2	But guess you mean if I have search previous post about this same problem .	St
1.5.3	I have seen various post about it .	St
1.5.4	But I have n't seen anyone of them that match my own problem .	St
1.5.5	I have tried to follow their processes which says to initialize disk .	St
1.5.6	Mine however not giving me any options to initialize disk .	St
1.6.1	It 's titled lost and found and contains free , trial and mentions recovery houses .	St
1.6.2	Some of the tools work with such damage .	St
1.6.3	If you ca n't use such tools I suggest you head to http : //www.drivesavers.com now .	St
1.6.4	This sort of recovery is not reliable .	St
1.6.5	Some folk forget that or did n't know .	St

1.6.7	http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911/lost-and-found-or-the-storage-forum-sticky/ ? tag=contentBody ; threadListing Good luck !	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thank you Bob .	St
1.7.2	I see you 've been very helpful with people in most of the thread of read .	St
1.7.3	Keep up the good job .	St
1.7.4	Let me check those links out and revert .	Sug
1.8.1	If it is primarly pictures you want , you could try photorec : http : //www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec Make sure you read the tutorial http : //www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step Do you have a desktop computer or laptop ?	Sug
1.8.2	Dont try to initialize disk that could make matters worse .	Sug
1.9.1	Yes I have two laptops .	St
1.9.2	And I have lots of infos on the drive .	St
1.9.3	Majority of which is photos .	St
1.9.4	I do want the drive working so I can transfer my data .	St
1.9.5	I 'm yet to work on it .	St
1.9.6	Still bidding my time to take next possible action .	St
1.10.1	Read the tutorial again .	St
1.10.2	When you recover those files it writes them to some other drive .	St
1.10.3	Think about this .	St
1.10.4	The drive does not need to be fully working to recover files .	St
1.10.5	Why I write this is that some folk did n't know that when we recover files we do n't always fix the issue with the drive .	St
1.10.6	That is , we recover the data , then may format the drive and copy the files back onto the drive .	St
1.10.7	Bob	St
1.11.1	Yes I do know .	Res
1.11.2	I read the tutorials .	St
1.11.3	I think it 's best I get someone who really understand this to help me .	St
1.11.4	I do n't want to mess it up while doing it onmy own .	St
1.11.5	Thanks everyone .	Polite
1.12.1	If you ca n't use the tutorials such as Recuva offers then we are forced back to drive savers .	St
1.12.2	What I would write here would duplicate what 's at the Recuva site .	St
1.12.3	Bob	St
1.13.1	I 'm not sure I saw the thread on Recuver .	St
1.13.2	Is this same as Photorec ?	Ques
1.13.3	And you know what .	St
1.13.4	I 'm just being careful .	St
1.13.5	Aint a geek geeky like that .	St
1.13.6	I 'm just a Phtoographer.. Have got plenty data in that folder that I ca n't afford to mess up further .	St
1.13.7	I will try and see if I can find a local guy here who can work on it .	St
1.13.8	Cos I cant do drive saver from here and no time for me .	St
1.13.9	Cos I need the images urgently .	St
1.14.1	Good morning , I had two go bad last year .	St
1.14.2	Fortunately a friend let me borrow a copy of the puppy Linux operating system on cd for the second one .	St
1.14.3	You start the computer with cd in drive and external drive attached .	St
1.14.4	If you have ever used dos , it works like that .	St
1.14.5	I am better at showing than telling .	St
1.14.6	Linux recognized the drive and I was able to copy everything to a new drive .	St
1.14.7	It literally took 22 or more hours to copy but worth it .	St
1.14.8	Google Puppy Linux and see what you find .	St
1.14.9	Good luck and Happy Easter .	Polite
1.15.1	Even without a tutorial you use - & gt ; Recuva & lt ; - to scan for the files but save those files on a good drive .	St
1.15.2	Be careful of the spelling since bad people will rename some malware to suck folk into installing something bad .	St
1.15.3	I see the save location in the tab/area noted in the documentation at http : //www.piriform.com/docs/recuva/recuva-settings/options-actions Bob	St
