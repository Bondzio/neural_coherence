1.1.1	I have a wireless network using this D-Link router (which includes a print server) and a DSL modem, and I find I have to reboot the router every half hour or so to recover the Internet connection.	St
1.1.2	The symptoms are everything will work fine, and then suddenly Internet addresses cannot be translated (suggesting that a DNS cannot be located).	St
1.1.3	The router IP address is defined as the DNS, and when this problem occurs, it is also impossible to ping the router IP.	St
1.1.4	However, the wireless network is working, and other wireless PCs using the network can still be seen.	St
1.1.5	The print server also fails at he same time (this works by printing to the same inaccessible IP address).	St
1.1.6	To solve the problem, simply unplug the router for 5 seconds, then reconnect, and the Internet and print server are back within seconds.	St
1.1.7	It makes a mockery of the convenience of wireless though.	St
1.1.8	I have the latest firmware in the Router, and the three wireless PCs are running XP SP2, using either D-Link (b)adapter or internal Centrino wireless.	St
1.1.9	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I'm using this model too and very happy with it.	St
