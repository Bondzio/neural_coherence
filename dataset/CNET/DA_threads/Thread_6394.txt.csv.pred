1.1.1	I have need to upgrade my cpu from a pentium d 930 3.00 ghz , and I was wondering might be compatible with my computer .	St
1.1.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819116367 would this cpu be ok on my comp ?	Ques
1.2.1	They made it , they know the compatibility .	St
1.2.2	Kees	St
1.3.1	You need to check the specs of the current cpu you have .	Sug
1.3.2	Visit the Sony support website and review or check the manual of same and note the specs .	St
1.3.3	Once in hand visit the cpu maker support website and look-up that cpu .	St
1.3.4	Usually the cpu maybe listed or surfed until a list is found under that class & type what is available .	St
1.3.5	Find , the cpu that is a level higher and get it .	St
1.3.6	Of course , you need to know the range the mtrbd .	St
1.3.7	bios allows for such an upgrade .	St
1.3.8	Its very important to be sure your mtrbd .	St
1.3.9	is at the latest bios update , if not do so .	St
1.3.10	This will allow the support of any level of cpu or better support of same , otherwise , it would be a waste of time .	St
1.3.11	This also includes any FSB or jumper setting that match the needs of the new cpu or is & quot ; auto set & quot ; from the bios itself .	St
1.3.12	If the proper cpu class & type are followed it wo n't damage the mtrbd .	St
1.3.13	and it should easily be acknowledged excluding any manual setting .	St
1.3.14	Otherwise , the cpu upgrade if not supported or requires more than the mtrbd .	St
1.3.15	allows the upgrade is mute .	St
1.3.16	This is sometimes the end result for OEM because they 're not as flexible to such or very limited range .	St
1.3.17	Also , make sure the cooling matches what the cpu requires if not supplied in the cpu upgrade kit .	St
