I have XP installed in my Intel Macbook Pro in the separate partition created by boot camp.
Recently while I was running on XP the computer crashed badly and XP system seemed to have been damaged and I can't boot as XP anymore.
I would like to simply erase the XP partition and merge it with the main drive.
But the problem is that Boot Camp got expired and I can't use the application to do that.
Can anyone tell me how I can do that??
I am guessing that Disk Utility would be the one to use but I want to make sure I know what I am doing before I screw up anything...
Please help!!
Thanks.
