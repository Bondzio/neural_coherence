Im going to build a new desktop and need help selecting the components within my price range.
I play a lot of mmo's so im going to need pretty powerful system.
My budget is somewhere around $1,300 give or take a little.
So far i have decided on the processor (AMD Athlon 64 x2 Duel Core 6400+) and the video card (geforce 8800 GT).
I am open for suggestions on different processors and video cards if they will be better suited for the overall computer.
Thanks in advance to anyone responding.
