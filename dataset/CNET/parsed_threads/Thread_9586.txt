<s> Two pieces of info that might be useful: 1. </s>
<s> A link to the system requirements of the game 2. </s>
<s> More information about WHY you can't play it, like &quot;it doesn't recognise the mouse&quot; or &quot;it says the monitor doesn't have a supported resolution&quot; or &quot;it fails to install because it's the 64-bit version and I have a 32 bit OS&quot;. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> The list looks like a nice run of the mill machine that should run the game. </s>
<s> But the OS setup could be incorrect in some way so ask the maker. </s>
<s> As no maker was noted, I can't look into this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Are you saying, everything else works well even other games? </s>
<s> But, when you play FC3, it craps out. </s>
<s> What is the OS type? </s>
<s> Does FC3 even start to play? </s>
<s> What are the results of any other game? </s>
<s> have all the latest drivers and patches been installed? </s>
<s> How does the PC in general operate? </s>
<s> http://babysoftmurderhands.com/2012/12/far-cry-3-max-settings-graphics-system-requirements/ tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Requirements are met, The peripherals are fine, during the game it crashes, which is only 30 seconds into the cut scene. </s>
<s> The maker? </s>
<s> No, total war does not run that well, I am running windows 8, I just downloaded AMD catalyst and maxed out the clock and memory speed. </s>
<s> It ran through the beginning cut scene and into a few minutes of game play then crash. </s>
<s> I made sure to download the latest drivers and patches for the game. </s>
<s> It is based off Uplay, and patches the game before I play. </s>
<s> PC began with issues, MEMORY MANAGEMENT when I installed the RAM in a 2,4 pattern in the sense 1,2,3,4 slots i used slots 2 and 4. </s>
<s> That didn't help so I switched it to 1,2 and then installed another set of RAM in 3,4. </s>
<s> I dont have that issue anymore. </s>
<s> Members need to tell all about the machines. </s>
<s> If they leave out details we lose a few rounds asking for that detail. </s>
<s> We know that self built units usually suffer from lack to updates to the hardware such as BIOS, drivers for EVERYTHING plus those helper apps. </s>
<s> For example I got my old desktop out and what a dog. </s>
<s> I got lucky in that I do this a lot and did a quick research about what drivers and apps were needed. </s>
<s> I started with the BIOS and the missing nugget for this one was Intel's RST app. </s>
<s> That one is not a driver but for this machine, it's needed to get the performance up. </s>
<s> Ask your machine's maker for such a list. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'd try with default settings for clock and memory speed. </s>
<s> If it still doesn't you go back to the shop where you bought the PC and let them fix it under warranty. </s>
<s> What happens if you reinstall the game from the original disk without any patches? </s>
<s> It should work then.It's the first thing the shop will ask you: stock settings and a stock game to prove the machine is defective. </s>
<s> If you assembled it yourself (&quot;tried to make&quot; can be interpreted so) it's your own task to find out what's wrong. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I &quot;tried to assemble&quot; myself, this is the first pc I ever built. </s>
<s> I understand its my own task to find out whats wrong. </s>
<s> I am in this forum to learn from other peoples oversights, I may have missed something. </s>
<s> I will try to reinstall the game. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Are folk that install Windows and think it gets all the drivers and helper apps. </s>
<s> Even in Windows 8 this fails today. </s>
<s> It's up to the designer, builder and such to find all the updates, drivers and helper apps. </s>
<s> I can't guess all of them but if there is a downside to building it's this. </s>
<s> The upside is you learn more than you bargained for. </s>
<s> My short check list is to work from the bottom up. </s>
<s> I update the bios and if cards have firmware updates I do all that before I install the OS. </s>
<s> Then the OS goes in and I find drivers for motherboard, audio, video and then the helper apps such as Intel's RST, media controls, wifi control and more. </s>
<s> Figure on 10 to 15 packages on average. </s>

<s> The BIOS and Updates I will look into but I have updated both the hardware drives and helper apps like the AMD catalyst helped me actually get some play time, but still crashes. </s>
<s> I find fixing gaming problems too much of jumping thru the hoops. </s>
<s> What works for one game may not for another. </s>
<s> If you've a bunch of gaming, you'll find that easily is so. </s>
<s> Which is why i asked in my prior post. </s>
<s> Generally, speaking you have to settle the PC issues themselves before anything else. </s>
<s> In other words the PC must be in stock or default form, no hi-end setting or user introduced tweeks. </s>
<s> Just make sure it works beforew you move to gaming levels. </s>
<s> Then fine-tune the game to what the PC can offer. </s>
<s> The game setting are easier to adj. </s>
<s> than the PC, because the PC was working before you went the gaming route. </s>
<s> Which is why I offer in yet other posts, that basically want a &quot;top-end PC&quot; for gaming needs, because gaming is so power hungary for *ALL* resources whatever they may be. </s>
<s> Further, cooling is a big issue as i see it and better be good. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> The i3 is a decent cpu but it isn't all that great for gaming, though better than older cpus. </s>
<s> Next, the Win8 OS, well that's still open as how it handles gaming or what is still required for the best operation. </s>
<s> So, if you can accept basic or FC3 levels as they initially install, because it finds its own level of sorts. </s>
<s> If it seems to run then or not at all well, then maybe the PC itself still needs to be tweeked. </s>
<s> Tweeked as NOT simply asking for hi-performance setting but what makes the PC works with everything else besides gaming. </s>
<s> Any patches and drivers MUST be Win8 ready or capable, if MUST state so or be allowed using older Win7 offering. </s>
<s> Last, the game itself should support whatever is being given it. </s>
<s> Even, it accepts cpu level much lower than yours, it has to say somewhere, it supports the i3 from the makers itself. </s>
<s> Now, with all these drivers and patches and what have you, you basically create a new PC of sorts but do all these accept each other and not fall into a toxic mix. </s>
<s> Which is why i state, gaming problems tend to create issues regular PC won't see anywhere near as soon as loading some new game. </s>
<s> Also, since you build this yourself, you need to recheck all your work, don't take anything for granted, yeah sometimes a boo-boo takes along time accept if some small detail was forgotten. </s>
<s> If you like, I suggest you get PCWizard 2012 and load it to see all the variables of your system PC has. </s>
<s> It provides deep details and important real facts of just what you have installed h/w and s/w. </s>
<s> Google for it. </s>
<s> Last, sometimes you're too ahead of the gaming world. </s>
<s> Your h/w mix or system just needs a fix NOT YET available from the game maker. </s>
<s> You may want to check gaming websites to query there as those hot gamers may offer greater clues, tips, and/or hints to help you. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> As I read you are changing clocks from stock I see a big reason to crash. </s>
<s> -&gt; Did you go get the RAM &quot;specs&quot; and see if your BIOS settings match? </s>
<s> That's a pretty deep area that the maker of the PC (you in this case) have to sort out. </s>
<s> It's an area that can really torque folk since they never imagined how much detail is required to integrate parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I never knew RAM had to be BIOS matched I always thought as long as it fit the slot it was fine. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
