<s> Some scientific software has 64 bit versions but for many the machines will be nice even when we run 32-bit apps. </s>

<s> is there any extra eye candy to the new software running on 64? </s>
<s> I've only seen 64-bit versions of Linux, Vista, XP and no extra eyecandy. </s>
<s> However this area is important to a lot of scientific endeavors since the 32 bit address space (we get to talk about virtual memory operating systems) is not big enough for some work. </s>
<s> Off the top of my head is the astronomy area. </s>
<s> It's a big universe with big numbers. </s>
