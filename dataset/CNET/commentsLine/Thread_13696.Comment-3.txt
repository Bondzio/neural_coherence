a weak or poor aged psu is the cause of many a problem.
since, you've installed new added devices and its already 4+yrs.
old, well you have reached the limit.
it'll actually boot-up under repeated attempts but its really the overall strain of providing all the amps to get the drives going etc.
to pass a point where it will boot-up.
imho, as robert explained i agree 100%, just replace the psu before it causes some real damage, because if it fails it may take something with it.
look at a generic 500w or better psu, name brand being better.
