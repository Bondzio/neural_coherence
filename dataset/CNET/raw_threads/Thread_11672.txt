I have a router in our office (which has four desktop computers) and i want to extend the network to our conference room, which unfortunately is beyond the reach of the router's wi-fi. I am contemplating on using repeaters for the signal to reach the conference room and then then installing a network bridge (with wi-fi) to network the desktop computers there and facilitate wi-fi access. Another option is to connect the router in the office with a bridge on the conference room with cables. Or is it better to just connect even the desktops in the conference room via wi-fi?
