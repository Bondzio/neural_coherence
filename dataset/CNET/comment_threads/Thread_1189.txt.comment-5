I was watching a tech-tv show a while back and they were talking about hd's and ata100 vs ata133.
What they were saying was in THEIR tests they saw very little diff.
However they did see a diff with hd cache size, bigger is better.
So if you want to run the tech-tv benchmarks get the bigger cache.
Do you need the bigger cache to run your stuff??
I have no idea.
I'm thinking most folks won't see a diff.
