1.1.1	Is there a security appliance available that provides anti-malware protection , firewall , content filtering , etc , AND has no subscription or maintainance fee ( or optional fees ) ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	There are a lot that you can run on the PC itself but once you get to wanting to run them on a router/appliance everyone wants money .	St
1.2.2	If you are not looking for a business grade solution what works is to take a router that you can load the user written firmware like tomato on .	St
1.2.3	You can then force the DNS server to use OPENDNS site .	St
1.2.4	This site has a free content filter ... mostly .	St
1.2.5	Their are many firewall and IDP options in the user firmware releases .	St
1.2.6	Of course this does not stop someone who knows how host files work .	St
