i will look into each suggestion further.
but the stop gap measure that i tried seems to working, and indicates an overheating problem.
i have the side panel off the unit, and have a fan blowing directly on the computer.
it has stayed on for 12 hours or more at a time.
i can see where these forums are a big help for those of us who are a bit mechanically inclined.
thank you.
