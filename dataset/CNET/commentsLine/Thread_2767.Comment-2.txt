you're getting the fastest, most expensive video card available, but pairing it with a low-rent mobo.
don't cheap out on your motherboard.
get a p965 based one (msi, asus, and biostar all have better alternatives for $110-$130).
i assume you're making a killer gaming rig.
if so, 1gig is just adequate enough.
many new games want 1gig for smooth gameplay and benchmarks show that some benefit from more.
if you plan on moving to vista, then i recommend getting 2gig right off the bat even if you have to 'downgrade' to ddr2-800 (ocx soe is a good choice).
lastly, spring for the extra $30 and get windows media center edition.
the vista basic upgrade for xp home doesn't even include aero support.
