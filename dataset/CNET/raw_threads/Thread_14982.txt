I wanted to be able to share files from one computer to another, thus far I have been unable to do so. On the Vista computer I can see the XP computer's shared files, however when I try to access them I get the following messages: &quot;oldhp&quot; my playlist is not accesable. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact Administrator of this server to find out if you have access Permissions.&quot; &quot;not enough server storage available to process this command.&quot; 1. I am the administrator for both of these computers. 2. On the Vista there is over 250 GB of free space on the HD. On the oldhp computer there is 115GB of free space. 3. The Vista OS is on a Wireless HP Multia Media computer m8430f and the XP OS is on a HP Multia Media computer m470n. Note the XP OS is XP Professional and not the original XP Multia Media. All thoughts and suggestions appreciated. After receiving thoughts and suggestions on this post I will do a post on the Windows 7 problems. In the windows 7 I don't see the XP computer, however I can see the Vista computer and my XB system. Thanks WTC

Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6127_102-0.html?threadID=381203&tag=forums06;forum-threads And that's just the opening list of things to do. Just like before you get to deal with accounts, permissions, shares, network names, workgroup names and the rest. There is no &quot;connect now button.&quot; (but we wish there were.) Bob
