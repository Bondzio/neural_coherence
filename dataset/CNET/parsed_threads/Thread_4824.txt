<s> Hello, Im looking for someone who has a bit more knowledge about AGP video cards and BIOS setting than I do. </s>
<s> Im considering upgrading my video card from 256mb to 512mb. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimension 8300. </s>
<s> I was poking around the systems settings (accessible before the OS boots up), and I noticed a setting for AGP Aperture. </s>
<s> I can set it for 32mb, 64mb, 128mb or 256mb. </s>
<s> What is the significance of these settings? </s>
<s> The Manual makes no mention of them. </s>
<s> What would happen if I installed an AGP card with 512mb of memory? </s>
<s> It wouldnt work? </s>
<s> Only 256 out of 512 mbs would be used because the AGP Aperture setting only goes up to 256mb??? </s>
<s> Anyone out there have experience with this sort of thing? </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=AGP+aperture+settings&btnG=Google+Search Read a few of these... </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
