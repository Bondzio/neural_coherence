but without make, model and how things are connected we are often left with no where to start.
sorry about that.
&quot;because the hub will not work from router ports.&quot; armed with that clue i am still missing the make/model of the hub.
some have the automdx feature, some don't.
my answer is that you didn't wire to the uplink port but without the make/model i can't be sure of that answer.
