http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941651 lists the files WMP 11 uses.
For Vista those are pretty new but that's not what I'm thinking.
I could use this article to find those files and see if any are missing or older than what is noted in this article.
Again, this is not a cure.
Only something I would do to figure out what's up.
