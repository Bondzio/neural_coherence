noted that 6 out of 21 supplies were not able to deliver on their ratings.
as such, the rule of thumb for a reliable pc is to fit a power supply that your machine will draw about 1/2 the rated watts.
i'd peg the 250 watt supply to, on average consume about 100 watts on a pre-built machine.
and about 150 watts if the user upgraded the machine.
