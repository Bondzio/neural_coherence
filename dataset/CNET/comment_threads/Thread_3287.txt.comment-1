I'm a webmaster currently running a PowerBook G4 (1.67GHz with 2GB RAM).
I'm going to upgrade very soon, but need the best for all the applications I'm running.
I use CS3, usually with at least 4 of the apps running simultaneously, plus Firefox, Entourage, and iChat.
I will also be adding Final Cut Studio to the mix.
Will the MBP with 4GB RAM be enough or should I go for the Mac Pro where upgrades and more RAM are possible?
Also, is anyone running those same programs on a MBP?
Any issues?
Thanx!
