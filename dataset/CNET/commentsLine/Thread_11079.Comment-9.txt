hopefully with the introduction of vista microsoft will correct this fundamental problem.
i can't really see it though, microsoft have their lot in with usb (financially) and developing support for firewire which has a superior actual throughrate than usb 2.0 (according to cnet znet and other major hardware reviewers) would just be throwing money away!!
n.b.
microsot get royalties every time a device is created for usb so the more usb devices the more money they make (for those who dont already know that).
