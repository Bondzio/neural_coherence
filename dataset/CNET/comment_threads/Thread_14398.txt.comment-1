My XP home system just started telling me that it does not detect the hard drive on boot.
I used revovery from the XP install cd and ran chkdsk /p and chkdsk /f and fixmbr and fixboot.
It found errors with the chkdsk /f, but I thought it fixed them.
Still doesn't see drives on boot.
bios setup doesn't see them either.
My question is: Do I need a new hard drive to fix this or is it something else?
