i find it interesting that nobody seems to have addressed several items that come to my mind: 1) does the user do a regular defrag on his/her computer?
2) has the user installed a lot of other software over the years and maybe uninstalled some of those programs?
3) does the user have a registry cleaning program that is used on a regular basis?
these are just some of the items that a user (especially a novice) often overlooks that will eventually cause a pc to slow down.
as with anything you own, you have to maintain it properly to keep it in good working order.
of course, there's also the problem aging, which gets to humans and machines both eventually.
