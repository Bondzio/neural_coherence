hi and thanks for replying.
the card has a heatpipe so there are no fans involved.the slot on the mobo is agp 3 type at 1.5 volt, the video card is a 1.5 volt as well.
there is no notch at the end of the slot that i can see.
as i said earlier, my 6800le works fine, this is why i thought there may have been an incompatibility.
this system is in the corner of my living room, so the card being silent was a big decision in it's purchase.
grrr.
i have found a bios update on the epox site and reflashed this morning before coming to work, so i'll check again tonight and let you know if that cures it.
