<s> Hi, I plugged my seagate portable drive into my mac and It found straight away and I could access the files. </s>
<s> However, on the second attempt the mac reported that the drive was not recognized. </s>
<s> I tried on my pc and it found the hardware but was asking me to format drive. </s>
<s> I have over 200 gb of stuff on there and I cant access it. </s>
<s> How do I recover all the files without great expense as it is mainly films and music! </s>
<s> What type of &quot;open?&quot; 1. </s>
<s> Opening the drive letter on Windows Explorer? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Opening the Seagate case to get the drive out? </s>
<s> In closing did you try these titles found with google? </s>
<s> GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY Bob </s>
