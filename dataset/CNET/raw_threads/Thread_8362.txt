With 3 fans, i can do that without a btx case. I only have 1 out fan 80mm (unlike your 120mm) and 1 pci exhaust fan. No psu fan. Total 3 fans, and 1 smaller than 2 of yours, runs at 46-49 idle,but processor fan the loudest is spinning at 100%. If i had another fan, which my oem case cant accomodate without a mod, and a $10 tube of ac5, i could probably get the same thing. ROger

Where are you looking at (Link-URL) and at what price? They seem to run from $1300 to $1500 with a 17'' LCD Monitor. Some things to consider: The 819 is a Pent 4 3.2GHz and has the 540 series processor that does not have the 64-bit support that is in the 6xx series or the new ''dual-core'' processors that is in the 8xx series. My suggestion would be one of these new Gateway computers that have both 64-bit & dual-core processors Gateway Model 835GM Media Center PC at Best Buy with 17'' LCD monitor & printer for $1069.97 Has the Intel Pentium D processor 820 dual-core 2.8GHz. http://tinyurl.com/chdc6 Or the Gateway Model 840GM Media Center PC with 17''LCDmonitor & printer and ATI TV Tuner & PVR for $1269.97. Has the Intel Pent D Processor 830 dual-core 3.0GHz http://tinyurl.com/bwwcl
