<s> i have an old comp laying around and i want to make a gaming pc so my dad has let me open it up for an upgrade. </s>
<s> byt the way the computer is an old Dell Dimension 3000 heres what i plan to put in a nvidia geforce 8800 GT for 250$ 2 gigs of ram for 69$ and a 320gig HD for 80$ my only concern is if my dell can run the 8800? </s>
<s> any other things u guys notice lemme know </s>
<s> It depends on the available slots. </s>
<s> For video cards that's AGP (old), PCI (common) and PCI-E (latest). </s>
<s> Check the specs of both your PC and the videocard to see if there's a match. </s>
<s> Also, this being an OLD machine, check if can handle 2 Gb RAM, a 320 Gb hard disk, and if the CPU is fast enough to handle the games you want. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> sorry but i am an idiot when it comes to this... so how would i go about checking these things? </s>
<s> also can a pentium 4 work with the GT? </s>
<s> It's at http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim3000/en/SM/index.htm Ouch!!!. </s>
<s> This unit has a 250 WATT PSU and no AGP or PCIe slots. </s>
<s> Not only does it not have a slot for the AGP or newer PCIe card but the power supply isn't up to the task. </s>
<s> -&gt; Sorry. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so i buy a new power supply that aint that big a deal? </s>
<s> and is there anything i can do to add PCI slot? </s>
<s> But for this video card you need AGP or PCIe slots which your machine doesn't have. </s>
<s> A new motherboard could mean new RAM, new power supply and a new LICENSE to the OS since it's usually locked to the old hardware. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> basically it means that you would have to replace 90% of the stuff in the computer if you wanted to upgrade... </s>
<s> Your better off building or buying a new system. </s>
<s> -as a side note you can build your own system with specs (including the parts you used) for about $800. </s>
<s> Something to consider. </s>
<s> find one, you couldn't install it in your system. </s>
<s> Your system doesn't have a PCIe slot. </s>
<s> Anyone that has a decent price on the 8800GT doesn't have 'em in stock. </s>
<s> As others have indicated...you're better off getting a new box with the desired peripherals and the video card you want. </s>
<s> To keep your cost down you could also look at the new ATI 3800 series ... they are available from the $175 to the $220 (and more for some vendors) VAPCMD </s>
<s> do ATI cards also need PCI e or AGP? </s>
<s> Your Dell System has 'built-in or what some call onboard graphics&quot;. </s>
<s> Systems using onboard graphics use regular system memory for video RAM. </s>
<s> So if your system has 256MBs system RAM ....and if your onboard video system was using 64MBs RAM...your usable system memory would be reduced to 192MBs RAM. </s>
<s> Your Dell Dimension 3000 has 3 expansion slots for peripherals but they're not PCIe (the latest and greatest) and not AGP (the previous generation latest and greatest) it has PCI. </s>
<s> So the only video card you could buy and add to your current system would have to be PCI. </s>
<s> That's the only interface option your system has for adding peripherals like graphics cards. </s>
<s> Given the limitations a PCI video card places on gaming performance you're better off selling the existing system and putting your $$ into a system designed for gaming. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I don't know if you've made a decision about your plans to upgrade. </s>
<s> May I suggest you reconsider and add a few more dollars to the $400 upgrade estimate and get something more powerful and new. </s>
<s> The Celeron processor that comes with the Dimension 3000 is not a gaming processor, even if you can put the graphics card you want in it. </s>
<s> That processor is barely good enough to multi task regular office applications. </s>
<s> Look at TigerDirect.com Go to motherboard / CPU combos link. </s>
<s> Sort by price. </s>
<s> They have a great motherboard with a GE Force 8400 video card for around $100 after rebate. </s>
<s> Add a dual-core cpu, cpu fan, and 2 gig of high speed RAM ($29 after rebate) and you've spent barely $400 (without shipping), which gives you room to ad a nice hard drive. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> The XP OS that came with that XP won't transplant. </s>
