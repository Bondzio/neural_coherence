<s> i recently purchased a few brand new TDK 8x dvd+r i have a lite-on 1693s brand new 16x burner when i go to nero 6 express i was unable to selected 4x write speed. </s>
<s> i know 8x dvds should be burnt at half the speed, but nero 6 only allow me to selected 6x speed minimum. </s>
<s> i had no choice, so i burnt the disc anyway, but after the burn was complete, the drive was able to read it, i edject it out and load it back in, the drive makes alot of clicking noises, the dvds cannot be read. </s>
<s> is there anyway for me to force my drive to burn at 4x? </s>
<s> please help me, please help me i beg you please HELP! </s>
<s> The old theory about burning media at 4x speed is for reliabilty. </s>
<s> Burning at 8x transfers huge amounts of data quickly form one media to another, and can lead more often to errors in the burn process, or corruption of data. </s>
<s> It's easier to burn data more successfully and slower at 4x, than try repeatedly and fail a few times at 8x....but things move on. </s>
<s> If the media says 8x, and your drive has 8x...burn at 8x. </s>
<s> Just because earliest 8x media and drives weren't up to the task, doesn't mean that is always, or still, the case. </s>
<s> The problem here doesn't appear to be the speed at all. </s>
<s> As you successfully recorded and read the the disk at 6x, (see that old &quot;8x at 4x&quot; plan is now a myth! </s>
<s> ), the problem is something related to reading the disk AFTER you ejected. </s>
<s> Make sure when you record disks that &quot;Enable multisession&quot; is not selected (press the &quot;More&quot; button for some hidden options), and that &quot;Finalize Disk&quot; is on. </s>
<s> Multisession disks are those without an end point, but these tend to be written and read perfectly in the drive that made them. </s>
<s> What is odd is that you can record, and read, but then can't read after ejecting. </s>
<s> Best to buy some re-writable DVD's and experiment, and remember not all media and drives are compatible. </s>
<s> Do a search, and see if others are having the same problem. </s>
<s> Google'd : lite-on 1693 problems (returned some that might be of use to you) Good luck, GeeBee </s>
<s> for me is CD only. </s>
<s> DVDs all run at max speed as determined by Nero on auto. </s>
<s> Never had a problem. </s>
<s> Even K3b in Linux runs eveything on auto with no problems. </s>
<s> The issue seems to be an XP and CD issue. </s>
<s> That being said, you should be able to choose any speed below maximum of media. </s>
