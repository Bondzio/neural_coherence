there will always be machines that will be sent &quot;dead on arrival&quot;.
the best thing you can do is to immediately test the machine and if it doesn't work, send it back and get another one, or demand a full refund.
i know ppls who have had no problems with the machine.
if you're lucky, you'll get a working one, if not, well do what i just suggested.
if you don't want to take the risk, build your own pc.
because all computer manufacuturers have these sort of problems.
