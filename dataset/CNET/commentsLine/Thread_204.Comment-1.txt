i need a better way to backup the 4 computers in my office.
3 of them run winxp and 1 runs win98 (it's used for scanning & fax receiving).
they are networked peer to peer through a linksys 4 port router.
i currently use cd's to backup the data only (not the programs).
i am hoping for something that duplicates the hard drive so if a computer died or internal hard drive failed i could transfer the contents to a new computer or hard drive without having to reinstall all of the original software then restore data.
i am intrigued by the maxtor one touch ii because of its simplicity and also by the fact that i can unplug it to isolate it from lightning strikes, etc.
however, it's a little pricey to buy 4 of them, especially when i have less than 100mb of data on all 4 computers combined.
i am not a techie but i would imagine it would need a separate partition for each computer.
am i dreaming?
what would you suggest?
thanks in advance for any help offered.
