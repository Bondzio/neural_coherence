i voted somewhat important.
i don't play games or edit video so i don't need the fastest thing out there.
i like to watch movies on my pc so i need something a little faster than the cheapest.
and i don't like the video using my ram either.
so i spend about $50.00 and for the most part i have been happy with what i get.
