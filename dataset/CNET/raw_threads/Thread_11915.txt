I would like to do this because I have a 256mb ATI Radeon X1600 graphics card that works pretty well, but with some new games coming out I will not be getting the optimal performance I want. Would it be better to just replace my graphics card with a better one, or get a second graphics card and run them simultaneously? I don't know how to tell if I have another slot on my computer for another graphics card nor do I know if my motherboard is compatible, how would I tell for these two things? I don't know if listing my pc hardware would help but here is what I know: Windows XP Media Center 2002 SP 2. AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 5000+ 2.61ghz 2.00 GB RAM Any help with this would be appreciated.
