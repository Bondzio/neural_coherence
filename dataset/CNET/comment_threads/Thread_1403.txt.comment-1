My Windows 2000sp4 does not have msconfig.
I finally found it in a folder (which I didn't creat,on an old HD) XParchive.
I think MicroSoft is doing us dirt.
The subfolder was $ntservicepackuninstall$ and in that folder I found sp1.
That was a good progam, I used to use it.
I also checked my WindowsXP Pro sp2.
No where on the SCSI main drive or a 200GB drive which used Windows 2000 until it would no longer boot.
