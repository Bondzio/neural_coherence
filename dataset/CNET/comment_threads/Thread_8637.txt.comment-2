When you plug in the USB drive this likely leads to Windows starting to process to communicate with that device and possibly index the files or other things that add more work to the processor.
The Yahoo!
issue is likely due to how Yahoo!
has configured their web-based e-mail to have a lot of something called AJAX so that there is quite a bit of JavaScript to be downloaded when you first hit the page as well as run various scripts.
I don't have any suggestions for fans and heatsinks but I would suggest reading up on various reviews so that you do get what should work best for you.
