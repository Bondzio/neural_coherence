i should probably mention that just because a computer came from dell or gateway or whoever that doesn't mean it's mainboard was manufactured by them.
in fact i don't think any major computer retailer makes their own mainboards.
they usually buy them in bulk from companies such as gigabyte or soyo.
most decent mainboards will be marked with a manufaturer name and model number or fcc-id.
i have run across a few mainboards without any identifying marks at all, not even an fcc-id.
in this case you'll have to contact the system builder to ask them for specs on the mainboard.
