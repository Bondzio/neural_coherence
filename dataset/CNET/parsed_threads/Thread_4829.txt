<s> i have an hp dv2000z laptop(ie amd chips) w an interal broadcom wireless b/g card w bluetooth. </s>
<s> it has been working for a year. </s>
<s> all of a sudden the computer cannot detect it. </s>
<s> strangely the bluetooth seems to work fine. </s>
<s> button switch is blue. </s>
<s> wireless just doesn't work. </s>
<s> no networks detected. </s>
<s> card not even there. </s>
<s> is it something loose? </s>
<s> card just fritzed out? </s>
<s> can an automatic update interfere w something? </s>
<s> i don't think it's a driver issue, but then again... </s>
<s> Let's try the simple thing. </s>
<s> Also since it's XP try system restore to when it worked. </s>
<s> when i move the switch back and forth it goes from orange to blue indicating the antenna is on and as i said, the bluetooth on the card still works. </s>
<s> the antenna icon indicates that it likewise goes on and off. </s>
<s> hp wireless asst says the bluetooth is on as well, but reads no wireless card as it used to. </s>
<s> the wireless b/g has disappeared from the the list of devices and the hp wireless asst. </s>
<s> since the bluetooth and the wireless b/g are supposedly on the same broadcom card, i find it odd that only the wireless portion seems to have disappeared. </s>
<s> Don't discount that the card is dead. </s>
<s> Call it in and get them to send another. </s>
<s> I found this card to be easy to swap out. </s>
<s> If you are fixing it yourself did you remove AC, battery and unplug, snap it back in and retest? </s>
<s> Is there a BIOS setting to disable it? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> took out the battery and the card. </s>
<s> although i didn't disconnect the 2 wires to the card. </s>
<s> replaced. </s>
<s> no change. </s>
<s> at this point i am going to assume that it is either the card or the connection between the card and the computer. </s>
<s> so i think i'll get a card and try to replace it. </s>
<s> at this point, i hope that that's the problem w the least troublesome solution. </s>
<s> can anyone tell me how to disconnect/reconnect the 2 wires? </s>
<s> i don't know how it attaches... screw, clasp over a bulb... snap? </s>
<s> Rotate them as you pull on them... </s>
<s> just ordered the replacement card and crossing my fingers it isn't a problem w mini-pci slot. </s>
<s> thanks for the input. </s>
<s> Hey guys, I had the same problem, I found out this hp forum thread which I think is extremaly useful and informative http://forums11.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do?admit=109447626+1202189315721+28353475&threadId=1189747 In my understanding, it does have to do with a design failure of the components that makes very easy to overheat the area near the wireless card, so the MB-Card connection gets hurt. </s>
<s> They've put a BIOS update to force the fan to go faster and remove that heat ... </s>
<s> My blue light comes and goes. </s>
<s> When it goes, the wireless card and driver cannot even be detected. </s>
<s> Then it come back unexpectedly a day or two later and it is easily detected. </s>
<s> What is the problem? </s>
<s> I've had my Pavilion TX2000 for almost 5 years now and never had any problems except recently my wireless card just stopped working, Device Manager does not read Broadcom even when I reinstall the driver, blue light comes on after hours of shutdown but disappears when I do a restart, nothing works even when I try to configure BIOS, log in to Safe Mode with Networking, etc. </s>
<s> Unless you are sure that it is really the card itself that's defective (hardware), try this instead. </s>
<s> It's how I fixed mine and its been working 100%. </s>
<s> 1) With your laptop off, remove the wireless card from its slot, make sure the plates are clean then reinstall into the laptop. </s>
<s> 2) Remove the laptop battery and use direct power source. </s>
<s> 3) Backup all your files and do a complete reformat. </s>
<s> 4) Update Windows to the latest Service Pack available from Microsoft. </s>
<s> Goodluck! </s>
