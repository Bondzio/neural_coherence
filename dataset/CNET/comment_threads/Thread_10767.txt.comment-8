I shoulda mentioned not to mess w/ the domain name in my last post, I apologize for that.
Unfortuneatly I do not know how you can set this up having your laptop on a domain.
The IT people at your school may be able to tell you how to make the shared folder accessable to your laptop (most likely it is due to a setting on your laptop).
Good luck!
