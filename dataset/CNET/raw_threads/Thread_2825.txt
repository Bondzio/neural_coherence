Hello, I'm thinking of getting a new video card, a GTX460 (in particular: the EVGA 01G-P3-1373-AR GeForce GTX 460 Superclocked EE 1GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI Support Video Card). I have an MSI 890GXM-G65 motherboard and an AMD PhenomII 955 cpu, and they all seem to be compatible. Of course one hears alot about how nVidia cards are supposed to go with Intel boards/cpus and ATI with AMD and so forth. I don't know much about computers, though. Can anyone see any problems that may occur here? Thanks!

Did you check the card for size for fit in your case ? Based on the price of the proposed GPU...you might check out the 560 series too. VAPCMD

I built the pc myself really didn't skimp on anything. As far the size of my case, I haven't measured or anything, but I have a pretty big case: Cooler Master HAF 922. The &quot;24 amps&quot; part of your response interests me. Can I make more or less power come from my psu? Also, may I infer from your response that I should not expect any problems running an nVidia gpu on an AMD board? Thanks again

Re which card...here's a good reference for comparing performance and price. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-performance-radeon-geforce,3018.html Then I'd head over to Newegg.com and see what looks good in terms of rating and price. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007709%20600007856&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;name=PCI%20Express%202.1%20x16 Let us know how it turns out.
