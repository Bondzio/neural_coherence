1.1.1	Hi there, first of all I'm new to the CNET forums but not CNET.com itself.	St
1.1.2	I'm trying to make a fairly powerful desktop computer for ~$1300-1400(CAD) before taxes.	St
1.1.3	I will be running 64-bit Windows 7.	St

St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319 Great user ratings (including mine), larger cache buffer (32MB vs 16MB) and 5yr (Black) vs 3yr (Blue)warranty.	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD PS...Did you look at the i860 ?	Ques
1.3.1	750i chipset is only for core2duo/quad.	St
1.3.2	for core i7 920 you'll need a mobo with an x58 chipset but they're generally $200CAD and higher.	St
1.3.3	suggest you consider a core i7-860 ($330CAD) and a gigabyte ga-p55 or msi p55 ($120CAD).	Sug
1.3.4	a single radeon hd 5850 $290CAD will be comparable to dual gtx 260 and run cooler.	St
1.3.5	if you must have dual 260s, an sli-enabled p55 mobo will be about $25 due to the nvidia license fee.	St
1.4.1	Thank you both, I'm unsure if I will bother switching the hard drive or not yet but I have solved the motherboard issue.	St
1.4.2	My only problem now is that the Radeon HD 5850 is over $350 on tigerdirect.ca for any of the versions they have.	St
1.5.1	they're $290CAD but sold out at newegg.ca but should be available in a week or so.	St
1.5.2	hd 4850 benchmarks	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Getting 140GB more disk space on a highly rated drive (including mine), with larger cache buffer (32MB vs 16MB), 5yr (Black) vs 3yr (Blue) warranty for $5.00 more makes a lot of sense to me.	St
1.7.2	Good Luck on your system.	St
1.7.3	VAPCMD	St
