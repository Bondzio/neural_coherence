When I plugged it back in it showed up under My Computer, but I cant access the drive. I get an error that says You must format the disk before you can use it I tried to check the drive for errors, but it said the same thing again. I have about 450gb of data that I cant afford to lose. Is their some way around re-formatting? Or is their away to format, but not lose any of my data? Please help!! External Hard Drive: WD My Book 500gb O/S: Vista Home

VAPCMD PS...With the only copy of your data on an external HDD, it's only a matter of time before you lose it all or pay dearly to get it back.
