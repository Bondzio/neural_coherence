1.1.1	I have my internal hard drive set up with 3 partitions .	St
1.1.2	on the 1st partition I have XP sp1 .	St
1.1.3	I use that for a backup operating system .	St
1.1.4	On the 2nd partition I have XP sp3 and I use it as my primary operating system .	St
1.1.5	The 3rd partition is the largest and I use it just for storage .	St
1.1.6	I dont really need it because I recently purchased a large external drive .	St
1.1.7	I really want to try the Linux based Ubuntu operating system .	St
1.1.8	Can I install it on the 3rd partition ?	Ques
1.2.1	Here 's the rub , you can install as many OSes as you like & quot ; PROVIDED & quot ; they do n't interfere with each other .	St
1.2.2	Now , saying that and doing that are two different things .	St
1.2.3	Trail and error is the most instructive lesson you can learn .	St
1.2.4	You already got a difficult setup now with XP sp1 and sp3 both installed .	St
1.2.5	So , if you do n't want your hard work wasted , take it one step at a time .	St
1.2.6	The boot.ini file will have to involved during all this , so I suggest you save the current working one and/or NTldr file to return to before if all fails .	St
1.2.7	In a round about way , if you 've tried the & quot ; live Ubuntu CD version & quot ; you get an idea how that OS will work .	St
1.2.8	You can & quot ; sandbox & quot ; it using a & quot ; virtual setup & quot ; allowing its install within its parameters and see how things work .	St
1.2.9	Google more for virtual and check it out .	St
1.2.10	I assume you already have some arrangement now to tell which OS to boot , like the startup menu .	St

1.3.1	On primary drive , download and run the WUBI installer , should n't be an issue , assuming you have enough drive space .	St
1.3.2	requires about 17 GB .	St
1.4.1	I got her running .	St
1.4.2	Now I 'm having trouble trying to figure out how to install my linksys wmp300n wireless card and radeon graphics card .	St
1.4.3	windows is all I 've ever known .	St
1.4.4	I 'll be patient .	St
1.5.1	You usual place to see if any drivers are available is to check the maker 's support website .	St
1.5.2	If not there or unavailable then google away fro linux versions or the Linux world of things .	St
1.5.3	It really makes a difference in that the more common ( or popular ) a device is the more likely you 'll find Linux support for it .	St
1.5.4	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Go to APPLICATIONS , UBUNTU SOFTWARE , then look in SYSTEM TOOLS .	St
1.7.1	I found a bunch of stuff on how to install the drivers .	St
1.7.2	It looks pretty complicated though .	Polite
1.7.3	Not stuff I 'm familiar with .	St
1.7.4	I 'm going to give it a try in a few days .	St
1.7.5	It 's a pain in the butt having to pull my graphics card out each time I want to boot Ubuntu .	St
1.7.6	Otherwise the system hangs up on boot .	St
1.7.7	I 'm a single dad with 2 toddlers and my littlest one was diagnosed with pnuemonia today so I 'm gon na just spend time with him and come back to it when he 's healthy .	St
1.7.8	thank you .	Polite
1.7.9	sincerely , Steve	St
