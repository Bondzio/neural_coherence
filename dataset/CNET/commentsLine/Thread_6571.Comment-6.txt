and you someday want to risk it, that unit might also be a tsstcompcd/dvdw sh-s182d by samsung.
i've used many samsungs with many softwares.
i can't test your unit for you but it it gets to the point you are going to trash it then here's the firmware to try.
sorry, i am not endorsing this in any way shape or form but as reference material as a last ditch idea prior to the scrap heap.
