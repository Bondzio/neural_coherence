But I'm still using 266 ram. I forget do I have to get 333 ram? Or can I use the 2 512mb 2100 266 ram I have? It'll be a little bit slower. But will it still work or do I have to get 333 ram? Or I can under clock. The bios allows me to set the cpu at 100, 133, or 166. Don't know if under clocking is safe. I know overclocking is not but under clocking? ivnj

And if I set the board to 5:1 I can use 133 ran and 333 cpu. Or I can set both cpu and ram to 133. I just don't want to buy new ram since I already have 1gb. So I guess I'll just try it and see how it goes. Now I just need a new fan capable of supporting a 2800+ Socket a. ivnj
