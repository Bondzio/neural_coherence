I have an eee pc asus 1005hab netbook.
I have had to replace the hard drive and so I am currently installing a new copy of xp.
I have downloaded all the drivers from asus.com and will start installing those when the operating system in completely installed.
I was wondering if anybody had thoughts on the order in which the drivers should be installed.
I would also like to know what is not necessary and which optional programs I should install.
I have been to the asus site but they had no suggestions that I could find.
Thank you.......
