hi thanks for your time... i was trying to get some help because one either can choose to use the clone or backup utility of the acronis program, with the use of a windows deployment tool.
picking the right one will bring everything over to a new machine in the case of emergency.
i did it once before a year ago from an acer laptop to my newer custom built machine... and i simply forgot which option to choose... old age i guess.
i'll try both, and get the answer... thanks.
