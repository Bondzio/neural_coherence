I have disconnected the modem electrically and also reset it to no avail. I did this with a Tech from my ISP. I read a lot of business articles on CNBC. My computer downloads a printed page, then freezes and the print disappears leaving me a totally white page. After 5 seconds the printed page reappears and the mouse wheel becomes operational about 5 seconds after that. This also happens when I download some page from the internet that is not a page of print. That is, the system just seems to freeze and then after a few seconds I can navagate in the page with my mouse. Is this a buffering problem? Could the problem be with my OS, Win XP? Any help to cure this greatfully appreciated.

Example at http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html Also, while you are in there, check if the CPU heat sink is on proper. Another member had such issues and they found the heat sink was connected with only 3 of the 4 pins. Bob

I use Outlook Express and once a month I delete all of the files in the Outbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, and Drafts. In Internet Explorer about once a month I delete all of the files Temporary Internet files, Cookies, History of websites visited and InPrivatae Filtering Data. I don't think I have the knowledge or skills to check the CPU heat sink. This problem is relatively new, like a month, so I doubt that could be the problem. But, if I can't get it fixed, I take it in to a shop and tell them to check the heat sink.

It seems sometimes it wants to load a large piece of the file before it displays it but it does not tell you it is still downloading. If you mess with when its in this condition I have had it then refuse to load that document untill I clear all the cache things. For links that are PDF files you can generally get around this right click the link and save as. If you have issue on general web pages that are HTML only hard to say .... I tend to blame the firewall/virus software first for any strange problems.

If you are not doing this yearly then your machine eventually has issues very much like you posted. I have begun to wonder if this is why most folk buy new machines. They don't do the basic maintenance. Bob

If I go to my home page, CNBC, it isn't interrupted but it probably takes more than 10 seconds to load because there's such a lot of content. The last things to load are the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P figures and then I can go to other articles or videos offereb by the site. Another thing I've noticed is that while the my computer seems to be stalled or the download is still going on, I can move my mouse arrow around but neither the left or right buttons work nor does the wheel word. In addition, the arrow doesn't change into an hourglass to indicate it is downloading.
