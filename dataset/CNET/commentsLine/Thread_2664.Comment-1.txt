we have a lot of video footage from our various vacations.
as you can imagine it is precious stuff we don't want to lose!
looking through various sites on the internet, i am not clear on what the most robust and reliable storage mechanism is.
some considerations: 1. internal vs. external: i know internal is cheaper, but which is likely to last longer?
2. docking station for internal hard drive: a friend recommended this, but my concern is won't the internal drive degrade if you either: (i) leave it sticking out of a docking station; or (ii) continually insert it and remove it.
3. external drive with enclosure: is this worth considering, and how would it compare with (2) for longevity and reliability?
4. raid solutions: have read a bit about data redundant solutions, but have no real idea how to set this up.
what would i need and how would i set it up?
thanks in advance for advice!
