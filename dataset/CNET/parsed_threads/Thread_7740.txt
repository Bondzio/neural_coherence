<s> Hi guys, Here is the problem. </s>
<s> I will try to make it easy and simple. </s>
<s> Every time I turn my computer off, Windows XP shuts down, the monitor turns off, but the CPU fan and the back panel fan keep running. </s>
<s> Even the DVD rom light still ON, but does not eject unless the computer is ON. </s>
<s> Any help will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Rapheek </s>
<s> Isn't it time to repeat all the prior advice? </s>
<s> As to the DVD rom. </s>
<s> It's not required for booting so why not unplug that? </s>
<s> What prior advice you are talking about! </s>
<s> It could be that your system is in STANDBY, if not, the first thing to look at from a hardware standpoint is the PSU, I would check settings, BIOS etc. </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7586_102-515679/computer-not-starting-up/ is just one of many. </s>
<s> It appears your machine needs repairs and maybe it's time to replace parts or the machine. </s>
<s> For now, unplug that DVD. </s>
