<s> Hi, I just built a new comp. </s>
<s> from the ground up, and for some reason the onboard LAN will not connect to my ISP (perhaps the ISP won't recognize it, not sure.) </s>
<s> I have the new comp. </s>
<s> sitting right next to the old one. </s>
<s> With the cable in the old one (Windows XP, Dell Dimension) there is no problem - the DSL connects fine, IP address auto detected, smooth as you like. </s>
<s> The ISP assigns this comp. </s>
<s> a fixed IP address; always the same. </s>
<s> But the new computer (Windows XP, Gigabyte GA-8N-SLI Royal motherboard with dual onboard LAN - Marvell 8053 chip / Marvell 88E1111 phy) won't connect. </s>
<s> The best I can get with autodetect is &quot;the network did not assign a network address.&quot; Repair doesn't work. </s>
<s> Manually entering the old computer's IP/DNS settings doesn't work, pinging the server doesn't work. </s>
<s> So - what do I do? </s>
<s> Is it a problem with the ISP refusing to recognize this new device (if so, how does it know that, anyway?) </s>
<s> Do I need to get them to change *their* settings to allow this new comp. </s>
<s> to connect? </s>
<s> Or is the LAN broken? </s>
<s> Still scratching my head... </s>
<s> Where's the router or such? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Turn of the modem and WAIT for 30 minutes or More to release the MAC address Lease.. OR you can call your ISP everytime you change your Computer (Network adaptor) </s>
