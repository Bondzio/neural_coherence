<s> My college does not provide cable to student dorms and my dorm room faces north so (along with not being willing to pay a monthly fee) I can not get a Satellite Dish. </s>
<s> My school is in the middle of a corn field (literally) so there is no antenna reception for TV. </s>
<s> I am desperate for television (either just regular channels or that and cable channels). </s>
<s> Are there any products out there that I can install on my computer with a T1 connection that will allow me to watch TV? </s>
<s> I have a Dell Insprion laptop and my school also has an extensive firewall (we have to have our own internal file sharing system since we can't connect to things like Kazaa). </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> only option???? </s>
<s> Just kidding, but I have no real ideas. </s>
<s> But getting all A's may pay off well in the future. </s>
<s> Yes, but in order to get all A's, it is expected that I should have some down time. </s>
<s> I prefer my downtime to be with the TV. </s>
<s> an indoor antenna would possibly pick up a station?? </s>
<s> There are a few that are reasonably good designs and offer some minimal gain. </s>
<s> I would guess that any outside antenna on the roof would establish a precedent and every body would want one. </s>
<s> Need to get the dorm members together to share with the costs for satellite and a good didtribution amplifier. </s>
<s> From the roof in a cornfield the view south should be clear as a bell. </s>
<s> Make a small corp that would carry on every year. </s>
<s> Good luch. </s>
