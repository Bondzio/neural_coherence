<s> I've got a desktop and a notebook that I'm trying to network. </s>
<s> Got the internet sharing working fine, but I'm still having problems with file sharing from the laptop to the desktop (can't even &quot;see&quot; the laptop, but I can ping it). </s>
<s> Currently, I have it setup so both computers use the router as the access point for the internet and for file transfer. </s>
<s> Would it be &quot;better&quot; to set up an ad-hoc network with the laptop connecting to the desktop and using the desktop to share its internet connection? </s>
<s> In my n00bie mind, I tend to think that this setup would have better results as far as success with file sharing. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Filesharing can be problematic for those that installed a firewall before they got the filesharing working. </s>
<s> ADHOC will not work any differently. </s>
