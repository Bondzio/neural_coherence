<s> If I can, I bet anyone can. </s>
<s> Just buy an external drive case from a PC store. </s>
<s> The are cheap and not cheap depending on what you want to spend. </s>
<s> If you use firewire on on your pc you may want to get one with that it is suppose to be faster. </s>
<s> However I use a usb external case and it works fine. </s>
<s> If you look around you will probably get a full kit with a hard drive for the price of a hard drive alone. </s>
<s> There are great benifits to having one of these kicking around. </s>
<s> Just one more thing to note. </s>
<s> Cooling is also a factor. </s>
<s> Some of the more expensive cases will have better cooling features. </s>
<s> So think about how long you will want to run one. </s>
<s> They can get quite warm. </s>
<s> I put a fan beside mine when I use them. </s>
<s> Can't hurt. </s>
