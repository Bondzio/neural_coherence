<s> I just have a simple question. </s>
<s> Do you have to use DDR3200 with a XP 3200+, because I have seen on many sites that it is a requirement, also MSI told me that i needed it. </s>
<s> HELP </s>
<s> will simply run at a lower clock speed. </s>
<s> {within reason]. </s>
<s> Simply check the manual for the mobo to see what the lowest FSB that it will support is. </s>
<s> It boils down to a good matching of componets. </s>
<s> When you get a high end cpu, expect to have high end ram in order to take advantage of the abilities present, otherwise it may just default to what works, which usually is lower results. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> You probably aren't going to see any difference between PC2700 and PC3200 outside of a benchtest. </s>
<s> That's if you already have DDR memory of some sort. </s>
<s> If not, buy 3200. chuck </s>
<s> mobo's/chipsets that allow the FSB and the memory bus run asynchronously. </s>
<s> The system processing is slower [maybe not noticeably] becase when the &quot;next&quot; clock arrives for the FS bus, the data is not avauble until the next clock of the memory bus. </s>
<s> The Northbridge compensates by introducing &quot;wait&quot; states. </s>
<s> These are states where the memory process has to wait for a clock time very frequently, resulting in slower speed overall.. </s>
