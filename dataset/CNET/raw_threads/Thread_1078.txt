When I hook up the power plug(the plug that has the 4 connections that plugs in the hard drive I can turn it on and the hard drive will spin. When I hook up the ribbon cable that goes into the Hard Drive, the Hard Drive doesn't spin. The power light is still on, but it will not work. I've tried three different hard drive, but the same thing. I'm using Windows XP, and all of my disk are set for Master. Also, when I look in my Computer, it is not listed. When I look in Disk Manager, it doesn't show up. Can you think of any reason the disk will not spin? Thanks for any help.

(1) EIDE cables have an orientation &quot;notch&quot; that precludes you plugging the EIDE cable upside down. Some are embossed on the header. (2) Try the above, with power, but do not connect the USB cable. Does the drive spin? If not, the adapter circuit board was more than likely shorted. You did not say if power was on while plugging the EIDE cable to the controller board. That will short out the controller. (3) If the drive is spinning, then plug in the USB cable. (4) Check Device Manager? Any Yellow flags on the USB controllers? If not, OK. If so, delete only the affected item. Re-boot. Go to 3. (5) Are you using a USB hub? If so, use any USB port on the back. Not the front. Have seen some HP's with faulty front USB grounds.

I didn't realize how many people was having this same problem until it happened to me. I've been going all over the net to solve it. I believe that it has to be in the unit itself. I've used these before, and never had no problems. Thanks again for your reply.
