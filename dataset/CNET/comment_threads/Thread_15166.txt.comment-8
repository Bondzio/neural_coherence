For the time being I'll use GHOST 2003 for my image backups/restores and will continue testing True Image 9.0 and NovaBackup 7.3 (as soon as it arrives).
I tried Norton GoBack a long time ago and it too did something at STARTUP that conflicted with other utilities I used so I stopped using it.
Having used NovaStor/NovaBackup before GHOST...I'm hopeful their new product will give the backup and restore capabilities I'm looking for.
I definitely don't want to have to install Windows and a backup program to effect a full restore.
That's what Norton GHOST has done so well for me and the handful of freinds and relatives I help for these many years.
