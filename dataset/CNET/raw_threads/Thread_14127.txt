This is important for me, because I do a good bit of video transcoding which appears to benefit greatly from these applications that can take advantage of the GPU.

The numbers they talk about seem to indicate pretty sizable performance gains in going with one of the new GTX cards over a 9800GTX, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any real-world data to add from experience. Here is the story referencing it: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3339
