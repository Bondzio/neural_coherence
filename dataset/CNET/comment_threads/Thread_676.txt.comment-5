Use Acronis - Home Backup - Scheduled Daily to backup personal stuff (incremental) to a local 2nd drive.
- Every week or two I do a full Image Backup, using same software Acronis.
Very easy to use.
Never done a restore, but there is a restore dvd that I created and should work fine :-/ Restoring a file from backups is just toooo easy.
Just dive into the backup file, and browse round to the dated version that you want.
