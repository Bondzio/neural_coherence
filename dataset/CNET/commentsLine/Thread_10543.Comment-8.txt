i will count them when i install the drive.
i will report back once i have decided on this install.
i do very graphic intensive work and may need to make my new drive the master, which would change everything.
mainly that is what i am trying to really find out: if i make my new drive the slave, then install adobe illustrator to it; will all files for illustrator install to the slave, even the sys files?
this is important; that my cgi work and apps, stay on one drive, the new drive.
