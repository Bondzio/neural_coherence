<s> I have an older WD external HD called a Series 2 USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Recently when i plug the drive into the power source the green LED in the front blinks constantly. </s>
<s> My computer doesn't even recognize the drive. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there was anyone with a similar problem and got it fixed or the drive is totally busted and i just lost everything that is on it. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/hard-drives/western-digital-series-ii/4505-3186_7-30590723.html?tag=viddet gives a good idea this is just a case and drive so you can avail yourself of all the replies in the forums about removing the drive to a desktop for possible trial recovery with the usual titles like you read in these forums (GETDATABACK, ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY). </s>
