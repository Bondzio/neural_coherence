HS Fan.....the high ambient temp is even more reason to opt for a good CPU HS Fan like the ones reviewed over at Frostytech.com.
I've used a number of them and I really like the ones from Xigmatek.
Decent price....good thermal performance.
Might be good to list the exact system components to see if there are other possibilities.
