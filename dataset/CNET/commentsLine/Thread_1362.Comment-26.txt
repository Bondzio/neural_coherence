good point!
i also always put the soft brush extension on the end of my vacuum hose just in case i get too close.
i try to get within a 1/4 inch or so of the components, but you have to be very careful.
by using the soft brush extension it prevents the hard edge of the vacuum hose from ever contacting any of the components if accidentally i get too close.
