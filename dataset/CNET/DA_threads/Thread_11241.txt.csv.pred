1.1.1	I am using a Creative Blaster 56K V.92 PCI & quot ; soft & quot ; Modem .	St
1.1.2	It has been working fine but now shortly after it dials out , it will reboot the computer .	St
1.1.3	Also , the modem isnt always showing up in the device manager .	St
1.2.1	If you have already addressed any problem related to weak power supplies , drivers or system pests , I would check to see if the modem has a feature to allow it to reset the PC from a remote location and disable that feature .	St
1.2.2	If so , turn it of .	St
1.2.3	It is also possible that the reset , if XP is your OS , has detected a fatal error .	St
1.2.4	By design , it can reset your system rather than hang it .	St
1.2.5	If this is the case , we may still be looking at a hardware issue .	St
1.2.6	Good luck .	Polite
