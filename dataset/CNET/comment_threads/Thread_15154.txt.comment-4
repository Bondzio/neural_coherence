Hi, I asked the dealer whether My MTS datacard( http://mtsindia.in/Karnataka/netonthego.html ) is compatible they said that since I'm using a 2g dongle (3.1Mbps) they said that it s better if I have a 3G dongle as the Asus 3G( http://in.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/WL330N3G/ ) router is designed to give better performance for 3g dongles only,now I do not understand what they r saying is it so that if I use dongles other than 3G the net speed would be a bit less than if i directly connect my mts dongle to my PC,could you please help.
