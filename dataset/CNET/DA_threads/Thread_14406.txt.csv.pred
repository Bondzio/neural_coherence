1.1.1	Hi , Tech stuff out of the way : I am on a cable modem .	St
1.1.2	My desktop computer ( PC - windows xp ) is not wireless .	St
1.1.3	I just bought a laptop ( Mac - OSX/leopard ) , so I bought the netgear WPN824 v3 router so that I could make it wireless .	St
1.1.4	and it is !	St
1.1.5	I installed it correctly , it works and gets ok speed on the wireless laptop .	St
1.1.6	One big issue though : Whenever I try to send someone a file over trillian or skype , it works OK .	St
1.1.7	However , when someone tries to send me files , it never sends .	St
1.1.8	Skype sends but it says that it 's using some redirection thing , so it goes at like 100 bytes/second .	St
1.1.9	This has never happened before I got the router .	St
1.1.10	I called netgear and they were absolutely NO help at all .	St
1.1.11	I turned off the netgear firewall and tried to port forward things but that did n't seem to help ?	Ques
1.1.12	Does anyone have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.13	I have clients sending me files and I ca n't force them to have to email me everything all the time !	St
1.1.14	That 's ridiculous !	St
1.1.15	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	http : //kbserver.netgear.com/products/WPN824v3.asp shows there is no firmware upgrade so try the usual settings we have in our forum sticky .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	yes , I have already set it up like it says in the sticky	St
1.4.1	All the routers work for me when I follow our forum note or else they have a defect .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	so it does n't have anything to do with port forwarding ?	Ques
1.5.2	should i not have to forward the ports at all if i turn off the firewall and stuff ?	Ques
1.5.3	and ... should I buy another netgear router or is there a better router out there ?	Ques
1.5.4	thank you for your suggestion	Polite
1.6.1	But those apps work fine here without port forwarding .	St
1.6.2	I use our forum sticky ( you could tell me your setup if you want me to verify it ) without any forwarded ports just dandy on many wifi routers .	St
1.6.3	This is why I must call it DOA .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	sorry lol .	Polite
1.7.2	I have kind of fixed the issue..but not totally : I had 3 friends send me files , but only 1/3 could actually get the file to go through over AIM ( trillian ) .	St
1.7.3	the one who could send me the file is on a mac , the other two on PCs .	St
1.7.4	does this change anything or do you still suggest swapping it ?	Ques
1.8.1	But remember that port forwarding is NOT in the forum sticky as a suggested setup .	St
1.8.2	Yes there are valid reasons to forward ports but for me I do n't need it and it works fine across dozens of routers .	St
1.8.3	Your PC could be the issue but I 'm unconvinced your router is setup exactly per our forum sticky so that 's still a possible issue .	St
1.8.4	I ca n't count how many times we see the member come back with hidded SSIDs , WEP and MAC filtering .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
