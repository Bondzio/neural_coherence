1.1.1	I am considering of upgrading my sound card from an on board Realtek 7.1 HD Audio to the Creative Audigy SE .	St
1.1.2	I know there is no argument that a dedicated SC is better than a basic on board however with the set up I have , will there be a noticeable difference on games , music and movies if I upgraded to the Audigy SE ?	Ques
1.1.3	& lt ; br & gt ; My current system specs are : & lt ; br & gt ; Win Vista , Intel Q6600 processor , 4 gb ram , nVidia 8800 GTS Logitech Z-5300e 5.1 speaker system .	St
1.1.4	Any input would be much appreciated .	St
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	you 'll get higher eax support and slightly better framerates with the audigy se , and probably better signal-to-noise ratio .	St
1.2.2	i know there was a very noticeable difference in audio quality between intel hd audio and my audigy 4 .	St
