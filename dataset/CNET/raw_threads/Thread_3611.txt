I am wanting to manage them threw network mapping software. I am having trouble finding a freely available one. I have looked at download.com and freewarefiles.com. I am also new to networking so some of the terms I am not 100% familiar with. Any ideas of what I can use?

Your choice here but your last post ended with a flip to the manual to show where the setting was. How is this software going to help if they won't use the manuals?

The link was a search of Google which I already have done. I did like network magic but it's not all free and I still have trouble connecting to me second router threw it or Vista (Vista doesn't even see it.)

They are two different posts. I got that fixed over a day ago. I turned the wifi off on my T-mobile router and now I can't configure it. I do not want to have 2 wireless going. I have my D-link working just fine just can't see the Linksys.

Those are not the IP address for the secound router. Changeing the IP info for this system has nothing to do with my DHCP routers other then the default gateway, but I am talking about the router that's connected to the default gateway.

Changeing the IP info for this system has nothing to do with my DHCP routers other then the default gateway, but I am talking about the router that's connected to the default gateway.&quot; In post 17 I note how to setup dual routers. Your choice here but once you assign the IP you label the router so you know. Good luck, Bob

I already have both routers setup. I have the first one as 192.168.1.2 and secound as default IP. The modem is 192.168.0.1. The 1.2 is the one broadcasting the signal that I canect threw. How do I connect to the other modem?

You could have used my post 17 as a primer on how to setup a dual router system. It appears you are not going to do this or connect a machine to the second router to find and configure it. At this point it appears you need on site support, classes and maybe more. I am not your tech support but can point to links and guides on how to get it done. Since you don't want to apply yourself and get this done I am electing to unsubscribe from this discussion. Feel free to vent about that but look at your posts. The signs you need direct support are all there. The signs you do not want to work at this are all here. I wish you the best of luck, Bob

9690	19	305800	2842115	2842111	R. Proffitt	8/25/08 10:30 AM	1.2196602E12	Then why didn't you?	Look at the DHCP table to get what IP addresses were handed out and enable the management from the WAN on the second router? Hint? The IP address is there and you must configure the router before this will work. It appears you want tech support and not a guide or discussion. Bob

9690	22	305800	2842171	2842147	chris_sundown13	8/25/08 11:15 AM	1.2196629E12	Wrong forum.	I know how to use my D-link trouter which is what the link was for. How has that to do with my T mobile one?
9690	23	305800	2842175	2842171	R. Proffitt	8/25/08 11:21 AM	1.21966326E12	Right.	Since simple answers do not work for you such as looking at your Dlink's router table and enabling the other router's remote management, it's time for me to call this discussion closed. -&gt; I'm going to be blunt here. You need tech support on your location and sitting with you. Be sure to tell them you need someone that has taught networking as well. Bob
