I went thru that pain in the neck.. NERO is an advanced product..I started w/ROXIO Software.. ..
I would/in my experiance..recommned that you purchase a Full Version..don't even use some FREEbie that came packed in the Drive Box.. ..
I use the NERO Brand these days and its in need of good PC Hardware.. ROXIO is a nice beginner's software..
They really go for like....$$70.00 to $$100.00/no big deal considering the headaches of BOXED software.
