1.1.1	My drive will only read and write a few 250 Zip disk and refuses to read others.	St
1.1.2	It just freezes up and the light stays on as though it is operating.	St
1.1.3	Those it will not recongize it will not format either.	St
1.1.4	Lets say that I have 7 zip disks.	St
1.1.5	Four will be read and writable.	St
1.1.6	Three have files and Folders on them but are not at least readable.	St
1.1.7	Nor can I format them.	St
1.1.8	This does not make any difference whether they are 250 or 100 size disks.	St
1.1.9	I also have a paralel 250 drive that stopped reading 250 zips and will only read the 100's.	St
1.1.10	Anyone have any suggestions.	St
1.1.11	I am mainly interested in the USB drive.	St
1.1.12	Thank you	St
1.2.1	But they only use them for those that are willing to move to CDRW media and surrender the old disks.	St
1.2.2	It's a strange thing but the IT gestapo has to kill it off somehow.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	ZIP drives aren't that good once they get into old age.	St
1.3.2	If you have used older zip disks and found them to be failing, they've reached the end of the line.	St
1.3.3	Further, a bad ZIP disk can effect other good disks as the wear&tear on the drive itself could be at at fault -OR- become faulty due to bad disks.	St
1.3.4	Once, you experience a bad disk, save whatever data and try to another one, swap data.	St
1.3.5	Overall, I don't recommend ZIp drives unless you got to have them.	St
1.3.6	They have fallen out of favor with users due to this.	St
1.3.7	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	Thank you Bob and Willy.	St
1.4.2	My Zip drives are now going to the junk pile.	St
1.4.3	Only thing that I don't like is, the files on the disks, I can not retrieve unless i send them to Iomega and for a price they will get the files off.	St
1.4.4	This i don't intend to do, as they got enough of my money.	St
1.4.5	Also they are of no help with the problem.	St
1.4.6	Thanks for your replies, larry	St
