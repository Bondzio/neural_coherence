<s> my system (purchased fall 2001) Gateway SELECT 1400CS 1.40GHz AMD Athlon 133MHz external bus 768 MB of RAM (will upgrade to 1024; specs say supports 1GB, but BIOS utility says 1536MB) 20 GB of Harddrive space (want to add 2nd 160GB Seagate Internal Hard Drive. </s>

<s> i want to add a 2nd internal HD (160GB), but the weekend project said &quot;...If your motherboard's BIOS is more than a few years old, it might not recognize the full capacity of a huge modern drive...&quot; it said to google the BIOS version for specs and/or updates to see if it could handle the amount of HD space i wanted. </s>
<s> couldn't find the specs though. </s>
<s> so in order to avoid problems i tried to update my BIOS anyway. </s>
<s> 1st thru American Megatrends, Inc. website which after all the BS directed me to esupport.com which seems like a scam to pay for the update. </s>
<s> then i went to gateway and found the update for my BIOS version (AMD Athlon BIOS update 0AAWV P09) now... went thru the steps and put BIOS update file on a floppy and restarted the PC to update the BIOS just to get a non bootable disk, strike any key error. </s>
<s> possible problems...had trouble with floppy drive (Panasonic 1.44-MB Floppy Disk Drive Revision 5) before where with any disk (new, old, formatted, unformatted, etc) inserted a message would pop up saying disk needed to be formatted...format now? </s>
<s> and would sometimes make loud noise when reading a disk. </s>
<s> but i disabled, uninstalled, reinstalled, and enabled thru device manager and now it reads floppy disks. </s>
<s> questions i have: is it possible my BIOS has already been updated thru a windows xp patch/hotfix/update? </s>
<s> or can it only be done with a boot floppy disk procedure? </s>
<s> where would i find the specs of want my BIOS can handle? </s>
<s> can i add RAM based on the 1024 MB max specs of my AMD (Keystone) Motherboard - 1.4-GHz? </s>
<s> or can i go by the BIOS max of 1536MB? </s>
<s> i get contradicting info on banks and slots (3 banks of 1 slot or 2 banks of 1 slot) but i will open up the PC today and look. </s>
<s> do i need to do the BIOS update for my BIOS version to recognize my soon to be new hard drive total capacity? </s>
<s> what if i want to keep my old drive as my master drive with the xp OS (so i dont have to install xp on the new drive) and use the new hard drive just for backup/storage? </s>
<s> i dont need to install xp on the new drive if i'm just using it as storage, right? </s>
<s> apologies for all the info and questions. </s>
<s> just wanted get all that was on my brain. </s>
<s> thanx in advance </s>
<s> First the machine is new enough I wouldn't check the old disk size limit issue. </s>
<s> But the 20GB is getting to the age I'd begin to not want it to be my primary boot drive. </s>
<s> Your new 160GB drive will come with drive copy software so you can move onto that new drive. </s>
<s> Not only that but they'll have instructions to do that. </s>
<s> This is safe too since we don't touch the 20GB but set it aside when we boot from the copy on the new 160GB drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so i should be able to make an image of the old drive onto the new drive with given software? </s>
<s> then i can clear the old 20GB drive and use that for storage? </s>
<s> about the RAM max, should i go by gateway specs or the BIOS? </s>
<s> Did you ask me to repeat my first answer? </s>
<s> As to the RAM, you can check crucial.com as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am having somewhat of the same problem, only am using 512 of Ram but wanted to upgrade my 40GB hard drive (as it is failing) with a new 250GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I have basically the same computer, Gateway Select 1400CS with the 1.4 GHz AMD. </s>
<s> My computer will only show 127 GB of the new 250GB hard drive. </s>
<s> Wanted to update my BIOS but the only updated I could find was the one on Gateway, I can't find the current BIOS driver I am using or the motherboard exact model. </s>
<s> Which limits me on finding a BIOS driver update. </s>
<s> My floppy has never gone bad and am using new pre-formatted IBM floppy disk, at start-up comp will not read BIOS update from the booted floppy. </s>
<s> Returns with the same thing you stated...&quot;Non-system disk or disk error Replace and strike any key&quot; You ever have any luck booting the new BIOS version or finding a better download to update BIOS. </s>
<s> Let me know, thanks. </s>
<s> The disk size problem noted at http://www.48bitlba.com went away. </s>
<s> If this was mine I'd update my BIOS if I found any item they noted worthy. </s>
<s> 'My floppy has never gone bad and am using new pre-formatted IBM floppy disk, at start-up comp will not read BIOS update from the booted floppy. </s>
<s> Returns with the same thing you stated...&quot;Non-system disk or disk error Replace and strike any key&quot;' I find that many have forgotten how to make a dos boot diskette. </s>
<s> Tell me how you made this diskette so I can check your work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> followed instructions that came as readme file to BIOS driver, which stated to unzip a driver file to the hard drive then copy all files in stated folder to a new floppy disk. </s>
<s> That's all I did, then booted of the disk. </s>
<s> Thanks for the 48bit website will have to read more of it. </s>
<s> &quot;which stated to unzip a driver file to the hard drive then copy all files in stated folder to a new floppy disk.&quot; The new floppy disk would be a DOS boot diskette. </s>
<s> No one bothers to tell you today about such since it's been 2 decades that this has been the way of things. </s>
<s> I think you found the problem. </s>
<s> You followed the directions... Bob </s>
<s> Well thank you Bob for that info, you know I really appreciate the reply. </s>
<s> I surely wasn't looking for help, what I really wanted was a snide remark. </s>
<s> Oh sure, I will now look up on the internet how to make a DOS boot disk and figure out how to flash my BIOS. </s>
<s> So you certainly solved the problem. </s>
<s> But maybe next time when you ask to &quot;check&quot; someone's work you will come back with a more informative response. </s>
<s> Such as, please look at this website, or simply state how you would make the disk. </s>
<s> But I sure do appreciate being treated like an idiot. </s>
<s> You did just fine. </s>
<s> My snide comment is that today you will find many of these instructions to assume that you would know that &quot;you also need to do this.&quot; If that isn't good enough for you consider this. </s>
<s> I will never rewrite a post if it gets the job done. </s>
<s> That is, this is all volunteer and if it will take me more than 30 seconds to rewrite it to avoid bruising someone's psyche I won't. </s>
<s> Let's get it done. </s>
<s> Ok? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
