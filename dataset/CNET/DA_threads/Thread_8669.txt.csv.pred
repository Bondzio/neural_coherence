1.1.1	Hi all , I 'm having problems accessing my network attached storage drive ( a Western Digital MyBook World Edition ) from my computer .	St
1.1.2	I can not access any of the content beyond the first couple of layers of the folder tree , and am unable to play any of the media stored on there on my PC .	St
1.1.3	I 'm totally stumped as to why , so I 'm hoping some of you might have some ideas that can help me out !	St
1.1.4	Here are the symptoms of the problem : * This problem has only arisen since moving into a new home , and joining a new wireless network .	St
1.1.5	* My computer can not access the files on the drive , but others on the network can .	St
1.1.6	* The drive can be successfully pinged from cmd.exe by both IP address , and machine name .	St
1.1.7	* The drive can share music via an iTunes share .	St
1.1.8	It 's share name can be seen in iTunes on my PC , but the drive 's tracks do not load when the share is selected * The drive can be seen on the network in Windows Explorer under the & quot ; Network & quot ; heading * When browsing the drive through Windows 7 explorer the folders which contain a large number of files or folders can not be accessed - it just takes a long time trying to load it , and then comes up with the following error message : & quot ; \\DRIVENAME\Public\Shared Videos\TV is not accessible .	St
1.1.9	You might not have permission to use this network resource .	St
1.1.10	Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions The specified network name is no longer available & quot ; or & quot ; error 0x80070035 , The Network Path Was Not Found & quot ; * The drive is not found by the WD discovery tool that comes with it ( software that finds networked drives ) .	St
1.1.11	* Entering the drive 's IP address in a browser does not take you to the configuration pages for the drive ( nothing at all loads ) .	St
1.1.12	* I have tried switching off the firewall * I have tried installing and using the latest version of the WD discovery tool * Resetting the MyBook drive , the wireless router , and the PC does not resolve the issue some notes on hardware etc : * the drive is a WD MyBook World edition 1Tb drive - White light ( latest iteration ) * the drive is connected to the router by a wired ethernet connection * the router is an O2 wireless box I ( which is a Thompson SpeedTouch 780WL ) * The PC is a custom desktop computer running Windows 7 Home Premium , and is connected to the network wirelessly * Firmware for the drive and router , and drivers for the wireless adapter on the PC are all up to date * there are no problems with internet connectivity from this PC ( also handled by the O2 wireless box )	St
1.2.1	your windows 7 pc do you logon with a user name and password ?	Ques
1.2.2	If not , try it .	St
1.3.1	Yep , logging on is already done with a username and password .	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the reply BTW .	St
1.3.3	I am totally stumped by this one ; it 's bizarre that my PC can see , and navigate the first couple of layers of the drive , but fails to access any further than that .	St
1.3.4	I do not personally believe its a problem with access permission , but am open to *ALL* suggestions !	St
