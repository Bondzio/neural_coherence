<s> Logic says there is something wrong with that adapter. </s>
<s> Try your friends again just to confirm. </s>
<s> If that adapter works and yours still does not, perhaps you can exchange it for another one. </s>
<s> Here's where a DVM would come in real handy though. </s>
<s> Isnt that an adapter for the power? </s>
<s> So its obviously not getting power. </s>
<s> Make sure the 4 pin molex is plugged all the way and that the wholes are lined up. </s>
<s> And that the sata end is plugged in all the way too. </s>
<s> Or just try another adapter </s>
