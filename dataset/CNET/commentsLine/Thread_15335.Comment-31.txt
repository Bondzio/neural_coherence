you are really just venting without a solution!
&gt;&gt;every buyer should be able to have a 'puter designed and setup after his/her own desires, w/o having to fight the crap already exists!
thousands of computer shops will do that for you or you could &quot;roll your own&quot;, including laptops.
some are even able to deliver customized business dells or hps anyway you like it.
just don't expect the oems to sell consumer pcs w/o crap to you, either directly or thru their channel partners, at a lower price than those alternatives.
with your smarts, i take it you have already priced the alternatives.
&gt;&gt;mike dell is greedy, consumers know it and don't like it --- ergo his problems today with his company.
no, that's not why he's having problems.
if that was it, hp would be suffering likewise but it's not.
dell may be the poster child in this regard for what's frustrating about capitalism, but consumers are a small fraction of his business and our whining have little effect.
it's the loss of business customers (who already don't get crapware) that are his headaches.
it's the loss of competitive supply chain advantages that are his headaches.
it's the bloating cost infrastructure of his company that are his headaches.
it's the lack of good ideas for new higher margin products that are his headaches.
it's the... you get the gist.
speaking of capitalism, how much less capitalistic are you by wanting a lower price puter so that the cash can go towards the next suv or big screen tv or stainless steel refrigerator with lcd panel?
