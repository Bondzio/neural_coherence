i am using a router with wpa2-psk.
i want to connect manually to the network with my xp netbook; i.e.
i don't want windows to store the key, i want to type it in each time i connect.
it is probably a simple thing, but i can't figure it out in xp (in vista i just uncheck a box...).
i am using windows xp home.
thanks!
