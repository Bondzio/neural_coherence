<s> I have had a problem with my NEC3500 DVD writer for the past week. </s>
<s> Occasonally it will open when the computer has been off for a while but after 15-20 minutes it becomes unresponsive. </s>
<s> I was wondering what would cause this problem? </s>
<s> maybe the drive is going bad? </s>
<s> also if/when it locks a disk inside the little hole on the front, about the width of a pen tip you put a paper clip into that and it will manually eject the drive thus releasing it's circular hostage (if you don't quite get what i'm talking about...plz ask b4 trying) </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Heat. </s>
<s> Many stack such drives in some hot and stuffy case. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Pull the cover off of the case. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Software. </s>
<s> Uninstall InCD, Roxio's DirectCD or other such and see if that cures it. </s>
<s> A known issue. </s>
