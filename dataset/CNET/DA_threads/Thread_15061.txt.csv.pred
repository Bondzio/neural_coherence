1.1.2	Specs : ATI 4870hd Intel e6750 2.66Ghz 4mb cashe G.Skill 8g 's ram western digital hd 's asus p5k-se 600w powersupply I have about 250 dollars to spend right now and I was really looking to upgrade my e6750 because it might be bottlenecking my graphics card .	St
1.1.3	What im having problems with is what to do with that money .	St
1.1.4	From what I know most games dont have quad-core support but with technology idk how long that will last .	St
1.1.5	So my question is what should I do with that money ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	Stick with a good dual core like a e8500 or go to a quad core .	St
1.1.7	( Im going to have to stick to my LGA 775 socket )	St
1.2.1	one ) .	St
1.2.2	That way you would have a high performance peripheral to carry forward to a new system when the time arises ... there 's not much gain or future in getting another socket 775 .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	If that was the case what should I get for a graphics card then .	St

1.5.1	Ati just has never been good for me in general its more of a preference to use nvidea .	St

1.6.2	Another thought .	St
1.6.3	.	St
1.6.4	.	St
1.6.5	skip the L775 CPU and use the $ $ for a socket 1366 or 1156 MB which gives you a platform for more CPU power and the option to use Crossfire or SLi plus USB 3.0 and SATA 3 .	St
1.6.6	VAPCMD	St
