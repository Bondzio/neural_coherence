I think I may already know the answer but.... Can you have 2 different graphic cards on the same system?
I know you can't run them (different cards) in SLI, but could you I have two installed but only 1 &quot;abled&quot; and the other &quot; disabled &quot; in device manager.
The reason I ask is that I have a free graphics card that I won.
It is an ATI ALL-IN-Wonder that I want to use to transfer video to DVDs.
It is a PCI-E x16 (256mb)and says it will be good for games also.
I was wondering if I could have another nVidia card just for gaming ?
Then 'switch' between the two ?
