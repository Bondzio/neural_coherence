It shows up in &quot;Device Manager&quot; but not in &quot;My Computer&quot; or &quot;Disk Management&quot; which means i can't partition it or anything. I've tried using the installation CD, but that didnt do anythin. I tried a program Discwizard but that kept telling me to reboot over and over. If you could help me, It'd be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Try Disk Management one more time and INITIALIZE it: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000588.htm If that doesn't work, I'd install the hard drive as a secondary drive in my desktop. Then, try initializing it in Disk Management again. If that fails, try SeaTools from Seagate.com.

When you do your START-UP..do not connect the HDD/ Just start the LAPTOP..let it reach its Desktop/ RUN DSKCLEANUP..and Defragmentor../ .. Now Plug the USB in.. .. If that doesn't work..I would check my PIN-assignments.. be sure the HDD is useing CABLE-Select[CS].. which means you need to OPEN the External Enclosure.. and view the rear of the DRIVE for the PIN-assignments.. .. You may want to visit the SEAGATE website..... and read some INFO on your Drive.
