<s> Hi, I have a netgear wireless router wpn824 and wa swroking fine till I used it with dynamic IP address with the DSL connection but now when I came on a business trip and am living in a hotel, I have been provided with static IP and DNS servers settings. </s>
<s> If I use the laptop without the router, there is no issue except that I have to sit on the chair everytime I have to do anything. </s>
<s> I tried setting up the router but to see no luck at all.I provided the ststic IP and DNS server info into the router configuration but to see nothing happening, i upgraded network card and router firmware also, I am using 3945 PRO wireless INtel Card.PLease help as it is become very crucial for me to set it up.I can not sit for hours on a chair just to do busines work.Let me knwo if I need to provide any more infomartion. </s>
<s> Static Ip: 192.168.1.8 DNS 202.54.7.96 alt. </s>
<s> 202.9.6.54 </s>
<s> Hello, Since the 192.168 IP scheme is non routable I don't know if this will work but its worth a shot. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Connect your router's internet port to the hotel's network. </s>
<s> Verify the internet port light showing a physical connection. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Connect to your router (LAN side) and login. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Set the Internet port to static and enter the info as given by the hotel (Verify that it is a class C subnet) 4. </s>
<s> Modify the LAN side of the router to a DIFFERENT subnet; ex: Hotel IP 192.168.1.18 class C router LAN IP range 192.168.2.1 class C 5. </s>
<s> Save this configuration and test. </s>
<s> Let me know if this works </s>
<s> I just thought of an easier way to do this. </s>
<s> You must have the following information 1. </s>
<s> Static IP address (ex: 192.168.1.18) 2. </s>
<s> Subnet mask (ex: 255.255.255.0) 3. </s>
<s> DNS settings (you have them) 4. </s>
<s> Gateway address (ex: 192.168.1.1) Connect your wireless router to the Hotel's network using one of the 4 LAN ports. </s>
<s> Input the above information into the wireless card's IP configuration. </s>
<s> Connect to the wireless network and you should be on. </s>
<s> Let me know if this works. </s>
<s> Apparently this hotel doesn't have wireless available, though in my travels around the US I find wireless is the standard rather than the exception. </s>
<s> Regardless, a very low tech, simple solution I use when confronted with this situation is a 25ft extension cable with an inline coupling. </s>
<s> Both can be purchased at Walmart for around 20 bucks. </s>
<s> 25 ft. cable will reach anywhere in the room and even allow you to sit outside and get some fresh air while computing. </s>
<s> It isn't elegant, but it is guaranteed to work 100% of the time. </s>
<s> Of course I don't have the option of taking my wireless router either. </s>
<s> Thanks for your quick response..yes it did work. </s>
<s> I just had to change the LAN IP of the router to a class differnet than what HOtel LAN is using and now..I'm able to use internet wirelessly..thanks CNET and thanks to you. </s>
