c. checked the firewall exceptions list on both units saw no reference to ms networking would it be listed as something else?
i can't be more specific without knowing which firewall you are using.
d. tried to track down where one changes usb settings did not find anything where do i find this?
try this -&gt;  just so you know, some just give up and try out a really nice piece of software called network magic.
it does this all for us without having to know it all.
