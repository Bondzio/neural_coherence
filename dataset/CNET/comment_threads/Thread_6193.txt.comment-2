That over wifi some forget that if we have a wifi &quot;file server&quot; and a wifi &quot;player or client&quot; that the wifi speed drops to half or quarter speed as the info is sent from the server to the router and then again from the router to the player or client.
This is often forgotten by today's users.
Easy to fix by getting all parts wired.
