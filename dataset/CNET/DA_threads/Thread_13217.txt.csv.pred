1.1.1	I recently did a re-install of OS 10.2.8 because I was told I had corruption issues .	St
1.1.2	Since then , I have been unable to burn CD`s , either with Toast or iTunes ; I get a message that the drive is busy or reserved by another application , even though nothing else is running .	St
1.1.3	I just checked Apple System Profiler and the info about the drive ( Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-103 ) states that disc burning is not supported .	St
1.1.4	I`ve had this computer for several years ( G4 AGP with the builtin burner ) and never had trouble burning CDs before .	St
1.1.5	What did I do wrong with the OS re-install and how can I fix it ?	Ques
1.2.1	Difficult to say what went wrong during the re-install .	St
1.2.2	I guess a good question would be to ask what sort of corruption issues you had and who advised you .	St
1.2.3	What sort of re-install did you do ?	Ques
1.2.4	Complete Format and install or a Clean Archive and Install ?	Ques
1.2.5	This drive was not original equipment on this machine which raises the question , did you have a patch installed to enable this burner to function with OS X ?	Ques
1.2.6	Something like PatchBurn from OWC ?	Ques
1.2.7	I remember Apple being very fussy about what burners worked in their systems .	St
1.2.8	P	St
1.3.1	I bought the computer used ; it was my first ( and only ) OS X computer and I never did figure out how to back up the startup disk , so I have no way of knowing what was on it .	St
1.3.2	The corruption issue was that the computer kept forgetting settings for Netscape and other apps , and that I couldn`t start up in OS 9.2 without the computer hanging up during startup .	St
1.3.3	I did a Clean Archive and Install .	St
1.3.4	I still can`t start up in OS 9 but Netscape does seem to remember settings now .	St
1.3.5	I had described my problems on this forum and was told that a reinstall sounded like what I needed .	St
1.3.6	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	that you can not start up in OS 9.2 Even though you have installed OS X 10.2.8 you should still be able to start up in 9.2 These corruption issues , were they in OS 9 or where they in OS X .	St
1.4.2	Are you starting in X and then switching to OS 9 ( Classic ) , a situation you should try to avoid .	St
1.4.3	Once you make the move to X , it is easier on your nerves to attempt to do everything in X rather than go back to 9 from X Which OS are you now having problems with , OS X or OS 9 ( Classic ) ?	Ques
1.4.4	I remember that I suggested that you get a copy of OS X 10.3 .	St
1.4.5	There is a distinct possibility that the system is now so messed up that the best move is to wipe it all out and start again .	St
1.4.6	Let us know about the 9 & X situation .	St
1.4.7	P	St
1.5.1	I`ve no idea what I did ; today the blasted thing is listed under Apple Profiler as fully enabled and burns anything I want .	St
1.5.2	I still can`t start up in OS 9 ; even the Norton disk won`t start up ; it hangs up after the startup screen .	St
1.5.3	I did put in a new Sonnet processor back in September ( Sonnet Encore/ST G4 ) , but on the box it states that the upgrade requires OS X and OS 9.2 and that 9.2 IS supported .	St
1.5.4	I`m getting OS 10.4.2 Monday and will upgrade ; I hope it helps .	St
1.5.5	I still have a ton of legacy software , or I`d give up on OS 9 .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
