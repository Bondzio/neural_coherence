but the area that gamer machines need the most work is the video card.
without reservation i'd get any 2+ghz core 2 duo or higher, 2 or 4gb ram and then pour the rest of the bugdet to get the best video card for the money from this list -&gt;  having more cores does help, but that is not where you find your gaming machine to need the most help.
