It was printing fine earlier but now only prints one page (file://C:\Users\Tom\AppData\Local\Temp\Low\6QTH7PFY.htm) irrespective of the web page I'm trying to print from. I've tried printing to adobe but the page that will be printed will be the above file. I cannot find the folder Low nor 6QTH7PFY - I've set windows to show hidden files and folder. Printing from word is OK. My OS is win 7 ultimate.
