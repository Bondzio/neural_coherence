no, an intel one wouldn't work as the sockets would be different.
heck there are even some amd processors that won't work with your own set up since there are different sockets for different families of cpus which is how the cpu plugs into the motherboard.
i would suggest looking up which socket, am2 or 939 being the most likely, that your computer has and then getting the best for that.
looking up that model it seems you have an am2 socket so you could go to newegg.com or somewhere similar and look for am2 processors.
there is an amd athlon 64 x2 6000+ windsor 3.0ghz for $229.99 if you want one of the top ones.
i'd suggest a dual core since while you may think you aren't multi-tasking, how sure are you that there aren't services running the background taking up resources?
