<s> Right now I have my spare HDD in an enclosure plugged into my laptop, and easiest way to say it is the wheel's spinning but the hamster is dead. </s>
<s> My laptop is picking up the USB connection, but I'm not able to access the drive itself. </s>
<s> I hear a disk spinning but it use to spin up and stop a lot before, now its just steady. </s>
<s> I think this might have been caused by a premature power off. </s>
<s> I was hibernating my laptop for the night, and just hit the power switch on the drive as well. </s>
<s> There shouldn't have been any transmitting activity but I might have missed something. </s>
<s> Checking the other threads it seems like there's little to be done. </s>
<s> I have no access to an actual desktop at the moment, so I can't check if the disk is really dead or its just the enclosure not working. </s>
<s> Honestly I might have to just invest in a server box or something at this rate. </s>
<s> In other words, you hear the default tone? </s>
<s> I'd check in disk manager to see if the drive shows there as unpartitioned space. </s>
<s> If so, that could account for it's disappearance in explorer because it would have no drive letter. </s>
<s> If not, and you have a PC available, you can remove the drive and connect it to a motherboard port to see if it shows there. </s>
<s> If you care to go one step further and know the drive's manufacturer, you can try to download their diagnostic utility to see if it can find and test the drive. </s>
<s> Alright. </s>
<s> I don't have a desktop on me, so where can I find disk manager? </s>
<s> I remember it from somewhere, but its been a while. </s>
<s> If you don't know who the manufacturer is, you need to remove it from the enclosure to look. </s>
<s> It should have the model as well. </s>
<s> You need to go to that manufacturer's web site and look for their diagnostics disk. </s>
<s> It may take some searching. </s>
<s> If you have difficulty and can post the brand and model here, I'm sure someone here can dig up a link for you. </s>
<s> These generally download as an executable that can create a bootable floppy or CD ROM disk. </s>
<s> You boot this disk with the suspect HD attached. </s>
<s> If the utility detects a controller that it can deal with, it will display it. </s>
<s> There should be a variety of testing options available but, since each manufacturer has their own utility, I can't direct you specifically as to what these are. </s>
<s> I know that WD, Seagate, and Hitachi have fairly good utilities but there are some that are limited...I think Toshiba might be one of these. </s>
<s> As well, if your drive is such as an old Maxtor or Quantum, these have been taken over by other manufacturers and some utilities are no longer readily available. </s>
<s> Pull the drive from the enclosure and check its label. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> WD600BB. </s>
<s> Found the downloads on the WD site. </s>
<s> Got a trial version of Partition manager off cnet as well. </s>
<s> It sees the drive, and seems to be able to format it. </s>
<s> Haven't tried since I want to see if I can save this data. </s>
<s> Well the diagnostic can see the drive, and seems to be able to check it properly. </s>
<s> Pass the quick scan. </s>
<s> Running through the extended one right now. </s>
<s> Now looking at this it might just be a vista thing. </s>
<s> Which doesn't help since I have nothing else to work off of. </s>
<s> So I guess this means the drive works, and the enclosure works to some degree. </s>
<s> So I guess what's left is test this on another computer, probably at least with a mobo. </s>
<s> you might experiment with the jumpers. </s>
<s> Since there's only one possible connection, I've seen these get confused if set to master or slave. </s>
<s> Try CS if you've not done so already. </s>
<s> Well I'm under the impression that if the jumper is set to anything not listed under the choices, it defaults to CS. </s>
<s> I think I'll try it without the jumper. </s>
<s> Just plugged the external w/ usb to another laptop, still being detected alright but still no drive. </s>
<s> So it looks like it might be something wrong when I turned it off last time. </s>
<s> I'm guessing formatting it through the Diag would probably be the only solution at this rate as well? </s>
<s> Jumper setting was set at just cable select. </s>
<s> Removing it set it as single. </s>
<s> Which still didn't work, but misinformed right there. </s>
<s> Might as well try the other two. </s>
<s> Okay, after finding out where disk management was (Stupid vista), I probably could've learned that the disk was &quot;Not Initialized.&quot; Might've fixed my problem before I decided to use the WD diag to write zeros to the entire disk. </s>
<s> Course, that is if initializing didn't force you to reformat the drive anyway. </s>
<s> Just my luck. </s>
