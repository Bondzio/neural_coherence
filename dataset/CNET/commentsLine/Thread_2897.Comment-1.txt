i currently am doing audio recording using a compaq ap550 workstation, which has dual p3 processors (1ghz each), 1gb rdram, an nvidia quadro-4 980 8x agp (the mobo only runs 4x), all legacy disabled and my audio is via usb 2.0 (m-audio fasttrack pro).
i also have a creative labs x-fi fidelity sound card.
18gb scsi u160 system disk and ata-100 250gb storage.
lite-on cdrw/dvd rw combo.
i'm running xp sp2.
i want to upgrade the system and am currently reviewing motherboards.
i'd like to keep as much existing hardware as possible, though i will replace the scsi with a sata drive.
the quadro was a worker in its day but i suspect replacing it with as good a pci-ex for the reasonable $ i paid is going to be tough.
i'm considering an asus p5vd1-x, 2gb ddr2 and a pentium d 2.66ghz.
as it supports both agp-8x and pci-ex i could use my quadro until i'm ready to pop for a new gc.
any thoughts on these boards?
they are hard to find new and seem to have been replaced with the p5vd2-x pci-ex only.
same board but no agp it seems.
are there any others i might consider?
