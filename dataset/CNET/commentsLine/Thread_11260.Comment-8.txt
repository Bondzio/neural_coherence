i'm not sure if you've found the answer to this since it's an older post, however the reason you haven't been able to locate these jacks in your recording software or anything is because they are part of your tv tuner, not the sound board.
so i really doubt you would be able to record any kind of audio from them without a coupled video signal.
hope that helped!
good luck!
i have experienced a similar problem with these jacks, however i am trying to hook my ps3 up to my pc using the composite and av jacks that you are talking about on the front.
the problem is that vista has no bundled software to tackle such a task, and therefor you are forced into using 3rd party software(unstable) that hasn't been tested with all hardware.
this basically mean vista developers + hp hardware = dumb.
