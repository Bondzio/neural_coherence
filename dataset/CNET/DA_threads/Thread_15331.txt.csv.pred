1.2.1	A router is stupid it takes packets in and send them out .	St
1.2.2	It really has no concept of what type of device is connecting to is .	St
1.2.3	Your first question is can your phone surf and bring up other web pages .	St
1.2.4	If this does not work then you may need to do some configuration on your router but more than likely you need to configure the phone to match WAP/SSID stuff .	St
1.2.5	Youtube technically does not & quot ; Stream & quot ; anything .	St
1.2.6	It just copies a file using TCP over http .	St
1.2.7	True streaming is how digital video is transmitted by cable or satellite companies .	St
1.2.8	So the router really does not know the difference between a video on youtube and a large web page .	St
1.2.9	Can you get the video to work over the cell network .	St
1.2.10	I would suspect a app issue .	St
1.2.11	Youtube by default runs flash application to process video and flash has all kinds of issues phones ... . and adobe has announced no future support	St
