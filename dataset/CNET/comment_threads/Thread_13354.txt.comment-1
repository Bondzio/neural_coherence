My computer does not start immediately when I pushed the start ON button.
I have to wait about about 20 minutes after the first push ON button then OFF and ON a couple of time again only this time it starts.
The motherboard is Asus P5E3 Premium Wifi, OS is Windows Vista Ultimate, CPU Intel Core Quad Q6600, RAM 6GB and Graphic Card ATI Radeon HD 4800.
Before I had blue screen problems somehow it was solved.
I also updated the bios to fix the problems.
Is my motherboard the root cause of this problem?
Should I replace a new motherboard?
This my first built computer I had couple of times change the CPU heat sink.
