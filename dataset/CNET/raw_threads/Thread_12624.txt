8446	0	206302	2207800	NR	tarunb	9/15/06 8:57 PM	1.15835382E12	wireless not working	I have internet through cable provided by Comcast. Ever since it's installation I am unable to get wireless access to my IBM R51 laptop (windows xp), although LAN works perfectly. I have NETGEAR cable modem gateway CG814WG v2. Whenever I try to connect wireless, it initially shows that it's connected followed by the message &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;. However, the wireless works perfectly in my other DELL notebook. Please help me find a solution.

Be paitent, it may give you another error message but if you wait a minute longer, it might connect. If it does, then type command ipconfig /flushdns then hit enter then close the window. Before you shut down the computer, disable the radio. I found that when the radio is NOT disabled, I got that error message often. Hope this helps. Rick

I don't know what to check in my settings. Is there some way to disable my previous settings and set up the whole thing again?
