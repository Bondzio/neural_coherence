t remember that 10 years ago when my dad as building my family's fisrt computer (windows 95) he bought a maxtor hard drive.
however there was something wrong with it and he returned it back to maxtor.
a few weeks later he recieved his new hard drive from maxtor and everything worked alirite from their after.
moral of the story: dont buy maxtor, out of all the hard drives out their, i'd say maxtor hd have the most problems.
competing hard drive companies like western digital and seagate have much better packaging and are more relible.
my old 8gb seagate still works, and it even came with a anti static rubber covering of some sort.
i have an 80gb western digital hard drive (1.5 years old) and its still running strong.
it also came packaged with some good software for stuff like reformating and soe tools to examen the hard drive, unlike the hitachi (ibm) hard drive my friend bought.
