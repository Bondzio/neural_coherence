First let me say that I am new to Wi-Fi - here is my issue.
I have successfully intalled the driver and card and actually had a secure connection to my network.
however after updating to SP2 for XP I have been unable to gain access to my network.
I have tried the 'Hotfix&quot; issue as well as reinstall the product, manually configure and several frimware updates and have gotten nowhere.
I had not problems on initial install - only after SP2 - any help in getting around this - also will I find this to be the case with all WiFi cards and SP2???
I guess that I should say my issue is that it cannot find IP address - then if I manually configure it will find it but will not allow the connection.
Any hell?
?
