<s> Hi, Can you use a SLI video card in a motherboard with only one pci express slot? </s>
<s> The motherboard is an ASUS A8N-E (NON SLI) And if a motherboard has sli support, can you use only one card instead of the SLI? </s>

<s> how much do you want to spend? </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-8902_7-6213103-1.html?tag=prmo1 A nice page which can help... </s>
<s> I don't know any of Cluchetti's criteria for the video card that is being sought, so I made a very generic recommendation. </s>
<s> Sorry for the dry humor. </s>

<s> but some of the reviews mentioned the fan breaking and also not all the games that are found in the pictures of newegg are included </s>
<s> I really don't mind if doesn't come with anygames. </s>
<s> As long as I can play most games on High Settings, I fine. </s>
<s> If i need to ever relpace the fan, I'll get this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118116 Thank you so far to everyone with the help. </s>
<s> And may I ask one other question also. </s>
<s> Is this a good motherboard? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131530 or would anyone recommend a better or different one? </s>
<s> Thanks... </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127179 also found this one http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814133155 this seems like a better deal with 16 pixelpipeline however info could be wrong </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> although i dont think it can handle max settings for some games in the future due to the 128bit and 8 pixel pipelines versus the vanilla6800's 12 pixel pipelines and 256bit memory interface. </s>
