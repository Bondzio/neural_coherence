many thanks for your input.
i'm sorry but i'm new here, and thought i had covered it all in the first post.
but i got the name wrong - it's a dell dimension 8200 running windows xp home ed with pentium 4 at 2.24 ghz with 200gb hd.
we got it running again, but had to format the drive on another machine, and are a bit worried about it losing dll files again.
we swapped the power supply, and are planning to change the battery.
i still have no idea if a low battery or failing power supply could damage dll files?
neither one appeared to be defective or low, but are changing them anyway.
if you have any other ideas about what could be going on, i'd appreciate them.
