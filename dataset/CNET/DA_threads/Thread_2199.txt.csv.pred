1.1.1	i got an idea for a budget system ... if u get the 300mb or 640 mb and OC will it be as fast as the gtx ?	Ques
1.1.2	OCing my 7900gtx improoved the performance ALOT	St
1.2.1	the lower end had a 500mhz core , 1400mhz mem clock and didnt metion shader clock the high end had 575 mhz core , 1800mhz mem , and 1350 mhz shader clock if they both have a shader clock i believe u could buy an 8800 gts instead of gtx and OC and get the same results.i really dont think that 200 some odd mb memory is gon na make a diffirence .	St
1.3.1	No , not really , this is cuz some hardware specs can not be changed e.g uni .	St
1.3.2	shader , gtx has128 , gts has 96. that aint really poss .	St
1.3.3	to OC , although you do realize there is a limit how far you can actuallt OC .	St
1.3.4	You will get improved performance but i REALLLy dont thing youll match the GTX by just OCing !	St
1.3.5	!	St
