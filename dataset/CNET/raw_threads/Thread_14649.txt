Seems pretty usefull to have it on the network and then anyone can access it from their own PC. But the problem is of access control. What can we do if we do not want everyone to access every folder. Is there any way to do the access control based on users ? Thanks for the help AQ

The machine that &quot;serves&quot; up the files would have to have accounts maintained and then we use NTFS permissions to grant or deny each account access to what we see fit. As there are plenty of web pages on NTFS permissions I must stop at that point. Many go nuts over all the maintenance, the tedius account and if you had XP Home the 5 user limit. That's why businesses usually end up on a server. Bob

All machine are personal systems and they are normally turned off. So if it requires a PC which can be used to set the user profiles, and it can be turned on and off then it should be ok. But if it requires a PC which should be always on then we would have a problem. Can you help me clarify this doubt. Thanks,

So I searched for the manuals of Western Digital. Finally I bought the western digital book world which offers me the needed functionality. Thanks all for the time.
