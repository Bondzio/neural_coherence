yes there is a life expectancy on external hard drives.
if you ever have the opportunity or the misfortune to dismantle one you will see that the hard drive looks no different to what is inside your pc.
the only visible difference is it may have a sata connection rather than ide.
i discovered this by chance when the connection pins on an external device my son had were no longer usable and we replaced the case.
as for how long an external hdd will last for can only be answered by another question.
how long is a piece of string?
it could die next week or in ten years time.
only plug it when you actually need to use it would be the only way to ensure a long life.
