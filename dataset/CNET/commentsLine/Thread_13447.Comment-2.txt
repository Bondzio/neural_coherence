since all internet connections, specifically the modem, have an address called the mac address, and this address is assigned to your connection and account, it's highly unlikely anyone could steal your account.
when you connect another modem (the only way to get access to the account) to a dsl line, the host computer sees a discrepancy in the address(s) and will either stop working or deliver garbage.
why do you think this is happening?
call verizon and have them test for extra connections.
