i've never needed to do it, so i can't really tell you how it's done.
when i reformatted my old computer i saved picture and document files to either a cd, dvd or external hd, then i use the original system disc to do a clean install, which gets you back to square one.
if you've downloaded programs, make a list of the serial numbers or registration numbers for each program, then re-downloading them should be easy, and simply add the registration number to get the proper access.
sometimes the websites where you download and purchase programs keep your registration numbers.
