unfortunately, the line being rented is in a convention center in the us, and these places make their own rules.
lucky they are not making me pay the local union crew to carry my router in for me!
have kept costs down somewhat in the past by paying $400 for a dry-pair to the broadband company that owns the lines in the cenvention center just so i could then pay a local dsl outfit to provide the bandwidth at a much cheaper rate and the local dsl guys don't care about a router or number of machines.
don't really have the time to find a trustworthy isp for dsl before this convention though.
