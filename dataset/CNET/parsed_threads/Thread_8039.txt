<s> My cable provider has installed a separate RCA DHG536 modem for my VoIP phone service alongside my SB5120 modem, and charges me $7 a month modem rental. </s>
<s> I am upgrading the SB5120 to a DOC 3.0 modem and wonder if I can abandon the DHG536 modem? </s>
<s> The DHG536 (with VoIP) and SB51209 (without VoIP) are both cable modems...are your sure they are working alongside each other? </s>
<s> That doesn't seem right. </s>
<s> It would seem that your provider should have replaced the SB5120 with the DHG536. </s>
<s> In any case, the SB6121 is not a VoIP modem. </s>
<s> You would need something like the SBV6220. </s>
<s> You should first check with your ISP on which VoIP modems are compatible with your service. </s>
<s> Installer used a splitter ahead of the SB5120 to do the phone set up, and the outputs from the DHG536 are phone only; basically leaving the 5120 to function as internet only. </s>
<s> I will look into the SBV6220 as a way to shave costs. </s>
<s> Many thanks! </s>
