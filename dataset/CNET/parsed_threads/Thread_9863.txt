<s> Hi I was cleaning my Desktop Computer, I open it, and remove all the dust from all the vents with some cotton, also from the video card vent. </s>
<s> When I start using again my computer, I heard a strange sound comingo from inside the PC. </s>
<s> I open it again and notice that the sound was coming from the video card vent. </s>
<s> What can I do?? </s>
<s> I am very worried, because I dont want my video card to overheat. </s>
<s> Can I change the videoCard vent?? </s>
<s> Thanks!!! </s>

<s> I see kits for video card fans at places like newegg.com and Compusa Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> Possible cotton fibers in vent and wrapped around cooling fan axle? </s>
<s> You may have to remove the fan to clean it or replace it. </s>
<s> (Next time just use a can of compressed air.) </s>
