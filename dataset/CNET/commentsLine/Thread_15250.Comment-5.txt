i found your message when i was searching the forum.
i am planning to sign up a cox cable tv and internet package (cox is the monopoly provider in my area of northern virginia) and i am confused by their web offerings.
their site talks about extra charges for adding more computers.
i plan to buy the cable modem myself and not rent from them at $15/month.
one of the &quot;approved&quot; modems is a motorola surfboard which has buit-in wireless capability.
from your comments, it sounds like i would not need to pay cox so additional computers could access the internet.
i would just register one ip address with cox (i.e.
the surfboard) and then add other computers any time i want without paying extra.
does that sounds correct?
