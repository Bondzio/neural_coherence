i just bought a maxtor &quot;diamond max&quot; 200gb internal hard drive and became frustrated with the installation.
the instructions state that you must create a bootable floppy disk with the ata drivers for windows xp.
that would be fine, except that my computer has no floppy drive.
the directions suggest that you use a temporary plug-in external floppy drive for this purpose....great.
i had to drive 20 miles to buy the drive...now i have to go back and buy a floppy drive so that i can install it?
my question is this.
are all internal hard drives like that?
do they all require a floppy disk boot?
i'd rather buy and install a different hard drive at this point.
the thing is, maxtor didn't include &quot;floppy drive&quot; in the specs listed on the box, so i thought i'd be fine.
now i'm scared to purchase any of them.
please help?
