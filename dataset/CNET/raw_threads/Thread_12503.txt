Sometimes, the computer will freeze during a burn and I have to restart it. Then, if I try the process again it may burn ok. It appears to be absolutely random. Any suggestions. Regards, Bert.

However I'd like to read that the power supply is 450 or more Watts and that you tried it with the cover off to sniff out cooling issues. In closing, no operating system was noted but if compatible I'd run Housecall and EWIDO to eject what they find. Bob

My explanation is &quot;Gremlins&quot;. Have never found a good reason, and have learned to not tear my computer apart looking for one. After closing Nero and rebooting, same exact settings make a good burn. If it is more than a occasional thing, then look for a reason. chuck
