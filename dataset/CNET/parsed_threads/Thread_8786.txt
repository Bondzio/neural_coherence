<s> I am looking to max out my laptop memory (8 Gigs). </s>
<s> My issue is that I am from the school that all computer components are the same. </s>
<s> Let me know of any product preferrence that you have and why. </s>
<s> I've looked at Kingston and PNY but I can't decided which I want to go with. </s>
<s> System: Sony Vaio VCPEB290 X; Core i5 @2.53 GHz; Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit; 4 Gigs RAM </s>
<s> You go to their web site, plug in your device information and it lists compatible RAM. </s>
<s> I've used them many times with nary a problem. </s>
<s> Its very important to check the specs of your laptop to understand the what it supports. </s>
<s> I can only suggest as you have 4gb already it may not support more or you have to remove some ram in order to re-use the now empty slot(s) to populate with larger ram sticks. </s>
<s> Otherwise, its a mute point. </s>
<s> Alas, when it comes to brand it always nice to have the same type and/or brand installed. </s>
<s> It may not matter but it can if the system is too picky. </s>
<s> As already suggested to you, crucial is a good place to review and kingston is also one. </s>
<s> The vaule of either one is the replacement or if there is an issue you can return them minus any s/h costs. </s>
<s> review the warranty and what it entails. </s>
<s> I have found these website good sources due to cost and/or sales at times. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com http://www.geeks.com http://www.tigerdirect.com Its all up to you and I find it best review again what policies they have in order to understand they maybe. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies Willy and Steven. </s>
<s> for $95, I'd get a matching pair of 4GB by 2 DIMMs. </s>
