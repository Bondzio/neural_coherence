Thanks.
I thought it was a short also.
Until I swtch the mouse into the port where the keyboard was and it worked I am going to see about one of those no frills Keyboards.
I'll let you know what happens.
Thank you very much you helped a lot At the very least I know that Logitech is full of it and this is a well known problem, ABout the Cd I am going to bury it to make sure my mother doesn't load it.
