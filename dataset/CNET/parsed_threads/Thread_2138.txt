<s> Hi i was thinking of buying one of these external hard drives to back up my internal hard drive, as on start up its making a noise. </s>
<s> Or if i where to buy a new pc. </s>
<s> would it be easy to save everything on to a external hard drive and if i lost my original or bought a new PC transfer everything back that i saved to the external hard drive ? </s>
<s> Unless you really really need portability ...a second internal HDD for data easy, quick backup and CD-DVD burner is a better way to start. </s>
