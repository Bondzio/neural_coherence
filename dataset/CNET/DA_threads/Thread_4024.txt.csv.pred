1.1.1	It has been a while since last I bought a new desktop computer .	St
1.1.2	I have started researching , and found there have been a lot of changes in technology since my last purchase .	St
1.1.3	I am pretty well settled on an Intel E6600 CPU with a Gigabyte GA-965P-DS4 motherboard .	St
1.1.4	This board has pretty well everything I want already onboard , except a graphics card .	St
1.1.5	This is where I am bogging down in my search .	St
1.1.6	I had intended to keep my NEC 1800 LCD monitor , and just upgrade the processor box .	St
1.1.7	However , now I am having second thoughts .	St
1.1.8	The GA-965P-DS4 motherboard has these newer PCIE slots , which to my understanding are a replacement for the older AGP slots and cards .	St
1.1.9	But I am not sure which PCIE video card to get - and I am not sure if they are available to feed my old analog LCD monitor , or if they only come with a digital interface ( which will force me to also buy a new digital interfaced monitor ) .	St
1.1.10	I am not a gamer , but I do want one of the fastest systems for digital photo and video editing , as well as running Adobe 's Creative Suite of applications ; I find that my current system just does not have the horsepower to drive these programs efficiently .	St
1.1.11	I also want a system that will be ready for Windows Vista when it eventually ships ; my understanding is that it will need considerable horsepower and also a strong video card with 'pixel shading ' .	St
1.1.12	So , my question is : what would be a good recommendation for a video card for my new system , and do I need to get a digital monitor , or is there a PCIE card that has analog output ?	Ques
1.1.13	Or should I go with a digital card and new monitor - is there an advantage ?	Ques
1.1.14	Btw..	St
1.1.15	I notice many of these newer video cards support dual monitors.. this is NOT a feature that I require , and do n't wish to pay extra for it .	St
1.1.16	Finally , I would also appreciate some links to sites on video cards - reviews , recommendations , etc .	St
1.1.17	Thanks !	St
1.1.18	!	St
1.2.1	all new geforce/radeon perform about the same for 2D apps such as Adobe CS2 .	St
1.2.2	any geforce 7300gt or radeon x1600pro will be more than sufficient .	St
1.2.3	both are in the $ 90 price range ( from web shops ) and both will fully support vista when it arrives .	St
1.2.4	also , practically all new cards come with dual monitor and hdtv support .	St
1.2.5	you 're not paying extra for them since they 're standard equipment nowadays .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply..	St
1.3.2	I read up on it , and it looks like the x1600 pro is just what I need , and well within my budget .	St
1.3.3	It also has both VGA and DVI interfaces , so I can use it now on my current LCD monitor , and also later if I choose to upgrade to a digital monitor .	St
1.3.4	btw.. it mentions 'crossfire ready ' ... what exactly is crossfire ?	Ques
1.4.1	... is ATI 's name for when two graphics cards that can be linked together for more 3D power .	St
1.4.2	Please be aware that while the hardware reqired by M $ Vista is not actually huge , no graphics card on the market at the moment provides & quot ; full support & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	http : //www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/evaluate/hardware/vistarpc.mspx Vista will use DirectX10 ( and support DirectX9 ) , and all graphics cards at the moment are only DirectX9 .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reports/article.php/3616546 GeeBee .	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the reply..	St
1.5.2	I guess it is just as well then that I am not shelling out big bucks for a graphics card.. the X1600 is only about $ 135 CAD .	St
1.5.3	And since I do n't expect Vista to be stable for another year , I probably wo n't be migrating before then , so I still think the X1600 will do for a while .	St
1.5.4	thanks , pl	Polite
1.6.1	Vista 's Aero interface is built on DX9 , not DX10 .	St
1.6.2	MS chose to do this since DX9 is stable and they 've been working on Aero for over 2+ years .	St
1.6.3	Aero will be migrated to DX10 in a future Vista release .	St
1.6.4	Any DX9 card with SM 3.0 and 128MB of RAM will fully support Vista/Aero .	St
1.7.1	... a site recently which detailed 2D speeds , and while all the cards were stratospheric scorers , it did n't look to have moved on much from the good old days .	St
1.7.2	Cards which would n't even score in the top 100 ( Matrox/3Dfx /XGi/Videologic were even listed I think ) now for 3D speed , were easily a match for more modern hardware ( if I found it interesting , I 'd be able to find it again !	St
1.7.3	) .	St
1.7.4	Apparently 2D speeds have been pretty much topped out ( I ca n't even find the link now , but remeber Matrox 550 was a good & quot ; old & quot ; scorer ) for many years with no drive for extra speeds , so any card will be adequate for what you require .	St
1.7.5	Here 's a link detailing the X1600Pro ( and Crossfire ) fully too .	St
1.7.6	http : //www.guru3d.com/article/Videocards/360/1/ The only caveat ... the power required .	St
1.7.7	It 's not exactly a low power device , so please make sure your PSU can provide the current required .	St
1.7.8	GB .	St
1.8.1	... that & quot ; full support & quot ; will not include Vista 's DX10 , ramarc .	St
1.8.2	No need to get so testy !	St
1.8.3	GB .	St
1.9.1	Thanks again for all the advice .	St
1.9.2	As I said , I am not a gamer , so it would appear the X1600 will do nicely for me - and the price seems right .	St
1.9.3	My only concern now is the motherboard I intended to use ( Gigabyte GA-965P-DS4 ) seems to be having problems .	St
1.9.4	I just heard from my dealer that Gigabyte recently recalled all these boards because of a design flaw in the chipset .	St
1.9.5	Who knows if the next release will be stable !	St
1.9.6	Gon na have to do some more research on this board .	St
1.9.7	Again , thanks for all the advice for the video card !	Polite
1.10.1	Yes , regarding power , I just read : : Power-Hungry Graphics If there 's one area of computer hardware that is getting a bit out of hand , it 's PC graphics .	St
1.10.2	ATI and Nvidia are releasing newer and faster products at a breakneck pace -- single-card SLI powerhouses , double-wide ATI CrossFire behemoths , Nvidia 's Quad SLI -- all seemingly designed with no heed to power consumption or heat production .	St
1.10.3	If you think DirectX 10 will alleviate these concerns , you 're dead wrong : The combined requirements of Vista , DirectX 10 , and upcoming 3D games and applications will drive GPU technology through the ceiling .	St
1.10.4	Companies like Thermaltake are even ramping up for this increased power draw by releasing dedicated GPU power supplies .	St
1.10.5	These units range from 250 to 300 watts , fit into an open 5.25-inch drive bay , and supply power exclusively to the GPU .	St
1.10.6	From these wattage specifications , it 's safe to assume that first-generation DirectX 10 cards will be power-hungry products indeed .	St
1.10.7	Heat production is another potential sore spot , and all indications say that cooling will be a challenge for Vista-ready GPUs .	St
1.10.8	The only hope is that second-generation or subsequent revisions will bring DirectX 10 products that get us back on track with a sane balance of high performance and energy savings , much as Nvidia has done with the evolution of its GeForce 7600 and 7900 GPUs .	St
1.11.1	some folks will never use dx10 or game so little that a dx9 card will suffice them for years to come .	St
1.11.2	there 's just no need for them to think they 've got to get a dx10 card in order to use the full vista ui .	St
1.12.1	... power requirement indicated in the hardware review review : http : //www.guru3d.com/article/Videocards/360/4/ The X1600 and modern graphics cards in general are a power hungry bunch .	St
1.12.2	If you do n't have the PSU overhead to spare at the moment , you 're looking immediately at extra expense .	St
1.12.3	Or you could go for one of those older cards that still do well in 2D speeds , and suck up far less power .	Sug
1.12.4	There are a few modern cards which use less wattage though : http : //www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/gpu-consumption2006_7.html http : //www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/geforce7900gtx_6.html X-bit seems to be one of the few tech sites that actually measures current draw , which may help upgraders to avoid upseting a weaker PSU .	St
1.12.5	Personally if the DX10 hardware coming in 2007 is going to be as bad as suspected , I suspect the electricity to power them for a year ( we 've had 3 prices rises in 6 months ) , may be more than the cost of the computers themselves !	St
1.12.6	GB .	St
