<s> Did you check if this memory is compatible with your motherboard? </s>
<s> It doesn't seem so. </s>
<s> Use the tools at crucial.com or kingston.com. </s>
<s> If it should work, then go to www.memtest86.com and download the program to make a bootable diskette or CD to test the memory. </s>
<s> As long as that gives errors, Windows certainly won't run reliably. </s>
