3815	0	55285	658898	NR	jscarano	1/5/05 1:21 PM	1.10493126E12	Computer locks up	I have an AMD Athlon XP 2000, 512mb ddr 2100, 450 watt psu, ASUS A7N8X-X mobo. My problem is the cpu is getting way to hot and locking up. I have a fan/heatsink on it but I dont have any of the white goop stuff on it. I have MBM 5 running and it sometime says that the cpu is at 165 degrees F. I know thats hot. Why does it do that when I have a fan/heatsink on it. My fan seems to be fine. Do I need a bigger one because the one I got seems pretty big? Could it be the cpu getting older? I dunno. thanks for the help! -Jordan

Starting with absolutely clean surfaces, the thermal compound needs to be only a rather thin film. No way is more goop better. If you select a conductive paste then be careful to not get it anywhere but on the actual mating surfaces. It is NOT a squeeze out between the two surfaces process. Keep in mind that the interior ambient air temperature that the HSF is transfering heat to should be only about 12 to 20 F degrees above your room ambient. Therefore cooling the entire interior will also lower CPU temps. Yep Athlons run hot. If it is one that does NOT have the heat spreader to increase the effective surface of the CPU, the heat is being dissipated over about a one square inch surface. Thus the thermal transfer from the CPU to the Heatsink is very critical. Intel has used the heat speader for years. I understand that some of the 32 bit Athlons are now using them. The AMD 64 bitters all use heatspreaders.
