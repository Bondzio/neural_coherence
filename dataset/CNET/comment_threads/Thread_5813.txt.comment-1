I was running Windows XP with SP1 and my computer shut down in about 30 seconds.I installed SP2 and now it takes close to 7 minutes.Its very annoying.I read about turning off programs in the sys.tray,but i'm not sure which ones to turn off.Any help would be appreciated,but please don't make it too technical.
Thanks.
