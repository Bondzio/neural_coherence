<s> Posted in the Desktop Hardware forum: Good afternoon. </s>
<s> I am planning on getting an ATI 4850 or 4870 sometime in the late spring or early summer when prices would be even lower. </s>
<s> I am trying to hold off building a new computer for another year from then (built in in October 2005 - nVidia 7800 GT, ASUS A8N-E, AMD Athlon 64 4000+, Windows XP). </s>
<s> Would this single-core, 2.4 GHz AMD processor will act as a bottleneck when used with one of the abovementioned cards in gaming? </s>
<s> I know that processors are not nearly as important as video cards, but I am wondering if a processor that old would be an exception to this rule... </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Saves us from duplicating efforts. </s>
