I'm selling my old computer to try and get what meager cash I can recover before I buy my new one.
With rampant identity theft and general insecurity abound these days I would very much like to do a disk wipe before I take my system to the store.
Although the nice man said he would do one for me I would rather do it myself if you know what I mean.
Anyway, since this is the first time I have done this I was wondering if anyone would recommend a disk wipe utility (price is irrelivant this is important stuff) that is reliable and thorough.
Any other thoughts to consider or general information/horror stories you could help me avoid would be much appreciated.
Thanks, Jim
