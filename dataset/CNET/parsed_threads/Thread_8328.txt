<s> I was wondering if something like this exists: I use Google Talk to talk to people around the US and overseas, using a USB headset which I absolutely love. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to go wireless with it. </s>
<s> I know I could do something with Bluetooth, but the range is pretty limited (30 feet max, under great, line-of-sight conditions). </s>
<s> I would prefer to go further (a couple of hundred feet would be nice) and for the signal to be able to pass through walls, just like a regular cordless phone. </s>
<s> I was wondering if I could carry a small transmitter/receiver that I plug the headset into, and also have a transmitter/receiver (not necessarily small) plugged into a USB port on my computer. </s>
<s> Please let me know if there's a solution to this. </s>
<s> Thank you very much, Colin </s>
<s> I bought the CIT200 by Linksys and find it acceptable for family use. </s>
<s> It has about the range of a normal cordless phone. </s>
