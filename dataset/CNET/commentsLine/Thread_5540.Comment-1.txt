i have an emachine with 512mb of ram which is now at 448mb.
i need to upgrade to 1gb but i can't find a store that carries this model.
the model is a emachine w3507 and runs windows xp home edition.
would i need to buy a new modem?
i can't download because it tells me my memory is too low.
can anyone help me with this?
