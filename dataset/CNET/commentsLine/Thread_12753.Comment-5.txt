well i'm thinking linux probably isn't worth the trouble anyway, so i'll just figure out what to do with my hp recovery partition (didn't shell out extra for actual vista install disks) and start over.
i'm not trying to insult you, but just to make sure, you do understand that the partition in question, the windows partition, is completely usable, in fact i'm on it right now, but windows doesn't recognize its size correctly?
