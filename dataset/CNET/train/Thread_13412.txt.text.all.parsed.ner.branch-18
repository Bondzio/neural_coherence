7969	3	558569	5287515	5287501	hforman	3/16/12 6:30 pm	1.3319226e12	as someone already suggested	first, take a look at what bandwidth you have natively. are you using cable for your internet access? what bandwidth do they give you? do you have dsl? same question! maybe it might be more beneficial to get more bandwidth but you'll have to ask your iinternet provider (isp) about what is available for at what cost. the other suggestion is very important too. even though you may not want to put any security on your router so it would be easy for your customers to use, there are two issues with this. first, as the signal for the wifi is not contained within your pub, others may be stealing your bandwidth using it for downloads, movies, and streaming music. what i would do is apply wpa2 wireless security. you can post the &quot;password&quot; (password-of-the-day or password-of-the-week) somewhere in the pub where your customers can see it. make sure that your next-door neighbors are not also your customers or you may need to change the password more often. you may be able to control the signal strenth in the wifi to try and keep the signal contained within the pub instead of leaking out to the neighbors. by the way, even if the &quot;neighbors&quot; are businesses, it would be a lot cheaper for them to have internet access by using your wifi then paying for their own so i would definitely use wpa2 security and change the passphrase every so often. there are also firewalls and packetshapers that would let you fine-tune what you will allow and what you will not allow. these could be pricey but maybe not. you can always do some research and see what the costs would be and what features you really need.

(password of the day!) it can be posted in a place that is not visible from the outside (through a window for example) but easy to see for customers. or it can be a card attached to the menu, the say as the &quot;special of the day&quot; {sotd} there are apps (like msdonalds and other places, that do not allow access to their free wifi until you agree to play by the rules. and i suspect those should be easy to find if your router cannot be setup to ask for a password. this will not stop leeches within the restaurant, but if bandwidth is the issue, many routers can be set with a bandwidth limit per connection. email and the like will usually be quite fine at 50 to 100k bandwidth (although some emails can get stuffed with lotsa of graphics) but to keep video feeds to a minimum, 100k bandwidth limits will make most video (especially movies) quite unwatchable, but even graphics happy webpages load relatively quickly.

(port 8080 is generally used for websites under development, though, where they are usually only to be viewed by the developers themselves, so you may not need to unblock it). secure it with wpa2 and use a passkey. provide your customers with the passkey on request. of course, this won't address the issue of a person who has in the past been a customer becoming a leech, but you can deal with this by creating a new passkey each morning or so.
