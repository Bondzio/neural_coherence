What lights blink, do fans turn, does holding down the del key on power up do anything? You may be asking &quot;How do I repair my own PC?&quot; Come right out and ask. Be aware that you may have to test parts in other machines, put in a new motherboard CMOS battery, clear the CMOS settings, undo/remove recent added hardware, reset cards and such. Are you ready to rip off the case cover? Bob
