1.1.1	My new broadband provider has sent me a Netgear DG834GT ( 108Mbs ) , but I already have a DG834G ( 54Mbs ) .	St
1.1.2	My house has no wired ethernet , my wireless router just plugs straight into the phone line via the filter .	St
1.1.3	We have three laptops and currently we do n't get wireless reception in one part of the house .	St
1.1.4	I was wondering whether I could use my spare router ( my old one ) to create an access point somewhere in the trouble spot ( which , obviously , is at the opposite end of the house to the main router ) .	St
1.1.5	My understanding of the difference between Access Point , Repeater and Wireless Bridge is really really vague .	St
1.1.6	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	& quot ; my wireless router just plugs straight into the phone line via the filter & quot ; On DSL the DSL modem does not get a filter .	St
1.2.2	Are you on DSL ?	Ques
1.2.3	See this link - & gt ; http : //www.rkssoftware.com/mightyfax/dslhookup.html http : //www.netgear.com/Products/RoutersandGateways/GWirelessRouters/DG834G.aspx does not appear to be configurable as an access point .	St

1.3.1	Could I plug both routers into two phone sockets and have them both connect to my broadband provider , or is that not possible ( only one log-in per line )	St
1.4.1	DSL does n't work like that .	St
1.4.2	Dead end .	St
1.4.3	I 'll guess you are having issues such as coverage or such .	St
1.4.4	The 2 items I check when I see that is ... 1 .	St
1.4.5	Change the channel to 1 , 6 or 11 and retest .	St
1.4.6	2 .	St
1.4.7	Make sure the router firmware is the latest .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 'm not sure .	Res
1.5.2	But that photo is pretty much my set-up .	St
1.5.3	My router and regular phone plug into a 'micro-filter ' , which I guess is the line-splitter thing , and that plugs into the phone line on the wall .	St
1.6.1	OK , thanks .	Polite
1.6.2	I 'll give that a go .	St
1.6.3	Seems like that 's the only option , without buying something new - like a repeater .	St
1.7.1	I just came across this Netgear page : http : //kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101496.asp My DG834G is a modem/router/switch/access point/firewall in one , and I 've seen from the router admin page that I can switch off its DHCP assigning function .	St
1.7.2	If I disabled its auto-configuration to a network , gave it a static IP outside the range of my main router ( DG834GT ) , gave my laptops static IPs , and if I made sure the router ( GT ) and access point ( G ) were broadcasting the same SSID on different channels ... would n't that work ?	Ques
1.7.3	The GT would now be a modem & wireless router ; the G would be an access point .	St
