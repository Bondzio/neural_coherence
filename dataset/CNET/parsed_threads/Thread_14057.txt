<s> I was looking at the customers of this Patriot RAM and noticed something which I thought odd. </s>
<s> A couple people said that, although the 2 x 1GB sticks ran at the 12000MHZ they are supposed to, adding another 2 x 1GB sticks of the exact same RAM slowed the entire FSB down. </s>
<s> Why would this be and is there anyway it could be avoided? </s>
<s> A tiny bit extra voltage maybe? </s>
<s> Below is the link and the reviews I was talking about. </s>
<s> Customer 1 This memory is very good. </s>
<s> Sometimes you have to burn the memory in so it can run properly and overclock. </s>
<s> This memory is specified to run at 1200mhz with 2 gigs not 4. </s>
<s> So before you purchase please do the research. </s>
<s> You very seldom run 4 gigs over 1100 mhz. </s>
<s> Customer 2 Cons: none-cant run 4Gigs at 1200Mhz http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220282 </s>
<s> the official ddr2 spec ends at ddr2-1066. </s>
<s> also, no mobo officially supports ddr2-1200. </s>
<s> as with any overclocking, your results are dependent on the specific components. </s>
<s> so one x38 mobo may be able to hit ddr2-1200 with that ram while another x38 mobo may not. </s>
<s> likewise, one mobo may OC a CPU up to 4ghz while another may only get it to 3.8ghz. </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> : ddr2-1200 will require a lot of voltage... these sticks want 2.3V. </s>
<s> the official ddr2 spec is only 1.8V so that's 27% over spec and some mobos simply can't provide it. </s>
<s> adding 4 sticks would need even more voltage. </s>
<s> and 2.3V will need a very good quality power supply with extremely tight voltage regulation. </s>
<s> Today the physics still apply that as you add more devices on a CPU &quot;bus&quot; it slows since each device adds capacitance. </s>
<s> This is not a design bug or issue and I see someone else pointed out the overclocking aspect. </s>
<s> Lesson? </s>
<s> Get by with just 2 sticks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My EVGA nForce 780i motherboard, though, says it supports 1200mhz ram? </s>
<s> 800mhz is the next highest. </s>
<s> It should be able to take 1066mhz as well, right? </s>
<s> Here's the for my motherboard if you need it. </s>
<s> http://www.evga.com/products/moreInfo.asp?pn=132-CK-NF78-A1&family=Motherboard%20Family </s>
<s> ddr2-1200 has no official spec, so if it doesn't work, you can't call evga and expect them to fix/rma the board. </s>
<s> likewise, you can't call patriot and expect a free replacement if it doesn't hit ddr2-1200 on your board. </s>
<s> so even though my motherboard lists 1200 as a RAM FSB speed, they still wouldn't offer support if it didn't work? </s>
<s> What about 1066mhz RAM? </s>
<s> Could that work even though it isn't listed? </s>
<s> Some one called in on this and the support was this. </s>
<s> &quot;Use the verified memory we used.&quot; And &quot;No we didn't test that memory.&quot; And lastly &quot;Sorry if that didn't work for you.&quot; </s>
<s> :P thank you </s>
