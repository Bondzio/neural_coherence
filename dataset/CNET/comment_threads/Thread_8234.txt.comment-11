If you are talking to LAN administrators and similar jobs, multiple backups are absolutely necessary.
Personally, my home computer has a 500 gigabyte hard drive.
I also have a small 500 gigabyte USB connection box (palm size).
The brand is &quot;My Passport&quot; but there are others too.
A general superstition is to turn on your computer and all peripherals and leave them on for a few days.
If something is going to fail, it will probably do it then.
Also you should get a new hard drive every few years.
No comment on terabyte hard drives since I still don't trust them.
