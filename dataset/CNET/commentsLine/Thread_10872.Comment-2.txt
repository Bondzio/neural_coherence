there exist devices called kvm switches (keyboard video mouse).
the best of them are the electronically switched ones, but the only ones i've ever seen in that flavor are 8-way, and quite pricey.
a few years ago i purchased a 4 way mechanical switch at a local mom&pop computer shop.
it was quite reasonable, and has worked fairly well, with only a few minor glitches due to contact problems.
