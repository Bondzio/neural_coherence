i totally agree with john3347!
many websites are also setup for a widescreen format which means you have to scroll back & forth as well as up & down to read a page.
very irritating!
makes me think of formal written documents printed the longways on standard 8x11 paper!
not proper protocol!
and as for tv, i also hate the new &quot;short-screen&quot; format.
new tvs in widescreen size look lopped off, like where's the top half!
i won't watch anything that's not broadcast in standard screen size format.
the standard camera snapshot also went &quot;wide&quot; some years ago.
however, i see most people holding their cameras vertically to capture individual photos.
the wide format is only good for panaramas!
if there are so many people who really like this new widescreen then somebody needs to invent some way to provide an option for tv screens, i.e., standard or widescreen!
without losing quality for either size.
