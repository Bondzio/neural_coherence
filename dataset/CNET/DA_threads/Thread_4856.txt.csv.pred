1.2.1	The CPU has to be a Socket A which limits things a bit.	St
1.2.2	Also, the AGP for graphics is somewhat old as PCI-e has taken over things.	St
1.2.3	I also think that if you look at even a Socket 939 motherboard you could get things sped up quite a bit as well as possibly get a dual-core processor which would also help as new games will likely take advantage of the additional processing power.	St
1.2.4	Regards, JB	St
1.3.1	if I go with the 939 AMD socket, what would be a good motherboard to buy.	St
1.4.1	&quot;Asus' A8N32-SLI Deluxe&quot; is what I have in my home PC.	St
1.4.2	&quot;eVGA nForce4 SLI&quot; is another idea if you look at ExtremeTech's $800 budget gaming PC.	St
1.4.3	Regards, JB	St
1.5.1	extreme tech, great website to see what others put together and with great reviews.	St
