Good Morning.
Thanks for the Info.
For now, since I'm 4 years away from college, I'll stick with my list for now.
I'll keep the tablet idea in mind.
I think I might go for the MBP, since from what I've read it sounds the better of the two.
I'll be buying of Amazon so they give something like a $150 rebate.
Also do you know if Apple will be relasing any new hardware besides the iPhone this year, like a new MB or MBP.
Thanks again
