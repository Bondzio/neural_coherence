1.1.1	I have gone through about 5 PC 's now , and usually because out dated .	St
1.1.2	/ With the newer computers I really believe its best to leave PC on and use the & quot ; stand-by & quot ; or sleep mode when not using it for longer than 3hours .	St
1.1.3	The only time I turn off , is if I am not going to be using it for longer than 48 hours , or for a Update-restart .	St
1.1.4	Not good for the hard drive to shut it off and on/ will shorten life .	St
1.1.5	/ hope this helps .	St
1.2.1	I think that leaving the PC & quot ; asleep & quot ; or in the stand by mode is the same as shutting it off .	St
1.2.2	It would be better to leave in the & quot ; always active & quot ; mode so that the hard drive wont have to wake up and recover each time you move your mouse .	St
1.2.3	That will strain it and shorten its life as well .	St
1.3.1	Harddrive failures I have seen involve wear .	St
1.3.2	So I think not running it more than necessary is the better option .	St
1.4.1	I 've also heard that to leave it on was better for the computer .	St
1.4.2	The expanding and contracting of the chips and boards wears them out faster .	St
1.4.3	I 've used the same computer since 1998 and I believe that its lasted because of this .	St
1.4.4	Eva Lumby aka	St
1.5.1	Why waste the electricity ?	Ques
1.5.2	If you are n't going to use it for at least 3 hours , turn it off !	St
1.5.3	The only condition I would make is do NOT turn it on and off frequently .	St
1.5.4	The repeated surges coming on , the temperature changes as the MB heats up and cools down are what are detrimental to the circuitry .	St
1.5.5	The longer the hard drive is running , the more likely for some part , especially the bearings and actuator arm , to fail .	St
1.5.6	If you will be using the computer within 3-4 hours , then put in stand by .	St
1.5.7	If more , shut it off .	St
1.5.8	Your computer need & quot ; down-time & quot ; ( sleep ) just like you do .	St
1.6.1	I turn mine off when not in use .	St
1.6.2	This is for two reasons - 1.To save risk of damage of components due to heat build-up , and shortening of the life of the processor fan and others .	St
1.6.3	2.To reduce electricity use which mounts up over time .	St
1.6.4	My computer is a Windows 98 2E on 56K dial-up .	St
1.7.1	Those reasons are good .	Polite
1.7.2	Semiconductors have a limited life span , and heat shortens their life .	St
1.7.3	Computer monitors sometimes fail if they do not have enough ventilation as well .	St
1.7.4	Microprocessors have the same problem too .	St
1.7.5	If a computer draws 100 watts , that adds up to about 4 dollars per month if run continuously at about 8 cents per kwhr .	St
1.7.6	I also have only dial-up , I even use the high speed for $ 5 more per month because it loads pages faster and it lowers stress on internet servers , I think .	St
