i agree with everything yasingmd said and would like to add another tool that has worked great for me.
i would start with step 6 from his post and if that doesn't work try the link below.
personal taste.
if those two steps don't work go ahead and start with step 1 from yosingmd.
a side note regarding external drives.
for the future: don't trust them!
if you want safety with your storage (sorry), you need a raid setup (array) which is redundant drives (2-4+ hds)with the same data automatically stored on all of them.
there is raid hardware being sold everyday.
google it.
it isn't cheap.
(again - sorry)
