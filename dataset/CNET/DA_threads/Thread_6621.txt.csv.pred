1.1.1	Santa brought a new dvd drive for christmas .	St
1.1.2	He got a OEM from newegg .	St
1.1.3	All that came was the drive and that was all .	St
1.1.4	Santa 's helper ( me ) installed it .	St
1.1.5	It must need drivers because it will not play a dvd movie .	St
1.1.6	The drive is a ''NEC DVD_RW ND-3550A .	St
1.1.7	I went on google to look for NEC but did n't find what I was looking for .	St
1.1.8	Please help !	St
1.1.9	!	St
1.2.1	Titles like PowerDVD , WinDVD are common .	St
1.2.2	Having just the drive is not enough .	St
1.2.3	Also , drivers do n't fix this issue .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	When I put the dvd in auto run starts and a window opens and wants to know what program I want to use .	St
1.3.2	I chose Windows Media Player .	St
1.3.3	Another window opens and says '' Windows Media Player can not play the dvd because a compatible dvd decoder is not installed on your computer '' .	St
1.3.4	There are two buttons under that one is ''close '' and the other is ''web help '' .	St
1.3.5	Web help takes me to a site to buy a plug in .	St
1.3.6	Is that what I need or is there something else ?	Ques
1.4.1	You can find them for sale on the web but I found it cheaper to get a drive with said player software .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	You can either go directly to the Cyberlink website http : //gocyberlink.com to see what kind of deals they offer or just buy from the link you got directed to by Windows .	St
1.5.2	There are free alternative 's , but the codecs those freebie 's install sometimes play havoc with other media and playback software .	St
1.5.3	The Cyberlink plugin for Windows Media Player will give you the PowerDVD 4 codec ( I believe ) , and your DVD 's will play fine in Windows Media Player on Windows XP .	St
1.5.4	This does n't work on 98SE or Me since WMP does n't play DVD 's on those OS 's .	St
1.5.5	You just miss some of the fancy audio and video tricks like multichannel audio and video enhancement .	St
1.5.6	You get the decoder that downmixes the DVD 's audio to 2 channel stereo and the video codec that will enable DVD playback through Windows Media Player 9 and 10 .	St
1.6.1	I 'm having same problem .	St
1.6.2	This problem only happens to new release DVDs .	St
1.6.3	I have powerDVD and winDVD , and have 3 domputers with 3 different dvd-drives .	St
1.6.4	However results are same .	St
1.6.5	I was trying to watch 'Transporter 2 ' which just came on BlockBuster last week , but it wo n't play on a computer but my reg .	St
1.6.6	DVD-Player plays it .	St
1.6.7	I think it 's new copyright stuff or something .	St
1.6.8	Sucks !	St
1.7.1	If not , then what I noted does NOT apply and you should start your own discussion .	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	Go to www.cliprex.com and download the FREE Frunhofer DVD codecs { 230782 } on lefthand collum and this will allow you to play dvd , s in WMP .	St
1.8.2	This works for windows ME and XP .	St
1.8.3	I , ve done it and it works .	St
