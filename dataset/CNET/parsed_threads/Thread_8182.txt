<s> Since I'll be getting a G5 soon, I'm planning to add a second hard drive. </s>
<s> I'm looking at a Western Digital 250gb SATA:( http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=59 ) The problem is in the manual for it, it doesn't say anything about Mac compatability. </s>
<s> Does that mean it isn't compatible, or did they just not address it? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> There is nothing to address on a SATA HD or an ATA HD compatibility. </s>
<s> As long as your system will recognize the drive, and it will, it will be able to initialize it and you will be in Hogs Heaven. </s>
<s> Some Manufactures will include a CD which has various bits of Windows software on it, utilities and the like, or even an setup program for the drive. </s>
<s> You, being the smart G5 owner (soon) do not need all that stuff. </s>
<s> Your system will likely tell you that there is a new drive and would you like to initialize it. </s>
<s> You will say &quot;initialize&quot; and that will be it. </s>
<s> the drive will then mount on the desktop P </s>
<s> Any Serial ATA hard drive should work fine on a new Mac G5. </s>
<s> As far as I know the connections are the same because of the SATA standard. </s>
<s> Hard drives differ from other components because drives are formated by the Operating System, as opposed to a USB or Firewire device which requires special drivers in order to communicate with the programs on the OS properly. </s>
<s> When you have physically installed the disk you will need to run &quot;Disk Utility&quot;, unless it boots itself upon detecting your new drive, to format your new drive for your Mac. </s>
<s> Before I bought my drive I called several Mac stores managers and AppleCare to find out what they recommended. </s>
<s> Without exception they like the LaCie drives. </s>
<s> I bought the d2 80GB and just added the d2 200GB. </s>
<s> They both have worked flawlessly. </s>
<s> They are very much Mac friendly, are very well built with a metal case, and come with backup software. </s>
<s> They can be stacked or daisy chained. </s>
<s> Customer support is excellent! </s>
<s> I think you can find other drives that are Mac compatable, like Maxor, but LaCie seems to be preferred for Macs. </s>
<s> BTW, you can buy refurbished drives directly from LaCie at greatly reduced prices at LaCie.com. </s>
<s> That's how I got mine and I saved big bucks. </s>
<s> I would either contact or call the company if if you can't reach them on the internet and find out before purchasing the extra hard drive. </s>
<s> The name is one that I don't recognize as being an Apple compatible but I don;t know for sure. </s>
<s> I have a LaCie 200 Gb connected by firewire external hard drive which I use to store all my completed or workiing folders. </s>
<s> My main computer has all the programs I am using on its hard drive. </s>
<s> I am beginning to store things on CD's for safe keeping, like digital photos, other Photoshop items I have completd. </s>
<s> The price of external hard drives is coming down and I have had mine three years and it is over half full right now with absolutely no problems. </s>
<s> Go with products of a good well known company with a solid reputation and you won't go wrong. </s>
<s> Pick up something just because of price and you may be asking for trouble. </s>
<s> Deal with a reputable company/dealer also. </s>
<s> It does make a difference. </s>
<s> Make SATA drives. </s>
<s> I looked at Quantum's and Seagate's websites and found they list drives by interface. </s>
<s> From there you can order one online. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> http://www.apple.com/powermac/specs.html indicates SATA-type drives for the G5. </s>
<s> Perhaps it is as simple most all drives of that type would work just fine -- that is certainly the experience I've had with the non-SATA IDE drives that are used in my Mac G4. </s>
<s> The same drives available to PC seem compatible so far. </s>
<s> I presume you have a more definitive answer from Western Digital by now, but I should think the drive you mentioned will work, either internally or in an external enclosure. </s>
<s> Good quality external enclosures in which you install an internal IDE drive are another option and seem quite compatible connected as either USB or FireWire on a Mac running OS-X. </s>
<s> I don't have experience with SATA drives in such an enclosure, however. </s>
<s> IBM's appears to be on the bleeding edge with hard drives, or so I hear. </s>
<s> I just picked up two IBM drives for backup. </s>
<s> 10,000 RPM and a mean time between failures of over a hundred years. </s>
