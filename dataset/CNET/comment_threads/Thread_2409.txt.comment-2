&quot;There is no way that the work and information on the hard drive can be saved (recovered)&quot; He then strongly advised that I &quot;reformatted&quot; my drives for the purpose of doing a &quot;fresh install of Windows&quot;.
I asked him again if there was another way to recover my system so that I would not loose my precious work.
He repeated: &quot;No.There isn't.&quot; As I am new to the innards of a computer -- and frankly, I was panic striken -- I went with his advice.&quot; That in a nutshell is at the heart of this issue plus you were handed a HIGH MAINTENANCE machine with a timebomb till it went pwoof.
I can safely bet that no one ever told you that HARD DISKS ARE TEMPORARY STORAGE.
With all I've read in your post, the formattiong, partitioning and more that has been done has moved your data recovery to only where PROFESSIONAL RECOVERY SERVICES and about 4 figures will get this back.
Before we go one step further, is there a backup of what you can't lose?
