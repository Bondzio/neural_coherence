The original idea was put together in the late 1980s based on &quot;links&quot; - high speed serial interconnect used by the transputer.
Inmos even made a disk processor for the prupose.
The second generation links eventually had the basic technology adopted and it became Firewire and the standard version was standardised as Spacewire (IEEE1355).
The original idea was to cut down the cable size and connectors - if you know anything about reliability, reliability is approximately imversely proportional to the number of connections.
It used to be that over 50% of car breakdowns were due to electrical faults, and most of these were connector problems.
