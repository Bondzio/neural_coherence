<s> Hi, Our old computer was playing up (kept automatically restarting after about 30 seconds from the time of logging in) so we bought a new one and just left the old computer sitting there. </s>
<s> I wanted to find an old file on my old computer but since it hasn't been touched for a VERY long time, it won't turn on (the monitor turns on fine but no power goes to the actual computer). </s>
<s> I know it's not the power supply cos other things work and I'm considering removing the hard drive from the old computer and connecting it to the new one but I wanted to know first if the whole automatic restarting thing might affect our new computer if the old hard drive is connected to it. </s>
<s> If anyone can help, it would really be appreciated! </s>
<s> The USB hard drive housing. </s>
<s> They cost from 20 to 50 bucks and keep the owner out of the insides of a new machine. </s>
