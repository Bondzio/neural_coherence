can you plug an unpowered usb hub into one of those usb to ac adapters then transfer data between things on the ports on it?
basically, i need to get extra power to my external hard drive that my raspberry pi can't supply, but still want to transfer data between the two.
that would be cheaper than a powered usb hub.
just wondering if someone has tried it and if it works.
