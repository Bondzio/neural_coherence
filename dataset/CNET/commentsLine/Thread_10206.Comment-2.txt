hello, there are a number of things to try 1 - disable and re-enble your wireless network card 2- some laptops have a manual turn on/off wireless 3- on the keyboard there maybe a symbol for the wifi, press it and see 4- check to see if you are getting a valid ip address, if it anything like 169.254.xx.xx then this is a self assigned ip address, you need to look at your browser settings 5- also check your router settings
