not, i say its more than dat.
about $500.
No way it can be $300 with the monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse.
and with 512mb ram and a pretty decent processor.
dont worry.
With a better video card and more ram (1gb) is enough it will be a good machine.
I wouldnt worry about 64-bit as there arent many out there so far and in the future 64-bit will probably be more used by designers, gamers, business ppl, etc.
