install the usual remote access software (gotomypc, vnc) and network, password, secure as needed.
as presented it's a mess.
i can't tell what &quot;content&quot; is.
it could be some html pages, maybe it's the usual &quot;i want to access my pc from home&quot; or something else.
what's clear so far is that the solution is not going to happen given the current skill set.
