i also do not like wide screen ,even the tv ,i just hate it .the trouble is we do not have a say.
well none of my screens are wide and it will stay that way and also i would sooner watch vhs 8 hour than dvd, they last a lot longer, some of my vhs tapes must be 30 year old and still going strong .once the dvd gets a scratch on the record paper is done with not so with a vhs just snip and stick .so lets hope that not all screens will be wide ,let the people have a say.
cheers john
