it's in the forum policies.
i have to share my experience on this issue and for me, i can't use fat32.
even at home.
video editing has pushed that firmly into the realm that fat32 can't be used.
not to mention that i've yet to see my all ntfs setups ever run chkdsk on startup.
just for that one feature i win on speed.
