had i settled for nothing else, i would have settled for the layout for a gigabyte ga-6ex motherboard .
i found the manual at the http site listed later.
the pdf manual of 20 pages shows several figures, however the figure for the motherboard is blank.
i am trying to rebuild an older computer with the gigabyte mb and need help finding the graphical layout of the board.
can anyone help?
thank you
