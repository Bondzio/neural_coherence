No one will argue with you that a fiber network would beat the pants off any WiFi network, but that is comparing apples and oranges here.
Fiber might be around the corner for home use, but I think the reality is, it is not here yet.
So unless you are ready to shell out some serious cash, you are probably not going to find a home version of the equipment you are looking for.
There is just no demand for it yet, or at least not enough.
If you are able to find a low cost solution I would be interested to learn about it though.
And if you do find a suitable switch (etc.)
how do plan to terminate your fiber runs?
