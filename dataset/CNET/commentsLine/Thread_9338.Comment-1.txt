i have a dell inspiron 1300 notebook which i use wirelessly in the house.
i'm on dsl with bell south.
i use the notebook most of the time in the living room area; the dsl modem and a lynksys router which provides the wireless signal to the notebook is connected to another dell computer; a desktop computer set up in a bedroom in the back of the house.
i'm on bell south dsl lite and during the day the speed on the notebook ranges from 36.0 to 54.0 mbps with a signal reading of good to excellent.
last night while in the living room the speed drop to 11.0 mbps; then came up to 21mbps; 36mbps and finally reached 48.0mbps.
this signal change took place while i used the notebook in the living room.
could i have a defective lynksys router?
if not is such a signal flucuation normal?
