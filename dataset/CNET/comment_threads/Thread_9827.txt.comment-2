More than likely those systems used 30 Simms Ram as my 486DX4-100 unit took 78 Simms Ram.
I worked on a number of 486 units with the 30 Simms Ram (just threw out a whole slew of them two weeks ago, btw) and 8MB ran over $30 per stick and had to be purchased as EDO/pairs by 1994.
I don't know the original price in 1989, but assume it was much higher at that time because the 78 Simms was priced about the same $30 by 1994.
