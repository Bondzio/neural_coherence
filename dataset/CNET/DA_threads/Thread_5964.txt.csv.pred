1.1.1	Have a MAG Innovision P900 LCD Monitor .	St
1.1.2	Problem is the screen going black .	St
1.1.3	Running XP Home on a computer ( Wintergreen ) bought from Tiger Direct last Christmas .	St
1.1.4	Symptom is screen going black .	St
1.1.5	Monitor power light remains green , moving mouse will not bring the display back , however if I cycle the monitor on and off display will come back for approx 2-3 seconds and then go black again .	St
1.1.6	I have display and power settings set to Never for the monitor and hard drive as well as hibernate off .	St
1.1.7	I did find the fan on the ATI Radeon 9500 video card had stopped running and very hard to turn , so instead of messing with ATI , I bought an Evga Nvidia based card , FX5500 .	St
1.1.8	Refresh is at 60 hz , resolution on desktop set to 1024 X 768 .	St
1.1.9	I know the MB is a cheapo and probably not the greatest with cooling , but that should not cause the display problems , so I am assuming the the LCD monitor is overheating .	St
1.1.10	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.11	My next step is to swap it out with my used Gateway VX900 beast and see what happens , but would still like some input if possible .	St
1.1.12	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	From your brief description of the problem , its sounds almost certainly like a power suppply problem in the monitor .	St
1.2.2	The easiest way to test it would be to grab a working monitor and hook it to your existing system , or take your monitor over to someone else 's system and see if they are having the same problems .	St
1.2.3	LCD power supplies can be replaced ( ~ $ 100 , sometimes less ) but from my recollection , MAG stuff is quite cheap and youre probably better off buying a new monitor .	St
1.2.4	But you can certainly stop swapping out video cards , as I really dont think thats whats causing your issue .	St
1.2.5	Hope that helps .	St
1.2.6	HooKs-	St
1.3.1	I have a similar problem with a Sony SDM X73 .	St
1.3.2	I assume it is overheating but it may significant that the problem started to manifest itself after I tried an 'electronic whiteboard ' attachment ( a 'Sympodium ' ) ... to my computer ( a Viglem VM4 Cube ) In any case , powering the monitor off , leaving , then powering on again works .	St
1.3.3	I also look forward to any ideas on this one .	St
1.4.1	In most cases the & quot ; backlight & quot ; portion or its related power source is kaput or going out .	St
1.4.2	LCDs rely on such to lite the screen .	St
1.4.3	If you closely by a outside light source , you should still see abit low light display on the screen .	St
1.4.4	If so found then that 's your problem .	St
1.4.5	You can have send to be repaired if under warranty or any other reputable source or just replace .	St
1.4.6	If repair is 50 % or more than up to you to replace .	St
1.4.7	The quickest test is to swap monitors to check video output and if you get display then more than likely the LCD is flaky .	St
1.4.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	I have the exact same model of monitor and am experiencing the exact same problem .	St
1.5.2	It only stays on for 2 seconds , goes black , and I must press the power button 4x to get it back on for 2 seconds before it goes blank again .	St
1.5.3	I called Mag for support , and they said that my monitor was not under warrenty since it was 14 months old .	St
1.5.4	To get it fixed , it would cost $ 100 plus shipping .	St
1.5.5	I 'm looking for a monitor from another company with a better support .	St
1.5.6	Never again .	St
1.5.7	Sounds like it 's a known problem , and they should have been able to provide a fix .	St
1.6.1	I 'm having the same problem with my HP Pavillion F1703 lcd .	St
1.6.2	It 'll go dim for a second , the go black .	St
1.6.3	The power button seems faint , but still lit .	St
1.6.4	I can have the pc off all night , turn it on in the morning , and it still does n't work .	St
1.6.5	Turn it off , run some errands , turn it on , works for hours before it goes out .	St
1.6.6	For some reason I was thinking it was a power issue , but not sure .	St
1.6.7	I bought a used CRT today and it 's working fine .	St
1.6.8	It 's the size of my car , but it works great .	St
1.7.1	The same thing happened to my 15 & quot ; MAG LCD .	St
1.7.2	It is not the Power Supply ; it is rather the Backlight Inverter Module to blame ( see picture linked below ) .	St
1.7.3	On my Inverter board one of the high voltage transformers shorted out and the backlight would turn on for two seconds , slightly dimmer than usual , and then will go off .	St
1.7.4	A skilled technician may fix the module on the component level if you find exact replacement miniature HV transformer ( good luck with that !	St
1.7.5	) , or you may simply buy replacement inverter board for about seventy bucks a pop .	St
1.7.6	It may not be worth to repair since LCD monitors are cheap these days .	St
1.7.7	Here 's a link with picture of the inverter board : http : //www.lcdpart.com/Products/qpwbgl9931dldmss.html I 'm not affiliated in any way with the above , just posting what I found out .	St
1.8.1	On the 1703 , such a problem is commonly caused by poorly soldered toroidal coils on the inverter board .	St
1.8.2	My sister had the same monitor and problem , and I fixed it by popping it open and re-soldering the four toroidal coils .	St
1.8.3	A guide on how to do this , if you are so inclined , can be found here : http : //www.lesliewong.us/blog/2005/05/02/hp-pavilion-f1703-flat-panel-display-blackout-solution/	Ques
1.9.1	I 'm now having the same trouble with a Sceptre LCD monitor and also the built-in CRT screen of an old iMac .	St
1.9.2	The difference with the CRT being that it stays dim for all but a fraction of a second while it 's being powered on .	St
1.9.3	It appears from the response that I got from Sceptre and the identical response others got from their monitor manufacturers - that they fully expect their LCDs to have this problem after the ( very short ) warranty expires .	St
1.9.4	That attitude and the fact that they keep it secret from us is frankly , crappy .	St
1.9.5	While LCDs are more affordable than they were before , I would n't call them affordable.. and certainly not so if we 're expected to buy a new one every 2 years .	St
1.9.6	That 's ludicrous !	St
1.9.7	The way they 're & quot ; breaking & quot ; is particularly upsetting and so is the cost of repair .	St
1.9.8	If something breaks , I do n't expect it to flicker in and out of proper operation.. and I should n't expect the cost of repair to approach what it would cost to replace it !	St
1.9.9	What are they thinking ?	Ques
1.9.10	That we 're just made of money and we 're fine with throwing away complex electronics that are 90 % operational after a year of use ?	Ques
1.9.11	WTF ! ?	Ques
1.9.12	I am quite angry about this.. particularly so since my second screen ( previously mentioned ) just got worse .	St
1.9.13	It previously was only going black when I 'd have it off then turn it on again .	St
1.9.14	This time it 's been on the whole time.. then went blank with no interaction from me .	St
1.9.15	I 'm very disappointed .	Polite
