1.1.1	Hi everyone.. Is there a software where I can put two IP adresses and monitor a real time throughput between 2 devices..	St
1.1.2	Thanks in advance Meshari..	St
1.2.1	Real time monitoring requires hardware in one form or another .	St
1.2.2	You need some device to analyze the data .	St
1.2.3	Commercial routers have some ability to provide data but normally you need a add on tool .	St
1.2.4	Most these are in a class of tools meant to monitor networks and cost more than most cars .	St
1.2.5	If you are looking for a commercial solution Netscout has a lot of nice boxes that do this but priced toward large companies .	St
1.2.6	To do this on the cheap your best bet is to use a free tool called wireshark .	St
1.2.7	If you can load this on one of the end machines you can get some basic reports .	St
1.2.8	If you do not have access the end machines then you will have to have hardware .	St
1.2.9	The minimum you will need is a PC to again run wireshark and a way to tap the circuit .	St
1.2.10	The method to tap the circuit could be as simple as a switch that has the ability to replicate & quot ; mirror & quot ; data second port up to commercial taps that you clamp onto fiber .	St
1.2.11	Now if you control both end devices and want to simulate thought put and test network capacity a very simple free command line tool that has been around for years called IPERF works very well .	St
1.2.12	This is a active testing tool and not a monitoring tool .	St
1.3.1	Thank you bill for the fast rsponse..	St
1.3.2	I used & quot ; iperf & quot ; and as u said it works very well , but the problem with this tool is that it does n't give u a real time calcualtion .	St
1.3.3	I want u to know that I have full control for both ends .	St
1.3.4	Knowing this , will wireshark be able to provide me with a real time throughput calculation ?	Ques
1.3.5	Thank u again 4 your help..	St
1.4.1	To a point it will .	St
1.4.2	It has a number of reports that will work against the open collection buffer .	St
1.4.3	Simple I/O rate graph seem ok. You can build filters for each address pair and graph I think up to 5 at the same time .	St
1.4.4	If you work at you could graph different protocols as well as IP addresses .	St
1.4.5	The issue with using wireshark as a live protocol analyzer is that it really a packet capture tool designed to look at data after it is captured .	St
1.4.6	The only live data it can look at is in the capture buffer .	St
1.4.7	Although the size of this buffer can be made large when you capture on path that has a lot of traffic the buffer will wrap over itself and if you make the buffer too large you will bog the machine down .	St
1.4.8	The method I use is to let it capture for a few minutes to a file and then stop and look at the file .	St
1.4.9	Although not real time the more advanced reports are more accurate .	St
1.4.10	The reports that show jitter in VoIP calls only seem to work on non live data .	St
1.4.11	On paths that are running huge amounts of data I use 2 machines .	St
1.4.12	One to capture the data since it can do little else and another to look at the data .	St
1.4.13	You can set wireshark to write the data to files at a set interval of set byte count .	St
1.4.14	I share the drive it writes to and open the files using another copy of wireshark .	St
1.4.15	Not truly live data but only a couple minutes old .	St
1.5.1	http : //www.hootech.com/NetMeter/ is one idea .	St
1.6.1	I will try these two softwares and I 'll give you my feedback..	St
1.6.2	Thanks a lot to both of you..	St
