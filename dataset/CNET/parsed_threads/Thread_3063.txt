<s> My Compaq Presario 5BWN21 desktop PC has been having problems with the CD-RW drive. </s>
<s> Last night I had to go inside of the tower to look at the hard drive, which means in my case, I had to remove the CD-RW drive. </s>
<s> Anyway, i got the computer back together and everything was fine except for the CD-RW drive. </s>
<s> All of the cables are hooked up, and it blinks and lights up at startup, but Windows 98Se dosen't detect it. </s>
<s> I went under the System Icon and checked the device maganger and it dosen't list it. </s>
<s> However, it does list my other CD-ROM drive. </s>
<s> I contacted Compaq and they told me to boot into safe mode and uninstall the drivers there. </s>
<s> I tried to do that; the computer will not let me boot into saft mode; however, when I woke up this morning, it let me boot into safe mode. </s>
<s> Then everything started to work; I got the thing to work, then the computer froze and I had to restart; once again, it wouldn't let me boot into safe mode. </s>
<s> I contacted Compaq again, they told me to make a Win 98 Bootable Diskette so I could restore the computer to an earlier time; i did that. </s>
<s> Still wouldn't let me boot into Safe Mode. </s>
<s> Anyway, please help me!!! </s>
<s> I just want the computer to get into safe mode. </s>
<s> The computer: Compaq Presario 5BWN21, Windows 98 SE, 128MB RAM, 20GB Hard Drive, LG CED-8080B CD-RW drive. </s>
<s> I looked at that model number and it debued in 2000 and seems to last shipped in 2000. </s>
<s> That's a 4 plus year old drive. </s>
<s> Cut your time loss NOW. </s>
<s> Try another drive. </s>

<s> The only problem is that is my mothers computer, and she said that she isn't going to buy a CD-RW drive. </s>
<s> Were going to get a new computer in a couple of months anyway, I just want to get the drive working, can you help me? </s>
<s> If the drive is dead, then how can I help you? </s>
<s> If the machine has two CD drives, have a friend make a KNOPPIX CD and test the drive with K3b. </s>
<s> What more help can you get? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The drive isn't dead, it just isn't being detected by Windows. </s>
<s> It blinks and lights up, and will even let you put a CD in it, but it isn't being detected by Windows. </s>
<s> If you didn't plug in the CDRW drive wide IDE cable proper (both ends) then what you write will happen. </s>
<s> Does the BIOS see the Drive? </s>
<s> Does a DOS boot diskette show the drive? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After sitting for and hour, the computer let me boot into Safe Mode. </s>
<s> It boots up, let me uninstall the drive, and I thought it would work, however, it didn't reinstall the drive when I booted into Windows. </s>
<s> Here is the answer to you questions: 1. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> That is how I knew the drive model, make, etc. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I don't remember if it did. </s>
<s> I don't think it did. </s>
<s> I might just wait to get the thing fixed when we get a new computer. </s>
