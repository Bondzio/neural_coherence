Xeno, tell me something, did you lower the brightness down and the contrast?
what are your settings?
I also noticed then when the screen is set to 100% black, there is some light bleeding from the background around the edges, do you have the same problem too?
what about video playback?
on mine when I played my Seinfeld DVD it looked all grainy.
Does your do the same thing as well?
Now, don't get me wrong, I really find this monitor way above average, but this is my first LCD, so that is I am being a bit more critical about it.
Thanks for your reply.
