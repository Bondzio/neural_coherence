Hi Bob, The router is definitely getting on a bit now - maybe 6 or 7 years old.
I can still access it from the wired PC and it seems to be working OK for the most part.
I realise I probably need to upgrade now anyway - I was just hoping to get maybe another year out of it...
I'm thinking that the fact that there are so many other networks in the neighbourhood is a strong contender for the problem.
I see lot of WPA and WPA2 networks floating around, which means their gear is a lot newer than ours and therefore (?)
probably stronger signal...
It just seems a weird coincidence that everything went pear-shaped at around the time of the two items mentioned in my first post happened...
