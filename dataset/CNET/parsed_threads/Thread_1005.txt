<s> My wife's computer has been hanging up lately (and frequently). </s>
<s> I've checked the usual possibilities (cpu temp. </s>
<s> too high, viruses, ...) but one flag has been raised. </s>
<s> The +3.3v has exceeded the normal range, running about +3.8 to +3.9. </s>
<s> Is there a problem with to much juice? </s>
<s> absolutely nothing about the motherboard make, model, etc. </s>
<s> Here's what I use -&gt; http://www.shopwiki.com/detail/?q=Fluke+83-5+V+Digital+Multimeter&s=438343&o=98223252&d=Fluke+83+V+Industrial+DMM+Digital+Multimeters The reason I ask is that you might be using the BIOS or other such internal measurements which are usually inaccurate. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the 3.3v spec allows a maximum deviation from 3.47v to 3.14v. </s>
<s> the 3.3v output powers the cpu and over/under volting will cause stability problems (hangs, shutdowns, &quot;blue screens&quot;, etc.). </s>
<s> excessive over/undervolting (like you describe) can damage the motherboard, cpu, and memory. </s>
<s> when it comes to power and temp readings, the bios is the gospel because the motherboard manufacturer bases its warranty on those values and has designed the behavior of the bios on those values. </s>
<s> if the bios says the 3.3v is 3.8v (which is too high), then the voltage being feed is too high for that motherboard to handle regardless of what the &quot;true&quot; 3.3v value is. </s>
<s> Lucky me. </s>
<s> I have a nice office with what I'm discovering, high tech gear like volt meters and oscilloscopes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you, that's what I thought. </s>
<s> I'm sorry that I didn't mention specs for the computer, I thought this was more of a generic question. </s>
<s> In case it is not, the motherboard is an ASUS A7N8X 2.0 ver. </s>
<s> w/AMD Athlon XP 2700 and 1 gig of memory. </s>
<s> ATI AIW 9600 and Window XP Pro SP2 OS. </s>
<s> The temp./volt. </s>
<s> is determined by ASUS Probe. </s>
<s> My other concern is the temps. </s>
<s> CPU is 145 F and MB is 87 F (room temp is 70). </s>
<s> What is the proper temp. </s>
<s> range or is that MB dependent? </s>
<s> temps are cpu 'family' dependent. </s>
<s> temps from the cpu are actually deltas against a fixed temp, but the fixed temp changes for each family. </s>
<s> since you're using the asus provided utility for your mobo, those temps are probably fairly accurate. </s>
<s> the ambient case temp should be no more than 30F/15C more than the room temp. </s>
<s> the max temp for an athlon xp 2200 or higher is 185F/85C but 158F/70C is better target. </s>
<s> if that 145F/62C reading occurs when the cpu is under full load, then it's not a problem, but if that reading occurs when the cpu is idle then the cpu is running hot. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
