1.1.1	I am going to buy a new pc in a couple of months .	St
1.1.2	My old pc is just that ... old , and I want more speed and capabilities .	St
1.1.3	I have a 2001 custom built pc with Athlon 850Mhz , 384 Rams with millions of unknown stuff that makes it slow .	St
1.1.4	I am going to purchase a Dell , however , how do I know WHICH Dell to purchase .	St
1.1.5	I am a machinist and constantly use CAD-style programs , however , my wife is a type of 'gamer ' I can affored to spend $ 2500 , but I want 'top notch ' ( or as close to it as possible ) speed , excellent CAD software capability , and the 'gamer ' potential all in one !	St
1.1.6	Ideas ? ... Dimension , Inspiron ? ... help me please .	Ques
1.2.1	I would not recommend a Dell because of lack of customer support .	St
1.2.2	Tech support is based in India .	St
1.2.3	Do n't get me wrong they build good systems .	St
1.2.4	They are not necessarily best value for the money .	St
1.2.5	Personally I would shop around .	St
1.2.6	& quot ; The new Dimension XPS Gen4 XPS case is the most expandable Dimension chassis offered .	St
1.2.7	It supports up to three 400GB hard drives , two PCI Express slots and three 5.25-inch drive bays for the highest levels of scalability with a cooling design that runs quietly & quot ; .	St
1.2.8	Prices currently starting at $ 1,999 Ships 1/20/2005 Here is a link for the XPS .	St
1.2.9	http : //www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/dimen_xps4 ? c=us & cs=19 & l=en & s=dhs	St
1.3.1	I have to agree with rwils51 and say DO N'T GET A DELL !	St
1.3.2	You 'll be sorry .	Polite
1.3.3	Dell used to be good , & probably had some of the BEST tech support out there .	St
1.3.4	That was then .	St
1.3.5	The machines seem to be well built , but I 've noticed the quality go down over the years .	St
1.3.6	We have 3 Dell 's , all Dimensions , a 8400 , 4400 , & 2300 .	St
1.3.7	Like rwils51 says , Dell 's tech support is NOW based in India , not that it 's what makes them bad , but they lack the knowledge that the old tech support had .	St
1.3.8	The people in India are book readers & when they ca n't find your issue , they tell you to & quot ; REFORMAT THE HARD DRIVE ! & quot ; The supervisors are no better either .	St
1.3.9	Then , you ca n't understand what they 're saying most of the time , and they ca n't understand you .	St
1.3.10	Within a month , I was sent a new HD for the 8400 , and it took about 10 months for the 4400 's HD to go south .	St
1.3.11	At 1st , the tech support was in Texas I believe , & they were VERY knowledgable people , then it became half & half between the US & India .	St
1.3.12	The tech 's in the US were n't aware of being replaced either .	St
1.3.13	When I mentioned I talked to some guy in India , the one tech freaked .	St
1.3.14	I have since become a God when it comes to Reformatting the HD .	St
1.3.15	Have a local place build you a machine , you 'll be much happier .	St
1.3.16	Oh , then there 's the issue of compatibility of extras you might want to install .	St
1.3.17	I just found that out as I now have a DVD paperweight .	St
1.3.18	: (	St
