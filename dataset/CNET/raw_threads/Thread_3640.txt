I assumed that my computer would have a resolution to cope with widescreen but of course no; that would be too easy! I really don't want to have to buy a new graphics card so is there any software I can download to correct the stretched images? I think my graphics card is built into the motherboard and don't know how to find out if it isn't? I looked under the Device Manager but there's nothing too obvious that is a graphics card? Any ideas? Thanks in advance everyone! Sunny

Just like http://techreport.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=713581&sid=4a1b45b108645ba9e0c333966c9d6ea0 you need to do that step and maybe head off to the display properties to tell it which monitor you are using.
