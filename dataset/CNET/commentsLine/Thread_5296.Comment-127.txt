first of all, check if the video/graphics chipset onto the mainboard of such hp machine has an integraded graphics processor with a fan hooked onto it and an fsb of at least 800mhz(1600 or 2200mhz preferable).
second, make sure it comes with a minimum of 3-4mb of ram cards + that both cards are dual channel synchronized perfectly(both the same speed).
third, the bad news is, too cheap lands you a complete dud of a machine.
especially via hewlett-packard u.s.a. or even canada.
hint: good games will, need, a 512mb video chipset with a really reliable graphics processor to back it up.
plus, having the graphics processor = complete and undeniable dedication to video/graphics rendition of both video clips/movies and gaming.
a 500$ machine through hp will land you a dud.
look somewhere else for much better.
good luck at choosing the next big upgrade!
