1.2.1	so ca n't offer much more than how I set it up .	St
1.2.2	I turned off system restore monitoring of the drive , set the drive letter manually , and use automatic caching .	St
1.2.3	I set permissions to read and change but not full control .	St
1.2.4	I can power off/on and the drive letter remains as does sharing .	St
1.2.5	My BIOS knows the drive by manufacturer and model just as if it was connected to the MB for what that 's worth .	St
1.2.6	Maybe , for some reason , Windows does n't see it as the same drive each time you restart .	St

1.4.3	I 'm not sure if it makes a difference .	St
1.4.4	I know that if I unplug a drive and use another USB port for it , Windows sees it as a new drive and gives it a different drive letter .	St
1.4.5	It also turns on system restore for that drive by default .	St
1.4.6	I ca n't figure why it thinks its a new drive .	St
1.4.7	Does your BIOS ID the drive ?	Ques
1.4.8	If not , I would wonder if Windows forgets it saw it once and shuts off sharing .	St
1.5.1	the settings option in the system restore tab .	St
1.5.2	Have n't tried looking in the BIOS .	St
1.5.3	Will do it now .	St
1.6.1	and see if shows by model or if generic .	St
1.6.2	Mine shows full model # .	St
1.7.1	Device Manager only shows USB mass storage device .	St
1.7.2	And this IBM BIOS does not list the drive .	St
1.7.3	That may be part of the problem , this is an IBM ThinkCentre .	St
1.7.4	Built for business & quot ; stuff & quot ; .	St
1.7.5	It 's powerful , P-4 3 GHz Hyper thread ( dual processor ) with a Gig of RAM .	St

1.8.1	under USB devices somewhere not have it default to auto with each restart .	St
1.8.2	I 've forgotten the process but I had to halt during POST and go USB device setting and restart until the drives appeared by model # .	St
1.8.3	I exited and saved the settings .	St
1.8.4	I also can allow more time for USB devices to present themselves .	St
1.8.5	I had to add a few seconds for one of my drives that was a bit slow to spin up .	St
1.8.6	You might see what options you have in your BIOS to remedy this .	St
