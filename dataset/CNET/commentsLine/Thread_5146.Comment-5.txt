try the last 50 packs of dvd-r or dvd+r i picked out at a midnight madness sale.
try $11.75 for 50. while it can't beat officemax's 200 cd pack they offered for zero bucks after rebate which you still paid tax and mailing fees so that was about 4 bucks, i can see that per gigabyte, the prices are on par with cdr.
