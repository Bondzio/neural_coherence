from what i see, that syste is still a good system.
before you go out and buy a nw mother board, i would try a bare bones setup.
you may have a pci card malfunctioning.
also, you power supply may be the culprit.
so i would try to boot it up with bare bones and a pata drive.
and for good measure, try with another power supply.
and it may just be as easy as your heat sink not being attached correctly, so check that first!
