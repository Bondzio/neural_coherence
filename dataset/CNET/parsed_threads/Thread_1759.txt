<s> Hi all after a little help here, i Have a MSI K9N2GM MOTHERBOARD ONE DAY WHILE TURNING THE SYSTEM ON VIA THE POWER UNIT POWER SWITCH AT REAR IT CRACKLED AND THEN THE SYSTEM WOULDN'T TURN ON. </s>
<s> THE LIGHT ON THE POWER UNIT WOULDN'T ILLUMINATE AND THE FANS FAILED TO START. </s>
<s> AS SUCH I WAS UNABLE TO TEST ANY OF THE SYSTEMS. </s>
<s> NOTE THAT THE POWER UNIT WAS CHECKED AND CONFIRMED FAULTY HOWEVER WHEN I CONNECTED THE NEW ONE UP THERE WAS NO POWER LIGHT ON THE BOARD. </s>
<s> POWER UNIT WAS GOOD QUALITY 'OZ' ONE WITH SEVERAL SAFEGUARDS SO IM UNSURE WHERE TO GO FROM HERE ANY IDEAS WHAT TO TRY NEXT ? </s>
<s> IM HOPING THE 9850 PHENOM QUADCORE BLACK EDITION & 2 x 2gb 800mhz ddr2 ram ARE STILL ALIVE ! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Its important the replacement PSU is as capable as old one was or even better, wattage wise. </s>
<s> Of course all connections MUST be done and in proper place. </s>
<s> If this has been done and it still refuses to work, you have a secondary problem. </s>
<s> When the PSU failed it *may have* taken down another device/component and refuses to boot or power-ON. </s>
<s> If HD or CD dreive, etc., replace and hope it continues to work. </s>
<s> However, if the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is zapped, then consider another to replace it. </s>
<s> In most cases, fixing the mtrbd. </s>
<s> won't be practical or becomes troublesome as time goes on, of course this depends on your repair abilities. </s>
<s> If so, eliminate any device/compotent before installing on new mtrbd.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> thanks for the info there im just wondering if it will have damaged the cpu or ram. </s>
<s> replacing the MB aint to much of a problem just worried about buying a new baord then having to do the CPU and possibly ram </s>
<s> Remove *everything* on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> leave only the spkr. </s>
<s> attached. </s>
<s> and assure the PSU is connected. </s>
<s> Power-ON, it should beep away in some form or fashion. </s>
<s> If it doesn't then the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is truly gone. </s>
<s> If it does beep, then return the cpu and HSF, remount and test, it should still beep but in some pattern. </s>
<s> Connect video and so on, one item at a time and test each time for results and the beep pattern. </s>
<s> The bios beep code will determine if or anything is related to missing device, etc., but it may not and that could be the problem area. </s>
<s> If possible, test other devices elsewhere to verify them. </s>
<s> Also, take the time when everything is missing, to inspect closely the mtrbd. </s>
<s> for blown, bulging, etc. </s>
<s> &quot;bad caps&quot;, google for examples. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Have you checked ram? </s>
<s> Sometimes this problem creates because of RAM. </s>
