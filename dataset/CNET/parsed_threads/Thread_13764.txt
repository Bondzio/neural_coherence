<s> I have an ASUS mb with a Promise PCI RAID controller connected to two WD1200 using RAID 1. </s>
<s> The BIOS on the RAID controller is FastTrack TX2000. </s>
<s> When I use a Windows XP setup CD to boot, it loads a bunch of drivers and invites me to install Windows XP. </s>
<s> Then it says that it can't find a hard drive and invites me to reboot. </s>
<s> What should I try? </s>
<s> Microsoft doesn't have the needed drivers on their CD. </s>
<s> I'd recheck the install instructions from Promise to see if you need to press a F6 or other key during install to slip in some diskette with drivers. </s>
<s> You'll also run into this with non-Intel chipsets. </s>
<s> Again an expert's only type install with drivers on diskettes at the right steps. </s>
<s> Just FYI. </s>
<s> There is no step by step instructions that match your hardware (unless you are very lucky.) </s>
<s> I only find GUIDES. </s>
<s> In closing, another issue is you have only &quot;XP&quot;. </s>
<s> XP without the integrated SP1 or SP2 does have disk size limits that could also be at issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have many Promise HDD/RAID controllers, including the FastTrack TX2000. </s>
<s> R. Proffitt is correct: you have to install the driver early in the XP installation process. </s>
<s> Before you copy the drivers to a floppy, don't forget to extract the files form the zipped archive after you download them. </s>
