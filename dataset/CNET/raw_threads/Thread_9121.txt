I recently bought a i7 920 2.67Ghz wt 3 GB of ram, 64 bit operating system wt win Vista Ultimate. It's a sweet computer but when I connect my HDMI out to the Panasonic Vierra TV, I only get video. I know the 2 HDMI channels work on the tv. Used DVD , Blueray and all types of receivers on them. I was hoping to get help for my PC issue so that I can get Audio Thank you

For example when I use HDMI I have to dive into WMP's settings to tell it to send audio to HDMI. Sorry I don't have that screen shot today but here's one I have handy -&gt; http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=WMP_Speaker_NOT.jpg BluRay is not natively played by Vista. You have to reveal the software's name if there is any hope of sharing a picture of where this setting is. Bob
