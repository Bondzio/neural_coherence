But everytime I try and do so the keyboard freezes up and I can't choose any of the options. I was told to try a PS keyboard instead of a USB port keyboard but there isnt an outlet in the back for this type of keyboard. So I tryed a converter but that isn't working either. The computer is a Dell Dimension E521. Please help ..

I NEVER BOOTED THAT HARD DISK IN ANOTHER MACHINE (very important!) Put the hard disk back into the original machine and I was done. Sorry to hear your machine needs repair. Did you call Dell while it was in warranty to have them correct this error? Bob
