for example the host pc make, model, where connected.
so here it is, some front usb ports fall back to usb 1.0 speed and while it is well discussed why, after years i found one person to fix it.
this means my advice is to use the rear ports.
but without make and model, how can i give that advice?
about fedora.
nice but i'd try ubuntu next.
i find its hardware support to be a little better.
