<s> I installed a program called SpeedFan 4.32 just to check my computer temperature. </s>
<s> When I installed it and it first ran, the temps were: CPU 51c Ambient 37c HD0 41c HD1 39c When I turned the computer off for the night and restarted it, the temps were: CPU 42c Ambient 23c HD0 20c HD1 19C I let the computer on while I was out today and when I returned, all the fans were running in the computer Normally, the computer is almost silent. </s>
<s> With the fans running, the temps were: CPU 38c Ambient 28c HD0 32c HD1 31C Should all of the fans be running 100% and is it possible that I lost a hard drive because it overheated? </s>
<s> The temps look normal, very normal. </s>
<s> Without speedfan the fans do a fair job. </s>
<s> Running speedfan enables the fans to 100% and the machine is cooler. </s>
<s> But don't put too much stock in those temp sensors. </s>
<s> I get two different temps when comparing SpeedFan to Everest. </s>
<s> Just looking at the numbers, your machine and drives are well below any danger zone. </s>
<s> If you lost a drive it's not because of temperature. </s>
<s> HD a few months ago, and now I am only guessing that it may have been heat related. </s>
<s> Should I let SpeedFan control the fans and let them run? </s>
<s> What is the best way to get the correct temps? </s>
<s> and it will automatically adjust your fans to maintain those temps. </s>
<s> if you like quiet, raise the temps. </s>
<s> cpu 50c, ambient 35c, and hd 35c should make for a quiet pc and reasonably cool temps. </s>
<s> If you maintain your system cleaning and just use it as a typical one, the monitoring fan pgms. </s>
<s> just report and really don't do much. </s>
<s> More often than not, you will get various different status reports, as long as they don't goto to extremes, you're OK. </s>
<s> If you run a system more into extremes like gaming or intense usage, then *maybe* the more intelligent fan monitoring pgms. </s>
<s> can help but even then I thought very much. </s>
<s> If anything an alarm is the best setting to use to get your attention, but typical bios setting do that anyways. </s>
<s> The monitoring pgms. </s>
<s> won't do anything but report if you don't use variable fans that can vary their RPM s, so take that into account. </s>
<s> Alas, having good quality fans and large ones if possible help to reduce noise and/or reduce fan failure. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The temps looked good before you installed SpeedFan. </s>
<s> I'd uninstall SpeedFan. </s>
<s> The temps are really on the low side which is good. </s>
<s> I doubt if the failure was heat related. </s>
<s> I always thought my computer was very quiet (too quiet perhaps)when I bought it. </s>
<s> I don't know why the HD failed or really if it were the HD that failed. </s>
<s> But since replacing it, the system seems to be fine </s>
<s> I just want to know what HD1 stand for because my HD1 temp allot higher than my HD0? </s>
<s> Plz reply </s>
