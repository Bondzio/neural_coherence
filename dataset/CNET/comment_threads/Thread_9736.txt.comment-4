It's not the plastic keys but what's underneath them.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard Typically, the ones you use most go first.
You're flexing the domes on the top layer of the keyboard.
They're supposed to pop back into position but they get weaker with age and use.
Eventually they don't return to proper shape and the electrical contacts stay closed...or open...whatever the case may be.
You don't fix these but you replace them.
You can get very good keyboards made for heavy use.
If you're interested, you can try those made in Germany by Cherry.
I've got one...very nice but has a feel that some won't like.
