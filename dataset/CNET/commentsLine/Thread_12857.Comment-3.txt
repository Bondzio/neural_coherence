hi rp, resetting the network password/security key was costly and time consuming.
i had to pay some guy from india (linksys) 30 bucks to walk me through it.
i do not remember how to do it.
is it easier than i remember, or do you know how to do it in such a way that i would not have to revist mumbai?
