<s> I have a new Dell Latitude which replaced an older dell latitude. </s>
<s> My old dell had no problems connecting wirelessly to my router. </s>
<s> The new one connects then a few minutes later locks up the router. </s>
<s> I have to reboot the router for it to start working again. </s>
<s> Its using windows xp professionl service pack 2. </s>
<s> If I plug into the wired connection it works fine. </s>
<s> It also connects fine wirelessly at work. </s>
<s> Any Ideas? </s>
<s> But is this setup per our forum sticky? </s>
<s> If not there are some machines that won't stay connected due to drivers. </s>
<s> But I've seen owners that can't work the issue and won't go with what works and lose many months trying to get it fixed. </s>
<s> Let's share those router settings and try it per our forum sticky. </s>

<s> I initially tried to update the firmware on my router but was using the wrong file. </s>
<s> I downloaded and installed the correct file and it worked like a champ. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I am having exactly the same problem with a used Dell Latitude I just purchased. </s>
<s> I can connect to my network at home but when I try to connect here at work the Laptop sees the network, says I have excellent signal strength but limited or no connectivity. </s>
<s> When I try to repair the connection the laptop is unable to acquire a new IP. </s>
<s> The router is a linxsys WAP54g. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> I find used machines often need the OS reloaded according to the maker's instructions. </s>
<s> Try that! </s>
