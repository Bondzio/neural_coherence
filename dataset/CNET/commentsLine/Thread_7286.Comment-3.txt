i totally forgot about this post.
i thought that it would automatically track it.
anyway, i contacted sony's online live service which is kind strange, after all, i bought that one at least 2 years ago.
they still provide free online live service.
anyway, that guy told me to reinstall the program that came with the dvd player.
i did that, nothing happened.
then he told me that he can't help.
i wasted quite a few hours on this sony product.
and i will never buy a sony product again.
i had a sony digital camera, it also had some problems.
this is not a brand that i trust.
no, nothing sticky got inside of it.
in the center, there is this circulr sticky thing on the bottom, if i leave a disc in there for too long, it will got stuck.
last time, i had to open up the comptuer and take it out myself.
