1.1.1	I 'm still using a CRT and I do n't think a typical LCD would give me a better image .	St
1.1.2	I 'm seeking some expert advice .	St
1.1.3	( 1 ) I do mechanical CAD , electronic CAD , spreadsheets , etc .	St
1.1.4	I do n't do gaming or videos .	St
1.1.5	( 2 ) I currently use a Dell M991 19 & quot ; monitor .	St
1.1.6	The recommended resolution is 1024x798 ( 3 ) I have my video board set for 1600x1200 .	St
1.1.7	( 4 ) I can see and read all the characters .	St
1.1.8	I can not detect any & quot ; stair stepping & quot ; on lines that are nearly horizontal or vertical .	St
1.1.9	I assume that , with a recommended resolution of 1024x798 , the shadow mask is of that resolution as are the color pixels .	St
1.1.10	But I gather the beam must split or scatter or whatever so that a 1600x1200 image is satisfactorily rendered on the screen .	St
1.1.11	Please correct me if I am wrong ( if it is important to my understanding this ) .	Sug
1.1.12	If I were to connect a 1920x1080 LCD monitor , what would it display with the video set to 1600x1200 ?	Ques
1.1.13	Note , 1600x1200 is the highest resolution mode my board has and it does n't have a 1080 line mode .	St
1.1.14	Specifically , ( 1 ) Would the monitor try to stretch the horizontal 1600 pixels to 1920 using some kind of digital processing and pixel replication ?	Ques
1.1.15	( 2 ) Would it shrink the 1200 vertical to fit on the 1080 lines using digital processing to combine or delete some lines ?	Ques
1.1.16	( 3 ) If either of the above is true , do different manufacturers have better or worse processing ?	Ques
1.1.17	( 4 ) Would the overall effect be better than what I have now or worse ?	Ques
1.1.18	Also , regarding screen size .	Polite
1.1.19	I can see everything fine at the distance I am at now on my 19 & quot ; screen .	St
1.1.20	What good would be a 22 & quot ; or 24 & quot ; screen with the same 1920x1080 resolution ?	Ques
1.1.21	After all if it has the same number of pixels , all that happens is the pixels get larger .	St
1.1.22	But no more information will be presented is that right ?	Ques
1.1.23	So the only & quot ; gain & quot ; will be the ability to view it from further away , right ?	Ques
1.1.24	Thanks In Advance , Pete	St
1.2.1	You really did n't say much about the system you are using , OS hardware , etc .	St
1.2.2	so it is a bit hard to say what would function best .	St
1.2.3	IF you have a system that supports 1080p graphics then the LCD ( with 1080p capability ) would likely be a good way to go , hooking up via DVI or HDMI rather than VGA , again it would depend on hardware and system capabilities .	St
1.2.4	A little more info might help .	St
1.3.1	Overall , if your CRT broke , you 'll be left will little to replace it with .	St
1.3.2	CRT 's are history unless you seek a high-end model .	St
1.3.3	For those costs , the use of a basic LCD will do fine to include any so-called TV monitors types .	St
1.3.4	Switching to a decent LCD and having better abilities may seem nothing to gain , but then again once you leave 19in .	St
1.3.5	monitors , having a larger display may help in CAD setups .	St
1.3.6	The LCDs provides far greater display and that alone if you decide could be a good decision to go by .	St
1.3.7	You can review or decide by looking at LCDs on display at better office shops or Fry 's , Best Buy , etc. , to get an idea what 's available .	St
1.3.8	Reveiew the specs on newer LCDs to see what they offer .	St
1.3.9	Of course , now would be a good time to have a spare CRT , as those are practically given away , check Craigslist or GWill , Sal.Army sources .	St
1.3.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Hi Pete , I , too , was a late convert to LCD .	St
1.4.2	I could n't see how a filter/reflective technology like LCD could possibly produce a better image than a light emitter like a CRT .	St
1.4.3	In the early days of LCD , that was probably right but not now .	St
1.4.4	It 's somewhat unusual to find a 19 & quot ; CRT with a recommended resolution of 1024x768 ( 4x3 ) , most non-widescreens above 17 & quot ; are 5x4 ( 1280x1024 ) but there you go .	St
1.4.5	One attribute of CRTs you have already discovered is that you can change the resolution and still get a good sharp image .	St
1.4.6	Not so with LCDs - the optimal image is always produced at native resolution .	St
1.4.7	If you need a different size , bigger text for instance , change the dpi , not the screen resolution .	St
1.4.8	That has some implications for you , since your current graphics card does not support the typical native resolutions ( 1920x1080 ) on a medium size screen .	St
1.4.9	You should probably consider updating your graphics card to one that supports the native resolution of the screen you choose - always assuming you are using a desktop or workstation - it would be extremely difficult and certainly uneconomic to upgrade a laptop .	St
1.4.10	There are still a few 4x3 LCDs available , up to about 19 & quot ; but the native resolution will almost certainly be 1280x1024 , which is worse than you are getting with your CRT .	St
1.4.11	But most LCD screens nowadays are widescreen , either 16x9 or 16x10 format .	St
1.4.12	An LCD with a resolution less than its native resolution will produce an image that looks somewhat blurry , not ideal for CAD work , I would think .	St
1.4.13	How an LCD behaves when the resolution of the graphics card is set higher than its native resolution ( and with many , this is n't even possible ) will depend on the screen/graphics card/driver combination .	St
1.4.14	Results can vary from no image to scroll bars !	St
1.4.15	As to size , you are correct , in simple terms , for a given resolution , the bigger the screen , the bigger the pixels will be .	St
1.4.16	You can easily check this at your local TV store - look at a 60 & quot ; 1080p TV and a 32 & quot ; 1080p TV , the difference in pixel size will be obvious close up .	St
1.4.17	You could say ( you did ) that the bigger the screen , the further away you sit .	St
1.4.18	Might work for TVs but on a computer , you actually need to be closer to the screen to use the mouse and keyboard.So I prefer to look at it the other way round , the distance you need to sit away from the screen will dictate the size of the screen you need .	St
1.4.19	At a rough guess ( which could be wildly wrong ! )	St
1.4.20	if you are happy sitting at your current distance from your CRT , then you will probably be happy at the same distance from a 22-24 & quot ; LCD at a resolution of 1920x1080 but your mileage will vary .	St
1.4.21	If you like Dell equipment like your current screen , I 've seen some stunning images on a 24 & quot ; Dell Ultrasharp .	St
1.4.22	Willy hit the nail on the head - you need to go to your local computer store and spend some time looking at various screens .	St
1.4.23	View them from the distance you have decided you want to sit to determine the screen size you want .	St
1.4.24	Then compare the screens on offer at that size .	St
1.4.25	Ask the store rep if you can change the resolution to something else and see whether that is acceptable to you or whether you are happier at native resolution .	St
1.4.26	If you are then look to get a new graphics card to match , preferably DVI or HDMI .	St
1.4.27	You do n't say whether the screen is for work or a hobby - if work , then you will likely be sitting in front of this thing for up to 8 hours a day , so a few hours checking out possibilities is a great investment .	St
1.4.28	Screens are just about the most subjective component of any computer system - what I like might make you ill , or vice versa !	St
1.4.29	Good luck !	Polite
1.5.1	I suggest that instead of choosing an LCD with 1920 x 1080 resolution , you opt for one with 1920 x 1200 resolution .	St
1.5.2	Interestingly , the 24 & quot ; Dell Ultrasharp mentioned above is 1920 x 1200 with a 16:10 aspect ratio .	St
1.5.3	If it will display 1600 x 1200 without horizontal stretching , it would maintain your perfect 4:3 aspect ratio , still using its native resolution with no ugly interpolated pixels , albeit with black bars on both sides of the image .	St
1.5.4	As mentioned , you might want to find one ( or any other 1920 x 1200 monitor ) in a store and play with it to see how it behaves at your desired resolution .	St
1.5.5	You did n't mention what video card you 're using , but is it possible that it maybe it does support 1920 x 1080 and 1920 x 1200 already ?	Ques
1.5.6	At the risk of stating the obvious , & quot ; Windows display properties & quot ; will only offer the resolutions that the monitor itself will support .	St
1.5.7	In any case , as mentioned , if you can upgrade your video card , you might be even happier with the results .	St
1.5.8	By the way , with a CRT , the shadow mask generally does not correspond to any particular resolution .	St
1.5.9	The position of each phosphor dot does not correspond to an individual pixel at any resolution .	St
1.5.10	At useable resolutions , the dot pitch is finer than the resolution .	St
1.5.11	It 's possible that if the recommended resolution is 1024 x 768 , that you are approaching or even exceeding the dot pitch at 1600 x 1200 .	St
1.5.12	The image might be a little blurry and not really yielding the resolution that you think you 're getting .	St
1.5.13	Just for fun , try looking at your CRT under some magnification at different resolutions .	St
