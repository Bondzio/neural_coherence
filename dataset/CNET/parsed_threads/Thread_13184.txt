<s> I currently have 3 USB 2.0 hard drives 2x fantom 500gb and a 200gb Seagate in a vantec nexus enclosure. </s>
<s> The hard drives all work fine when plugged directly into the computer but i recently purchased a VANTEC UGT-MH401 usb hub and when all the drives are plugged in they are painfully slow. </s>
<s> for instance extracting a file with 7zip tops out at 400KB /s. </s>
<s> Is this the case with every hub i could purchase or is it a problem with this particular hub. </s>
<s> it advertises that it has &quot;Downstream ports have automatic connect and speed detection function plus over-current protection with auto-recovery&quot; which i am not sure if that would be a problem this is the product page http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817392005 on newegg. </s>
<s> any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Seen that. </s>
<s> Little to do but try another make and model. </s>
<s> My fix at home was to add a 4 port USB 2.0 PCI card. </s>
<s> That was same or as much money as your hub. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thats what i was thinking i bought the hub to souley to clean up the appearance of the front of my case. </s>
<s> also i got the hub because it is externally powered and doesn't suck power from my PSU i am not sure if it matters since the hardrives are externally powered themselves though. </s>
