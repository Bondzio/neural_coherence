<s> Hello Ibrahim, Thank you for the advice. </s>
<s> I think the speaker and cable have no problems because the same speaker I use for my laptop. </s>
<s> I have been trying to find out a solution by googling too but I found a lot of similar problems but their solution is not fix the problem. </s>
<s> Just I sent a mail to Realtek to get some help. </s>
<s> I do not know now whether it is a hardware problem or driver problem. </s>
<s> Watching movie is somewhat OK but the music, I cannot enjoy it, its very disturbing. </s>
<s> Regards, wildbird </s>
<s> It might be hardware. </s>
<s> Can you try a System Restore to a previous time? </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> I did system restore but it did not help. </s>
<s> I reinstalled the OS and all the softwares last week since then I have this problem. </s>
<s> Do you know what model your motherboard is, by any chance? </s>
<s> You can use this program to find out: http://www.cpuid.com/download/cpu-z-140.zip I'm going out on a limb here, but you don't have radios, cell phones, microwaves, etc.? </s>
<s> Try moving the speakers as far as you can from the computer and the monitor. </s>
<s> Any better? </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> The sound problem has been solved. </s>
<s> The computer's motherboard GA-K8NF-9 nForce4-4X chipset's manual audio driver is Realtek so I have installed. </s>
<s> VDO card is GeForce 660GT 128MB Memory. </s>
<s> I got two CDs the NVIDIA n Force4 series Utility CD and the WinFast 3D Graphics Series. </s>
<s> Last night I installed AGP Update+nVidia+nForce+nForce AMD since then Realtek AC97 has been replaced by NVIDIA(R) nForce (TM) Audio Codec Interface and then the problem has gone. </s>
<s> As well as i lost the &quot;Sound Effect&quot; so I do not have feature for Jack-Sensing for audio connectors error-detecting function. </s>
<s> The sound is pretty good and satisfactory but I do not know which driver is the right driver of the hardware of the machine, Realtk or Nvidia. </s>
<s> Regards, Wildbird </s>
<s> Well, I'm glad it is solved. </s>
<s> I actually didn't know nVidia made sound drivers, weird! </s>
<s> I'm pretty certain Realtek drivers are the correct ones, but if they are working OK with nVidia, I wouldn't mess with them. </s>
<s> Good job! </s>
