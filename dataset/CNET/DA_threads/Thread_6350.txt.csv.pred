1.1.1	I have three computers that have been networked through a Linksys 5-port ethernet hub .	St
1.1.2	We are in a rural area and use dial-up for our internet .	St
1.1.3	I had the internet connection on an older Dell Dimension 2350 but when the modem went out switched the connection to our Dell Latitude D830 notebook computer .	St
1.1.4	When I had to leave for a couple of weeks and took the notebook computer with me , my son connected to the internet using the modem in his ancient HP Pavilion .	St
1.1.5	Everything was working before I left all computers could access the internet and see files/folders/share printers .	St
1.1.6	Since I returned and hooked the notebook back into the network , the two desktop computers can see the internet is active on the notebook but can not send/receive email , view web pages etc .	St
1.1.7	File/folder/printer sharing is working between all the computers .	St
1.1.8	All three computers are running Windows XP Home SP 3 .	St
1.1.9	Any troubleshooting tips you can share would be appreciated .	St
1.2.1	Are you using ICS or some sort of router that works with dial-up to share the connection ?	Ques
1.2.2	If ICS , I believe the host PC needs to be using 192.168.0.1 or something similar and , of course ICS would need to be enabled on one networked machine only .	St
1.3.1	By ICS Im assuming you mean Internet Connection Sharing .	St
1.3.2	If so , yes , I am using ICS - have re-run the Network Setup Wizard several times , making sure all the settings are correct ( workgroup name is all the same , etc . )	St
1.3.3	The IP address of the notebook ( host ) computer is 192.168.0.1 ICS is enabled only on the notebook ( host ) computer .	St
1.3.4	Is there a way to test the hub to see if it has gone bad ?	Ques
1.3.5	I tried to ping the other computers and the request timed out	St
