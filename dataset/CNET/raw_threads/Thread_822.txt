When I copy a bunch of files to it, Windows tells me that I am writing at about 1 MB/sec (capital B). This isn't too bad, and the read speed seems to be very good, but my friend has a Western Digital NAS that is doing 35 MB/sec. Anybody know where I should poke around to improve read/write speed? I'm connecting to it wirelessly, but so was he.. Thanks a ton, Brian

Still, it works well. Thanks, Brian
