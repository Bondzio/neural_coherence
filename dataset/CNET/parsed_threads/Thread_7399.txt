<s> Hello, Appreciate if someone could help me with a wireless connection question. </s>
<s> I am going on vacation in 2 weeks and there is only 1 place on the island that offers wireless internet access. </s>
<s> I have heard that it is possible to buy a wireless card that I can plug into my laptop in order to receive wireless access w/o having to go to the wifi hotspot. </s>
<s> (Would love to be able to catch up on work e-mails and participate in my fantasy draft without leaving the pool!) </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> If so any suggestions on the best product? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> far enough away from any wireless broadband provider where that service would not exist. </s>
<s> At best those services provide dial-up type speed, not worth the cost if you ask me. </s>
<s> Enjoy your vacation and take a break away from the Internet, that's what I'm gonna try to do in two weeks. </s>
