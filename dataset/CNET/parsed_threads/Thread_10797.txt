<s> Having problems with the CD/DVD Drive on my HP Media Center m7250n. </s>
<s> I was ripping CD's yesterday and after a break of a few hours, returned to the computer and had problems opening the drive and when I did, the CD was not being recognized. </s>
<s> Is there some solution to this or will it mean buying a new CD drive? </s>
<s> I'm not sure I can trust myself fitting a new drive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions, greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Drives today are fully plug-n-play. </s>
<s> It simply involves a screwdriver. </s>
<s> Power off the PC and open the case. </s>
<s> The drive will be readily accessible. </s>
<s> Locate the drive and find the connector cables. </s>
<s> Unplug the cables and use a screwdriver to remove the screws holding it in place. </s>
<s> Remove the drive. </s>
<s> Insert a new drive and do the above in reverse. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> Take note of the connector cables. </s>
<s> You'll get a new drive that matches the cables. </s>
<s> Will be a good idea to remove the old drive first and identify the type. </s>
