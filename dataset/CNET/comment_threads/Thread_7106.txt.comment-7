the dell printer have a little tab that prevent the ink holder from locking with a lexmark cartridge.
I cut off the tab and I am running with a lexmark cartridge just fine.
Its stupid cos the cartridges are all the same price (40 dollars CDN)...what a rip off...I am going to refill it.
They give you a good price on the printer but buy a couple of cartridges and you might as well have gone with something better.
My real problem is: The A960 I cant use as a standalone fax...some faxes just are completely received by the other side although the machine tells me its okay DELL SUX - LEXMARK SUX --- all a money grab --- no quality
