I allready have a wireless network setup. i wanted to know if I could bridge the internet connection from the wireless USB adaptor to the network card and then plug my Xbox into the network card.

The parts and such you noted are interesting but why would I not use an accepted and working solution? If you want to create a new setup, then go ahead but you will have to do it yourself since it is your creation. Bob
