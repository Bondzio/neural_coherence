MY question is that there is the gel between the cooling fan and the chip. I have read that it is to be removed or cleaned off. A website i visited said to use carborator cleaner to clean it off. Is this true? Does anybody know of a good site to help me with this job. I searched google but after reading about the guy saying to use carborator cleaner i want to be sure to get some known good information. Thanks.

AMD does make very good info movies, they can also be found on Tigerdirect.com all you have to do is go into the AMD processor section, click on any of them processor info tabs and then scrool to the bottom and there are the videos
