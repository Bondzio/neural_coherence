But I'm finding folk mis-diagnose the hibernate issue.
That is, some are looking at the monitor that is displaying a sleep message and thinking the PC is sleeping or hibernating which is not the case at all.
I find that a boot to safe mode and setting a compatible resolution can help if there are no other hardware issues.
That step is not in your post so maybe it's the usual.
