<s> I have a client thatis looking at color laser printers. </s>
<s> They will be producing some of there own brochures, the machine I am looking to suggest is an OKI C9300dxn. </s>
<s> It is an LED printer and I want to make sure it is capable of the quality they are looking for. </s>
<s> I have found little difference. </s>
<s> The only issue I've experienced is the costs at the 2 and 3 year mark may favor the HP color lasers, but if you are comparing same class (near in price) as this Okidata, then you won't find much difference. </s>
<s> But like ART, the beauty of each printout is in the eye of the beholder. </s>
<s> A tip I want to share is that I can skew what people think about each printer by using various &quot;brightness&quot; levels of paper. </s>
<s> If I want the best effects I go for 98 and higher bright paper. </s>
<s> If its some mass brochure work, then 94 is fine. </s>
<s> Below that and it's office gruel. </s>
