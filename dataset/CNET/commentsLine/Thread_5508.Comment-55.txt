i had this happen to me with a seagate.
turns out they released a bad firmware and shipped a bunch of drives from the factory with it.
the result is that, without warning, one day your drive would stop being recognized by windows, bios, anything.
there was no recall or anything, so there was no way of knowing the real problem.
i tried most of the solutions here, including the freezer 'trick' which i don't like due to moisture after you remove it.
my plan was (don;t know if it was mentioned here) was to get a clone drive (exact make/model, etc) and swap pcbs.
as i searched ebay with my make/model, i saw someone repairing only this model, which led me to more research.
eventually, i found a place buried on the seagate site with a phone number.
long story short, they sent me a shipping label, fixed (unlocked my firmware), installed new firmware, backed up my drive, and then returned my drive in working order...all free.
but the panic i endured during the process was payment enough.
i now back up everything on 2 drives and also burn backups to optical media as well.
its a lot cheaper than paying a company 2 grand to do a data extract to get all your children's pictures back... i
