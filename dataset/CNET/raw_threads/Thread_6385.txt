Anyways I made a pic of how I have it setup, so I was wondering is everything setup properly and will I get the best performance from how it is now? I have Vista Ultimate 64 if that matters.

(so DIMM_A1 and DIMM_B1 should be filled with a matched pair.) but so long as DIMM_A1+A2 have the same capacity as DIMM_B1+B2, dual channel will still be enabled. since your ram has different timings, the slowest timings (5-5-5-15) will be selected. you can try to manually set 4-4-4-15 timings, but the performance difference won't be noticeable except in benchmarks.

BUT, you have the similar(alike) ram together(next to each other) and that's NOT the way DDR2 mode was intended. You already note the colored slots. While it be working OK, to address your question, for the best performance all ram should be alike of same abilities, thus the same timing. I would think the ram auto-configured to the lowest setting and isn't in DDR2 mode -OR- if set in DDR2 its not happy, possible cause for concern if pushed. If you can replace the ram slower ram to the higher ram, then that will be a better fit. But, for now, if it works you'll be advised of this area of concern. tada -----Willy
