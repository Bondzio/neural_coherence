1.1.3	I tried to get google maps to use my location but it kept saying unable to determine location.	St
1.1.4	My phones screen is to small to see while driving the boat.	St
1.1.5	Is there anyway that I can get the nook tablet to show my phones screen kind of like how you can get your computer screen to show your cells screen?	St

1.1.11	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I'd move to some tablet with a GPS like the newer Google Nexus at http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7/specs You'll still need to preload maps and possibly enable the wifi hotspot on the phone.	St

1.3.1	I use an app called foxfi that lets me use the internet on the tablet	St
