faulty boards, outdated bios, too much diddling with settings, trying old ide 40 conductor cables, failing drives, drives fdisked on another machine, drives with odd custom partitions, tunafish in the power supply, worms, nachi worms, ms-blaster worms, kazaa, imesh, p2p programs in general, trojans, spyware, malware, badware and the list goes on for a very long time.
the clues you supply can narrow it down.
