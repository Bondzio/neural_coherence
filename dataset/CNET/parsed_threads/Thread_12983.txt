<s> I'm a very happy new user to the Hauppauge HD PVR ( http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html )... as I can now, finally make my own HD movie libraries of my Premium HD Content ! </s>
<s> The captured files are in the AVCHD format...and can be played back on my PS3, burn to DVD (in AVCHD format) for playback on Blueray players. </s>
