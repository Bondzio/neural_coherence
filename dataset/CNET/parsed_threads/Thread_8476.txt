<s> Hi if someone could help me i would gratly apprecite it. </s>
<s> Ive just bought a see thru case for my pc and need a cooler for my 2.7ghz celeron skt 478 cpu. </s>
<s> I bought a coolermaster DP-102 but it doesnt fit both fans due to the layout of my mobo, have tried it with 1 fan and my cpu runs at 65-75 degrees c (is this too hot ?). </s>
<s> I want to get this a lot cooler without using water cooling. </s>
<s> The heatsink also has to be attractive as i've spent a lot of money buying a see thru case, uv lighting, see thru psu, uv reative cables etc. </s>
<s> If you have any sugestions i would gratly appreciate this. </s>
<s> Thanks Paul </s>
<s> make sure the heatsink is mounted properly and the thermal pad/grease is applied properly. </s>
<s> i can't find any info on the coolermaster dp-102. </s>
<s> it's not on their site nor on newegg. </s>
<s> but this zalman unit will definitely keep your cpu under 60C and look cool doing it. </s>

<s> Reset my heatsink today and added an extra 60mm fan so now it has an 8cm and a 6cm fan and now it seems to have done the trick. </s>
<s> It's now running at 42C. </s>
<s> Dont know if it should be cooler than that or if that is ok. Heres a link to the arocool dp-102 website http://www.aerocool.us/p-cooler/dp-102/dp102.htm Thanks Ramarc for your help it was greatly appreciated Thanks Paul </s>
<s> This is problem with some of the unique cpu cooling fans now. </s>
<s> You really got the check the specs or dimensions of the cpu HSF in order to be able to use it. </s>
<s> Yeah, you're in the upper limit of the careful temp control. </s>
<s> I suggest you get another one that &quot;fits&quot; the bill. </s>
<s> Sorry, but you learn the hard way, get another HSF. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you'll pay the price of a replacement cpu and that's not cheap. </s>
