1.2.1	Accesss Device Manager by typing devmgmt.msc in the RUN box , then hit enter .	St
1.2.2	To the left of & quot ; Processors & quot ; should be a + sign .	St
1.2.3	If you see 2 procs listed , you have a HT CPU .	St
1.2.4	Another way is opening up Task Manager .	St
1.2.5	If you see 2 graphs in Performance Tab , you have HT .	St
1.2.6	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.7	See : http : //www.intel.com/support/processors/pentium4/sb/CS-017371.htm	St
