Distended capacitors I am told. No one knows why. I took out the hd and want to add it to another computer so user can continue work in same disk, HP Vector, pentium 3 with windows xp pro. And so I can learn how to do it. I can add this hd to the HP power supply, but both buses are female, and I can't find a way to plug into the master bus and make the this hd a slave. Nor am I sure of any config requirements, drive d etc. If anyone can direct me before I electricute myself or blow up the second computer I would be grateful. The old hd came out of a four year old emachine, but I can't tell what kind of hd or size etc.

Read http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=bad+caps&btnG=Google+Search More at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague where the cause is revealed. As to the drive, since the drive cables are incorrect, get around the issue by placing the drive into some USB drive housing. Bob

Just visit the Western Digital hard drive support website. Look under the IDE HD section and get the &quot;basic&quot; info of what appears to be the Gb or Mb size you have in order to become familiar to HDs in general. You need to know master/slave setups or CSEL type, etc. Most HDs have some decal/sticker affixed to them explain what model they are, so go with that, it HAS to be there, otherwise you need to post some pics to allow details to become evident. HP provides some infop as well through thier support website. Check under adding a 2nd to your model# and take it from there as another option. tada -----Willy
