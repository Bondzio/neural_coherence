1.1.1	Folks: My G5 has suddenly begun generating what I want to describe as &quot;patterned screen garbage&quot; when I start up and/or restart the machine.	St
1.1.2	This seems to be slightly less intense as the machine warms up.	St
1.1.3	Sometimes it is so bad that I can't even see the sign-on box.	St
1.1.4	Other times I can get started and signed on, and matters gradually seem to resolve as I begin running programs.	St
1.1.5	Hardware details: G5 dual processor, 2 ghz, built 2003; 3 gb ram; Original 30&quot; Apple Cinema LCD display; Radeon 9800 XT, R360 graphics processor.	St
1.1.6	I ran TechTools once I got the machine up and running, and it found no problems--but of course that was when the video was working.	St
1.1.7	(I tried to run it when the video was weird, but could not see enough to read the report.)	St
1.1.8	I also tried to search the web to see if this was a problem, and found nothing.	St
1.1.9	Have done obvious stuff like checking connections, unplugging peripherals, etc.	St
1.1.10	My thoughts are that this could be a bad graphics processor, display, or RAM chip.	Polite
1.1.11	But I wanted to see if anyone had experience with this kind of off-again-on-again graphics issue, especially on start up and restart.	St
1.1.12	Thanks for your help, Bill Poole	St
1.2.1	Sorry - system 10.4.11 Bill	St
