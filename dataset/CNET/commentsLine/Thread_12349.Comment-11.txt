ive been running a wireless connection for about one year now, my choice of a router was a d-link di-624.
i live in a rural new hampshire setting, im networking on one level in my home and i have 3 desktop computers connected to the network.
i have comcast as a broadband isp.
i use a comcast provided surfboard cable modem and a d-link voip telephone adapter.
other than occasional power outages i havent needed to reset my router once.
as far as customer service is concerned i did call them once when initially setting up the network.
the problem as it turned out was due to my confusion.
i found them to be prompt, courteous and knowledge.
my friend who lives two towns over uses linksys gear on two levels in his house and has no problems.
i guess as long as you stick to a brand name, dont mix and match wi-fi components you should be alright.
