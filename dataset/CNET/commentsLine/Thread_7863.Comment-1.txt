i have this samsung 400gb pata drive that spins ok but windows wants to initialise all the time.
i have tried easyrecovery professional and it says there's no file system on it: the rapid smart test shows the drive passes the test; so i tried the raw data recovery option, but after 5 minutes i get an error message and the drive starts clicking, so i stopped it immediately.
i tried r-studio and it too sees the drive with no file system, attempts a raw recovery but there again after 5 minutes the drive starts to click and i stop it .
now, i boot from ubuntu cd , ubuntu rescue remix or even knoppix, and none of them sees the drive !!!
any idea how to get my data back ?
?
