I have a Presario 5000US and would like to change the factory installed motherboard with a new motherboard/CPU combo upgrade.
Does anyone know a good motherboard that would be compatible with this Compaq model.
I am told there can be issues with power supply hook-ups and alignment.
I can't spend a fortune right now and this looked like a good way to upgrade without buying an entirely new system.
Everything else on the unit is up to date.
It is a standard A-Slot, ATX board with a 750 MHz Duron chip.
Any help would really be appreciated.
The HP site wasn't a big help?
Thanks, Dave
