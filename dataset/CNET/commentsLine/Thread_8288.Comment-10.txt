after all this i now think this is a dead end.
keep reading please.
the newer laptops arrive with uefi bios enabled and that is going to break old install systems.
ok, how did i fix that on a new windows laptop that came with uefi enabled?
1. i created the restore media.
2. since this was the first time i had to deal with this i slipped in a new blank hdd.
3. i set the bios to legacy only.
4. i used the restore media to restore the laptop to near factory condition.
5. finally i could boot linux media and do a good install just like we did before uefi.
--&gt; what does this all mean?
as the industry changes to uefi bios we'll have to wait till the linux distros catch up.
sorry i didn't spot this earlier.
and this subject is widely discussed so i'll stop here so you can do more research.
