I have tried this and find that I cannot connect to the network with my wireless laptop when the broadcast is disabled. In order to get on to the network I have to enable the SSID broadcast, scan for available networks, and then connect to my network. I can then surf the web or access my other wired computers. Once done with my work, I then disable the broadcast of the SSID until I have need to access again with my laptop. This seems foolish and not very secure as my SSID is being broadcast for as long as my wireless session lasts. My question is this: Is there some way to sign onto my network with my wireless laptop even when the broadcast of the SSID is disabled. Windows XP Home SP2 up to date. Toshiba Satellite M35X-S329 Linksys WRT54G v1.1 with latest firmware installed. Security Mode WPA Personal using TKIP. Thanks SI-PTB

There is so little gained by doing this and it does break connectivity on many products. I write &quot;don't do that.&quot; Listen to Cnet's Real Deal podcast and see what they say at http://digg.com/podcasts/The_Real_Deal_from_CNET/208840/d315700.mp3 &quot;Episode: Real Deal 41 - Wi-Fi security Robert Vamosi joins Tom Merritt to talk about the proper ways to secure your Wi-Fi router in your home. They also discuss safety precautions to use when surfing over Wi-Fi in public.: I encountered a REAL issue recently with WEP and MAC filters taking a brutal exploit in minutes. In the next link I share my findings and ask if there is a new crack tool out. Yes there is. Read how to fix that at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 So if you research that new tool you find it gets the SSID in seconds. No gain, all pain. Bob
