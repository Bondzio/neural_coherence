not that worried about the drive itself.
i can replace that.
i need to recover the data if in fact the symptoms are those of a crashed or crashing drive.
unfortunately i am out of warantee as of last april.
i am hoping that someone else had this misfortune before and can shed some light.
i am trying to open the case and identify the source of the click.
