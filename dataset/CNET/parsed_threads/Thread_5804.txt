<s> Greetings all, and Happy Thanksgiving. </s>
<s> I am about to come into a sizable sum of money (don't worry, no one died), and my desktop is in sore need of replacing. </s>
<s> I don't mean an upgrade, I mean a brand new built-from-scratch custom computer with the best parts available on the consumer market as of right now (barring &quot;collector's pieces&quot; deliberately produced in limited quantity and the like). </s>
<s> I've always been behind the curve on computer power, and this is my chance to make up for it. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, my expertise largely extends to using a computer, not knowing its inner workings, so I was hoping you guys could be of some help to me in determining which parts are &quot;best&quot;. </s>
<s> What do I mean by &quot;best&quot;? </s>
<s> Well, generally I mean &quot;fastest&quot; in regard to CPU and RAM, a motherboard with a high number of RAM slots and other important features, highest possible output for a power supply, greatest polygon-pushing power for a graphics card, most effective cooling fans (if needed), a monitor with huge resolution and good contrast ratio, and an audio card that... does whatever audio cards do really really well. </s>
<s> If there's any important parts I've left out, please feel free to inform me. </s>
<s> Now that I've established myself as a complete n00b, I was hoping you guys could fill in the blanks. </s>
<s> I know there's probably some contention about which parts meet the quality of &quot;best&quot;, but if so, just list the parts you consider &quot;almost unparalleled in quality&quot;, and hopefully I can use hardware review sites to narrow my choices down from there. </s>
<s> Sorry for this being such an open-ended request, but this simply isn't my area of expertise. </s>

<s> I've found going to gamer websites and/or 3rd party game PC builders provide enough info to go in the right direction. </s>
<s> Custom builders that offer a selection provide a basis to compare, though you need not buy from them. </s>
<s> Checkout ibuypower and cyberpower websites. </s>
<s> Further OEM systems supplied from Dell and HP using the brand labels XPS, Alien or VooDoo are top-end PCs. </s>
<s> You get a feel by reviewing the specs what's a good match and/or something again to compare to from any vendor. </s>
<s> As always read the &quot;fine print&quot;. </s>
