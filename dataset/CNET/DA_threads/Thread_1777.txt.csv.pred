1.1.1	iMac/0S X 10.6.1/2.66 GHZ Core 2 Duo/4GB 1067MHZ DDR3/640GB HD/ For about 2 months my Epson CX5200 always prints regular horizontal red lines on every sheet of paper , spaced at 1/2 inch vertical intervals .	St
1.1.2	The horizontal length of these red lines varies , and is equal to the horizontal length of the printed matter on the page .	St
1.1.3	( ditto in landscape orientation , with the red lines vertical ) The red line problem shows up in all cases , even when printing in grayscale .	St
1.1.4	Nozzle checks are clean and correct ( except for the extra red lines ) I 've changed the magenta printer cartridge .	St
1.1.5	All cartridges are Epson OEM .	St
1.1.6	I 've downloaded the latest Epson drivers for OS 10.6	St
1.2.1	Understand , for Epsons when changing the ink carts changes just that , & quot ; INK cart & quot ; not the inkjet printhead .	St
1.2.2	Which is why when a Epson has problems it usually relates to the prthd..	St
1.2.3	In such cases , doing a cleaning of several times is required .	St
1.2.4	Your test results are NOT good if you have red lines appearing .	St
1.2.5	That also suggests you got a blown ink jet itself or a bad control/IC for that particular inkjet .	St
1.2.6	This is not a end user fixable ( unless you 're capable & quot ; buy the parts , yada , yada and fix it .	St
1.2.7	However , for that cost you can buy another one ( replacement ptr . ) .	St
1.2.8	Further , if you have any warranty , use it .	St
1.2.9	I leave out any possible s/w glitch but I would think that Epson support offer in FAQ , a link to a fix .	St
1.2.10	Of course , if you have n't query them for more .	St
1.2.11	As it is , I do n't know of this problem as s/w related , but again Mac systems are different .	St
1.2.12	yada -- -- -Willy	St
