<s> hi i want to upgrade my pc i know what i need/want my mobo has to have one agp slot for my vid card and i want ddr 2 thats alot to ask for i know but i found a mobo that handles that but every one i talk to says it sucks i have never heard of the bradn but if you dont plan on overclocking it shouldnt matter right. </s>
<s> i mean im gunna get a 3.6 processor 2gb of ddr2 ram so i wont need to over clock any thing. </s>
<s> basicaly all im asken is does the mobo really matter unless u plan to overclock. </s>
<s> if i could find a better mobo i would get it but there is only one iv found that handles what i want heres the mobo i was thinken about getten http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813135157 ps if any one knows about mobos that handle ddr2 and has one agp slot tell me pls </s>
<s> Why do you want a AGP vid card?? </s>
<s> PCI Express is faster and you can run SLI. </s>
<s> Which cpu are you going to use? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> do you have that sways you to get a mobo with AGP? </s>
<s> your going to have to get a LGA775 motherboard to get DDR2. </s>
<s> As for AGP, i would not get an AGP mobo with DDR2. </s>
<s> It's pointless. </s>
<s> Get PCI Express for the bandwidth and future proofing. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813135176 ^ has AGP and DDR2 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131542 ^ has PCI Express and DDR2 konny </s>
<s> A) it's not PCI-X, PCI-X is 64-bit PCI running at 66MHZ, 100MHZ or 133MHZ and is used for enterprise level add in cards such as $1000 RAID controllers B) your thinking of PCIE (also called PCIe or PCI-E) which is another interface avliable for server boards that has recently been ported to consumer level equipment for graphics, it allows SLi or CrossFire if you have the following: A) a chipset that supports it B) graphics cards that support it C) a motherboard that supports it D) a power supply that can handle it your post is mostly wrong and he did state the CPU he was consider the Pentium 4 3.6GHZ </s>
