1.1.1	I decided to upgrade my ancient dual Pentium Pro 200mhz Socket 8 system to a faster speed .	St
1.1.2	The way I chose to do it was by acquiring two Pentium II Overdrive Processors ( PODP66X333 SL2KE ) .	St
1.1.3	These Overdrive Processors will effectively raise the speed of my system from 200mhz to 333mhz .	St
1.1.4	The problem I 'm having is that the Processors did not come with Heatsinks and Fans .	St
1.1.5	I 've searched ebay , spoken to a rep from Sanyo-Denki , and Googled till I 'm about to Girgle .	St
1.1.6	Can anyone help ?	Ques
1.1.7	I 'm including the following link which shows a really good image of the Heatsink & Fan attached to the Processor .	St
1.1.8	http : //www.cpu-collection.de/ ? l0=i & i=1814 & s=big & tb=1 & n=1 & sd=0	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Because , you 're dealing with a dated product , you have to hunt the dickens to find anything .	St
1.3.2	Wo n't the 200Mhz fans work ?	Ques
1.3.3	Find some typical fans than have 3-ear mounting brackets .	St
1.3.4	Are n't there any used outlets in your area ?	Ques
1.3.5	Here 's a outlet center than may help or not : http : //www.allelectronics.com/ -OR- similar websites , used , off-lease returns , etc .	St
1.3.6	Also , check with modding websites that custom fit all sorts of items .	Sug
1.3.7	Query there and maybe follow-up on some links they provides .	St
1.3.8	Here 's a quick modder link : http : //www.overclockers.com tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	The fans are attached and ready to use from Intel .	St
1.4.2	You did n't need to find fans .	St
