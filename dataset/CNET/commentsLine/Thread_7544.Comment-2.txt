1. microsoft rarely gets drivers correct.
2. you neglected the tip: that is just above the message body and subject that notes you should tell what os and more: &quot;if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; 3.  notes many things about usb.
including current bios, enabling usb in the bios, drivers for the motherboard, administrator install of drivers in xp/nt/2000/2003 and more more more.
4. if it's for work, then your it staff should be called in.
best of luck and if you reload the hard disk, then be sure to record all the steps for faster reinstall the next time.
