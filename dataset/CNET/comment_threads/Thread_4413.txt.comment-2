If the drive worked before, look at the ribbon cable, the motherboard and the drive itself.
All have Pin 1 configuration marks.
Make sure the red mark on the ribbon (pin 1) goes to pin 1 on the motherboard.
Some floppies do not have the mark - so try the cable both ways.
If this doesn't work try a new cable.
