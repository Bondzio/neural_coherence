i keep my pc on at all times except when there is a major lightning storm, when i do turn it off.
as an electrical engineer i feel by leaving the pc on keeps the electronics at a more uniform temperature and eliminates the surges that occur when turning it on.
possibly turning it off overnight would not be to bad, but it is saving a minimal amount of kwhr to be left off.
turning it off/on for several times a day is not very good for the electronics.
