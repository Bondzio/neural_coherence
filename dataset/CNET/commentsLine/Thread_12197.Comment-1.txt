hi there, i am thinking of buying an old pii 133 laptop, (i will probably install win98 on it) but it doesn't have usb port so i am wondering, to xfer various files larger than 1.4 mb, can i hook this thing up to my win 2000 machine via a parallel cable?
and if so, what do i need beyond the cable itself?
will windows just start talking back and forth or do i need some software?
speed is not a big issue here --fj ps it has a &quot;irda 1.0&quot; port, whatever that is - fj
