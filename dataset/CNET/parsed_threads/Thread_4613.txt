<s> in trying to find out what kind of MOBO I have I ran across AIDA32, while going though everything that this program brought up it said that i have an AGP slot thats not in use. </s>
<s> My question is, when i opened the case and looked i saw an area labeled AGP1 and there is nothing there, is it possible to ADD and AGP slot? </s>
<s> if so how hard would it be? </s>
<s> Any help would be great full. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Use CPU-Z ( http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php ) to confirm the manufacturer and model number of the motherboard. </s>
<s> Post the results here. </s>
<s> I will note that some motherboard models used by big name computer makers will specify that there is a particular slot or other ports, but they end up missing or as dummy ports that never were wired. </s>
<s> How hard would it be? </s>
<s> Entirely too difficult and expensive. </s>
<s> The solution is to get a new motherboard with the slot you want or just purchase a new computer. </s>
<s> Maybe a PCI (not PCI Express) video card will suffice? </s>
