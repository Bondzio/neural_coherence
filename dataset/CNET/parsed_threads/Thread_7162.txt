<s> My PC would not recognize my monitor. </s>
<s> I tried another monitor but nothing. </s>
<s> I plugged my monitor into another connector on back of the PC and now the monitor works but I keep getting an error message after restart: &quot;The ATI Control Panel failed to initialize because no ATI driver is installed or ATI driver not working properly.&quot; What is causing this? </s>
<s> Is there is special connector on back of PC for monitors only? </s>
<s> Can I install/buy a new connector? </s>
<s> If so, where do I purchase them? </s>
<s> an add in video card. </s>
<s> As for a special connector....yes....and there are two popular types. </s>
<s> One is for analog output and the other for digital. </s>
<s> An analog type will be 3 rows of 5 pins. </s>
<s> Digitals vary a bit but are also 3 rows of pins in a larger connector. </s>
<s> You cannot accidentally plug a video cable into a port not meant for it. </s>
<s> In any event, it's possible your PC had on board (motherboard) video that was disabled and a higher performance card added instead. </s>
<s> This could account for no output from that port. </s>
<s> As for your error message, that sounds like you just need to find and install the correct driver. </s>
<s> It's a simple task if you know the model of your ATI card. </s>
<s> You didn't say anything about your PC, it's hardware, whether it ever worked, etc. </s>
<s> Knowing these details would help. </s>
<s> What do you need to know about my PC? </s>
<s> The monitor has been working fine for the past 2 years. </s>
<s> I did have power loss 3 times the other day maybe that did something to the video card. </s>
<s> I take it I cannot just replace the connector on back of the PC because it's attached to a video card? </s>
<s> As you can see, I'm not real technical but I am willing to learn and like &quot;hands on&quot; learning. </s>
<s> Because you mentioned two places to plug in a monitor you're going to have to figure out if one connects to the motherboard and the other to a separate video card. </s>
<s> And, do you know if moving the cable to the other port is what gave you some response on the screen? </s>
<s> It's possible that a port on the motherboard that's been disabled could be re-enabled during a power lose under some circumstances. </s>
<s> If that's the case, that disabled video device may not have had a driver installed because it didn't need one. </s>
<s> If you know you had a separate video card and could confirm it to be dead, you could use the motherboard video by installing a driver for it. </s>
<s> What would be needed would be the Radeon chip model. </s>
<s> You'd need to know your motherboard model or, if you could open the case and look inside, you might find an ATI chip with the model on it. </s>
<s> Depending on the age of the PC, two common ones had been the 7500 and 9600. </s>
<s> But, if it's on your motherboard your best if you have it is the motherboard driver disk. </s>
<s> Any chance of that? </s>
<s> Steve - my neighbor is really good with hardware on PC's. </s>
<s> I'm going to have him take a look at it when he gets a chance. </s>
<s> I don't really want to fool around inside the PC. </s>
<s> I appreciate all your help with this. </s>
<s> Will let you know what he finds. </s>
<s> Take care. </s>

<s> who can help. </s>
<s> In my work which is not specific to PCs, troubleshooting is at least 90% making good observations and the rest doing the &quot;hands on&quot; repairs. </s>
<s> Hope you get this straightened out. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
