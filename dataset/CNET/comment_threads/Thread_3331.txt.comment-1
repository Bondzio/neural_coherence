Hello, I have a Netgear wgt624v3 wireless router + sb5101.
The thing is, I have a desktop that needs to be connected to the internet.
Now, the thing I realized is that I don't have a cable outlet where the desktop is placed in.
All I have is an ethernet outlet in that room and I am using that outlet for my wireless router.
What should I do?
should I just buy an wireless adaptor for my desktop?
