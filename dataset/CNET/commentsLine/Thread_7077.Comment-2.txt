your gateway and dns server should not be the same address.
the router lan ip is the gateway.
the dns server comes from the wan side.
it would be your isp server address but you don't generally need to plug that in.
i would start by trying to connect the wired port and get it working first.
this can help rule out some issues with the laptop.
