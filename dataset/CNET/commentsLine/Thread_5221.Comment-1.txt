given all the hoopla about wifi problems and gps problems and availability problems and the fact that i am not a gamer nor will i watch movies on it would i be happy with the old transformer vs the prime?
i am one that likes the latest tech but not a show stopper.
is the above listed issues really a big deal or are they being blown out of proportion?
thanks!
