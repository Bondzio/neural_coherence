It starts of with a very bad lag then hangs-up without any notice. It just hangs up my computer and I need to reboot it. I have tried using another harddrive and video card but the problem still remains. In normal applications, my computer does not hang-up. I have tried numerous anti-virus softwares and my pc is clean. My CPU heat ranges from 40-55C and my motherboard heat is from 30-35C. My specs are P4 1.8ghz 384 ddr sdram ati 9200 128mb hitachi 7250deskstar 80gb hdd (known as IBM before) asus p4s333 motherboard. (or p4s3333) How can i know that it is my ram that is faulty or my motherboard or something else??? Thanx.
