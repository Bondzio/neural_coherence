<s> I was at Office Max yesterday and saw two routers on sale. </s>
<s> They appeared to be exactly the same router, except that one was &quot;draft&quot; N and the other was just &quot;N&quot;. </s>
<s> The draft N was about $20 bucks cheaper. </s>
<s> I live far out in the country and the beavers and turkeys out here are of the non laptop carrying types, so I really have no need for security and encryption, but I do have a tremendous need for RANGE. </s>
<s> Is there anyhting to fear from the draft N vs. N? </s>
<s> I think both were Dlink routers. </s>
<s> older (less than 6 mo.) </s>
<s> technology than &quot;n&quot;. </s>
<s> The W3C has a final version of the standard (&quot;n&quot;) but, as of now, has not given it its blessing. </s>
<s> It will. </s>

<s> Since Wireless N (802.11N) specs have not been finalized, there is no gaurantee 802.11N routers from one company (eg Linksys) would work together problem-free with 802.11N adapters from another company (e.g. </s>
<s> Netgear or D-Link). </s>
<s> As long as you buy the matched pair (Wireless N Router and Adapter), you should just look for which pair gives you the best range. </s>
<s> With unmatched pairs (even within the same brand)you may end up having to run both in basic 802.11G mode. </s>
<s> The $20 price difference is nothing compare to the hassles you can get with incompatible router's and adapters when non-final wireless specs are involved. </s>
