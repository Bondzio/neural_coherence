exactly john!
i have posted on this before.
both the athlon 64 3300+ and 3100+ are offered by various manufactures!
the reduced l2 cache appears to be being offered to mass manufacturers to enable them to use the athlon 64 trademark at a reduced price.
apart from the 64 bit capabilities, i am convinced these 256 l2 cache variants offer little over the sempron 3100+ which has 1600 fsb and 256 l2 cache.
it's a shame amd allows and promotes the athlon 64 name for an inferior product:( i am currently shopping for a new rig and continually run into this misrepresentation of an otherwise fine product.
