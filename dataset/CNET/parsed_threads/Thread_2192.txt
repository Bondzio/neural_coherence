<s> With so many laptops to choose from I don't know where to begin. </s>
<s> All I want the laptop to do is word processing, running programs like Matlab or Mathematica and surfing the internet. </s>
<s> Now i understand i can get one that performs all these operations for a low price, however i hate waiting! </s>
<s> When i click the application i want it load almost instantly. </s>
<s> So what kind of laptop should i get? </s>
<s> I was told that centrino is great for word processing and has a good battery life. </s>
<s> Any opinions? </s>
<s> Centrino is not a procesor, it's a marketing sham Centrino is what Intel calls it's new mobile solution based around the Celeron M (phu yuck) and the Pentium M (mmm...wholesome Pentium M goodness) Celeron M laptops are cheap Pentium M laptops are very expensive both get good battery life, as their CPU's designed from the ground up for mobile use (following Intel's normal design standards, the Celeron M is based off the Pentium M, which is based off the Pentium III, which is why it's such a good CPU) i would say your &quot;i need it to load instantly&quot; request can be handled easily you don't need a Pentium M for that and btw nothing with a comptuer is instantanious, so please, don't expect it to be but i can certainly understand you not wanting it to be slow in the sense that it takes it 5 minutes to load Word, which would make it horribly un-productive you also need to understand that for a laptop to get online you need an internet connection and either a wire going to it, or a Wi-Fi router and an add in card (Centrino equipped notebooks sometimes feature onboard Wi-Fi reception, which would mean you don't need the card) as gaming is not something you want to do, I would suggest this notebook http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=34-115-171&depa=3 The AMD Sempron 3000-M should be easily capable of anything you'll need, and should give you decent battery life if you need more battery life, consider this guy: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-115-181&depa=3 it's basically trading the Mobile Sempron for a Pentium M 715 and trading slow integrated graphics, for slow integrated graphics...from a different company if you want more power on all fronts http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-114-127&depa=3 that Toshiba should deliver with flying colors, Radeon X600 (around GeForce 6200 level of power), faster Pentium M, 60GB HDD, 512MB of DDR all the notebooks i've suggested use 512MB of DDR i'd say 512MB is the minimum this one would offer more CPU performance, but less graphics power: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-110-148&depa=3 save with this one: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-146-046&depa=3 this would probably be another quick book: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-224-004&depa=3 larger HDD, more RAM, and a faster CPU than anything previously shown, i'm not sure how the X600np stacks up to the Mobility Radeon 9700 though... basically same thing but from Acer: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-115-180&depa=3 here is a tablet PC: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-148-011&depa=3 better tablet PC: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-110-125&depa=3 this one would be a beast, faster than anything else i've suggested this far: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-115-178&depa=3 alright, this would be fastest notebook you could buy: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=34-224-008&depa=3 it weighs 12 lbs and probably has less than 4 hours of battery life, it would get hotter than...yeah it's a DTR, not a notebook i'd say grab a nice Pentium M book and be happy </s>
<s> I would say customize a laptop from either hp or dell or wait a couple of months for the 64-bit tsunami to reside first. </s>
<s> My recommendations is for you to wait for the first 64-bit pentium M. If not, get a current pentium M. Toshiba is good choice. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> they aren't newegg built there are: Acer IBM Toshiba Fujitsu and ABS notebooks suggested there customizing isn't a bad idea, except that Dell sucks, and HP is expensive also 64-Bit Pentium M's would cost a fortune (a normal 32-bit Pentium M 2GHZ is around $600, consider a 64-bit, and it's Intel...we are talking $1100 CPU here) you don't need 64-bit BTW and the next mobile chips from Intel aren't going to be 64-bit Pent M's their going to be Dual Cored chips, on the Yonah core should be out in Q4 64-bit chips atm aren't gonna help you in the future, as everything is going dual core... </s>
