But lets take a real bill and find a number to use.
Using the total bill divided by the number of KWh I arrive at 15.68 cents per KWh.
1 year = 8,760 hours 30 Watts for 1 year = 262.8 KWh or 41.21 bucks.
You decide here.
But your usual gamer desktops idles at 200 Watts so let's do that.
About 275 a year.
