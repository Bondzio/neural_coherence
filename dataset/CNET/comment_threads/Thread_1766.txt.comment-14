Ok... after much review I think I should buy the GeForce 6800 Ultra.
I'm not sure if this card would be compatible with Inventor but I think it might be.
I would like to find a 6800 Ultra with 512 MB oof RAM but I can't find one anywhere.
In fact I can't find any 6800 Ultras anywhere!
Anyone have any idea if this is a good card for Inventor and games and if so where I can get one?
?
