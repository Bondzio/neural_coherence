here i would have written the one line copy command (sftp and such is available on the command line with added command line apps.)
then scheduled it after testing.
i could expand the script to send me the results via email or such.
but it appears your spec needs to be written up and then put to some programmer to create it.
if you don't want them to use the native task scheduler for what ever reason, tell them.
