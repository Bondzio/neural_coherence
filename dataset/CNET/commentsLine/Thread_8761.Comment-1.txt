... in the &quot;available wireless network list.&quot; i have had two desktop pcs connected to my wired home network.
i also had a d-link wbr-2310 wireless router installed.
i had created an &quot;unsecure&quot; wireless network (abc123) to use my laptop.
it was working fine.
i was able to wirelessly connect to the internet and peek into the desktops.
yesterday, i decided to make the network secure by putting in a wep key.
after that, the network has disappeared fro the network list and i have not been able to do anything with my laptop, wirelessly, that is.
when i try to create a new wireless network using the wireless wizard, it asks me you want to create new network or add a computer to the existing (abc123).
so it is there somewhere.
hp c751nr laptop; xp pro; d-link wbr2310.
please help!
