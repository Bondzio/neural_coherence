I'm switching to a Mac from a PC and have been trying to decide which model to get.
For a number of reasons, rational and emotional, I've settled on the iMac G5.
I was wondering about the various configurations and this question seems at least a little relevant.
If you (the collective you) had the choice between a 20&quot; display with 1GB of memory or a 17&quot; display with 1.5GB, which side of the equation would you come down on?
(I think I've officially entered the nit-picky phase of selection).
Thanks, Jay
