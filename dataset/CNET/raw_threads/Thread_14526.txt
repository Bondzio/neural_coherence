It's a great computer and all, but the 80GB hard drive is quickly filling up. Dell set up a partition that alone takes up 10GB, and I've got Windows and Linux running so I've partitioned Linux for another 10. My question is, are external hard drives capable of properly running programs such as games, at the speed of my regular hard drive? Thanks in advance. Scottie.

Now I've got another question. You wouldn't happen to know of any reliable external hard drive brands would you? I'm looking for something around 120-160GB. Thanks Scottie
