<s> I recently upgraded my computer (by myself *sob*). </s>
<s> It was new installation of a video card. </s>
<s> My old one was an Integrated NVidia that is forever onboard as far as I can tell, and the new video card is an ATI Radeon 7000. </s>
<s> I installed it, and it seems to be working all right as far as everything goes. </s>
<s> I recently went to play a game, LineageII. </s>
<s> I knew I fell somewhere between the minimum and maximum requirements, so I went to play and it told me that my AGP was deactivated, and to enable it for consistency. </s>
<s> When I'd start the game, the screen would go black. </s>
<s> I figured I'd better enable my AGP -- however, when I went to do so I realized I had no frickin' clue how to do it. </s>
<s> I tried to do it through DirectX, but it's greyed out. </s>
<s> When I tried to do it in Bios, my Bios said NOTHING about any AGP but at the same time I haven't an idea what to look for and modify thus I got really confused. </s>
<s> I've been trying for two days now to figure something out without ruining my computer Help! </s>
<s> I know I run an ASUS motherboard. </s>
<s> My Bios type -- I don't know but it says &quot;ev 1004/aa&quot; under revision type and something about Pheonix Award Bios Setup. </s>
<s> I am so lost! </s>
<s> Help me! </s>
<s> if it didn't say anything about AGP, is there a place to disable the onboard? </s>
<s> Maybe if it is disabled it will automatically switch to AGP. </s>
