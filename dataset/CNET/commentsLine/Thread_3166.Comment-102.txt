though computing for many years, still classify myself as a hobbist.
would like to know more about the smart drive utilities mentioned by kmanley57 - that checks use time, problems, etc.
on externals.
running xp/pro on dell inspiron 530 - using acronis 11.0 backup program.
i run 2 identical external hd backups.
one is fan cooled, and both are on -- one at a time, on demand only, then shut off.
both are about a year old.
though i think i'm well covered, i still have doubts.
