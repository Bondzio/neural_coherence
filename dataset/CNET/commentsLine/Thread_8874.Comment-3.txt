if your dvd came with some install cd, etc.
then use it.
it should contain any drivers plus!, the dvd player s/w.
if none, then goto the support website of rosewell products, you should at least get thier latest device drivers for that model dvd.
while wmp(win.
media player) will play dvds, it isn't always the default player, if not then select it as the pgm.
to do so, if it never did, then something is amiss.
get a free version of some media player for dvds.
i tried vlc from:  with success.
offhand, i think you got a s/w issue for now.
