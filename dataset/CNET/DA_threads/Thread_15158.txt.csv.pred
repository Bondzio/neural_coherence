1.1.1	I am probably like 85 % of the world and cant figure out the whole High-Def thing.	St
1.1.2	No doubt its better quality but understanding all of the specs etc...	St
1.1.3	Anyhow The other day I was at bb and noticed they have high-def monitors with the high-end cpus.	St
1.1.4	What I was wondering is ... isnt this just a gimick.	St
1.1.5	Aren't all lcd, + monitors by definition high-definition?	St
1.2.1	practically everything designed to make you buy something is a gimmick.	St
1.2.2	for a monitor to be highdef (hd) it typically should be widescreen and it must be able to accept a highdef 720p or 1080i feed via component, dvi, or hdmi inputs.	St
1.2.3	just having a dvi input really doesn't make it an hd monitor.	St
1.2.4	a caveat with hd computer monitors is that most are 16:10 (rather than 16:9 like most hd tvs), so you'll probably wind up with a squished, truncated, or letterboxed display when watching hd content.	St
1.3.1	I'd clarify that response even further ... the phrase &quot;high definition&quot; simply refers to resolution, and unless it specifically says &quot;high definition TV&quot; (aka &quot;HDTV&quot;) then you'd be comparing apples to oranges.	St
1.3.2	Basically, to be considered 'high def' a computer monitor just needs to support reolutions greater than 640x480 (VGA).	St
1.3.3	Nearly all 15 inch or larger monitors -- crt as well as flat panel -- support Super VGA (800x600) and higher resos, and hence are high definition.	St
1.3.4	The most succinct definition of 'hdtv' I've found so far is this: a television screen offering at least double the resolution of the highest quality standard definition TV screen (NTSC standard picture quality = 648 X 486 at 60 Hz refresh rate).	St
1.3.5	So ... if you want to know if a monitor really is 'High Def' then find out what it's highest resolution is.	St
