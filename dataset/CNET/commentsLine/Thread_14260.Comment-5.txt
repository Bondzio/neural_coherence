thanks again bob, well i was hoping to use my student status as an advantage and get an edu discount from hp.
they offer the best discount that i can find.
i was looking at the dv6t which comes in c2d or i7 (and amd).
there are several quick-ship models as well as customized models which allow me to tweak with the specs a little.
your link seems to point to a desktop.
i am really looking for a laptop.
as for the prices, they are $705 for c2d (with a faster fsb and 4gb ram (no gpu)) and $915 for i7 (4gb, 1333mhz, 1gb gpu).
i just couldn't find cheaper.
add on wireless-n, 12 cell battery and a few customizations and its like $1,045.
