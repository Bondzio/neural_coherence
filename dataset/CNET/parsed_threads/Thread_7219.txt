<s> Being reluctant to spend money and of the old fasion opinon that pc's should be as long lasting as appliences from the 70's (yeah I know) I am still using a ATI/Rage Fury Pro Xpert 2000 PRO card. </s>
<s> Does this card support ''Transform and Lighting''? </s>
<s> Probably not and if it doesn't can any recomend an inexpensive card that does. </s>
<s> I have a gigabyte Socket A mother board GA-7VAXP with an AMD Athalon XP 1800 chip. </s>
<s> Also can any one help me with navagating ATI's site. </s>
<s> Can I E-mail them this question? </s>
<s> Where on the site? </s>
<s> Customer support only seems to have a telephone option. </s>
<s> Thanks, everyone David </s>
<s> but they always had an email option before. </s>
<s> I've also used their telephone for a few bucks and the tech then set up an email back and forth operation at no extra cost, and didn't have own any ATI products. </s>
<s> I just did. </s>
<s> There's scads of support and contact options. </s>
<s> Re transform and lighting for a new card, simply call their sales department. </s>
<s> You can usually con one of them to find the answer for you. </s>
<s> I have always found them to go out of their way to help. </s>
<s> Of course, one cannot start by yelling at them and telling them their stuff is junk as I suspect some others have done, then they complain here about the lack of support. </s>
<s> Not implying that about you in any way. </s>
<s> still does anyone know off hand if that card support T&L? </s>
