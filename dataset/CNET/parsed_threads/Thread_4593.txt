<s> My TDK 880N internal DVD burner has been acting flaky....gets hung up alot when I try to access it, or try to read data off a disc. </s>
<s> Are there any tools commonly available that I could use to test the drive, before I take it out and replace it? </s>
<s> TIA ss </s>
<s> I can clean install Linux in under an hour and see what K3b thinks of it. </s>
<s> However this is reserved for personal works since tech time per hour is more expensive than a new drive. </s>

<s> do a &quot;backup&quot; of enough files to fill the dvd and &quot;restore&quot; to a new directory &lt;dvdtest&gt;. </s>
<s> if there are problems with any of this, trash the writer and get a new one. </s>
<s> Bob is right, it would cost you more for bench service than a good dual-layer dvd writer. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
