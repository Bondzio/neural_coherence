I don't see a Server in the group.
Time and time again you find people try to use XP or a desktop OS as a server.
Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6126_102-0.html?threadID=355103&tag=forums06;forum-threads as an example.
About those IP problems.
Again &quot;Where's the server?&quot; comes up as what is managing the IP assignments?
I read where you hard assigned the numbers but without a DNS and matched DHCP server most of these setups will be tedious and failure prone.
