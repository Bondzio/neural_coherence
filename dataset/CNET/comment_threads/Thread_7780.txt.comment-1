I have 2 Dell 800 mghz computers with 256 mb of ram running windows XP.
When you boot up it will show the Dell logo and the time line for loading the BIOS but it takes a long time and then it will com up in dos with the message &quot;no hard drive detected press f1 to continue or f2 to enter setup&quot; If I press f1 it will boot up perfect.
If I go into setup it shows the hard drive.
I have flashed the BIOS, changed the ram, put in a new hard drive, and reinstalled XP because I thought it might be service pack 2.
Any info would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks Robert Frazier
