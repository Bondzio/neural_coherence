thanks for your reply bob.
it was actually the fact that the definition of router *is* so dynamic, that caused me to post in a forum rather than google.
there's various different conflicting factual sets of &quot;definitions&quot; out there so i wanted an expert opinion not a set of conflicting facts (as you get bogged down with if you use google to compile a glossary - which i'm doing).
the year i want to define this in is 2009, and the context is that i'm putting together a generic glossary (hoping to encompass definitions in the consumer, enterprise, industry, etc contexts).
does anyone know of any good networking glossary sites...?
