connect it to a friend's computer and perhaps a couple of others; if you can access it, then you may have a driver problem on the machines you're using.
go to your computer manufacturer's web site and look for updated or new usb or &quot;chipset&quot; drivers.
also, do you have a recovery disk?
you might be able to reinstall the usb or chipset drivers from there.
get a computer-savvy friend, or &quot;friend of a friend&quot; to help you with this if you need to.
if you can't access your hard drive on other computers, i'm sorry to say, your hard drive may simply have failed.
it happens.
it could also be that the file table has become corrupt.
whatever happened, all may not be lost: you sound like you're at or near a university.
if so, check or ask around if there's some sort of hard drive or data recovery service, maybe through the computer science or it lab.
or, maybe you can find a friend, or friend of a friend, who can do this at minimal cost, if any.
i say this because commercial services do exist for recovering data of a failed hard drive, but these are often very expensive.
in the future, you should plan to use a usb flash drive or cd/dvd/blu-ray to store your most important stuff in addition to whatever drive, internal or external, you are using as a primary or backup.
why?
because hard drives, internal or external, are mechanical devices, and can, and do, fail.
(and per murphy's law, often do at the worst time!)
i would also recommend using your computer's internal drives to store as much as you can, and use the external drive as a back-up, from which you can restore your files quickly, and possibly put a full &quot;disk image&quot; backup on (google &quot;disk image backup&quot; to read more, or read the documentation that came with your computer or windows).
