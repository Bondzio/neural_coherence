i am looking for an 8 bay external box for my pc.
i run vista 64-bit on my desktop and vista 32-bit on my laptop.
i would like for it to work on either pc.
i would prefer a box that will accept 8 drives, up to 2tb each, minimum of 1.5tb each.
reasonable pricing would be a benefit.
wireless connection is not required.
please leave me some suggestions.
thank you!
