The two drives stopped detecting inserted discs at the same time. I've tried the &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; help with no success. Device Manager states everything is O.K. I can't use the disc cleaner as the discs don't spin. I've tried every kind of disc I have with no success. I opened the drives to clean the lenses but couldn't see anything that looked like a lens. I used a lot of compressed air in any opening there was. Still no success. I checked for firmware updates - but I have the latest. I tried the Windows driver update, but was told I had the best driver. Could there be a registry setting that's wrong? What other things could I try? An old-timer trying to keep up.

I downloaded the wizard and received the following message for both drives: &quot;Either the device is malfunctioning or the wizard cannot determine the problem.&quot; I guess it's not an either/or, but both. Here is the log file that was generated. Perhaps it has some clues.

254	6	315104	2901166	2901161	R. Proffitt	11/5/08 8:49 PM	1.22591814E12	Just a link.	See how another solved it at http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/WinXP/microsoft.public.windowsxp.general/2006-02/msg06669.html
254	7	315104	2901841	2901166	re-tired	11/6/08 6:45 PM	1.2259971E12	Tried steps in link	Thanks for the lead. I had already uninstalled a previous burner (only files I found still around were log files). No new driver updates available. AUTOFIX still doesn't help. I'm becoming very concerned - nothing seems to help and I don't even want to consider new drives as I don't think two drives would mechanically fail at the same time. I'm trying to be hopeful that there's still something I can do to correct the problem. Any other suggestions? - I'll try anything.
254	8	315104	2901838	2901841	R. Proffitt	11/6/08 7:10 PM	1.2259986E12	So you've	1. Tried one drive at a time. 2. Removed the usual UPPER and LOWER FILTERS (read http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060 ) 3. Booted SAFE MODE and headed to the Device Manager to delete ALL CD/DVD drives there then rebooted. 4. Noted if the BIOS sees the drives. Remember if the BIOS doesn't find them, neither will Windows.
254	9	315104	2902580	2901838	re-tired	11/7/08 8:52 PM	1.22609112E12	Yes, I've tried 3 out of 4	I appreciate you sticking with me on this. I tried items 1, 3, & 4 with no success. I didn't attempt 2 because of the warning: &quot;uninstall all CD or DVD writing or recording programs&quot; before using this method. I have a writing program that was pre-installed on my computer with the OS (program called Click to DVD). If I delete it I don't know how to re-install as I don't have any install discs. At any rate, I see that this procedure is for resolving the error if the drive is missing from My Computer, but shows in Device Manager with a conflict. This isn't my problem. The drives are shown in My Computer and there is no conflict shown in Device Manager. Am I running out of options?

254	11	315104	2902775	2902690	re-tired	11/8/08 9:00 AM	1.2261348E12	Filters last resort	Bob, thanks for all your help. Unfortunately for us novices, &quot;something that [doesn't] work well&quot; is more than an &quot;only loss.&quot; I guess it's because we often don't know how to correct something that's not working well (the difference between &quot;not working well&quot; and &quot;not working&quot; is blurred. I hope you know how much your work is appreciated on this forum. I've learned a lot in the process. Thanks again. I'll report back on any success I get (it might be of value for others in the same boat.)
