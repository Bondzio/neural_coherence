<s> Hi, Today I noticed that when I tried to start my computer the computer started but my screen was blank and my computer just beeped. </s>
<s> Well, I removed my video card (GeForce 8600 GT) and just used the built in video card that came with my computer. </s>
<s> And everything is fine again. </s>
<s> What I want to know is what am i able to do to fix my video card if anything? </s>
<s> It seemed like all this occurred soon after I downloaded an update for the video card. </s>
<s> I tried numerous times to use the GeForce card but my computer just beeps and will not start. </s>
<s> Also I use a dell computer if that's any help. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I am no expert here, but this is what I would try. </s>
<s> Reconnect that video card and then boot up into Safe Mode, instructions here . </s>
<s> In Safe Mode the system only uses the onboard or default video settings. </s>
<s> Then either; 1] Use System Restore to go back to a time/date before you updated that video card. </s>
<s> Reboot into normal mode and see if that works. </s>
<s> If not. </s>
<s> 2] goto the Device Manager, (right click your My Computer icon, select Properties, then the hardware tab, then the Device Manager button). </s>
<s> Expand the Display Adapter tree by clicking on the + sign, highlight the video card, then delete it. </s>
<s> Reboot into normal mode and allow Windows to recognize new hardware and look for the drivers. </s>
<s> It may be that the card is now unserviceable and needs replacing. </s>
<s> Others here may have better guidance. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
