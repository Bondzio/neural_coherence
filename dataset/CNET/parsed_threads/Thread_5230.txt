<s> Has anyone refilled any Canon Printer Ink cartridges? </s>
<s> ive refilled epson cartridges for 2 different printers, it's risky, but potentially cost saving </s>
<s> Yes, I refilled the individual color cartridges for several years and had no trouble. </s>
<s> I let the printer set for 6 months(gave to son when bought another) and then it wouldn't print. </s>
<s> Canon wanted 3x price of new printer - price had dropped considerably since I bought it - for new print head. </s>
<s> As long as i used it - had no problem and saved a lot of money. </s>
<s> The printer was great 600 dpi but wanted more dpi for photos. </s>

<s> i am on my second canon printer, gave the first to my daughter for college. </s>
<s> i have always refilled my cartridges, either with a kit from costco, or one purchased over the internet. </s>
<s> i have never had a problem, even refilling numerous times per cartridge. </s>
<s> just follow the instructions carefully and have lots of tissue nearby for some minor leaking after refill. </s>
<s> it will soon stop and you can replace cartridge in printer and continue on with your projects. </s>
<s> you will have to override your printer color functions, but the printer will wlak you thru that process. </s>
<s> you will not be able to track ink usage after this step, but i just check them often. </s>
