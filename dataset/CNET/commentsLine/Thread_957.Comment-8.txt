as you stated the differences are very hard to detect.
for you average person who just used the router to surf the internet it does not really matter.
i will point out a couple of the features that you may or may not care about.
5g band.
most stuff uses 2.4g frequency and sometime it can be crowded so devices that can run at 5g are useful in certain situations.
devices that say they support 802.1a (which only runs on 5g) and also run n will run n on the 5g band.
dual this feature sometime means it has 2.4g and 5g radios that can be used at the same time.
more often it means that you can run 2 connection between your router and pc to get 300m.
gig ports.
in almost all cases including the use of 300m dual channel stuff you are wasting your time if you are just surfing.
there are no consumer connection that can give you more than even 100m of internet.
most the traffic that would need this high speed would be between machines in your house.
although i don't know if any of these have it some routers have the ability to filter traffic to prevent the kids from going to bad sites.
