<s> To give you some context to this poll, read this blog: Who wants an iPad Mini? </s>
<s> About one buyer in two Would you buy a 7-inch Apple iPad if one was available? </s>
<s> -- Yes, this is the exactly the size I am looking for. </s>
<s> -- Yes, as long as the price point is around $250 to $300. </s>
<s> -- Yes, just because I love Apple products. </s>
<s> -- No, my iPhone and iPad suits me just fine. </s>
<s> -- No, I will never buy an Apple product. </s>
<s> -- No, I have no need for one. </s>
<s> -- I haven't decided yet. </s>
<s> -- Other. </s>
<s> I'm a freelance book designer, a tech junkie, and an Apple lover. </s>
<s> But a 7&quot; iPad fills no need for me. </s>
<s> My production machine set-up is a 24&quot; iMac with a second 23&quot; Cinema DIsplay. </s>
<s> (I would like to upgrade the iMac to a 27&quot;.) </s>
<s> I have a 17&quot; MacBook Pro for working away from my studio (why I'm against Apple's doing away with optical drives in its laptops). </s>
<s> And I have both an iPad 3 plus an 4th gen iPod Touch for communicating and keeping track of things. </s>
<s> Apple is overpriced for the amount of storage you get. </s>
<s> I'm very happy with my Samsung 7.0 Plus tablet. </s>
<s> I've had a Kindle for about 18 months - absolutely love it (and yes, I also still read print books and listen to audio books). </s>
<s> About a month ago, I was given an iPad - my first Apple product ever. </s>
<s> Love that, too! </s>
<s> But for different reasons. </s>
<s> Not sure a 7&quot; iPad would be necessary, as I feel I have the best of both worlds - one for simple reading (and in sunlight if necessary); one with a larger screen when that would be preferred (and useful in the dark, if necessary). </s>
<s> The Kindle books sync nicely between the two. </s>
<s> Just seems that a smaller iPad would be overkill. </s>
<s> Very happy with my combo. </s>
<s> No, I'm not interested in a smaller ipad. </s>
<s> i would run out to get a 5 inch iphone though. </s>
<s> i just switched fronm an iphone to a samsung galaxy note for the larger screen, and as much as i like the larger phone, i really miss how well the iphone handles so many little tasks. </s>
<s> Thnik about this, between an iPod Touch (or iPhone) and an iPad, why would anyone need a 7&quot; screen? </s>
<s> It's too bulky to carry easily, I consider the touch too big, but I used to carry a &quot;brick&quot; cell phone, so that size is not so bad. </s>
<s> The iPad is ideal in size, being about the size of a portfolio or 8.5 x 11&quot; sheet of paper. </s>
<s> Too small means compromise, I don't want to need to zoom in all the time. </s>
<s> The 7&quot; would simply not fit any niche for me or my family. </s>
<s> Price is not as important as function. </s>
<s> People obcess about price and not how they will use it. </s>
<s> Cheaper does not mean better. </s>
<s> Buy what you need and what suits you best. </s>
<s> Buy a 1 or 2 generation older model. </s>
<s> If you have to have the latest thing, then why are you reading this post? </s>
<s> :P </s>
<s> It's perfect for her because she can stow it in her bag/purse. </s>
<s> As a guy, where do I put it? </s>
<s> Smaller is OK! </s>
<s> I would really be willing to pay the current iPad prices for a 7&quot; version IF they keep the hardware as is and don't remove the 4G capability. </s>
<s> ...sure, a lower price would be nice, but I just want a 7&quot; version. </s>
<s> I was playing with a smaller Samsung tablet at the AT&T store, and have also played with the PlayBook at work, and think the smaller size is perfect. </s>
<s> I can't count how many times I've said &quot;My iPad is too big, but my iPhone is too small&quot;. </s>
<s> Something 5 to 7 inches with a Retina display would be PERFECT for watching movies on the go, reading books, etc. </s>
<s> 7&quot; tablets are one of the main reasons that Android tablets sell. </s>
<s> I don't understand why Apple wouldn't want a piece of that market. </s>
<s> YES! </s>
<s> a 7.8&quot; iPad Mini is a MUST HAVE tablet for me!!! </s>
<s> (7.0&quot; is too small) I take my iPad on trips, and it is TOO BIG! </s>
<s> The 9.7&quot; is perfect around the house, but the more you take it with you, the more its size gets in the way. </s>
<s> It will still be almost 4x the size of a iPod Touch, so there is no overlap. </s>
<s> Kids will love the smaller size iPad Mini too. </s>
<s> If it has all the features of iPad 2 with 5MP camera with flash, it will be a great buy even for $350. </s>
<s> Apple has 3 sizes of MacBook Pro, 2 sizes of iMac. </s>
<s> Samsung has no less then 5 sizes of its tablets! </s>
<s> (10&quot;, 8&quot;, 7&quot;, 5&quot;, 4&quot;). </s>
<s> So what is wrong about 2 sizes of iPad? </s>
<s> Either &quot;Yes, this WAS (the) exactly the size I WAS looking for.&quot; Or &quot;No, I have no need for one, because I got a Kindle Fire.&quot; Or some such. </s>
<s> The cliche &quot;too little, too late&quot; seems to apply here. </s>
<s> I've tried out a 7&quot; unit and would really like to see an 8&quot; product come out (Apple of course). </s>
<s> The 7&quot; ers a just a wee bit small for me. </s>
<s> A three-inches smaller screen just to save $100? </s>
<s> That is ludicrous. </s>
<s> It's going to be very tough to do email or real work on a 7-inch screen </s>
<s> Apple came out with the iPad and every one copying the Kindle came oput with a pad, so why not Apple with a Nook/Kindle copy. </s>
<s> Quote from Steve Jobs. </s>
<s> I think this idea falls under that. </s>
<s> Apple would cannibalize sales of the 10 inch iPad, and I don't think they will do that. </s>
<s> They are also not interested in competing with Kindles and the other small tablets. </s>
<s> Remember Apple never produced a netbook. </s>
<s> As a product line, they were too cheap. </s>
<s> As for me, I already have an iPad, so no, I won't be interested. </s>
<s> I won't be buying another tablet until somebody comes out with a real tablet computer worth buying. </s>
<s> I mean something serious, not hobbled and tied to iTunes, a real tablet computer the size and weight of a iPad. </s>
<s> Tell me about that. </s>
<s> Why would I buy a product from a going to fade out company ? </s>
<s> This won't happen. </s>
<s> Apple cannot risk it's reputation of selling equipment for twice the going rate for similar equipment. </s>
<s> And, the Apple consumer would surely be disillusioned at paying less than the current 100% premium for the &quot;Apple&quot; logo. </s>
<s> It's called an iPod Touch. </s>
<s> You can call it an iPad Micro. </s>
<s> People seemed to have forgotten about he iPad. </s>
<s> Same OS as the iPad. </s>
<s> Same apps. </s>
<s> etc.. </s>
<s> But I would like something a little bit bigger, yet still fit in a pocket. </s>
<s> But hey, everyone seems to be so (dare I say this?) </s>
<s> &quot;big&quot; on small; so, why not go for a 1/2 inch screen? </s>
<s> Instead of carrying an MP3 player, tablet, cell phone, watch, pen, wallet, handkerchief, why not make it all one device? </s>
<s> Dick Tracy, anyone? </s>
<s> Seriously. </s>
<s> I don't even get the obsession with smaller. </s>
<s> Carrying something smaller is understandable, but, let's see, there's the I-Pod/Mp3 player, cell phone, and gadget after gadget. </s>
<s> While I am considering a tablet/e-reader, I fear the small screen will make it hard to actually read; and, watch TV or a movie from it? </s>
<s> On a 7-9 inch screen? </s>
<s> Really? </s>
<s> I enjoy the luxury of my 17&quot; laptop, for the one reason, i can actually see it. </s>
<s> But, that's just me. </s>
<s> On another note, I have been considering a Kindle Fire. </s>
<s> Has Amazon fixed their security issues? </s>
<s> Or, was that update just another worthless promise? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
