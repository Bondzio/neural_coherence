michael: thanks for the response.
let me see if i follow.
i am stuck with the usb connection to my desktop.
i had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working.
my isp (mediacom) and i troubleshot.
we ended up trying different ethernet cards, different cables, different modems and different pci slots to no avail.
when we switched to the usb it connected right away.
i am not disapointed with the speed or performance.
i would guess there is a setting or failure of some type at the computer as i can get the signal to the modem but not to the computer on the ethernet side.
are you saying that a wireless cable modem &quot;combo&quot; would be a route to go if it has an ethernet side for a laptop.
i am looking at a motorola sbg900 wireless modem.
it says it has a 802.11g wireless access point.
my thoughts were that i could keep the desktop cabled to the modem as it has a usb connection on the rear.
i thought that would eliminate the need for a wireless usb adaptor between the desktop and modem.
i would then add the notebook as a wireless connection to the ethernet side of the modem.
i'd end up with a physical cable connection from the modem to the desktop (usb) and a wireless connection from the laptop to the modem (ethernet??)
am i on the right track.
