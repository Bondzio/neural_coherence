I'm going off to college in the fall and I need to get myself a good MFC (All-in-one).
I would kind of like to stay away from HP because of all the crapware that comes bundled with their printer drivers.
I'm a little afraid to get a printer at all because of some of the reviews I've seen.
I would like to be able to print good-quality photos and good-quality text, which it seems are rarely found together in a printer these days.
A balance of quality and price is really what I'm looking for.
If anyone can aid me in my search, that would be great.
Thanks for any help, drummerboy
