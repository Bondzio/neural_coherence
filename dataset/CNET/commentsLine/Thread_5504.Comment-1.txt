i have the eee pc 1005ha-pu1x for use at a second home.....browsing the net, emails, word processing...using bluetooth to connect to my blackberry.
love it and works great.
now thinking of getting another for just 2 purposes.
checking emails and watching dvd's that i own and download(not hd)for use on plane trips and when traveling.
have been using my 4&quot; dell laptop but it is heavy and battery life is not that good.
my questions is can the above eee or 1001p-pu17 handle the watching of these downloads with only 1gb memory or do i have to upgrade to 2gb?
will i see any difference in quality, etc.?
thanks for the help and suggestions.
would consider another in the same price range, such as samsung n210 and/or n220.
or any others.
thoughts?
?
