<s> Hello - I just bought a new Thermaltake &quot;Max 4 - esata & usb combo&quot; along with a WD Caviar/Green 500GB SATA HD After assembly tried plug/play to a PC with MS/Vista OS; I tried first via USB then eSata -both tries- I do not see the drive in &quot;My Computer&quot;; however I see it under &quot;Device Manager/Disk Drives&quot;. </s>
<s> I thought that perhaps I needed to format the new drive but I do not get such an option by right-or-left clicking on the highlighted drive name. </s>
<s> What am I missing?? </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> make the new disk 'active' and then format/partition but i'm not familiar with Vista, so i may be mistaken jonah ., </s>
