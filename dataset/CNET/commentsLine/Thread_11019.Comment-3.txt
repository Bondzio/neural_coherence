i suppose a dark orange, but not too dark.
they are straight lines that go from the farmost right side to about half way.
i seem to notice them better when i open a window with a white background on the desktop.
i just bought the monitor about half a year ago.
i have an ati radeon 9600xt video card.
i just downloaded the latest catalyst drivers.
i haven't changed any settings besides the tv out configuration.
are there any changes i can make to fix the problem?
thanks!
