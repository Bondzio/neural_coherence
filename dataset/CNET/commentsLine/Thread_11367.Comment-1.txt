hello all, i am sure there is a very simple tweak tot his but i can't figure out.
i reinstalled my system recently and since then any video i play, it flickers.
it is a pain to watch any video.
i have refresh rate to max 75hz.
graphic card ati radeon xpress 200 is installed properly, can't see any conflict in device manager.
can anyone suggest the problem and the solution to fix it?
thanks
