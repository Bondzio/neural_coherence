My PC have 3.0Ghz AMD Duo processor and an NVIDIA GeForce 9800GT 512Mb graphics card installed. However, I don't know if my card is able to display videos with good resolution in such a huge monitor especially if I watch Blue-ray movies and play games in it. Does anybody have an idea? It would be great if you share it to me. I appreciate any suggestions and recommendations.
