i've been in the shop when an owner was allowed to show us what was wrong with their pc.
no surge occurred (we had many other pcs on the mains at the time) and their machine's psu failed taking every board and drive with it, there was a moment of silence and then people left the area so to not hurt their feelings.
so you'll never know what's dead until you test it.
