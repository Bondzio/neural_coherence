<s> I have one ethernet cable coming into a room but I have a PC and and Xbox 360 that I need to get online. </s>
<s> Does anyone make a splitter to divide the one cable? </s>
<s> Is it even possible? </s>
<s> Running another cable from the router can't be done, no room left. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Since the cable comes from a router, a simple switched hub should be fine. </s>
<s> I know there is a splitter but that's not what you want. </s>

<s> I got a D-Link, plugged it in and both were online. </s>
