i hope you have done the following: 1) load the latest and proper drivers for your video card 2) installed the .inf driver file for your monitor(if available) if this is a recent build, don't rely on what xp provides alone.
the 800x600 is default for basic usage within xp and other s/w.
however, if the video card(or port) and monitor each other's capabilities its a better install.
i do suggest you find out the video card maker, since you provide it as unknown.
here, may lie your fault, get a better driver or more complete driver set to best install it.
check under device mgr.
what it reports.
-or- use pcwizard 2011 to get details of your system, google for it.
tada -----willy
