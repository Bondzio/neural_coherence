On one machine is a DVD-ROM and I marked the drive as shared. But I still cannot access the ROM on the other machine. The shared drive is visible, but when I try to access it, it says, that \\othercomp\cd-dvd is not accessible. You might not have the permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. ??? Like I said, I marked the drive as shared. Thanks in advance. Regards, Mirza

Type secpol.msc in the run dialog box. In the left pane click Security Options and locate Devices:Restrict CD Rom... in the right pane. Dbl-click it and make sure it's disabled.
