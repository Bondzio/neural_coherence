If I install any new RAM other than what I used when I built my computer I can't use sleep mode. The reason why, is that when I try waking my computer up, my processor idles at 50% and windows becomes EXTREMELY unstable and I have to shut down. I have none of these issues when I boot up and my computer passes all stability tests. So there is something wrong with the motherboard somewhere. So my question is, should I install the new RAM and never use sleep mode, or keep my current RAM and be able to use sleep mode? And I don't want to rma the motherboard because if I am going to go through that hassle I will just buy a new, better motherboard.

You didn't supply any detail so here's just one of the dozen or so articles about this -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929734 Remember I have no details to work with. But it is a known problem with many versions of Windows. Bob

They tend to fix them when a computer maker like Dell wants to sell a box with Windows and the engineers get to work to find and patch the bug. Sorry but did you go looking in the KB (knowledge base) for your issue? I did it once just as an example and now it's your turn. Bob
