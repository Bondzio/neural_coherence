<s> I would like to upgrade my celeron processor to a Pentium 3 or 4, and would like to know more about doing so. </s>
<s> Will I need to change motherboards? </s>
<s> Any other info would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Since Socket 370 boards took a variety for Celeron and Pentium 3's and Socket 478 boards took a variety of Celeron and Pentium 4's the missing piece of information is: The make/model of the motherboard. </s>

<s> Intel 810 Chipset. </s>
<s> 370 Socket. </s>
<s> HP told me it wasn't upgradeable, I assume that means I'll have to change motherboards? </s>
<s> While you noted it's 810 based, a 370 socket and a HP, you left out which HP. </s>
<s> It would have been nice to know the model number of the machine to see if someone had a success story, but without more information, not only will you likely change the motherboard, but the power supply and case as well. </s>

<s> Sorry I didn't know you meant the PC model It's an HP 7915. </s>
<s> Also can I blame the slow boot time mostly on the processor? </s>
<s> Thank You. </s>

<s> Slow boots are defined as it's booting in minutes more than ever before. </s>
<s> You didn't tell the forum how many seconds its taking so in my estimation, that's not the issue. </s>
<s> 2. http://shopping.netledger.com/app/site/site.nl/site.ACCT72136/mode.items/sc.2/category.7/it.A/id.315/.f for example is a 100 MHz FSB CPU to fit such a machine. </s>
<s> But if this was my machine, I'd know that any 100 MHz FSB CPU might work. </s>
<s> I'd have to consider my risk quotient to see if I'd pop for this set: http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CEL130015-NB The problem here is that P3's move the FSB up to 133 and we can't tell if you can do that. </s>
<s> Sit the selection of possible items is the 219 dollar unit or this slightly faster Celeron. </s>
<s> My choice? </s>
<s> I wouldn't do this. </s>
