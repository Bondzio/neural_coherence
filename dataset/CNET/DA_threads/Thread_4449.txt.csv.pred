1.1.1	I recently had to get a whole new computer because my old one kept breaking.	St
1.1.2	I would like to put my old Hard Drive in as a slave just to get some of the information off of it.	St
1.1.3	Both Hard drives are SATA connections, and both have windows XP installed on them.	St
1.1.4	How do I put my old Hard Drive in as a slave so that the computer doesn't boot off of it?	St

1.4.1	Cessena, Look at the motherboard where the SATA drives are connected.	St
1.4.2	Each connection is numbered.	St
1.4.3	Usually starts with a zero.	St
1.4.4	Make sure your &quot;boot&quot; drive is in the lowest number and the 'old' drive is in a higer number.	St
1.4.5	POST will look at this sequentially at first.	St
1.4.6	Or, as your computer is POSTing (before the Windows logo appears, your screen should give you a chance (however small) to enter setup... usually by pressing the &lt;delete&gt; key several times during this initial start-up phase.	St
1.4.7	Once you are in setup... you will see the opportunity to change the boot sequence.	St
1.4.8	Select your desired drive here and continue the boot-up process.	St
1.4.9	Let us know, OK?	St
1.4.10	regards, Jack	St
