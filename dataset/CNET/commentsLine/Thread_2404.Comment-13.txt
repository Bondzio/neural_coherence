apparently rd400d77 does it all the time by choosing the hard drive to boot with in the bios setup.
precisely what i was hoping for.
however, my bios (or something) thinks that d: is my cd-rw.
maybe i can get around that with a new bios???
questions for rd400d77.
how did you load the os on your d: drive?
do you think you could load it by doing a restore from a backup of your c: drive?
could it be windows 2000 or xp?
can you boot your d: drive with your c: drive physically disconnected?
------------- bob proffitt suggests i may not want a pc.
much as i would like to revert to vms and leave windoze behind, that's not possible.
gates owns the world.
i'm trying to extend what i already have with windows 2000, not start over.
willy recalls vms 20 years ago with unit select plugs from ibm 30 years ago.
things have changed.
now at boot time, a configurable default physical disk is used, but you have the option of selecting any other disk on the system.
of course, it must have a boot block and a viable os on it.
the logical name sys points to the actual physical disk and all software looking for the boot disk simply addresses sys.
i'm hoping to find a similar bios-based solution.
linnux is not an important goal, just an example of what one could do with the capability.
all linnux alternate boot schemes i have seen apparently are just variations on the dual-boot idea which requires a working os in the c: drive and runs os software components from the c: drive.
