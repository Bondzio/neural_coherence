I'm want to utilize Bluetooth USB Adapters (pair) in place of the standard USB cable to connect a Desktop computer (running XP, SP3) to Cannon PIXMA MX330 IJ ALL-IN-1 Printer.
Is this even possible or is there an alternative that will work?
I want to place the printer somewhat remote (~35 FT) from the computer.
