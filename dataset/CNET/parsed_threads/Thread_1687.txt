<s> I installed 512k RAM yesterday and did not have the chip in totally. </s>
<s> Long story short, when i turned it back on smoke started to come from the motherboard. </s>
<s> I unplugged it immediately and after a few more tries got it fully in and it turned on with no problem. </s>
<s> Those few tries involved some beeping and a few odd sounds. </s>
<s> So it worked fine last night and this morning I was listening to internet radio and it just turned off. </s>
<s> I restarted and ten minutes later the screen turned multi-colored. </s>
<s> I started it again and backed up what I could and left it defragging this AM. </s>
<s> Am I totally screwed? </s>
<s> My comp is only 6 months old but I had no idea you could fry your MB by not putting the chip in fully. </s>
<s> I was fully grounded. </s>
<s> I thought that was the only concern. </s>
<s> Am I out the money? </s>
<s> Yes, this can be costly. </s>
<s> But in most cases, if a desktop, repair can be just the motherboard and/or CPU. </s>
<s> The reason why an incorrectly inserted board or part can fry components is simple. </s>
<s> Power is on some of the pins and the partial/incorrectly inserted part can send power to pins that can't take power. </s>
<s> A tactical error on your part is to run DEFRAG on a possibly damaged machine. </s>
<s> This is a great TEST of the hardware, but can result in a scrambled hard disk. </s>
<s> Installing the OS can outstrip most user skills. </s>
<s> Best of luck in your repairs. </s>

<s> &quot;Defrag..This is a great TEST of the hardware, but can result in a scrambled hard disk. </s>
<s> Installing the OS can outstrip most user skills.&quot; Well...too late now. </s>
<s> That really sux! </s>
<s> What does installing the OS do? </s>
<s> I did not quite understand your comment. </s>
<s> Should I do that? </s>
<s> Like a restore? </s>
<s> Your response shows that dealing with scrambled hard disk contents may outstrip your current PC repair skills. </s>
<s> In short, installing an OS is a series of steps that for Microsoft Windows is vaguely documented and doesn't seem to be repeatable across your machine and others. </s>
<s> In the end, the result is usually you flip the machine on and you see &quot;Windows.&quot; Or the OS you elected to install... What you do next depends on what you need to do and your capability. </s>
<s> In your first post, it was unclear if the machine finally died. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Does it still work? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Sorry, i left it still on this AM defragging. </s>
<s> It has come back on each time I tried. </s>
<s> So it is working as far as I left it two hrs ago. </s>
<s> I am extremely inexperienced. </s>
<s> I had installed RAM before but I guess you can't win them all. </s>
<s> So istalling a new MB would be a bad idea for me, yes? </s>
<s> Well, if I continue to use it until I can get someone to look at it am I causing furthur damage. </s>
<s> Should I just leave it off? </s>
<s> In no uncertain words, I would not put a stick into a machine I am not willing to sacrifice to test the stick... </s>
<s> If the machine works, then you can just use it. </s>
<s> My note about defragging being a dangerous idea swirls around other people that had bad ram and during defragmenting (with known bad ram) they ended up with a nonbooting system. </s>
<s> After such problems, defragging is best just put off till you know the system is healthy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, I know i am in over my head here. </s>
<s> I would have no worries if it had not shut off(once it went blank and once the screen scrambled) twice within ten minutes this morning. </s>
<s> Yes, it restarted each time, but I figure it will keep shutting off sporadically. </s>
<s> So I have read that you take each card out except video and test the computer to find out if it is the MB or a card you fried. </s>
<s> Maybe I should find an expert to look at it. </s>
<s> But a new dell 2400 cost about $350. </s>
<s> Would it be worth it to buy a new MB and have it installed professionally? </s>
<s> TESting RAM? </s>
<s> BTW, I never knew you had to test RAM . </s>
<s> I had an old system around the house but it wasn't the same so I figured the RAM would not work in it. </s>
<s> I got it from Crucial so I figured it would be good RAM. </s>
<s> Maybe good ram, bad operator.... </s>
<s> That's where shops and people with spare parts have it over the average owner. </s>
<s> They can swap an item out and see if that's it. </s>
<s> As to TESTING RAM, my comment was what to do with that stick. </s>
<s> I rarely have to test new RAM and in fact, don't. </s>
<s> My comment was that if a stick of RAM was subjected to such an event, then I would not want to try it in another machine unless it was a GUINEA PIG or SHOP SPECIAL that we use to test parts in. </s>
<s> Usually its some offbeat lintball of parts that if it smokes, we haven't lost anything of value. </s>
<s> At 350 bucks, you will find it difficult to beat that if the motherboard and CPU is toast and you have to pay the TECH and SHOP fees as well. </s>
<s> In the meantime, pull the cover off and make sure the CPU heatsink is in place and all fans are spinning... Bob </s>

<s> &quot;In the meantime, pull the cover off and make sure the CPU heatsink is in place and all fans are spinning...&quot; Ok, what is the heatsink? </s>
<s> I know where the fan is and can check that. </s>
<s> BTW, could I use hardware like CD-RW drive, floppy drive, etc in my new machine. </s>
<s> Or are they damaged? </s>
<s> Thank you for helping me out. </s>
<s> I have a question for R. Profit regarding defragging. </s>
<s> What about third party defrag programs like Voptme or Diskkeeper (any version) would you recommend defrag only after system is working normally. </s>
<s> I'm curious as to how this affects a system in a bad way. </s>
<s> My note about defragging on a suspect or damaged PC is not what I find to be an issue with normal machines. </s>
<s> I note it since I've seem people report a memory error, then they defragment and we never see them again... Bob </s>
