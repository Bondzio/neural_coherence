4349	4	35012	404952	404809	Ray Harinec	8/30/04 1:41 PM	1.09387326E12	put cpu	heatsink comes paste put manufacturing process knows exactly where cpu mate heatsink extremely important amds intels especially using thermal paste electrically conductive study assembly cpu center heatsink due fact heatsink covers part cpu socket nothing allow clamping system use apply uniform force across surface amds four spacers prevent crushing small cpu intel heat spreader gives larger surface fact cases where hsf put backwards amd cpus touched part cpu cpu overtemped fast intels heat spreader makes less problem
