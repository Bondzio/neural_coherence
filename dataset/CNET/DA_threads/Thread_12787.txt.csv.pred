1.1.1	I have a intel 82852/82855 gm/gme on my notebook this card works great but I was wondering if anyone knows how I can display different video sources for the display on the notebook and the s=video out ?	Ques
1.1.2	for example Id like to be able to play a video on the TV through the s-video and still be able to run other aplications like internet on the notebook display without the application showing on the TV .	St
1.1.3	I hope this is understandable .	St
1.2.1	I guess I jumped the gun on this one and found a product called UltraMon that works ok for what I was looking for if anyone was researching this tankyou for your time ! !	St
1.2.2	!	St
