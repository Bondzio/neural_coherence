even if you bought the best video card out there...ultimatly the framerate is regulated by the game itself.
it will only go so fast and that is it...so game mfg's recommend certain cards...probably have some deal going with card mfg's....i havent found any games that are not compatible with my nvidia 5200..just make sure that you have a big enough card to run the games you want.... (example-a 32mb card will play ms flight 4...kinda..most of the game isnt rendered just by lack of memory).
my card is a 256mb gainward nvidia card that i paid 80 bucks for new and works with what ever i throw at it.
i dont think i will out grow that card for a long time to come...good luck and i hope it helped
