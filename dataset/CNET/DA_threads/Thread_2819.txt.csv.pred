1.1.1	I have Windows XP .	St
1.1.2	I have fdisk 'd the hard drive and reinstalled Windows XP and at some random point after XP is installed .	St
1.1.3	I start getting errors on boot up and some programs wo n't open .	St
1.1.4	I believe it is a bad sector on the harddrive , but not sure how to fix it with XP .	St
1.1.5	It could also be bad RAM .	St
1.1.6	I might have an old memory stick to swap out and try .	St
1.1.7	The processor is an INTEL P4 3.2ghz ( Preston chip ) if that matters .	St
1.2.1	Your hard drive manufacturer should have a diagnostic utility that will test the drive for possible damage .	St
1.2.2	These are usually non-destructive processes .	St
1.2.3	Often HD manufacturer 's use these to validate warranty claims by having the user run the utility which returns a code describing the health of the drive .	St
1.2.4	Download and run the utility .	St
1.2.5	As for RAM , free diagnostics are also available .	St
1.2.6	Use google to look up MemTest or memory testers .	St
1.2.7	There are a couple of good ones that will create a boot floppy or an .iso that can be burned to a CD ROM disk .	St
1.2.8	They work well .	St
1.2.9	If your problem is memory or the HD , these free utilities will let you know .	St
1.3.1	should have reported bad sectors and locked them out as part of the full format .	St
1.3.2	Analyze the disk using disk management and see if it reports a bad sector or locked sectors .	St
1.3.3	You can as you stated swap out memory modules to test those besides memtest ( but still a good idea ) .	St
1.3.4	Running disk diagnostics is limited if it not allowed to actually write to all sectors , such as to your disk .	St
1.3.5	If in doubt get a new drive copy everything over ( Ghost or new drives utilities ) , reformat the old one and use it for backup unless its bad .	St
1.4.1	once a sector goes more are soon to follow , bite the bullet and just get a new one and transfer the data .	St
1.5.1	Here is a link to SpinRite , a Gibson Research HDD maintenance & repair software program : http : //www.grc.com/sroverview.htm The downloadable program needs to boot your system from a floppy or CD .	St
1.5.2	If you do n't have a floppy drive , you 'll need burning software that can create a bootable ISO image CD .	St
1.5.3	SpinRite analyzes your HDD ( or even floppies ) sector by sector , removing and recovering data from a bad sector to a good one , and quarantines the bad sector from future use .	St
1.5.4	SpinRite will also warn you of a failing HDD , hopefully in plenty of time to either save your data or clone your HDD to a new drive .	St
1.5.5	It will also work on TIVO hard drives , although you have to connect the HDD the drive from the TIVO to your computer .	St
1.5.6	The only downside is the price .	St
1.5.7	$ 89 for the download , but when compared to the cost , downtime and inconvenience of dealing with a failed Hard Drive , it 's cheap .	St
1.5.8	If you need to clone your HDD to a new drive , I recommend Acronis .	St
1.5.9	They have a free trial period so you could probably do a quick hit & run to check it out : http : //www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/index.html	Sug
1.6.1	Oops , forgot to mention that if you have a Seagate or Maxtor hard drive , the Acronis & quot ; Migrate Easy & quot ; cloning program from Acronis True Image is available free from Seagate 's download website : http : //www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/ See the & quot ; data migration & quot ; heading to download DiskWizard for Seagate drives , or MaxBlast for Maxtor drives .	St
1.6.2	Note to old timers : This is NOT the old Maxtor data transfer program for a new HDD that never worked right .	St
1.6.3	It is actually Acronis ' Migrate Easy .	St
1.7.1	I expect the answer to this is going to be & quot ; because there are better alternatives & quot ; .	St
1.7.2	I run an error check on my hard drive virtually every week .	St
1.7.3	It 's supposed to look for and fix bad sectors and file system errors .	St
1.7.4	I once had a Word document go bad on me and lost an entire edition of a magazine that I had stored to floppy .	St
1.7.5	This utility also works on floppies , so I had a chance to see it in action .	St
1.7.6	It restored my damaged file - even though it put in some squiggly marks to indicate unrestorable damage .	St
1.7.7	I got that edition back though , essentially intact .	St
1.7.8	As a complete novice I assumed , hopefully , that the same utility would also do a similar repair if I got a bad sector on my hard drive .	St
1.7.9	In case I did n't use the correct name I 'm talking about the checking utility that you get by clicking & quot ; my computer & quot ; then right clicking on & quot ; C & quot ; drive or whichever drive you want to check , click properties , select & quot ; tools & quot ; tab and then click & quot ; check now & quot ; for error checking .	St
1.7.10	Then check the two boxes , restart the pc and wait ... ... . while the drive is checked .	Sug
1.7.11	Then run a disk clean up to get rid of any check disk fragments .	St
1.7.12	So I expect you techie people will now tell me why this is n't the best way to fix things .	St
1.7.13	Mostly I get told that Microsoft utilities are n't as good as XYZ alternatives .	St
1.7.14	My laptop is getting on a bit and so I might need this information myself one day .	St
1.8.1	Sometimes you have to keep it simple on things like this .	St
1.8.2	Do what is the more likely and progress from there .	St
1.8.3	Microsoft had an update recently that broke a lot of drivers and I had to restore to fix the problem .	St
1.8.4	Sometimes you can boot up - but have errors like yours .	St
1.8.5	However , in my experience I have seen these things happen in this order of likelyhood : 1 .	St
1.8.6	Sometimes a simple scan disk with both repair options checked can fix the problem ; followed by defragmentation .	St
1.8.7	2 .	St
1.8.8	Malware recently infected can be the problem but others here have already covered this .	St
1.8.9	3 .	St
1.8.10	I already assume you did n't replace any hardware but Microsoft and driver updates can cause problems with the boot process .	St
1.8.11	A quick check of the Device Manager for & quot ; splats & quot ; on your hardware is well worth looking at .	Sug
1.8.12	If there are any yellow ?	Ques
1.8.13	signs then it is time to have it scan for hardware changes , update the driver , or reinstall the driver .	St
1.8.14	If this does n't work go to the vendor for that device and download updates .	St
1.8.15	Make sure XP is fully updated before doing this .	St
1.8.16	4 .	St
1.8.17	Now it is time to try the most likely reason your having problems ; but this will take more effort and so I list it last .	St
1.8.18	Some hard disks need to be low level formated with their in-house disk utility before the operating system is installed , if you do n't do this from the get go , the disk geometry can be off set and can cause serious problems later ; including loss of all data .	St
1.8.19	The advise to use the original manufacturers diagnostic utility is a good one ; but remember if you do n't find anything physically wrong with the hard disk , you may have to start over and format the hard drive with the manufacturers utility .	St
1.8.20	Usually this is on the same disk as the diagnostic utility .	St
1.8.21	All major manufacturers usually have a floppy or CD maker download so you can make the disk ( s ) yourself .	St
1.8.22	I have had better luck with the ones that burn a CD-ROM as a more complete formating of the MBR area is done more easily that way .	St
1.8.23	5 .	St
1.8.24	There are many RAM test utilities that can check your RAM modules .	St
1.8.25	The vendor there again is the best source but I have had great luck just using the top rated utilities here on CNET at download.com .	St
1.8.26	This is also well worth the time compared to messing inside your system units .	St
1.9.1	The RAM test discovered a problem .	St
1.9.2	I replaced the memory and so far so good .	St
1.9.3	I 've been able to get past the place that I would most often error .	St
1.9.4	So I think its fixed .	St
1.9.5	Thanks for all the great troubleshooting advice .	Polite
1.9.6	I will hopefully retain some of that if I have future hardware problems .	St
1.10.1	nt	St
