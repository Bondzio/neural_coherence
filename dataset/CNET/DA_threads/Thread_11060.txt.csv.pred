1.1.18	-- I have n't upgraded .	St
1.1.19	-- I do n't do Windows .	St
1.2.1	BTW , running 64 bit Win7 .	St
1.3.1	I upgraded from XP to Windows 7 and was thrilled .	St
1.3.2	The OS actually worked , and ALL my printers , scanners and everything worked as soon as I plugged it in .	St
1.3.3	Even my old Canon BJC 85 portable printer .	St
1.3.4	Worked perfect without downloading drivers or programming ( which by the way was not available with Vista . )	St
1.4.1	Even though hardware makers said they were not going to create drivers for either 32 or 64 bit Vista , when you install the peripheral , Vista went out on the Internet and found drivers that worked just fine with them .	St
1.4.2	I even installed a 10 year old Laser printer that had a regular printer input .	St
1.4.3	I was able to get an adapter cable that converted from a printer cable 50 pin output to USB .	St
1.4.4	I was surprised to find that Vista actually installed a printer for this old war horse of a printer .	St
1.4.5	It also installed a printer than I though that I was n't going to be able to use to work with both Vista and Windows 7 .	St
1.4.6	Both of those programs are very user friendly for installing printers and other peripherals that you might think would work with these new peripherals .	St
1.5.1	I have upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate ( 32 ) on my laptop and just finished building a new desktop with Windows 7 ( 64 ) .	St
1.5.2	Did n't have any trouble obtaining drivers for any of my peripherals , though none are older than 3 years .	St
1.5.3	I might just add here that I am basically a Microsoft hater , but I think they may have finally gotten Windows right with Windows7 .	St
1.6.1	Everything has worked just fine , even my old Dell Axim pocket PC .	St
1.6.2	Windows 7 ( in a new Dell machine ) automatically downloaded a driver for it .	St
1.6.3	I had to download a driver for an Hp laser 1020 .	St
1.7.1	The old HP scanner on the XP system just could n't be coaxed to work with Vista 64 .	St
1.7.2	Neither HP nor any other source had advice other than buy a new scanner .	St
1.7.3	So I did .	St
1.7.4	Works much better than the old one .	St
1.7.5	John Blair	St
1.8.1	Lee , A couple of years ago I upgraded to a new computer with Windows Vista .	St
1.8.2	Downloaded new drivers for Epson scanner and HP printer .	St
1.8.3	They worked fine .	St
1.8.4	However , Wacom had discontinued my digital tablet model and no driver was available .	St
1.8.5	I was forced to buy a new tablet .	St
1.8.6	It added around $ 150 to the cost of the upgrade .	St
1.8.7	Annoying , but I got over it .	St
1.8.8	: o/ Jim in sunny Florida	St
1.9.1	I 'm getting close to retiring a Seagate external drive , once I find some way to inspect its contents for anything I may have missed .	St
1.9.2	The bummer is this thing is less than a year old .	St
1.9.3	I 'm certain it 's a driver issue , but nothing they offer helps .	St
1.9.4	So it goes .	St
1.10.1	Only one a Hp Scanner about 6 years old .	St
1.10.2	It was n't so much replacing the scanner it was the attitude of the guy I spoke to at HP .	St
1.10.3	He was of the opinion that as my scanner was so old I should by a new one , even though on XP it worked perfectly .	St
1.10.4	Yes I bought a new scanner .	St
1.10.5	No it was not a HP	St
1.11.1	I have kept my desktop as XP Professional , and will do so until the cartridges are finished .	St
1.11.2	I would have to buy a new laser printer so am hoping this one will last quite awhile longer .	St
1.11.3	It would be great if there were new drivers to work with my Vista 64 bit laptop .	St
1.11.4	.	St
1.11.5	.	St
1.11.6	If anyone knows of any I would love to hear where to find them .	St
1.12.1	I lost two hp printers and my diabetes meter .	St
1.12.2	I did n't really care too much about the printers , but to not be able to interface my meter has been a real pain .	St
1.12.3	I must now wait to get to my doctor to down load my readings .	St
1.12.4	would have been nice if the meter company ad upgraded their software to work with vista 64 or microsoft made vista 64 truly xp compatable .	St
1.13.1	I can use my Sony MD Walkman .	St
1.13.2	Uses mini-disks .	St
1.14.1	All I seem to have lose are some games I bought when I had XP .	St
1.14.2	They worked fine on Vista but not on window 's 7 64 bit & the 32 bit ? ? ?	Ques
1.14.3	HP-Pavilion AW17AV-ABA e9200z Desktop 2.60 gigahertz AMD Athlon ll X4 620	St
1.15.1	All my peripherals worked with Win7 , 3 Printers , an older HP Laserjet , Epson Wide format inkjet , A Canon inkjet .	St
1.15.2	Also found drivers for an old Epson Scanner .	St
1.15.3	The best part , I turned everything on before install and Win7 found them all , one worked with Vista 64bit driver .	St
1.15.4	Even an 11 year old program that would n't install with Vista , works fine with Win7 .	St
1.15.5	Win7 the best upgrade yet .	St
1.16.1	My not so venerable t5 is not compatible with Win 7 ( 64 ) and even though I tried the bluetooth connection it was not successful .	St
1.16.2	After a couple of months of this and that..	St
1.16.3	I simply dual boot - using my WIN XP partition when I have to backup or install stuff on my Palm .	St
1.16.4	Eventually I will find a PDA device that does what I want with Win 7 .	St
1.16.5	Because of work related security issues I ca n't use a cell phone device so the smart phones are out ... although I think the Ipod Touch will apps will handle the program requirments.. TOO BAD PALM..	St
1.17.1	none-as yet	St
1.18.1	I was running Vista 32 bit when it first came out and an old Canon printer would work , but the Vista would n't accept the drivers for it or the software for it .	St
1.18.2	Also an off brand webcam would work , but not the software or drivers for it .	St
1.18.3	I could use it for Yahoo Messenger , but no adjustments could be made .	St
1.18.4	Same with the New Windows 7 64 bit system .	St
1.18.5	Both would work , but only partially .	St
1.19.1	For me , it was a few pieces of software that have gone by the wayside .	St
1.19.2	But unlike Vista , which was a real pain , my printer was up and running within minutes .	St
1.20.1	HP scanjet 4200 flatbed scanner .	St
1.20.2	The only thing I have not tried is going into XP mode and trying to install it there .	St
1.20.3	64 bit 7 Ultimate with new motherboard CPU and RAM .	St
1.21.1	I like Windows 7 a lot !	St
1.21.2	But I 'm disappointed with Canon , who chose to abandon their old color laser installed base by not providing 64-bit drivers .	St
1.21.3	My LBP5000 still has more than 50 % of its original toner , but I now need to copy files over to an old notebook if I want to print to it .	St
1.21.4	A software casualty of the move to 64-bit computing was my wife 's beloved PrintMaster - the replacement of which by an incompatible name-alike has left many loyal long-time users without a home DTP option - especially when Microsoft 's Office Home and Student Edition does n't include Publisher .	St
1.22.1	I started with Vista 64bit by H.P .	St
1.22.2	New H.P. # 5180 Photosmart Up graded to Windows 7 has Vista sp1 messed up big time ned	St
1.23.1	I have searched numerous sites for a driver for my 64bit Win 7 OS to no avail .	St
1.23.2	The manufacturers site times out when I try to reach it looking for a new driver .	St
1.23.3	Various sites answer when I search but they all require their Scanning Program to be installed and with no guarantee that they actually have a driver .	St
1.23.4	There is absolutely nothing else I think I can do .	St
1.23.5	I have tried the 3000 and 7000 scanner drivers but they do n't work .	St
1.23.6	Maybe this scanner is just due to be retired Any help will be valued .	St
1.23.7	M.Mcx	St
1.24.1	The only device giving some headache when I changed system to Windows 7 64 bit was a CanoScan D646U ex scanner but it operates normally in the virtual XP Mode , which can be downloaded from Microsoft , assuming your processor supports the Virtual Technology .	St
1.24.2	It seems that Canon is n't overall very fond of making new drivers for old devices .	St
1.24.3	My friend had a Mulifunction printer and Canon has no Windows 7 drivers for it .	St
1.24.4	32 bit Vista drivers exist but these wo n't work in 64 bit machine , otherwise it would be worth a try .	St
1.24.5	But my opinion is still that 64 bit is the way to go .	St
1.24.6	On my second machine based on a Intel Q8200 Quad Core processor , 4 GB RAM I had XP before changing to Win 7 64 bit .	St
1.24.7	It became a totally different machine , faster , smoother and very joyable .	St
1.25.1	None	St
1.26.1	I moved from 32-bit Windows XP to 64-bit Vista when it first came out and it worked with al of my hardware .	St
1.26.2	When I made the move from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 in college I found that some of my hardware did n't work .	St
1.26.3	I noticed that all of my hardware that had been sold with the Windows logo on it ( WHQL Certified ) worked fine .	St
1.26.4	Some of the hardware I had picked up from other computer stores did n't .	St
1.26.5	So after that I figured I would be better off with hardware that was WHQL Certified .	St
1.26.6	When I made the move from XP to Vista all of my WHQL hardware moved over just find .	St
1.26.7	Additionally my Windows Certified software all moved fine and had none of those problems with the Allow/Deny prompts that many people reported .	St
1.26.8	The WHQL drivers from XP worked on Vista .	St
1.26.9	Overall the transition was smooth .	St
1.27.1	A perfectly good printer , half full cartridges , over half the life of the rest of the consumables , and it is garbage on my Windows 7 64 bit PC .	St
1.27.2	Microsoft Windows 7 compatibility site says & quot ; info coming soon & quot ; .	St
1.27.3	It 's been like that for months .	St
1.27.4	At least I kept my trusty XP and it works there .	St
1.28.1	I had to retire one external backup drive because W7 would n't load the software .	St
1.28.2	W7 cost me over 75 % of my software and still have n't found an Adobe Photoshop replacement .	St
1.29.1	I read somewhere on the 'net that a scanner that has film scanning built in interacts directly with the OS in such a way that wo n't work with Vista or 7 .	St
1.29.2	Same scanner would not work on iMac running OSX .	St
1.29.3	I did n't give up on the 4200f , I keep a hard drive with XP that I only boot to run that scanner .. and a 2001 copy of Picture it !	St
1.29.4	publishing .	St
1.30.1	We had an expensive 3 year-old HP Printer/Scanner/Copier/Fax .	St
1.30.2	Could n't find a driver so we called HP support .	St
1.30.3	The guy 's attitude was clearly that they ca n't be bothered to support existing products more than two years old , so go buy a new printer .	St
1.30.4	We bought a Canon and have been very pleased with it 's quality and lower ink cost than HP .	St
1.30.5	That has saved us a lot of money .	St
1.30.6	Now , we 've upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit and guess what ?	Ques
1.30.7	Canon had new drivers available for us , no problem .	St
1.30.8	I wonder how many customers HP has blown off with their attitude ?	Ques
1.31.1	I was able to make it work from windows updgrade , but decided that I wanted the full support of the Mulifuncion capabilities , so I went with the Vista 64 bits full download drivers and installed that on my 64 bits Windows 7 Pro , no problems and got back the PC Fax at the same time .	St
1.31.2	I just have praise with Windows PS that printers is fairly old i.e .	St
1.31.3	4 years old at least .	St
1.32.1	Earlier I was using my Intel PIII 1.0 GHz since Jun 2001 , 02 years back updated to EE Intel processor with 1 GB Graphics from N-Vidia and 4 GB RAM and SATA 500GB and VIsta Ultimate , but as I started using Full HD Monitor so neither monitor supported my old HP3400C ( Scanner ) and lexmark Z32 Printer nor the OS , receently switched over to Win 7 Ultimate that too failed .	St
1.32.2	But presenly , I got a new all in one which both way helped my space , headache for upgradation and money at the same time .	St
1.32.3	So , anyway thanx to Microsoft for letting customers upgrade forcibly for their benefit as well Microsoft 's business .	St
1.33.1	When I installed Wins 7 32 bit on the release date , all my peripherals worked correctly .	St
1.33.2	On 4/10/10 , I upgraded to the 64 bit version of Win 7 .	St
1.33.3	So far everthing is working with no hitches .	St
1.33.4	This includes my 10 year old scanner .	St
1.33.5	Either all the driver updates were included with Win 7 or my automatic driver updates ran .	St
1.34.1	Personally , I lost my printer and scanner , and Vista thought that I ought to buy a new video camera as well .	St
1.34.2	A lot of my customers also had to replace equipment .	St
1.34.3	I do n't mind so much the old stuff , but some of the things that I had to replace were still new , or even pruchased after Vista came out .	St
1.34.4	I think that retailers should have to make it clear that an item wo n't work with a current OS , or that I only works with the 32-bit version of the OS that is listed on the box .	St
1.35.1	Trick , Hi if you have pro you can use the Palm , I have that and work perfectly for me for sync .	St
1.35.2	Just in case you were not aware of this possibility .	St
1.36.1	The only real problem was my beloved Combat Flight Simulator 2 game .	St
1.36.2	When we got the new Vista laptop in 2008 , I 'd hoped its faster components , portability , and 4MB RAM would be an improvement over our 2001 1MB RAM desktop 's game performance problems .	St
1.36.3	Much to my chagrin after the purchase , I was warned not to try running the game on Vista .	St
1.36.4	So I have n't , and it 's been a real bummer , esp .	St
1.36.5	since I struggled with whether to order the laptop with XP or Vista in the first place , and had waited for MS to get most of the bugs out of Vista and put plenty of RAM aboard to handle it .	St
1.36.6	Otherwise , once we got used to Vista , it works fine for us , with none of the common issues people originally griped about .	St
1.37.1	Only 1 , a HP Deskjet 990cxi Printer .	St
1.37.2	No new drivers for that model .	St
1.38.1	All my devices and software work on W7 except my Epson scanner , there is n't a 64 bit driver	St
1.39.1	When I was upgrading to Windows 7 , I had to retire : 1 .	St
1.39.2	My ADSL Router : It was connected to USB port and had no driver for Windows 7 ; neither 32-bit nor 64-bit .	St
1.39.3	2 .	St
1.39.4	My Sound System : It was a SoundMax integrated sound chip on my ASUS P5LD2 SE motherboard .	St
1.39.5	There is only beta driver available for it that works with Windows Vista and Windows 7 but is very quirky .	St
1.39.6	Windows Update immediately updates to Microsoft High-Definition Somethin ' and takes away a lot of its features including recording .	St
1.39.7	3 .	St
1.39.8	My old IDE hard disk .	St
1.39.9	This hard disk was too slow for Windows 7 .	St
1.39.10	My HP ScanJet 3128 also lost its enhanced driver which was not compatible with Windows 7 and is now using a basic WIA driver .	St
1.39.11	I also had to retire my Diskeeper and Kaspersky Internet Security because they were incompatible with Windows 7 .	St
1.40.1	The only thing I lost moving to Windows 7 was my SCSI installation- an Adaptec 2960 card plus three peripherals-an HP tape drive HP stopped supporting many years ago , and two hard drives .	St
1.40.2	Adaptec stopped supporting all SCSI cards without explanation-typical company behavior-the hell with people who have their equipment .	St
1.40.3	They are now all SATA RAID all the time now .	St
1.40.4	A canny business decision that damns the customer as usual .	St
1.40.5	Windows 7 works okay but like all Windows OS 's it eats fabulous amounts of memory and CPU during normal operation .	St
1.40.6	If I try to do things like move down a page while Windows 'draws ' icons on the desktop or something similar-it 's Blue Screen of Death time .	St
1.40.7	Not the first Windows version with this problem .	St
1.41.1	I was not able to use my Dazzle Video Creater ( to capture VHS on my computer ) .	St
1.41.2	I upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit from Vista 32-bit .	St
1.41.3	That is not so bad as I am retiring my XP computer and will be keeping my Vista as the second computer in our home .	St
1.42.1	There are two models of this , so a 50/50 chance of habing a compatible device .	St
1.42.2	Check the Logitech site for details , I was very disppo9inted .	St
1.43.1	My Epson Scanner , for which Epson refuses to provide drivers .	St
1.43.2	Guess which brand I will NOT be buying when I replace it .	St
1.44.1	How did you connect the HP laserjet and what drivers did you need to download .	St
1.44.2	I have a Laserjet that is probably twice as old and would hate to retire it .	St
1.44.3	It is an HP Laserjet 4L .	St
1.45.1	Had to retire a wireless adapter and an external hard drive .	St
1.45.2	Checked the websites for both products and no 64 bit drivers were available .	St
1.45.3	Apparently , they want to sell new equipment .	St
1.45.4	It also affected the way I download from my Canon EOS 10D camera .	St
1.45.5	Suprisingly , Canon is not supplying a driver either .	St
1.45.6	I did n't have to retire this device as the solution has been to remove the memory card and have the PC read it directly .	St
1.46.1	I am another retiree and am still having multiple problems upgrading to a ( relatively ) new Windows XP system , so much so that I recently bought a secondhand 2000 Pro machine .	St
1.46.2	This op sys seems far more user friendly - why did they ever abandon it ?	Ques
1.46.3	- and it has brought a lot of my old software friends back into reliable use again .	St
1.46.4	I am now wondering whether to abandon or downgrade ( upgrade to Windows 2000 Pro ? )	Ques
1.46.5	my Compaq Windows XP machine .	St
1.46.6	Currently I have not dared trying to use my HP 35mm slide scanner with anything but my very old Windows 98SE machine , with which it works like a charm .	St
1.46.7	It would probably work just as well with Windows 2000 Pro , but I would be very grateful if one of your other readers can tell me if this is so before I even start trying to install the SCSI interface board .	St
