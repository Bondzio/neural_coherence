<s> I was able to obtain some free office equipment that consisted of a Netgear wireless bridge and an Axis Communications print server. </s>
<s> Is it possible to create a wireless print server on my home network through a Wireless-G Linksys Router without having to go out and buy a wireless print server? </s>
<s> I can configure the bridge and printer server seperately via direct connection to the router, but could not get anything to print when I hooked up the printer server to the bridge through a crossover cable. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Setup can be an itch. </s>
