<s> Hey everyone I am having trouble with my budget CISNET computer that I got around late March in 2005. </s>
<s> It all started today. </s>
<s> I was using the system fine all last night and into this morning. </s>
<s> I took a nap, and got up to search something on the internet. </s>
<s> When I got to my PC I found it shutdown. </s>
<s> I turned on the On button and it didn't turn on my PC. </s>
<s> The funny thing is, the same thing happened to me last November. </s>
<s> I went out and when I came back I found the PC shutdown and no way to turn it on. </s>
<s> When this happened to me in November, I had to send the PC for repairs. </s>
<s> I got the PC back in late December and now I am in the same jam. </s>
<s> To me it seems the same problem has occured. </s>
<s> So this is the situation. </s>
<s> The PC won't turn on at all. </s>
<s> I have tried it on another outlet and that didn't work. </s>
<s> The odd thing is, on the back of the PC the ethernet port continues to light up even after the PC is shutdown. </s>
<s> I have my DSL ethernet cable in that ethernet port and it continues to light up. </s>
<s> I realized one thing after I got my PC from repairs. </s>
<s> My heatsink/fan got really noisy. </s>
<s> I could feel my hand shake when I laid my hand on my computer desk. </s>
<s> The PC itself was just terrible noisy. </s>
<s> Roughly about 3 days ago it got alot quiter which I found strange. </s>
<s> I popped off the side panel and I found no damage or burns. </s>
<s> The heatsink/fan is made by Coolermaster. </s>
<s> Everything looks good and I see no problems. </s>
<s> I did notice that there was alot of dust on the heatsink/fan. </s>
<s> I took off the HS/F and underneath it I saw thermalpaste. </s>
<s> I blew the HS/F a little to get the dust and placed it back on the board. </s>
<s> I did not however reapply thermalpaste on the HS/F. </s>
<s> After everything, the PC still won't turn on. </s>
<s> So really nothing in the PC will turn on. </s>
<s> The fans, nothing. </s>
<s> As I have said, the same thing happened back in November. </s>
<s> I want to avoid sending the PC for repairs again because they will reformat my hard drive and it gets annoying to re-install everything. </s>
<s> My PC specs are a P4 processor, Buffalo 512mb DDR RAM, WIndows XP SP2, DVD burner, a 120gb hard drive, media card reader, and that is about it.I haven't added anything on the PC. </s>
<s> All help is appreciated and thanks for any help. </s>
<s> When I have a dead machine. </s>
<s> I strip it down to 4 parts to get BEEPS. </s>
<s> Just the power supply, motherboard, CPU/HSF and the speaker. </s>
<s> If no BEEPS, then I'm looking at the 4 possible bad parts or a dead CMOS battery. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Added to your list of starting small is a 120gb hard dive, optical drive, and a media card reader. </s>
<s> I'll strip down the PC and report back. </s>
<s> Those items could stop the 4 items from beeping. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Would that be repairs under CISNET? </s>
<s> Because they obviously did not fix the problem. </s>
<s> You have to take advantage of that nice full-year warranty under CISNET. </s>
<s> Not many manufacturers offer that much. </s>
<s> It is around 10:16 ET. </s>
<s> I'll try the test and see what I come up with. </s>
<s> I have very aware if the gnerous full year warranty. </s>
<s> Companies usually provide 3 months or a little more. </s>
<s> I first had this problem in late November. </s>
<s> I sent it to CISNET repairs and got it back in late Decmeber and now have the same problem again in early February. </s>
<s> I think I must be doing something wrong if the same exact problem happened again. </s>
<s> I never touched the inside of the PC until Sunday and I saw no damage in the PC. </s>
<s> I had the PC run through a UPS and that didn't stop anything. </s>
<s> I am going to perform a bee test if I hear anything. </s>
<s> Something new just happened. </s>
<s> Ok as I powered up the PC, I heard no beeps. </s>
<s> I then looked over at everything, and at a particular corner of my heatsink/fan I smelled a pretty strong burning smell. </s>
<s> As I stated earlier, the heatsink/fan was getting alot quieter toward the last fews days the PC was alive. </s>
<s> If I just replace heatsink/fan wil the PC continue to work or has the damage to the processor already been damaged? </s>
<s> Hi all I am running XP on Gigabyte motherboard with intel 4 3ghz. </s>
<s> 200 gb hdd.When I click start then try to shut down nothing happens. </s>
<s> It won't restart either. </s>
<s> It's got me stuffed. </s>
<s> Any help here would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> It would be better to start a new topic. </s>
<s> But I would say that your computer is having trouble shutting down some applications. </s>
<s> Go to your taskbar and start shutting down programs, usually by right-clicking and clicking exit. </s>
<s> Or press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and go to the processes tab. </s>
<s> Then click User Name to sort by the names. </s>
<s> ONLY shut down items under your user name, and use a little common sense. </s>
<s> Some one blamed a person who told them to shutdown everything and the person shut down WINWORD.EXE and lost his work. </s>
<s> It's arguable, but I just want to tell you. </s>
<s> Make sure you save anything that is open. </s>
<s> Then try shutting down the computer. </s>

<s> I just got a Cisnet computer, set it up Thursday last week, by Sunday it only opens in recovery mode. </s>
<s> I hope this is not going to be a lemon. </s>
<s> I got this system because the e-machine I had at work crashed, the repair guy said it was a power surge. </s>
<s> I could not turn it on or off. </s>
<s> It was running and on and we went to work and next coffee break we came back and it was dead so to speak. </s>
<s> Also I need to know can you download Microsoft softwear like word 2002 onto a Cisnet? </s>
<s> I found when I set up that there is no Word or Spreadsheet on my new Cisnet--first of 5 computers I ever bought without these features. </s>
<s> Thank You. </s>

<s> What's happening with your pc at this time? </s>
<s> I just repaired a pc with a power supply fan problem. </s>
<s> The power supply was fine. </s>
<s> The user stated she smelled something burning inside the pc. </s>
<s> First instinct was to look at the back of the pc where the power supply fan was. </s>
<s> The power supply fan had stopped, but the pc was still running. </s>
<s> It would be a matter of time before the pc became erratic or the insides fried because of the heat. </s>
<s> Heat does wierd things to computers If the air flow is not venting. </s>
<s> You mentioned you suspect the processor may be half fried. </s>
<s> Radio Shack sells heat sink paste. </s>
<s> But before you do anything, if the unit is still under warranty let the repair folks know &quot;there is a problem here (still).&quot; </s>
