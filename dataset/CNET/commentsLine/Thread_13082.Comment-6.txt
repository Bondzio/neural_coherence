with printer sharing.
there was a whole post on this.
your answer lies in this post.
udating the drivers for the printer does help, but if you look at how kaufmanmoore gave the instructions on how he solved this problem and everyone else responded to him about how it worked, you'll understand what i'm trying to tell you.
read the post entirely and i think you'll have a better understanding on what is going on.
