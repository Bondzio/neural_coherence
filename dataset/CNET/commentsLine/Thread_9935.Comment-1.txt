i am trying to transfer some pics/vids from my sony cybershot camera onto my dell studio laptop (vista).
when i plug in the memory card reader it installs as drive f, but when i click it, i get the &quot;please insert a disk into drive f&quot; message.
obviously the memory card is in the reader so i have no clue why it isn't being read.
the card works fine in the camera, i can view the pics and vids i am trying to transfer.
i have also tried plugging the reader and card into two desktops, a dell running vista and an hp running xp.
oh and the reader also shows that the memory card has been inserted by lighting up green, so i don't know that it is the reader's problem (i don't really know what the problem is, that's why i'm here).
the reader is a dynex dx-cr501.
of all the problems i have had with computers or electronics this is by far the most frustrating!
i seriously want to punt a cat that's how frustrated i am.
any help is greatly appreciated...
