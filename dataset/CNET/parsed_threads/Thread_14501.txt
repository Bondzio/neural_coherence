<s> What are the signs of needing a new DVD R/RW drive Emachines T5026 Pentium 4 3.06 CPU 768 RAM Windows XP Home 160 Hard Drive Basically I have the factory system the same way when I bought it from Best Buy. </s>
<s> Are you having any? </s>
<s> Feel free to share. </s>
<s> If you want one, then get one. </s>
<s> If you *need* one, by all means install one. </s>
<s> It's really up to you if no problems are present now. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I don't think I have any problems, my dvds burn and play pretty good. </s>
<s> I was just thought that after a year of heavy burning(dvd and cd) the burner would be dead but it seems okay. </s>
<s> I did some research on the brand name of the drive-TSST Corp. </s>
<s> Which is a joint venture between Toshiba and Samsung. </s>
<s> The last firmware upgrade I got maybe fall of 2005, and none since. </s>
<s> This is why I think maybe I should get a new burner, because they've stop giving updates, meaning that my burner is outdated. </s>
<s> Maybe I'm over reacting, I guess if it ain't broke, don't fix it! </s>
<s> Even if you got a new DVD burner, it may need an update so don't sweat it if no updates are available for you're current burner. </s>
<s> &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; is alot of common sense. </s>
<s> You have the option to replace in the future, cross-fingers good or bad. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
