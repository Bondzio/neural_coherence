i too have a pny 7600gs video card, but mine is in my m7330n hp media center computer.
is this just a known problem with emachine computers or is it a problem with the card itself?
i don't know how to check the temp of the video card.
i have a msi motherboard that only get two readings one shows cpu temp which runs 44c or 111.2 f and i am assuming board temp which runs 38c or 98.6 f. i am using sandra lite for the testing.
is there something out there better to test with.
thanks wayne
