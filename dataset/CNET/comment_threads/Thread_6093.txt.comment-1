I recently acquired a 250 GB Western Digital hard drive that had been formatted on a MAC.
On both Vista and XP machines it is seen in Device Manager and Disk Management but not recognized in Explorer so I can't access it to reformat it or use it.
In Disk Management it does not have a drive letter assigned to it and when right clicking on its icon all options except HELP are grayed out.
Other than putting it back on a MAC (as that is not a convenient option) is there anyway that I can get Windows to assign it a drive letter so that I can reformat and use it?
Thanks James
