I have Verizon Fios, and a wireless modem/router that they've supplied.
It is on the 2nd floor of my home.
I have a device which has always had trouble with wireless connections (it is built in hardware I can't swap out).
It does however have an Ethernet port.
Is there a way to get a wireless router to receive the wireless signal from my Fios modem/router?
I would then hardwire the router to my device so that this device can finally get online.
Thanks!
