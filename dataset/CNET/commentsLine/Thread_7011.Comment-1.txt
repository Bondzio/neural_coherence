i am totally lost here.
i need a webcam to take online school courses that won't time out on me yet doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
i can't afford a camcorder and i need good resolution with face tracking.
i live on a fixed income and would truly appreciate any help what so ever on a new or used but working unit.
