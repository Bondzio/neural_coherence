hi bob, yes, i agree that there is very little difference in the speed.
i did a speedtest for reference and the amount was unnoticeable.
i did get everything working as well.
i renamed the ssid from default to a different one and it started working immediately.
so all is good.
i wanted to thank you again for your interaction.
have a good one!
