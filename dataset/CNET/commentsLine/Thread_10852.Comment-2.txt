just a quick checklist: did you visit a &quot;bad&quot; site?
maybe virus?
what other hardware are you running?
if you know: is anything overclocked?
probably not, just checking.
is there anyway to check if the first hdd works in another comp?
if you don't: visit your local comp shop: if they are nice enough, they'll test your hdd in another pc for free.
power supply dying?
is it under warranty?
try calling hp for help.
