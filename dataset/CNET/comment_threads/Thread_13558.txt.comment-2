I recommend trying it on another monitor to see if the problem follows.
You did not say how your monitor worked b4 the new card.
If you swap parts to isolate the problem you can often narrow down the problem area to find a solution.
If the same prob shows on another monitor that would indicate not a monitor specific prob.
The same for video card, cables and drivers.
