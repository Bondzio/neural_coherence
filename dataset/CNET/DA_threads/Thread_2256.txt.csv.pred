1.1.1	If I were to purchase a wireless router , ( those I 've seen have several Lan ports ) , could I connect my DSL modem via the Wan port and my PC via 1 of these ports to utilise the router as a another security measure ?	Ques
1.1.2	Also if that is feasible am I putting data RF out ?	Ques
1.1.3	Do you see what I am asking ?	Ques
1.1.4	Wireless routers are prevelant , but I would still use the router as a wired PC .	St
1.1.5	rbul1 @ sbcglobal.net	St
1.2.1	and another level of security in addition to whatever you have on your PC .	St
1.2.2	not sure if you can turn off the radio ( check the user manual on the mfg 's site ) but you can configure it so practically no one can access it .	Res
1.3.1	I have done a lot of work with the Linksys WRT54G , WRT54GS , and WRT54GC wireless-g routers .	St
1.3.2	In addition to disabling the SSID broadcast , there is a setting on the WRT54G and WRT54GS to disable the wireless portion of the router ( set Wireless Network Mode to ''Disabled '' ) .	St
1.3.3	The firmware versions I have encountered for the WRT54GC do not have the ability to disable its wireless network .	St
1.3.4	If I needed to disallow all wireless connections , I probably would enable MAC address filtering but permit no MAC addresses to connect .	St
1.3.5	I also would enable encryption and disable the SSID broadcast .	St
1.3.6	Hmmm ... I guess I could also place the router in heavy 2.4GHz interference/blocking areas .	St
