Is there anything else I need? I plan to use it for mostly gaming. Also if there's anyway I could save a couple bucks by getting cheaper compatible parts, please let me know. Thank you very much! Can anybody give me a guide on how to get windows 7 64bit free? And maybe a cheap hard drive? Thanks!

Windows 7 isn't free. http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/productID.235488300/categoryID.50726100/list.true sells the retail version of Home Premium for $199. You might be able to find it somewhat cheaper in some shop. Hard drives are rather expensive at the moment, due to the March 2011 tsunami in Japan. If money is a factor, better wait half a year. Kees

You can read about CPU HS Fan options over at http://www.Frostytech.com You might save a few bucks by going to a slightly lower wattage single rail Corsair PSU.....650, 750, 800W Gaming Series. They've got a 15% coupon discount over at Newegg that's worth looking at. VAPCMD
