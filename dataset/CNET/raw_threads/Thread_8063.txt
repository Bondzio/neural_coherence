12819	0	36419	423640	NR	abelardo	9/10/04 12:36 PM	1.09481976E12	Added HD,	Hi! Recently I added a HD to my PC running WinXPSP2, formatted by WinXP and installed as primary slave. When I turn the PC ON, the driver is not shown, only C: and D: are indicated (primay master) but primary slave does not. If I restart the system the slave disk shows up and works normally. When I turn the system OFF and them ON again the slave is again missing, once again to see the slave drive I have to restart the system one more time. Any suggestion?

After restart BIOS identify the Drive correctly but the SPD module is still indicated. This indication does not appear in Primary master. Both units have the same capacity and are from the same manufacturer

Let's go to the basics? 1. 80 Conductor IDE cable? 2. Drive set to Cable Select? 3. Bios for the motherboard is latest? Bob

Drive is set as Slave (no jumps) About the Bios it has not been changed since I own the PC. It is a Sony desktop I acquired erly 2002. Do I have to upgrade it? Sony never mentioned it. Do I have to ask Sony for it? Please advise me.

Are you using the same IDE socket for both or on separate IDE sockets? 3. Check mother board manual to know how many primaries and slaves can be attached to it. 4. Check IDE connector cables and connection if the connector is properly seated to the IDE sockets or the drives. 5. Try changing or exchanging the IDE cables, one connector may had been damaged due to age or heat inside the CPU housing.

Cable from M/Bs' primary IDE channel -&gt; middle connector to slave -&gt; end connector to Master. Jumpered slave/master, going to totally disagree with cable connect. Unless one drive has extended partitions and correct cable is used. Master will be device 0/ slave device 1 Bill
