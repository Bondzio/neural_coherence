If yes, which Netbook brand and model do you suggest? If no, suggest me a good 14'' Notebook. Hurry up please.

And why not other 14 inch notebooks? What models are available to you? We installed VS2008 MySQL on a simple netbook for a test. It runs but why anyone would put up with a 10 minute boot and wait for it to come up is beyond me. But it did work. Bob
