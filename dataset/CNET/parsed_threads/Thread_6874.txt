<s> I have an Intel duel core &quot;extreme&quot; cpu but when I run video processing programs, Avid, Pinnacle, or Coral, the average cpu usage rate averages just below 50%.Is there anything I can do to get that to a higher number thus cutting the processing time? </s>
<s> But in spite of this you should see your dual core work smoothly compared to a single core. </s>
<s> I use Virtual Dub and it taps both cores just fine. </s>
<s> DVD FLICK did too. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It prolly uses 1 core or offloads the work to the GPU </s>
