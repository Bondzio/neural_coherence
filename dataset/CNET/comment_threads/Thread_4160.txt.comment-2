Seeing as IE is the main target for virus and spyware writers, I only use IE for Windows Updates, or any of those web sites that still only use IE proprietary html that doesn't always work in other browsers.
Why not try Firefox?
If you like it you will stay with it.
If not, you can always uninstall it.
