How'd you manage to see the files?!!
Hope you don't mind me ask, I am also riddled with a similar scenario after purchasing a MacBook Pro and selling my netback.
I have a military grade Maxtor External HD and I CAN NOT even seem to be able to find it when plugging it into my MBP via the USB portals.
PLEASE HELP ANYONE!!
=( Arnold
