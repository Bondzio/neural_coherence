<s> I recently installed a new video card and re-installed windows XP. </s>
<s> After the Windows re-intsallation, I notice that my sound is skipping quite a bit and other things sputter a bit, as well. </s>
<s> Such as mouse and page movement. </s>
<s> Sound is most noticable, though. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> After a reinstall of the OS, the next step is to load any motherboard/chipset drivers, then updated for XP sound/video/modem/NIC etc drivers. </s>
<s> Don't forget Windows updates. </s>
<s> Drop your Hardware Acceleration one notch at a time until it plays correctly. </s>
