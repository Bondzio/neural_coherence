I'm not sure if you actually mean what CPU is an abbreviation for, which would be Central Processing Unit. In case you did, then a great CPU out right now would be the Intel E5200 Dual-Core Processor. You can get it for about $75.00. It clocks in at 2.5Ghz. As far as noise goes, it's virtually silent.

I should have used the term &quot;console&quot; or &quot;just the computer without peripherals.&quot; I know about some quiet computers, e.g., Dell &quot;Hybrid.&quot; And &quot;endpcnoise&quot; makes quiet computers. And thanks for the info about the quiet CPU (Dual-Core). I'll add that to my list of specs.

13141	5	327533	2965276	2964549	Quiet computer	1/28/09 8:47 PM	1.23317562E12	Thanks, Bob	Hi Bob, just briefly: i don't like laptops, and do like PCs with the separate keyboard, big screen, mouse, etc. Tell me more about Win 7. In a brief search for reviews, there are a few beta reviews, but nothing really too substantial yet. Do you think it will be (a) as good as, or better than, XP; and/or (b) fix all the bugs / better than Vista? Thanks for any info.
13141	6	327533	2965277	2965026	Quiet computer	1/28/09 8:55 PM	1.2331761E12	Hi Repete	Thanks for the great list of specs! Good idea to build it myself, but I don't feel i am up to speed on building a computer, but may take your specs to a shop in the neighborhood to see if they will do it. One of my main concerns is having good tech support, and someone close-by could be good.

The market dictates you take a product to market when the bugs are below a certain threshold. You won't found bug free Windows any time soon. But Vista feels like Microsoft's Windows ME disaster. And I did the Windows 7 beta and it's impressive. Even in beta form it seems to beat Vista on key talking points. I'd wait it out and skip Vista if you can. And about XP. It doesn't support USB 2.0 out of the box, drives over 127GB and SATA until service packs and even then SATA can be problematic. It's age is showing. Bob
