1.1.1	Hello .	St
1.1.2	I have a Windows ME computer .	St
1.1.3	I was wanting to know how I can more effectively run my computer 's memory .	St
1.1.4	We have 256K , and we have used only 12Gig of the 60 Gig HD .	St
1.1.5	I 've gone to ConfigSys , and stopped some unnecessary items from loading up at first .	St
1.1.6	Also go to ALT-CTRL-DEL & check for items to shut down if needed .	Sug
1.1.7	Twice a week I go to Temp & Temp Internet folders , and delete everything in there .	St
1.1.8	We had the same problem last year , and I upgraded my memory from 128 to 256 .	St
1.1.9	WIll maxxing out the memory at 512 make a difference ?	Ques
1.1.10	If so , for how long ?	Ques
1.1.11	This computer is getting bad enough to where I 'm online , and it 'll say & quot ; Low memory - close a program & quot ; .	St
1.1.12	I 'm not playing any video games or rendering any heavy graphics .	St
1.1.13	Or , it 'll reboot on its own !	St
1.1.14	I run my Spybot twice a day , and nothing out of the ordinary is going on to affect this that I am aware of .	St
1.1.15	Suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.16	If you need more details please let me know .	Sug
1.1.17	Thanks , David	St
1.2.1	Unlikely .	St
1.2.2	However , if this was my machine I 'd read and use the Optimizing Windows article at http : //www.aumha.org/articles.htm As to Spybot twice a day , that is a sign that something is amiss .	St
1.2.3	Such as a owner that uses nothing but Internet Explorer which can gather many pests .	St
1.2.4	Try FIREFOX .	St
1.2.5	Also , use the latest Spybot as well as Adaware .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Also , try using the immunize feature of Spybot .	St
1.3.2	And try Spyware Blaster , an affiliate of Spybot .	St

1.4.1	I used ME for a bit and soon upgraded to XP , aworld of differance .	St
1.4.2	IMO windows ME was a real white elephant .	St
1.4.3	You should upgrade if possible .	Sug
1.5.1	Getting the spyware removers is a good start as others suggested .	St
1.5.2	Review again what you want in pgms .	St
1.5.3	to be running and then delete , entirely rather than stopping them .	St
1.5.4	Sadly , after doing all this and maybe some other suggestions , it maybe better to start from scratch and reload the OS , after a clean format , save all data , etc .	St
1.5.5	you deem necessary .	St
1.5.6	If your system is capable looking into the XP OS maybe valid upgrade if only to get beyond the Me headaches as its more stable .	St
1.5.7	The only cavet in either case is a memory upgrade , 512mb is great for Me and XP , but more mbs for XP is far better .	St
1.5.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
