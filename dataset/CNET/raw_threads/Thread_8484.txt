The only problem im having is that the screen size on the tv is too big, how do i fix the resolution? (By the way, im running dual monitors, both are displaying the same thing; the picture on the computer moniter is fine, but the tv is too stretched out and doesnt fit.)And how do i get sound to come out of the television speakers if im using a dvi-hdmi connection? thanks

Try under playback devices (control panel, sound), chang default from speakers to hdmi audio. As to the screen sizes, that's all about video mode settings. I can not offer any exact answer. But you should try other video modes. Bob

To get sound to come out of the TV speakers, there should be an 'audio out' connector on your computer's sound card, and an 'audio in' connector on the TV, just hook them up.
