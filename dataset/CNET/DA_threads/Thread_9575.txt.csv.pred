1.1.1	I am about to buy a high end gaming computer for alot of money and I was wondering if I should wait until the new OS ( VISTA ) comes out or should I go ahead and buy the computer .	St
1.1.2	I recently ordered the two best video cards ( NVIDIA 7900GTX SLI ) .	St
1.1.3	Now on Nvidia 's website it says that the cards are Vista ready , but I read a review on CNET that says they 'll only be good on DirectX 9.0 .	St
1.1.4	Vista only runs on DirectX 10.0 .	St
1.1.5	Does that mean the video cards will be obsolete by the time Vista debuts or perhaps will Nvidia be able to submit drivers to download so I get full graphics potential ?	Ques
1.1.6	I also am using the AMD 64 bit chip which also says it is Vista ready .	St
1.1.7	But is it ready only with the minimum requirements or am I just wasting my time and should wait before I buy .	St
1.1.8	Please HELP !	St
1.2.1	If all you are worried about is Vista , then go build your high end machine .	St
1.2.2	Vista will be pushed back more and more .	St
1.2.3	Many people are going to stay with XP because it will probably be faster .	St
1.2.4	All the newest games will be backwards compatible with XP for at least a few years .	St
1.2.5	HL2 can run on win 2000 .	St
1.2.6	And since a gaming rig is only a gaming rig for about 2 years .	St
1.2.7	You should never have to say , damn I ca n't play this until I get Vista .	St
1.2.8	If I am wrong I will give you my address and you can come give me a punch in the face .	St
1.2.9	; )	St
1.3.1	Well I actually already ordered the computer not just the cards but I could cancel if I wanted to .	St
1.3.2	But thank you for your help !	Polite

1.5.1	Here 's my personal take , Vista seems to be having trouble getting out of the gate .	St
1.5.2	I know a lot of gamers and they have some new systems much like you and when they put Vista on , they said it ran , well , like crap .	St
1.5.3	They all went back to XP .	St
1.5.4	I personally do n't care for it and would stick with XP right now and I call Vista the Win ME of NTFS .	St
1.5.5	I would say it 's slow , sluggishly irritating , a bogged down XP and not worth the time .	St
1.5.6	I would stay with what works for now .	St
1.5.7	This is just my opinion though and you should still do some self research .	St

1.6.1	I am beta testing Vista ... Its worse than windows xp 64 bit .	St
1.6.2	I have working hardware becuase ATI is smart enough to give Vista drivers.. but I still prefer xp alot .	St
1.7.1	I agree that it is terrible currently and as much as I hate to say this , it is & quot ; BETA & quot ; .	St
1.7.2	That is a big word for 4 letters .	St
1.7.3	I got around to thinking , yes I do that once in a while , and I figure maybe MS is doing the right thing .	St
1.7.4	In the past they put out an OS and beta test the darn thing as legit OSs causing millions to fix issues as they went .	St
1.7.5	Perhaps this is a better route to take and eventually will be more stable in the near future .	St
1.7.6	I do n't like the resource sucking of the OS but with higher ram , 64 DCPs and all , I suppose you can get more out of an OS .	St
1.7.7	If it shows little improvment before final , then count me out , i 'll wait for the next generation and use XP for now .	St
1.7.8	Paul	St
1.8.1	Vista , menrom , ddr3 , atis no-link crossfire , hdmi compatibility , blu-ray/hd , dx10 .	St
1.8.2	All coming soon .	St
1.9.1	It wont run on XP .	St
1.9.2	this is how M $ is tring to get people to buy their system , Vista only games	St
1.10.1	Buy one now ... ... ... if you want a new system , then buy a new system !	St
1.10.2	Forget about Vista and stick with XP Pro .	St
1.10.3	Everybody 's hyped-up over Vista but it 's going to turn out to be crap .	St
1.10.4	Vista-Vista-Vista ... ... ... ... .. do some heavy research .	St
1.11.1	I went ahead and purchased the computer , hopefully if I decide to upgrade to the new operating system and play direct x 10 games maybe companies can make drivers to fix any incompatabilites .	St
1.11.2	Appreciate the advice and it will be a while before I upgrade .	St
