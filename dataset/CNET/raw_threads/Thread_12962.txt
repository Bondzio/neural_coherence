If I take out the floppy disk drive, can I put a hard drive in its place or are they two different slots? If I can't, should I just get an external hard drive? And are external hard drives slower than internal ones?

Less clutter on the desk, nothing to plug and unplug if you go with an internal. Since you didn't tell us anything about your system, OS and such, all I can say is internal.
