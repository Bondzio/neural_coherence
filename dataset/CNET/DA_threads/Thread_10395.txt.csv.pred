1.1.1	Good day, my friends.	St
1.1.2	I'm having a Samsung Galaxy Note II, more commonly knows as the 'Phablet&quot;.	St
1.1.3	Initially I was happy that I needn't invest in a tablet as this is combination of both the interfaces.	St
1.1.4	Well, later I was really fascinated by the Windows 8 Pro Tablet that had come up in the market, and I had wished I had one.	St
1.1.5	So basically my question is like, will buying a Windows 8 Pro Tablet render my 'Phablet' useless?	St
1.1.6	Or is there anyone out there, who inspite of having a Phablet owns Tablet?	St
1.1.7	Please provide me with some details!	St
1.1.8	Thank you very much for the help in advance!	St
1.2.1	I'm not sure I understand your concern, but doesn't this device support bluetooth?	St
1.2.2	If so, you can buy a $15 adapter for the laptop and copy stuff back and forth.	St
1.2.3	I have an LG smart phone that works like that, although I've never had any other brand.	St
1.2.4	I do have an Android based Kindle Fire which I can connect to my laptop via a micro USB cable, and it works just fine as well.	St
1.2.5	` Good luck.	St
1.3.1	I understand that you've got a 'smartphone' and not a 'phablet'.	St
1.3.2	But my question is will a Phablet-Tablet-Laptop combination make sense?	St
1.4.1	only have a bicycle.	St
1.4.2	Others only have a car.	St
1.4.3	Some have both.	St
1.4.4	Depends on their needs.	St
1.4.5	Same with you.	St
1.4.6	What are your needs?	Ques
1.4.7	You didn't tell.	Polite
1.4.8	How about the new Asus Fonepad?	St
1.4.9	That's a 7&quot; tablet (like the Nexus 7 or the iPad mini) that doubles as a phone.	St
1.4.10	Maybe that's what you were looking for but didn't know it existed.	St
1.4.11	Kees	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Well, that example's good.	St
1.6.2	Basically I'm a 11th grade student.	St
1.6.3	So will the Acer Windows 8 Pro Tablet supplement my Galaxy Note II?	St
1.6.4	I....... 1.	St
1.6.5	Make Presentations.	St
1.6.6	(ppt) 2.	St

1.6.12	5.	St
1.6.13	Use a lot of the camera at the class to capture stuff on the board.	St
1.6.14	(that's where the &quot;Phablet&quot; helps me) 6.	St
1.6.15	Do a lot of social networking like: WhatsApp, Facebook, Viber etc.	St
1.6.16	7.	St
1.6.17	Use a lot of the internet for browsing and study purposes.	St

1.6.24	11.	St
1.6.25	Require a lot of typing.	St
1.6.26	(Presentations and Programming......) That's much of my use, though there are more.	St
1.6.27	Anyways, now can you tell me?	St
1.7.1	Those 11 to 13 inch Utlrabooks look closer to your needs.	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	Currently, I've already got a very high performant, top notch Laptop.	St
1.8.2	But based on my requirements, my question is whether a Tablet will fit in, in spite of having a Phablet and a Laptop?	St
1.9.1	At the office we have many tablets and they all fit in.	St
1.9.2	Why they do is because we work on apps and need a collection of devices.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	But all I wanna know, is whether anyone out there own a Phablet and a Tablet, and a Laptop.	St
1.10.2	Thanks for the info, anyways!	St
1.11.1	But I rarely carry them all except to the demos.	St
1.11.2	Again, we sell this.	Sug
1.11.3	What we use is well, what we use.	St
1.11.4	Bob	St
1.12.1	While I don't have a phablet and a tablet, here's my take on it.	St
1.12.2	Consider your &quot;phablet&quot;.	St
1.12.3	Just what is a phablet anyway?	St
1.12.4	It's an attempt to give you the utility of a smartphone and a tablet in one device.	St
1.12.5	Let's put it another way.	Sug
1.12.6	Your &quot;phablet&quot; is just a very big smartphone, at 5.5&quot;, a lot bigger than the typical smartphone (say, a Galaxy S4).	St
1.12.7	But, it's still smaller than a 7&quot; tablet and a lot smaller than a 10&quot;+ tablet.	St
1.12.8	Just as your Galaxy Note might be easier to navigate and view because of its larger screen, getting a full size tablet will also improve your experience over what you have in the same way for the same reason.	St
1.12.9	But, there's an obvious cost.	St
1.12.10	The larger full-size tablet, is just that, larger.	St
1.12.11	You're not going to carry around a 10.1&quot; or 11.6&quot; or 12.5&quot; Windows 8 Pro Tablet as your phone.	St
1.12.12	Even a 7&quot; tablet is really pushing the envelope.	St
1.12.13	Now, only you know for sure what's useful for you, but I'll try to answer your basic questions plus a few more.	St
1.12.14	Will a Windows 8 Pro Tablet be useful for you in a way that your Note isn't?	St
1.12.15	Probably yes.	St
1.12.16	You already said you wished you had one.	St
1.12.17	Will a Windows 8 Pro Tablet replace your Note?	St
1.12.18	I seriously doubt it (unless you plan on carrying it in a backpack with a bluetooth hands-free perpetually in your ear).	St
1.12.19	You're not going to carry your tablet everywhere, and your Note still offers you convenience that a smaller smartphone doesn't have.	St
1.12.20	Will your Windows 8 Pro Tablet replace your laptop?	St
1.12.21	Again, probably not.	St
1.12.22	Even the best and biggest ones fall a little short of the typical laptop or ultrabook.	St
1.12.23	Everyone is different.	St
1.12.24	For some, the Note is too big for a phone and too small for a tablet.	St
1.12.25	For others, it's the perfect compromise.	St
1.12.26	I imagine you'll probably use the Note the way you're using it now.	St
1.12.27	You'd likely use the tablet when the Note falls short, when you want a better movie viewing experience or easier data input, but still want extreme portability.	St
1.12.28	Last, you'll use your laptop when you really need the best performance and the convenience of more ergonomic data entry and viewing.	Sug
1.12.29	You didn't mention it, but you'd also probably use a desktop or at least a docking station if you spend any serious amount of time in front of your computer and don't want to end up with some sort of repetitive stress disorder.	St
1.12.30	Personally, I use a cell phone, a 7&quot; android tablet (which still fits in my pocket, but would never suit me as a phone), and a desktop PC (I do too much work at my computer to tolerate using a laptop, but I do have one for times when I need to do serious work on the road).	St
1.12.31	Good luck with whatever you decide.	Polite
1.12.32	Remember, there are no wrong answers here.	St
1.12.33	There are many, many choices.	St
1.12.34	Pick what works best for you.	St
1.13.1	Thanks a lot porsche10x!	St
1.13.2	That seems convincing!	St
1.13.3	Now I've got a hang of it.	St
1.13.4	Thanks a ton for getting me understood about the whole thing!	St
1.13.5	Good day!	St
1.13.6	I vote this to be the 'best' answer.	St
