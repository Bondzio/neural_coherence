I want to add more memory (256MB) to my DELL L500r, but am stuck because both 100 MHz and 133 MHz are shown in any catalog refences for this machine. Een when I consult DELL on line, I get both options. Are they interchangeable? There sure seems to be a price difference.

And are they interchangeable? What happens, for example, if I use 133 and the existing memory is 100? Doesn't work or runs slower?
