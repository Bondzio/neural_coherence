i've not received any good ideas that have worked from this post or the others i have fished with.
i tried reflashing from a boot disk as some have suggested, but the system fails the post tests and never proceeds far enough to actually boot up.
i did talk to the it person at my place of work and he basically told me my only recourse was to buy a new video card.
unfortunately, because the cards are fairly machine specific the word &quot;new&quot; refers to a used card purchased from ebay; the only source i could find.
it will run about $120 with shipping.
this is one mistake that i will not make again and that will start with not buying dell laptops.
i've always been fond of apple computer and this only reinforces my reason why.
i see a macpro on the horizon.
good luck with you endevors.
if you find anything that helps please let em know.
