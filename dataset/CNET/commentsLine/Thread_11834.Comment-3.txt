i have the intel version.
suggest you get the top-of-the line 4000+.
as for the gfx card, just get the x300se and upgrade yourself.
it comes with 400watt psu, so get a 6600gt.
not sure if the psu can be upgraded though.
its cheaper if you build yourself.
but if you too lazy or no idea, go to monarch, or cyberpower and customize it with retail parts instead of oem.
just my two cents.
