i don't have all the specs on the network.
there's about four computers connected and the wireless internet works great.
that is until the wireless notebook gets turned on and then the internet will not work on the other four computers.
i'm hoping someone can give me some advise as to what the problem could be.
let me know if you need more information.
thank you.
