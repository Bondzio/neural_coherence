This does not necessarily add the ability to run two monitors at a time. This takes special circuitry and not just parallel wiring.

Someday it will dawn on you that such a &quot;adapter&quot; or &quot;rewiring&quot; doesn't work. How can I shorten the time it takes you to realize that Laptop LCD's are not VGA Displays in disguise? You don't want to know the truth so you may struggle trying to do this for weeks and months. Here's hoping you will realize that this may never work. If it did, you'd find articles aplenty on the web. Bob

As an electronics design engineer, I know it is possible but it's not a simple wiring issue and your laptop doesn't have to use VGA signals to the display. Since you were so nice, I leave to learn about all this. Bob

The repair maunals have the specs and such, but prepare to pay. If you find some SAMS listing on just laptops, don't expect to match entirely the end product just a generalization at best or get lucky. In the longrun, you maybe making an &quot;interface&quot; adapter not just a wiring adapter for a simple pin1-2 whcih should be part of the overall solution. Put it this way, its a long way until completed and yes you'll need the specs. manual and of course understand the engineering involved as you've seen the basic output wasn't what you desired, you duplicating the laptop interface for a more hands-on connection. FYI - Laptops are such a PITA, I readily pass it on to the authorized centers if a quick fix can't be made. good luck -----Willy 2-cents spent
