i have a toshiba satellite p205d-s7454 notebook, i also have a dead (spilled water on it and it won't turn on) compaq presario 2100 notebook.
i recently took the old notebook to a local computer shop, asked them to transfer the data from the old notebook to dvd.
they wanted $130 for the job.
i mentioned it at work and a guy told me i can remove the cd/dvd drive on my new notebook, plug in the old hard drive and download from the drive.
this seems risky to me, i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.
