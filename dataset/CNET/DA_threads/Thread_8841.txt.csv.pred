1.1.1	I built this myself maybe a year and a half ago but am simplifying and moving to a Thinkpad .	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if anyone could help me come up with a fair asking price .	St
1.1.3	Here are the specs : -LIAN LI V COOL PC-V1000 Silver Aluminum ATX Mid Tower Computer Case ( very nice case ) -ENERMAX Liberty ELT500AWT 500W ATX12V Power Supply ( nice modular cables ) -ASUS A8N-SLI Premium Motherboard -AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Manchester -2GB DDR 400 ( 1GB sticks ) -2 36GB 10,000RPM Raptors in raid 0 -2 300 GB Drives ( 1 IDE , 1 SATA ) -Plextor DVD Burner ( dual layer ) -Lite-On Blu-ray drive ( reader only ) -Geforce 8600GTS -floppy -No OS , I 'll probably throw Ubuntu on it if I can get everything working correctly -I 've also got a Dell 24 FPW that I may sell separately or with the computer So , anyway , I know I can come up with an amount myself , but I 'd like to get some other opinions on this .	St
1.1.4	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	Most buyers today will not pay to struggle installing Windows and it 's driver hunt .	St
1.2.2	I see some great choices for disks and an almost gamer video card .	St
1.2.3	You can see what they sell such on ebay .	St
1.2.4	I see 499 .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	this is an instance where you may get more by selling some components seperately .	St
1.3.2	if you 've got a windows license , definitely install it since a functional pc is worth more than an assembled pc .	St
1.3.3	the case , power supply , mobo , cpu , ram , video , dvd and ide 300gb should fetch $ 250 ( with an OS ) .	St
1.3.4	anyone buying an inexpensive pc wo n't be interested in your higher-end components .	St
1.3.5	so keeping the raptors in the pc wo n't add anything to its price but you should be able to sell the raptors seperately for $ 40- $ 50 each .	St
1.3.6	likewise , the blu-ray reader is worth $ 50 seperately .	St
1.3.7	the monitor should fetch $ 225- $ 250 .	St
