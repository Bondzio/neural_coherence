<s> Hi, I am looking for an HDTV tuner or someway to watch TV on my computer. </s>
<s> I prefer not to actually buy the service like cable and pay monthly but to rather pick-up some local channels. </s>
<s> Here are my comp specs: 2.8GHZ P4 1024MB PC3200 GeForce ti 4600 QDI SIS Superb4FX, Motherboard. </s>
<s> Broadband I know that if I buy a tv tuner card thingie it'll most likely be from either ATI or Nvidia, i think. </s>
<s> Also can a TV tuner card like run WITH my other card. </s>
<s> I'm not looking for SLI or anything just wondering if I can use both at the same time. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Ibrhaim jadoon </s>
<s> Well there are basicaly 2 cards one from ATI a HDTV tuner card and one from Hauppauge. </s>
<s> Since you have a nVidia video card I would say the Hauppauge card. </s>
<s> To realy use the ATI HDTV card you need a ATI video card, but they are esaer to find in stores than the Hauppauge card. </s>

<s> Alright thank you very much, but I have a question. </s>
<s> I would need an HDTV antenna to watch HDTV, right? </s>
<s> You do need a good antenna,The ATI comes with a UHF antenna. </s>
<s> Since most HDTV stations are in the UHF band, a good UHF antenna. </s>
<s> How good depends on how far you are from the transmitters. </s>
<s> I live about 15 miles away and use an antenna that is good for 50 miles on regular tv and get good results most of the time. </s>
<s> At this point in time The ATI card drivers are still a work in progress, Works with XP ok, XPMCE however still leaves a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> The Hauupauge drivers are more stable. </s>
