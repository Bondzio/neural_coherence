Yes Kees The game got installed and running and ,It might be the program but the game is not performing at it should be.
I just installed the new Painkiller Overdose and the game is taking ages to load around 2 minutes is it possible?
and when graphic goes very high meaning to much light and effect (fog, rain ) and I am running it at standard graphic not high or extreme it is performing very slow could it be that the games do not or are not compatible to Core 2 CPU?
