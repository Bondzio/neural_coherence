<s> I'm trying to figure out which way is the best - buying a Kindle Fire, or Nook Tablet. </s>
<s> The e-reader was the original inspiration to buying one of these, however, since there's the Fire and the Tablet which gives you some very good extra features - apps, web browsing, email - I thought the extra dollar amount could be worth it. </s>
<s> But I'm not sure if you're really comparing apples to apples between the two. </s>
<s> Do I go for the FIre which seems to have the better apps, the Kindle/Amazon Cloud, and Amazon store. </s>
<s> Or, do I pay an extra $50 for a better device, faseter, bigger storage, but not as great of a store like Amazon? </s>
<s> Does the Nook Tablet have a Cloud like the Kindle Fire, or is it just some sort of gimmicky thing which isn't really of much value? </s>
<s> Does anyone have an opinion, one way or the other? </s>
<s> I can always seem to get good adive from B&amp;N about the Nook Tablet, and they are able to tell the pros and cons, and their bias for or against and as it relates to the Kindle. </s>
<s> On the other hand, finding a Kindle Fire seller who also knows about the Nook Tablet and the pros and cons from a Kindle bias is....well, I haven't found anyone. </s>
<s> These are going to be Christmas gifts, so if anyone can help with some input, that would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> We have the Nook at the office and it's missing the camera, and I think the G sensor. </s>
<s> It's also quite heavy compared to some 7 inch tablets. </s>
<s> The Samsung 7 inch models would get you the real thing and still let you use Amazon's market as well as BN's market. </s>

<s> I have a NookColor and a KindleFire. </s>
<s> I do not have a NookTablet. </s>
<s> I believe there is littlle difference between the N-Tablet and the N-Color. </s>
<s> If the person you are giving it to is primarily interested in reading then the NookC may be better. </s>
<s> I like it more because the features important to a book reader are better with the NookC a and a couple very necessary features such as being able to sort your books are completely missing in the Fire. </s>
<s> If they want to stream videos and have wifi then the Fire with membership in Amazon Prime is great. </s>
<s> Nook doesn't have anything like that. </s>
<s> Storage - Barnes and Nobel has an SD card slot because they are hideously selfish with the onboard storage in both the NookColor and the NookTablet. </s>
<s> Nearly all the space is reserved only for B&amp;N purchased content and they do not allow you to see or move anything in there. </s>
<s> Less than 1G is for the user. </s>
<s> The Fire has 6G onboard storage for the user and no SD slot. </s>
<s> But they also have unlimited &quot;Cloud&quot; storage. </s>
<s> I don't see anyone complaining about the cloud or it being difficult to access. </s>
<s> Price - Fire - $199. </s>
<s> Color - $199. </s>
<s> Tablet - $249. </s>
<s> SD card for the Nook - ($) . </s>
<s> Prime membership for the Fire - $79 a year (needed only for free Prime videos and other perks.) </s>
<s> Both can get NetFlix and Hula for a small monthly fee. </s>
<s> I think he Nook color is a little better than the Kindle. </s>
<s> I had hands on experience with both before I decided to go with B&amp;N. There's a great comparison guide here: http://kindlevsnooks.net . </s>
<s> Hope that helps! </s>
<s> I compared the two and decided on the Nook. </s>
<s> The tie breaker was the way a small child can use the Nook for interactive children's books. </s>
<s> The feature includes being able to record your reading of the book for the child to listen to. </s>
<s> I have experimented with my Nook for a couple of weeks now and am pleased with it with only a couple of nerdy reservations. </s>
<s> In fact, during this time I have down- and side- loaded items as samples, and full books from Barnes and Noble, from my local library, and from the internet epubs and pdf books and got everything working. </s>
<s> Getting RID of books that I no longer want was a little problem. </s>
<s> I also downloaded audio books. </s>
<s> Of course, I also put the Nook PC program, Adobe Digital Editions, OverDrive Media Console, and the Kindle PC program on my desktop and got them all working. </s>
<s> All the media I have played with were the free stuff. </s>
<s> I haven't actually bought anything yet! </s>
<s> Now I am happily reading all the books I can handle and am very pleased. </s>
<s> A recent trip to the hospital saw me sitting in waiting rooms reading books and checking the web. </s>
<s> You need a local wireless connection, but they are all over the place, and I run a router at home. </s>
<s> For the very close difference in price, I'm glad I got a Nook. </s>
<s> Of course, the negative reviews of the Fire here on CNET made me feel I had chosen correctly, but I assume Amazon will get those details straightened out soon. </s>
