There are four PCs in the house, all running XP and all with wireless Internet access via a 802.11b/g router tied to the DSL modem.
The router has several RJ45 jacks for 'direct' network connection, and I'd like to plug a hard drive into one of these so that any of the PCs could access this &quot;network drive&quot; for backup or to access common files.
I have looked for an appropriate hard drive, but still am not sure what features, etc.
to specify.
Ideally it would 'spin down' if not accessed frequently.
Can someone provide a link to a suitable piece of hardware?
Thanks.
