I'm using a Thinkpad T42. I type in the password, and it generates the numbers, but when I plug them into the notebook, it doesn't seem to work. I don't know a lot about wireless. What am I doing wrong? If I have not given enough info, please let me know.

Myself I just enable MAC filtering to keep out any onlookers. It's enough for me.

Is enabling the MAC stuff, like the previous poster good enough? Or should I definitely use some sort of WAP settings. Thanks again, and sorry for my newbieness. -Plink-

Aren't acronyms fun. I would start slow with MAC filtering until you get used to the routers security features.

On Windows XP Pro, it still says that this connection is not secure. Is it? Should it still say that? I went and did an automatic MAC address update in the MAC filter. It found the connection on it's own, and added it. Is that how it should have been done? Thanks again. Sorry for all the questions.

This isn't exactly the best neighborhood. I'm not too worried that it isn't secure enough, I was just curious if it was actually working or not, since XP still says that it's not a protected connection. Thanks again.

To be safe, enable the firewall and add another firewall. Read... http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-10166_7-5507759-1.html Bob

I would use the XP SP2, but am a little wary about installing the SP2. I have a Thinkpad T42, and I have heard that it is not quite supported yet. Is there another free firewall that would be useful for me? Thanks for that link. I'll try to look around some more, so I can finally stop bothering you. Thanks again.

If you have WEP enabled, but don't turn on MAC filering someone can hack your PC or use your AP to surf. If you have MAC filtering enabled, but don't have WEP someone (I don't know what equipment would be needed) could &quot;read&quot; the radio signal from your PC to AccessPoint. Ideally you should have both security systems in place. However, I don't think too many could intercept and decipher the radio signal. But many more could simply tap into your access point without the MAC address filtering. Sounds like you successfully have turned this on. (Linksys makes this easy.) You should also turn off your router broadcasting your SSID - it makes it easier for a someone looking for an open access point to hijack a ride on. You simply have to program your PCs, but you know what your SSID is so no problem. Firewalls - Zone Alarm and Sysgate Personal Firewall are both free and both work well. WinXP SP2 - I have upgraded 5 PCs with no adverse reactions. I think some of the negative press comes from users not understanding the need to reconfig the new Windows Firewall (which is by default turned on) to allow certain applications to pass through. You have to do this with every firewall. ZA and SPF just make this easier by popping up messages with every attempt by programs to access the internet. Windows Firewall just prevents access and you have to know enough to reconfig access. Hope all this helps.
