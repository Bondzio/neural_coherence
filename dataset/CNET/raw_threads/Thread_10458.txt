While its size impressed me, I haven't been able to get the desired display from it (nothing close to my old CRT monitor). The monitor's default is 1280x1024 resolution at 60 Hz frequency. However, I have realised that at this resolution, neither graphics nor text is appearing properly. Text is too light to read and letters appear broken. Graphics appear stretched out. I am using P-4 machine 1.8 GHz, 1 GB RAM, with built in Intel 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics controller and Windows 2000 Professional. I tried re-installing drivers but that didn't help. Any idea what could be the possible reason for this? How to get optimum viewing experience from this monitor. Thanks in advance. Satish

Understand also, while the LCD default resolution is XYZ, your std. output from the video port/card is is usually another XYZ too, they must match or get the best possible viewing, play with it. Also, if you're in an office with bright lights, etc. and you adjust brightness/constrast to extremes viewing will diminish overall. The bigger the screen the larger some displays show thier weakness, especially when using older video ports. Thus, having a newer video port/card and more video ram increases enjoyment in this regard. Last, overall the quality of the LCD counts as well, but I think you need to adjust setting for the best match as Dell offers decent LCDs. If possible get a video display output pattern to adj. basic setting before going overboard on anything else. here's a link: http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/software/lcdtest/ or find something similar. tada -----Willy
