But thesis work is something you choose then work with your prof or adviser when you get stuck. But I must comment here that I've seen such before. That is, the person sometimes thinks that such a study or data is on the web. Or they are trying to avoid setting up a lab to do the work. The lab setup seems to be the most common issue I see. It's really a lot of fun to set it up and then create the software to simulate, capture and more. Bob
