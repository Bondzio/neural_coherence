1.1.1	& quot ; if you have a second physical disk in your machine , you can boost performance by moving your paging file ( pagefile.sys ) onto your second drive & quot ; I hear this all the time ... is it TRUE ?	Ques
1.1.2	If yes then ... shall i make my ( 20 GB FAT 32 HD ) into Paging file disk ?	Ques
1.1.3	And should i disable the page file in ... my main HD ?	Ques
1.1.4	Also , I got this HD from a fren , it 's working fine ... but it had 5 BAD clusters .	St
1.1.5	( which i surfaced scanned and all ) ... but my fren did n't want it , so i took it ... it 's basically FREE ! ! !	St
1.1.6	I will be using it only for PAging file and TEMP folder for my Other softwares ( like Audition , Photoshop ... KAZA , Limeware ... etc ) Now ... is there any software , that can further check , or help in BAD clusters ?	Ques
1.1.7	Till now ... it has only , 5 BAD clusters ... HELP ! ! !	St
1.1.8	Please ... Gsoul2soul	St
1.2.1	Posts continue with members learning that limeware is now bad news .	St
1.2.2	Members are losing their OS or files due to that .	St
1.2.3	Your choice to use this poison .	St
1.2.4	Let me comment that with today 's well equipped machines of 256 , 512 or more megabytes of RAM that payoff of such paging file optimizing is not paying off .	St
1.2.5	Your choice here and I will not discuss why in detail .	St
1.2.6	You do the test .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	dump the 'free ' drive .	St
1.3.2	it 's just going to cause you problems in the future ... probably as soon as you put something important on it .	St
1.3.3	as for the paging file ... putting it on a seperate , fast drive is a boost ( how much is debatable ; but vista will automatically use a usb flash to offload the pagefile so there 's definitely a benefit ) .	St
1.3.4	i doubt if a 20gb drive is anywhere near as fast as your current drive so , once again , dump the 'free ' drive .	St
