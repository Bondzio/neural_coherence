i recently bought the netgear wg 511v2 wifi card for my dell latitude lap top with win xp pro operating system.
prior to this card i have used belkins and linksys cards with no problems at all.
ever since i have installed this card i continue to face problems when i try to put the laptop on stand by or shut down nothing happens, i have to hold down the power button for a few seconds to shut off the machine which is of course not the best way to work the computer.
i have tried removing the wifi card restarting the machine and trying to put the laptop on stand by and all of it works just perfect.
i have a feeling its got to do with the new card.
any help will be appreciated..
