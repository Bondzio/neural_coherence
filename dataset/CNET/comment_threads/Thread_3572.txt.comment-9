Well, I can only find two motherboards, the first one with the 754 and the other was AGP 4x/8x.
Did I miss one?
(Lol, that case will be my case for my Dream PC, when and how I can make up $5,000 is still a mystery to me, though) Yeah, most all motherboards I found all support SATA and IDE/PATA.
So, the Hard drive that was supposed to go in the Dell will work.
That actually clears up a matter I was earlier confused about in another post.
I would say this case, which has a case w/ PSU, but at least it is Aspire.
The only thing is that it looks a little too[/i[ flashy, but thats just my opinion: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144005 Currently, SATA3G is the best, then SATA||, then finally SATA, I think.
Of course there is SCSI, but we won't go into that.
