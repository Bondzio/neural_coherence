<s> I need to buy a new computer for basic home and small business use, and will purchase an extended warrenty. </s>
<s> Tech support and good in-home service as needed are important considerations for a non-techie like me. </s>
<s> Any guidance would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Work backwords: Call companies and users that have purchased this warranty. </s>
<s> See if they lived up to it. </s>
<s> OR This is kinda sneaky but here's what I'd do. </s>
<s> Go to the store and write down the serial number from one of the display models. </s>
<s> Next, I'd call the company's tech support deptment. </s>
<s> Tell them you are an existing customer. </s>
<s> Give them the number and you are in. </s>
<s> Tell them a horror story that your system died. </s>
<s> Now you will REALLY see how they treat you! </s>
<s> I hated to give away that secret because I've used it for years, enjoy! </s>
