Hi, I just recently purchased a Mac Pro with firewire as well as a Panasonic DVX 100B.
The Final Cut software is not recognizing the camera at all.
Can you please walk me through what you did in setup??
I have the appropriate connectors, but am at a loss as to what else to do to use the editing software.
Are any drivers needed?
Any help appreciated!
