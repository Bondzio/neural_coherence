i've been looking for a wireless network camera.
today i went down to my local computer store and purchase a linksys wireless-b 2.4ghz video camera.
the picture was crappy.
i'm returning it tomorrow.
this is basically for my home.
i want an indoor camera that i can sit in the window to monitor outside.
can you guys help me out?
i'm willing to spend up to $800 on a camera and software.
i would like features such as panning, zooming, motion detection, save to hard drive and remote monitoring to name a few.
how are toshiba and panasonic?
thanks in advance.
