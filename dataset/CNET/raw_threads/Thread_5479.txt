It is $275 (newegg has a $45 rebate also for the next few days.) I have only tries one game, Knights of the Old Republic 2 and although it's not the most graphic intensive game I am running everything on make and it's doesn't even seem to be trying.

How do you know that ATI is AMD happy??? Thanks.
