ok im on the older XP machine now, and i still cant access the shared folder, i cant even access the other computer (the one that i just recently put XP on.
''You might not have permission to use this network resource, contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.
access denied''.
It was my brother-in-law who set the computer up a while ago and he knows a lot more than i do, so could it possibly be something ''advanced'' thats stopping me?
as for the Error777, thats still popping up, especially on this site.
I downloaded a driver and installed it, but that didnt seem to do anything.
the link you gave me said it was for HP computers(which mine isnt) but the 3rd party page is where i got the driver from and it still didnt work.
thanks again for your help!
