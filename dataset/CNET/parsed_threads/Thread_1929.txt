<s> Can I use a micro USB-to-USB adapter to play content on my flash drive on a Nexus 7? </s>
<s> Just a little bit and I'll try it. </s>
<s> Be aware I don't do this because I can dropbox stuff over to it but I think I have the right cable and adapter. </s>

<s> As long as the proper seup is present it should exclduing any power need consideration. </s>
<s> Once you get injhto adapter and unique arrangements you've left to wonder as you posted. </s>
<s> The main idea is what does the specs offer, review it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Looked at the specs, tried it and would have to root it to enable it. </s>

<s> I haven't tried it with the N7 but see no reason it won't work. </s>

<s> I'm finding out only by physically looking(hard way) at USB what &quot;they&quot; mean by USB. </s>
<s> In some cases it's not the generic USB port as found on a PC. </s>
<s> The mini-USB or somehow differently *shaped* USB port takes only what the maker supplied or specific to that brand. </s>
<s> While the other end that connects to PC for sync is OK, it's the tablet port that causes all the fun. </s>
<s> I've started not to like tablets since you can't crack them open anyways(easily) or is it worth it. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> It's not the tablet port at all on this one. </s>
<s> I did get the Asus Transformer with the keyboard dock. </s>
<s> Besides the ports it has a full size SD card slot, micro SD slot and more. </s>
<s> What is this cracking open you speak of? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Just seeing what's inside, not hacking per se. </s>
<s> It's more about what makes it tick, I'm thinking we've come to point of true toss-away devices. </s>
<s> I understand phones get reworked in order to resell, but as for tablets, not netbooks or dinky laptops where some upgrades/repairs can be done up to a point. </s>
<s> ekkkkk! </s>
<s> it's just me -----Willy </s>
<s> When a nice web article showed how to shoehorn in a bluetooth adapter connected to an unused internal USB header. </s>
<s> That was a cool addition for cheap. </s>
<s> Thanks for the post Willy and let's hope the office keeps me floating in tablets. </s>
<s> I have a few but for reasons given we don't have the Apple ones. </s>
