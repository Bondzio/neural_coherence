I have some christmas money burning a hole in pocket so I figure it might be a good time to upgrade my computer a bit.
I'm by no means a hardcore gamer, but I would like to have my system ready for Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 (if and when blizzard ever releases them).
I'm looking to possibly upgrade either my graphics card or my ram, possibly both.
Here are some of my current hardware specs.
Board: DFI Corp,LTD LP UT NF590 SLI 1.0 2.10 gigahertz AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GS Ram wise, I have 2 1024 MB sticks, with 2 open slots.
Ideally I'd like to bump up my graphics card a bit and jump up to 4gigs of ram.
My knowledge of hardware issues has always been pretty lacking compared to what I know about software and I haven't been paying attention to what is available on the market right now, so any suggestions of how to best optimize my current system would be greatly appreciated.
