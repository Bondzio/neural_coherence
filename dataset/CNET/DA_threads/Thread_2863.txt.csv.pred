1.1.1	I recently purchased a computer with 2GB of ram .	St
1.1.2	I purchased 2 additional 1GB sticks .	St
1.1.3	I installed them both , but my computer would n't start .	St
1.1.4	After the BIOS screen windows never starts to load .	St
1.1.5	My computer works fine with 3GB , but as soon as I install the final stick of ram ... same thing every time , comp wo n't start .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.7	I 'm using 32 bit vista .	St
1.2.1	I 've seen problems were populating all RAM slots do this if the installed RAM exceeds what the MB will support .	St
1.2.2	As well , with the 3 GBs installed does the OS show all of it ?	Ques
1.2.3	MB and RAM specs might help get a better answer .	St
1.3.1	My system specs : Intel Core 2 CPU 6700 @ 2.66ghz System Ram : 3070MB System Type : 32 Bit operating system ( vista premium ) anyone else have any ideas ?	Ques
1.3.2	i dont have much time to type right now i can give more details later .	St
1.3.3	I am not sure of MB atm , just got the comp .	St
1.4.1	Sorry but there are far too many reports of issues at 4GB .	St
1.4.2	From BIOS to Windows .	St
1.4.3	Try it with just 2GB until your machine 's maker fesses up to why it bombs .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Why 32bit version ! ...	St
1.5.2	32 bit processors can only use up to 2G of RAM .	St
1.5.3	I also bought 4 pieces of Corsair 1Ghz FSB speed memory and it turned out a piece was bad .	St
1.5.4	And of course , my computer is a 64 bit machine that was running XP/64 and even though 4Gig is there , the computer will only tell you that there 's 3Gig on the My Computer/System Properties/General Tab	St

1.7.1	How does one install this patch ?	Ques
1.7.2	Vista wo n't install so we ca n't patch Vista .	St
1.7.3	- & gt ; Should n't Microsoft re-issue the DVD ?	Ques
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	All 32 bit versions support only up to 3 gigabytes .	St
1.8.2	To get 4 you have to upgrade vista .	St
1.8.3	I dont think their is 32 bit home premium so you would have to go ultimate or something to use 4 gigs .	St
1.9.1	Until you go to 64-Vista it 's going to be limited to 3 to 3.5 Gigs .	St
1.9.2	http : //www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/64bit.mspx does write the 64-bit is in the box but many OEM installs are ... the 32 bit version due to driver issues .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	install patch , put the other 2GB back in .	St
1.11.1	Correct me if I 'm wrong but I do n't care what the operating system is , a 32bit processor can only write to 2Gig of memory !	St
1.11.2	End of story .	St
1.12.1	Hi Everyone Here 's something I copied from microsofts website The virtual address space of processes and applications is still limited to 2 GB unless the /3GB switch is used in the Boot.ini file .	St
1.12.2	When the physical RAM in the system exceeds 16 GB and the /3GB switch is used , the operating system will ignore the additional RAM until the /3GB switch is removed .	St
1.12.3	This is because of the increased size of the kernel required to support more Page Table Entries .	St
1.12.4	The assumption is made that the administrator would rather not lose the /3GB functionality silently and automatically ; therefore , this requires the administrator to explicitly change this setting .	St
1.12.5	The /3GB switch allocates 3 GB of virtual address space to an application that uses IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE in the process header .	St
1.12.6	This switch allows applications to address 1 GB of additional virtual address space above 2 GB .	St
1.12.7	The virtual address space of processes and applications is still limited to 2 GB , unless the /3GB switch is used in the Boot.ini file .	St
1.12.8	The following example shows how to add the /3GB parameter in the Boot.ini file to enable application memory tuning :	St
1.13.1	Alright , I think one of the sticks of RAM was jacked .	St
1.13.2	I would blue screen constantly after anywhere from 5-30 minutes of playing Counter-Strike .	St
1.13.3	I was able to get my computer to start ONCE with all four sticks of RAM , and you are correct , it was maxed out at 3.5 GB .	St
1.13.4	After I restarted , my computer would n't start again so I removed a stick of RAM and it worked again .	St
1.13.5	I updated my BIOS and im using the beta version of NVIDIA 's forceware drivers now , which seem to work much better than the ones I was using .	St
1.13.6	I have n't had a blue screen since I pulled out the crappy piece of ram and updated bios and video card drivers .	St
1.13.7	I think it also might be because I have 2 sticks of nice Corsair ram , and the other 2 sticks are K-BYTE cheap ass ram..	St
1.14.1	firstly , you need make sure that your computer motherboard support to 4Gb RAM , If ok , you have two methods to install 4Gb RAM .	St
1.14.2	use 64 bit OS or Change physical RAM info ( see microsoft website for detail )	St
