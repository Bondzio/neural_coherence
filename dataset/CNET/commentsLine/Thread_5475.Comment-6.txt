what i mean is, having one of those dell inspiron 1545's plugged in 24/7 is fine, because the battery life on those is rubbish (about 40 minutes).
but netbooks are designed to have longer battery life, and therefore, charging it up every night should provide enough power to last it for the day, if not slightly longer than that.
