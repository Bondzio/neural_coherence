The ram i have in it is value ram and it sucks and is super slow still with games and other programs. So if anyone can help me out i would appreciate it. Thank You.

Try DX10 cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2008/01/03/the_best_gaming_graphics/ I see a good reason for subpar performance now. Then again we could chat about the good old (XP) days. Bob
