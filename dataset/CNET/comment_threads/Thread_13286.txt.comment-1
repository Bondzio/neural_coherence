At home I am trying to set up a local apache server to show a website on my LAN so I am able to share files through the website.
I have no trouble accessing the site from the host PC (I'm running windows by the way!)
but as soon as type the server name (HomeFiles) into the address bar on another PC on my LAN it cannot find the page!
Please colud someone let me know why this is happening!
Any other tips/suggestions would be welcomed!
Many Thanks
