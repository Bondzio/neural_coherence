<s> Hi Guys, My PC has 2 WD Wide SCSI hard drives, each 9.1 GB. </s>
<s> I want to replace them with 2 bigger EIDE hard drives of 40GB each. </s>
<s> My motherboard supports both ScSi and Eide interfaces, and also there is a Raid slot( not in use). </s>
<s> My question is if it is possible to do and how do I go about doing it? </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate your support on this one guys. </s>
<s> Thanks Temu </s>

<s> Thanks&quot; Temu, You didn't state if date needed to be moved so this will be easy. </s>
<s> Just use a nice 80 conductor IDE cable, set both drives to Cable Select and plug the drive pair into a Primary IDE channel. </s>
<s> You may need to set the BIOS to autodetect the drives and a BIOS update might be required if the drives are beyond the supported size. </s>
<s> Install your OS, pull your files from backup and store the SCSI stuff for a rainy day if you want to recover some forgotten file. </s>

<s> &quot;Just use a nice 80 conductor IDE cable, set both drives to Cable Select and plug the drive pair into a Primary IDE channel.&quot; Does this &quot;generally&quot; work? </s>
<s> Or does it depend on the mobo? </s>
<s> I have an Intel D845BG mobo, and HDD is set as master. </s>
<s> If I were to add another HDD, could I set them up either way, master/slave, or cable select? </s>
<s> And is there any advantage of one setup over the other. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The 80 conductor cable does the select and using the higher quality, higher speed cable sidesteps a few issues I've seen over hair loss trying to install the OS. </s>
<s> The rules are simple in IDE land. </s>
<s> Just try it. </s>

<s> has Master, and Slave printed on it, which is what concerned me. </s>
<s> Now I'm guessing that it means Master and Slave for Cable Select, or for normal settings. </s>
<s> Jumpered in a HDD from an &quot;antique&quot; Compaq about a month ago, to copy some files, and set it to Slave. </s>
<s> All worked fine, so guess the main HDD is set as master. </s>
<s> I'll try it as Cable Select, when I get the new drive, but may have to get a new power supply first. </s>
<s> Have a 300 Watt supply now, supposedly certified for P4, and Athlon, but don't want to push it. </s>
<s> Appreciate the reply. </s>
