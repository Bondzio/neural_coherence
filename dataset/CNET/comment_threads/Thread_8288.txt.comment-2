If I install UBUNTU it will ask me where to install and what boot loader to use.
At no time am I partitioning or formatting ahead of the install.
Those that do such tend to blow up there installed OS.
Bob Step 4 of http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-desktop-latest shows this.
Again I have to wonder why so many want to make this harder than it needs to be.
