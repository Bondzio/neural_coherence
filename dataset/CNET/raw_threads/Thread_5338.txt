It suggests that each power leg provides ample voltage at a stable level. If you don't buy Enermax, then Antec Vantec, or SparklePower. You should check: http://www.tomshardware.com for test reviews and the like. Don't fall for cheap units that offer 500W unless they've got some generous return policy, too often, cheap is cheap. tada -----Willy

I think I may go with antec just because they are readily available at local retail outlets. I realize that the Halcyon days of $40 power supplies are gone, and I'll have to spend about 90 plus dollars on this thing. I should think 430 + watt Watts ought to do me. I am assuming that most power supplies are compatible with this two year old motherboard. I do want one that is relatively quiet if I can get it. Any specific recommendations would be wonderful, as there are several variation in antecs in this watt range (dedicated circuits, fans, etc) Thank you all! fj
