<s> I am shopping to buy a good/excellent laptop that would have dual 5 1/4 bays, one being a DVD ROM bay & the other a DVD+-RW bay. </s>
<s> NOT a combo drive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Also, unrelated, does anybody have any experience with the Sony Viao desktop RZ502P? </s>
<s> Comments? </s>
<s> Thx, Sue </s>
<s> Just me sharing that I'm leaning to a DVD/CDRW in the laptop and an USB 2.0 or Firewire DVD all format dual layer recorder. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> First I haven't seen a dual layer recorder in the laptops yet. </s>
<s> Most are all of 2X speed and if you've done any DVD recording, you may find this much too slow. </s>
<s> The heat I see coming out of the 4X recorder I have would make me nervous to have in a laptop. </s>
<s> Besides, if the recorder fails, the external is cheap to fix. </s>
