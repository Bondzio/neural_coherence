I had to send my computer out to Geek Squad due to it wouldn't start.
They replaced my video card, for which it took them 5 weeks, and I finally got it back last week.
Now my computer is booting and running very slowly and my USB 2.0 ability has disappeared, and I only have USB 1.0 abilities.
It is taking my 160 gig IPod 5 x's as long as normal to sync.
Anyone who can unlock this mystery would be very much appreciated.
