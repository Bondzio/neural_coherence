<s> Ok while my title makes me sound like a total idiot I am not. </s>
<s> I ve got a Shuttle PC with MCE 2005 I m wanting to hook up to my Panasonic Plasma. </s>
<s> Problem is the Plasma is a ED so the Native Res is 852 x 480, not exactaly PC friendly. </s>
<s> It will display this res. </s>
<s> if using a DVI - HDMI cable. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to get a more PC compatable resolution while using this connection? </s>
<s> I know if I drop down to S-Vid I can then change the res based of my Video card but I m then using a lower quality connection. </s>
<s> So my question is how should I hook this two gadgets together to make them work best? </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> it MUST use a DVI-HDMI input, assuming the HDMI is from the TV and the DVI is from the computer? </s>
<s> I've seen cables like that. </s>
<s> Here is a site for them: http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/DVI-hdmi_cables.html Scroll down, and you will see them. </s>
<s> I'm not a genius about Plasmas, but I have one question: Can they change resolution, and if yes, what are the other possible resolutions? </s>
