I don't know if I should laugh or not, cause I can't tell if your serious.
But, it doesn't restart, it shuts down, but the caps lock light on my keyboard stays on.
I have to hold the on button to shut it down completely.
And, like I said in my previous post, I don't think its the RAM, because I tested them by themselves(unless of course, both of them failed), but I will do the memtest86 or w/e it was and get back to you.
I can't see what my power supply is.
Sometime tonight I'll take it off and see if I can figure out what it is.
