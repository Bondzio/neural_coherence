<s> Hi All, I have been experiencing some issues with my PC lately and today I replaced the video card to see if that would solve them, however after swapping video cards windows wont load? </s>
<s> it gets to the 'starting windows' screen and then goes black and then restarts the computer. </s>
<s> I have tried returning to the original video card but the same thing happens, I have also tried disabling the other hard drives and installing another with a working windows on it however, the computer still restarts at the same point? </s>
<s> I have also tried resetting the BIOS by unplugging the computer and removing the battery to restore the original settings with no result. </s>
<s> I don't know what I could have done to have caused this. </s>
<s> is it a particular piece of hardware that is faulty? </s>
<s> Any ideas appreciated? </s>
<s> Or Windows is not installed for this hardware. </s>
<s> Does a fresh install do same? </s>
<s> Remember you decide what to share and as it stands all I can offer is to pop in a fresh drive and install Windows. </s>
<s> I can't see make, model, age, STORY to give out the other ideas. </s>

<s> Solved it, Windows was installed on the drive the cause was a bad RAM stick. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway guys. </s>
<s> Be aware that faulty ram can cause corrupt HDD content. </s>
<s> Pretty well discussed but be on the lookout and hope you have backup copies of what you can't lose. </s>
