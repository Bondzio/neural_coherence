Let's try something rather new and lower power.
I picked up the Walmart 228 buck netbook.
When the screen is on, it measures a meager 15 Watts on the Watt meter and 9 Watts when the screen turns off and it is still running.
Now put your torrent on that and add some nice 4 bay drive like http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=4323356&sku=G15-1038&srkey=GMG 4500MGB-4Bay-Raid-Pro NAS Enclosure Of course you don't need the netbook with that.
Here I use the netbook along with a trio of USB drives which run SYNCBACK for safety.
Be careful of your words.
You might scare off those that would help you.
