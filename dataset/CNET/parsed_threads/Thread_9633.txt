<s> I bought the above device on line to provide communications between my 233 mhz PII pc and my 2.8 ghz P4 Dell pc. </s>
<s> Both are running WinXp with the Dell having USB 2.0 and the older pc having USB 1.0 capability. </s>
<s> The manual (on CD) details a simple procedure for installing the device on both PCs. </s>
<s> Essentially it was to run the install program and then insert the USB connector and the Netlink control program would see the device and connect it up. </s>
<s> It has not worked! </s>
<s> While searching the web for Netlink devices I found a few that had readable manuals. </s>
<s> One of them said that drivers for this device would not be needed since XP could provide them, that it would work with either USB 1.0 or 2.0 and that the device would appear as a mountable drive with a drive letter. </s>
<s> This has not happened! </s>
<s> Has anyone tried such a device? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> But they are finicky things. </s>
<s> And don't always work. </s>
<s> This is way I sometimes pull the hard disk and pop it into some USB housing to copy the data out. </s>
