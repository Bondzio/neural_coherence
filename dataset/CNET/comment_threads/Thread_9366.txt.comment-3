I have the disk, but it is an upgrade version.
I remember that when I installed it on the disk containing my Window XP, it searched for the previous version (proof of ownership).
If I start with a new hard drive, the program won't be there for verification.
I just ran into a case where my old Microsoft FrontPage had a problem.
I uninstalled it, and tried to install from scratch.
I couldn't do it because it was an update version, and I did not have the disc for the Windows 98 FrontPage.
