Tualatins were late entries as the P4 release was imminent, as I recall, so older socket 370 boards did not support it. BTW, OEM means &quot;Original Equipment Manufacturer&quot; which means these are the components PC builders buy in bulk and get a better deal. You don't get the boxed products warranty from Intel and you do not get a fan/heatsink. Hope that adds some helpful info.

You must insert it properly and cool it. These are &quot;keyed&quot; so you just about can't put it in wrong. You will need to find an adequate fan and heat sink. These are readily available and P3s don't produce the heat P4s do. The fan will probably plug into a MB near the CPU socket. You may have to set jumpers or core voltages but most modern MBs are jumper free and can autodetect the CPU and configure it. You should have a MB manual handy and the web site of the manufacturer is usually a good source for these.
