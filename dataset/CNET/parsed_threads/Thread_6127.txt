<s> I recently upgraded from an Intel Q6600 to a Q9400. </s>
<s> I reset the bios and originally the core clock started up at 2.66Ghz like its supposed to. </s>
<s> But all of a sudden when i check my temps and clock speeds, it says that its running at 2.0Ghz flat. </s>
<s> But when I go into my BIOS before my PC starts, it goes back to regular 2.66. </s>
<s> I just cant figure out why its underclocking itself. </s>
<s> Also, I know its not a heating problem, it runs at 42C Regularly after being on for a while. </s>
<s> Help me?! </s>

<s> Disable it in your BIOS. </s>
<s> the pc will run cooler and quieter with eist enabled. </s>
<s> if you're not doing any serious work, there's no reason for it run at full speed. </s>
<s> when necessary it will run at full speed so you're not losing any performance. </s>
