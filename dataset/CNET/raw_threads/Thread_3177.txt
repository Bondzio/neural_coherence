I'f have a home sterio with nice 10&quot; speakers witch I connected to my pc for better sound with DVD's. Problem is I can't come close to my screen, the magnets &quot;colorize&quot; my screen. I would like to know if anyone know how I can try to Shield that speaker/box so I can get it closer to my screen? Surely there must be some way to weeken the magnet's flied..Or am I haeding to a deadend?? If someone can help, please let me know. Thanks OOPS

Surround the speaker boxes, maybe get away with putting it only on the side nearest the Monitor. MuMetal is a metal that has a low Mu [greek letter, look it up]. It has a very low impedance to the magnetic field and thus, in effect shorts out the magnetic field so that it doesn't spread far outside of the shield.
