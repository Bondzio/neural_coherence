After a little research (on this site and other tech help sites) I decided it was time for a new drive. The new drive worked like a dream until the first restart - now it treats every CD as though it is blank - it appears to attempt to read it, but decides that it is blank - so does nothing. It is recognising that there is a CD in it and opens fine every time- more than what the old drive was doing. Does any one have any idea what might be going on and how I can fix it? My system is Windows ME

I have swapped the IDE cables around and plugged the hard drive and cd in every combination I can think of - and as the hard drive keeps working - I'm guesssing the cables are fine. I did discover that if I booted with the &quot;recovery CD-rom&quot; in the 'problem drive'- it worked fine - i.e.no reading problems. If I cancelled to Dos I could get it to list (DIR) the contents of the CD (something that doesnt happen when going through the MS-Prompt from Windows - where it stil thinks the CD is empty) - so this leads me to think its a software problem. I used the recovery cd to refresh &quot;windows OS&quot; but this has made no difference. Shall I try reinstalling windows?
