<s> Hi, I'm planning on building a new pc for video rendering and gaming. </s>
<s> I'm looking for someone to help check over the parts / recommend anything. </s>
<s> This is my first build so I really appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Motherboard: MSI Z87-G45 Gaming Motherboard ( http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=23721 ) Processor: Intel Core i5 4670K ( http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=23495 ) Ram: Corsair Vengeance Pro 8GB (2x4GB) ( http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=23783 ) Graphics Card: MSI GeForce GTX 760 2GB ( http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=24100 ) Case: CFI Diablo XT Black ( http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=24186 ) Power Supply: Corsair CX-750 Modular ( http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=22419 ) Harddrive: Western Digital WD Green 2TB ( http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=22582 ) </s>

<s> Where's the OS or a CD-DVD ? </s>
<s> I am planning on using this mainly for video rendering (20 720p 20min videos a day) and looking to use it for gaming and 3d modeling (autocad). </s>
<s> With the OS I have an old cd drive, although I am going to plug my new hd into my old pc and clone windows 7 onto it. </s>
<s> I am going for a more expensive build that has a much better case, gpu and higher psu so I can eventually get another video card. </s>
<s> 16GBs RAM. </s>
<s> The i5 is fine for gaming but not optimal for the other more CPU intensive uses. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The noted model is great for current games on a single display. </s>
<s> I take it that you are going to 3 displays. </s>
