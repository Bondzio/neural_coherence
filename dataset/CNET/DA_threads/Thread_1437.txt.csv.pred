1.1.1	Hi all, I'm hoping I can explain what we are trying to do without sounding like a complete idiot.	St
1.1.2	Doubtful.	St
1.1.3	We have a wireless signal in our house that comes through a service provided router.	St
1.1.4	The troubles come when we try to get internet to our shop which is separate from the house and a couple hundred feet away.	St
1.1.5	We have tried a wireless repeater with no success.	St
1.1.6	My husband ran CAT5 such that you can have a wired connection in the shop, but we cannot seem to get a wireless network to work through this connection.	St
1.1.7	At my disposal I have the service provided router, a Linksys Wireless-G WRT54G V8, and a Uspeed Wireless-N Wi-Fi Repeater Access Point Range Extender .	St
1.1.8	Any help would be most appreciated.	St
1.1.9	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Google How to use a router as a WAP and place that at the remote location.	St
1.2.2	I find repeaters to be too hard on folk.	St
1.2.3	For example, the speed drop is bad enough but will folk place them in the correct locations?	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I hadn't tried this yet, but will do so.	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the suggestion.	St
