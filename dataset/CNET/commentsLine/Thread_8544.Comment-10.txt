hi, i just recently purchased a mac pro with firewire as well as a panasonic dvx 100b.
the final cut software is not recognizing the camera at all.
can you please walk me through what you did in setup??
i have the appropriate connectors, but am at a loss as to what else to do to use the editing software.
are any drivers needed?
any help appreciated!
