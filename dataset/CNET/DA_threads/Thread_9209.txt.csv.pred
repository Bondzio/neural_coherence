1.1.1	I want to upgrade my P4 2.8 gh , 1 gig RAM , AGP Nvidia FX 5700 vid card rig .	St
1.1.2	I am wondering if either of these cards would be good upgrades for my system , and be able to play Oblivion fairly well : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814102680 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814121216 Also , I currently run my system on a 250W power supply .	Ques
1.1.3	If I upgrade to one of these video cards , will I have to upgrade my power supply ?	Ques
1.1.4	If so , can you suggest one to me ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.1.6	Also , if there are any other AGP video cards under $ 200 you would suggest , please tell me .	Sug
1.1.7	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If you 're gon na play Oblivion with your PC , then I say you 'll have to get the 6800 card rather than the X1600 Pro cuz it 's gon na give you better frames , and the 6800 can be overclocked pretty well .	St
1.2.2	As for your CPU , I think the settings wo n't be able to go max , maybe some medium , some low , 800 X 600 resolution .	St
1.2.3	Your RAM is quite sufficient , although 2 gb .	St
1.2.4	RAM is recommended ... .	St
1.3.1	the geforce 6800 is not clearly faster than a radeon x1600pro .	St
1.3.2	one wins some benchmarks while the other wins different benchmarks .	St
1.3.3	neither can play recent , graphics intensive games like f.e.a.r .	St
1.3.4	or call of duty 2 with frame rates at high detail settings .	St
1.3.5	http : //www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html ? modelx=33 & model1=293 & model2=318 & chart=94 a radeon x800gto is about the same speed as a x1600xt and about the same price as the 6800. the gto lacks shader model 3/HDR , but oblivion 's HDR can slow a 7800/1800 to a crawl so its a moot feature .	St
1.3.6	Here 's an article that compares a 1600xt and a 6800 ( note that the x800 is slower than a x800gto ) .	St
1.3.7	http : //www.firingsquad.com/hardware/ati_radeon_x1600_xt_x1300_pro/page13.asp http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814102609 it 's too bad that nvidia chose to pull the 6800gs since the was hands-down the best midrange AGP card a few months ago .	St
1.3.8	TigerDirect still has a few : http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=1648482 & Sku=P56-6800 & SRCCODE=SHOPPINGDF & CMP=OTC-SHOPPING	St
