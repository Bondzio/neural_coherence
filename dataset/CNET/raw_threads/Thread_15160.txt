Please help me with lay terms on what they do. I have a office away from home with one internet wireless service then my home has a laptop with another wireless internet service. They are 5 mins away from each other. How would it help me to have a router? Tks for your help.

It also allows the sharing of files between said computers. If you have only a single computer at each location, a router would be of little use to you. You might want to read about Remote Desktop. It allows you to access the other (remote) computer over the internet and use it as if you were sitting in front of it.

The remote computer must be running XP Pro. The client computer can run any version of Windows. Google Remote Desktop Connection for a thorough description.
