hey man, get the best a system can offer....just use all of them, fat, fat32 and ntfs....create different partitions win partition magic....set c:\ (system) as fat 32, d:\ (swap file) as fat (much faster) and e:\ (your files)as ntfs.
by doing this, you will have a much more reliable, stable and fast system.
if something goes wrong and your c:\ renders unreacheable, just re-install it, your data is safe at e:\ good luck !
