1.1.1	Does any one know how I can transfer the program files and data from my old 10g HD with XP home edition on it to a different PC with a 20g HD on it ?	Ques
1.1.2	The 20g HD presently has windows 2000 pro on it which I assume I will need to reformat .	St
1.1.3	I have Norton ghost 9.0 if I was to plug the 10g HD to this computer would I be able to do a drive to drive transfer ?	Ques
1.1.4	Is it possible that XP being a newer OS than 2000 would have the MB drivers needed for this computer to reconize the old XP HD .	St
1.1.5	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	It 's quite possible to copy the entire drive from the 10 gig to the 20 with Ghost or other such software .	St
1.2.2	As such , all data is intact .	St
1.2.3	However , XP will not startup on the new hardware .	St
1.2.4	You will need the original installation CD and will need to perform a & quot ; repair & quot ; installation .	St
1.2.5	You will also need the product ID code and will be required to reactivate Windows .	St
1.2.6	It 's possible that XP will know much of your hardware but probably not all of it .	St
1.2.7	Gather all the drivers first .	St
1.2.8	This would also be a good time to visit the web sites of all your hardware manufacturers and get the latest drivers .	St
1.2.9	Definately get the latest BIOS for the MB while you 're at it .	St
1.2.10	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	You know , I 've never use Norton Ghost , but for certain I could tell you how I resolved such problem .	St
1.3.2	When I bought new PC at first I wanted to keep my old HDD ( as it has much needed data ) , but it was only 40Gb .	St
1.3.3	So I after long searches I found clone disk software .	St
1.3.4	It 's the easiest and most convenient backup program .	St
1.3.5	I just create an exact image of my HDD and make a bootable CD ( due to highest level compression it takes not much space ) .	St
1.3.6	And recover cloned HDD onto new PC automatically .	St
1.3.7	If you 'll use the same way , you need n't reinstall Windows and you 'll automatically create pretty full backup of whole your system !	St
1.3.8	Only after restoring you 'll have to download upgrades for new PC configuration .	St
1.4.1	I 'm not sure of how this would work .	St
1.4.2	Do I need to reformat the HDD then start it with a bootable CD Then put in the clone cd and do a repair install ?	Ques
1.4.3	I 'm confused ?	Ques
1.4.4	Thanks for any help !	St
1.5.1	As I know , Acronis bootable CD does n't demand to format the HDD , as it installs clone over your old system , and if you format your HDD , nothing terrible will happen .	St
1.5.2	Also it does n't matter what is your new one HDD size , just it must n't be smaller then your old one .	St
