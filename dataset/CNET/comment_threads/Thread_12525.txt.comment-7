You said in your first post that your Win7 computer is connected to your router via an ethernet card.
If so, it does not need a wireless adapter and that should not affect it seeing and connecting to the printer.
While I bow to the change discussion about the router and I accept there may be some setting or other there that needs looking at, I'm still puzzled what the computer's wizard said when you used it to connect to this printer.
