<s> If Windows really only has support for 2 or 3 gigs of RAM, what is the point of putting in 4 gigs? </s>
<s> And is it 2 or 3 that Windows recognizes? </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, a 32-bit Windows OS can address approx 3 GB of memory. </s>
<s> Most programs can't go over 2 GB. </s>
<s> There is a 64-bit version option for Windows. </s>
<s> It permits addressing much larger memory space (2^64 instead of 2^32), but again programs need to be written properly to make use of it. </s>
<s> Moreover, I find on my math-rig that a lot of basic programs simply can't run on 64-bit. </s>
<s> So why sell computers with more RAM than is usable? </s>
<s> Well, it's kinda the same thing as with amplifiers in an audio system. </s>
<s> 1W is actually quite loud, and 10W can bust your eardrums. </s>
<s> But ignorant customers will flock to the 100W or higher systems, regardless of what they actually need. </s>
<s> Big numbers sell, because in a typical retail setting there's a multitude of products that will work just fine for a person, but they're only gonna buy one. </s>
<s> Would you buy a 720p TV if there were a 1080i for similar price? </s>
<s> Can you actually see any difference with your cable signal or DVD collection? </s>
<s> Most every field has examples of this same phenomenon -- bottom line is a manufacturer needs their product to compete. </s>
<s> Just the response I needed. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Yes, I am aware of 64-bit Windows and it's ability to address more memory, but I really don't consider that a very useful Windows as most of the programs I run, like you said, would not run on 64-bit. </s>
<s> So when I said &quot;Windows&quot; I had in mind &quot;32-bit Windows&quot; and should've specified. </s>
<s> And I definitely agree with you on how big numbers sell, and I was actually considering putting that in my original question. </s>
<s> Hard drive space, CPU speed, etc. </s>
<s> Big numbers do sell. </s>
<s> I just wanted to know if there was any practical use of the four gigs of ram, other than Linux or attempting to use 64-bit Windows, like if it somehow improved 32-bit Windows experience. </s>
<s> Is there any future possibility of a 32-bit system compatible with more RAM, or 64-bit systems actually becoming useful? </s>
<s> 32-bit systems can never go beyond their limit, in very much the same way that you can never have 10M phone numbers with 7-digit dialing. </s>
<s> As for 64-bit becoming more useful, I think we're on the way there. </s>
<s> Up to about a year ago, there were basically no 64-bit Windows programs. </s>
<s> All that stuff was for servers only. </s>
<s> In time software developers will ensure support for it, and perhaps more of them will not just support it, but actually make use of it. </s>
<s> Give it another year or two. </s>
<s> I appreciate your detailed response. </s>
<s> That answered my question. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The limit is actually 4GB minus address space reserved for other memory, most notably your graphics memory. </s>
<s> Without getting into the details, you might be able to use, say, 3.5GB out of your 4GB of RAM. </s>
<s> So there can be a benefit to going for 4GB over 3GB, but it is slight, especially since many programs may not be able to make efficient use of that level of RAM. </s>
<s> Also, you're still getting the hardware, so technically you could upgrade to a 64-bit OS later and get the full benefit. </s>
<s> I doubt many people will do this though. </s>
<s> The limit of RAM that can be addressed will usually be between 3 and 4 gigabytes, depending on how much address space is taken up by other hardware (e.g. </s>
<s> graphics card). </s>
<s> So you might, for example, be able to access 3.5GB out of your 4GB using a 32-bit Win XP installation (as in my case). </s>
<s> So there is a benefit to 3 over 4, but it is slight, especially since many programs can't make use of that level of RAM. </s>
<s> Also, you'll still own the hardware, so you could upgrade your OS and presumably get the full benefit later, although I doubt many people will do that. </s>
<s> looks like I posted this one twice. </s>
<s> whoops </s>
<s> Although each applications are limited to 2 GBytes, unless the /3G switch is used), other applications needs memory as does the operating system. </s>
<s> Alright thanks! </s>
<s> If you need a. to game intesively b. </s>
<s> Technology is ever advancing, sooner or later you'll need 4 gigabytes of RAM to do basic things </s>
<s> Which Windows are you talking about? </s>
<s> Windows XP and Vista support 4 gigabytes of RAM, minus any hardware devices that contain their own memory. </s>
<s> More expensive editions of Windows Server come in 32-bit edition but can use PAE to access up to 64 gigabytes of memory. </s>
<s> I believe if a computer comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM or more, it will almost certainly have 64-bit Windows preinstalled. </s>
<s> Or a 64-bit Linux distro, which is my preferred option. </s>
<s> At least when you have 4 gigabytes of RAM, you'll still be able to access a couple of hundred megs more than if you had 3 gigabytes... </s>
<s> Yeah, I recently switched over to 64-bit Ubuntu, and am loving it. </s>
<s> Too bad my laptop (hp dv6000) only has support for 2gb of RAM. </s>
<s> It is very common for a pc or laptop vendor to populate all the memory slots in their machine with what ever amount of memory you buy. </s>
<s> For example if you bought a machine with two slots and a total of 2 gig of memory chances are it will come with 2 x 1gig modules. </s>
<s> If you never need more memory this is not a problem but if you decied later that you need more you will have to replace and throw away at least on module. </s>
<s> This happens often enough to pay attention to. </s>
<s> Fo examle someone who bought a pc with xp home sp1 could survive with 386meg, thrive with 512. </s>
<s> As soon as sp2 came oout and antispyware software was added more memory was a REALLY good idea. </s>
<s> Ask sales for the difference in cost. </s>
<s> Some just wont do it but many will. </s>
<s> As far a big numbers... </s>
<s> Sometimes bigger numbers are a great idea. </s>
<s> Are you planning on saving a lot of music or videos to your harddrive (I like to use an external one myself so I can easily move it to other machines). </s>
<s> Are you going to be doiong any sound or graphic editing? </s>
<s> You will be glad you bought extra space and memory. </s>
<s> Like computer games with a lot of action and good graphics? </s>
<s> You'll want an upgraded memory card. </s>
<s> If all you are going to do is run office, email and brower then a 500.00 (or less) machine will probably be fine. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> I believe the motherboard for my current laptop can handle up to two gigs of RAM. </s>
<s> I can assume there are two slots, and both are filled with one gig memory. </s>
<s> It's a shame 'cause I'd want to upgrade my RAM to four, but looks like I can't. </s>
<s> As for your suggestions about big numbers, yeah I understand that. </s>
<s> I just didn't understand the memory deal. </s>
<s> I appreciate your responses! </s>
