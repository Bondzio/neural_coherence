i was wondering if you managed to resolve this problem?
while i noticed these posts are from 2008, i just purchased the same router... it's doing the exact same thing.
i did a firmware upgrade via the router before i started using it, but will attempt a manual download of the latest showing 1/28/2010 (well after this post) after a rest to see if that aids.
clearly it's frustrating since the modem works fine directly.
as for shutting off the wireless, that's not an option.
even though i prefer a wired network, i still have devices i like to roam around the house and building untethered.
i only upgraded my current router for the 10/100/1000 hope there was a solution.
thanks
