<s> Windows ME - ASUS A7N8X My DVD is not showing up in MY COMPUTER. </s>
<s> It has worked just fine from the day I installed it in this computer. </s>
<s> It has created no problems, but the other day when I inserted a disk, the led on the front of the unit showed that it was spinning up as usual but nothing came up on the screen. </s>
<s> When I went to MY COMPUTER to try to check on the disk I discovered that the DVD was no longer listed. </s>
<s> How do I get it back? </s>
<s> I am not sure where to start. </s>
<s> Doug, as a person I can understand your frustration. </s>
<s> As a tech, I regret to say, your best bet is to get a new operating system. </s>
<s> ME was supposed to be a step between the 9x OS's(95, 98, 98se) and the NT OS's (NT, 2000,XP). </s>
<s> The two cores are simply too vastly different. </s>
<s> ME doesn't work, Microsoft doesn't even sell it anymore (like I've posted in another response, if GM quit selling a car because it was too unreliable, would you keep driving it?). </s>
<s> That should say how good it is. </s>
<s> In A+ class, our instructor told us to not waste time fixing anything on ME. </s>
<s> What works today on ME may not work tomorrow. </s>
<s> I've seen everything from NIC's, drives, fonts, applications, video cards, and peripherals suddenly become unrecognized by ME. </s>
<s> I hate to tell you, but ME is a lost cause. </s>
<s> Yes, someone may post something to help this problem, but you'll be back in the near future with another problem. </s>
<s> You're better off saving your data now, and installing it into a different OS. </s>
<s> Well to begin the process you said the DVD drive has worked fine since you installed it, this could mean your only looking at a loose IDE cable either on the back of the drive or on the board itself.Verify if it shows in the control panel...go to Start, Settings, Control panel...double click System then look in the device manager for CD roms. </s>
<s> If it shows correctly you might have a defective drive or the software to play DVD's might be the problem...Try playing a audio CD. </s>
<s> Let me know what you find! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> By the way, XP is not without its share of problems I've seen everything from NIC's, drives, fonts, applications, video cards, and peripherals suddenly become unrecognized by XP!!! </s>
<s> It has a nasty habit of turning off DMA and reverting to pio mode for DVD/CD ROM drives! </s>
<s> Let's see what new problems arise from Service pack 2! </s>
<s> I'm actually missing both the DVD and CD drives on &quot;My computer.&quot; Happened overnight. </s>
<s> Was working fine. </s>
<s> I'm running ME, and it can't find the drives in other the device manager or on the DOS command screen. </s>
<s> What's my next step? </s>
<s> Windows knows your DVD and CD drives are there when your computer boots the BIOS. </s>
<s> Your BIOS then passes this info to Windows. </s>
<s> First check your BIOS settings usually you hit the delete or F1 key or what ever appears on your screen during the boot. </s>
<s> Once your in bios look at &quot;Standard CMOS features&quot;. </s>
<s> This should show your hard drive and DVD/CD drives. </s>
<s> If there not there, let the Bios &quot;auto detect&quot; the drives, if it can't then you have a loose ide cable on the drives or where the ide cable plugs into the mother. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
