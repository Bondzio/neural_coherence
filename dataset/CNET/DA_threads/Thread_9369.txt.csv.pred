1.1.1	I 've contacted soundblaster to no avail .	St

1.1.5	I really have no clue whats going on with it .	St
1.1.6	I googled it up most of today without finding any information or support for the hub , i 've tried the diagnostic program , updated all of my software/drivers , nothing has worked so far .	St
1.1.7	The product has worked fine for about a year now , anybody here had a similar problem ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you	St
1.2.1	What does Device Manager tell you about the hardware ?	Ques

1.3.1	under sound video and game controllers , nothing has any problems .	St
1.3.2	Under & quot ; other devices & quot ; there is a & quot ; multimedia audio controller & quot ; listed with a question mark next to it , however i dont know what that is .	St
1.3.3	I dont think the hub is listed , the things listed are : -Audio codecs -Creative game port -creative sb audigy 2 zs ( wdm ) -legacy audio drivers -legacy video capture devices -media control devices -standard game port -video codecs	St
1.4.1	Somewhat obvious is that SP2 may have bumped out the Audigy .	St
1.4.2	To test I would uninstall SP2 .	St

1.6.2	I 'm not sure about the Multimedia Device with the question mark .	St
1.6.3	Could be onboard audio , or may be related to the sound card .	St
1.6.4	I always try to eliminate all question marks by reinstalling .	St
1.6.5	I 'm unsure if this will solve the problem , but it 's easy enough to try .	St

1.8.2	can you recall any of the help creative gave you on the problem ?	Ques
1.8.3	i have updated everything , and am running on the xp pro sp2 with an asus a7n8x .	St
1.8.4	i ca n't think of anything else , and i am sick of waiting for creative to respond to my tech support request .	St
1.8.5	i use more features on the external hub than anything else , and would greatly appreciate any help anyon can give me ... . the only thing i havent checked is continuity on the firewire part of the cable to the external hub , as i do n't have a cable tester for firewire cables , and my probes on my multimeter are too large to fit in the slot on the end of the cable .	St
1.8.6	thanks for any help you can give me	Polite
