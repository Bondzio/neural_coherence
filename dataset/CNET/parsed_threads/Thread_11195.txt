<s> I bought this adapter from Radioshack called psx to usb adapter that lets you use a sony ps2 controller on your pc. </s>
<s> The problem is whenever I plug the adapter in the rear port usb ports I keep getting an usb device not recognized. </s>
<s> I installed the drivers before I plugged it in but that wont work. </s>
<s> When I install the drivers, I go to the game controller properties and its not there. </s>
<s> I then tried another game adapter and it worked. </s>
<s> The adapter keeps making windows xp say usb device not recognized and a window shows something that says unknown device. </s>
<s> I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that doesnt work. </s>
<s> The adapter comes with a driver cd and I used that. </s>
<s> I downloaded a driver from the radioshack site and it still doesnt do anything. </s>
<s> Sometimes when I plug it in it says found new hardware adn ready to use but nothing shows in the game controller properties. </s>
<s> I used it before before I reinstalled xp due to a mobo replacement and it worked before. </s>
<s> Any help on this? </s>
<s> because as far as i know there is no ps2 emulator out there that can play ps2 games on the computer...so y would u try to plug in a ps2 controller into your computer? </s>
<s> what..u dont like the game pads designed for pcs? </s>
<s> Maybe your gamepad is messed up. </s>
<s> Go back to Radioshack and exchange for a new one, and it that doesn't work, call the company of the gamepad, cause they chould help you out... </s>

<s> It worked before I reinstalled xp and now when I plug it ,it keeps saying usb device not recognized. </s>
<s> I dont have the receipt and the adapter doesnt have a brand name except for radioshack. </s>
