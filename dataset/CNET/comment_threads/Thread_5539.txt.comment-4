Your Card reader maybe a USB hub and will keep the icon on.
If You have a SATA hard drive.
The Windows OS reads SATA drives as a USB drive.
I have two SATA drives and I had the same thing you are having.
Right click on the icon and a popup window will tell you what is keeping the icon on.
In your post &quot; I uninstalled then disconncted it (card reader).
On reboot the icon had gone.
Reconnected the reader and icon reappeared.&quot; I think your reader is a USB hub.
