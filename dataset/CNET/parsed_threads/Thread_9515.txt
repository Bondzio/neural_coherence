<s> I've scanned a number of pages into the hard drive of my computer with my HP 6110 All in One fax/scanner/copier. </s>
<s> I want to combine them to send them as a single document by email attachment (it's a brochure with 8 pages). </s>
<s> The HP Photo & Imaging software program I downloaded on my computer doesn't seem to allow me initially to scan all the documents into a single file nor allow me to combine them later. </s>
<s> I've also tried playing with the attach files command of my Hotmail account to combine them there, without success. </s>
<s> I've read all the documentation and used the help function to no avail. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how that can be done? </s>
<s> Many thanks if you can help. </s>
<s> The easiest way would probably be to open each image in an editor (Photoshop, Paint, etc) and copy the image, then paste it into a Word document. </s>
<s> Just paste all the image in, then blow each up so that there is one per page. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
