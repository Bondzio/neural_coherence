I have a hard drive out of a Dell Inspiron Mini1012 that has the original O/S (Win7) and all factory info on it (replaced it with a SSD and did a fresh install of Win7).
Is it possible to put this drive in a Dell Dimension that I have upgraded with a decent graphics card, sound card, 3gb RAM, new 3.06gb NorthwoodHT processor, and am running Windows 8 Consumer Preview on?
I have the original Dell install discs and all.
I also have Acronis True Image that I can back-up with.
I see that I don't have anything to lose to try, but would like to have some input on proper procedure/technique if possible!
I can always put the old drive back in if it doesn't work.
Also, I have a IDE to SATA conversion board, so hopefully the new drive will be recognized.
I should also mention that I no longer have the Inspiron Mini, which may be an issue if info from it is needed.
