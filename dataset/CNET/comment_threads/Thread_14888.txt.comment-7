OK, I think I see waht you are saying.
I do plan on getting vista, so as long as I have vista I should be able to run DX 10 on a video card I buy today, like an ATI 1900.
But if I keep using XP I shouldnt expect to be able to run DX 10.
It all makes sense now.
Forgive me, I am a little slow on the uptake
