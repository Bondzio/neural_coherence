I ve got a Shuttle PC with MCE 2005 I m wanting to hook up to my Panasonic Plasma. Problem is the Plasma is a ED so the Native Res is 852 x 480, not exactaly PC friendly. It will display this res. if using a DVI - HDMI cable. Is there anyway to get a more PC compatable resolution while using this connection? I know if I drop down to S-Vid I can then change the res based of my Video card but I m then using a lower quality connection. So my question is how should I hook this two gadgets together to make them work best? TIA

Here is a site for them: http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/DVI-hdmi_cables.html Scroll down, and you will see them. I'm not a genius about Plasmas, but I have one question: Can they change resolution, and if yes, what are the other possible resolutions? ~Ibrahim
