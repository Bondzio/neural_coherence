You can also use a old 98 or ME startup disk and boot to dos and type fdisk. choose large disk format, delete partition then make new. you would need to go into your bios first and change to floppy boot first.

Probably fat32. from a run line type &quot;convert c:&quot;(or d: or whatever)&quot; /fs:ntfs&quot; to convert to ntfs. Size: Is it 7.82 or 78.2 ? Computers think in a base 2 system, so where we think 1000 MBs to a GB they think 1024. So reporting is usally off because that.
6311	6	59579	724127	707366	teknewbie	1/29/05 10:18 AM	1.10699388E12	still stuck	after I make new partition what do I do, I trie to format from dos but couldnt so I used win 98 cd because I do not have enough memory to run win 2000 and the hard drive still only came up showing 7.82 gig's. btw the option i was to choose when it was time to make new partition was make primary dos partition correct?
