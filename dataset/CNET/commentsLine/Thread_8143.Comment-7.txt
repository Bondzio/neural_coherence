try something like the sony vrd-vc10.
it's an mpeg2 encoder and dvd+-rw burner built-in.
all you need to do is hook up your vcr to it, and then put a dvd+r disc into the unit and start converting with the push of a button.
if you want to do edits, you can still use this unit (or the hundreds of others that can also dump your movie onto a computer), do your edits (i recommend videoredo, videoredo.com), then burn using a dvd burner or that same vrd-vc10 for example.
alternatively, you can have your movies converted professionally.
there are many conversion shops to choose from.
for example cheers
