what is your pc currently connected to and how?
if you go straight to a modem, then you buy a standard wireless router.
if you're connected to a wired router, you add a wireless access point to that.
if you want others to connect through your pc, what you'd need is a wireless network interface device that can act as an ap and be bridged to your wired nic.
in any event, i think you're looking for an ap and not a router unless you have some other purpose here.
maybe if you could explain more about your plan, it would get you a better answer.
