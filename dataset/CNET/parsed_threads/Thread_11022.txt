<s> I have had a Netgear WGR614v7 for about 18 months. </s>
<s> Attached to it was a MAC laptop (Leopard), IBM desktop (Windows XP), a HP printer and a Lenovo laptop (Vista). </s>
<s> The desktop and printer were wired, with the MAC and Thinkpad operating wirelessly. </s>
<s> This past week, the router went bad (the cable company verified that it was the issue) so I bought a new WGR6214v10. </s>
<s> I installed it, and everything works as expected except the Lenovo laptop. </s>
<s> If I connect the ethernet cable to the laptop, it works fine, but it will not work wirelessly. </s>
<s> I have spent some time with a technical guy who could not find the problem and suspected that my Norton anti-virus might be the culprit. </s>
<s> After spending some time with a Netgear tech this afternoon, he felt that the anti-virus software was not the issue that my wireless adapters might be out of date. </s>
<s> I am not a computer maven, but this sounds a bit like &quot;get it off my plate and go somewhere else.&quot; Do any of you experts have any suggestions, or should I try another brand of router? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Try it setup the forum's advised way. </s>
<s> (see top of the forum, defaults, wpa, etc.) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Another post had them tinker with the MTU down to 1400 but it has been years since I found that tweak needed. </s>
<s> Might be making a comeback? </s>

<s> I know to suspect that. </s>
<s> When Norton expires it kills the internet connection. </s>
<s> I have to bite my tongue what I think about that. </s>
