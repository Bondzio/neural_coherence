<s> I just moved into a home that has and office. </s>
<s> There is a wall plate with a jack to run Cat5e to the upstairs bedroom. </s>
<s> I plugged that office wall jack into the router, and the bedroom jack into my laptop and have a perfect connection. </s>
<s> My problem is that i need that wire to go to a theater room at a different part of the house (still upstairs like the bedroom). </s>
<s> I bought a 50ft cat5e cable and a coupler and connected everything. </s>
<s> When i did i dont get a connection. </s>
<s> I double checked the wiring and all seemed correct. </s>
<s> I then replaced the 50ft cable with a new 50ft cable thinking it was bad but same results. </s>
<s> I finally tried a shorter 6ft cable and it worked fine. </s>
<s> Any ideas??? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Your next job is to check that the wire pairs were done properly in the wall jacks. </s>
<s> There are 2 standards and one is for something other than Ethernet and will cause issues like you reported. </s>
