although i prefer industrial over trance (check out &quot;porcelain and the tramps&quot; for a rocking underground time) we can all be forgiving on the dance floor when we take a look at where the other folk are standing, and respect their space.
like i said, try the disc utility in the finder window &gt; applications &gt; utilities &gt; disc utility path.
select the main hard drive in the side bar and click on repair permissions at the bottom of the window.
if you see a whole big list of repairs being made, then it might indicate that this small regular maintenance has been neglected.
repairing permissions is akin to defraging/registry clean up (but different)... and can make a rough running mac act like a new machine.
bottom line however, is a machine with so little ram isn't going to run too well.
a gig of ram, minimum is needed to run video applications smoothly.
