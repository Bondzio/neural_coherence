a quick look does not show me that the bios supports that ide mode you need.
this means not only must you find all the drivers but you'll need a floppy drive to perform the following.
use google and type this in.
-&gt; xp f6 floppy sata install.
i find most folk are not ready for such an install.
-&gt; if you go back to windows 8, why not add a start button so they are not as lost?
they are free now.
