1.1.1	HI guys , Need to know if I should get a dual *simultaneous* band router .	St
1.1.2	This wireless adaptor is N class with an ISM Maximum Frequency of 2.4Ghz , and a UNII Maximum Frequency of 5 Ghz .	St
1.1.3	Does this mean it will work in the more stable and faster 5 Ghz band , or is it strictly 2.4Ghz ?	Ques
1.1.4	I have to buy a new router so for $ 100 more , I 'll get one that does both bands , *simultaneously* , but if this adaptor ca n't run on 5Ghz , I 'll save some money and just get a dual band .	St
1.1.5	Thanks for any help !	St
1.2.1	802.11a ( U-NII ) bands : 5.15 to 5.25 would mean you want 802.11a gear and not the 802.11n 5.8GHz gear I 've seen .	St
1.2.2	So the dual band router is unlikely to help .	St
1.3.1	Interesting .	St
1.3.2	I 'm running it ( streaming HD movies from office PC about 70 feet away ) on an older G router .	St
1.3.3	I 'd like to get an N router for the laptop and netbooks around the house and hopefully the TV can run on it too .	St
1.3.4	The only thing that would need the G is the PS3 .	St
1.4.1	About post 18 in this forum 's sticky reveals how to use more than one wifi router to get more over the air wifi bandwidth .	St
