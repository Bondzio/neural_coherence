<s> I am running a 2100S Rev320R I20 SCSI V001.38 in Raid5 we want to upgrade the drives to 300GB. </s>
<s> According to documentation I should go into storage manager mark the drive as failed, replace it with the new drive, let it rebuild then repeat the process for each drive. </s>
<s> I have installed storage manager' version 4.40.00 (16593) but it tells me that No controllers were found. </s>
<s> Time to call its maker and arrange for repair or replacements. </s>
<s> The drives are working fine. </s>
<s> The system is fine, just approaching capacity. </s>
<s> We can access the RAID in BIOS with SMOR but want to do the drive upgrade with system up and running not to disrupt users. </s>
<s> The product has failed. </s>
<s> Ask its maker what to do next. </s>
