you were on the right track.
i'm not exactly sure what you're looking for because you mentioned you want a home printer and was looking at the the epson workforce 845, which can be used for personal stuff but is more on the high capacity end.
i'm also assuming that you want a color inkjet instead of a laser since you were looking at the 845. if my assumptions are correct then there are 2 choices that are good, one is the epson workforce wf-3540 which is a 4 in 1 color, and if you like hp you can try the hp officejet pro 8600 (which has 3 versions, you can take the lowest one).
they both cost around $120 to $150 range but the ink costs are low, see here , which also has other options if my assumptions were incorrect.
