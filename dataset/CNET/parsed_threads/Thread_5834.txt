<s> Hi i have partitioned my macbook hard drive to run windows as well (using bootcamp) i have come to realize that i did not put enough space for my windows hard drive. </s>
<s> Is it possible to add space to it now or is it to late? </s>
<s> I believe there is an option to change the partition size P </s>
<s> take a look at a piece of software called CampTune. </s>
<s> It claims to be able to modify the Boot Camp partition size P </s>
