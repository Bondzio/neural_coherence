the killer item in your post is that &quot;emulated games&quot; item.
such require multi-ghz cpus and some many hundred watts of heat to get out of a micro-atx case.
this is an exercise in &quot;how to build your own easy bake oven.&quot; there are those combo small box units but that budget item makes that a non-starter.
since budget is an issue, do not use the micro-atx case.
