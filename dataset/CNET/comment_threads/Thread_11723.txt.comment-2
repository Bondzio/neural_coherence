At the office we have the Nexus 7 (original) and at home the Fire 7 HD.
The Nexus has the edge on the Kindle as there are more book readers there and you don't have as closed an ecosystem.
Games are a few more too.
But for Amazon Prime Video the Fire 7 HD is hard to beat as we have ours connected to the HDTV with HDMI.
It's the best player I've seen in years.
Tough choice but I like the fact the Nexus is more open and still has the Kindle app.
