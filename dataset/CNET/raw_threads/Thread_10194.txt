I'd like to know if there is a difference between what is considered &quot;shared memory&quot; and what is considered &quot;shared video memory&quot;. Thanks in advance.

If you don't have actual &quot;dedicated memory&quot; on some device, then whatever device(usually video) is using system memory for it needs. It will use what it needs or expands on what it already has. No matter any &quot;shared&quot; memory from actual system memory installed gets used. If you increase system memory, do so it usually does better qand if shared presents a larger memory resource. Don't confuse the term &quot;memory&quot; for a stored media device which in turn gets used as memory as well. This is generally speaking some type of &quot;virtual memory&quot; on a temporary basis. However, as already asked of you, in what way has the terms shared and shared video come to light? tada -----Willy
