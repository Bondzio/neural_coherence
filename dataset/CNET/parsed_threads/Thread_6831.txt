<s> I'm going out on a limb here, and am not sure if this is the right forum... Plz correct me if I am wrong. </s>
<s> Ok, Optorite DD0201 burner, Princo 1X media (yes, I know, thats 2 strikes against me, dont remind me), and yes, the media is supported by the burner. </s>
<s> The problem is, is that i have failed 8 out of 15 burns. </s>
<s> It burns the full disc (using nero 6 of course), but then, when I look on the disc, there is &quot;nothing there&quot;. </s>
<s> If I look at the disc using a program like DVDinfoPro or Alcohol 120%, It sees that there is information on the disc, but still does not know what it is. </s>
<s> ... uh, why? </s>
<s> Whats going on... </s>
<s> I cant figure it out. </s>
<s> I get this problem when either ripping a DVD or burning data to a DVD. </s>
<s> I have also noticed the problem when burning HD-Burns (look it up, its similar to overburn, allowing you to stick 1.4 gigs on a single cd). </s>
<s> Plz help. </s>
<s> If you post, then sit at the forum, and press &quot;refresh&quot; to see if there has been a reply, it reposts... That is a really weird script that would do such a thing... </s>
<s> I am sorry, please delete this duplicate. </s>
<s> If the write fails, there can be many causes, but let's go over the basics? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> FIRMWARE. </s>
<s> Be sure you find the latest firmware for your DVD recorder. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Hedge your bets. </s>
<s> For me, I've very picky and my personal machine has latest BIOS in all parts (motherboard, CDRW, DVDRW and such.) </s>
<s> I also fit the newer 80 conductor cables on all IDE connections and with that the jumpers are CS. </s>
<s> This gives the signals a little more change to not be corrupted. </s>
<s> The power supply for this box is at least 50 or more Watts oversized to avoid any brownout or stress of the PSU. </s>
<s> Cooling is simple. </s>
<s> I just leave a big hole where I can for the air to move. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The handling of the media. </s>
<s> DVD media is some 7 times more dense than CDR/W. </s>
<s> You want spotless, dustless surfaces, a clean work area and if you start to get errors, a pass of the CD/DVD lens cleaner is not a bad idea. </s>
<s> Mind you I have only used that on my drives about once in a year. </s>
<s> It's not something you do a lot. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Old shool burning. </s>
<s> Back when we had 486s, you couldn't move the mouse once the recording began or you might get a coaster. </s>
<s> Today, people seem to think you can play games, surf the net or more. </s>
<s> Maybe you can, maybe you can't? </s>
<s> So be careful about that. </s>
<s> If you are making coasters, then it's time to examine the above and consider just doing what you need to when you record. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> All firmware and bios' are up to date. </s>
<s> Drive is brand new (lens cleaning should not be an issue) and the media is unhandled until placed directly into the burner. </s>
<s> I have never &quot;failed&quot; a burn, they are all &quot;successful&quot; just the data on it does not appear... Like i said, programs show that there is data on the drive (Alcohol 120% has something called a CD/DVD manager that allows you to read in hexidecimal, every sector of the disc... </s>
<s> It shows data throughout the entire disc) but windows itself cannot see the files on the disc... </s>
<s> I also burn the discs not at full capacity since this is cheap media... What else could be an issue? </s>
<s> There is far too many ways to write a disk that windows will have nothing to do with and I won't get into that deeply at all. </s>
<s> In short, you didn't really reveal WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO until the second post. </s>
<s> But there is a solution. </s>
<s> I can't help you fix your setup, but will share that DVD SHRINK seems to work fine at moving your personal DVD from one DVD to its backup. </s>
<s> Remember we have to stick on a straight and narrow path here and must violate neither the forum policy or other... Bob </s>
<s> Oh, no, I already know that :P The recent problem has been only with data DVDs... </s>
<s> I currently dont have hard drive space for making backups, but I need to get data off my hard drive. </s>
<s> DVD shrink cant do that... Perhaps I screwed up something in Nero? </s>
<s> is there a way to revert to defaults? </s>
<s> Thx. </s>
<s> DATA on DVD is a little perilous since the FILE SYSTEM could be limited to exactly 4GB. </s>
<s> I wish there was a FAQ about this area, but in short, if I use NERO to make a DATA DVD, it seems to sort it out. </s>
<s> I can't comment on the software you used since I don't use that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
