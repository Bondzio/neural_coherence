I started a small at home business of taking digital pictures of weddings, family portraits, school pictures and things like that.
I am getting more shoots than I ever thought I would and my AMD 4200 and 3 gigs of pc3200 ram is just too slow.
I will be changing the mother board, Ram and CPU, but don't know if I should be looking at a duel or quad core processor.
It will be a Intel and so far I have looked at a E8600 duel core processor.
Also my computer has the built in card reader does that make a difference?
I am using a Sandisk Extreme III CF card for the camera.
I am running Windows Vista home premium and Adobe CS3 Any advise would be appreciated.
Thanks Wayne
