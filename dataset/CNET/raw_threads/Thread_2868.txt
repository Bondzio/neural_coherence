I didn't know that my video card would not support its 1680 x 1050 native resolution and that all my stuff would look wonky. (I sold the 15&quot; standard LCD I was using) I don't use it for games at all, just surfing the web, digital pictures, and home video editing. I have been doing ALOT of research on new cards and keep comming across one issue or another so I'm hopeing someone here can help me out. Here is my system: Compaq Presario 3000 AMD Ath 2.16Ghz Windows XP 512 mem 160 G HD Model # SR1030NX I thought I found a good deal on a card but then HP Chat support told me that I need an AGP card. Some of the cards I'm considering have an analog max res of 2048 x 1536 x 32bit x 85 Hz and their digital max res is only 1600 x 1200 so I couldn't use the dvi connection. None of them have a widescreen standard res so I would have to use Powerstrip to customize the res. (doesn't work with my current card.) Here are the cards I am considering and the end cost to me: EVGA GeForce FX5200 128MB AGP $25 EVGA GeForce 6200 256MB 64-bit DDR AGP $29.99 EVGA GeForce 7300GT 512MB 128-bit DDR2 AGP $66 (this one has a max digitial res of 2560 x 1600 but is a bit more pricey) Cards built with widescreen resolutions are out of my price range. My questions are, will these cards work with my computer, will they speed up or slow down my system, is there another option I haven't thought of yet, will the max digital make a $40 difference, and any other advise would be appreciated. Let me know if any other specs on my system are needed, I haven't added anything to this computer (other than a new power supply)

4243	2	284620	2708556	2708515	jconner	2/19/08 9:26 AM	1.20341316E12	I run dual widescreen ACER 21&quot; monitors	on an AGP 8X using an nvidia quadro 4 980 128MB with dual DVI out. I've had no issues with widescreen and higher resolutions. They are easy to find on E-Bay and are under $50 (Used pulls from workstations). Originally they ran around $300 and are near the top of the line AGP cards for non gaming needs. Note you can buy a DVI to RGB adapters to support RGB monitors. Haven't tried the other cards you mentioned.

I contacted both manufatorers, of the monitor and the card, and they both said contact the other we can't do anything for you. Acer doesn't have a driver to download saying it's &quot;plug and play&quot; while I allready have the newest version for my card (which is a few years old anyway) and no dice. Not really looking for a solution to my current set up because I have pretty much exhausted that avenue speaking with reps from Acer, HP, and the maker of my card (don't remember atm), with the only answer being, get a new card. I just want to be sure I get one that will satisfy my needs while not screwing up my pc and breaking the bank.
4243	5	284620	2708607	2708601	ramarc	2/19/08 10:59 AM	1.20341874E12	get the geforce 6200	it will handle the widescreen without issue. and it will probably be faster than the video card you've got now (whose make/model you didn't mention).

Sadly the dummies manning the support lines may be instructed to never work with you on that. I can't find it since I can't find the Acer model number in your post. Bob

Get the nvidia 6200 as suggested. Cheap and it works.

I read the other post too and am wondering if this is an &quot;onboard&quot; and what exactly that means. I was assuming I would be replacing one card with another, is that not the case? Sounds like the 6200 is going to be the way to go. I have a how to site here: http://www.playtool.com/pages/installvid/install.html It tells me i need to also update my mother board chipset: http://www.playtool.com/pages/chipsetdrivers/chipset.html Now that I'm inching closer to getting a new card I want to be sure I do it right.

Judging by your response, you may need recovery if your system crashes. Insert your new card into the AGP slot, plug your monitor to it and your PC should automatically detect it first time you power up. Windows may ask you to install card drivers, in which case, use the CD accompanying the card. I doubt you'll have to install new chipset drivers. Take your time and do it right the first time.

Here are the last few questions I have: When I change it am I going to be taking out the old one or does &quot;on board&quot; mean it stays in? If so do I need to do anything to dissable it? Sense this one has 256 mem built in do i need to do anything to free up the mem the old one was using? If I'm not swapping it out will it be obvious where to put the new one after I open the pc? I'll create a system restore before I do it but I hope I won't need it. Thanks for all the info!
4243	12	284620	2709516	2709335	samkh	2/20/08 9:45 AM	1.2035007E12	Look at	the board in the HP link above. See the VGA connector at back? Isn't that what you are using currently? There's no VGA card in your PC. That's what &quot;integrated&quot; means. See the AGP slot? Put the 6200 in the slot. Somewhere in your BIOS may allow you to choose PCI or AGP video first. Default is normally PCI and usually you don't have to mess with it. If you get no video out when you power on with the card in, connect the monitor back to the mobo VGA and switch the BIOS to AGP first.
4243	13	284620	2709563	2709516	vidcard	2/20/08 10:54 AM	1.20350484E12	I don't see the AGP slot...	I see now how its integrated but there are 3 pci slots on the board (i thought it was not pci compatible which is why the AGP card) and I don't see a slot for the AGP? So I'm just a bit confused when you say I may have to choose between PCI and AGP in the BIOS.
4243	14	284620	2709565	2709563	vidcard	2/20/08 11:03 AM	1.20350538E12	Now I see it...	It was hiding, lol. But I'm still wondering about the PCI slots...
4243	15	284620	2709566	2709563	samkh	2/20/08 11:05 AM	1.2035055E12	Come again?	Is your mobo physically different from the picture in the link? ie. no AGP connector on mobo? Check right now and if you find no AGP connector, cancel the 6200 order!
4243	16	284620	2709568	2709566	vidcard	2/20/08 11:22 AM	1.20350652E12	No, the second post said I found it...	I just missed seeing it on the pic is all, I found it but the PCI slots are what I don't get now. Why would my pc not be compatible with a pci card if it has 3 slots for them? I could have gotten a better card for less money...
