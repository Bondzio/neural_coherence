1.1.1	I purchased a 120GB hard drive from NewEgg for my Sony Vaio VGN-S150 laptop .	St
1.1.2	I first installed XP Pro on it but uninstalled it cause I couldnt find the drivers for the USB Controller , or the mass storage device ( if you could help with that , i would install pro which i need again ) .	St
1.1.3	When Pro was installed the OS saw the 120GB .	St
1.1.4	Since I could n't find the those 2 drivers off of sony 's site ( had all the other drivers ) I decided to just uninstalled Pro and install the OS with the VGN-S150 recovery kit which has home edition which i really do n't want .	St
1.1.5	With the recovery cd 's everything looked great , but when I check to see how much space the recovery took up on the hard drive it said it took up 3.08GB , and only 15GB are free .	St
1.1.6	I reinstalled with the recovery cd 's and same thing happend .	St
1.1.7	In BIOS the the system saw the whole 120GB drive .	St
1.1.8	So know the system see it , but for some reason the recovery cd 's partition it wrong or something .	St
1.1.9	Any Ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Not yet .	Res
1.3.2	I thought I would try here to see what you all would say before all of that .	St
1.4.1	I 'd see what disk management has to report .	St
1.4.2	It 's possible the drive was cloned and along with it the partition sizes .	St
1.4.3	disk or drive management might show the unused space .	St
