Will I notice significant performance increase if I add 512MB for a total 1GB RAM? Also, will the extra RAM significantly decrease battery life?

How much? Probably negligable. Wayne Loud pipes, long necks, and loose women. Nowhar but Texas!

The reason is simply that most apps. don't require that much ram. Some of the new 64 bit technology may be able to use more ram, but for a 32 bit system, 512 mb should handle the load with ease.

My machine is a Notebook with Intel Pentium M 730 Processor (2 MB L2 Cache, 1.6 GHz, 533 MHz FSB) Centrino, 512MB DDR. I was thinking to upgrade RAM but now I think I do not need to upgrade. Your discussion helps me to take a right decision to upgrade RAM or not to upgrade. Thank you again.
