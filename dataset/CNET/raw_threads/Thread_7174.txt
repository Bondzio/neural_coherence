14582	0	369131	3176615	NR	wanness	11/17/09 2:47 AM	1.25842602E12	Backup	I have just installed a 400 GHD to be used strictly for backup. My computer sees the HD, but when I try to utilize it for a backup, I kept getting the message, &quot;unreadable&quot;. I went ahead and formatted it, (NTFS) and tried again. It will try to do the backup and then stops with a message that backup failed. Any ideas? Thanks, Bill
