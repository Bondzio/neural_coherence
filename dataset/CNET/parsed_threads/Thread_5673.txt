<s> My desktop computer is connected to the internet by an ethernet cable from my cable internet modem. </s>
<s> I now also want to hook up a wireless router to my cable internet modem via ethernet. </s>
<s> BUT, my cable internet modem only has one ethernet out connection. </s>
<s> Is there such a thing as an Ethernet splitter or is there some other solution? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Example: Cable modem -&gt; Wifi (or no wifi) Router -&gt; The bunch of PCs. </s>
