<s> I'm looking to purchase one of these models and wonder if anyone can compare the performance of the SX2800-07 with the Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 processor and 4GB RAM against the SX2840-01 with the Intel Core i3-530 processor and 6GB RAM. </s>
<s> Any comments would be appreciated. </s>
<s> The core 2 Quad runs 4 actual threads and the i3 runs 2 with hyperthreading. </s>
<s> The i3 also has graphics on the CPU. </s>
<s> While I don't have personal experience with either of these as mine are different, I think you'd want to look at your personal needs. </s>
<s> If you want to game, you want your own graphics card and not the i3. </s>
<s> If you like to open multiple programs, you want more actual threads. </s>
<s> http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=39107 shows VTx not to be a solid YES. </s>
<s> I won't detail what this CPU feature is but it is growing in importance to many. </s>
<s> http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=46472 shows a solid yes to VTx and given the higher clock rate I could safely bet that for almost every use this would outperform the older q8300. </s>
<s> But if you could get the old gear for cheap, it's still a great choice if the price is right. </s>

<s> Thanks for the comments. </s>
<s> I'm not into intensive gaming. </s>
<s> I'm leaning towards the i3-530 machine because of more memory, newer chip architecture and a larger hard drive. </s>
<s> Cost of 2 machines is comparable. </s>
