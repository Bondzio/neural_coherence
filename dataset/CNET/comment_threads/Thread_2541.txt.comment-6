Wayne, thanks for all the help, but I still have some questions.
I want to print form both computers, d-link says I need a di-707 (router w/ print server), dwl-2100ap (access point), along with the dwlg520 adapter, I want to go with the 520 and just the di624 router.
Can I enable windows file&print sharing and get the same job done without any problems?
Can I use my scanner with the same setup.
