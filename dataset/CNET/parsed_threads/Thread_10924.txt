<s> My PC is in a sort of loop. </s>
<s> It starts up and gets to the Windows XP start up screen then shuts it self down and restarts. </s>
<s> It will do this over and over as long as I leave it on. </s>
<s> Anyone know what is happening? </s>
<s> But your details are so light that the only fix is to reload the OS or take it to the shop. </s>
<s> One could try a boot to SAFE MODE to see if the OS is not so damaged that repairs could be attempted, but that detail is not known. </s>
<s> -&gt; Are you seeing those words in red when you post? </s>

<s> It will allow me to choose safe mode but it still shuts down at the same point. </s>
<s> I have tried all the selections it offers and none make it past the Windows Cover screen. </s>
<s> As soon as the cover screen goes off the PC restars. </s>
<s> If you have the full XP CD you can install a parallel install of the OS and gain access to your files to back up prior to attempter repair of the OS. </s>
<s> Since ALL safe modes fail (your reply), even the command line one, we now face an OS repair and failing that an OS install. </s>
<s> Here's the links for the parallel install. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=xp+parallel+install Use the article you can follow. </s>
<s> If none work for you, then it's shop time since the hardware has likely failed. </s>

<s> I will try the parallel install. </s>
<s> Thank you again for your help! </s>
<s> I'm running into more machines where the person installing XP skips installing motherboard and SATA drivers. </s>
<s> On some machines this will work for a short while (I won't discuss why) but later the machine goes into this reboot loop as noted. </s>
<s> Reinstalling the OS works but later the same issue comes up. </s>
<s> Some call XP flawed on this point but I think it's a matter Microsoft should have addressed rather than pushed off to telling us to install the OS properly. </s>
<s> Yes they are busy on Vista but how many run XP and encounter driver issues? </s>
<s> Here's an example proper SATA install link. </s>

<s> This has happened on my Desktop a few times I did a OS reload it worked for a while but did not fix the Core issue the core issue for me is my hard drive is bad. </s>
<s> Corruption basically is what is happening windows can not find files so it restarts and trys again. </s>
<s> Boot into repair mode F8 and try to skdisk or try SPINRITE. </s>
<s> See if you can salvage the HD but eventually you will probably need to buy a new one. </s>
<s> That is only one cause for the symptom but the most likely one. </s>
