in a few words, not plug and play.
as there were too many of these you need to first install the drivers for that before you plug that in then it may work.
but here's the thing.
i find such very hard on folk to the point a new laser printer costs less than finding a guru to sort it out.
it is a nice printer, lasted over 10 years around here but again, unless you do your own support and kept notes and all the drivers it's rare to see it work again today.
