above i stated the game was trying to run @ 75 hertz, this was wrong.
think im reading to many forums and getting burned out.
it says(&quot;not optimum mode, recommended mode: 1920 x 1080 @ 60 hertz).
the games highest setting is 1280 x 1024. this is where the problem is i think.
the monitor wants the game run @ 1920 x 1080, which it cannot do.
i have posted to samsung support but have received no reply as of yet.
