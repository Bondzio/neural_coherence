i don't really know what that means.
a new case for the external hd?
and then what?
take the hd out of the old case?
basically, again: i can't get the external hd to show up when i click &quot;my computer&quot; even when the external hd appears to be turned on.
so i can't even run data recovery software until i can get the computer to recognize that the external hd is hooked up, right?
