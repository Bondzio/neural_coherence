&quot;free music files&quot; seems like P2P (limewire and such).
Using programs like that is a well-known risk.
It's likely that you should have said: &quot;My daughter stores free music files on the 100 GB disk and while doing so has allowed malware/viruses/trojans on the 40 GB disk.&quot; But, to be fair, that's not sure.
There can be many other reasons for a PC to be slow, especially if it's an older one like this (slow CPU, not enough RAM, too many programs active, installed and running a lot of junk); but malware is common reason also.
