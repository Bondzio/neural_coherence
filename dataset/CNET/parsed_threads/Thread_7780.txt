<s> I have 2 Dell 800 mghz computers with 256 mb of ram running windows XP. </s>
<s> When you boot up it will show the Dell logo and the time line for loading the BIOS but it takes a long time and then it will com up in dos with the message &quot;no hard drive detected press f1 to continue or f2 to enter setup&quot; If I press f1 it will boot up perfect. </s>
<s> If I go into setup it shows the hard drive. </s>
<s> I have flashed the BIOS, changed the ram, put in a new hard drive, and reinstalled XP because I thought it might be service pack 2. </s>
<s> Any info would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Robert Frazier </s>
<s> Look around in your bios, perhaps in the boot area. </s>
<s> See if you have an option something like 'delay IDE initial'. </s>
<s> If so raise the amount up a little at a time. </s>
<s> What do you have the boot order set to? </s>
<s> Did it just start doing this one day, or is this a new drive you upgraded to? </s>
<s> Is there anyway to retain the drive config in the bios settings or does it have to detect each time you boot? </s>
<s> I'm suspecting a dead battery on the motherboard but more info would help. </s>
<s> Scott. </s>
<s> Having the exact problem with new Dell. </s>
<s> I added a 2nd hd. </s>
<s> All o.k. </s>
<s> for 2 months or so Then bam, I turned the computer on, and get message that neither of my hds are found - BIOS shows drives as &quot;unknown&quot;, both are set to auto. </s>
<s> I checked all connections, reseated memory, unplugged and replugged cables. </s>
<s> Got same message only this time f1 started it up to the os (xp). </s>
<s> Ran Dell diagnostics - everything passed. </s>
<s> Restarted, same thing all over again. </s>
<s> HDs not found. </s>
<s> (Floppy and CD drives work fine).Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I did more research - am having same problem. </s>
<s> Dell suggests the following. </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kb/en/document?dn=FA1022544 See specifically ,Clearing NVRAM, about mid page. </s>
<s> Don't know your specific model so you may want to find out how to set jumpers for maintenance mode before you clear NVRAM. </s>
<s> I have bookmarked instructions for 4600C, the one I have. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> I'm going to give it a try tomorrow. </s>
<s> Denise </s>
<s> THANKS FOR THE INFO. </s>
<s> SORRY I TOOK SO LONG GETTING BACK. </s>
<s> I COULD NOT FIND THE FORUM. </s>
<s> HOW DUMB IS THAT? </s>
<s> DID THE DELL IDEA FIX THE PROBLEM? </s>
<s> THANLS ROBERT </s>
<s> Unplug the slave drive to see if the problem persists. </s>
<s> If not, my guess is an insufficient power. </s>
<s> Dell is known for installing minimal power supplies. </s>
<s> Extra drives can stress the undersized psu. </s>
<s> I fixed two earlier Dells by replacing the PS since it was having trouble recognizing the drives. </s>
<s> Be very careful with the new Dell systems as they have a Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design. </s>
<s> This means that pin 1 and 3 have ground on them where the standard ATX has +5 volts and a couple other pin mismatches. </s>
<s> see: http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp?p=339053 Warning: if you hook a standard ATX up you will blow the board. </s>
