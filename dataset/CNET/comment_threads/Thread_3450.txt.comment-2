For Windows 98, which is DOS based, this message is proper.
Try installing the OS proper and see what happens.
I don't duplicate how to install any OS here for the simple reason there are hundreds of posts about this.
In short, run FDISK, remove and create the partition.
FORMAT C:/S and then install Windows 98.
