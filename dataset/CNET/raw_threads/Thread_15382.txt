We were able to put some files on the maxtor one evening. the next morning i tried to continue backing up( on my own ) and i remember getting an i/o error. So i stopped what i was doing since this external hdd didnt belong to me nor am I smart enough to figure this stuff out on my own. I have read thru all the discussions and different problems with these hdds. my computer shows drive g as being available, but when i scroll over it it doesnt show how much space is is on this hdd. i try to open it and my computer freezes. after several minutes it may say drive is not formatted would u like to formatt. Now my friend did say the drive must just have been deleted and to goahead and reformat. i dont want to do that unless i know for sure his info is really lost. i downloaded PC Inspector file recovery. this program is showing my maxtor hdd as a physical drive but not a logical one. i guess what i need is just a starting point. im willing to do trial and error i just need a little guidance from anyone willing! please let me know if i left out any pertinent info
