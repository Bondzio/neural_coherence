Remember that the mobo is a four layer printed circuit board and the caps may be connected to an inner circuit layer.
So make certain that you have the tools and techniques to handle the job without damaging the surrounding artwork.
Also since the Caps were probably bought in a large batch, what's to say that more won't go bad soon.
Note that after a class action suit, ABIT has just agreed to replace the bad caps on any of their mobos regardless of age.
Try complaining to Soyo.
