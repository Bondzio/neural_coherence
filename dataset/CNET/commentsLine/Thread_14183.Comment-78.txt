i started using pc's in the seventies.
in fact my first pc was not really what most people called a pc, it was an ibm system 34. i worked during the holiday at ibm in amsterdam and i was given this system play with.
i remember the first little program i wrote in basic really excited me.
we then moved on to a version of pascal.
towards the end of the seventies i was given an early version of an apple to work with in another job and bought my first pc, a ti99 (texas instruments).
it was a great machine, but you could not really program to much yourself, so i replaced it with a bbc computer manufactured by acorn.
this was truly a pc and i have kept it until today.
its (at the time massive) memory of 64kb was a breakthrough.
i don't really know what microsoft and intel have done to computers, but this old beasty still beats a pentium 4 with word in the area of processing.
the wordprocessor loads instantly and there is no delays.
everything may have become prettier, but i am not always convinced it got better.
obviously you can't process video on these old 6502 processors, but these old machines were good.
