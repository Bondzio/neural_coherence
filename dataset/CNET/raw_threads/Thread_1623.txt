Radio Shack and Newegg.com do not have a compatible charger available. it is true that there are no accessories available through Acer or another vendor that are made for this product. acer has stopped all production support for this tablet. It was outdated the moment I bought it which is when it first came out. the software for this tablet almost never works and simple things like checking your email causes the tablet to freeze and close constantly. I rarely go more than a few seconds on the tablet before it freezes and asks if I want to send error report. which I almost always do but nothing good has come of it. also, even though it runs the same Android software as other tablets and phones, it is not compatible with almost any web sites or flash players as well as many widgets and apps on the android market. It has been a large disappointment, especially since I did a lot of research before I bought it as well as looked at product reviews and went into retail stores to look at it myself. all of its features and design made it stand out and it seemed to be a great choice. But there has been no support from Acer and it has been dropped from all retailers so it pretty much became useless within a few months. if anyone has any advice or ideas please respond, thank you very much

I could not get around the horrible battery life. For all the cool things it does, no battery life - and such a horrible, bulky charger (and no car option) - I just realized I wasn't really using the unit. I've ordered a Google Nexus 7: lower price point, updated Android, and a battery that performs a whole lot better. &quot; I have the newer Nexus and it's a nice tablet. Even better now that I added a combo cover and keyboard but it's not a laptop or PC. I see a lot of folk expecting more than what it is. Some can't accept these devices are not going to be around for years. After having many of them around the office, I figure 2 years use then replacement. The iPad seems to push that a little further.
