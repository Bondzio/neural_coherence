out of curiosity, i went back to the d-link site and brought up the 108g documentation.
under the faq, an answer to &quot;enabling the super g mode&quot; also stated that only channel 6 can be used.
i obviously missed this when i originally checked out the site.
amazing that tech support did not know this.
as a result i returned a functioning router and d-link lost a sale.
fwiw, i was trying this router because of a perceived issue with a belkin wireless g router with which i was intermittently losing the internet connection from my motorola sb4200 cable modem ( i have posted about this on this group a few weeks ago).
after returning the d-link, i went out and purchased (with the right to return) an rca cable modem since the sb4200 was also a suspect (comcast would not allow me to have a new modem since it &quot;worked o.k.&quot; directly connected).
anyway, it now appears that the sb4200 was the problem.
it's been almost 4.5 days and i've not had a disconnect (4-6 times daily with the sb4200).
furthermore, my upload speeds have increased by about 20%.
i'm tempted to try the d-link again except for their poor tech support and the very good support i received from belkin (sent me out a brand new, field tested router - also very easy to get to their tech support people).
