sorry lol.
I have kind of fixed the issue..but not totally: I had 3 friends send me files, but only 1/3 could actually get the file to go through over AIM (trillian).
the one who could send me the file is on a mac, the other two on PCs.
does this change anything or do you still suggest swapping it?
