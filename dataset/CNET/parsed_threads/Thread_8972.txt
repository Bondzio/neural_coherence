<s> I am unable to access my apartment secured wi-fi network on my XP Windows notebook. </s>
<s> When I click &quot;View available wireless connections,&quot; other psk networks in the neighborhood pop up, but mine does not. </s>
<s> This is a computer issue, as my roommate's laptop recognizes the network. </s>
<s> I have added the network as a &quot;preferred network&quot; by going to &quot;Wireless Network Connection Properties&quot; and inputting the name, WPA-PSK, AES, and the password. </s>
<s> However, the laptop still won't recognize the network. </s>
<s> What do you recommend? </s>
<s> Turns out the router was set to EU channels and the laptop was set to NA channels. </s>
<s> The router was never found because of this. </s>
