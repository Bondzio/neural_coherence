<s> For some reason when my husband got onto his desktop this morning his keyboard is not typing anything. </s>
<s> If we test it in notepad typing any keys just seem to tab without words. </s>
<s> There are small windows that will popup also when trying to type. </s>
<s> This is a brand new PC and it says there is no conflicts showing. </s>
<s> And also you know how when you bring up new things they usually show up in the bottom task area. </s>
<s> His has now switched to the upper area on his screen. </s>
<s> I hope all this makes sense and I am sure this has a very simple solution. </s>
<s> So I will thank everyone for your time and understanding. </s>

<s> A new PC that's not working properly is a warranty issue. </s>
<s> If you end up taking it in and tell their folks you tried all sorts of stuff suggested by Cnet users, you risk your chance of getting a free repair job. </s>
<s> If you can't fix it by just taking apart and reinstalling the same parts you did when you unboxed it, something is probably broken. </s>
<s> Attempts at self repair carry risks as well as rewards. </s>
<s> Don't risk your warranty. </s>
