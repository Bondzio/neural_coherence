I got a used desktop, and have a number of upgrades I would like to make to it.
But first I have to get it running.
When you push the power button, the power button comes on but the hard drives are not spinning and the display does not change, not even to show the BIOS.
I think this may be either the motherboard or the graphics card.
Does anybody know which?
