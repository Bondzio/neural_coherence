i have a 2000 installation running with a ibm tft monitor and a 4500 3dfx.
finding drivers for the 2000 installation was difficult as the card is out of support.
i have wxp drivers built into the win xp installation.
but not the 2000 installation.
i found some third party drivers that worked fairly well.
