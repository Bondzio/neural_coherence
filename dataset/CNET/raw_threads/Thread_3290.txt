Hello, I just bought a belkin wireless router with adsl modem and a usb network adaptor. I have set up the router but for some reason i can only pick up a very weak signal...even though the router is around 15 metres from the computer (router has a range of 1500ft) could it be the usb network adaptor to blame? would an internal pci card pick up the signal better? also the router is near a cordless phone but the phone operates at 1.9ghz and the router at 2.4ghz so this should not be much of a problem should it? Please help.

Don't know if that's the problem, but it would be the first thing I replaced with an internal NIC. Besides, who needs one more &quot;something&quot; to plug into the PC when it could go inside?

The addage is &quot;any code devised by... can be cracked by...&quot; As to the phone, I didn't respond to that issue. There was not enough info for me to comment. In short, if it's a 2.4GHz phone, I'd move the router closer to the client machines. Bob
