1.1.8	-- I already own one .	St
1.1.9	( Are you enjoying it ? )	Ques
1.2.1	I broke down and bought an iPad 2 and must say it is much easier to use in bed than a laptop or netbook , both of which get hot fast .	St
1.2.2	I found a really nice app that lets me set a timer to go to sleep go my own playlist .	St
1.2.3	I also enjoy the Netflix app .	St
1.2.4	If some other show preempts re-runs of & quot ; The Office , & quot ; I can watch them or other tv shows on my iPad .	St
1.2.5	I also have an alarm clock app that has come in handy when the electricity goes out .	St
1.2.6	I still use a laptop during the day when I am home , but my iPad 2 is my new best bedtime and traveling buddy !	St
1.3.1	& lt ; span style= & quot ; color : rgb ( 66 , 66 , 68 ) ; font-family : Helvetica , Arial , sans-serif ; font-size : 12px ; & quot ; & gt ; I already have an iPad 2 , and really love it .	St
1.3.2	There 's nothing I ca n't do on it , I can create documents with iWork , diagrams with Omnigraffle , manage my data with FileMaker , entertain my self with Netflix and all the great games , and so much more .	St
1.3.3	I have been tempted to get an Android tablet lately , mainly because I would like to learn more about the development environment , and also because they come in smaller sizes .	St
1.3.4	If I end up getting one , I 'm going to wait for the Sony Tablet P - mainly because the compact design looks cool and I really need mobile broadband on a tablet for on the go .	St
1.4.1	I bought an Acer Iconia A500 about a month ago and love it .	St
1.4.2	Rick Broida had a post that Staples was offering a $ 100 off coupon on any tablet and he specifically mentioned the Acer Iconia had been reduced from $ 449 to $ 399 .	St
1.4.3	Went to Staples and purchased the Iconia for $ 299 .	St
1.4.4	Took it home , charged it , turned it on and it immediately offered a free upgrade to 3.2 from Android 3.1 .	St
1.4.5	Response time is excellent on my wi-fi and in general love its speed , sound and vivid screen .	St
1.4.6	It is a great supplement to my pc and I hardly use my laptop anymore .	St
1.4.7	The only shortcoming in my opinion is that when I move away from a network I do not have GPS coverage .	St
1.4.8	( Just a note that I am a 76 year old retired semi-techie -yes we do exist . )	St
1.5.1	I 'm not because : 1-I have an HTC android phone ( with a 32 Gb .	St
1.5.2	micro SD card ) that does all the same as the tables ( only with a little smaller screen ) , email , casual web surf , logmein , social networking , HD 720 P video , 8 Mp .	St
1.5.3	photos , music , Pandora , Skype , GPS , etc .	St
1.5.4	( i pay it $ 20.00 with a 2 year ATT plan ) 2-For other mobility advanced task ( that tablets or phones CA N'T do ) I have a very comfortable dual core 6 Gb.ram 500 Gb Hard drive laptop .	St
1.5.5	( $ 450 HP Pro book ) 3-For heavy work I have a 6 core 8 Gb 1,5 Tb , blue ray , 22 ' monitor etc ... desktop PC .	St
1.5.6	( Clone PC around $ 1000.00 , including windows 7 ultimate , build by me ) And I do n't like to carry out a ( BIG ) thing all the time like a tablet , because it does n't replace the phone , and does almost the same..	St
1.5.7	So have in mind your needs before spend $ 200 to $ 600 in a tablet .	St
1.6.1	A tablet is a nice-to-have , not a need-to-have , at least for me ; but I have to admit that when I saw the iPad , my first thought was , & quot ; I want one of those ! & quot ; .	St
1.6.2	For now , though , I 'll wait .	St
1.6.3	And it will most likely be either an iPad ( 3 , I hope ) or a Samsung Galaxy Tab , which might be a better companion for the Android phone I 'm also planning to buy .	St
1.6.4	I guess that 's going to take quite a few pennies .	St
1.6.5	So why am I already scoping out accessories for the durn thing ?	Ques
1.7.1	Right now , the novelty of tablets are driving the price .	St
1.7.2	I know that there are better processors coming down the pike and would rather wait .	St
1.7.3	I will pay five hundred dollars for a quad-core tablet ; not a dual-core 1ghz .	St
1.7.4	I would rather buy a laptop than put up with that kind of performance .	St
1.7.5	Then , I want my tablet dual booted with windows 8 and android 4 .	St
1.7.6	Peace TeraNeter	St
1.8.1	I find no need to run out and buy the latest whiz-bang which will be obsolete by the end of the year due to some new whiz-bang .	St
1.8.2	Do n't need a tablet , smart phone , nor any of the other gizmos on the market .	St
1.8.3	Have my desktop , my laptop , my Roku .	St
1.8.4	That 's enough , thank you .	Polite
1.9.1	I bought a 64G iPad in May from a big chain pretty much on a whim ( got drawn in with a $ 399 price tag ) and 3 months later I rarely use it .	St
1.9.2	I find it fits in between my other devices so it does n't play a roll in my tech needs , my 15 & quot ; MBP is still my staple machine with my iPods and iPhone 4 handling the portable side of things .	St
1.9.3	The MBP sits on my lap freeing up my hands too do other stuff , it balances well and does n't require adjustments if I shift around in the chair , and has a full keyboard attached vs the screen keyboard in the iPad ( not friendly too type on ) One thing I find is that I play way more games on the iPad which I have n't done in 15 years and watching video for it 's size is handy .	St
1.9.4	Oh and no flash ... that sucks !	St
1.9.5	I guess the way I would sum it up for tablets is they are the sport utility of the computer world ... ... can do a little bit of everything but do n't do anything perfectly .	St
1.9.6	& lt ; div & gt ; I just recently got a Samsung Galaxy S2 for my daily phone and I must say that I love how much freedom I have with the Android OS too manipulate how it runs , so if and when I replace the iPad I will switch too an Android. & lt ; div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.10.1	Yes but not sure which will be the best deal and fit what I want to do the best..which is a Ereader light internet browsing a few games and such looking at the HP Touchpad , Nook Color Refurb , Lenovo thats coming out and the near future Amazon offering thats supposedly coming out to challenge the Nook Color .	St
1.11.1	Me , buy a tablet ?	Ques
1.11.2	Yeah right .	Res
1.11.3	I 'd sooner spend the $ 500+ on a new TV ( and I do n't have any plans to do that either ) than waste the money on a low-powered , limited-use device that 's worthless for business/student usage , incompatible with many websites , and requires you to pay to download so-called & quot ; apps & quot ; .	St
1.11.4	A netbook ( or even a low-end & quot ; budget & quot ; laptop ) can do everything a tablet can do plus more , for less than half the cost .	St
1.11.5	Oh , and the laptop wo n't become obsolete overnight just because a new model is released .	St
1.11.6	I am convinced that the only reason these tablets are still being sold is because people are too easily swayed by Apple 's marketing campaign and feel they & quot ; need & quot ; a tablet when really it 's just an overpriced status symbol .	St
1.11.7	I suspect that in a couple years , when the novelty wears off , you will see people dumping their iPads on Craigslist for $ 150 to $ 200 , just as you now see people dumping their netbooks for $ 100 to $ 200 .	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	I am thinking about getting a tablet but the keyboard and typing on it is holding me back .	St
1.13.2	It seems like it would be like a smartphone just typing by pecking versus typing on a keyboard like a laptop .	St
1.13.3	So in that thought I am sticking with my laptop for now .	St
1.13.4	A tablet just seems like a novelty item to me at present .	St
1.13.5	So after thinking about it for now my laptop seems more functional actually .	St
1.13.6	Price is also too high in my opinion for a tablet .	St
1.13.7	The price HP just had for a $ 149 seems more like the right price for a tablet since it is not really that functional from what I have read versus a laptop .	St
1.13.8	$ 500- $ 600 for tablets is just way too expensive or so I feel .	St
1.13.9	I am still reading input on tablets and would like to hear more Cnet users on this subject as well as how others feel on the prices for tablets .	St
1.13.10	Thank you .	St
1.13.11	jik47	St
1.14.1	I have a Nook Color ( $ 250 ) with the Nook2Android dual boot 16GB microsdhc card ( $ 50 ) .	St
1.14.2	If I find a honeycomb or later tablet that is as compelling a value , I 'll consider getting one .	St
1.14.3	The Lenovo A1 and the Amazon tablet ( neither available in the US , yet ) are on my short list .	St
1.14.4	Bob	St
1.15.1	I got a Flytouch 3 which worked , at the third attempt ! !	St
1.15.2	On the fisrt one not much seemed to work , so I sent it back for a refund .	St
1.15.3	The second one had a DOA PSU , so that went back as well .	St
1.15.4	The third one works OK , but android 2.2 is obviously a mobile phone OS .	St
1.15.5	Not a lot of good for a tablet , IMHO !	St
1.15.6	I want a tablet that runs Windows 7 and then 8 , so it looks like my PC and laptop , and RDC and Logmein work 'out of the box ' , so I can log on to my network via the tablet where ever I am .	St
1.15.7	They are available , but much too pricey at present !	St
1.15.8	I know I can do it all with Android , but it is a real pain !	St
1.15.9	!	St
1.16.1	Best investment I ever made .	St
1.16.2	I am such a fan , I could be a spokesperson .	St
1.16.3	It 's so much faster to boot than either my desktop or laptop , I can instantly check on current weather ( severe or radar ) , check my email on all 3 accounts , read a book that feels just like a Kindle , play games ( not interactive , I do n't do that ) , follow recipes , learn a foreign language , etc .	St
1.16.4	I was apprehensive as I 'd never dealt with Apple before , but after researching for over a year , when ipad2 came out , I jumped in .	St
1.16.5	I have the 16 gig , and have n't come up with any limitations versus the bigger ones .	St
1.16.6	I only have wifi , not 4g .	St
1.16.7	The app store is awesome , and I 've only so far looked at the free apps .	St
1.16.8	I retired from IT , and have been a Dell snob until their products became unreliable , and now own a power HP desktop and high-end laptop , and now after buying my ipad2 I went out and bought an ipod touch as well .	St
1.16.9	Maybe I 'm just bored with retirement , I do n't know .	St
1.16.10	But these two products that I bought mainly for toys , have been nothing but joys .	St
1.16.11	I do n't miss Flash , most web sites are smart enough to realize Apple users are customers also .	Ques
1.16.12	I do not do productivity apps on my ipad2 , I use the big boys for that .	St
1.16.13	But for most of my daily agenda , I wo n't be without one of these in the future .	St
1.17.1	I 'm at & quot ; maybe & quot ; until I can convince myself I need one .	St
1.17.2	For now , it is a technology in need of a use .	St
1.18.1	Do n't need one .	St
1.19.1	No !	St
1.19.2	Just looks like another fad that will attract the usual herd of young people ; must haves .	St
1.19.3	If you feel that you must subsidise China then go ahead , more nails in the Western non-indstrial coffin .	St
1.19.4	LOL	St
1.20.1	I just sold my galaxy tab p1000 as I am looking forward to the release of the HTC Puccini in a couple of weeks to a month.I do n't think that good reviews are on its side but I guess someone has to buy it and luckily , i would be one of them.I really enjoyed the p1000 though I grew out of its interface and everything seemed to be just a routine .	St
1.20.2	I have used a wildfire s before and I was pretty satisfied with the sense so I would not see the liking disappear with Puccini .	St
1.21.1	I refuse to buy another Apple product , so I am waiting to see what kind of table Amazon releases .	St
1.22.1	not up to my expectations , not as useful as a smart phone or actually a computer merely a toy .	St
1.23.1	I have a 3G Kindle for reading and minor surfing .	St
1.23.2	I need to find another compelling reason other than surfing in color to buy a tablet .	St
1.23.3	I already have a desktop , laptop and a phone with Internet and GPS that fills all my needs for computing power .	St
1.23.4	What other reason would I need to buy a tablet ?	Ques
1.24.1	My choice is iPad2 .	St
1.24.2	I read many reviews and I found that people 's choice is iPad 2 .	St
1.24.3	It has got lots of feature but a little costly .	St
1.25.1	We already own one ( Actually , three .	St
1.25.2	We like gadgets . )	St
1.25.3	Yes , we enjoy each of them very much .	St
1.25.4	Each one is from a different manufactuer , and uses a different OS .	St
1.25.5	They all have their pros and cons .	St
1.25.6	We look forward to what will be coming in 2012 .	St
1.26.1	HP Touchpad at $ 99 ?	Ques
1.26.2	Why not !	St
1.26.3	Pretty slick , actually !	St
1.26.4	Flash , apps for FB , pretty functional browser , nice response when overclocked and cleaned up !	St
1.27.1	I do n't think of it as a real computer , and I would n't spend more than $ 200 on one .	St
1.28.1	I really am waiting for this : http : //www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html .	St
1.28.2	This technology on an affordable and for the masses computer is what I want .	St
1.29.1	Few month ago I bought Acer Iconia Tab W501 , and I do n't care about it 's performances because I use it when I decide to travel .	St
1.29.2	Music , photos and films are everything I want to use it for .	St
1.29.3	For games I use my PC .	St
1.29.4	So if you want to find a good tablet follow my example , read reviews first .	St
