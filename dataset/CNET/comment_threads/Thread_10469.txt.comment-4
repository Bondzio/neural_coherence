reports did a report a couple months ago on computer reliability and the short version is that you are buying performance (you get what you pay for) not reliability.
For the money, for basic desk top computer needs, Acers are as good if not better then an emachine or a compac, again in the price point/performance.
If you want something that's more up-gradable, has more under the hood, check out Gateway, hp and dell.
Personally speaking, I find gateway a very good bang for buck at your local big box store.
