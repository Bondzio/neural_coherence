<s> I'm trying to get a USB mouse to work with a PS/2 to USB adapter, since my USB ports all fail to work, but it wont stay on. </s>
<s> My PS/2 mouse is dead so I've bought a cheap PS/2 to USB adapter off of Amazon and plugged my USB mouse into it. </s>
<s> Upon system boot, the mouse will turn on and then turn off after about two seconds. </s>
<s> There's nothing I can do to turn it back on and it's being to get me annoyed. </s>
<s> I know the mouse works fine since I just tried it on a netbook and it worked upon plug in. </s>
<s> Does anyone have advice to offer? </s>
<s> Not all USB mice can use such adapters. </s>
<s> The mouse has to have the circuits to support PS2 as the adapter you noted rarely has more than wires. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think they go for under $5 </s>
<s> I just got one from Amazon to end this whole ordeal. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I've hit another problem. </s>
<s> The PS/2 mouse is now unresponsive when playing games. </s>
<s> I was just in TF2 when the mouse wheel would act on it's own and then the entire mouse will not respond for thirty seconds after. </s>
<s> Not to mention how it will randomly stop responding mid turn in other games. </s>
<s> It's a iMicro MO-5013P PS/2 mouse. </s>
<s> I was thinking of a driver update, but the iMicro site provides none. </s>
<s> Should I try the Basic Optical Mouse drivers from Microsoft? </s>
