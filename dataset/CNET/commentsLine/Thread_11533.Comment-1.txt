hi.
i am experiencing a very scary problem with my main hard drive, a maxtor fireball 3 40gb that i bought 3 years ago.
here is what is happening.
whenever i open a file in my local drive, the disk space would decrease from its actual level (4.36 gb) to 0 gb and then it would go back to display 4.36 gb.
this happens whenever i try to open a file in the drive.
during this time, my cpu usage is around 30% instead of the usal 20%.
is this a hardware problem or a software problem (i.e.
virus)?
thank you.
i would appreciate any help.
