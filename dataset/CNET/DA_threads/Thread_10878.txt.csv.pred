1.1.1	Hello all , I am using an Intel D875PZB board and have used the & quot ; Intel Active Monitor & quot ; to monitor the temps and voltages on my board since it was new .	St
1.1.2	I also used the & quot ; Intel Desktop Control Center & quot ; to modify fan settings and tweak other settings in my BIOS .	St
1.1.3	Both are really good programs but I have lost the use of them .	St
1.1.4	I was experimenting with a program called & quot ; Motherboard Monitor & quot ; and since installing that , I can not get the Intel programs to work any more .	St
1.1.5	I tried UNinstalling the & quot ; Motherboard Monitor & quot ; and REinstalling the & quot ; Intel Active Monitor & quot ; but I get the message that says & quot ; No Sensors Detected On This Board & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	The sensors are there and functioning because I can REinstall & quot ; Motherboard Monitor & quot ; and get readings from that but I do n't like that program because some of my voltage readings are incorrect and I would rather use the & quot ; Intel & quot ; programs anyway .	St
1.1.7	I would like to know if anyone is aware of the changes that & quot ; Motherboard Monitor & quot ; might have made that cause the & quot ; Intel & quot ; programs to fail .	St
1.1.8	I am hoping that I can reset things back so I can use the & quot ; Intel Desktop Control Center & quot ; most of all .	St
1.1.9	I tried a System Restore but the Intel programs still do n't function and fail when I try to REinstall them .	St
1.1.10	Any help would be greatly appreciated , thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I should have included that I am running WinXP Pro/IE6.0 with SP1 and all updates for SP1 .	St
1.2.2	I ca n't think of anything else that may be pertinent to this situation at the moment but if I missed something , just ask ... thanks	St
1.3.1	you could always try good 'ol system restore to when you first installed the intel utility	Sug
1.4.1	NIL	St
