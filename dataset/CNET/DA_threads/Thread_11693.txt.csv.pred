1.2.1	Robert, I would think that &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; is very much a key factor here for the consumer.	St

1.3.1	With having a bridge to run 32-bit code, this is a chip to watch.	St
1.3.2	As to expensive, the cost for the OS is the same when that day comes and as to other applications, we'll see.	St
1.3.3	Already, Open Office has started to dislodge that other office.	St

1.5.3	I already see the price plummeting over the past month and XP-64 may not be what we'll be installing for these workstations.	St
1.5.4	In the case of the next setups, it's Open Office and some development work in C++.	St
1.5.5	Since it will run Windows 2000, we can do that with a dual boot to some Linux-64.	St
