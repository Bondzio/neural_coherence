after checking out everything here at cnet and at a site tomeshardware.com i figured out that the amd x2 either the 4200 or the 3800 will more than do what i want it to do.
now i have to decide between the hp or gateway variations.
not this computer but the next i will probably build it.
all tests i saw had the amd x2's dominating the intel d's.
