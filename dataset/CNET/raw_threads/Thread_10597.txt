Has anyone had success with doing this? All I get is a solid yellow light and the Maxtor software will not find it on the network. I've tried resetting the drive and that doesn't work either. I've also tried formatting the with NTFS and with no partitioning at all and still no go. Suggestions?

Also try updating the flash software. If not, the unit is dead. Bob

2368	4	200832	2155204	2154908	hercules29	8/24/06 10:03 AM	1.15641378E12	webserver	Well, when you run the maxtor setup program and it searches the network for the drive, it never finds it. And this is just a simple home network with a linksys router/switch and DHCP enabled. I'm assuming it has to be formatted in some fashion for the box to recognize the drive...maybe fat32?

I've replaced the drives on a lot of the maxtor external drives and never had a problem before. Just this time on the shared storage drive. The only thing I can guess is that the internal OS needs the drive in a specific format before it will recognize it.

Or even to create the new drive in the same partition type and format. I wonder if you duplicated the jumper settings? In closing, some of these boxes have strict limits on hard disk sizes such as 127GB limits or others. The makers rarely reveal exactly what these are but we can take clues if they never offered over 127GB. Bob

I then mounted it. And so far I have tried everything to fix it with no luck. It just will not take again. Maxtor said it had to be an EXT3 partition so I put it into Linux and formatted it back. Then placed it into the drive and still it will not recognize the drive even after a reset. Can someone help I know I must be able to get it back to life. I tried this http://www.idevelopment.info/data/Unix/Linux/LINUX_PartitioningandFormattingSecondHardDrive_ext3.shtml

From there the drive nolonger want to boot. The drive pass all diagnosis test, and spins up ok. I now trying to find a way that I can plug this drive into a OS that will recognize the data on it.

2368	14	200832	2672691	2665306	blindsight	1/7/08 7:52 AM	1.19969232E12	Hope this helps a bit.	The drive uses the REISERFS format. It's a linux based filesystem and please, under no circumstances, try to use it under a Windows environment (as in hooking the drive directly to the IDE connector). Windows will attempt the read and after failing ~255 times, for reasons unknown, it does something to the first couple of sectors of the drive that renders it unreadable once you replace the drive in it's housing. You must use a *nix based system to reformat the drive, and then reinstall the drive. Hope this helps a little.

Closes I can get is an error of permission accesses denied. Linux States you do not have enough permission to read file :///dev/disk/by-id/ata-Maxtor_6B300R0_B61ZDSBH Unsure how to bypass this
