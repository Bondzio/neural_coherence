<s> Hi - I just got a Seagate FreeAgent Go 120 GB External Hard Drive. </s>
<s> Even after plugging in both (yes both) USB cables into my Mac Mini, the disk will spin and the light turn on, but it does not appear on my desktop. </s>
<s> I have found out that I need to format the hard drive using disk utility, but the drive does not appear on the desktop or on disk utility. </s>
<s> Here are my specs (as many as I can think of - I've only had a Mac a week now): Mac Mini Intel Core 2 Duo 1.83 GHz OSX.4.10 80 GB Internal HD 120 GB Seagate External Free Agent Go HD Any ideas? </s>

<s> I go through all the diagnostics, but they all assume the drive shows up in the disk utility (it doesn't). </s>
<s> There is one trouble shooting section on what to do if it doesn't show up in the disk utility: go to system profiler and check to see if the machine sees it plugged in. </s>
<s> I go to the system profiler in the USB section and the drive doesn't show up there, either. </s>
<s> The lights are on and blinking (at least for a while). </s>
<s> Just plugging in one of the USB's results in beeping, which is normal, I've been told. </s>
<s> I'm taking it back and trying another brand. </s>
<s> This is ridiculous. </s>
<s> I have been looking at all the pictures that I can find of this device and I can only see one USB port on the thing. </s>
<s> This is on the RH side as you look at the curved front. </s>
<s> Is this the device that you have? </s>
<s> I guess my point is that I have never seen a USB HD that requires the use of two USB cables. </s>
<s> I would start over by removing all the cables from the device and just connecting one USB cable to the Mini. </s>
<s> Unless the drive is faulty, you should see one of two things: 1. </s>
<s> An error dialog saying that the disk is unreadable and needs to be initialized or 2. </s>
<s> The disk mounts on the desktop P </s>
<s> From Amazon's page selling this http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FreeAgent-External-Drive-ST901603FGA1E1-RK/dp/B000ND75CU When I first thought of buying an external hdd I was worried to buy one without external powersupply. </s>
<s> But this one is cool. </s>
<s> It works like magic. </s>
<s> 5400 rpm hdd but it will take up two of your USB slots. </s>
<s> I think it uses two to gather power. </s>
<s> I guess the drive was faulty. </s>
<s> I didn't see a box or a mounted drive. </s>
<s> ... come with a single USB plug that attaches to your drive, and 2 USB plugs that attach to your computer. </s>
<s> This is to allow for the fact that some computers don't pump enough volts out of a single USB port to power up your &quot;USB powered&quot; drive. </s>
<s> I understand why there are two cables, but I included that so you could understand it. </s>
<s> You said you'd never seen 2 USB cables on one device, so I thought I'd educate you. </s>
<s> Incidentally, I figured out the problem . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> My Mac Mini has 4 USB ports. </s>
<s> Usually they are setup this way: 1. wireless keyboard/mouse receiver 2. printer 3. speaker power (my cheap speakers get their power from the USB drive and their data from the normal speaker wire) 4. </s>
<s> USB extension (for camera cards, Palm Pilots, flash drives, etc) When I was trying to set this up, I had unplugged the extension cord and the speaker usb cable, leaving the speaker cable plugged in. </s>
<s> I plugged both the USBs into the back of the mac mini. </s>
<s> Nothing appeared on screen. </s>
<s> When I unplugged the speaker cable, everything worked fine. </s>
<s> Weird! </s>
<s> Thanks for your help, Matt </s>
<s> a two USB cable driven HD. </s>
<s> I guess if you have enough ports then there is no problem. </s>
<s> How difficult would it have been to give it an option brick for regular home use. </s>
<s> Not all computers have the necessary power to run everything that can be plugged into them. </s>
<s> There is only a finite amount of power on each USB bus. </s>
<s> Anyway, glad you back in business. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Hey I dont if this will work or not, but I have a power book g4. </s>
<s> I bought a Seagate 320gb hard drive a week ago and just hooked it up to my mac. </s>
<s> Now at first it seemed like it wasnt recognized through disk utility and all, BUT if you plug in your hard drive using the dock, a mesesage will appear on screen saying &quot; you have inserted a disk containing no volumes that mac os x can read. </s>
<s> To use the unreadable volumes, click initialize. </s>
<s> To continue with the disk inserted, click ignore&quot;. </s>
<s> Now at this point you need to click on initialize. </s>
<s> It will pull up the disk utility box and you will now see your external drive. </s>
<s> Just click on it and click the erase tab choose what you want and erase. </s>
<s> Your done, I hope this helped and it works. </s>
<s> Robert </s>
<s> hey... i am having this same problem. </s>
<s> i see you say 'but if you plug in your hard drive using the dock...' How do you plug in your hard drive using the dock? </s>
