for those who don't own one of these - this is the quietest box i've ever owned or built (i didn't build this one).
the form factor (server) is not ideal for home theater, but i wish i could build a system with this kind of quality and quiet and cool.
everyone is into this power thing like it's horsepower - if you're not putting a high end video card in your box (i have a separate ati low end), i don't think power is a problem.
check out  for processor power requirements and heat.
it's a compliation of specs, i assume it is accurate.
i've got a celeron 2.26 - it has a max core amperage of 73a and a max cover temp of 67c.
i am going to make the assumption that dell designed the 400sc shroud/fan for the 67c max temp.
the p4 3.0 prescott 478 has a max core temp of 69c, the 3.2 and 3.4 have a max of 73.2c.
the max core amperage of the 3.0 is 78a.
the 3.0 might run with the stock cooling (shroud + fan), but it will run hotter.
you can't overclock this motherboard and you probably won't come close to the max core amperage (very often).
the problem is if does run hot you need to add a fan, you have to remove the shroud and i if sound is a big deal, it will probably be louder than the quiet guy is it.
good luck, i need to do the same thing soon, while there are still 478's to be had.
