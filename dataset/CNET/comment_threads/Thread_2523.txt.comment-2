Boot to the SeaTools disk to test for damage on the 40GB Seagate drive.
In the meantime, I'd use the Dell Windows XP Restoration disc to install Windows on the 120GB HD.
The Windows XP installation CD will install all the necessary files to the MBR.
Make sure you install all drivers after installing Windows (download the latest versions from Dell.com).
