<s> Hi, On my desktop I have Realtek Ethernet card. </s>
<s> Recently OS was reinstalled and diskette which had come with card was not readable. </s>
<s> So driver was installed from download search. </s>
<s> It worked initially, ping was successful, I was able to surf net continuously. </s>
<s> Now after a week what happens till I do not dial to connect through DSL ping is successful. </s>
<s> But as soon as I connect to net just after opening few web pages hardly in 3 to 5 minutes ping command starts failing and I receive message &quot;Request timed out&quot;. </s>
<s> After reboot same symptom re-appears i.e. </s>
<s> initially successful ping and then &quot;Request timed out&quot; once I start surfing. </s>
<s> What can be wrong ? </s>
<s> [A] OS ? </s>
<s> Ethernet Card ? </s>
<s> [C] Any other/software conflict ? </s>
<s> And how to resolve this ? </s>
<s> Thx in advance. </s>

<s> Why didn't you replace the card? </s>
<s> These are much cheaper than any tech support call. </s>
<s> Actually the same card was functioning properly till reinstalling OS. </s>
<s> So I doubt if card is malfunctioning. </s>
<s> That's why I asked what tests I should do to verify what is wrong in set up. </s>
<s> Thx. </s>

<s> Remember that any tech support or shop call will cost more than this card. </s>
<s> To test such I boot my Linux CD. </s>
<s> As to why it might not work when you installed Windows the most common issue is a forgotten driver. </s>
<s> Most common forgot? </s>
<s> Motherboard driver package. </s>
<s> I can't count the times the poor(er?) </s>
<s> owner keep looking for the ethernet card drivers but had those already. </s>
