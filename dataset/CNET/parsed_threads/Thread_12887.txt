<s> have an Acer Aspire One Netbook computer, which, as travelling professional consultant and seminar teacher is excellent for my work. </s>
<s> Thank you for this nice product. </s>
<s> I also have, for use with this computer, an external CD-ROM drive Model ESW860, which also works really fine. </s>
<s> However, I also have a great deal of archived teaching and consultancy material, which is quite valuable to me. </s>
<s> This is stored on the old-type 3.5&quot; floppy disks. </s>
<s> Do you have, please, or do you know where I may obtain, an external drive, compatible with my Acer Aspire, which would enable me to retrieve, use and store the material on these drives. </s>
<s> I do still have an old desktop clunker computer, with a 3.5 inch built-in drive - but the thought of trying to use this is not very appealing and may not work well, anyway. </s>
<s> I like my Acer Aspire a lot. </s>
<s> It has proved to be a real work-horse for my professional work. </s>
<s> I would love to be able to give it even more work to do, in my teaching and training domain. </s>
<s> Much of the material comes from overseas, in developing and emerging economy countries, where I customarily work. </s>
<s> it is irreplaceable and thus quite valuable to me. </s>
<s> I am looking for something inexpensive but efficient (are not we all?). </s>
<s> I am 75 years old, semi-retired, working on a budget and have just become a great-grandfather for the first time. </s>
<s> Delightful, of course, but yet another mouth to feed, so to speak, which is why I still work. </s>
<s> I can be reached, should you be so kind, at &lt;dcjones2@cox.net&gt; </s>
<s> And my USB FLOPPY DRIVES plug and work fine. </s>
<s> But given you could use some USB memory stick to copy the floppy to on the old machine, why not do that. </s>
<s> Even some SD CARD will do fine. </s>
