From a 2.4GHz interfering signal like a cordless phone to an AP that has a firmware bug that no one attended to.
Here's a widely known one.
We see a lot of complaints now of drops when P2P software is used.
Here's a link about why that can cause router/AP issues.
&quot;The default firmware for Linksys (and all replacement firmwares except for the latest DD-WRT and HyperWRT Thibor) have a severe problem where they track old connections for FIVE days, which causes the router to hang when ...&quot; And this bug has been spotted in access points.
Since your system is not well designed or cared for I only can offer commiseration.
