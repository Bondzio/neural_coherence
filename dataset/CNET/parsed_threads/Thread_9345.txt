<s> Hello folks, I am looking into buying a media center desktop. </s>
<s> I have looked at some of the larger commercial companies as well as smaller ones like Velocity Micro. </s>
<s> I would like the following in my PC:&lt;div&gt;i7 processor Blu-Ray drive (dont need to write Blu-Ray, combo with DVD-R preferred) Decent 1-2 GB video card that supports HDMI Upmarket sound card (3 mm OK, RCA preferred) TV Tuner (not as familiar with these, but HDMI compatibility is a must) 1 TB HD or better Bluetooth compatibility on the wireless card My budget is between $1000-1500. </s>
<s> I am a bit overwhelmed by the options available these days not to mention the company websites are so-so at describing the options available on customization. </s>
<s> I primarily want to hook this PC up to my LCD tv and use it as a conduit for TV, music and streaming media. </s>
<s> Also, reliability of the product is important. </s>
<s> I was interested in VM initially but some of the reviews I had read were not so supportive. </s>
<s> I like the smaller brands due to the lack of BS software that comes pre-loaded with them. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the advice! </s>
<s> &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> Odd idea. </s>
<s> I wonder how folk know why this is overkill for 99.99% of us. </s>
<s> 2 GB would be at the extreme end and not necessary. </s>
<s> i also like to get a lot of years out of my desktops by getting lots of memory. </s>
<s> I have been using a desktop from 2004 until recently because I got it with, at the time, overkill ram and video. </s>
<s> I also do game from time to time, especially the Total War series with large unit numbers, which eats up memory. </s>
<s> Some are miffed over the state of affairs in TV cards. </s>
<s> For example, no more cable cards and cable companies moving to all digital encrypted content. </s>
<s> At least these cards are $$ and not $$$. </s>
<s> In your case, you lead off with a post that gives all the signs you should build it yourself. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think the custom built will be the best option. </s>
<s> Im going to leave out the TV card and go with a Slingbox if I want the TV through the cpu </s>
