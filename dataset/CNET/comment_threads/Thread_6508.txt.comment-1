Hi all.
I built my PC a few year or so ago, and I'm considering putting some more ram in.
I already have 2x2gb of 1600 DDR3 in my FoxConn X48 motherboard, buut I'm not sure if I should be worried about compatibility issues between the new sticks and the existing ones.
I've read mixed answers from &quot;Throw any type in, as long as it fits in your MoBo&quot; to &quot;If they have different timings your MoBo could get fried.&quot; So I figured I'd ask around.
