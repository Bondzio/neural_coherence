I downloaded the drivers, and everything works fine, but I do not have the manual. I tried to download the PDF file from Xerox's Website, but it locks up. My problem is Scanning. I'm using Windows 98 Imaging Program to scan with. The scanner (Twain) works great, but after I scan something the program closes and there is no image in the Imaging program. I can't print, or save anything! I mean where does it go, and what file name is it under? Xerox Tech. Support says it saves it to the hard drive, but where on my hard drive? Not in Xerox's Folder. Thanks.

The scanner works fine, I just can't do anything with the image after it's scanned. Most Scanner Programs I've used, let you save the scanned image as a BMP file or something. I can't do anything with Xerox's Twain Scanner Program. There is no save, or save as options, and right clicking doesn't bring up any new windows with options. The only thing I can do is look at the image, and exit out of the Twain program. I just can't figure it out! I'm going to try and download Xerox's Manual again. Please let me know if you come across anything, and thanks for your help! cadguy2 (Don)

Such is noted with each post. There could be a need to install motherboard drivers or other. You didn't tell how it was plugged in, any version software and more. Any clue would be helpful. Bob
