if you want a computer that will last, you really should build it yourself.
otherwise, you don't know what kind of low quality components might be in use.
some tips for you: 1. for longer working life and more tolerance to heat, buy motherboards with 100% solid capacitors.
(you can recognise them easily - they are squat, not tall).
2. buy ram from a well-known manufacturer, and run memtest 86+ overnight to make sure it's good.
3. buy a brand-name power supply.
if you buy a cheap and nasty one and it gives out on you, it can damage the motherboard.
this includes power supplies that come with no-name brand cases!
okay, so a solid capacitor motherboard will cost twice as much (or more) than one without.
brand-name ram will cost about 30% more, and a brand-name power supply will also cost twice as much as cheap crud (no need to go overboard with the watts).
but in the end, you'll have a computer that will last and last and last; and you'll be safe in the knowledge that everything that's in your computer is the good stuff!
