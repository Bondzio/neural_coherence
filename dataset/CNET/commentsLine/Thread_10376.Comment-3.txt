thank you for pointing me towards netswitcher, and i will definitely check it out.
however, i am definitely a novice when it comes to networking, and i could really use assistance in establishing the very basic procedural steps for installing a router at home, given that i already have the notebook adapter card and that i know all the security/network name/password options i want to put in place.
holding all that aside, if you were advising someone on how to install a router from the moment it is purchased at the store, specifically what is the appropriate order of the various steps that are necessary?
i have been told that i need to download upgrades/patches from the netgear website, to install software on my computer, and to physically connect the router, but i am not sure of what order to complete these steps.
any help in that regard would be greatly appreciated.
thanks!
