hello, all, after reading cnet's recent newsletter article about the poor guy whose laptop was stolen from his hotel, i'd like to try password protecting my hard drive.
my data is backed up via carbonite for my own needs, but i'd hate for the thing to get stolen and have some hack get my stuff.
i understand that some pcs offer the option to password protect hds and some don't.
i have an hp pavilion dv9500t, vista premium--any idea whether this is a possibility for me?
and if so, where can i find a how-to?
i've tried searching the computer's own help function and got nothin'.
thanks!
