my gateway will not always boot on the first push of the power button when attempting to start after the computer has been turned off for several hours.
have no problem starting the computer shortly after it has run.
the computer will at times boot on the first push of the power button, but most alway will require two to three attempts.
can anyone help me with this issue.
