<s> http://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/wishlist/PublicWishDetail.asp?WishListNumber=5317466 The only parts I am not sure about are the motherboard and the power supply. </s>
<s> I don't know if thats enough for all that stuff. </s>
<s> also, on the motherboard I doubt I am ever going to do SLI for an 8800. and I am also only going to have one (maybe one more) SATA hard drive in there and one older hard drive. </s>
<s> I do know that I plan on having this computer a while though so should I go for a good mobo like that or does it not matter? </s>
<s> thanks in advance guys. </s>
<s> Motherboard needs DDR2, not DDR. </s>
<s> heh figures it wasn't going to be THAT easy.. </s>
<s> I just went with the best seller and i knew OCZ was good.. ok thanks for that anything else anyone? </s>
<s> You have two mouse listed? </s>
<s> A Gaming one and a Laser? </s>
<s> Do you really need the Intel Core 2 Extreme? </s>
<s> yes it is best but you pay some 3-400 more for it. </s>
<s> Also there is rumor that the prices well drop on all these dual cores sometime in July Augs. </s>
<s> If you can wait this same Extreme well be around 2-300 from what it sounds like. </s>
<s> EVGA nForce 680i SLI NVIDIA Socket 775 ATX motherboard w 4gb ram Core 2 Extreme qx6800 2 NEC MultiSync LCD3210-BK 32&quot; LCD Monitors Radeon X1650 Pro, but I'm upgrading that next week 2 Seagate 500gb 7200rpm SATA HDD The motherboard is excellent and the bios easily supports overclocking. </s>
<s> Good choices. </s>
<s> hey madtownidiot, i'm planning to build a new system with the qx6800 processor. </s>
<s> now, i've been looking everywhere to try and find this processor, but no luck. </s>
<s> i read somewhere that Intel only sells it to OEM companies like Dell, Alienware, etc, but not to hardware retailers like Newegg, Tigerdirect, etc. </s>
<s> So my big question is: Where did you buy your qx6800 from ? </s>
<s> I really really wanna know. </s>
<s> Thanks a million. </s>
<s> There's very little difference between the QX6700 and the QX6800 except that maybe you can OC a QX6800 a little more I get mine from a company called Maingear through a personal connection, but they're not generally available except to computer manufacturers, although that will probably change in about a month when Intel lowers their prices </s>
