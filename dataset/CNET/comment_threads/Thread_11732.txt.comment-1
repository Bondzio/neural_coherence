I have an internal DSL modem that has internet connection sharing enabled and a network switch connecting it to the other computers in the house, and my xbox.
However, I can't get my xbox live to work.
I input the DNS server values that my isp gave me.
Every time I try to connect it comes up with an error that says &quot;network services (DHCP or PPoE) were not found&quot; i know that i do not have a PPoE dsl connection.
Help me please.
