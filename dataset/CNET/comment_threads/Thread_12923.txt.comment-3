http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=424182&lang=en&docname=c00191902 ...your system supports a max of 1GB, which you have.
When I google the memory you have, results are inconclusive, so it's unclear if you have registered memory or unbuffered.

If you are trying to put in memory that uses ECC or that is registered, it won't work.

If you use froogle.google.com to search for places that sell it, you can find them here: http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=P5300U%23ABA&btnG=Search+Froogle Good luck.
