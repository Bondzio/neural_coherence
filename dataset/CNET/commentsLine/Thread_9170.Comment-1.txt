on a dell dimension 8100, with windows me, whenever the computer is booted, the mouse and keyboard work to enter the password, but as soon as the desktop appears, they both freeze up.
then the only way to shut down is by the button on the front of tower.
have tried mouse and keyboard on another computer and they work.
would appreciate help.
