I agree that Core 2 Duo is the better BFB (bang for buck) right now.
The caviat comes in with my price limit.
I am supposed to build the best computer possible being as close to $700 as possible.
I can do it with a Conroe E6300, but it is hard to find a good mobo that doesnt cost as much as the proc!
We will see how it ends up.
