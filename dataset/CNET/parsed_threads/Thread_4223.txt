<s> I just got an HP Pavilion a6157c desktop with Vista Premium Home, E4400 processor (2.0GHz), 320 Hard Drive, 2GB RAM, Integrated Intel 950 Accelerator graphics &quot;card&quot;. </s>
<s> I downgraded from HP a6077c w/ NVIDIA 7500LE card, because of monitor issues and keyboarding issues that kept being unresolved. </s>
<s> I saved $300, but am now having trouble loading my Yahoo browser email. </s>
<s> I freeze. </s>
<s> Is this due to my graphics &quot;card&quot; (chip is more appropriate)?????? </s>
<s> How do i resolve this. </s>
<s> Doesn't have an effect on that, sounds like a connection issue maybe? </s>
<s> What browser are you using? </s>
<s> Yahoo is the browser, but I need to go through Internet Explorer to get to it. </s>
<s> With Vista, I don't have a dedicated icon anymore like I did with XP, why? </s>
<s> I don't know. </s>
<s> SHould I download a newer version of IE? </s>
<s> I'm running the latest (7x). </s>
<s> It might not be Vista compatable, which might explain why it isn't working. </s>
<s> If all you're wanting is the icon back, just right click on the .exe and create a shortcut, and drag that onto your desktop. </s>
<s> Also, I'd generally suggest Firefox or Opera as web browsers. </s>
<s> I never went through Firefox. </s>
<s> I generally use IE, because most systems come equipped that way. </s>
<s> Is it better? </s>
<s> How? </s>
<s> Where can I download it? </s>
<s> C-Net? </s>
<s> Free? </s>
<s> Which was the basis for a Supreme Court case involving Microsoft and the DoJ. </s>
<s> Firefox is entirely free, cnet might have it on download.com (probably does). </s>
<s> But www.getfirefox.com also works. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what your actual problem is, given that I don't understand your explanation of using the Yahoo browser &quot;through&quot; internet explorer. </s>
<s> If you mean the Yahoo Toolbar thats a different thing. </s>
<s> I just want to say Firefox has solved A LOT of my browser issues. </s>
<s> (I was using the term &quot;browser&quot; wrong in the previous post, sorry). </s>
<s> I got rid of IE, and downloaded the latest Firefox, imported my Yahoo toolbar, etc...and WOW! </s>
<s> Things are soooooooooooooo much faster!!! </s>
<s> No hanging, no freezing! </s>
<s> AMAZING!!!! </s>
<s> I wish I knew about Firefox before. </s>
<s> Even the typing issues I've had in the past have gone away! </s>
<s> I knew it had something to do with my homepage, but I was assuming it was because of Yahoo, not IE. </s>
<s> What makes Firefox so superior to IE???? </s>
<s> ? </s>
