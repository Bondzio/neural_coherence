Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. Right now, I'm assuming she has something between a 200MHz Intel Celeron running Windows 3.0 and an AMD Athlon64 4400+ running Windows Vista Beta 1. The model number, hardware changes, operating system, etc is of considerable importance. John
