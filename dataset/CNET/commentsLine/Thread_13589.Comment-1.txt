when trying to print on overhead projection film with an epson sx405 all in one printer, the film is passed straight thro' the printer and ejected completely blank, this also produces an error message saying that the printer has a paper jam, which is not so.
the same document can be printed correctly on paper.
a much older epson printer handles overhead projection film without any problem what so ever.
does anyone know how to solve this problem on the sx405?
