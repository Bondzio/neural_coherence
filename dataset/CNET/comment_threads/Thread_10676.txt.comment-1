I have to ask this.
Considering the size and dimensions of the IPad, is a rear camera really needed?
I mean, I can see a camera mounted facing the user, this has a place, it can be a web-cam for video chat, Skype, etc.
But a back-mounted camera is kinda pointless.
I would be like a hard-back book doubling as a camera..WHY???
I can't imagine (actually sadly enough I can imagine) people using this book sized thing as a camera, would look [and mostly like be] the most awkward sized and silly to use camera in the world?
I do realize CNet is chock-full of Apple fan-boys so I would love to hear other takes / opinions on the subject.
