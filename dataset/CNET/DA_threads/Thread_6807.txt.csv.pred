1.1.2	The problem is I am not to sure to know which one I have .	St
1.1.3	The computer user manual do n't tell , neither it says so on the mother board or in the computer periphical section .	St
1.1.4	I checked a few sites about AGP cards but they made me confuses even more .	St
1.1.5	My card is Brown and has a key in the middle near the front of the computer .	St
1.1.6	I found a site that might be usefull : http : //www.abcd.com.au/v/agp_slot.htm It looks like the Green one model , but it 's brown .	St
1.1.7	I supose color does n't mean anything but I just want to be sure before buying any cards .	St
1.1.8	Let me know please .	Sug
1.1.9	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	Computer make & model ?	Ques
1.2.2	Motherboard model ?	Ques
1.2.3	If you need help , download and run Belarc Advisor from Download.com .	St
1.3.1	I am not too sure if this is the right info you need .	St
1.3.2	Model : eMachines D4362 Board : First International Computer , Inc. P4-865G series /VL33 PCB 1.x Bus Clock : 200 megahertz BIOS : Phoenix Technologies , LTD IFN422TM 03/09/2004 Intel ( R ) 82801EB Ultra ATA Storage Controllers Thank you	St
1.4.1	Unplug the computer tower and open the side up .	St
1.4.2	Lay the tower on its side with the open side up and have the back of the computer facing away from you .	St
1.4.3	Look at the area of the board facing the farthest away from you , you should see around four slots ( PCI ) .	St
1.4.4	Now look to the right of the PCI slots , if you see one slot off by itself and a little closer to you than the rest then that should be the AGP slot ( most boards only have one ) .	St
1.5.1	Google : eMachines D4362 All the links that I saw indicated that the slot is AGP 8X .	St
1.5.2	Keep in mind that if you upgrade to a high-end gaming card , you may have to upgrade the PSU , too .	St
1.6.1	I know that , I opened it up and saw the AGP Slot for the card .	St
1.6.2	Problem is , it not written on the board what AGP Slot it is ( well I looked and looked and see nothing on the board near the AGP Slot ) .	St
1.6.3	I could n't find for sure anywhere what kind of slot it was for the D4362 on google ( there seems to be little info about this model ) .	St
1.6.4	Also , the slot is brown , not green but it 's made like the green one ( visit the url I posted and you 'll understand what I mean ) .	St
1.6.5	So I need to know if it 's a 2x one or 8x one .	St
1.6.6	Thank you in advance .	St
1.7.1	It 's AGP 8X .	St

1.10.1	ALL THE HELP NEEDED HAS BEEN RECEIVED SO THE TOPIC HAS BEEN CLOSED .	St
1.11.1	I do hope this procedrue helps .	St
1.11.2	You need to open your PC casing .	St
1.11.3	Many mother board manufacturers have the PCI slots in white color , the memory board slots in blue , the IDE cable slots have one blue or black and then white , the CNR slot brown , and the AGP slot brown .	St
1.11.4	Try to notice where you attach your monitor cable to the back of your PC .	St
1.11.5	IF the female plug ( where you attach your monitor cable ) is located on the top most portion of back the panel - ( with the PC casing in upright position ) , there is a 90 % chance that your PC is using an AGP card .	St
1.11.6	If the monitor cable is plugged to the second , third or fourth slot , then it could be a PCI video card .	St
1.11.7	If you are still not sure , you can download a Fresh Diagnose program or software fromF Fresh Devices .	St
1.11.8	It is free .	St
1.11.9	The software identifies all parts attached to your PC from mother board to adapters , PCI slots , etc .	St
1.11.10	Some AGP card brands like S3 , Nvidia , Inno 3D , etc .	St
1.11.11	are also displayed during boot sequence ( upon powering up your PC ) inclusive of the adapter type and version number .	St
1.11.12	If still in doubt , call the dealer where you bought your PC , surely they will know what type of video card they used to your PC , could be PCI , AGP or internal ( on-board ) .	St
