I need to clarify that my ANCIENT PC died a horrible death, so it is not the issue for this post.
What I really need to know is if I REALLY NEED these applications that I have downloaded on my AT&T PANTECH P4100 Android 4.0.4 OS tablet, or are they unnecessary apps that are just taking up space: BATCH UNINSTALLER; CLEANMASTER; LOOKOUT v8.24-59c0ddc; & Android's new MALWAREBYTES.ANTIMALWARE?
I only have this tablet and my: Apple 3GS IPhone for the internet now, which is all I really need for my personal use.
I sync my pictures and contacts, a few other minor things, a few games, and find my phone or device feature.
If you can just let me know if these apps are just a waste of space or really necessary?
Thank you for your help.
