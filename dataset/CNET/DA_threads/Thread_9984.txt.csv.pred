1.1.1	im going to do a positive pressure system when i get my new case however the ratio of air in/air out is very dramatic.	St
1.1.2	it would be around 250:100 [in/out] and im not sure if it would be counter intuitive to have too much pressure in the system.	St
1.1.3	what are normal ratios of air for a positive pressure system?	St
1.2.1	Usually the old in/out is such that I've never had a problem.	St
1.2.2	You seen to want to create a new way of cooling so my advice is to try your idea, measure the temps and then try the other options.	St
1.2.3	I know some may want to model this but I find modeling is expensive and time consuming compared to the old fashioned use the usual setup and measure it.	St
