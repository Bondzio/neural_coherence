im burning cd's for my husband to take to clients....they are three simple mpeg videos.
when I take them to an older computer....one with just a cd burner/player.
It gets an error.
... it says it needs an addon in order to play the mpeg-2 file.
What?
it works fine on my computer...but everyone else cant play it.
What am I doing wrong?
