For an older printer, it could be that there's no Vista driver. In such a case, return the printer to your friend. Kees

However the cost of printer jets or service can be more than a new printer. You need to cost it out. Bob

Built for office use, the paper handling is amazing. Print speed is great and for me the printing costs are not more than average. My next favorite printer is any HP laser. BW printing may be dull but it is cheap. Bob

Do not drop this on your feet. The print speed is great and it's paper handling far better than what you see in consumer printers. It's now years old and doing fine. It was not expensive and has never needed service. Bob
