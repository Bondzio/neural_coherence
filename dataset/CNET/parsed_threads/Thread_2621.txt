<s> I have an 2007 Netgear Router WGT624 and tried to do a Firmware Upgrade via the Router's Admin page ( via Browser) on a MacBookPro (10.6.8). </s>
<s> The upgrade failed and bricked the Router. </s>
<s> The WIFI light failed to be light indicating failure as well. </s>
<s> Its IP address is no longer 192.168.0.1 but another one. </s>
<s> The router cannot be accessed via Ethernet cable by BOTH my Mac OS or Windows (via Boot Camp). </s>
<s> The Factory reset did not help. </s>
<s> Finally, the Tech Support admitted that their routers cannot be managed by Mac and I should not have upgraded the firmware using a Mac. </s>
<s> They failed to suggest 1) a way to flash the ROM with a corrected firmware , 2) to take it back for repair or give me voucher for a new router. </s>
<s> Given the price of new routers, the WGT is surely obsolete and now unsuable. </s>
<s> I was dismayed by Netgear 's software failure to detect a Mac users and give an Error message or Warning. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> If you brick it, they only can replace it. </s>
<s> No user method to resurrect it? </s>

<s> Oh, yes there is a way. </s>

<s> Reality? </s>
<s> A new router may be the cheap exit. </s>
<s> Maybe someone will buy your bricked router? </s>

<s> Thanks for the suggestions and comments. </s>
<s> Since I have nothing to lose, I will try the Australian solution. </s>
<s> I am challenged by the prospect to resurrect it. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; I could not believe my eyes that the problem first surfaced in 2006 and Netgear never fixed its Firmware Upgrade after the bricking of their routers. </s>
<s> What amazes me is that 2011 Tech Support (somewhere in Asia, probably the Philippines by the names of their staff) could not identify the issue on the first email ( no voice or chat support since I was out of warranty). </s>
<s> Any suggestions on a reliable new Router brand or model? </s>
<s> I already own a few Apple (Mushroom, Time Capsule and Express) and a still working Netgear as well. </s>
<s> Thanks &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> This issue looks to be mostly on older units. </s>
<s> While I do know WHY they can't fix this with a firmware update, that's something I'd discuss in a seminar or over a lunch with other software engineers. </s>
<s> No excuse but all makers have products that can be bricked. </s>
