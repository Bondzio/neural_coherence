1.1.1	Hi, I am thinking of purchasing a BFG nVidia 7300 GT OC graphics card and it needs a 350 watt power supply, will it still work if I disable some enhanced graphics capabilities?	St
1.1.2	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	It turns out that card is very hungry and in their case the machine would not boot.	St

1.3.1	Is there any way I can use that card without buying a new power supply?	Ques
1.4.1	If i disable everything in the device manager that i do not use will it work?	St
1.5.1	If i did try it could it cause damage to the card or any other components?	St

1.8.1	i know several people who've put 7600gs (the next step up in the nvidia lineup) in machines with 300W power supplies and they're working fine.	St
1.8.2	if the card doesn't need an external pci-e power connector (and 7300gt's don't), it doesn't draw that much power.	St
1.8.3	nvidia 7000 series GPUs are very power frugal and simply do not need a huge power supply.	St
1.8.4	if you don't believe me, believe these figures: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2717&p=4 http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise_6.html a normal PC with a 7600gt (2 steps up from a 7300gt) at full load only draws 205W so a good 300W power supply is certainly sufficient in a typical pc (one hard drive, one optical drive, non-overclocked cpu).	St
1.8.5	with that sadi, the manufacturer's suggested power supply is a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; and based on a somewhat &quot;full&quot; pc.	St
1.8.6	nvidia recommends 18A on the 12V rail.	St
1.8.7	if your power supply doesn't list the amperage of the 12V rail, all is not lost.	St
1.8.8	good power supplies are usually conservative in their ratings; conversely, bad ones typically overstate their figures.	St
1.8.9	just buy it and plug it in.	Sug
1.8.10	if it posts, you're in good shape for the 2nd test: play a game (or a benchmark like 3dmark05 from here: http://www.futuremark.com/download/ ).	St
1.8.11	if the game/benchmark plays without issue, you're fine.	St
1.8.12	if the boot fails, then the power supply is probably *already bad*.	St
1.8.13	if the pc crashes during the benchmark, or the graphics are corrupted during the game, then the powersupply is being overtaxed.	St
1.8.14	if either of these fails, *then* get a new powersupply.	St
