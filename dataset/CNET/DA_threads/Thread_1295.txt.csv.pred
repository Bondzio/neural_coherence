1.1.1	Hi , I have a 4 year old Dell Dimension 4550 PC desktop .	St
1.1.2	The PC came with 256mg RAM , and I added 512mg RAM to it 3 years ago .	St
1.1.3	I do n't want to toss this PC , but it 's running a tad sluggish .	St
1.1.4	Would increasing the current 768mg RAM to 1gb RAM ( max it can take=1gb RAM ) would make an appreciable difference ?	Ques
1.1.5	The cost would be about $ 75 ( if I bought through Dell ) .	St
1.1.6	$ is not the issue , but I also do n't want to waste my time if consensus says & quot ; the PC is too old for the additional RAM to make a difference. & quot ; I use the PC for web-browsing , email , MS Office , and the kids sometimes play not-so-intense web-based games .	St
1.1.7	thanks .	Polite
1.1.8	- walkman	St
1.2.1	Before you upgrade your memory look at your swap space or virtual memory .	St
1.2.2	right click on My Computer / System properties/ Advanced / Performance / settings .	St
1.2.3	This is how much space on the disk ( usually C ) you have allowed for big memory applications or multi-tasking when you launch a bunch of programs to have for swapping and saving information .	St
1.2.4	If you 've filled up the C drive and that space has decreased or has never been increased it might be why you 've gotten sluggish .	St
1.2.5	Then I would say look to other sources for that older memory , it 'll probably be cheaper elsewhere including used off e-bay and will answer your question .	St
1.2.6	Memory is the best performance enchancer most of the time .	St
1.2.7	Past that some of these $ 399 systems being offered now sure perform better than older systems , with smaller amounts of memory but faster bus speeds , CPU 's and graphics .	St
1.3.1	light of use .	St
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	If you 're running XP OS , 1gb of ram is the most practical and useful amount of ram to have .	St
1.4.2	In that light though do n't expect globs of improvement it simply will be better overall .	St
1.4.3	You can however try to do the usual tweeking and such in order that the system itself can best run .	St
1.4.4	That usually means , cleaning of excess or unwanted files or pgms.. and clean and defrag the HD .	St
1.4.5	Use a registry cleaner .	St
1.4.6	I 'm sure you can find outside of Dell , other ram sources for your model at less cost and again in that light it wo n't hurt to have 1gb of ram .	St
1.4.7	If you 're running WinMe , having 768mb of ram is n't that good as 512mb is best for overall operation , but you did n't mention what OS you had .	St
1.4.8	is say that as 512mb was best because WinME had a glitch of a ram issue and it never was resolved , if I recall right even with the small fix .	St
1.4.9	But no WinMe , do n't worry .	St
1.4.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
