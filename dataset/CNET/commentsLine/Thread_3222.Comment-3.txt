1. installing xp may have deleted the 4mb f10 diagnostic/boot menu nondos partition.
do you still have the f10 &quot;setup&quot; option?
at boot?
2. if not, you must start over again with no partitions on your hdd after downloading the floppy maker from hp-compaq and have 3 no-error floppies.
you go through a process of inserting the different floppies back and forth or use the floppies by themselves at boot that will present bios/setup to you.
3. then make a primary dos fat32 partition and load win98.
you'll have to have the downloaded drivers on a cd or slave hdd.
4.  to start the search for presario driver section and more.
you only lose the f10 partition if you have deleted all partitions or have a new hdd.
