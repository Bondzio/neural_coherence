Bob, Thank you for your quick reply!
Here is the type of MB my hubby purchased: INTEL P4 HT LGA 775 FSB 800 DDR 400 ATX MOTHERBOARD+L+S I asked hubby for more info on the computer (he bought the kit and helped his friend build it), but he said he couldn't really provide any more info than I did initially.
According to the USPS, it's now in Maryland (we live one state over).
Thanks, Bindarra
