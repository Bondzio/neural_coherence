you could try freezing the drive.
i don't know about a burnt out circuit, but drives with heat problems can be used by sticking them in the freezer for a day or two and work for about 20 minutes or so before crashing again.
(this usually one works 2 or 3 times in a row then *dead*.)
chances are you will need to take it to a repair shop and have them get the data off of it.
