I wanted to add an AP on the second floor of the house for better signal. I have read that APs from different manuafacturers are not necessarily compatible for seamless roaming. I just want to see if anyone has experiences on it. Well, I guess the worst case is to turn off wifi on the SURFBoard and get 2 identical APs, but that's not ideal. Thanks for any suggestions.

That is, while we can roam, any connection is lost as we move from one hotspot to another. You are dealing with a MSFT OS so is this level of seamless acceptable? Bob
