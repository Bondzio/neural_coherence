ted: oddly enuf, i have always had a second hard drive on my computers until this one.
the hard drive technology on this one made it impossible to install a hard drive from my previous pc, or i'd have one already.
i'm going to sit back and think on this.
i'll get back here in a few days, later this week, and maybe we can &quot;talk&quot; again.
i had not thought about a 2nd internal drive.
that might be better.
i'll write more later and maybe you can help me with an internal drive.
thanks, ann
