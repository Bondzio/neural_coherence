Thanks in advance for any help anyone could give me.
I am on an older Dell Desktop that does not have high speed USB 2.0 A lot of the External Hard Drives I see have 2.0 in the name.
For example a random google says &quot;Toshiba's 400GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive&quot;.
Does this mean it has to have a 2.0 drive to work?
Secondly I am almost exclusively going to be storing music on this hard drive as a means of moving around my growing music collection.
Will moving music onto the hard drive and possibly back onto another computer degrade the quality of the track?
And lastly if anyone could make recommendation for a good external hard drive that will work for my needs and computer it would be much appreciated.
I am running Windows XP and Service pack 2, not a terribly old computer by some standards, it just does not have a 2.0 highspeed USB slot.
Thank you again for any help!
