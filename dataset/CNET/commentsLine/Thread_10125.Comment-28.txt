cooling addendum #2 ------------------- my first post on this topic generated abit of feedback.
i had hoped in general terms that cooling tips would benefit those that read and passed along their tips.
it seems it has, thanks.
i like to add that cooling in general has been taken a serious step by vendors to provide &quot;bolt-on&quot; items to better cool your system.
these are: 1) replace original cpu fan/heatsink(hsf) with a better rated one 2) add extra fan(s) on case or larger size fan(s) 3) use water cooling 4) replace case side covers, extra fan holes/exhaust 5) replace/wrap wire harness(better airflow) 6) relocate psu to bottom(depends) 7) use of buss/slot fans 8) use of refrigeration cooler or peltier units 9) better cases in general 10) laptop/notebook cooler any cutting, removal or additional work to a system case is considering &quot;modding&quot;.
the term implies you've done something extra or done diy project beyond the norm.
as everyone's system is different, what works for you is obviously better outcome.
some users have relocated their system to custom cases(they build).
as for up off floor statement, that was meant to imply to remove off floor to lessen dust intake and pet dander, etc.. it needn't be much, but some users have used milk crate.
a small table does fine as well but again what works for you, is fine.
please add your comments.
thanks -----willy
