1.1.1	Hi , I have a NETGEAR WGR614 wireless router that is connected to a cable modem in one part of the house .	St
1.1.2	I 'm thinking of getting Vonage , and if I do , I will get a free Linksys WRTP54G Wireless router .	St
1.1.3	In my studio in another part of the house ( within wireless range ) , I have a MacBook and a Dell Desktop running Ubuntu .	St
1.1.4	Currently , I have the MacBook connected to the NETGEAR via wireless , and the Dell wired to the MacBook with an Ethernet cable .	St
1.1.5	I am sharing the internet connection from the MacBook with the desktop .	St
1.1.6	Now , here 's the issue : If I get the Linksys wireless router , It will be set up in place of the Netgear .	St
1.1.7	I would like to use the Netgear as a sort of & quot ; distribution point & quot ; for a subnet in my studio ... To put that differently , I would like to have the Netgear router in my studio , and have my laptop and desktop hard-wired into it via ethernet .	St
1.1.8	I would then like to have that Netgear router connect to the Linksys over wifi , and distribute that connection over ethernet ( sort of like what I am using my laptop for now , except without the need to have a computer on all the time ) .	St
1.1.9	I do n't really care if it rebroadcasts the signal , as I do n't really need that .	St
1.1.10	I just want a connection available to the desktop , even when my laptop is not powered on or available .	St
1.1.11	Is it possible to do this ?	Ques
1.2.1	To fill in dead spots as well as other reasons I hooked up this .	St
1.2.2	Cable modem - & gt ; Netgear wifi router - & gt ; Buffalo wifi router .	St
1.2.3	Works fine .	Polite
1.2.4	Why not do that ?	Ques
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	That 's not really what I was hoping to do ...	St
1.3.2	I do n't have dead spots or lack of connectivity ...	Ques
1.3.3	I want to use the router as a sort of distribution point of the wireless signal ... Kind of like the reverse of what it normally does ... . Have it recieve the wireless signal from the main router , and then distribute it via ethernet .	St
1.4.1	I looked at your router and it does n't do bridge mode .	St
1.4.2	I decline to teach what a BRIDGE is but armed with the proper name you can research what to use .	St
1.4.3	My setup works fab since I get 2 times the possible wifi speed ( split over the 2 channels ) and & quot ; it works. & quot ; I ca n't guess what you are trying to do but will guess you did n't want to pick up a couple more wifi client adapters .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	& quot ; I ca n't guess what you are trying to do but will guess you did n't want to pick up a couple more wifi client adapters. & quot ; Well , sort of , but not really ...	St
1.5.2	I just seem to have connectivity problems when I 'm running two wireless adapters in such close proximity .	St
1.5.3	Also , the desktop in my studio is running linux , and I have not been able to get my adapter to work , despite hours of hacking and fiddling .	St
1.6.1	There are other issues such as use of WEP or no security but that 's covered in our forum sticky .	St
1.6.2	You skipped sharing the details so we ca n't tackle the problem you want to fix .	St
1.6.3	With my setup you could have a pair of WPA-PSK wifi routers on different RF channels , SSID broadcasting ( see forum sticky as to why ) and it works fine for most .	St
1.6.4	Again , if you do n't try it our way then you should share what you are doing .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=WGPS606NAR & cat=NET and it 's not very expensive .	St
1.7.2	In fact I 'm ordering it since I need another printer server .	St
1.7.3	Hope it works with my new vista laptops .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
