i got the free upgrade and attempted to install it... big failure.
first i downloaded vista upgrade advisor and removed like half the programs on my computer that were causing compatibility issues.
next i started to install it; i got about 3/4 the way done and then it stopped with a message telling me to install upgrade advisor and fix compatibility issues... which i already did.
upgrade advisor said everything was correct so i tried again and got the same problem... so i said the heck with it and tossed it... so in the end i lost like half of my programs and documents and still have xp.
pissed the hell outta me!
