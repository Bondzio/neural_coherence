<s> I have been trying to find out some things about these 2 mouse's. </s>
<s> So far the things I have heard about the 2 are this. </s>
<s> Logitech g600 is bigger and really is best for people with big hands but its reliable. </s>
<s> Naga are small and are reliable. </s>
<s> I have touched a naga while at bestbuy but could not get my hands on the Logitech. </s>
<s> And most of the people I have ask have said either one thing or another about both. </s>
<s> I want a mouse that wont break on me in just a few months because it is bad. </s>
<s> I'm not a hard core gamer and I don't mash my buttons hard like some do. </s>
<s> So what is the best mouse in your guys opinion? </s>
<s> My Logitech m510 is about a year old and no sign of fatigue. </s>
<s> It wasn't expensive either. </s>
<s> I'd get it again. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am a Logitech fan and have been for years, that is all I will use, bar none. </s>
