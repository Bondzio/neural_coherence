i have a couple of levels of backup.
one is an external usb 2.0 disk (i access it with esata, much faster than usb 2.0) using a backup app (emc retrospect), and other is offsite storage using carbonite.
so if someone should happen to burgle us and take the computers and backup disks, or our house burns down or is destroyed in an earthquake, etc., we still have all the important stuff backed up so that we can restore it onto another computer.
