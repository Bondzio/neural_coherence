But you can use this DMA off/on procedure to ensure that the channel is not in CPU robbing PIO mode -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx http://aumha.org/win5/a/xpcd.php reveals about all that is known about this feature.

Son-in-law had downloaded a trial version on my PC last week. I remember the DVD burn was taking six forevers and we made some change that sped things up considerably. I guess the changes were in the trial version software.
