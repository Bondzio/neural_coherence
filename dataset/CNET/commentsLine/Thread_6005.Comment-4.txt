i was in exactly the same boat, but i decided not to allow alienware to drag me along that long.
when they started giving me delivery dates that were a month longer than they said when i placed the purchase, i immediately cancelled and built the system myself.
my dollars speak for themselves, i build the same system for about $1500 less and used the difference to buy a nice dell for my niece.
i'll never buy again now that i've built a system on my own.
