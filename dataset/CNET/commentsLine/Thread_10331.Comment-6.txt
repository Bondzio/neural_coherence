i bought this superb 'lg m228wa 22&quot; tft monitor with hd tv yesterday from comet for 229.99. the idea really was just intended as an upgrade from my 19&quot; acer monitor (which was perfectly good anyway), i just felt it would be nice to have a bigger screen, but in all honesty i have just spent the last 11 hours glued to this thing with no squinting problems what-so-ever, i would normally by now be rubbing my eyes after spending that length of time on any computer.
clearly without any question of doubt in my mind 'it is an absolutely fabulous monitor, it really is an amazing piece of kit, also functioning as an hd television.
also very useful it has an enormous array of inputs and outputs, i can and will highly recommend this unit, it's certainly as good as, any dedicated monitor...five star rating to lg.
