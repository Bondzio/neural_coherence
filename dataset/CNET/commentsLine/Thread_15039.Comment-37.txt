i work as a dst and hold multiple tech certs and there are some good ideas in this thread.
a few things to keep in mind... there are viruses and malware which can reside in the boot sectors.
kaspersky has a free tool for getting rid of these which a standard format cannot remove.
after running this, check the integrity of the drive bygoing into a command line and run: chkdsk /r /f reboot as needed.
after chkdsk completes, reboot the system.
you are now ready to wipe the drive.ccleaner can do this but not recommended as wiping a drive while it's in use may not fully wipe everything especially the mbr records.
it's best to use a bootable flash drive with a wipe program.
i prefer wipedrive.
the pro version does a dod level wipe.
however, the free version is fine for standard users, especially if you are planning to reuse them again.
