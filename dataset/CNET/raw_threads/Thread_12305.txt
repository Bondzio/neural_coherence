I haven't heard anyone installing a version of Windows onto a flash drive, but I would guess it's possible. I'm sure people out there with far more knowledge than me would know of more advantages/disadvantages then I have listed below. Disadvantages: Booting onto a flash drive is that it is MUCH slower compared to a regular hard drive. Not all motherboards are capable of booting to a flash drive. You would have check your BIOS to find out. You are limited in your hard drive size. Advantages: You literally have everything in your pocket. Here is something from Tom's Hardware that talks about install Windows XP to a flash drive. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-pocket,1113.html

Why the question, because the answer relies on that. tada -----Willy
