<s> Me and my friend were copying some files (.rar files) and it came up with a message about corrupt data. </s>
<s> We figure, alright we dont get those files. </s>
<s> Then we close it down and plug it into another computer. </s>
<s> Unfortunately instead of coming up with 'maxtor(string of random numbers)' It said, Local drive (g:), and whenever we clicked it, it said corrupt files. </s>
<s> Help Please </s>

<s> If I see you ask something new I'll reply to that. </s>
