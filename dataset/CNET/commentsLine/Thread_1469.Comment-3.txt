from previous post, i have taken my laptop to another house and it finds and connects to wireless network immediately.
so, since i get no wireless signal at my house i presume the router is not providing the signal.
before i go out and buy another router, anything i should check further.
i have reset my router and nothing improves.
thanks in advance.
