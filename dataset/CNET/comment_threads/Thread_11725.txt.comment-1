I have an Asus A7N8X-X mobo that I got to set up as a breadboard just to test things.
According to the manual the BIOS offers ten different possible items to boot from.
It allows selecting three, and then the option Boot Other.
My thoughts would be that the other would only include the 7 unselected ones.
None of the ten are USB.
I guess I'll give the list in the event that someone may want it: floppy, LS120, HDD 1, 2, 3, SCSI, CDROM, LAN.
I have a 1 GB sandisk mini cruzer to use.
Might want to run things such as Memtest from it.
