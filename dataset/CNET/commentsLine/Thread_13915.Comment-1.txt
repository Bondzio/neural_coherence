hello everyone!
i think i have thought of a way to backup my current hdd.
would it be possible to buy a dvd writer, put all my data on dvds, install the new hdd and put files on?
but don't dvds only hold video files?
i have a 9.39gb hdd and i am going to upgrade to 80gb hdd.
i am using a desktop pc.
all suggestions appreciated, -larry
