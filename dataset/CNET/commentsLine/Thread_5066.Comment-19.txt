i'm comparing prices with the ones you shown me with others i've found that is similar.
i'm checking with shipping fees as well.
browsing at other possible stores.
just checking on the prices, basically.
lol sorry for all the hassles.
it really takes quite some time and effort to get it all in my head and to start understanding things more and more.
you have patience and i appreciate that.
i know how you feel.
i've taught asl in college along with my interpreter, which she was an instructor for asl 1 and 2 classes in college.
i helped her teaching the classes and i helped students out of classes and i've taken over her classes as well.
i know how patience is important and rewarding.
you're a good person.
