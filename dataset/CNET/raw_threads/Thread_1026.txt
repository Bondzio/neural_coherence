Well, I have a Dell Inspiron 530 and I just swapped out a failing 250 gig hard drive with a new 1TB one. I installed Windows Vista Home that came with my computer and the driver disk that came with my PC, but the Ethernet controller didn't install. I downloaded a few of the drivers from the Dell website and tried them, and the sign isn't there anymore, BUT I still have the same problem as before, I can't fully connect to the internet. The computer is connecting to a router via a Wireless-N Linksys adapter. Perhaps the wrong driver installed? I'd give you guys the model of the LAN card but I have no idea how to find it. It's very frustrating and I know this same thing has been asked over and over and I've looked but I can't seem to find help.

I try to get on google but it keeps trying to connect without ever doing so. It eventually goes back to saying I'm on a local connection, not internet.

I had version 1.02 which I had downloaded from their website, and I somehow came across 1.04, which magically fixed it. Wish they had some sort of notification. I was off by .02
