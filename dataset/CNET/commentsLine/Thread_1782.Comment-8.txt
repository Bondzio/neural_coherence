i think you meant 2gb or 4gb of memory rather than 2mb to 4mb.
it's also kinda hard to help you with this decision because it really depends on how you use you machine.
2gb will be enough to do all that you described earlier.
the good news is if you want to start out with 2gb and you're not happy with it, then you can always upgrade 1gb at a time until you reach whatever works for you.
as far as choosing a screen size, i'd say take a trip to your local apple dealer like onemoremile suggested and see what size and weight you're willing to carry around with you.
