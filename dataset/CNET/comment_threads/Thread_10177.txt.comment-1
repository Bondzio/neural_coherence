What a pain.
I have a Seagate and Maxtor-drive system with an 80-pin cable installed.
I've tried two drives and yet I get a &quot;no 80 conductor cable installed&quot; error message.
Is this a mainboard issue?
It just happened one day when I turned on the computer, though I've had compatability problems since I got the Seagate.
Don't know if it's coincidence or not.
I've installed millions of hard disks and have never had this happen.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks.
