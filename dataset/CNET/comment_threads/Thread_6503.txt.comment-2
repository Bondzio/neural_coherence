Clean all the rollers and paper feed mechanism (basically all the parts which come into contact with the topside of the paper as it feeds through) with some safe solvent like that used to clean cassette players or CD discs.
use cotton-buds for the more inaccessible areas.
You should also try running several sheets of plain paper through after that with the 'paper out' button.
The paper will pick up any stray or excess ink from places you can't reach.
repeat with fresh sheets util you start geting unmarked pages.
