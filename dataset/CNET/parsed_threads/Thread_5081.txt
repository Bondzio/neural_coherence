<s> Dear All, I want to buy a new PC. </s>
<s> To get more information i browsed Intel's website. </s>
<s> My choice may be Celeron D, Pentium D or Pentium 4 Processor. </s>
<s> They support features like: Intel 64 Bit Computing, Execute Disable Bit And i got this on the website: 64-bit computing on Intel architecture requires a computer system with a processor, chipset, BIOS, operating system, device drivers and applications enabled for Intel 64 architecture. </s>
<s> Processors will not operate (including 32-bit operation) without an Intel 64 architecture-enabled BIOS. </s>
<s> Performance will vary depending on your hardware and software configurations. </s>
<s> Consult with your system vendor for more information. </s>
<s> Enabling Execute Disable Bit functionality requires a PC with a processor with Execute Disable Bit capability and a supporting operating system. </s>
<s> Check with your PC manufacturer on whether your system delivers Execute Disable Bit functionality. </s>
<s> So my question is do they support operating systems like Windows 2000 Prof., Windows XP or i have to go for their 64 bit versions? </s>
<s> What is the CPU number available now which will support Windows 2000 Prof. SP4 or Windows XP SP2, will be economical and which do not need special hardware or software? </s>
