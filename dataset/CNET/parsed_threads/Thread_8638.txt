<s> Esteemed List: I have an Epson Stylus CX6000 copier-printer-scanner. </s>
<s> I have a newish Intel 2.13 GHz MacBook, OS 10.6.2 (Snow Leopard) with 2 GBs SDRAM and PhotoShop Elements 8. </s>
<s> I migrated all my compatible software from a G4 12&quot; PowerBook running OS 10.3.9, including the Epson software package - printer drivers, scanner, etc. </s>
<s> - and the printer/copier works fine but neither Elements nor the laptop recognize the scanner software. </s>
<s> The Epson site has a &quot;complete&quot; driver update for Snow Leopard that supposedly covers these issues. </s>
<s> There is a warning that some parts of the drivers require OS 10.5, which this laptop never had. </s>
<s> My question: is it safe to download and install these updated drivers? </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions?I do a fair amount of scanning work and need to access the Epson. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> White 2.13 GHz Macbook, OS 10.6.2, 2 GBs SDRAM; Epson Stylus CX6000, Epson Scan 2.90 software; Epson Printer Utility and Epson Printer Utility 2. </s>
<s> importing from the Preview app? </s>
<s> Or using the Image Capture app to grab stuff from the scanner. </s>
<s> It is probably safe to install the stuff from Epson, if it requires 10.5, and you don't have it, it should avoid installing those parts. </s>
