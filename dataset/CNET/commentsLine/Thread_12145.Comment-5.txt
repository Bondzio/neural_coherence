bob, i hope that my question didn't irritate you near as much as your response seemed that it did!!
if so, i apologize.
as i said, i'm a novice at this... your first email indicated that i couldn't move the programs, but that was different than my second question.
i took all the steps to register cs2, so i will try to contact adobe and see if i can get either cs2 replaced or the current cs4 at a reduced rate.
thank you for that advice!
karen
