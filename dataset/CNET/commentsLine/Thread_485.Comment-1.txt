my motherboard is a gigabyte ga-965p-ds4.
all information about sata hotswapping is very unclear: does this motherboard support sata hotswapping?
that is, does it have the ability to detect if you connect a external harddrive with sata-ii connector, to the sata port (through an e-sata connector at the back of my case, that is connected directly to one of the motherboard's sata ports).
if i try in linux, nothing happens.
if i try in windows, nothing happens either.
and if i disconnect it while in windows, it crashes.
so i assume that either my linux and windows will need some drivers to support e-sata hotswapping, or the motherboard just doesn't support it.
does anyone know what the deal is, and how i can get it to work?
i can connect the external hd through usb2.0 of course, but sata is much faster, i want to play games from this hd and still have the ability to disconnect it from my pc and connect it again without rebooting.
