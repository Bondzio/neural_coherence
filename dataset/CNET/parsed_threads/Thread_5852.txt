<s> I have two different networks for my computers. </s>
<s> (The reason is complicated and has to do with online backup and Comcast bandwidth caps.) </s>
<s> All of my computers are on one network, except for one Mac that has all my photos and videos. </s>
<s> I would like to plug a Drobo in to that Mac for backup purposes and then use the DroboShare to share those files to all the other computers (on a different network) and allow other computers to back up to the Drobo. </s>
<s> The connection to the Mac, which is the one on the different network, would be a direct Firewire/USB connection. </s>
<s> The various computers are Windows, Mac, and Linux. </s>
<s> Is this possible with a Drobo? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Look at servers you access everyday on the internet. </s>
<s> You must know that those servers run anything and every operating system you've ever heard of and your Mac, PC access them just fine. </s>
<s> However it's very strange to think about connecting to that drobo across multiple interfaces. </s>
<s> What article made you think that works? </s>
<s> In closing. </s>
<s> Connect the drobo to droboshare and then to the network. </s>
<s> All is well and done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No article in particular, but it seems logical that it would. </s>
<s> Let me explain again what I am looking for: I would like the Drobo to connect via Firewire or USB to one computer and also connect to my network. </s>
<s> The reason is that that one computer has its own router and is not connected to the other computers. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> &quot;Heh, it has firewire, usb and ethernet. </s>
<s> Why should each work at the same time?&quot; The answer is not what you may want to hear. </s>
<s> So the answer is no, then? </s>
<s> Is there any work around? </s>
<s> Would some sort of splitter work? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Your splitter. </s>
<s> Why not use that? </s>
<s> Perhaps I have not been clear. </s>
<s> One computer is on a different network from the others. </s>
<s> That's just plain old networking. </s>
<s> I took it what you wanted to plug into the firewire port at the same time the droboshare was active. </s>
<s> That's not something I've seen work and I don't see in the manual such a setup. </s>
<s> That bridge can be done any number of ways. </s>
<s> Since I an not your network architect I can't offer much more than I've done more than a few bridges. </s>
<s> For an example, you could VPN into that other network and then do that backup. </s>
<s> Break the VPN and you're back on your LAN. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was originally hoping to use Firewire, since I thought it would be easier. </s>
<s> To be honest, the simpler the setup the better. </s>
<s> I consider my self pretty knowledgeable about computers, but when it comes to networking, nothing seems to work for me. </s>
<s> Is there any simpler way? </s>
<s> Perhaps I could connect my Mac to both networks? </s>
<s> I know very little about your networks. </s>
<s> Ask the person who designed yours for how to do the bridge or VPN from one to another. </s>
<s> As to connecting to both networks, did you try it? </s>
