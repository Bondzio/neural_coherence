I am ruuning Windows Vista home premium. My question is will I have to re-load Windows Vista? I upgraded to Vista from XP and only have the upgrade DVD and not the full version. The price for the hardware is not an issue, but if I have to pay $250 for the full version of Vista that then becomes a problem Thanks Wayne

I recently moved my XP hardrive from an old machine to a different mainboard, cpu, ram and psu due to a mainboard failure. XP detected a significant change in hardware and made me reactivate. But that only takes a few moments.

My son just told me that he and my grandkids are buying me the full version of Vista Ultimate for Christmas and beings I won't be doing the upgrade until after the holidays there is no problem now. Thanks again Wayne
