first computer was a &quot;kapro&quot;, at a lumber yard, who ever sold the unit to the company for estimating purposes didn't know lumber, so they assigned numbers to the sizes, when the sizes themselves were numbers, always needed 6 digits, 2x4x8 could have been 000248, but instead it was an off the wall number.
the time the computer saved was more than used up by the need not only to memorize, but to have someone go over work carefully.
company also had an ibm mainframe, it had it's own &quot;very large office&quot;, people did shifts because it was so cold in that room.
