some more additional info... if i go into system then hardware profiles, it says something to the extent of &quot;drive a is using ms-dos compatibility mode file system&quot;, but won't let me open drive a: in ms-dos mode.
this is why i think that an external fdd (pcmcia) is not considered as a drive.
