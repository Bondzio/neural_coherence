<s> Hi - my printer was connected to my home wireless network just fine until recently. </s>
<s> I decided to change my network SSID and Network Key to something more easily remembered and now my printer will not connect to the network. </s>
<s> I keep getting error TS-05 that the SSID and/or password are not matching. </s>
<s> My old network was using a 64 bit HEX key which had a 10 digit password in HEX. </s>
<s> When I first changed it, I went to ASCII 64 bit which used a 5 digit password. </s>
<s> When that did not work I tried ASCII 128 bit with a 13 digit password but again that did not work. </s>
<s> Then I went back to HEX 64 bit with a 10 digit password but that is still not working. </s>
<s> The other change I made as to change the SSID from some generic 5 digit code (LZST3) to a new one (MulnoFamily). </s>
<s> All of my other devices have been able to connect to each of the above network changes just fine. </s>
<s> this is multiple laptops, iPad and Android tablets, etc. </s>
<s> None of those have any issue with any of the changes I have made. </s>
<s> Only the Brother printer is not talking any longer. </s>
<s> any help on this? </s>
<s> I should add, although I do not think it matters - my computer is a Windows Vista computer. </s>
<s> But again, I am trying to connect this wireless directly - like it was before. </s>
<s> It's another reason I move to WPA2. </s>
<s> ok - I ended up resetting the modem back to factory settings which put back the SSID and password. </s>
<s> that allowed it to work again. </s>
<s> I then changed just the password and the printer was still able to reconnect. </s>
<s> So - I am not sure if it did not like the SSID I was trying to use or if something else happened but I can live with the weird SSID but a password that works for me. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone. </s>
