1.1.1	I recently acquired a fairly old 40 gb hard drive which connects using a wide ribbon IDE cable.	St
1.1.2	I opened my dell computer, and found that it has no such thing.	St
1.1.3	The only things using a ribbon of any kind are the CD/floppy drives, but those ribbons are less wide, and don't fit.	St
1.1.4	The newer hard drive connects using some really thin blue cable and a power cord.	St
1.1.5	Is there some type of cable that will convert the thin blue cord to a wide ribbon IDE cable?	St
1.2.1	You probably need something like this: http://www.cooldrives.com/sata-adapters.html	St
1.3.1	Is most probably a SATA connection which is generally standard on newer motherboards	St
1.4.1	Okay, so, since it's SATA then (as the other guy mentioned) will I need to set up a master/slave thing, or do I just have to buy a separate cord?	St
1.4.2	Because those prices are NOT reasonable if I also have to buy the cord, since this hard drive is only 40 gb.	St
1.5.1	Could you please tell your motherboard model or your dell model so that we can be more helpful?	Sug
1.6.1	those aren't necessarily the best prices.	St
1.6.2	just a link that showed a few different adaptors.	St
1.6.3	I bought one for about $20 which allowed you to connect the drive to your pc via the usb port - all cables and power supplies included, nice and easy.	St
