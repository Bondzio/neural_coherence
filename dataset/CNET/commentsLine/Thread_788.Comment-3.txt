yes, it was that easy.
i know, because i did this before.
there was a certain folder in the registry that you deleted, then when you re-installed the hd it picked up everything again, the controllers, the video, the nic, the hd ... you get the idea.
similar to the roll-back feature, but not exactly.
the machine is a 815e chipset and i need it to go into a system with a 440bx chipset.
