It's supposed to be solid green. The mouse doesn't work. I have tried cleaning the gold contacts but so far that hasn't worked.

I also might try adjusting the metal coils inside the case so that there is a tighter fit with the batteries' contacts. Also I might clean the gold contacts with a little dab of vinegar on a cotton swab.
