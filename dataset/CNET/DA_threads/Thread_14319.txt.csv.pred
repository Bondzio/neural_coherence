1.1.1	Hello...	St
1.1.2	I have a Gateway keyboard such as this one: http://www.oemliquidators.com/images/catalog/7003331.jpg I also have a cat, and she sheds... a LOT.	St
1.1.3	I was wondering where I could get one of those keyboard protectors like those at doctor offices, cafeterias, and the like.	St
1.1.4	Basically, a plastic mold that sits on top of the keys and doesn't allow entry of liquids, hair, or dirt.	St
1.1.5	I don't think those extra buttons on top of the keyboard (view the picture linked above) should be a problem, even for a standard protector...	St
1.1.6	I could probably cut that out, or something.	St
1.1.7	Suggestions?	St
1.1.8	Thanks...	St
1.2.1	on keyboard protectors gives a ton of options and vendors.	St
