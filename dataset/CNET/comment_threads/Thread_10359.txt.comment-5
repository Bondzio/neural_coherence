Hi there, sorry if this is in the wrong section but im new to this forum business lol; i bought an LG HDTV 32LG5700 today along with an LG RHT387H HDD/DVD recorder with 1080p upscaling plus an HDMI cable to connect them with.
i set them up along with my Sky box as instructed and everything worked fine up until i tried to test out a dvd, i selected the HDMI port that the player was connected to the tv with and i got a picture, but when i try to play a dvd or even try to go to the player's options menu the tv switches to the other HDMI port it has built in and says 'no signal' which is no surprise since i only have the one HD device connected up, when i switch the cable over to the other hdmi port and try again the tv does exactly the same thing but in reverse, if you know what i mean... funnily enough when i connect the HDD/DVD player up with a regular SCART cable everything works as it should... is there a problem with the tv or am i missing something???
if anyone needs extra info just ask and i'll try my best to accomodate.
thanks
