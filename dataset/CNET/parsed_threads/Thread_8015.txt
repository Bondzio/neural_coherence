<s> I accidentally deleted an NTFS partition using fdisk. </s>
<s> Are there any good software programs/utilities that can recoved a deleted partition? </s>
<s> I'm not looking for just a freeware utiility. </s>
<s> I'm willing to spend the money and purchase a program just as long as it works. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> specific problem. </s>
<s> No backup ??? </s>
<s> And you just deleted the partition ...the only partition on the drive ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> now, ur situation isn't hopeless. </s>
<s> since u're ready to pay(actually, i don't know free one) i'd recommend u Disk Director by Acronis. </s>
<s> it has Acronis Partition Recovery feature, that will most likely solve ur problem. </s>
<s> Anyway if something goes wrong (e.g.Disk Director won't recover ur deleted partition) u can get ur money back within 30 days. </s>
<s> http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/diskdirector/ good luck be sure to tell us about results </s>
<s> the data off the HDD ??? </s>
<s> Wouldn't it make sense to 'clone' the drive before using DD to recover the partition ? </s>
