<s> I have built my own computer and am having some trouble with something. </s>
<s> Im not sure if the BIOS is wrong or what but when I power up the computer after about a day of not being used, I check the temperature of the CPU in BIOS and it always says 113 degrees F.After a while I will go back into the BIOS and check it again, of course since it has been running for a while the temp has gone up some. </s>
<s> My question,is the BIOS temp wrong? </s>
<s> The fan speeds seem to be reading right and everything else in the BIOS seems to be right.Why does the temp read 113 when the CPU is cold?Also it says system temp 95 degrees but inside the case seems more cool than my house @ around 78 degrees. </s>
<s> My system: Intel Celeron 2.8Ghz 768 MB DDR Windows XP Home(for now) ATI Radeon 9600 Graphics Card 1 Intake fan (Cool Master 80x80x25mm) 1 Outtake fan (Same as above) 1 Extra fan just in case (same as above) 1 CPU Fan with heat sink (Zalman 109x109x62mm 2400RPM) Thermal Paste that came with CPU Fan was applied 120Gig HD </s>
<s> You didn't note the power supply size or the motherboard make/model and finally no words if you updated the BIOS. </s>
<s> Your post didn't tell all. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The mother board is a Abit IC7-G Socket 478 Power Supply is 300W I also updated the BIOS from the MB website to the newest version. </s>
<s> Look at http://www.tomshardware.com about power supplies. </s>
<s> The other issue can be the board's does not support this CPU. </s>
<s> Maybe I missed it, but what was the make/model board? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> First off, I agree with Robert, 300W isn't enough for what you have even if its working now. </s>
<s> Sooner or later considering the installed devices it'll probably come back to haust you. </s>
<s> Next, I just checked my own system and 116F is shown on mine or 48C. </s>
<s> It should heat-up upon being used and more if intensely used. </s>
<s> I wouldn't sweat it for now, provided all cooling is proper and such. </s>
<s> so enjoy. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> How hight should I go? </s>
<s> Is there such thing as too much power? </s>
<s> The PC will only draw what it needs. </s>
<s> Even cheap 450W supplies are in the 20 dollar range. </s>
<s> You are pressing your luck with 300, but I really would like to know the make/model motherboard since I just came across one that only did up to some 2.0 GHz Celeron. </s>
<s> While the 2.4GHz Celeron did appear to run, it was unstable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Im currently using MB made by ABIT and the model is IC7-G and when I went to ABIT's website to check the CPU compatability it said the Intel Celeron was compatable but only up to 2.4Ghz. </s>
<s> The reason I put this CPU in this MB is because the guy at a computer store here said it would work in it. </s>
<s> So also wondering is the high temp due to the fact the MB doesnt fully support this speed on this CPU? </s>
<s> If so will it hurt the CPU or MB? </s>
<s> I will only be using CPU til after Christmas maybe not even that long.Also what things am I pressing my luck with using a 300w? </s>
<s> The CPU was originaly in a HP with a 250W. </s>
<s> Hang ups, random reboots, freezes and in the worst case some failure of the PSU or motherboard. </s>
<s> I think you found your issue. </s>
<s> The motherboard doesn't support that CPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok now I have got a P4 2.8ghz with HT and it is supported by the MB. </s>
<s> Now it starts out at 130 degrees. </s>
<s> Is this normal for a HT CPU? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
