the computer is an amalgam of three or four computers, and to be honest i don't remember the specifics.
i can access them and post them, but everything was working fine until that cd-rw went in.
i am going to take the ide cable out and put in a newer one, and if that doesn't work, i will set both jumpers to cs and let the computer figure out what is what.
thanks for the (generic, your word) information.
i appreciate your time and effort in helping with this issue.
