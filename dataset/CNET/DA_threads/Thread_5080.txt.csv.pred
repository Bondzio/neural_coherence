1.1.1	I installed Windows 98 once, and it didn't work.	St
1.1.2	Anyway, I was able to start up in Safe Mode, and I had something like 5.8 GB of space on that computer's hard drive.	St
1.1.3	I decided to re-install.	St
1.1.4	I made a boot disk, and typed FDISK to re-partion my hard drive.	St
1.1.5	I deleted by old partitions, and made a new one.	St
1.1.6	When it asked if I wanted to use the maximum space for my partion, I hit yes.	St
1.1.7	It said 508 MB.	St
1.1.8	I figured something was wrong, so I restarted, and did the process of FDISK over.	St
1.1.9	This time, instead of clicking yes to the maximum, I just set the value of space to be used on the partion I wanted (in percent) to 99%.	St
1.1.10	It came out as like 500 MB.	St
1.1.11	What happened!?	St
1.1.12	It's like my hard drive was randomly reduced to 1/10 the size!	St
1.1.13	Any ideas?	St
1.1.14	My first thought was that the hard drive was shot, but I later proceeded to install Windows 98 on it, so I fail to see how only 90% of it was ruined... Any suggestions as to where to go would be helpful.	St
1.1.15	Thanks, GarciaOwens By the way, I'm 100% sure that my hard drive -was- very near 6 GB, so it's not just be seeing things or something.	St
1.2.1	i also notice that when bought my first hard drive it ranges around 160 gig.	St
1.2.2	but after a couple of months i was infected with a unknown virus so i decided to reformat my pc but after i reformat it, install os and drivers i checked my my computer properties and ive noticed that my hard drive lost some of its volume.	St
1.2.3	it was not some for me but it was a more gig capacity which was i lost and then i asked someone who knows more about computer than me and he said every time i reformat a pc it automatically lose some space.	St
1.2.4	please note that this is just my opinion and others might not agree w/ me so i suggest you to ask for second and third opinions.	Sug
1.2.5	thanks hope this will provide you much ideas.	Polite
1.3.1	I think FDISK reports it as 500 megs even when it's bigger.	St
1.3.2	Why don't you download a disk utility from your drive's manufacturer and use that instead?	St
1.3.3	They work much better than old FDISK and FORMAT, much quicker and are more updated, give more accurate info.	St
1.4.1	Let's hope they figured it out.	St
