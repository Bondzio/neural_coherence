I don't really care for the Windows print feature on XP, seems to be hit or miss with my other pcs on the network at times. I would like to know if I can connect the printer directly to the network router port. I understand there are USB to ethernet adapters, will this assign an IP from the router that other PC's can use as a network printer, or do I need to get a mini print server? Also, the printer port is the type B square USB connection, while most convertors have a type A to LAN. Do they sell a type B unit?

USB-A or -B doesn't matter because you can purchase whatever cable you need. There are wired and wireless print server models. It's best to purchase a print server that is known to work with your printer model.
