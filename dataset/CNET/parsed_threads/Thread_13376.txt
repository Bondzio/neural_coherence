<s> My brand new Asus G75 laptop won't recognize my Western Digital 1TB external hard drive. </s>
<s> It works in my friend's almost identical laptop, and my laptop is correctly recognizing other usb inputs. </s>
<s> The hard drive spins when plugged in, but the led on the exterior of the drive doesn't come on. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure it isn't showing up in device manager or disk management. </s>
<s> I've also tried all the ports. </s>
<s> I think I read somewhere that some driver updates can screw up the usb's, but the problem only comes up with this hard drive. </s>
<s> Here are where I've looked for it: http://imgur.com/PR6oU http://imgur.com/TQN6a http://imgur.com/t6rfk </s>
<s> Things to try: 1. </s>
<s> Use the laptop with the power adapter. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Use an Y-USb-cable (two connectors, one extra for power) 3. </s>
<s> Use a powered hub in between. </s>
<s> The combination of #2 and #3 should work, but maybe one of them is enough already. </s>

<s> You shouldn't need any drivers for your setup to work. </s>
<s> It should be recognized from the USB port once connected as the OS supplies the necessary acknowledgement. </s>
<s> Adding to what Kees has already stated, be 100% sure the USB ports of your laptop are actually enabled. </s>
<s> If you installed any s/w to correct, remove or uninstall its not needed. </s>
<s> Since, you didn't mention what OS was being used, I assume its Win7. </s>
<s> Also, I assume the laptop itself was properly all updated for use to its latest, to include the OS and mtrbd. </s>
<s> drivers and possibility bios as well. </s>
<s> As for s/w installed, I exclude what maybe WD bundle supplied for better use of the ext. </s>
<s> HD, NOT as a driver. </s>

<s> Is the the power adapter for the external hard drive plugged in? </s>
<s> Hi, did you get any solution to the above problem mentioned? </s>
<s> I need a solution as i am facing the exact same issue.. WD 1TB drive and ASUS g75 laptop. </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/7726-7591_102-5327032.html?tag=posts;msg5327032 I find many are looking a solution that does not involve any changes. </s>
