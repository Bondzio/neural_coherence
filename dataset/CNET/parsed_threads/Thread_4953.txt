<s> a while ago i built a comp with 2x256mb sticks of pc2700 ram (making it 512). </s>
<s> because the motherboard supports pc3200 ram, i decided to get a 512mb stick of pc3200 ram (because it's cheap) to add to the comp. </s>
<s> however, instead of showing up as 1 gb of ram, which it should, it only shows up 768mb of ram. </s>
<s> can someone please tell me why? </s>
<s> also, these are the specs: Athlon 64 3200+ cpu 80 gb hard drive gigabyte k8u-939 mobo </s>
<s> Your RAM must be installed in pairs, I do believe. </s>
<s> Way to tell..if you have four (4) memory slots..two black and two blue. </s>
<s> If you have only three (3) slots then one of your 256 sticks is probably bad or, if you move it, not seated correctly. </s>
<s> If the latter, remove and reintall. </s>
<s> Did it show 512 before you put in the 512? </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> ok that's probably why. </s>
<s> i have 4 slots. </s>
<s> and yea before installing the 512 it did show 512. ok thank you. </s>
<s> when i get a new 512 stick then i'm guessing the missing 256 will show up again? </s>
