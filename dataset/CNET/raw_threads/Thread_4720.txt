I need to be able to &quot;connect&quot; these two computers for the purpose of sharing drives. I know all about Remote Desktop. This is not what I'm looking for. If I'm logged onto Computer A, I need for Computer B's disk resources to be viewable and accessible through the standard Windows Explorer as remote drives. I've already: 1. unblocked TCP and UDP ports 135 through 139, and 445 in the firewall on both computers. 2. completely disabled the router's firewall (one of the computers is hooked into a router; firewall has been disabled) 3. forwarded the relevant ports (noted above) in the router's config to the computer I would like to access. ... no joy. When I try to connect to the remote PC, it comes up not found. I can ping it, and I can connect via remote desktop (so I also know port forwarding on the router is working). But the standard &quot;net use&quot; and &quot;net view&quot; stuff is not working. I am suspecting my ISPs (on either the east coast or west coast) are filtering the &quot;file and print sharing&quot; ports (i.e. TCP + UDP 135 through 139 and 445), but trying to get a hold of someone at either ISP who knows about this stuff is impossible. Does anyone have any experience with Comcast (West Coast) and Cablevision (East Coast), in terms of whether or not they filter traffic through these ports ? ... or, does anyone have any other solutions ? Again, I don't want to use remote desktop. It's not practical for this purpose, and I don't want to set up an FTP server. It needs to be a clean, simple solution that allows me (and my family) to see and access each computer's drives just as the local ones. I really appreciate any assistance, but PLEASE don't offer advice about the inherent security risks of trying to do what it is I'm trying to do. I am well aware of the risks and would prefer to keep this to a technical discussion rather than an advice post on the risks of file and print sharing over the internet. Many thanks
