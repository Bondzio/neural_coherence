1.1.1	I want to know if my system performance will be maximized by having: 2 Gb of DDR PC3200 DDR400 2.6V 128Meg x 64 or 3 Gb of DDR PC2700 DDR333 2.5V 128Meg x 72 ?	Ques
1.1.2	Would like to make the right upgrade decision for my system (COPU is AMD Athlon 64 3400+ at 2.2 Ghz on MSI K8T Neo Motherboard (model MS-6702 ATX mainboard) Kevin Byrnes	St
1.2.1	unless you edit very large images/videos or use this PC as a server, 2gb should be more than adequate.	St
1.2.2	your motherboard supports dual channel operation so you should always use 2 or 4 dimms for best performance.	St
1.2.3	a pair of ddr-333 dimms in dual channel mode will outperform a single ddr-400 dimm.	St
1.2.4	some motherboards slow down to ddr-333 if all 4 slots are populated.	St
1.2.5	if you've 512MB (or less) using 2 DDR-333 dimmis, replace both and get 2 1GB DDR-400 dimms.	St
1.2.6	if you have one or more 512MB DDR-333 dimms, get additional 512MB DDR-333 dimms to reach 2GB.	St
1.3.1	2GB of PC3200 (DDR400) RAM in dual channel mode wins.	St
1.3.2	That's two 1GB modules.	St
1.3.3	Why?	St
1.3.4	400MHz is faster than 333MHz and not very many Windows XP users ever use more than 2GB.	St
1.3.5	Make sure you check with the motherboard specs or Crucial.com to make sure you are selecting the right RAM (the PC2700 looks like ECC ram and that's not necessary).	St
1.4.1	Not only is the 400 faster, but if you ever decide to upgrade from there, you'll already be running the faster RAM.	St
1.4.2	I always install the fastest RAM the motherboard will support	St
1.5.1	Just to agree with all.	St
1.5.2	Allways get the fastest mem MB will support.	St
1.5.3	Adding one more gig of ram may help very specific graphics software if you are editing large photos or videos especially.	St
1.5.4	Other than that save up for 2 more of the faster chips	St
1.6.1	It depends on your needs.	St
1.6.2	I don't think you will se difference between 2 and 3GB or RAM in windows if you are not working with large real-time video or smth like that.	St
1.6.3	If i had to choose, a take 2GB of faster RAM.	St
