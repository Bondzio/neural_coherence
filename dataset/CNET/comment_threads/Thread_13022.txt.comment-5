Any transmitting antenna can provide gain on a transmitted signal over a standard groundplane antenna.
Gain antennas such as a Yagi Beam most certainly will offer the advantage of increasing the strength of a transmission.
This is the reason why TV and Radio stations use a variety of antennas to increase the effective radiaion power of their stations.
It's not a thermodynamic principle it's a basic principle of radio transmissions.
If you study radio theory, I think you'll find that what I'm saying is true.
