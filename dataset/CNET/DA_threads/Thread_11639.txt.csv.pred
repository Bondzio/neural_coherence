1.1.3	Here is what i got : arctic silver ceramique thermal paste AMD athlon xp barton 2.1ghz Asus a7n8x-e deluxe nforce2 mobo 2 bars of corsair 512MB DDR pc 3200 thermaltake silentboost cpu fan ATI all in wonder radeon 9600 seagate 160gb SATA hard drive 7200RPM western digital 40gb hard drive I run on windows 98SE only ...	St
1.1.4	So first thing i noticed is that i cant have a drive any larger than 135GB because of 98..	St
1.1.5	yay ! ...	St
1.1.6	I had to partition and i still have about 30gigs unaccounted for that i CANT use , any suggestions about that are welcome..	St
1.1.7	Here are my issues though : 1 .	St
1.1.8	I cant recall what programs they were but two of them showed my processor as 1.3 & 1.4 Ghz only !	St
1.1.9	This seems kind of true because it takes about 3 minutes to load windows sometimes more ( longer than w/ my old 1ghz thunderbird ) and also many applications dont show the impact of my processor being twice as fast now .	St
1.1.10	2 .	St
1.1.11	I get system hangups when the processor led is not blinking but there is something going on in the background 3 .	St
1.1.12	Extremely slow transfer from hard drive to hard drive .	St
1.1.13	If i move around 10gigs or more , i usually get an auto system reboot eventually ...	St
1.1.14	When i leave my pc on overnight to encode dvds ill usually wake up to a reset pc and an invalid/crashed file I was really expecting win98 to be on crack w/ this new configuration that it was probably not made to ever witness but instead im very disappointed that such an optimal setup could be so slow , i know something has to be wrong here .	St
1.1.15	I 've tested my pc w/ the new warhammer demo and i was able to run it on full config with only some frame hits , i also can now run the highly demanding AVS plugin for winamp in fullscreen which i could barely use in half screen before .	St
1.1.16	My corsair memory IS reporting correctly at about 1.2ghz .	St
1.1.17	I have not been able to go online and update drivers but i will eventually do that , that might be a problem .	St
1.1.18	Please give me some advice .	Sug
