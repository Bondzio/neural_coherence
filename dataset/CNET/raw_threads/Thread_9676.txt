But he only has a PCIE-1x slot available as well as a regular PCI slot. Is there any way to install the PCIE-16x card with an adapter or something? If not, what would be a good cheap PCI or PCIE-1x card to install? I'm mostly looking to play games released in the past few years like Doom 3, Half Life 2, and BF 2142 with good performance. Preferably a card with at least 256mb. He has a Dell E310 with 2.8 ghz, 1gb RAM, Win XP. And his psu is only 230w. He has an integraded Intel(R) 82915G/GV/910GL video card. The PCIE-16x cards that I have considered are the Ati X800XL 256 mb or the Ati X1950 Pro 256. I know he would need a higher wattage psu for the X1950, if not both. Anyway, thanks for any help. Josh

Read reviews at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103031 It's not much faster than a fx5200 so keep shopping. The card I noted should done much better. Why isn't that an option. If you can find a fx5700 in PCI form I'll write it's nice for games prior to 2006. Bob

But there's an x1550 512 x1 card on Newegg that I found: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161079 Any thoughts on that one? I'll check out the fx5700. Thanks a lot. Josh
