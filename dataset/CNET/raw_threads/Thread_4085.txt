Plugged it in using a 300 W power supply, and nothing happened. Tried a different power supply (400W) and, when i plugged in, the CPU fan twitched..then nothing. Tried yet another power supply (one im positive works because its powering the computer im using to type this, but only 250W ) and back to nothing. I feel like I'm grabbing at straws but that little Cpu fan twitch makes me hesitant to throw the mobo out. Can anyone remove all doubt for me/have suggestions on other things to try? thanks in advance -bj-

To test that the motherboard is not the issue, I take the power supply and the board out on a piece of cardboard and with no CPU, RAM or any other parts power it up. If it doesn't power up, it's the board or PSU. Bob

Quick check...Review the manual/helpguide and verify the frt. panel power sw. is actaully on the right connection. Usually a 2-pin connection it can mistaken or misunderstood labeling and thus &quot;no go&quot; when sw. is pushed. Further, you can momentarily touch the pin contacts to act as sw. to see if starts then, bad sw. maybe or wrong connector used(remote?) As for fan twitch, a power surge can do that, a good quality p/s unit locks that down. good luck -----Willy
