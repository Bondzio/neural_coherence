I have been having constant &quot;hardware&quot; bluscreen events. My supplier has changed everything but the box, 3.5 disc reader and card reader yet this problem still occurs. If you Google &quot;bluescreen Vista&quot; it seems it is a common problem, with several advertisers offering quick fixes? Microsoft will not help as it is not a problem they will admit to. How do I make me computer reliable? Thanks and regards dunlor

I ran out and purchaed the Windows Vista Home upgrade the day it came out. So far, the only issues that I've had are compatibility issues (drivers, software, etc). I've not had any blue screen events, no error messages, nothing like that. I've restored Media Center a couple of times, but I always go back to Vista. I like the way it looks, and my computer seems to boot up faster. Sounds like your issues could be the computer itself, out of the box.
