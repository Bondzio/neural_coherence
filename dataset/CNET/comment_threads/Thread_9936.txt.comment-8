Im currently using MB made by ABIT and the model is IC7-G and when I went to ABIT's website to check the CPU compatability it said the Intel Celeron was compatable but only up to 2.4Ghz.
The reason I put this CPU in this MB is because the guy at a computer store here said it would work in it.
So also wondering is the high temp due to the fact the MB doesnt fully support this speed on this CPU?
If so will it hurt the CPU or MB?
I will only be using CPU til after Christmas maybe not even that long.Also what things am I pressing my luck with using a 300w?
The CPU was originaly in a HP with a 250W.
