my printer has suddenly decided to cut off items that i print from the internet or emails.
sometimes it's just the first couple of letters on the left side, other times it can be 3 to 5 words on the left side.
i don't know why it is doing this and i have tried and checked everything i can think of to get it to print everything.
there must be something i'm overlooking and if anyone can help me i'd sure appreciate it!
i use windows 98 on an ibm clone.
