ok, thanks, ray.
point taken about checking and double-checking, then checking once again.
here is as much as i can tell you: o/s win 2k i have changed no jumper settings at all.
i have changed no motherboard connections at all my (physical) top drive is a dvd-rom (samsung dvd-rom st-616t).
next is my cd writer/reader (hl-dt-st cd-rw 8400b).
both of these are on the same cable, alone, with no others, and both are jumpered on the first setting.
fd is on its own cable alone.
i have tried putting everything back the way it was, but that did not work.
im at the stage now, that i wanted to be.
dvd-rom, cd writer/reader and fd all in, and no zip drive.
(the zip drive was on the same cable as the hd, and was jumpered as a slave) i dont think there is anything else i can tell you, except that: the hd is 74.5gb, of which 19.8 gb is free.
the details that i can make out are maxtor 6l080j4 this is working absolutely fine.
the bios is reading the a: drive correctly.
i have tried leaving a disk in all 3 drives when rebooting.
to add to the conundrum, this is what happens on startup, if i leave disks in the drives.
the a: drive does not read at all.
the dvd and the cd drives will do a listing (i can get at *.txt files on both, but i cannot play a cd/dvd).
now, if i remove the cd and the dvd disks that i left in on reboot, and put them back in, i get the error message i was talking about - the disk in drive ?
is not formatted.
do you want to format it now?
whenever i try to use any of them.
so, it is now happening on all 3 drives.
regards squiggles
