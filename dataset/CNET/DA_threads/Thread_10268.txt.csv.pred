1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Latest firmware all around .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	From the fab http : //www.usbman.com I agree that it could be a power management issue .	St
1.2.5	Yes , this is not USB , but ... Bob	St
1.3.1	I might move the router upstairs and run a CAT5 line down to the basement to see if that improves the signal .	Sug
1.3.2	I have a client with a similar setup and the router move upstairs solved the connection issue .	St
1.3.3	It seems even the G standard is limited by environmental factors .	St
1.4.1	Latest Firmware was the first thing I applied when it could not connect .	St
1.4.2	Moving router was not a preferred alternative .	St
1.4.3	He thinks that Linksys should have a proper working product a non- fully functioning product .	St
1.4.4	I have a 802.11b Linksys in my basement at home and my WiFi Laptop can connect even when I am in my bedroom on the second floor .	St
1.4.5	Though the signal is around 20~30 % the connection never disconnects !	St
1.5.1	What is not told to everyone is that no rigourous testing is performed on every card or device in order to cut production costs .	St
1.5.2	Every once in awhile you 'll find a bad card or device in the field .	St
1.5.3	On your part you will try the networking within a few feet to make sure that the parts are dead and then begin the exchange process .	Sug
1.5.4	The testing of the product may work OK in the factory , but that was many months ago some thousands of miles away .	St
1.5.5	This is n't an excuse for a defect , but it shows up as stories we read here .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	I seem to recall reading somewhere that & quot ; G & quot ; has high data transfer but short range .	St
1.6.2	Could this be the problem ?	Ques
1.6.3	Linksys ' Tech said there could also be interference from Microwave & cordless phones .	St
1.6.4	But the cordless phone is in a different location and the microwave is also quite a distance away .	St
1.6.5	If such is the case then this product is not ready for the market ?	Ques
1.6.6	I have recommended that he return the product to the store !	St
1.7.1	& quot ; I seem to recall reading somewhere that & quot ; G & quot ; has high data transfer but short range .	St
1.7.2	Could this be the problem ? & quot ; I 'll write no .	St
1.7.3	The distance I 'm seeing is the same .	St
1.7.4	But one situation is unlike another , but 20 feet even with a floor is usually OK unless it 's some concrete floor which can have a metal layer in it .	St
1.7.5	& quot ; Linksys ' Tech said there could also be interference from Microwave & cordless phones .	St
1.7.6	But the cordless phone is in a different location and the microwave is also quite a distance away .	St
1.7.7	If such is the case then this product is not ready for the market ? & quot ; Again , I 'll write no .	St
1.7.8	Far too many success stories and if the situation was this dire , retailers would have already removed the products from the shelves .	St
1.7.9	Did you notice how short those tablet PC 's showed up ?	Ques
1.7.10	Bob	St
1.8.1	I recommend returning it as well .	St
1.8.2	I 've got the Linksys G setup in an almost impossible house to try and get a wireless system to work .	St
1.8.3	& quot ; G & quot ; has high data transfer AND long range .	St
1.8.4	I think I was lucky .	Polite
1.8.5	I bought a Linksys G router and wireless notebook card and it worked flawlessly out of the box .	St
1.8.6	However , I suggested a friend try it .	St
1.8.7	He needed to return it .	St
1.8.8	Also be advised the Linksys customer service help is inept .	St
1.8.9	I had to call three times to get an answer on possibly upgrading the router .	St
