1.2.1	So it does not show in My Computer ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	Not sure why it shows in Disk Mgt if this problem , but in your original computer it was probably the Master and yuu 're now using it as a slave .	St
1.2.3	The new one is probably using cable select and the new 80 conductor cable , so try setting the jumper on the old drive to cable select , and connect to the grey [ gray ? ? ]	Ques

1.3.1	This is quite frequently caused by using a 3rd party partitioning program to allow large drives to be recognized by older computers .	St
1.3.2	If you used Disk Manager or EZ Drive to partition the drive then you need to run that software to get the data recognized .	St
1.3.3	Best bet in those cases is to network the old drive from the original system to the new one and copy the files over the network .	St
1.3.4	Then wipe the drive out completely ( repartition ) if you want to use it with XP .	St
1.4.1	Okay my dad had a similar problem .	St
1.4.2	The HD has to be in NTFS format not FAT for windows XP to recognize it .	St
1.4.3	You also have to install the latest drivers for your particular hard drive- which was his problem .	St
1.4.4	Once you do that , you should be able to restart your computer and the hard drive should be recognized .	St
1.4.5	I assume then you can delete windows 98 se if you have n't already from your computer .	St
