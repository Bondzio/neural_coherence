4245	0	101568	1165748	NR	oiptoner	5/2/05 8:33 AM	1.11502278E12	No Wave Devices	Have two older Pionex systems which I am trying to rehab for use in a child care center. Everything is now working fine except that I do not have sound. Original OS was corrupted so I loaded WIN98 on all three systems. One unit is 266Mhz, the other 350 Mhz. I believe both have Cyrix processors. One unit appears to have an onboard sound chip while the other has a PCI sound card. I have replaced the sound card with a new one. On both systems if I try to load a game I get the same error message: &quot;WAVEOUTGETNUMDEVS---NO WAVE DEVICES----OK&quot; If I click OK the game loads but there is no sound. I have deleted &quot;Sound Controllers&quot; in System Devices and reloaded the drivers but no luck. Can someone help? Jeff

I did not wipe the hard drive clean before the install so shouldn't the MOBO drivers still be loaded? Why would this only affect the WAVE Devices and nothing else?

Microsoft does NOT install all needed drivers and the Driver Update button is little more than a demo of how good things could be. Just wondering. Since Windows 98 has been around for 7+ years, how could we avoid learning about the drivers? Bob

What you say makes sense, but us common folk don't work with computers all the time and we certainly don't get into code and the inner workings of an OS. That's why we come on-line asking for help. Thanks for your help. I will search for the MOBO drivers and hopefully that will solve my problem.

Unfortunately, I scrapped out the old modems as the machines were never to be connected to the internet. Thus I can't use BELARC ADVISOR until I put a modem in. However, from looking at the board I can determine the following: First system is by Pionex, P-GXM266A-V2. It has one Cyrix chip labeled L2A0788; CX5520 and I am sure the CPU is a Cyrix. Bios is Award. MOBO also has the following stamped on it: M5CNB VER. 1.1. Second unit is also Pionex, P-CMII350B-V7. Cyrix M 2 350GP CPU chip with Award Bios. M5ATD Ver. 1.2 stamped on MOBO. Is this enough to go on? If not I will pick up a modem card and install.

So since you're on the net with your computer you can download it for free.....very small program. TONI

I have installed it on one machine and received the following info: Windows 98 Build 4.10.1998 Bios: Award 4.51 PG 07/17/98 Model: Pionex Processor: 267 Mhz Cyrix GXm 16 KB Cache Board: GXm-Cx5520 Bus Clock: 64 Mhz Is this enough? Second machine processor heat sink fan is bad so need to replace before I run Belarc.
