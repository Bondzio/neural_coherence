in or out of case?
i perform first boot out of case.
my acid test is to pull the memory.
this should produce no memory beep code.
if not reseat cpu - re-test - if no joy then your mb is dead.
if system responds - to test memory slots re-test w/ 1 stick of memory in each memory slot.
then with the other memory, tho here you only need to test once.
