i have a friend who calls me across the country on one.
he actually purchased five of them!
(all for his home).
he swears by the things but i often have trouble deciphering what he is saying when he talks, it is an odd type of distortion that i do not know how to describe.
kind of sounds as if the sound waves are passing through water at times.
other times, it works nearly flawlessly but i would not use it as a primary telephone service.
