1.1.1	Hello everyone , I just received the external hard drive & lt ; b & gt ; Iomega eGo Desktop Hard Drive , USB 2.0 , 1 TB & lt ; /b & gt ; today .	St
1.1.2	I am connecting this via USB to a MacBook running Mac OSX 10.4.11 with 2 GB of RAM , processor 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo .	St
1.1.3	I began transferring a group of files from my Mac 's built-in hard drive totalling about 34 gigs .	St
1.1.4	It was transferring fairly fast , it did n't specify the specific mb/s but it said there was about 38 minutes remaining for the transfer to be complete .	St
1.1.5	Then when about 12 gigs had been transferred , I opened up my Mac 's bluetooth application because I wanted to transfer some unrelated files to my iphone .	St
1.1.6	When I started searching for available bluetooth devices , my Mac completely froze up , could n't move the cursor , could n't attempt to force quit any applications , and the previous flashing light on the external hard drive went completely out .	St
1.1.7	I waited a few minutes for it to possibly work itself out but nothing happened , so I felt the only option was to turn the comp on and off using the power switch .	St
1.1.8	It booted up fine , and the external hard drive seemed unharmed and the 12 or so gigs of files that had been transferred already were on the disk playing perfectly .	St
1.1.9	So I then started to transfer the remaining files and this time the transfer speed had dropped dramatically to about 2 m/s .	St
1.1.10	It now said it would take 7 hours to transfer about 23 gigs of files .	St
1.1.11	I went into Mac 's Disk Utility program and tried to repair the drive , it said it did not need repairing .	St
1.1.12	So I then erased all the files on the drive hoping to reset it or something , however it is still transferring at the incredibly slow speed .	St
1.1.13	Is this external drive now completely damaged beyond repair because of having to shut down my computer unsafely ?	Ques
1.1.14	Is there any way to get back to that initial fast transfer rate ?	Ques
1.1.15	Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and I hope you have some insights .	St
1.2.1	After trying a bunch of different things , it turns out the slow transfer speed was actually due to my Mac 's hard drive , not the external one .	St
1.2.2	I freed up about 40 gigs of space on it and the transfer speed increased dramatically .	St
1.2.3	Yay .	St
