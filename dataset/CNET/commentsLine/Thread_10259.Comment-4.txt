since there is no make or model given and such drivers are for specific make and models you own.
while it's great that you use the rear ports, the mouse or such working is not at issue and is no indication the usb drives should work.
there are other possibilities but i like to start with what i see cure such most of the time.
can i ask why the make and model of the machine is unknown after so many years?
