<s> A similar drive worked fine in my old computer with WindowsXP, and I know it is working, but when I go into disc management to format the drive, the drive does not show up so I can begin the process. </s>
<s> I'm using a USB 2.0 cable. </s>
<s> We had a very long discussion about a Lacie compatibility issue. </s>
<s> It was not a hardware issue then but this does sound like a hardware issue. </s>
<s> Your post is a little short on details. </s>

<s> Hi Bob- I wasn't in on the compatibilty issue discussion you had about Lacie drives. </s>
<s> All I know is I have 4 of these Lacie Extreme 256gb drives and I have used one in my wife's Dell that has XP and used the same drive last year in my old computer with XP (and it worked) but it does NOT work in my new computer with WIndows7. </s>
<s> The Lacie drive turns on when I plug into my new computer with the 2.0 USB, it just does not show up when I get into the &quot;Disc Management&quot; mode so I cannot format it. </s>
<s> The new computer, an Antaeus, is a very fast and powerful machine with loads of memory and RAM and works like a champ on everything else. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks-- Dave </s>
<s> My first test is another machine. </s>
<s> Something like HP/Dell, etc with a factory load of 7. </s>
<s> I've run into too many built machines that have issues. </s>
<s> There's also some issues with USB 3.0 ports but I can't guess if that's a factor. </s>
<s> Since it does not show in Disk Management we look at the hardware. </s>
<s> And if it's some custom install of Windows we go over their install procedure. </s>

<s> I'll unplug it and try it in my Dell Windows7 laptop today. </s>
<s> Thanks, Bob! </s>
