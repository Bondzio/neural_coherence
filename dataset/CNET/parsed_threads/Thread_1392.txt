<s> I'm looking for an external hard drive for an early Intel iMac for general backup duties-nothing special. </s>
<s> Any recommendations&gt; Thanks, Tony </s>
<s> There are a number of alternatives available which will work happily with your machine. </s>
<s> You should be looking for an external drive with a Firewire (IEE1394) connection, rather than a USB one. </s>
<s> Firewire behaves well with the Mac and a Firewire drive is also capable of booting the Mac. </s>
<s> La Cie make a reasonable external but it is also possible to &quot;make your own&quot; Using a Firewire enclosure and an &quot;off the shelf&quot; ATA hard drive, you can be up and running with a large capacity external for a lot less than an already built one. </s>
<s> www.macsales.com have a selection of enclosures and your local BestBuy/Circuit City have regular sales offers for large drives. </s>
<s> Those two places also sell external drives but most of them are USB devices. </s>
