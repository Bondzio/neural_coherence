coryphaeus, i've done exactly what you said.
there is a hand under the c drive on both machines.
however, since the printer is only defined to one machine, i have this set up only on one machine.
when a attempt to add a printer and search the network, it finds the correct machine, but doesn't list the printer.
after doing some research, i noticed something.... when i'm on the machine with the printer, i can display the following: ipconfig: connection-specific dsn suffix .
: ip address...................... : 192.168.1.100 subnet mask..................... : 255.255.255.0 default gateway................. : 192.168.1.1 c: ping 192.168.1.101 (which is the other machine) pinging from 192.168.1.101: bytes=32 time..... but, from the other pc....here's what i get: ipconfig: connection-specific dsn suffix .
: ip address...................... : 192.168.1.101 subnet mask..................... : 255.255.255.0 default gateway................. : 192.168.1.1 c: ping 192.168.1.100 (which is the machine with the printer) pinging 192.168.1.100 with 32 bytes of data: request timed out.
request timed out... it seems one machine can get to the other, but the other cannot get back.
any ideas?
thanks, tom
