&quot;all I want to do is install the card in my computer, plug in the cable from the wall, and watch TV&quot; Not a single card works like that.
Every one of them required drivers, player software and more.
Not a single unit would do what you asked.
So right there you have found NOTHING ON THE MARKER will do what you asked.
The second problem is that some cableco's are going digital so only they can tell you if it would work.
Hint?
CABLE CARD!
