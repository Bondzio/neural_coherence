no, the dvd isn't showing up in the side bar when i open up the mac hd on my desk top.
i guess it's not mounting properly for some reason.
i'm usually pretty good at figuring out what's wrong with a computer when it isn't working properly.
i was thinking i might try reinstalling osx, but i don't like that because then i have to reinstall all the programs and updates i have.
