<s> Hi, I am planning to buy a LCD monitor (Dell SP2309W) as an add-on for my PC (HP Pavilion DV6700) which has NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS graphics card. </s>
<s> The native resolution of the LCD is 2048 x 1152. </s>
<s> I have a VGA output port on my laptop, but no HDMI/DVI. </s>
<s> Can my laptop handle this resolution on the LCD? </s>
<s> And should I buy a VGA-to-DVI adapter to improve the image quality on the LCD. </s>
<s> I don't wanna invest in the monitor only to find out that I cannot make use of the full resolution. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
