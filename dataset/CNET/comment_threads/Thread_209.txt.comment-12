Depending on what version of Quicken you have now and what you put on a new machine, this process can get complicated.
I don't think you're going to just be able to install that same Win 95 version in XP or higher anyway.
Unless the folks at Intuit have changed their ways, skipping too many upgrades left users unable to convert old data to the newer database formats that Quicken would use.
In any event, if you can get the data onto floppies, transferring that data is as simple as buying a USB floppy device as an accessory.
But, you're going to want to make sure that database conversion isn't going to be an issue.
