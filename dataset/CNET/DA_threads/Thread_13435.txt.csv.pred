1.1.1	I 'm a college student almost ready to begin my junior year .	St
1.1.2	I 'm also somewhat of a gaming enthusiast and would like very much to dive deeper into that hobby .	St
1.1.3	The catch is , for the past two years I 've been using an HP Pavillion notebook ( 1.8GHz Celeron , 40gig HD , 447mb RAM , Radeon IGP 340M ) .	St
1.1.4	It 's turned out to be a real workhorse and has kept up with me admirably , but it 's limits are now readily apparent .	St
1.1.5	Do n't get me wrong , it plays some of my favorite games ( Rainbow Six 3 , Star Trek : Bridge Commander , Grand Theft Auto : Vice City ) , but with newer titles like Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas , The Sims 2 and Half Life 2 , my hands are tied .	St
1.1.6	Space is also another issue .	St
1.1.7	I 've got a large MP3 collection , download mods for my games and occasionally I 'll download music videos/movies .	St
1.1.8	The space problem has gotten to the point where I recently had to go out and buy an 80gig portable hard drive .	St
1.1.9	I started computer shopping two months back , keeping important factors like price and expandability in mind .	St
1.1.10	Two weeks ago , I found the perfect machine ; an HP Pavillion ( a1034n ) with a 3GHz P4 , 200Gig Hard Drive , 1 Gig of Ram and a Multi Format DVD-ROM/CD-ROM drive .	St
1.1.11	Yesterday however , Best Buy pulled the machine from their lineup .	St
1.1.12	Now , I 'm forced to fall back onto my second choice .	St
1.1.13	It 's an HP Pavillion , with the same exact specs as the other machine , except this happens to be a 'Photosmart/Media Center ' PC ( mod .	St
1.1.14	m1264n ) .	St
1.1.15	http : //www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp ? product_code=320291 & pfp=BROWSE Barring any major financial disasters , I should have enough to get this within the next month-month and a half .	Ques
1.1.16	For moderate gaming plus day to day stuff ( word processing , internet etc . )	St
1.1.17	I 'm thinking this will be a pretty solid investment ( esp .	St
1.1.18	since I 'm on a somewhat limited budget ) , but what does everyone else think ?	Ques
1.1.19	Comments/Tips/Suggestions would be appreciated as well as comments from people who 've actually dealt with this model or similar ones like it = ) **Keep in mind , since I 'm looking to get deeper into gaming , I 'll definitly be upgrading the onboard video/audio setup**	St
1.2.1	Build your own if possible .	St
1.2.2	Do n't suggest it if possible , no pci-express i think , nor 64-bit .	St
1.2.3	Get the gateway http : //www.compusa.com/products/products.asp ? cmid=topnav & N=200005+400756+4294965871 & Ne=303930	St
1.3.1	the gpu .	St
1.3.2	it has integrated , which although it is possible to game on , ( check intels website and look for the compatability list ) you will not get very high frame rates .	St
1.3.3	it DOES have pcie so i would say get a nvidia 6600gt since you dont have to much money to spare .	St
1.3.4	it has a good cpu , good sata , 1GB of ram upgradeable to 4GB of DDR2 which is good .	St
1.3.5	everything is about media and music like you requested , so nice job picking a good machine .	St
1.3.6	just upgrade the gpu to 6600gt or higher and you will be gaming away .	St
1.3.7	konny	St
1.4.1	Sorry , but no pci-express slot http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? dlc=en & lc=en & product=471588 & dest_page=product & cc=us & docname=c00361570 .	St
1.4.2	Check out the one i recommended .	St
1.4.3	ROger	St
1.5.1	go with the gateway , upgrade the gpu to the card i recomended and you will have a 64 bit pc ready for the future of gaming .	Sug
1.5.2	konny	St
1.6.1	Okay , the lack of a PCI express slot bummed me out , but ahh well .	St
1.6.2	I went back to Best Buy 's website and found a Gateway that slightly outperformed that HP I was talking about .	St
1.6.3	The specs of this machine ( mod .	St
1.6.4	830GM ) are basically the same , except the P4 Processor uses Intel 's & quot ; EM64T & quot ; technology which basically means it 64-bit compatable .	St
1.6.5	It 's also slightly more expensive , but if this is indeed a good machine , than I think I 'll spring for it .	St
1.6.6	http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp ? skuId=7131089 & type=product & productCategoryId=cat01172 & id=1110263403701 And as for the graphics upgrade , I 'm either gon na go with an X850 XT P.E .	St
1.6.7	or a 6800 Ultra .	St
1.6.8	By the time I get enough money together ( months and months down the line ) , ATI & nVidia 's new chips should push the prices of those two I mentioned , down to a more reasonable level .	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	good pc , gateways support is superb .	Polite
1.8.2	you are right about the gpu prices falling , thats what im waiting for .	St
1.8.3	konny	St
1.9.1	I already recommended that in my first post ... Do n't think you can get much of a gfx update without a psu upgrade , and not sure if its propritary so might just get a 6600gt , nothing like the 6800ultra or other power consuming chips .	St
1.9.2	Roger	St
1.10.1	that power supply is 100 % atx compatable , it is the exact same mechanism used on the 820gm , e.g .	St
1.10.2	my pc which i upgraded to an antec true 480. so you are safe unlike dell konny	St
1.11.1	So you 're saying I 'll have to shell out an extra couple bucks for a higher wattage power source before I go and upgrade ?	Ques
1.11.2	If so , how high should I go ( to accomidate a high end card ) ? ?	Ques
1.11.3	?	Ques
1.12.1	anything higher than a nvidia geforce 6600gt will require a new power supply .	St
1.12.2	( 6800 series and 7800 series ) ati , anything from the x800 series , including the xl will require a new power supply .	St
1.12.3	i bought an antec true 480 for $ 120 at frys , but they fell in price by a lot .	St
1.12.4	i would go anything above 400 watts .	St
1.12.5	konny	St
1.13.1	I would reccommend switching off of hp and going to a company like dell or emachines they preform better and are worth the price you pay , HP 's technology becomes outdated quickly and is never that great in the first place .	St
1.13.2	HP/Compaq try to turn out as many new systems as they can in a year and that lowers the overall quality of each system .	St
1.13.3	I highly reccommend purchasing a dell or emachines system , on the other hand there is alwasy the custom option .	St
1.13.4	Buy the parts and assemble it your self or pay some one to do it .	St
1.14.1	Check the reply entitled 'What About This One ? '	Ques
1.14.2	I have already switched off of HP/Compaq and have moved to Gateway , with eMachines as a distant second	St
1.15.1	I was out doing some comparison shopping & what not today and found this same machine on sale at Nebraska Furniture Mart ( local midwest retailer ) for $ 739 ... ... a whole $ 140 cheaper than Best Buy .	St
1.16.1	You can get a Fortron AX-500a Blue Storm for 78 bucks shipped , Very nice Psu .	St
1.16.2	Dual rails , Sheilded cables and Fortron is one of the few PSU builders that actually under rate their PSU 's .	St
1.16.3	Mine is solid as a rock and if you check around you will find that Forton 's are indeed a quality PSU .	St
1.17.1	I ca n't seem to find it at this Nebraska Furniture Mart .	St
1.17.2	Do you have a link ( URL ) that we can look at ?	Ques
