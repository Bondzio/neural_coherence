Now that everything has transferred, not everything works.
MS office does not work and every time I attempt to reinstall, i get an error message.
I attempt the detect and repair selection but the installer package says &quot; package could not be verified&quot; and verify if the package exists and to contact the vendor.
The cd rom starts up that is the end of it.
I am afraid to uninstall and not able to reinstall since I am dependant on it.
