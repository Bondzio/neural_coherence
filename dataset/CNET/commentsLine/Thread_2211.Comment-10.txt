but your everyday bluetooth in a laptop can talk to mouse, keyboard, headset and a bt gps without any big issues.
so if someone wants to call that a unifier, let's let them.
bt gps units are what we call fungible.
when i need one i go to amazon.com and get another one.
we can get some militarized units for many thousand bucks but sales didn't happen so we just use the ones you find at amazon.
plentiful, all seem to work fine so i don't supply exact models.
