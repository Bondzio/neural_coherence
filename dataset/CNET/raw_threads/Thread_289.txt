The 2 desktops have been networked for a long time now. I am trying to add a laptop wirelessly to share files and a printer Computer A (dell) can not find the laptop on the network but can find the other desktop (computer b) Computer B (gateway) can find both laptop and computer A but when I click on laptop it says \\laptopname is not accessible. Laptop can not find any of the other two computers. When I click on the network name it says that network is inaccessible...... I have disabled all the firewalls. In fact, when I started trying to set this up the laptop didn't have any virus scan at the time. Computer A has AVG free on it, as does the laptop now. Did not find any sign of a firewall with that virus scan. All computers have guest account as active. All computers have a folder set as having permission to be shared. All computers can ping each other using their IP addresses. I'm stumped. I don't know what to do. I don't know how I got computer b to find the laptop but it can't access it anyways. Please help and thanks in advance. Tracy

Sometimes it works instantly even without the complete computer name, sometimes it just refuses to work unless everything is just so. How Microsoft imagined that the average consumer could use this is beyond me. I would suggest that you check that all firewalls are off (especially if your have 3rd party ones). Don't attempt to set up wirelessly -- use ethernet cable between the computers until things are working. Try running the Network Wizard on the new machine. Other than that just stick at it and eventually it will work.

I had to install the NWLink IPXSPXNetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol on the laptop. As soon as I did that, they all found each other and they were all able to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. Once I found that, it took me 10 seconds to fix it. Pretty frustrating when it is something that simple and I was looking for the answer for a week, but at least it's fixed and so far it seems to be working well. Thanks again, Tracy
