I am unable to access my apartment secured wi-fi network on my XP Windows notebook. When I click &quot;View available wireless connections,&quot; other psk networks in the neighborhood pop up, but mine does not. This is a computer issue, as my roommate's laptop recognizes the network. I have added the network as a &quot;preferred network&quot; by going to &quot;Wireless Network Connection Properties&quot; and inputting the name, WPA-PSK, AES, and the password. However, the laptop still won't recognize the network. What do you recommend?
