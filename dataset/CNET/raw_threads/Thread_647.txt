I just decided &quot;what the heck&quot; and bought the 8800 GTS. my question is about my processor. I am confident with my other system specs, so they are not important. but currently i have an AMD 64 3200+. Is it stupid of me to spend that much money on an 8800 GTS when i have this processor? I dont want the card to run slower because of my processing power. so what should i do? Spend the money to upgrade to a dual core processor? or should a game like crysis use the card fully with the processor i have now? also, if i was to upgrade, what is a recommended processor that wouldnt bottleneck the 8800 GTS? Any helpful suggestions are welcome..

There are a few 939 dual-core CPUs that you could upgrade to if you want to keep the same motherboard assuming that you have a 939 now as Googling that CPU brought up a 939 model. If you do go for the Intel side then a Core 2 Duo or better would be my suggestion. Regards, JB

Otherwise, you're better off saving the money and working with what you have. A processor upgrade isn't a big deal, and even a 4200+ would be able to handle whatever you throw at it. I know; I use one and have a 7900GT, and I have no problems running games at all. Except Oblivion, of course...but who doesn't have problems with that? Anyway, look at the X2 4x00+ line. You won't be disappointed.
