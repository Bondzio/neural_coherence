1.1.1	I am a dedicated Mac user .	St
1.1.2	However , I am also a data analyst .	St
1.1.3	Sometimes the programs I need to run analysis only comes in a Windows version .	St
1.1.4	I deal with stats , data mining , a little SQL type stuff .	St
1.1.5	I even need the Windows Excel due to add-ins , etc .	St
1.1.6	My data is rarely over 10GB .	St
1.1.7	Most is far less than that .	St
1.1.8	Here is my question- I am better off running a virtualization side on my Mac ( ie Parellels ) or to buy a Windows desktop/server , load the Windows programs into it and then remote desktop in from my Mac .	St
1.1.9	Thus I am running the analysis process on the Windows machine .	St
1.1.10	Upsides and downsides ?	Ques
1.1.11	Comments ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Since I can save the state of the & quot ; box & quot ; I think it 's an excellent solution .	St
1.2.2	And here 's a trick I use and want to share .	St
1.2.3	Let 's say I want to use another machine .	St
1.2.4	I copy my virtual box file over to that other machine and launch that virtual box machine without having to reinstall the windows in that virtual box .	St
1.2.5	It 's pretty amazing stuff .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I really love virtualization .	St
1.3.2	I got Vmware online coupons from ShoppingSpout .	St
1.3.3	I did n't feel any problem while working on it .	St
1.4.1	I am in the same situation with some of the apps I use for stats and data mining etc , but I access my Windows host over the internet ( from a Mac ) .	St
1.4.2	I decided against using virtualizing on my Mac .	St
1.4.3	Anyway , to remote in I use NoMachine for Windows and Mac .	St
1.4.4	I have to say for me it works like a charm .	St
