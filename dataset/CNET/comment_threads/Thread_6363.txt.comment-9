the 9800 pro is knocked out by both, the x800 will out perform the 6600gt, in most/all games except doom 3. check out tomshardware, they have a lot of gpu comparisons, or google it.
but both the 6600gt and the x800 will do fine for bf2.
i have heard about low fps for the 6600gt, but it is a demanding game.
