Say like have two XP home editions connect without a server, just the pc? For an example say you wanted to connect to a relatives computer through VPN. Could you do this with just the PC and DSL?

You could still connect without having a static IP but you would have to call the relative each time you want to connect and have them tell you the current IP address. Some ISP's don't offer static addresses or they charge you more for the convenience. But if they have a static IP, simply create a VPN on your computer and then configure the relative's computer to act as a VPN server.

3783	7	164622	1821641	1821608	swetooth9	3/21/06 2:35 PM	1.1429517E12	IP Addresses	Ok, I found the IP addresses and both of our computers have in our home have the same one. Will this be the same as on the schools computers if I want to connect to a school server? -Thanks
3783	8	164622	1821749	1821608	Darton Fury	3/21/06 3:33 PM	1.14295518E12	Create VPN Server	It's qite simple. Open Network Connections from Control Panel. Under Network Tasks, click, Create A New Connection. The Wizard appears and you simply follow the prompts. Choose to set up an advanced connection. Regarding finding IP addresses -open command prompt and type ipconfig /all to see info relating to all the network connections you have. Or simply ipconfig if there is only 1 computer.
