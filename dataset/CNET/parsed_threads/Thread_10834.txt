<s> Hi Bob, I have one suggestion for the sticky. </s>
<s> Please ask posters to refer to the forum Note, since most seem to overlook it. </s>
<s> Thanks Stan </s>
<s> Sorry to show my ignorance,but just what is a sticky }:&gt; </s>
<s> A 'sticky' is a post that always stays on top of the list in a bold font. </s>
<s> It sticks to the top, so to say. </s>
<s> Some forums have, some don't. </s>
<s> Only the moderator can make them. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Actually others have written the forum stickies. </s>
<s> Example at this link -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5204-7594_102-0.html?forumID=59&tag=forum.fd I may have to actually break down and write one for here. </s>
<s> But it's true that the moderators do decide which gets the sticky feature. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tried to look these up in tips and tricks, no stickies. </s>
<s> I see, so thats what that is. </s>
<s> I thought a sticky was an update for a thread, a way of adding a note or update to a submitted thread. </s>
<s> All clear, no responses needed. </s>
<s> I've got it. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway. </s>
