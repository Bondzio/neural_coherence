I am a tech junkie...and my family owns a computer consulting firm. I am no stranger to tech troubleshooting....but this problem has me wanting to 'shoot' myself in the head... I have: + an old Dell + Windows XP Home Edition + EXCELLENT Wireless Signal, but cannot connect to the Internet--and have tried multiple browsers + Cable works just fine + Not site specific...have this problem at 3 locations now. + I have reinstalled the wireless card and reinstalled it. + Repaired, disabled and enabled... + Successful reset connection through 'msconfig' black screen The KICKER is: I have another machine that is doing the same thing OUT OF THE BLUE... I have also scanned for viruses...though I have had virus problems on this machine before... HELP???
