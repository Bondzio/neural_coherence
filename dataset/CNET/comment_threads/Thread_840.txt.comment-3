Too bad I have no quick way available to show pictures.
However I look at the caps and don't see any domed tops.
The tops are flat, clean and shiny, and with a &quot;K&quot;, &quot;+&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; shaped marking on them.
About the power supply: It's only 300W It's made in China.
It doesn't appear to have a brand, unless &quot;Sales International&quot; is a brand.
So it doesn't look like the best power supply out there.
Maybe I should think about replacing this.
Could a bad power supply cause all the symptoms I mentioned?
