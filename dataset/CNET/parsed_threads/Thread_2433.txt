<s> I am considering purchasng a jump drive to back up my computer. </s>
<s> Is this feasible? </s>
<s> How would I know how many MBs or GBs I would need? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If you have 40GB of disk data to back up to achieve a reliable backup you need 3 copies. </s>
<s> 1 for storage away from the machine, number 2 as the copy that you will not overwrite during backup and number 3 will be the set you use to backup to. </s>
<s> Since 1GB Jumpdrives are fairly common, you need 120 of these units and with that many lets say you get them at the discount/sale price of 59 bucks each. </s>
<s> $7,080 later and heavy in debt you wonder if this was a good idea. </s>
<s> DVDRW backup seems cheaper. </s>

<s> Maybe you should consider a externial USB Harddrive for the task. </s>
