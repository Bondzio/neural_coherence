1.1.1	first: I like to thank all the persons that will post a possible solution to help me out: I have a laptop called PC by Cisnet, it is a laptop with AMD Turion 64 CPU, 1.60 GHz and 512 RAM with a 60GB hard drive.	St
1.1.2	Yesterday, when I was about to do some school project research, I couldn't get on line!	St
1.1.3	When I click on my network place and all the network (my local network, wireless network) is GONE!	St
1.1.4	When I try to click on the wireless connection button, it is not connection.	St
1.1.5	When I click on the wireless network in control panel, it should a blank windows (there is no wireless hardware) When my brother came home, I told him about it and he called a friend who try to Google the problem on line: and give us these solutions to try: try to locate the network hardware (the network card and the wireless network is not showing up) and reinstall the driver; check the BIOS to see if hardware is disable somehow and reinstall windows.	St
1.1.6	He tries all but it is still the same.	St
1.1.7	In the Bios, wireless default setting is enabled.	St
1.1.8	With the exception of Boot on LAN, there is nothing in the Bios that is related to LAN.	St
1.1.9	He reinstalled all the driver that came with the Computer after he reinstall windows xp but the problem remain.	St
1.1.10	What I can do to fix this problem (both wire and wireless is not working, the computer is not recognizing any network hardware) what else can we do to fix this problem?	St
1.1.11	Thank one again for your help	St
1.2.1	And CISNET is not telling you what to do next I'll share that I don't waste any time with such machines if it doesn't come on in 5 minutes and an OS reload is not acceptable.	St
1.2.2	I carry wifi cards in my bag so I fish out either the WPNT511, WPC54G or some USB wifi stick and try that.	St
1.2.3	If that works then we're done.	St
1.2.4	Those that don't accept that solution have to accept the OS reload as a try then shipping the machine off to repair if the OS reload doesn't fix it.	St
1.2.5	This is not an offer to teach or find the Fn+Fkey combo or button that turns on or off your wifi internal card.	St
1.2.6	You OWN your machine and must check on that as I can't be your tech support.	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
