<s> Just purchased Asus netbook, will use for travelling. </s>
<s> Constantly use MS Office, Outlook, Adobe Lightroom, IE. </s>
<s> What would be the recommended software to install? </s>
<s> I install and use the same software on my netbook that I use on my laptop. </s>
<s> Why would I change? </s>
<s> Since the netbook's specs is different from a regular laptop, A few applications might run extremly slow. </s>
<s> What are the applications that you are using anyways just so that we can test if ever. </s>
<s> I can test this today and am living it. </s>
<s> Our office netbook is used to run out of the office to patch up software in the field. </s>
<s> We use visual studio and it's not that slow. </s>
<s> My apologies but for this answer you need to be there, running on the netbook to find that it's not a bad choice. </s>

<s> Hi! </s>
<s> I just got an Asus netbook as well, and I learned how truly important nice, compact software is in the smooth performance of netbooks. </s>
<s> Here's a list of the programs that have been working really well for me so far: -GOOGLE CHROME. </s>
<s> It's a speedy, lightweight browser that works splendidly in netbooks. </s>
<s> It doesn't have as many features as Firefox, but that's a trade-off you'll have to make for faster performance. </s>
<s> Forget IE! </s>
<s> This works much better. </s>
<s> -THUNDERBIRD. </s>
<s> This is a nice, bloat-free alternative to MS Outlook. </s>
<s> Made by Mozilla as well. </s>
<s> -AVG Anti-virus. </s>
<s> Suggested to me by the guy who sold me my netbook. </s>
<s> A lot of other websites say this is the best anti-virus software for the netbook's capacity. </s>
<s> I've always been an Avira user, so I am yet to see how this performs. </s>
<s> -UTORRENT. </s>
<s> A really small but effective torrent program. </s>
<s> Works great for my torrent downloads. </s>
<s> I'm replacing Vuze in my other laptop with this compact program soon. </s>
<s> -FOXIT READER. </s>
<s> For viewing PDFs. </s>
