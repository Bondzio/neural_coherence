I used revovery from the XP install cd and ran chkdsk /p and chkdsk /f and fixmbr and fixboot. It found errors with the chkdsk /f, but I thought it fixed them. Still doesn't see drives on boot. bios setup doesn't see them either. My question is: Do I need a new hard drive to fix this or is it something else?

A poor power connector can cause this. If it does not show in the BIOS, XP won't see it either so don't bother with XP until until the detection problem is worked out.

I'm running XP home installed with a clean install using an upgrade from 98se. It is up to date with SP2 and all of the latest udated from microsoft. It is a Micron Millenia (Best Buy) P# 733 with 2 hard drives. I'm running AWIL's avast anti-virus and microsofts anti-spyware. I just did a chkdsk on the secondary drive and it read unrecoverable. I unhooked it and the PC started. Guess I'm back in business. Thanks again
