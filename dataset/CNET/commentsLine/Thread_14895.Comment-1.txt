hi all, i've currently beefed up my computer by installing an ati radeon x800 pro graphics card and replacing my 512mb of ram with 1gb (512mb x 2 duel crucial channel kit) however, whats seriously lacking in my comp is a new power supply.
my current ps is a pathetic 300w which is making other components in the pc under perform.
now, i'm no expert when it comes to buying power supplies, so i thought i'd ask you guys.
what do i need to consider before buying a new one?
i'm aiming to purchase a power supply capable of generating between 400-450w.
if it helps, my current pc spec is as follows... windows xp home edition 2.19ghz amd athlon xp 3200+ 1.00gb ram sapphire radeon x800 pro gfx.
motherboard: manufacturer : asustek computer inc. mp support : no model : a7nvm400 version : rev 2.xx serial number : mb-1234567890 system bios : 63-0100-000001-00101111-112503-nforce thanks all.
