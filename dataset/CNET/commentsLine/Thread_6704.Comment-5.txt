thank you for the post.
i have opened the case and looked at the usb ,but there does not appear to be any physical damage .
i have used the compressed air to clean the area.
the situation at the moment: the front usb does not work.
the device manager shows all usb controllers and usb root hubs ok. only the &quot;other devices&quot; has a yellow question mark over it.
only a &quot; mci modem&quot; is listed in the devices with yellow mark on it, and as it is, i do not use modem ,i have a router which presumably has a modem in it.
my internet on the broadband works fine.
during my physical examination i found it difficult to reach the front usb because the front of the computer case and the m/board area is partitioned by the wall where the hard drive and other dvd writer devices are housed.
there is only a couple of inches of space in between.
i could have a clear view of it but could not have handling access to the usb cables or the card on which the usb circuit is printed.
to this extent i am saying that it appeared ok. if nothing else then i shall try to open this area to have a closer look.
i am sorry the issue seems intractable though i am not so worried if this is not solved, but i would not rest unless i understand the problem.obviously there is the inconvenience of using my printer with my laptop which is often based in a different room.
