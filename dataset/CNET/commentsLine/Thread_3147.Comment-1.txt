couldn't find anything regarding forwards compatibility of ram i assumed it would work, but at this point i'm thinking it doesn't and i'm going to have to buy some new ram.
it's my first real build although i've been switching out components for years.
i definitely did everything correctly on the inside but at post it makes the same 3 beeps it makes with no ram with the 553. its an ami bios and according to this  3 beeps is supposed to be a ram problem.
