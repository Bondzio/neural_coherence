Regardless of which of these a choose the boot fails and the computer restarts. In safe mode, the last line it shows is the driver agp440.sys. I have tried the recovery console to disable this driver but lstsvc doesnt list anything and i can't disable agp440 via &quot;disable agp440&quot;. If i try and reinstall windows, in the list of available discs to install to, the harddrive isn't there. I can't figure out if the drive has just had it or not. It just doesnt make sense that it can load a bunch of drives during boot, but yet it doesn't reconised the drive at all in installation. Any help with this matter would be great. Im running win xp pro sp2.
