now that's the real question.
you can ask google.com that and see many pages to learn how so i won't write another word on soldering.
but i do want to share i've repaired this issue before.
here's how.
if you know how that connector is made it is 40 metal posts in a socket.
if i grab the bad post and heat up the post on the back side of the motherboard the post can be removed.
i use a replacement post that i salvage from an old dead motherboard and solder that post into the board.
the one thing you have to be is gentle and not burn up the board.
but that's solder skill which i can't teach here.
-&gt; if straightening the post results in it breaking, it can be replaced.
but in no case have i ever replaced all 40 pins or the entire connector.
