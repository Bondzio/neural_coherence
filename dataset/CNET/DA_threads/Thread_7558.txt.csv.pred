1.1.1	Today I discovered that I have lost about half the info on a 2gb pin drive .	St
1.1.2	Needless to say , I am sick !	St
1.1.3	Awhile ago , we thought we were going to have to reinstall Windows , so I removed everything and put it on my pin drive .	St
1.1.4	Computer problems not totally resolved , so pending possible visit from serviceman , I 've just been using the pin drive .	St
1.1.5	It was on my list to put info back on hard drive as a backup and still use pin drive as main , for now , but I never got around to it .	St
1.1.6	After reading recent e-mail from C-Net about how info can be lost from a pin drive , I was a little concerned ( and ca n't say I was n't warned ) .	St
1.1.7	Yesterday , the power flickered and computer rebooted on its own , with pin drive in .	St
1.1.8	Today , I try to access the folder that has about 800 mb of info ; it 's gone .	St
1.1.9	Rest of pin drive is okay .	St
1.1.10	Let this be a warning , I would n't want this to happen to anyone else .	St
1.1.11	What was lost represents about 10 years of carefully-accumulated files that backup the cause I work for .	St
1.1.12	There will be some of the older stuff on floppies , but all recent , since I started using pin drives , is gone .	St
1.1.13	Do n't let this happen to you !	St
1.1.14	You never know when the power will flicker , or you could even accidentally knock the pin drive out .	St
1.2.1	While 800MB is over your one common CDR , the entire 2GB fits on DVDR .	St
1.2.2	The cost of a DVDR blank is less than 1 buck here .	St
1.2.3	- & gt ; Given a cost of 1 dollar , why are n't people creating such a backup ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Of course I should have done this !	St
1.3.2	Could a , should a , would a !	St
1.3.3	I 'm just warning others to take this seriously .	St
1.4.1	Okay , I put a CD in and tried to transfer using Drag-to-Disc and the CD drive , but I get a message that Windows encountered a problem trying to copy this folder .	St
1.4.2	What 's wrong ?	Ques
1.4.3	This is a desktop Dell , only a couple months old , XP .	St
1.5.1	To avoid drag to CDR and such due to too many failures .	St
1.5.2	Try it the old fashioned way where we put our files in the hard disk , open up the CD recording software and create a data CD .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I sent this in once and it has n't shown up , so something must have happened .	St
1.6.2	I came back in here and noticed that I had the wrong pin drive in .	St
1.6.3	I put the current one in and everything is there .	St
1.6.4	I ca n't tell you how thankful I am !	St
1.6.5	So , the question is , could a power loss cause data to be lost ?	Ques
1.7.1	They have been very lucky to date .	St
1.7.2	But the file system is FAT32 ( most ) and a bit easy to corrupt .	St
1.7.3	- & gt ; Your near brush with loss is a good way to learn about this issue .	St
