I am talking about the office. We have a few printers and the 4-5 PCs can access them as necessary. Right now we work with 32 bit computers. If we were to switch, what would I have to do to make the printers work? Intels processors are said to work seamlessly with 64 and 32 tasks. Now does that mean that I can install Windows XP or Vista 64 bit editions on my computers while utilizing 32 bit printer drivers? If this does not work then can I get a print server and connect multiple printers and computers and make 64 bit computers work with the printers? I will have to check out if 64 bit drivers are available or not. My questions are for the time when there are no printer drivers available. Thank You

While a print share might be visible on the network, it doesn't mean you can print to it. Bob

Alot of time, big changes mean a &quot;break aawy time&quot; for makers/vendors and time to upgrade or update if you want to keep in the loop. More often than not, unpopular or unique devices get left behind. However, &quot;the squeaky wheel gets the oil&quot; does apply over time if enough noise is made, but again sometimes not. tada -----Willy

Printers, webcam, Dazzle 150. after contacting the manufactures and being told no drivers were currently in development I immediatly re-installed win XP home. New OS's can be great but before up grading confirm your hardware has available 64 bit drivers.
