<s> My Deskjet 3650 won't print. </s>
<s> It keeps blinking. </s>
<s> It says remove right cartridge and if it still blinks cartridge in side might be broken. </s>
<s> I called HP they said out of warentee. </s>
<s> I don't remember any cartridge inside the machine besides the 2 ink ones (color and black). </s>
<s> What cartridge could they mean. </s>

<s> What many discover are these printers last only a few years. </s>
<s> At least they are cheap compared to what we paid in times past. </s>
<s> Do the self test and clean any contacts you see, try again and then go shopping. </s>

<s> What self test? </s>
<s> It keeps blinking so comunication can not be established with the printer. </s>
<s> And what cartridge are they talking about anyway? </s>
<s> And sinse I'm going shopping what HP is ok. </s>
<s> Same style like HP-5440 the lady onn the phone was offering. </s>
<s> All those kind will never last me more than 3 years? </s>
<s> Or is there 1 that can last me 10 years or more? </s>
<s> Thanks, Confusimo </s>
<s> A HP LaserJet Plus. </s>
<s> It draws about 1400 Watts when printing at about 8 pages a minute but it's certainly hanging in there. </s>
<s> I paid the HP employee price on a refurb of 1,000 bucks. </s>
<s> Deal or no deal? </s>

<s> The error explains upon getting the error, open cover and remove the *right* inkcart then close cover and open again. </s>
<s> If the light remains lit(non-blinking) ink cart you removed is the a problem. </s>
<s> If the led continues to blink, then the remaining ink cart still mounted is the problem one, buy a replacement for the one that it refers to. </s>
<s> Review your error again: http://teenlounge.org/cnet/bug3/problemhp2.JPG Does it make sense now? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
