The simple answer is: It is NEVER safe to rely on any hard drive especially if it is your only copy of your data.
You should always have at least two copies at all times.
This means that if you reformat your computers hard drive, you will be left with only one copy and that is assuming that you backed up your data correctly and did not miss something.
The safest way to do what you want is to simply go out and purchase a new hard drive for your computer and install Windows on that.
This way you still have all your data on your original drive as well as the backup that you just made.
I am assuming that since you are planning on reformatting the drive, it must be a year or more old anyway and since you are going to all the trouble of reformatting, reinstalling Windows, drivers, software and printers, why not start with a nice speedy new drive.
If you really want a major boost in performance, now might be the time to switch to and SSD drive and keep your old drive as the D: data drive.
I cannot tell you how many times I have run into the scenario where someone thought they had backed up everything only to find that they had nothing or where missing some really important data that they did not realize was tucked away in some hidden folder.
