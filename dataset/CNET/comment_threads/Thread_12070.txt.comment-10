I have a phenom 9850 MSI am2+ board.
I leave the computer on 90% of the time and built it myself about 2-3 years ago.
I came home today and my computer was off.
(I thought an automatic update took place and the machine shut off, and just did not start back up) The machine would do the same as your symptoms were.
I finally took the side off and found my heatsink was not seated.
I went to reattatch it and found a plastic ear was broken.
The broken ear is on a square plastic ring about 3 1/2&quot;X 4&quot; held to the motherboard by 4 philips screws.
So my question is does anyone sell the square ring by itself?
(I have a feeling I'm going to have salvage one from an old amd computer.)
