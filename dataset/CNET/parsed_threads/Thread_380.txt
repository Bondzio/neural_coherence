<s> I tried a dual monitor setup for several days when my company donated 3 older CRT monitors. </s>
<s> I played around with: ATI 128MB Radeon 9800 Pro Dell UltraSharp 18.1'' LCD monitor (no pivot mode) some 17'' Compaq CRT monitor I don't have this setup anymore since. </s>
<s> My deskspace barely has enough for these 2 monitors, my PC tower, and misc stuff like speakers which also meant i couldn't really see the TV with it the extra one there, but I might reconfigure the setup later on. </s>
<s> In the meantime, any1 have tips or utilities to share for dual monitor users? </s>
<s> Tips like how to seperate 2 opened Excel files into 2 entries on the taskbar so I can put 'em side by side across the monitors. </s>
<s> And utilities/software/games like MinMaxExtender which is actually for single monitors but deals with window functionality like ''always on top'', ''vertical max'', etc.?) </s>
<s> or fun stuff like Particle Fire 2 (screen saver with dual monitor support) I keep work stuff at work, so this PC is mostly used for PC games, surfing, and and multimedia. </s>
<s> I actually tried using the 2nd monitor to surf while watching TV shows/movies (on DVD) or while a slow/lagging PC game was loading up. </s>
<s> It was pretty neat. </s>
<s> I have a 17&quot; flat screen that came with my new(er) system and I kept the 17&quot; bulky monitor from my old system to create a dual-monitor system. </s>
<s> I put my Google Desktop panels on my older monitor so that I can easily keep track of new messages, news stories (I am a TV producer). </s>
<s> I also keep my AIM and Yahoo IM windows on my secondary monitor. </s>
<s> When I need to compare documents (such as the Excel example) I open two instances of the program and put one on the secondary monitor. </s>
<s> I could never go back to a single monitor. </s>
<s> This setup is great for multitasking! </s>
<s> I'd love to hear how other people use their dual monitors. </s>
<s> I also have a question: my newer system came with a TV tuner card, but it only has one monitor output. </s>
<s> Is there any way to use the tuner card with my dual-monitor video card? </s>

<s> I use 2 Samsung 213T monitors on a Radeon 1600. </s>
<s> It really helps to have 2 monitors the same size for applications that spread across the desktop. </s>
<s> The dual monitor set-up can be done in a couple ways. </s>
<s> I purchased a card that would support 2 monitors (there are several cards that support 2+ monitors). </s>
<s> This can also be done with one AGP/PCI express card and a second PCI card. </s>
<s> In the case of TV tuner cards, they typically will require a second card for a dual monitor set-up. </s>
<s> I use a program call UltraMon. </s>
<s> This gives a task bar for each monitor, a button to send a window to the other monitor, a button to expand a window to the desktop, wallpaper tools, monitor set-up tools and other goodies. </s>
<s> It is a real handy, reliable program. </s>
<s> It has a trail version for free and is registered for a price. </s>
<s> I originally used the set-up for generating reports based on spreadsheats. </s>
<s> It worked very well to have the document on one screen and the graphs/calculations on the other. </s>
<s> Excel, other MS office programs and any general program require two instances, one for each monitor. </s>
<s> It is also really good for web surfing, IM, video chat and movie playback. </s>
<s> You can keep the windows separate and readable. </s>
<s> I have noticed that with dual monitors I can overload the processor much easier due to the extra tasks. </s>
<s> I use my machine for audio recording and encoding, music playback, and games at the same time. </s>
<s> I would recommend a robust processor or extra memory with a dual monitor set-up to avoid too much lag. </s>
<s> For dual screen wallpapers see digitalblasphemy.com. </s>
<s> There is a whole collection for dual and triple screen computers. </s>
