go for a 64 bit processor- and not the lowest one offered either.
(not the most recent either.
get a mid-level athlon.)
get at least 1 gig of ddram, or rambus.
more than 1 cant hurt and will definitely help.
dont see why you'd need more than 60-80 gig hard drive, really.
how many games can you load on already in one shot?
if you'll be doing heavy duty gaming you'll want a case with a good power supply and plenty of room for fans.
make sure your motherboard has room to expand.
make sure it has at least 4-6 usb slots.
there is nothing more irritating then unplugging something so you'll have room for another usb device.
usb and firewire is the future- make sure you have them.
