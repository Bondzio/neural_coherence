1.1.1	My PC crashed ( OS windows XP Home ) and i want to retrieve data from the 80gb SATA HD .	St
1.1.2	I have removed HD and inserted into a USB SATA caddy enclosure .	St
1.1.3	I have connected caddy to my laptop ( OS Vista ) which displays as a local disk G. when i try to open it requests that i need to format the disk in drive G before i can use it , if i do this will i lose data , how can i access the data ? ?	Ques
1.1.4	If it helps , in disk mgt drive G is RAW file system and has healthy , active primary partition status .	St
1.1.5	Please help	St
1.2.1	The filesystem should n't be RAW , but NTFS .	St
1.2.2	That 's why Vista says it needs to be formatted .	St
1.2.3	And , indeed , you 'll lose everything that 's on it .	St
1.2.4	Zero assumption recovery ( from http : //www.z-a-recovery.com/ ) usually is able to get the data from such disks .	St
1.2.5	Worth a try , although not free ( $ 49.99 ) .	St
1.2.6	It 's up to you to decide if your data is worth that much .	St
1.2.7	Hope this helps .	St
