<s> I recently put together a computer that has a blank harddrive. </s>
<s> I bought windows xp (bootable) to use as an operating system. </s>
<s> When I turn the pc on it says that there is no harddrive. </s>
<s> When I put in my old (2gb) harddrive it uses it right away but not the new harddrive. </s>
<s> Ive tried everything. </s>
<s> It works, I know that much. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> and it cannot detect the harddrive? </s>
<s> Is this a SATA Hdd. </s>
<s> by chance? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> BIOS not set to autodetect drives 2. </s>
<s> SATA drive on RAID configured port (move to another port) 3. </s>
<s> PATA drive not jumpered correctly 4. </s>
<s> Defective drive or cable The first place to look is in the BIOS setup menu. </s>
<s> Boot there see what drives show up. </s>
<s> It sounds as if the CD/DVD ROM is detected. </s>
<s> The HD listing should be in that general area. </s>
<s> As well, make sure the HD spins up. </s>
<s> You should be able to hear the motor start and the clicking from the heads initializing. </s>
<s> in the XP installation where you must hit 'F6'(?) </s>
<s> to load any special drivers for SATA hard disk drives. </s>
<s> Did you try that ? </s>
<s> Sometimes you have to create a floppy disk to load the driver. </s>
<s> It would really help if you provided more detail about the hard drive . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> .make/model number/type(SATA-PATA ?) </s>
<s> and the motherboard mfg and model number. </s>
<s> Keep us posted. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The harddrive is a Quantum Fireball, PATA, part #QML20000LD-A it came in a Gateway tower. </s>
<s> It had windows 98 on it. </s>
<s> The light for the hd comes on for a second but then shuts off. </s>
<s> The hd spins for a moment and then quits. </s>
<s> Everything is hooked up right, i took it apart and everything looks fine. </s>
<s> I have a really old 2gb hd that I have rebuilt and it works just fine for being nearly 11 years old. </s>
<s> I cant figure out the Quantum. </s>
<s> are you an archeologist? </s>
<s> Or tried it on another PC ? </s>
<s> Sure the jumpering is OK ? </s>
<s> Sure the cable is OK ? </s>
<s> If any question ...place the HDD on cable by itself. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Ok. Ok. </s>
<s> The parts are old but that half the fun getting them to work again. </s>
<s> Ive tried the hd on several pc's with the same result. </s>
<s> I have tried 9 different cables, the jumper is on the master setting and still no luck. </s>
<s> I may end up buying a new hd, I dont want to because this is just a little project I have to save an aunt from a windows 95 machine! </s>
<s> That thing is old. </s>
