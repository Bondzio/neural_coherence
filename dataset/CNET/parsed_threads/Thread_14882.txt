<s> Well, as the title suggests, I am making my first build. </s>
<s> So my budget is around 30,000 INR. </s>
<s> (1$ = Roughly 65 Rupees) (Approx 450$) So here is my proposed build: Case: Cooler Master N300 NSE-300 KKN1 Mid tower case CPU: AMD FX - 4300 Black edition MoBo: Asus M5A78L-M LX V2 or Gigabyte GA-78LMT-USB3 (confused as I want a USB 3.0) RAM: Corsair Vengeance CMZ4GX3M1A606C9 4*1 4 GB (1600 DDR3) GPU: Confused. </s>
<s> I don't know which one to get. </s>
<s> Preferably under 3000Rs. </s>
<s> HDD: WD Blue WD10EZEX 1 TB. </s>
<s> Optical drive: Samsung SH 224 DB/IDDS PSU: Another place of confusion. </s>
<s> One of the calculators suggested I get a 300W one, whereas one showed around 450W. </s>
<s> Please suggest. </s>
<s> And one more question. </s>
<s> Well, the site says that the motherboard supports Windows 7. </s>
<s> Does that mean it can't run Windows 8? </s>
<s> Also, I'm buying parts from flipkart.com I'm not sure whether this will be enough for hardcore gaming and stuff but my mom needs it now so I did a lot of research and found out all this. </s>
<s> I already have a monitor for my needs. </s>
<s> A friend of mine will provide me the OS (Win 7 Ultimate or Win 8?) </s>
<s> I'm confused A LOT. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Did you look at the AMD A10? </s>
<s> That way you game for much less. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You mean the AMD A10- 5800K right? </s>
<s> It comes with HD 7660D integrated graphics. </s>
<s> Hmm nice option. </s>
<s> But a good Mobo for that? </s>
<s> I want USB 3.0 and preferably 1600Mhz memory supported. </s>
<s> (Under a budget though) :P </s>
<s> Tomshardware did benchmark comparisons on motherboards and found so little difference that they don't do that anymore. </s>
<s> Your comment about memory speed is very strange. </s>
<s> Something a new builder might ask. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I kinda knew it. </s>
<s> I googled it and came to know that it should downgrade itself to 1333Mhz. </s>
<s> So now I'm fine with that. </s>
<s> But still for the motherboard. </s>
<s> I'm searching, and when I'll get one I'll come up with it. </s>
<s> I found a motherboard for the FM2 socket type, and now another problem has come up. </s>
<s> One of the reviewers says that the position of the RAM slots is such that I can't fit Corsair Vengeance RAMs (or any RAMs with heatsink) in it. </s>
<s> Anyways the motherboard is Gigabyte GA- F2A55M-DS2. </s>
<s> So it seems like I might have to change my RAM. </s>
<s> It's not as if anyone mentioned overclocking and such. </s>
<s> So what's the issue here? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not the fan one, the RAM is designed in such a way to cool it down. </s>
<s> Let's just say it is a big sized one. </s>
<s> And no, I have no plans of overclocking as of now. </s>
<s> Look at crucial.com and you rarely see such addons. </s>
<s> http://www.flipkart.com/corsair-vengeance-ddr3-4-gb-1-x-gb-pc-ram-cmz4gx3m1a1600c9/p/itmd2rypbx4eehaf?pid=RAMD2RYPMVWCEK6E&otracker=from-search&srno=t_1&query=RAM&ref=37036966-ff48-4092-be86-29929db6e621 And how is the Motherboard? </s>
<s> This is not saying this is for your machine but notice it has no fins. </s>
<s> They are not needed. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PC3-12800-Unbuffered-240-Pin-CT51264BA160B/dp/B006YG89Q6 </s>
<s> If you are going with that mobo and an apu you will be using system ram for video ram. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231550 That will get you. </s>
<s> Dual channel Faster speed for the video Enough ram for the video to grab as big a chunk as it wants. </s>
<s> But the memory clock rate is set by the APU in this case and there's no need for heat spreaders yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It looks like the a10 will support 1866 native. </s>
<s> It looks like the mobo the op picked will support 1866 native. </s>
<s> Since that igp will feed from the system ram.....I'd go with the fastest ram possible....native. </s>
<s> Heat spreaders? </s>
<s> Nice to look at I suppose. </s>
<s> Perhaps their of value with the folks that go nut-so with overclocking. </s>
<s> You have lots of options . </s>
<s> One of which is to go the A10 route (as R. Proffitt has suggested). </s>
<s> So, with this in mind: CPU: A10 Series will do the trick (and have a GPU already) Mobo: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128566 It has all the features you're looking for (USB 3.0, DDR3 2400OC/1866/1600/1333/1066Mhz memory modules). </s>
<s> Gigabyte is one of the best motherboard manufacturers out there, and a gamer's choice...you'll be in good shape. </s>
<s> Cost: $119 RAM: Your selection is fine; if anything I'd consider a total of 8GB since you're planning on doing lots of gaming (I'm a gamer by the way ). </s>
<s> You'll be looking at $80 to $100 if you choose this route. </s>
<s> Corsair is fine. </s>
<s> GPU: the A10-5800K comes with the Radeon HD 7660 GPU. </s>
<s> Note, the &quot;K&quot; means the GPU/CPU are unlocked, ready for overclocking, that is if you ever choose to overclock them, you will be able to do so. </s>
<s> Cost: $130 And if you are interested to learn about our A-Series APUs, look here: http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/Pages/consumer-desktops.aspx#7 HDD: Your selection is fine. </s>
<s> But if you are planning to play lots of games, an SSD can be a good alternative; you'll have a greater performance (in terms of access times). </s>
<s> It will cost you a little more thought. </s>
<s> If anything go with a 120GB SSD, make it the bootable drive and use the WD Blue HDD as the secondary/storage drive. </s>
<s> Cost for a 120GB SSD is about $120. </s>
<s> Again this is just an option...not a must. </s>
<s> Optical Drive: No comment here, I never used a Samsung drive but it's a great company with lots of good products in the market. </s>
<s> You will be fine. </s>
<s> PSU: this is important. </s>
<s> Make sure to get a 500w (or greater) power supply. </s>
<s> It's a good investment and will pay dividends in the long term. </s>
<s> It will easily power any of the components listed here and if you ever want to add other device, well you won't have to worry about the PSU. </s>
<s> I suggest Cooler Master, Corsair or Antec, look here: http://www.newegg.com/Power-Supplies/SubCategory/ID-58 Cost: about $70 About the Operating System: Don't worry the above are all Windows friendly. </s>
<s> From a gamer standpoint, I suggest you run Win-7 (or Win-7 64bit if you go with 8GB of RAM). </s>
<s> Win 8 will do just fine too. </s>
<s> NOTE: Avoid doing any overclocking if you are new at building/customizing PC system. </s>
<s> Start slow Also, the RAM won't heat up if you don't overclock them... Good luck Drillo283! </s>
<s> Thanks Warsam71, Your reply was extremely helpful. </s>
<s> But the problem is, all included, it goes way over budget. </s>
<s> Over 500$. </s>
<s> I can't afford to spend that much. </s>
<s> SSD is just isn't an option as it gives less space for more money. </s>
<s> Yeah it does have it's advantages, but it is still very expensive. </s>
<s> The motherboard, it costs 12000 Rs. </s>
<s> Around 200$ or less :/ Oh well and I still have to buy a good PSU. </s>
<s> The 8 GB RAM though was a good idea. </s>
<s> I might consider it. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> I will post my final rig when it is decided. </s>
<s> Very nicely explained and a detailed reply. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> So as per the proposed changes, I have made a new rig fitting my budget (yay! </s>
<s> :D) I still have no need for a monitor. </s>
<s> So, here is the new changed rig. </s>
<s> Case: Cooler Master N300 NSE-300 KKN1 Mid tower case Processor: AMD A10 - 5800K MoBo: MSI- FM2-A85-XMA-P33 (Got one that gets all my needs + in my budget :D) RAM: Corsair Vengeance CMZ4GX3M1A606C9 4*1 4 GB (1600 DDR3) HDD: WD Blue WD10EZEX 1 TB. </s>
<s> Optical drive: Samsung SH 224 DB/IDDS PSU: Corsair CX-500 500W I won't install graphic card right now. </s>
<s> I hope that the PSU will be sufficient. </s>
<s> Just make it a single rail model to avoid having to learn about &quot;balancing the rails.&quot; I find most builders only get into that years later. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My bad, the case is Cooler Master K281 Midtower </s>
<s> Should I go ahead and order these parts? </s>
<s> As this fits in my budget and well, prices are about to rise even further so I would like to get them as quickly as possible. </s>
<s> Fast reply would help. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If yes, get 2 * 2GBs=4GB or better yet 2 * 4GB=8GB.....otherwise if/when you want to add RAM...you won't have to pull out RAM to install the new RAM. </s>
<s> Better you get 8GBs (2*4GBs) now that have to do it later. </s>
<s> Let us know how it turns out. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Hmm ok, and I'm going to get my parts today, wish me luck! </s>
<s> :3 </s>
<s> The new AMD APU models like this can really put some entry level gaming in easy reach with the ability to add a better graphics card in another year. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
