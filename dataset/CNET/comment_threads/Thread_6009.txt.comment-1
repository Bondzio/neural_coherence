I want to find an Nvidia nforce motherboard to upgrade my current system.
I can't find one.
My preferences would be to have one with a PCIE connection (regardless 1x or 16x).
If not, at least an AGP 8x.
The RAM support needs to be at least dual cahnnel DDR 400 compatible.
Any suggestions?
CPU: Intel P4 w/ HT @ 3.20 GHz Socket 478 current motherboard: Intel D865GVHZ (mATX) OS: Windows XP Pro
