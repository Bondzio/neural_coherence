5552	0	13888	157427	NR	Urqie	3/1/04 6:21 AM	1.07812206E12	Front Audio Hookup	I have just installed my motherboard (Elitegroup Ks57a( into a new case (Axio ATX 732 X5 Series) This case comes with two front USB ports as well as a headphone and mic jack. I have hooked up the USB ports,(although one is current not working) but the headphone and mic jack setup is giving me problems. I can't make heads nor tails of how to connect them to my motherboard. I know they go to my FP_Audio but I don't know what connector goes to what pin because they are labled differently from one another. This is my first time doing this by the way and I am just impressed that my machine is still working. They pins on the ribbon for the headphone and jack from the case are: L-IN - White wire L-OUT - Red wire GRND - Black Mice - IN - Orange R-OUT - Red R-IN - White MIC - IN - Green GRND - BLK The confusing thing is the pins on the motherboard seem to be marked differently then what is in the manual. But the pin setup is the same with 5pin on the left and a 3 blank 1 pin on the right. If anyone can sort this out for me or point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.

See if the maker's web site has a newer manual and from experience, the marking on the motherboard is often correct. Bob

Two channels each for left and right headphones. Two channels for the MIC. #7 is reserved for future use to control Headphone amplifier and #8 is a key. What happens when you connect them?
