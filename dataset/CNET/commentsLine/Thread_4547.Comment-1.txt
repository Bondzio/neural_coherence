hello i have this line ftp 21 21 tcp 21 21 192.168.1.150 on the dsl-2640b for port forwarding and the router is still not forwarding to the ftp server serv-u administrator in the corresponding computer with internal ip 192.168.1.150 firewalls are not enabled in the computer 192.168.1.150 either in win xp or in the eset antivirus which is currently installed.
so, i do not know what the problem might be.
i do want to use ftp from the internet to connect to the pc 192.168.1.150 what i know is that the ftp server is working locally if i do ftp 192.168.1.150 but it is not working when i use the router's static ip address.
any idea?
thanks
