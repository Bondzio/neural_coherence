I know AMD will tell you fans are needed for removal of heat.
They will also tell you the best placement for the additional fan(s)I know for the AMD barton 2800+ I have a front case fan was a no no.
So, I have the heatsink fan, the Powersupply fan and one large rear case fan.
No worries so far and thats been 2 years now ) Jim
