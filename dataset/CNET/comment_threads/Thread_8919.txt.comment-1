For the past couple of months my Windows ME had been getting slower and slower and freezing up in spite of the fact that I keep Temp files cleaned out, AV & Spybot S&D updated and regularly use other utilities.
Yesterday I noticed the Desktop clock began slowing down.
I installed a new CMOS battery, checked BIOS settings and restarted.
Now the system and programs run faster and more dependable than in the passed year and system resources hold up better.
It's a 4 1/2 year old Gateway 800 running the OEM Windows ME.
Could the new CMOS battery be the cause of the sudden upgrade in performance?
Not complaining, just curious.
