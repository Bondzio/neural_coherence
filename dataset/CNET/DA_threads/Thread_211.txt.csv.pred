1.1.1	G'day , I have a Western Digital Home Basics eSata/Firewire/USB2.0 enclosure , which had come with a 1TB & quot ; Green & quot ; SATA drive .	St
1.1.2	I had hoped to put a 250GB Maxtor MaxLine II SATA drive into it - the one that had been inside my Power Mac G5 .	St
1.1.3	But , when a firewire cable is connected , the drive light just flashes on/off at about 1 second intervals , and with a USB cable connected the light stays on full , but both options fail to mount the drive , or even make it visible to the computer - although Disk Utility does take a long time to decide it ca n't see them ... ( ie as if it 's trying ... but fails ) Any ideas how I can get the Maxtor to work in there ?	Ques
