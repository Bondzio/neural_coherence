i have two pc's, one desktop and one laptop, they work fine together when they are using the internet, but when i go online with my ps3, and the laptop connects, the ps3 disconnects, i'm thinking about the port forwarding feature, but i don't know how to use it, i connect to the router wired with the ps3 and wirelessly with the laptop, so why.
i use the netgear wgr614 v6 router, updated to the latest firmware.
i just can't think of anyway around this other than port forwarding, someone help.
