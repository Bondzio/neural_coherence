I have PC's, Switches, Router, Cable Modem I want to install a Firewall (one of the intention is to control where the users can/cannot go) Question: What is the best way to make a LAN connection?
PC's --&gt; Switches --&gt; Router --&gt; Cable Modem (where do I install the firewall?)
PC's --&gt; Switches --&gt; PC (2 NIC) (firewall here?)
--&gt; Router(?)
--&gt; Cable Modem or maybe I need different PC/Switch/router setup?
OS is Windows XP SP1 with most of critical update.
Any information or suggestion?
Thank You
