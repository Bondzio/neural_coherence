yes, the wan port on router 2 is unused.
router 1 is connected to one of the lan ports on router 2. this is how various articles described this setup, and it works.
to be precise, the articles also said that i had to set the ip address of router 2 to something outside router 1's range, and i had to disable dhcp management on router 2. i did not do either of those, and everything works.
i won't worry about it until i encounter problems.
anyway i solved my problem.
like a bonehead, i had the lan connection disabled on my computer.
when i re-enabled it, i was then able to log in to router 2 and configure it.
