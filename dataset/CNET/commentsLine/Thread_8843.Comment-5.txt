thank you.
that is very useful information.
unfortunately, it does not work on my os, which is vista home premium.
as a matter of fact, not much else works on this version of vista, at least not for me.
i bought a new media center pc from hp back february 20 (2007) that came with this version of vista and right from first boot-up, some of the standard primary functions (such as help and support) did not work.
after a month of going back and forth with hp on all of the failing issues, including having to send the pc back twice for repairs - which they could not fix, they replaced that computer with a new media center pc.
to my horror, that one is now having nearly the same failures.
it seems more likely that the culprit is vista home premium (at least on this kind of system) than getting two lemons, back-to-back, from hp.
is anyone else having problems running vista home premium on an hp media center pc?
