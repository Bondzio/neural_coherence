i'm not familiar with the dell 8200. i read some time ago about the nvidia 6800 card being a little long and may not fit in some dell and other computers and also may require depth space.. like having the pci slot under it vacant for space & cooling.
i know i mentioned the 6600, but can't remember if that applied since it is also a fairly new card.
gee, $200-$300 will buy a good card.
i suggest the nvidia 6600gt 128mb agp8x card that newegg has from $189 to $229:  what i did when i purchased my last card was find out how long the new card was, then opened the pc cover and measured the space where the current card is.
another thing with some computers is that these new cards may require a higher wattage power supply, if your current one is not at least 300w.
the next suggestion is the pny fx5700ve 256mb agp8x,4x which has 400mhz clock speed that best buy sells for $159.99.
the advantage there is that you can talk to the sales clerk/and or one of their 'geek squad' about them installing it (for a price) and if it doesn't fit they should take the card back without a stocking charge or damage.
