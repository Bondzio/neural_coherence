<s> I have a wired home network between 2 desktops using NetGear router. </s>
<s> Replaced the client desktop with new. </s>
<s> Now I continue to get this &quot;unplugged&quot; message and have done absolutely everything I can think of to make this work. </s>
<s> I have no internet on new computer while the host computer is fine. </s>
<s> Yes, I have checked the connections and everything is hooked up properly. </s>
<s> The connection wizard does not help. </s>
<s> 1) switching the working PC to the non-working port with the non-working cable. </s>
<s> 2) Try another port on the router for the non-working PC. </s>
<s> I switched cables and still have a &quot;network cable unplugged&quot; message. </s>
<s> The port connected to new computer does work when connected to the original computer so the port does not seem to be the problem. </s>
<s> This connection has worked perfectly with my old Dell. </s>
<s> I only replaced towers, no cables or other items. </s>
<s> I just can't find a cure. </s>
<s> by cycling the power off and on. </s>
<s> This may update a stuck DHCP client list. </s>
<s> If the network works fine in spite of the notification, read http://www.windowsnetworking.com/articles_tutorials/Disable-Media-Sense-TCPIP-Windows-XP.html to turn it off. </s>
<s> I've fixed it dozens of times myself and it's always been the motherboard and lan drivers. </s>
<s> Remember that if you ever accepted a Microsoft Windows Update Driver, then I think your only exit is a total OS install or the above off setting. </s>
