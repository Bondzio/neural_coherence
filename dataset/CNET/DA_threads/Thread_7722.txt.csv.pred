1.1.1	Hey all!	St
1.1.2	I'm a long time PC user and I decided to go for a build of my very own.	St
1.1.3	Any thoughts on these components going together?	St
1.1.4	Suggestions on better prices or parts?	St
1.1.5	THANKS IN ADVANCE!!	St
1.1.6	Board: ASUS P8Z77-I Deluxe $189 Chip: i7 3770k $310 Power: Corsair Builder Series CX 600 Watt Case: generic $29 RAM: DDR3 1600mhz 16gb $108 HD: 1TB WD 7200rpm $67 Blu-ray combo drive $70 OS: Windows 7 or 8?	St
1.1.7	$100 I'm thinking of just using the built in videocard on the motherboard for now...	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	What are you going to use this machine for?	St
1.3.2	That mobo is one of those super small things.	St
1.3.3	If &quot;case generic&quot; is a mid tower you might want to shop for an Atx mobo.	St
1.3.4	If &quot;case generic&quot; is one of those mini things you might find that psu does not fit.	St
1.4.1	This is the one I was thinking of.... http://www.amazon.com/GAMMA-Classic-Interior-Chassis-Black/dp/B002UDK9U6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=2AXHPMAJ1T8O5&coliid=IOYXMVOJ03ZB3	St
1.5.1	That case supports an atx mobo.	St
1.5.2	Bin that itx thing.	St
1.5.3	Shop for an atx size.	St
1.5.4	http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007627%20600093976&IsNodeId=1&name=LGA%201155 Pick one with the features you want.	St
1.5.5	Atx.....not micro atx.	St
1.6.1	take a look at the MBs on this list.	Sug
1.6.2	The one you picked will work ...however, why limit your options for more RAM...maybe 8GBs now and 8GBs later or other peripherals....like a better sound capability or perhaps a second GPU.	Sug
1.6.3	http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007627%20600093976&IsNodeId=1&bop=And&Order=RATING&PageSize=100 Re cases....Bob is right there too...you never want a slimline or micro case.........they look great great but once you realize how small and cramped they are and sometimes poorly ventilated ...the sooner you realize the error for now or the future.	St
1.6.4	Let us know how it works out.	St
1.6.5	VAPCMD PS....In the future, suggest providing links to the products you want advice/feedback on.	St
1.6.6	Again the MB you selected will work but may not be best for later as you fill out or expand the system.	St
