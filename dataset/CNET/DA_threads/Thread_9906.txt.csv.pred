1.2.1	Quick answer , visit the website : http : //www.crucial.com and enter your PC info and it will report what it supports in ram .	St
1.2.2	http : //esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-home.pl ? mdl=PCVRX850 & amp ; LOC=3 & amp ; session_id=b181d29fbc6b25624cc8b9569750a1dd # /howtoTab The above Sony support webpage for your model # PC , offers it came with Vista and P4 type cpu .	St
1.2.3	Under these conditions , it will support for a 32-bit OS , upto 4gb of ram .	St
1.2.4	Yes , it report 4gb of ram but will only use 3.3gb due to 32-bit limitations .	St
1.2.5	Since this is a P4 type cpu , it wo n't be upgradable to 64-bit OS , should you think that or it wo n't be the best option .	St
1.2.6	When it comes to ram , practically all makers supply the ram needs and allocation of what it accepts in the manual or support website , visit it .	St
1.2.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I did a quick review of the specs offered by the support webpage .	St
1.3.2	They point only to 1.5gb of ram can be installed .	St
1.3.3	These are PC-2100 ram sticks .	St
1.3.4	Newer ram is much faster and can be installed or be offered 4sale at higher speed .	St
1.3.5	This is a physical limit the mtrbd .	St
1.3.6	support probably to bios constraints .	St
1.3.7	Though you can actually installed 3x1gb sticks , the bios will allow only 1/2 of that amount per stick .	St
1.3.8	What maybe possible is to look for the status of the bios present .	St
1.3.9	If a later bios update is available it *may* address ram increased amounts , then and only then will it accept a full 3gb of installed ram .	St
1.3.10	Because , your PC is dated it 's worth looking into , but again because it dated , support has long passed for anything current .	St
1.3.11	good luck -- -- -Willy http : //www.docs.sony.com/release/specs/PCVRX850_mksp.pdf	Polite
1.4.1	Thanks for everyone 's feedback .	Polite
1.4.2	I happen to have two spare sticks of 1 GB RAM that I think is compatible with the Vaio , and which would nominally increase the RAM from 1.5 GB to 2.5 GB .	St
1.4.3	So , I think I 'll do a & quot ; Hail Mary & quot ; and plug those two 1 GB sticks into the PC and see what happens .	St
1.4.4	I will report back in the next day or so on what happened as a result .	St
1.4.5	By the way , I installed the Linux distro Kubuntu 11.10 onto the Vaio as the OS .	St
1.4.6	Willy -- I have no experience in updating BIOS , but might consider trying that after seeing what happens with the upgrade to 2.5 GB .	St
1.4.7	At any rate , this Viao PC is just an extra PC that I can experiment with , and if things go bad with it , it 's not really a problem .	St
1.5.1	I replaced two of the three 512-MB sticks of RAM with two 1-GB sticks , increasing the total RAM from 1.5 GB to 2.5 GB .	St
1.5.2	( As mentioned earlier , the Sony specification for this PC is 1.5 GB maximum . )	St
1.5.3	When I started up the computer , the BIOS recognized all of the installed RAM , as & quot ; 2560 MB. & quot ; However , the computer then produced a much louder operating sound -- a loud whirring -- than before .	St
1.5.4	It sounded like the system was overclocked and straining .	St
1.5.5	That obviously was not good .	St
1.5.6	After I had the PC shut down for about a half hour , I restarted it , and got an excessive temperature warning in BIOS .	St
1.5.7	Even after the 1/2-hour shutdown , the CPU temperature was at 76.5 degrees C and highlighted in red type -- so the system had a lot of thermal inertia .	St
1.5.8	I decided not to endanger the PC further , so I removed the two 1-GB RAM sticks , and re-installed the original two 512-MB RAM sticks they had replaced , for a total of 1.5 GB of RAM .	St
1.5.9	Well , this was a learning experience !	St
