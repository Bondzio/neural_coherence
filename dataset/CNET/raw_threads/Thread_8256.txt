I took out one of the 258Mb sticks and put in the 1Gb stick. I put my case back on, and booted up my machine. The BiOs told me I had new RAM, and I got to the Windows Xp login screen. I logged in to my user account, and it ran for a few seconds. However, then a blue screen came up, and my PC shut down. Could anyone tell me a solution for this problem? Thank you.
