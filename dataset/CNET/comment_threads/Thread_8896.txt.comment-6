I have bought systems from Monarch Velocity Micro, and Hypersonic.
The rest are high end gaming systems that roach wants.
You won't get a high end system from Compaq.
You will only get them from builders such as Falcon Northwest which is an extremely reliable company.
My friend had a problem with his optical drives.
He sent it back to them and got it fixed within a week.
I have never bought from Overdrive.
Their systems are top notch and I have read tons of magazine articles commenting Overdrive for their overclocking and keeping everything stable at the same time.
