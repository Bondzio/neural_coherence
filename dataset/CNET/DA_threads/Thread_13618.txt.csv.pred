1.1.1	I have a Brother MFC-440CN multi function printer, which is network capable.	St
1.1.2	I use an Ethernet cable to connect it to my D-Link DIR-825 router.	St
1.1.3	But printing a test page does not work.	St
1.1.4	The D-Link people say I have to get the following from Brother: PCP port # & UDP port #.	St
1.1.5	I'm on hold so long with Brother that I thought I'd ask this forum how to get those numbers.	St
1.1.6	The D-Link people said I also have to know how to set the following in my printer: static IP address subnet mask default gateway Does anyone know how to do this?	St
1.1.7	P.S., I'm running Vista Home Pro 64 bit on a Dell XPS 1530 laptop.	St
1.2.1	No, I don't know how.	St
1.2.2	I do know that the MFC-440 is not listed at http://www.brother.com/E-ftp/windowsxp/us.html and a few other places.	St
1.2.3	As such my advice is to pack it up and return it since we can't find XP 64 drivers.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	To make sure your PC can communicate with the Brother printer, you'll need to know the printers IP address.	Sug
1.3.2	This can be done by printing out a configuration page from the printer console.	St
1.3.3	Once you get the address, can you ping it from the PC?	St
1.3.4	As far as port #'s, I wouldn't be concerned with this unluss your trying to reach the printer over the Internet via a router.	St
