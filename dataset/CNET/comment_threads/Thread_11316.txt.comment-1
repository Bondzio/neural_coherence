I live in a large two story house with an upstairs office at one end of the house and a downstairs office at the opposite end.
The cable enters the house on the second floor and I have used a DI D-link connected to the cable modem to transmit a signal to the downstairs office for a second computer.
When I started frequent dropped signals downstairs I installed a Netgear in the wall plugs near the cable modem connecting to the downstairs.
That seemed to help but I later added a much longer aerial extender to the D-Link wireless router.
I have decided to get an up to date wireless router to see if I can stop the dropped connections.
I need advice on which one to buy for consistency of connection over a large area of the house.
