I would like to place it in my living room in a networked environment to replace my DVD player, home stereo, PVR, and theatre while also serve as a home computer for burning CD's, productivity, and occasional gaming. What is the image quality for watching TV, DVD's, etc? Are they easy to use and intuitive in design? I am considering at systems running Microsoft XP MediaCenter OS. It looks as though Gateway's 901x is the front runner at this point, but Shuttle also makes a model interesting as well. Any experiences, info, or opinions are appreciated. Thanks, -Shawn

If you want the specs let me know. Oh yeah I bought it at Costco and it is a special package you can't get anywhere else, not even Gateway. The Media Center is a fun thing to have.
