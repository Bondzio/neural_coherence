<s> Pardon what may appear to be a &quot;stupid&quot; question but a flat panel LCD monitor with built-in speakers; it's not necessary to hook up the speakers on the monitor is it? </s>
<s> Can you use your current speakers instead and the monitor will function normally (in terms of video quality)? </s>
<s> You don't have to connect the speakers at all, and nothing will be the matter with that. </s>
<s> Just make sure the volume is kept turned all the way down on the monitor (if it has a volume setting) and ensure that the connector doesn't touch anything electrical (it will cause the speakers to hum). </s>
