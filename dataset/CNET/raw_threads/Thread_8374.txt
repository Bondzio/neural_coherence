Some folk forget what they did but the short list I use is motherboard, then audio, then video then other drivers. If you want to try something quick, unplug the stick and boot safe mode to remove the item in device manager. Reboot normal and then install the stick per the maker's instruction. Bob

I've lost count of it failing and then I delete/remove it in safe mode, then install the drivers on the next boot then finally plug it in. However your post seems to omit the motherboard driver install. Not much has changed with Windows installs over the years. Seems a shame MSFT never corrected this. Bob

Worst case, you blow do a fresh install again but collect the ASUS drivers for your board from their web site. Chipset drivers should be the first to be installed as other drivers may depend on getting these right.
