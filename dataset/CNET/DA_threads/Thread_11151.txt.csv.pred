1.9.1	The updating of firmware is a well known way to kill off the ability to use the OEM versions of Nero.	St
1.9.2	You now know why this happens.	St
1.9.3	-&gt; The only fix I've found is to go back or scrub the drive clean of any sign of Nero then install their latest RETAIL version.	St
1.9.4	Any OEM version may not do here.	St
1.9.5	Thanks for the final clue.	St
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	i had updated the cd rw but the dvd still with the orginal fireware what can i do about the dvd ?	Ques
1.11.1	This is the bane of the OEM versions.	St
1.11.2	They seem to do odd things when firmware or drive change.	St
1.11.3	Glad we've found it.	St
1.11.4	Since you don't have the full retail copy look to freeware DVD and other creation/burning programs.	St
