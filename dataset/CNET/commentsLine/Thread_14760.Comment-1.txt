being received from a canon mp830 ... i've always had hp printers until last week, and those hp printers had a setting to block junk faxes ... if there was a number shown on the incoming fax.
i cannot find any info re doing this with the canon ... either in the user's guide or in their online help.
does anyone with a canon know if this is possible?
thanks.
