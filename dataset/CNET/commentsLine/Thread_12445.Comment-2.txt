as your stated requirements are basic, pop along to your local radio shack and pick up a pair of powered speakers.
the speaker outlet on the g4 is a standard size, 3.5mm i think, so you will have no problem finding a pair.
try to avoid any that are powered by the usb port as this not only ties up a port that you could otherwise use, but also draws power away from any other usb devices you have connected.
a reasonable pair should not cost you more that $20 p
