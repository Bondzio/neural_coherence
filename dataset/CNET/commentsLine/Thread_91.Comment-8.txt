come on, a 500gb hd for $10.
it reeks of a possible failure if only worth is $10 for parts.
to believe it'll work for any length of time is less likely on its own.
remember, if it sounds to good to be true, then its not.
however, you an play with parts all you want as you can be capable of some repairs, provide you treat this as a learning experience.
good luck tada -----willy
