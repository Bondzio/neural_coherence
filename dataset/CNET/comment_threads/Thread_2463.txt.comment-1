I have both IR and RF devices that I want to control with my ipad using it as a remote control.
I have been able to replace my IR remotes but now want to be able to do away with my RF remotes as well.
Can someone tell me how to take the RF signals from my various remotes , and be able to channel through some device and then through my iPAD then to the appliance?
Is it possible?
