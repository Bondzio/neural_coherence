As one of many being totally confused as to which Tablet to buy, after all the usual attempts to eliminate potential &quot;bombs&quot;, the one question I have been unable to have answered, properly is when looking at machines available how do you know if it will have an up-grade from ICS to JB.
What has further confused me is just one hour ago reading a punter,s review of a Samsung machine with ICS and he was able to up-grade to JB himself using Kies.
So, before buying a particular machine which only carries ICS, how can you tell if an up-grade is possible?
