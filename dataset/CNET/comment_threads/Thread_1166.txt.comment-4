No, It can't be any of these things, i have tried several PSU's, and the current is for a Pentium 4, so there should be no problems there, and the case has 4 Case fans and a better than stock Fan/heasink, so my CPU is only 40oc, I was given an Idea about Hard disk rotation speed, any more ideas?
No leaks capacitors e.t.c
