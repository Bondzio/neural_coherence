<s> I have two Rev-A Bondi iMacs, both pre-owned by different users. </s>
<s> Their spec is identical, and all the components are original. </s>
<s> So why is it that one CD-ROM drive will recognise CDRWs, but the other won't? </s>
<s> CDRs are no problem, and it doesn't make a difference if it's Mac OS standard or ISO 9660. </s>
<s> I've checked the extensions, software, control panels, everything I could think of! </s>
<s> What am I missing? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help so far! </s>

<s> Well, My Dear Watson, this may be a case of dwindling Laser Power. </s>
<s> As the optical device gets older, it is not unusual for the laser to loose its original &quot;brightness&quot;. </s>
<s> It could also be that the lens is dirty. </s>
<s> I have a G3 that will NOT read Gold colored CD's! </s>
<s> You have not mentioned if the non-reading iMac can read commercially produced CD's. </s>
<s> You only mentioned CDRWs so the assumption is that it can. </s>
<s> Commercial CD's use a different technique in production, they are not all burned, many times they are either &quot;stamped&quot; or Layered. </s>
<s> If the CDRW is produced using a laser which is &quot;not up to spec&quot; there is a possibility that the &quot;pits&quot; are not being burned deep enough to register with another &quot;not up to spec&quot; CD reader. </s>
<s> A replacement CDROM can be had on eBay for a small(ish) sum and are quite easy to replace. </s>
<s> Hope this helps P </s>
<s> Sorry, you did mention that CD's were not problem. </s>
<s> That just leaves the underpowered laser in the iMac or the underpowered CD burner making the CDRW's. </s>
<s> Could you try a CDRW from a different source? </s>
<s> I would still lean toward the iMac CDROM though P </s>
<s> I tried a CDRW from another burner, so that wasn't it. </s>
<s> But waning laser power on the iMac, makes sense - considering its age and the previous owner's frequent usage, deduced from clues he left on the hard drive ;0) I don't need it to read CDRWs, as I only bought it to fix the other iMac (failed power supply). </s>
<s> I just couldn't work out why they behaved differently, given that they were the same spec. </s>
<s> Many thanks! </s>
