Basically my wife has a notebook and has a wireless card for 802.11 B On the desktop I have DSL router from bell south hooked up to a ethernet card. The desktop is more for my gaming and she likes to be in the dining room online surfing the web so what would I need for her to just get enough to surf the web but for the desktop to get mostfor gaming,also I like to have the option for password to only be able to use that signal to keep outsiders out.? In the future I might get the verizonwirelss card that recieves DSl speeds but its $80 a month and hooks up to the laptop is there a way for me to recieve signal fromt he laptop to surf the net for my desktop if I go that route later on?

If it is not, i.e., there is a modem and a separate broadband router, then your issue is quickly solved by substituting a new wireless broadband router for the old router. Despite the name, such routers do still have wired ethernet ports. If your modem is a combination unit, then you would still get a wireless broadband router, but you might need to make some configuration tweaks to get the combo modem unit to play nicely with the new kid on the block. Not a big problem, just you need to down with it and have a quiet chat about some new house rules... dw

I have the yellow ethernet wire from the westellmodem hooked to a PCI ethernet card. I thought a router was as easy as hooking that yellow cord instead of my card goes tot he router and from router to my ether pci card and at the same times shoots wireless signals around the house and my 80211b card on the notebook would pick the signal up?
