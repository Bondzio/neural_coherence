That would no doubt cost less than a new mobo.
And I apologize to everyone -- I had forgotten I posted this question earlier this month, and posted it again a couple of days ago (they say the memory -- mine, not the PC's -- is the first to go!).
In the meantime, I've found out my BIOS are uptodate, as well as all my drivers.
