<s> But when it first boots up it says, System failed due to CPU overclocking. </s>
<s> I've never changed the bios i did the troubleshoot in the bios and everything is in default/optimal. </s>
<s> So i have no idea what the problem is and i really would appreciate the help. </s>
<s> Thanxs sweety249 </s>
<s> Or did this start out of the blue? </s>
<s> What CPU do you have and what memory speed. </s>
<s> If you set the memory speed too high for the CPU's FSB that would be your problem. </s>
<s> Where did you get the CPU, possibly it is misbranded. </s>
<s> [a lower speed than advertised]. </s>
<s> What is the AMD Model? </s>
<s> Is it 2000+ or is it a 2400+ plus that runs at 2000 MHz??? </s>
<s> I assume that you know how AMD names their processors. </s>
<s> Waiting to hear more. </s>
<s> sweety, This board supports several CPUs' with a few exceptions. </s>
<s> Look on board for revision number and go here http://www.asus.com.tw/support/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx make sure that your CPU model by revision and BIOS matches. </s>
<s> Follow Ray's lead and give us more information: Custom build New issue Model of CPU Thanks Bill . </s>
<s> especially look at half-running roaring processor fan. </s>
<s> Looking inside at boot may ID where the roar is from, other than the neighbor's Ford. </s>
<s> Is it the CDrom drive? </s>
<s> Is it the power supply fan? </s>
<s> It was overclocked as running at the higher temperature, normal temp=normal speed; heat up makes the mobo underclock the CPU. </s>
