1.1.1	I found that many pictures on my PC were far too saturated with respect to red and orange .	St
1.1.2	I changed my color profiles to prophoto rgb , which helped out tremendously -- but only in windows picture viewer .	St
1.1.3	I do n't notice any difference at all in terms of desktop color .	St
1.1.4	The vista sidebar , thumbnails , and non-icc compatible programs all display the hideous oversaturated colors .	St
1.1.5	I mean , reds practically glow with a supernatural aura .	St
1.1.6	The monitor has been & quot ; calibrated & quot ; with visual tools ( not spending money on colorimeter ) and is accurate within reason with those tools ( gamma , brightness , and contrast ) .	St
1.1.7	Again , color is awful on the desktop and most other apps except picture viewer .	St
1.1.8	Hardware : HP Pavilion Elite d5100t ATI Radeon 4850 graphics card HP w2558hc monitor Let me know if any more relevant hardware is required .	St
1.2.1	I think I managed to answer my own question .	St
1.2.2	For anyone else who may be wondering the same thing or pulling their hair out over the matter , Windows Explorer is NOT ICC profile-aware .	St
1.2.3	So Vista/XP itself will not really manifest the color profiles , but your photos , etc .	St
1.2.4	in aware applications will ( like Windows Picture Viewer , Photoshop , etc . ) .	St
1.2.5	I confirmed the effects myself by looking at another very new system that features a Samsung T240HD monitor with an Nvidia GTS250 graphics card and it had a very similar cast to all images in Windows Explorer -- the same oversaturation of reds and oranges .	St
1.2.6	I guess this is more of a windows problem for now ...	St
