<s> I currently do all my work on a Mac but would like to switch to a tablet for at least half of what I do (it's a challenge to tote my laptop everywhere I need to go). </s>
<s> I'd like to find a tablet that is functional with spreadsheets like Excel or Numbers AND/OR can use a program or app like Photoshop (I don't need it for photo editing, but rather for creating simple backgrounds and designs with text and then saved in JPG). </s>
<s> Ideally I'd like both options, but I recognize that I might not be able to get everything I want. </s>
<s> I use Polaris Office on my smartphone but am not a big fan - perhaps it's because of a small screen or a poor phone? </s>
<s> - because editing is difficult and it's a challenge to retrieve my changes. </s>
<s> I'm using a Droid smartphone and really like things like Google Play. </s>
<s> But since everything I do is on a Mac am I better off with iPad just because of compatibility? </s>
<s> How easy is it to use Numbers on an iPad? </s>
<s> I also am with Verizon, so it would need to be usable with their 4G network. </s>
<s> Other needs are so simple I think any tablet would fit the bill: email, playing music, web browsing, some e-reading. </s>
<s> Thanks for any direction! </s>
<s> We have Numbers on the iPad. </s>
<s> But for photoshop you may have to consider a Windows 8 Pro tablet. </s>
<s> http://www.samsung.com/us/windows-8-pcs/intel-ultra-thin-tablets/ Notice the S pen? </s>
<s> I find many don't want touch features but the ability to draw on the tablets. </s>
<s> That means you want an S Pen. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The pen is definitely intriguing. </s>
<s> Although the cost is about the same as an ipad. </s>
<s> It looks like Photoshop Express is the only thing compatible with Windows 8 Pro - which as far as I can tell is only for photo editing. </s>
<s> Are there other apps or software tools that go beyond just photos? </s>
<s> (text on a designed background) Numbers on the ipad is a positive - didn't realize that was an option. </s>
<s> I assume the cloud is the easiest way to ensure changes are captured between devices? </s>
<s> And does that mean that Excel is available on Windows 8 Pro tablet? </s>
<s> But what does that mean for document sharing with my Mac? </s>
<s> &quot;It looks like Photoshop Express is the only thing compatible with Windows 8 Pro&quot; Windows 8 Pro can run the same Photoshop as you do on laptops and desktops. </s>
<s> This is the surest way to assure that you get everything you asked for. </s>
<s> MS Office is available and since it's Windows 8 Pro, you should be able to run Windows Office 2003 to today's current version as well as the free LibreOffice. </s>
<s> Can you define document sharing? </s>
<s> Here I just put my docs and such on dropbox and can access them on all my machines. </s>
<s> To me that's document sharing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> a quick search on the Adobe forum last night was only showing Photoshop Express, however after looking again this morning I see that Express is the latest news, not the only option. </s>
<s> So I recant that question and appreciate your correction. </s>
<s> Document sharing - in terms of compatibility between devices and retaining changes. </s>
<s> I've only used iCloud, Google Docs and Polaris Office to share files from one device to another. </s>
<s> I've been pleased with iCloud, horrid experience with Google Docs (it's a pain to import back to my Mac) and can only seem to share in one direction with Polaris. </s>
<s> After just learning that I can only print from an iPad using their special printer, that's probably not an option. </s>
<s> Right now printing isn't important, but it's a possibility in the future. </s>
<s> Looks like Windows 8 Pro is easy to install printer software. </s>
