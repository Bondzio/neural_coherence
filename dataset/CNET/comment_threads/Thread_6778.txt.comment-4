... We have a computer installed with a software application by our CCTV vendor.
This software application allows other computers in our LAN to open a browser, enter this computer's internal IP address, and then we will see a login screen.
Once logged in, we can view all the CCTVs installed in our company.
I don't know how the software application works though.
So my manager is thinking of mapping this internal IP with an external IP such that my boss can log in from home through his Internet to watch.
Is it really difficult?
Should I pay some experts to help me do this?
Or can we handle this by ourselves just by the mapping at the router?
