i have a broadband provider at a convention i'm attending who insists i purchase a separate ip for every computer i will be using (22 of them) and states that i can't use a router on their network or i'll screw it up.
i know the latter is likely bs, and they just want me to pay for ips, but i run a file server so need to run a router for the broadband connection or i can't get the computers both seeing the file server and accessing the internet.
the connection is a shared pipe, where we lease a certain amount of bandwidth and ips for the week.
can the provider detect my router if i run it anyway?
