<s> I came home from a business trip yesterday and my laptop (IBM Thinkpad w/Windows XP)won't connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I have a wireless network set up (D-Link), with a hard-connected PC and my son's Gateway laptop. </s>
<s> Everything was working fine when I left, and my laptop worked fine at the hotels and airport yesterday. </s>
<s> Now it won't connect, although the pc and my son's laptop are having no problems. </s>
<s> I paid for the airport wireless connection yesterday - could that have reset or screwed something up in my settings? </s>
<s> I've tried everything I can think of and am at my wit's end. </s>
<s> On the task bar, it says I have an excellent connection, but when I open the wireless networks, it says &quot;not connected&quot;. </s>
<s> I've tried the Windows &quot;repair&quot; button, but it says it can't connect. </s>
<s> Any suggestions greatly appreciated!!! </s>

<s> hello, There are a number of things to try 1 - disable and re-enble your wireless network card 2- some Laptops have a manual turn on/off wireless 3- on the keyboard there maybe a symbol for the wifi, press it and see 4- check to see if you are getting a valid IP address, if it anything like 169.254.xx.xx then this is a self assigned IP address, you need to look at your browser settings 5- Also check your router settings </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> When I go into IBM Access Connections/Connection Status, it says &quot;IP Adress Not Assigned&quot;. </s>
<s> Shouldn't there be one there and if so, how do I get it? </s>
<s> Also under Diagnostic Tools, the IP Address shows as 0.0.0.0. </s>
<s> I am obviously not an expert on this . </s>
<s> Just enough knowledge to be dangerous. </s>
<s> The profile I'm using is set to obtain an IP address automatically... </s>
<s> try going to start&gt;connect to&gt;... or control panel and then network connections and view your wireless adapter, right click on it and go to Properties. </s>
<s> On the tab at the top, click the ine that says &quot;Wireless Networks&quot; and check the box that says &quot;Use windows...&quot; If there is a native router on it click on it to select and this should at least help you connect. </s>
<s> If that doesnt work then using a thumb drive you can copy the network settings from the wireless laptop that works and then using it on your laptop. </s>
<s> Hope this helps </s>
<s> Problem fixed! </s>
<s> Yay!! </s>
<s> For whatever reason, Windows had decided to &quot;forget&quot; my WEP key (even though I had already tried once going in and reentering it). </s>
<s> Anyway, problem solved. </s>
