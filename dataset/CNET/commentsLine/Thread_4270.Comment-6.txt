1) you need to install streamclip...  and scroll up... 2) once in imovie, you can save as various formats and compressions.
quicktime files will include a &quot;.mov&quot; extension.
the version of imovie being used will depend on the export method, but the broad instruction is when you are in imovie with the project active, under file, select &quot;share&quot; or &quot;export&quot;... and follow the steps.
if the files are large because you want your clients to see good, high quality versions of the video in a window bigger than 2&quot;x3&quot;, consider subscribing to a file upload service like &quot;yousendit.com&quot;.
3) the sdr-h18 is a consumer-grade, hard drive based, camcorder and does not save in dv format - minidv tape based camcorders do - as do external hard drives like those from firestore.
if you have people paying you for video service, you would be wise to ditch this consumer grade, internal hard drive based, camcorder and move up (in video quality) to minidv tape.
no, this camcorder does not use firewire for video transfer, hence no dv port to which the firewire cable would connect.
4) &quot;mac&quot; is an acronym in computer networking for m edia a ccess c ontrol (among other things);  apple makes macintosh computers and an operating system nicknamed &quot;mac&quot; (not an acronym)...
