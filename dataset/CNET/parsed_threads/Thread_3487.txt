<s> hello- i recently put in a new second hard drive because my c disk was full. </s>
<s> ( my computer is a sony vaio i bought in 2001, i run windows xp.) </s>
<s> My question is: I cant tell which of the disks in my computer is the new one. </s>
<s> I bought the hard drive at a local computer store and it didnt come with any instructions or docs at all. </s>
<s> It shows disk:C, D, G,and H. The C i know isnt it. </s>
<s> and the D-i think it is a &quot;partition&quot;(not really sure). </s>
<s> (my cd & dvd is E,F) i need to format the new one(i guess) How on earth do i find my new one? </s>
<s> and no, i cant get any help from the place where i bought it-he is not very helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks, Lizzie </s>
<s> Some larger HD's won't work with older computers and operating systems, but there are solutions available. </s>
<s> What is the model name of the HD? </s>
<s> What is your operating system (and service pack)? </s>
<s> Click: Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management Double-Click: Storage &gt; Disk Management From there you can rt-click any HD and initialize, partition, and format it. </s>
<s> Like 'Linkit' suggested ...get to 'Disk Management' do a right click on one of the CDs....and change the drive letter to say &quot;R&quot;. </s>
<s> Then do the same to the other CD...make it &quot;S&quot;. </s>
<s> Shut down the PC and disconnect the new HDD. </s>
<s> Then reboot the PC to to see how the drive letters show up....you should have a &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; plus an &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. </s>
<s> If this is the drive line up ....open explorer and right click on &quot;C&quot; on type in a name for &quot;C&quot; in the label box. </s>
<s> Do the same for &quot;D&quot;. </s>
<s> Now shut down again and reconnect the new HDD..and see what shows up as other than &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; or &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. </s>
<s> Then you should be able to identify the new HDD and prepare (partition and format) it for use with your system. </s>
<s> Keep us posted VAPCMD Note: The reason I suggest changing the CD-ROM drive letters to R and S is to avoid the confusion that develops when you add a new hard drive or hard drives to the system... HDD takes precedence over the CDs in drive letter assignments...leaving unused drive letters beteween the hard drive(s) and the CD-ROM eliminates the CD-ROM drive letters from being bumped/changed in the future. </s>
<s> I didnt really understand any of your suggestions-lol-because my real problem is that i put in a new hard drive and cannot figure out which one it is, let alone use it! </s>
<s> (and yes i have looked all thru disk mang. </s>
<s> but dont understand it). </s>
<s> thanks again, Lizzie </s>
<s> Here's what I'd do... Go to the Windows &quot;Start&quot;... &quot;Control Panel&quot; &quot;Admin Tools &quot;Computer Management&quot; &quot;Disk Management&quot; Do a right (mouse) click on one of the CDs....and select change the drive letter to say &quot;R&quot;. </s>
<s> Then do the same to the other CD...make it drive &quot;S&quot;. </s>
<s> Shut down the PC (uplug it from AC power) and disconnect power or data data cable from NEW HDD. </s>
<s> Then reboot the PC to to see how the drive letters show up....you should have a &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; plus an &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. </s>
<s> If this is the drive line up ....open explorer and right click on &quot;C&quot; on type in a name for &quot;C&quot; in the &quot;Label Box&quot;. </s>
<s> If present do the same for &quot;D&quot;. </s>
<s> Now shut down again (unplug from AC power) and reconnect the new HDD..and see what DRIVES shows up other than &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; or &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. </s>
<s> Then you should be able to identify the new HDD and prepare (partition and format) it for use with your system. </s>
