<s> I'm trying to set up a home network and I don't seem to have done correctly. </s>
<s> I followed the instruction on CNET's weekend project to the last step but nothing seems correct. </s>
<s> The problems I'm having are not being to access the network and at times I'm able to do it. </s>
<s> Also, I can see all the shared files in all the computers connected to the network. </s>
<s> My network right now is comprised of three computers. </s>
<s> I have one laptop that is connected wirelessly to a linksys router and the other two are connected to the router through an ethernet wire. </s>
<s> I'm not sure which computer is the one that I need to make it the main pc (maybe that is the problem). </s>
<s> I setup the network on my laptop first and after I'm my two desktops. </s>
<s> Can anyone let me know what I'm doing wrong? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> If you read the story at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6122-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=198031&messageID=2129068 you see that most don't reveal enough details for the issue to be resolved quickly. </s>
<s> Even when asked. </s>
<s> And Microsoft isn't the problem either. </s>
<s> We inflict the setup with firewalls, forget to do some step and it's only a little struggle but it will work. </s>

<s> Since all the PCs have XP use the set home network wizard. </s>
<s> All of PCs the have be in the same workgroup, there is NO main computer in a per to per setup. </s>
<s> This is what you are setting up. </s>
