For example, I use JumiMouse, which is an iPhone/iPod app that allows you to connect to your computer at home over a network or internet connection. It works like Remote Desktop, except that it is faster and works on computers that can't use Remote Desktop, like mine. This program is supposed to work over the network and the internet, but it only works over the network for me. (JumiMouse has two parts: the iPhone/iPod app and a server program on my computer.) I have tried making my computer the DMZ server. Didn't work. UPnP is on. Doesn't make a difference (it's always been on). NAT is set to Open. Doesn't work. I have tried forwarding ports 53, 88, and 3024 to my PC. (This was for an Xbox 360 connection before I could set NAT to Open, it kinda worked, figured I'd try it.) Didn't work. I've read that it could be some firewall. The SPI firewall has been disabled for some time, so that can't be it. That's the only firewall I can see that is provided by the router other than the wireless password/encryption. This has all been done in tandem with each other. Still doesn't work. Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance. Computer: OS: Windows 7 Home Premium x64 Firewall: COMODO Internet Security Free Router: Netgear WPN824v1 Firmware version: 2.0.120

Since you have already mentioned that you tried forwarding ports to your PC, I will assume you know how to forward ports within the router. The ports associated with JumiMouse are not explicitly mentioned. However I found the following tip that may help you. PC should have a different listening port (e.g. 5720 & 5721). Set these in the Jumi Controller & enter the same port numbers in the &quot;Connection Settings&quot; in the Jumi App. Finally forward these ports in the Router. I hope that works. Take care.
