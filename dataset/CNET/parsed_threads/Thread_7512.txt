<s> I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for good quality webcams at the above price points? </s>
<s> I should say that my priorities are: (1) picture quality and ease of use (2) software (including in the box and connection) I have two girls (3 and 6) who do not see their grandparents nearly enough and I want them to be able to do so. </s>
<s> However, I have seen some really poor video from some webcams and want to have as good a quality going out (the system has an AMD 3000+ XP, 512MB, XP Home) as I can get (for the grandparents to view), while having at least better than average coming in (all systems meet the minimum requirements adequate for the purpose, based on specs I have seen for most webcams). </s>
<s> I haven't found any very recent threads on this, so I would appreciate your help. </s>
<s> Some webcams I have looked at online include the Logitech Ultra and Fusion, the Creative Live! </s>
<s> bunch, Microsoft's lifecams (found at BestBuy and others), and some other no-name/lesser brand webcams. </s>
<s> I guess this brings up recommended ways to connect the computers. </s>
<s> I guess the various IM clients and services, such as Skype, are the obvious choices. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for the best/biggest picture? </s>
<s> I'm willing to spend some money for a service, if it is worth it, but would prefer cheaper/free. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Best regards, Scott </s>
<s> No one has any recommendations on this? </s>
<s> Is there another forum I should be posting this information request on? </s>
<s> Too bad C|Net hasn't done a side-by-side comparison. </s>
<s> The technology seems to be hitting a price-point, power, connection speed, and need (with all the military families separated for an extended period) &quot;sweet spot&quot; in which this type of connection is both practical/needed. </s>
<s> Heck, *I'll* do a comparison if C|Net will pay for the webcams! </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated! </s>
