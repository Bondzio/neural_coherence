where at first you said you didn't have one.
these are cd's, right?
yes they can be burnt if you make a cd image first, then burn from the image.
why are you wanting to burn them?
except they are borrowed?
they should be allready labeled, 1 as system restore, which reformats the hdd, puts in the f10 partition, and loads the os.
2 is the driver and software cd, used next.
what happens when u try them?
