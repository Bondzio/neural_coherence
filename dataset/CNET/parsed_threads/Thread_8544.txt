<s> So i had a macbook (last gen) which didnt upload footage off of my dvx 100a(panasonic)3ccd, its a high quality camera and with the 512 RAM i assumed it wouldnt upload because of the file sizes. </s>
<s> I took that one back upon the relese of the new generation MacBooks with a gig of RAM and i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire. </s>
<s> if this doesnt work is there anyway i can get my macbook (not pro) to upload footage (programs, drivers???) </s>
<s> any input would be a great help as i need to upload footage because im going into film school in the fall. </s>
<s> its a mini -DV cam if thats anydifferent on a mac. </s>
<s> should work just fine. </s>
<s> 1) Computer is powered up, Mac OSX is running. </s>
<s> 2) Connect FireWire to camera. </s>
<s> 3) Connect other side of FireWire to MacBook. </s>
<s> 4) Power up camera with AC power supply attached and plugged into known working AC outlet. </s>
<s> 5) Camera needs to be in &quot;Playback/Edit&quot; mode. </s>
<s> 6) Launch iMovie HD. </s>
<s> 7) Name the iMovie project. </s>
<s> 8) Blue iMovie HD screen should appear indicating &quot;Camera Connected&quot;. </s>
<s> 9) Using controls in iMovie HD, rewind tape. </s>
<s> If already rewound, 10, Click Import. </s>
<s> What's not working? </s>
<s> I use a Sony HDR-HC1 hidef camcorder and do the above pretty regularly. </s>
<s> I have also connected (and transferred video) from Panasonic and Canon miniDV tape based camcorders... </s>
<s> camcorder... </s>
<s> I recently had a DVX100B connected to my Mac. </s>
<s> No special drivers required... </s>
<s> If you are using FinalCut, I can walk you through that, too - but it is pretty easy - it is all in the set up... </s>
<s> http://discussions.apple.com It is a GREAT resource. </s>
<s> On you DVX100 - what format were you shooting in? </s>
<s> iMovie does not recognize all - you need FinalCut for the good stuff. </s>

<s> The inability to import has NOTHING to do with the Apple Macintosh hardware you were - or are using. </s>
<s> The issue is that iMovie is a free, consumer-grade, relatively low-end video editing application. </s>
<s> If you were capturing in 24P or some other high-end, it was not designed to handle that. </s>
<s> You need FinalCut... </s>
<s> I don't know if Express will do - I've been using Pro (in the Studio bundle) for a bit, and it does pretty much everything. </s>
<s> I suggest a quick read through of http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/ http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/ Sorry for all the posts... hope they help, though... </s>
<s> The problem is not that iMovieHD is a &quot;Free&quot; program or that the Video is in the wrong format or even that Final Cut Express is required. </s>
<s> The problem is that the poster has, is themselves! </s>
<s> Quote &quot;i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire.&quot; Unquote This poster, apparently, has been trying to upload video from his camera by creating a method of his own. </s>
<s> I thought USB but this camera does not have USB, that I can see, and the Macbook does not have S-Video input. </s>
<s> The manual covers connecting with an IEEE1394 cable but the cable is an optional extra. </s>
<s> I think a little more information is needed as to how the poster was attempting to upload video. </s>
<s> Right now, I would say this problem is a PICNIC P </s>
<s> the problem with the last macbook i had was it said it could not read a camera other then the webcam... when i got the new gen a day ago i hadnt tried to upload yet... im doing so today in hopes that it works. </s>
<s> thanks to everyone who put in input </s>
<s> The third post in this thread should be all you need to do. </s>
<s> Hopefully you purchased the optional IEEE1394 cable for the camera P </s>
<s> Hi, I just recently purchased a Mac Pro with firewire as well as a Panasonic DVX 100B. </s>
<s> The Final Cut software is not recognizing the camera at all. </s>
<s> Can you please walk me through what you did in setup?? </s>
<s> I have the appropriate connectors, but am at a loss as to what else to do to use the editing software. </s>
<s> Are any drivers needed? </s>
<s> Any help appreciated! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> but try this. </s>
<s> Connect the camera using the, NOT INCLUDED, IEEE1494 cable to the firewire port of your Mac. </s>
<s> Note that the cable will have different ends on it, small for the camera end and a larger one for the Mac end. </s>
<s> Did you purchase this cable? </s>
<s> Assuming you have the correct cable, and it is connected, turn on the camera and set it to Play. </s>
<s> If nothing happens on the Mac, launch iMovie. </s>
<s> Yes, I know you have FC but this is just a test. </s>
<s> iMovie should show that a camera is connected and allow you to suck down the video from your, very nice, camera. </s>
<s> If all goes well and the camera is recognized, then you have a settings problem in FC. </s>
<s> However, it iMovie does not recognize the camera, you may have a problem with the camera. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
