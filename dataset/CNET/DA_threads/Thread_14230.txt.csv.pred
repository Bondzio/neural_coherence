1.1.1	I have at present a Top Field 120G recorder which is great however,apparently the TV stations are Broadcasting in different Mpixls which in turn reduces my storage capacity from approx 65hrs to 40hrs and once HD comes of age this will again be reduced further.	St
1.1.2	I know I could change the hard drive but top field in their wisdom(and quite rightly so) made it that the new h/d would need to be reformatted by their program.	St
1.1.3	Is it possible to attach a say 300G h/d recorder and thereby increase the storage capacity.Much appreciate any info.gowilco.	St
1.2.1	40 hours is pretty good for Tivo or DVR systems.	St
1.2.2	You ain't seen nothing yet about HD and recording so let's wait till next year to see what shows up.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for you reply	St
