really no, for what you do, all you really need is a new hard drive, and any good pc shop should be able to copy all your data from the 20 gig hard drive to the 160 gig hard drive and save the 20 gig for additinal storage, or leave it out all together.... if you're not a gamer and use the pc for only what you stated, a bigger hard drive is all you need.....
