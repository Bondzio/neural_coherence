1.1.1	Im planning to install a second hard drive and firewire card in my desktop PC .	St
1.1.2	My question is can I install both the second hard drive and firewire card at the same time ?	Ques
1.1.3	Or do I have to install and configure each of them separately ?	Ques
1.2.1	Some OSes such as Linux would not take issue with such an addition .	St
1.2.2	Microsoft 's Windows seems to trip over itself as we do this so I found it best to add one item at a time .	St
1.2.3	In closing , not all versions of Windows supports firewire and some versions of Windows needs patches for big drives .	St
1.2.4	The configuration of such is automatic except the hard disk partitioning and format .	St
