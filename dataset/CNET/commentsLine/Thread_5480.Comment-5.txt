does this tv have a monitor,or hdmi connector on it?
if so,you'll dig it...otherwise it's a fuzzy waste.
also,is your 9500gt built in the motherboard,or did you add it later?
look on the back of it...it probably has an s-video plug.
(hey guys,they have hdmi outputs on video cards yet?).
analog will drive you insane,and s-video will make ya beat your dog.
(maybe your 9500 has hdmi output,it resembles a usb slot) the fuzzy picture you get on your tv will dissapoint unless you run a lcd,plasma,or theater projector.they look as good as any pc monitor.
the number of pins in the connector used dictates how good the tv picture will look: 1)monitor:12 pins (lose job & girlfriend) 2)hdmi vs 12 pin?
(similar to 12 pin) 2)compsite:6 pins (never seen these) 3)s-video: 4 pins (begin to hate pcs) 4)analog: 2 pins (housecleaning is more fun) second: your video card can throw super hi-def in widescreen(16:9),or standard (4:3)...it's in the cards settings,and has nothing to do with whatever screen used.
note:monitors support limited resolutions,but far more than 640x480....unless your tv/monitor is ancient.
