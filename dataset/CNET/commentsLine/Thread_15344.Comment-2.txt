i no longer use the ethernet crossover cable as most new machines have auto mdx (see google).
setup and use of windows easy transfer has no involved or &quot;lot of&quot; set up.
we plug a cable from the old to the new machine, run easy transfer on each machine and enter some 6 digit number and then check off the items we want moved.
what could be easier?
