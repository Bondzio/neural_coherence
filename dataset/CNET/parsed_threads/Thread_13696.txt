<s> Hello - here is an odd problem that I appear to have temporarily fixed. </s>
<s> I have a 4-5 year old quad core Dell Inspiron. </s>
<s> I added 2 hard drives and set it up as Raid 1 for the C: drive. </s>
<s> It came with 1 GB ram, I added 2. </s>
<s> It had onboard video, I added a $50ish ATI Radeon. </s>
<s> It only has a 350 Watt power supply, so I knew I was pushing it a bit - but it's ran fine for 4+ years. </s>
<s> Typically I only shut the computer down once every week or two. </s>
<s> About two weeks ago, when I tried to power it up I only got a faint puff of energy and fan spin. </s>
<s> I pulled the power supply and had it tested - no problems. </s>
<s> I pulled all the hard drives, video, and memory out. </s>
<s> When I tried to power it up, it failed 1-2 times - but kicked on and issued mother board warning beeps. </s>
<s> I started adding hardware back and retrying. </s>
<s> It worked after every piece of hardware. </s>
<s> Eventually, I had everything back and it was working fine. </s>
<s> It ran for a week or so, but for some reason I shut it off. </s>
<s> When I tried to turn it on the next morning - same problem, faint puff. </s>
<s> This time, I pulled the hardware piece by piece and retried. </s>
<s> It didn't work until all the memory was out (last step). </s>
<s> But again, it fired up and beeped warnings. </s>
<s> I re-added the pieces again and it worked. </s>
<s> So, my problem is temporarily fixed. </s>
<s> If it happens again, I'll pull the memory first... but obviously that's not a long term solution. </s>
<s> The other weird part is that when I initally rebooted it and it worked - it forgot my SATA boot order. </s>
<s> I have 2 HDs raided for C: and a spare D: for junk. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this got hosed just because I disconnected the hard drives or if there is a problem in the BIOS or &quot;Intel Matrix Storage Manager&quot; that manages the raid. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone had ideas. </s>
<s> I can only assume there's something hosed up on the motherboard, but I can't see how plucking out and putting back the hardware magically fixes it. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> When the power supply ages and is near it's limits you see this. </s>
<s> You usually find the owner in some form of denial it can't be this since they have found workarounds that seem to get it to work again. </s>
<s> My tech buddies will nod and wait for it to fail totally. </s>
<s> This doesn't mean there are other issues such as BAD CAPS on other boards. </s>
<s> But nothing weird is going on. </s>
<s> It's a common end of life symptom. </s>

<s> A weak or poor aged PSU is the cause of many a problem. </s>
<s> Since, you've installed new added devices and its already 4+yrs. </s>
<s> old, well you have reached the limit. </s>
<s> It'll actually boot-up under repeated attempts but its really the overall strain of providing all the amps to get the drives going etc. </s>
<s> to pass a point where it will boot-up. </s>
<s> IMHO, as Robert explained I agree 100%, just replace the PSU before it causes some real damage, because if it fails it may take something with it. </s>
<s> Look at a generic 500W or better PSU, name brand being better. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> There are many fine discussions about old power supplies, BAD CAPS and more. </s>
<s> When I fit a replacement supply if there are no reasons to really pump up the Watts and amperes (as if they added a powerful video card), I'll look at the existing PSU, add 50 to 100 Watts to the old PSU wattage rating. </s>
<s> Further checks for size, connections and amperes are done. </s>
<s> We want the same or more amperes per rail of the bigger PSU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I appreciate the feedback. </s>
<s> I had searched quite a bit and didn't quite see this description. </s>
<s> Maybe I skimmed too much and didn't read enough. </s>
<s> I will go ahead and put a new power supply in and see what happens. </s>
<s> I guess I always thought it either died or lived. </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback! </s>
