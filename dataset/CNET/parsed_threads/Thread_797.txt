<s> I Have a hardwired local area network. </s>
<s> It consest of modem to rounter to switch to another switch. </s>
<s> My wife got a new laptop with wireless card. </s>
<s> She wants a wireless conection. </s>
<s> How can I come off of my switch to turn one port into wireless? </s>
<s> I looked for a wireless switch can find nothing but commercial stuff. </s>
<s> I was under the impression that if you added a router it would confuse the other router up stream or vise versa. </s>
<s> ANY IDEAS WOULD BE GREAT!! </s>
<s> THANKS </s>
<s> Use any of the common consumer broadband routers with wireless - your choice of brand. </s>
<s> I won't start a row here over which brand and model is best, you can research that easily enough. </s>
<s> When you get one, just substitute it for your existing wired router. </s>
<s> Be aware that nearly all the wireless routers in fact have the usual complement of four wired ethernet ports on the back too, so it will be a one-for-one swap of devices with your current router. </s>
<s> First you'll need to configure it for your particular ISP service, and then SECURE IT. </s>
<s> Securing your router is important, but often ignored. </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> 1. add a Wireless Access Point (WAP) to your current setup. </s>
<s> 2. replace the old router with a wireless broadband router. </s>
<s> I prefer replacing the old router with a wireless router. </s>
<s> Makes life simpler and often is less expensive than a WAP. </s>
<s> Look at your local computer stores, electronics stores, and office supply stores for the major small office/home office brands (Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, Belkin). </s>
<s> I meant to write that you have TWO OPTIONS: 1. </s>
<s> Add the WAP to your current setup. </s>
<s> - OR - 2. </s>
<s> Replace the old router with a wireless broadband router. </s>
<s> Ok..I see what your saying. </s>
<s> I think I will just at the Wireless point. </s>
<s> I know this sounds crazy but the network is already sensitive enough, lol, i would rather add downstream. </s>
<s> I am on my 2nd router in 3 years and about every 3 or 4 days it seems I have to reboot the router for unknow reasons. </s>
<s> I starting to wonder if its my ISP doing that somehow. </s>
<s> I know they would rather me pay an extra 10 bucks a month per IP address.. </s>
<s> ThANKS AGAIN </s>
<s> Adding a WAP to an exitsing wired network is common. </s>
<s> Many consider it a good idea to use the same brand of hardware to reduce problems and make any tech support calls a one-stop affair. </s>
<s> Sensitive network hardware? </s>
<s> I have seen such. </s>
<s> As to flaky routers and other network hardware, using the latest firmware upgrade usually solves the problem. </s>
<s> Spyware infestations have also become a common cause for when good connections go bad. </s>
