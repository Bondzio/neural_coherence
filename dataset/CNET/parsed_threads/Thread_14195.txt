<s> The first time happened when I was using my windows formatted external (FAT32 i believe) hard drive on my friend's mac computer. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what happen because it was working fine but when I took it home it didnt recognize the drive. </s>
<s> Windows was asking me to reformat the hard drive! </s>
<s> So I skimmed the internet, but i didnt even know how the problem occured. </s>
<s> I had no hope left so I boxed the 160 gig hard drive for storage in case one day I might be able to save my thousands of photos and music. </s>
<s> I bought a new hard drive and decided to forget the past and start fresh. </s>
<s> This time I bought a 200 gig hard drive and again, I chose Seagate. </s>
<s> The secound time happen a few days ago, I bought a new Mac Book Pro and wanted to transfer what ever I had on my Windows XP desktop to my new mac. </s>
<s> I was transfering some mp3 and pictures but then I stoped. </s>
<s> I pushed the button down on the front of the seagate and an alert signal poped up telling me that I incorrectly disconnected the external hard drive. </s>
<s> I then pushed ok and immediatly tried to reconnect the hard drive. </s>
<s> Now every time I do so I a pop up tells me that &quot;the disk you inserted was not readable by this computer&quot; and I can either Initialize, Ignore, or Eject. </s>
<s> I tried to load the hard drive on a windows and it shows up blank and asks me to reformat it. </s>
<s> ..... NOT AGAIN!!! </s>
<s> GAH! </s>
<s> Is there any way of saving my files with the file names! </s>
<s> I looked at disk warrior and it seems to only help mac formatted hard drive. </s>
<s> Data Rescue II would get my files, but I wan't my file names as well. </s>
<s> Is there a way of just restoring the directory.. or something so that I can return it to the way it was? </s>
<s> HELP! </s>
<s> Here I'm just copying files from a command line or sometimes explorer. </s>
<s> What's with that button? </s>
<s> Also, I wonder if the drive's housing has an issue. </s>
<s> Some overheat or have other issues. </s>
<s> Try a better case. </s>
<s> -&gt; In closing, FAT32 is going to mess up. </s>
<s> It doesn't have any fault tolerance but it's your only choice if you want a Mac to write to it. </s>
<s> Just remember it's a timebomb of a filesystem. </s>
<s> No fix is planned. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the button...?the button is to turn the external hard drive off and on. </s>
<s> I dont think heat is in issue, Im in an air conditioned room and on the box, the seagate claims that it was designed for cooling. </s>
<s> I wasn't writing anything to the hard drive, just coping files to my mac. </s>
<s> Unless something going on undetected... </s>
<s> I was planning to take everything off the external and then reformat it immediately. </s>
<s> I know seagate in the booklet says that sharing files between a mac and pc is not recommened but I didn't think this would happen.. well at least happen again. </s>
<s> You must eject the drive or shutdown Windows before removing the power. </s>
<s> FAT32's lack of resiliency is a big factor here. </s>
<s> Consider using that power switch as a bad idea if Windows is still running. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> you keep saying FAT32 [sucks] but can anyone at least tell me clearly wether it is fixable. </s>
<s> i don't know, i saw disk warrior can repair directories but only mac directories i disconnected the hard drive on a mac (you push and hold down the button till it beeps and the hard drive spins down). </s>
<s> usually its fine when you perform it on a windows but when you disconnect this way on a mac it becomes unusable. </s>
<s> i really need helpful replies please bob, your kinda helping but i already realized that I have to disconnect first for the second time (second failed hard drive). </s>
<s> can you at least tell if there is any hope of restoring the drive or is my best bet to retrieve the data, such as using data rescue. </s>
<s> i know data rescue II works but it doesn't come with the file names, i have thousands of pictures each organized, and thousand of (legal) mp3 rips from my CDs. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend thousands of hours relabeling them. </s>
<s> I'm in college and i don't have that kind of time for a while but i want some of the data now. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> I only am sharing that FAT32 is fragile. </s>
<s> Use of that old file system on USB drives will be exciting. </s>
<s> Have you tried Zero Assumption Recovery on that drive? </s>
<s> Also, why are files on such a drive that you can't lose? </s>
<s> I've shared that fat32 is fragile and you may have revealed you are attempting to use a fragile file system for &quot;storage&quot; or even worse &quot;backup.&quot; There's a lesson here. </s>
<s> I find some will not want to learn it any other way but firsthand. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I know you are wanting to have some shared portable drive from Mac to PC and FAT32 is one shareable file system. </s>
<s> But the lesson I learned was this. </s>
<s> To connect such a drive I do this. </s>
<s> Mac? </s>
<s> Connect with firewire. </s>
<s> PC? </s>
<s> Connect with USB. </s>
<s> While both should work on either the operative word in this is &quot;should&quot;. </s>
<s> I'm sharing my free lesson so you can use it if you can. </s>
<s> Maybe it will help, maybe not. </s>
<s> For now we just use those USB memory keys and networks to fling files around. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> well i knew seagate couldnt help me (says so in the warrenty that they take no responsibility for data loss) but i called them anyways, to see if they had a suggestion -they at least told me that it was probably a corrupt partitioning table but thats all he could tell me, and just told me to search google i was thankfull for that but anyone know of a data recovery program that will recover the filenames too? </s>
<s> or a program that will fix a corrupt partitioning table? </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=corrupt+partition+table&btnG=Google+Search It seems this happens too often. </s>
<s> If you didn't believe in backups... Bob </s>
