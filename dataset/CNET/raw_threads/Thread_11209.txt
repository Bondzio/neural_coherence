I have a sony vgn-aw125j that it's compatable with. I'm new to bluetooth, and didn't realize my laptop had it. I bought a logitech nano 450 before realizing i could have been able to avoid the dongel with bluetooth. TIA

Rechargeables would have me futzing with charging rather than just using the device. HOWEVER blue tooth mice have all exhibited an annoying trait that you have to wiggle them to get them to connect up and get going. That snoozing may save battery power but I'll take the v450 NANO models any day since the NANO receiver is quite small and I don't have that lag, wake up wake UP annoyance. Bob
