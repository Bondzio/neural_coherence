your suggested reference seems to cover hard drives, not flash drives.
i also experienced a sudden &quot;usb drive not recognized&quot; on my lenovo thinkpad laptop with win xp on a philips 4gb pen drive that had been working flawlessly for a year or two, losing access to the 3.75 gb of data stored on it :-(( tried on one other pc with same result.
any suggestions for a possible recovery?
