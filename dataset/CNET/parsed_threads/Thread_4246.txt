<s> My question is.. Would adding a decent HD graphics card be beneficial over onboard graphics? </s>
<s> I've heard that it will free up RAM, and help the CPU perform better but idk.. i dont game alot, but i do like HD video editing. </s>
<s> My computer is a SFF, and the best Low Profile graphics card deal i have found is a 2GB Radeon HD5450 card. </s>
<s> Current Specs: Dell Optiplex 755 SFF Stock Mobo Intel Q6600 2.4 GHz (SLACR, G0 Stepping) 4GB DDR2 RAM (bout to upgrade to 8) Windows 7 HP 64 Bit 1.0 TB WD Caviar Black SATA HD I capture Halo Gameplay with a Hauppauge HD PVR Gaming Edition, and edit with Sony Vegas Pro 9.0c </s>
<s> Provided you used the PC is question and found it lacking in video needs that choice is yours. </s>
<s> Yes, adding a new video card will free ram back for PC system use once the on-board video is disabled. </s>
<s> In most cases, you'll increase video capabilities beyond on-board which are basic or OEM requirements match. </s>
<s> i do suggest you review any new video cards specs and find out if replacing the PSU for for required needs(or better) and lets not exclude cooling as well. </s>
<s> Doing this for the new video card is best for continued use to become less problematic. </s>
<s> The more demanding the video card the more attention to details for the best overall operation becomes a MUST. </s>
<s> So don't discount this because it may work for some time then start to falter later. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> No about freeing up RAM. </s>
<s> Years ago they used to do that, today it creates too many support calls so I see most machines don't release onboard video ram. </s>
<s> Some BIOS may allow you to reduce it but the trend is away from such for a very simple reason. </s>
<s> Folks no longer want to tweak machines (most!) </s>
<s> So I have one more comment. </s>
<s> The 5450 is a good solution for those machines like you noted but the 2GB might be DDR2 RAM. </s>
<s> If so, get the slightly faster 1GB DDR3 card. </s>
<s> What game did you want to try that needed that 2GB Video Card? </s>
<s> Most of today's games are fine with 1GB. </s>
<s> And the games that want more would run poorly on this card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The 2GB HD5450 i ordered has DDR3 Memory </s>
<s> NIL </s>
