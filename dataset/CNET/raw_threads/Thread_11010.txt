I have found specs for the 128MB DDR3 version, but I cannot find any on the 256MB DDR version. If anyone has seen any specs anywhere, or has an idea where to find some, I would appriciate it. I am looking for stuff like memory bandwith, memory clock speed, core clock speed, verticals per second, texels per second, memory data rate... etc. Thanks.
