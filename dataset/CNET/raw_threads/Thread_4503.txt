I currently have AT&T DSL service, and I am using a Linksys WRT54G as my wireless networking solution. I also have a second WRT54G wireless router that I would like to add to my network. I would like to use the secondary unit as a wireless accesspoint on the other side of my house, so that I can connect various wired ethernet devices through one switch without running a cable across the house. So how would I configure the second router to be a wireless switch or accesspoint? Thanks for your help.

It already can be a WAP but you want it sans wire. Some models have a feature of being a repeater but not this one. Plus I often find the repeaters at the far end of the house when the PC is. That does not work either. The repeater sits about half way to the other PC... Bob
