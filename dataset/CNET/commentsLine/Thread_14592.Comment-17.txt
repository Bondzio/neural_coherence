when you are running a slower computer, with the smaller amount of ram you have to ask yourself a big question.
faster old computer with older windows type that you cant even get updates for anymore.
or have slower, small ram with a newer or newish windows?
weird question right?
not really if your stuck on cash your pretty much stuck.
with the old geezer 95, and win 98 they dont need to much to boot up, wether it be processor speed or memory 95 and 98 take less also less hard drive space taken up.
the newer the windows the more space it takes, and more speed and memory (ram) it needs to work.
the bigger the hard drive the more it can store but with bigger hard drives it takes ages for a slow processor to do anything and even worse once the hard drive is full or semi full.
it's amazing if your computer can get passed the windows startup.
*smiles nice big grin* if you want something that works and can get past the money problem (now or in time) get yourself a nicer newer faster computer.
heaven for me was a 1.?ghz processer with 80 gig... list goes on brand spankin new toshiba that just flew * (it was worth the wait it took to get the money for it) once windows start up screen came up a couple of enters and in 3 seconds flat i got threw the windows start up.
dont have money?
save up, forget about ur old stone aged computer (the more dough or things you put in it, it will be longer before you can afford a newer faster computer).
if it takes to long, get a spare job *smiles* afterall you can try every trick in the book but the older the machine the slower the processor is.
which altogether means *to slow to upgrade*
