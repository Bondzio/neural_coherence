1.1.1	I want to add a 1 GB memory module to my 256 MB Dell Dimension 2400.	St
1.1.2	(WinXP Home, SP3).	St
1.1.3	The machine supports DDR-266 (PC2100) and DDR-333 (PC2700).	St
1.1.4	I dont know which one is currently in it.	St
1.1.5	If I add a DDR-333 module will it work OK if the original module is a DDR-266?	St
1.1.6	If not, is there a way to find out what kind of memory it has?	St
1.1.7	*	St
1.2.1	or download cpu-z: http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php you can mix ram, but it will run at the speed of the slowest stick.	St
1.2.2	do not get ddr-400 since it can be problematic in PCs that don't explicitly support it.	St
1.3.1	PCs.	St
1.3.2	http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Dimension%202400%20Series Might be better to put the 1GB DIMM in the first slot and the old 256MB DIMM in the 2nd slot.	St
1.3.3	Good Luck.	St
1.3.4	VAPCMD	St
