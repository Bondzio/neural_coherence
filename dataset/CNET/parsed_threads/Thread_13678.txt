<s> I'm running out of space on my comp, and for various reasons am considering getting an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I've seen several 500GB drives on NewEgg.com for under $140 or so, but I would like to know what's a good one to get. </s>
<s> The main host computer currently only has a USB 1.1 interface, runs Windows 2000 SP4, has the 137GB limit, a Promise Ultra-100 TX2 IDE controller (not that it matters for an external drive), a MSI K7T266 Pro2 mobo, a 1.4GHz Athlon CPU, 256MB RAM, etc. </s>
<s> I don't know what (if any) hardware/software upgrade I will be able to do on this computer, but I am considering trying to get my dad (it's his computer - I don't have my own yet and can't afford it, especially considering the multimedia-intensive things I will be doing with it) to put in another GB or so of RAM, and upgrade to Windows XP. </s>
<s> I WOULD be willing to consider putting in a USB 2.0 and/or Firewire and/or SATA interface card. </s>
<s> I basically would like: fast transfer speeds - preferably no more than 10-15% slower than the internal 7200rpm 8MB buffer HDs. </s>
<s> (Note referencing above: comp has 1.1 USB interface, I'm willing to get an upgrade card) don't want to spend more than about $100-130 or so (plus no more than $15-30 for an interface upgrade card) I don't know that I need one-touch backup or things like that. </s>
<s> I will be using this as supplemental storage, not primarily as a backup drive. </s>
<s> A couple reasons I'm getting an external drive as opposed to an internal one are because there really isn't a whole lot of room left in the tower, and I often will want to take the drive with me and plug it into other computers (some of which may have lesser specs than our computer, btw). </s>
<s> (Also, we're running AVG Free edition (antivirus), which insists on scanning every single installed hard drive every single day (thankfully it lets you pause/cancel when it comes up, but it slows our computer down by a factor of 10 or more when it's running.)) </s>
<s> So what are some models I should look at? </s>
<s> &quot;preferably no more than 10-15% slower than the internal 7200rpm&quot; Even USB 2.0 is a fraction of your normal IDE speeds so there are no USB drives that meet your spec. </s>
<s> -&gt; However I find such to be quite useful. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So how slow IS USB 2.0 compared to IDE? </s>
<s> (keep in mind I'll be using it with a 4+ year old computer.) </s>
<s> Also, what about firewire, or external SATA interfaces / drives? </s>
<s> I DO need to be able to stream high-definition uncompressed audio and video, often multiple streams, for editing and viewing on my local machine, allowing for any bottleneck RAM / CPU / etc might present. </s>
<s> And, for a 500GB (or 400GB) drive, is there a level below which I should avoid (meaning drives more prone to failure, for example, not necessarily having fewer features), even if I have to up my budget to, say, $135-150 or so? </s>
<s> what do you think of the first two on &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010150414%20131021357%201310221309%201035920386&bop=And&Order=PRICE&quot; &gt;this newegg site&lt;/a&gt; - the Cavalry CAXM37500 and the Western Digital ES WDG1SU5000N, both 500GB with USB/eSATA interface? </s>
<s> Or is there something else I should look at? </s>
<s> (btw, the WD drive is pushing my price limit a bit, but if it's otherwise a really good drive I may be willing to consider it.) </s>
<s> Of course I'll need to get a USB 2.0 / Firewire / SATA interface card for our computer. </s>
<s> (And, I still have that dang 127GiB 28bit LBA to deal with...) </s>
<s> Do you run Windows? </s>
<s> Then I have to dismiss firewire. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> People bring me too many corrupted file systems. </s>
<s> However for the Mac you'll get firewire. </s>
<s> Let me wrap this up in a nutshell. </s>
<s> PC = USB 2.0, Apple = Firewire. </s>
<s> About SATA and eSATA. </s>
<s> The only problem here is the OS and drivers. </s>
<s> If you can find good support to get it working this it can be exactly the same speed as the internals. </s>
<s> I've seen some that never got it to work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Windows 2000 Professional SP4. </s>
<s> Dad may consider an upgrade to XP, but I don't know when/if (within the next year or so) that'll happen. </s>
<s> So with the software and hardware (plus an add-on adapter card (all we have now is USB 1) that we currently have, should I try SATA/eSATA? </s>
<s> And how much slower is USB 2 than internal IDE? </s>
<s> Are more than usual. </s>
<s> SATA came out long after Windows 2000 so you need to research not only if you can fit the SATA card but if that card has drivers for Windows 2000. </s>
<s> As to the USB 2.0 it's under 1/2 the speed of IDE. </s>
<s> This is why it didn't meet your criteria. </s>
<s> But since it's just nearline storage why would it matter? </s>
<s> I use mine and can play music, video just fine. </s>
<s> Why such a hard criteria on speed? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Oh, if it's only like as bad as 35-40% or so, whatever... </s>
<s> I could probably live with that. </s>
<s> When you said &quot;fraction&quot; in an earlier post I was thinking it was like 1/5 the speed or something like that. </s>
<s> I just need to be able to stream uncompressed video (at least 640x480 24bpp 30fps) and audio (44.1kHz 16 bit stereo, maybe more channels) to/from the drive in real time. </s>
<s> I was just looking on wikipedia, and the max burst speed of USB 2.0 is 480mbit/sec, or 60 mbyte/sec. </s>
<s> Would that be enough for the data transfer I'll be doing? </s>
<s> Also, is it possible to get a drive that maybe I'll use USB 2.0 for now, but later when I get a new computer I'll be able to take advantage of a faster interface? </s>
<s> go with sata; but get the controller with both usb2 and sata and that also applied to the external case as well. </s>
<s> Win2000 will work with sata (no problem here). </s>
<s> and I'm leaning toward USB2 & SATA on the controller AND ext HD. </s>
<s> Also, in case I want to use it with another device (don't have any right now though) that supports it, should I get a card that supports those PLUS firewire? </s>
<s> And, should I specifically get an external hard drive, or should I get an internal + USB2 / eSATA enclosure? </s>
<s> And, any recommendations on what specific model to get? </s>
<s> I looked at NewEgg, and they have a Cavalry CAXM37500 for $122.99 (- rebate + shipping & tax) and a Western Digital My Book Premium ES WDG1SU5000N for $154.99. </s>
<s> (They also have a Seagate FreeAgent Pro for $171.99, but that's more than I can afford. </s>
<s> I DO need to buy the adapter card too.) </s>
<s> Then... which add-on card to get? </s>
<s> ENCORE ENLADP-402 - $19.99 - 4 ext USB 2.0, 2 int SATA Koutech USB2.0 & FireWire & SATA Combo PCI Card Model IO-PC820 - $49.99 (more than I want to pay) - 2 ext firewire, 1 ext SATA, 2 ext USB ports Or is there another one I should look at? </s>
<s> I'd like to spend no more than $25-35 and get at least 4 - 6 external ports, distributed between USB 2.0 & SATA, with at least 2 of each type. </s>
<s> I am leaning away from firewire for now, cause I don't think I need it just yet. </s>
<s> I may have 2 available slots... should I get separate cards for USB & SATA? </s>
<s> : the $20 ENCORE card mentioned above, plus... BYTECC BT- PCI-SATA150 - $21.99 - 2 ext SATA ports (total combined price would still be less than the $50 card, and I'd have 2 each of internal AND external SATA ports.) </s>
<s> if my experience is of any indication, you won't be working with the usb at all. </s>
<s> It is too slow for my liking. </s>
<s> As for internal vs. external, internally you might save $20/$30. </s>
<s> Of course externally has its own advantages though. </s>
<s> ...cause I will be frequently moving it from PC to PC, and therefore it won't be plugged in all the time. </s>
<s> eSATA has not reached the point I would consider this. </s>
<s> With each machine you have to not only obtain the eSATA card and connectors but do battle with the OS to install SATA support. </s>
<s> If you haven't installed Windows 2000/XP onto a SATA drive you may be in for a rude shock. </s>
<s> -&gt; I also get the feeling you want to put a game that you want to run on various machines. </s>
<s> Even with the drive being portable the big problem is that with Windows programs rarely move with the external drives. </s>
<s> That is the owner installs an external drive, installs BattleField on it and then takes the drive to a friends house. </s>
<s> BF won't run! </s>
<s> Let me be frank, honest and offer my best advice here. </s>
<s> Go get your USB 2.0 card and your USB 2.0 drive and let it work without you heading down a dark path to a blind alley. </s>
<s> You will read those that will push eSATA but did they get it working on your Windows 2000 machine? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I would get a USB 2.0 card, just because that's useful for lots of things. </s>
<s> Then get a drive or enclosure that supports USB 2.0, and possibly also firewire and/or eSATA. </s>
<s> I have a 320GB WD 7200RPM IDE drive in a USB2/Firewire enclosure. </s>
<s> I normally use it with firewire and when i move between computers with firewire or usb it works fine. </s>
<s> I assume switching from eSATA would work just as well, but don't take my word for it. </s>
<s> So to sum up: if you want maximum speed, go with eSATA. </s>
<s> If you want easy compatibility and portability, go with USB 2.0. </s>
<s> I use firewire because I already have so many USB devices plugged in :P and it's about the same speed as USB 2.0. </s>
<s> One final tip: when you get everything bought and plugged in, make sure the firmware is up to date. </s>
<s> My enclosure was pretty unstable with firewire until i updated the firmware. </s>
<s> Now it hardly ever glitches. </s>
<s> (What was happening was during a large or continuous transfer randomly the transfer would hang and windows would say &quot;delayed write failed&quot;, so I'd have to unplug the drive and plug it back in and restart the transfer.) </s>
<s> LaCie drives can crash your PC on bootup, and support is the worst I've ever experienced. </s>
<s> There are many other manufacturers you could go with - Seagate, Western Digital, Maxtor, anything but LaCie. </s>
<s> For your hard drive. </s>
<s> I agree with above but I also dissagree with maxtor or western - well western may not be bad - havent heard much on it. </s>
<s> I live with seagate - I have some that have been runing for 10 years. </s>
<s> maxtor has a 13month avg. </s>
<s> life span. </s>
<s> ted </s>
<s> I am of the understanding that your motherboard has 4 USB 2.0 ports, and 4 USB 1.1 ports, no? </s>
<s> Anyway, you have a 66 MHz PCI controller. </s>
<s> Depending on the speed of your internal drive, you could get up to 200 MB/s transfer rate, compared with only 60 on USB 2.0. </s>
<s> On 1.1, it's much, MUCH slower. </s>
<s> Your transfer rate on a USB 1.1 port maxes out at 12 mbps, or 1.5 megabytes per second. </s>
<s> That's slooooooow. </s>
