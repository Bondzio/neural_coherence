<s> Hello all, I am trying to copy some files from an external hard drive to another drive. </s>
<s> At first I have to wait for a while as it says &quot;Preparing to copy...&quot; and then it copies very slowly. </s>
<s> After copying a few(different number every time I try) files, it gives me the following message: &quot;Cannot copy file: Cannot read from the source file or disk.&quot; I have also received the following message a few times while trying to copy: &quot;Cannot Copy [filename]: The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error.&quot; I am receiving these errors when I either copy to an internal Hard Drive or external Hard Drive. </s>
<s> I ran a check disk, and it came back with the following message &quot;Windows was unable to complete the disk check.&quot; I am very confused as I can access the files on the external drive, but it runs slowly as I try to open or navigate through the external drive. </s>
<s> Also, I am confused, because it lets me copy some of the files, but then at some point gives me a error message. </s>
<s> What can I do to copy files from the external hard drive? </s>
<s> I hope you can help me as I have some very important files on the external drive, which I ofcourse didn't backup. </s>
<s> Also, please let me know if there are other options available to me such as recovery services or recovery programs if I cannot solve it on my own with your help. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance!! </s>

<s> There's a small chance it's a problem with your PC (the USB-port), so try the same things you do now on another PC. </s>
<s> If that's OK, the external drive is OK. </s>
<s> The next small chance is that it's an issue of the electronics in the case. </s>
<s> That's easy to check by putting the drive in another case. </s>
<s> The most likely thing is that the disk has gone south. </s>
<s> The only solution then: replace it. </s>
<s> Try to get off as many files as you can, and if that's not enough find your creditcard and go to a professional data recovery company to do the others. </s>
<s> For the future: BACKUP! </s>

<s> I have multiple external hard drives though that are attached to the same usb port and they all work fine, so do you still think it could be a problem with the computer? </s>
<s> I'd concentrate on case and drive. </s>

<s> I have the problematic external drive plugged into one of two USB ports on the front of the computer, so I decided to plug it into a USB port in the back of the computer after what you said. </s>
<s> It works GREAT now! </s>
<s> Thanks you VERY much! </s>
<s> I really appreciate the simple suggestion that nobody else has offered. </s>
<s> I am currently backing up all the info onto another external drive that I have plugged into the second USB port on the front of the computer. </s>
<s> I am happy that it works now and I was able to avoid having to pay for file recovery, but I am confused as to why one of the two front USB ports is running correctly, and the other isn't. </s>
<s> Shouldn't they be connected? </s>
<s> Any Ideas? </s>
<s> Upon putting my second external drive into a USB port on the back of the computer, I noticed it's ALOT faster than the USB port in the front, so I now see that BOTH of my front USB ports are not running correctly? </s>
<s> How can I fix this? </s>
<s> Look inside your machine. </s>
<s> If you see 4 separate wires from motherboard to the front USB connection then it's USB 1.1. </s>
<s> You can complain to the machine's maker but this is how most machines were made. </s>
<s> The two front USB Ports worked before, so I'm not really sure what you mean </s>
<s> No one cares it worked before. </s>
<s> Wouldn't you want it to work from now on? </s>
<s> It ran fast before this problem came up so I don't see how it can be a limitation of my machine, since it was working fine at some point. </s>
<s> Consider that machines, capacitors age, timings skew and what was is no more. </s>
<s> I know this one inside out and share so you can save yourself a lot of time. </s>
<s> thanks for the insight. </s>
<s> Can i get a usb extender thing and plug it into one of the usb ports in the back of the computer so i can get a bunch more 2.0 usb ports? </s>
<s> Some replace the wiring. </s>
<s> Your choice on the solution. </s>
