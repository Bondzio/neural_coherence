1.4.1	Microsoft only supplied the OS .	St
1.4.2	If you formatted the system , then drivers for motherboard , USB and more need to be found and installed for your system .	St
1.4.3	Also XP does n't get USB 2.0 support till XP SP1 and even then there can be issues .	St
1.4.4	Most USB 2.0 drives would behave just like you wrote in your first post ... As it stands you have an incomplete OS install from what I can tell .	St
1.4.5	- & gt ; But you did n't read the forum tip so this is all I can tell you .	St
1.4.6	I ca n't point to possible drivers you might need .	St
