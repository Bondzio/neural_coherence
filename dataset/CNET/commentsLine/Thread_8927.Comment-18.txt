it is true, i have done a lot of research regarding this issue... what i wanted to get from the research and what i want to share with you all is this... crt's are king over lcd and or plasma's... this unfortunetly is true for television sets and the whole hdtv thing too.
i have a panasonic 36 inch hdtv that blowssss my neighbors very expensive flat wall unit away... he is never happy about it and i explained to him this... you should have waited... the lcd and plasma technology is going to become obsolete... and very soon... lq, a division of ge... is close to coming up with a super crt system that will virtually be a flat screen crt... again, this will blow the competicion away once it comes into fruition... as well, there is a lot of other technolog that is coming along as well that will also be a lot better than lcd and crt technology...
