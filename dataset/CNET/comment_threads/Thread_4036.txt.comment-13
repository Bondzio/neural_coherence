Hey, Bob, what's with the &quot;No further replies to this post will be accepted.&quot; to your last post?
I'm posting my reply to you here.
What do you mean about &quot;each application can have margins&quot;.
If I am opening up Windows Explorer to find a .jpg in there, then right-click on it to Print it out..... how do you set a margin for that?
It's automatic.
I don't quiet understand what you mean.
When I said that I checked the margins, I meant in Control Panel -&gt; Printers -&gt; Printer Model -&gt; the Options for it.
