I have installed a 6600 GT OC, two 512 sticks of ram, a $20 soundblaster card (the onboard sound when playing Half life 2 sucked) it sounds great now, and a 450 watt power supply.
The computer really kicks ass now, I can play the newest games with all of the graphics turned up with no problem!
AND when you decide to go SLI all you have to do is buy a new motherboard!
Also it is a 64bit AMD, so when the new 64bit windows comes out, you are ready to go!
ALSO, it is theoretically possible to shoehorn an Athlon 64 FX-55 processor and its heat sink into the T6212.
So, get one!
