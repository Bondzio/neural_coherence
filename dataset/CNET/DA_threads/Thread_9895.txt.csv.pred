1.1.1	I am running a home built Intel PC .	St
1.1.2	I have a Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L motherboard running an Intel Core 2 Duo E4400 @ 2.00GHz .	St
1.1.3	I currently have ( 2 ) 1 gig sticks of OCZ PC2 6400 800 mhz Dual CH ram .	St
1.1.4	The timing on those sticks is listed as 4-4-4-15 .	St
1.1.5	I could n't pass up a good deal that I got online for ( 2 ) more 1 gig sticks for only $ 19.99 ( after rebate ) .	St
1.1.6	They area also OCZ PC2 6400 800 mhz Dual CH ram .	St
1.1.7	I did n't realize when I purchased it that they have a different timing of 5-5-5 .	St
1.1.8	When I put all 4 in windows XP professional crashes .	St
1.1.9	I understand that with the 32 bit version I will never see all 4 gigs , but 3 would be nice .	St
1.1.10	My motherboard does have the ability to manually set the ram timing .	St
1.1.11	I tried that and I am still getting crashes .	St
1.1.12	I also took out the old ram and just booted off the new stuff to make sure I did n't get a bad stick .	St
1.1.13	It worked fine .	St
1.1.14	Does anyone have any idea how to get this working .	Ques
1.1.15	This is the first computer that I have ever built .	St
1.1.16	If I ca n't get it working it looks like these sticks are going on eBay .	St
1.1.17	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	to 5-5-5-15 or use 'fail-safe ' settings .	St
1.2.2	you may also want to increase your ram voltage a bit .	St
1.2.3	if all 4 boot fine , then try to speed up to 4-4-4-15 and then 4-4-4-12. once you 're able to boot ok , be sure to run a memory test to stress the system and ensure stability .	St
1.3.1	Mtrbds .	St
1.3.2	become picky when all ram slots are used .	St
1.3.3	It really pays to have matched sets of ram and/or similar types .	St
1.3.4	While you have very similar type you do n't have true matched pairs and you see the result .	St
1.3.5	If you have tweaked the ram at all , return or reduce ram demands abit in order to lessen speed , hopefully it can recover .	St
1.3.6	You can play with the setting but start at more safe level then tweak up .	St
1.3.7	Further , you have the OS limits and that may come into play .	St
1.3.8	Then on top of that , the mtrbd .	St
1.3.9	may need a bios update , see if one is available for such a cure and & quot ; what it does & quot ; .	St
1.3.10	What happens when only 3 sticks are installed ?	Ques
1.3.11	Try with the new sticks alone , what happens ?	Ques
1.3.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I tried it with 3 sticks .	St
1.4.2	I made it into windows and started working .	St
1.4.3	It crashed in about 5 minutes .	St
1.4.4	3 gigs were showing up at that time .	St
1.4.5	I also tried just putting in the brand new sticks and taking out the old sticks .	St
1.4.6	The computer booted fine with just the new ones .	St
