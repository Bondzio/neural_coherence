9478	0	15002	169105	NR	richie72846	3/9/04 6:41 PM	1.07885766E12	Shut Down	My HP Pavilion a320n running an AMD Athlon XP 2.08Ghz. on an ASUS motherboard keeps shutting down, but not completely. The screen goes blank, the blue power light blinks and the CPU fan goes into high speed. I know your first thought is excessive cpu temp. Mine also. But the cpu temp is at 55c. and the fan is running. Any other ideas. richie
