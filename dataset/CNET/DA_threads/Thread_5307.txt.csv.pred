1.1.1	Installed a DIAMOND X1650 AGP512SB Radeon X1650PRO 512MB AGP 4X/8X Video Card in computer #1 for an upgrade-no problems, works great.	St
1.1.2	Wanted to buy and install another of same card in computer #2 but will not fit.	St
1.1.3	#2 computer has micro atx mobo and the height of the fan/sink/cooler on the X1650 video card hits the pci card next to the AGP slot (video card basically takes up a slot and a half).	St
1.1.4	Cannot move pci card to another slot to make room for video card.	St
1.1.5	Am trying to replace a Diamond Stealth S120 Radeon 9550 256MB AGP 4X/8X card with fan/sink/cooler that fits (barely) without hitting pci card next to it.	St
1.1.6	Diamond website lists both cards as &quot;full height&quot;.	St
1.1.7	(From looking at photos looks like dropping down to model # X1600 that the fan/sink/cooler doesn't rise as high and would fit).	St
1.1.8	Are there different &quot;profile&quot; heights?	St
1.1.9	How do I determine what card will fit?	Ques
1.2.1	Shouldn't be a problem unless it's a slim-line or low-profile case.	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	New video card would be replacing a Diamond Radeon 9550 AGP on a PCChips M825LU micro atx mobo (Micro-ATX Form Factor, 244*190mm).	St
1.3.2	Mobo has AGP slot with two PCI slots (both slots being used).	St
1.3.3	Conventional mid tower case.	St
1.3.4	As mentioned before the 9550 video card sits next to a PCI card slot with a LAN card for my wireless internet connection and the fan on the 9550 clears the underside of LAN card (or any other card) by 1/8 inch.	St
1.3.5	The height of the fan/heatsink on the Diamond 1650 is taller/higher by at least 1/4&quot; than the fan/heatsink on the 9550 video card.	St
1.4.1	Can you run a wireless USB network card so you have an open space?	St
1.4.2	This is one of the beefs ive had for the past 3-4 years ever since i got into overclocking and stuff using big fans.	St
1.4.3	Why cant the put the GPU on the other side?	St
1.4.4	why does the GPU need to be on the bottom?	Ques
1.4.5	you always have room on the other side yet all the slots are so crammed together.	St
1.4.6	Seems like a no brainer but no one has done it have they?	St
