as hard as i looked i couldn't see a spec that said this card had a digital audio out.
or maybe i'm getting confused.
there definitely wasn't an optical out and there are no analog outs.
i started thinking that maybe i'm wasting my time on the home receiver because i've heard such good things about some of the pc speaker sets (like the logitech).
i also read that regular speakers don't sound great when you're sitting &quot;on top&quot; of them.
pc speakers are designed to be listened to at closer ranges.
when i read that i turned a song on at my desk and listened to half of it while seated at the desk and the other half about 8 feet away from the desk.
the song sounded better from a distance.
i have a p4 1.4, 512mb, 200gb, windows xp pro machine.
it's more than enough for my needs.
i don't game but i love to listen to music.
want to set the pc up as a media center but for now i'm stuck sitting at my desk and letting the sound hit me in the face.
naturally, i want the best sound i can get and if you read all the articles i've read you go crazy worrying about internal electrical interferences, bit rates, which codec is best, and how to get the best sound from your speakers.
i could really use some helpful advice from anyone who has been through what i'm going through.
thanks all!
