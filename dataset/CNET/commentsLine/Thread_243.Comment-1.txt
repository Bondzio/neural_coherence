getting a dell 4700 winxp to replace 5 yo gateway win98se.
what software do you recommend for transferring files from the old to the new?
a lot of picture folders, all my email (outlook express), over 100 desktop shortcuts, printmaster, adobe photoshop, adobe photodeluxe, quicken, word etc.
thanks jbt
