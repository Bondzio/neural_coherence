I updated the drivers to the 81.89 ones, which are not the WHQL certified or whatever. Consequently, the next day I recived a nasty BSOD, in which Windows kindly told me it was my Driver. I uninstalled it, tried to rollback, got drivers from 2001 Driver CD; nothing. The BSOD's are gone, but the computer will not or cannot go to a higher resolution and produce 32bit colors. Does anyone know where I might find the older drivers from nVidia, or an archive of them. I admit that I should have cancelled the installtion, but I didn't thinking it would be ok. Sadly, I cannot restore the computer, either. If anyone knows where to get old drivers, it be a great help. ~Ibrahim
