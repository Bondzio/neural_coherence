this is a common shop hound.
that is we know to turn such a machine away from repair no matter how minor as the owner would then claim all troubles were because of our repair even if it was to glue the decal back onto the frame.
consider that it served well and start looking for something newer even if it's from the free list at craigslist or freecycle.
