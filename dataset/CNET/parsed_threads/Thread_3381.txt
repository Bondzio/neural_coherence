<s> In most cases, by what I've heard, when the C drive of most computers are wiped, and then Windows XP reinstalled, if no other issues exist, the computer should be pretty speedy in my opinion. </s>
<s> I have a Pentium 4 - 2.8 Ghz - 1 Gig Ram - NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 4000 with 128 memory video card - Win XP SP2 - 2 HD's (lots of room) etc. </s>
<s> Upon having issues, I took it to my local computer shop, where they did their testing, and told me initially that I needed to wipe my C drive, and reinstall Windows XP. </s>
<s> I got a call a couple of days later as I was told there was an issue with my Processor, which at the time was a 2.5 Ghz but they had a 2.8 Ghz which they installed. </s>
<s> Overall, on most occassions, once the computer is booted, things seem pretty normal, but there are times when I have to wait for what seems like forever after clicking the mouse to get it to do what I want. </s>
<s> Initially, after a reboot, my computer is set up for myself, and 2 other family members, so we see our names, which we click on...enter our password, and the computer does it's thing for our particular settings, and away we go....&quot;but&quot; now...the computer gives a blue screen for perhaps 15 seconds, it then shows our names...of which we can click the cursor over our name with no results...of which after perhaps 30 - 60 seconds, the cursor becomes a hand, where we can now click our name and the computer will boot up our settings. </s>
<s> Before all this came to be (taking it in to the shop) after a reboot of the computer Win XP only took perhaps 15 seconds of which our names would appear...we could instantly click our name and our settings would be set...and away we'd go! </s>
<s> So, basically the main issue is this initial reboot to usability..and the time it takes, although, sometimes it seems to have a hiccup and I can click the mouse with no instant response, but this isn't constant. </s>
<s> Also, there have been times while typing, where the text I'm typing isn't keeping up on the screen (I'm not that fast...really!) </s>
<s> so what's that all about? </s>
<s> I also am not fond of the &quot;font&quot; on my desktop now either, so perhaps someone could suggest a good one for me? </s>
<s> I should mention as well, I use a Viewsonic LCD screen, if that helps, as I'm wondering if my video card has anything to do with all this I'm having trouble with, although it's really not that old? </s>
<s> My display is 1162 X 864, which may have to do with my font issue, but when I choose 1280 X 720 it seems to look odd to me...so your opinions on that would be appreciated as well. </s>
<s> I'm hoping I can find the answers to this &quot;slowness&quot; issue, as this latest &quot;fix&quot; was costly, and I wonder now if I should have just replaced my whole computer! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> If there is any information I missed giving which would be helpful, please just ask. </s>
<s> &quot;I've heard, when the C drive of most computers are wiped, and then Windows XP reinstalled, if no other issues exist, the computer should be pretty speedy in my opinion.&quot; It would be if everyone did that and didn't install motherboard drivers and whatever else Microsoft didn't supply. </s>
<s> But time and again you find shops that won't finish the install proper. </s>
