awesome, thanks for the recommendation... the reason i dont care about pci-express as much is because i think that the card i have still sells for a couple hundred and it would not be worth upgrading it... but i may be wrong on that part...?
anything anyone can recommend for under $150?
im not sure if 64 bit or dual core is better?
and would it be worth it to wait till next month or anything?
thanks again!
