1.1.1	Hello , Ironically , the HD on my Dell Inspiron failed this week , a day after I started a massive backup effort .	St
1.1.2	My fault for not doing so more often ( a recovery service is currently trying to retrieve portions of my PhD dissertation ... . ) .	St
1.1.3	I want to avoid this headache should ( actually , when ) I have another failure .	St
1.1.4	I do have an external drive that is several years old , but it was quite a pain to use and was limited by the size of the files I could transfer .	St
1.1.5	This leads me to several questions : - Are most external drives formatted the same , or is there a specific feature I should look for in purchasing a new drive ?	Ques
1.1.6	I remember someone telling me that my file transfer issue was related to the format of the drive .	St
1.1.7	- What is the most user-friendly method or software to perform regular backups ?	Ques
1.1.8	For example , I have a new HD coming from Dell .	St
1.1.9	*IF* I had been backing up my data , is there a way that I could simply install my new HD , plug in the external backup , and it could create an identical replicate of my old HD ( files , applications , settings..the works ) ?	Ques
1.1.10	-Related to my last question , I 'm looking for a drive that I could simply plug in once a day and execute a backup with little effort on my part .	St
1.1.11	Is this possible ?	Ques
1.1.12	Can it be scheduled to create a & quot ; new & quot ; back-up file daily and replace the previous one ?	Ques
1.1.13	- Can the external drive be organized to both create a daily backup and to have long-term storage for files I do n't want taking up space on my laptop ?	Ques
1.1.14	Or do I need two drives , one devoted to backup and one for long-term storage ?	Ques
1.1.15	- I read a suggestion in another thread that you should purchase a drive 3-4x the size of the files you want to backup .	St
1.1.16	Is this accurate ?	Ques
1.1.17	Thank you in advance for your help .	St
1.1.18	( FYI - I tried to search for this information in previous threads but was not finding exactly what I needed .	St
1.1.19	I apologize if this has been discussed recently and I missed it . )	St
1.2.1	Forgot to add - my system runs Vista , if that makes any difference ( several older posts referred to software for XP ) .	St
1.3.1	In the interest of not repeating the many many posts on the subjects addressed , please take a look at some of the searches below ... starting with the one on 'backup ' .	St
1.3.2	I would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas .	St
1.3.3	The one thing I recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location ... whether it be electronic bits and bytes .	St
1.3.4	.	St
1.3.5	especially an external HDD , or even hard copy .	St
