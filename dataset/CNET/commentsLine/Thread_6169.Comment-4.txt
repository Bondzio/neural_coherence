steven, for both pcs, i only have one account...which is administrator.
for example, when i hit start, the top says administrator.
i've tried to share files and printers....all i can see the pc name.
under files and printers, i do see a &quot;hand.&quot; from the research i've done, it appears that windows xp media edition is similar to xp home.
but, i should be able to connect xp home with xp pro.
thanks, tom
