<s> Hello, I'm new to cnet, and desperate for some help. </s>
<s> I have just bought a new tower with a M7NCG 400 motherboard with onboard sound. </s>
<s> It uses NVIDIA nForce Audio ... </s>
<s> I installed the drivers that came with the chipset cd and the device shows up in the control panel (Im using win xp pro btw) under &quot;Sound and Audio Devices&quot; and in the Device Manager, displayed that the device is working properly. </s>
<s> Everything seems fine, I can adjust volume and whatnot, but there is no sound coming from my speakers, except for a strange buzzing sound when I move my mouse. </s>
<s> It's soft, and can only be heard if I have the speakers turned up significantly loud. </s>
<s> Everytime I move my mouse it's like I can hear it as a buzz... Anyways, can anyone help? </s>
<s> I would be VERY grateful I don't know what to do and I really need sound Thanks a lot </s>
<s> Check the port you are using as output to the speakers. </s>
<s> Verify you're plugged in to the right sound port. </s>
<s> Then verify in the bios area that you have the audio, &quot;enabled&quot;. </s>
<s> Read your manual to find out just what key sequence is required to eneter the bios. </s>
<s> Also, make sure to save any changes before exiting the bios area. </s>
<s> These are primary steps that have to be checked. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I am plugged into the right port, but just in case I have tried all three...and also, I have it enabled through my BIOS. </s>
<s> I have the sound enabled and the onboard LAN disabled. </s>
<s> What else could be wrong? </s>
<s> :(:(:( </s>
<s> If downloading latest drivers doesn't work, you can pester the supplier for a working motherboard or disable the onboard sound and install a sound card. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Test under the control panel-&gt; multimedia&sounds icon and try a sound output. </s>
<s> OR do an audio system setup where you config the speaker setup, output, etc. </s>
<s> for best operation. </s>
<s> That depends on the type of chipset you have. </s>
<s> You can try reloading the mtrbd. </s>
<s> drivers for audio as well. </s>
<s> Of course check to see that ouput isn't, &quot;muted&quot; or set so low. </s>
<s> If none of this helps, then you may have a bad audio chipset, of course if any &quot;manual&quot; jumpers need to set, do so, check in the manual/docs for details. </s>
<s> Under device mgr, verify no red/yellow flags are present, if so, correct them. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
