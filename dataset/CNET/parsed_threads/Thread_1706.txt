<s> About two weeks ago my PC stopped turning on. </s>
<s> I had no problems prior to this. </s>
<s> I had it looked at by local PC guy and he said power supply was fine, that it was the motherboard or CPU. </s>
<s> Also, said it would be $250.00 to fix. </s>
<s> I wanted to see if this sounded right, or was I getting screwed. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> eMachine, about a year old, running WinXP Home Ed. </s>
<s> Is this computer guy 100% sure that it is CPU/Motherboard related? </s>
<s> The price seems resonable, if that is the problem, of course. </s>
<s> What is the model number? </s>
<s> Starts with a T, I believe. </s>
<s> Ask him if you get a full refund if that isn't the problem. </s>
<s> If he says he will provide a refund, good. </s>
<s> If he says he will return the part money, not labor: OK, but not the best. </s>
<s> No refund? </s>
<s> Find another guy. </s>
<s> You could be out of $250 and still no working computer. </s>
<s> So, just one day it died? </s>
<s> Hmph! </s>
<s> That is peculiar. </s>
<s> Does it beep when you turn it on? </s>
<s> Have you tried calling eMachines? </s>
<s> What are the total specs? </s>
<s> How much money are you willing to spend? </s>
<s> Because, a new eMachines isn't that much more, and you could just transfer the hard drives. </s>

<s> If they go the repair route...they probably should get all the original (replaced) parts back too. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> It is a T2642, and I was away from home for about a week. </s>
<s> We had a power outage at some point during that time. </s>
<s> When you push the power button, there are no signs of life. </s>
<s> The guy I brought it to works from his house. </s>
<s> I may spend the $60.00 and bring it to Geeksquad. </s>
<s> If it's the motherboard I can probably get a good price on newegg.com. </s>
<s> Beware the motherboard replacement since most box units come with an operating system like XP that won't install if you change the motherboard to another make. </s>
<s> This can surprise some with another 1 to 2 hundred expense. </s>
<s> About the no power up issue. </s>
<s> I can sniff out if it's the moterboard by stripping the machine to the bone. </s>
<s> All that I need to power up is... 1. </s>
<s> Power supply (ok, obvious) 2. </s>
<s> Motherboard. </s>
<s> Nothing else! </s>
<s> No CPU, RAM, drives, nothing else is required. </s>
<s> I don't need the power on push button but use a jumper or screwdriver on the pwr switch connection on the motherboard. </s>
<s> If it fails to power up then we are looking at the bum parts. </s>
<s> Remember that the CMOS BATTERY, if too low can cause some boards to refuse to power up. </s>
<s> Test? </s>
<s> Get out your Volt Meter and check that battery. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So if I replace the motherboard, I need to get the same make. </s>
<s> Got it. </s>
<s> Can you explain the motherboard test to me again? </s>
<s> I'm a semi-newbie so I'm not sure how to do it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
