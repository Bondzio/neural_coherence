<s> Afternoon all, I've been trawling forums for a while now and not really found a solid answer. </s>
<s> I think I dropped my WD Passport, it was about a week ago and I was running around at work, and since then I can't get the drive to be recognised fully. </s>
<s> Setup ACER 6950 Laptop - Vista HP SP1 Symptoms Under disk management, Vista can find a drive it calls Drive 1, Unknown, at first when I tried to reinitialize it said cannot find the sector requested, now I just get improper function error Not very scientific but I get the bing bong tones when it's plugged in and there is a drive to &quot;safely remove&quot;. </s>
<s> It sometimes appears under disks in device manager and a USB mass storage device under USB I can also change the drive from performance to quick remove in the device properties Solutions I've tried Lying it on various sides, apparently that was a fix elsewhere Different USB cables, though no new ones but the symptons are the same and I can't believe that 3 cables would all have the same problem Any help or forum pointer would be amazing. </s>
<s> I'm currently volunteering in Tanzania with no local expertises, slow internet connection and limited funds, but I need to get some important research papers off the drive and am considering paying for data recovery. </s>
<s> Lesson learned not to leave important docs on drives. </s>
<s> Cheers in anticipation. </s>
<s> Trying all of the above on XP desktops </s>
<s> Beyond what's in this forum's top post about this you remove the drive from the case, place in a new case and hope. </s>
<s> I won't duplicate the forum sticky contents here and for each new post. </s>
<s> Then off to http://www.drivesavers.com Bob </s>
<s> remove the plastic casing. </s>
<s> peel the foil back. </s>
<s> slowly remove the &quot;usb card front section&quot; from the &quot;hard drive section&quot;. </s>
<s> purchase a &quot;FREE AGENT GOFLEX UPGRADE CABLE - USB 3.0...MADE BY SEAGATE&quot; (about $20 at BestBuy). </s>
<s> plug it ino the hard drive section, plug the other end into you computer & it's FIXED! </s>
<s> You MUST clearly understand upon any drop damage, you have &quot;physical damage&quot; to contend with. </s>
<s> Its not just some s/w corruption or glitch, true physical h/w is more likely at fault here. </s>
<s> The other posters offered fixes but it still depnds on the HD itself has any chance of recovery. </s>
<s> I include damage to the ext. </s>
<s> case, its ports and/or electronics. </s>
<s> Once you swap the HD itself to another ext. </s>
<s> USB case, that's your LAST CHANCE as a end-user fix. </s>
<s> If it does work then, then contact the pros to do this. </s>
<s> Also, let's be clear as well, ALL ATTEMPTS at getting any data recovery under physical damaged condition may further corrupt or cause data damage beyond what was initially incurred. </s>
<s> So don't proceed until you have some ext. </s>
<s> case or kit to try it on. </s>
<s> Don't be mislead into voodoo fixes as these can only further damage the ext. </s>
<s> HD more, which is why I posted. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
