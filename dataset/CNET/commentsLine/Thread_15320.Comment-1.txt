i'm considering purchasing a new desktop pc to replace my 7 year old pc.
i spoke to a sales rep with one of the major pc manufacturers last night and the question came to security software; antivirus software and etc.
i told him i definitely planned to have installed something like norton's anti-virus software.
i also told him i'd be switching from a basic dial-up internet connection to a high speed internet connection such as dsl or cable modem.
besides making sure that i have an anti-virus software program installed on my new pc before connecting it to the internet for the first time what other types of software for computer security should i also have installed on my new desktop pc before i connect it to the internet for the very first time?
i intend to use my new desktop computer for basic home office use; email; web surfing; personal finance; and word processing.
i'm in the 50+ year old category; i don't play games nor do i make videos on a pc.
based upon my use of a home desktop pc; should i have installed any other security software on my new pc before i connect it to the internet for the very first time?
comments from anyone in this forum who happen to know would certainly be appreciated.
