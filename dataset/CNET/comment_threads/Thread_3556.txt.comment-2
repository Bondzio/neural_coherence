Both have 802.11B cards inside.
But these are very old machines so we learned to disable the onboard cards and use 802.11g PC-Cards for these machines.
There is ONE OTHER THING and it's very simple.
If the wifi is secured poorly (WEP, MAC filters or less) then simple kid friendly software can hijack and interfere with the connections.
We cover this in the Cnet networking forum so I won't write more about that.
