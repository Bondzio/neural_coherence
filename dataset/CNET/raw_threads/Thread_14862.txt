I've been reading up on wireless networking, but now am confused.. I don't want to share files, just the internet connection. What do I need and how to hook it up? and do I have to hook up the desk top wireless or can I save money and still just plug it in?

Wireless should be only used if the device that is using is traveling around. Otherwise cabel is the best bet. It's always connected and it's more reliable. My suggestion would be to have your notebook connected by cable, to the router while you are at you desk, and when you out and about in your house, just unplug it from the router, and use the wireless connectivity. Wireless doesn't = faster. It's a substitute!
