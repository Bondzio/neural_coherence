if you buy an external drive like a firewire drive, make sure you get one with a cooling fan.
i never bought the idea of &quot;convection cooling&quot; my data!
i bought a non fan cooled 250 gig drive and couldn't believe how hot that thing got.
yet a separate enclosure with the same drive, only this time fan cooled, was barely warm.
convection cooling simply won't work in the long haul and thinking about how many times i lost data due to cpu crashes, etc, i'm not going to risk not having a fan to save a few bucks.
recently i had yet another dell ecc memory meltdown which put me into the position of not having backed up every single thing on my computer.
(funny how you realize how much you need some of the files once you can't get at them.)
couldn't find the rambus memory locally, so i removed the ide drive from the dell, popped it into an avastor hdx firewire enclosure, and was able to access the files on the new system i had to buy.
got lucky that this worked.
