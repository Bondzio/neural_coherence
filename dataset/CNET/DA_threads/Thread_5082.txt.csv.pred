1.1.1	I have a Linksys WRT54GS Router that connects from the internet .	St
1.1.2	Then I have a Gateway Desktop running Windows XP Pro and a Toshiba Laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium connected to the Linksys router .	St
1.1.3	I just recently bought the new Linksys router that I 'm using now , before with my previous Linksys router I had no problems accessing the shared files on my desktop from my laptop , but now the only way I can access them is when my laptop is connected to the network wirelessly .	St
1.1.4	If I plug in the laptop directly to the router I can no longer access those files .	St
1.1.5	Keep in mind I 'm fairly new to networking issues so you might have to hold my hand through this .	St
1.1.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Nevermind , I got it working .	St
