I have had a Canon multifunction multipass c555 for 12 years.
I set it for black only mode which then accomadtes a larger black tank cartridge.
I have refilled the cartridges for 12 years with NO problems.
Canon tells me that new models will self destruct the cartridge the first time the cartridge is empty.
Once empty the cartridge will tell the electronics its always empty.
Any ideas?
