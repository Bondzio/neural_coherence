i just replaced my old hdd with one of the new fastest ssd's.
it really does make a big performance difference, even on a pc built in october 2009. i bought a 2-year warranty on my ssd from the store.
this is on top on of the manufacturer's 1 year warranty, but it has the advantage in that a replacement would be quicker and it would give me a brand new ssd, whereas the manufacturer would give me a refurbished one.
i work in pc repair, and have once in a while replaced an ssd, but i would not say that they are less reliable than standard sata hdd's.
someone told me once that he experienced a lot of trouble with hard drives and that today's drives are actually less reliable, perhaps because the huge sizes are more prone to failure.
i would love to see a report that could present exact statistics for hard drive and sata drive failure.
but from experience, i doubt that ssd's are any worse, and as others have commented, they have improved.
