My plan is to install Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.

While I really enjoy high tech fast machines the brutal truth is that RAID in all forms tend to overwhelm the home users with the need to know more than they bargained for. I'd setup this with a single drive and use a possibly cheaper drive as a second clone copy for the day it goes south. And then we still need backup! Bob

If you're bent on RAID 0 with these 10000 RPM drives, why not consider the less expensive 150 gig drives. That gives you 300 in RAID 0 which will hold a lot of software. My preference is to store data off of the primary drive as this tends to grow to enormity and makes backing up more complicated if the primary drives grows with it. I prefer to get a huge secondary drive plus an external or two to store data and use for backups....maybe a NAS too.
