on my current machine i have two 500gig sata hard drives both in working condition, one running windows 7 and the other used for storage.
now i also have an 80gig ide hard drive running ubuntu; which i have from my old machine.
the 80gig ide ran perfectly with a different sata hard drive in the old machine (all i had to do was switch the boot order to use either ubuntu on the 80gig ide or windows 7 on the old sata hard drive).
i just recently tried bringing the 80gig ide drive over to my new computer but it doesn't seem to be working.
the bios recognizes it as a 2500mb drive for some absurd reason.
any ideas on how to get this to work?
additional info: mother board: asus a8-ne jumper settings for the ide drive: cs
