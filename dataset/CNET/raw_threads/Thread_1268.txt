Got all the nifty things I thought I would need. But after some reading I realized some boards/other stuff may not be compatible.Heres the links to all the stuff. I wanna make sure it will all work together before I confirm my order. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811156097 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128357 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814500077 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103253 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134606 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136298 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827106263 Thank you ^^

CPU (AMD or Intel) and a motherboard that supports it. Also give us a budget so we know what price range we're working with. If AMD...look at something with a better user rating ...perhaps something like the one below Gigabyte Motherboard for AMD CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128373 VAPCMD
