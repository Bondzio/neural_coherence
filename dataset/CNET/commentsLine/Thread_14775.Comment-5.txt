i have the hp photosmart 8250 and have the that problem since day one with vista, so it's not just your model.
after many calls to hp i was told they have no plans on fixing the problem.
my neighbor bought a new hp computer and printer and it wouldn't print two sided, so it appears that hp has totally dropped double sided printing just as bob said.
