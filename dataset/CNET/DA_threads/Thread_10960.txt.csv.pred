1.1.1	Let me start by saying I am very much a novice pc user , and I would to thank you for your help in advance .	St
1.1.2	That being said , I have two computers , A and B , with A being wired to my router and B being wireless .	St
1.1.3	A is running XP Pro and B is running XP Media Center .	St
1.1.4	I am also running a program called Network Magic that helps in sharing folders and such .	St
1.1.5	Computer A has a folder containing all of my mp3 files that I would like to put on computer B , and I set it up to be shared using Network Magic .	St
1.1.6	When I open up the program , I can open the folder , but I can not play any of the files contained in the folder , and I can not drag them to a folder on computer B , nor can I copy and paste them to the folder on computer B .	St
1.1.7	When I attempt to , I get an error saying & quot ; Can not copy & lt ; Filename & gt ; Access is Denied .	St
1.1.8	Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use. & quot ; Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do on how to get these files from Computer A to Computer B .	St
1.1.9	Sorry for the lengthy description , and again thank you for your time .	Polite
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Let 's say your account on computer A is called & quot ; Johnny & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	Do you have an account called & quot ; Johnny & quot ; on computer B and did you set the permissions on the files to allow Johnny to read them ?	Ques
1.2.4	That 's 2 things you need to accomplish .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	Another downright nutty thing that kills some is that after they get the accounts correct it still does n't work .	St
1.2.7	What I found is Windows does n't retroactively give Johnny access to the share .	St
1.2.8	I have to remove the share , recreate it after I created Johnny 's account .	St
1.2.9	After this , Johnny can read .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	Again , sorry for my lack of knowledge , but how would I go about doing that .	Polite
1.3.2	I apologize , but I really need you to hold my hand through this process .	St
1.4.1	With all the fine books and web pages about the sharing properties in Windows I must decline giving any step by step .	St
1.4.2	My goal was to share why this happens most of the time .	St
1.4.3	Creating accounts should be easy .	St
