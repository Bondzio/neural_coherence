Ive been using a public hotspot across the street, but they shut down shop. My work has a LAN, but i dont prefer to use that and i cant figure out how to get their router to work with my wireless router! Heres what i have available. A work computer with a secure LAN My house 1 mile away with cable internet and a belkin wireless router several local hotspots (secured and i dont wanna crack them) a telephone pole with a gigantic cb antenna for a commercial two way radio (i have access to the radio). Ive had alot of ideas but cant materialize any of them. Go to work guys!!!
