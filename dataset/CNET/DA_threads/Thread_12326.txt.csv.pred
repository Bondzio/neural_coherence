1.1.1	Okay im getting frusterated at this problem: Recently my USB ports have not been functioning at ALL..	St
1.1.2	I tried to plug in my iPod, Digital Camera, and DVD burner all which have drivers updated and none of them are being recognized by the computer..with one exception.. my iPod charges when i plug it into the computer but the computer still doesnt recognize it at all..	St
1.1.3	I have tried to delete the USB entries in the device manager and refresh the USB stack but that didnt help and i also went into my computers BIOS and everything that said USB was enabled so its not that either..	St
1.1.4	I have no clue why the USB ports are not recognizing any device i put into them.. Im thinking about going to the store and getting a USB PC card and see if those work..do you think they will even if my other ones arent working??	St
1.1.5	its worth a try i guess.. Any help would be appreciated..	Sug
1.1.6	Thank You, Nick	St
1.2.1	Nick, Sounds like the onboard USB controller(s) failed.	St
1.2.2	Try the card if you want.	St
1.2.3	It may be what saves you from a new motherboard.	St
1.2.4	But if it is the motherboard, failed controllers are usually followed by total failure.	St
1.2.5	Best to replace the motherboard now.	St
1.2.6	and life goes on... Jack	St
