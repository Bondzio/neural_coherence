He had a problem with an music maker app, when you run it, it says it cant find an avi file on the cdrom, but it's there. I thought the virus was the cause, but apparently not as the same thing happened after I removed them. The system then seemed to be unstable (couldn't create an xp restore point, it would hang up trying). So I did a Compaq destructive restore and the system went back to normal operation. My real question is why does this comp show 2 processors in device manager? (Intel 2.8 hyperthreading processors). This has to be a low end comp as it has onboard video & audio. Also in device manager in the IDE controllers there are 2 ata controllers, 2 Primary ide channels & 2 Secondary ide channels listed. My comp only has 1 each of the above??? I uninstalled 1 of the ata controllers & a primary & secondary Ide channel disappeared along with it. However, when I rebooted, all of the above reappeared via the found new hardware thingy....

Drivers... http://www.asus.it/support/download/item.aspx?ModelName=P4SDX&Type=All P4SDX has too many models noted so I can't narrow it down. I think you'll have to point out which exact model you have. In closing, is there an issue that needs fixing? Bob
