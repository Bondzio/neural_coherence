Please provide what you think the hardware failure is and I'll see if I can note a test for it. For example, hard disk makers have a DRIVE FITNESS TEST that I often use to see if the hard disk is in need of replacement. Is the OS a suspect? Then post in the OS Forum that matches yours. Be sure to read the Forum Tip. Bob
