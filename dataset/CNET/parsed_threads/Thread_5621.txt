<s> I have a Win CE6 device that communicates with USB flash drives. </s>
<s> I want to be able to connect the Win CE6 device to a PC using USB connections. </s>
<s> I can't make changes (hw or sw) to the Win CE6 device. </s>
<s> I am looking for cable/hardware that has two USB ends. </s>
<s> One end looks like a standard USB flash drive, it connects to the Win CE6 device without any changes to that device. </s>
<s> The other end connects to the PC and allows some of the PC memory to appear as a USB flash drive to the Win CE6 device. </s>
<s> Read only access to the PC memory is ok for my purposes. </s>
<s> Any products available like this? </s>
<s> Thanks, Lachlan </s>

<s> Thanks for the suggestion, but I need something more sophisticated than a USB extension cable. </s>
<s> There needs to be some hardware in the cable that &quot;translates&quot; PC memory into USB flash drive memory. </s>
