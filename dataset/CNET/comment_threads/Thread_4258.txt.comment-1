I recently built my own computer, everything has seemed to work fine, except on random occasions (sometimes it occurs a few minutes after turning on my computer, sometimes i can use it for a long time with nothing happening) i get a blue screen of death with &quot;driver corrupted mmpool&quot; and the techical data is ***STOP:0x000000D0(0XB9BFD704) What should I do?
