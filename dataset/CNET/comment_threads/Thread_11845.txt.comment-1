My Linksys BEFSR41 router recently stopped working.
I cannot log into it, it cannot be pinged, the &quot;Diagnostic&quot; led is constantly on and no matter how many times I reset it I get nothing.
Before I send it to the scrapyard and buy a new one, has anyone else had this issue and is it fixable?
