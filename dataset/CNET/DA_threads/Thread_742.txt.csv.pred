1.1.1	Hi All , I recently bought a good digital SLR .	Polite
1.1.2	then realized I needed to take a course in Photoshop .	St
1.1.3	While taking the course I noted the MAC monitors in school have much better resolution and color separation than the 20 monitor that came w/ my pc .	St
1.1.4	I dont want to buy a MAC so I figured I could upgrade my screen and then buy a spyder to calibrate it .	St
1.1.5	I am looking for a good 24 to 27 unit that is not in the nosebleed price range ( over 1500 $ ) The specs on the machine are ; 2.4 GHz quad core w/ 3 gigs of memory and an Nvidia Geforce 8600 GT card .	St
1.1.6	The machine has no problem handling Photoshop CS4 Any help can get w/ this decision would be great .	St
1.1.7	Thanks , Apple 25	St
1.2.1	than any other PC monitors ( if we can call that ) .	St
1.2.2	Just go get the best you cab afford .	Sug
1.2.3	Or maybe one with led backlited one .	St
1.2.4	It is soppose to give better contrast ratio ( but I do n't how important that is to your work ) .	St
1.2.5	Also maybe a better video card might help as well ( just guessing here ) .	Sug
1.3.1	just make sure they are not TN monitors .	St
1.4.1	Get the make and model from the MAC monitor and then you can research the unit .	St
1.4.2	With the specs in hand ... ..go shopping .	St
1.5.1	available from other mfgs .	St
1.5.2	PC Connection has a nice search engine and an endless selection of monitors with a variety of specs .	St
1.5.3	Are you looking for a high-gloss or matte finish LCD ?	Ques
1.5.4	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	it doesnt look like the mac will hook up to a pc btw are you asking about the case of the monitor when you said glossy or flat ?	Ques
1.6.2	if that 's the question I could n't care less if the case has pink polka dots on it as long as it will give me better color sep and depth	St
1.7.1	I have a 24 inch LCD with a matte finish LCD and a 17 & quot ; laptop with a gloss finish LCD .	St
1.7.2	I really like the 24 in LCD with the matte finish but really struggle with the gloss finish LCD on the laptop as it seems to reflect almost anything from anywhere .	St
1.7.3	I 'm talking about matching the general monitor specs ... dot pitch , viewing angle , contrast , color depth , etc. , as the starting point to find LCDs that match MAC LCD specs .	St
1.7.4	Like you ... I ca n't fathom there are n't LCDs made by mfgs that are n't as good or better than those made by Apple .	St
1.7.5	Pink polka dots on the frame ?	Ques
1.7.6	... . think I 'd find those distracting too .	Polite
1.7.7	Good luck and let us know what you decide on .	St
1.7.8	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	how about that , since this is my first lcd desk top and I have never owned a lap top I did n't know they made the screens in gloss finish like the old crt 's huh .	St
1.8.2	I started to look around on camera web sites and it seems the industry standard is LaCie , Eizo or Nec .	St
1.8.3	they all make models w/ caliberation software but they are all very pricey .	St
1.8.4	I do n't think I 'll be buying a 30 & quot ; any time soon unless I hit the lottery .	St
1.8.5	I live 20 min north of nyc and they have one of the largest camera shops in the world there .	St
1.8.6	I 'm going to call them next week to see if they have any of the units set up for a look see .	St
1.8.7	I 'll keep you up to speed on my selection .	St
1.9.1	to the gloss finish to get brighter screens with more vivid color to attract buyers .	St
1.9.2	They look great for the moment but for day after day long term use ...	St
1.9.3	I 'll take the non-glare matte ( non-glare ) finish anytime .	St
1.9.4	Re visiting retailers in NYC ... .great idea .	St
1.9.5	No better way than first hand to find what pleases you .	St
1.9.6	Places like Best Buy , MicroCenter also have monitors on display you can see before buying .	St
1.9.7	We 'll look forward to seeing your findings and observations .	St
1.9.8	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	I broke down and went for the big bucks .	St
1.10.2	I got a NEC LCD3090WQi 30 & quot ; unit and a spyder3 elite calibration software .	St
1.10.3	it was the cheapest pro unit in that size .	St
1.10.4	I am very happy with the setup .	St
1.10.5	Apple	St
