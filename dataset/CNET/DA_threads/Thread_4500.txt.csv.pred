1.1.1	I do not know much about ATI , so can you clear something up ?	Ques
1.1.2	What is the difference between the ATI cards : the X 800 , the X 1300 , and the X 1600 ?	Ques
1.1.3	Hope you can help me with this .	St
1.1.4	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	The X1300 and the X1600 are newer cards than the X800 , but from what I 've seen the X1300 not necessarily faster in terms of gaming performance .	St
1.3.1	... however , it was the high-end previous generation card .	St
1.3.2	The X1300/X1600 are current generation cards ; the X1300 is the low-end card , and the X1600 is the mid-range card .	St
1.3.3	The high-end current generation cards are the X1800 and X1900 .	St
1.3.4	You 'll notice that the card names all have suffixes , such as the ATI Radeon X1900XTX .	St
1.3.5	I wo n't get too deep into the suffixes ; I 'll tell you that XT is better than pro , and GTO is better than GT .	St
1.3.6	I could also get into the CrossFire dual video card stuff , but I do n't feel like it .	St
1.3.7	-Nathan	St
1.4.1	Thanks for clearing all that up .	St
1.4.2	I do know a bit about high end ATI cards , because I want to buy I new computer sometime soon .	St
1.4.3	I am also fairly knowedgable about Crossfire and stuff .	St
1.4.4	I was wondering , if I was to upgrade my AGP FX 5700 LE video card to something less than $ 200 tat plays Oblivion and other such games fairly well .	St
1.4.5	Would the X800 , X1300 , or the X1600 fit into that criteria well ?	Ques
1.4.6	Thanks for the help !	St
1.5.1	... just save that money and put it into your new PC .	St
1.5.2	I 'd suggest that you build the new PC .	St
1.5.3	If you want to play Oblivion , I 'd recommend the X1800XT for $ 280ish on newegg .	St
1.5.4	But the X1800XT is a PCIe card , so get that with a new comptuer .	St
1.6.1	Thank you for the advice .	St
1.6.2	I am planning to get a new computer , but I would rather get a newer car ( 7900 GTX or 1900 XTX ) or even SLId or Crossfired cards .	St
1.6.3	Anyway , if I was to upgrade my computer , which of these cards : X800 , X1300 , X1600 or any other AGP cards you think are good should I upgrade my computer with ?	Ques
1.7.1	... are PCIe cards .	St
1.7.2	What is your budget for the new AGP card ?	Ques
1.8.1	Sorry , I meant that I would buy one of these new cards for the new computer .	St
1.8.2	I would rahter the card I buy be under $ 200 , So I can make the new computer really good .	St
1.8.3	Any suggestions , such as the X800 , X1300 , or the X1600 ?	Ques
1.8.4	They obviously have to be AGP cards .	St
1.8.5	Thanks for the help !	St
