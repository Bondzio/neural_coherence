i too recently got the 8560dn - duplexer is great for wedding programs!
there are a lot of great things, some bad.
feeds envelopes great, but if you print on stardream envelopes, it will smudge/rub off when mailed.
not sure about regular envelopes.
but, it prints stardream cover stock great (105#) from the manual feed tray.
as someone noted below, it doesn't print borderless, so you need to trim to do your bleeds.
my large papercutter has a peice that holds the paper in place - but the pressure of it will offset the ink from one page to the next.
so, i tediously have to put scrap sheets between each one before cutting.
ugh!
it doesn't always print in the right spot - for instance, i'll put my crop marks at 1&quot; and the design is dead on in illustrator, but will print 1/8&quot; off on the page, which can make this off center when cut.
i manually move everything in my artwork before printing.
as for color matching, it's great.
it has built-in pantone matching - but don't compare to a real pantone book.
there is a download from xerox that you print out - about 20 pages worth.
it will print all the different color combos.
(when you create your new documents, you need it to be set to rgb, not cmyk...and for the color mgmt to be set to let the printer decide on postscript colors, not illustrator and to use pantone solid coated even though you may be using uncoated paper).
i have my pages that i use to choose what colors and it's dead on.
great resource so you don't waste time playing with as many test prints.
i now have three printers - the 8560, the 6180 so i can print laser on envelopes and an inkjet.
my tiny office looks ridiculous!
