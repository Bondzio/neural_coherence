OS or software.
It is true that the computer will not like to boot up when you do a major change like the MOBO but you should at least get to a point where you get error messages that new hardware is found ETC.
What was the problem that occurred to make the MOBO change?
It could be that it is something else.
Was the CPU changed also?
How about RAM.
When you boot up unplug all except the HDD,Mouse,Keyboard and one optical drive.
Post back.
