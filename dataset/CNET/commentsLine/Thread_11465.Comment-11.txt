many, many thanks for all your help.
edited the security preference in the router gateway to wep and lo the powerbook now logs in fine.
plusnet - who only came up with the correct solution after i had fed the info on the basis of your information - said i would have no problem logging on with my imac which was not the case.
aren't they supposed to know this stuff?!
fortunately i managed to remedy the imac login and now wait to see if i can get my wife's pc (spit) to connect.
heyho best wishes i
