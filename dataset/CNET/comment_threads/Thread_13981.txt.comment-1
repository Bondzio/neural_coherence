I notice the security news that FireWire could be used to bypass your login password because it accesses your RAM.
That got me to thinking: Can you use FireWire to read/write the RAM of the 'puter next to you and could you use this &quot;feature&quot; to turn that RAM into a RAM disk for fast access?
