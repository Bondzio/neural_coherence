Thanks for the link to the forum sticky.
I have the second router set up as a WAP and the signal strength/reception is great.
My only remaining question is about security.
It appears that the wireless from WAP is simply creating a second network that is independent of the wired network downstairs.
Although I gave the WAP the same SSID as my wired network, this signal is unsecured.
Do I assign a different encrption for the WAP and the laptops that use the signal, or is there a way to integrate it into the security of the &quot;original&quot; network SSID?
Thanks for your help.
