Can the Maxtor Shared Storage Plus drive be formatted or split-partitioned in a way to allow backups from both a Windows XP computer and a Mac running Leopard?
I'm using it currently and am very happy with the drive; just wondering what my backup options are going to be when I get my iMac in a couple of weeks.
Also, I have a Canon IP5200 printer connected to the drive with with a USB cable, which I have set up as a network printer.
Anything special I should know about setting it up on the iMac?
Posting to the Maxtor support forums hasn't brought any replies yet.
