that is either not spinning correctly (perhaps the power wire is laying across the blades and is vibrating or dragging) or the video card has a fan of its own that is too close to something as well.
If the system is brand new, I would take it back to the vendor as it's still under warranty rather than mess with opening the case and blowing your warranty out of the ballpark.
