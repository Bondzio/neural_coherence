<s> Also, I want a dual-core processor. </s>
<s> Would it be smarter of me to just buy a desktop and make all the upgrades myself seeing how expensive Pentium D processors are? </s>
<s> How come you aren't going for a SATA interface? </s>
<s> I'm surprised, as most people despise IDE, but there isn't anything wrong with IDE or Ultra-ATA IMO. </s>
<s> Also, I would note that people have had software problems with Windows Media Center and ATI All-In-Wonder cards. </s>
<s> I personally would just buy a TV tuner card and graphics card seperately. </s>
<s> Or maybe it's just becuz I don't like ATI, lol. </s>
<s> It is also possible to buy just the ATI card and XP Home . </s>
<s> Windows Media Center is ''over-hyped'' and has some issues like everything else from Microsoft lol. </s>
<s> With the ATI software you will have the same capabilities as Media Center. </s>
<s> Plus you will save $$$. </s>
<s> Since you desire dual-core, with your socket 939 MOBO you can eventually upgrade to an AMD Athlon X2 cpu when the prices go down. </s>
<s> So building your PC with an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ socket 939 is a good idea . </s>
<s> It is a lower-end cpu and you do not need to spend $$$ on a 3500+ when your going to upgrade to dual-core. </s>
<s> Good RAM and PS supply choice </s>
<s> I'm a newbie to this whole build-it-yourself computer stuff. </s>
<s> Just a quick question, what is a SATA and IDE interface? </s>
<s> And what are the costs and benefits of a SATA vs. IDE? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Are these even in the same category? </s>
<s> If so, which is better? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The nForce 4 Socket 939 MOBOS your looking at, all support a Serial-ATA or SATA interface. </s>
<s> That gives you the option of having a SATA Harddrive. </s>
<s> SATA refers to how the hardware communicates or is connected to your Motherboard. </s>
<s> SATA is supposed to be ''faster'' but its not really significantly. </s>
<s> For more info google Serial-ATA or read this article at Tom's Hardware . </s>
<s> Serial-ATA harddrives are alittle more expensive than IDE drives. </s>
<s> The Western Digital Caviar SE 300GB 3.5'' IDE Ultra ATA100 Hard Drive you picked out is an Ultra ATA or IDE drive . </s>
<s> So you could buy a SATA drive if you make that choice, but the one you picked out would work fine. </s>
<s> Your choice! </s>
<s> Also the SATA interface for CD and DVD drives is still IDE but you will find SATA is starting to emerge in some drives. </s>
<s> Plextor makes some, they are $$$$. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> but if u getting aiw..great cuz i suggested it in my very 1st post the card is good for gaming and multimedia </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for all of your feedback. </s>
<s> It's been very helpful. </s>
<s> Do you think I'm getting the best bang for my buck? </s>
<s> I'm only looking to spend around $1500 on set up. </s>
<s> What do you think I can cheapen up on? </s>

<s> Look at the Coolermaster. </s>
<s> I used one last month, and the tooless design and front ports work well. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811119077 </s>
<s> My first build was kind of scary. </s>
<s> Whatta Ride! </s>
<s> I ended up with some issues that took awhile to figure out. </s>
<s> I had a lot of fun getting my TV tuner, firewire card, 3D glasses, and RAID configured. </s>
<s> I now know the biggest problem was Windows 98. </s>
<s> XP makes all those things easier. </s>
<s> Just remember you can always wipe and reinstall 'til you get it right. </s>
<s> It just takes time and patience. </s>
<s> Get in a hurry, you're doomed. </s>
<s> On another note, I keep seeing Tiger Direct as a recommendation. </s>
<s> Stick with Newegg, you don't want the hassles. </s>
<s> Newegg, Zip Zoom Fly, and a new Chief Value will cover your needs with fast service and great prices. </s>
<s> They don't rely on rebate lies for profit. </s>
<s> IF you're doing it from scatch its a heck of a lot easier than rebuilding. </s>
<s> Make sure to get a cabinet type that will fit the mother board type such as an XT type ,micro ATX or AT ...It was a good thing I had the motherboard book, told me what type and size, I felt I was restricted to that, but the Computer cabinet I have could have taken the largest mobo without a problem - even the different mountings were marked for both mobo types!, but to me this was the key issue - to be able to drop in a motherboard replacement (4 studs and 3 re-uasable plastic support tabs)-that done I was up and running after processor with heatsink and fan, and RAM installation,......NEWEGG is positively great, delivery always on the money thru Fed-Ex, wait for the month end sales - very good deals, you can also read reviews on each product, most customers write about other components they matched stuff up with and how those work , this will give you plenty of ideas of what to buy and what will work together as soon as you plug it in. </s>
<s> Beware, some components do not work well together in many cases that have been documented, there have been motherboard chipset issues with Hard Disk drives and bios setups that you can read about on websites such as techreport.com/reviews and techspot.com as well as informit. </s>
<s> Look forget Tiger Direct, for the best service stick with Newegg, Zip zoomfly and chief value. </s>
<s> Do the research by reading reviews on the components. </s>

<s> LightScribe DVD Burner, who cares, you wait half hour for an image and HP drives are crap, get this Liteon drive http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16827106967 Get off the tiger direct kick unless you just like poor service and paying more for it. </s>
<s> Why not get your video card from newegg, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130203 you save $8 from tiger direct after mail in rebate and shipping, is it worth the hassle? </s>

<s> Who cares right now, Wait until prices come down in 2 years, you'll want a new system anyway. </s>
<s> Looks like you got lots of info on parts. </s>
<s> Here is a link that may be helpfull when you build. </s>
<s> Have fun, john http://www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html </s>

<s> DVD Burner = AOPEN 16X DVD Dual Layer Write with Nero & WINDVD Software However I'm thinking about the NEC from New Egg. </s>
<s> OS= Win XP PRO (Thinking about Vista (Longhorn)). </s>
<s> If you already have your own burning software then get Neweggs NEC DVD burner for $45 (or less). </s>
<s> It's a bargin! </s>
<s> BTW the MB comes with Norton Anti-Virus packaged in it. </s>
<s> The ATI RADEON X800XL is capable of displaying true HD and comes with HD Cable and is compatible with ATI's Crossfire (ATI's version of SLI (Serial Link Interface)). </s>
<s> The ATI HD All in Wonder allows S-Video/Cable and Antenna Input and acts as a PVR (TIVO without a charge!) </s>
<s> With this MB you need 2 sticks of RAM PC3200 to make it work right (I chose 2 GB Kingston 1GB / Stick) The ANTEC Case comes with a 550 12V ATX Power Supply (has 24 pins to power PCI Express on Mother Board and it is Required). </s>
<s> This is a Gaming machine, Audio/Video machine and Server (the MotherBoard has 2 Gb LANs)! </s>
<s> New egg is the place to go! </s>
<s> I know a guy who can build this system for half the price. </s>
<s> I guess that's the price you have to pay for making yourself feel so macho man. </s>
<s> Hi Guys, I just finished a computer similar to the parts you suggest. </s>
<s> I agree with the components, but, your estimated prices are a little high. </s>
<s> I completed mine for under $700.00. </s>
<s> Your much better off buying a case with the power supply you want included. </s>
<s> My case and a 485 watt power supply at Tiger Direct cost $49.95. </s>
<s> Also, it had a 100% rebate. </s>
<s> I know that that is not always available. </s>
<s> I've found from experience that Tiger Direct and New Egg are about the best sources on line. </s>
<s> Tiger seems to have the best sales. </s>
<s> Also, Computer Geeks are pretty good. </s>
<s> You know the old saying: It pays to shop a round. </s>
<s> Goodluck with your build. </s>
<s> If you have an older computer, you'll be amazed with the speed. </s>
<s> Jack (bad penny) </s>
<s> Everyone hypes SATA, but even the older wide SCSI I/O technology can be faster. </s>
<s> For price and grins, I added Tekram 315U card for $20 (21.99 at zipzoom now) 2 50 to 68 pin converters $5 2 IBM DDYS-T18350 18.3GB Ultra3 Wide 68P 10K $240 NOTE: shop prices any 68 pin wide SCSI 3 by vendors well documented will do PRICES VARY GREATLY. </s>
<s> In XP disk mgr - Partition as 1 and you will be surprised on speed. </s>
<s> You gamers will love it. </s>
<s> I'm a little leary of Maxtor lately. </s>
<s> I recently had my Maxtor 120g storage D: drive crash. </s>
<s> It just started beating itself to death from the inside. </s>
<s> Since it was only about 1 1/2 years old they replaced it with a remanufactured unit. </s>
<s> They certainly couldn't do anything about the 80 gigs of files I lost. </s>
<s> I didn't do much backup thinking everything was fine, now I'll suffer for quite awhile. </s>
<s> I'm still in shock at all I've lost. </s>
<s> Now I just replaced a bad motherboard in a Presario 6000 to find the Maxtor HD is also trash. </s>
<s> So far I've seen 2 out of 5 Maxtors go bad. </s>
<s> I don't want to bash them, but all I've read recently coincides with my experience, and recommends Seagate for the best reliability and 5 year warranty. </s>
<s> PEOPLE! </s>
<s> BACK UP YOUR DATA! </s>
<s> Don't be a trusting idiot like me. </s>
<s> NewEgg.com is my fav, and online shopping is the greatest. </s>
<s> However, many brick-and-mortar stores have REBATES that beat anything that online retailers can offer. </s>
<s> Many times you can get a rebate on a retail version of a component cheaper than the OEM version offered online. </s>
<s> Check online at places like CompUSA, Circuit City, Staples, etc. </s>
<s> They usually update their offers every Sunday. </s>
<s> You may not get the great rebate offer on the part when you want it, but you can save BIGTIME on a part or two. </s>
<s> Only drawback is that you have to wait a few weeks for your savings to come in. </s>
<s> Also, don't forget comparison shopping sites like PriceGrabber.com. </s>
<s> I think if you wanted to make a negative comment here, you did very well! </s>
<s> This is a person that is asking advice. </s>
<s> Not a nevative comment from somebody that knows somebody else, that can do this or that for 1/2 price!This guy is doing something that most &quot;Macho guys&quot; wouldn't even try on their own! </s>
<s> I suggest you find another place to spred your negative responses! </s>
<s> If I miss understood what you ment by your remark, then I apologize.If not...... </s>
<s> There's a cheese stick in every croud. </s>
<s> Surely I build my computers just to watch the hair on my knuckles grow. </s>
<s> Forget about the sense of accomplishment, the satisfaction of doing it myself and getting it right. </s>
<s> Not to mention all I've learned about computers in the process. </s>
<s> Who lifted the rock to let this pop tart out? </s>
<s> I was agreeing with 5ron5. </s>
<s> I have 4 computers and want to take all the newer parts from them and rearrange them into 2, possibly 3, computers each for a different purpose. </s>
<s> My late husband built all of them and I am stuck with them the way they are now which doesn't do me much good for MY purposes. </s>
<s> I know more than the average bear about software but when it comes to hardware I am quite intimidated. </s>
<s> I can not afford to have someone else do this for me and I don't have anyone close who knows enough to help me with this daunting project. </s>
