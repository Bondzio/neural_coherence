I am using a Startech DVI over Cat 6 Active Extender (powered transmitter/receivers) with a 50ft cat6 cable. &lt;div&gt;The computer is a Dell Optiplex 330 with a ATI Radeon HD2400 (about 3 years old) with DVI output. I am connecting it to a NEC v422 - 42'' LCD commercial monitor. The first time I booted it, it worked fine. When I restarted the CPU the problems started. Every time I power on the computer I see the windows loading page, but then the screen loses the signal before it actually reaches windows (it gets lost somewhere between the black windows loading page and before it get to the blue windows loading). Sometimes it wont even catch any signal For troubleshooting I replaced the Optiplex with a mac mini - no problem there. Then tried with a Dell Laptop with hdmi output and worked well even with a hdmi to dvi converter. But everytime I connect it with the Optiplex it does the same issue. I also plugged a 25 ft dvif from the optiplex straight to the LCD, worked fine too (obviously). What is the problem here? Do you think a more recent video card will be better? Does anyone have an idea? Thanks! &lt;/div&gt;

Does the monitor have an INF file for Vista that you can install on the PC? Also if you have ATI CCC installed, check settings for the display when PC and monitor are directly connected; set it to auto detect. Other things to try: update ATI driver/CCC, preferably from card manufacturer site and not directly from AMD. Also StarTech might have a clue why the HD2400 can't work with their extender. If all fails, you might as well try a different video card.
