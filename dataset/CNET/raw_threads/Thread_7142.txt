Is there a USB connector that I can use to do this? It doesn't have to be an external enclosure although that would be nice!

If the drive is dead, there is not much that you can do for it outside of trying some of the professional services in your area or sending it in to IBM. If it's your old laptop that's dead, you may have a spot in your new laptop for a second drive (some do some don't) and you can just install your drive in the new laptop (or have a shop do it as laptop modifications aren't for the faint of heart). Then retrieve the info you want and either remove the old drive, or format it and use it as extra storage (but 6.5G is pretty small IMO.) I'd seen some enclosures for IDE drives with IEEE 1334 connectors and one that used USB (txfer rate was very slow), but they were pricey, and they used normal desktop IDE connectors not laptop IDE connectors.

13902	5	154473	1722104	1717651	Willy	2/5/06 9:20 AM	1.1391312E12	I've done this	Here's what I've done provided the new laptop has USB port. I have a 2.5 adapter for *desktop* use whicj allows installing the laptop HD(w/adapter) to the desktop system. The laptop Hd is seen as another HD, thus retrieve data. You swap data in order to burn to CD or flash drive. If flash drive using data retrieved place into laptop USB and retrieve, repeat if necessary. If CD, use that method provided the new laptop has CD drive as well to retrieve data. I use the 2.5HD adapter method more often and can reformat 2.5HD to install back to problem laptops if HD poblem. As for ext. USB enclosure, yes you can do that as well. Once brought, get then reformat x-days provided happy with results. You now have an ext. HD for later usage. tada -----Willy

IDE connection provided by your desktop. Be sure to change the 2.5HD ID plug to slave as most come setup as master for laptop use.

It also comes with a converter for a laptop Hard drive. http://www.pcmicrostore.com/PartDetail.aspx?q=p:10502660;c:36142

Then copy to an external. just if you're lookin for other options. -jon

They are very simple to use. Just connect the drive to one end of the connector, put it in the case, connect using USB 2.0 without any power outlets. All bus powered. It also doesn't require drivers if you are running Windows XP on the computer your are recovering TO.

Hi, The easyest way I have used several times is to get yourself an adaptor connector so that you can connect it directly to any free IDE cable/connector in your normal desktop machine. These adaptors connect on one side to the 2.5&quot;HD from your laptop and on the other side directly to an empty IDE cable connector. Once installed in your PC you will see it as another HD in &quot;My Computer&quot;. If not, rightclick on &quot;My Computer&quot; and than click on &quot;Manage&quot;. Click on &quot;Disk Management&quot; and than on the new drive you will see. Often you have to change the drive letter, but after that you will just have it available in &quot;My Computer&quot; and you can copy all the files you want to keep. You can even &quot;clone&quot; this disk to another one with programs like Acronis True Image and the like or just keep and use it as it is. These adapter connectors are quite cheap and you will find them in the better computer shops or perhaps at Radio Shack. Cheers, Joseph.

You do get what you pay for in many cases. Can you recommend a higher-quality adapter?
13902	15	154473	1750466	1750224	czar99	2/17/06 5:47 AM	1.14015522E12	Power options	I do not have this brand, I have had mine for a year or two and never had a problem. But one thing you can do is use an extra power conector in your case from your known good power supply. Also if it is a laptop hard drive you could connect the converter from laptop IDE to regular IDE and then plug it in uyour machine like a regular hard drive and then boot up, also using a power cord inside your machine. There are other brands I just did a quick google search and that was the first one I found.

I've used such things and have come to call these items a &quot;commodity.&quot; As to the naysayers that call cheap solutions bad and tell of stories of fried drives what can we do? Never happened to any of us at the office and there must be 100 of these boxes we bought from newegg.com or geeks.com and slipped a drive into. Bob

It is plug and play, and hot swappable. I used one to get the data off my niece's hard drive from her Gateway laptop that she spilled a Big gulp on that would no longer boot-up. Worked like a dream and only cost $10. Plus she now has a 20gb USB drive for $10.

Take the drive out of the dead laptop, put it in enclosure and connect to your new computer with included USB cable. You will be able to drag and drop the data you want onto your new computer as long as the old hard drive still spins. Then after you have recovered your data you can reformat the old drive in the enclosure and you will then have a 20gb or more USB drive for back up storage.
