i have just installed the di-624 to set up my wireless network at home.
i followed the instructions, changed the ssid, changed the admin password, and enabled wep 128bit encryption with a random key.
(i was going to use wpa, but my laptop does not accept wpa, so i am using wep.)
my landline computer has internet security with firewall enabled and internet virus scan.
first, is there an easy way to test to see if i have adequately protected my wireless network so that no one can use my network or gain access to my home computer?
second, i haven't figured out how to properly set up the firewall on the di-624 itself.
is this necessary or is having the firewall on my computer sufficient.
i'm a newbie at the whole wireless realm, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
