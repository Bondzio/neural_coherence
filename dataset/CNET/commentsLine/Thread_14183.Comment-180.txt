the first time i started using a personal computer was in the 80s.
1- a pocket computer from casio (  ) 2- then a sinclair zx 81 (  ) 3- then came the ncr decision mate v (  ) which i traded with 4- a atari 520 stf (  ), 5- and then a atari 1040 ste.
i traded the atari 1040 ste with 6- a personal computer (a pc pentium 1).
take care everyone.
