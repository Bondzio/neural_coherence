i'm going to head over to microcenter and purchase a usb enclosure, i have the hd in the freezer still so maybe i can fire it up again.
i would like to try and take the info from there and put it back on my hard drive.
i'm not too concerned with the drivers and what not, i replaced most of them using the back up cd but my documents, pics, and music are important.
when i was copying the data from the old hd, i couldn't find any specific folders that had &quot;my documents&quot; or &quot;my music etc.
and i had my win7 library set up with about 20 different subfolders as well but i guess i can kiss that all goodbye since i reinstalled the os after i replaced the hard drive.
thank you for all of your help steven, it is greatly appreciated.
