<s> I am looking to buy a laptop with three antennas capable of 450 Mbps speed. </s>
<s> 3x3 MIMO. </s>
<s> The only one I know of is the Alienware 17 and 18 inch, which have the Killer 1103 wireless card pre-installed and 3 antennas. </s>
<s> I think the new MacBook Pro has an Intel Centrino Ultimate Wireless-N 6300. </s>
<s> Are there any others that anyone knows about? </s>
<s> There was a Dell E5210 but it is discontinued. </s>
<s> Why would you limit your laptop choice when there may be other feature just as important like memory or processor speeds. </s>
<s> I would just use a external USB or bridge. </s>
<s> In most cases these actually work better because many have external antenna. </s>
<s> Another advantage is you do not have to worry about how your laptop screen is positioned (the antennas are normally behind the screen). </s>
<s> All that said 450m is another magic marketing number. </s>
<s> You will only get that in a lab condition and in many cases it will actually make your connection slower. </s>
<s> Since to get 450m they use the complete 2.4g range. </s>
<s> This means if anyone else near you has a wireless router they are 100% guaranteed to interfere with you. </s>
<s> Your router will try to fix this by changing the speeds and encoding on the fly but this changing is a common cause of dropping and authentication delays. </s>
<s> It's not going to say, give it double the range so why would I not look at the entire machine instead? </s>
<s> Current models, that is the ones that are not in the cheap category seem just fine on WiFi. </s>

<s> I use an Asus N66U Black Knight 3x3 stream 450 Mbps router and EA66U 3x3 access point now. </s>
<s> In order to get full advantage of this speed, I need a laptop with three antennas using either an Intel Centrino Wireless-N 6300 or Killer 1103. </s>
<s> The only 3x3 MIMO laptops I can find are MacBook Pro and Alienware M17 and M18. </s>
<s> Even with 3 antennas, it only uses one at a time. </s>
<s> It will use the best one and that's why it could work better than some. </s>
<s> The real issue would be the cards. </s>
<s> If you can't find laptops with compatible cards then you can use external cards. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Actually what he is talking about is a option that actually has 3 separate transmitters. </s>
<s> A lot of the early routers were running other variants of mimo have to read the fine print. </s>
<s> Lots of technical arguments about if it really makes any difference or not. </s>
<s> I can see why many laptops do not have this since it has to eat 3 times the power to run 3 radio units. </s>
<s> As ideas come and go, it's like that super duper device you had back on CP/M and you fast forward to now and no one knows what to do with it or how it worked. </s>
<s> Since 3 radios would be more cost as well as the heat, it probably fell out of favor as higher rate 802.11n came along that was more a standard than a 3 radio solution. </s>
<s> Maybe it's time to move to today's solutions or when high speed is needed, get wired. </s>
<s> I know I get wired when I want to move big files (the laptops here have 1000BT ports.) </s>
