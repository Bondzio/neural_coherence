You hope it's the interface and not the drive itself.
You open the case and remove the drive.
With a little luck, it will have a standard PATA or SATA drive on the inside.
Most do but I've seen some proprietaries.
If it's just a standard drive, you connect it to a port on the motherboard.
Cross your fingers, boot the machine and hope its recognized.
If so, you extract your data and make immediate extra backups.
Afterward, you replace your external with two of them.
Good luck.
