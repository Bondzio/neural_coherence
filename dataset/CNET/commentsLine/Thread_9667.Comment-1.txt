hey everyone.
i have a compaq presario 5102us that will be 3 years old in september.
i have windows xp professional as the operating system.
about 2 weeks ago i had to repair windows xp and everything's back to normal.
but now, and even before i had to repair it, the computer would just restart itself and it's really annoying.
it can be just sitting there, without me doing anything on it or while being on it and it just restarts.
also, sometimes when it's loading up, it gets to my wallpaper and then restarts again.
can someone please help me??
it is very annoying to have my pc just restart out of nowhere, especially when i'm running my ad-aware, avg and things to keep it from having viruses, spyware and such.
