After checking out everything here at cnet and at a site tomeshardware.com I figured out that the AMD x2 either the 4200 or the 3800 will more than do what I want it to do.
Now I have to decide between the Hp or Gateway variations.
Not this computer but the next I will probably build it.
All tests I saw had the AMD x2's dominating the Intel D's.
