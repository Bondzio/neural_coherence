dude there is no way in hell u can make ur pc faster.
if u buy more ram it shal do it but not that much.
funny thing the ram will be worth more than the pc itself lol.
sell ur pc to some in experienced person for $200 then save up more and build ur own.
or u can of coarse blow it up that's always fun.
or ur best bet will be to overclock the hell out of it.
that's wat people do as there last resort if there pc is about ready to be thrown away.
here is a cool fact since procesors with slow mhz and in general cpu's that r slow they overclock very well on good cooling.
