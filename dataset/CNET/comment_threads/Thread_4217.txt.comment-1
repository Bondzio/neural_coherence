Hi buyer brown here Hope all is well I wanted to know: Since I feel safe to say that computers no longer come with floppy drives anymore And it seems that I have been reading a lot about flash drives are suppose to be the new floppy, Although I have yet to find one that acts like a floppy on any of my pcs I tried The Hp solution and some other tutorials but none of them have worked for me as of yet.
Of course I change the boot order as well, No dont get me wrong Im sure that it works in some way just not for me or Im doing something wrong So what are Real IT pros using is it better to just get a portable floppy drive and why and why dont computer creators just make it so usbs also act like a floppy they knew floppy was dead and something had to replace it Thanks
