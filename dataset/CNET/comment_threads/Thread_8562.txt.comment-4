I always liked my trusty wired one more.
My battery always seemed to go low during a game of source so I threw it away.
I got my keyboard from a goodwill equivalent for $4 and couldn't be happier.
I have yet to see a KB under $70 that is as nice to type on as this baby.
You can save a lot of money by going to good will for crap like that.
The DVD burner... if you go to newegg they sell 20x drives for under $50.
And spend $10 at xiode.com to get some thumb screws.
Lots of em.
They just make everything look so much cleaner (When they all match, inside and out).
