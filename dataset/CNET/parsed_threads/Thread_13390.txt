<s> I have a Dell Dimension 5100 (Windows XP Pro) and a Dimension E310 (Windows XP Media Center Edition) connected to a 2Wire 2701HG-B (bundled with At&t high speed internet). </s>
<s> The E310 is connected with Wireless and the 5100 is hard wired. </s>
<s> When to access the workgroup on the E310 it gives a error message saying: &quot;Mshome is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available&quot; </s>
<s> I know that on my router, if you access the settings through the hard-wired PC, you can choose to encrypt it with a pass, but then your laptop would prompt you for it. </s>
<s> But, you can also encrypt certain features on the wireless networking, allowing certain computers access to certain options or something. </s>
<s> Try recreating your network if you can't find the answer. </s>
<s> Or repair your network status and permissions. </s>
<s> This is a link from Google. </s>
<s> It discusses the problem you have: http://www.anetforums.com/posts.aspx?ThreadIndex=14476 Hope that helps. </s>

<s> I haven't tried recreating my network yet. </s>
<s> You have an account on your machine called blue but does blue have an account on the other machines? </s>
<s> If not the error message is proper. </s>
