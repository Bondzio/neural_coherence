1.1.1	I just assembled a new computer ( my first self-build ) with an ASUS P5GD1 motherboard , in a Thermaltake SViking case .	St
1.1.2	I 'm using an Intel Pentium 4 530 3.0GHz CPU , socket LGA775 .	St
1.1.3	My ambient case temp , as detected by the case 's internal sensor , is about 32-35 deg C. My motherboard temp hovers around 40 C. However , my CPU temp does n't go below 65 , and frequently spikes above 70 when I 'm opening programs , installing software , booting up , etc .	St
1.1.4	When I first booted up it was around 87 C , but it settled .	St
1.1.5	When I installed the HSF ( heatsink fan ) one of the pegs would n't *click* into the motherboard , so I lifted it up , rotated it 90 degrees , and placed it again .	St
1.1.6	It worked .	St
1.1.7	However , I noticed that after I took it off one corner of the thermal pad was slightly smudged .	St
1.1.8	Do n't know if this has anything to do with my heat problem .	St
1.1.9	I 'm running an ASUS EN6600/TD 256MB graphics card , and I 've been told that the GeForce chips have a driver problem that causes excessive heat .	St
1.1.10	However , since my case ambient temperature and motherboard temperature are about normal , I do n't think this is the problem .	St
1.1.11	What do *you* think ?	Ques
1.1.12	Help appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	different positions by 90 degrees .	St
1.2.2	I feel quite certain that you do NOT have the HSF mounted properly .	St
1.2.3	My experience is that there is only one proper orientation .	St
1.2.4	Those CPU temps are terrible , although they may not be valid reasons .	St
1.2.5	the Intel CPUs should have shut down if it hit 70 C internally , it should have throttled back before that .	St
1.2.6	The CPU is normally not in the center of the HSF assembly , thus giving only one proper mounting position .	St
1.3.1	Windows auto shut down at around 75 degrees .	St
1.3.2	What heatsink do u have ?	Ques
1.3.3	I think it is not properly seated .	St
1.3.4	And with those temperatures , the life of the CPU is gon na shorten and if u dont fix it probably gon na fry within a year .	St
1.3.5	Pentium 4s generally run around 50 degrees .	St
1.3.6	How r u getting ur readings ?	Ques
1.3.7	Could it be ur program is wrong ?	Ques
