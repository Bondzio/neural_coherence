do I have to defrag the RAID?
And if so do I need a special program for it or just use anything?
(I prefer Ultimate Defrag) Obviously I have no experience at all with RAID's, as I said in the original post the only time I've made a RAID is on a Mac and that was as simple as &quot;Click and drag the hard drives you want to be in the RAID to this box.&quot; and I was done.
Lol.
I just don't want this to be like when I bought a video card completely clueless and ended up with a &quot;cheap&quot; $120 card.
