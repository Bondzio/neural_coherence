<s> I recently purchased one more stick of Mushkin SP3200 512MB 184-Pin DDR SDRAM to add to the two that I already had. </s>
<s> My motherboard is a Chaintech ZNF3-250 that supports up to 2 gigs of ram with 3 slots, but when I insert the new stick and boot up the PC it stays on the startup screen. </s>
<s> It shows &quot;Memory Testing: 1572864K , Memory Frequency is: [blank]&quot;. </s>
<s> I'm not much of a hardware troubleshooting person so I have no idea what to do. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> to try each stick separately. </s>
<s> Then all possible pairs. </s>
<s> [one pair, of course is the original pair] Couls also change which slot each is in. </s>
<s> Also read the manually thorughly,regarding memory capability. </s>
<s> I tried every possible combination using the original pair in different slots but I still get the same result. </s>
<s> The manual doesn't say much about memory except that it can support three 184-pin DDR DIMMs up to 2GB and it doesn't have any sort of troubleshooting in regards to memory. </s>
<s> Should I try one of the BIOS or Mobo drivers from their site? </s>

<s> http://www.memtest86.com/ Download it, run from a floppy, with only the new stick in the computer. </s>
<s> Other possibilities, the configuration of the memory chips on the new memory stick are not compatible with the mobo [if a proprietary type, got to crucial.com and search for your model number to see if you chose the correct type. </s>
<s> Also check what CAS [CL] the new memory is compared to the old, and check what settings for memory CAS is set in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Try using &quot;by SPD&quot; and also try using the slowest CAS setting 3 if DDR. </s>
<s> highest number for each parameter. </s>
<s> Make sure your bios is updated and chipset drivers are installed. </s>
<s> They're available from the site you previously provided the link for. </s>
<s> it looks like you didn't do as Ray suggested. </s>
<s> Try EACH stick (one at a time) in the slot the MOBO manual lists as being for single sticks (varies with each board). </s>
<s> After determining that all the sticks are good, then try the combinations as recommended by the manual. </s>
<s> By adding that 3rd stick, you probably lose dual-channel support. </s>
