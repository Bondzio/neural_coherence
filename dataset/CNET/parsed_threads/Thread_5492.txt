<s> Does anyone have any great ideas about how to get data OFF of my ext hd? </s>
<s> The hard drive (used successfully less than 1 month) is definitely bad, and WD Support says &quot;Well if possible, move all data off the drive. </s>
<s> At this point, you will need to have the drive replace.&quot; Running WinXP, ext HD is Western Digital Passport 160gb. </s>
<s> Have tried connecting ext HD to a desktop, just in case problem was with my laptop - no good. </s>
<s> When I connect ext HD, all is good. </s>
<s> then once I start to actually use the thing, it eventually stops responding so i disconnect ext hd, reconnect, and resume. </s>
<s> generally, can copy a few files over to laptop before it stops, but with over 40gb already on there, i could be at this all year. </s>
<s> anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> I am furious about the cavalier attitude that WD is taking about my data! </s>
<s> To pull the drive out of the case and apply directly to the forehead. </s>
<s> Ahh no I mean the desktop's internal spare IDE connection. </s>
<s> If you're lucky, the PC will boot and see the drive and you can copy data off. </s>
<s> If not then software like Zero Assumption Recovery (there's a demo) is tried. </s>
<s> -&gt; About cavalier. </s>
<s> Where is your backup copy? </s>
<s> Hard disks will fail. </s>
<s> You just don't know when. </s>

<s> ... technology... </s>
<s> Sorry if it wasn't clear in the original post - this is an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I certainly have had hard drives fail before, but I guess I figured that an external hard drive, expecially one used for 1 month, never bumped, in fact never traveled off of the desk wouldn't put me through this. </s>
<s> And, perhaps dumb questions, but what is the point of a 160gb ext hard drive if that has to be backed up as well? </s>
<s> It's still a hard disk. </s>
<s> And to add insult to injury I found I could corrupt many USB hard disks if they were used as supplied. </s>
<s> Many come with the somewhat unstable FAT32 formatting so just a matter of writing to the drive and pulling the USB cable can have the entire contents vanish. </s>
<s> It's a magic trick I use to show how unstable these devices are when fresh out of the box. </s>
<s> I proceed to the second magic trick of wiping the drive, then making a NTFS partition. </s>
<s> While NTFS is not damage proof it certainly has faired better in my torture tests. </s>
<s> Do they tell you this? </s>
<s> (no.) </s>
<s> -&gt; You're right to think that it shouldn't need to be backed up but the truths remain that it's a hard disk and could be the stock fragile FAT32 formatting. </s>
<s> Good luck in recovery. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, my stinky little hard drive must've &quot;understood&quot; how angry I was - just after I posted, I managed to get ONE SOLID HOUR of the HD staying mounted! </s>
<s> Have managed to recover most of the data, so i got that goin' for me. </s>
<s> which is nice. </s>
<s> thanks a million (or maybe even 160gb?!) </s>
<s> for your assistance, bob. </s>
<s> since I don't think I'll be able to get my money back, guess I am stuck with getting a new WD HD. </s>
<s> will reformat to NTFS the second I get it home! </s>
<s> tangentially, do you have any opinions about one mfg or another? </s>
<s> who makes the best ext HD? </s>
<s> jenni, the soon-to-be NTFS magician </s>
<s> Hard disk cases that are well ventilated. </s>
<s> I like a small quiet fan but if it's for some server room I don't wince at a louder fan that pushes more air. </s>
<s> At the office most USB drives are self assembled units. </s>
<s> We get some drive on sale and then pick up some USB housing. </s>
<s> All of us know what a screwdriver is so it's not very challenging to put the 2 parts together. </s>
<s> -&gt; Let me share what I use to sync my stuff with my external drive. </s>
<s> SYNCBACK (google.com) gets this done for me. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I like it. </s>
<s> wish I had been daring enough to do that. </s>
<s> another question - would you suggest that i replace the HD, or iyho would reformatting to NTFS suffice? </s>
<s> suggestions on &quot;reading material&quot; on reformatting to NTFS? </s>
<s> i see that in &quot;my computer&quot;, if i right click on the hd and select &quot;format&quot;, there is the option to reformat to NTFS - does that reformat the same as from cmd? </s>
<s> whoops, guess that is more than one question. </s>
<s> but you'll bare with me, won't you, bob? </s>
<s> jenni, the ever-curious </s>
<s> Use XP's Disk Management (see start, help...) and then remove the partition on said drive, create it fresh and let it quick format it. </s>
<s> If the drive is suspect I'll later test it. </s>
<s> To manually start the disk scanner if your computer is formatted with the NTFS file system, run Chkdsk /f /r on the new drive letter (start, run, CMD and enter the command there. </s>
<s> You must restart your computer before the disk scan begins. </s>
<s> Be sure to have a spare hour for it to work. </s>
