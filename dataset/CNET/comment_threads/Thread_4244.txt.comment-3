I put the old data in a folder on my laptop.
I tried to transfer the old files to the new hard drive by copy/paste but I ran into issues because I received an error message that I didn't have &quot;permissions&quot; to make any changes.
So I created a folder called Toshiba HD and dropped the old files in there.
I don't think I can use the old hard drive as back up storage (or at least I can't afford for a professional to attempt to fix it for me) or I'd just buy another hd caddy and make it a salve to the other because there is a second bay to install another hd on my laptop.
I'm basically just trying to get my old documents/settings, pics, and music back on my laptop.
Shame on me for not back it up, it'll NEVER happen again.
