<s> HP deskjet 3420 model printer, very new and the printer head won't move when sent a print job. </s>
<s> Can hear a spinning sound like it's trying to move. </s>
<s> Was working fine. </s>
<s> Have checked all settings and all appear to be correct. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I'm not a techie so simple answers would help greatly. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Do a printer &quot;self-test&quot;, review your manual or help guide on how that's done with your model printer. </s>
<s> If it can't print a self-test page, then likely the printer is hosed. </s>
<s> Check to see that the ink carts are firmly seated and/or if any blinking leds are present on the printer. </s>
<s> Until, you do a self-test don't mess with windows at all, you may cause further problems. </s>
<s> Also, the support website at HP should explain common problems and resolutions. </s>
<s> You can aslo try the printer's &quot;toolbox&quot; if applicable for your model, it should provide some insight and maybe a self-test as well. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I'd lift the cover up, or open the back (think that's where HPs have a door) to look for a paper jam. </s>
<s> As Willy pointed out, look for a blinking light. </s>
<s> Can mean many things, including a paper jam. </s>
