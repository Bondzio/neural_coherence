<s> My hard drive recently stopped working after my laptop took a fall. </s>
<s> I replaced the hd with a new one and re-installed the os (win7) So my laptop is up and running again. </s>
<s> Here's the hard part, I used a usb to sata converter for my old hard drive to pull the data off, I've recovered a good portion of the files now how do I put them to use on my laptop with the new hd? </s>
<s> I've copied the files from the old hd and saved them in a folder already. </s>
<s> It's mostly pics, music, and documents. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> you have a 2.5&quot; from the old laptop that allowed you to extract some data. </s>
<s> I'd think you could buy a USB enclosure and put the drive in that and just reconnect it to the laptop. </s>
<s> But what you didn't tell is what you've already put the old data on. </s>
<s> You might offer that information. </s>
<s> I put the old data in a folder on my laptop. </s>
<s> I tried to transfer the old files to the new hard drive by copy/paste but I ran into issues because I received an error message that I didn't have &quot;permissions&quot; to make any changes. </s>
<s> So I created a folder called Toshiba HD and dropped the old files in there. </s>
<s> I don't think I can use the old hard drive as back up storage (or at least I can't afford for a professional to attempt to fix it for me) or I'd just buy another hd caddy and make it a salve to the other because there is a second bay to install another hd on my laptop. </s>
<s> I'm basically just trying to get my old documents/settings, pics, and music back on my laptop. </s>
<s> Shame on me for not back it up, it'll NEVER happen again. </s>
<s> on the same hard drive? </s>
<s> Then you should be able to put the old drive into a USB enclosure and copy out the data from there as long as the drive is still accessible. </s>
<s> The other method would have been to use a USB flash drive. </s>
<s> Maybe I'm not seeing the issue properly but it seems to me that copying the data to other media would have been...and still might be...the way to go. </s>
<s> Right, I was able to copy the data and create a new folder in my library on the new hard drive. </s>
<s> The old drive was moderately functional. </s>
<s> I just don't know what to do with the files to get my settings, documents and pics and music back to where it was. </s>
<s> The files I copied don't say my documents or my music...when I open them it's like reading a foreign language, that's the reason I was trying to paste them to my new drive (c) but it wouldn't allow me to do that because I didn't have permission to do so (still not understanding that one). </s>
<s> And I do appreciate your input in case I hadn't mentioned that before! </s>
<s> your &quot;my documents&quot; folders and sub-folder but just random files from the hard drive, did you? </s>
<s> All you really needed was what you created or saved in the way of personal data and not files from programs. </s>
<s> Sorry, but I can't picture at all what you did now or what the files were. </s>
<s> You said the old drive was &quot;moderately functional&quot;. </s>
<s> Is it possible that it still may be in that condition? </s>
<s> If so, a USB enclosure might allow you access to your &quot;my documents&quot; folder to just extract what you have deliberately saved. </s>
<s> There may also be stuff in the downloads folder if you used the default Windows structure. </s>
<s> I'm going to head over to Microcenter and purchase a USB enclosure, I have the HD in the freezer still so maybe I can fire it up again. </s>
<s> I would like to try and take the info from there and put it back on my hard drive. </s>
<s> I'm not too concerned with the drivers and what not, I replaced most of them using the back up cd but my documents, pics, and music are important. </s>
<s> When I was copying the data from the old hd, I couldn't find any specific folders that had &quot;my documents&quot; or &quot;my music etc. </s>
<s> And I had my win7 library set up with about 20 different subfolders as well but I guess I can kiss that all goodbye since I reinstalled the os after I replaced the hard drive. </s>
<s> Thank you for all of your help Steven, it is greatly appreciated. </s>
