One of the 98 computers had the printer (hp deskjet series 5550). I took the printer off that pentium II win 98 box (pc due to retire) and installed the printer directly connected to the new Vista box. That went well. (enough). I added the printer as a network printer to the win XP machine, and printed a test page. Wow, that went well! I tried to &quot;add printer&quot; on the pentium 4 win 98 box. :.-&lt; &quot;Browse for network printer&quot; will not find the printer connected to the Vista box. I can't guess a path to the printer that works from the 98 box. In XP shared printer is ok, in 98 &quot;add printer&quot; can't find shared printer, printer works well locally in Vista. How do I use Vista printer from Win 98 computer? Thanks! B

It might want the drivers disk to do this, if you dont have a disk, google for win98 drivers. This is the process to add drivers to an XP box, the Vista process might be a little different, but similar, look around for similar settings or titles to the ones I mentioned.

That's why I did not remember doing this. The choices are: Itanium, x64, x86. I'm beginning to feel non-supported by Vista! Still, I oughtta be able to *find* the shared printer. I'm gonna go look for it again. Thanks Scottwang!
