<s> Hello all, I just put in a new motherboard (MSI tech KM4M-V) with an Athlon XP 2000+ on a system I bought on e-bay a few years back. </s>
<s> (Old MB had ''given up the ghost''.) </s>
<s> I reinstalled the olds heatsink after cleaning the CPU core and heatsink an adding some fresh silicone thermal compound from Comp USA. </s>
<s> It runs fine and dandy... but according to the BIOS (Award v.1.4)... the CPU temperature is peaking out at 65C. </s>
<s> I've checked the documentation... the burn-out factor for this CPU is 90C... and all my Googling tells me that they run hot. </s>
<s> I let the PC sit overnight in a cool room with the case open. </s>
<s> Pressed the power button and within 4 seconds was in the ''PC Health'' secton of the BIOS... the CPU was showing 49C and slowly climbing. </s>
<s> Should I assume that the CMOS temperature reading may be mis-calibrated? </s>
<s> The heatsink is pleasantly warm... but never scalding hot. </s>
<s> My options... replacing the ''stock'' heatsink and fan... or simply cleaning and the heatsink/cpu AGAIN and changing to ''arctic silver 5''. </s>
<s> Or possibly adding another fan to the case? </s>
<s> I ordered one of those PC Card exhaust fans from tigerdirect last night. </s>
<s> My case does not seem to be set up for case fans, though... but there are a set of ''aeration holes'' near the back below the CPU... can a fan be mounted there? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Motherboard temps can be off as much as 5 to 10 degrees, sometimes more. </s>
<s> You should check the difference between idle and under load. </s>
<s> Shouldn't be more than 10 to 20 degrees. </s>
<s> As a precaution I would remove the heatsink and replace the thermal compound with arctic silver 5. </s>
<s> Just remember a little goes along way, use too much and it will insulate against the heat and prevent proper cooling.A very thin film is enough. </s>
<s> Also, make sure the heatsink is properly positioned.Just a few tips incase your not familiar with the process. </s>
<s> is the surface of the CPU which you cannot really get close to. </s>
<s> The heatsink surface should be considerably cooler. </s>
<s> What temp does the CPU peak at when running with the case cover off and running programs that put a little load on the CPU? </s>
<s> That'll tell you if adding case cooling will help. </s>
<s> With the case closed it seems to Max out around 65 - 66C. </s>
<s> With the case open it runs about 5 degrees cooler. </s>
<s> If I were to put a fan on the back of the case, under the PSU and just under the CPU... should it exhaust to blow are in? </s>
<s> There appears to be no opening in the front... just a row of slits in the side (bottom) of the chassis. </s>
<s> Thansks again. </s>

<s> out [exhaust]. </s>
<s> Very unusual case to not have a hole pattern in the rear for mounting a fan. </s>
<s> Re the possibility of a front intake. </s>
<s> Look very closely at the front from inside the computer. </s>
<s> Don't be surprised to see a place to mount a fan. </s>
<s> Many cases will not show the air intakes on the front plastic of the case. </s>
<s> The air gets pulled in from the bottom front of the case and flows between the plastic front panel and the metal structure of the case. </s>
<s> If one has the tower sitting on the floor, it becomes a great source of dust bunnies for that fan regardless how good a housekeeper there is. </s>
<s> Do a google search for &quot;Speed Fan&quot;, download and install that. </s>
<s> You can use its readings to compare to the BIOS readings, as well as being able to watch temp in real time. </s>
<s> I've been using SpeedFan... thanks for that. </s>
<s> Also bee suign &quot;BurnIN&quot; to test the CPU under load. </s>
<s> Actually, I do see the holes for the fans on both ends of the case... but as you say, the plastic cover in the front confused me. </s>
<s> I just reapplied the CPU with Artic Silver 5, and also picked up a copper heatsink and new fan... </s>
<s> I noted that my old 'stock' fan said &quot;Budget&quot; on it. </s>
<s> So far, so good... </s>
<s> I'm seemingly running cooler now. </s>
<s> With the case shut... it was running 65C+ under load before... now it's maxing out around 58 or 59C. </s>
<s> When my PCI exhaust fan comes in the mail, I'll mount that below the graphics card and see if I can't take another degree or two off. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
