<s> May be an odd question(or may be not). </s>
<s> Just added a breakout box to my computer. </s>
<s> Headphone, Microphone, and 2 USB plugs work fine. </s>
<s> My problem is the firewire plug. </s>
<s> The cable for it has connections for a header(as did the others). </s>
<s> My Firewire card's internal connection is a plug. </s>
<s> Now to my question. </s>
<s> Are there firewire plugs available? </s>
<s> The other choice would be to buy a firewire cable and cut the end off and graft it. </s>
<s> This is also a problem. </s>
<s> The header connections are labeled, but I have no way to match those to the plug wires. </s>
<s> If anyone can point me to a source for a 1394 plug and/or a means of identification of wires I would greatly appreciate it. </s>

<s> You need to give us exact brand name and model numbers of what you want to connect, too many possibilities. </s>
<s> Actually, Jeff, I did give the pertinent info, with the exception of specifying it as 1394a. </s>
<s> Finding a male plug end isn't a good idea online. </s>
<s> Shipping would make it more expensive than it needs to be. </s>
<s> Finding the cheapest cable locally and cutting the plug off and splicing the wires seems the best bet. </s>
<s> I've found more info than I'll ever need, except the simplest question. </s>
<s> Are all 6-pin 1394a exactly the same except for length? </s>
<s> If I cut into any given cable, am I going to find the same color wires going to the same contacts as any other plug on any other cable. </s>
<s> Since they adopted the 1394a-2000 protocol, you could assume this is the case. </s>
<s> But assumptions can kill equipment. </s>
<s> Different wire makers could figure internal structure wouldn't matter as long as the cable worked. </s>
<s> I did hours of research and never found this issue addressed or diagramed. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> In short. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> To drive the cost to the lowest levels, I can only guess what color wires you find inside may as well be all grey. </s>
<s> Answer? </s>
<s> Use an ohm meter to ring it out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, Bob. </s>
<s> Thats what I was leery about. </s>
<s> One vender had a break-down of their cables, showing the same colors, that was the best I could find. </s>
<s> I'll be very, very careful. </s>
