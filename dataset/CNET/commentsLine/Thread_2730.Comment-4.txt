i am currently having the same problem.
i have a self-built pc with windows vista ultimate 64-bit edition.
has been running for about 6 months with no problems, then out of the blue, when i start my computer, it will load my asus screen, then the windows logo screen comes up, and it says &quot;please wait&quot; as it is loading, then the screen goes black and stays that way.
on this black screen, my cursor is still visible and i can move it around, but the screen is completely black.
i have tried many troubleshooting solutions, including: - system restore - trying a boot repair off of the vista disc - unplugging/replugging usb components any ideas?
