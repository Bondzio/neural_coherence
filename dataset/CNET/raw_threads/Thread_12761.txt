Hi, is anyone using Credant/Mcafee/Winmagic/CoSosys for Mac in order to encrypt USB devices? I'm trying to find the best solution for encrypting devices and have many questions about the whole thing... thanks!

I also use it at home (Mac only) and cannot say how simple it is. haven't even considered trying another USB encryption tool.

Since I've lost a usb stick with some personal stuff, I decided not to use this type of tiny device without encryption ever again. EasyLock is the easiest tool I found. I'm telling you...you just have to drag and drop the files in the encrypted side, and it's all done.

And I keep some files also unencrypted on the device.
