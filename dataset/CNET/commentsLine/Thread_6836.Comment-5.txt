i had this problem all the time and it would drive me nuts!!!
i would always uninstall the drivers, most of the time, and then restart to let windows reinstall them by itself.
if the issue still persists, try the drivers that were packaged with the motherboard, or download the latest driver version.
if nothing above fixes your issue, it could be several of the following: there is a driver signing issue, conflicting with windows.
(do a fresh install) defect motherboard (have you touched anything inside of your pc lately?)
the router settings (enter the main domain of your ip address in a web browser url, and then look for a function that will reset everything to default)
