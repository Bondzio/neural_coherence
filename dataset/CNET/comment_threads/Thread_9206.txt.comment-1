I am planning on buying a new Dell Optiplex 980 computer (finally).
The computer choice is fairly easy till I get to the GPU.
Planning on getting something like Corel Draw, but I haven't used any more hardcore programs of this type yet, so I have no idea what to look for.
One configuration is an i5 760 with a 1GB NVIDIA GT330.
There are other more GPUs offered, but to get a better choice of more &quot;pro&quot; oriented cards, I have to look more at a Precision line for more money.
Does the combo I'm looking decent for running something like CD?
The main thing is I don't want to spend all the money on a box where the MoBo won't accept a useable card.
Thanks!
