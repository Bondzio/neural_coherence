The lamp was becoming dim and eventually died. We've tried replacing the lamp but no go. We tried another lamp from (what we thought) was a known good spare projector but still no go. What I am finding is that, when using an ohmmeter, I show no conductivity between any of the three connections even though the lamp is brand new out of the box. Because we've tried two lamps, I'm not convinced it's a bulb issue but I don't know how these things work. I am wondering if the ohmmeter check is not valid with these as perhaps they have some other way excite the gas in the bulb and do no use a filament. Anyone know this? TIA

This comes via a flashing LED lamp sequence. I see nothing that senses proper seating of these components but the lack of filament continuity is puzzling.

When I manually activate the switch, the project lamp comes on. It appears that some small piece of the molded plastic cover is broken off. I'll need to fashion something and attach it with PVC cement. That might work. Looks like we'll make a teacher happy and maybe this finding will help someone else.
