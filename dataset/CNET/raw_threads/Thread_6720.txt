It is appearing in the device manager. Explorer is running very slow. The same thing is happening with the drive in every other cable and in other computers as well. Please give an insight if you can as to what may have happened and what can be done. Thank you.

That is there is no file system on the drive. Since discussions and more about Windows Disk Management is widely discussed on how to partition and format the drive, I'll stop here. Bob

What have you tried ? Have you tested the drive on another USB port, tried another USB cable, tested with another PC, tried the bare drive as an internal drive in another PC ? What does it show under disk management ? VAPCMD

Thanks for taking out the time to answer.

Drives fail in many ways so this does not sound different to me. The only new thing is I'm encountering folk that are new to PCs or computers and don't believe they need to backup. That is, they actually think that all the problems with PCs have been solved. Bob

But it could be a hardware issue. Then the possible solutions are: 1. Get the disk out and put it in another enclosure. 2. Buy a new one. Kees

The newer owners are being told less and less about this area and urban lore is running wild about how SSD is safer than HDD because you won't lose your files. (that's a dang lie.) Backup will solve this one. Replace the defective parts, restore to the fixed drive and you're all good. Bob

5619	11	597551	5485820	5485686	Kees_B	8/9/13 10:52 AM	1.37604552E12	Re: data	'Damage' isn't the right word. It's simply deleted. But since it isn't accessible at the moment anyway, that's no great loss. As you might know (and if you didn't you know now), it's definitely not recommended to use an external disk as STORAGE. They are too unreliable to trust your only copy of data to. They are perfect for moving large amounts of data between computers that aren't in a local network, and the are perfect also as one of your backup media, and that's it. So if they fail and can't be repaired by putting them in another enclosure, you buy a new one and backup your data again. Kees
