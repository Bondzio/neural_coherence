computer specs: sony vaio windows xp pro p4 at 1.5ghz 128mb rdram 60g hd i am having trouble with the computer.. first off for some reason, one day the mouse or keyboard stop working...so i tried a different mouse and keyboard with no luck....there are 2 usb ports in the front and one in the back... it was plugged into the usb ports....i also tried the other old port also, i think its called the serial/com port?
but still no luck.... then i tried resetting the bios by taking out the battery on the motherboard....but once i turn the computer back on....the main bios screen came on, but since i cant use the keyboard to escape out of the bois...i cant get into windows....now i am stuck in the bois screen...i also tried buying a pci 2.0 usb card....but i cant install it since i cant get in windows to install the driver.... any help please!????
?
