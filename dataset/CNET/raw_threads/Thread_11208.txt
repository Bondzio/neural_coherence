It is $80 more than the sale they had a few weeks ago, due to the upgrade to the flat panel monitor. Is this a decent monitor for working with dvd's? Its max. resolution is 1024 x 768.

The 15-inch flat panel provides a crisp, bright image and costs only $199 (after a $50 mail-in rebate). Busy multitaskers might find the screen too small for daily use, but it's a great buy for a budget machine you spend time with only occasionally.&quot; From the T6212 review Personally, I have eMachines old monitor the E15T3 which is the same size as the new one. I have sampled wide-screen and full-screen DVDs. The overall picture is pretty good but the screen is alittle small for watching movies in my opinion. If you plan on watching DVDs alot I would get a larger monitor, but it would work.

High end gamers prefer the old CRT flat screen monitors over LCD as they claim faster response. Recently I have read that LCD monitors have improved and the ones with 8mn response time is not that bad. The 15&quot; emachine e15T4 has 16ms response time with 1024x768 max resolution. Newegg has an Acer 17&quot; ALI714CB-8 with 8ms and 1280x1024 max resolution for $229. The Samsung 19&quot; 915N with 8ms and 1280x1024 resolution for $400 is also nice.
