This is a real pain.
I've checked several of the links, & had Googled around & most said the same thing: Right-click on the folder/file, security tab, owner tab, add the name, etc, etc.
Did it all.
Still won't open the files.
I managed to open *one* photo.
But I Know I don't want to have to do one at a time.
Why did this happen in the 1st place & why is it so difficult to just enable what I need?
?
