Thanks.
I did mean how do PCMCIA cards and USB adpators compare.
My fault for not being more clear.
I already have a Motorola Wireless router in the house (model WR850G).
That's about all I know about the router, and I had planned to just buy a 54Mb PCMCIA card at Walmart for about $35.00.
I wonder if I would be better off with the 108Mb card, or if with my router, I should just stick with the 54Mb card.
I don't want to spend a lot of money, especially since I'm putting this in a computer owned by my employer.
Thanks again.
