hey all, everytime i turn on my second computer on my home network, my host automatically dials into the internet.
i have had the same problem in the past but can't figure out how to correct it.
thanks for the help.
my host is windows xp and the second computer that is pulling my host online is running windows 98 se.
thanks for the help.
