So, are netbooks and their cheapness and tiny size stealing the potential tablet audience?
I have a netbook but the keyboard is SO small that I keep making typing mistakes all the time.
I love the fact that you can get apps for tablets and their large screen which is also a keyboard.
~sigh~ I guess in a years time, if there's no competition, I'll break down and buy an iPad.
