<s> I have not been a a big fan of the past AMD processors. </s>
<s> I have had Pentiums. </s>
<s> Looking to get a new set up and looking at the large price difference. </s>
<s> Reading reports and such make me re think the Athlon. </s>
<s> Which is better for gaming, videos, MP3's and such. </s>
<s> AMD Athlon 64 or Intel Pentium D Processor. </s>
<s> I would like to get the most bang for the buck. </s>
<s> The problems I have seen in the past is incompatability with software and the AMD. </s>
<s> The hot one now is the AMD 64 dual core and 2 PCI express video cards (Nvidia GeForce) in SLI mode. </s>
<s> But that's top end. </s>
<s> I have a single core AMD Athlon 64 and it runs quieter and uses less power than Intel. </s>
<s> A great little chip. </s>

<s> Thanks for the information. </s>
<s> Have you had any incompatability issues with software ? </s>

<s> ...&quot;AMD Athlon 64 X2&quot; processors. </s>
<s> (X2 = dual core) </s>
<s> I am looking at the new Pentium 975X chipset and the speed it has w HT (dual core w HT) and wondering if you went for Intel or AMD and what your experiences have been with your decision. </s>
<s> I am about to make this decission between AMD and Intel and would appreciate any input. </s>
<s> With the new dual core 975X it is tempting to go with Pentium but the benchmarking is really confusing and this is a new addition from Intel - hasn't been around enough for me to find much from anyone who has seen it in action. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> (Looking to add a new Windows PC that can use Vista later - do picture and film work but not full length and don't do gaming). </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> After checking out everything here at cnet and at a site tomeshardware.com I figured out that the AMD x2 either the 4200 or the 3800 will more than do what I want it to do. </s>
<s> Now I have to decide between the Hp or Gateway variations. </s>
<s> Not this computer but the next I will probably build it. </s>
<s> All tests I saw had the AMD x2's dominating the Intel D's. </s>
<s> srieth </s>
<s> Even Intel has thrown that out because AMD CPU's outperform them while running at much lower speeds. </s>
<s> Almost all new Intels at this time are desperate moves on their part as gap fillers until they can get their new lower power [heat] lower clock speed CPU's out, and end up with improved performance from new architecture. </s>
<s> Not looking at only speed issues - even though it is a factor. </s>
<s> Looking at over all value. </s>
<s> Take a intal and AMD of the same cofiguration and I have found that the Intel is the most expensive by 200 - 300 dollars. </s>
<s> Also checking out Cnets tests and a few other sites tests it is a decisive AMD love fest. </s>
<s> I will admit that I have not liked Atholons up until this point but this should change that additude. </s>

<s> Intel's advertised speed is always higher than AMD, because it uses a technique called Quad Data Rate, which transfers 4 data per clock cycle. </s>
<s> Let's say the Intel cpu is said to be 3.2GHz, it's real clock is actually only 800MHz, because 3200/4=800. </s>
<s> AMD uses a technique called Double Data Rate, it transfers 2 data per clock. </s>
<s> Therefore, lets say u have an AMD with 2.2GHz, the true clock is 2200/2, which equals to 1.1GHz. </s>
<s> Thus AMD is actually faster than Intel. </s>
<s> It may not make sense to you now, but if you look at the link on the bottom, and do some other research, you will see what I am talking about. </s>
<s> You may not understand what I am saying now, because I am bad at explaining things, but you will after some googling. </s>
<s> http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/133 Cheers </s>
<s> Because usually in the benchmarks you see now, the Intel test systems are not optimized, while AMD is, because the AMD one usaully has Dual channel DDR400. </s>
<s> In order for a system to be optimized, the CPU's FSB must match half the DDR frequency. </s>
<s> AMD with 400MHz FSB + dual channel DDR400 = optimized Intel with 800MHz FSB + dual channel DDR800 = optimized http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/133 </s>
