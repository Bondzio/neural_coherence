<s> yes its the one i have right now... x64 Minidriver installation instructions - Basic Printing Support... but is only the basic printing... so i cant use all the features of the printer... thanks anyway... ill keep looking... </s>
<s> Look at http://www.virtualbox.org/ Put a 32 bit XP in that and you can get all the old features back in the virtual OS. </s>
<s> Sorry but I know the driver issue very well. </s>
