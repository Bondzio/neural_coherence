The DSL modem they gave me is a knock-off kind of third party modem, a ComTrend ADSL2+ Ethernet Router, or so it says. However, I happen to have obtained a nice 2Wire DSL modem that has all kinds of wireless networking capabilities built right into it. Now since my service seems to lock out every single type of modem but its own specific one, is there any way to route my crappy modem into the nice 2Wire one and have all of the nice networking capabilities it has built into it? Any ideas?
