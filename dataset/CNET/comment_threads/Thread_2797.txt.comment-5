Yeah I know.I have 2 other machines that I output to TV with using the svideo out.
I really like it for watching movies when travelling.
This is why I was hoping I could get the cable to work with the laptop with only VGA out.....
Anyway I was trying to avoid spending alot of money on one of those big vga converter boxes.....
