<s> I plan to buy a new notebook within a couple of months, either a PC or a MacBook Pro (that's another story---I've used PC's for almost 20 years but am looking into the Macs). </s>
<s> My question concerns processors. </s>
<s> I've &quot;built&quot; two identical HP 6000's at www.shopping.hp.com: Vista Home Premium 15.4&quot; WXGA BrightView Widescreen (1280x800) 256MB NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) Go 7400 HP Imprint Finish + Microphone + Webcam 2048MB DDR2 System Memory (2 Dimm) 160GB 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive LightScribe Super Multi 8X DVD+/-RW w/Double Layer Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network w/Bluetooth 6 Cell Lithium Ion Battery. </s>
<s> The only difference is the processors: 1. </s>
<s> AMD Turion 64 X2 Dual-Core TL-60(2.0GHz/1MB) OR 2. </s>
<s> Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 (2.0GHz/4MB L2 Cache). </s>
<s> What kind of difference would I notice between the two processors? </s>
<s> The AMD computer would be $90 cheaper, but the processor has only 1MB of cache while the Intel has 4MB. </s>
<s> How much does that affect speed? </s>
<s> Or, could I save even more by stepping down to a slower processor? </s>
<s> For instance, the AMD Dual-Core TL-56(1.8GHz/1MB) would be $75 less than the AMD Dual-Core TL-60 (2.0GHz/1MB). </s>
<s> The Intel Core 2 Duo T5600(1.83GHz/2MB L2 Cache) would be $100 less than the Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 (2.0GHz/4MB L2 Cache). </s>
<s> I thought I had read somewhere that the AMD Turion Dual Core chips had fallen behind the Intel Core 2 Duo chips. </s>
<s> Because I tend to keep my notebooks for several years (my present HP is four years old), I want the get the fastest processor practicable. </s>
<s> BTW, I asked this in the laptops forum and have not had a reply as of now. </s>
<s> I really appreciate any input. </s>
<s> Thanks, Bill </s>
<s> Short answer. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, Can you give a wee bit longer answer, as in &quot;Why?&quot; Is the Intel faster, cooler, just like the name, etc.? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/01/11/core-2-duo-overtakes-core-2-extreme/ writes &quot;The Core 2 Duo outperforms AMD's Athlon 64 X2 clock for clock in most benchmarks, and it even consumes less energy than AMD's offerings.&quot; So that in a nutshell is why I'd get that. </s>
<s> Besides the stability and standard bearer Intel is. </s>
<s> My next machine is a Core 2 Duo machine so power is a concern. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> will be AMD. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Get what you are comfortable with. </s>
<s> The line between the momentary victory for either one will change hands shortly. </s>
<s> That is what the game is all about. </s>
<s> Either one will serve you well. </s>
<s> Some softwares will not support the new core configurations yet, so check that out also. </s>
<s> I read recently in PC Magazine that AMD is challenging the power consumption measurement techniques that show AMD to have higher usage. </s>
<s> Let's say the power comsumption isn't an issue. </s>
<s> Let's say that &quot;clock for clock&quot;Intel beats the AMD. </s>
<s> But what about &quot;dollar per dollar&quot;? </s>
<s> If the AMD machine is around $100 less you can get a faster AMD processor which is what should be used in any comparison. </s>
<s> Pick a formula and weigh it that way. </s>
<s> In fact, why not tell us what you found? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I did a quick look at HP and a 1.8 Intel was about $20 more than a 2GHz AMD all else being equal. </s>
<s> I'll take time later to paste the configuration </s>
<s> It would be a shame to see time on battery power to take a hit for 20 bucks. </s>
<s> Also you can check with Tomshardware.com's mother of all CPU charts to see if you lowered the Core 2 Duo clock rate enough to match the 2 CPUs. </s>

<s> So clock for clock, Intel $ for $, take your pick. </s>
<s> The summary benchmark of the Australian PC site was 95.5 for Intel 1.8 and 96 for AMD 2.0 I will have to do a lot more study to be sure which I want, but I have until July or August to decide when my son goes to college. </s>
<s> I don't think you can go wrong with either one and it will come down to price eventually for me </s>
<s> I have read that the AMD x2 dual cores produce significantly more heat than the comparable Intels. </s>
<s> Has your research found anything which confirms or contradicts that? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Bill, You are making this harder on yourself than necessary. </s>
<s> If one CPU brand is a lemon versus the other, the market would have killed it by now. </s>
<s> Since they are both still around, figure that people are buying one or the other. </s>
<s> Besides, the CPU isn't the only factor in performance or fan speed or usability. </s>
<s> Aside from gaming, all new notebooks today are sufficient to satisfy users' immediate and foreseeable forthcoming needs. </s>
<s> You won't be able to buy a machine today that can outperform even the low end of a series 4 years from now. </s>
<s> Instead of shopping by specs, go to a store and &quot;play&quot; with the laptops. </s>
<s> Any Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA or Dell Direct Outlet will let you to that. </s>
<s> If one manufacturer has both the Intel and AMD in similar size screen, that is an even better comparison. </s>
<s> After playing, pick the one you like best. </s>
<s> You won't have buyer's remorse. </s>
<s> Guaranteed! </s>
<s> Certain processors are slightly better at certain tasks such as video editing, gaming or productivity. </s>
<s> Bob, I believe that you stated a comparison between the Athalon 64 x2 and the Core 2 Duo. </s>
<s> When in fact AMD is now offering the Turion 64 X2 which runs faster, cooler and is more energy efficient. </s>
