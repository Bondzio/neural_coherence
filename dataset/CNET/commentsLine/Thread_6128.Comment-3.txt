your reply is muchly appreciated.
on the canadian dell website, the 5150 is still available, so i had no idea it was discontinued.
i checked the american site and sure enough, it's not there.
i'm really glad you pointed this out to me.
so, with the all-in-wonder, i'll be able to record one show and watch another?
that would be great, but like you said, i'd have to upgrade the power suply.
only problem, i hear that's hard to do if you don't use hp products (the style and size of the casing).
