<s> Hi, I am trying to move Gigs of information from an old PC to a new one. </s>
<s> Both are equipped with NIC cards, so I installed my Zyxel Prestige 623 ADSL modem/router on both and connected them both to the router. </s>
<s> My problem is that while I can ping the router from each machine neither machine can ping the other. </s>
<s> Any idea what could be wrong? </s>
<s> Note that the Zyxel ADSL modem/router is no longer connected to an ADSL line, could this be the problem ? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> as i can see you have 2 pc's connected to a router. </s>
<s> assigning IP from DHCP on router. </s>
<s> Try disabling your firewalls (inc. MS firewall if applicable) Hope it helps, Stephen M </s>
