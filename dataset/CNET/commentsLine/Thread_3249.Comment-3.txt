hello, the monitor is a crt one and i have tried several refresh rates with it.
it is now 80hz.
it always settles down after i make a change but then starts acting up again.
there are no other electrical devices near it.
i have a surge protector, but there are only computer related devices plugged into it.
the only thing i haven't tried is moving my monitor to my other computer..i will do that in the near future.
thanks for the help.
