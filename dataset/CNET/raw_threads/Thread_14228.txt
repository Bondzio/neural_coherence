I have searched several discussions on here and saw many issues and problems but can anyone direct me to a good and simple &quot;how to&quot; source for changing out hard drives? I have a HP system running XP and want to totally remove and discard the present HD. I do have the complete 6 or 7 recovery disk. I just need particulars. I know this has been covered but have yet to single out and find the simple link/discussion. Thanks.
