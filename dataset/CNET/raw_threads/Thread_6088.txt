So I thought about buying the new Intel E4700 with 2GB Ram and a HD3850 /256MB. I just don't know if the E4700 is really fast enough to run Vista in an acceptable speed... Please tell me your opinion.

All CPUs in the same family have the same cpuflags and will mxecute the same instruction set(s). Internal speed is more important and if SMP isn't readily supported, you won't b e getting the performance you want. Also, remember that 64bit systems cannot run certain applications nwithout a compatibility layer. (This is an added comment to the above post.)
