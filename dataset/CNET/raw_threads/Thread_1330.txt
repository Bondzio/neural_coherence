I accidently deleted something and didn't realize my mistake until after I had emptied my recycle bin. I know that windows doesn't actually erase the data until something else needs the space (or something like that), so I stll have hope.

Their website is http://www.executivesoftware.com . You are correct in assuming that windows does not delete a file when you have deleted it from your system. The first character of the filename is changed to a ? and windows no longer recognizes that the program exists. If you have NOT written or deleted anything to your hard drive, you may be able to recover it using a program called Win Hex and change the ? back to the original first character.
