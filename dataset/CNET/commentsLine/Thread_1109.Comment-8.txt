you can order online, but i prefer locally as i get it now and install it and quality is pretty good.
depending on your locale, besy buy, fry's, and/or circuit city should carry fans and gosh, radioshaft .
buy a &quot;ball bearing or magnetic type&quot; fan, avoid any &quot;sleeve bearing&quot;, brand is up to you.
google for online source, i beleive frozencpu and newegg are decent vendors.
happy usa -----willy
