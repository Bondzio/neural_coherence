1.1.1	i have an emachine T6522 and i was wondering what if anyone knows what psu will fit and has enough power to run a good graphics card.	St
1.1.2	thanks, clay	St
1.2.1	Some OEM vendors tend to differ slightly only to make it hard for end-users to correct later issues.	St
1.2.2	This website provides some help on a source, but google for more: http://www.power-on.com/atx12vem300bt.html Further, the absolute best psu source are those from: http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and find the replacement for your model.	St
1.2.3	The same advice goes for any replacement from any vendor, it MUST be compatible as a direct &quot;fit&quot; as well as power needs.	St
1.2.4	tada -----Willy	St
