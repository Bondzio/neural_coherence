i have two (2) sticks of 512 mb ddr ram.. one is pc3200 apacer the other is pc2700 crucial.
when i put the two together, it said running at ddr 333 in dual channel mode as i booted up.
the problem i have is when playing vice city, if i play for about 5 - 10 mins (it varys), then it will pop up with an error and say unhandled exception.
also other things started to crash like msn messenger, and i wasnt even using it.
i removed the pc7200 ram and i played vice city for 3 hours lol and it didn't have the error any more.
i just want to know why this is happening and if i get another stick of apacer 512 pc3200 if the problem will go away or not :-| i have an amd athlon xp 2500 + and i know thats not where the instatability is at because its not overclocked and not overheating.
i have an nf7-s abit motherboard.
thanks for any replys
