when i hit my e-machine desktop's power button, things start to happen for about five seconds, then everything stops.
punching f8 does nothing.
holding the esc key down causes the power and copyright screen (e-machines) to remain on, but boot-up does not commence.
am i probably looking at an os or bios problem (winxp home), or is it more likely in the power supply itself?
what should i do?
