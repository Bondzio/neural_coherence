Since you posted in the hardware forum do you think this is a hardware issue?
As to Norton and can't find the download, that's a typical problem not to be ashamed of.
Today's browsers now toss files into some download area and we have to go looking there.
If this is not a hardware issue the Cnet Computer Help forum has fielded the old can't find a file I downloaded question quite a few times.
Most of the replies are to watch more carefully what we are doing.
