If you try to open it in Windows, a message says: &quot;Please insert a disk in Drive (drive letter)&quot; in Ubuntu linux, the message is: &quot;Unable to mount location&quot; &quot;No media in the drive&quot; If I try to format it in Windows, a message says: &quot;There is no disk in Drive (drive letter)&quot; &quot;Insert a disk, then try again&quot; Any ideas about what the problem is? TIA USB thumb drive doesn't respond
