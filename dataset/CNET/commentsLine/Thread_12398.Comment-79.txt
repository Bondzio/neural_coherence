i just printed out a word doc with hot pink text and a hot pink small square box on champagne metallic cardstock.
for printer settings, i chose &quot;cardstock&quot; and left everything else as is.
i cut through the square and didn't see the type of balling you mention.
however, i haven't tried other colors.
i just got this printer and everything i've printed so far was either hot pink, brown, or black text (wedding invitations).
hardly any graphics.
i'll test more next week and post.
thanks, y
