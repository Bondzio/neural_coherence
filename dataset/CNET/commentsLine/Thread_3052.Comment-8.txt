if i am using the maker's restore cds some may require that special restore partition.
so i leave that alone.
however if i'm going all guru and doing a clean install of xp (see google.com) then i'm using that microsoft xp sp2 cd and supplying any and all drivers so i can thoroughly wipe out all partitions with dban or other tools.
