<s> Yes you can dual boot XP with Windows 7, but whether this computer is compatible with Win 7 I can't say. </s>
<s> If it is, you get to find and install hardware drivers for it. </s>
<s> Win 7 may have some and if you are fortunate may have them all, but when installed you should head over to the Device Manager and check. </s>

<s> Thanx Mark yes it is compatible i have done a check,just dont want to get rid of xp really so was going to fit another hard disk and load win 7 on that Cheers Stu </s>
<s> to think about. </s>
<s> When you install the new drive and start the Win 7 installation, that setup process will replace XP's boot.ini with it's own BCD file, (Boot Configuration Data). </s>
<s> It is this which allows the dual boot. </s>
<s> If you then remove the XP drive or wipe the data from it, Windows 7 will no longer boot, because it's boot file has been removed. </s>
<s> Worth remembering. </s>
