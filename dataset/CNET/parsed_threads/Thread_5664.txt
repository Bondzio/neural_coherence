<s> Dell Dimension 4100 running XP SP2 This is really odd... sometime in the last week, the two DVD burners on my system have downgraded themselves to CD. </s>
<s> When I look at my system on Windows Explorer it shows my two drives as DVD-RW drives. </s>
<s> But if I put a DVD in either one, I get the message &quot;No disk in Drive&quot; and now Explorer says the drive is a CD-RW. </s>
<s> If I put a CD in, everything looks fine, and indeed I have burned a couple of CD-RWs with no problem. </s>
<s> Control Panel - System says my two drives are working properly. </s>
<s> I haven't installed any software or hardware lately, but just in case, I restored my XP to two weeks ago ... still no help. </s>
<s> Is it possible I have a problem with my IDE channel? </s>
<s> Any Ideas or suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Perry B </s>
<s> XP knows nothing about DVD recording and this issue is widely reported. </s>
<s> The good thing is that CD/DVD recording works fine even if the drive type is not right according to Windows. </s>
<s> There is however another failure here. </s>
<s> Try the usual hardware removal in the device manager and remove the upper and lowerfilters (see google.) </s>

<s> I want to be clear about your advice, since I haven't played with this kind of problem before. </s>
<s> (I should mention that my burner definitely will not burn a DVD. </s>
<s> The burn software detects that there is no DVD blank present, and terminates. </s>
<s> It burns CDs just fine) By 'the usual hardware removal', do you mean remove the device in device manager, or physically remove the device, or both? </s>
<s> Then I think I can navigate the upper/lower filters thing. </s>
<s> Although, should I try that first, and see if the problem clears? </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help Perry B </s>

<s> Example about those registry entries -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/270008 In closing, I can't count how many will reply the error message doesn't show on their machine and fail to remove the noted registry entries. </s>
<s> I won't explain further that I use the articles for how/what to remove. </s>

<s> I will proceed as you advise. </s>

<s> The advice above is what should be a first response given the symptoms. </s>
<s> There are other symptoms which change the answer but this one is fairly safe (as safe as can be!) </s>
<s> so we always give it a shot with these symptoms. </s>

<s> Any guidance would be appreciated. </s>

<s> Find a friend that knows about this to help you. </s>
<s> The instructions are there but not everyone should be doing this so it's ok to get help locally at times. </s>

<s> when I rum regeidt and look at the key in the MS article you posted I don't see anything called upper or lower filters. </s>
<s> This paper has the procedure for changing the registry. </s>
