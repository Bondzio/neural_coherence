<s> I'm sure this is one of the most simple things in the world but after hours of trying I still cannot print an enlarged (600% - or any percent!) </s>
<s> copy from my scanjet 4370. </s>
<s> I've tried via the Image zone as well as the so-called Solution center but without success. </s>
<s> Does anybody have a real solution??! </s>
<s> Any help gratefully received! </s>

<s> I am using the HP 4890 scanner and when I want to enlarge a picture that I scan, I scan it and save it to a file in my pictures and then open it up in MIcrosoft Digital Image 2006.I then change the picture size there and then print the picture. </s>
<s> I think you can do the same with most photo editing programs. </s>
<s> The only problem is if you take a small picture and try to blow it up too big the quality of the print goes down. </s>
<s> Yes! </s>
<s> That worked. </s>
<s> Thanks for finding a solution for me (can't imagine how they managed to make HP Image Zone so user unfriendly. </s>
<s> Anyway am very pleased that at last I can perform such an apparently simple (but in practice difficult) task. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Yes, HP image zone has a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> I guess they think it's free so why give you something that works. </s>
<s> I am glad that helped. </s>
