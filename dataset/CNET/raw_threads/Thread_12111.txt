I also want to burn most of my albums to cd after first converting them to mpegs. One of my concerns is security on a wireless network, but more than that, I have a neighbor that has put a radio antenna up on his roof and its not so bad anymore, but when he gets on his cb and cranks up his amplifier, I get him coning over my computer speakers and Ive even heard him over my tv set which is satellite. I know that amplifing is illegal, but trying to get any action out of the fcc is next to impossible. Thats why I am thinking of going a physical ethernet network. Any comments would be appreacated. Thanks
