It's sole function will be for digital illustration: 2-D rendering, so I know I don't need all the crazy performance for animation and such... but I also understand certain components are better for graphics programs and the like, but I don't understand enough to make an intelligent purchase. All I need is a bare bones set-up: case motherboard CPU video card Memory Power supply I've already got drives, and monitor, etc This isn't supposed to be a dream machine, all I care about is comfortable performance: I want be able to work big, and in multiple layers without freezing-up, that's it.
