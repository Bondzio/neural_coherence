i am good on a computer, but have absolutely no knowledge of the technical side.
when my old windows xp finally gave up the ghost, my grandson took the hard drive out, reformatted it and put it in a case.
that is my external hard drive.
i put my massive amounts of photography on disks and then on the external hard drive.
i keep in a cool place and never touch it except to download or retrieve photos.
i have had it for several years now and when this computer gives up the ghost, i will do the same with it.
works for me.
