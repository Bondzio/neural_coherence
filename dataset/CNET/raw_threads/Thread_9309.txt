If, for example, I'd want to go to the beginning of this post, I'd have to use cursor keys or the mouse, too bad. I can't figure out why is this happening. I have WinXP with Service Pack 2. Any idea?

Do you mean RePag/AvPag? If so, they work OK. I could BUY a different keyboard, but I don't think that's the problem. All other keys work perfectly, and these two ones have ceased to work at the same time. Curious...

One set on the number pad and the other between it and the keyboard off. Do both sets fail to work? Go to housecall.antivirus.com and run a virus check to see if you have a worm.

I always used the set between the numpad and the rest of the keyboard. Those are the ones that don't work. The ones in the numpad (7 and 1) work OK. I'll run that virus check right now (anyway I have Kaspersky running as resident).
