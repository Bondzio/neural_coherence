<s> Dear Mr Proffitt, The review did not give a very favourable view of the benefits of the 2.5 band but only the 5. band . </s>

<s> many thanks . </s>

<s> It came off as a passable router. </s>
<s> If the price was right I would consider it. </s>
<s> But here I use simpler routers at about the 50 USD range and &quot;it's all good&quot;. </s>
<s> This means I won't pop for this really nice looking unit. </s>
<s> Besides mine is out of sight, out of mind. </s>
<s> Boring. </s>
