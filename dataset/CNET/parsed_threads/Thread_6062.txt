<s> I work for a company as a Media Handler. </s>
<s> Another big company contracts to our company to pull tapes from the libraries and send them offsite. </s>
<s> We had 3 accounts that went somewhere else for their media storage needs a few years back. </s>
<s> They left behind over 3 thousand+ tapes that we sold to a buyer or reseller. </s>
<s> The tapes had old data on them. </s>
<s> This information was important enough to back up and maybe had SS numbers included. </s>
<s> Was this a bad thing and did our company break any laws? </s>
<s> You could have bulk erased such prior to sale to avoid being taken to task for not even trying. </s>
<s> If you can't even contact a lawyer to help you in this matter, your services are very lacking. </s>
<s> Afterall, you are talking about the future of your/the company and to think you believe SSN# maybe present just doesn't bode well for you. </s>
<s> All data whether old or new becomes a matter for destruction because it data. </s>
<s> Sound funny but value is always attached to data and protection key to safeguard it. </s>
<s> If safeguard is nothing more than storage, then somewhere in your lease/contract should be the handling of it when the client is no longer able to pay, doesn't release you from it &quot;safe keeping&quot;. </s>
<s> In most cases, destruction is likely. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter if you';re a 3rd party or 4th, etc., somewhere the data has to be deleted at least in a proper world, IMHO. </s>
<s> tada -----WIlly </s>
