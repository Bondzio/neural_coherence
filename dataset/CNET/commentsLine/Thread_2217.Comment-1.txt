hi, need some help here.
i can't seem to turn on the computer sometimes, although i keep pressing the power on button.
sometimes, it works, and the computer works fine.
what do you guys think is the problem?
im a newbie at this, so i 'd like to know what is the likely cause before i take the thing to pieces.
thanks for replying!!
