<s> I am thinking of going wireless, and am just beginning to explore the topic. </s>
<s> One thing I like to do in the evening is get a radio program on the internet and listen to it in another room. </s>
<s> Right now we have wires running from the computer room clear thru to the other side of the house where speakers are. </s>
<s> Needless to say, we are always tripping over the wires. </s>
<s> Is there a way to do this wirelessly, and if so, how? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help you may offer. </s>
<s> It will cost you anywhere from 100 to 200 bucks though. </s>
<s> I got myself this linksys wireless music system. </s>
<s> There are a couple just like that from diff manufacturers. </s>
<s> It ok, although the support is crappy. </s>
<s> I did have it up and running with almost no problems. </s>
<s> Read reviews on amazon, it helped me avoid problems. </s>
<s> Could not get the internet radio to work as their firmware is not updated. </s>
<s> You can listen through your normal stereo or though the provides speakers. </s>
<s> Good luck http://www.linksys.com/products/group.asp?grid=33&scid=38 </s>
<s> Thanks, sergv, I'll look into that. </s>
