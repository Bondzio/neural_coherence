I have a dell dimension 2400.
XP home edition.
I don't have anything altered to the default factory settings.
The situation I described is all I know, I have never been able to pin point the audio problem to a specific occurrence.
I never have noticed after i do something it happens, it just seems to occur every so often.
Would it be a driver for the OS for audio?
or a driver for winamp/media player?
