Hello, I was having problems with my computer restarting/BSOD when using flashplayer and it kept telling me I needed more RAM. My motherboard is an old iWill XP333 with Athlon XP1900 chip and has 1-512mb and 1-256mb RAM, both PC2700. I went on to Crucial and PNY and they both told me that I could use 1GB PC3200 which I bought and installed beside the PC2700 RAM. My problem is that the BIOS recognizes all of the RAM without errors but it will only let me set the CPU multiplier at 100mhz(DDR200) which makes the CPU run @ 1.2gHz. When I set it at 133mHz (DDR266), I get either a BSOD or Black error screen. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you. ps:No need to laugh, I know this computer is OLD!

I defer to others to explain this but the common test is to put in only the new stick and see if A) it works and B) you can change the setting. No maker I know of tells all. Bob

Its NOT the speed but the CAS/RAS values per slot. On top of that you have various ram amounts which provides another telltale sign the ram won't get along, even if same speed. Which is way, all too often the advice is to &quot;matched ram/pairs&quot; to run at its best. If you got 1Gb stick of ram, get another. Use only those 2x1Gb of ram and dump the others to have a better running PC. Even though you have PC3200, your PC probably only accepts it at PC2700. SOMETIMES, you may luck out and check to see if a bios updates helps. The latest release may resolve some ram timing issues, however this is a serious fix. So, do it if you want but if it fails you've a new doorstop of a PC, so beware. At least check to see what current bios level you're at and what is now available. tada -----Willy
