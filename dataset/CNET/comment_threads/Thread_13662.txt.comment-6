I have the driver in a folder.
Wen I use have disk it shows an inf file but doesn't show any modems.
I think the problem may lay with having no com port.
When I add a port com3 comes up, which means maybe it wasn't there.
Unfortunately, I get a yellow exclamation even after I remove all conflicts.
Any help is appreciated.
