I'm considering buying a new hard drive and i have options of a hd with a 8 mb buffer and 16 mb buffer. The price difference isn't that large BUT if the 16 doesn't perform that much better than the 8, I'm gonna get the 8. Can someone give me a quick and dirty regarding the differences in performance between these two options? If the performance difference is depenedent on components in my computer, please let me know what those dependencies are. Thanks

If I look at my system, it's 283 megabytes of disk cache which the difference of that 2, 8 or 16 MB on the disk drive would not make much difference. www.tomshardware.com may have some benchmarks if you want to look further. The RPMs seem to be what you can't skimp on. Bob
