sorry you just stepped over a line where you don't find a solution.
if i can install, i can copy.
thanks for clearing up with an example.
there is no such tool today.
and very little call for it.
yes you can cite microsoft's &quot;activation&quot; but are you ready to write such a thing?
the cost seems more than a copy of adobe.
