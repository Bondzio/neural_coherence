willy, it's not a name brand pc.
it has a foxconn winfast motherboard (nf4sk8aa-8ekrs / socket 939) with an amd athlon 64 processor 3700+ ghz cpu.
i've had a sata hd for some time and it coexisted well with my previous ide dvd writer for years.
then about a month ago, the problems started.
after a lot of attempts to solve things, i gave up, assumed it was a problem with the dvd drive.
i replaced it with the new sata dvd writer.
the ide writer is gone, but the issues continue.
john
