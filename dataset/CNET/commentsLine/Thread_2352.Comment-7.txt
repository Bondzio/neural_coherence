i was on the phone today for over an hour with three different people in india.
i guess this is where hp support is located.
i was told that there are no problems with the f1503.
i then explained that i have read on the cnet website about many people having this problem with the f1503.
i was told that i should not look for information on any website except the hp website.
please include me on any information that you get.
i did have to buy a new monitor just so i can use my computer, but i still want them to fix the problem.
