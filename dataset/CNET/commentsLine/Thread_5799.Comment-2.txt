you left out some big clues.
1. the name of the game.
2. if you checked with the game maker for patches.
3. the overclocked cpu can lead to heat issues and failing motherboard capacitors.
did you look for bulging, leaking motherboard capacitors?
4. games tend to make big demands on the system.
an inventory of the machine is needed, the power supply watts and versions of video driver, motherboard driver, and more.
generic advice.
a. big power supplies.
try 450 watts.
b. lots of cooling.
try it with the case cover off.
c. no parasites.
read  d. blue screen?
after a,b and c are dealt with, check the event viewer for clues.
remember that overheated cpus, undersized power supplies give random failures and i won't help you with events until the machine has proper power and cooling.
