I ended up putting everything I had to have on thumb drives.
Out of curiosity I formatted the WD external hard drive and found the backup software on the HP web site and loaded it to the drive.
I can now run the tests and everything passes?
I put it back on my computer and everything seems to be fine, but for how long?
Beings it's 3 years old I will watch it very close and when it fails again, I will pick up a new on.
Thanks for that information VAPCMD and Willy.
