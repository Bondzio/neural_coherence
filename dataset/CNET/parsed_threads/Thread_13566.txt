<s> Did Soyo ever experience this problem? </s>
<s> I have an sy-7vcae p3 mobo that has about 3 with a gentle rise on the top. </s>
<s> They don't look like Marty Feldman's eyes or anything but they are definitely not flat. </s>
<s> No leaking or anything evident and the system seems to work fine, but what I'd like to know is can I just replace them myself and have everything be hunky dory or is there something else I should know? </s>
<s> Should I wait for the system to fail should they really be bad or try to head off more serious damage and try to replace them now? </s>
<s> The board is far out of warranty. </s>
<s> It affected all sorts of electronics since at the time the company making the parts... had the lowest price. </s>
<s> Let me be blunt. </s>
<s> Good caps never bulge or distort. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Remember that the mobo is a four layer printed circuit board and the caps may be connected to an inner circuit layer. </s>
<s> So make certain that you have the tools and techniques to handle the job without damaging the surrounding artwork. </s>
<s> Also since the Caps were probably bought in a large batch, what's to say that more won't go bad soon. </s>
<s> Note that after a class action suit, ABIT has just agreed to replace the bad caps on any of their mobos regardless of age. </s>
<s> Try complaining to Soyo. </s>

<s> I have replaced hundreds of components, but nothing on MOBOs. </s>
<s> It's a tricky business on multilayer boards any time. </s>
<s> We used to have solder suckers, vacuum operated with tip temperatures adjusted for the job, which you stuck over the component lead, right on the barrel ( the through plate ), using lots of resin flux. </s>
<s> Good techs could get away with copper braid. </s>
<s> But too much heat too long will destroy the bond, particularly if the inner layers are connected to the barrel. </s>
<s> It can be salvaged by using small magnet wire to jump the broken connection, if you know where it's supposed to go. </s>
<s> A map of each layer is a big help. </s>
<s> It's also possible to cut the compnent off - not out!!! </s>
<s> - and do a surface attach to what's left of the leads. </s>
<s> This is an inferior solution mechanically and electrically. </s>
<s> Hi Scott: I've recently experienced the same issue with a Soyo PIII Sy 7IS2 board. </s>
<s> This board was in use for only 2.5 years when the machine started freezing abruptly. </s>
<s> I discovered 3 domed capacitors on the board. </s>
<s> By far the easiest fix is to simply replace the board. </s>
<s> (with another brand) I have also discovered that these older boards are not easy to locate. </s>
<s> Newegg has a Tyan Tomcat i815T (Celeron/PIII)that will work for me. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> Excuse if repeated... Capacitors on thier own, will with time self destruct because they dry out or are exceeding thier capacity. </s>
<s> All componets do degrade over time and since mtrbd. </s>
<s> makers provide a decent product but not necessary a high level one when you look at all the makers out there, cheap comes to mind. </s>
<s> Some hi-end mtrbds, do quite well but others aren't so, thus they in all probability will have some problem. </s>
<s> I exclude the caps of the recent make that are known to be defective about 18mos. </s>
<s> or more ago when that problem surfaced. </s>
<s> I had caps long before that, that blew-up or bludged then leaked. </s>
<s> One or two didn't always cause a breakdown but certainly didn't make things stable. </s>
<s> If you experience such, replace as you're capable of. </s>
<s> The cost is very low for such caps but the actual job may not be. </s>
<s> Since alot of mtrbds. </s>
<s> are multi-layered it could be a hassle to unsolder and/or make 100% contact. </s>
<s> But most replace easily provided you're careful, its certainly worth the try. </s>
<s> But heck, if it ain't broke don't fix it provided it does deliver the goods sorta speak. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
