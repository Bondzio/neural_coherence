<s> I'm planning a trip to Asia in the near future and am looking for a tablet to use only for reading. </s>
<s> I need something that has a back light for low-light reading and I need something that has minimal glare for high-light environments. </s>
<s> I've considered the Kindle Paperwhite, but I have no hands-on experience with it. </s>
<s> I have an iPad that I use for other activities... this new device is only intended for reading. </s>
<s> Aside from the visibility factor, weight is also a concern. </s>
<s> Anyone have recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> And the no backlight is solved the same way as when you want to read a book. </s>
<s> We slip on some light source and today our choices have never been better with clip on LED book lights. </s>

<s> Since I'm traveling to Asia for an extended period, carrying a ton of books isn't an option. </s>
<s> That's why I'm looking for recommendations on a tablet </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Touch-light/dp/B007OZNZG0 I'm unsure why you are asking about the light when it has it. </s>
<s> I'd always added a book light when needed. </s>
<s> And best can only be determined by you. </s>
<s> For me this ain't it. </s>

<s> What is the best I'm open to any suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> But the office is porting apps so at the office we have many. </s>
<s> Including the KF HD, Nexus 7, Asus Transformer and a dozen others. </s>
<s> You seem to have found exactly what you are looking for but your posts seem to ask for a backlight and this has it. </s>
<s> Is this an issue where you didn't know it had it? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No Bob, I'm aware that the Paperwhite has a backlight, I just haven't found any other devices that really provide the same kind of user experience. </s>
<s> I was hoping, prior to purchasing anything, that I might get a bit of insight from users of other devices. </s>
<s> Perhaps there is another device that I'm unfamiliar with, that could satisfy my requirements? </s>
<s> I wish you had lead with &quot;the paperwhite is exactly what I want but who else makes one like it.&quot; I'm going to decline doing that research but look at the Nook non-color unit. </s>
