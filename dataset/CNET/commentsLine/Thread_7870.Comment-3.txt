well, none of the &quot;fixes&quot; had any effect.
i could have sworn connecting to this machine worked at one time.
although none of the other machines have a recently used map to this machine.
i probably just need to reload anyway.
it's been a while.
i just hate getting everything back the way i want it.
it's such a pain.
i've been debating going to xp anyway.
but the thought of &quot;registering&quot; with ms galls me.
