<s> Have a dial up connection on a PII system with WIN 98. </s>
<s> I can go on line and everything operates normally, but after a while I cannot go into new pages...always get an error message. </s>
<s> If I close down the connection and then reload, the system again works normally. </s>
<s> I recently removed a Trojan worm and do not know if this is a residual problem or if my modem is beginning to fail. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> You left out what may be the vital clue. </s>
<s> Always share a &quot;quoted&quot; error message without typographic errors. </s>
<s> Since you had a trojan, it's possible that the OS suffered damaged. </s>
<s> You will have to eject all parasites, run IEFIX and supply that error message. </s>
<s> If you use Kazaa, iMesh or such computer unfriendly programs, don't expect anything to ever fix it. </s>
<s> We call those machines &quot;Kazaa'd.&quot; It's a codeword that means a lot. </s>
<s> Light reading: http://www.doxdesk.com/parasite/ http://www.mvps.org/sramesh2k/IEFIX.htm Optimizing Windows at http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm At the moment, I don't see a hardware issue. </s>
<s> I do see that some behaviour should be changed since it allowed the trojan on the machine. </s>
<s> Find and help that user to not catch such, what can be devastating bugs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ran IEFix with no error message, and I have never downloaded Kazaa or it's ilk. </s>
<s> Actually, I used the wrong term when I said &quot;error message&quot;. </s>
<s> I am actually getting the normal timed out message on all pages I try to enter, but if I restart the modem connection I am able to operate normally. </s>
<s> I also use a fully updated and activated version of NAV 2002 and no one else has access to my machine. </s>
<s> I do not open .exe files from anyone unless I am expecting them. </s>
<s> Can only assume trojan got on machine while surfing news or retailer sites, but don't know why NAV didn't alert me. </s>
<s> All I can offer is that page timeouts are discussed in prior discussions. </s>
<s> Your new post &quot;Actually, I used the wrong term when I said &quot;error message&quot;. </s>
<s> I am actually getting the normal timed out message on all pages I try to enter, but if I restart the modem connection I am able to operate normally.&quot; again didn't supply any error message that points to anything specific. </s>
<s> Since NAV doesn't do parasites, and you didn't write what you do about such, your work and reply is incomplete. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Get your hands on the pgm. </s>
<s> called, &quot;trojan remover&quot; of the same name. </s>
<s> Update it and allow it to work, you have demo use of it for 30-days. </s>
<s> Also, beware that AV pgms. </s>
<s> aren't as adapt to catch all trojans as other malware, but some. </s>
<s> Of course the latest threats can sneak by and do thier dirty work. </s>
<s> If you haven't already try an &quot;online scan&quot; of other popular AV pgms. </s>
<s> like TrendMicro, RAV, McAfee, etc. </s>
<s> the results good or bad can be enlightening. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
