Recently I've got a job... and I believe its time to upgrade my pc now....
Things I wont change(yet) is my Sapphire 7870XT and my ram 8GB 1333.....
I've seen some hardware...but I need your help to choose good stuff... (my budget is max 650 euro) Case : http://www.aerocool.us/pgs/pgs-b/mechatron_b.htm Motherboard: http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87 Pro3/ OR http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87M Pro4/ OR http://www.msi.com/product/mb/Z87-G45-GAMING.html#overview or ASROCK Z87M EXTREME4 (which is better?)
SSD: http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/memory-storage/MZ-7PD128BW (does this support Trim? )
CPU: INTEL CORE I5-4670K 3.40GHZ LGA1150 OR INTEL CORE I7-4770K 3.50GHZ LGA1150 (since I use my pc mostly for games...I believe i5 is enough...) CPU cooler: coolermaster Hyper 212 Evo what do u think?
Pls suggest me more hardware if its better and at same price range...
