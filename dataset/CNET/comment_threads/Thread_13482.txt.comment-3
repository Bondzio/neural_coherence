On top of Steven reply, you need to check these areas of concern.
Applying compound need not be too much.
Also, the cpu surface should be 100% cleaned before application.
Smear the compound out and then re-attach the HSF to it.
As explained by Steven, if applied wrong or at a slight angle, etc., it may not have full contact.
Any ducting is in place as it should be.
Any wiring(fan or sensor) re-connected, etc..Also, don't over-tighten screws as well.
Since, you know its related to the previous work you did, it needs to be rechecked.
