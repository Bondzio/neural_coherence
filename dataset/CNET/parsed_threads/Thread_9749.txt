<s> I am having a problem with my Wintv-PVR-250 tuner card, has any one seen this kind of problem? </s>
<s> Think it maybe hardware. </s>
<s> No error message just distortion in the live TV. </s>
<s> Sometimes its vertical lines and sometimes its horizontal lines. </s>
<s> I have updated WinTV PVR-250 software and drivers all the way through too WinTV 6 and have the same problem. </s>
<s> Thanks Kirkwa1 </s>
<s> Today I have to write the a new user of analog capture MIGHT and WILL complain about issues with video capture that just years ago folk accepted as normal. </s>
<s> I can't tell but your post on its own makes me think you haven't done this before. </s>

<s> I don't understand your answer. </s>
<s> I am not complain about, as you say, &quot;new user of analog capture MIGHT and WILL complain about issues with video capture that just years ago folk accepted as normal.&quot; The problem I am having is so so bad, you can not see a picture. </s>
<s> As for my post, are you suggesting I have post this question in the wrong forum? </s>
<s> Analog capture is full of bad things waiting for us to discuss. </s>
<s> I can't tell from your first post how bad it was. </s>
<s> Maybe you can put in the full details and a youtube of the results? </s>
<s> Some folk are easily upset at discussion forums so if that's you, we might not get along. </s>
<s> I have analog capture experience to before the Amiga days, even on the IBM 8088 days so I'm ready when you tell more. </s>
<s> In the meantime if you want to know what I use for the capture step it's a DVD RECORDER. </s>
<s> That's my secret. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well Bob, I think I will visit a forum where the people are a bit more constructive. </s>
<s> Seen people like you before, they enjoy wasting others time. </s>
<s> If you decide you can share the details about the source and more, I have this thread tracked. </s>
