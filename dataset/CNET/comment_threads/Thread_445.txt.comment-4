i bought the vase majority of my current builds parts from them and had no problems whatsoever.
delivery time was extremely quick too.
i ordered a few flash drives first to test them out and since i used the budget shipping i figured it'd be a week or 2 before stuff showed up.
i think it was 5 days later i got home from class and they had arrived so they are very quick when it comes to getting stuff to you.
