the limit is actually 4gb minus address space reserved for other memory, most notably your graphics memory.
without getting into the details, you might be able to use, say, 3.5gb out of your 4gb of ram.
so there can be a benefit to going for 4gb over 3gb, but it is slight, especially since many programs may not be able to make efficient use of that level of ram.
also, you're still getting the hardware, so technically you could upgrade to a 64-bit os later and get the full benefit.
i doubt many people will do this though.
