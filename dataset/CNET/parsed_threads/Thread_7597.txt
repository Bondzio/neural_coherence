<s> All of a sudden a window pops up and says &quot;Windows Explore has stopped working&quot;. </s>
<s> It then tells me that windows explorer is restarting. </s>
<s> Every time I try to get in that external hard drive I keep getting the same thing. </s>
<s> I wound up restoring the deleted files and it seemed to work again, I moved some files over to my other external hard drive only no for it to happen to both of them. </s>
<s> Funny thing is that my computer still see and read those hard drives. </s>
<s> My windows media player still plays the music on them. </s>
<s> I at one time disconnected all my usb devices and just plugged in 1 of the hard drives and it worked for a bit. </s>
