<s> I recently changed the DVD burner in my machine, and now Windows Media Player 10 no longer seems to be able to see (or burn on) CDs. </s>
<s> Also having similar problems with MS Mobie Maker. </s>
<s> What can i do to make the apps see my burner again? </s>
<s> Microsoft may or may not have patches for this one. </s>
<s> Try using the software that came with the recorder. </s>
