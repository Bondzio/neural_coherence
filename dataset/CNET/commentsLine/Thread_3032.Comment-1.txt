i have a router and two pcs on it.
one (ethernet connected to the router) has a printer and i want to share it with the other pc.
i set up the printer as shared then i went to the other pc (wireless connection to the router) and tried to define a remote printer.
the printer add wizard cannot find the printer: i tried browsing and it found nothing; i tried telling it the printer was \\pcname\printername and it couldn't find it either what am i missing?
both machines are running winxp home john
