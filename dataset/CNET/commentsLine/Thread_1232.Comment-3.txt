willy, you are so right.
i took the hd out of my old acer and placed it in the hp computer and guess what?!!
same problem.
i figured the mb on the hp computer was to blame and took everything out of it i could...ie dvd burners and some cables.
thanks a lot!!
i will be calling hp explaining the problem.
thanks again.
