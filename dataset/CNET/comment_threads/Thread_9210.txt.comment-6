Went by my moms this evening to try a few things I read about on the web.
Just for giggles, I connected my personal laptop to the network (wirelessly) to see which computer I could connect to and so on.
I was immediately able to access my moms laptop (the Acer) and she was able to access mine.
The desktop (Compaq) was able to see and access all shared folders on BOTH laptops.
It was also able to transfer files and folders between the 3.
Neither of the 2 laptops were able to access any files or folders on the Compaq (desktop).
You can see the desktop on both laptops, but if you try to access it, you get the error &quot;Network Path Not Found&quot;.
Also, fwiw, the icon for the Compaq is dimmed on both laptops.
thanks
