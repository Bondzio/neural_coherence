if you just want to transfer files from the old hd, then remove the cd drive, jumper the hd as cs, attach to end of ide cable, start computer, enter bios, set sata drive as primary boot drive and transfer away!
if that doesn't work, try the same config, except with the hd jumpered as ma.
* * * * * if you want to keep to have the old hd installed as a second hd and still keep the cd drive installed, then you will need to spend a little more time playing with different cable placements and jumperings.
with the cd drive attached to the end of the cable, you could try these hd jumperings and positions: sl, middle cs, middle with the cd drive attached to the middle of the cable (many cd drives like cs jumpering), you can try these hd settings: ma, end cs, end
