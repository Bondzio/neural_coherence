<s> Does anyone have a website that lets you compare the difference between two processors? </s>
<s> If so, please tell me the website. </s>
<s> Or if you know the reason why a laptop's processor is slower than a desktop's processor, please tell me an answer. </s>
<s> Help is appreciated. </s>
<s> laptops have slower processors because they have to be power efficient because they run on batteries. </s>
