System completes POST fine, displays the graphic then chills for half a minute. There is NO disk or processor activity (checked using BOOTVIS). Also played with various BIOS settings and BOOT.INI params, however it ALWAYS appears to pause for 30 before the disk starts the &quot;propper&quot; boot? ASUS A7N8X D MOBO, AMD 2200, Maxtor SATA disk. Anyone with a suggestion?

To speed it up, we set it to boot from the hard disk. Lucky for us the bios has a BOOT FROM menu that pops up if you press some key so we don't need to set the BIOS to boot from CD if that's required. Bob

Thanks, you did open another avenue of investigation, it's a SATA system disk and has a RAID controller associated (although it's not RAIDED) and there is an error with XMASSCSI in the event log on startup. This does seem to occur AFTER the 30 second delay in the startup sequence of events but is worth some experimentation I guess. Oh for another 30 seconds! Thanks again.

I believe mine is also related to a RAID (Asus A8V) problem; even though I'm not using SATA ot RAID. Like old age, I don't like it but I'm learning to live with it. Check back to this post occasionally 'cause if I find a fix for my problem, I'll post it here.
