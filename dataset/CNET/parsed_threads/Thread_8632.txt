<s> Being income tax season and all, I decided when I get mine back any day now, I'm going to use some of it to build a new PC. </s>
<s> Right now I have a prehistoric VIA computer that runs at 700MHz and can barely do anything without bogging down. </s>
<s> I don't want a top of the line PC that will cost over a grand and allow me to play Crysis with max settings or anything, but something good enough to watch movies and play newer games at medium settings would be great. </s>
<s> Here's what I have so far: CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103211 AMD Athlon 64 x2 5000+ = $100 Mobo: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138081 BIOSTAR TF560 = $70 (after rebate) Memory: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820211188 A-DATA 4GB DDR2 800 = $80 DVD/CD Drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827151153 Samsung = $30 HDD: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148261 Seagate Barracuda 250GB = $67 Total thus far: $357 So assuming all of this is good and all, I still need a competent video card, a good monitor and maybe a new power supply? </s>
<s> I have speakers/keyboard/mouse and operating system covered. </s>
<s> &quot;a prehistoric VIA computer that runs at 700MHz&quot; would need some 100 Watt PSU plus almost any case will do. </s>
<s> Your new machine might be in need of a decent, well ventilated case where the 700MHz unit has been known to work in an enclosed box. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, I planned on buying a new case, which would come with a new PSU. </s>
<s> I should have worded by original post better, what I meant was maybe I'd need to buy a new PSU to replace the one that would come with my new case? </s>
<s> Like for instance, I was looking at this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129155 It comes with a 450W power supply, would that be good enough? </s>
<s> That case only has one fan, but the processor I am buying comes with a fan and heatsink, and the video card I buy will probably have one as well, would it stay cool enough in there? </s>
<s> You added some power hungry graphics card. </s>
<s> Just checking. </s>
<s> Did you research about how 4GB shows as 2.x to 3.5GB with most versions of Windows? </s>
<s> You mentioned in your other post, buying a case with a psu, don't count on that psu. </s>
<s> All too often its minimal output, in fact buy a better psu to handle your current needs and possible future demands. </s>
<s> If you follow the posts here, psus are a common failure. </s>
<s> They are the bedrock of a decent system and shouldn't be taken for granted. </s>
<s> They often are and poof at some later date, they become an issue. </s>
<s> You may want to reviews past posts on the topic, just use the forum search engine. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> the sonata has a 120mm fan and very good airflow. </s>
<s> you can add a front 80mm fan if you want but it really won't be necessary for your build. </s>
<s> here are some video card choices. </s>
<s> geforce 8600gt, 256mb, $96 (before $20 rebate): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127286 geforce 8600gts, 256mb, $110 (before $20 rebate): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814141055 geforce 9600gt, 512mb, $181: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127332 the 9600gt requires a 500w power supply, but your antec 450w will be fine. </s>
<s> It might be a little pricy for you but i suggest you go ahead and get a new case and atleast a new PSU. </s>
<s> The most attractive option i found for the money was from Apevia, they have options of colors (red, blue, and green) but i got a blue one and it looks great. </s>
<s> PSU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817148028 Case: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811144211 Together they come out to around $200, but its money well spent, there are cheaper options if you shop around you might be able to cut it down to around $150 </s>
