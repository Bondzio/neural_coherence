yes i did everything from contacting manufacturer of motherboard and computer maker and redownloaded every driver that they had for this board, plus uninstalled, and reinstalled every attachment to my system but still get the same errors on start-up.
belarc only shows the items i have on my system at present so why would these found new hardware errors keep coming up?
