that seams like a great deal for the burner... but only get a dual layer drive if you think you'll need to burn dual layer discs (almost 100% of american home dvd players don't play dual layer) & you can get a single layer drive cheaper i think.
i just got a 120gig wd hard drive at best buy for $60 after rebate.
don't think it was sata though... so if you know the diff... research & see what you need/want.
