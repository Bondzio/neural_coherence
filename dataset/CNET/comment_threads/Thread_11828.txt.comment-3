I should have mentioned, you're better off re-installing the pgms.
you plan to swap data from.
Once that's done, you can then more easily copy data from old source to new under XP.
Otherwise, with XP it can get sticky, so don't try to defeat this if you plan to install on new HD.
Once, you're happy, you can reformat the old HD and use as an ext.
HD for backup or whatever.
