I can't figure out which is faster between the various 9800 and 8800 models.
I thought the 9800 was faster, but then I heard that the Gigabyte 8800GT can easily be OCed to 770-780 on top of its factory OC at 700mhz.
If this is true, that makes it one hell of a fast card, but most tech comparisons seem to show the 9800s putting out higher FPS numbers.
I want to run 3 of one type of these cards in SLI, but I am not even sure if the 8800GT can be run in 3 way SLI (I know the Ultra can).
Excluding the 9800GX2, what SINGLE SLOT GPU out of the 8800 and 9800 lines is the best for gaming?
On top of that, which company would you recommend to buy it from?
The responses so far have been very helpful so far and I think I have most everything ironed out and finalized except for the GPU.
I need to know what GPU should be pushing this 3x SLI setup.
Thanks for the responses ^^.
