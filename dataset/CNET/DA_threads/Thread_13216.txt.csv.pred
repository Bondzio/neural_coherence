1.1.1	Im trying to upgrade my dell inspiron 546 due to lack of funds to build a new rig .	St
1.1.2	I have bought graphics cards in past , but ive never bought a PSU or put in a PSU before , but I am sure , with guidance I could certainly do it .	St
1.1.3	I want to make sure these parts will actually work with my inspiron before i buy them so thats why I am posting here today .	St
1.1.4	PSU : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139026 Vid Card : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814130839 I know that the current graphics card i have in now is a 220 GT and its worth about 30 dollars and its pretty old along with my computer .	St
1.1.5	So I dont know if this new card would even work with my mobo or anything and i also dont know if the PSU would fit in my tower ( Its not a slim so it should ? )	Ques
1.2.1	I did n't find your model so you should link to your exact model .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html on the page http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-3.html shows a few 650 video cards so a good choice .	St
1.2.3	That PSU looks to be the MINIMUM asked for ( I read 450 Watt minimum on the pages so far ) and the full review at http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-boost-gk106-benchmark,3463.html has me worried about longevity of the PSU .	St
1.2.4	I see about 200 Watts alone for the Video card so if we want a 5 year machine we double the Watt capability of the PSU .	St
1.2.5	That 's a bit high at 900 so the PSU is an iffy choice here .	St
1.2.6	If you can get another 100 Watts and keep the single rail +12V then you should be fine for years .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	This is my computer , im not sure if this is what you wanted or not .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.dell.com/support/troubleshooting/us/en/19/Servicetag/B508GK1 Instead of the 430 maybe a 600W ?	Ques
1.3.3	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139028 Im just worried about the card not being compatible with my motherboard .	St
1.4.1	& quot ; PCI Express x16 one slot supporting full-height cards & quot ; So can you share what made you think it was incompatible ?	Ques
1.4.2	Once in a while you see a question about PCIe 1.x 2.x etc but the answer can un-nerve those that asked .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	While the first PSU choice was the minimum and should work , I winced at being too close to call .	St
1.5.2	This 600 is a single rail to avoid issues with setup and should get you years of use .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Ive had a few bad experiences upgrading video cards on a computer of mine when i was a kid , and I didnt know for sure if my motherboard had a PCI Express 3.0 x16 slot or if that card would fit , but thank you for your help .	St
1.6.2	So in conclusion I could upgrade my inspiron successfully with these parts ?	Ques
1.6.3	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814130910 and http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139028	Ques
1.7.1	That is what you can check ahead of time by getting the dimensions of the card and measuring .	Sug
1.7.2	As I do n't own this machine all I can write is that it looks OK .	St
1.7.3	If you want , wait for someone that will assure you further .	St
1.7.4	Good luck !	Polite
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	I measured and it seems the boost wont fit , but the previous one i mentioned will definitely fit in my case .	St
1.8.2	Thanks for all your help !	St
