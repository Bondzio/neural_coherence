1.1.4	then i got it installed got everything updated got avg/adware/spybot on it and updated.	St
1.1.5	then i took the computer back to the friend house and while i was settign it up for them it rebooted again on me, and sevreal more times while i was trying to do other things.	St
1.1.6	when i submitted the error reports to microsoft it spit back one of two things, driver error source unknown and possibly a memory problem.	St
1.1.7	but once again it coulnt pin point anything on ethier of the error reports.	St
1.1.8	i know its not a virus, so im thinking its etheir a hardware issue or a driver issue.	St

1.2.1	All too often, i teardown the system and place on cardboard.	St
1.2.2	Test it that way, so no shorts or possible heat issues don't arise.	St
1.2.3	If it does, then reduce system to bare minimum and take it from there, swap with other good parts.	St
1.2.4	If ram, swap it with known good ones.	St
1.2.5	Be sure the bios is generic or basic defaults.	St
1.2.6	BUT, be sure to check any cpu voltage are not fluctuating, etc.. A good and decent psu is a must as well for a fully stuffed system, of at least 400W+.	St
1.2.7	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	what power supply it has, so I'm going to surmise that its a value/included with case type thing, and 100% gurantee that any such PSU needds to be replaced and is 80% likely the cause of random reboot...	St
1.4.1	I totally forgot about the power supply not sure what it is off hand it came with the case when i got it from zipzoomfly, how ever tyhey no longer sell this piticular case so ill have to go to my friends house and physically look at it to find out.	St
1.4.2	ill post back when i get the information	St
