With everything you described, the base line new MacBook Pro will suit your needs just fine with one processor tied behind it's battery.
LOL Nothing you mentioned sounds like it will bog down the current line up of MBP unless when you said you run a lot of programs at the same time you mean 10 to 20 processes that would munch up all the resources of ANY portable machine.
(Mac or PC) With the new improved graphics, you'll be able to do plenty of photo editing even without enabling the faster 9600M GT graphics chip, which if you did enable it, will even give you the ability to edit today's higher resolution video, though you might want to max out the RAM with 4GB.
What it really boils down to, is how much you can afford.
Heck, if ya have the $2800 in your pocket to get the freshly unveiled 17&quot; MacBook Pro, you'd be able to keep that 200gb external drive just for back-ups since it comes with a 320GB drive standard.
Plus a battery that lasts a full 8 hrs.
and 1000 charges.
(which could very possibly be the life of any machine in college)
