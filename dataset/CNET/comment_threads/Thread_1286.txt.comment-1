I have a Dell GX280 small desktop computer.
Im trying to load the XP OS but when I go to the System Setup to change the boot sequence the following message comes up on the System Setup window.
I /O parity interrupted at 7000:O7BE.
Type (S)hut off NMI, (R)Reboot, other keys to continue.
The screen now is locked up.
What is this telling me and how do fix this problem
