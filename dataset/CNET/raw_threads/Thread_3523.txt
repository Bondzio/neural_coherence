You can pop in a Knoppix CD and it will run Qemu then Linux and while Windows ME is running you could access the NTFS volume. But the glacial speed would test anyone I know. So while not impossible the solution is likely too slow for any practical reason. Why not boot Linux and copy out the files you want to the Windows ME hard disk?
