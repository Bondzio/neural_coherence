<s> i recenty bought a 120g hd for my imac and unfortunately the internal rom drive on my imac is broken i only had an external(usb) rom drive. </s>
<s> I cannot install osx from external source. </s>
<s> So, is possible to transferz data from my old hd through the new one via ide cable? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> NO! </s>
<s> you will need to have your internal CDROM fixed or get a Firewire/USB CDROM that is bootable. </s>
<s> You need to boot from the CD to install OS X. OS X has thousands of invisible files that do not move when you copy the drive. </s>
<s> There are programs that will do it though, Carbon Copy Cloner being one, but you will still have to boot from something other than the drive being cloned. </s>
<s> The CD-ROM drive in your iMac is IDE, if you theoretically were to unplug the CD-ROMs ide and power cable and they were long enough to reach the HD then you could format and mount the new HD. </s>
<s> It might take a little tinkering but it is possible... Maurice </s>
<s> You don't mention which iMac you have nor which Operation System you are using, and both are vital to a good answer to your question. </s>
<s> I'm not clear whether you intend to replace the internal HD with new one or put it in a external case. </s>
<s> However, since I must guess, I would recommend that you download Carbon Copy Cloner (donation ware) from versiontracker.com onto your internal drive. </s>
<s> Then buy or borrow an external HD case and place your new HD in that. </s>
<s> They come in USB, Firewire or both. </s>
<s> Use Firewire if your iMac has it. </s>
<s> Then use that software to clone your entire internal HD to your new HD. </s>
<s> Then you can replace your internal HD with the new one if you like, or just leave it connected as an external one. </s>
<s> iMacs do not have a IDE connection for a second HD as do PowerMacs, so transfering data via IDE cable is either very difficult or impossible. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> you are right in saying that the CDROM is an IDE device BUT, the device inside the iMac has a special connector which supplies power and data transfer and is a different size than a regular IDE cable. </s>
<s> The ide cable on an iMac is exactly the correct length and will not reach the top of the CDROM let alone another HD. </s>
<s> No power cable either. </s>
<s> The guy needs to purchase a replacement CDROM and all this will go away. </s>
<s> Sooner or later he will have to install something that is on a CD. </s>
<s> The external Firewire/USB option and Carbon Copy cloner are also a possibility. </s>
<s> He will still need to replace the CDROM though. </s>
<s> A machine with two drives and no CDROM is a little handicapped. </s>
