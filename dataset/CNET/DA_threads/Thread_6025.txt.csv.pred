1.1.1	Hey All , I 'm in the process of upgrading my Dell PC and I have a couple questions about compatability .	St
1.1.2	I had hoped to buy Asus 's new SLI capable motherboard to run two Nvidia 6800 OC PCI express cards .	St
1.1.3	I also have an upgraded power supply .	St
1.1.4	What else to I need to purchase in order to get my system up and running ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks , M. Walsh	St
1.2.1	One major problem with OEM systems like Dell , Gateway , etc. , is when you decide to replace the mtrbd .	St
1.2.2	The physical size and location of mountings may not be proper or outright not compatible as a direct replacement .	St
1.2.3	What this means is you have to verify any replacement mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	is rated or designed to be one for your Dell system , otherwise do n't expect an easy drop-in and proceed forward w/o extra effort .	St
1.2.5	I suppose you were trying to re-use the Dell case ?	Ques
1.2.6	If not and plan to buy or have access to a generic of DYI case source , then you 're OK. Last , do n't expect the OS to be transferable , it may but it may not .	St
1.2.7	The OEM supplied OS is prone to work only what it was sold with , however Dell is more flexible than others , but again , I ca n't say for your model , 100 % sure .	St
1.2.8	enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	I actually have an extra case that i can use to transfer my system to so that wouldnt be a problem .	St
1.3.2	My main concern is the processors compatability with a new motherboard .	St
1.3.3	It would be nice to be able to pick up a new PCI express motherboard and grapics card and not have to drop $ 1000 on a new AMD processor .	St
1.4.1	CPUs , can be swapped amongest other mtrbds .	St
1.4.2	provided they 're supported .	St
1.4.3	The cpu type , model and/or class is best described by the mtrbd .	St
1.4.4	specs and what it entails .	St
1.4.5	You should have available new heatsink compound to use as the old may not work well once the seal is broken from removing the HSF and then cpu .	St
1.4.6	I 've done this mucho times and rarely have a problem .	St
1.4.7	Beware , though proper handling procedures from ESD ( static ) should be followed plus proper ordination into cpu socket .	St
1.4.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	The Asus is ONLY for AMD64 939 pin .	St
1.5.2	When all you keep from your old machine is the Power Supply and drives , that 's not an upgrade , it 's a whole new machine .	St
1.5.3	And SLI is just for bragging anyway .	St
1.5.4	Why spend an extra $ 500 for a 8 % bump in framerates .	St
1.5.5	You wont even be able to tell it 's working cuz a single 6800 OC is enough to turn all eyecandy to full anyway .	St
1.5.6	There is no SLI for P4 so you have to : 1 .	St
1.5.7	Buy AMD proc or 2 .	St
1.5.8	REthink SLI I do n't know if your 8250 had DDR or DDR2 ram .	St
1.5.9	Hopefully not DDR2 cuz thats only for P4 .	St
1.5.10	Maybe if you gave your Proc speed , ram size and number of DIMMs we could find a path for you .	St
