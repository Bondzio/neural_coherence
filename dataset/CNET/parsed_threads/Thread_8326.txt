<s> Since I connected a 19&quot; eMachines monitor to my HP Pavilion computer (that runs Windows XP Home Edition), the bottoms of some dialogue boxes are not visible. </s>
<s> Those dialogue boxes are rectangular vertically and their sizes cannot be changed. </s>
<s> This especially happens when I attempt to print a .pdf document and also when I set the printing preferences for my Canon MP 980 printer. </s>
<s> The bottom of the dialogue box (including the &quot;OK&quot;) button is not visible, even after I place the dialogue box as close to the top of the screen as possible. </s>
<s> I've tried various screen resolutions, none of which help. </s>
<s> Many thanks for assistance in resolving this issue. </s>
<s> When this happens I use the PANNING display trick noted at http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19688_102-381848.html?tag=threadListing;forum-threads Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply to my post. </s>
<s> Your subject was &quot;You won't like the solution,&quot; but I WILL like it if it works. </s>
<s> I'll give it a try. </s>
<s> Meanwhile, if anyone else can offer additional solutions, I'll be glad to have them. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
