I did it several years ago and then went to buying the dells. Currently I have a dell 4600. It just does not do the trick anymore. I want to build a really decent machine. I prefer intel chips but I could be swayed. I currently have an ATI 9600 AGP video card which is good enough for now. It would be great if I can use my existing memory but I am okay if I can't. So here is the questions Which MB shoudl I buy Which Processor chip should I buy Case? Currently I am fine wiht my HD's Just want to know what I should be looking for. I would like to keep the system under $1,000 being that I have the video card, hd's and possibly some memory I don't thik it should be that hard. Please let me know what I shoudl buy. I try and keep my machines for abour 3 years. I want this to be totally compatible with vista and run fast as well. Please help.

Wait until the neew AMD processors com out so that the price of the AMD Athlon X2 3800+ goes down. The same with the motherboard. I also recommend the Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe. Its not a new MB but it has won a lot of awards.
