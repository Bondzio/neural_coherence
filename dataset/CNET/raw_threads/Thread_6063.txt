My 89-year-old mother wants desperately to have &quot;a copying machine&quot; so she can copy family documents and photos to distribute to relatives before she dies. She won't go near a computer, although she will use a photocopier. My question: Is there a personal copier for $200 or so which will operate as a standalone item, i. e., without a computer connection? It would need to be compact enough for her to use in her room. It would need to be easy to use, with clearly marked controls. The device only needs to scan and print, nothing fancy.

However, you mention $200 and that really is too low, maybe more into the $400 range if you're lucky. You best bet is to check any decent office outlet center or go online even those same office centers. Of course, you look into a rental/lease for a month or more and see if that's possible but have all your ducks in a row in order to make the best use out of it. tada -----Willy
