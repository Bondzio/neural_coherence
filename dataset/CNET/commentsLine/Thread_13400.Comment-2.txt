what's in the rest of the machine?
just like we read at  many change video cards, add this or that as well as the power supply ages and then they are caught in a vicious spiral of blaming drivers, reloading windows or more.
in short, the number of 1+ghz machines i've fixed by simply upsizing the power supply is nothing short of amazing.
there is no reason to shortchange the power since 450 watt psus are 15 to 30 bucks.
