it has a controller with firmware on it.
that's what ids the drive and it properties.
the controller could be good and the platters bad but the drive show in the bios just fine.
you can't expect to successfully replace the platters either.
in fact, removing the originals yourself is likely to reduce the probability that a drive recovery service can get your picture for you as well.
if the controller on the hd is bad, it's sometimes possible to find an exact replacement and swap that part.
no opening of the shell is needed.
