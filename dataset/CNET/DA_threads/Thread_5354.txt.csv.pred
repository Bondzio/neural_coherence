1.1.1	I 'm looking for a new graphics card for my XP pro 2.8 GHZ computer .	St
1.1.2	I do n't have much to spend and I see several Nvidia 6200 s on sale on ebay for 49.99 + approx $ 10 shipping .	St
1.1.3	I have an Nvidia FX 5200 PCI now .	St
1.1.4	My motherboard is an intel d865glc with an 8X AGP slot .	St
1.1.5	Would I notice a lot of improvement ?	Ques
1.2.1	there is a few shader improvements from the FX 5xxx range graphics cards towards the 6xxx range cards , but performance wise from a FX 5200 to 6200 very little , its a cheap card and ok for newer games on lower resolution like 800x600 and maby 1024x768 but when you want to play on high quality modes with Anti-Aliasing ( Multisampling ) and Anisoptropic-Filtering to give the game more depth and details you would wan na consider a Geforce 6600GT and higher or X600 / X1600 / X800 and higher , especially on FPS games like Quake 4 , Call Of Duty 2 , FEAR even the previous titles Doom 3 , Half Life 2 and Far Cry requires more Graphics Processing Power to be played enjoyably and on eye candy modes ... On the AGP side , the ATi Radeon 9800 Pro-128 Meg and 9800 XT-256 Meg version was some of the best AGP card and still compares very well with X700 and Geforce 6600+GT PCI-X range cards , and might even be still available at a very good price .
