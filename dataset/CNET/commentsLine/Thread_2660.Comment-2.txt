yes there are issues with many gcs not running right on emachines, believe me, i know as i was owner of more than one.
not so much with software and other hardware but graphics card adds, yes.
i couldn't get a graphics card to function properly in it, tried radeon , geforce, gave up.
you can try a radeon or geforce and hopefully have better luck than mine and they told me the same with each, &quot;there are issues with this card&quot; , well, i would have to assume issues with pretty much any graphics card.
one suggestion would be to add an extra case fan or get a graphics card with a fan.
you may not have enough airflow through the case and many components will run hotter.
i did do this to mine but it made no difference for the gc.
how do you know it's running hot?
what os do you use and what model is the emachines?
