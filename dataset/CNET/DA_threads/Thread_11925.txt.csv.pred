1.1.1	At the CES show in Vegas ( 2013 ) , a company ( Milllenniata ) is claiming to have single layer DVD disks ( 4.7 GB ) that use available burners to make an actual engraved mark to the disk storage layer resulting in storage that will last 'thousands of years & quot ; .	St
1.1.2	Disks can be played on regular DVD players and devices .	St
1.1.3	These are expensive compared to regular disks but if the storage capacity and longevity of them is accurate ( and not just media hype ) , it seems a good solution .	St
1.1.4	Here 's a link to the CNet article : http : //news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20091808-1/millenniata-m-disk-the-possibility-of-permanent-data-archival/ .	St
1.1.5	The Millenenniata web site ( http : //www.mdisc.com/ ) has a list of current burners that work with this media and you can also order media from them directly .	St
1.1.6	I have no connection with this company at all .	St
1.1.7	I am certainly wondering if the marketing is accurate and if anyone has any experience with these given how new they are .	St
1.2.1	Under the right conditions a normal DVD can go many years but your real issue is if you see a player for such in a few years .	St
1.2.2	We already have tablets and laptops without them .	St
1.2.3	It 's going the way for the floppy disc .	St
1.2.4	Bob PS .	St
1.2.5	It 's marketing and many will fall for it .	St
1.3.1	I wonder who that person is .	St
1.3.2	I want to know his secret ( not the making of dvd ) ... the & quot ; highlander & quot ; , hehe ?	Ques
1.4.1	I store large numbers of RAW photo files as well as high resolution audio and video files ( multi-GB ) so the typical cloud solutions are either too slow or too expensive for the size of files I am shuffling around .	St
1.4.2	Maybe DVDs are on the way out for the common users .	St
1.4.3	I am rather confident they will stay around for some time for those in my situation -- and there are quite a few of us .	St
1.4.4	Its either DVDs or RAID storage and the continual replacement of RAID drives makes that a less than ideal solution .	St
1.4.5	The M-Disc solution seems to get around the finite nature of HD ( regardless of whether it is solid state or rotational ) life .	St
1.4.6	Given the physics of what Milllenniata is doing -- and while I 'm not a physics prof , what they are doing is physically possible -- their solution has distinct possibilities .	St
1.4.7	So has any one used M-Discs and what has been your experience with them ?	Ques
1.5.1	I looked and it looks like pure marketing .	St
1.5.2	Kodak and others do make extended life media which is simply another top coat to guard against a scratch .	St
1.5.3	Let 's REPEAT prior answers about life span .	St
1.5.4	http : //www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.05/docs/CDandDVDCareandHandlingGuide.pdf You can get 100 years from good media under the right storage and handling conditions .	St
1.5.5	That is , you wo n't be around to test it .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	Since this is still in the CES loop and not readily available and/or in initial stages of possible purchase , it 's all too new .	St
1.6.2	If a user has a need for 1,000s yrs .	St
1.6.3	of media storage , heck that 's the way to go .	St
1.6.4	Me and you as home users , well would n't there be something more advantageous in the future .	St
1.6.5	Of course , they 're expensive , it 's all new and such .	St
1.6.6	It 's nice they can be played on std .	St
1.6.7	players/drives that is a plus in IMO .	St
1.6.8	What value of this new media is still left to the open market .	St
1.6.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
