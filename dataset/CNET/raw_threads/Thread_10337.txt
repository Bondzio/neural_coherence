My wireless adapter is a talktalk snu5630ns 05. using the administrative account it connects fine, but if i go into the limited account it doesn't connect (or just says connection is limited so no internet). Any thoughts please?

See link.	http://www.threatcode.com/admin_rights.htm There are indeed products that don't work when using a limited account. There's a Belkin WIFI product in that list but I didn't do further research on this other than to write &quot;yup.&quot; Bob

For finer control one could look at XP Pro and it's finer controls on accounts plus we have NTFS permissions, ownership as well as the registry. Bob

Limited accounts are used to prevent others from changing computer configurations.

The maker of the device has to update their drivers and installer to allow limited users to use it or give the option during install to ask &quot;Allow use by Limited User Accounts?&quot; Bob
