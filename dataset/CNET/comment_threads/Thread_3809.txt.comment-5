is preferred as compared to what you have calculated (400w) for which, the lower it is, the more work the PSU will have to do, thus leading to more heat generating, which will create more heat.
Furthermore, SLi cards running on 400w is a little too weak, and if you are lucky, it will run ably.
I would suggest you looking for at least a 500w PSU, for future, as you may never know the possibility of adding an additional hdd, or optical drive, or even plug in more power-draining external devices and who knows, an additional GPU card.
This will at least covers you all possible upgrades in future, plus letting your PSU to run cooler and quieter.
Do check the power output is the true consistent output or the maximum segmented output (the output is can sustain is the same throughtout instead of those PSU which only can sustain a short moment as I have encountered before with my friend's)
