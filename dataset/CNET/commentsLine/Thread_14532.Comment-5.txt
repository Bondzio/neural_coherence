i understand your concern regarding the lexar jumpdrive and this is a known issue with lexar jump drives.
please note that lexar jump drive would not work in the front usb ports, this is because the front usb ports are passive ports and do not provide initialization power which may be required by some of the usb devices to function, there is not enough power in the front ports of computer for usb flash drives to work.
