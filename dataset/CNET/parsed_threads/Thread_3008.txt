<s> For some strange reason I haven't figured out yet why, I can't get past the following, when attempting to load Maxblast3 on a clean (formatted) drive. </s>
<s> &quot;IDE CD-ROM device driver installed&quot; The screen displayes this message then hangs up. </s>
<s> I thought it might be something in the the CMOS setup but I don't see anything there that is out of line - so to speak. </s>
<s> I have a MSI K8N Neo Platinum 3000+ board with an eVGA video card and 512 Kingston stick of memory. </s>
<s> Since this is a &quot;home build&quot; I can't go to the mfg for an answer . </s>
<s> Oh yes, this is an 80Gb Maxtor drive that I want to run Maxblast on. </s>
<s> Would anyone share their knowledge of this type of problem? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Leland Winters leewintl@cox.net </s>
<s> You posted your email in the clear for spam robot harvesters to pickup. </s>
<s> MAXBLAST is not usually installed to the hard disk. </s>
<s> Most of the time you use it to test a drive. </s>
<s> If you want less spam, make a new (safer) post and ask this one be deleted. </s>
