are you saying it won't recongize a 40gb partition or a physical hd 40gb size.
its important, as then you could partition a large hd into smaller partitions under 40gb, probably 32gb as the limit for each partition.
did you visit the hd makers website for hd install s/w to help install beyond whatever the bios limits are?
good luck -----willy
