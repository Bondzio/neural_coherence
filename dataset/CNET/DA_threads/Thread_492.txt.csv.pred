1.1.1	Hi , this is just a quick question .	St
1.1.2	In a few months i will be assembeling my gaming pc .	St
1.1.3	Specs : i5 3570k gtx 660ti 8gb ram 1tb hdd 500gb hdd 600w psu I need to know weather i should choose liquid or air cooling heatsink for my psu .	St
1.1.4	Also could you tell me if all liquid heatsinks have to have water replaced ?	Ques
1.2.1	Are you in some climate where you have a room over 38C ?	Ques
1.3.1	Cool the PSU ?	Ques
1.3.2	You do n't want any liquid by the PSU in case it fails ( leaks ) .	St
1.3.3	As for water , most tend to add some anti-fungi killer ( anti-freeze ) in order to control the growth of such .	St
1.3.4	AND/OR use a specialized liquid that maybe part of the kit or some additive .	St
1.3.5	While you can water cool , having back-up air fans , will do fine just to keep it all together .	St
1.3.6	I wouldn'ty cool the PSU offhand , but everything else can be .	St
1.3.7	However , I tend to think , BIG PC case in order to mave room and additional areas to place fans and/or mount whatever .	St
1.3.8	Plus , a decent case may lend itself to custom builds thus you start from the ground up rather than thinking GPU and CPU stuff , having a good case and PSU is a must , IMHO .	St
1.3.9	Further , once you start stuffing the case , you rather not move it over to something better later , you 'll probably keep the case as it came , so having a better case from the beginning is a good idea .	St
1.3.10	Of course , you could think & quot ; oil immersion & quot ; placing entire PC in oil vat .	St
1.3.11	google for examples .	St
1.3.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	sorry , typo error .	Polite
1.4.2	cool cpu not psu sorry again	Polite
1.5.1	I build and I do n't use them for gaming .	St
1.5.2	A few dollars to keep that CPU running cool and reliably is money well spent for me .	St
1.5.3	You can check out the HS CPU options over at http : //www.frostytech.com VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	There are plenty of 3rd party cpu replacement fans .	St
1.6.2	Just be sure its rated for use with your cpu and it will fit inside the case , sometimes its a tight fit .	St
1.6.3	I mention that as some fan and heatsink setups are huge or unique arrangements of sorts .	St
1.6.4	Check online vendors for sources .	St
1.6.5	IMHO , a few or well placed case fans help greatly and its best to do all this when you 're building rather than later .	St
1.6.6	Heat stress is a killer of gaming PCs .	St
1.6.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
