<s> I am using a BT HomHub to connect wirelessly to the internet at home. </s>
<s> I have been using this hub for over a year now and i am the only person in the house who uses the wifi as the other computer is connected by ethernet. </s>
<s> Recently the internet on my computer has stopped working, it appears connected but web pages wont load. </s>
<s> When i have a look at my connections the SSID of my hub appears twice and im connected by default to the second one (i have linked to a screen shot below). </s>
<s> While my computer is not loading the internet the one that is connected via ethernet works fine. </s>
<s> Is there any settings i can change that may have caused this to happen or do i need to get a new hub? </s>
<s> thanks screen shot: http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/7845/hubob3.jpg </s>
<s> sorry i forgot to mention that sometimes resetting the hub works and sometimes it doesnt it is not a complete solution to the problem. </s>
<s> You change the SSID? </s>
<s> Also, there is a hack software that kids run that spoof the station SSID. </s>
<s> Look up CNET EVIL TWIN on google. </s>
<s> But that issue vanishes when you set it up per our forum sticky. </s>
