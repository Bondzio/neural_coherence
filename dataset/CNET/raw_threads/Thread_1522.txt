I contacted Dell and they asked me to diag the disk by bringing up system diagnostics and pressing 'ctrl-alt-d' (NOT 'ctrl-alt-del') to start hard disk diagnostics. The thing ran for a minute and came back with a 'RC=7' error code. The Dell agent said my hard disk is about to die and I need a new hard disk. Is this true? My compueter runs albeit erratiically but it is usable. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks.
