14116	0	45542	538254	NR	NancyR	11/12/04 6:37 PM	1.10028462E12	What is wrong with	In another post (sorry I forget where) someone said that is was not a good idea to use packet writing. I rely on DirectCD for backing up critical files to CD. It has always been quirky and I often have trouble reading the disks on other computers but I have finally gotten it to work smoothly on the two computers that are most important to me (home and work). Am I making a mistake here? What is the best way to back up to CD? Thanks.

And if it is reliable all I have ever needed to do is to wait for it to eventually hiccup for those that never had an issue. Which is why I simply erase a CDRW (now DVDRW), record what I want and treat it like a CDR or DVDR... Bob

What software are you using?&quot; You didn't write about use with other computers. That issue pans InCD/DirectCD and is its biggest weakness. When I use the simple erase and record (as if it's a CDR or DVDR), then most other machines see if as I need it to be. That's a new question about compatibility issues with InCD/DirectCD. The answer is that you get to test for such. I don't have to test since I do not use InCD/DirectCD or such. ---------------------- Today I use Nero, CDBurnerXP, Roxio, Easy CD, and K3b to create my CD and DVDs. For video work I have other titles I use, but that was not the topic. Bob
