is anyone aware of any utilities available to restore the cd-rom on a win98 or win98se?
the pc is a sad piece of atticware (dell optiplex, 200mhz processor, 64mb ram, 1.9gb hdd) that my sister got for free.
the cd-rom has power, but won't load any disks, and doesn't show up as a drive anywhere (including bios?!!).
i have utilities i can use to squeeze a little more out of this pc and get her up and running, but i dread having to dig out all my old floppies and loading everything to them.
i haven't cracked open the case yet(god forbid), and told my sis maybe we should just go look for something slightly less intimidating to my newfound geek skills...
