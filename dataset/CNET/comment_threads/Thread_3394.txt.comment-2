I just want opinions on the two.
I think I may lean towards an iMac, even though upgrades are limited compared to the Pro.
I know quite a bit about them hardware-wise.
I'm using it for: gaming, everyday work, photo editing, video creation and editing, heavy music creation and editing, the whole deal.
Of course, all Macs are for that stuff except gaming, but I only play stuff occasionally.
Any tips on if the iMac is worth the limited upgrades would be appreciated.
