obviously i've either mis-stated my inquiry or users here simply didn't understand.
i've backed up data for years on my pc to tape drives.
i currently use retrospect 6.5 and a seagate tape drive.
and yes, i do have a backup plan and can restore data at will.
now, that i've made that crystal clear, does anyone want to actually answer my question and recommend an external hard drive that can replace the tape drive.
if you don't have a civil answer, please don't bother responding.
thanks.
