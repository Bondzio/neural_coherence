the prices for the following are dropping pretty fast: GeForce 6800GT for $374 CAD ($311 USD) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1211889&CatId=0 or Radeon X800XL for $310 CAD ($257 USD) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1476859&CatId=0 both are getting cheaper by the day, but is the GeForce worth the extra $64?
