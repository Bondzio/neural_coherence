the video card you're using seems to be good enough for gaming.
but you can greatly improve its gaming performance simply by adding another identical card to your system and setting up an sli configuration.
though i don't know if your motherboard is sli-ready or not, since you did not indicate that.
but if it is, you can add another card (it will have to be an identical card) and have your pc operate in sli mode.
however, if you do go the sli route, you may have to upgrade to a bigger power supply, since the 400 watts you're using now won't be enough for an sli system.
you can then upgrade your ram to 4 gigs.
but if your system is not sli-ready, then you can still improve on it by upgrading to a faster video card and adding more ram.
but you will probably still have to get a bigger power supply anyway, since most of the newer video cards out there require at least 500 watts minimum to run properly.
