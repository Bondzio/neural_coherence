My Toshiba never runs hot but my Sonys (3) and my HP are cookers! I think without the cooler underneath, the HP esp. would have fried again. Here's the link to what I use: http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=75004

Keep your fan and cooling system clean - vacuum is what I use. The I use little wooden pads on the bottom of the computer so it is raised about 3/4 inch off table - seems air flow is not adequate when the hot air is pushed out via the fan on my computer - Toshiba Satellite. Works and can take these little wooden pads with me anywhere.

I just position them so they are not blocking any vents on the laptop. by getting in off the table a good inch or so it will run about 15 degrees cooler. I am going to go with the wooden peg idea as it sounds very feasible for carrying the laptop elsewhere.

You can buy laptop cooling gear easily, but they often run off of the computer's USB port, which on some laptops is needed; they're usually relatively inefficient; etc. The best and cheapest thing you can possibly do is get some air flow to it. If you feel like opening up the machine, there are more efficient fans OR alternative cooling systems you can install if nothing else works. This is more difficult than in a desktop tower, though, be warned. My old Vaio is terrible, with multiple system problems this summer with the CD drive, hard drive, CPU, etc. Even with the small legs opened on the back to provide a bit of airspace, it's still extremely hot. So, I do exactly what the first guy said: prop it up. Four blocks of wood, spaced to not block the vents, help immensely, especially when coupled with a fan. HOWEVER, be sure to use this fix to its full potential: don't work off of your lap or a crowded table, keep the fan blowing in the direction that the vents are pointed (if any direction at all, you don't want to counteract its built-in defense against heat damage), and just putting up the legs or one set of supports won't work well because there's a vacuum and minimal air flow. If high enough and placed well, you shouldn't have much of a problem. Contrary to some people's opinion, iced beer cans will do more harm than good &gt;:o Good luck, and resort to installing a better internal cooling system or external devices if this is still insufficient. Some people copy their hard drive's contents to an external (and therefore usually cooler) drive just in case of a burnout, and uninstall the original; they can then boot from the external. External CD drives can use the same principle, as they too are a major generator of heat in computers. Hope this helps!

Now, although it gets hot in California, once your indoors, the heat usually isn't enough to overheat my laptop. But in Hawaii, it's so humid here that unless the room is air conditioned cold, indoors or outdoors my laptop vent gets hot enough to burn my palm. Especially when I play games on the laptop. Immediately after realizing this, I got worried and went and invested in the Antec notebook cooler. After a day using it, there was no difference. The reason why is because unlike most laptops (but like many) my laptop vents on the side, not underneath which poses a bad problem. No matter how I positioned the laptop to the 2 fans, it would never cool. So beware of this oversight. Now, the solution I have found that cools it very rapidly and effectively is to use the electronics-safe dust off compressed air blowers. For those who have used this product, have you noticed that after blowing the dust-off for about half a minute, the container quickly gets cold and icy and the air coming out is very very cold. The can even warns of the risk of frostbite because of this. When my laptop gets to a burning degree, I point and spray the dust-off directly into the vent for about 2 seconds, shake the canister, then spray into the vent again, and repeat this process until the canister is cold and the fan/vent is cooled to it's normal degree. The only downside to this method is that it doesn't take too long before the vent starts getting to burning temperatures again. Probably between 20 to 30 minutes. So one would need to keep applying if the laptop starts overheating as easy as it does here in Hawaii. The upside is that it is an easy, effective, and cheap way to keep it from overheating/cool. I buy my 24oz 4 pack from Costco for $14 and have seen single canisters sell for as cheap as 2-3 dollars. Also, it helped me with my specific problem of having my vent on the side of the laptop instead of on the bottom where most of the laptop air coolers can only cool. I hope this helps anyone who has the same problems as I have whether looking for a cheap effective alternative or having a vent opening in a hard to cool area that the normal laptop coolers can't get to.

I got Mone Off Of Ebay eor under $19. Mine is about 5/16th Thick and it Has 3 Cooling Fans in it That Run Off Your USB Port. They Come in Assorted Shapes and Sizes. So Shop around. I know That Best Buy Carries them I Have Even Seen Them With a USB Hub Built in to them and They have Their Own Power Supply. My (3) Are Very Quite And don't interfear With The Workings or Performace Of Your Laptop Good Luck Russ p/s: You Should Also Get a Can of compressed Air To Blow Out Your Keyboard and Cooling Fans.

That suggestion is good, but can get costly over time, not to mention it's just plain inconvenient. But, any compressed air is cooled significantly when released or decompressed. It goes the other way, too, though: any air that is compressed will rise in temperature a good deal. One would have to compress air, store it until it cools to room temperature, and then use it; compressing it and then immediately releasing it would do nothing more than blow room temperature air around. I do think you're onto something here. If anyone has any suggestions for practical compressed-gas solutions, let me know! I'd love to hear them, keep this thread going!

My iBook G4 was constantly overheating and could actually burn me if I attempted to use it on my lap! The internal fan would go on several times a day if I used it on a table top. I purchased a Targus Chillmat and although I can't say it's the finest quality piece of gear, it definitely does the job in keeping the iBook from overheating as it had been. It's cheap and well worth the small investment.
