hi, just got this ibook 12&quot; in the mail been to a mac shop before i bought it where the owner was told the screen had died.
motherboard was said to be ok by the repairer i replaced the screen with a know working one and the screen was dead.
then after the fiddle of pulling it apart again wondered if i could use the hard drive on another ibook.
the hard drive i put in another ibook which loaded up fine with display.
later i tried again but it was a dead screen?
*is it that both ibooks have faulty motherboards?
motherboard determines a display?
or could it be the display module ?
what else could cause dead screen?
cables good.
cheers cas
