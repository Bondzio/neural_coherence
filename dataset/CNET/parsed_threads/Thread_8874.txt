<s> I am haivng a problem with my DVD +RW burner. </s>
<s> It is Rosewell with a firmwire of A060 wrotes at 48x ect. </s>
<s> My system is a general off the shelf systme form compusa running windows XP using an AMD Athalon 2600+ w/ 512 meg of Ram and an ATI x800 pro video card but here is my problem. </s>
<s> THis is my first &quot;install it yourself&quot; job and I cannot find the drivers for this thing. </s>
<s> When ever I pop in a DVD it suddenly thinks it is a CD drive not a DVD drive. </s>
<s> I have the correct firmwire (as far as I know) but am not sure aobut the drivers or why the Drive is having self esteem problems when I give it a DVD to read. </s>
<s> It will read audio CDs fine and data CDs are slower than in my CD combo drive. </s>
<s> Anyone have a solution to my DVD drive woes? </s>
<s> The DVD functions are not native to all Windows versions. </s>
<s> You only get DVD playback when you run DVD player software and recording when you run recording software. </s>
<s> The ID of CD, DVD and such is a cosmetic issue that Microsoft doesn't seem to have fixed yet. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
<s> If your DVD came with some install CD, etc. </s>
<s> then use it. </s>
<s> It should contain any drivers PLUS!, the DVD player s/w. </s>
<s> If none, then goto the support website of Rosewell products, you should at least get thier latest device drivers for that model DVD. </s>
<s> While WMP(win. </s>
<s> media player) will play DVDs, it isn't always the default player, if not then select it as the pgm. </s>
<s> to do so, if it never did, then something is amiss. </s>
<s> Get a free version of some media player for DVDs. </s>
<s> I tried VLC from: http://www.videolan.org with success. </s>
<s> Offhand, I think you got a s/w issue for now. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
