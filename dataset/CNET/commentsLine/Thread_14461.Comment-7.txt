as i bought the board new a few years back.
i have the manuals and stuff so specs are avialable and state that this board with via chipset kt333 supports pc1600/pc2100/pc2700 ddr.right now it is running fat and sassy with 1gb of pc3200.
how is that happening and will it cause any harm in the long run?
if not, i'll buy another stick of pc3200.
