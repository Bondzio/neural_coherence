<s> I have a Sony DRU-720A DVD/CD rewritable drive and I want to attach it to a P5AD2-E Deluxe via ATAPI (EIDE). </s>
<s> Can I use the PRI_RAID1 on the ASUS Mobo?? </s>
<s> How should the BIOS setings be configured? </s>
<s> Typically, RAID controllers do not support ATAPI devices. </s>
<s> I have 3 ASUS boards but not your model and mine all have RAID 0 and 1 capabilities. </s>
<s> These controllers can be configured as regular IDE for HDs but not ATAPI devices. </s>
<s> Your board should have come with a manual. </s>
<s> If not, the ASUS web site is good about having these available on line so you can double check but I would say the answer is &quot;no&quot;. </s>
<s> Nope, that's not the primary purpose of the raid connectors. </s>
<s> You have to use the either the primary/secondary EIDE ports, not the raid ports. </s>
<s> Unless, it is configuarble, then maybe and that's a big maybe. </s>
<s> Your bios setting should explained in the manual or support website thier usage of all IDE ports. </s>
<s> If you have 4 ide devices already installed, then consider what has to be swapped or gone in order to use your new drive. </s>
<s> If you have small HDs, now is the time for a larger HD to complish the same mbs is not more. </s>
<s> sorry... tada -----Willy </s>
