Hi, I have a desktop pc with a maxtor SATA which holds my OS etc. I have an old hard drive with some important video's on that a need to transfer onto my pc. It's an IDE. I have connected it to the IDE cable that currently runs my DVD rom, I have also plugged the power cable in. Here's the problem, it doesn't show up in the BIOS. I have tried setting the jumper to Primary & Slave but still no luck.. still the BIOS shows the DVDR as primary IDE and when I enter secondary IDE there's nothing there. Any suggestions? J
