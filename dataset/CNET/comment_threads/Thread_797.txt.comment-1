I Have a hardwired local area network.
It consest of modem to rounter to switch to another switch.
My wife got a new laptop with wireless card.
She wants a wireless conection.
How can I come off of my switch to turn one port into wireless?
I looked for a wireless switch can find nothing but commercial stuff.
I was under the impression that if you added a router it would confuse the other router up stream or vise versa.
ANY IDEAS WOULD BE GREAT!!
THANKS
