to run at 400 mhz fsb you need ddrsdram [ddr 200].
are you sure what the 100 mhz report really means.
the ddr 200 is actually 100 mhz memory that gets double clocked.
[=200], then gets quad clocked as the fsb from the mch to the cpu [=400].
then, of course, the multiplier in the cpu multiplies that up to run the cpu at its rated speed.
what speed is the cpu reporting.
if you were not actually acheiving the 400 mhz fsb the cpu would be running less than 1.4 ghz.
i don't think that ddr came any less than 100 mhz, so think that it simply the reporting scheme being confusing.
now there were some mobos that would take either sdram or ddrsdram [different physical sockets] and could not be mixed.
if perchance you are running with pc 100 sdram that would actually be only 100 mhz.
many bioses will give the basic memory speed [100 mhz in this case] as the setting to get the 400 mhz fsb.
it varies by mobo/bioses.
do you have the manual???
?
