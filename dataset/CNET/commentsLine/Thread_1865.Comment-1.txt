i just finished putting together my dream computer.
i turn it on, and everything lights up for a fraction of a second, and goes off.
i do this a few times, and finally it stays on - but there's no display from the video card.
it seems random whether or not the system will have short, &quot;false starts&quot;, or stay on (again, with no functionality or display).
i've tried removing everything and reseating everything.
is this likely a power supply problem?
or the cpu?
two separate problems?
(i'm paranoid about cpu damage - i feel like i had to press it down pretty hard on it, both when i locked the bracket and when i mounted the heatsink.
it's a socket 775 with the pins on the socket, not the chip)
