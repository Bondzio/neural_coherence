<s> I have a Logitech MX700 that used to work in the past but now when I put it in the charger base station the light flashes red. </s>
<s> It's supposed to be solid green. </s>
<s> The mouse doesn't work. </s>
<s> I have tried cleaning the gold contacts but so far that hasn't worked. </s>
<s> usually means battery failure. </s>
<s> What place has the best prices on batteries for a mouse like this? </s>
<s> I also might try adjusting the metal coils inside the case so that there is a tighter fit with the batteries' contacts. </s>
<s> Also I might clean the gold contacts with a little dab of vinegar on a cotton swab. </s>
