9551	0	246720	2481338	NR	PackRuss	5/8/07 8:02 AM	1.17861132E12	Wireless 802.11n Standard & MIMO	Hello, My company wants to get me a new router for work at home usage, but I am confused on what I should get now. I currently have Belkin router and Belkin cards at home, but all in the old .11b standard. I see now MIMO is out and highly praised, but also listed as to be cautious due to the new .11n that will be implemented; a question of whether the MIMO will be obsolete if not used as the new .11n standard? Does anyone know what is going on with the new standard, MIMO, should I hold off getting a new router at this time? -thanks, Russ

Since N seems to be in the wings of 2008, 9 or later I didn't worry about it. So for cheap I updated my router. As to mimo, I thought this was just a way to use multiple antennas and not a standard.
