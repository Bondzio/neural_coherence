1.1.3	I connect it to my laptop or desktop - i tried different USBs and machine and different operating systems ( xp & vista ) but no result .	St
1.1.4	It shows in the tray bar that i have an external connected , it shows in the device manager inside the & quot ; disk drives & quot ; a & quot ; WD & quot ; icon but with no specifications so i ca n't see it in my computer neither in computer management -- - & gt ; disk management ! !	St

1.2.2	Essentially , an external drive has 2 parts : 1 .	St

1.2.6	Could very well be .	Polite
1.2.7	If it does n't , buy a new drive also .	St
