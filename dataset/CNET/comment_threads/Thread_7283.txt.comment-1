Last night, I turned the computer on but did not login, this morrning, I heard the computer making weird noises, and became extremely slow.
So I was not sure what was wrong, and decided to turn the computer off and restart.
But I was not able to start Windows XP, not even Safe Mode in Command Prompt.
Does anyone know what could possbily be wrong with this computer?
