SCSI Drive or SCSI (host)-to-USB Adapter Needed	I have an industrial application (measurement instrument) which has a SCSI-2 connector (HD-50 male) which is used to connect to an external SCSI drive. Since the external SCSI drive we used is no longer available, I need to find either: (a) An external drive that has a SCSI-2 interface (or one which I can adapt to), or (b) A SCSI-2 to USB converter to allow the use of a USB drive or stick. For (a), I have not been able to find anything other than SCSI drives which have VHDCI connectors, which I'm told cannot be adapted to a 50-pin SCSI-2 interface. Is this correct? For (b), all I can find are adapters which treat SCSI as the peripheral, not the host (i.e. the host is our instrument with the SCSI interface, and the peripheral would be a USB device). Any suggestions for either solution? No, we cannot re-design our product to use a different bus architecture (too costly, and the product is going EOL shortly). Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Some companies insist on new parts but as such fall out of production you have to get the used parts. You are right about the lack of new hardware or adapter. Bob

I did find an internal SCSI drive from Adtron which uses Compact Flash media ( http://www.adtron.com/products/Sdds.html ), but I need an external drive. I looked for a drive enclosure for SCSI, but all are either IDE, USB or SATA. The SCSI drive enclosures I saw were not the right form factor ... bummer.

Try this. http://www.bitmicro.com/products_edisk_25_scsin.php (solid state drives) http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1418305&CatId=135 Your average 80 pin scsi drive.

I forgot to mention that to replace that 25 pin boxed SCSI drive you'll likely have to piecemeal a solution from a few makers. I'd look to GRANITE for their adapters from 50 or 68 pin SCSI drives I see for sale all over (Newegg.com has those drives) to the 25 pin outlet. You'll either find a new drive housing or modify one to get over your last run. You can finish this but I doubt you will find NIB ready to use 25 pin SCSI drive in a box like we did 10 years ago. This is going to be not so much fun but is par for the course as old technology exits. Bob
