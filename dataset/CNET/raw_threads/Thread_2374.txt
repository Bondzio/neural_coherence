The 1TB Buffalo LinkStation Quad has 4 250GB WD Caviar Blue internal drives. I am looking to upgrade this to a 4TB NAS and have a few questions. I would appreicate any help from anyone who may have already done this. 1 - Does anyone know what vendor's drive that Buffalo uses in the 4TB system? They package the drive as a OP-HD1.0T 1TB model. Their price is way too expensive. Does anyone know if they use the WD 1TB Caviar Black configuration? Does it make any difference? 2 - Currently the Linkstation Quad is marketed as a 4TB solution. Does anyone know if the Quad will support internal drives greater that 1 TB? 3- When I do the upgrade I plan on replacing one disk at a time and let the RAID 5 system rebuild the drives. Does anyone know of any other methods...

For performance reasons, most consumer pre-configured NASs run disk-based OS and it's not easy to expand an Ext2 or Ext3 partition then boot successfully.

Intel G31 or Nvidia GF7100 with hi-freq Pentium 4) and XPH or XPP, if domain, and build a Win file server. You'll be happier.
