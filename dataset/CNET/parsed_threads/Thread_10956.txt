<s> How come I can't connect to my router automatically through Vista Home Basic? </s>
<s> I've included the MAC address into the router so by right everytime i turn on my laptop it should be able to connect to the router straight away right? </s>
<s> I need to manually connect to the router by typing the SSID and the Passphrase everytime i want to connect to the router..Can anybody help me with this? </s>
<s> By the way I'm using WPA-PSK security and my SSID is set to be hidden so that is why i have to include my MAC address..Thanx=) </s>
<s> Since there is no added security by doing that and it breaks some drivers why do that? </s>
<s> Here's The Real Deal podcast and they give the SSID a failing grade as a security measure. </s>

<s> Hey..thanx alot for the advise..I thought it would be an added security by hidding the SSID..I guess there's not much of a point in hiding it if it's gonna give me problem..Thanx again=) </s>
<s> Recently we got a spat of compromised and failing networks which I got real lucky to find out the cause. </s>
<s> It's a new version of a WEP crack tool. </s>
<s> Full story (?) </s>
