hello guys, i have a question.
i'm currently buying a new pc and i would like to know which of the two options gives me more performance.
a single 750gb 7200 rpm speed, sata 3gb/s hard drive or two 320gb 7200 rpm speed, sata hard drives in raid 0. there is no specification for the 320gb drive, so i'm assuming its 1.5gb/s.
which of the two options will give me a better performance?
or will there be barely any difference?
thanks!
