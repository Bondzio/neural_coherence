for video editing you will need a computer with a lot of memory, at least 500gb (i would recommend a 1tb {terrabyte} hard drive).
a fast processor (a 2ghz+ at the minimum), graphics card, optical drive with write capability and some expansion slots for future upgrades.
you can get one for under $1,000 but you will find that quality desktops capable of editing large movies will run over your budget.
you don't have much computing expierience...are you comfortable attempting digital editing?
