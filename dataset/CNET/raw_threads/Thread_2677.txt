I have a netbook so I do have the portability a college student needs, but I would love a desk top that I can work on with a bigger screen, regular sized key board ect! I just have no idea how much RAM I need or what is fastest or most effecient. I've read on and on but can't make any sense of the lingo! Help me out and tell me/show me the way to a new desktop capable of video, some games, but mostly music, internet, and other college computing. Thanks a million guys!

I looked at one that came to $921.19 that has everything you would need and then some. XPS 8300 I5-2400 3.1 GHz processor which the new Intel 2nd generation CPU. Windows 7 Home Premium. 8 GIG DDR3 Ram. 21.5 inch monitor. If you wanted a bigger monitor, add another $39.00 for a 23 Inch. ATI Radeon 5670 Graphics card. 1 TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive. That is also with a 2 year warranty. That actually maybe a little overkill for what you are doing, but it's best to stay ahead of the game.
