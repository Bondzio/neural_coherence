1.1.1	Hi , My old powerbook G3 wo n't start , there 's not even that familiar start-up sound , just a tiny tiny zzzzzzz from inside .	St
1.1.2	Sometimes not even that .	St
1.1.3	On recommendation , I did buy a new battery and also tried to reset the computer , which did n't help at all .	St
1.1.4	Since that , I bought a new iBook , but it 's a shame that my favorite computer , that used to be a very good computer , just is gathering dust in my cupboard .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas what could be wrong with my old friend ?	Ques
1.1.6	/Jimmy A	St
1.2.1	It 's a Powerbook G3 with firewire and OSX 10.1 /J	St
1.3.1	The tiny zzzzz sond from inside does not sound too good .	St
1.3.2	It 's possibly the powerboard that is the culprit here or even the PMU board .	St
1.3.3	I if resetting the PMU via the keyboard or the reset button failed to do the trick , try this .	Sug
1.3.4	Remove the battery , plug in the power adapter , reset the PMU and try to fire it up .	St
1.3.5	If you still get the zzzz sound , I fear you may have to accept that your old friend has departed but could be resurrected for a , quite large , chunk of change .	St
1.3.6	P	St
1.4.1	ok , i tried it .	St
1.4.2	Do not get any sound at all , just this tiny zzz sound , which is so tiny that I might be imagining it .	St
1.4.3	Perhaps I shoud try to sell it as spare parts .	St
1.4.4	Its organs might make someone elses PB live longer .	St
1.4.5	Thanks !	St
