1.1.3	Can anyone give me some advice .	Ques
1.1.4	I am looking for something a little sleek but not too flashy .	St
1.1.5	I want s cool case that does a great job holding my hardware not one that puts on a light show .	St
1.1.6	Prferably black but open to other designs .	St
1.1.7	I am planing on building a : Processor : intel 2 quad Mobo : ASUS P5B Premium Vista Edition LGA 775 Intel P965 Express ATX PS : COOLMAX & quot ; SLI & quot ; CXI-600B ATX v2.01 600W Power Supply Vid card : ASUS EN8800GTS/HTDP/320M GeForce 8800GTS 320MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 HDCP Ram : Kingston ValueRAM 2GB ( 2 x 1GB ) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 ( PC2 6400 ) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Model KVR800D2N5K2/2G HDD : Western Digital Caviar SE16 WD4000AAKS 400GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s media drive : LITE-ON 20X DVDR DVD Burner with LightScribe Black SATA Model LH-20A1L-05 - OEM Any ideas ?

1.2.1	I just purchased a Thermaltake Soprano DX .	St
1.2.2	I wanted many of the same features you mentioned .	St
1.2.3	This seemed to be the case for me .	St
1.2.4	Not too flashy with all the lights , but subtle lighting and a sleek piano black finish .	St
1.2.5	Plenty of room for a big board and all your stuff .	St
1.2.6	$ 119 at TigerDirect.com .	St
1.2.7	I have not even used it yet .	St
1.2.8	I 'm waiting for all my components to arrive before I actually open it up and install everything .	St
1.2.9	I know it has removable drive bays , but as for side-loading drives , I do n't think so .	St
1.2.10	My Ultra 700-W power supply actually came with an included Ultra Grid case , which also looks very cool AND has side-loading drive bays .	St
1.2.11	I 'm very tempted to use it .	St
1.2.12	It 's actually very slick , not flashy , but just refined and simple .	St
1.2.13	All these are available at TigerDirect.com .	St
1.3.1	Newegg One that I have used many times .	St
1.3.2	Included with case are 2/60mm fans to blow on the expansion cards , 1/rear 80mm fan for exhaust , add 1/120mm to the front of the case for hdd cooling and a 80mm to exhaust the top of the case .	St
1.3.3	Clear side so I do not have to disassemble the system to check for dust and grime .	St
1.3.4	The largest draw back to this case is the way the front of the case moves out and down to remove .	St
1.3.5	If the optical device is installed in the top drive bay it can not be push back far enough due to the top exhaust fan to remove to front cover due to this out and down movement .	St
1.3.6	To remove the top fan the power supply has to be removed .	St
1.3.7	So on assembly I do not use the top drive bay .	St
1.3.8	I 've also found a power supply with a large belly fan conflicts with the rear fan , so look into a fan w/o a belly fan .	St
1.3.9	Do not expect a solid feeling case as you will with the $ 100.00+ cases .	St
1.3.10	I prefer to cut costs at the case leaving more for the important components .	St
