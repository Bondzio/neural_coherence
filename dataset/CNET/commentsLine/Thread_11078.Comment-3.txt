for the nvidia geforce 6600gt either in pcie or agp versions and you will see it needs more than a 250w power supply.
also in agp versions of the 6600gt they normally furnish a cable to connect additional power to the power supply.
i just bought and installed a new 420w power supply in my pc with thoughts of a 6600gt agp card pretty soon.
don't have a dell, but toni h. is right on....some dell's especially the old ones need special power supply and also special fitting, and some don't.
