sorry for not getting back soon enough.
have so many forum post on this matter & can't keep up with all of them.
i installed a refurbished asus board which i would rather had installed a oem board but at least its up & going now.
the only problem with this asus board is it has no sound from the rear ports so i had to install a 3rd party software program to get some sound.
planning on when i have the funds replacing this board with a oem board & put this one in a white box i have lying around for future building.
the emachine d2346 is runing fine for now but put it aside till i can get another board.
problem resolved & thanks for all you comments & tips & support on this issue.
