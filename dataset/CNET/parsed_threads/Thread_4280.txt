<s> So after 6 years of ownership of a now sluggish and ancient Dell Dimension e520, I've decided it's easier to run a clean install of Vista to boost performance rather than bother with uninstalling programs, etc. </s>
<s> My question is, should I still use the 250 gb Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 hard drive that came with the system? </s>
<s> Or am I rolling the dice by doing a fresh install on a drive that old? </s>
<s> I bought a new WD 1TB 7200 Caviar Blue to add as a 2nd drive for storage, but now I'm wondering if I should use it instead as my primary drive and use the 6-year-old drive for extra storage. </s>
<s> What do you all think? </s>
<s> If you had no real issue with your old HD, then do as you plan, use *it* as extra storage. </s>
<s> Using the new HD, install it using the s/w that came with it or the support website of s/w you get free. </s>
<s> That way, you can swap data over from old-&gt;new HD and needn't do a fresh install. </s>
<s> Of course, you can skip that and do a fresh install, then use only the new HD. </s>
<s> Just run it for several weeks and decide if you want to add the old HD. </s>
<s> However, if you get an ext. </s>
<s> USB case that accepts that old HD, you can go that route. </s>
<s> The whole idea of swapping data from old to new, is you will need to get all the updates, etc., to complete the install if a freshly done one, but that's up to you. </s>
<s> Your new HD guide or manual to include any visit to support website should provide details on all this. </s>
<s> I tend to install data to new HD alone and run it for awhile, maybe a month or more. </s>
<s> keeping the old HD as a safeguard of data stored in a safe place. </s>
<s> That way should it boo-boo, you have your old HD to fall back on on that date. </s>
<s> Again, that's all up to you. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> That's solid advice--thanks for your help! </s>
