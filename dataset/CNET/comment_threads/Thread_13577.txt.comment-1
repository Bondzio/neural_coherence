We have 3 computers networked via cable modem.
Two desktops, one laptop.
The laptop has lost browser capability, and I'm not able to find what the problem is.
I've run Norton, Adaware, No-Adware, and done a System Restore.
Nothing is working...
Does anyone have any idea's on what may have caused this and how to fix it?
I'll appreciate your input.
Thanx
