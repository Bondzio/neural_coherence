possibly a big but... We don't know what your computer is.
For example mine is a &quot;Tools free&quot; Desktop tower from Alienware.
Tools free means all I have to do is shutdown, disconnect the power, remove the side panel, discharge myself of static, then unclip a couple of connections and pull the drive tray out.
What makes it easier is that the drives are all SATA conventional and no SSDs to confuse the issue.
What computer is yours?
