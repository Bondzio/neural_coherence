<s> I have an eMachine t3882 and it can be slow at times. </s>
<s> It has a Celeron D 2.8Ghz processor with socket 478. </s>
<s> I upgraded the RAM to just one ram stick of 1 GB. </s>
<s> It boots up fast and everything but loading after login takes a long time. </s>
<s> For example, to launch IE7 it can take up to 30secs sometimes maybe even more time. </s>
<s> I have a gift card to Amazon which I would like to use for upgrade this PC. </s>
<s> But I do not know if it is worth spending money on it. </s>
<s> What do you guys suggest? </s>
<s> If it is worth while to upgrade it, what better processor and new CPU fan would you recommend? </s>
<s> I currently have the stock CPU fan which can get pretty loud. </s>
<s> I was also thinking of adding another 1GB stick of ram Thanks </s>
<s> this has all the specs on the stock machine just in case http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/emachines-t3882/4507-3118_7-31341179.html?tag=mncol;psum </s>
<s> Well, your processor basically is awful. </s>
<s> NEVER buy a celeron They are junk. </s>
<s> I have never seen a computer with a celeron run well. </s>
<s> The celerons are rejects of the core 2 duos. </s>
<s> You may as well just get a new computer because it will be a pain to upgrade just the processor there are basically no processors that go in that socket any more its to old. </s>
<s> Sorry, I got it wrong, you have a single core but they are still rejects. </s>
<s> Yes you can upgrade that machine. </s>
<s> And for much cheaper then buying a new computer. </s>
<s> It won't run as fast as a new comp. </s>
<s> (obviously), but will still run faster then what you have. </s>
<s> First buy one more 1GB stick of RAM (that PC can have a max of 2GB and you might as well max it out). </s>
<s> Secondly, upgrade your processor to a Pentium 4 (you can probably find one online for $40 bucks). </s>
<s> That should do it. </s>
<s> If you have any questions about your processor compatibility here's check this link out -- http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d865gvhz/sb/CS-026964.htm (but all Pentium 4s look to be compatible with a celeron D chipset. </s>
