i need to know the signs of a failing power supply.
my computer is constantly crashing and locks up, then reboots.
the power supply is running hot most of the time (the fan is working) it crashes and reboots the same way with windows xp, windows 98se and windows me.
the ram tested ok.(512mb ddr).
the hdd tested ok no errors.
i have 2 additional exhaust fans installed.
internal system temp is 78f cpu temp is 115f.
i shut this computer down and borrowed another computer to use in the mean time.
i don't want to risk destroying the motherboard with the power supply shorting out.
i haven't taken it in for testing yet, but should i consider replacing the power supply anyway?
thanks in advance.
