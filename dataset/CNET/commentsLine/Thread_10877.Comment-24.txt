in my separate post i shared my experience with ocz drives.
one driver keeps going and going after over 3 years, while another model had failure after failure till i quit using ocz and switched to samsung.
obviously, ocz does have some good drives as exemplified by my own experience with the first drive.
i did get a seagate 500gb hybrid drive along the way.
the speed of the drive was rather disapointing if you expect it to be similar to an ssd.
however, it does perform rather nicely for a 2.5 inch hard drive.
have had no problems at all with the seagate hybrid.
in my setup, i have a samsung 830 128gb ssd as the system drive.
the seagate 500gb hybrid is used for data storage, and a 1.5tb 3.5 inch wd black hd is used for archival type storage.
all of my documents (the mydocuments folder) are located on the seagate drive.
only program files and system are on the ssd.
hope this is of some use to those contemplating going to at ssd - i recommend doing so despite my early bad experience.
