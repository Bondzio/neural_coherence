<s> Am looking at upgrading my own system. </s>
<s> SO I have heard that the motherboard ASUS was one of the best out there. </s>
<s> So, what is the difference between the A8N Deluxe and the A8N Premium? </s>
<s> TigerDirect has a side by side comparison and it looks like you get more bang for your buck with the Deluxe. </s>
<s> But the Deluxe is cheaper so I must be missing something. </s>
<s> Premium has heat pipe cooling for mosfets and northbridge. </s>
<s> Premium has 1 PCI-e x4 and 1 PCI-e x1 slot. </s>
<s> Deluxe has 2 PCI-e x1 slots. </s>
<s> Premium *may* overclock a bit more and/or be more stable due to heat pipe cooling. </s>
