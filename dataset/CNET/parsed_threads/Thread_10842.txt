<s> I got a new laptop and surprise, surprise, the speakers are terrible. </s>
<s> I like to listen to music while I work, so can I buy a $50-$60 2.1 Desktop speaker set and just plug the audio cord into the headphone jack of my laptop, before I buy some $80-$100 portable notebook speakers (probably the Altec Lansing XT1's) </s>
<s> powered. </s>
<s> They'll plug into the sound jack on the laptop. </s>
<s> Your choice on how much money to spend. </s>
<s> I have all of Jimmy Buffett's CDs on my laptop, and a twenty buck set of speakers (powered, of course). </s>
<s> Sounds awesome. </s>
<s> Thanks Ok, I dont need self powered ones. </s>
<s> The speakers will stay at my desk plugged in. </s>
<s> I just wondered if the audio cord on desktop speakers works if placed in the headphone jack on a laptop, since i don't have the typical audio inputs on my laptop. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I just caught your statement that you don't need self-powered speakers. </s>
<s> The speakers have to be powered from from somewhere (takes energy to produce sound). </s>
<s> It will either come from the headphone connection, from a wall outlet to the speakers, or batteries in the speakers. </s>
<s> You need self-powered (wall outlet or battery) speakers because the headphone port does not provide enough juice to power standard external speakers. </s>
<s> Laptops don't have an amp. </s>
<s> There's enough power for headphones, but not speakers. </s>
<s> Get a set with a power supply and plug the jack into the headphone jack. </s>
