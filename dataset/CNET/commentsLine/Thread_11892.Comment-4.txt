here you already have it setup to access and basically got storage present.
if you don't like xp because it seems a resource hog, then find some linux os you can live with and use that as storage.
you problem isn't storage as your 1st ?
posed but rather with xp.
you probably could be better served using some ext.
usb case with hd and just deal with it as an extension of your current main system rather than a network.
using a nas(purchase) setup would be more open to a network storage and any system that has access to it.
the last option, would be to keep your laptop xp os and add/replace with a larger hd to increase storage itself.
