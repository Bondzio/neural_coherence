<s> my nephew here was playing with kitchen magnets. </s>
<s> found it funny on the 'puter screen (viewsonic p95f+, excellent). </s>
<s> now there are like shadowsat certain points and i've degaussed sev. </s>

<s> look like smoke. </s>
<s> any cheap and easy way of fixing this? </s>

<s> Visit a few local tv repair shops. </s>
<s> When you find one with an old gray headed tech explain your problem. </s>
<s> He'll know what your talking about. </s>
<s> It may take a little time for him to locate his vintage degauss coil but that should work. </s>
<s> He got a lot of practice with it back in the 60's. </s>

<s> Had it happen here with one of those high strength neodynium magnets and a 27 inch tv set. </s>
<s> I had a tape head demagnetiser which managed to knock most of the magnetic field out of the mask after quite a few passes. </s>
<s> They're pretty weak when it comes to degaussing something like this, but after a month, the built in degaussing coil finally cleared the residual magnetism. </s>
<s> Since I no longer do TV repairs, I don't have my trusty deguassing coil. </s>
<s> Instead I (carefully) use my soldering gun. </s>
<s> The transformer part makes a good geguassing coil. </s>
<s> Just don't burn anything with the tip! </s>
<s> I know both my crt's including a 10 year old princeton have an automatic demagnetizing function that can be activated from it's control menu. </s>
<s> Or my newer samsung I think does it automatically every power on. </s>
<s> Don't know if yours can but might be easier than taking apart and degaussing. </s>
