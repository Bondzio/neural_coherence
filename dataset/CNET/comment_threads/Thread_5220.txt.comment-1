I have been working with layouts in Word and doing some simple graphic design with MS Publisher and Adobe Photoshop elements on a Dell laptop.
I now want to move on to Adobe InDesign CS and Photoshop full version and plan to buy a desktop with 2 monitors.
Everything I read about graphic cards has to do with video that I have no interest in.
Can anyone recommend specs for a good graphic card, RAM size (1Gb enough?
), and monitor size and specs for this type of application?
Money is no object but I don't want to do an overkill either as everything will inevitably be obsolete faster than I can amortize it!
Thanks.
