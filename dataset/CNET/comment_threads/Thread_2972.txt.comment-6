For devices to work with a motherboard, sometimes you need to install the motherboard drivers first.
Microsoft does NOT install all needed drivers and the Driver Update button is little more than a demo of how good things could be.
Just wondering.
Since Windows 98 has been around for 7+ years, how could we avoid learning about the drivers?
