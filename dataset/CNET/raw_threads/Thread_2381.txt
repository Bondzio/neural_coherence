I have a SMC2804WBR 2.4GHz 54Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL Broadband Router that apparently is not powerful enough to broadcast the wireless signals through the walls in my house and would appreciate any advice / recommendatiosn / suggestions / ...., that will allow me to wirelessily connect 2 WindowsXp PCs that are about 150 feet from each other but with several rooms and maybe 10 walls, between computer &quot;A&quot; and computer &quot;B&quot;? Thanks, Bob

Try using some AC Powerline pairs such as http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1166859566539&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper Now put a wifi router at the other end and viola. Bob

All that would be required is a power outlet once the initial configuration is setup in the range extender.
