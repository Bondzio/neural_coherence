1.1.1	I 'm switching to a Mac from a PC and have been trying to decide which model to get .	St
1.1.2	For a number of reasons , rational and emotional , I 've settled on the iMac G5 .	St
1.1.3	I was wondering about the various configurations and this question seems at least a little relevant .	St
1.1.4	If you ( the collective you ) had the choice between a 20 & quot ; display with 1GB of memory or a 17 & quot ; display with 1.5GB , which side of the equation would you come down on ?	Ques
1.1.5	( I think I 've officially entered the nit-picky phase of selection ) .	St
1.1.6	Thanks , Jay	St
1.2.1	Here 's why .	St
1.2.2	I can add RAM later .	St
1.2.3	I ca n't add 3 inches to the display .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I think this is a no-contest .	St
1.3.2	As Bob rightly pointed out , adding 3 & quot ; to an LCD is not possible .	St
1.3.3	Adding RAM is easy .	St
1.3.4	P	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the replies .	St
1.4.2	They make sense and seem obvious in retrospect ( one of those ''why did n't I think of that '' moments ) .	St
1.4.3	The original question arose because a colleague at the university where I work said Macs are ''memory intensive '' .	St
1.4.4	So after looking at the 17 '' iMac on display at the campus store , I was ready to order one with 1.5 or 2 gigs of memory .	St
1.4.5	Then I made the mistake of visiting a real Apple store and seeing one with a 20 '' monitor and I realized I probably ca n't afford a big monitor plus 2 gigs of ram .	St
1.4.6	This put me in a tizzy and resulted in my wondering whether I should invest in big memory or big display .	St
1.4.7	Do Macs need a large amount of memory ?	Ques
1.4.8	Is one gig enough for a MacIntosh that will be used for standard web duties , some video and photo editing , and the preparation of lectures with Powerpoint ?	Ques
1.4.9	I 'm sorry if I seem obsessive .	Polite
1.4.10	Its just that this is my first foray into Macs and I would like to get it at least semi-right .	St
1.4.11	I also apologize if this submission appears twice .	St
1.4.12	I sent it from my office but it had n't appeared as of this evening so I tried again .	St
1.4.13	Thanks once more , Jay	St
1.5.1	Your choice of Mac with a Gig of RAM will do everything you ask of it .	St
1.5.2	Having said that , you can never have too much RAM but , for right now and the job description , you are set .	St
1.5.3	go get it and enjoy it P	Sug
1.6.1	I 'm convinced .	St
1.6.2	Should I order the wireless keyboard and mouse or stick with the default wired units ?	Ques
1.6.3	I 've read that some do n't like Apple 's mouse and use aftermarket products .	St
1.6.4	I 'm still not sure about the difference between Bluetooth and wireless but is a Bluetooth enabled keyboard and mouse worthwhile technology ?	Ques
1.6.5	I 'll probably install Virex if only to keep from transmitting viruses with email .	St
1.6.6	Do I need to use an antispyware program periodically ?	Ques
1.6.7	I presently spend the first 15 minutes of my day clearing spyware that Counterspy detects on my PC .	St
1.6.8	Thanks again .	St
1.6.9	Jay	St
1.7.1	Bluetooth is a short range wireless signal , usually for input devices like the keyboard , mouse , headsets , joysticks and some printers .	St
1.7.2	It 's pretty neat .	Polite
1.7.3	By ordering it built into your system , you will not have to take up a USB port should you decide to go with it in the future .	St
1.7.4	The Apple Mouse has only one button , as source of much discussion in the Mac world , but OS X has built in support for a two button mouse , including a third party bluetooth one .	St
1.7.5	I know of no Anti-Spyware programs for the Mac , I 'm sure there are some out there , but Spyware and Malware are not currently a problem on the Mac .	St
1.7.6	The majority of the stuff is aimed at Windows boxes .	St
1.7.7	P	St
1.8.1	I went all the way with iMac : 20 & quot ; screen and 2 gigs of memory .	St
1.8.2	I read on the Apple site that with matched memory sticks & quot ; it will operate with a 128-bit data path & quot ; instead of the 64 one DIMM would support .	St
1.8.3	Sounds good to me .	Polite
1.8.4	I look forward to learning the system and putting all that power to use .	St
1.8.5	Thanks again , Jay	St
1.9.1	I 'm sat here using a mere MacMini with 512Mb Ram and a 20 '' Cinema Display , and for the majority of what I actually do with my machine , it is more than adequate .	St
1.9.2	While it is almost certainly slower and less slick than any G5 based machine , performance feels better than the PC in the other room with a roughly similar spec ( 512Mb , 1.3Mhz CPU ) .	St
1.9.3	Then again , I 've sussed that most of my wife and I 's PC usage is very light , hence going for a Mac Mini rather than something with a top end graphics card .	St
1.9.4	I am not heavily using Photoshop ( and when I do , I am not usually working at photo quality ) , and I have n't started heavily using iMovie , Garageband or iDVD .	St
1.9.5	The first time I hit the constraints of the machine was using Garageband , but I was testing how much I could do before it gave up ( and that was CPU rather than memory ) .	St
1.9.6	SimCity did n't seem to enjoy running at the highest resolution - I 've not done any investigation there , my hunch is that it graphics card as 32Mb is the bare minimum suggested .	St
1.9.7	If you do a lot of Photoshop work or A/V editing , then the more RAM the better .	St
