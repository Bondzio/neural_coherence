I can ping the printer from the one laptop I can get to this morning, and from the desktop.
The other laptop used to be able to print to this printer, the one beside me is a new addition to the house, have not run the printer disc on it as it's a netbook.
Looking for the disc now.
You say to &quot;point them to that printer by IP address&quot; I'm not sure what you mean, could you explain please?
(I'm sort of idiot savant, I get &quot;ping&quot; but not how to point a driver, ok, more like just idiot lol)
