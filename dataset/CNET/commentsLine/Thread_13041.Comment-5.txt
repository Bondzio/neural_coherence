update: i did system restore back to last week wen it still worked, didnt help.
reset bios to default, didnt help.
i dont have recovery cds and my warranty is out too cuz its been almost 2 yrs.. im guessing its a hardware problem too and ive noticed my hard drive overheats sometimes.
@bob: can u elaborate a bit?
who is the &quot;them&quot; you are talking about, do u mean the wireless card?
and wen u say reload the os a dozen times do u mean a dozen restarts/boots?
ive had this laptop for 1 yr 9 months now and this problem never happened before until yesterday wen it suddenly decided to stop working, so im inclined to think it is a hardware problem.. also, wen u say 1 to 6 months, do u mean from the time of purchase wen u start using the laptop or 1 to 6 months after it stops detecting/working that it will cave?
cuz if this keeps up im not waiting 6 months to replace the wireless card ill do it like soon, but is that really necessary at this point?
