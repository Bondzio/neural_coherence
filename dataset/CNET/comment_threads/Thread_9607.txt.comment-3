1) The burned DVD in other PC DVD driver is also changed to the CD drive.
2) There is no problem to burn the DVD by the different pc dvd drive.
My laptop DVD-RW drive still can copy CD and DVD into the hard drive as well as play the DVD but just cannot burn the DVD disc.
After burning (The message displayed &quot;Burn Success'), the burned DVD changed to the CD drive in my computer.
The other PC also read the burned DVD as the CD drive.
Do you know why the burned DVD changed to the CD?
Is the drive problem?
