<s> Hi I have a very small hard drive. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there is an easy way to copy everything from my hard drive to a USB flash drive? </s>
<s> Also,if drive C crashed, could the USB flash drive, which is E, be used as a backup? </s>
<s> Would the computer know it is supposed to boot off of it? </s>
<s> -Stephen </s>
<s> If your flash drive is larger than the HD, you may be able to copy it over but this isn't going to make it bootable or save you from a hard drive failure. </s>
<s> As well, if your HD is NTFS, you may have trouble getting larger files to copy to the flash drive. </s>
<s> These tend to be formatted in FAT32 and you'd need to change that to NTFS. </s>
<s> You'd really only copy your data and not your programs to the flash drive anyway. </s>
<s> They won't run from the flash drive and only take up space unnecessarily. </s>
<s> Thanks Steven First I don't intend to change FAT32 to NTFS since this is above my knowledge level. </s>
<s> I don't have that much data other than about 11Gb of music. </s>
<s> I was hoping that a flash drive was bootable since I just had a serious problem with my computer and this seemed like a simple idea that might work. </s>
<s> So people get a USB hard drive (my guess) and do the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard thing (which I've never done) ??? </s>
<s> Will the computer boot from that if the original hard disk crashed? </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> original hard disk = 40 Gb - Stephen </s>
<s> Lot safer. </s>
<s> You don't need any kind of wizard to transfer data from a hard drive to a flash drive. </s>
<s> The reason I mentioned going with NTFS is only if you have some very large files as FAT32 has something of a 4gb limit and folks who download movies and stuff can have some fairly large files. </s>
<s> If you don't do that, there's no problem. </s>
<s> The flash drive is seen in explorer just like any other drive. </s>
<s> You can select files or entire folder and just copy and paste them from one drive to the other. </s>
<s> As for the flash drive being bootable after that....sorry...nope. </s>
<s> It's possible to make a flash drive bootable to run some utilities but not Windows. </s>
<s> Thanks ahtoi. </s>
<s> Thanks Steven (Yes, explorer sees my 2 Gb flash chip as drive E. I noticed that a while back.) </s>
<s> BUT as I said (not talking about a flash chip now): &quot;So people get a USB hard drive (my guess) and do the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard thing...&quot; I think in a round about way this may have been answered. </s>
<s> (Forget about the flash chip for now.) </s>
<s> If my drive C crashed and I had transfered everything to a USB hard dirve by using the wizard in Windows... would the computer boot up from the USB port with the USB hard drive cabled to it? </s>
<s> It seems you're saying no, and there is no EASY way to create a bootable full disk back up. </s>
<s> Thanks, and sorry about the confusion here. </s>
<s> I hope we're close to the end. </s>
<s> -Stephen </s>
<s> It might be possible to create a compressed drive image on a large enough flash drive that could be restored to a new HD in the event your old one failed. </s>
<s> That's another story but there's no &quot;wizard&quot; that's going transfer your hard drive to a USB flash drive that you can boot from. </s>
<s> Sorry 'bout that. </s>
