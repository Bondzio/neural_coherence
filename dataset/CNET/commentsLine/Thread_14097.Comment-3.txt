you guys need to stay as far away as possible from ironside computers.
see ripoff report web site.
we bought a computer from them and it showed up missing the cooling fan, radiator falling off and missing screws, dvd drive cable never hooked up.
was not able too boot up.
never tested.
we sent the computer back and out of 2500.00 dollars they are refunding 950.00. they charge 20% restocking fees and so on.
there story now is the shipping co damaged it but ironside will not take care of it.
they told the us they would assist us in filing a claim against fedex for there mistakes.
the computer was not finished being built and missing parts that were not in the box.
they said they must have a new tech.
they said they would ship within 2 days.
they shipped 3 weeks later.
ironside computers will put anything in a box and send it to you but there terms and conditions say you have to pay for return shipping and the credit card fees and the restocking fees even if they send you a pos in the mail.
they can mail you a computer from 10 years ago and say its something else because of there terms and agreements.
luckily we are close enough to las vegas where our attorney can file a law suit.
we will be posting it soon.
save your self a lot of grief and buy from a well known company.
