All the laptops can ping to the same router but not the one with TomCat installed on it (Laptop 1). So if I enter &quot; http://192.168.1.100:8080&quot; or &quot; http://192.168.1.100&quot; (if I use Port 80) from the Laptops 2 or 3 I get the &quot;Page cannot be displayed&quot; error. Can anyone please let me know where I'm going wrong or what should be done to display the web pages? The details for my network: Laptop 1: Tomcat installed & running Laptop 2 & 3: other laptops on the network. TOMCAT 6.0.16 (Also tried Apache HTTPD 2.0.63) JAVA SERVER PAGES MS ACCESS LINKSYS WRT54GS ROUTER COMCAST INTERNET TOSHIBA LAPTOPS (3 NOS) WIN XP PRO (SP2) CA eTrust ANTIVIRUS P.S: I'm new to networking.

But of the more than 2 million registered CNet members, a lot of us don't know what &quot;Tomcat&quot; and &quot;Apache&quot; is. Why are you designating ports? Exactly what are you trying to do? Seems to me, setting up the router, setting up networking on the PCs, will give you Internet access. Setting up File and Printer Sharing will enable the same for the three PCs. Am I oversimplyfing or are you trying to do something off the wall?
