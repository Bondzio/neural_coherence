<s> My XP home system just started telling me that it does not detect the hard drive on boot. </s>
<s> I used revovery from the XP install cd and ran chkdsk /p and chkdsk /f and fixmbr and fixboot. </s>
<s> It found errors with the chkdsk /f, but I thought it fixed them. </s>
<s> Still doesn't see drives on boot. </s>
<s> bios setup doesn't see them either. </s>
<s> My question is: Do I need a new hard drive to fix this or is it something else? </s>
<s> Replace the cable and/or try it on another port. </s>
<s> Make sure it spins up. </s>
<s> A poor power connector can cause this. </s>
<s> If it does not show in the BIOS, XP won't see it either so don't bother with XP until until the detection problem is worked out. </s>
<s> help considerably if you gave us a COMPLETE rundown on your system. </s>
<s> First thoughts are that the drive is probably OK but that you may have fallen victum to malware of one sort or another. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Thanks for the info and here are the specs on the computer. </s>
<s> I'm running XP home installed with a clean install using an upgrade from 98se. </s>
<s> It is up to date with SP2 and all of the latest udated from microsoft. </s>
<s> It is a Micron Millenia (Best Buy) P# 733 with 2 hard drives. </s>
<s> I'm running AWIL's avast anti-virus and microsofts anti-spyware. </s>
<s> I just did a chkdsk on the secondary drive and it read unrecoverable. </s>
<s> I unhooked it and the PC started. </s>
<s> Guess I'm back in business. </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> Thanks for the input. </s>
<s> While checking the cable I decided to check the secondary drive. </s>
<s> It reads unrecoverable with chkdsk, so I unplugged it and now the PC boots. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
