I got an retail Memorex 512MB USB flash memory from Staples just under a year ago.
It costed $20 w/o requiring any MIRs.
Came with driver CD, lanyard, and warranty info.
One day, I couldn't find it.
Searched everywhere I could've thought of, but nowhere to be found I got an OEM Memorex 1GB flash mem for $32 back in early April this year from 3bTech.
It's just the module and the protective cap over the plug.
Bought some lanyards from a one-dollar store and strung that up.
As of now, it hasn't failed on me yet.
