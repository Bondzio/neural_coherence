<s> I've currently got a Dell Inspiron 9300. </s>
<s> It's a great computer and all, but the 80GB hard drive is quickly filling up. </s>
<s> Dell set up a partition that alone takes up 10GB, and I've got Windows and Linux running so I've partitioned Linux for another 10. </s>
<s> My question is, are external hard drives capable of properly running programs such as games, at the speed of my regular hard drive? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> While you can install such to said drives, gamers usually hate the speed loss. </s>

<s> When you say gamers hate the speed loss, are you talking about online games and laggyness, or just games in general, single and multiplayer would run slower? </s>
<s> The effects will vary game by game, but the time for a game to load will increase as well the levels. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info Bob. </s>
<s> As long as it's just loading times that will slow down I'm not too concerned. </s>
<s> Now I've got another question. </s>
<s> You wouldn't happen to know of any reliable external hard drive brands would you? </s>
<s> I'm looking for something around 120-160GB. </s>
<s> Thanks Scottie </s>
<s> Ordered cases and drives and put them together ourselves. </s>
<s> Since we pick out cases that look like they don't overheat, we get about as reliable as the drive you stick into the case. </s>
