certain seagate 7200.10 and 7200.11 drives did have a bad rep for failing, but if logic boards from two different vendors are crapping out, it's probably due to a power supply with poor voltage regulation on the +5v or +12v rails.
as for drive reliability, i prefer wd drives and have 4 (2x640gb and 2x250gb) in a home server that's been on 24x7 since early 2008. during the summer, the ambient temp hits a very warm 82c and the drives are just fine.
prior to that i had a 4x250gb setup since mid 2006 so two of those 250gb drives have hit the 4 year mark.
rather than raid-5 a dozen drives together, just mirror (raid-1) two big drives.
