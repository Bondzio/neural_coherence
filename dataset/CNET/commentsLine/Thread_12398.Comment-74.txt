have all of these problems... flaking and scratching off not just on the metallics.
on every kind of paper.
the printer handles the paper well and is pretty easy to clear jams but the worst, aside from the flaking is the color match!
anyone else have completely different screen colors than what prints?
i've tried everything to match it up and did print the phaser color sampler which i can use if i need one specific color but what about a full graphic?
