I've been shopping around for a gaming machine for a few weeks now and I've almost settled on Digital Storm to build my first true gaming rig however the more I look at the benefits of building my own PC the more tempting it becomes. There's a few things holding me back, among them are how to troubleshoot? How to avoid compatability issues. Fear factor (BIOS scares me a little). No tech support. Did I spend my money in the right places? I have a budget of $2000-$2500 for this so I know the savings of building my own will be very significant however that warm fuzzy feeling of warranties and tech support will be gone. I do like that I'll be getting educated as I go but fear the pain and frustration that education may cause (not to mention money) so I guess after all my rambling my question is...Will that education, pain and suffering (assuming Murphy's law is in full effect) end up as a rewarding and satisfactory experience or should I play it safe?

I've built three computers and when/if something goes wrong with them, I enjoy fixing the problem (because I know what is in the computer and how it is put together); and I've had absolutely zero regrets about building my own computer, I'll NEVER go back to a pre-built piece of crap. You just can't get past the quality of a homemade machine (so to speak). With warranties and stuff wherever you buy your components, it should come with its own warranty; and you're your own tech support. I purchase my components at http://www.newegg.com . P.S. Don't worry about BIOS', because you just shouldn't upgrade BIOS', you'll have to build a whole new computer before you'll want to do that.

It is not hard to do, by the time you get done you will be surprised at the result. For 2k (or less) you can build a slick system, far superior to what you can buy retail, unless you spend a ton of money and go to Alienware. Just do it, you will have fun!!! Good luck!!!
