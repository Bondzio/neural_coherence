&quot;The access point is dhcp 'disabled'&quot; At this point I can't help you further.
Such a setup is something not stock for such systems.
Someone made a choice and they'll have to tell you how it's supposed to work that way.
It's my choice to start with stock settings, get it working and then move to other settings.
In closing, my neighbor just a few weeks ago pulled a Windows XP SP2 new laptop out and we just connected just fine.
But we use almost all the stock settings in the router such as DHCP and more.
