<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> I am currently visiting friends out of state and I am trying to connect to their wireless network. </s>
<s> It is security protected butI got thier network key and was able to connect, unfortunately even though I am about 10 feet away from the router it says limited or no connectivity and as such will not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I have tried pinging and it seems to be ok. </s>
<s> I have tried to run the wireless connection repair feature through the Wireless Network Connections Windows thing. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> It has a note about Vista for you. </s>
<s> If you don't have Vista how could I tell if you don't supply details? </s>
