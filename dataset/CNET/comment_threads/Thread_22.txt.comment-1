Hello guys, I need help, i'm buying a new computer for myself and i have a choice of buying a HP XW4100 or HP6000, the difference in price is only $100.
HP XW4100 Specs: 3 GHz Pen 4, 1GB Ram, 80GB HDD, 128MB Vid HP XW6000 Specs: 3.06GHZ Pen XEON, 1 GB RAM, 40GB HDD, 128MB Vid I'm a student, use photoshop at times, like to play games, no heavy video editing... What would you suggest me to buy?
Again the price difference is $100 does it worth it?
What is the main difference in between Pentium 4 and Xeon?
p.s.
i'm a broke college student so 100 bucks does matter.
