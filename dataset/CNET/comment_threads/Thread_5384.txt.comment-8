Just wanted to say thanks for the help...
I got everything set up, the tv looks great.
In case anyone has similar questions, I ended up not using powerstrip at all.
Turns out the updated drivers to the geforce 5200, which I had previously ignored due to s-video problems, made the pc to tv hookup with an hdmi to dvi cable easy as 1, 2, 3.
Final pc configuration (at least for now): 3 Ghz Pentium 1.7 TB HDD (internal and external) 2 GB RAM 42&quot; widescreen hi-def sony &quot;monitor&quot; geforce 5200 graphics card audigy 2 zs audio logitech z-680 surround speakers logitech wireless keyboard/mouse ati video capture card - pci
