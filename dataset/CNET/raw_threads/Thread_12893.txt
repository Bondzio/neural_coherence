I have windows XP and tried using the windows wireless configuration tool and the one that came with the adapter. I also tried using it on our other XP desktops and tried enabling and disabling WEP and nothing has worked. Any ideas? Thanks!

Can you associate but not get an IP address? When in doubt, reset to factory defaults on the router. Test if you have connectivity in an open environment. Then add WEP or WPA-PSk. Most routers these days have the ability to support only G clients for preformance reasons. SKrall

All three can see the network, but only one linksys one will connect. I tried resetting the router and it still doesnt work. according to CNET, this router has great backwords compatibility, which was why we bought it. So when i try to connect to the network, it says 'waiting for network to be ready' for like 30 seconds, then it stops trying, so it doesnt even get an IP address. However, the one linksys adapter that works connects almost instantly. Does that help? Thanks!
