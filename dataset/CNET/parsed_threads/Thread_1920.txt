<s> I have a computer I built. </s>
<s> It has been operating fine for the past two years, however in the last eight months I have gone through 4 power supplies, all of them various brands and from 400 to 600 watt output. </s>
<s> I have a 1.8 Ghz Athlon processor, 1.5 Gig of memory an Asus motherboard, a DVD writer and two 80 Gig hard drives with a video and sound card on the PCI slots. </s>
<s> What happens is there is a loud pop and the power supply burns out. </s>
<s> I took one apart and the fuse inside was blown but after resoldering another fuse in the power supply was still dead. </s>
<s> This has happened four times now in the past seven or eight months. </s>
<s> I have had the electric company check my power and they put a recorder on my line and there have been no voltage fluctuations or spikes. </s>
<s> I just lost another power supply yesterday. </s>
<s> Would appreciate any help or ideas anyone has on this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Perhaps what you have is a load issue. </s>
<s> Plug&gt;&gt;&gt;bad caps&lt;&lt;&lt;into goggle. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I was thinking load issues too which is why I bumped up to the 600 watt power supplies but the one that went out yesterday blew when my computer was in hibernate so I don't think that's it. </s>
<s> I also looked at the bad caps info. </s>
<s> I don't see any of that on my board and don't have any of the symptoms they give either. </s>
<s> According to my motherboard and temp monitoring program my voltages and temps are all well within safe range. </s>
<s> I am mystified. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> A bad caps issue is also found on other devices. </s>
<s> For a PSU to go, it needs a reason. </s>
<s> It appears you haven't found the real reason it went bad. </s>
<s> I suggest you tear down the system and inspect it. </s>
<s> A bad mounting on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and/or chaffed harness, etc. </s>
<s> can be a cause. </s>
<s> You didn't provide details on your system, but if the psu goes, then very possible a device like a CD drive, video card, excessive heat, etc. </s>
<s> is faulty. </s>
<s> You just can't trust *anything* until tested elsewhere. </s>
<s> Afterall, 4 psu going bad suggests that. </s>
<s> Of course, bad AC power is still a possible issue. </s>
<s> A floating ground, poor connections, or reverse wiring can be a home issue. </s>
<s> An AC line tester brought at Radio Smack can see if the wiring is OK. Also, if not already a surge protector of decent quality can help. </s>
<s> If you have one, understand it works usually only ONCE when a true power hit/surge, thus look for a LED type telltale showing its active NOT AC power present. </s>
<s> Alas, an electrician should be called to really check the home wiring for the PC outlet(s). </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
