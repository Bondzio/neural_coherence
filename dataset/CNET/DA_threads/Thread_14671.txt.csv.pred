1.1.1	I have two usb drives used for backups that have the same files.	St
1.1.2	When checking properties the capacities are identical as well as the size of the files and directories.	St
1.1.3	However the used space on one drive is 300 mg higher than the other.	St
1.1.4	Any reason for this and can the used space made the same as the other?	St
1.2.1	Sadly one has to dive deep with analysis of exact byte counts.	St
1.2.2	Try comparing a sorted list of DIR *.	St
1.2.3	* /S/A (redirected to a file and sorted.)	St
1.2.4	Then use a file comparer to track down what differs.	St
