from other readings in these forums, it does seem that mixing wireless &quot;g&quot; with &quot;n&quot; and expecting smooth fallback isn't realistic.
you might try to temporarily lock your wireless on &quot;g&quot; to see if the complaints stop.
i believe you can use windows &quot;tracert&quot; to determine the connection path of your wife's pc just to make sure she's connecting through the desired device.
as for network finders/sniffers, etc., i believe such as &quot;netstumbler&quot; might assist in determining who else is broadcasting locally, at what signal strength, and what channels are in use.
