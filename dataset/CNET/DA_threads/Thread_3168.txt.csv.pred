1.1.1	I have an old HP that 's going to have to last me a little longer .	St
1.1.2	So yes , I realize some of these dated CPU 's are overpriced relative to more powerful options .	St
1.1.3	I am however , limited by my motherboard .	St
1.1.4	Here is the situation .	St
1.1.5	My motherboard : http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? docname=c00906129 & lc=en & cc=de & dlc=en & product=3424294 % E2 % 8C % A9=en My current CPU : http : //www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103776 The Options : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103645 I realize this is above 5600+ .	St
1.1.6	However , TDP is still 89w .	St
1.1.7	Is it safe to say this would be compatible ?	Ques
1.1.8	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103771 Though this is an older core and has TDP of 89w rather than the 65w of its Brisbane equivalent , it boasts double the L2 cache .	St
1.1.9	This is for a PC that is heavily used for gaming , and 3-D graphics software ( decreasing rendering times is a huge thing ) .	St
1.1.10	What do you recommend ?	Ques
1.2.1	I 'd forget the CPU as you have a 2+GHz dual core .	St
1.2.2	Shop for a better GPU .	St
1.3.1	I need this for faster overall performance and lower render times in 3-D apps .	St
1.3.2	I already have GeForce 9800GTX+ .	St
1.4.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103685	Ques
1.5.1	After many years I now write the speed gain is nearly linear in the same model lines .	St
1.5.2	That is your common X2 at 2.2GHz is 10 % faster thatn the 2.0 .	St
1.5.3	All that 's left for you to do is get the motherboard maker to say the CPU is supported .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	I was of the understanding that the numbers like & quot ; 6000 & quot ; were just superficial indicators of the max TDP supported , which in my case is 89w .	St
1.6.2	So I thought the 89w 6000 would be compatible .	St
1.6.3	Is this inaccurate ?	Ques
1.6.4	Also there is a 65w version of this http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103234 .	Ques
1.6.5	I 'd have to purchase from somewhere else but they seem identical with the exception of the TDP .	St
1.6.6	Would n't I want lower TDP ?	Ques
1.6.7	I 'm still wondering if the bigger Windsor cache will yield the most performance .	St
1.6.8	Can anybody help me with this ?	Ques
1.7.1	The Windsor model has a much larger cache .	St
1.7.2	Would this change things ?	Ques
1.8.1	Only in benchmarks is where you 'll see it and at the same clock rate with more cache the effect is usually below 2 % .	St
1.8.2	Why 2 % is important is that humans ca n't tell the difference until about 2 % .	St
1.8.3	So take time to find Tom 's Hardware CPU benchmarks but after all is said and done I like to see in the nearly same CPU line more GHz and same Watts when changing the CPU out .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	your system mfgs DOCs .	St
1.9.2	CPU-MB compatibility is BIOS driven so while it may have socket compatibility , you could have problems ranging from not working at all to working but not reflecting the right CPU specs .	St
1.9.3	If there two processor that appear to match the spec , I 'd contact the system mfg to make sure which is correct for your system .	St
1.9.4	Good luck and let us know how it works .	St
1.9.5	VAPCMD	St
