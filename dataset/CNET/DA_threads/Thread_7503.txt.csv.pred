1.1.1	I recently had a new hard drive added to my computer .	St
1.1.2	The old drive was left in as a slave drive , and a new installation of Windows XP Home SP2 was installed on the new drive .	St
1.1.3	The first thing I did when I got my machine home was to make sure windows was totally updated .	St
1.1.4	Since then , none of my USB devices will work .	St
1.1.5	When I plug any of them in , the computer will make the usual & quot ; bling-blong & quot ; sound , but nothing else happens .	St
1.1.6	It makes the usual & quot ; blong-bling & quot ; sound when I remove a device .	St
1.1.7	I am currently using ( well , attempting to use ) a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0 , a Brother MFC 5440CN , and a TV tuner device .	St
1.1.8	None of them work at all .	St
1.1.9	I tried to go into the Device Manager and update the drivers on the USB controllers , but Windows was unable to find an updated driver .	St
1.1.10	So , I uninstalled the devices and re-booted the machine .	St
1.1.11	I then went into the Device Manager and updated the drivers on the & quot ; Unknown Devices & quot ; that were there .	St
1.1.12	This worked and Windows successfully installed drivers for all six entries in the device manager .	St
1.1.13	However , after rebooting , I am still having exactly the same problem .	St
1.1.14	There was no change at all .	St
1.1.15	All of the drivers for the hardware are up-to-date and have been installed , uninstalled , and reinstalled .	St
1.1.16	I am running out of options !	St
1.1.17	Does anyone have any advice ?	Ques
1.1.18	Thanks for your help !	St

1.2.1	Microsoft does n't install drivers for all this plus ... there may be some motherboard driver package that needs installing .	St
1.2.2	Try to remember how you installed Windows last time .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	You probably need to install the mobo/chipset specific drivers .	St
1.3.2	Visit your mobo mfg 's website or your chipset mfg website and you should be in business .	St
