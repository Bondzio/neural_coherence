The motherboard went on it and since it was an old asus, to replace it was more than enough to spur me into buying a new computer. The guys down at the store I purchased it at wore kind enough to connect my old hard drive to the new computer and get Vista to recognize it. My old operating system was XP SP2. Anyways, I got the computer all hooked up now and can see the old hard drive with a drive letter J assigned to it. I can access it and see old program files, old windows files, etc. Only thing is I can not find my pictures, videos and music. Under documents and settings there are &quot;all users&quot; &quot;incomplete&quot; &quot;My wifes name&quot; but not mine (which had everything on it). Where did it go??? Any and all help would be appreciated as there are valuable pics that I need to recover. Thanks

But all the moderators know this -&gt; &quot;We only lose what we don't backup.&quot; Where is the backup copy?

Did you check its contents? Anyhow, connecting an old drive with Windows system files to a new PC via IDE or SATA is a bad idea. Better to connect thru a USB converter or external USB enclosure. Your files might all be gone now, or they might not. Before you do more harm to the old files, try connecting the drive with a USB converter. Good luck.

To be honest, probably 1/4 of the pics are backed up on my PS3 and ofcourse I was meaning to finish them..... But this morning I tried something for the hell of it....and it worked! I set the attributes of the whole drive to hidden and then changed it back.....VOILA! There was my name, with all the subfolders inside. Weird. Thanks for all the replies....guess you know what I will be doing this weekend.
