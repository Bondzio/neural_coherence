I guess my main question is this: Should I wait until Vista and Direct X 10 come out before I build my first system? Will the new top of the line cards like the ATI 1900 512 mb be direct X 10 ready, or will a whole new set of cards come out just for DX 10? Thanks you.

They might but here is something to note: DirectX 10 will be exclusive to Vista according to the Wikipedia article for DirectX. While yes you download DirectX, it would be up to Microsoft to list what is compatiable with what and if they decide that XP and DirectX 10 don't work together then they don't work together.

I understand about waiting, you can wait forever and there will always be something else about to come out, you must take the plunge at some point! This time though, there is an entirely new operating system, and DX 10. I guess I mean to ask, is DX 10 so radically different that current cards will be incpable of running it, or is is simply a matter of liscensing and money that will stop current cards from running it? I just cant imagine every card out right now suddenly becoming obsolete the day DX 10 is released. I guess another way to put it is this way: when will game makers start really using DX 10 to make games? If 99% of the video cards out there are not DX 10 capable, whats the point of even using DX 10? they may as well play the waiting game and wait until a majority of users have a DX 10 card.

I do plan on getting vista, so as long as I have vista I should be able to run DX 10 on a video card I buy today, like an ATI 1900. But if I keep using XP I shouldnt expect to be able to run DX 10. It all makes sense now. Forgive me, I am a little slow on the uptake

There are always problems with new os's even though the date got pushed back on vista. Im going to wait until around march to buy a card.

And, this card can handle much more than the previous gen pcie cards. Its a kick but card in SLI mode. It has 1.5 gigs of gddr4 memory in sli mode.
