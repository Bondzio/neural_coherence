I found this motherboard and is this anygood with the AMD ATHLON 64 3500+? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131510 thanks! The motherboard above has VIA chipset.

Cold boot to operating with XP Pro is less than one minute. RAID0 may be faster yet (I saw a claim of 19 seconds, but...).
