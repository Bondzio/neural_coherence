I had forgot about the GeForce 5500 PCI card.
Well, I personally think that 256MB is not needed unless it is on a high end video card for high tech competition gamers.
I kinda think it is a marketing ploy to get people to upgrade to a higher card.
I doubt there is any game that even requires the full use of 128MB and there are an awful lot of high end cards at 128MB.
However, the BGF GeForce 5500 is an overclocked version to 290 MHz from 270MHz, and since this is for a PCI card machine, and you want the max you can get, it may be worth the $30 cost over the regular 5500 PCI card.
I haven't compared the BGF 5500 PCI to the 5700LE PCI.
Best regards & good gaming.
