hi kees, i tried to install the avast program by using safe mode(tried others as well)....it still did not work.
is there anything else i can do.
i talked to a computer repair guy and he said it would cost 60 dollars or more to rid the virus....(heck its best to buy the anti-virus program from the virus itself for 37.99).
any help right now would be greatly appreciated.
thanks!
