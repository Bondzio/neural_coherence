<s> I have a floppy disk with a very important document on it that I need to get off of it. </s>
<s> However when I put the disk into the floppy drive of a couple different computers it prompts me to format the disk. </s>
<s> I read about this problem once before but I don't recall how to get around it. </s>
<s> The only copy of this document is on the floppy. </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Po </s>
<s> I boot my old DOS based machine and copy the file out. </s>
<s> It's a known issue with Windows and some bits on the diskette. </s>
<s> I decline to look it up, explain it or more but share my way. </s>

<s> Got it. </s>
<s> Any advice for a fool like myself with no DOS machine? </s>
<s> Po </s>
<s> It's over at bootdisk.com You must know someone that has such or such skill. </s>
<s> But be sure to write protect the floppy until you save it. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
