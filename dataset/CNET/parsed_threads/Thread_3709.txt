<s> I recently installed DSL. </s>
<s> The modem is connected to a Windows XP (Home Edition) machine and I have a Windows '98SE machine networked to the home portal via a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> My first problem is that the '98SE machine usually will not boot up unless I unplug the wireless adapter from the USB port. </s>
<s> The machine then boots but I immediately receive the following two Windows error messages. </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- Message one: C:\Program Files\BellSouth\WLAN Utility\SWLU.exe ------------------------------------------------------- Message two: The ADSLDPC.DLL file is linked to missing export NTDLL.DLL:RtllnitUnicodeString. </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- I have downloaded the NTDLL.DLL but am not sure if it goes is C:\Windows\System. </s>
<s> I tried placing the file in that directory once before when I received the same error messages during a software installation and it did not solve the problem. </s>
<s> Is the RtllnitUnicodeString part of the registry? </s>
<s> I have run regedit and cannot find it. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help anyone can provide. </s>
<s> Thanks, hwy61visitor </s>
<s> Read the short hit list at http://www.google.com/search?&q=ADSLDPC.DLL+file+is+linked+to+missing+export+NTDLL.DLL%3ARtllnitUnicodeString </s>
<s> http://forums.thatcomputerguy.us/index.php?showtopic=13165 but to tell the truth, this issue with the USB adapter looks like an incomplete install of 98 without the latest drivers for the motherboard and other devices. </s>
