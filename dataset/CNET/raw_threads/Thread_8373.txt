The problem occurs later, when I reboot, and no mouse is recognized at all. There does not appear to be anything wrong with the connector. Should I get an adaptor and try it on the PS/2 port. Is it any better than the serial port, or is there no difference at all? Although I have another USB mouse that works fine,I like the Kensington because the size of the trackball makes it easy to move around. Any suggestions?

I have one (use Win XP) that has become problematic; working 50% of the time and vice-versa. I have no idea what is wrong with it. I love the big OLD thing and have no idea what I should replace it with. Are there any other die hard trackball users out there with advice about current models?
