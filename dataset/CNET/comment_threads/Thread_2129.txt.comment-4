I want to disable the on-board SATA, if I can find a board supporting 4 ports.
I'm planning to upgrade to a 120GB SATA SSD for my boot drive and use my WD 2TB as my storage drive and run my SATA DVD Drive.
I've used SiiG SCSI cards and was never as comfortable with them as I was with Adaptec.
I'm not planning on running RAID because the GT5628 case is too tight for a third drive (no heat issues with the Crucial SSD but the WD's throw some heat) I have a server case that I'm going to be moving the drives to eventually but I'm having too much fun getting this 5628 to run when Gateway tells me that it won't!)
Thanks for the advice.
