I wanted to get some feedback before I started ripping off heat sinks and potentially damaging the processors--since this will be my first dig into a motherboard beyond RAM and PCI cards.
I am inclined to do this, but I wanted some confirmation first.
From your reply, I assume you feel this is a likely culprit.
Does the fact that it still boots etc.
prior to overheating hint that the processors are feasibly still good?
Thanks in advance.
