<s> I have an RCA cable modem (Time Warner) and a Netgear router which work flawlessly when I have the WiFi disabled. </s>
<s> In this configuration I have two computers wired to it - one Mac & one PC (running Windows XP). </s>
<s> I've been running this connection for over a year without any problems. </s>
<s> Recently I attempted to enable the WiFi but the modem and router would crash after a few minutes. </s>
<s> I was able to isolate the problem as being related to the PC (at least I think so). </s>
<s> I discovered that with the WiFi enabled and only the Mac connected, the system will work fine. </s>
<s> But when I connect the PC, the modem & router will crash again. </s>
<s> I am restarting everything in order: modem - router - computers. </s>
<s> One thing I noticed it that, when the PC is turned off and the network cable is plugged into the router, the port light is on. </s>
<s> Not sure if this has anything to do with it, but it seems to be the only unusual thing I've noticed. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Why didn't you share the router's model number? </s>
<s> Maybe all you wanted to read was to go get a new router? </s>

<s> The sarcasm isn't necessary. </s>
<s> Notice I didn't indicate the model number of the modem, either. </s>
<s> Maybe that implies I just want to hear &quot;get a new modem&quot;? </s>
<s> For others reading this who may be able to offer helpful advice, the model number is WGR614v7. </s>
<s> I'm left to guess what your goals are when you post without the pertinent details. </s>
<s> NO SARCASM was intended but I tend to lay it out plainly since some need to hear (read) &quot;get a new router.&quot; -&gt; The 614s are well known to me. </s>
<s> Here's what I find works. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Use their latest firmware. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Use the default settings. </s>
<s> THEN!!! </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Use WPA for the security. </s>
<s> Do not deploy with WEP, MAC filters, etc. </s>
<s> Stick to the basic 3 items I listed. </s>
<s> Consider locking the WIFI to just 802.11g since the mixed b/g mode is known to be less stable. </s>
<s> In closing, do not run any TORRENTS over wifi. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
