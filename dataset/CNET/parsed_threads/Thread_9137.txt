<s> I have an old Compaq Presario 5102us with an AMD 1Ghz Athlon, 200Mhz FSB, 384 SDRAM, 40GB hard drive and it's almost 5 years old. </s>
<s> I recently bought a processor from ebay for it cause the one that it had before fried (Fan came loose and was separated from the cpu, causing it to fry). </s>
<s> I've been trying to fix this pc for months, but being in college and working, I don't have a lot of time to try to fix it. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I decided to take a look at it, everything came on except for the monitor. </s>
<s> I hooked up my HP a1010n's monitor, an HP vs17 monitor, and it didn't show any image either. </s>
<s> It keeps telling me to &quot;Check the Video Cable&quot;. </s>
<s> I started playing with the cables and connectors, thinking maybe I put them wrong when I put the new processor in a few months ago, but that wasn't doing the trick. </s>
<s> I also found a very small little black piece coming off the mother board, near where the processor sits... </s>
<s> I took it out since it was loose anyway.... </s>
<s> I also changed the CMOS battery like it was suggested to me, but that did not fix the problem. </s>
<s> My question is: Is it the video card or the motherboard? </s>
<s> Does that little piece be the reason for the motherboard to be bad, or could it be something else wrong with the motherboard? </s>
<s> Or is it the video card since the monitor will not come up but it does tell me to &quot;Check Video Cable&quot;? </s>
<s> Which ever the problem is, WHAT DO I DO NOW? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> YLC </s>
<s> Bob, where are you??? </s>
<s> :-/ </s>
<s> ...but for this, you need to have someone see the PC -- small pieces coming off doesn't sound good. </s>
<s> if you have another functioning video card that you could put in the pc, that could determine if its the card or the motherboard. </s>
<s> a used pc/parts store might do a free/cheap diagnosis if you they have a replacement motherboard. </s>
<s> the monitor would not come on and this black piece i'm talking about is the size of a grain of rice. </s>
<s> So I doubt this has a lot, if anything, to do with the fact that the monitor won't come on. </s>
<s> I guess I could try the video card at a local shop, if I can find someone to do it for free. </s>
<s> What else could it be, though? </s>
<s> even when the rest of the system, including the CPU isn't even on, or the CPU is dead. </s>
<s> Hey Ray, so you think it's not the video card because the monitor displayed that message? </s>
<s> I don't know what else to do. </s>
<s> I know you've offered for me to send it to you, but I don't have the ways to send it and I don't trust how UPS/FEDEX treat their packages (Since I worked with UPS, I'd know!, lol!) </s>
<s> I guess I'll have to find a local shop that is willing to check it out for me for free or something. </s>
<s> If you can think of anything else, let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> that is definitely was not the video card. </s>
<s> The history of that system and its performance after putting the new CPU in just bothers me. </s>
<s> since I'm the one that has to deal with it! </s>
<s> :-P But anyays, since I can't get any help here I'll take it to a shop, I guess, whenever I have money. </s>
<s> Thanks anyways. </s>
