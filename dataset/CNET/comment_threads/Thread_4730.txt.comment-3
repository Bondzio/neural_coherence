Bob, Thanks for your help.
I had no problems removing the hard drive from the case and hooking it up to the IDE channel internally.
When I booted my PC, I was able to see the drive, but WXP said that the drive needed to be formatted and I could not browse the drive.
Any suggestions?
I read somewhere about trying the Knoppix CD?
Thanks again for your help!
