the manual should explain what you need to know.
the blue thingees are the &quot;jumpers&quot; just configure to the way you want the audio connected or setup.
look at the picture/graphic in manual and &quot;usually&quot; the way they show it is the default setting.
why you moved other jumpers for the audio portion doesn't make sense.
in other words, &quot;just what are you trying to do&quot;?
for what you want.
my experience has shown the latest info is gotten from the website, so d/l the new manual or help guide and use that.
just be sure you're reading the guide for the proper mtrbd.
model.
the jumper itself, connects two pins, use the side that has two holes.
unlss intel is using some new jumper i suggest to proceed with common sense.
good luck -----willy
