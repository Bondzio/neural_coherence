i had more or less the same problem yesterday.
computer froze, i rebooted and...nothing.
the power comes on, the hard drive light is on (constantly) the cd rom light comes on briefly and then that's it.
i tried clearing the cmos but no joy i don't care about tha data...it's my kids pc, but i don't want to throw it away.
bit of a bugger really richard
