<s> Hello, I just moved into my friends apartment and found that he has quite an annoying problem with his PC. </s>
<s> When the computer is not muted there is a constant beeping noise that could best be described as some sort of siren like noise... </s>
<s> I imagine that this should not be too difficult to fix, but I don't really know what to do or where to start. </s>
<s> I would appreciate it if you guys could help me get to the bottom of this! </s>
<s> My friend is not sure what type of soundcard he has, but he does believe this is where the problem is... </s>
<s> He does not keep a cover on his tower, so I just peeked inside. </s>
<s> I only see 2 cards, they appear to be 1) a video card & 2) a wireless card. </s>
<s> No signs of a soundcard at all... His computer is an X86-based PC, running XP Professional SP 2, SMBIOS version 2.2 I don't know what other info I may be able to provide, just ask if anything else is needed. </s>
<s> Any and all help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Time to find out why it's going off. </s>
<s> My friend keeps the lid off of his tower because he believes that is helps the system run cooler... How may I figure out if it is an overheating alarm? </s>
<s> But if the heatsink isn't on right, fan failed, missing heatsink compound etc. </s>
<s> the siren goes off. </s>

<s> There is no sound card, it just runs off the mother board. </s>
<s> I have tried re-installing an updated driver, this did not work. </s>
<s> The sound is faint, but gets louder as the volume is raised. </s>
<s> I was thinking it had something to do with my 5.1 system frequencies not being fully supported by the mother board or something. </s>
<s> It is very possible it IS a heatsink problem. </s>
<s> My buddy that installed it messed up the little plastic arms that clamp down the heatsink but said &quot;it would work fine&quot;. </s>
<s> Are these arms something I can replace or should I just by a whole new CPU? </s>
<s> I have an Intel Pent. </s>
<s> 4 3.0 Ghz on a Abit m/b. </s>
<s> Also ... </s>
<s> I just bought C&C 3 (I high performance video game) and 5 minutes into running it the game shuts off . </s>
<s> The monitor says &quot;no input&quot; but the power supply and hard drive are running. </s>
<s> Would this be a related problem - the heatsink? </s>
<s> Since you can't use my clues I fear you have to take it to a repair shop. </s>
<s> The machine will die soon altogether (usually) so it makes it easier to deal with for some. </s>
