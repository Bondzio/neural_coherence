the motherboard has been used previously and didn't come with a manual.
will look online for docs.
the square one has '12v pwr' printed next to it.
the rectangular one has '1x4 pwr' printed next to it and looks like the power socked on the back of optical drives (male connector - 4 pin).
i've noticed sata printed on it somewhere (i'm at work so i can't look.
what is sata?
