<s> I have a few questions about netbooks. </s>
<s> I want to buy one in a few days and am a bit confused about there power. </s>
<s> Can someone answer these questions. </s>
<s> This is the netbook I was thinking about getting ( http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&sku_id=0665000FS10124114&catid= ). </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Can we put more ram into it? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Can it play divx movies and TV shows? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> There is one game that I want it to play. </s>
<s> It's an old game but I'm not sure if it has the power to play it. </s>
<s> It is called Fitness yourself and can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yourself!Fitness . </s>
<s> If you look at the requirements they are for very old computers. </s>
<s> That's why I am hoping I can run it. </s>
<s> My plan is to hook up to a monitor and do all of the above. </s>
<s> Is this possible or am I expecting too much out of a netbook? </s>
<s> I own an Acer Aspire One with 1GB RAM, XP and found no reason to add ram. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Hulu and such play fine. </s>
<s> I'm sure some divx file won't play but I've seen that happen on laptops, desktops all over so my answer will be that no one can tell you yes here. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> With an external monitor my kid played many games. </s>
<s> And by enabling pan and scrolling (not going to tell you how here!) </s>
<s> he played games on the road. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Just yesterday I did hours of presentations on our netbook. </s>
<s> Yup it was an external. </s>
<s> In closing I can't seem to use that link. </s>
<s> Why not just post make and model? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Toshiba 10.1&quot; Intel Atom N280 1.66GHz Laptop (NB200-002) </s>
<s> It was fine but they felt it was a little pricey. </s>
<s> You pay for the slimmer form over the Acer models. </s>
<s> I have found 2 different versions of this netbook. </s>
<s> 1 has a 3 cell and the other has a 6 cell. </s>
<s> There is a $70.00 difference. </s>
<s> Can netbook batteries be upgraded or is it risky? </s>
<s> You find you may pay more than 70 later. </s>
<s> How to do the upgrade? </s>
<s> Turn the power off, slide out the old battery, slip in the new one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for very much for your assistance. </s>
<s> I have looked at the acer models and they are missing a few things that I need. </s>
<s> I haven't found one that has VGA, bluetooth, and a large battery like this one. </s>
<s> Small size doesn't really matter that much. </s>
<s> I just don't want it to be the size of the laptop. </s>
<s> I also like this one because it has the new atom processor. </s>
<s> I have a feeling I am going to need some heavy processing. </s>
<s> Not really that heavy but the more power I can get the better. </s>
<s> VGA port and the bluetooth was a nano USB thing. </s>
<s> If you start down the road of CPUs and more you may as well buy a laptop. </s>
<s> Are you sure you want a netbook? </s>
<s> I own the Acer so I can address performance and real world battery times. </s>
<s> See the 3 smaller bluetooth usb things at http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=12475 Bob </s>
<s> I need something ultra portable with a long battery life. </s>
<s> I have tried bluetooth adapters before and they all fall short of what I need. </s>
<s> Mostly because I forget them at places but also it's an add-on and I really hate add-ons. </s>
<s> The same goes for the webcam. </s>
<s> I had separate webcams but having one built in the computer is pretty sweet. </s>
<s> Processing speed is absolutely important. </s>
<s> It's a computer no matter how you look at it. </s>
<s> Otherwise they would install Windows Mobile, or Android. </s>
<s> It is equally important to know how much RAM it can take because it's a computer. </s>
<s> Same goes with hard drive space. </s>
<s> I have had this netbook for 2 days and am really impressed with what I can do with it. </s>
<s> It goes far beyond being able to view websites and writing documents like the advertisements say. </s>
<s> I based that initially off of the specs but it was confirmed when I bought the device. </s>
