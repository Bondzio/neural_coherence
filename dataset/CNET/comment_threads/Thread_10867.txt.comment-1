Hi I am going to purchase a new desktop to replace current six-year-old Dell Dimension 8250.
I am a senior and this will probably be my last comuter.
I am only a general user but want the most &quot;bang for the buck&quot; PC.
I am strongly considering an Acer Aspire X3200-ED5600A or Acer Aspire X1700-U3700A(I think these are almost the same machine but believe I can purchase the 3200 a little cheaper-it looks as though the major differences are the Graphics Controllers: the 3200 uses the NVIDIAGeForce8200 and the 1700 uses the NVIDIA GeForce G100 and the Processors: the 3200 uses AMD Athlon X2 5600+ 2.9 GHz dual core and the 1700 uses the Intel Pentium Dual Core E5200 2.4 GHz Any significant differences?
Common Components Storage Controller: Serial ATA-300 Op.
Storage: DVD RW/DVD-RAM Ram: 4 GB DDR2 SDRAM Cache Mem.
: 1 MB L2 Cache Small Form Factor OS: Vista Home Premium 64 bit Hard Drive: 640 GB Audio Output: 5.1 channel surround The 3200 would cost about $415 online with free shipping and the 1700 would cost about $480 Thoughts on Acer/configuration?
The compact space of these is a factor and I do not upgrade components so the lack of upgradeability is not a factor.
Regards Ronhawk
