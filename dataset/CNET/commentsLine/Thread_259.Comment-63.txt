i really hope you find the cause and can solve this.
there's so much time and emotion invested in it already.
the current status seems to be, that the drives can read and play a prerecorded (audio?)
cd, and can't play a prerecorded dvd.
that might simply point to defective hardware, but that's somewhat unlikely (although not impossible) with two drives having the same symptoms.
but it could also mean that there's simply something wrong with the dvd playing software, and nothing else.
and it's clearly mentioned that after deleting the drives from device manager they were reinstalled by windows at the next boot.
and that's the way it should be: both cd (reading and writing) and dvd (reading only) are fully supported by windows xp and don't need third-party drivers.
the next actions depend on the status on other points, like: - can a data cd be read (use windows explorer or my computer to check)?
- can a data dvd be read (same)?
- can you burn data to cd using a burning program?
- can you burn data to cd using only native windows xp?
- can you burn data to dvd using a burning program?
- what cd/dvd-software is installed (what version of sonic mydvd, any other)?
- what did dell tech support do in the registry by telephone - it's easy to screw things up beyond repair good luck, kees
