so i just got a bunch of parts for a computer that i want to build.
i finished it and plugged my computer via hdmi to my also new asus monitor and got no display.
heard no beeping in the computer and everything sounds like it's running normal.
i have tried multiple monitors in the house and different type of connections on my graphics card.
i am unsure what to do.
