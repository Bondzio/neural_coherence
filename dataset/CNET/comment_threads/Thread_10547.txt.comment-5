I have a card picked out already, why?
Because I'm still in AGP.
This is what my question is about: I have an old system, hence my: 2 GB PC3200 Single Channel memory PNY Verto 7600 GS AGP Pentium D dual core @ 3.4 GHz I do not have any PCI-E slots, and I'm wondering is: What kind of gain (fps) I would get playing games like Call of Duty 4, Rainbow Six: Vegas, and Left4Dead, and other newer game out by replacing my 7600 GS with an HD3850.
Why am I wondering this?
: I've been told that since my outdated single channel memory can't feed info to my CPU (vice versa) fast enough, I'm already severely limiting myself.
However, since I'm a heavy gamer, the best AGP card out (SAPPHIRE HD3850 AGP) might help me get higher FPS.
I've ran benchmarks and I'm pretty sure my GPU is the weakest link, however, 2 GB of single channel and a Pentium D @ 3.4 GHz isn't too hot either.
So bascially: CONSIDERING MY CURRENT SPECS, how much of a gain in FPS would I get with a SAPPHIRE HD3850 AGP
