<s> In reading various articles I'm more confused on what to buy than ever. </s>
<s> My family gets in the internet, used MS Office, does some minor playing around with pictures, really just simple basic stuff. </s>
<s> I'm looking for a recommendation on a low end computer desktop (box only) to buy. </s>
<s> Does anyone have a suggestion on what to get that fits this user description? </s>
<s> We'd like to be in the sub-$600 range too. </s>
<s> Thanks all, Mark </s>
<s> I suggest looking at an HP. </s>
<s> It is a middle range brand with good quality. </s>
<s> Another good brand is Lenovo and for $500 you'll find something nice with either brand. </s>
<s> Since you dont need anything fancy, look for something with these specs: * Intel Core i3 -or- Intel Core 2 Duo -or- AMD Athlon II * 3 or 4 Gigabytes of Memory * 500Gb Hard Drive or more * Windows 7 I've read not to bother with any warranty they offer because usually problems occur within the first year and the manufacturer should cover that. </s>
<s> Here's a few I've picked out for your price range. </s>
