it is possible to run ati x-fire on an sli motherboard, through driver hacks, and the like.
even though it can be done, i wouldn't attempt it.
a single ati card will work fine on an sli motheboard, though.
if you want x-fire, why not just get an x-fire board?
also, i wasn't aware that amd made an x2 4800+ for socket am2.
