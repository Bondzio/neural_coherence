I don't know what your experience is, so, forgive me for being simple.
My suggestion is that you visit &quot;www.computerhope.com&quot; this site has some very useful information; i.e.
definitions of processor protocols, raid arrays, compatability of hardware, etc.
Also, have a look at this site &quot;www.overclockers.com&quot; ...eventhough you may not be planning on overclocking your processor, this site may have some very useful pointers as well.
Oh, as for static electricity, just be sure to discharge onto the case that you are building in before grabbing any components each and every time.
Just go at it carefully and slowly.
It's fun...enjoy.
