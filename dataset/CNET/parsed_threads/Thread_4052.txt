<s> Hi I apologize if this has been discussed before I unfortunately cannot find it anywhere on the forum. </s>
<s> I am in the market for a new laptop. </s>
<s> I run quite a few database intensive programs as well as multitask extensively. </s>
<s> With all the new laptops out there my question is should I opt for more Ram (12GB) or would the performance be better with say 8GB of Ram and a 32GB mssd. </s>
<s> Thanking everyone in advance for their help </s>
<s> Keep in mind that more RAM does not mean reduced times. </s>
<s> An example long ago is where we had identical PCs and was able to swap the RAM from one to the other. </s>
<s> The job would take 6 hours. </s>
<s> So we doubled the RAM and re-ran the tests on both machines. </s>
<s> The machine with double the RAM finished 5 minutes sooner without fail. </s>
<s> So RAM in that case was not the bottleneck. </s>
<s> 12GB of RAM on a netbook in my opinion is a bad investment. </s>
<s> Nod to the Hybrid Hard Drive. </s>
