the case i aquired has a lcd panel to indicate temperature labeled cpu,hdd, & vga.
how are these best positioned?
cpu: at the base (side) of the heat sink?
hdd: on the drive itself or near the controller ic?
vga: controller ic?
i am hoping someone has experience with these devices and can advise what is considered optimum use.
thanks, rbul
