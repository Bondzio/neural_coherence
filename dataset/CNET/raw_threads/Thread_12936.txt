15278	0	196819	2117896	NR	TonyTTurner	8/7/06 1:52 PM	1.15495872E12	Problems installing WinXP Pro on old Hard Drive from Laptop;	First...the Specs: LAPTOP PC: - DELL Inpiron 9300 Laptop, WinXP Media CenterEd. 2005 Serv Pack 2, Pent. M proc. 1.86 GHz, 2GB RAM, 160GB Hitachi HDD, TS-L532B Dual-Layer DVD+/-RW drive. Built-in WiFi & Bluetooth. - The laptop came installed with a 50(+) GB HDD... I had used Acronis True Image to &quot;Mirror&quot; it to the 160GB HDD which was mounted inside an External 2.5&quot; enclosure via USB. I then swapped the two (2) drives; whereas the 160GB HDD booted up with no problems. - After Formatting the 50GB HDD inside the External enclosure using Window's Computer Management, I am quite certain that I mistakenly Deleted/Formatted OVER the Boot portion of the HDD. (When I first received the Laptop from Dell, the HDD space was 51.1GB...I now have a Healthy 55.83GB w/ 55 MB as FAT EISA Configuration.) When I mounted it back in the laptop, Booted from CD-Drive with Windows XP Professional, the screen simply gave a response of &quot;NTLDR is Missing. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart.&quot; - Can anyone give me any ideas on how I can get what I need Back onto the 50+ GB HDD (preferably via External USB enclosure so I can install WinXP Pro...just in case I ever tire of Win XP Media Center? Thanks in Advance! Tony

If you get the NTLDR error, you are probably attempting to boot from the drive. If you press F2 (usually) during the BIOS POST, you can enter the setup menu and make sure that the CD-ROM is the first boot device. Then when you restart, you should be able to boot from the CD - Make sure you watch - there should be a &quot;Press any key to boot from CD&quot; message. Once you get into the XP Setup, delete the existing partition and let XP re-format using NTFS, then install XP.

I'll give it another try, though I thought I HAD tried to Boot from the CD before. I'm writing you This on my Laptop now, but as soon as I can, I'll swap out this 160 Gigger for the 50+ Gigger 'n' try it again. - I'll probably use my brother's Laptop to bring up your posting and view the steps Side-by-Each. ;-D - Thank You again, and I'll let you know my progress!

Diskette Drive (though there Isn't one) 3. Internal HDD 4. USB Storage Device (there are also Two (2) other non-Highlighted options: Cardbus NIC and Onboard NIC) - Yet, with the WinXP Pro disk in the drive, it pauses with a ''0 Active'' in the upper leftt-hand corner and a Blinking cursor beneath. If any key is touched, it ''beep-beeps'' once and says: ''No Bootable Devices - Strike F1 to Retry or F2 for Setup Utility.'' - I've tried even changing around these sequences with no results occuring. BTW, the WinXP Pro disk is Legit. I even put it in my DeskTop PC and it workS just Fine. - Any further help is Greatly Appreciated. Thanks Again. Tony

Even after getting mildly frustrated and turning Off the Laptop, I later turned it back on, checked Again the Boot Sequence, and it does indeed SHOW that the CD Drive is the First priority... But still the same issues. - I'll be awaiting any further advice. Tony

It is possible that the drive no longer will accept a bootable disk. BTW can you still see the info on the WinXP disk from the laptop when it is booted from the new HD?
15278	7	196819	2123089	2121760	TonyTTurner	8/9/06 1:01 PM	1.15512846E12	Hey Everyone, I think I MIGHT have found the solution...	First, I re-mounted the 55+ HDD (which is actually a 60GB according to the info on the HDD's label, so I'll call it That. , back into the Mini-External case, then, I put the 160HDD back in my Laptop. Turned both on. (Of course lol!) Then, I went to Computer Management, found it and compared Partitions with what I have already Running (the 160HDD) to the 60HDD (in the Ext. case). Apparently, and I'm betting THIS is the answer, the 60HDD's &quot;Healthy&quot; partition of 55.83 Gigs NEEDS to be &quot;Marked as &quot;ACTIVE&quot;. I found this out by Right-clicking the Larger Healthy partition, and &quot;Mark as Active&quot; was in BOLD. On the 160GB HDD inside my Laptop, the Healthy partition's &quot;Mark as Active&quot; isn't clickable idicating that it is Already Active. - By the way Lacsr?, I did indeed attempt to boot other CD-ROMs to that drive (when it was IN the Laptop of course And yes as well, with the New 160DD in my Laptop, EVERYTHING shows/boots Nicely. You'd mentioned that it is possible taht it may no longer accept a Bootable Disk...As I'd writen in my Original post, I think I may have Deleted and/or Formatted Over the Boot portion of the 60GB HDD. (See next paragraph for more upcoming info)... Thank You so MUCH for your suggestions. I appreciate your assistace! - Now, back to the issue @ hand. I think I'll &quot;Mark as Active&quot; the 60GB HDD while I still have it inside the Ext. case... H-O-P-E-F-U-L-L-Y it will then enable me Boot to it and even install a different O.S. to it (i.e., Windows XP Pro, or a LINUX O.S.) - Thanks again to all who have assisted me, or may even have any further Comments/ Questions to this post. - Later, Tony
