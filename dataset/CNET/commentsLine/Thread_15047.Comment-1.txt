i currently have two sys.
a laptop upstairs and a desktop downstairs that has the printer attached to it.. both have windows xp.
the laptop is using a wireless connection.
both sys can get to the internet.
when i first got these sys i could print from the laptop.
about a three weeks ago i loaded the firewall that aol had offered to it's members.
for about a week after loading this to the desktop and then the laptop.
i could print.
however for the last two weeks i could not print from the laptop.
i can not see the printer.
i have since removed the firewall from both sys.
also i can not see the laptop from the desktop nor the desktop from the laptop.
no network.
have have run the wizard and still no connection.
i can still get to the internet.
