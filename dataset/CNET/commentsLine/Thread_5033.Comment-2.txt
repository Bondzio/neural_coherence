while you may call the uj-835e carp i want to share with you a problem i see in the industry.
they didn't do a good job of relaying that all these low prices came at the cost of lower years of life in the products.
so i want to warn you that your replacement drive will likely last just as long as your uj-835e.
that being said, i try to shop at the usual mac outlets since they'll get me the drive that will &quot;just work.&quot; i know i get to replace these things about every 1 to 3 years depending on a variety of factors.
