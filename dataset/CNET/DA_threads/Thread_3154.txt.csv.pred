1.1.1	I have a few external drives and need to find a way to **permanenently** assign drive letters to them .	St
1.1.2	I have tried the windows disk mgt function that is part of the & quot ; Computer Management & quot ; group but it does not seems to be a ***permanent*** letter assignment .	St
1.1.3	i.e. , I will assign letters but then later the letters will change , which makes software that points to the drives fail .	St
1.1.4	For example , on July 1 say I assign letter J : \ to ext HD # 1 .	St
1.1.5	Over the next few weeks , HD # 1 gets turned on and off , plugged and unplugged etc .	St
1.1.6	Then on July 21 , somehow ext HD # 2 has stolen the J : \ letter and now ext HD # 1 ( the one that used to be J ) has been given K : \ ... my backup software fails b/c it cant find the drive , software that references those drives fails etc .	St
1.1.7	Any help appreciated !	Polite
1.1.8	!	St
1.2.1	http : //www.pcadvisor.co.uk/downloads/index.cfm ? categoryid=1503 & itemId=15520 There are reasons for the letters to change such as using a different USB port , etc .	St
1.2.2	But the above software did list XP so good luck .	St

1.4.1	I tried using the Letter Assigner program suggsted and it wont seem install on XP SP2 - when try to install get error & quot ; This program will not run on Windows NT & quot ; Anyone have any suggestions or alt programs ?	Ques
1.5.1	That was listed for XP but it 's time to me to go somewhere .	St
1.5.2	BRB	St
1.6.1	I 've seen a similar problem but as long as I can access the data , I let it go no matter what the drive letter .	St
1.6.2	Look at this link : http : //www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-change-the-drive-letter-in-windows-xp-for-an-external-usb-stick-or-hard-drive/ This should n't be a problem if you access the same port and use 1 ext .	St
1.6.3	drive or at least it does n't pop-up as often .	St
1.6.4	However , once you plug-in several drives it seems the linage gets hosed .	St
1.6.5	I think the term , & quot ; permanent & quot ; maybe the falsehood here as i see it .	St
1.6.6	IMHO , use your different USB hubs to better control the issue , one per .	St
1.6.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	I have a drive that always goes to the letter I choose .	St
1.7.2	But it 's letter is no where near the a to f or letters that could get bumped .	St
1.8.1	and later copy the backups to an external .	St
1.8.2	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	I went with Bobss suggestion and made them x y and z. lets see if it sticks .	St
1.9.2	the uwe stieger ( ? )	Ques
1.9.3	german guys 's app looks like worth a look too but i dont like it runs always as a service ... call me paranoid ...	St
1.10.1	It 's a very old app that 's been around for a very very long time .	St
1.10.2	I have called it up since I ran Windows 98 !	St
1.11.1	I 'm sure all the people here have different answers that might work or not , but please do n't end up paying for something that is advertized to to correct this .	St
1.11.2	I the only suggestion i will give you right now is try -- - TweakUI and always skip 1 letter from C : which the next letter will be now E : You have full power with this free app .	St
1.11.3	Make it work for you and always read the help if you do n't understand anything .	St

1.12.1	All versions of Windows feel that they can rearrange things to suit themselves .	St
1.12.2	On the other hand , Windows seems to leave things stable unless it & quot ; needs & quot ; to use them differently .	St
1.12.3	Assigning a letter in the P , Q , R , S , T range greatly reduces the chances that Windows will & quot ; need & quot ; the letter for something else .	St
1.12.4	Details you may not need to know : Windows leaves the A and B letters for floppy drives , regardless of whether there are any present .	St
1.12.5	Windows assigns the & quot ; first & quot ; internal hard drive letter & quot ; C & quot ; .	St
1.12.6	It determines & quot ; first & quot ; by iterating through IDE , SATA ( and older ) drives starting with first interface Master , then second interface master , then first interface Slave , then second interface Slaves .	St
1.12.7	Then it goes through SCSI drives in SCSI number order ( and yes , it uses secondary SCSI numbers as well if present ) .	St
1.12.8	Some system BIOS software allows SCSI to be set first .	St
1.12.9	Only then does it iterate through USB or firewire drives ( I 'm really not sure which goes first ) , choosing in order by USB tree ( 128 possible per controller , but controllers in order as set up by the system ) .	St
1.12.10	CD or DVD drive letters are set up AFTER hard drives , also in interface order .	St
1.12.11	As you can see , adding new hard drives tends to displace older ones .	St
1.12.12	A complicated example : A -Floppy B - reserved for missing floppy C - IDE hard drive first master D - IDE hard drive second master E - IDE hard drive first slave F - CD drive second slave G - SCSI hard drive ID 2 H - SCSI hard drive ID 3 I - SCSI CD drive ID 5 J - USB hard drive on port 1 H - USB hard drive on port 4 I - USB CD drive on port 3 J - USB thumb drive on port 2 ( note has lower priority than hard drives or CDs despite lower port number ) N - networked hard drive ( if it has a letter , you set it up , or the network admin did ) note out of sequence lettering P - personal network share that you set up	St
1.13.1	You can have your external drive mount itself into a directory whenever you plug it in -- at least in Windows xp pro .	St
1.13.2	Plug the drive in .	St
1.13.3	Right click & quot ; My Computer & quot ; and select & quot ; Manage & quot ; Select & quot ; Storage & quot ; , then & quot ; Disk Management & quot ; Right click the external drive and select & quot ; Change Drive Letter and Paths & quot ; Click the & quot ; Change & quot ; button Select the option & quot ; Mount in the following empty NTFS folder & quot ; and type in the path to the folder you want to use .	St
1.13.4	( Obviously your internal drive needs to be NTFS ... You 're still using fat32 ?	Ques
1.13.5	For shame ! )	St
1.13.6	Whenever you plug in the external drive , it will mount to the selected folder .	St
1.13.7	I stumbled on this by accident one day .	St
1.13.8	Your drive might need to be NTFS for it to work .	St
1.13.9	Any existing files in the directory will be unavailable , but should show up again after you unmount the external drive .	St
1.14.1	why do n't you name your external drives ?	Ques
1.14.2	I was frustrated !	St
1.14.3	I have 4 external drives and had a hard time telling one from another ; so I have named each drive ( music , photos , movies , artwriting ) and it has done the job .	St
1.14.4	Misha	St
1.15.1	I do this and have found that if I have a separate PORT for each drive and always plug THAT drive into THAT port and no other drive into that port , then the letters remain the same .	St
1.15.2	I think the drive assignment is for the PORT ( usb , firewire , whatever ) , not necessarily for the drive .	St
1.15.3	Maggie	St
1.16.1	I found this in one of my & quot ; support & quot ; folders .	St
1.16.2	I copied it from somewhere - never tried it ... Can I Assign a Drive Letter to a Removable Disk ?	Ques
1.16.3	Question : I 'd like to know if it is possible to & quot ; Reserve & quot ; a drive letter for my removable disk .	St
1.16.4	Is this possible ?	Ques
1.16.5	- David W. Answer : You can assign a permanent drive letter for a removable drive such as a flash memory drive .	St
1.16.6	Here 's how : Log on with an administrator account .	St
1.16.7	Right click My Computer and select Manage .	St
1.16.8	In the management console 's left pane , expand the Storage node and click Disk Management .	St
1.16.9	In the top right pane , right click the disk to which you want to assign a permanent drive letter and select Change Drive Letter and Paths .	St
1.16.10	Click Change and assign the desired drive letter .	St
1.16.11	Click OK .	St
1.17.1	you my friend are a genius ... thank you depage ... much appreciated ...	Polite
1.18.1	... and no need for extra software .	St
1.18.2	I needed to get the disk containing My Documents back to F : and this worked perfectly .	St
1.18.3	Did just have to unplug a device to which Windows had already assigned the letter F : so as to make that letter available , but that was all .	St
1.18.4	Many thanks Anna !	Polite
1.19.1	That 's not a solution .	St
1.19.2	If you unplug the external hard drive and plug in some memory reader ( 4-5 letters to assign ) , the system will ignore your previous setting and steal the letter back .	St
1.19.3	If you assigned L to your external hard drive , unplug it and plug in the memory reader , and the last occupied letter was G , then it will take the next 5 letters : HIJKL .	St
1.19.4	Then L will not be available for the external hard drive .	St
1.19.5	Even after you unplug the memory reader .	St
1.19.6	The computer will give it either M ( if the memory reader is plugged in ) or H .	St
1.20.1	As folk learn , this area is a minefield .	St
1.20.2	And if you think you knew where all the mines were , next day new mines were added .	St
1.20.3	Bob	St
1.21.1	My issue is the same ... but different..LOL I have a cavalry ED and an Adata ED .	St
1.21.2	when I try and access them both , they both assign themselves the same letters to mount each time , OK so far ( F and G ) - BUT when I log in to them ( via a drive password ) they both open on the Z : drive ... no matter what usb ports I use , no matter the order and naturally I can only access one of them ... .the one I password into first .	St
1.21.3	I run XP sp 3 .	St
1.22.1	Those hard drive security apps are like a bomb .	St
1.22.2	Something I do n't use or go near .	St
