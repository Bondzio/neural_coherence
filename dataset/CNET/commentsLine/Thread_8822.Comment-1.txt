ok so heres the deal im running an old machine and wanted to upgrade the memory heres the specs for a start mother board: micro-star international co. ltd......ms-6577 proccesor: celeron 2.4ghz ram dimm1: elpida ebd52uc8aafa-7b 512 mb pc2100 ddr sdram (2.5-3-3-6 @ 133 mhz) (2.0-2-2-5 @ 100 mhz) dimm2: micron tech.
8vddt3264ag-335c4 256 mb pc2700 ddr sdram (2.5-3-3-7 @ 166 mhz) (2.0-3-3-6 @ 133 mhz) graphics card: nvidia geforce fx 5500 (256 mb) ok so i got 768mb of ram running at the speeds above, i recently brought a 1gb pc2700 stick to upgrade and put along side the 512mb pc2100 stick i allready have.
now i added the 1gb stick and i got the beeping noise that lasts for 5 seconds(2 second interval) now to my knowledge this is a memory error but on the msi website(the maker of my moterboard) it says that pc2700 is compatible!
the only other thing i could think of is the high and low density compatibility issue??????
is my motherboard high density ram compatible???
the new ram i brought is high density, could this be the problem???
also the 1gb ram boots up along side the 512mb ram in the 1 slot (but not the other way round) and shows up as 7968mb!!!!!
but then none of the ram works and uses the mother board ram of 32mb
