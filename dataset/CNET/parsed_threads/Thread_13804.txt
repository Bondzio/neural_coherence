<s> I have an e machine desktop thats about 6yrs old. </s>
<s> I have an internal seagate 100gb hdd ata 100. so I assum it's a eide or pata. </s>
<s> cpu specs: intel celeron D 352, 3.20ghz/533mhz fsb, nvidia 8400 gs 512mb video card, 2gb ram, dvd rom/cd r+w, 10/100 ethernet 512kb l2cache. </s>
<s> I had installed a wd 320gb, worked for a while but kept going in and out. </s>
<s> I put ubuntu on it and it recogzied the 320gb but couldn't play any our of pc games. </s>
<s> I have been looking for a seagate 500gb to put in but can't find one. </s>
<s> When I tried to install the WD, it said no hard drive found. </s>
<s> So I thought maybe it was a compatibilty issue between manufactuers. </s>
<s> anyone have any suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Did you learn about drive jumpers and the differences of 40 and 80 Conductor cables? </s>
<s> I find most folk try to avoid learning such and end up at repair counters. </s>
<s> Be sure to tell all about these two items and my hint is to use the newer 80 conductor cable next time. </s>

<s> I tried all the WD jumper setting according to the manual and now my present hdd is on the middle connector of the cable which is gray. </s>
<s> My cable does have a red stripe on one side of it. </s>
<s> Then you would know that on CS and if you can't accept CS then only the SLAVE setting is acceptable on the middle connector on 80 conductor IDE. </s>
<s> But then again I'm duplicating the web on that. </s>
