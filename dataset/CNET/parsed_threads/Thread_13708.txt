<s> Hi, I have a problem using my build in modem of my notebook Sony Vaio PCG-R600 HFPD. </s>
<s> It's a Connexant K56V Data Fax modem. </s>
<s> I am running Win XP SP2. </s>
<s> It works goot until I install new software with hardware. </s>
<s> After that every time I try to connect, I can hear the dialing tones from the modem, but nothing happens: it can not acces outside line ore another line - the line is like death. </s>
<s> Can somebody help? </s>
