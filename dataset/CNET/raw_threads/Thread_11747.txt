So now my printer, MP3 player and External hardrive aren't recognised when they are plugged in. This has happened without them being removed or in any way altered. I run Windows XP SP2 and all unused USB ports in the device manager claim they are working properly, however when i get to the &quot;unkown device&quot; (my printer and.or external hardrive - both are listed as unknown devices) I get told the drivers aren't installed - yet when i try to intall them the computer won't recognise the device i want to install drivers to..........any ideas?

It wouldn't recognise the printer and external h/d and just came back at a random time - which doesnt help because i dont what the cause is!
