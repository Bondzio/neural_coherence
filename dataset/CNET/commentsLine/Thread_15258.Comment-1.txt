i have an emachine t5026, had it for about 2 years.
if you look at the cnet reviews the big flaw with it is it has no agp or pci-express slot.
my question is should i just get a regular pci graphics card or upgrade my motherboard, which means i would be upgrading my cpu to a dual core(just because i want one) and would need new memory.
are regular pci graphics card any good, i know that the pci-express is the current technology, but would i be able to get by maybe another year and just use my free pci slot.
thanks
