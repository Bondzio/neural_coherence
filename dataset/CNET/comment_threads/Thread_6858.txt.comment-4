http://forums11.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do?threadId=1104549 I won't rewrite this but the public has been dealt a bad hand here.
Let me say that the above link does work and the method of installing the printer driver first then changing the CONNECTION later.
If you feel the method you are using must work (it doesn't!)
then you have to deal with HP, Microsoft and a few dead popes.
I don't expect any of those 3 groups to respond.
