you can pop in a knoppix cd and it will run qemu then linux and while windows me is running you could access the ntfs volume.
but the glacial speed would test anyone i know.
so while not impossible the solution is likely too slow for any practical reason.
why not boot linux and copy out the files you want to the windows me hard disk?
