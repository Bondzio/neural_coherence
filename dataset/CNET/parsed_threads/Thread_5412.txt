<s> Hi there, I have an Acer Aspire 5610 laptop. </s>
<s> Windows died recently and if I use the Acer recovery program I will lose the contents of my hard drives - something I am very keen to avoid. </s>
<s> So I got my hands on a Windows XP Pro CD and have installed Windows. </s>
<s> The problem is now I cannot for the life of me get it to recognize my Maxtor USB external hard drive. </s>
<s> I've installed every little thing I can find on the Acer/Intel/Microsoft/Maxtor websites etc but still nothing. </s>
<s> I've tried uninstalling the USB ports and reinstalling them - still nothing. </s>
<s> I've checked device manager to see if it's recognized but not mapping correctly - it's not in device manager. </s>
<s> I went into my BIOS to ensure that USB was enabled and it's not an option in the menu (I have PhoenixBIOS). </s>
<s> I have tested the External Hard Drive on other PC's and it works fine. </s>
<s> When I plug it into my notebook it plays the sound to say it's recognized a USB input and then the USB symbol displays in the Task Bar with the Message &quot;Device Not Recognized&quot; - what can I do to get this to work - I've spent 26 hours so far and nothing has worked and it would take me forever to back 120GB onto DVDs! </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Microsoft's XP CDs and many others don't have the drivers. </s>
<s> Here's what I do when I need to save an owner's files. </s>
<s> I boot up one of our collection of LiveCD's that have Linux on them (you don't need to know Linux!) </s>
<s> and I can look at the files and then copy then off to some USB hard disk or over to our network (usually via ethernet). </s>
<s> Getting that XP working may or may not be possible. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Are the laptop drivers available on acer.com? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I know nothing about Linux - if I install a Linux Operating System will that support USB?? </s>
<s> I've already downloaded some drivers from acer but they haven't made a difference sadly. </s>
<s> The current CDs I use most often is UBUNTU and PCLINUXOS 2007. </s>
<s> These do not touch your current hard disk so you can look around without any commitment. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Something new to try - it's exciting because there is pretty much nowhere to go with Windows it seems! </s>
<s> So how do I use the programs?? </s>
<s> Like I said I know nothing of Unix. </s>
<s> And where do I find them? </s>
<s> As to use, you double click on my computer and ... well you get the idea. </s>
