if you are mainly doing 2d or text, the memory that is &quot;dedicated&quot; is one or two memory chips soldered on the motherboard that are indeed dedicated to the use of only the graphics controller portion of the chip.
dynamically, when 3d graphics or higher screen resolution demands it' is can take some memory away from the operating system and use it as video memory.
it's pretty much exactly what it says it is, and it's usually substantially faster than system memory (for technical reasons that would probably bore you).
a 6150 chipset with 128meg (or 64meg) of dedicated video memory will perform substantially better than a 6150 with shared video memory, and have more memory available to the operating system and the running processes.
