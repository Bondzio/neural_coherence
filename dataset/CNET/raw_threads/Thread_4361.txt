I have a switch that transfers 200mbps, and a cat6 cable that can transfer 200mbps also. Does that mean i just need to find an ethernet port to connect up to 200mbps?

All this will not help your internet gameplay but would help in copying files and such to/from machines in your LAN. For gamers, they want a wired connection to the DSL/Cable modem and even they they'll complain on just about any laptop made. Bob

You connection from your ISP doesnt even come close to maxing out the 10/100 card your using. At the most your ISP is likely putting out 10mbps, and your ethernet card can handle 100mbps. Going to a gigabit switch will only help transfering files from PC to PC, not the internet speeds. Hope this helps.
