1.1.1	My daughter is moving into an apartment complex that is supplying wi-fi for the whole complex.	St
1.1.2	She has a 3-4 year old Dell desktop and has been using cable for her internet.	St
1.1.3	What is the best way for her to connect to the wi-fi, USB adapter or a pci card also, would it pay her to purchase 802.11n draft or 802.11g.	St
1.2.1	if a slot is provided.	St
1.2.2	They're easy to install and configure and they stay firmly parked in the laptop.	St
1.2.3	802.11g should be fine.	St
1.2.4	There won't be an advantage with the n draft...especially if it's not implemented in the apartment complex.	St
1.3.1	when he turned that desktop into a laptop.	St
1.3.2	That said, get a PCI wireless NIC for the desktop, stay away from USB units.	St
1.3.3	He is correct in that unless the complex provides -N, just stick with -G. Unless you can find a -N unit on sale as they are backward compatible.	St
1.3.4	Wayne Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, Internet connections, Spyware removal, and download free software (and a GREAT chocolate-cherry cobbler recipe).	St
1.3.5	There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't.	St
1.4.1	PCI of the type that has a detachable antenna and cable that's not fixed to the card will be less limiting as you can move the antenna for best signal strength	St
1.5.1	I disagree about the G vs N....always get the best technology you can afford....cuz if she moves and the next place has N and she wants more speed, she'll have to cough up more cash...what a waste.	St
1.5.2	and she has more flexibility with wi-fi usb...she can just pull it out and nobody can surf for garbage when she is not around	St
