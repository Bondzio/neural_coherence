<s> Looking to buy a tablet pretty soon here. </s>
<s> Any recommendations on Brand or model. </s>
<s> I'm looking for something mainly for business use that's reliable and fast. </s>
<s> And different businesses have different needs. </s>
<s> The only business use I've seen: colleagues using their iPad to read their mail and make short notes during meetings. </s>
<s> They like that it is lighter than a laptop. </s>

<s> We looked at many tablets and really the only three we would consider would be- Asus Transformer Apple iPad2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 All three are very fast. </s>
<s> The two different operating systems both have their pros and their cons, so really neither is a better choice, other than which one you prefer. </s>
<s> Those three should give you a very good starting point. </s>
<s> That's got to be the one, the iPad by Apple. </s>
