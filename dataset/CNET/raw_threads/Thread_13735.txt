And I would be guessing if I guessed you were asking about some backup software but to delete a folder in Explorer is pretty basic for a Windows user. They click on the folder then tap the Delete key. Bob

HD	Sorry I didn't make that clear.I can't find how to delete a back up folder on the western digital external hard drive.The only reference is to right click on the drive icon and click &quot;format&quot;on the drop down menu.All I have stored on this external drive at present is my &quot;music folder&quot;

Again, I would have to guess if there was some backup application in play here. I don't use any that come with drives since I found them buggy, trouble, and proprietary. Bob

Are you using the Windows 7 backup program, the WD supplied backup program, something else, what? Personally I've been using Norton Ghost for the last 8 years and haven't had the first problem with it. You can get it for next to nothing if you watch the sales. Another good alternative is Easeus todo backup free which you can download from http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm . Good luck.
