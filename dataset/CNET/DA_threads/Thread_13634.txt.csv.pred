1.1.1	I have a Sony Playstation 2 and want to hook it up to my home wireless network .	St
1.1.2	The only problem is that you can only plug cat5 cable to the network adapter of the PS2 and I do n't know of any wireless recivers that you can hook up via cat5 .	St
1.1.3	I have only seen USB ones , and ones that you put directly in your computer .	St
1.1.4	Can anybody tell me how to get my PS2 hooked up to my wireless network ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thank You !	St

1.2.1	Try this unit : http : //www.linksys.com/products/product.asp ? grid=33 & scid=38 & prid=550	St
1.3.1	Use Apple 's Airport Express to connect to an existing wireless network using an ethernet cable .	St
1.4.1	There are a few solutions that might work .	St
1.4.2	The first one is pretty obvious and most people do n't want to do this , but you could get a really long ethernet cable ( CAT5 ) and run the cable from your router to your PS2 .	St
1.4.3	Or you can share your internet connection from a computer in your house that is already on the wireless network ( I do n't know how to do this , but i believe it is possible ) .	St
1.4.4	Also Linksys makes a Wireless ethernet bridge , which connects to an ethernet port on a game console , or computer and sends and receives information via the wireless network ( http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp ? id=1056281391242 & skuId=5732889 & type=product ) has one but it is expensive .	St
1.4.5	There is also the WET11 Linksys wireless ethernet bridge , but I do n't currently have a link to that .	St
1.4.6	I bet it is easy to find .	St
1.4.7	I believe that is cheaper as well .	St
1.4.8	Hope this helps	St
1.5.1	Hello , The best way to connect your PS2 to the wireless network is via a WiFi repeater as is sold in the store Pixinf .	St
1.5.2	This device lets you connect your PS2 to the wireless network anywhere on the home and increases the signal range of existing wireless network .	St
1.5.3	Works for me perfectly and also use to connect the TV to the Internet .	St
