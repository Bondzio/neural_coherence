1.2.1	With just XP , USB 2.0 is not supported .	St
1.2.2	With XP SP1 , USB 2.0 started to function but we couldh't run CHKDSK on the USB 2.0 hard disk .	St
1.2.3	Finally with XP SP2 we could run CHKDSK on out USB 2.0 hard disks .	St
1.2.4	Your post did n't note the SP1 or SP2 and many wo n't install SP2 ( their choice ) .	St
1.2.5	I can only share that some fixes were in SP2 but I ca n't find a document revealing what Microsoft fixed .	St
1.2.6	This is not an offer to fix your issue , but a comment about SP1 , SP2 and how it matters in USB 2.0 Bob	St
1.3.1	I had a similar problem with almost the exact same hardware ( D610 instead of the D600 ) .	St
1.3.2	My problem was intermittent in that sometimes my computer could recognize both USB devices at the same time , but most of the time it could n't ( very infuriating ) .	St
1.3.3	I believe I 've fixed it by uninstalling Itunes and Ipod updater , installing the latest Bios Update and the Dell Notebook System Software , and reinstalling itunes and ipod .	St
1.3.4	Go to http : //support.dell.com/support/downloads/ select you computer and OS and find both updates under the following : FlashBIOS Updates Dell Latitude D610 System BIOS System and Configuration Utilities Dell Notebook System Software Hopes this helps I finally came upon this solution after trying everything else on the apple website .	St
1.4.1	I too have a dell and when the external hard drive is plugged in and i connect the ipod the hard drive locks up .	St
1.4.2	my Dell can still detect them both but the hard drive becomes useless because I can not move any files that are related to the external hard drive around , and the point of having one was because i have to much music to store on the regular computer .	St
1.4.3	I tried updating my computer by installing & quot ; USB 2.0 driver version 2.7 & quot ; but when i restarted the computer the problem still existed .	St
1.4.4	I would appreciate it greatly if anyone knows what to do .	Polite
1.5.1	As I noted there is no USB 2.0 support in XP .	St
1.5.2	I noted when it appeared .	St

1.5.4	There are some that do not want to install SP1 , SP2 or SP3 .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	This has always been an issue for xp sp1 users , complaints rolled in like rapid water floods directly to MS .	St
1.6.2	The same goes with DX 10 , why not release the driver for xp ?	Ques
1.6.3	Well , mr bill wants you to buy vista , thats all .	St
1.6.4	Anyhoo , USB 2.0 is supported with any service pack , please go here http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/329632	Ques
1.7.1	Thanks for the links that validate why we ask about Service Packs .	St
1.7.2	- & gt ; Here 's another nugget .	St
1.7.3	In XP SP1 some of our external hard disks would mysteriously need a chkdsk .	St
1.7.4	After SP2 that problem vanished but we never could tell exactly where in the release documents Microsoft tweaked that .	St
