Like someone else said, check game requirements.
Obviously, the more RAM you have, the better some games will perform (Battlefield 2/2142 eat RAM alive).
Both are pretty important, since a good videocard with no ram won't really help you, and a lot of ram with a junk video card won't run some games.
