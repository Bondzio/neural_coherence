I have a Netgear WG111 v2 wireless adaptor connecting with a Netgear (cable) wireless router. I used the software provided to install it. It works, but has a lot of connection issues when rebooting and even when just surfing, it will drop connection. Question is... In my icon tray in the lower right hand tray, there are 2 connections showing. One using the Netgear adaptor software and one using (I think) the Windows wireless software (says: Wireless Network Connection 9). I've uninstalled the Netgear software and tried to run it with the Windows version with no luck, so I've had to reinstall the Netgear software. Please help, what I am I to do?

I have three network connections listed. 1.) 1394 Connection &quot;disabled, firewalled&quot; 1394 Net Adaptor 2.) Local Area Connection &quot;disabled, firewalled&quot; National Semiconductor DP83815-Based PCI Fast Ethernet Adaptor 3.) Wireless Network Connection 9 &quot;connected, firewalled&quot; Netgear WG111v2 54mps wireless USB 2.0 adaptor #10 When I click to disable in the menu,&quot;Disable&quot; is not in bold text like the rest of the options. So what your telling me is the Windows wireless connection (No. 3 above) is the one that is messing up the Netgear wireless software that's not even listed in the Networks Connections tray? Thanks so very much for your help on this and I look forward to your future replys.
