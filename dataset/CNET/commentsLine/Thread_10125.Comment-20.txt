here's a great product i just happened to see in a favorite catalog.
a pc stand w/wheels in &quot;home improvements catalog&quot; i've used this company for years for various &quot;good stuff&quot;.
#265919 mobile cpu stand $19.99.
plastic.
it adjust for width.
sets right up.
i keep my home alittle on warm side to save money.
plus three cats with lots of fur.
but i mainly got it to get my new hp media center up more to turn it on easier.
some new pcs are so small making the button waaay down there to lean over and turn it on.
(oh yeah lazy .
helps your back though.
but this has been a great help for many reasons.
the pc fan grille stays much cleaner, i can reach the button, and move the pc if i need to to vacuumn.
the room fan or air can circulate around the pc now.
it's $19.99.
i'm tight on money but this was a very worthwhile purchase for me.
never dreamed there was a stand out there.
i was searching the house for something to use.
also if you have it up higher for the new ones you can still use the top to lay your papers or current projects on handy to the pc.
i have to place my pc beside me, to the left due to lack of room but it's handy.
my old pc was so tall i could use it as a little table for current notes cds & zip drives.
i'm usualy frugal and did have an item stacked under it but this idea beats what i had.
much airier for the pc and that's the point.
hope someone else finds this stand useful too.
like i said it's really wonderful for the newer samller units especially.
