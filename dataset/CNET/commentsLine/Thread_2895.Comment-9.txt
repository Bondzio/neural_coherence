&gt; chkdsk is a little boy sent out to do a big man's job.
actually, it's an old man.
it's been around since the boot-from-floppy days.
someone mentioned the need to do a backup.
i do this twice a year (should do it more often) and my irreplaceable files, such as the pictures i've taken, are additionaly backed up onto a dvd and far away in my brother's safe.
