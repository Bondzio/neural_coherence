I realize that ATI does not yet have (to my knowledge) this exact capability, but does the GTX260/280 provide a substantial CUDA performance increase that would justify the higher price?
This is important for me, because I do a good bit of video transcoding which appears to benefit greatly from these applications that can take advantage of the GPU.
