but for years we used a board with no cpu or anything as a quick way to power up a psu and provide a small load.
the board we used was dead so it served a purpose (basic psu function test.)
if you add a cpu+heatsink and speaker then that gets us up to the beep test.
there will be no display without this plus ram and video card.
i'll stop here.
