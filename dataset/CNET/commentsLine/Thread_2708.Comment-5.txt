hi!
frankly speaking i've not bought my dlink wireless internet cameras yet.
my first step is to get a storage router which i have now.
next is to buy an external hard disk follow by the dlink wireless internet cameras.
i'm intending to set up a simple home surveillance system whereby i can see remotely and record for say 24hrs a day.
