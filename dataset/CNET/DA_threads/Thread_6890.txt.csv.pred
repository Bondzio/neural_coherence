1.2.1	Yes , you can run them side by side if you have the necessary desk space .	St
1.2.2	Assuming that you are going to buy a monitor for the G5 , then the best thing for you would be to have the two machines on a network with each other .	St
1.2.3	If your & quot ; router & quot ; is really a router and not a modem , plug each of the computers into the LAN side of the router and plug the router into the Modem .	St
1.2.4	That way , both of the machines can access the Internet at the same time .	St
1.2.5	The printer is another story .	St
1.2.6	If the printer is compatible with the Mac , see the manufacturers web site , then you can attach it to the Mac and share it .	St
1.2.7	Or the other way around .	St
1.2.8	If it is a network printer with its own ethernet connection , just plug it into the router and you can all share it .	St
1.2.9	If you are not going to buy a monitor for the G5 , then you will need a KVM switch so that you can share the Monitor , Keyboard and mouse with each machine .	St
1.2.10	Make sure that the KVM switch you get can handle USB keyboards and mouse .	St
1.2.11	Any other questions ?	Ques
