as i am sure you know, part of the regular maintenance of a computer is to clean out the dust in it every so often.
i leave my desktop computer on the floor to have more room on my desk, so it accumulates lots of dust.
i was going to use my small, portable vacuum cleaner to clean my computer but was told by a friend not to use it because it may cause static or &quot;shoot&quot; something into the computer.
when i use the small compressed air cans, it often seems like they don't have sufficient power to thoroughly clean my computer.
1) what is the best way to clean out the dust and debris in a computer?
2) can i use a portable vacuum to do the job?
thanks.
