1.3.1	http : //graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20041222/index.html the X700Pro is n't comparable to the 6600GT the X700XT is comparable to the 6600GT the X700Pro slots in between the 6600nU and the 6600GT the X600XT is comparable to the 6600nU the X600Pro is slightly slower but read that benchmarking article decide which you like	St

1.11.1	Hey , I am wondering if you can put a 6600gt or x700pro in a T6212 with factory psu ?	Ques
1.11.2	It 's 300w right ?	Ques
1.11.3	I think I read 6600gt requires 350w minimum .	St
1.11.4	The x700pro , not as good maybe but I think it only requires 300w .	St
1.11.5	But I am still not sure .	St
1.11.6	It seems to be hard to find the correct specs for all these components .	St
1.11.7	If anyone has either of these installed in their factory T6212 please respond and tell me what you have and how well it works .	Ques
1.11.8	Otherwise if you have either of these and have made modifications to the psu then I would like to hear about your machine too : P Thanks , SeaninWa	St
