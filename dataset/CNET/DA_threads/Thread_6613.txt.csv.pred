1.1.1	I have a small perplexing problem on an older desktop that has me puzzled .	St
1.1.2	The tower is running WinXP Pro , SP3 , ASUS A7N8X , AMD 1.8 Ghz CPU , 2Gb RAM , and is powered by ANTEC 350W PSU .	St
1.1.3	I have had it in service quite some time .	St
1.1.4	The problem is that the power switch does not work on the case as advertised .	St
1.1.5	When I would power on the computer , it would run momentarily , and shut off by itself .	St
1.1.6	When I started looking for the cause , I found out that the board would power up even without the front panel being connected .	St
1.1.7	I have removed the board from the case , unplugged all except fans and CPU , and as soon as the PSU is plugged in , the board powers up .	St
1.1.8	I have changed power supplies ; same results .	St
1.1.9	I am now using the tower by first turning off the rocker switch on the PSU , plugging in the power cord , resetting the rocker switch , and then pushing the front panel power switch .	St
1.1.10	I would seem at first blush that there is a power cap building up some kind of charge on the MB that prevents the board from operating normal , and by unplugging the power cord , it allows the charge to bleed off .	St
1.1.11	Other than this problem , there is nothing wrong with the system , and performs all tasks as needed , and will even restart with the front panel switch or the on screen tab .	St
1.1.12	Any comments .	St
1.2.1	I currently have a similar problem .	St
1.2.2	It will boot-up once the AC cord is plugged in .	St
1.2.3	It does however , after that turn ON/OFF by the frt .	St
1.2.4	sw. as it should .	St
1.2.5	Mine also , squeals when I pull the plug .	St
1.2.6	I guess that 's either the cap bleeding through the speaker or the cap itself .	St
1.2.7	While , I have n't found any physical damage , I live with it .	St
1.2.8	I suspect , the bios has something to do with it as there are various power-ON modes and being an older PC could reflect a less than capable component starting to fail .	St
1.2.9	Yet , so far w/o super troubleshooting , I allow it to to behave as described .	St
1.2.10	It did have a heat problem which I resolved by re-applying heatsink compound to the cpu .	St
1.2.11	I also , cleaned it well and the aftermarket 120mm fan was installed wrong , IMO .	St
1.2.12	I suspect due to heat stress that some component is easily tipped when any power is applied from AC .	St
1.2.13	-OR- it has a hot key which I yet to find .	St
1.2.14	This was an older gaming PC and I think its showing it had better days .	St
1.2.15	If you like remove the frt .	St
1.2.16	panel ON/OFF connection and see if it works w/o it attached .	St
1.2.17	If it does you have a similar problem .	St
1.2.18	The sw. needs only to momentarily be touched at connection contacts to power-ON/OFF , check it out .	St
1.2.19	The other half of a bad PSU is the logic ON/OFF ckt .	St
1.2.20	which is part of ATX setup being part of the mtrbd .	St
1.2.21	You really ca n't fix it in most cases as its mtrbd .	St
1.2.22	issue .	St
1.2.23	S the components are SMC type , it gets to be too much and getting parts is another issue .	St
1.2.24	Unless , you want to play with it , check the mtrbd .	St
1.2.25	main power leads for any discoloration and/or shorts , etc. , these need not be great short , but a simple bent over lead , etc..	St
1.2.26	I use magnifying glass as these truly have to be viewed closely .	St
1.2.27	A logic probe or Oscope helps too .	St
1.2.28	tada -- -- -Willy	St
