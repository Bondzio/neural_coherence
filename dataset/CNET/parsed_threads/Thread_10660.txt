<s> Hi all,I'm looking for a little imput.I want a really good cpu cooler and just can't decide what to buy,money is not a problem.I just want a really good cooler.I've looked at alot of coolers even one that the US government use's but I'm just not happy with what I'm seeing,My tower is a coolermaster so size doesn't matter,I'll even mod the tower if needed.What I really want is looks and a cold system,I'd go with liquid nitrogen but its just not good to look at.So any ideas,my system is Win7 64 bit 8 gig ram 1366 support for 16 gig CPU Amd black Phenom II x4 with 5 H/D's total 5TB I'm over clocked but just a little lol So anyone!! </s>
<s> Please remmber I want COLD and good looks.... </s>
<s> while you only give us confusing details on your system specs; an AMD Phenom II x4 running on an LGA1366 motherboard (perhaps you could provide us with the precise details of your system specs), 5 HDD's total (RAID ? </s>
<s> ), no video card specs ? </s>
<s> Anyways...here are 2 places to start if considering liquid cooling http://www.frozencpu.com/cat/l1/g30/Liquid_Cooling.html and http://www.dangerden.com/store/ </s>

<s> Yup its in and my system is running 10c cooler even after gaming for two hrs,I've not found my average temp but it seems to stay at 31c I'm just starting to set up an overclock so after a week testing I'll post my results.Oh and the pricing of this unit was very good $79 Yup very happy so far!! </s>
<s> Thanks again for helping me find what I was looking for. </s>
<s> download it, install it and minimize it. </s>
<s> It then displays the system, CPU and core temps in the upper right hand corner. </s>
<s> Very handy utility for the temps and other system info. </s>
<s> Enjoy. </s>

<s> Download what? </s>
<s> ?I went to the web site I saw nothing to install?? </s>
<s> have I missed something?I'm using Vcore for my testing! </s>

<s> Thanks lookn at it now,so far so good with temps ran the system pushing to a heavy load running one game TF2 and 4 live video programs for 4 hrs,max temps hit CPU 39c M/B 30-31c @2800Mhz test 2 went 2884 Mhz 12 hr test heavy load no gaming but 5 video feeds temps went,cpu 30c m/b 30c all ambiant temps were steadly at 27c.not going to be posting for a few days I'd like to conenttrate on pushing this baby lol Could you direct me to a good fan speed controller?incase(must support min 7 fans) or as a program! </s>

<s> I've been setting clocks,my last clock setting I set at 2884mhz and it ran very well,This morning I checked the settings and the clock had changed by its self!! </s>
<s> Its now up to 3024mhz self clock,how?why?what would cause this? </s>
<s> ?I'm not worried to much,the system is fine and all the temps went down,this is strange my M/B temp is at 27c and CPU is at 32c after running a load max temps hit 34c M/B 40 CPU @ clock of 2884 any ideas as to why the clock speed went up on its own!!! </s>
