i have the asus model and almost all documents open.
we have a few that didn't and for that, we're back to a windows laptop or tablet.
frankly windows 8 rt is so restrictive that we can't go near that at the office.
lighten up microsoft and maybe we'll look at it again.
windows 8 rt is nice that you get office.
these tablets are not cheaper than a laptop so i wonder why you are looking at them.
what's the attraction?
lists out the tablet and dock for just under 1,000. bob
