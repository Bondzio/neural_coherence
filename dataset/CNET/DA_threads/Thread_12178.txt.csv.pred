1.1.1	Hello , This topic is an extension of a topic I recently posted called Where is my free space ? .	St
1.1.2	I followed the suggestions I received but nothing seemed to work , so I purchased a new SATA hard drive .	St
1.1.3	The previous problem is of no concern any longer , but a new issue has risen .	St
1.1.4	I will try to be short and keep this as simple as possible .	St
1.1.5	Ill be talking about 2 SATA drives that I have ( please see the image ) , Disk 0 ( D : ) and Disk 1 ( C : ) .	St
1.1.6	The NEW drive is Disk 0 ( D : ) , which I added two days ago .	St
1.1.7	Currently my OS is running on it .	St
1.1.8	Previously I used Disk 1 ( C : ) , which still has the old installation of Windows on .	St
1.1.9	The original intention I had was to install Windows on the NEW drive , then format the OLD one and use it for whatever .	St
1.1.10	When the NEW drive arrived , I unplugged the old one and plugged in the NEW one , then proceeded to install Windows .	St
1.1.11	That didnt work .	St
1.1.12	I got the following message ( or similar ) , partition table invalid .	St
1.1.13	Then I connected the OLD drive , and then I was able to start installation of Windows on my NEW drive .	St
1.1.14	After I finished installing Windows , I proceeded to format my OLD drive .	St
1.1.15	That did not work , because Windows sees OLD disk as a System Volume , and my NEW disk as a Boot Volume ( I do not know the difference between the two ) .	St
1.1.16	Now when I disconnect the OLD drive ( C : ) , and turn on the PC , during the boot process I get the following message : NTLDR is missing .	St
1.1.17	When you look at the picture , youll see that under Computer Management & gt ; Disk Management I do not have the options to Format , Delete Volume or Convert to Basic Disk ( I converted it to Dynamic hoping that that would change something and allow me to format the OLD drive ) .	St
1.1.18	I also tried changing Boot Priority in BIOS , putting the NEW drive as number 1 ( please remember that Windows is running from this drive ) .	St
1.1.19	When I do that , I again get the message that NTLDR is missing .	St
1.1.20	When I change Boot Priority back to the OLD drive , even though I run Windows from a different drive , I am able to boot .	St
1.1.21	So the question is : how do I get this to work and format the OLD drive ?	Ques
1.1.22	Im assuming I need to change something so the NEW drive becomes a System Volume , but how do I do this ?	Ques
1.1.23	Thank you all a lot ! ! !	St
1.1.24	XP SP2 http : //img150.imageshack.us/img150/6699/diskmanagement1tg5.jpg P.S .	St

1.3.1	HDD..	St
1.3.2	The SYSTEM DRIVE ( C : ) should be ready for installation right out of the box..Empty..but ready for a Operateing System INSTALL..	St
1.3.3	If you want to CREATE a second HDD..for FILES/FOLDERS.. You need to set the PINS to CABLE SELECT [ CS ] or even SLAVE.. .. a SATA HDD..is no differant than your Standard HDD [ IDE ] ATA.. what SATA has offered is the USE of Multiple HDD's..and eliminateng the FLAT-DATA-Cable..useing the NEW -- -- SATA Cable ... .this eliminates the Interference ... ... of the FLAT-cable between the two DRIVES.. .. SATA-cables are hooked directly to the Motherboard..via the SATA-cable..I have 4-Connectors for SATA on my Intel D915GAG Mobo ... . ..	St
1.3.4	Check the manufacturers website for INFO..	St
1.3.5	I use one SATA [ System ] and 4-Ext.HDD.. ..	St
1.3.6	The thing is its difficult to remember exactly what I set the PINS/its been running for over a year..	St
1.3.7	So you need to visit the WebSite for your Drive .	St
