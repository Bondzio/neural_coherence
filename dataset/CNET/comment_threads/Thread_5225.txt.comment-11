Thank you for your help, I guess I have to stay with the working configuration.
But then I have another question regarding the 'Fixed IP' on a couple of Laptop involved in the LAN.
Those Laptop are configured to use the ADSL with fix IP address.
What should be done to make it 'mobile' from one LAN/network environment to another (i.e.
from the adsl modem lan/network to cable modem lan/network -- or from office to home LAN/network) Thank you again for the help
