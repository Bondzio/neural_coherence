i have a freeagent pro 750gb hard drive.
i want to use the esata interface but have seemed unable to thus far.
i bought an esata cable that has 3gb/s transfer speed, along with an &quot;esata ii expresscard raid&quot; by siig, inc. i installed all the software for the card(which appears in device manager and seems to be working properly and nothing seems to work.
it doesn't show that i have a drive connected at all.
it seems to work fine with usb but not with my esata connection.
this is the secong kind of card i have tried so i don't know what else to do.
i have a laptop that runs windows xp media center.
