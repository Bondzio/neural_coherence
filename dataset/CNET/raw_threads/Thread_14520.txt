What problems will I run into by setting my old hard drive up as a slave. Old system has 1g memory and has Win ME, new HD has Win XP.

If the XP drive already has your cdrom on it as a slave, then the slave drive will be jumpered as cable select or Master/Single on the Secondary IDE controller instead. Once you get to the XP desktop and get into Windows Explorer, you will see the slave drive as D even if your current XP drive is partitioned because the slave drive has a Primary Dos Partition on it....all XP partitions will drop down one drive letter from where they were before but that will be OK for most things to keep working right because XP will correct the paths in the registy. The only things that might need to be corrected will be shortcuts to programs that look for the cd to start them...you can correct those shortcuts easily by right clicking and changing the drive letter ONLY to point to the correct cdrom drive letter if you have to. You will NOT be able to run ME as a second operating system even though it's still installed on the slave drive. This information is to let you know that you will have access to files on the slave drive once it's hooked up. You can then drag and drop what you want to save from that slave drive to the XP drive in Windows Explorer, then when you have saved everything you want to keep, right click the D drive and choose FORMAT and it will empty that drive out completely. Then you can drag stuff you want to save back to that slave drive from the XP drive and store them there to burn to cd later or whatever and still have access to them. TONI
