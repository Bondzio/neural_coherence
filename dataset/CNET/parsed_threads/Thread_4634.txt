<s> etc. </s>
<s> I thought I would post some comments in regards to my recent experiences with Dell. </s>
<s> SORRY IF THIS IS TOO LONG... </s>
<s> I cannot say if my purchase is &quot;better&quot; than it would of been with other places,or if Dell is &quot;the best&quot; - I do not feel qualified enough for that since this is only my 3rd pc I have bought in 14 years (the other two being for me, both from a local custom builder place). </s>
<s> BUT what I can do is simply tell everyone how my Dell experience went and MY OPINION of it. </s>
<s> Quick background - if you have seen my other posts over the last week + I was looking for a &quot;good&quot; pc for my mom, but did not need to be some super system. </s>
<s> OVERALL I cannot be more pleased so far. </s>
<s> I found the prices quite low, the web site easy to use, the options on PC's and configurations virtually endless, and the customer service area (sales) very helpful and nice. </s>
<s> So far I have LOVED DELL!!! </s>
<s> After reviewing multiple posts and reviews, looking at various prices and configurations, keeping the needs of my mom in mind, and ultimately going with my gut I DID order a Dell Demension 3000 with the P4 3.0MGz HT, 512 ram, 80 gb hd etc. </s>
<s> Got the whole thing with a monitor and printer, tax, shipping etc for $465 (under $500 for a mid to upper P4 with HT tech and printer, and monitor - that I think is great) I set the whole PC up online, then while I could of ordered right then and there I had a few quick questions, so I called the 800 #, got a rep in about 2 minutes max, she pulled my cart up, answered my questions and then I decided to order away. </s>
<s> I placed the order Tuesday at 8:30pm. </s>
<s> I did have a custom built system. </s>
<s> They built it Wednesday, shipped it that evening, and TODAY (Friday) I got it delivered to my door. </s>
<s> Ordered a custom machine on Tuesday night, at the door Friday - I think that is incredible. </s>
<s> Fired the puppy up this evening, and so far so good. </s>
<s> I will admit I have not done anything real on it yet except boot it up, it will be off to my mom's tomorrow for her to use. </s>
<s> Anyway, to summarize, great prices, tons of options to customize, easy to order, helpful sales folks (or at least mine was) and delivered in 3 days after I ordered the thing. </s>
<s> ONLY advice I have is to watch the various sales, they change often (sometimes each day) and depending on what you want waiting 3-7 days may help you. </s>
<s> For example, if you have a great printer but need a new monitor, at the beginning of the week they were giving away a free basic printer, or allowing you credit that towards a nicer one. </s>
<s> BUT the last few days instead they have had a free 15 &quot; flat panel. </s>
<s> Earlier the special would not of helped you if you have a nice printer, but the later sales would. </s>
<s> I obviously have not had a tech issue yet, I promise that if I do have issues and my opinion goes south after dealing with tech support (which I heard MAY be a different experience) I will follow up on this post SO - when I buy my next pc (maybe in the fall or around Christmas)unless something blows up in the interium I seem the be a pretty big Dell fan for now... </s>

<s> you're having such a good experience with Dell, Chip. </s>
<s> I truly believe that Dell is &quot;capable&quot; of making good computers and providing good support...and I'll be watching for your updates. </s>
<s> Who knows? </s>
<s> Maybe things are finally changing at Dell. </s>
<s> Maybe all the complaints and the lawsuit are having the desired effect! </s>
<s> Could it be that...gasp...one day, we might all be able to order a Dell without fear of &quot;Going to Hell&quot;? </s>

<s> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.) </s>
<s> I'm sure your mother is happy with the computer you purchased for her. </s>
<s> I guess the only thing we can go by is our own experience. </s>
<s> My experience has been fine with my Dell. </s>
<s> I had a Gateway and it was your worse nightmare. </s>
<s> After the first month I had a rebuilt computer. </s>
<s> Everything went out, speakers, mother board (2 not the first month), power pack. </s>
<s> Finally bought a new one that I had built from a local dealer. </s>
<s> Nightmare again so I paid a restocking fee 3 weeks later for him to take it back. </s>
<s> I gave him my old PC plus his charges to fix the computer so I decided to count my losses. </s>
<s> Then I ordered a Dell in fear and trimbeling. </s>
<s> Thank goodness I lucked out as far as it is still working and I have had it since Dec. 13, 2004. </s>
<s> The only reason I ordered a Dell is because I knew a lot of people who had one and seemed pleased. </s>
<s> Anyway glad to hear when people have pleasant experiences with their computers no matter where they purchase one. </s>
<s> If I was a teck I would build my own and fix it. </s>
