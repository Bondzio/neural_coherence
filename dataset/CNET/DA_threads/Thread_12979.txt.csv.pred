1.1.1	I have a Dell 4550 running a P4 2.6 with 1 gig of ram.	St
1.1.2	My current video card is a GeForce4 ti4800 AGP.	St
1.1.3	The card has been wonderful and I play almost all games with video settings maxed out.	St
1.1.4	I've been wanting to get a new video card simply because I can't play games like Battlefield2 because the GeForce4 isn't DirectX 9 compliant (or something along those lines).	St
1.1.5	Can anyone recommend a good card that would work for me?	Ques
1.1.6	I'm looking to spen around $150-$250.	St
1.1.7	I've been looking at a GeForce 6800, but to be honest, I can't sort out the different models too well.	St
1.1.8	I have a 4x AGP controller.	St
1.1.9	On a simple level, will I be seeing any improvement going to an 8x card?	St
1.2.1	Yeah, I believe a 6800 is your best bet when it comes to a AGP slot.	St
1.2.2	This seems like a very nice one.	St
1.2.3	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130268	St
1.3.1	Or if your for little more power this would be a very nice addition and it seems to be in your price range.	St
1.3.2	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121216 Especially for BF2, which is a keeper to put in the video game library.	St
