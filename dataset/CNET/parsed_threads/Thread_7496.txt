<s> I already have the case(standard mid-atx Antec with front firewire/USB 2.0 plugs). </s>
<s> Do I need a certain type of motherboard to be able to connect the front Firewire(IEEE 1394a/b)? </s>
<s> Or will all standard mobo's have the pins to connect it correctly? </s>
<s> I have been building PC's for a while now, so I know all the basics. </s>
<s> I'm just not sure what to buy for this. </s>
<s> is on the front cable? </s>
<s> Some are simply those that one feeds through the a hole in the rear and plug into the rear connectors. </s>
<s> Others are the small black connectors that plug into the mobo. </s>
<s> When you consider buying a mobo, don't you take the time to read what it contains/supports? </s>
<s> it's all there in black and white, or whatever colors you prefer. </s>
<s> They even provide pictures, and you can even download the manual to read before you consider buying. </s>
<s> Or go to http://www.tomshardware.com and read details on all of the motherboards that support the CPU/Chipset that you are interested in. </s>
<s> I always do alot of research before I buy anything. </s>
<s> I've found the motherboards that specifically state that they support frontside IEEE 1394/firewire... so if it doesn't have the the fire controller it won't work? </s>
<s> Someone told me that the standard front-side connectors on mobo's could support firewire. </s>
<s> I don't think that's true, but since it came from a usually trustworthy source I thought I would verify this. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> support firewire. </s>
<s> You are totally correct to double check I'm looking at two right now that do not support it in the front. </s>
<s> Lot's od USB though. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> mixed up between mobo and case. </s>
<s> If the mobo has the firewire pins on the mobo surface, it will certainly support firewire in the chipset or a separate chip. </s>
<s> And you have a case that supports it, so then you will simply enable it in the BIOS Fire wire is slowly becoming a standard along with USB. </s>
<s> Remember it is a Mac development and MS still doesn't acknowledge it. </s>
<s> They call it i[something]. </s>
<s> MFRs don't like offending MS. LOL </s>
<s> I wouldn't get a new MB just to get Firewire, but just get a firewire PCI card. </s>
<s> Since I have some older ATX cases that don't have front USB or Firewire ports I got a 5 1/4&quot; drive filer that had both, the cables go throught the caes, out the back and plug into the rear usb and firewire ports. </s>
<s> Dose the job, cost $10. </s>
