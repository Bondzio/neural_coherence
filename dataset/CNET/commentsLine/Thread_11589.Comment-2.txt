it can be the monitor or video card but most likely is the monitor itself.
the only way to rule out the card is with a known good monitor, however.
if you are certain the problem is a broken pin on a connector, it is possible to replace the cord but it depends on your comfort level and related expertise with electronics.
i have replaced a cord but few here would recommend it as you will be in the proximity of a very high electrical charge on the envelope of the crt.
you will need to know about wire stripping, splicing and have good soldering skills.
you will need to be resourceful in finding a proper replacement cord.
an extension cable might work but may not be the best quality or properly shielded.
you will need to know the pin outs (which pin/wire carries which signal) or have access to and know how to use an ohmmeter or dvm to make sure the rewiring is done correctly.
it's not the same as replacing an ac cord by any means but can be done.
i doubt this offers much encouragement but hope it answers some of your questions.
good luck.
