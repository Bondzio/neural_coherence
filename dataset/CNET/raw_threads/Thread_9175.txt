There is a spot on the motherboard for a serial drive cable, but there are no extra power cables. On the C drive which is SATA, they have take one of the power cables from a DVD drive and put in a splitter. The manual that came with this PC shows that you can add another drive on the bottom of the case, so it can be added. Thanks Doug
