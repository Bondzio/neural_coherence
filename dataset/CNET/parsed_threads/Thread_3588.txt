<s> I have a SimpleDrive external drive (160 GB) that suddenly stopped being recognized by my Mac. </s>
<s> I've tried changing the usb cord and connecting it to my iBook G4 but get the same result. </s>
<s> It's being recognized in the system profiler, but not as it is usually listed and it's not showing up on my desktop. </s>
<s> All it does is flash the blue activity LED. </s>
<s> Can someone please help me with this. </s>
<s> I have a lot (basically everything) saved on this drive and it is very important information. </s>
<s> If the drive cannot be fixed is there at least a way I can get the files off or transferred to another drive? </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP!!! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> Yes. </s>
<s> I used both usb cables and still no luck. </s>
<s> All it does is flash the blue LED and the red power LED stays on. </s>
<s> The top of this forum has a sticky but all I can suggest from that is to put the HDD into a desktop or a good USB case. </s>
