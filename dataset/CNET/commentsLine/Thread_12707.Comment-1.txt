hi.
i have a laptop which is the only computer i use.
i get internet via unsecured wireless connection from my friend who lives next to my house.
it's been working just fine over months.
but about a week ago i started to get error: &quot;there is ip address conflict with another system on the network&quot;.
as i mentioned i don't have any routers.
i tried to renew ip address via ipconfig, reinstalled drivers for all network cards, and finally decided to reinstall windows.
i erased all info and formatted all drives.
in the middle of windows installation i got exactly the same message.
it finished installing, and needles to say i have the same issue.
i tried to connect via another laptop - it works just fine.
please help!
