as to printer servers those are from linksys, netgear and such.
however i find these too hard to setup for most owners.
even i was taken aback following a 15 plus foldout sheet of instructions.
while you could research wifi print servers, you seem to want more support than i'm seeing in the field.
i'd contact a geeksquad and ask &quot;how much to get it working?&quot; bob
