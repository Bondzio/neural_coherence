<s> My residence and office are close but not close enough. </s>
<s> I would like to share the Internet access and eliminate one bill but the distance is straightline about 300 meters(1000 ft). </s>
<s> There is not a lot of structure between the two places but some. </s>
<s> Been trying to figure out how to boost signal from one to the ohter to make the connection but the information is hard to decipher without an EE degree. </s>
<s> I was figuring one would have to either buy a significantly upgraded attenna for the router and an WAP whose antenna can similarly be boosted, since receving and and transmitting is generally desirable. </s>
<s> Or am I talking about so much power that I fall into a category that requires a license? </s>
<s> Thanks Phil </s>
<s> Go get a pair of CANTENNAs (see google) and some bridges (see google.) </s>

<s> Hi there, I had the same problem about 2 yrs ago. </s>
<s> I cured the issue by using 2 biquad antennas. </s>
<s> Then I made it even better by combining the remote computers biquad with an old DirecTv dish (Raises biquad gain to about 30db) Then,If you use a dish on both ends you can up the range even further (as much as 8-10 miles with clear terrain) Anyway, I'm getting a full speed connection at an excess of 700ft with the router antenna mounted inside and the dish on the remote system outside. </s>
<s> So I'm going through walls and trees and still getting a very reliable connection. </s>
<s> It worked so well that I started manufacturing and selling the biquads. </s>
<s> I've sold well over 100 of them, with nothing but excellent feedback from the buyers. </s>
<s> Get them here, or follow the link on this page to ebay. </s>
<s> www.thewifipro.net I know this will help. </s>
