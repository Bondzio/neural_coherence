you can do that.
however, it makes sense to assure that anything else on that same ac line is reduced.
meaning, all devices shouldn't all be connected as well, it just helps to reduce the strain.
not knowing how your ac current behaves in your area should make you get a &quot;surge protector&quot; as to help protect that circuit as a minimum.
getting a ups will be helpful at a later time when you can.
