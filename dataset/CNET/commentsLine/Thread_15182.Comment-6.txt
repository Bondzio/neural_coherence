i read the manual when i first got the computer.
it doesn't mention cmos, dip, or bios.
checked the hp website, which was no help on resetting cmos, but according to what i read online in other forums, removing the button battery should've done it.
no information in the manual on bios, but since i can't get into it, that probably wouldn't help me anyway.
the keyboard is working, as is the mouse.
the cd recovery homepage offers two options.
one is to check the computer's functioning.
the other is to restore to factory default.
i've tried both.
neither of them work.
