bought three of these machines over the last two years and have been very happy with them.
i chose them because they were relatively cheap for the machine you got.
i was pleasantly surprised when they turned out to be great machines.
as i said, i own three of these machines and have had no problems.
they are a quality build, easy to upgrade, and very quiet.
the last desktop i bought was so silent i couldn't tell if it was on of off.
