the best $40 i ever spent.
tomorrow i am calling att and discontinuing my land line.
i have made over 80 hours of long distance calls to my brothers in tx in the first month i've had it.
i have also reconnected to many friends and family members now that i can call & talk for 'free'.
the sound quality is quite good, there is no difference in performance when compared to land lines.
what with my wife and i both having cell phones, even if 'roadrunner' goes down we still have phone access.
that is the only drawback to it.
the computer has to be on for the phone to work.
i am in the process of rehabing an old computer with a 1 gig hard drive to dedicate to my magic jack, and network it, so i can shut down my main computer.
