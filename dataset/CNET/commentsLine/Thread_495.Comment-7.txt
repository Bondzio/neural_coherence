and i read that it is pointless now since no game out there takes advantage of &quot;true dual x16 slots&quot;.
dual x8 slots are fine now and provide excellent sli performance at the highest resolutions.
i also realized that the 32 delux does not come with onboard firewire, which imo sucks.
i know that you lose pci slots when doing sli, but the 32 delux is too expensive, you only have one pci slot after sli, and i am reading reviews that it is way too buggy right now.
