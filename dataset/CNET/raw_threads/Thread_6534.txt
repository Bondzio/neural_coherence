All the User Reviews of HPs products have made me want to avoid them like the plague, but there's not many other choices. Canon looks like a good, yet not perfect fit. I need a good printer/copier that does well with drawings and text. Printing photos isn't the most important issue, though it would be nice. I also need a FAX that has an auto document feeder that works, which seems like the weakness of most that I've looked at. Am I better off getting a print/copier combo and a dedicated FAX, or there any machines that do it all well?

This one got good reviews on the forum earlier. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=134240&messageID=1513611

Just make sure you use diffusion or the high quality print setting for drawings. Also run a automatic printhead alignment. The text is near laser quality and graphics are very good and it also has a ADF. The ADF seems to work the best out of all the ones I have had. The photo quality is excellent. Officemax and newegg.com both sell them for around $200.
