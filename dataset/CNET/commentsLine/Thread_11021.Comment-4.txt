sounds like someone needs to find drivers and apps for what hardware you have.
sometimes you can't find such things.
what i'd like to hear more about is blue soleil.
as an author of some mobile apps that use blue tooth, the microsoft stack is more than good enough for blue tooth work.
and with those sub 5 buck usb bluetooth adapters there is little reason to keep an old incompatible adapter.
just to cover more ground, if you are asking members to do driver hunts, you must ask for that and supply every scrap of detail about that card or thing.
