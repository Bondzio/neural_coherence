i suspect a decent dvd burner drive last at least 18-24mos.
w/o some issue.
however, i have found more issues with poor dvd blanks and/or the environments sometimes employed, ie: factory floor.
since many users try to save costs, buying some bulk purchase will at times bite them.
often they work well, but can become flaky either because the blanks are poor or the burner is starting to show wear&amp;tear, the combo of each isn't rewarding.
while burn speeds can be auto-downgraded, many users still want the old level of before and thus complain of poor dvd drive.
regardless, a typical home user should see in the neighborhood of 400 burns or so in maintained good pc.
i exclude other manufacturing issues or &quot;kids!!
!&quot; because i view that as a problem.
poor handling of blanks and storage is not unheard of.
just to be clear, if a dvd drive is beginning to show problems, just swap it out.
