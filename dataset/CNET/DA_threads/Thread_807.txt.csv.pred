1.1.1	Ok this has been happening for a while on my creative modemblaster which has its drivers updated by the way .	St
1.1.2	There are two inputs for the phone line , each time my modem dials out whether it be a successful dial or not it switches to the other input , the one where the phone line is not in .	St
1.1.3	So this leaves me waiting for a dial tone when i hit sign in , and if i dont hear one i must put the phone line in the other jack as soon as possible and then it will start to dial .	St
1.1.4	Anyone know how this happened ?	Ques
1.1.5	thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	Only one of those jacks is for the phone line , the other is for an external phone so that you do n't need to put a splitter on the line .	St
1.2.2	If you look carefully at the jack one end says line and the other says phone , or they have a picture of a wall jack and a Phone right next to the jacks .	St
1.2.3	Try plugging in a phone to the phone side and see if you still have the problem .	St
1.2.4	If what you describe is truly happening then it is time to replace the modem .	St
1.2.5	You could try using a splitter to run the phone line into each side , that way you never have the line in the wrong place .	Sug
1.3.1	Those two phone jacks need n't both be used unless you connect a phone there also .	St
1.3.2	If a phone is connected and it 's the one causing a problem , because you mentioned you unhook one , it maybe the phone itself .	St
1.3.3	For the sake of troubleshooting , use only one phone line there , maybe even a new one to test that also .	St
1.3.4	If these phone lines are actually two separate phone numbers , use *only* one , that is n't the way it was intended for use .	St
1.3.5	Unless , you got some older & quot ; shotgun & quot ; modem that was popular a few years ago , in most cases most dail-up modems use one phone line .	St
1.3.6	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	last year after a neighborhood phone , and power outage .	St
1.4.2	Strange problem , but a new modem cured it .	St
