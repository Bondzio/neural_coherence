<s> Hello- New to this forum and I apologize in advance if this question has already been asked. </s>
<s> I'm looking into purchasing a tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband and I'm stuck on 3 that I have looked up. </s>
<s> I would really like some feedback as to which is more recommended. </s>
<s> Here are the three that I'm thinking about: Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.0 iPad 2 Asus Nexus 7 Any help/suggestions is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks so much for your time. </s>
<s> What we surely have no recommendation on is the size. </s>
<s> Some people prefer 10&quot;, other people prefer 7&quot;. </s>
<s> What does your husband prefer? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> He's not picky when it comes to size. </s>
<s> So that's another reason why I'm having a hard time choosing one. </s>
<s> It would be a lot more easy if he had a preference. </s>
<s> Very nice display. </s>
<s> I have a couple other 10 inch devices such as the Transformer with keyboard dock and an older Viewsonic gTablet. </s>
<s> Was there something in particular I can answer? </s>
<s> The use may determine some choice and the size also can determine the choice as for grab and go the 7 is very nice. </s>
<s> Also, have the Kindle Fire HD 7 in the kit. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm just having a hard time choosing one of the 3 that I posted. </s>
<s> I've heard that they're very similar, but what makes them different, besides the price and size. </s>
<s> It will mostly be used for video streaming and web browsing at home. </s>
<s> HOWEVER some folk are wanting to browse the web JUST LIKE THEIR PC. </s>
<s> For that the iPad comes up a little short so while it's great some sites are sill in need of adding support for the iPad and the no-Flash issue. </s>
<s> For the Nexus 7 I installed Firefox Beta and Flash and it's all good now. </s>
<s> There are very few sites that don't work now. </s>
<s> This app and addon should be fine on the Samsung so let's see what the Samsung has more of. </s>
<s> http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/GT-P5113TSYXAR-features I see the tab has dual cameras over the nexus single camera. </s>
<s> The Samsung charge is over a proprietary cable and my 7 charges off a standard connection. </s>
<s> The Sasmung has a 32GB memory card slot, the 7 has no slot. </s>
<s> Both should surf the web fine and play a lot of videos. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> At that time the tab 2 wasn't out yet. </s>
<s> I bought it for the display and I prefer Android over Apple. </s>
<s> of the 3 in your post 1. </s>
<s> Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 - Nice display, lots of android app available 2. </s>
<s> Ipad2 - Most applications and easy to use. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Asus Nexus - Cheaper and smaller screen, Access to lots of Android apps. </s>
<s> 4. the new entry the Surface RT - the Windows market is new and not as many applications but it's growing. </s>
<s> It odes have Microsoft Office, Only available in Windows store (online or the retail stores) Late to the competition. </s>
