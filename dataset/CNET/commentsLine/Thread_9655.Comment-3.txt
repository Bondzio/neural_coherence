shall i guess you're having difficulty when troubleshooting or such?
you may just have too much extra cable length.
you either dress it neatly as is or make each cable to reasonable length.
you can select different colors and use labels to help identify what goes where.
the wiring that comes out the back and into the building structure does need some extra length for servicing needs but it can be kept under control.
