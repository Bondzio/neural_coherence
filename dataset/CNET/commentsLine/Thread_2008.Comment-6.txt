...get an athlon 64/athlon 64 x2.
the fact that they run a lot cooler than p4's is just gravy.
if you give me your budget for a cpu/board, i'll recommend one for you.
however, i've said it before, and i'll say it again: a new cpu and board will not take you from 35 to 70fps; for that you'll need a new graphics card.
and if you get an a64, you'll want to get a motherboard with a pcie slot, so you'll need a new graphics card.
agp is obselete, so i wouldn't waste my money on a new board with only an agp slot.
