To make life easier, how about first clean up the old computer?
You said that you tried to clean it, but i think you should use a more extreme method: 1. download Spybot, Adaware, Microsoft Anti-spyware beta, SpySubtract (including CWShredder), and use them to do FULL-SYSTEM scan.
2. get HijackThis 3. scan a HijackThis log and post it on Aumha forums ( http://forum.aumha.org/viewforum.php?f=30 ) 4. wait for reply.
5. then follow the replies to clean out your computer.
(usually will have a lot of steps, but you have to follow them word by word, or the malicious stuff won't go.
recommended: after following the reply's directions, do another full system scan in Safe Mode.)
hope this helps
