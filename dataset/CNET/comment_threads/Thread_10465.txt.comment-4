I have been trying to print with my remaining big black C3 cartridge on CD/DVD media with Canons CD-Labelprint using my Canon ip5000.
It has never succeeded.
Not even with a brand new cartridge.
I think it could be due to the fact that when printing and choosing printer properties I get a limited set of choices.
There is a selection with a drop down list called &quot;BJ Cartridge&quot; which is limited to only one item on the list: COLOR.
I suppose it will then use all available cartridges except the big black C3 cartridge.
That, I suppose, is the reason the disk comes out just as white as it was before attempting to print on it...
