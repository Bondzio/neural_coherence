<s> Hi my mother board has this slot that looks like you could put and AGP slot in i was wondering if it was possible to do so. </s>
<s> The board is an Intel Desktop Board D915GVWB. </s>
<s> Thnnx!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I'm not sure if you are asking if you can put an AGP card in there, or put an AGP slot in there, but either way, the answer is no. </s>
<s> If you are wanting to put a graphics card in there, it needs to be a PCI express card. </s>
<s> Those are better than AGP anyway; they offer faster transfer rates. </s>
<s> to know. </s>
<s> Should also be able to locate info on WEB if you can't find your manual. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> If you had the motherboard for a couple off years it may be and AGP slot. </s>
<s> If it is an AGP slot you can not put and PCI Express card in that slot. </s>
<s> If the slot is a different color than your PCI slots it most likely is a video card slot, but you got to make sure which one AGP or PCI Express slot. </s>
<s> Is this a computer you built or is it store bought. </s>
<s> If it is store bought supply us with the make and model #. </s>
<s> Thank You: Wendell H </s>
<s> in his MB docs or at the Intel WEB. </s>
<s> Shame not to use the DOCs or the WEB when they're so close. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I checked at the Intel site and found his MB. </s>
<s> As you mentioned it is a PCI Express Slot on his MB. </s>
<s> I did not go to the site and should have trusted the model # that was given. </s>
<s> Thank you for reminding me trust first until proven wrong, in this case the model # was correct. </s>
<s> I would have given the same info if there was know model #, but there was. </s>
<s> Thank You Very Much: Wendell H </s>
<s> As noted by VAPCMD. </s>
<s> This writer only knows of TWO video cards for the PCI X1 slot. </s>
<s> whether it's the hard copy manual or the online version. </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether PCIe video cards are backwards compatible or not so I recommend choosing carefully. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Well thank you all so much for your help. </s>
