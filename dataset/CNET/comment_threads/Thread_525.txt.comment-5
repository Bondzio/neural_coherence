So the aspect ratio and TV sizes for HDTV are the driving force behind the wide screen LCD monitors ?
How utterly sad that every monitor maker has bought into this !
TV and movies are generally such poor forms of entertainment and knowledge and now the hardware computer world is pursuing what they have to offer.
I hope that the hardware makers will come to their senses some day and realize that computers have their own needs which go far beyond the playing of BluRay movies, TV shows, and action games.
I guess wide screens just don't do it for me.
I greatly prefer proportional screens with more overall room both wide and high.
Thanks, nonetheless for alerting me for the reasons for the new wide display screens.
