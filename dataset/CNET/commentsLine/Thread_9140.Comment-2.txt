and swap the ps cable to the hd if you can.
the bios not installed message will occur if no drive is detected.
you mentioned raid.
this adds some complications especially if your os is installed on a raid array.
these fail for reasons other than hard drive failures but the end result is much the same...data loss.
you should have some standard sata ports.
can you install vista on one of those?
