best buy and other places wont due to the risks but i dont want to do it myself due to the increased risk.
i would also like to pay to have certain things overclocked.
i did my vid card a little bit yesterday but the rest i would like to have done by a person skilled in that area as i do not want to read many guides on overclocking, this also was denied by best buy for same reason and not to my supprise my friends said that it was the same in almost all places except custom made computers on the internet however if you know of a place i would like to hear about it.
