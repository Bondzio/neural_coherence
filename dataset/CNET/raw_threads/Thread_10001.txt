I have not read of a successful external drive install of Vista yet so you would be the first. Let me be clear that said externals are connected with USB or Firewire but not SATA. Bob

With that short constraint list, no version of Windows installs and runs on external USB, Firewire drives. Yes there is BART, but that's a hack, doesn't run everything and is a hack. Bob

Maybe they'll finally let you do that with 10.5.
