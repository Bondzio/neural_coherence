for her a couple of years ago and had a lesser video card in it (agp slot) since her kids were younger and using w98se she had plenty enough at that point.
i sent her a way better card that i walked her through over the phone long distance to remove the old and install the new.
while she was on the phone, she then installed the game and everything ran great.
you could hear the kids cheering in the background.
lol but.....they weren't yelling that they wanted to play that game...they wanted to play an older game i had installed on it back then called dxball (brick breaker type that they all compete over to get the highest scores).
that particular game played fine with what they had, but they were upset over the fact that dori wouldn't let them on the computer until the new card was installed and working first.
