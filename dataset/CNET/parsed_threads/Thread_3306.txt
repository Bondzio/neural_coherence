<s> Hello, I decided it would be a great idea to re-install my Win XP-Pro OS because it seemed to be having too many problems. </s>
<s> When I backed up the drivers, I must have missed a very important one. </s>
<s> Now I've searched the net for this, but to no avail. </s>
<s> I'm running XP, my dvd is a Matshita SR-8176 cd/dvd-rom(working fine until I did this) My error keeps saying that cannot find ittimg3.dll...I don't have the disk for my dvd-rom...please help!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Install an OS can easily outstrip one's capabilities and too many will plunge into such and find themselves at a shop and out one hundred bucks... That said and you've already begun, there is likely a TYPOGRAPHIC error in that DLL name. </s>
<s> Either that or it's just a WORM, VIRUS or other MALWARE and you don't want it. </s>
<s> As to the missing DVD-ROM, this is not a matter of XP not supporting said device, but more likely some other glitch like we read at http://support.microsoft.com/?id=314060 In no uncertain words, I would delete the noted registry keys and retest. </s>
<s> In no uncertain words, a new install of XP (note no SP1) will likely find the user instantly having to deal with the MS-Blaster and Sasser WORMS the moment they connect to the internet even if they installed their antivirus. </s>
<s> This is why it's better to seek help on the issues rather than reinstall. </s>

<s> Thank you Bob. </s>
<s> Are you saying I will need to buy a new cd/dvd rom? </s>
<s> Set the BIOS to boot from the XP CD. </s>
<s> If it boots, they it's unlikely that it has a read issue. </s>
