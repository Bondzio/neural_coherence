I dont know if you already found the answer, but I used to have the same problem with my Linksys, just make sure the IEEE 802.1 authentication is off, you have the lates firmware update and be aware of any other electronic devices such as Cordless phone do not operate in the same wavelength as your transmitters, I strongly recommend you to use a WEP 64bit Encryption.
