<s> I just got a program called speedfan v4.34, The readings i got are as follow: Fan 1: 4821 RPM Fan 2: 0 RPM Fan 3: 0 RPM Temp 1: 25C Temp 2: -55C Temp 3: 52C HD0 : 35C So um.. is that normal for a PC or is this software just useless. </s>
<s> If yes then is there any foolproof way to moniter PC temperature. </s>
<s> please explain in details. </s>
<s> Sorry if posted in wrong section. </s>
<s> The author of speedfan also has a support forum if I recall. </s>
<s> There are some that will demand it works but keep in mind the price we paid here. </s>
<s> Again, take it up with the author and be sure to supply whatever details they ask for. </s>

<s> I don't dwell too much on monitoring pgms., speedfan included. </s>
<s> I use them during a fix to check results but not on a constant basis monitoring. </s>
<s> It can be off and i tend to use them as a suggested rate of observation. </s>
<s> Others may say, they get good results, but real measurements can vary from those provided by any such apps., so take with a grain of salt. </s>
<s> On top of all that, proper install of ans, etc. </s>
<s> will show at least they're working. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You were not specific in your concerns. </s>
<s> The -55C could be a pin that could have a temp sensor but is not used. </s>
<s> As to foolproof the old saying is once you make it foolproof only _ools would use it. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> some secondary fans don't support speed monitoring. </s>
<s> likewise, some motherboards/bioses don't implement temperature monitoring in a standard fashion. </s>
<s> you can configure speedfan to ignore/skip the sensors that aren't producing a reading. </s>
<s> if you want a foolproof method, you'll have to download monitoring software from your motherboard manufacturer and use only PWM fans. </s>
<s> Well a person on another board told me that no other softwares will give me a more accurate status reading of my PC then my system Bios. </s>
<s> accordingly I went into bios setup (pressing Del twice) and checked out an option called PC Health Status. </s>
<s> It showed.. CPU Temperature : 67C CPU Fan Speed : 4821-4963 RPM System Fan Speed : 0 RPM Now here I have some questions. </s>
<s> First is 67C an OK temp for my PC. </s>
<s> second what is the difference between CPU Fan and System Fan. </s>
<s> I can open my CPU cabinet. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me how to identify and check if both CPU and System Fan are there and working. </s>
<s> I can see three fans, one on the board (motherboard), second attached to the cabinet which can be seen from the back holes of the cabinet and third i believe in the power supply box inside at the topmost side of the cabinet. </s>
<s> Checking with a flashlight, they all seems to be rotating. </s>
<s> System Info: Gigabyte 8I845GVMRZ motherboard, intel pentium 4, chipset i845G, 512 mb ram running windows 2000 pro, and Award Modular Bios v6.00PG </s>
<s> That's on the Intel.com site but 67c is fine. </s>
<s> Maybe if you shared if there is an issue with the PC we could break free of this gazing at temps? </s>
<s> Well actually there are many problems and I had a feeling it had something to do with fans and PC temperature. </s>
<s> First and worst problem is that sometimes when i am running my PC, suddenly in the middle it hangs for sometime and then restarts. </s>
<s> On the first screen after restart, Primary Master Disk is not detected. </s>
<s> Like this.. Pri. </s>
<s> Master Disk : None Pri. </s>
<s> Slave Disk : None Sec. </s>
<s> Master Disk : None Sec. </s>
<s> Slave Disk : None And on the second screen after restart, an error comes up after which i can do nothing but turn off the main power switch of the PC. </s>
<s> Error is.. </s>
<s> Boot From CD/DVD: Disk Boot Failure, Insert System Disk And Press Enter Weather i try to install Norton Ghost 2003 Image which i had earlier created or even to reinstall the whole Windows 2000 pro from its install CD; error comes up saying that Hard drives are not detected. </s>
<s> I have observed this problem mostly occurs when I am installing softwares, running windows update or browsing my picture folders (thumbnail view) which contains a lots of pictures. </s>
<s> Only now know what the real issues are. </s>
<s> You may want to rethink such posts since they rarely get back on track of the real problem. </s>
<s> -&gt; Now that I know this I can share that many i845 boards had bad caps (see google about BAD CAPS) and many are old. </s>
<s> The old, tired power supply can have the same issue so we know to inspect for the bad caps plus pop in a monster power supply for a test run. </s>
<s> We also leave the cover off until we think we've fixed it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No profit mate, i wanted to know some things about my PC fans as well as the rest of its problems. </s>
<s> especially why Bios is stating system fan is at 0 RPM readings. </s>
<s> But moving on to my main problem, i will see what google says about i845 boards and BAD CAPS. </s>
<s> About power supply box, i had it changed a year back and repaired couple of months back. </s>
<s> so its not that old. </s>
<s> I didn't understand what you mean by, &quot;leave the cover off until we think we've fixed it.&quot; </s>
<s> I mean you should &quot;leave the cover off until we think we've fixed it.&quot; Your choice here. </s>
