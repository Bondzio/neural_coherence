if you are sure your xp is sp2 and you have installed the latest bios version for that motherboard, then i would install a hard disk drive controller card in one of your pci slots.
under $20 in the usa.
...or just make two partitions on the 200gb drive with no one partition being larger than 137gb.
this solution is free.
