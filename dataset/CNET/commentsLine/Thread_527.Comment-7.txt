i have had some significant successes with companies reluctant to provide even reasonable customer service.
i call the president's office.
every company has a small call center dedicated to higher management complaints.
give them a clear, no-emotion, fact filled explanation in 5 minutes or less with your expected remedy.
call directory assistance in miami for their main number or administration number - not customer or support anything to get the number you need.
by the way.
i would think you're in your rights to request the laptop as well as the service charges refunded since no solution provided a reasonable remedy.
you need to do an end run around the technical support minions who may not have the larger company vision in mind.
this is a lot less hassle than trying to get the government or a lawyer to help you in this fight.
good luck.
btw - i've yet to see any laptop with a high performance processor and a good video engine last over 20 minutes while turning your lap into fried bacon.
they are clearly &quot;ahead of their headlights&quot; on this one.
