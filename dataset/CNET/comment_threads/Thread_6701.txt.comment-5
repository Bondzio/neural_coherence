didn't work with new motherboard that usually doesn't offer ISA anymore.
Beside Win XP also didn't support it (correct me if i'm wrong) That scanner + ISA scsi only works on 95 and 98.
The problem is SCSI card compatibility...
Unless you can make the old ISA SCSI works in windows XP, donate it to someone who need and get a new scanner.
FYI, I have 4 good and working scanner (IIc, IIcx, 4c, 4p) that collecting dust in my garage... just because I move to windows XP.
