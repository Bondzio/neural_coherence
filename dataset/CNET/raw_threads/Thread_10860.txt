As any sound card must digitize the audio then pass that over to a decoder then to an amplifier this will always result in a delay. If you had an amplifier then maybe you could do this but... if you watch folk that sing they hold their hand just so to hear themselves better. In other words, this is not something a sound card can fix. Bob
