you have a hardware problem.
a bad or corrupted hd would take longer to crash.
if other troubleshooting dosen't work, try removing your hd and putting it in another computer as the second drive.
back up your important files (preferably twice), then reinstall the hd in the bad computer.
you can now try drastic measures which might damage or wipe the hd.
if all else fails, you can now take it in for repair.
