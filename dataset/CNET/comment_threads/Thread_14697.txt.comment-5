If you truly have &quot;alot&quot; of memory, then using ECC type makes sense.
Understand, those that use ECC type memory are more &quot;server&quot; usage or business apps, in general and those usually ship with ECC type memory.
For the typical home user it isn't needed or required.
ECC just gives more room for &quot;error correction&quot; in intense demanding apps or math dependant usage.
Of course, if the system can'r be started w/o ECC installed that pretty makes everything mute, just install it.
In most cases it is an &quot;option&quot; that can be installable, but *all* must then be ECC type in order to work properly.
good luck -----Willy
