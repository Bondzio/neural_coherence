<s> What hardware issue could this be? </s>

<s> &quot;I have an new computer...&quot; You have a WARRANTY issue. </s>
<s> A new machine shouldn't develop such an issue when new. </s>
<s> I suggest you contact the maker and make it their problem. </s>
<s> If you want to solve it, be sure to post in a Software or OS Forum that matches. </s>
<s> Note the OS, the DVD player software and versions of everything. </s>
<s> I can play DVD on my 256 Meg RAM PC with either Windows 98 or XP, so I think it's not a RAM or hardware issue. </s>
