1.2.1	when i go to computer menage disk menagment it says healthy primary pertition and the file syystem is ntfs while my disk is RAW	St
1.3.1	Almost all Windows PCs can't understand a Mac formatted drive.	St
1.3.2	Keep in mind that the error message is asked about many thousand times so did you read a few prior discussions?	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	i did spent the last day trying to find a solution but this is the thing... i have a mac and whateever i need i can access from there so all i need is not to delete all the data... and i am trying to intsall win 8 on my pc and i want to use my HDD to back everything up i have a lot of stuff in here.

1.4.2	..	St
1.5.1	There are too many issues here.	St
1.5.2	The first is that you'll have the same issue later since Windows can't understand the Apple drive format.	St
1.5.3	Yes there is software to add this and yes we could boot a Live Linux CD to copy files over but this ignores the biggest issue of them all.	St
1.5.4	Ready?	St
1.5.5	The biggest issue is this is not a backup.	St
1.5.6	It's a copy.	St
1.5.7	The forums are full of folk that &quot;backed up&quot; onto one lone drive and then something happened.	St
1.5.8	This is not backup.	St
1.5.9	I'm going to stop writing and let that sink in and CHANGE THE SUBJECT.	St
1.5.10	-&gt; OK how would I tackle this without adding an Apple file system driver?	St
1.5.11	Many ways.	St
1.5.12	1.	St
1.5.13	I'd get some USB memory stick to copy files on and then on the Apple copy those to the HDD.	Sug
1.5.14	2.	St
1.5.15	I'd use my DropBox or Google Drive to save files and then on the Apple copy those to the HDD.	St
1.5.16	Bob	St
1.6.1	i was wondering if i could install windows 8 without losing anything.like in a new drive or something is that possible	St
1.7.1	Now that we covered the issues of backup we don't need to cover that again.	St
1.7.2	Windows 8 would cost far more than a memory stick or the DropBox or Google Drive solution but your choice here.	St
