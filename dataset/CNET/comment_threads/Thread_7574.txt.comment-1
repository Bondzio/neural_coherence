Have(DSKTP) XP Pro SP1 + about 10 SP2 Hotfixes.
Received a D-Link 604 4 port router to allow sharing of Cable connection (Modem) with HP laptop DV1010CA XP Home SP2.
Have seen several reports of nightmares w ZA version 5.0.
Sites say melds well with SP2 in new 5.5 version utilizing SP2s Security Center.
Have heard with SP1 machine I'd be better off using older ZA version 4.5.
Many had reverted back from ZA 5.0.
I'd welcome any recommendations since never had a router before and attempts several years ago with a Kerio FW were a complete disaster end with causing a reformat/re-install of then current 98SE.
I really don't want to Go SP2 on Desktop (far too many programs would be lost to malfunction).Thanks in Advance for your time.
