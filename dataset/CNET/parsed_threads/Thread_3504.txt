<s> My system (both DVD burner and Windows Explorer) does not recognize DVD+RW discs. </s>
<s> My DVD drive is an LG GWA-4164B HH 16X DVD+/-RW in a Dell Dimension 9150 system. </s>
<s> I first enountered the problem trying to burn a DVD. </s>
<s> The burner would spin/stop/repeat and not recognize the discs. </s>
<s> I don't have the problem with any other type of disc (CD or DVD +/- R). </s>
<s> The DVD drive is updated with the latest firmware. </s>
<s> I am running Vista 32-bit (Home) with the latest updates. </s>
<s> My burning software is Nero 7.7.5.1. </s>
<s> Other system specs are 2 Gb RAM, Dual Core 2.8 GHz. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> As far as I know, Nero 7 is Vista compatible, and burns any other disc just fine. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
