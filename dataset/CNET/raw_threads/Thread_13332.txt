My Laptop says its getting signal from the router, but when I look at the connection status, it shows that its sending but not recieving &quot;packets.&quot; My other laptop's wireless connection works fine. I think I may have activated the &quot;Share Internet Connection&quot; function by accident, which the Help Menu says is a no-no. Can someone help me out?

It seemed that when I changed the settings that the WEP key reset, so it wasn't the right one being used by my wireless network. I found it out by accident as i was trying everything in my power to fix it, but hey, it worked. Have you tried that yet? Good luck on fixing your connection.

I am using Windows XP Home Edition on a laptop and XP Profesional on a PC. I recently set up a Netgear Wireless router and it all worked fine for about a week. Then last night, I dont know what happened but it all went wrong on both computers. I have managed to fix it on the PC but the laptop wont work. I only have one Wireless USB connection that I swapped between the computers when I wanted to use the internet. The laptop says that it is connected, but it is revieving 'Packets' for some reason. I cant connect propperly to the internet. It wont lest me use any of programes for the internet (microsoft or other). I have seen this WEP thing somewhere whilst trying to fix it but I cant remember where I seen it. I have been trying all day now and it is really starting to p*ss me off. Can somebody please help as I am tempted to just abandon technology all together.
