thanks bob.
gaming really isn't my thing.
does photoshop process through the gpu or cpu, mostly (i haven't found a solid answer online)?
do you think (for my uses) that it is worth the extra $200ish for quad-core?
quad would also automatically give me the larger gpu.
sorry for so volume of questions, i simply want to understand.
this question going to anybody btw.
