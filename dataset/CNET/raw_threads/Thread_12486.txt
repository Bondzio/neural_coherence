The issues that I am having are listed below as well as the specs from my machine. Any more info that may be needed, I can provide through replies: System: Dell Dimension E510 3.0 Gig Intel Pent 4 2.5 GB memory 80 West Dig Hard drive (WDC WD8000JD-75MSA1) *When windows load, I get past the &quot;Dell Black Screen&quot; quickly but I get hung up on the light blue screen that usually shows &quot;welcome&quot; right before showing the normal windows icon desktop screen. Usually takes 1-3 minutes to get off the &quot;welcome&quot; screen. *Accessing documents, websites, email, etc. is fine, but when I try to change the location of where I want to save a file in the drop down menu at the top when you hit &quot;save&quot; or when I hit &quot;save as&quot;, the computer will go to a crawl and either show a hour glass symbol for a minute or so each time a different location is picked or it will show a green scroll bar in the middle of the screen while it is processing which I have never seen before. This box is titled &quot;INITIALLING FOLDERS: INITIALLIZING THE ROOT FOLDERS TO DISPLAY&quot; This usually takes a minute to three to complete. *Finally, when closing out of an internet page, I will get a white windows error box. The one that says &quot;Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close.. This happens every time &quot;x-ing&quot; out of a website if it is the only tab open. Closing out of a site that is connected to others in the website tabs gives no issue until closing out the last site. I have switched the memory cars around (It has 2 1GB cards and 2 256 cards) to have just the 1 GB cards in and then just the 256 cards in to see if one of the sets was bad, but it did the same thing no matter which ones were in. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated! I hate to buy a new hard drive if that is not the issue. If it is not the hard drive, then I can imagine what the issue is. Thank you in advance, John
