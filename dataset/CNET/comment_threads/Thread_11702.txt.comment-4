It does have issues with drivers.
The motherboard, audio, video and such drivers all need to be installed before I would expect a DVD to work.
BUT if I look at PowerDVD, it's default install in some versions needs a little help in finding the drive letter of the DVD.
Its in some options menu but since there are any number of versions, I leave it to you to find the menu and setting.
Next, the CD/DVD drives must NOT have any driver in CONFIG.SYS.
PLEASE share the contents of the CONFIG.SYS file to make sure it's ok. Bob
