on the s/w side, was there any recent system updates or system installs, etc.?
if not, then very possible the audio portion just got blown away, it happens.
see, if using plain 2:1 audio works or similar.
if you have a testing pgm.
as some audio pgms.
do, use it.
even though you checked the cabling, has anyone else been at work?
also, verify the cabling again.
try the speakers elsewhere is possible.
as for the audio ckt.
check the mtrbd./card in the areas in question for burnt or obvious damage.
