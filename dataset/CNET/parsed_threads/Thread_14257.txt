<s> I made a PC for my Dad from a bunch of parts I had sittin' around. </s>
<s> It was an AMD 1300Ghz, had a heatsink with fan, Soyo socket A mobo, 512MB ddr, tower case, CD-RW drive, Nvidia TNT2 Model 64 (M64) video card, with an MS Windows 98SE OS. </s>
<s> Sound was onboard. </s>
<s> All of which worked fine before, during, and after, assembly. </s>
<s> I brought it to him and installed it for him and was working fine. </s>
<s> He had a surge protector he plugged it through. </s>
<s> He bought a Floppy drive for it to play a game with. </s>
<s> After a couple of tries installed it successfully. </s>
<s> A thunder storm was coming recently and he powered it down after playing the game. </s>
<s> The storm passed without incident and he went to power it back on to no avail. </s>
<s> All that happens is the power light comes on with no disk light/activity, no fans come on(mobo or P/S), no video response/lights, no beeps, no post. </s>
<s> This has happened to me a couple of times I can remember. </s>
<s> Not sure why it happened or what the remedy was. </s>
<s> From reading some of the posts I got some ideas but would still like to hear some opinions. </s>
<s> Thanks, Troy </s>
<s> is not coming up from the power supply. </s>
<s> The Power LED is lighted by the main 5 Volt rail. </s>
<s> If the 12 volt rail doesn't come up, the Power Supply will not release the Master reset by setting the Power OK signal &quot;ON&quot;. </s>
<s> Are the fans running or LEDs on the CD, floppy etc. </s>
<s> coming on? </s>
<s> That should tell you if its the P/S Also make sure the CPU heat sink did not lose contact and fry the AMD. </s>
<s> in his original post. </s>
<s> That is why this writer suggested that he lost the 12 volts [which is what powers all of the devices that aren't turning on]. </s>
