Does anyone know an other way to reset bios settings? PS: Why i can't change them back: the picture is al messed up and just has some weird lines on it.

There should be a jumper on the mobo, located near that battery that is for the express purpose of resetting the BIOS to the default. Move the jumper to the opposite position and turn off all power to the mobo [only sure way to remove the 5 volt standby power is to unplug the power supply, or turn it off by the switch on the rear]for a few minutes. Then move the jumper back and turn the system on.

CPU:celeron 1ghz RAM:96mb video: on board motherboard: i dont know what kind this is but it has a phoenix bios i think i put the battery in right...i think but if you boot it up without battery it should just load default settings

Your earlier post said that the display is just some lines. Check the monitor on another PC to eliminate faulty monitor and try your pc with another monitor. That should give you firm indications as to what is wrong. Hope this helps.

The usual? -&gt; Boot Windows to SAFE MODE, set the settings you want there, OK it and ask Windows to reboot. Bob
13593	8	98026	1120926	1120834	tod	4/13/05 5:49 AM	1.11337134E12	nope	The screen has weird lines on it at all times, even before windows is loaded, even in the bios.

Probably in the video settings not BIOS, but then again zero makes no sense, unless she changed the acceleration slider all the to the left. Good luck solving this one Robert.

Hi Tod, Just understand that the BIOS as factory set or Default HAS to work the monitor in the basic mode, i.e. 640 x 480 resolution. If it does not, then how does one even attempt any change or configuration of the BIOS in the first place? Plz confirm that you monitor / PC video card is OK as suggested in my earlier post. Incidentally, does your monitor have any control or controls that adjust the display Width or Height? If yes, then you could try adjusting these and see if the display becomes stable. The same, if there is any control for H-Sync or V-Sync, which is not likely unless the monitor is an old version or of a special make. All the Best
