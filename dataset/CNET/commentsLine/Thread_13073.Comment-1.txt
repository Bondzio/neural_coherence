hi, i just received my new ph and wanted to add an 80gb hdd to it.
my question concerns the drive, i got it at a yard sale, and was wondering if there was a way to make sure that it didn't contain viruses.
will formatting it in the ph erase any potentially harmful material or do i risk infecting just by hooking it up?
thanks.
