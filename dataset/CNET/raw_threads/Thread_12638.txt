Recently I upgraded to windows XP and had to download new drivers for the card ( from the SiS website ) . The problem is that whenever I run a game in openGL , it is way too dark . With Windows 98/Me , there was full set of utilities with the driver software that allowed me to adjust the brightness levels . However there is no such feature with the present drivers . As a result , i cannot play any game in open Gl , because it is too dark to view . Does anyone have any suggestions to correct this problem ?

I go to active desktop, customize, settings advanced and there you will find a correction in my case it is called gamma correction but it may be called something else just turn it up.
