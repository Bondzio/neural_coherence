i had a similar problem and i had fixed it by chance.
lets try this.
* first, do not format or delete the data when it prompt.
bcos u may worsen and possibility of getting it back will be less.
2) trying pluggin into a different machines,eg., friends laptop, desktop.
sometime it may detect.
3) go to mycomputer -&gt; right click and select manage, goto disk management under storage and see whether disk is listed.
if it prompts to format, don't do it.
4)if drive is detected, try  and to get data.
you can find me in facebk yoganandam dayalan .
send your email, i'll send more steps to try.
