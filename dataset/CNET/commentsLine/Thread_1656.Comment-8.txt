the clock speed of a processor (ghz/mhz) may be misleading.
different cpus do different amount of work per cycle.
some processor may operate at a higher clock speed, but does less work per cycle, and ends up being slower than another processor that may be operating at a slower clock speed.
amd cpus usually have the highest processing capacity per cycle, celeron the lowest.
that's why many gamers choose amd over pentium, even though the fastest pentium 4 processor operate at a much higher clock.
that said, celeron looks good for your purposes.
it is by far the cheapest.
