<s> I have a Intel D865perll motherboard. </s>
<s> My question is what type of Pentium 4 processors can i match with it. </s>
<s> I am kinda confused with 3.2e and 3.2c and so on. </s>
<s> What does all this mean and which ones will work with it. </s>
<s> The numbers you gave are the 865 Intel chipset which doesn't specify the make and model of the motherboard. </s>
<s> It matters. </s>
<s> Please identify the make and model number and forum members can help you find the maker's CPU support list. </s>

<s> http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/rl/ The c and e designations refer to Intels core naming scheme. </s>
<s> e is Northwood and c is Prescott. </s>
<s> The later is built on a thinner substrate and supposed to be a bit better in performance but the jury has not decided. </s>
<s> Your board will probably support the Northwood chips but may require (if available) a BIOS update for the Prescotts. </s>
<s> The brand is Intel and the model number is BOXD865PERLL. </s>
<s> That is all i know about it. </s>
<s> BOXD865PERLL supported CPU list is at... http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/rl/rl_proc.htm Bob </s>
