1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	I have new internal SATA II hard disk I bought recently .	St
1.1.3	I made it only a back up or spare drive for my old IDE Hard disk ( with OS ) and also for extra storage space .	St
1.1.4	I used the new hard disk for installing software applications , games and copying files to it .	St
1.1.5	For the first few days , it worked just fine from installing apps to copying files .	St
1.1.6	But one day when I install an application to this new disk , an error occured ( delayed write failed ) and the installation ca n't continue .	St
1.1.7	Then the disk no longer appeared at My Computer .	St
1.1.8	Sometimes the disk is ok then sometimes the same problem occured .	St
1.1.9	I can say that the problem of the new disk is intermittent .	St
1.1.10	Until one day the disk no longer appeared at BIOS .	St
1.1.11	So I decided to claim warranty for it because of this problem .	St
1.1.12	After a week , the vendor gave me a new replacement hard disk with same specs .	St
1.1.13	I installed the new disk and it went well .	St
1.1.14	After a few days , the same problem occured that the files can not be copied ( files become corrupted ) .	St
1.1.15	Then a week after , the disk no longer appeared again at the BIOS or can not be recognized .	St
1.1.16	My question is where does this problem really originated ?	Ques
1.1.17	Is my motherboard , SATA port or the new hard disk is defective ?	Ques
1.1.18	Hope to help me with this .	St
1.1.19	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	You gave aspects of your problems but no real details .	St
1.2.2	All those items you mentioned can be at fault .	St
1.2.3	Excluding any malware at work here , I suspect you have a weak USB ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.4	ext .	St
1.2.5	port .	St
1.2.6	Power issues are a possible link or not .	St
1.2.7	To have the problem appear rather quickly also suggests that as what else is constant if not power .	St
1.2.8	Try a rear USB port to connect to for now .	St
1.2.9	Come back with all details .	St
1.2.10	Is this an ext .	St
1.2.11	HD you build or brought complete not as a kit ?	Ques
1.2.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Sounds as if your primary drive the likely culprit , corrupting your B/U drive , assuming this occurs when you send data from primary to secondary .	St
1.3.2	First thing I would do , check the primary for issues .	St
1.4.1	1 .	St
1.4.2	Check your mobo website for newer BIOS versions which may have addressed any previous issues with IDE/SATA .	St
1.4.3	2 .	St
1.4.4	Try not to mess with default hard disk parms when configuring BIOS .	St
1.4.5	3 .	St
1.4.6	Ensure you install the correct mobo SATA driver ( IDE emul , ACHI or RAID ) .	St
1.4.7	4 .	St
1.4.8	Finally for your own peace of mind : & gt ; avoid installing apps to any drive other than C : \ & gt ; never install apps to a drive you store precious data & gt ; never use local storage containing irreplaceable programs/data as a source for program installation ( install failure may cause whole source drive to be erased )	St
