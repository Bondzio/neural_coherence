too bad i have no quick way available to show pictures.
however i look at the caps and don't see any domed tops.
the tops are flat, clean and shiny, and with a &quot;k&quot;, &quot;+&quot; or &quot;y&quot; shaped marking on them.
about the power supply: it's only 300w it's made in china.
it doesn't appear to have a brand, unless &quot;sales international&quot; is a brand.
so it doesn't look like the best power supply out there.
maybe i should think about replacing this.
could a bad power supply cause all the symptoms i mentioned?
