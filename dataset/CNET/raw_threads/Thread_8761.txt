I also had a D-LINK WBR-2310 wireless router installed. I had created an &quot;Unsecure&quot; wireless network (abc123) to use my laptop. It was working fine. I was able to wirelessly connect to the Internet and peek into the desktops. Yesterday, I decided to make the network secure by putting in a WEP key. After that, the network has disappeared fro the network list and I have not been able to do anything with my laptop, wirelessly, that is. When I try to create a new wireless network using the wireless wizard, it asks me you want to create new network or add a computer to the existing (abc123). So it is there somewhere. HP C751NR laptop; XP PRO; D-Link WBR2310. PLEASE HELP!
