My computer can't run games very well, like for example: Fable 3, Skyrim, Star Wars TFU2, Call of duty etc. I really want to play games like that. Here is my PC http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02743406&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5090668#N74 I have a 250watt power supply, do I have to get a new power supply to get a new graphics card since mine is kind of low? Somebody recommended this video card because it doesn't require a very big power supply. Will this card run those games good? If not, what should I get? Under 60$ http://www.amazon.com/Asus-ATI-Radeon-HD5450-Silence/dp/B003AK2HJO/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

Here's the list and if you look at the requirements I would go for another PSU. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fastest-graphics-card-radeon-geforce,3067.html

With that combo you have a medium duty gamer. Meaning it should play most games on medium settings with no fuss.
