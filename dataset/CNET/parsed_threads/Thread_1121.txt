<s> I have a Belkin N router Three hours ago my router disconnected it was secured after it disconnected i tried to connect it said its unsecured i tried unplugging it that didn't work so i reset it and i selected WPA when i chose that i entered my password i clicked on apply changes everytime i click on apply changes for WPA my router disconnects </s>
<s> If your were able to connect in an unsecured state, that means the router itself has lost its wireless security settings. </s>
<s> It may have been due to a power problem, glitch in the hardware or malevolent action. </s>
<s> You didn't post the specific model Belkin, but hopefully the following will help. </s>
<s> I recommend resetting the router to its factory default setting using the Reset button on the device. </s>
<s> Then navigate to 192.168.2.1 and adjust the settings. </s>
<s> You may want to visit the Belkin website if you are not familiar with adjusting your router settings. </s>
<s> If you still have your router's setup disk and feel more comfortable using that instead of the manual method, then try it that way. </s>
<s> I already reset it when i reset it i go into security and choose WPA PSK then enter my password then when i click apply changes my signal bar has a red X then disconnects i have to reset it every time thats the only way it connects unplugging it doesn't work </s>
<s> I have a Belking F5D8236-4 v3 </s>
<s> I deleted wireless profile then connected again it worked </s>
