...but only if you feel the system is ''sluggish'' for what you do.
otherwise, turn a deaf ear to the ''upsellers''.
i'm so tired of seeing people, who will only ever email & websurf, get sold a windows media center edition pc (w/dvd burner, tv tuner, 7.1 sound, etc...) w/p4, mega-ghz.
cpu's & gb of ram.
unless you feel you need more- just look for a great deal on a new hard drive, as you planned.
that, alone, will speed things up immensely (3gb of free space isn't fun for the system to maneuver in).
i recently picked up a 200gb seagate (only maker to offer 5 yr. warranty) for $50 after $50 rebate- free shipping, too.
a good, reputable online vendor is newegg.com.
an 80gb just cost a client $56.
many of the drive maker's include disk cloning tools on their cd that comes with the drive.
this allows you to move the existing system to the newer, larger drive.
however, if it were me, i'd opt for a fresh install of xp- unless it was loaded recently.
ram is always a good investment- assuming a good price & open slots on the board.
if increasing ram means you'd have to pull a smaller stick out to do it- then forget that.
good luck & have fun with the new drive, tracy ps- if & when you decide on a 2nd pc, keep the original as a spare.
