8245	0	274919	2649140	NR	groowy3	12/8/07 3:18 AM	1.19708388E12	Computer turns on then off in 3 seconds	I built a new pc - Asus P5KR, E6500, 2gb OCZ ram, Gigabyte Nvidia 8600GTS, a sata HDD and installed windows Vista. After running 3d applications my computer started crashing (nvidia hardware error). At some point it turned off and now can't be turned on. When I turn it on it spins the fan and disks for 3 seconds and then turns off for 3 seconds. Then it turns on again and so on - it's a loop. I tried using CLRTC, it doesn't help and I even bought a new PSU - top of the range - it doesn't help either. A friend of mine told me that it can be something about Vista hardware attack protection, because of some nvidia-vista issues. But what do I do now?

8245	3	274919	2649511	2649276	groowy3	12/8/07 12:04 PM	1.19711544E12	Dead pc	I've read hudreds of articles on this topic, but none helped. The only topic that made sense was about nvidia and vista incompatibility. This is way I asked for help - did anyone encounter the same problem?
8245	4	274919	2649513	2649511	R. Proffitt	12/8/07 12:07 PM	1.19711562E12	Yes I have.	But these articles duplicate the methods and fixes I use. This is why I no longer write what to do anymore. -&gt; Back to you. Since you think it's a video card incompatibility issue I didn't read where you tried another card. Why is that? And let me be blunt here. Some owners will not change the cards and boards out to find the issue. These owners usually take the longest to get their new systems working. Bob
8245	5	274919	2649572	2649513	groowy3	12/8/07 1:39 PM	1.19712114E12	Changing card	The first day when I saw the problem I went back to the shop and chaged the video card (same model). It didn't help me. I'll try changing the motherboard too.
8245	6	274919	2649649	2649572	R. Proffitt	12/8/07 3:28 PM	1.19712768E12	Just one last thing.	Did you build it up on cardboard to sniff out case mounting issues? (yes, that's in those articles but many don't do that.) Bob
8245	7	274919	2650007	2649649	groowy3	12/9/07 7:58 AM	1.19718708E12	Cardboard	That's what I'm going to try next. By the way, I just discovered that my alienware laptop has been dead for the same reaso for 3 months!
8245	8	274919	2650129	2650007	groowy3	12/9/07 10:46 AM	1.19719716E12	Motherboard's dead?	ok, so I put the MB on a piece of cardboard and tried to run in several configurations - full, only essential stuff and only CPU. Same thing happened in all cases. So, the MB's dead, right?
8245	9	274919	2650140	2650129	R. Proffitt	12/9/07 11:09 AM	1.19719854E12	How dead is it?	When I'm testing I can strip it down to just the motherboard and the PSU. This lets me power up and down which tests the smallest possible amount of parts (2). Next I'll add the CPU+heatsink+fan and the SPEAKER. It should power up and beep under protest. This should not power down on it's own. -&gt; The articles I noted detail this baby steps to sniff out where the issue is but unless you have spare parts you can't tell which part it is but at least you usually can work down to &quot;it's in these parts.&quot; Bob

8245	11	274919	2650152	2650138	R. Proffitt	12/9/07 11:39 AM	1.19720034E12	Or ...	The CPU is not supported, the BIOS is not capable or supporting the CPU or there is something horribly misconfigured (jumper on CMOS reset,etc...) Bob
8245	12	274919	2650175	2650152	groowy3	12/9/07 11:41 AM	1.19720046E12	Not sure	Unlikely, as the PC was working for some time
8245	13	274919	2650185	2650138	R. Proffitt	12/9/07 11:48 AM	1.19720088E12	Sure.	I've run into this with new hardware. The owner mounted it with some extra metal stud in the wrong place. The insulating paint wore off and what worked for awhile no longer did. Bottom line? Start as small as possible (2 parts) and work up in size. Always use the desd pc guides. Bob
8245	14	274919	2650177	2650185	groowy3	12/9/07 11:53 AM	1.19720118E12	strange	Something strange happened - after 999th cmos reboot the pc once started. Then - same thing.
8245	15	274919	2650210	2650185	groowy3	12/9/07 12:43 PM	1.19720418E12	update	Now the fans and disks are spinning, but the screen remains black. But there is no single beep on start.
8245	16	274919	2650234	2649140	R. Proffitt	12/9/07 1:24 PM	1.19720664E12	No beep = you are looking at the possibly bad parts.	Be sure to leave out the video, ram when we do that test. Bob
8245	17	274919	2654660	2650234	groowy3	12/15/07 5:03 AM	1.19769498E12	Video card	Ok, I bought an ATI video card. With it the computer starts. It beeps when there is no RAM, for example, bot it doesn't do the single beep when all is ok and the screen stays black. Any ideas?
8245	18	274919	2654814	2654660	R. Proffitt	12/15/07 8:49 AM	1.19770854E12	Remember the dead pc articles?	The method is to have the 2 parts to power up. No power up and one of the two is bad. Next we add the CPU and speaker. No beeps = one or more of those parts is bad. If you add another part and it fails you are looking at the bad, incompatible or horribly misconfigured parts. What it does not tell you is exactly which. But this method is good enough for us in the shop. Bob
