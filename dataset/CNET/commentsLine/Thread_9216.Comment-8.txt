&quot;.and you find that they are reliably read on other computers?
what software are you using?&quot; you didn't write about use with other computers.
that issue pans incd/directcd and is its biggest weakness.
when i use the simple erase and record (as if it's a cdr or dvdr), then most other machines see if as i need it to be.
that's a new question about compatibility issues with incd/directcd.
the answer is that you get to test for such.
i don't have to test since i do not use incd/directcd or such.
---------------------- today i use nero, cdburnerxp, roxio, easy cd, and k3b to create my cd and dvds.
for video work i have other titles i use, but that was not the topic.
