1.4.2	It 's wonderful .	Polite

1.5.1	Since you want to save money , Step 1 : Consider a Belkin 802.11g wireless router ...	St
1.5.2	Unless there is some sort of specific functionality that the Linksys does that you require .	St
1.5.3	802.11g is standard and the built-in MacBook wireless does that .	St
1.5.4	That said , a Linksys wireless router running 802.11g will work just fine with the MacBook .	St
1.5.5	Please reference http : //www.apple.com/macbook/wireless.html Wireless mouse : I use a Kensington .	St
