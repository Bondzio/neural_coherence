as with most if not all such questions, i'm looking for a scanner to just scan photos for eventual cd/dvd storage but i'm hoping for 2 things: 1.
- to find one bundled with software that can automatically name the photos as i quickly (more or less...;&gt;) shove them through the scanner.
ie: i have a lot of outdoor pics so as an example, i'd like to name them bar harbor 1999 (2000, etc.)
and have the software autoname them as they get scanned.
2.
- a scanner that i can put a stack of pics in it rather than handfeed each pic seperately - if such a thing exists.
i typically go to best buy when i have to buy electronics.
i like to see what i'm buying but there's nothing on their website (or in the products description that i can find) that would indicate what i'm looking for.
any help is appreciated!
