<s> We have a 1987(circa) Compaq Portable 3, with DOS 3.1 installed. </s>
<s> 5&quot; floppy. </s>
<s> A few weeks ago I used it to do a bit of batchfile stuff to show people what it looked like in 'the old days'.I've just fired her up again and got '1790 - disk 0 error' which I believe to mean hard disk failure. </s>
<s> Is this the end of the the computer without perhaps major surgery? </s>
<s> Can I get into the BIOS? </s>
<s> Is there a BIOS to get into? </s>
<s> Any thoughts would be most welcome. </s>
<s> The Compaq does have a bios. </s>
<s> You may need to find out though just how you enter it. </s>
<s> WAG, it's hitting F2 or F10 key during boot-up. </s>
<s> You would need to repair it as more than likely the error 1790 is a &quot;hard error&quot;. </s>
<s> if you have access to the OS floppies and yet another HD, you should be able to recover. </s>
<s> Compaq back then provided &quot;diag floppies&quot; that covered everything that needed to be done. </s>
<s> Having access to this is going to be your problem. </s>
<s> A bootable floppy that had the required files is required is going the old fashion raw method. </s>
<s> The bios access requires it boots from &quot;floppy&quot; 1st as the main boot device, thus the required bootable floppy and/or diskette. </s>
<s> While you're dealing with DOS3.1, it can very well use any latter released OS like 5.0 up to 6.2(from memory). </s>
<s> of course, you still need the bootable floppy/diskette. </s>
<s> Compaq support may have details on all required diags, check the &quot;legacy side&quot; of things to see if provided but that's a long shot. </s>

<s> Thanks Willy, I'll try to track down a bootable floppy. </s>
<s> It's all very annoying as it was working fine. </s>
