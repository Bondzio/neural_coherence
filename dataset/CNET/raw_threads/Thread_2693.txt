We have one computer hooked through a cable modem and it works fine but two others, one by cable cord and one wireless through a wireless broadband router don't receive a connection. My laptop wireless card doesn't recognize any connection at all. I have noticed that the router gets really hot, which I don't think is normal. Whether that has anything to do with my problem I don't know but I was told to contact you, the manafacturer, to see what if anything can be done to correct the problem. CNR914W S/N:ANV1403000112 and P/N:18-1b-914W-FBUS. Please let me know what can be done. I am in college and really need the internet...this is really frustrating to me. Thanks-Sarah
