9013	0	21644	233978	NR	Dblcrsovr	5/2/04 6:39 PM	1.08352314E12	Wireless Networking Help	I ahve a wireless network in my house which has two laptops on it, and on desktop wired to it. The router is a Microsoft MN-700. One of the laptops connects easily, automatically, and consistently. The other laptop, a gateway, is running Windows XP Pro and it cannot connect. It has an Intel Pro/Wireless LAN 2100 3B mini PCI adapter. It is built-in, as that laptop has a centrino chip package. A ballon pops up saying that &quot;One or more wirelss networks ar available.&quot; I can actually pick up my own network and my neighbor's. After clicking on mine, it reverts back to the ballon popping up. Using this same method, i can connect to my neighbor's, but i would prefer using my own network. I know i have the WEP correct, but i do not know what else to do. I have tried to ping my router, but it fails. What else should I try? Thanks in advance for your help Michael
