I recently purchased one more stick of Mushkin SP3200 512MB 184-Pin DDR SDRAM to add to the two that I already had.
My motherboard is a Chaintech ZNF3-250 that supports up to 2 gigs of ram with 3 slots, but when I insert the new stick and boot up the PC it stays on the startup screen.
It shows &quot;Memory Testing: 1572864K , Memory Frequency is: [blank]&quot;.
I'm not much of a hardware troubleshooting person so I have no idea what to do.
Please help.
