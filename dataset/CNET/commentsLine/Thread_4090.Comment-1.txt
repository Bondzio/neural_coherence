so i've been shopping around for a desktop to replace my old laptop and at first i was looking at newegg, which lead to ibuypower (i'd like a custom build) but after reading the reviews on ibuypower i was hesitant to go with them.
one of the reviews suggested ironside computers.
so i went to their website and poked around bit, they seem reputable, although there were a few warning signs that went up.
first, under testimonials, there were only 5. total.
second, there was only one entry on resellerratings.com third, i haven't been able to find any quality discussion about the company on-line.
so i turn to you cnet, they any good?
