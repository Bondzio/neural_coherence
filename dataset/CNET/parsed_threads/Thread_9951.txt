<s> I have recently set up a wireless network in my home. </s>
<s> I have two computers(both running XP sp2 home) connected to the network. </s>
<s> They both share the internet signal fine and both computers are online. </s>
<s> Although my computer, computer 2, can see the other computer, computer 1, when I try to access it gives me this message: //Computer 1 is not accessable. </s>
<s> You might not have permision to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administator to find out if you have access permision. </s>
<s> The network path was not found. </s>
<s> On computer 1, computer 2 does not even show up in the network workgroup. </s>
<s> Both computers are set up for file sharing and are in the same workgroup. </s>
<s> Any help with this would be great. </s>

<s> You don't have an account on the other machine. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Firewalls. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The share was created after you added your account to the other machine. </s>

<s> I have the same problem. </s>
<s> Shut off the firewalls and still no help. </s>
<s> Would appreciate help on this as well. </s>
