ok but what about PhysX because some pepole say that Geforce support PhysX but really I do not know what this PhysX is and is there any difference between cards that support PhysX and other that do not it support it in Games and graphic programmes performance because I love games very much and I want the card which provides higher performance in games??
thanks again.
