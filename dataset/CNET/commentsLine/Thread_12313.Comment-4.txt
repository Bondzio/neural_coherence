so what you are saying is, the monitor port &quot;where the cable plugs into&quot; was yanked off the motherboard.
fortunately, you can buy a graphics card or basic monitor card and put one in.
however, i won't say there wasn't any damage to the motherboard itself further than where the port got yanked from but if you are lucky, there isn't.
