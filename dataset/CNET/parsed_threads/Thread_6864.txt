<s> to make a long story short I recently recovered a 40 gig hdd that I stupidly tried to download linux mandrake to a dos partition. </s>
<s> I tried to fix it in dos but it created a 3rd partition and dos fdisk didn't want no part of that. </s>
<s> So, I thought the drive was dead. </s>
<s> Thanks to a recent purchase of partition magic 8 I was able to delete the partitions and work from there. </s>
<s> I also found out I could of done this with xp's disk. </s>
<s> my problem now is I disconnected my 60 gig maxter to protect it, and inserted my new recovered 40 gig western digital as master and loaded a dual boot of XP and Linux mandrake. </s>
<s> After I finally got everything running right I hooked up my maxtor as master, which read secondary master and the west. </s>
<s> dig. </s>
<s> as slave which read as secondary slave. </s>
<s> I booted up in hdd-o through my firmware or bios and right away went to check all the drives and it showed my drives mixed up. </s>
<s> So I ran partition magic and found out my storage drive of 20 gigs of saved stuff,programs,music movies and documents, the drive read unallocated. </s>
<s> My heart raced and I about died because about 5 years worth of Important stuff had been lost. </s>
<s> So I ran partition magic and thankfully I was able to recover the drive. </s>
<s> I tried to do a backup then and it read 7 days and 14hrs. </s>
<s> to backup. </s>
<s> I didn't have the time or that many disks so I went to reboot and went into my bios and swithed to hdd-1 and checked out my xp/linux dual boot and everything was fine so went back to hdd-0 and tried to bood and it said I had a corrupted boot file. </s>
<s> Something like system32.dll boot file has been deleted or corrupt. </s>
<s> please reinstall the file. </s>
<s> Yeah right! </s>
<s> So I unhooked hdd-1 and reloaded XP and everything is fine on that drive. </s>
<s> WHAT DID I DO WRONG? </s>
<s> This sequence worked before until I loaded mandrake on the dos partition. </s>
<s> I read in an earliar discussion that involved Proffitt About Master/slave vs. cable select. </s>
<s> What should I do and how can I tell if I have a cable select ribbon cable? </s>
<s> Also my west. </s>
<s> dig. </s>
<s> 40 gig hdd reads as 57,500mb the same as my 60 gig maxtor. </s>
<s> Is there a way to fix that? </s>
<s> Sorry this wasn't so short! </s>
<s> Skip </s>
<s> http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCS-c.html Many fight this tooth and nail and lose their data. </s>
<s> It sounds like you should identify if your cable is 80 conductor and set it proper. </s>
<s> Some will try master and slave on 80 conductor cables, but I don't. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not sure what 80 conductor is either. </s>
<s> I have many cables in a box. </s>
<s> Some never used. </s>
<s> I will read your link and hope it tells me. </s>
<s> Thanks once again Bob. </s>
<s> Your Great! </s>
<s> Skip </s>
<s> What a bunch of tricky crap! </s>
<s> So this means I need to check if #28 pin is missing in the middle for a 80 conductor cable, right? </s>
<s> And if not I need to set my master drive in the middle and slave at the end? </s>
<s> Right? </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> The issue of master slave jumpers changed years ago (about 5) but to make it live on, the 40 conductor cables are still out there on the second IDE channels. </s>
<s> Here's a picture comparing each cable type... http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html Specifically ... http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/z_000524wires4080.jpg Bob </s>
<s> Hi Skippy333, There is a bit more to add to your story yet! </s>
<s> The cable select bit is probably a bit of a red herring (if you carefully read this article you may get it) http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ide-cable-select.html Cables supplied with most m-boards don't use cable select , but high-speed cables (with 80 instead of 40 wires) do support it. </s>
<s> But there is another problem you ran into - this is with disk partitioning! </s>
<s> Basicly, Microsoft FDISK stinks! </s>
<s> It is better on XP than in earlier Windows (if you partitioned a disk with Win98 FDISK, you got a different result from Win NT4 FDISK - and they couldn't read each others partitions). </s>
<s> But DOS and Windows only allow 4 partitions on a drive and have strict rules as to how they are read, depending on which version of Windows you boot up in. </s>
<s> If you have two drives with a bootable partition on each, DOS/Windows insists that the first bootable partition on the 2nd drive MUST be drive D: which means that connecting a 2nd drive will often give new letters to all your original partitions! </s>
<s> So how come I was able to partition drives into 10 parts in the early 80s!! </s>
<s> I USED A BETTER PARTITIONING UTILITY! </s>
<s> FDISK and DOS didn't exist then and I could put 4 or 5 different operating systems on a drive. </s>
<s> For mere info, read the articles at www.ranish.com/part/ (but beware that Ranish Partition manager is not easy to use). </s>
<s> Another problem is Partition Magic, as it produces 'non-standard' partitions - some other partition managers do not understand them! </s>
<s> Linux is not so limited - it understands the peculiarities of DOS/Windows and will usually add it's own partitions to an existing drive without upsetting things. </s>
<s> But don't expect FDISK to understand what has happened afterwards - it is safer to stick with the Linux partition manager after using it once - and life can still get complicated when you have two hard drives (I run Fedora on a 2nd drive). </s>
