<s> My Hard drive as we speak works a bit than goes silent, I don't have a light where my hard-drive is like most PC's to tell whether its working but its &quot;somewhat&quot; loud, but normally only while playing games. </s>
<s> Lately (perhaps I&quot;m paying more attention) I can hear it working but it stops, much like hard drives I've had in the past. </s>
<s> Is this normal? </s>
<s> Also its 750g, I'm only using around 80g of space atm, so I'm not sure why it's thinking so much? </s>
<s> I run Virus/Malware Scans daily (quick scans)...is that ok to do, or is that working a HD to much? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> My computer has a problem similar to what you have described: It makes a very loud noise whenever there is activity on the computer. </s>
<s> I am uncertain if the noise is from the hard drive or from the cooling fan. </s>
<s> If it is the fan, I would rather have a steady fan noise than the intermittent noises. </s>
