When the power is turned on, the light at the front of the tower goes on.
The cooling fan on the motherboard jumps for a second, but doesn't really start up.
Also, there is a faint noise at one of the drives (I couldn't isolate which one last night).
I haven't contacted Emachines yet, but will probably try replacing the RAM since that's pretty easy to pull out.
