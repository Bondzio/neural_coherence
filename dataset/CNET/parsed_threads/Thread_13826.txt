<s> Hi there, I have a laptop (Win XP SP3) which connects to the Internet via wireless connection. </s>
<s> Configuration is as follows: Laptop connects to AP1 (wireless) AP1 connects to AP2 (ethernet cable) AP2 connects to AP3 (wireless)(AP3 is somewhere in the neighbourhood, i dont know where) Some of the APs or all of them may work as bridges, i dont know since i do not have access to their interfaces. </s>
<s> I have a desktop, which is connected to my laptop with a crossover ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Wireless connection details: IP: 192.168.1.72 Mask: 255.255.0.0 Gateway: 192.168.3.2 DNS: 192.168.3.2 LAN details: Laptop's IP: 10.10.10.1 Desktop's IP: 10.10.10.2 Mask: 255.255.255.0 I want to share the Laptop's internet connection with my desktop. </s>
<s> Tried ICS, bridging, etc. </s>
<s> but nothing seems to be working. </s>
<s> How do I do that? </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> So while I can offer ideas, no one is there to fix it for us. </s>
<s> Having said that... Be sure to use TRACEROUTE on the host (XP) machine to see if there is a 10.10.10.x or 10.x.x.x in the route. </s>
<s> This could cause your NAT (ICS) to fail. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Use that other 168.x.x.x private IP range for ICS. </s>
<s> Also, many are firewalling beyond reason and while you are setting up you must have a firm grasp on the firewall. </s>
<s> For my testing I often turn it off and if it's a third party firewall I often find they break ICS so I uninstall it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thank you, the firewall was causing this trouble. </s>
<s> Is that something you've rules out? </s>
<s> Internet sharing of this type is tricky, quirky and can negatively affect the internet performance of both. </s>
<s> ICS uses a specific network address scheme for host and client PCs. </s>
<s> Try to better define the hardware that is in your home. </s>
<s> You said AP 1, 2 and 3 but the connection layout doesn't sound right. </s>
<s> Might this be some sort of wireless subscriber network that's available in your neighborhood that would cost you more if you connect more than one device? </s>
<s> That the usual was found and conquered. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My desktop computer has actually a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> However, as you wrote, i would have to pay more if i wanted my desktop to connect wirelessly to the same AP. </s>
<s> i know that this is not the best solution, but its free </s>
