Just type GENERIC INKS in the search vacility. I have contacted firms on Ebay selling printers with non original cartridges and they state that Epsom is still covered by the manufactures warranty. Do look at a bulk feed system for extreme cheapness though. Look At 7dayshop.com for cheap original photo paper.
