1.1.1	Earlier today as I left my computer running in my room my child began to explore my work area .	St
1.1.2	At first I was okay with it but suddenly hear a popping sound there .	St
1.1.3	I turn around to see that my child had taken the smaller end of a USB cord and stuck it into the operating end of a nearby power socket .	St
1.1.4	The buzzing stopped as the breaker tripped , but the end of the cord was charred and burnt .	St
1.1.5	My computer does n't seem to be showing any signs of damage , but I am afraid to use it .	St
1.1.6	I am using my laptop to type this ; would my computer suffer damage ?	Ques
1.1.7	If so , how bad would it be ?	Ques
1.2.1	Since any advice could result in liability if the machine kills you , the only right answer in the USA would be to have an electrician test the setup for any problems .	St
1.2.2	But for me , my own I 'd count my lucky stars and add +1 then carry on using the PC .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	1st things 1st , prevent that from happening again and place & quot ; child prevention AC plug covers & quot ; on AC outlets .	St
1.3.2	You can attest as you and child were very fortunate that day .	St
1.3.3	Next , do n't use that USB cord again in any way , but buy the replacement .	St
1.3.4	Remove the USB cord if still attached at port .	St
1.3.5	Next , power-ON the PC and check results .	St
1.3.6	I strongly urge do n't use that USB port and probable one next to it ( tape them closed ) .	St
1.3.7	The best case scenario is the USB port ( s ) are gone but PC works as the USB circuitry is blown away at immediate point or similar .	St
1.3.8	The flip side is that PC does n't boot-up , yada , yada .	St
1.3.9	However , if it does then do an immediate back-up or save your critical data you deem so , ASAP do n't play around just do it .	St
1.3.10	After all is done and the PC seems to be working , do as you always done or close to it , plan on any replacement action or how things go .	St
1.3.11	Play it safe until you feel comfortable on use of that PC .	St
1.3.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
