1.1.1	First off, I own a Gateway GT4016 desktop computer.	St
1.1.2	On the front there's a little panel thing in one of the slots like where the dvd drive is fixed that has a USB connection and two slots labeled &quot;SD/MMC/SM/MS/MS-PRO/xD&quot; and &quot;CF/MICRODRIVE&quot;.	St
1.1.3	I, being the genius that I am, inserted my CF card from my camera into the CF drive, but I think I did it backwards.	St
1.1.4	It wasn't reading and didn't click or anything, so I got tweezers to try to pull it out, but that just pushed it in more and now I can't even try to pull it out from the front.	St
1.1.5	It doesn't read on My Computer and whenever I try to open the drive called &quot;CompactFlashI/II (H:)&quot; it says I need to insert a disk.	St
1.1.6	If I click eject, it does nothing.	St
1.1.7	My question is, how do I go about getting my card back out?	St
1.1.8	Any help would be appreciated!	St
1.1.9	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Most desktops allow the removal of the covers/skins.	St
1.2.2	If your system allows this then remove the frt.	St
1.2.3	bezel/cover.	St
1.2.4	You'll gain greater access maybe the depth of the bezel removed will be enough to grip the CF card.	St
1.2.5	Otherwise, if that area itself can be removed as like a cage unit to gain further access w/o actually tearing down the unit itself.	St
1.2.6	You'll still have to open case, etc.	St
1.2.7	to get into this.	St
1.2.8	All this info is generic in nature, you have to check then proceed.	St
1.2.9	I exclude any possible damage that may have happened if the CF card port was permanent.	St
1.2.10	All those memory cards, I can't recall if it used contact pins to mount vs. pads on the CF card.	St
1.2.11	You'll need to inspect after CF removal the card and port for continued us.	St
1.2.12	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	try this see if the lower right corner of the screen where the system tray are show a white box with a upward green arror that same icon you see if you have a usb drive installed in if yes try clicking it.	St
1.3.2	try to see if you can eject the card treating it like if it was a usb drive 2nd option start computer then you will see a listing of all your drive right click on the drive where your card is see if you can get a pop up menu with the word 'eject' showing as one of the menu choice try clicking the eject from there to see if the card will come out good luck	St
