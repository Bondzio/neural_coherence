epson photo stylus rx700 is what i have,and i'd like to see a better printer.
i don't think so!
prints 8 1/2 x 11 and down,prints cd's dvd's greeting cards,and much more.
it has 6 inks,which i get (generic)for $3.16 each!
prints better than a photo shop!
no clogging problems at all with the rx 700. plus i received a $150 rebate!
after a years use ,i love it more and more!
