I am using Win XP Home, NERO dvd burning software and my burner is _NEC DVD_RW ND-1300A.
Everything has worked fine in burning my movies for months.
Now suddenly when I try to burn, I get the msg &quot;illlegal disc&quot; &quot;could not perform start of disc-at-once&quot; I am using Ritek brand of discs and they have worked fine for me for a long time.
The support group at Nero has been no help.
I am desperate so if someone could pls make a suggestion!!
thanks in advance Virgil Hummel
