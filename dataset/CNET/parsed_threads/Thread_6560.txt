<s> I have an external harddrive that I use to back up my pc, but I am running out of room to store files (lots of graphics). </s>
<s> I don't really want to save my graphics files to CD because I like to have easy access to them. </s>
<s> Should I purchase another internal or external harddrive, and if so, how would I then backup the files stored on these? </s>
<s> I'm a newbie to hardware issues, so I appreciate any help you may offer. </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>
<s> Your external hard disk is not a backup. </s>
<s> You can find posts in these forums where externals have &quot;lost it all&quot; along with their &quot;backups&quot; on said external. </s>
<s> Where is the real backup of what you can't lose? </s>

<s> I thought I could use my external harddrive to backup my files. </s>
<s> This is what I was told when I purchased it. </s>
<s> This isn't true? </s>
<s> If not, then what is the easiest way to backup my files? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>

<s> I find a DVD writer to be nice. </s>
<s> 4 gigabytes on a DVDRW and just a few hold what I can't lose. </s>
<s> I have 3 copies. </s>

<s> Is there a DVD writer you would recommend? </s>
<s> At the office we use generic names like Teac, Liteon, Sony, LG and more. </s>
<s> We pay from 39 to 99 bucks for the drives and use software such as CDBurnerXP or other titles. </s>
<s> It all works and if we do lose a drive (rare, but happens) we replace it and move on. </s>
<s> Some want to analyze the makes, models until they find the best solution. </s>
<s> We can't do that so we buy it, install it and start using it. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Thank you very much for your help. </s>
<s> I guess I'm off to buy a DVD writer! </s>
