1.1.1	Hi I have a very small hard drive .	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if there is an easy way to copy everything from my hard drive to a USB flash drive ?	Ques
1.1.3	Also , if drive C crashed , could the USB flash drive , which is E , be used as a backup ?	Ques
1.1.4	Would the computer know it is supposed to boot off of it ?	Ques

1.2.1	If your flash drive is larger than the HD , you may be able to copy it over but this is n't going to make it bootable or save you from a hard drive failure .	St
1.2.2	As well , if your HD is NTFS , you may have trouble getting larger files to copy to the flash drive .	St
1.2.3	These tend to be formatted in FAT32 and you 'd need to change that to NTFS .	St
1.2.4	You 'd really only copy your data and not your programs to the flash drive anyway .	St
1.2.5	They wo n't run from the flash drive and only take up space unnecessarily .	St
1.3.1	Thanks Steven First I do n't intend to change FAT32 to NTFS since this is above my knowledge level .	St
1.3.2	I do n't have that much data other than about 11Gb of music .	St
1.3.3	I was hoping that a flash drive was bootable since I just had a serious problem with my computer and this seemed like a simple idea that might work .	St
1.3.4	So people get a USB hard drive ( my guess ) and do the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard thing ( which I 've never done ) ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.5	Will the computer boot from that if the original hard disk crashed ?	Ques
1.3.6	P.S .	St
1.3.7	original hard disk = 40 Gb - Stephen	St
1.4.1	Lot safer .	St
1.5.1	You do n't need any kind of wizard to transfer data from a hard drive to a flash drive .	St
1.5.2	The reason I mentioned going with NTFS is only if you have some very large files as FAT32 has something of a 4gb limit and folks who download movies and stuff can have some fairly large files .	St
1.5.3	If you do n't do that , there 's no problem .	St
1.5.4	The flash drive is seen in explorer just like any other drive .	St
1.5.5	You can select files or entire folder and just copy and paste them from one drive to the other .	St
1.5.6	As for the flash drive being bootable after that ... .sorry ... nope .	St
1.5.7	It 's possible to make a flash drive bootable to run some utilities but not Windows .	St
1.6.1	Thanks ahtoi .	St
1.7.1	Thanks Steven ( Yes , explorer sees my 2 Gb flash chip as drive E. I noticed that a while back . )	St
1.7.2	BUT as I said ( not talking about a flash chip now ) : & quot ; So people get a USB hard drive ( my guess ) and do the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard thing ... & quot ; I think in a round about way this may have been answered .	St
1.7.3	( Forget about the flash chip for now . )	St
1.7.4	If my drive C crashed and I had transfered everything to a USB hard dirve by using the wizard in Windows ... would the computer boot up from the USB port with the USB hard drive cabled to it ?	Ques
1.7.5	It seems you 're saying no , and there is no EASY way to create a bootable full disk back up .	St
1.7.6	Thanks , and sorry about the confusion here .	Polite
1.7.7	I hope we 're close to the end .	St
1.7.8	-Stephen	St
1.8.1	It might be possible to create a compressed drive image on a large enough flash drive that could be restored to a new HD in the event your old one failed .	St
1.8.2	That 's another story but there 's no & quot ; wizard & quot ; that 's going transfer your hard drive to a USB flash drive that you can boot from .	St
1.8.3	Sorry 'bout that .	St
