My HP system also has 64 bit Vista.
The Matlab program takes about an hour on this system, which seems reasonable, there's a lot of math.
The cnet benchmark specs gave these 2 systems comparable performance, although the Dell should be faster, all tests were done with 64 bit Vista (if I remember correctly).
The main difference between the HP & the Dell is the processor, but that shouldn't lead to such a vast difference in performance (1 hr on the HP vs 2 hrs on the Dell), should it?
