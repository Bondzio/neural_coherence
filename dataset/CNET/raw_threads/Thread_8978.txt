Since the PSU at that price point is going to be trouble, I'll toss out the next best upgrade. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-5450,2549.html It's a step up from your 4350 and may even use less Watts. If you want to change the PSU, get the new big PSU in there (I suggest a SINGLE RAIL UNIT) then with your remaining bucks, use this list. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html

3422	8	552189	5255734	5255720	R. Proffitt	1/4/12 9:01 PM	1.32571086E12	No.	While I like Creative Labs and if they are still in the game, Turtle Beach I rarely see a reason for this today. Why? Because if I use HDMI the sound card is not used. Bob
