i have run all scans there are to be run.
i was just on the phone with these guys from d-link support they have reseted and tweaked my settings.
it seems to work a little better, but when i activate the wep security mode it seems to be going the same old problem.
i can't rely on an open system to run my wireless connection.
it seems to me very strange that this was not happening for the first week i have had this router.
how come all of a sudden it began doing this nonsense.
