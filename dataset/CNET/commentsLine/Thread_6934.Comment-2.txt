most desktops allow the removal of the covers/skins.
if your system allows this then remove the frt.
bezel/cover.
you'll gain greater access maybe the depth of the bezel removed will be enough to grip the cf card.
otherwise, if that area itself can be removed as like a cage unit to gain further access w/o actually tearing down the unit itself.
you'll still have to open case, etc.
to get into this.
all this info is generic in nature, you have to check then proceed.
i exclude any possible damage that may have happened if the cf card port was permanent.
all those memory cards, i can't recall if it used contact pins to mount vs. pads on the cf card.
you'll need to inspect after cf removal the card and port for continued us.
