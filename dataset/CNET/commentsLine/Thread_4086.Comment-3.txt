i found out that i have a jumperfree motherboard so there's no way of setting a jumper on my motherboard to recognize the sdram.
i ran across something as i was googling.
a person was told by an asus vendor that the sdram controllers on this motherboard aren't stable.
i have a feeling there's no way of making them stable.
i think i'll be buying a new motherboard.
