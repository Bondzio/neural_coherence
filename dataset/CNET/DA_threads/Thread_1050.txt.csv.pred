1.1.1	Hey all I need some help .	St
1.1.2	at work we are trying to put 2 computers in the same room , the room has only one port , and since we are renting our space from a larger company they do n't want us putting a router or anything else up that would hide a PC behind its own IP .	St
1.1.3	So I was thinking of maybe a switch or hub ?	Ques
1.1.4	Are they the same ?	Ques
1.1.5	And do they create there own IP ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks Lee	St
1.2.1	You need another ethernet card on one box .	St
1.2.2	Set it up as a sever for LAN and the second box as a client .	St
1.3.1	If it 's like most places , that 's all you need .	St
