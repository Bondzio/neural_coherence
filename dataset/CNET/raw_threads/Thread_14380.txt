Needless to say, there are a lot more choices nowadays. I've looked at Cyberpowerpc, iBuyPC, and Alienware. Is there another good vendor I should be looking at? I have about $1600 to spend on a gaming system. Here are the basics I am looking at: Case - No clue! There are way too many choices. I don't care about flash, only functionality/noise. CyberpowerPC lists about 20 cases. Which is the best for price? 800W PS Quad-Core)Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 @ 2.83GHz 1333FSB 12MB L2 Cache 64-bit Cooling - Again too many choices.
