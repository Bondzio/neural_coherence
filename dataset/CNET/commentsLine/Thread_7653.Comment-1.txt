tried to turn on my pc today, and it wouldn't turn on.
not a thing.
no lights, no nothing.
i'm guessing this means the psu has given up the ghost, but there were no tell tale signs (like black smoke ;)).
just looking for confirmation that this can happen just like that, it is a pretty old psu, about 5 years now.
