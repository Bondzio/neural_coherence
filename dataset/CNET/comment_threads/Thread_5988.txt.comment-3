Hi Donnie Agreeing with Jbking but would like to add this.
You should plan and prepare carefully while choosing the components.
You must get a SLI ( in case of Nvidia) or a Crossfire ( in case of ATI) certified motherboard and Graphic card(s).
Also a bigger PSU because two cards will need more power.
If you do not go for a SLI or Crossfire certified motherboard , you won't be able to add a second graphic card , unless you change the motherboard .
Same goes for the graphic card ; it won't be useful in dual graphic card config if it is not SLI or Crossfire certified.
