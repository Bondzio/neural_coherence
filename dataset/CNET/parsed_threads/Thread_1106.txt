<s> Hi, I want to buy 2 of these computers: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dell-Optiplex-GX270-Professional-pre-installed/dp/B001O018Y2/ref=sr_1_6?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1291734289&sr=1-6 and was wondering if it is possible to link the 2 together so it is one computer? </s>
<s> If so could tell me what I have to do to link them. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But folk are often thinking that this adds ram or cpu power to your Windows machines. </s>
<s> It doesn't. </s>

<s> I dont think what you are trying to do is possible. </s>
<s> you could put the computers on your network. </s>
<s> If you use a basic wireless router with wired connections, you could set up file sharing to where all files on each computer would be accessible by the other. </s>
<s> You must give the files proper permissions so that you can access them from each computer. </s>
<s> It always a lot more painless if you use the same userid and password on the computers. </s>
