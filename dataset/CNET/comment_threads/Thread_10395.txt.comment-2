I'm not sure I understand your concern, but doesn't this device support bluetooth?
If so, you can buy a $15 adapter for the laptop and copy stuff back and forth.
I have an LG smart phone that works like that, although I've never had any other brand.
I do have an Android based Kindle Fire which I can connect to my laptop via a micro USB cable, and it works just fine as well.
` Good luck.
