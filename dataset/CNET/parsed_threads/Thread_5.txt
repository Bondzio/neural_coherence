<s> I would like to buy this LCD Display. </s>
<s> From the reviews, it all looks great but I have a few questions: 1. </s>
<s> Is the display really worth the price tag in terms of picture quality and overall performance? </s>
<s> I mean I could get a pretty reasonable LCD Display in this price but still if Apple is the best out there, then its worth it. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do these displays also carry problems such as dead pixels or bright dots (specially) right out of the box? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Any other problems related to LCD technology? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I think so. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> All LCD panels carry the problem of dead or bright pixels, right out of the box. </s>
<s> It's a problem with LCD production. </s>
<s> 1 dead or bright pixel does not constitute a defective monitor for any manufacturer. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Not as far as I know. </s>
<s> I have two of Apple's LCD displays, both have been running for years with no problems. </s>
