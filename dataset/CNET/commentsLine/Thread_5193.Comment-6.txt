i looked the 2900 xt and read somewhere it wants 39 amperes on the 12v rail.
i doubt a 350 watt power supply delivers that because 39 times 12 is 468 watts.
even at idle it may be half that or 19 amperes and many 350w supplies have 10 ampere 12v rails.
you'll likely need to fit a 700+ watt power supply with a watchful eye on the amperes per rail.
just asking.
didn't the seller warn you of this?
