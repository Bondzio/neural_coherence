I have read the article and have set up everything on the vista system as specified and my xp system can now see the vista system on the network, but still cannot see any files.
I have shared the C: drive on vista to save time, but do I need to share individual folders?
The goal here is to be able to use the easy transfer option between the systems, but until the vista system is shared on the network easy transfer will not work.
Any ideas?
