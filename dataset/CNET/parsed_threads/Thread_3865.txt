<s> I recently (about 3 or 4 weeks ago) purchased a Lexmark X4975 All-in-one wireless printer and installed it without too much difficulty. </s>
<s> However, since I set it up, something occurred that has caused it not to work, either wirelessly or via USB. </s>
<s> When hooked up via USB, I get the usual recognition of the printer, everything looks fine, it shows up in the printer list, but when I try to print, it claims that it isn't communicating. </s>
<s> When trying to print wirelessly, the printer progress window pops up, shows 5 or 10% progress then it stalls. </s>
<s> I have a feeling that it may be the installation of Service Pack 3. </s>
<s> (I have a Compaq V6000 laptop running XP Pro). </s>
<s> In my household, there are two other laptops that can print wirelessly just fine. </s>
<s> They both have XP Home ( I am unsure whether they have SP3 yet) Lexmark Tech support is stumped at the moment. </s>
<s> I can't recall exactly when I upgraded to SP3. </s>
<s> Is there a log by which I can find out when that was installed on my computer? </s>
<s> Beyond that, does anybody have any other theories? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> What FW Software are you running? </s>
<s> The theory of it being SP 3 is not an option as works with other people and Lexmark Printers. </s>
<s> Have you been giving a SR number? </s>
<s> If so please post it. </s>
<s> I am running the standard Windows firewall. </s>
<s> I will need you to explain what an SR number is and how it applies to this issue. </s>
<s> And just so I am clear, SP3 does NOT work with Lexmark Printers? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> No SP 3 DOES work with Lexmark Printers, I was stating that that would not be the cause of your issue. </s>
<s> An SR number is something that the Agent would give you at the end of your call so if you call back it can be looked at. </s>
<s> I was wondering what troubleshooting they have done. </s>
<s> The printer you have is one of Lexmarks newest printers. </s>
<s> Have you tried updating the firmware which is located below. </s>
<s> ftp://ftp.lexmark.com/driver/inkjet_drivers/4900/firmware/4900SeriesFirmwareUpdate.exe </s>
<s> I just got a call back from Lexmark and they ran me through the fix. </s>
<s> Apparently, the lxdr_device service was disabled so I just had to go into services.msc to enable it to start automatically. </s>
<s> All told, a very simple fix, but it took a lot of wrangling to get it fixed. </s>
<s> Ah, well. </s>
<s> Life is good again now that I can print again! </s>
<s> From my other searching on the net regarding SP3 and lexmark printers, this is a common problem with SP3 disabling this service. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help and input. </s>
