hi... LadyDi23, you looked in the &quot;right place&quot; assuming Netgear had used the MS sound protocol... alas, no.
I understand your problem--the chimy-chime sound it makes is the same as the default Outlook Mail notification sound.
Annoying and/or confusing!
Turning off the sound is anything but intuitive.
To DISABLE the sound, double click on the Netgear icon in the system tray which will open the &quot;Netgear WG511v2 Smart Wizard.&quot; On the settings tab, at the bottom in the blue connection info bar (contains signal strength at right, antenna w/ name at left), right click on the &quot;Connected to Internet&quot; text and then select &quot;Disable Notification&quot; To CHANGE the sound, rename ConnectToInternet.wav (in C:\Program Files\NETGEAR\WG511v2 or wherever you installed your router files) to ConnectToInternet_old.wav.
Copy your new favorite sound into that directory and rename it ConnectToInternet.wav.
Enjoy.
Hope this helped!
