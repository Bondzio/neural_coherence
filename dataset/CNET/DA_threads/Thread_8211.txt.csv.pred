1.1.1	I have a Dell Precision 490 Workstation running Windows Vista Ultimate .	St
1.1.2	I have a set of Logitech speakers that came with a subwoofer but the wire to the & quot ; Right & quot ; speaker got cut , so I am only using the & quot ; Left & quot ; and the subwoofer .	St
1.1.3	Many off my songs have separate left and right stereo audio tracks but because the right speaker is gone I ca n't hear them .	St
1.1.4	Is there any software change or program I can download to have windows merge the left and right tracks so I hear them both out of the one speaker I have ?	Ques
1.2.1	I would n't think it should be that difficult .	St
1.2.2	But , you 'd have to have a & quot ; mono & quot ; mode available in the software to mix the channels .	St
1.2.3	Look for that option .	St
