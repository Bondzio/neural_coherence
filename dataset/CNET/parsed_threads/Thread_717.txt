<s> I work (non-IT) for a company with several computers (98 to XP pro) and I dabble in PC repair on the side. </s>
<s> They have asked me to setup a backup system for approx. </s>
<s> 10 machines. </s>
<s> About 20 computers exist on this network. </s>
<s> What they would like me to do is backup these computers nightly to a single computer that would solely be used for this purpose. </s>
<s> I know it's not the best or safest backup plan and I have expressed this to them. </s>
<s> At a subsidiary in another city a tech has done this for them and they seem happy with it. </s>
<s> I own 3 software backup programs that are not in use, so I would gladly sell them one ie..Norton Ghost 2003, Acronis True Image v8.0, and Stomp BackupMyPc. </s>
<s> I have in the past cloned my own drive, but I have not done nightly incremental backups before. </s>
<s> I want to do this for them, but I have no idea exactly how to do it. </s>
<s> My questions....I know its probably a detailed procedure, but does anyone feel like walking me through this in simple terms or can anyone direct me to a site that describes this process in easy to understand language. </s>
<s> Secondly, would one of my programs be the way to go or should I use Windows own automated backup (this is what was used in the aforementioned 'other' city). </s>
<s> It seems to me that either way this should not be such a difficult task, but it certainly has me confused. </s>
<s> I hope someone can help me. </s>
<s> I really want to do this for them as I could win some brownie points with my employer. </s>
<s> I've googled this and have found very little in the tutorial area and what I have found was incomplete or very difficult to comprehend. </s>
<s> Most sites do not really recommend this plan as a great backup method, therefore offer little or no help. </s>
<s> Also the tutorials/help files in the above programs seem quite vague and again some what incomplete for a novice. </s>
<s> My boss may not want to backup 10 machines, I was guessing, however I am certain that he would like to backup at least one. </s>
<s> I guess if I can figure out one machine, I can do ten. </s>
<s> Again, if someone can help me, with possibly even a vague description of how to do this, I could probably figure the rest out.Any advice or direction will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> You guys have never let me down in the past and I am grateful for that. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> You are talking &quot;business class&quot; and not what we might use at home. </s>
<s> Be sure you understand that you never back up the entire machine, but just user created files. </s>
