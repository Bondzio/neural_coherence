1.1.1	Hey all, I've purchased an Atlon 1.6 ghz 256mb ram, everything was running smoothly on it however each time I installed a game, when I played it I sometimes receiced some reboots, this was starting to become a concern and a bother cause 20 min on your game the computer reboot at random times, I though maybe it was because I overclocked my CPU so I went in the BIOS and reset everything in default, now when my PC boots up again, it will allways reboot before hitting to WindowsXP and on occasions when I hit DELETE to go back to BIOS it reboots, if I leave the computer on it will keep on doing a cycle reboot and ask me to run on safe more or normal mode.	St
1.1.2	I even tried to re - image my pc, as soon as it goes to boot to the cd-rom it reboots.	St
1.1.3	Could it be the Hard drive Corrupt ( I don't know) Could it be the ram stick ( I don't know) Could it be my system board ( I don't know) I am clueless on what to do, like I said it was rebooting on games before and now it freaks out and reboots until I turn it off.	St
