i have a dell desktop running windows xp.
i recently purchased a brand new epson printer (the exact same model of the one i had before), i installed the printer and all of the software, but my computer will not recognize the printer.
i think my ports may be bad (is it possible that all 5 ports can be bad?)
i have spent numerous hours on the phone with dell, microsoft and epson and no one can pin point the problem, (each manufacturer is blaming the other) my computer is working just fine i'm not having any other issues with my os.
i tried to plug in my digital camera and once again, the computer will not recognize that either.
i have done all of the basic trouble shooting that i know to do, i have gone to the device manager to check for any weird errors and everything looks fine.
i called a local company and they say that my os is hosed.
i don't know what else to do any help would be greatly appreciated!
