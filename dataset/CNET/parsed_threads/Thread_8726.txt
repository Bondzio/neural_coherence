<s> A little while ago, I was advised that I could use NTFS-3G coupled with MacFUSE in order to backup a MacBook to an NTFS formatted external hard drive. </s>
<s> Looks like this may be necessary, b/c my wife's MacBook is having serious issues (has become ridiculously slow - don't know why). </s>
<s> If I do this, and then get the machine repaired in a way that wipes her internal hard drive clean, should we be able to restore her machine from the NTFS-formatted external drive? </s>
<s> I assume that I'll have to re-install NTFS-3G and MacFuse before doing so, but after that, should I be able to restore the MacBook? </s>
<s> You can restore the machine with the Apple OS DVD then install fuse then copy your files back. </s>
<s> Sorry that I misunderstood your needs. </s>
<s> These TWO are different goals. </s>
<s> 1. restore the MacBook. </s>
<s> 2. restore my files. </s>
<s> Thanks - and no, you didn't misunderstand. </s>
<s> It's only in the last day or so that we thought her hard drive might be in trouble; originally, I was just curious about backing up her data as a &quot;just in case&quot; sort of thing. </s>
<s> Much appreciated. </s>
