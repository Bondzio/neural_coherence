1.1.1	I've heard a lot about overclocking the processor and the video card for a better performance in contrast to more heat and damage on the long run.	St
1.1.2	I have an Intel Pentium 4 @ 2.4Ghz and a GeForce FX5500 256mb AGP.	St
1.1.3	Do you think overclocking in certain 3d games like Dawn of War and the like would provide better performance without conflicts?	St
1.1.4	If so, how to do that?	St
1.1.5	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	from an XP issue!	St
1.2.2	Try this site http://www.overclockers.com/	St

1.4.1	OC'ing just isn't as rewarding as it was in the past.	St
1.4.2	The small gain you get may not be worth it.	St
1.4.3	You truly have to consider the &quot;whole&quot; system in regards to any OC'ing.	St
1.4.4	This will be cooling, friendly mtrbd.	St
1.4.5	setting, solid componets, a &quot;VERY STABLE&quot; psu, and top level cpu, like a P4 vs a Celeron.	St
1.4.6	Disregard any portion of this and the system becomes unstable or fails too quickly.	St
1.4.7	Plus, whatever gain you get is far smaller now compared to the olden Pentium days, etc.. if you can't follow tips/hints from the overclockers website(a good website), then leave well enough alone until you're ready, plain and simple.	St
1.4.8	OC'ing is a gamble and learning experience for 1st timers.	St
1.4.9	I suggest baby steps until you feel comfortable, don't go hog wild.	St
1.4.10	tada -----Willy	St
