the real question is, how much money do you want to spend on a computer now.
everyone wants to live out there on the bleeding edge of technology, but few of us can.
you are in the unique position of living at a major change in technology.
you could buy now and get the top of the line 32 bit pcs for a reasonable price, or (as i would advise) waite a while, let the new 64 bit, dual core pcs come down in price, and buy one of them.
let intel and amd fight it out and buy the winner.
the 64 bit is the future.
i say look forward, because standing still is going backward.
remember, buy the best computer core (mother board, cpu, and memory) you can afford.
you can always add to it as your finances permit.
