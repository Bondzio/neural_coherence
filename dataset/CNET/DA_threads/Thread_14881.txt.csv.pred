1.2.1	Just go to Virtual Servers and fill in the first line , select Enable , give it a Description of FTP on one line make the inbound and outbound port the FTP port ( 21 ) and then set the Private IP address to the Fixed IP of the FTP server system ( you ca n't use DHCP on the FTP and Web servers ) .	St
1.2.2	Under private port put the same as the FTP port number ... .21 .	St
1.2.3	Once you save it any traffic for the FTP server will be directed to its ip .	St
1.2.4	You do the same for the web server but assign port 80 since that is the HTTP Web port .	St
