1.1.1	I live in a 3 story townhouse and my pc is set up on the first floor .	St
1.1.2	My cable company provides my internet and phone services .	St
1.1.3	I am on bedrest and am restricted to the 3rd floor so I have purchased a laptop .	St
1.1.4	I want to be able to use it from the 3rd floor so I need to set up some type of network .	St
1.1.5	I called the cable company and was told all I need to do is get a splitter and wireless router and hook it up to my cable connection on the third floor .	St
1.1.6	I believe it entails more than that and wanted to check .	St
1.1.7	I thought the router needed to be connected to my cable modem but that would n't work for me since it is on the 1st floor .	St
1.1.8	any advice would be helpful .	Polite
1.2.1	signal will reach the top floor .	St
1.2.2	Some will move the router closer using a length of ethernet cable .	Sug
1.2.3	Others have success in improving the reception by using those antenna extenders .	St
1.2.4	Only a test drive will tell .	St
1.3.1	You need to hook the wireless router up to your cable modem .	St
1.3.2	Then you will hook your PC up to the wireless router , through one of its wired jacks .	St
1.3.3	After you hook up your new router to your wireless modem , make sure you reboot ( power off , power on ) the modem .	St
1.3.4	The problem you will probably encounter is that the wireless signal may not reach from the first floor to the third floor .	St
1.3.5	The easiest way around this is to move your cable modem to the second floor .	St
1.3.6	This will only work if you can move your phone up also .	St
1.3.7	If you have a cable jack that you are not using , then you will not need a splitter .	St
1.3.8	Otherwise , disconnect the TV or cable box from the wall .	St
1.3.9	Then connect a two-way splitter to the wall using a short cable .	St
1.3.10	Make sure to connect the input side of the splitter to the wall .	St
1.3.11	Then reconnect the cable box or TV to one of the output jacks of the splitter .	St
1.3.12	Then connect your cable modem to the other output of the splitter .	St
1.3.13	Now you will need to connect a wireless card to your pc downstairs .	St
1.3.14	The easiest way to do this is to use a USB wireless card .	St
1.3.15	You should have adequate wireless signal to connect to upstairs and downstairs .	St
1.3.16	If these options do not work for you , then you will have to install some additional ethernet wiring .	St
1.4.1	With your wireless router you can buy a compatable antenna for it that has a stronger dbi range .	St
1.4.2	For example .	St
1.4.3	Most wireless routers come with antennas that may have a max range of about 2dbi which indoors is about 100-300 feet but this leaves opertunities for dead spots or poor wireless signal .	St
1.4.4	That is why some hotels only offer wireless from the lobby because it is closer to the wireless router .	St
1.4.5	But if you get a antenna with a higher dbi like for example a 7dbi your range will be tripled .	St
1.4.6	I would think of this way as being the cheapest method .	St
1.4.7	Otherwise you can add a range expander to your wireless router that is ac adaptable and the signal should reach fine .	St
