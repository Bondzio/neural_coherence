My only question is why buy an SLI mobo with a PSU and VidCard that won't support it?
I know value is good and it's a good compromise if you plan to go that route in the future.
My philosophy is top-of-the-line or bottom, I would get an even cheaper Vid if it's only a temporary card.
Good components all around should be a solid rig but no chest hair...yet
