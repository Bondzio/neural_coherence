<s> My father is in the market for a color printer to print high quality pictures from a Canon S60. </s>
<s> I would like to hear from people in this forum, what they would suggest. </s>
<s> Right now we are looking at Minolta Magicolor 2430DL, Canon i960, Epson Stylus Photo R800 and there are so many HP that I do not even know where to start (though I will look at the Photosmart 7960). </s>
<s> Am I missing anything? </s>
<s> As for price, it is not a big concern, he just wants quality prints. </s>
<s> I have pictures from Epson C42's and up on the walls at the office and home. </s>
<s> Would that be good enough? </s>

<s> Quality, looks like it came from your local photo shop (walmart, drug store, etc) and you would not be able to tell the difference. </s>
<s> Is that enough of a definition? </s>
<s> I'd have to use the glossy paper. </s>
<s> I don't use the glossy paper since it's under glass or acrylic. </s>
<s> In closing it does not look like what comes from walmart since its a slightly differenct technology. </s>
<s> But I will not go to said walmart since its great stuff. </s>
<s> If you want exactly what walmart would look like, then you can not use an ink jet. </s>
<s> You'll look at dye sublimation printers. </s>
<s> If that's what you want? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My understanding, although I don't claim to be an expert, is that while many &quot;home&quot; printers do a very nice job printing photos on glossy or matte photo paper... the ink isn't the same as photo processing ink and eventually your home printed photos will fade. </s>
<s> Which is to say the pictures will fade faster than if you had them professionally processed. </s>
<s> Having said that, back up your home photos on CDs, make your glossy prints, and if you have to print them again in 5 or 10 years, so be it. </s>
<s> In my humble opinion the ability to crop and adjust the photos is such a big plus it outweighs any issue of permanence. </s>
<s> My HP Officejet 5510 all-in-one does terrific photos. </s>
<s> I wish the cost of ink cartridges were lower, but such is life. </s>
