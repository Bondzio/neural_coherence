But even more surprising is it comes with dual +12v rails. But still the psu is crappy with very low +12V rail voltages. But its 400watt and has dual +12V rails, pretty good.

I bought a new PC case which inclused a 450w psu and found it was a better idea as the price of both was little more that the stand individual PSU i would have bought regards ........ John
