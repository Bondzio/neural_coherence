Hi Terry, If you are going to go by the basics as configured in your reference, it looks good, but I have two suggestions: You need a Modem to get on the internet with dial-up.
If you plan on playing all the current high end games and especially those in the future, the configuration with internal graphics even the GMA 900 will disappoint you.
I suggest you get at least the Nvida GeForce 6600 PCI-Express that they list for $100 more which coincides with your motherboard.
With the other specs you should be good for high tech games now and for the next several years.
