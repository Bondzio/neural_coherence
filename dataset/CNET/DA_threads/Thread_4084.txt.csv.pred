1.1.1	I have a desktop computer with an Intel Celeron processor, but is just 1.8ghz, so i'm thinking in buying an Intel Celeron Dual Core 2.2ghz (Is just and everyday computer, but I want to play Spore Galactic Adventures and with 1.8ghz I can't) so I found one at great price.	St
1.1.2	But I wonder, Do I need to buy another heatsink and fan to my desktop, or the ones from my old Celeron work just fine?	St
1.1.3	Thanks in advance for your replies.	St
1.2.1	come with a HS Fan and a 3 year warranty.	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Oh, I didn't knew that.	St
1.3.2	Thanks and sorry to bother again, but, does it comes with the thermal compound/grease?	St
