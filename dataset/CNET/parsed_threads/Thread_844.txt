<s> Hi there I need some advice on which tablet/pc hybrid to get. </s>
<s> I list below my requirements. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise on what is already on the market, or due to come on to the market soon? </s>
<s> Also, if anyone can explain to me about stylus pressure sensitivity: is this facility made possible by the type of stylus pen one uses, or by the technology of the tablet, or a combination of both? </s>
<s> Any advice gratefully received. </s>
<s> Tim My requirements: PC element: Operating Windows 8 Tablet element: Android PC/tablet configuration: Connected as one unit and tablet detachable Windows and apps operable from tablet on its own Screen size: 10-13 inches (preferably 13) Keyboard: Full size Palm block technology Digitiser pen (for varying pressure) Art software/apps that facilitate above Storage space: Not bothered On from standby time: Min 5 seconds Internet: Wifi, 3G? </s>
<s> Connections: USB, Ethernet (ideally) </s>
<s> &quot;Digitiser pen (for varying pressure)&quot; There is a Lenovo that might show up with the Wacom technology but when we looked at the model on the site, the pressure sensor as well as Wacom was absent. </s>
<s> From your list it appears you found such a device but can I ask why you didn't share it? </s>

<s> It's for artists. </s>
<s> The usual art person wants this so they can get some effect as they draw. </s>
<s> The artists I know have NEVER gone for a tablet or laptop with the Wacom. </s>
<s> They set up the drawing on the Cintiq device. </s>
<s> I am however running into new artists that seem to get upset as you discuss this area. </s>
<s> A few have burst into flames. </s>

<s> Hi Bob Thanks for this - very helpful. </s>
<s> My research so far suggests that the following models could do the job: Microsoft surface Pro - comes with pressure sensitive digitizer Asus Vivo Tab - ditto I'm also looking into Lenovo ones - and it seems the Idea Tab Lynx and the Think Pad Helix could do the job too, but I'm not 100% sure yet. </s>
<s> More research needed! </s>
<s> Best Tim </s>
<s> Those models DO NOT MEET the criteria given above. </s>
<s> &quot; My requirements: PC element: Operating Windows 8 Tablet element: Android &quot; If you want help finding stuff, that's fine but not one of the units you mentioned met your first lines in your requirements. </s>
<s> OK, let's try again. </s>
<s> What did meet this list? </s>
