<s> When trying to transfer a downloaded video (YouTube) to a DVD to be viewed on a DVD player that is incorporated in a television, what format does the video have to be in? </s>
<s> The video is presently in AVI. </s>
<s> Thanks, Jim. </s>
<s> This is the PC hardware forum so please try to get the right forum when you post a question. </s>
<s> That being said, why not use DVD FLICK? </s>

<s> The format is, well, DVD format. </s>
<s> You need a program that can encode AVI to DVD, then burn the resulting files to a DVD disc. </s>
<s> A bit of searching will find you any number of these, but AVI2DVD is a good freeware program: http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Avi2Dvd Hope that helps! </s>
<s> Osprey4, Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> It will come in handy. </s>
<s> Right now for my current problem, I am using Windows DVD Maker. </s>
<s> It isn't doing the job though. </s>
<s> When attempting the burning, it will progress to 99.2 percent and then ejects the disc with error &quot;not able to complete&quot;. </s>
<s> Not a title I use. </s>
<s> I use DVD FLICK then IMGBURN for the recording step. </s>
<s> Microsoft is still working out the kinks. </s>
