<s> Hello, I'm looking design student looking for a printer, and we often print in sizes only a little bigger than standard letter paper (such as 11x17 tabloid). </s>
<s> I currently have a basic HP All-in-One printer, but I'm looking to upgrade to a larger one that prints 11x17. </s>
<s> So then I'm looking for a printer that can print formats as large as 11x17 (larger isn't necessary), and that still has a flatbed scanner/copier (fax not necessary). </s>
<s> Does this even exist? </s>
<s> looking for, but be aware that these babies don't come cheap. </s>

<s> I got an email from Brother USA this weekend about their July 4th sale (ends 7/9/11), and it includes 2 inkjet MFPs with 11&quot;x17&quot; scanning &amp; printing capability. </s>
<s> Here's a link to a page on their website showing the specials: http://www.brothermall.com/promotions/?PType=Rebate&amp;pGrp=5 Both the MFC-J6510DW and MFC-J6710DW would meet your requirements, and at a considerably cheaper price than the wide-format MFP that Brechan linked to. </s>
<s> If you're still looking for a wide-format MFP, both models sound like they'd be well worth considering. </s>
<s> That you posted to a thread that is over 1 year old? </s>
<s> He probably found something by now and moved on. </s>
<s> Yes, but this might be a topic others are interested in, too -- and those others might be interested in the sale I linked to. </s>
<s> The wide-format MFP linked to in Brechan's reply to OP cost over $1,500 on sale. </s>
<s> At those prices, OP may well have still been looking for a less-expensive alternative, such as what I linked to ($179-$229 on sale). </s>
<s> A $1,500+ printer would perhaps be within the budget of the university design department of OP, but NOT within the budget of a design student, as OP described himself/herself. </s>
