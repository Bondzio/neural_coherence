My computer can no longer read the hard drive. Whenever I boot up the computer it will crash if the hard drive is installed. When it is not installed it boots up fine. The hard drive came with an adapter that I think may be the cause of the problem. Is this a common problem that can be fixed by purchasing a new adapter? Below is all the information on the hard drive label: Type: DGHS COMP IEC-950 *ECE32284* *PN59H7013* SN 6810A623GK EMC P/N 072-000-123 11S59H7013ZM1FV110A623 9808 Please let me know if you can help me with this situation. I've searched the IBM web site but it appears they no longer have a support section for hard drives on their site. Thanks for any help you can give me.

You didn't write how old the drive is, but I know that at about 5 years these drives are at the end of their lifespan and to replace such if need be. I see 20G hard disks of similar model for the 30 buck range on ebay. Sounds like a cheap fix. Bob

Remember that most drives are &quot;5 year designs.&quot; The short and long of this is that they make terrible places to keep what we can't lose. Bob
