<s> Couldn't find anything regarding forwards compatibility of ram I assumed it would work, but at this point I'm thinking it doesn't and I'm going to have to buy some new ram. </s>
<s> It's my first real build although I've been switching out components for years. </s>
<s> I definitely did everything correctly on the inside but at POST it makes the same 3 beeps it makes with no ram with the 553. </s>
<s> Its an AMI BIOS and according to this http://www.bioscentral.com/beepcodes/amibeep.htm 3 beeps is supposed to be a ram problem. </s>
<s> What motherboard ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Name in Title http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130234 </s>
<s> This is a classic sign the ram is incompatible. </s>
<s> At least you tried. </s>
<s> And since you're buying new...DDR2 800 is what I'd install. </s>
<s> Let us know how it goes. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Finally got the new ram, popped it in and all was good, installed windows, etc. </s>
<s> Only game I tested so far is BF Bad Company 2, but it runs great on Max 2xAA 4xAF, no visible lag. </s>
<s> The components are: MSI G31TM-P21 EVGA GeForce GTX 260 216 Pentium Dual-Core E6700 3.2Ghz G.SKILL 4GB DDR2-800 Creative X-Fi XG Built this pc for my bro, tried to recycle some parts from my old pc that died, but ended up replacing everything but the case and sound card. </s>
<s> I was hoping the old ram would work, it was $80 for the new one. </s>
<s> I have a better one with an i7, 8gb ram, ATI 5770, and Xonar Essence ST myself. </s>
<s> I was too impatient when my old pc died I went for a pre-built from my local Best Buy. </s>
