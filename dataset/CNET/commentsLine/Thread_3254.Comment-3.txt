the results have been that regardless of computer use (at least so far) the indicated temperature of ich has not budged from 63c i believe that the sensor is not accurate as the temperature indicates 63c even when the computer is first started do you think that the thermal tape will work ok for this application if i add a heat sink?
i would rather be safe than sorry and got really worried when i saw the temp at 105c.
i then ran the computer with the side off and an external fan blowing on the mb until i added the 60mm fan.
the temp i gave you is with the case buttoned up and running normally now
