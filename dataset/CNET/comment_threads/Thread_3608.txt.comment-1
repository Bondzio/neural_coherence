I would like to be able to control ALL of the features of my multifunction printer wirelessly.
In particular, if a fax comes in, I would like the option of it &quot;printing to file.&quot; Also, if I have a fax to send, I would like to be able to &quot;print to fax&quot; and also &quot;dial fax&quot; from my laptop.
In short, I would like to be able to do everything but change paper and ink REMOTELY with FULL multifunction functionality...from my laptop.
Is anybody aware of a multifunction printer and/or software that offers this kind of total control?
Thanks a lot, Mikey
