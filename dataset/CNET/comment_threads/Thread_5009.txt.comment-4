hey, i'm not buying a tablet for gaming and stuff as i already have a gaminglaptop.
i'm just looking for a tablet with fast webbrowsing and short loading times for things like youtube, email, spotify... the tablet will be used at home because i don't feel like booting my pc up every time i want to check my email.
and with &quot;zero lag&quot; i do not mean zero lag, i mean the fewest lag possible (sorry for my english).
