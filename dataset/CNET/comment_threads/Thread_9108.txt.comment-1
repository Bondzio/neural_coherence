I have a very frustrating problem with this monitor.
Sometimes it works fine for days, then suddenly goes black, and stays that way for days then I switch it on randomly, and up it comes again.
When it goes black, and I switch it off and on again, it lights up perfectly for a fraction of a second before going black again.
I can repeat this as many times as I want then some day itll come right again.
I fix PCs for a living, so understand technology in general, but have never worked on screens anybody give me any pointers?
Any help on how to physically strip it down would be helpful too, as I tend to break little plastic catches and things Thanks a lot Roger
