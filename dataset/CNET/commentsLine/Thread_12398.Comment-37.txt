i have spent the better part of two weeks struggling to find a printer do the same that you are doing.
i have decided to outsource my very heavy paper projects/invitations.
most items can be printed on 80lb cover (216gsm) and many laser printers say they can take that.
the ricoh has been so heavily suggested that i am thinking of getting that.
but in this string of notes, someone said it was terrrible.
and that is really too bad!
you are right, they just don't understand our needs.
i have narrowed it down (for today) to the following... ricoh 410n (no need for duplex option since it can't do it with the heavier stock) konica minolta 5550 both can take 216gsm.
spoke to someone at printershowcase.com and he said that a woman who prints stationery on heavy stock came in and test drove those two and chose the konica over the ricoh.
so i am curious, what did you find out?
it's been 2 months and i hope you found something.
thanks cindy
