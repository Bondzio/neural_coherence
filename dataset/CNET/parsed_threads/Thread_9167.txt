<s> Does anyone know if Apple is ever going to add a Customizable Equalizer to the Ipod? </s>
<s> Thank you everyone, CHUSITO1975 </s>
<s> &quot;I can give you a definite perhaps or even a positive maybe that the Customizable Equalizer will be built into the iPod before the end of the millennium&quot; Or, Your guess is as good as anyone else's, given that Apple are very quiet about future plans P </s>
<s> I was hoping to get a response from you. </s>
<s> Right now I have been using the &quot;Jazz&quot; setting on the Equalizer. </s>
<s> It's the one that sounds the best when using the included Ipod headphones. </s>
<s> I have been shopping around for &quot;in ear&quot; bud headphones, but do not know which ones to get. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks again, CHUSITO1975 </s>
<s> actually, snap! </s>
<s> i also used to use the jazz - best mix of quality overall... About earphones - whats your budget?? </s>
<s> About the EQ, you CAN create custom EQ for - NOT on - the ipod... http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61567 hope helps/.. </s>
