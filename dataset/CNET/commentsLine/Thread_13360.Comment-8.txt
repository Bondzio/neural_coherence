sorry, what i mean is, can a failing psu cause incorrect post beeps?
failing as in, providing voltage outside normal ranges?
not necessarily totally dead.
if a psu can't properly power a motherboard, then i have no reason to believe the memory is bad.
unless someone with experience can offer more details.
the source, in my opinion, starts with a good power supply.
