ok, let's step back a little.
you mentioned a ''switch.''
normally a switch is placed between computers and a router.
the switch connects computers together to make a network.
a router connects your network to another network (the internet).
did you fail to mention the model name of your router?
typical setup: internet ---- broadband modem ---- router ---- switch(es) ---- computers for two computers, a switch usually is not necessary in that setup.
what is your setup?
what type of internet service do you use (cable, dsl, satellite, other)?
