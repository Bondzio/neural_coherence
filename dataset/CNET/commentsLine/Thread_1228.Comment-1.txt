maybe i'm a little to novice to ask this question, but i'm curios and would like to learn.
in my opinion, am, fm, shortwave, and ham radio waves would have more coverage, or a beter signal in case some trees or other obstacles are in the way, than wifi.
wouldn't it be possible to modulate and demodulate wireless network into an other radio wave?
in other words have a wireless network that transmits in am, fm, short wave, or ham waves?
another thought.
what would the results be, or is it possible to connect a gsm or gprs access point to a network, then catch it with gprs card on the computer.
wouldn't that give more coverage.
(more distance) wouldn't that be a way also to connect with a cell phone, and avoid the cell phone service providers high per/bit transfer rate?
what would be legal?
would anyone be dangerous?
etc....
