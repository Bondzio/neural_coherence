recommend searching thru and reading the posts here as your question and others like it have been asked and answered numerous times.
you'll also see what to avoid.
bottomline, you can buy pre-built, prepackaged external hdds with 1 year warranty or select separates of your choice.
the advantage to the latter is you choose the quality and characteristics of the components, both the enclosure and the hard drive.
the adaptec acs-100 is my choice as it handles hdds up to 1,000gbs, has a one year warranty and is usb 2.0. the hdd i chose is a 320gb hard drive, the wd3200sb, has a 5 year warranty.
i just installed the wd3200sb hdd in the adaptec acs-100 and it was as easy and uneventful as when i put a 160gb maxtor in another acs-100.
good luck on your search.
