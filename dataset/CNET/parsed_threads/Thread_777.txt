<s> all i see on my adapter lable is 220/240V 50/60hrz I also use An European Ext HD but on that AC lable said 120/240W 50/60Hrz all i used is an Adaptor and it works fine. </s>

<s> I dont wanna blow my mouse up when i plug in the US outlet because i paid around 75,- euroos for... and i want to use that blue-tooth when i have a blue-tooth phone to tranfer things... </s>
<s> Why no details about the adapter? </s>
<s> Such 110 to 240 or such adapters are common for many devices. </s>
<s> Most of the time it's just common sense to get the right setup. </s>
<s> But with such a lacking detail post plus the fact it works there isn't much to comment about except missing details. </s>
