Just moments ago went to Dell.com and bought a brand new dell Studio XPS 435MT built to my specifications with 12gig of ram etc etc.
Cost me $1900 by the time I got through adding goodies.
My Christmas present to myself.
Ships on December 15th.
this compaq is swiftly on it's way out the door.
won't trust anyone sending me a disc from now on!
Said disc just went through shredder.
Problem solved.
