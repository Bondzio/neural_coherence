1.1.1	I am in the process of planning my first build and I could use some help .	St
1.1.2	I am not a gamer , but I will be using my PC primarily video editing and encoding .	St
1.1.3	I do not need lots of serious mod components ( water cooled , neon fans , etc ) nor do I plan to overclock in the immediate future .	St
1.1.4	I could find lots of info on CPUs , motherboards , video cards , etc that has helped me make my choices there .	St
1.1.5	However , there are so many types of cases , from super cheap to super expensive , I 'm not sure where to start .	St
1.1.6	I do n't need any of the serious extras ( neon lights , acrylic cases , windows , etc .	St
1.1.7	) , but I do n't want a generic whitebox either .	St
1.1.8	As far as the PSU , how much power is really needed ?	Ques
1.1.9	Are the PSUs that come with cases often junk ?	Ques
1.1.10	Should I try to purchase these components separately ?	Ques
1.1.11	Here is a summary of my future build so far : - AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Winchester Integrated into Chip FSB Socket 939 Processor Model ADA3200BIBOX - Retail ~ $ 190 - MSI K8N NEO2 PLATINUM Socket 939 NVIDIA nForce3 Ultra ATX AMD Motherboard - Retail ~ $ 128 - ATI ALL-IN-WONDER 9600 100-714116 ALL-IN-WONDER Radeon 9600 128MB DDR AGP 4X/8X Video Card - Retail ~ $ 137 - CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB ( 2 x 512MB ) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 ( PC 3200 ) Unbuffered Dual Channel Kit System Memory Model VS1GBKIT400 - Retail ~ $ 80 - NEC 3520A DVD Burner ~ & lt ; $ 50 - Case ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.12	- PSU ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.13	Thanks for your help !	St
1.2.1	If video editing and encoding , you got to go with intel ! ! ! !	St
1.2.2	What is your budget .	St
1.2.3	Ill help u with a list of parts to look at .	St

St
1.2.5	My suggestion to downgrade the processor , ram , no monitor/speakers/wireless kybrd & Mouse .	St
1.2.6	Also get a regular 400Watt PSU FOR HALF the price .	Sug
1.3.1	Why exactly is Intel better at video editing/ encoding ?	Ques
1.3.2	something about pipelines being narrow and wide or something ... . ?	Ques
1.3.3	what is a pipeline ?	Ques
1.4.1	You 're thinking too much .	St
1.4.2	There is n't as much a difference between Pentium and AMD as some of these hardcore games would like you to think .	St
1.4.3	The speed gap for different tasks are actually very small anyway , and makes no real difference in the end .	St
1.4.4	If you find a good deal on AMD processors , do n't just ignore it because Pentium is supposed to be faster at video compression/decompression .	St
1.4.5	And another thing , do n't get an extra sound card .	St
1.4.6	Some of these Creative cards cost around $ 200 !	St
1.4.7	Comeon !	St
1.4.8	It makes absolutely no difference if you 're editing digital audio or video .	St
1.4.9	Actually , it makes no difference even if you 're just listening to it ...	St
1.5.1	http : //www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php ? ProdID=15139 #	Ques
1.6.1	inability to solve their power consumption problem in the P4 's .	St
1.6.2	They refuse to talk about it .	St
1.6.3	When AMD went from the 130 NM chips to the 90 NM chips the power went down from 80 some watts to about 67 watts .	St
1.6.4	The Intels dissipation did n't go down one Iota .	St
1.6.5	Notice that the Intel dual core using 2 P4 's ca n't run at the speed that the one P4 could , simply because it consumes too much power .	St
1.6.6	There 's a great article in Tomshardware giving details .	St
1.6.7	The Intel at idle consumes as much power as the dual AMD at peak .	St
1.6.8	The socket 939 will support the Dual for future upgrade .	St
1.6.9	The dual Intel will require a different chipset .	St
1.6.10	I wonder if the slight superior video editing performance warrants forgoing the gains one gets with the AMD 939 Winchester .	St
1.6.11	Not saying that you are wrong , simply food for thought .	St
1.6.12	Maybe dragon will straighten him out .	St
1.6.13	LOL	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	If your main interest is Video then get the AMD64 Venice core since it will handel the SS3 instruction set , same as the P4 processor .	St
1.8.2	On rendering test the P4 if faster by a few seconds and the credit is given to the SS3 instrucion set and now AMD has it .	St
1.8.3	John	St
1.9.1	These rendering tests are huge .	St
1.9.2	In the real world , the difference would be in the milliseconds instead of seconds .	St
1.9.3	So it does n't matter in the end .	St
