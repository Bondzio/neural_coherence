bob, this idea of firmware is real new to me.
and i notice on the page the link brought me to, there are many different versions of this firmware.
which version would i chose?
the latest, no?
and is installation simple?
this is my last ditch effort, so i think i will try it.
and if it doesn't work, i got my new choice on newegg.com to start fresh with.
(anyway, i am grateful i'm not losing 100s and 100s of dollars because of not keeping the box and receipt!!!)
thanks for your patience with me.
