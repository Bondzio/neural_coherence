<s> A friend on mine's motherboard just died. </s>
<s> She gave me the parts (2 disk drives, floppy, and 1 80gb WD HD). </s>
<s> I just built a computer (AMD Athlon x2 3600+, 1gb Wintec Ampo DDR2 800, PNY GeForce 7300GT 256mb, 140gb WD EIDE HD, VISTA Home Basic) and would like to format her old hard drive (which had lots of spyware, etc.) </s>
<s> and put XP on it. </s>
<s> So I simply want to format the 80gb hard drive (while not getting it's spyware on my PC) and install XP on it, while keeping Vista HB on my current HD. </s>
<s> How?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Place the drive into your existing machine after removing the current drive. </s>
<s> Boot with the XP CD and choose format and install. </s>
<s> But remember this. </s>
<s> XP will not have any drivers for your PC such as video, audio, etc. </s>
<s> Sounds like a project. </s>
<s> You have the full install CDs. </s>
<s> I've happened across many that thought they could move Windows XP (and now Vista) by moving the hard disk. </s>
<s> Not going to happen as easy as they thought. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So, I like the first option. </s>
<s> If and when I do that, will Boot Manager pick up on it when I start my computer up? </s>
<s> Drive C: is the boot disk. </s>
<s> If the new XP is on another drive it'll never be seen. </s>
<s> I guess I missed what you really want to do. </s>
<s> Install XP on another drive or the same as the Vista drive? </s>
<s> If the same as Vista, another partition is needed and from what I hear that can be a real challenge. </s>
<s> No, I want to keep Vista on my existing HD and install XP on the other one. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Microsoft's &quot;way&quot; is to install the old OS first then the newer. </s>
<s> To install XP after Vista is something we'll have to ask Google. </s>
<s> http://www.pro-networks.org/forum/about88231.html looks spot on. </s>
<s> But given I don't know what Vista and XP CDs you have I can't tell you if it should work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> And that looks waaaaaay too complicated and accident prone for me. </s>
