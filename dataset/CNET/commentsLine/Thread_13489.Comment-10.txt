i realize this is an old subject, but maybe it just will not go away.
i have the simpletech 160 usb hard drive.
i bought a new vista computer, and it never recognized the drive.
now, have win 7 and it will also not recognize the drive.
actually, win 7 sees it and puts it in the device manager under usb drives.
however, it lists it as an unknown device and it never appears as a drive on my computer.
i have called simpletech, and the name says it all, their advice was simple and not helpful.
the techs at cyberpower did not know what to do either (though they were very helpful in trying).
i have lots of saved files on this drive that i do not want to lose, so i am hoping someone has an answer here that does not involve reloading windows or getting a new motherboard.
thanks for any help, joey
