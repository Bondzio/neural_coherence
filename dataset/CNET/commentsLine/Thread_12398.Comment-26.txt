okay, i see we'll all be competitors here...i obviously am going thru the same issues.
i want to be able to print myself for 2 reasons: control and convenience!
i researched, like you and came up with the oki c6000n -- another forum said that envelopments was recommending it.
i also called mountaincow and they said they recommend both an inkjet and a laser and recommended an hp 4700 (?)
for their laser and epson claria (i think it's r380 or something).
i've had the oki for a month now but it can't handle above 80 lb cover/110 index so i need to get another...any strong reocmmendations???
anyone consider the xerox phaser 8560 with solid ink?
