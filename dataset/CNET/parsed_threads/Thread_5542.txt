<s> Hello, I recently built a new PC that I installed an LG BD-ROM/DVD Rewriter. </s>
<s> With the optical came a Super Multi Blue Install Disc for Windows Ver. </s>
<s> 1.1a. </s>
<s> I installed the software with no problems until now. </s>
<s> A few weeks ago I purchased a Sony BD-RE (25 GB) to be used to store a bunch of pictures, music, videos, and docs in-case of a harddrive failure. </s>
<s> Last night I went to copy all of these files to the BD-RE and burn, however, when I placed the disc in the optical, the drive does not even recognize there's a disc and it spits the disc back out. </s>
<s> I talked to a friend about this today who told me that a lot of the BD burners will have problems reading and writing to a BD-RE and it is necessary to install a third party software that will allow this to be accomplished. </s>
<s> Any truths to this or advice on how to deal with this? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If my guess is correct, you don't have a &quot;BD writer&quot;, just a BD player. </s>
<s> I am at work now, so I don't have the model number w/me, but the front of the drive says BD-ROM/DVD Rewriter. </s>
<s> Same exact problem for me using a Mac. </s>
<s> What type of discs SHOULD be used with this unit? </s>
<s> It turned out the member was recording the BD-RE on a DVR and trying to get them to work on the PC and other DVD/BR players. </s>
<s> They seemed to stop posting when they switched to DVD-RW or DVD+RW media. </s>
<s> The DVR offered a means to make DVD R/W media compatible with other machines. </s>
<s> As to an Apple, I fear that since Apple didn't send out units with BD capability you'll have to question the maker of that BD drive. </s>
<s> I can't comment further since many details are missing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, You are correct. </s>
<s> My uncle selected the components for the new PC and is upset he didn't look at the specs of the drive more carefully. </s>
<s> Sometime down the road I may put mine on ebay or something and upgrade to a writer. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> I think I'm seeing the end of this medium for storage. </s>
<s> Today's users seem to be very impatient and will not accept the 10 minutes or so to create a DVD or BD disc. </s>
<s> Not only that but the cost of USB sticks and drives plummeted to make this media unloved by so many. </s>
<s> I wonder how much longer we'll see this media. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> BD-ROM I should have known. </s>
<s> I been at this too long. </s>
<s> ROM Read Only Media. </s>
<s> Of course it won't write BD Media. </s>
<s> Won't even reconize the disk. </s>
