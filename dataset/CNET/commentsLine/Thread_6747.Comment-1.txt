hi guys, i am having problem with a dell laptop having winxp sp3,and when i plug in my ethernet cable into this laptop ,the local area network connection icon in my laptop stays busy geting tcp/ip configuration but doesnot get it and then it gets a messege of &quot;limited and no connectivity&quot;.but this same ethernet cable is working fine on my dell dekstop computer having winxp.
why am i having problem with this ethernet cable on my laptop?
could it be an issue of virus or spyware?
i have already scanned my laptop using avast and found no threat.
can you guys please help me.
