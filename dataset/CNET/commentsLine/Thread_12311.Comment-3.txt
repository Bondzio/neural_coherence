you could also try the asus ep-121 which is a windows 7 tablet.
i have one that i use both for home and work which provides more versatility and flexibility.
only disadvantages are its weight of 2.6lbs, battery life of 3.0 - 3.5 hours and of course the price of 1199.00 for the 64gb version which i recommend.
i comes with a leather cover, and bluetooth keyboard with pen for writing.
