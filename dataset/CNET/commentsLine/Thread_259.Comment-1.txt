when i bought this computer (see specs below) i used pc relocator and it completely copied my old computer's contents, files and software, to this computer.
it was perfect, to my way of seeing it.
i booted it up and went about my business as if it were the same machine.
i need to be able to do that now.
it's too long to explain why, but the folks at dell, hardware and dell on call software support tell me the only way to solve a problem i have is to format the hard drive and reinstall windows.
can i do this with a scsi drive ad pc relocator or a similar product???
what scsi drive do you recommend.
system specs: system manufacturer
