<s> Hello well I have done some extensive research and need to buy a dvd burner for some video projects that I do in a local racetrack. </s>
<s> Here is the criteria that it must meet for my needs. </s>
<s> Needs to be double layer for more space on cds, needs to be external either usb2.0 or firewire because my dell has no more internal bays. </s>
<s> Honestly I really do like the best thing out and dont mind paying a good price for good technology. </s>
<s> I really appreciate your alls help and any advice you can give me thanks. </s>
<s> Last year I bought an NEC internal DVD Writer, with bundled NERO software. </s>
<s> On opening my COMPAQ PC, I was daunted at the possibility of breaking the plastic shielding, in removing the CD Drive, which I intended to replace with the DVD Burner, giving me two DVD Drives. </s>
<s> I chickened out and purchased an external drive conversion kit, with cooling fan. </s>
<s> I am very pleased with the operation of this drive and the AHEAD software. </s>
<s> (NERO) In the U.K. the LG External DVD Drive is very highly rated and is excellent value for money. </s>
<s> USB connection is via Belkin. </s>
<s> Gordon WILEMAN(N.Ireland) </s>
<s> I have a Sony Dual layer drive in a external USB-2 case (externally powered which I recommend over USB powered). </s>
<s> Total cost less than a hundred bucks. </s>
<s> Data is data as far as the quality of the finished product is concerned. </s>
<s> if you really don't need PORTABILITY...why not put in the new CD-DVD-DL in place of one of the older internals CD-R/RW/DVDs ? </s>
