while there would be some improvement, it's not going to rock your world sorta thing.
you'll be better off using a desktop and having an int.
hd that accessing a 10,000rpm hd.
that would be better but again, that's a hard major investment.
under your circumstances, you might be better served having a nas setup, not only for work but immediate storage and minor back-up.
you may want to look into ssd setups as well, speed here is greater overall but that's only an idea i'll throw out there.
back-up should be an important consideration on top of any initial movie storage.
