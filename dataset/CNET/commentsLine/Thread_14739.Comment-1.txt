hey.
i have a problem with my computer.
after upgrading a few things, i'm having trouble with a newish ibm hard drive and a new samsung dvd+/-rw drive.
it seems that if i have both connected up to my motherboard, the hard drive gets misreported, causing, among other things, the computer to think it needs reformated to only have 3gb on it, whereas it is close to 30gb.
this problem even occurs in the bios.
if i remove the ddv drive, the hard drive reports correctly, and i can access all my files when i boot into winxp home sp2.
does anyone have any ideas?
here are the full specs: compaq presario (i'll never get another pre-build ever!)
intel pentium 4 - 2.66 ghz intel i845ge chipset 256mb ddr-sdram seagate 40gb u-dma hdd 5400rpm - main hard drive ibm-dtla-307030 30gb u-dma hdd - second drive (the one with the problem) generic dvd-rom 16x (not connected, but has same problem) samsung writemaster dvd+/-rw ts-h552 running windows xp home oem + sp2
