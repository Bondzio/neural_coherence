my town, and most of the surrounding towns have this dumb rule, where they give us these gigantic garbage cans, and we have to put all the trash in there, or else it wont be picked up.
so the pcs will probably be buried under someones banana.
suggestions always brings conflicts in my case hahah.
thanks for the suggestions anyway.
