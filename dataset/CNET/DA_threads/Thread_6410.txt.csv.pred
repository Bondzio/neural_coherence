1.1.1	I had thought that for some reason that when it hit that speed it was the type that was compatible with dual module configurations giving twice the effective bandwidth and that would make it ddr2.	St
1.1.2	Have I figured that out wrong?	St
1.1.3	My motherboard is only a 533 mhz bus cpu capable model but it says in the specs it can use pc 3200.	St
1.1.4	On one site it said that ddr2 uses 1.8 volts as opposed to 2.5 but my system is running it at 2.5.	St
1.1.5	Some concerns have arisen.	St
1.2.1	Go grap the free CPU-Z program from www.cpuid.com Run it and and take a look at the &quot;memory&quot; tab.	St
1.2.2	It will clearly show the memory specs and whether or not it is running in dual-channel mode.	St
1.3.1	the DDR2 sticks are over 200 pins.	St
1.3.2	Can't mix them up.	Sug
1.3.3	DDR2 uses 1.8 volts DDR uses 2.5 volts	St
1.4.1	are two different animals, both DDR and DDR2 can be used in a Dual Channel mode if the mobo and CPU support them.	St
1.4.2	DDR2 only provides greater bandwidth as determined by its speed.	St
1.4.3	Howevwer it has higher latency thus direct comparisons between each is not simple.	St
1.4.4	Dual channel is attained by have two completely separate memory busses, one for each of the memory sticks of the pair.	St
1.4.5	The two paths continue thru the MCH to the CPU and thus Dual Channel memory reads are 128 buts in length while single channel is 64 bits.	St
1.4.6	That's where the double memory bandwidth come from.	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	that even with a piece of paper and a pencil it is difficult to keep up.	St
1.6.2	Go here.	St
1.6.3	http://www.crucial.com/ There is lots of good info about mem.	St
1.6.4	If you know the make and model of your mobo use the mem finder...it will tell you what fits...ddr/ddr2/ddr?/dual channel/single channel.	St
1.7.1	a memory type or a characteristic of memory!!!	St
1.7.2	!	St
1.8.1	it's a function of the mobo but Crucial and the mem finder kind of explains this sort of thing.	St
1.8.2	Mem sizes.	St
1.8.3	Mem types.	St
1.8.4	Install single.	St
1.8.5	Install pairs.	St
1.8.6	If the mobo is capable of dual channel I suspect Crucial will recommend installing in pairs.	St
1.9.1	mobos is it will support Dual Channel HOWEVER only the FX CPUs have an MCH that supports Dual Channel and they require the use of registered memory.	St
1.9.2	The regular socket 754 CPU DOES NOT support Dual Channel but does allow use of standard [not registerd] memeory.	St
1.9.3	This can cause much confusion.	St
