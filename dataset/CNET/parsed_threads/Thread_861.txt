<s> I have a newer computer with built on sound card hence no more Gameport. </s>
<s> My MS joystick is 15pin gameport. </s>
<s> Will a USB/Gameport adapter work or would putting in an old PCI sound card just for the gameport work? </s>
<s> Would this extra sound card cause more problems than it would solve? </s>

<s> Decent joysticks are only $15-$30. </s>

<s> Your local RadioShack might have one of these but note that a customer says is won't work with MS Sidewinders: http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2036256&cp=&kw=gameport+usb&parentPage=search Cheap ($10) sound cards do provide joystick/midi ports, but they may cause conflicts with your on-board sound and may not even be as good as your built-in audio. </s>
<s> Better quality sound cards (worthy of replacing your on-board sound) have phased out game/midi ports in favor of digital audio ports and/or more surround sound connectors. </s>
