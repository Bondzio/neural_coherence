yes, i guess you are correct, i will need a computer to access my mass storage device via the internet... duh!
i don't want one running at the network site, that's all.
to be very specific: i want a device that will allow an off site computer to be able to access my network via the internet, so that it can then download files from my network connected mass storage device without the need of having any computers on that network turned on.
basically, i don't want to or need to run a server.
mirra, now owned by seagate, makes a stand alone network connectable mass storaqe device that allows internet access to it without requiring any other computers on the network, though there are some downsides to using it, in that it is a proprietary system which can only be accessed from their website, which i have a few issues with, and have discussed in previous threads in this forum.
i need to post photos, music and videos, and other files for my clients, but don't want to post them online.
i know i can operate a server for these needs, but don't want to sacrifice the space, expense and need to run an operating system on one, when there are devices like the mirra out there which don't require an os, are small enough to fit on a shelf, and don't draw the power and generate the heat of a server, plus don't require a keyboard and a monitor... does anyone know of any other devices which an operate much like the mirra, but aren't proprietary?
thanks again
