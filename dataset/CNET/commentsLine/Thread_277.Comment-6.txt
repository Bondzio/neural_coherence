&quot;why do dvds work fine?&quot; zombie drive.
you'll see a drive that as time passes begin to fail some disks.
it causes the owner to second guess if the drive is failing.
the nice thing about a shop is we ask them to bring a failing cd (more than 1) and a good one.
swap the drive, demo it working and ask if they want it fixes.
about one half want the old drive to be fixed.
i'm never sure how they want to do that.
