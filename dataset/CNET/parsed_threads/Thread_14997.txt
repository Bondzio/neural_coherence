<s> Thank you to anyone who reads this, I know reading about computer problems and trying to solve them for someone else can be frustrating. </s>
<s> Anyways, recently my computer has been freezing, blue screening, and randomly shutting off completely. </s>
<s> Whenever I go to turn it back on, I get &quot;BOOTMGR file is corrupt. </s>
<s> System cannot boot up.&quot; Or a screen with the words &quot;Detecting arrays...&quot; and that never goes anywhere. </s>
<s> If anyone has run across these problems, and know whether a certain part is going bad, or if I have a virus (which I doubt) I would be much appreciative. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> That DETECTING ARRAYS could mean that some custom RAID was used and now you are feeling the pains of trying to fix a machine not ready for self support. </s>
<s> Hope http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/fixing-bootmgr-is-missing-error-while-trying-to-boot-windows-vista/ helps. </s>

<s> To completely remove any errors reinstall Windows with only 1 drive connected unless you are using RAID then all drives have to be connected. </s>
<s> In all cases a clean install will erase your boot manager problems. </s>
