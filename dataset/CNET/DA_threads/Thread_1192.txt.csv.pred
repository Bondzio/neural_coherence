1.1.1	Several weeks ago I had to take my desktop in to get rid of malware .	St
1.1.2	The desktop was the host for the router and the modem .	St
1.1.3	While in the shop we continued to use the laptop with an internal wireless card .	St
1.1.4	Now that the host is back , the laptop get knocked off the internet .	St
1.1.5	The only way to get back on is to unplug the modem for two minutes and hook it back up and then you can get on .	St
1.1.6	But if it goes inot sleep mode , you have to go through the process all over again .	St
1.1.7	Also , it wo n't let me print from the laptop to the host connected printer .	St

1.3.3	The router is a Linksys which was installed last January .	St

1.4.2	However , I took the old drivers for the printer off and reloaded them from the website .	St
1.4.3	I then restarted the computer .	St
1.4.4	The printer will not allow me to share even though everthing is checked to share .	St
1.4.5	I did not take the firewalls down when I did this .	St
