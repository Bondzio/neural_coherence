All the other computers in the house don't have a problem with the internet. I had a different network card that couldn't pick up a signal from my room, so I purchased this USB adapter that has a cord so you can move it in different areas. It was working fine for about a month, with very little connection problems, but lately it's been dropping several times a day. I know I have great signal strength, so beyond that what can I do to keep me connected? Should I just purchase a different adapter? I've seen adapters that you can plug into the wall by your router that are highly rated.. does anyone have experience with these kind of adapters? If so, what brand are they? All your help is greatly appreciated!
