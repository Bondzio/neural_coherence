1.1.1	Hello, I am reasonably new to networking and would very much appreciate some assistance.	St
1.1.2	I am trying to network my desktop pc (windows xp) to an older laptop (windows 2000).	St
1.1.3	I just cannot work out how to do it, if you indeed can.	St
1.1.4	The desktop is connected to the internet through an adsl router.	St
1.1.5	Please help.	St
1.1.6	Thanks, Mark.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	By a network cable (blue one).	St
1.3.2	I have done simple windows xp-xp networks before with these cables so I am guessing this is what you use.	St
1.3.3	Thanks for reply.	St
1.4.1	Make sure the network name is the same.	St
1.5.1	That is, firewall settings, accounts, shares, etc.	St
1.5.2	Go get NETWORK MAGIC and you're done.	St
1.6.1	I tried running the setup on both machines (by making a network setup disk).	St
1.6.2	The laptop (windows 2000) said that the setup could only be run on windows 98, me and xp, not 2000.	St
1.6.3	Also what is Network Magic?	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	is it impossible to network a machine running xp to another running 2000, the network setup disk was the only way I could see and you can't run it on windows 2000. please help...	St
1.9.1	To network as you noted without the router it will tax the owner and they will likely fail.	St
1.9.2	If we install the router and then use NETWORK MAGIC then the usual owners can get it working.	St
1.9.3	What I'm running into more and more are owners that just want it to work without having to learn about firewalls, shares and accounts.	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
