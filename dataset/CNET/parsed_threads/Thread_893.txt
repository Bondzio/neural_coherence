<s> Alright, so I'm running on an old PC and I'm only able to buy an AGP card. </s>
<s> I'm not much of a hardware junkie, so I've got very little knowledge, hence why I'm here. </s>
<s> So basically, I played on my dad's computer and I ran Fallout 3 on some medium settings and low, and it ran fairly good. </s>
<s> He's hooked with all the same specifications as me, but he has an updated video card in which I'm saving up to buy. </s>
<s> The reason I've come here is to ask what you'd think would get a better performance. </s>
<s> I've found this card, &quot;HIS Radeon HD 4670 IceQ Video Card - 1GB GDDR3&quot; and the card my dad has is a &quot;Sapphire Radeon HD 3850 Video Card - 512MB GDDR3.&quot; Here's the link to the specifications on the HIS Radeon HD 4670 IceQ : http://www.compusa.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5071689&csid=ITD&body=MAIN#detailspecs and here's the link to the specifications on the Sapphire Radeon HD 3850 Video Card - 512MB GDDR3 : http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3855381&csid=ITD&body=MAIN#detailspecs I was wondering if you guys could help me decide which one would run better, preferably for Fallout 3, at Medium to low settings (I'm not going for a high settings or anything). </s>
<s> Also, you may be wondering so here are my full computer specifications, well the more important: Operating System: Windows XP Pro (Service Pack 2) RAM: 1GB (Upgrading to 2GB of ram) Video Card: RADEON X850 Series (256MB DDR2) Processor: Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHZ (single core, of course) If you want me to provide more information on my computer, I will gladly try my best to. </s>
<s> Thank you, David </s>
<s> It wasn't a bad card and was a great last upgrade to our last AGP machine. </s>
<s> Your cards are even better but these do require some upgraded power supplies so be sure your machine has in the 500 Watt or better power supply to avoid coming up short. </s>
<s> Nice choices and look to see if tomshardware gave any benchmarks. </s>

<s> What would you recommend, from the two, for PC gaming, preferably Fallout 3. </s>
<s> I wasn't able to find benchmarks for the 1GB GDDR3 version of the HIS Radeon HD 4670 IceQ, I always seem to find the 512MB GDDR3 version. </s>
<s> I find that a benchmark that isn't exactly for one card may be close enough. </s>
<s> Can't help but comment that after comparing some thousand cards over the years I've learned to take the 512MB numbers when there are no 1GB numbers. </s>
<s> It will be close enough to help the decision. </s>
<s> Since you didn't share the benchmarks all I can write is that either are fine choices. </s>
<s> Better than the card I used and I was happy with that one. </s>
<s> Remember these are all volunteer forums so supply details when you can. </s>
