<s> Crashing browsers explorer and chrome progressively getting worse.Due to live streaming video and webcamming too much ? </s>
<s> Adding memory from 3 to 6 gigs is no help at all . </s>
<s> Hard drive is getting full and probably the cause but what hell do I know . </s>

<s> Chrome is a very nice browser that will eat a lot of ram. </s>
<s> Newer users might try to open many tabs and not understand why it gets slower or worse. </s>
<s> I wonder if they will be the first ones to have 128 GB RAM machines? </s>

<s> Almost lost all my browsers then windows started acting up . </s>
