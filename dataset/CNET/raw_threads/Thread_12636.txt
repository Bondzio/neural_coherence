If you happen to have Windows Vista or 7: the disk management program it contains might be enough. Otherwise, the free GPARTED disk (burn yourself from an .iso file) would do the job. Kees

If you can't get it working, your two options are: 1. Try if GPARTED does it? 2. Copy all the files out of that 70%-partition (to an external hard disk or so), delete it, create a new 100% one and copy the files back. Kees
