apparently rd400d77 does it all the time by choosing the hard drive to boot with in the bios setup.
precisely what i was hoping for.
however, my bios (or something) thinks that d: is my cd-rw.
maybe i can get around that with a new bios???
you can probably get around it by changing the device name for your cd/rw to another letter besides d and then changing your secondary drive to d. (uninstall and re-install is one way, something like partition magic is another).
then you can boot from c or d using that technique.
my compaq ap-550 workstation has more flexibility in the bios/post including scsii and network booting.
nice box and very cheap if you don't need high end cpu.
