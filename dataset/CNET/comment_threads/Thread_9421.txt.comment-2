Wow is my first reaction.
My second is WOW again!
I don't think I have ever ran across that but having said that, my guess is a virus can be the cause.
You did not mention what type of files are taking up your disk space?
Also, are you able to remove them?
I would check the &quot;Services&quot; file under Administrative Tools very closely and determine any suspicious entries.
It took half a day to help fix a friends laptop that was saturated with trojans, spyware, uname it and I found several entries in the Services file.
These hackers set the recovery of their programs to 4977 times to restart!!
