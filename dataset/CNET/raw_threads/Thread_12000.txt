1373	0	377077	3215084	NR	paulbike	1/6/10 12:58 PM	1.26278268E12	3 monitors Need help with video cards	I will run 3 Samsung T220 screens (white and blue connectors available). The computer is Windows 7 Pro, with a 300W power supply; with 1 PCI Express x16, 1 Pci Espress x 1 and 2 PCI slots. There is an onboard Radeon, but I am told that it will be disabled once I add a card. The 3 monitor graphics cards are pricey and since I have the room I could use some advice on two video cards (for 3 monitors). I do not play any games or do any video editing or watch HD movies, but I do watch the screens all day when trading. Probably, pretty basic cards will work (especially with the 300W power supply). Any suggestions? Thanks so much. Paul

Let's go shopping. Let's use http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-310-5970,2491.html for the first PCIE card. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4675217 And the PCI card to match up. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3281686&CatId=319 Remember that NO ONE will tell you all will work fine. But these don't come with dire warnings of needing 900 Watt power supplies. Tip&gt; Keep in the same maker when having multiple cards. As an alternative use some USB to VGA to for the third monitor. Example at http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4961307&CatId=467 but ask about Windows 7 drivers. Bob
1373	2	377077	3215280	3215211	paulbike	1/6/10 4:28 PM	1.26279528E12	thanks for the advice	Radeon 4650 PCIe and 9000 PCI sounds like a good way to go. I tried the 4350 which gave me good results and is a touch cheaper, but the fan was a little loud. I have no real benchmark to evaluate these because I had been using two old Matrox cards in a 7 year old computer. The 4350 did provide much superior detail so I'm sure we're on the right track. Thanks. By the way, do you happen to know if either of these cards can be used to watch CNBC (or at least listen to it) while trading? Paul
