i have a pair of 21'' hp p1130 flat crt's i bought used at the end of 3 yr corporate lease.
they can do better than 1920x1080 needed for the top hdtv broadcasts.
you can't even buy a plasma, lcd, dlp that will do that now.
once you've seen true 1920x1080 hdtv you won't want to go back to the lower 720 res hdtv.
practically all your broadcast hdtv programming is 1920x1080.
yes, there is work on newer crt's with electron guns parallel to the screen allowing much shorter depth, but you're still going to have a big weight disadvantage because of the need to protect the vacuum stresses.
and what kind of complexity and weight will be needed to deflect electron beam almost 90 degrees?
