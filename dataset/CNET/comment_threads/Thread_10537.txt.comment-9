Velocity Micro is a nice company, but the customer support can be good or average depending on the problems you may experience.
Be warned, some of there systems are starting to show up in best buy.
Other good companies or at least ones with good ratings, include Pugent,and Vigor.
Pugent really deals with regular or advanced mods for systems.
They also have comments on different system configs.
Whatever you decide company wise, make sure you get acronis backup software.
