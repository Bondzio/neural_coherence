So basically I've recently brough a nice new gaming PC , the Acer predator g7200 it has 2.5Ghz , X2 ATI Radeon 4850's , 4GB ram, AMD Phenom 9850 Quad Core Processor. BUT I recently downloaded counter strike and call of duty 4 and I get around 5-10 FPS? What is wrong?. I have tryed.. Disabling one of the graphics cards didnt work Updating all the drivers and processor drivers , operating system - which is Windows Vista 64-bit I have confirmed it is not my internet because I receive the same lag offline on single player or a private lobby of a game such as cod 4. WHAT IS WRONG? I desperetly need an answer. This computer cost alot of money and I don't want it not to work within a week of buying it..

You should let the machine's maker know about this and ask them for one very important document. Ready? &quot;The Windows Install Plan.&quot; Given it's AMD based, it could be tricky. Bob
