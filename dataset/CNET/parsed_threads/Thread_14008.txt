<s> Hi guys, I need some help here. </s>
<s> I've been using my external hard drive and it has been working perfectly for the last 6 months. </s>
<s> However, yesterday, quite suddenly, it stopped working. </s>
<s> Plugged it into my Windows Vista computer and saw the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon pop up, but the drive doesn't show on My Computer... clicking on my J: shortcut link causes Windows Explorer to crash. </s>
<s> Tried it on Windows XP, same problem occurs. </s>
<s> Both problems are solved the minute I unplug the external hard drive without safely removing the hard drive. </s>
<s> I also note that before my external hard drive started to malfunction, I might have accidentally disconnected it without safely removing the hard drive. </s>
<s> I've read somewhere that this may be the cause of the problem. </s>
<s> Is there anyway I can fix my hard drive or at least reclaim my files inside? </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
<s> Look up these demos. </s>
<s> GETDATABACK Zero Assumption Recovery. </s>
<s> While CHKDSK may work, it did corrupt a disk thoroughly so I'm a little shy to write that's the right answer but many times it did correct the issue. </s>
<s> In closing, many externals come in FAT32 format which is easy to corrupt. </s>
<s> Convert to NTFS as soon as possible. </s>

<s> Hey Proffitt Thanks for replying How do I convert it to NTFS? </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314097/ If you can afford to loose the data on it, you can also format it again as NTFS using Disk Management: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309000 Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Awesome! </s>
<s> I've found out that my external hard drive is already using an NTFS system. </s>
<s> I managed to retrieve my files!!! </s>
<s> Now, would it be possible to reformat my external harddrive? </s>
<s> It's not showing up in My Computer or Disk Management (which actually crashes everytime I try to load, unless I unplug my external hard drive). </s>
<s> I'm afraid something is wrong with the drive, if Disk Management aborts with it. </s>
<s> Can you try it on another PC? </s>
