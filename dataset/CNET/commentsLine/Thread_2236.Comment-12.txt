i ended up returning the my gateway and going for an hp.
however, in general, you should follow the instructions that came with the video card.
i believe they suggest that you install their drivers first, then instal the card.
the one thing you will have to do is upon startup go into the boot settings and change the video from the built in to pci-e. i don't remember the exact settings, but you should be able to find it.
hope this helped!
