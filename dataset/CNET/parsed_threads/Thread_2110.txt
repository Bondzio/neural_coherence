<s> Greetings, I have recently decided to build myself a Desktop Computer to replace my current laptop since I no longer require mobility. </s>
<s> That said, it has been years since I built a computer from scratch and even then the machine was not built for any kind of real performance. </s>
<s> I have been spending some time searching across the web, evaluating needs vs. wants, setting my budget, picking out parts, etc., and now I fall upon the graces of my online peers for advice. </s>
<s> On to the nitty-gritty: Purpose: The machine will be used primarily for Graphic Arts. </s>
<s> I work in programs such as Photoshop, Daz3D, Poser, Maya, 3DSMax, Illustrator, etc. </s>
<s> The secondary use for the machine (and should probably be called primary) is gaming. </s>
<s> Currently I play World of Warcraft, Rift, and Starcraft 2. </s>
<s> I also do some work in Visual Studio. </s>
<s> Budget: I'd like to keep it around or under $2000. </s>
<s> Parts and Purchase: I am starting from scratch, with no preexisting parts and nothing currently purchased. </s>
<s> Where I buy from is of little consequence, though to avoid exorbitant shipping costs I would prefer to buy as much from one place as possible. </s>
<s> I am fine with online shopping. </s>
<s> Peripherals: Not needed. </s>
<s> OS: I have a copy of Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, but may be purchasing another Home version, not sure yet. </s>
<s> Cooling: I would like to keep the machine as cool as possible but am tepid about liquid cooling, any advise/opinions on this is welcome. </s>
<s> All of that said, as I mentioned before I have been looking for parts and have put together a list of what I think will take care of what I need. </s>
<s> But, whether they are the best part for my dollar is unknown to me. </s>
<s> I do not think I will have any compatibility issues, except perhaps with the SSD (I'm not sure on that one), but if you notice any glaring compatibility issues please note it. </s>
<s> What I'd like is for any and all of you to pick my list apart and let me know your thoughts or any problems you see. </s>
<s> I am open to switching out any of what I have chosen for a better and/or cheaper product as long as everything stays within my budget and functionality requirements. </s>
<s> After researching, these are the parts that I am looking into buying: Case: Cooler Master RC-932-KKN5-GP HAF 932 Advance Full Tower Case - ATX, Black, SuperSpeed USB 3.0 PSU: Ultra U12-40841 X4 Gold Edition Modular Power Supply - 1000W, ATX, 80 Plus Gold, 135mm Fan, SLI Ready, CrossFire Technology, Active PFC, Vibration Dampener Included, Lifetime Warranty w/ Registration Mobo: ASUS P8P67 Deluxe B3 Intel P67 Motherboard - ATX, Socket H2 (LGA 1155), Intel P67 Express, 2200MHz DDR3 (O.C. </s>
<s> ), Dual Gigabit LAN, 8-CH Audio, SATA 6.0 Gb/s, USB 3.0, SLI/CrossFireX, Bluetooth CPU: Intel Core i7-2600K BX80623I72600K Unlocked Processor - Quad Core, 8MB L3 Cache, 3.40 GHz, Socket H2 (LGA1155), Retail CPU Cooler: Corsair CWCH50-1 Hydro H50 CPU Liquid Cooler - 120mm Fan, Copper Cold Plate, Aluminum Radiator, LGA775, LGA1366, LGA1156, AM2/AM3 RAM: Corsair CML16GX3M4A1600C9 Vengeance LP Desktop Memory Kit - 16GB (4x 4GB), PC3-12800, DDR3-1600MHz, 9-9-9-24 CAS Latency, 240-pin DIMM, 1.5V, Unbuffered, Intel XMP Ready Video: EVGA 01G-P3-1561-AR GeForce GTX 560 Ti Free Performance Boost Video Card - 1GB, GDDR5, PCI-Express 2.0 (x16), Dual DVI, HDMI, DirectX 11, SLI Ready SSD: Corsair Performance 3 Series CSSD-P3256GB2-BRKT 2.5&quot; 256GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) </s>
<s> To add a few notes, I have been considering other parts as well. </s>
<s> Please have a look and tell me what you think in comparison: PSU: Ultra X4 1050-Watt Modular Power Supply - 135mm Fan, ATX, Lifetime Warranty w/ Registration, 80+ Silver, NVIDIA SLI &amp; ATI Crossfire Certifications, Vibration Dampener Included Mobo: GIGABYTE Z68X-UD7-B3 Intel Z68 Motherboard - ATX, Socket H2 (LGA1155), Intel Z68 Chipset, 2133MHz DDR3, SATA 6.0 Gb/s, RAID, 7.1-CH Audio, Dual Gigabit LAN, SuperSpeed USB 3.0, CrossFireX/SLI Ready Also, I've left out the Optical drive just because they are easily obtainable and typically are inconsequential to the build itself. </s>
<s> However, in case its needed for compatibility and/or PSU load assessments in my build, the one I am looking at is: Optical Drive: LG WH12LS30K 12x Blu-Ray Burner - BD-R, 12x, BD-R DL 12x, BD-RE 2x, BD-RE DL 2x, DVDR 16x, DVDR DL 8x, DVD+RW 8x, DVD-RW 6x, DVD-RAM 12x, CD-R 48x, CD-RW 24x, Internal, SATA, 4MB, LightScribe (OEM) Lastly, all of the product descriptions I have listed are directly off of TigerDirect for any search questions. </s>
<s> I'm not too concerned about storage on the SSD. </s>
<s> I only need about 100GB locally but wanted to make sure I had enough on there for overhead since I may store files locally for a brief time until transferred to a NAS device. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> Also consider researching about your OS, because you mentioned that you will also consider to buy a new home edition, it is much better if you install your 64bit, because if im not mistaken, 32bit OS will not maximize all your RAM. </s>
<s> Copy? </s>
<s> of win7, 64-bit isn't going to help you. </s>
<s> It may come back to bite you. </s>
<s> Get the OEM version(DIY type) and go from there and be done with licensing. </s>
<s> If you're going to be pushing the PC, then absolutely go add liquid cooling. </s>
<s> While typical air cooling may suffice once you go liquid and it's done right, its a real plus. </s>
<s> Unless, you find you really need 16gb of ram, you maybe better off with 8gb. </s>
<s> You can hopefully upgrade ram later to 16gb. </s>
<s> Even with your s/w demands, 8gb is still very capable, of course that can be addressed if the need arises, that's up to you. </s>
<s> Last, use the SSD as a OS install rather than a pgm. </s>
<s> tool area of work. </s>
<s> SSD have weakness in repeated use of R/W and persistent use of the same data locations can spell bad news later. </s>
<s> However, some pgms. </s>
<s> install will only default to drive &quot;C&quot;, if you can install elsewhere, do so. </s>
<s> I meantion that as thre SSD will get loaded pretty quick if no attention here. </s>
<s> This is a known problem(google on topic), but has been addressed. </s>
<s> High-end SSD drives that are hi-perf types and/or latest do well. </s>
<s> I still recommend a typical HD to do the real grunt work you plan to do. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> I probably should have been a bit more specific about the OS. </s>
<s> I have a legitimate (MSDN) copy of Windows 7 Pro 64-bit that I have not used, the reason why I lean toward using it is for networking purposes (setting up RDP and the like) that a Home version will not allow you to do. </s>
<s> As for mentioning &quot;another&quot; Home copy, I currently have Win7 Home Premium (64-bit) that came on my Alienware M15X laptop that I bought some time ago. </s>
<s> Apologies for any confusion on that strand, I merely mentioned the OS so you'd know what I planned to operate on. </s>
<s> As for my choice on the 16GB of RAM, that was just a price-point decision. </s>
<s> The pricing I am able to get on the 16GB was not much more than what I receive on like-RAM at 8GB. </s>
<s> As for storage, I did toy with the thought of a smaller SSD to support only core necessities and using my NAS device for storage, I was thinking on the larger for those &quot;uh oh&quot; scenarios. </s>
<s> To add to the OS side of things, the Alienware one isn't necessasy going to work &quot;if&quot; you plan to use on the new system. </s>
<s> While the other OS supplied is OK, I hope it works well for ya. </s>
<s> keep any papaerwork in case you have issues later. </s>
<s> I also, like to comment on the memory, if that's good, then that's good. </s>
<s> I hope it works well for ya. </s>
<s> Now for the SSD, as I explained some SSDs won't last long if they get used extensively regrdless of how. </s>
<s> The nature of SSD is that repeated usage of the same area will cause a failure or a fault, thought hey are more robust than flash drives, the problem is often seen on these as well. </s>
<s> The whole reason for explaining this is that when they go bad, they just go, no clue they're gone. </s>
<s> Please google on the topic of SSDs and find this out. </s>
<s> Nwer SSD released maybe better at handling these issues since the newer Sandbridge(force?) </s>
<s> releases. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Hi It looks good, but you might want to consider the X68 Motherboard. </s>
<s> It would be a good fit for that i7 2660k Sandy Bridge. </s>
<s> I didn't see anything about memory, but with graphics type stuff such as video editing and such, I would go for the max ( 1600 Mhz ). </s>
<s> May be a bit of overkill as I think an 850w Corsair would be fine for that build with ample headroom. </s>
<s> I am running the same Video card in here and it is a good one to be sure. </s>
<s> As for the Corsaid Hydro H50, if you must go that route, I would consider at least the H70 although there are some very good non liquid cooling solutions out there. </s>
<s> Yes, on the SSD, make sure that you get an SSD that supports the TRIM command. </s>
<s> You absolutely need wear-leveling firmware to play with an OS like Windows 7 that will issue TRIM commands when needed, like when large blocks of memory are deleted. </s>
<s> I have an Intel 160GB SSD, which I find perfectly adequate for a C: drive, I have another regular drive that provides a lot more storage for data, but is slower. </s>
<s> However, all my programs run off the SSD, which gives me a very fast boot. </s>
<s> I've also turned off the paging and hibernation files, since they take a fairly large piece of SSD, and are not needed if you don't hibernate and have a lot of physical memory (so you'll never swap). </s>
<s> I'm very happy with my SSD, the computer boots and shuts down quickly, and programs come up quickly. </s>
<s> And given that I'm always running out of physical memory, programs/games/apps run as fast as the cpu and memory speeds will allow. </s>
<s> Which is pretty fast these days. </s>
<s> Also, pay attention to your backup speed, make sure that you have Firewire, USB3, Thunderbolt, or some fast connection for backup devices, spending a lot of time backing up is not fun. </s>
<s> One last thought, spend some time researching graphics/video cards. </s>
<s> There's lots of benchmark results on the internet. </s>
<s> Given what you want to do, you'll need a good, strong graphics card, so try and get what you'll need first time out. </s>
<s> It's very disappointing to find that you have a great system, but your graphics card just isn't up to what you need it to do, and have to go out and do that one over. </s>
<s> Only you know what you need your graphics card to be able to do, and what you can get for the money you have for it. </s>
<s> On the other hand, getting a graphics card that's bottled-necked by your memory and CPU speeds is just wasting money. </s>
<s> So do some research, the facts that you need are out there. </s>
<s> Ths is just to clarify my post. </s>
<s> On the Memory, what I meant was the max memory running at 1600 Mhz. </s>
<s> As for the Bottle necking aspect, with 1600 Mhz memory and the i7 2600k CPU, that won't be an issue. </s>
<s> That card you have chosen, nor others will be bottle necked. </s>
<s> As I previously said, An X68 based board would be a good choice these days. </s>
<s> Why buy from this e-tailer when there are others out there with more competitive prices (e.g. </s>
<s> newegg.com); from the list of components you have provided (although some are not available through newegg), there are far better choices/ prices provided by newegg http://www.newegg.com/Index.aspx?name=Home Second; do not scrimp on the PSU, although Ultra may be tigerdirects best (in-house) brand, for the same money you should be spending it on a more reputable company (e.g. </s>
<s> Antec, Corsair, Silverstone, and the like). </s>
<s> Third; while others may argue that &quot;all-in-one&quot; liquid cooling solutions (such as the Corsair H50/ H70/ H80) are the next best thing to custom water cooling, they are not. </s>
<s> These solutions are no better than a &quot;lesser&quot; priced air cooler. </s>
<s> Forth; while buying a computer case is strictly a personal choice only you can make, make sure the case you get fulfills all your needs...there's nothing worse than getting into the nitty-gritty of the build, only to find that the case you've chosen is more of a nightmare come true, rather than the dream you were wishing for. </s>
<s> Fifth; I have to agree with Willy on the point of having an SSD, the point of having an SSD in your system is to make the O/S and other &quot;key&quot; programs run faster, rather than the &quot;old-school&quot; way of thinking, where the main HDD was for every program under the sun...then using other (internal or external) drives for storage and backup. </s>
<s> Best to have a smaller SSD for the O/S and a few programs that are used often; then get another &quot;fast&quot; drive for everything else. </s>
<s> I have to update my previous two posts as I mean't the Z68 Chipset rather than X68 ( there isn't one of those , just X58 ). </s>
<s> Anyway, TigerDirect is Fine. </s>
<s> I use both TigerDirect & NewEgg. </s>
