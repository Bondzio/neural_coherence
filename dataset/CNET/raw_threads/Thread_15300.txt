I have recently purchased a Series 7 chronos, it came with a 1TB hybrid drive, i have recently installed an intel SSD, however, the SSD (8GB) from the hybrid drive still shows up on my system (even after a fresh windows 8 install) i would like to know if anyone has ever came across somthing like this. i am wondering if it is pulling this from my SSD, but i have a 180GB 520 series (disk manager says its actually 167 GB) is there a way to see what &quot;port&quot; this thinks its plugged into? keep in mind, i can format this, move files to it because i can do all this im wondering if its actual memory that i just cant see. i have 8GB of ram, but i do not have a RAMdisk set up, so im ruleing that out immediately. Anyone have any ideas?! Thanks!

I do not have that model but many Samsungs have a wake from zero power sleep feature and they use such memory to accomplish this feat. Since you are dealing with a fresh install of the OS you may see this as a drive and not hidden as normal. From what I read this memory is on the mainboard and can't be unplugged. You might be able to disable it in the BIOS but that's a question for Samsung support. Bob
