The drive is probably 2/3 full of movies and music. I had it attached to a PCI IDE Raid Card in my home computer (Vista) (no on board IDE). The computer stopped fully booting until I removed the drive. I have since put the drive in an external USB case, put it in 2 other systems (Win2000) and still cannot get the drive to be recognized externally or able to boot internally. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

There a sectors that are &quot;data is uncorrectable&quot; and &quot;sector ID cannot be read or not as expected&quot; So I know the drive is bad, now I just need to be able to get whatever files I can off the drive...
