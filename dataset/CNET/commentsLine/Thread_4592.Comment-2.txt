a properly configured machine doing that.
it's usually a pebkac error.
users will try to do something they either shouldn't or can't, or hose up their machines with a gazillion running programs in the background, or they expect too much out of a pc that just barely meets requirements, or are filled with adware, spyware, trojans, etc.
as i said, a properly configured and clean machine will perform as advertised.
pebkac - problem exists between keyboard and chair.
