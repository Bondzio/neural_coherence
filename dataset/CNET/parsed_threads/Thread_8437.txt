<s> Ok, so here's my problem: I switched from PC to Mac in January and my Logitech Sphere webcam isn't compatible with my Mac. </s>
<s> Which webcam can you suggest ? </s>
<s> I like the iSight from Apple, i've found a few in good condition on Amazon... </s>
<s> I ask because Macs have had built-in cameras for a number of years now. </s>
<s> That said, if you have an older Mac, the iSight is pretty decent. </s>
<s> I believe Logitech makes a Mac compatible camera. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Mac Mini ! </s>
<s> haha Sorry =P Just the iSight stays in the Mac design and style... </s>
<s> Yeah about the logitec cams, they're good quality and everything, but I like to stay Apple if possible (personal preference) </s>

<s> http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/ macam is a driver for USB webcams on Mac OS X. </s>
<s> It allows hundreds of USB webcams to be used by many Mac OS X video-aware applications. </s>
<s> The aim is to support as many webcams as possible. </s>
<s> here is the link to a list of web cams supported including many, many logitech cams http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/cameras/index.php </s>
<s> Hey ! </s>
<s> Thanks for the website however i do already know about Macam... My webcam (logitech SPhere old model -i believe 2006-) doesn;t work with such app. </s>
<s> not supported yet. </s>
<s> If they update the software with the driver for my webcam before i have the money to buy an iSight, I'll probably keep my Sphere. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> The MS xbox360 camera and a cheap usb mic work pretty well on macs. </s>
<s> And the price is about 1/3 of the isight cameras on ebay/craigslist. </s>
<s> I bought an isight a few years ago, just before they stopped making them. </s>
<s> Last year, I bought the Logitech QuickCam Vision Pro for Mac, and it is superior in my opinion. </s>
<s> At the time, I got it for $80, about half of what the isight cost. </s>
<s> You can try to find and use AGENT V4. </s>
<s> It looks like an iSight camera and works for me. </s>
<s> Excellent. </s>
<s> Try to google the above. </s>
<s> I bought it on the net from an English company. </s>
<s> try LIQUID DIGITAL SOLUTIONS in Australia. </s>
<s> it is about fifty bucks, USB powered (no AC brick) and delivers acceptable picture. </s>
<s> It is ideal for laptops but should be fine with a desktop too. </s>
