whether your 2.4ghz p4 cpu has a prescott or northwood core, 50*c (122*f) is not too high a temperature for that cpu under load.
i do suspect your temperature readings are not accurate because if your resting cpu temp is 48*c, you should see a larger jump in temp than 2*c. you should be able to get that cpu idle temp into the 30's (c) range with a good heatsink and fan (hsf) and thermal compound.
what does speedfan (free from download.com) say about your system, cpu and gfx card temps?
before you go to the expense and effort of changing out the cpu heatsink and fan (hsf), try adding the largest fan to the rear exhaust of your box that will fit (120mm if possible).
also, tell us the psu wattage and mfg.
if possible.
another thing to try is to give your computer a good cleaning with regard to viruses and spyware.
turn off all unnecessary background programs when gaming.
ultimately you might be running those games with too much detail for that gfx card.
assuming you have an agp 8x slot, i'd consider an upgrade to an nvidia 6800 family video card if speedfan tells you your current hardware temps are ok.
