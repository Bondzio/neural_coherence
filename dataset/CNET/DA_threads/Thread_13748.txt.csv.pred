1.1.1	ok i need an expert opinion..	St
1.1.2	I'm building a new comp strictly for gaming and i cant decide on a CRT or an LCD.. ive read good things about some LCD's such as the Samsung 226BW but i just am not sure if this is what i want to get.	St
1.1.3	I've always played with my resolutions in the past at 1024x768 and I'm worried that an LCD with a big resolution is going to be way to different for me.	St
1.1.4	If someone could advise me on whether to purchase an LCD or a CRT it would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.1.5	By the way i will be running this monitor on an 8800GT, thanks.	St
1.2.1	if you have the money, you should go with an LCD for sure.	St
1.2.2	But if you are a bit tight on budget, i suggest saving up and buying an LCD later, instead of buying a CRT right now.	St
1.3.1	I saved a ton of money by switching to LCDs.	Polite
1.3.2	Seriously.	St
1.3.3	If you look at your average 19inch CRT wattage and your LCD even at 20+ inches you find it's less than 1/2 the power.	St
1.3.4	At the office this is enough to pay the difference off in less than a year.	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	ok well would it be ok for me if i will plan to play games such as CoD4, Crysis, etc.	St
1.4.2	I just dont want the resolution to be so big that i lose performance based on the resolution size.	St
1.4.3	Like i said ive always used 1024x768 and the 226BW's native resolution is like 1600 by something..	St
1.5.1	At home I gifted the old 17's and 19's out, LCDs are in and it shaved a 20 off the monthly bill.	St
1.5.2	Payback is still at one year for the diff.	St
1.5.3	Here the games never ghost or such so I guess we're good.	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	You can set the resolution to what you like.	St
1.6.2	But native is usually the best.	St
1.6.3	What I did.	St
1.6.4	I have a 19&quot; wide screen.	St
1.6.5	I found a 22&quot; wide screen.	St
1.6.6	When I got it home I found out that my Intel graphics card supported about a gazillion resolutions.	St
1.6.7	But not the one specific to the new 22&quot;.	St
1.6.8	Specifically, it supported resolutions above and below the new LCD, but not the exact one.	St
1.6.9	Bummer.	St
1.6.10	I took it back.	St
1.7.1	I too found out that the majority of Intel and ATI adapters don't support non-standard modes.	St
1.7.2	Intel has some technical googly **** on their site about issues with hardware/firmware/software compatibility and offers a non-standard driver which won't install on most laptops, including Centrino platforms!	St
1.7.3	Why can't Intel and ATI make video products with simple user customizable driver modes like Nvidia's?	St
1.7.4	I didn't return my 1680x1050 22&quot;.	St
1.7.5	I just dumped Intel and ATI and switched to Nvidia.	St
1.8.1	I can't count how many times I've fixed this by installing a monitor.inf file.	St
1.8.2	I also know that most are only owners and won't know about this.	St
1.8.3	Said file does not come from ATI or Intel but the display maker.	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	I knew that but didn't think about it.	St
1.9.2	Rats.	St
1.9.3	Monitor not on sale any more.	St
1.9.4	Maybe Santa will be good to me.	St
1.10.1	Not for the reason that monitor infs help, but because my dock doesn't support non-standard rez.	St
1.10.2	Monitor infs can't fix what's not in the adapter infs; they only serve to hide the modes that a monitor cannot display and therefore eliminate issue of overdriving.	St
