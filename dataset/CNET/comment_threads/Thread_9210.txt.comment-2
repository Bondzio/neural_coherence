Did you right click the folders and click on the sharing tab then enable them to be shared?
Did you right click MY computer and click properties, click computer name tab, click change and click on Workgroup button and the workgroup NAME has same name on each pc?
Also make sure both pcs have different names for the PC name....Workgroup same, PC different.
Are you running any other firewalls like ZoneAlarm?
If so, do away with windows firewall and manually enter the ips into the trusted zone on both pcs.
