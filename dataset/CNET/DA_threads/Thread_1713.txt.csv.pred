1.1.1	I have two Dells with Windows XP OS .	St
1.1.2	One is connected via cable modem , the other is wireless .	St
1.1.3	I will call the first one ( cable modem ) my primary , the other one my secondary .	St
1.1.4	The primary has a 40G hard drive , the secondary has about 150G on two internal drives , one 40G ( the original ) and one 100G ( added later ) .	St
1.1.5	The drive is also partitioned .	St
1.1.6	I use the 100G for backup , but my daughter stores free music files and it loads very slowly .	St
1.1.7	I have done all scans and cleanup utilities and it still runs like a snail .	St
1.1.8	I was thinking of buying a Seagate Free Agent to store my photos and videos that are on the primary , which take up most of the room on my 37.2G hard drive , and also the music from the secondary , which I think slows down the performance .	St
1.1.9	Q1 : can I use this external to store stuff from both computers , in other words , move it back and forth ?	Ques
1.1.10	If so , how do I name or partition the drive so I know the difference between C drive on my primary and C drive on my secondary ?	Ques
1.1.11	Q2 : I am a bit confused about backup drive vs. external hard drive .	St
1.1.12	Can I use this for backup , or do I need a separate drive for that ?	Ques
1.1.13	And if so , does that mean that if I store and then delete pics from my primary computer , they will then disappear from the backup/external drive ?	Ques
1.1.14	It was my understanding that backup drives just keep basically refreshing info from your computers current files , so if you delete a file on your primary , it wo n't show up on the backup .	St
1.1.15	Is backup drive a different format from external , or are they interchangeable ?	Ques
1.2.1	A few remarks and answers 1 .	St
1.2.2	The external drive gets another drive-letter .	St
1.2.3	Just make 2 folders on it with different names , say & quot ; PC1 & quot ; and & quot ; PC2 & quot ; .	St
1.2.4	Substitute suitable names for your 2 PC 's !	St
1.2.5	Then backup data from PC1 to the PC1-folder and from PC2 to the PC2-folder .	St
1.2.6	It ca n't really go wrong if you set it up carefully .	St
1.2.7	In stead if 2 folders , you could make 2 partitions ( that would each get a different drive letter ) with a different name ( volume label ) , but it would n't make it much clearer than having 2 folders in one partition .	St
1.2.8	2 .	St
1.2.9	STORING data on an external hard disk is a VERY BAD idea .	St
1.2.10	External disk have shown to be unreliable , and if your ONLY copy of some data is on that disk , it 's practically inevitable you 'll lose it .	St
1.2.11	External drives are nice for storing ANOTHER copy , but certainly not the ONLY copy .	St
1.2.12	Do n't say you have n't been warned .	St
1.2.13	3 .	St
1.2.14	Deleting files from that 100GB partition wo n't have any influence at all on the speed of your secondary machine .	St
1.2.15	There must be other causes for it being slow .	St
1.2.16	But that 's a totally different story .	St
1.2.17	4 .	St
1.2.18	What happens with the copy of the file on an external dis , if you delete the original on the PC , totally depends on the settings of your backup/synchronization program .	St
1.2.19	I would n't advise to use a program set to sync the deletes for backup purposes .	St
1.2.20	But that 's totally your choice , of course .	St
1.2.21	5 .	St
1.2.22	Backup drive is just your own term .	St
1.2.23	It 's not standardized in any way .	St
1.2.24	If you want to call your external disk a backup drive , you 're free to do so .	St
1.2.25	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.26	Kees	St
1.3.1	& quot ; free music files & quot ; seems like P2P ( limewire and such ) .	St
1.3.2	Using programs like that is a well-known risk .	St
1.3.3	It 's likely that you should have said : & quot ; My daughter stores free music files on the 100 GB disk and while doing so has allowed malware/viruses/trojans on the 40 GB disk. & quot ; But , to be fair , that 's not sure .	St
1.3.4	There can be many other reasons for a PC to be slow , especially if it 's an older one like this ( slow CPU , not enough RAM , too many programs active , installed and running a lot of junk ) ; but malware is common reason also .	St
1.3.5	Kees	St
1.4.1	Just a thought concerning your reply .	St
1.4.2	I have 3 PCs backed up on 2 external hard drives .	St
1.4.3	What else can I use to back up 500GB of data , music , photo and video files in addition to full system backups ( system restore ) ?	Ques
1.4.4	Even compressed , CDs and flash drives are not an option and online storage is cost prohibative .	St
1.5.1	As already stated , ext .	St
1.5.2	HDs can have issues and outright fail .	St
1.5.3	But , they do provide that extra storage .	St
1.5.4	What can be done is a simple fix , buy another set of ext .	St
1.5.5	HDs and use them as yet another back-up .	St
1.5.6	Any & quot ; super-critical & quot ; data can be stored on DVD/CD/HD discs , again as yet another area to store .	St
1.5.7	You can RAID the system to make this possible , but that gets into real PC usage .	St
1.5.8	The safe bet is to store on yet other ext .	St
1.5.9	HDs as the quick and be done with it sorta thing .	St
1.5.10	You think this is n't cost effective , then think what you would need to do , if data is lost .	St
1.5.11	Effectively , real back-up consists of 4 sets .	St
1.5.12	1 ) actual immediate storage ( int .	St
1.5.13	HD ) 2 ) ext .	St
1.5.14	storage ( daily/weekly/monthly ) CD/DVD/HD 3 ) ext .	St
1.5.15	storage 2nd set ( stored ) 4 ) any type of storage kept in safe place You deem what needs to be stored and/or backed-up .	St

1.6.1	@ Kees , Thanks for the good advice .	St
1.6.2	Yes , I know that p2p software is very bad .	St
1.6.3	I run a scan on both computers every night with AVG Free , plus I run Microsoft Security Essentials or Windows Defender every so often , plus CCleaner , as well as defrag every now and then .	St
1.6.4	I have detected and removed several adware , spyware , trojans , viruses , etc .	St
1.6.5	but you can tell when you have one of those .	St
1.6.6	They do weird things .	St
1.6.7	I do n't think the computer is running & quot ; weird & quot ; , just slow .	St
1.6.8	I had another 512 RAM memory put in so I do have 1 G. I think it may be the sheer volume of stuff she has stored on there .	St
1.6.9	Thousands of songs .	St
1.6.10	I ca n't wait till she gets her own PC so I can get rid of it all .	St
1.6.11	@ Willy , What 's the difference between numbers 2/3 and 4 on that list ?	Ques
1.6.12	How do you all feel about online backup ?	Ques
1.6.13	I personally do n't trust any agency since 911 .	St
1.6.14	The government is spying on us all ( or will be soon ) and even though I do n't engage in terrorist activity , I do n't want them looking into my personal files without my consent , which they will soon have the ability to do .	St
1.6.15	Anyone could do it , and as long as they were n't using it you would never know .	St
1.6.16	If not external HD , then is there an alternative to CD/DVD-ROMs ?	Ques
1.6.17	-april	St
1.7.1	# 2 , you follow the back-up per day/week/month as you see fi t , it becomes the immediate work back-up .	St
1.7.2	# 3 is copy of # 2 , you back-up again as you see fit , it maybe an exact back-up of # 2 or lag a bit but its there as yet another copy of your data .	St
1.7.3	# 4 is the last defense , your back-up is stored away and comes out when you deem that some back-up is required .	St
1.7.4	Its there as the final deposit of your super critical data , again what you deem necessary .	St
1.7.5	You 're playing it safe , for sure if you read all the horror stories , once your system is back from the brink and ready , return data or access it .	St
1.7.6	Of course , what 's back-up on a certain date is yours to decide , there than trying to recover such data from the ruined HD .	St
1.7.7	If you RAID , the data is mirrored and at least the mirrored copy is available , but that 's only 1-copy of data .	St
1.7.8	You still need to place a back-up somewhere to be safe , outside of system .	St
1.7.9	As for CD/DVD/HD , the use of flash drives or any other storage whether it be off-site like online is entirely up to you .	St
1.7.10	Do you trust or consider that online deposit , good and retrievable and of course the cost as to amount of storage .	St
1.7.11	As a business this can be a write-off .	St
1.7.12	For personal use , its again worth it for you .	St
1.7.13	Which is why , I state , & quot ; super critical data & quot ; , just about what is that in mb/gb amount ?	Ques
