It was rumored that the Intel iBook would be released at the MacWorld Expo (Jan 9th - 13th), but that rumor was not true.
Most rumors are currently pointing to a release in this quarter.
As for information reguarding screen size and price, that could change with the change to Intel chips.
There are rumors that the $999 iBook with a 12.1&quot; screen could be dropped in favour of a wide screen model.
But ofcourse that is speculation as well.
Apple usually keeps secret it's up comming product releases, so the exact information won't be known until Apple is ready to ship them.
As for what to get and why, talk to an Apple Rep.
I'm also waiting on an Intel iBook.
