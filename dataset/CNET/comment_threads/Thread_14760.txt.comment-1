being received from a Canon MP830 ...
I've always had HP printers until last week, and those HP printers had a setting to block junk faxes ... if there was a number shown on the incoming fax.
I cannot find any info re doing this with the Canon ... either in the User's Guide or in their online Help.
Does anyone with a Canon know if this is possible?
Thanks.
