1.2.1	Something I forgot .	St
1.2.2	I had to recently replace the CPU Fan , I also bought the Maxtor Hard drive as the WD80 was showing a permanet blue screen and installed XP home as my XP Pro wouldnt install , the machine then repaired the fault and I disconnected the new Maxtor 6Y120 .	St
1.2.3	It doesnt make a difference whether both hard drives are connected or the main WD80 .	St
1.3.1	can you enter the CMOS ( bios ) setup ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	?	Ques
1.4.1	Check if your keyboard 's LED 's light-up during start-up , if it does light up , does the caps lock LED or Num Lock LED activates once the keys are pressed or are they steady ( sometimes the 3 LED 's are lit ) .	St
1.4.2	If that is the case , there might be a problem in the motherboard .	St
1.4.3	Check the capacitors near the power supply ( there are 3 or 5 big capacitors in there as compared to other capacitors some read 2200 uf or 1500 uf 3.3 volts ) , is it bulging on top ( showing a burnt-up capacitor ) ?	Ques
1.4.4	The capacitors in there control or maintain the power supplied to various parts .	St
1.4.5	Once they are busted , there will be low power output supply to various parts .	St
1.4.6	The DVR or CD ROM LED 's may light-up but will not operate since LED 's require a small amount of current to light-up .	St
1.4.7	Burnt-up capacitors sometimes show after you had put your electronic equipment off , since they had exhausted its reserved charge when they were idle and no power is supplied to it .	St
1.5.1	Had a similiar occurance recently on my daughter 's machine .	St
1.5.2	My wife was powering off , and a program was hanging the shutdown ( Win 98 ) , then the screen went black .	St
1.5.3	Next day I found the vid card was blown .	St
1.5.4	Popped in another , no bootup .	St
1.5.5	Pulled all hardware except ram and cpu ; no beep , no BIOS .	St
1.5.6	Sent it to shop , and it turns out my motherboard just died .	St
1.5.7	Ca n't say whether the amd 1.4 chip is dead or not , as there were no other boards to test in .	St
1.5.8	Just installed another motherboard and Intel chip .	St
1.5.9	All other hardware survived , best that I can determine .	St
1.5.10	But do try to get into your BIOS ; this will at least give you a hint as to what *may* have failed .	Sug
1.5.11	Good luck .	Polite
