<s> I really think &quot;computer illiterate&quot; goes best with talking to live people at a store you like. </s>
<s> Try a Best Buy - their employees aren't on commission. </s>
<s> Buying mail order is ok to save $$ but only if you know what you're doing, can handle the configuration & set-up yourself, and don't want good service. </s>
<s> For someone who really needs their machine for work, and doesn't know a lot about them could really benefit from a place that can do set-ups and service plans. </s>
<s> When your paycheck depends on it, it's different than if it's just for messing around on myspace or cnet. </s>
