1.1.1	I recently purchased an external HD ( 3.5 desktop Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 80gig Model : ST380011A ) and a hard drive enclosure ( unbranded but working ) .	St
1.1.2	I wanted to connect the HD to my laptop with a measly 20 gig HD to store video .	St
1.1.3	I tested the enclosure with a 10 gig Quantum fireball HD that I knew worked fine .	St
1.1.4	The drive was recognised by windows was formatted etc through USB 1.1 .	St
1.1.5	When I tried to connect my drive using the enclosures firewire port however the drive failed to show in my computer .	St
1.1.6	After some serious fiddling it DID work ( once ) and I was able to transfer data successfully .	St
1.1.7	After this I put the Seagate HD in the enclosure and attached it to windows via USB 1.1 .	St
1.1.8	The drive was formatted in NTFS and worked perfectly .	St
1.1.9	Again when I tried to use firewire it failed to be recognised by windows , no matter how much i fiddled .	St
1.1.10	Now my firewire port in my laptop is a PCMCIA card ( unpowered ) , this couldnt be the problem however because the enclosure has its own power supply and you can hear the HD initialising when you flip the power switch on the enclosure .	St
1.1.11	The firewire card itself works fine , I have tested it with my Ipod mini and it recognises it and transfers data perfectly .	St
1.1.12	I 've checked device manager and the HD doesnt show in disk drives when connected via firewire , when connected via USB it shows as 'ST380011 A USB Device ' .	St
1.1.13	The firewire device shows as it should do , under Network adapters and IEEE1394 devices when plugged in .	St
1.1.14	The thing that really has me confused is that about 80 % of the time when I connect the HD via firewire I can hear the ping that shows windows has detected a new PnP device , but nothing shows in device manager , my computer or Disk management ! ! !	St
1.1.15	Please help me ! !	St
1.1.16	P.S .	St
1.1.17	I own a toshiba satellite 1110 Mobile intel celeron 1.5 Ghz 256mb RAM 16mb Mobile Radeon Graphics	St
1.2.1	That 's a windows annoyance .	St
1.2.2	A lesson I learned is to connect said units with USB on PCs and Firewire on the Macs .	St
1.2.3	It seems this is something still under development .	St
1.2.4	In closing , no OS was noted .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Apologies My OS is XP home SP 2 updated fully Thanks for taking the time to answer my query anyway .	St
1.4.1	http : //groups.google.com/groups ? hl=en & q=XP % 20FIREWIRE % 20DRIVES % 20NOT % 20RECOGNISED will find plenty of company but no solid DO THIS CURE .	St
1.4.2	I 've come to learn to not hook up a drive that way .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	If this is the reason a lot of the new 64-bit ( at least the AMD ones ) motherboards do n't support firewire .	St
1.5.2	Just a thought .	St
1.5.3	chuck	St
1.6.1	Seems fine here .	St
1.6.2	The reason you may not see firewire everywhere is that 1 dollar royalty to it 's patent holders .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	about firewire not working well on PCs .	St
1.7.2	Have seen you make it before .	St
1.7.3	Even though I may not need it , I insist that any MOBO I use include it , and the case have a front plug .	St
1.7.4	Have n't moved to 64-bit yet , but have a nice socket 939 board picked out that supports 1394A .	St
1.7.5	Cheers .	Polite
1.7.6	chuck	St
1.8.1	The only way to hook up camcorders .	St
1.8.2	If you read Microsoft 's knowledge base , they were still patching it up in SP1 , then again in SP2 and if you watch others , you get the idea that hard disks on firewire ( with Windows ) is just not ready for everyday use .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	Hopefully with the introduction of Vista Microsoft will correct this fundamental problem .	St
1.9.2	I ca n't really see it though , microsoft have their lot in with USB ( financially ) and developing support for firewire which has a superior actual throughrate than USB 2.0 ( according to CNet ZNet and other major hardware reviewers ) would just be throwing money away ! !	St
1.9.3	N.B .	St
1.9.4	Microsot get royalties every time a device is created for USB so the more USB devices the more money they make ( for those who dont already know that ) .	St
1.10.1	Feel the love ?	Ques
1.10.2	Bob	St
1.11.1	& quot ; Technically Apple is the legal guardian of this closely protected property , six of the eight key patents issued for FireWire technology cite Michael D. Jonas Teener as the chief architect responsible for their advancements .	St
1.11.2	In fact , when Teener left National Semiconductor in 1986 to join Apple Computer , he had already begun early efforts on a low-cost technology to connect hard drives to one another .	St
1.11.3	Teener became the founding chair and editor of the international standard ( IEEE-1394 ) , a blueprint for the exchange of high-bandwidth digital audio .	St
1.11.4	He was also instrumental in recruiting ideas from other innovators and in expanding the ambitions of the multimedia technology to include video streaming. & quot ; [ edited ] So , Apple gets the money from the major patents and that guy has his name credited with the invention .	St
1.11.5	Also interesting to discover that firwire was initially a system to connect hard drives together ... another case of Microsoft really dropping the ball .	St
