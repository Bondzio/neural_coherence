1.1.1	Hi guys, At first, I'm new to this forum so excuse me if I put this discussion in the wrong area First the story: I bought a Netgear WN3000RP Extender for better wifi range, because on my room upstairs I have no signal at all (so called dead spots) So, I installed it a few months ago and all was working fine, untill we had to leave the house for vancation.	St
1.1.2	Someone in the house pulled the extender out of the electric outlet.	St
1.1.3	A few weeks later we pulled it back in it, but here started the problem: I installed the extender again, but now without any succes.	St
1.1.4	(Just incase you want take a look: http://www.netgear.nl/home/products/wireless-range-extenders/WN3000RP.aspx# ) There are 4 LED lights attached to this extender.	St
1.1.5	3 of them are lighting, but the 4th won't light at all.	St
1.1.6	LED's: http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/knelly74/2012-01-27_181403_reset.png I did the exact same procedures as exampled in the installation manual, but nothing worked.	St
1.1.7	I always got this error on the end of the unsuccesful installation: Move the extender closer to the existing router or gateway.	St
1.1.8	Im really sure the extender is in the range of my actual router!	St
1.1.9	I've tried everything from restoring to factory defaults to WPS, DPS, disabling security, Nothing works..	St
1.1.10	I always get stuck on the error.	St
1.1.11	(With WPS I press both the buttons on the extender and the router, but they cant find each other.)	St
1.1.12	I hope someone can help me.	St
1.1.13	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	I read all this and bottom line this didn't work and as such you pack it up and return it.	St
1.2.2	Since it worked at one time, it's possible the replacement will work.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	So you mean return the extender and get a new one?	St
1.4.1	I always hate these boxes that say just push a button and it works.	St
1.4.2	If you can't make it work using WPS then you do it the old school way and configure it with ethernet cable like any other extender.	St
1.4.3	If it still does not work then you need to consider it is broken.	St
1.4.4	It could be as simple as WPS is disabled on your router.....	St
1.4.5	Note it is strongly recommended you leave WPS disabled and only enable for a tiny period of time when you need it.	St
1.4.6	There is a fundamental design flaw that allows a hacker to get access to any router with this enabled.	St
1.5.1	It's possible someone forgot to turn WPS on again.	St
1.5.2	But given the story, it seems this unit has indeed failed.	St
1.5.3	As there is no user diagnostics to be found and testing such as a shop is cost prohibitive then you hope it's under warranty.	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	turn the router security off and then follow the set up for the extender	St
