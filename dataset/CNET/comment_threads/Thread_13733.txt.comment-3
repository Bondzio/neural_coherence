Locked SATA ports don't increase in frequency with the FSB when overclocking.
Unlocked ones do, and therefore will corrupt the hard drives on them.
As for overclocking, I am currently overclocking my 3800 X2 (stock 3GHz) at 3.5GHz, so I am not new to it.
I understand the risks involved and have a pretty good grasp on how to do it and what's involved.
I am just wondering about the OC ratings because I haven't seen them before.
I think they probably mean the board is guaranteed to be stable at those speeds, meaning up to them you are limited only by your other components' capabilities, but I am not sure.
As for $120 to reset the CMOS, don't you think that's pretty steep?
You're basically figuring on at least a few hundred dollars an hour there assuming it takes you a very long time of about 20 minutes to open the computer up and move the jumper or pop the battery.
