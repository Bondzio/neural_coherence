Since all I'm asking about and all I want to do is provide internet to my non-wireless equipped home computer using my Verizon mobile broadband device I'm wondering why I can't just buy a USB wireless adaptor and plug this into my home computer and send wireless to the computer from my Verizon device?
or is there a reason to buy something else?
thanks
