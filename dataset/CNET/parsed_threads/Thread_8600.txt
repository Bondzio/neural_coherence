<s> few days ago, I let my computer to download a movie. </s>
<s> it took few hours. </s>
<s> When I came back and wanted to open the movie, I found my computer in 'hang' state. </s>
<s> Then I pressed power button, shut it down and started again. </s>
<s> It again became hang. </s>
<s> I thought its because of virus problem and tried to format. </s>
<s> Even after multiple tries, I couldnot format it. </s>
<s> Finally, I made only one partition of my hard disk and tried to format again. </s>
<s> And it worked. </s>
<s> This way I did the complete format of my hard disk. </s>
<s> However,my laptop did not worked out the way I wanted. </s>
<s> It is too slow. </s>
<s> And if I open up heavy programs(having more disk space i.e. </s>
<s> photoshop, dreamweaver etc) it becomes hang. </s>
<s> I took my laptop to the service center and they said that its the problem of hard disk and I should change my hard disk. </s>
<s> But I dont think that my hard disk is totally corrupted and if it is not why should I change my hard disk? </s>
<s> right?? </s>
<s> Nowadays, I open it in safe mode.Although, it generates a bit more heat than usual, it works well. </s>
<s> Can you please tell me what exactly is the problem?? </s>
<s> And how can I solve it? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> If what you call 'complete format' is a system recovery back to factory conditions (not really clear) your laptop should be as fast as it was when it was new. </s>
<s> But I assume you did a lot more than just that (such as installing photoshop, dreamweaver etc). </s>
<s> Did they tell you why they think it's the hard disk? </s>
<s> It doesn't seem very likely. </s>
<s> If it works in Safe Mode and not in normal mode, it could be a problem caused by programs/services/malware. </s>
<s> A new system recovery back to factory conditions is the solution then. </s>
<s> But it could also be an issue of your graphic card; in Safe Mode runs in a very basic way, in normal mode all of it is used. </s>
<s> Any other hardware issue (motherboard or RAM) can lead to hangs also. </s>
<s> The only way the hard disk could be the problem is that, for some reason, it doesn't run in DMA mode any more, but in PIO mode. </s>
<s> That's easy to check. </s>
<s> Then a new disk might be the solution. </s>
<s> The only way to find the cause is by elimination, and even that doesn't always work. </s>

<s> My friend normally pc hanged because of many things perhaps it is your processor ram or mother board's issue most likely I think it is your ram or processor not the hard disk. </s>
<s> The answer above by ralphmark might well be correct. </s>
<s> In a recent thread http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19681_102-561754/laptop-freezes-randomly/ it seems the random freeze was caused by a bad stick of RAM. </s>
<s> So that's a good starting point for your investigations. </s>
