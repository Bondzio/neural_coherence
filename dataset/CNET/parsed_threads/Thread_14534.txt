<s> Hi People, I just bought a HP d4100y desktop from hpshopping.com. </s>
<s> I set it up on Saturday night, configured my DSL, Outlook Express, installed my printer and scanner software and downloaded and installed Mozilla Firefox. </s>
<s> Everything was working fine. </s>
<s> I pressed the sleep button for the monitor, left the pc on and went to bed. </s>
<s> The next morning when I got up it was frozen and the fan was on making quite a bit of noise. </s>
<s> I turned it off, went out for a few hours and tried rebooting when I came back but got nothing but a black screen. </s>
<s> So, I called customer support. </s>
<s> I didn't realize HP had outsourced their support just like Dell. </s>
<s> I was on hold for over 20 minutes before someone answered (no surprise there). </s>
<s> After a half an hour of disconnecting, reconnecting, shutting down and turning things off and on, it was finally determined that my motherboard had gone bad. </s>
<s> So I'm expecting HP to have a simple solution at no cost to me but to my surprise the tech tells me she needs to send me a new motherboard and a technician along with it to ensure it doesn't get damaged during the shipping process and this was gonna cost me $29.99 for the technician. </s>
<s> Of course I told her this was ridiculous as it was a brand new computer and it should be covered under warranty. </s>
<s> She again tried to explain how the motherboard was very delicate and if she mailed it without the technician that it might get damaged. </s>
<s> My HP warranty covers the actual part but not the cost of sending the technician. </s>
<s> (I was envisioning a huge box being delivered and when I open it up, an actual live technician would pop out cradling the motherboard in his arms like a baby. </s>
<s> Would I get to keep this technician for my own personal use? </s>
<s> What do you feed them anyway?) </s>
<s> I didn't understand this as my warranty says 1 year parts AND labor. </s>
<s> I again told her that this was unacceptable for me to have to pay for anything at this point since the mb was obviously defective. </s>
<s> I told her I'd just as soon return the computer and be done with it. </s>
<s> She then told me there was another option (as if it slipped her mind) where she would send me a box for the pc, then Fed Ex would come pick it up, deliver it to a HP repair center and then deliver it back to me within 9 days at no charge. </s>
<s> I said that would be fine. </s>
<s> Then I had to wait for about five minutes on hold while she placed the order. </s>
<s> I was still a bit unsure of what was happening so I asked her why she was sending me a box because I just opened my pc last night and of course I still have the box. </s>
<s> &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot; I guess I should have asked you that before I placed the order. </s>
<s> Don't worry though, it will only take a day or two for the new box to arrive and I can't change the order now since it's already been entered in our system.&quot; Aghhh!!! </s>
<s> Anyway, now I'm thinking I might want to just return the computer to HP rather than have them replace the motherboard. </s>
<s> After all, I paid top dollar for a new computer, not a refurbished one. </s>
<s> I'm also worried that there might be other problems caused by the motherboard going. </s>
<s> I also just saw virtually the same computer, except in a Gateway box, advertised at Circuit City. </s>
<s> It came with Media Center (mine has XP Home) a printer and an extra DVD drive and cost about $400 less. </s>
<s> What woud you guys do? </s>
<s> I've been using HP products for over a decade now, but never had that much bad luck with them. </s>
<s> In fact, I've only had a few problems, and always received excellent support. </s>
<s> On one occasion when my computer started acting up and troubleshooting didn't solve it, they offered to pay for shipping and guarenteed repair by the end of the week. </s>
<s> (They never offered to ship me an inflatable repairman, which, by the way, eats crisp 20-dollar bills. </s>
<s> ;)) I decided to check some other things first, and found out it was due to a corrupted BIOS update a few days earlier. </s>
<s> Glad to know they were so willing to help, but glad I didn't lose my computer for a week. </s>
<s> However, in your case, it sounds like you're getting the royal flush...along with your pocketbook and technological security. </s>
<s> They sent you a lemon, don't want to fully admit it, and tried to avoid paying for shipping expenses as well as the replacement part by ''forgetting'' to mention it. </s>
<s> I love HP, but even I wouldn't go along with all that. </s>
<s> Since the motherboard was faulty, I'd immediately question (as you did) what else might be wrong, and reqest a new PC, not just a replacement part. </s>
<s> There is a reason ''remanufactured'' PCs only come with a 90-day warrenty, even though all damaged parts have been replaced. </s>
<s> Since Circuit City's sale on the Gateway is better than what you got, and for less money, I'd definately send it back with a note attached...''I would like to return your faulty product, and request that you forward my check to Gateway, c/o Circuit City.'' </s>
<s> Just explain that you've had a bad experience with them, don't want to chance having another damaged computer sent, and that you've found a better deal elsewhere. </s>
<s> Hopefully they'll understand and refund your money. </s>
<s> If not, don't settle for less than a new computer, and don't pay a penny for shipping, repairs, or pet repairmen. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> I have the sa4000T and been encountering beeps everyonce in a while and the computer will not post. </s>
<s> First it started as 3 or 4 short beeps, now recently like today, i've received one short beep and 8 additional fast short beeps. </s>
<s> R.Profitt said to use my warranty, but i've had my machine for 7 months and don't want them to reformat my hard drive. </s>
<s> SInce, i have a temporary solution, that will allow the pc to startup, i will just leave it alone and not let the nusiance to get to me. </s>
<s> Besides, i went to hp's site for it and it shows for the motherboard, it only cost $18 and i would have to send back the defective one. </s>
<s> Sounds good to me... </s>
<s> I cannot believe that hp/compaq will have motherboard problems with that model especially since every single one is customized directly from hp/compaq. </s>
<s> I will never buy another hp/compaq. </s>
<s> BUt go for emachines/gateway for my next computer, or rather build my own. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> Roger, are you saying they told you the motherboard costs $18 or did I misunderstand. </s>
<s> The tech support lady I spoke with says the motherboards cost about $350. </s>
<s> Both prices seem out of whack to me but then again, I don't know that much about computers. </s>
<s> John: Thanks for your input. </s>
<s> The more and more I think about it the more I want to just return the pc and get a new one, this time from a local vendor so if there's a problem I can just bring it back. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Yes RETURN it. </s>
<s> Only accept repair after the return policy time period in over. </s>
<s> (They never offered to ship me an inflatable repairman, which, by the way, eats crisp 20-dollar bills. </s>
<s> Note: If they are not crisp, demands $50 bills instead. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> My motherboard costs $18 as its the 8 month predecessor to yours that looks exactly the same, yet was manufacturered by compaq. </s>
<s> Your motherboard only costs $190. </s>
