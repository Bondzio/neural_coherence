I was looking at laptops and was wondering if there is a major difference between the mobile amd 3400 and the regular one for notebooks. They seem to carry the same features such as hyper transport and power now. Please help!

The tighter artwork in the CPU allows them to use a lower core voltage. Thus lower power consumption.
