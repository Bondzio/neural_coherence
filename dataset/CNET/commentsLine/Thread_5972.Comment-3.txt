keep this in mind: i had an hp pavilion computer (6 yrs old) with windows 98. in general computer runs great and fast.
i had bestbuy to do a &quot;customization&quot; for #29 and they say it will cut time when you &quot;start&quot; your computer.
basically it cuts down on software loading in the background.
i am happy i pay for it since i dont know how to do it other than going to &quot;starup&quot; and unchecked the software manually.
it has a media center and thats what i wanted cause of hooking it up with my 360 (which i did and its a plus).
but, pc doesnt have the &quot;hook ups&quot; to connect your pc to your tv, but i am pretty sure there are other ways in hooking it up (im getting info on this).
i havent played any games like you mention (everquest) that why i was asking if anyone else have.
if you go to  it will give you a more understanding of what this chipset can do (i barely learning the pc language/technically).
i am assuming that it will run good with &quot;low settings&quot; if you play everquest.
but for doom3 it doesnt cut it (pcstats).
but overall it is a great chipset for the money i paid for.
hope this helps you a little bit!
