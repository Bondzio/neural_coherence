<s> Hey everyone. </s>
<s> Every time I plug something with removable storage into my laptop (iPod, digital camera with memory stick), the laptop doesn't recognise it in My Computer. </s>
<s> In Device Manager, it says it's there and working properly, but I can't access it, like can't get to my photos from DSC. </s>
<s> Help?!? </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Did it work before? </s>
<s> Uninstall and reinstall the driver, then restart your notebook. </s>
<s> It should work fine after that. </s>
<s> na, it's a new laptop so have never tried before. </s>
<s> and yea have uninstalled the driver but same problem. </s>
<s> it doesn't even recognise it under My Computer-' Drives with Removable Storage' would the fact I'm connected to the office network have anything to do with it? </s>
<s> I always use this stupid way to solve my hardware connection problems and it always work. </s>
<s> Go to add hardware and click &quot;yes that the hardware is connected&quot;. </s>
<s> It will list you all the hardwares those you mentioned &quot;working properly&quot;. </s>
<s> Highlight that hardware and click next and finish. </s>
<s> It will go to the troublesthooting menu and will guide you step by step. </s>
<s> I have the same problem with my computer in my office. </s>
<s> It fails to read some hardware sometimes and it always said working properly. </s>
