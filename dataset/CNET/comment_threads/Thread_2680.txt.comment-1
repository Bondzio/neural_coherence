Hi fellow members I reside outside the United States and am in need of a desktop system but unfortunately cannot afford to purchase one in the short to mid term.
As a contract facilitator at a skills training centre, where I teach level 1 computer studies; my stipend does not allow me to replace my system that crashed over six (6) months ago.
I cannot even afford the cost of repair(it needs a new mother board and processor).
I am also pursuing distance learning studies therefore you see that I am trying desperately to keep a positive attitude.
Currently, school is out and so I borrow friends' system when they have a little downtime; which is usually infrequent and haphazard.
Computer recycling programs that allow request from non-US citizens are yet to discovered; believe me I have tried.
Is there someone out there who has a internet-ready system that they no longer need and are willing to donate?
Thanks in advance.
