I know you cannot upgrade xp x32 to vista 64 while xp is installed.
But i know that vista upon a fresh install off of an upgrade disk will only ask you to insert a disk from a previous OS to prove you are &quot;upgrading&quot;.
Will that work if i am installing vista x64, and insert xp x32 for the proof of an upgrade.
Thanks in advance
