Hi, I have just ordered new parts for a computer, which has not yet arrived, including a Sapphire Radeon X1950PRO 512MB DDR3 and two monitors with only VGA input.
The graphics card has dual DVI output and i was hoping to just use two converters (DVI - VGA) to connect the screens.
I have now, however, just read that some DVI outputs called DVI-D do not support these adapters and cannot be used on VGA monitors.
Please tell me if this graphics card will work with them or not!
I can't seem to find if it does or not on the aria.co.uk website.
It only says: Digital video standard: Digital Visual Interface (DVI) Many thanks.
