<s> I am having massive trouble connecting my new Windows Vista laptop to my ethernet LAN. </s>
<s> I can connect to the internet fine on all machines, but I cannot see any files on the Vista system from the others or vice-versa. </s>
<s> I'm using a Belkin F5D7633 modem-router, a Win XP desktop, a Win 98 desktop, and a new hp laptop with Vista loaded. </s>
<s> It could be a range of things. </s>
<s> But one simple question is: What does it mean when you cannot get a response when pinging the same machine? </s>
<s> My Vista system gets an answer back from the router and the Win98 PC, but not itself. </s>
<s> Thanks, mt64ed </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Thank you My laptop Vista firewall is already turned off, but there is a firewall in the Modem-Router. </s>
<s> Do you think this could be causing a problem? </s>
<s> I would have thought it only affects outside comms. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I don't run Vista, but is there a File and Printer sharing option? </s>
<s> Yes, in the Vista Firewall there is a File and Printer Exception box, and in general, there is file and printer sharing, set by password permissions. </s>
<s> I have set these up properly as far as I know. </s>
<s> I log on to all machines with the same user and password. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I seem to have discovered the reason for being unable to see files on my other PCs on the LAN. </s>
<s> The Vista Network and Sharing Center kept sending me to Windows Firewall settings, but there also is the Norton (*$?%) firewall in which I found 'File Sharing' blocked. </s>
<s> Turning that off made it OK at least for the wireless connection to the LAN, and I assume this also works for the ethernet connection. </s>
<s> I still have a username and password problem to my Win98 system, but I'm getting closer. </s>
<s> Being able to see the folders is much more satisfying. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
