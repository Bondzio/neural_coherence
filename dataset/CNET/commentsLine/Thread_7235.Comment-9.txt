i'm a big reader and with my poor coordination (you should see my typos before i correct) and a laptop is a bit cumbersome to read with comfortably.
even large print fonts now are only 20 minutes a day (pc kindle now).
they are also awkward to carry at doctors and in the hospitals.
i'm just going to read via kindle, check mail, view the jpg's family sends and maybe, hulu.com and games.com.
i would have bought a laptop as i do the above plus writing, surfing and publisher.
but someone bought me this hurl-it crapperd, and when you make less than 940 a month, free is better and you look for the best bang for your buck.
like i said, multiple disabilities: 100% deaf, just shy of legally blind, wheelchair bound, partial paralysis and numbness.
after extreme financial & housing abuses by trustees (formerly known as brothers) i now look for the best i can get for what i have to spend.
