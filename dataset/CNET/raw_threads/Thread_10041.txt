SD card, and I've used it for over 3 months now on my Kodak Easyshare DX4330 Digital camera. When I observe the card, I see scratches on the gold plates of the card. The card still works, but I'm worried that it might not last longer. A few years ago, I bought my first SD memory card, and I experienced the same problem, scratches. Can anyone help me???
