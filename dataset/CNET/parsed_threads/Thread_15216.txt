<s> I just upgraded to Verizon's MiFi 2200 because I was tired of having to wrestle my partner for the single use USB modem I used to have. </s>
<s> The problem was that neither of our desktop computers had wireless capability so I went out and purchased two Belkin wireless G 7050 adapters. </s>
<s> After installing the drivers I found that both computers would connect, then disconnect and would or would not reconnect when hitting the repair option for the network icon. </s>
<s> I decided to try using my laptop, which has a built in wireless device, to see if it was the Belkin adapter. </s>
<s> I learned that if only one of the Belkin adaptors is in use, everything works find. </s>
<s> So, the laptop and one desktop can be on line, but not the two desktops at the same time. </s>
<s> I wrote Belkin about this but have yet to hear back. </s>
<s> Does anyone have an idea as to why the MiFi will not connect through two Belkin adapters at the same time? </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Could be the usual settings like WEP (busted!) </s>
<s> or other things but I couldn't find such detail in your post. </s>
<s> Try http://forums.cnet.com/networking-and-wireless-forum/?tag=forum-w;forums06 and how we ask for wifi to be setup. </s>
<s> If it still drops maybe it's defective, not charged, etc. </s>

<s> I gave up on getting the Belkin wireless adapters to work and bought two Zonet wireles PCI adapters. </s>
<s> They worked perfectly from the installation. </s>
<s> BTW, I returned the Belkin wireless duds to Best Buy, 25 days after pruchase, and they gave me my money back! </s>
<s> Way to go Geek Squad! </s>
