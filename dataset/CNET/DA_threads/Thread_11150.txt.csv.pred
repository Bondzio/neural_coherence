1.1.1	I have recently purchased a Samsung BD-5300 smart blu ray , plugged in the ethernet cable , all was fine , I am able to download apps , watch youtube , bbc iplayer etc , but a box keeps appearing saying smarthub needs to be updated I click ok , then another box appears telling me no connection and to check network settings ?	Ques
1.1.2	Network must be fine if I am able to download apps and watch online ?	Ques
1.2.1	Try downloading the latest firmware ( released July 2 ) to a thumb drive and load it to your BD player .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/BD-D5300/ZA	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply , I tried the fw update but I have the current latest fw	St
1.4.1	Samsung has had server issues ( they do n't like to read that , they call it something else . )	St
1.4.2	And we know that the time it takes the new server address time to get the addresses out to the DNS at the ISPs .	St
1.4.3	I 'm going to break my rule about acronyms here and ask you to google acronyms that are new to you first , then ask if you ca n't find them .	St
1.4.4	With that out of the way , Samsung network issues are plentiful and vary depending on the country .	St
1.4.5	Since governments mandate that certain content does not flow freely ( a discussion on its own ! )	St
1.4.6	we have to hear more about what country this is in as well as try a few things .	St
1.4.7	My favorite easy fix is to set our router to use the Google DNS ( see google and type in Google DNS for info . )	St
1.4.8	I 'd start with that as well as setting the date and time on the BD 5300 .	St

1.5.1	Thanks for the info I looked on google regarding google DNS and it said in control pnael under network to change my DNS to some numbers which I have done , I am going to try the B/R shortly to see if it will connect , I am in the UK if that helps	St
1.6.1	I know that Netflix 's roll out has been bumpy and with that you have Samsung 's own issues .	St
1.6.2	Be sure to check all the date and times in all devices involved too .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Just checked again , got the message about updates but no network connection , date and time is also correct	St
1.8.1	It means that Samsung 's servers are likely out of whack offline .	St
1.8.2	It does not mean anything is wrong with your network .	St
1.8.3	If it 's like before it goes away when Samsung fixes it .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
