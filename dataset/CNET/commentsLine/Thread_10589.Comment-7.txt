it's not bad to save and upgrade an old case.
what you save is the case and its fans, the power supply if it's adequate, your optical drives, and little things like card readers or what have you.
you also save the landfill from a pile of toxic junk.
often times the only thing really worn out on an old computer is just that it can't keep up with the demands of today's programs.
a new mobo that supports modern cpus and ddr2 ram could be done reasonably nicely for under $400 for it all.
it's definitely easier to toss and buy new, but since time isn't an issue here...
