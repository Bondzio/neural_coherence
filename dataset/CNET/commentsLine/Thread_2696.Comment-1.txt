i have a western digital 80gb drive that i was using as an external drive.
i took the drive off for a bit and i believe i even placed some of my friends files on there so that i can back up his drive.
weelll now that i have placed the drive back into the casing to make it a external hard drive again, nothing picks up, i made sure all the jumpers where in place correctly and nothing.
when placing the drive into my pc as a slave this is what i see wdc$wd84vfb-04cea6 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 17.47w17 and then my machine will not boot up.
i take the drive off and i am able to get into my computer.
i have alot of pics on that drive including of my late mother that just recently passed away and some of my exfiance, yeah i know shes my ex but i still like too see her pics and i have other personal pics on there.
is there anything that can be done????
please let me know
