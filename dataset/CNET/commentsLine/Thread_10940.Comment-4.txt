i posted elsewhere but i had a x700 brandnew and it kept loosing my vedio signal drove me nuts still not sure if i have it right but i reinstalled the 5.2 catalyst and the bios and the motherboard for a 775 chipset so far everything is going well but i haven't stressed the system yet as that could be a sure way to get my monitor to go on and off again,same driver i believe lots of issues with different boards in doing my research, i thought going to a 850 or some other pci express vedio might solve my problem as they have a seperate powersupply, geuss not.
