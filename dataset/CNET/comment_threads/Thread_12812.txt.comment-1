Just replaced HD on 5 year old Compaq running ME.
Now can't find CD to restore OS.
Am I s--- out of luck or will Compaq send me something as a registered owner?
I refuse to pay full price for Windows after laying out money for that hard drive.
I'll buy a Linux program from a vendor first.
Is it hard to learn?
