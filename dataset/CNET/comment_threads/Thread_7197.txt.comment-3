I was tol some people saying theat if we want to watch 1080p movies, we need minimum 1GB graphics card.
And I would like to watch the 1080p movies in the laptop not connected through HDMI port.
Please suggest me whether I should go for graphics card or not?
Also which type of screen?matte screen or glossy screen?will there be any difference in watching movies?
