AMD Athlon XP 3200+ 1GB (2X512MB) PC3200 DDR RAM 160GB HD ATI X1300PRO AGP 256MB (Integrated gpu for now) 19in. widescreen Envision LCD 1440x900 Every time I attempt to play some video or load a game my computer restarts. Originally I thought it was my video card, so I pulled the ATI card out but I am still getting the same problems. Now I'm beginning to think that its the RAM. However, this raises a few questions. 1. I have 2 sticks of 512MB PC3200 in there. 1 Samsung module is OEM and came with the PC. The other stick is PNY brand. Is it possible that only 1 stick has failed, since I am not getting a total system failure? I am still able to do basic tasks on the internet and such, but its the large stuff that will trigger the restart. Or have both sticks failed? 2. If only 1 stick has failed, which one would it likely be? I'm thinking the Samsung, since it is a poorer quality stick. Or maybe the PNY? 3. Is there any way to test my RAM without using a program that uses a floppy? I don't have a floppy drive. And the programs I've seen want you to create a floppy boot disk. Thanks alot.
