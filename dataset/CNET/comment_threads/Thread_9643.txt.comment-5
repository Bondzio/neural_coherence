Hi Bob I agree with your view on multiple drivers.
Maybe now outdated but I prefer the seperate scanner and printer configuration and for really good quality photo scans I think a dedicated unit is better.
For the moment I am just trying to find a decent scanner that will be compatible with my wireless Samsung printer.
The manufacturers support depts aren't much use as the reply is more often than not &quot;a definite maybe&quot; eg canon.
Not really much use unless you buy on a sale or return basis.
