Hard drives are one thing I don't risk in my computer.
If I get any errors, even one, I replace it since you have no idea when it will die on you.
My suggestion is to buy a new drive and install it in the computer.
Then install your system while the other drive is not plugged in at all.
Once your new system is up and running, plug the old one in as a slave so the new one still boots.
Then copy everything you need over.
If you need help with these steps just let me know and I will be more detailed on what ever steps you need help.
