The Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.
Palestinians celebrated with euphoria the long-delayed opening of their international airport Tuesday as a parade of planes swooped down from cottony skies and glided to a literal red-carpet landing in the flatlands of Gaza.
Cruising at 19,000 feet on Saturday in the cockpit of the first Palestinian Airlines flight to depart from Gaza's new international airport, Capt. Jamal Al-How from the Jabaliya refugee camp could not restrain himself.
