1.1.1	I have a macbook air of storage capacity 64GB and it is insufficient for my videos, photos and music.	St
1.1.2	I bought a time capsule, intending to use it as a media server but how am I going to backup these files if I store them on a time capsule.	St
1.1.3	Alternatively I can store them on a portable external hard drive.	St
1.1.4	I think that is a better option actually but how am I going to back up an external hard drive?	St
1.1.5	Appreciate some advice.	St
1.2.1	I use a few externals, memory sticks and &quot;sync&quot; software to keep them all in sync.	St
1.2.2	Remember that such things are not &quot;storage&quot; since one slip of the mouse button and we've deleted or formatted a drive.	St
1.2.3	So the old IT lore of backup rules is written over and over.	St
1.2.4	Safety in numbers and in location.	St
1.2.5	A single backup is not safe enough.	St
