if you don't want to read the full post, i made a summary at the bottom.
i have 2 hard drives in this sytem.
the master is a 20gb drive, and the slave is a 180 gb drive that had 2 partitions, 1 ntfs and the other fat32.
i was using windows xp pro (sp2) just fine; i was booting from the 20 gig and using the 180 to store media (music, video, games, installers, an image of the 20 gig drive, backups, etc).
because the 20 was upgraded from 98se to xp and converted to ntfs, it was using 512b clusters, and i wanted the 4kb standard for some reason, so i decided to reformat and reinstall.
after reformatting the 20 gig and doing a clean xp pro install, i found that the 180 gig drive registered as an unpartitioned 128 gig drive.
i did not format the 180 during installation, though i did notice that it registered as unformatted during installation (at the point where you choose where to install windows) .
i popped in knoppix to see if the data was still there.
knoppix read the data just fine.
how can i make windows recognize my drive?
summary: was working perfectly.
reformated and reinstalled winxp on master, slave shows up as unformatted.
linux can read slave just fine.
how do i make windows detect my drive and data?
