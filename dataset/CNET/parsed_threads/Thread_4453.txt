<s> So it has finally come time to replace our 6 year old PC, and after some looking, I've decided to get a custom PC. </s>
<s> Lacking the knowledge/desire to build it myself, I've decided to use Georgia Computer Workshop (www.gcworkshop.com) I am trying to keep the computer under $650, not including the monitor, and I have a couple of questions: First, has anyone ever used or heard of Georgia Computer Workshop? </s>
<s> I can only find precious little information about it. </s>
<s> What I have found has been good, but lacking in quantity. </s>
<s> Second, the computer itself. </s>
<s> I am planning on using an Athlon 64 x2 4200+ processor, 2 gigabytes of RAM, about 200 gigabytes of hard drive space, and a GeForce 7600GS. </s>
<s> I am fairly stumped when it comes to the motherboard. </s>
<s> What exactly would constitute as a good motherboard? </s>
<s> Most every other component I can research and understand what they are talking about, but I am clueless when it comes to the main component of the computer. </s>
<s> Also, what type of power supply would I need? </s>
<s> The case I am using comes with a 450W power supply. </s>
<s> I assume this would be fine, but it is always nice to know. </s>
<s> Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated Thanks </s>
<s> Antec Nine Hundred is a good choice for case. </s>
<s> motherboards are becoming like hard drives. </s>
<s> there's little difference in performance of the latest generation and almost all are good. </s>
<s> for the amd platform, there are two primary chipsets: nvidia 500 series and amd's 580 & 690. since you didn't mention using dual graphics cards, either chipset will be fine. </s>
<s> then you just need to decide what features you want on the mobo. </s>
<s> here are two good inexpensive mobos. </s>
