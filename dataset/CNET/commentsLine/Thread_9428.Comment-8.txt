two months ago i bought a midrange laptop... two weeks later i see it $300au cheaper at another store.
but i don't care because its to be expected.
(please note, our main computer is a pentium 166.)
something new is always going to come out, but if you wait and wait and wait... your just going to get nowhere.
computer progress wont just halt for people to buy them.
forget about future technologies.
they arent here yet.
if you feel you need a new computer, just get one.
