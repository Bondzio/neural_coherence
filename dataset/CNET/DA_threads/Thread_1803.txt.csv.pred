1.1.1	Can somebody please provide me with a link on where Cnet has reviews on flash memory.	Sug
1.1.2	Thank you for the help.	St
1.2.1	The problem is this.	St
1.2.2	These are commodity items with some few stock designs.	St
1.2.3	I can get some 255MB SD Stick from Sandisk for about 50 bucks.	St
1.2.4	There may be no reason for a review since nothing differentiates the sticks of memory.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	.	St
1.4.1	http://reviews.cnet.com/4502-3186_7-0.html?tag=ont-key&qt=keychainusb&qn=Keychain But as I suspected, dated information on models that you may not find in this commodity item.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thank you for the link.	St
1.5.2	I have a 256 mb Lexar jumpdrive 2.0 (I got for $50 on e-bay).	St
1.5.3	It has worked like a charm with my lap top, even when I used it on a Mac.	St
1.5.4	I am thinking that a 1 gig stick would be even better and before I went out looking for one, I would see if a particular brand is better than another.	St
1.5.5	I guess they are really like floppies and all about the same quality.	St
