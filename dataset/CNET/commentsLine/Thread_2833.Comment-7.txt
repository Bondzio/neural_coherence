i am using a westell 2110 dual connect router with verizon.
the model is b90 210015-04. i have noticed that they now offer a combined modem and router with their service.
we need to check with them anyway since we could get a much cheaper rate by paying for a year.
they were supposed to replace the model some time ago and didn't.
i found a new ehternet cable made all the difference in the connection.
we also moved it up higher so it didn't get bumped.
