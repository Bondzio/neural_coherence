Take a note of your current IP address (ipconfig /all in the command prompt) -- (sometimes you will get wrong IP, dns, dns server, gateway, etc.)
Turn it off for a day or two (to let it release the lease time) Reset the router to the default setting, usually by pressing a small button (look in the manual) Then try to connect them to the Modem and PC... check your IP again and look for any differences with your previous IP etc.
If you still have problem, try other router IF possible, to see if your router ain't broken.
Good Luck
