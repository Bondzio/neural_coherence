for the delay its a ecs p965t-a and on there web site my mobo supports MEMORY 4 x 240-pin DDR2 DIMM socket support up to 8 GB Support DDR2 800/667/533 MHz DDR2 Memory and my pentium is a core 2 duo e6300 runing at 1.86ghz BUT im thinking of ocerclocking it to 333mhz FSB thats all the motherboard will do.
So i need better memory but not sure wat type.
And if i get better memory if i keep my old memoty in will it slow down my new memory thanks chris
