well i always shop for my computer needs on newegg.
and when it comes time for me to get a hard drive i look at the reviews/storage capacity/price and see what i can get for the best bang for my buck.
i always try to stick to wd and seagate though.
right now i've been using seagate and i haven't had any problems.
