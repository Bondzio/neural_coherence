i hear the problems don't exist with the pc card, and i may return my usb adapter for the pc card one.
any suggestions for a quick fix to get it to work?
there must be some reason - albeit minorly complicated and laborious - involving configuration.
and i know the adapter works - i tried it on an xp laptop
