Press f1 to continue. My mouse is wireless and connects via USB receiver. My keyboard is operartive. 2 - Pressing F1 continues the boot process successfully 3 - I want to eliminate this problem keyboard/mouse issue by resetting the BIOS to default settings, however I cannot get to the BIOS during a boot, by pressing the F2 key. I get the keyboard /mouse message. System - XP Svc. Pack 2 Ram 756 MB Computer - Dell Dimension 8200. Can anyone help me with this connundrum?

There is one odd item. A mouse hooked into the standard mouse connection does not work. If this is a clue to anything let me know.

15262	15	246275	2480280	2480226	xFulcrumx	5/7/07 7:43 AM	1.17852378E12	soo	so you tried booting with just the keyboard and it worked ok?. the only prob you have is getting into the Bios?. so take side panel of your case and pull the batt and leave out for about 30seconds then put back in. and before you boot up just use keyboard and mouse.
15262	16	246275	2480378	2480222	billzhills	5/7/07 9:52 AM	1.17853152E12	Follow the link	The BIOS settings for reporting keyboard failure is set to enable by default. This setting needs to be changed to disable. If I remember correctly you have tried a PS2 KB with the same error. If this is so you may have a damaged port. Bill
