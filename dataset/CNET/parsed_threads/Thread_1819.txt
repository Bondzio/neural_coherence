<s> And to ask what is best means that you may not know either. </s>
<s> For example one person things nonglare screens are best, the next loathes them because you lose clarity. </s>

<s> Look at the machines one can afford and then do more research on them. </s>
<s> Given no limit on country or hints about preference (Glossy, antiglare) best is to go shopping. </s>
