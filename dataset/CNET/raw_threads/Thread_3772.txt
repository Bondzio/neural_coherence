The gateway I am wanting to get only comes available with an Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Extreme Audio. For heavy gaming will this be enough? It costs $80 extra and I know that is extremely pricey. But I really dont feel like having to mess with it as soon as I buy it. Please let me know if you have used this card for gaming and were not impressed with it. If you think buying a ExtremeMusic or ExtremeGamer seperately would be a better choice for hard core gaming. Thank you for reading this toooo long post and also for your oppinion.
