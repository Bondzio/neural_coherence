<s> i installed windows server 2003 without realising that it would conflict with my main system which is windows xp 2002 are there any ways of removing the server version, as i can only find it after the bios boot up page appears then the system asks me which program to run on for about 10 seconds? </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> there could be an answer. </s>
<s> try loading XP in the opearting system loader (if the server runs without asking you, press F8 after boot...) In XP go to System Properties -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Starup and Recovery-&gt; Settings. </s>
<s> There you could opt the operating system you need to load. </s>
<s> Press edit and delete the line wherein Windows Server 2003 is written. </s>
<s> Be Careful, for you can delete XP.. (and if you did so, go to the same place in Win Server 2003). </s>
<s> After deleting it from this bios line, you can easly delete it from the directory you've installed it... FYI, it's not fully!! </s>
<s> deleting it... there are many places where WIN Server places itself, such as c:\Documents and Settings and many more.... if you really need the space in your harddisk, take a day off and delete all of those appearances... Bye </s>
