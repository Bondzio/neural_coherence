alienware has recently been trying to overhaul its customer service.
they appear to be contacting disgruntled customers (months after the problems were originally reported) and offering to fix everything that needs fixing.
it seems pretty clear that all the bad press on cnet and other forums has really hurt alienware's numbers--and made the company more willing to take care of their paying customers.
that's just one more example of &quot;people power&quot; getting real results.
don't ever let anyone tell you that your postings on cnet and other forums &quot;don't matter&quot; and &quot;won't make any difference&quot;.
they certainly do matter, and they certainly will make a difference!
rock on!
sincerely, jdm
