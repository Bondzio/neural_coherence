I tend to setup dual drives as primary on each IDE / ATA port, with CD drives and DVD's as secondary.
This maximizes transfers from the hard drives.
This is especially true if you are doing a lot of disk access or program swapping due to low memory.
If however your games etc.
require the CD or DVD to be online, then hook the two hard drives up on the same port and your CD and DVD drives on the other.
Same reason, so that you are not constantly swapping between the CD and a hard drive on the same port.
