I read your post twice and missed the make, model of the machine so I can't offer a link to that driver.
But that message also happens if you download the ATI drivers.
For AGP you have to find the AGP HOTFIX drivers from ATI.
The ones you find are only for PCIE so be sure you get the AGP HOTFIX and absolutely get that motherboard package installed first.
