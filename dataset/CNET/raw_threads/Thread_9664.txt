Is there any place that they could give these computers to that might actually make use of them? Ideally I would like to see the school get some money for them but if that's not possible I'd rather see some organization put them to use rather than just tossing them. Any suggestions?

You can google away for some outside source and/or recycling organization. They're out there but you may still need to pay to ship. For the most part forget about getting any money for old stuff, too much out there. Next time the school runs into extra items, see if the vendor they buy from will accept used items as part of the deal, push for it. Check charities and the like and see what if anything they will accept, they have limits too, so inquire. -----Willy
