called in to who?
(dumb question?
lol) this is why i posted my problem here, hoping someone had the same issue and a fix for it.
it's quite a unique case, otherwise it would be known by netgear.
there were a few previous versions of firmware that seemed to perform better -- but the problem was still there.
that suggests a flaw in the firmware, but there's thousands of people who use netgear routers on the same isp as me.
it would be known straight away if there was such a problem.
when i test it at my friend's house on his connection, if the result is fine, i'll ask for a new cable modem from my isp.
my current one is around 5 years old and the modems they ship now are completely different.
