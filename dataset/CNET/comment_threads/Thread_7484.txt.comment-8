When you say &quot;won't cut it&quot; what exactly do you mean?
Are you saying I can't connect wirelessly to the N router, then hardwired to the G router (which is hardwired to the i7 server) and get the speed I need?
Because I'm *real* close to the speed I need with the G router wirelessly alone (sometimes, when the atmosphere and moons align, I can actually play those high stream movies -- other times I only get through 10 or 15 minutes before they freeze).
Hardwired through the G router (with just cat 5) everything works fine, of course, even with the shares on my very slow server (and even with a slow USB external drive).
And I *will* go hardwired to the G router if I have to, but I'd like to get wireless if I can.
But please elaborate on what you mean, because I'm still trying to learn.
