as explained to you the simple fix was to replace the enclosure.
the new enclosure would have the required ac adapter.
you swap hd out and then use the new enclosure to access data.
once done, you have the new enclosure as a working ext.
hd again.
if that doesn't work provided all was done correctly, then you have some true or 2ndary fault to deal with.
also, steven's suggestion to gain access for data alone, provided you have the required port and cabling, use a desktop pc and mount it as an int.
hd in proper setup.
either way will work to gain access to data.
