i can only guess this is your first encounter with that technology but not one remote desktop i've seen comes close to what you get on the real machine.
in fact, the reason for such access is pretty simple.
to get at the desktop for the things you can't do on the other machine.
for me i use it to grab a file i forgot and when done i'm back to my machine.
if you see over 1 fps, that's pretty normal.
