im not quite sure this would work, but with my hdd [just a normal sata hdd] i go into cmd type convert [drive letter]:/FS:NTFS then if it says Convert cannot gain exclusive access to the drive_letter:, so it cannot convert it now.
Would you like to schedule it to be converted the next time the system restarts (Y/N)?
press y then restart your computer and then it should be done.
may go through a screen before the welcome screen
