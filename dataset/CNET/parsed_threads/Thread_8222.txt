<s> I'm Running Windows XP home edition and i've installed the ATi radeon 9600 SE video card but im having some toruble. </s>
<s> When i installed it everything seemed to go fine, windows found the hardware and installed it. </s>
<s> But when i tried to install the drivers and software that are on the CD it says the following: &quot;INF Error, Video driver not found, click ok&quot; and when i click ok it says the following &quot;Try to set up your display adapter with a standard VGA driver before running setup.&quot; Ive tried downloading the drivers directly from the ATI site but i cant get anything to work. </s>
<s> The video card isnt busted or anything, im using it right now but i just dont know what to do. </s>
<s> XP installs its own drivers when you first put in the card. </s>
<s> The usual sequence is to uninstall ATI software from Add and Remove Programs, uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager. </s>
<s> Then you use the latest drivers from here: http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp </s>
<s> try this: http://ati.com/support/driver.html </s>
<s> Do NOT reboot after deleting the adapter from the device manager. </s>
<s> It'll ask you to do so though, but if you do, the same drivers will be installed again after reboot. </s>
<s> Hi, Try downloading the Cat uninstaller and running it that will get rid of all ATI files on your machine. </s>
<s> then try two things. </s>
<s> 1, Just install the driver and not the control panel and multimedia driver. </s>
<s> 2,Install everything and then turn off fast write in the smartgart section of the advanced settings of the display. </s>
