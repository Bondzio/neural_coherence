yes, regarding power, i just read:: power-hungry graphics if there's one area of computer hardware that is getting a bit out of hand, it's pc graphics.
ati and nvidia are releasing newer and faster products at a breakneck pace -- single-card sli powerhouses, double-wide ati crossfire behemoths, nvidia's quad sli -- all seemingly designed with no heed to power consumption or heat production.
if you think directx 10 will alleviate these concerns, you're dead wrong: the combined requirements of vista, directx 10, and upcoming 3d games and applications will drive gpu technology through the ceiling.
companies like thermaltake are even ramping up for this increased power draw by releasing dedicated gpu power supplies.
these units range from 250 to 300 watts, fit into an open 5.25-inch drive bay, and supply power exclusively to the gpu.
from these wattage specifications, it's safe to assume that first-generation directx 10 cards will be power-hungry products indeed.
heat production is another potential sore spot, and all indications say that cooling will be a challenge for vista-ready gpus.
the only hope is that second-generation or subsequent revisions will bring directx 10 products that get us back on track with a sane balance of high performance and energy savings, much as nvidia has done with the evolution of its geforce 7600 and 7900 gpus.
