1.1.5	I'm pretty sure I want an Intel Dual 2 core proc, alteast 2-5 gigs of fast ram, a fast bus, a great video card, etc (in other words I want the thing to be fast) The biggest software program I run is Quickbooks Pro, soon to be 2008.	St

1.1.11	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	Given that today's most common versions of Windows don't give more than 2GB of ram to the application and even then only 3G with cajoling and the application compiled &quot;special&quot; why are you thinking of going beyond 2GB?	St
