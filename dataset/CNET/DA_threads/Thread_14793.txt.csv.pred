1.1.1	After i installed the proper driver from the original CD, colors changed, contrast is bad (i cannot see anymore the rectangles from the test image: http://www.lcdreviewz.com/Brightness-and-Contrast-Adjustment ) and _my eyes hurt_.	St
1.1.2	Even if i change contrast value from the monitor panel to 0%, i'm still unable to see the rectangles in the image from the link above.	St
1.1.3	I tried uninstalling the driver (rolled back to microsoft default monitor) - the problem is persisting!	St
1.1.4	I deleted the color profile &quot;LG...&quot; from color management, the problem is still there!	St
1.1.5	how do i get the initial settings back?	Ques
1.1.6	Same problem on both windows xp and 7.	St
1.2.1	sorry, i found out that the problem was the monitor itself, i guess i've adjusted contrast from nvidia panel before, and updating the video driver just reset those contrast settings.	St
1.2.2	i think i'm gonna replace this monitor soon.	St
