I'm using a fairly new built PC at work running W2K, Asus mobo w/fan and AMD XP 2800 Processor, Allied 400W PS w/two fans.
The CPU is around 2 GHz I think and RAM is 512.
According to a third party app the CPU temp is 58C - 60C and that seems too high to me.
Others here seem to think because it's an AMD Processor that the temp is normal.
Is it normal?
Or should I worry about it being too high?
I'm used to CPU temps in the 30s.
