<s> I want to revive an old PC based on an ASUS A7V266-E motherboard. </s>
<s> The only part missing is a video card (I have a PCI card but I would rather use an AGP one). </s>
<s> My motherboard accepts up to 4X AGP video cards. </s>
<s> Although I found many of them, they are generally more expensive than 8X cards and also have less video memory. </s>
<s> I also found that some 8X cards are backward compatible with 4X slots (some are even compatible with 2X slots). </s>
<s> I would like to know if all 8X AGP video cards are backwards compatible with 4X. </s>
<s> I really would appreciate any input and/or suggestions. </s>

<s> I have yet to fit an 8X only card. </s>

<s> Just make sure the AGP card you choose/install is based on 1.5V. </s>
<s> Older AGP cards were 3.0V. </s>
