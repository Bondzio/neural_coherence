i'd like to get a nook hd - love the screen resolution and i do a lot of reading.
it seems to have less glare than the nexus 7&quot; tablet.
but, i can't figure out how to get files from my camera onto the nook without doing it via computer.
when i'm on the road, i don't want to take the computer, i want to take the nook.
the canon g1x camera uses a regular size sd card, and the nook hd as a micro sd card reader.
the camera does have a/v out and hdmi, which i could probably hook up to the nook via adapters but i don't know if the nook will be able to read the files or recognize them so i could save them onto the nook.
the nook has a proprietary usb cable which i could hook into a card reader/adapter, but again, i don't know if the software exists on the nook to recognize and manage the files.
any suggestions?
thanks.
