I took the hard drive out. Hooked it to an external connector and accessed it on my laptop. I ran several scans and they found the virus and deleted the affected files. Obviously that will not fix the damage to system files. So I have two options. 1. I can reformat the drive and reinstall windows and all her other stuff. Which I am fully capable of doing. The problem is she has alot of photos on the drive. I have tried accessing the photos using the same external method but access is denied. She had her laptop password protected. I know the password, I was the one who initialy set it up. Is there anyway I can get to the files to back them up before I format the drive? 2. My other option is to put the windows disc in the machine and boot to the disc. I hit R to run windows recover to try and repair the system files. When I do this I am prompted for a administrative password. I do not beleive this password is something I have ever set. The laptop is only 2 years old and I am the one who initially set it up. I know what passwords I used and none of them allow me run recovery. Is this a default pasword for toshiba or windows? I have 2 options to save her files but I am currently being blocked by two problems. I appreciate any help you can provide. Thank you again I am open to new ideas.

Type XP TAKE OWNERSHIP on google and that solves your access denied issue. What's left? Nothing I can find so I'll stop here. Bob
