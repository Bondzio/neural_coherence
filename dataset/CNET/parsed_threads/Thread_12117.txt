<s> We have a cable modem (roadrunner service) and can have up to 5 additional connections. </s>
<s> We tried a wireless router (asante friendlynet FR1104-G), but the signal strength seems only strong enough to reach one floor up or down from the router location. </s>
<s> The floors are concrete, and the walls are concrete/brick with metal frames. </s>
<s> Hardwiring from modem to other floors is a very last (and expensive) option. </s>
<s> Any other solutions? </s>
<s> someone wanted to know if they could string a Cat5 cable down the outside of a concrete building to extend their networks reach. </s>
<s> The concensus was positive. </s>
