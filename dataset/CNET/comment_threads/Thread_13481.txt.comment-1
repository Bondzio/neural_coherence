Hi, I want to upgrade memory in a Gateway 827GM.
It has one 512 MB PC3200 DDR-SDRAM stick in it.
I want to add one more stick to it.
On Newegg there is a wide variety of memory.
Is there much of a difference in memory and is there a certain manufacturer that I should be looking for?
Thanks............ Tom
