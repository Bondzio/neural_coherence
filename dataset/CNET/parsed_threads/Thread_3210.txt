<s> I just hooked up my Acer Netbook and I'm only going to use this to play and store MP3's. </s>
<s> Is it ok to uninstall the following: 1. </s>
<s> Microsoft Works (that's 567.00MB) 2. </s>
<s> Adobe Reader (that's 204.00MB) 3. </s>
<s> Windows Live Essentials (that's 120.00MB) 4. </s>
<s> How do I disable the warning that comes up when the computer is turned on saying my computer is not protected. </s>
<s> THANKS!!! </s>

<s> If you're ever going to be connected to the internet (whether it's to download music, or if you're connected to a router), then you want to do 2 things. </s>
<s> 1) get yourself an antivirus/ security program of sorts. </s>
<s> 2) never disable that warning, as this is the way that the operating system alerts you to possible threats. </s>
<s> That didn't answer my questions. </s>
<s> I am never going to use my netbook for the internet. </s>
<s> I don't need any type of security. </s>
<s> Like my lap top, I only use that to watch movies and create text files at work. </s>
<s> on your netbook is the same as any other computer. </s>
<s> 1) Start-Control Panel-Programs-Uninstall a Program. </s>
<s> 2) Start-Control Panel-Security-User Account Control (turn on or turn off) </s>
<s> So, it's safe to uninstall program #'s 1., 2. and 3.??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Uninstalling Works is safe. </s>
<s> But do it only if you don't use any of its components. </s>
<s> Uninstalling Adobe Reader is safe. </s>
<s> But don't do it if you expect to use this netbook for an occasional reading of pdf-files. </s>
<s> http://download.live.com/ tells what programs are part Windows Live essentials. </s>
<s> If you don't use them, it's safe to install them. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Thanks for the info!!!! </s>
<s> I don't see any programs that I need to use that are included in Windows Essentials. </s>
