1.1.1	Im looking at buying a AMD I see the athlons are more expensive then the semprons but are they that much better ?	Ques
1.1.2	thx	St
1.2.1	if its only for basic word processing , surfing the net , instant messaging , email , etc .	St
1.2.2	then the sempron will do fine .	St
1.2.3	and it depends ... if u get the low end athlon 3000+ or 3200+ , there probably wont be much difference between those and the semprons .	St
1.2.4	however when u go higher , there is definitely a difference .	St
1.3.1	alot of photoshop , how much difference when you go higher then 3000 or 3200	St
1.4.1	These days , my low end is the AMD Athlon 64 3500+ .	St
1.4.2	Price is good .	Polite
1.4.3	If the budget is not so tight , my preference is a dual core CPU .	St
1.5.1	If you are going to do gaming and photoshop , then the Sempron or low end AMD will not help you there .	St
1.5.2	I agree that a dual core cpu is the best way for you to go .	St
1.5.3	If you ca n't go dual core , I suggest you get an AMD 64 3500+ or a 3700+ .	St
