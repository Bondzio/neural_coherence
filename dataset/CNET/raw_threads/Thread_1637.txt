I recently installed a new dvd burner into my system and while it does a good job of making backups the speed leaves something to be desired. When it first starts to burn it will go up to 3x speed but quickly drop then level off to around 1.6. Doesnt matter if its DL discs or single layer, and I have tried different brands of media. I did change it from being the slave drive to the master on the second ide but it didnt change anything at all. Here is all the info that I can think of that might be useful Programs used:dvd decrypter and dvd shrink DVD burner: BenQ 1640 CD-R: 48X CD-ROM Access Time: 120ms CD-RW: 32X DVD+R: 16X DVD+R DL: 8X DVD+RW: 8X DVD-R: 16X DVD-ROM Access Time: 120ms DVD-RW: 6X computer: 750mb ram, 2.6 pentium, 40gb ibm drive. could it be the hd? i think it is my systems weakest link.

What I Use: Nero Ultra 6.6 software will run a burn simulation to test the media at a selected speed before burning. The downside--it's expensive.

It is possible that even if it is, the drive only supports DMA33 which will limit transfer speeds and subsequently write speeds. Did you buy the drive new or used? Did it come with any type of burning program with it?

The media I have been using is Verbatim 6x for the dl discs and tdk for the single layer discs. Both burn at 1.6x I tried memorex but they were junk discs.

Check out whether or not for some reason the drives speed has been reduced from it's rated speed. Other than that you can check out a few websites (cdfreaks comes to mind) where you can check out the rated write speeds of various discs. Some are rated for a much higher speed than they will ever attain.
