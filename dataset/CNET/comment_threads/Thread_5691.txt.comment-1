Currently i have this configuration for my desktop: Intel P915GAV mobo Pentium 4 3.0 GHz 1.5 GB DDR RAM 1 x 320 GB 7200rpm HDD GeForce 6200 TC GPU 1 x DVD-RW 1 x DVD-Rom (Optical Drives are connected via Y-cable splitter (power)) 500W Power Supply I'm planning to upgrade my GPU to a GeForce 7900GS and ADD another 320 GB HDD... both these need to be directly connected to the power supply, meaning i'm going to use another 2 Y-cable splitter for them.
is my power supply going to handle all these?
And i am a heavy computer user... 24x7 use of PC and maybe an 8 hour rest every week or two...
