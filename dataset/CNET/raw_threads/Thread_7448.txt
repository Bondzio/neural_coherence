Hi, I have an old HP laptop that is running Win98 that I would like to hook up to my home theater system. What I would like to do is xfer my mp3 files from my XP Home (SP2) desktop to my laptop, but I'm not sure how to do it. The desktop only has CD/DVD R/W drives, the laptop only has a floppy drive,and it does not have a network card. It's a real basic laptop with serial, parallel and ps2 ports on it. I just remembered that I had the laptop and thought I could use it to store all my music files and easily hook up to my stereo system. I'm a novice at this but am able to follow clear instructions. If anyone can tell me if this is possible without having to spend a lot of money in parts and software, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!
