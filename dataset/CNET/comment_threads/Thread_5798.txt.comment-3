If you look at the link I posted, that scanner acts as a wand as well as a dock and I exactly need these 2 features.
Otherwise there are literally tons of scanners with feeder only option like Fujitsu S1100 or Neat Receipts on cheaper side.
In my use, sometimes I will have to feed the documents (little crumpled) and sometimes I will have to scan them with wand (book or magazine, edges taken into account).
Hence the one mentioned in original post.
The link you posted doesn't have any of the type I need but are wand only or feeder only.
I tried wand only but did not work for crumpled but neat worked pretty well.
So preferring 2-in-1 type scanner.
