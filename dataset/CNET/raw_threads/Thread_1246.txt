I have build my system back in the days on Pentium4 but never with current generation processors. I have a basic idea but nervous with some aspects. 1. Does a core i7 (940 or 965 extreme) need an aftermarket giant cooler unless I overclock it? 2. Do I need to apply a thermal paste for these processors or can it be safe without it as well? Thank you.

Some heat sinks come with a thermal pad that softens and flows when heat is first generated. You don't add paste to these. You either trust them to be adequate or remove them and apply your own thermal treatment.

And go for one that installs with something other than the standard Intel method ...sometimes they pop loose and you'll never know until your system starts overheating. If you want to see the difference in HS Fan cooling ...including the Intel or AMD stock HS Fans...go to http:/www.Frostytech.com. Last, if you go with an aftermarket cooler ...the question about thermal compound is mute. Some come with pre-installed pads and others require you to apply thermal compound separately Let us know which direction you go. VAPCMD
