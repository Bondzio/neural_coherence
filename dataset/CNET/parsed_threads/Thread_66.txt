<s> Okay, so I know little about the inner workings of PC's, but I'd like to upgrade mine. </s>
<s> Basically all I want is to be able to play most games without slowdown and the like. </s>
<s> I currently have an eMachines E4028, and was wondering what sort of upgrades would be suitable. </s>
<s> I have tried looking at graphics cards, but I just get confused. </s>
<s> Someone has offered me an 'XFX PV-T34K-NAHG 5200 NVIDIA AGP' graphics card, but apparently I already have 128mb in onboard graphics? </s>
<s> Oh, and I am on a budget, being a student! </s>
<s> If anyone could help I'd seriously appreciate it. </s>
<s> Cheers, James </s>
<s> I didn't find it on the US emachine site. </s>

<s> I'm in the UK. </s>
<s> I didn't actually realise this was a US site! </s>
<s> Is this a problem for me? </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Open the case and tell me which slots are open and what type. </s>
<s> See this for pictures. </s>

<s> no graphics upgrade will be worth it compared to the built-in gma900 graphics. </s>
<s> a pci graphics card might be a little bit better but certainly won't handle games like fear, doom, call of duty, etc. </s>
<s> &quot;without slowdown&quot;. </s>
<s> If you can find it, the PCI version of the 256MB FX5700 is worth doing. </s>
<s> Many games will be &quot;ok.&quot; Bob </s>
