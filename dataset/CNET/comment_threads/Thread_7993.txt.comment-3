its not the same mobo.
the 827gm has intel integrated graphics or dat is what it says at circuitcity http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Gateway-Desktop-PC-827GM-/sem/rpsm/oid/120108/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do although dat is surprising as i thought intel only made mb for their processors.
emachines t6212 uses a msi ati x200 chipset.
