you indicated you used the wizard to configure your home network.
so i assume you set up the internet connection sharing and etc already.
did you also go into your internet explorer &quot;options&quot; and change your &quot;connection&quot; settings on your &quot;slave&quot; machine?
if not, go into your internet &quot;properties&quot; and under the &quot;connections&quot; tab there should be some radio buttons.
select the one that says &quot;never dial a connection.&quot; this should disable the modem.
if your connection does not work after this, you may want to try to &quot;setup&quot; your connection again.
and when you do this choose the option to use your lan connection.
the wizard should walk you through it.
