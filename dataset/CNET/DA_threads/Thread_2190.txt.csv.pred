1.1.2	this pc with xp home sp3 with these speakers that are 8yrs+ has basic audigy sound card and videologic ZXR500 5:1 speakers /stats below Output power : Total 65W RMS ; fronts , rears and centre 8W RMS ; subwoofer 25W RMS Input sensitivity : 350 mV Frequency response : Amplifier 20 Hz to 20kHz SUBWOOFER Power output : 25W RMS ... ... .SATELLITE SPEAKERS Power output : 8W RMS each sound is great ... well at least it is really loud .	St
1.1.3	my other pc also xp home sp3 has no sound card but is asus mobo P5B DELUXE WI-FI with onboard sound via SOUND MAX New speakers are the highly rated LOGITECH X-540 5:1 ... stats below Technical Specifications o Total RMS power : 70 watts RMS Satellites : 45 watts RMS ( 2 x 7.4W front , 15.4W centre , 2 x 7.4W rear ) Subwoofer : 25 watts RMS o Total peak power : 140 watts o Frequency response : 40 Hz - 20 kHz sound is poor better if use stereo rubbish in surround and volume is half that of the videologic sys .

1.1.4	Question : Is it the speakers that are poor or do i need to get a sound card thanks reptile1	St
1.2.1	Best thing , get a reasonable sound card chances are that will make a LOT of difference .	St
1.2.2	The Logitech speakers are pretty fair , all considered but it sounds as if you audio ( internal ) is insufficient to the task.Sound cards are fairly cheap , best of luck !	St
1.2.3	!	St
1.3.1	thanks Phil It was the on board sound drivers by sound max I swapped speakers over which with all the cabling was a real pain but logitech works fine on the other sys that uses realteck and put the audigy sound card in this pc Now everone is happy .	St
