<s> hey everyone, i have a computer that is not working and i have no idea what to do. </s>
<s> i was mad the other day so i kicked the computer. </s>
<s> not hard or anything just enough to put a smll dent in it. </s>
<s> its a hp desktop. </s>
<s> it doesnt have the orig hard drive in it or ram. </s>
<s> when turned on both the hard drives click like crazy and it will not boot. </s>
<s> im not sure if it boots or not since no video is showing on the moniter it just says video cable connected? </s>
<s> so i dont know if it boots or not. </s>
<s> it has onboard video. </s>
<s> i have a 40G HDD in it and an 80G HDD in it. </s>
<s> they both click like hell when started. </s>
<s> opened on of then up and the disk spins but after a while of the arm moving back and forth while clicking it stops spinning. </s>
<s> i tapped it a few times and now it will continue spinning until i shut it off. </s>
<s> are these hard drives shot? </s>
<s> i mean i know there probly shot there old, but can i get files off of them and what not? </s>
<s> if it is the just video will these drives even boot like that? </s>
<s> im putting in a pci/agp video card later to see if that is the problem. </s>
<s> these HDDs are formatted with windows xp, can i put these in my g4 mac to get files off of? </s>
<s> or do i need to put them in a windows computer to back up? </s>
<s> A kick that dents a PC case isn't a small one and opening a hard drive to troubleshoot it is an almost certain kiss of death. </s>
<s> I'd say to evaluate the damage and see what's salvageable you'd need to do such one component at a time using another PC to test them. </s>
<s> I doubt you're clicking hard drives are going to be recognizable on any PC, however. </s>
<s> There are data recovery services available. </s>
<s> I can't say how much they charge but it may be more then the cost of an entire PC and with no guarantee of complete success. </s>
<s> If you have another PC that can handle the same components that is the way to go. </s>
<s> I do that often but just be carefull one bad component can do other damage to your system. </s>
<s> If the computer did not get kicked on the side the MB is on it might not be that bad. </s>
<s> Cables would be the first thing I would check Then The CPU or check for a cracked MB. </s>
<s> It take a bit to damage a HD. </s>
<s> Key components 1) MB 2) CPU If Those Components or OK the PC is repairable </s>
<s> the computer got kicked in the front with the cd drive getting most of the damage. </s>
<s> MB was removed as well as CPU the whole thing was cleaned. </s>
<s> runs perfect. </s>
<s> no damage at all except for the cd drive. </s>
<s> both hard drives recognize in the bios but neither will boot. </s>
<s> i brought them in to a local computer place and they tested them and said that they were none responsive and shot, but i dont belive this as it was a free test, nd they were trying to get me to spend money so that they could do further tests. </s>
<s> the drives are not unresponsive since they recognize in the computer. </s>
<s> i just need to repair the OS with the disk. </s>
<s> i put them in a really old pc i have and it said disk boot failure insert disk. </s>
<s> the disk i had wouldnt work i think i burned it wrong, and this pc could not have two hard drives for some reason as it would start for a second and shut off and then when i unplpugged one of them it would start. </s>
<s> so idk its weird but im working on it. </s>
<s> i think what i will do is get a sata controller and use a 320 notebook hdd in it. </s>
<s> and of course upgrade to maybe 1gb of ram from 512mb </s>
