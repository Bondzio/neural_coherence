The cost and engineering effort would scare off most folk.
Way back when I made my own Bluetooth to RS232 device and can share a picture.
But today it's cheaper to buy said thing.
In this case, you either dive in to make it or buy it.
No one should offer to put a course in electronics and programming in this small text box.
