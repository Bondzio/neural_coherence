i am trying to network 5 computers running windows xp pro.
i am attempting to connect them through a dlink switch.
i can't get the computers to see or access the other computers.
i have run the network set-up wizard many times.
i have tried creating a new connection.
i have tried with static ip and dynamic.
i have gone in and enabled netbios over tcp/ip in the connection properties.
i have setup several other networks sucessfully and have no idea what i am doing wrong.
any help will be appreciated.
