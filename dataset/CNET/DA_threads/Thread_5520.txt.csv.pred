1.1.1	Hello all , I have the ThermalTake 760i BIgWater cooling system on my PC , and have been keeping an eye on operating temps recently .	St
1.1.2	In an air-conditioned room , it seems to idle around 46C , and under high load can get into the high 60'sC .	St
1.1.3	This seems a bit high to me compared to what other people with liquid cooling , some even with high-perf .	St
1.1.4	fans , have been reporting .	St
1.1.5	Does this sound like an indication of a failing/failed pump to anyone ?	Ques
1.2.1	It wo n't do any good to compare if the systems are different in any way .	St
1.2.2	Also , that includes the s/w load and/or pgms .	St
1.2.3	being run on a constant basis .	St
1.2.4	About the only thing you can do is verify the overall install of the cooling apparatus is done proper .	St
1.2.5	The cooling temps offered are still a local PC ( inside ) measurement and can vary .	St
1.2.6	On top of all this the general PC make-up can provide for better cooling to include wire harness ( tidiness ) , cards installed , mtrbd .	St
1.2.7	bios updates , location of PSU , ram types ( cooling fins ) , and even the drives installed ( multiple ) .	St
1.2.8	If the PC works on a steady platform for whatever use , is n't the cooling good enough ?	Ques
1.2.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I agree ... pretty warm for idle with a decent HS Fan .	St
1.3.2	Have you double checked the installation or contacted the mfg tech support for suggestions ?	Ques
1.3.3	Sure the temp device is accurate and working OK ?	Ques
1.3.4	I 'm running an i860 with a Xigmatec HS Fan ... at idle it 's 30c or less at at load it barely reaches 50c .	St
1.3.5	Ambient temp is 73f .	St
1.3.6	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	To answer your question ; a little more information is needed , as to what your system specs are , and how long you 've been using the Big Water system .	St
1.4.2	With these specifics , then we can answer your question a little easier .	St
1.4.3	I 've seen over the last couple of years ; that the Big Water system did n't get many great reviews , seems people found that it cool any better than a high performance air cooler ( many found that the pump was made too cheaply and it did tend to fail ) I found an older review of the Big Water system http : //www.legitreviews.com/article/680/7/ & lt ; i & gt ; & quot ; What the test shows is that yes , it can fit in a mid tower , but you will have to play with the arrangement in the case so the radiator gets a good source of air in order to be an effective cooler .	St
1.4.4	If you are gathering parts for a new build I would look at a full tower over a mid .	St
1.4.5	If you choose to go the mid tower route you are going to want a blow hole .	St
1.4.6	& quot ; & lt ; /i & gt ; Another question ... when was the last time you cleaned and flushed the system out ; meaning take all the tubing , the waterblock , the radiator/ pump flush with distilled water , then refill with new coolant ( watercooling a vehicle and a computer is not as different as people think , but all systems need a good flushing/ refilling once a year or so ) .	St
1.5.1	Hi there , im having the same problem .	St
1.5.2	Im new to using watercooling components .	St
1.5.3	I 've bought the set from a friend of mine for a very low price .	St
1.5.4	Here is my setup : Gigabyte GA EP45-DS3P Intel q9550 45nm rev E0 @ 3.7 ghz @ 1.3v 4x2gb OCZ Gold ( 2x2gb set ) @ 1.9v Coolermaster Silent pro 700W Thermaltake 760i ( i 've re-routed the thermaltake setup for optimal cooling .	St
1.5.5	The pump has been connected to the rad ( has been placed on the bottom of my case ) , the rad to the proc , proc to the res and then to the pump .	St
1.5.6	( Pump and res in my 5,25 bay ) .	St
1.5.7	I 've even placed my fan of the scythe mugen II proc cooler for pull on other side of rad .	St
1.5.8	Idle 33-38c Load 58-71c Ca n't push my system further because i dont want to reach such high temps .	St
1.5.9	How can i flush my system with water ?	Ques
1.5.10	Is it possible that the cooling block is stuffed with dirt of some kind ?	Ques
1.5.11	He said he was n't using it for 6 months to a year now .	St
1.5.12	Ive blown on the ends of the waterblock to get it cleared before ive installed it .	St
1.5.13	Ive replaced it with new cooling fluid ( feser one ) .	St
1.5.14	Maybe you guys can help ?	Ques
1.5.15	Thanks in advance !	St
1.6.1	The last time I saw something like this the owner was adamant that heat sink compound was optional because of how well the surfaces mated .	St
1.6.2	We had to let them pack it up and go .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Your suggesting that i dont use cooling paste ?	Ques
1.7.2	I Dont understand .	St
1.7.3	pls explain .	Sug
1.8.1	I am adding to the discussion in hopes you will give more details .	St
1.8.2	Something seems amiss so small details might have folk write & quot ; try this ! & quot ; Bob	St
