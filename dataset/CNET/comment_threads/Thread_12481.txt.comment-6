I bought a $20 USB mic, plugged it in, and it works great!
Audigy 2 zs still being used for playback.
Only thing I can't get USB mic to work with is with the &quot;speakerphone&quot; cabalities of my modem.
This is probably a different issue, however.
Mic works great with sound recorder, and all other programs using voice input.
