<s> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/857/midiconnections.jpg/ i have never seen such an adapter sold anywhere. </s>
<s> i also have a 15 pins similar looking keyboard. </s>
<s> is there any other way to power this midi keyboard? </s>
<s> I'm seeing a MIDI Keyboard on a 15 pin connector. </s>
<s> While PCs of yore did use this for a game port and Creative Labs put MIDI signals on said connections this is not a game port. </s>
<s> There are no signals on this for the old PC Analog Game sticks. </s>
<s> Power to most MIDI Keyboards are to a power connection and not one I've seen in 2 decades took power from the 15 pin MIDI port. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface notes the 1980 time frame, and how PC sound cards put the MIDI signal onto the game port on the sound cards of the day. </s>
<s> It can be confusing at first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so what is the solution here. </s>
<s> Sorry but your post might be incomplete. </s>
<s> Maybe you found this keyboard (no make or model?) </s>
<s> or you lose the adapter. </s>
<s> I can't guess but I do know MIDI and a little more about it than I should (because I designed a MIDI card years ago.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i bought this keyboard with a piano teaching software for about $200 from a company called &quot;jump music&quot;. </s>
<s> so this keyboard doesn't have a model number. </s>
<s> if you wanna see a pic of it, here it is. </s>
<s> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/542/0000047.jpg/ it runs entirely thru the 15 pins cable which should be connected to the 15 pins joystick port on an old version of computer. </s>
<s> We'll need a manual with the pinout but your picture had a power brick in view. </s>
<s> BUT! </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=jump+music+piano+discovery is a gold mine of tales and stories about this unit. </s>
<s> It appears it did go to the old Creative Labs sound card. </s>
<s> &quot;100% Sound BlasterTM 16 compatible sound card&quot; Connect the keyboard to that and it will power up. </s>
<s> If you are able to do the wiring, then look at the Sound BlasterTM 16 pinout of the 15 pin jack and there is your information. </s>
<s> If you can't do this with this info, then this may be just out of your tech zone. </s>
<s> Here's the pin - out. </s>
<s> http://www.epanorama.net/documents/joystick/pc_circuits.html contains the pin-out and notice that it's 5 Volts on many pins and GND on the others. </s>
<s> Apply power and ground to these. </s>
<s> http://www.noteworthysoftware.com/nwcforum/558.htm shows this has been discussed before. </s>
<s> Unless you find the manual, you have to consider it's end has come. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i suppose that buying a sound card with a game port is the only solution now. </s>
<s> do you know any places that sell an adapter for 15 pins plugin? </s>
<s> If you are going to plug this into the supported Creative Labs SB16 with the combo MIDI and GAME PORT why wouldn't use the cables the keyboard came with? </s>
<s> did you see the pic link that i posted in my first message? </s>
<s> my keyboard uses only a game port for power, and as you know the all the new computers don't have the game port on them any more. </s>
<s> so i can't use the keyboard any more. </s>
<s> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/857/midiconnections.jpg/ I see the cable there. </s>
<s> Remember you have 3 or more discussions going on with what I can only guess is 2 per cent of the story. </s>
<s> Let me part with this. </s>
<s> This is over a decade old so you may have to scrounge up the remaining parts if you lost them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i have everything, the cable, the keyboard, the software, the only thing that i don't have is the game port on the computer. </s>
<s> While Creative Labs did put MIDI on the DB15 of the SB16 card, no game controls are in play here. </s>
<s> You'll confuse those less in the know by asking for a game port for your PC. </s>
<s> And we can't talk about adding the SB16 since, and I may have missed it where you told all about your PC. </s>
<s> To get this put to rest, you have to tell at least what the words in red ask when you post. </s>
<s> --&gt; Also, why not use the old machine since the software is not known to run on today's machines. </s>
