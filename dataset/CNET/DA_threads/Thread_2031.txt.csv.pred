1.1.1	Hi all , I have a Mac Pro running dual Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors .	St
1.1.2	I use two displays , an Apple 30 & quot ; cinema display and a 27 & quot ; display , which I use side-by-side .	St
1.1.3	Recently , my 27 & quot ; display has been having difficulties that are reminiscent of the special effects used in the Matrix movies when the character is dodging bullets - when moving an open document or window on the 27 & quot ; display , it suddenly begins leaving a trail of ghost images behind that completely muck up the screen .	St
1.1.4	Generally , I can correct the problem by grabbing another open document and moving it all over the screen - in effect using it to & quot ; wash & quot ; away all the duplicate images .	St
1.1.5	I 'm trying to figure out if this is a problem that can be easily corrected ( perhaps a memory or cache issue ) vs. some sort of fatal hardware or video card issue .	St
1.1.6	I have a screenshot of this , but I 'm a newbie to this forum and unsure if I can easily link it to my post .	St
1.1.7	I 'd be grateful for advice with this problem .	St
1.2.1	Given the machine story so far can you reveal how long since you did the usual canned air on the heatsinks ( maintenence ) ?	Ques
1.2.2	I find many users never do that .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your reply , Bob .	Polite
1.3.2	I realized that I have four video cards in this machine , so I switched that display to one of the other cards and it seemed to solve the problem .	St
1.3.3	Regarding the heat sinks , I recently vacuumed out the the entire unit , but prior to doing so , it had accumulated a lot of dust .	St
1.3.4	Poor maintenance might have overheated my video card prior to the recent cleaning..	St
1.3.5	Regards , Jim	St
