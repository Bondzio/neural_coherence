11478	4	58817	699315	698876	TONI H	1/20/05 5:32 AM	1.10619912E12	the data files that I have	are all my backups of my home mpg and avi movies....I was wondering if I have NTSC and am copying the data files to another dvd media to send to my relatives overseas and they use PAL, will they be able to convert my data files to PAL so they can view them in a dvd player there since the two dvd players are from two different regions? TONI

11478	6	58817	699700	699344	TONI H	1/20/05 8:49 AM	1.10621094E12	OK...I'm hoping they will also play in	their home dvd player........thanks. TONI
