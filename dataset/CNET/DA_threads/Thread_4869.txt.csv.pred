1.1.1	Hello , I am building a system and I am not sure what motherboard to buy .	St
1.1.2	I am thinking about getting an intel motherboard Core i7 .	St
1.1.3	I am not sure which motherboard to go for .	St
1.1.4	To give you a better Idea .	St
1.1.5	I do n't play games .	St
1.1.6	I need a computer for music production .	St
1.1.7	Here are a few that I have been looking at EVGA ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813188039 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813188046 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ?	Ques
1.1.8	Item=N82E16813188049 ) Any others you might recommend ?	Ques
1.1.9	Should I go AMD Route ?	Ques
1.1.10	Realistically , I do n't want to spend over $ 200 if possible , but if people are for the EVGA then I might just do it .	St
1.1.11	Thank you very much for your time	St
1.2.1	are considerably more expensive than Socket 775 systems .	St
1.2.2	Not sure the extra $ $ gives proportionate increase in performance for most .	St
1.2.3	Core i7 MBs start at $ 200 and go to $ 400 and the CPUs start about $ 275 unless you live near a MicroCenter where they 're sometimes on sale for $ 200 .	St
1.2.4	Here 's a socket 775 MB with decent rating from buyers.and it 's $ 115 after rebate .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813128358 VAPCMD	Ques
1.3.1	Do you think it is better to go to a DDR3 motherboard than a DDR2 ?	Ques
1.3.2	I use music producing software and I need to make sure I can use this with out my computer bogging down .	St
1.3.3	When it comes to CPU 's it does n't have to be the Core i7 , I will consider the ones before that as long as my computer can handle my music production software , so it does n't bogg down my computer .	St
1.3.4	Then I am fine .	St
1.3.5	Is Gigabyte Motherboard the way to go ?	Ques
1.3.6	Asus ?	Ques
1.3.7	EVGA ?	Ques
1.4.1	Hello , I am building a new system and I am not sure which route to take in terms of which motherboard , processor etc .	St
1.4.2	Here is some info on what I am building a computer for ... I am building this computer for music production and not gaming .	St
1.4.3	Software I use is FL Studio and Protools as well as plugging in instruments to the computer for recording .	St
1.4.4	I need a computer system that wo n't bogg down when I have all these softwares and plug-ins open .	St
1.4.5	I would like to get the Core i7 processor , but not sure if I should go for it or not .	St
1.4.6	Should I go the AMD Route ?	Ques
1.4.7	It seems more affordable to go for the AMD Route .	St
1.4.8	If I go with the AMD I am thinking about this http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103674 Then comes to the motherboard .	St
1.4.9	I am really not sure which one to decide on .	St
1.4.10	Here are a few brands I have been looking at are EVGA , Gigabyte and ASUS .	St
1.4.11	What about other brands like Intel , Foxconn , MSI , DFI ?	Ques
1.4.12	When it comes to memory should I stick with DDR2 or DDR3 ?	Ques
1.4.13	I have some wish list categories .	St
1.4.14	Jeff 's Computer Build = Stuff I already have and purchased { http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=8883254 } Jeff 's Future Build = Stuff I am thinking about buying .	St
1.4.15	{ http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=11217152 } Other Case Considerations = Other cases I am thinking about .	St
1.4.16	{ http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=10509211 } So , I still need Motherboard , Processor , Sound Card , Memory .	St
1.4.17	I am looking to spend $ 500 more , but no more than $ 600 .	St
1.4.18	Few notes : For the Case , I am leaning towards the Azza Solano 1000 and for the Video card I bought from Best Buy the VisionTek HD 4350 ATI Radeon Video Card , should I keep or upgrade it ?	Ques
1.4.19	For Sound card people have recommended M-Audio an EMU for music production , What do you guys think ?	Ques
1.4.20	Thank you very much for your time	St
1.5.1	OK , so a quick Google search on ProTools and FL Studio show that they are multi-threaded , but , to be perfectly honest , they do n't go into a lot of detail .	St
1.5.2	It was literally one line in FL Studios feature list and a few forum posting describing multi-threaded-ness on ProTools .	St
1.5.3	So , I would definitely get a quad , but I think you knew that already .	St
1.5.4	The part I 'm debating is AMD/Intel quad .	St
1.5.5	From my research , ProTools seems to work rather nicely with i7 's , with a certain bench ( Dverbs , if you 've heard of it ) it gets twice the score than a Q6600 .	St
1.5.6	If I were you , I would go i7 .	St
1.5.7	But , realize , you 'll need DDR3 .	St
1.5.8	Core i7 can ONLY take DDR3 , no DDR2 here .	St
1.5.9	For the best performance with i7 , we do want triple-channel memory .	St
1.5.10	I 'm not fully versed on the performance benefits from double to triple-channel , but the prices are close enough and i7 has a memory controller built for triple-channel , so why go slower ?	Ques
1.5.11	And , like I said , prices are close .	St
1.5.12	Do you plan to overclock ?	Ques
1.5.13	If so , I would go for one of those cases .	St
1.5.14	But if you are n't , you do n't *NEED* the cooling that those cases give and a cheaper case will suffice .	St
1.5.15	But , here 's the rub .	St
1.5.16	The cheapest i7 is $ 280 .	St
1.5.17	An i7 motherboard will run you $ 200 or more , a few dipping into the high 100 's .	St
1.5.18	Memory ( 6GB , triple channel ) will be another $ 100 .	St
1.5.19	If you 're counting right , we 're at $ 580 and we have n't even bought the sound card , which sounds pretty important considering the tools you 're using .	St
1.5.20	We can dip down into Intel quad 's or AMD 's quads , but the i7 may be a bit out of your price range .	St
1.5.21	Both AMD/Intel quads are great .	Polite
1.5.22	AMD has cheaper motherboards and are a little more overclocking friendly , but Intel 's quads are faster per-clock than AMDs .	St
1.5.23	A 3.2GHz AMD ( Phenom II 955 ) is a bit slower than the Q9650 ( 3.0GHz ) .	St
1.5.24	Research your tools a bit , see what other people are using them with .	St
1.5.25	Some tools , unfortunately , are highly biased to one architecture or another .	St
1.5.26	See if there are any anomalies there .	St
1.5.27	Good luck !	Polite

1.7.2	Your i7 MB is going $ 200- $ 300 ... . $ 250- $ 275 for the CPU ... .. $ 100 for the RAM and then there 's the video card .	St
1.7.3	Re Win7 ... what are planning to use 'til it becomes avialable ?	Ques
1.7.4	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	Thank you very much for your reply .	St
1.8.2	Affordability and espcially I am not a gamer , I am really leaning towards AMD Phenom , what I mentioned in my post .	St
1.8.3	I do n't plan on overclocking .	St
1.8.4	Here is my First Mock Build and can be subjected to change .	St
1.8.5	Case wise , I am still deciding on the Azzan and Antec 1200. http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=11224712 Let me know your thoughts on the build so far .	St
1.8.6	As for Memory , what about these what do you think of the Mushkin hp ?	Ques
1.8.7	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [ ... ] 6820146868 OCZ http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [ ... ] 6820227381 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [ ... ] 6820227365 What about the AuzenTech AZT-FORTE X-Fi Forte 7.1 Low Profile PCI Express Sound Card compared to EMU 's , Creative Labs and M-Audio ?	Ques
1.9.1	Thanks for the links , Ramarc .	St
1.9.2	Now only a bit more so I do n't feel bad about buying one for me , lol !	St
1.9.3	I just built an AMD Phenom system last week , though it was the dual-core version : Phenom II X2 550 , 3.1GHz .	St
1.9.4	Thing absolutely roared ; and for the price ?	Ques
1.9.5	Heck yes .	Res
1.9.6	Build looks great , though I might make a few changes : The 955 is the fastest Phenom available , true , but you 're definitely paying quite a premium for it .	St
1.9.7	If it were up to me , I would go for the 940 .	St
1.9.8	It 's at 3.0GHz instead of the 955 's 3.2GHz .	St
1.9.9	But , it is still a Black Edition CPU , meaning it has an unlocked multiplier .	St
1.9.10	That means it is DEAD-simple to overclock .	St
1.9.11	I would get the Phenom II 940 , save $ 56 , go into your BIOS and change the multiplier from 15 to 16 .	St
1.9.12	BAM : you get a 955 for free .	St
1.9.13	I highly doubt you 'll have to do any voltage tweaks at all .	St
1.9.14	No need to fuss with memory multipliers or HTT multipliers : change one number and you 're golden .	St
1.9.15	I would personally change the RAM to this : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820148261 What do you get for an extra $ 5 ?	Ques
1.9.16	Tighter timings ( CAS6 versus CAS8 ) and cool lights !	St
1.9.17	Check out the video review in it 's review section .	St
1.9.18	CAS latency is n't a big performance gain , but it can help , especially in memory-intensive applications .	St
1.9.19	Not sure if yours falls under that .	Res
1.9.20	But , darn , those lights are too cool .	St
1.9.21	Now we HAVE to get a case with a window , lol !	St
1.9.22	The links you posted are truncated ; they 've been cut short .	St
1.9.23	Can you try pasting them again ?	Ques
1.9.24	I 'm the wrong guy to ask about sound cards : I use onboard and ca n't tell the difference since the day I threw out my Creative card .	St
1.9.25	I will tell you this , though : the X-Fi chipset is mainly targeted toward gamers and the like .	St
1.9.26	E-MU and M-Audio are targeted for professionals .	St
1.9.27	I 'd just go with the one that fits your budget AND ( more importantly ) has all the connections you 'll need .	St
1.9.28	And then some .	St
1.9.29	You realize these are full-towers , right ?	Ques
1.9.30	I have a Coolermaster Stacker 830 ( big boy , trust me ) and it 's huge .	St
1.9.31	Like , no mid-tower compares .	St
1.9.32	Just trust me .	St
1.9.33	Think big .	St
1.9.34	Then go two more steps .	St
1.9.35	That 's a full tower .	St
1.9.36	In my opinion , I 'd go with the AZZA .	St
1.9.37	Never heard of them , but it has good reviews .	St
1.9.38	You get a bigger side fan and it 's a whole lot cheaper .	St
1.9.39	And who does n't love 230mm fans ? !	Ques
1.9.40	Good luck !	Polite
1.9.41	~Ibrahim~	St
1.10.1	Hi Ibrahim , The links I have posted are working .	St
1.10.2	I am not sure if you tried clicking on them .	Res
1.10.3	Here they are again .	St
1.10.4	Jeff 's Computer Build = Stuff I already have and purchased { http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=8883254 } Jeff 's Future Build = Stuff I am thinking about buying .	St

1.10.6	{ http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=10509211 } Thank you for the CPU insight .	St
1.10.7	I will look into it .	St
1.10.8	Yeah , I realize it is a full tower case .	St
1.10.9	I measured it and yes it is larger than my mid tower , but the only difference is the height , which is 16 on my midtower and 22 on the full tower .	St
1.10.10	Yes it is taller , but still fits in my work space .	St
1.10.11	My mid tower is 20 is length or width what ever you call it and 8 inches from side to side .	St
1.10.12	On the ones I picked it is about the same as those dimensions .	St
1.10.13	Should work out ok .	St
1.10.14	If it turns out to be too big for my tastes , can I return to new egg with out a problem ?	Ques
1.10.15	I will check out as well .	St
1.10.16	Thank you again for your help .	St
1.10.17	Any thing else let me know .	Sug
1.10.18	I should have some questions in a bit .	St
1.11.1	I was actually referring to the RAM you linked me , but I still like the one 's I linked , unless you need a lower price ?	Ques
1.11.2	Oh , yeah .	Res
1.11.3	Newegg has a fantastic RMA program .	St
1.11.4	I 'd much rather deal with Newegg than a company .	St
1.11.5	I looked through the case choices again and I really like the AZZA .	St
1.11.6	The others are too expensive , IMO , for what you get , but I 'm not one to talk with a $ 220 case .	St
1.11.7	But the AZZA looks like it has the good stuff : removable mobo tray , good fans , nice exterior design .	St
1.11.8	It is n't tool-less , but I find the trusting reassurance of a tightened screw a bit more satisfying than the promise of wimpy plastic .	St
1.11.9	~Ibrahim~	St
1.12.1	Thank you once again .	St
1.12.2	Sweet .	St
1.12.3	I am going to get the Azza case .	St
1.12.4	Those RAM 's are for Intel motherboards , so I am no longer looking at those .	St
1.12.5	I thought about that too .	St
1.12.6	Yeah , Tooless is easier , but those thumb screws are not bad either .	St
1.12.7	So , this looks like my final build http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=11224712 .	St
1.12.8	I will make my final decision by the weekend for sure .	St
1.12.9	If you or anyone else has any recomendations please let me know .	Ques
1.12.10	Thanks again .	St
1.13.1	It looks good .	Polite
1.13.2	RAM , actually , is n't & quot ; for & quot ; a certain brand .	St
1.13.3	RAM will work as long as it has the same subsystem ( DDR2 , DDR3 , etc ) in any system .	St
1.13.4	Speeds do n't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo ( SPD ) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs .	St
1.13.5	Looks nice from my end .	St
1.13.6	~Ibrahim~	St
1.14.1	It looks like I will need to upgrade my operating system from XP Professsional to a 64 bit Operating System , so I can take full advantage of the memory .	St
1.14.2	Which one should I consider Windows XP Professional 64 bit Windows Vista Pro 64 bit Windows 7 RC 64 bit Thank you .	St
1.15.1	But the big issue for most is drivers .	St
1.15.2	In order from most lacking in my experience ( drivers from makers ) is this order .	St
1.15.3	1 .	St
1.15.4	( do n't expect drivers from maker ) Windows 7 RC 64 bit 2 .	St
1.15.5	( hit and miss support from makers ) Windows XP Professional 64 bit 3 .	St
1.15.6	( can usually find or get an answer about the driver ) Windows Vista Pro 64 bit After 7 ships you can	St
1.16.1	After 7 ships then you can ask the makers for drivers .	St
1.16.2	For now I 've found in many cases the Vista driver works ( if there is one . )	St
1.17.1	So , you think I should just upgrade to vista 64 then ?	Ques
1.18.1	And if you preorder the WIN7 upgrade now , it will only cost $ 99 .	St
1.18.2	VAPCMD	St

1.20.1	Thank you .	St
1.20.2	I am hoping to make a decsion on my system by the end of the weekend .	St
1.20.3	When you said : & quot ; Speeds do n't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo ( SPD ) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs. & quot ; How do you do that ?	Ques
1.20.4	How do you adjust the specs to get the actuals ?	Ques
1.21.1	I think I will order the discounted Windows 7 and download the Windows 7 64bit RC for free .	St
1.21.2	I wo n't do it until I check with my software specs to see if it can .	St
1.21.3	I hav n't had time to do it yet .	St
1.21.4	I wo n't count out the Windows Vista either .	St
1.21.5	I have to think about it further .	St
