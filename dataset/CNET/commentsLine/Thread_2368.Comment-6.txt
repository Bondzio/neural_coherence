same type of camera we are talking... but, the security camera thing that i mentioned is only an example of location.. unless you have a very fast connection, then you will have to deal with time delay... (a few second or so) any web cam (even regular video camera, provided that you have a video input/output jack in your pc) and msn, yahoo or other instant messages software can be use ... why don't you try to use it now and start video chat with your friend or family ..
