1.1.1	I 'll be up front , this is a question for homework help .	St
1.1.2	I 'm not asking for an answer ( that 'd be cheating ) , more like direction to where I can find an answer ( or if I 'm on the right track with my hunch ) .	St
1.1.3	I want to create a website but only allow a certain user or group of users access to that website .	St
1.1.4	Assuming that user or users will be from the same location , and likely the same static IP , can I throw a firewall between my internet connection and web server and only allow that specific IP address access to my web server by a rule ?	Ques
1.1.5	If there is a better way to handle that , I 'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction .	St
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	& quot ; the same location & quot ; is a problem .	St
1.2.2	Many people use a laptop or a tablet or iPod or smartphone with WiFi or 3G to browse the net .	St
1.2.3	And their IP-address is dependent on where they are .	St
1.2.4	I do n't even mention Internet cafe 's and such where you can use the internet on their machines after a paying a fee , or using a PC at work , school or with friends or family .	St
1.2.5	So that 's an assumption that only would be valid in a homework environment .	St
1.2.6	Assuming it dates from before the days of laptops and tablets and iPod and smartphones and 3G and 4G , even then an IP-address would n't have been useful , because back in the days of dial-up connections , all dial-up connections had a dynamic IP-address .	St
1.2.7	They gave you another address every time you dialled in .	St
1.2.8	And even then there was work and school and friends and family where that 'certain group of users ' could want to get access .	St
1.2.9	So any other way to handle this would be better than a way using the IP-address .	St

1.3.1	Thanks for the reply , Kees .	St
1.3.2	I was over-simplifying , I think .	St
1.3.3	My homework states that my company needs to receive blueprint files from a customer securely .	St
1.3.4	I was thinking using a secure website as an interface for the file transfer .	St
1.3.5	The customer would upload the files to the website and my company would retrieve the files .	St
1.3.6	I was assuming that since it was a company sending me the files , that it would be one IP address because they should upload them from their work , which I would think would have one static IP for all outgoing traffic .	St
1.3.7	My idea was to only allow the customer 's static IP to have access to the website .	St
1.3.8	I was thinking that the firewall rule would block all other IP addresses from accessing it .	St
1.3.9	Am I going about this in the entirely wrong way ?	Ques
1.3.10	My only experience with this sort of thing is that my ( real , current ) work receives marketing data from a vendor monthly , and the vendor has set up a website that we use to receive the files .	St
1.4.1	of the firewall ( software or appliance ) of your company to see if it supports blocking by IP-address .	St
1.4.2	I 'm rather sure ZoneAlarm Free 9.x ( that 's what I use at my home PC ) does n't .	St
