Even if i change contrast value from the monitor panel to 0%, i'm still unable to see the rectangles in the image from the link above. I tried uninstalling the driver (rolled back to microsoft default monitor) - the problem is persisting! I deleted the color profile &quot;LG...&quot; from color management, the problem is still there! how do i get the initial settings back? Same problem on both windows xp and 7.
