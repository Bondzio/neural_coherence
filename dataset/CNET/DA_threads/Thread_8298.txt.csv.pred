1.1.1	I had a computer program (Maxblast 3) that suggested my main HD was going bad.	St
1.1.2	I replaced the &quot;C&quot; Drive with a larger one.	St
1.1.3	I had to FDISK the new drive, then I reloaded the system Software - Win 2000.	St
1.1.4	The new OS works fine.	St
1.1.5	The second HD is now recognized as a FAT 16, 33GB drive though it was originally set-up as NTFS and has a Western Digital 250GB HD.	St
1.1.6	It seems that the FDISK command passed to both HDs, making the second one not usable.	St
1.1.7	Now what can I do?	St
1.1.8	I would prefer to not format the second HD - lots of data & picture files.	St
1.1.9	Is there a way that I can force the disk to be recognized as original??	St
1.1.10	Thanks in advance.	St

1.2.1	Windows 2000 has a native partitioning tool which you can upset by introducing DOS FDISK.	St
1.2.2	I would have booted the Windows 2000 CD and installed from that.	St
1.2.3	Natively.	St
