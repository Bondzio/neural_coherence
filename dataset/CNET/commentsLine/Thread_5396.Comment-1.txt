running xp media center, p4, 3ghz, 1gb ram, 256 ati radeon x1300 pro video card, psp x, gateway.
ok, when i am trying to work on pictures (can be 1 loaded into program or 50 pics)the system starts slowing down badly.
my other system is a slower computer and can fly through the pics (1gb ram, 128 video card).
i am just not sure why the faster system is slower, any help would be greatly appreciated.
