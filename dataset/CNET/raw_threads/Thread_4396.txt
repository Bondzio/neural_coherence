Everyone talks about top of the line processors and video cards, but we don't seem to &quot;hear&quot; (pun intended) as much about sound cards. So, now I'm asking you all--who's sound cards really rock? -JDM

Always been happy with them. I currently use an Audigy SoundBlaster Platinum. But no matter how good your soundcard, you can't neglect quality speakers. I have a relatively cheap set of Logitech 5.1 speakers (forget which model...Z something); cranked up, it rocks the walls. That said, I'm pretty impressed by some onboard sound on the newer motherboards. My daughter has a cheap Biostar motherboard, and the sound was so good, I didn't even bother to put a soundcard in- it supports 5.1 sound also. I've heard good things about M-Audio also; have one of their cards as a matter of fact, but never installed it. I don't think you can go wrong with Creative. I have the internal bay for input/headphones etc- I think I chose this card when it came out simply cuz I thought having a remote would be cool. It is, but I never use it, lol.

1452	11	99219	1142857	1141112	thecoolnessrune	4/21/05 2:10 PM	1.1140926E12	Chaintech second and Maya third	Of course the best setup I can think of is a Sound Blaster Audigy 4 with an optical cable connected to a home theatre. But I would have to say Chaintech makes a good second place. Followed by Maya.
