If I am using the maker's restore CDs some may require that special restore partition.
So I leave that alone.
However if I'm going all GURU and doing a CLEAN INSTALL OF XP (see google.com) then I'm using that Microsoft XP SP2 CD and supplying any and all drivers so I can thoroughly wipe out all partitions with DBAN or other tools.
