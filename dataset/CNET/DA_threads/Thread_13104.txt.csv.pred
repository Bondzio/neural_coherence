1.1.1	I 've got a Linksys WRT610N router .	St
1.1.2	I 've got it set up to broadcast in both 802.11g and 802.11n bands .	St
1.1.3	My house is n't large , so I would have thought that it would be a bit of a challenge for the 802.11g to reach the far ends of the house , but certainly not a problem for the 802.11n .	St
1.1.4	Boy , was I wrong !	St
1.1.5	I 've got a new Vizio Blu-ray player in my bedroom ( at the farthest end of the house from the WRT610N router ) .	St
1.1.6	It indicates the signal strength of both bands .	St
1.1.7	The 802.11g band is n't really strong , but that , to me , was n't a surprise .	St
1.1.8	What is a surprise is the 802.11n signal strength is significantly poorer .	St
1.1.9	Now , I thought that 802.11n was supposed to be better , stronger , reaching farther , etc .	St
1.1.10	What 's going on here ?	Ques
1.1.11	Why am I seeing what I 'm seeing ?	Ques
1.1.12	The 802.11n from my router is so poor I can not use it at all in bedroom , I have to use the 802.11g band , which , as I 've said , is n't very strong itself .	St
1.2.1	Welcome to the world of advertising and perfect laboratory conditions .	St
1.2.2	There are so many factors involved with signal strength and bit speed , it 's not worth describing .	St
1.2.3	In a nutshell , distance and obstructions are the determining factor .	St
1.2.4	In perfect laboratory conditions you will get 105 Mb/s .	St
1.2.5	Wo n't ever happen in the real world .	St
1.2.6	As most people do n't realize , higher frequencies can travel farther , but are more susceptible to interference and blocking .	St
1.2.7	Lower frequencies travel through most anything , but speed is affected .	St
1.2.8	Consider ULF ( ultra low frequency ) that the Navy uses to travel hundreds of miles under water , at a bit rate of about 10 .	St
1.2.9	The higher the frequency , the more obstructions ( walls ) interfere .	St
1.2.10	I do n't have an answer , sorry , except tear some walls down .	St
1.3.1	WOW , that makes sense .	St
1.3.2	Well , nuts , I 'm not sure what to do .	St
1.3.3	I wo n't be tearing down any of the walls .	St
1.4.1	I have a side business doing home networks and after having many of the same problems your having , I gave up on Linksys and started using Netgear N wireless routers .	St
1.4.2	I had used Linksys B & G routers for years without any problems , but once they started making them in that Pancake configuration , things seem to have gone downhill .	St
1.4.3	If you want duel band look at the Netgear WNR 3700 .	St
1.4.4	I have put several in without a problem .	St
1.4.5	I am sure there are other brands that work as well , but I stick with what works for me .	St
1.4.6	One thing I would like to add , no matter what brand you choose and it is at all possible , put the router in a central location on the main or middle floor .	St
1.5.1	I have a 3700+ and it runs 24x7 without much fuss .	St
1.5.2	However I have it setup per this forums top posts so maybe ?	Ques
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Really ?	Ques
1.6.2	I had n't thought about that .	St
1.6.3	I know that the antenna for those & quot ; pancake & quot ; Linksys routers is internal somehow .	St
1.6.4	So , you 're saying that the Netgear WNR 3700 is better , at both G and N bands ?	Ques
1.7.1	I just looked up that Netgear router that you mentioned , and see that I 've already seen it on CNET 's reviews ( http : //reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wndr3700-rangemax-dual/4505-3319_7-33485574.html ) .	St
1.7.2	They considered it to be very good , but on the negative side they said that the N-band performance & quot ; ... is disappointing. & quot ; Do you have that same experience ?	Ques
1.8.1	Plus I have yet to see any N deliver any better range or performance outside of the lab .	St
1.8.2	Go figure .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	I know that is is advertised as supporting duel band , but when I look at te specs for it vs. some other router ( like the Linksys E3000 ) it says that the Netgear WNR 3700 only supports , & quot ; IEEE 802.11n ( draft 2 ) & quot ; .	St
1.10.2	I 'm just wondering if the WNR 3700 , is old enough that it predates the 802.11n standard ?	Ques
1.10.3	And maybe it has been superseded either by an updated version of the WNR 3700 which supports the standard , rather than a draft , or if there 's a newer Netgear model to the WNR 3700 that supports the standard ?	Ques
1.11.1	If this is the current model or something from a discount store .	St
1.11.2	The reason I ask is at Netgear.com the wnr3700 is not found .	St
1.11.3	& quot ; No matching products found , please check the model number and retry. & quot ;	St
1.12.1	I 'm sorry , it is my mistake .	Polite
1.12.2	I left out a letter .	St
1.12.3	I meant WNDR3700 .	St
1.13.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wndr3700-rangemax-dual/4505-3319_7-33485574.html # reviewPage1 does not mention Draft N but I could have missed it .	St
1.13.2	The product page at Netgear.com notes & quot ; IEEE 802.11n version 2.0 & quot ; .	St
1.13.3	I can only guess where you read Draft versus & quot ; version. & quot ; Bob	St
1.14.1	NIL	St
1.15.1	It looks like we 're good ?	Ques
