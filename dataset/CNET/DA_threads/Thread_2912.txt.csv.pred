1.1.1	Re: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=39852&messageID=467204 Hey old buddy, New 450 watt PS ws delivered today.	St
1.1.2	Installed same, and my old odd noise is gone.	St
1.1.3	Of course this supply has 2 fans, so now listening to a bit more &quot;whoosh&quot; noise.	St
1.1.4	But this is totally acceptable, compared to what I had been hearing, so PS did fix my problem.	St
1.1.5	Just wanted to let you know.	St
1.2.1	and am happy for your quieter computing.	St
1.2.2	Here'sa link to a post by Robert Proffitt.	St
1.2.3	Keep it in mind if things recur.	St
1.2.4	The result of bad capacitors on a mobo can increase the magnitude of the noise [AC] current being absorbed by the caps in the power supply and eventually cause them to overheat and fail.	St
1.2.5	I am glad this his shop found this.	St
1.2.6	http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=40719&messageID=477534	St
1.3.1	may be of interest to some.	St
1.3.2	After removing old PS unit, popped the top, and found no bulging, or leaking electrolytics, but did see a resistor, about 2 watt job, that the coating, enamel, ceramic, I don't know, had fallen off in a little pile around the resistor.	St
1.3.3	Makes me guess the thing had been overheating.	St
1.3.4	Anyway, the note I wanted to make is that I scavenged the fan from the supply (ball bearing job), spliced in a connector from my pile of other dead things, and now have a new case fan.	St
1.3.5	LOL.	St
1.3.6	Actually this computer only came with a HSF, and the PS fan.	St
1.3.7	No case fans.	St
1.3.8	Wasn't running hot in the first place, about 30 degrees C, but now running at 26.	St
1.3.9	Icicles are starting to form.	St
1.3.10	LOL.	St
1.4.1	in the shop i used to work at i allways sallvaged all fans from ps and still do and use as case fans most run for ever	St
1.5.1	Sure sounds as if the resistor had been overheating, possibly localized lack of airflow near it, altough they can really run hot.	St
1.5.2	Wonder what it for.	St
1.5.3	Glad that there were no bad caps.	St
