who would want a windows tablet now?
well ok. if you want to shell out $1500 for a slate.
but for ipad level ( hardware/price point ) ms has spent a decade proving it can't do a good job in that arena.
maybe when win 8 has been out for a while, but not now.
as for ipad, given the hardware you will be overpaying.
what's the matter with android?
