If the lamp is illumintated, then all is well in the world and touching the button, which is touch sensitive, &quot;might&quot; turn the machine off.
I doubt that though as the ability to shut down from the keyboard has been removed from all Macs now.
You could try touching the button for some time and the machine &quot;might&quot; shut off but it is NOT a nice way to shut the machine down.
It's akin to yanking the powercord out.
You can do this on a G4 Cube.
If the machine is OFF, touching that button &quot;should&quot; turn the machine back on again.
Try it and see P
