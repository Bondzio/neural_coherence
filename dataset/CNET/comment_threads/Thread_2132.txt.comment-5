Hi Bob, I think I understand what samibytn is trying to accomplish.
Hot spot sheild is a VPN Client used to secure your Internet traffic.
What he would like to have happen is for the HotSpot Sheild VPN client to connect automatically upon system startup.
I would assume that he/she already has an active Internet connection and would just like to establish a connection to the VPN.
Samibytn let me know if this is what you meant as I am also seeking a solution to this issue.
Regards
