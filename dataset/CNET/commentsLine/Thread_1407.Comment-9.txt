&quot;your machine is indeed running a web server.it's time to take back control of the machine.
dig in and disable that web server&quot; not sure what it means that i am running a web server.
the entry appears to be connected with nvidia and i am therefore uncetain as to whether or not this is needed for some reason.
in any case - i don't know how to disable it!
&quot;research why you have that dns entry as well as perform the disable of the indexing service and the xp dma trick&quot;.
not sure what a dns entry is nor do i know how to perform the xp dma trick!
i have stopped the indexing as this was all i was confident about!
