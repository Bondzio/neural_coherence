power supplies standards (long before an ibm pc even existed) defined functions so that a supply causes no other damage.
to have damage means a supply was missing what must be standard in all machines.
a problem mostly found when computer assemblers select a supply only on dollars, watts, or name.
an assembler (not the supply manufacturer) is responsible for having required functions inside a computer.
a supply manufacturer will say in specifications whether those required functions exist.
if an assembler does not read those specs, then nobody can say if a computer contains standard and required protection.
if you had a surge, then also list other surge damaged appliances.
chances are the defect is due to the most common reason for failure.
a manufacturing defect.
to say more would be apparent by identifying physically damaged part(s).
