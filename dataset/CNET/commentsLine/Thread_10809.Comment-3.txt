hi.
i got one.
easy to install and it works!
i`m the sceptics sceptic and i thought `no way dude`.
my only issue is due to the fact that i live in canada.
they give you a list of area codes, choose your # and thats it.
i was told that soon, canadian area codes will be available.
now for the hardest part; cutting my land line!
plus, i just call forward to my cell.
damn thing really works.
go figure?
