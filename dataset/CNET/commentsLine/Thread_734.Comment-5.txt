good to hear.
now, the other shoe.
as i posted if not psu then the mtrbd.
could be at fault.
what can happen is the &quot;bad caps&quot; issue arises.
not that caps become defective or found that way but rather during use under wear&amp;tear they surcome to damage.
the damage results from prolonged use under &quot;heat stress&quot; and a bad caps develops.
the usual result is a bulging, distended, leaky or blown cap.
it causes &quot;iffy&quot; operation that comes and goes depending on where the bad caps are found.
the usual repair is to replace the whole bank of caps rather than just 1 or 2 that bad, as the history suggest it could happen to all sooner or later.
understand, bad caps are found in any electronic circuit, so anything electronic can have the issue.
the psu itself has caps as well.
so, beware your problem may come back, keep this in mind.
