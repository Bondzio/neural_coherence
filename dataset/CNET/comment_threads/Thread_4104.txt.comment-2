I'd get the i5.
But Windows machines are (still) proving to be unreliable.
Just hit the wrong web site or catch some trojan and game over.
If the i5 is not doable I'd think the i3 but would not bother with the AMD today.
Sorry if I decline long replies why.
My wife got a speedy i7 laptop which she is very happy with.
