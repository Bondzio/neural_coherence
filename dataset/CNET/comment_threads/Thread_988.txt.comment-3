If set to AUTO the system goes through the detection process each boot.
In the BIOS, try to detect each of the drives [no time limit in this detection] and enter those parameters in the BIOS rather than using AUTO.
See if that helps.
Probably use LBA on the right side of the entry.
Some time ago, I thought that I had read a post on on to extend thje toime that the boot allows to detect the drive before bowing out, but can't remember where.
