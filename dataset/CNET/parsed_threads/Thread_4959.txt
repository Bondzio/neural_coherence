<s> My husband has a custom built tower from Fry's with a 60gb SSD as the C drive. </s>
<s> It's in a slot on the top that you can pull out. </s>
<s> It has now filled up even though we tried to install everything we could on E: & F: and won't let us even update the virus program or window's updates. </s>
<s> Well he bought a 120gb SSD and Norton Ghost. </s>
<s> Can you give us the basic steps? </s>
<s> Like First install the new SSD Then image the C: to the new SSD He thinks he can just copy the C: to F: and then pull out the old SSD and put the new SSD in and then copy from F:. </s>
<s> I don't think it works that way. </s>
<s> If you pull out the C: drive won't the computer stop working? </s>
<s> Don't we have to install the new SSD in the computer first? </s>
<s> Also another thing I worry about is if you image the old SSD to the new SSD how do you keep all the GB on the new one without turning it into a 60GB? </s>
<s> Follow me? </s>
<s> I'm pretty good at figuring computer stuff out but this sounds too scary for me. </s>
<s> But if I had the basic steps I could probably figure out the details. </s>
<s> Is this something we can try or do OR should we let Fry's do it? </s>
<s> They can probably do it in a hour with a more professional program. </s>
<s> It will probably take us 3 days of stress. </s>
<s> For more background info, here's a link to my first question I posted when we bought the Fry's computer. </s>
<s> Well now it's a year later and we filled up it up! </s>
<s> How you doing with your 64GB, Kees? </s>
