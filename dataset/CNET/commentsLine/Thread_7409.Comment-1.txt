i am looking at purchasing a dell inspiron 530 2 choices : intel core 2 duo processor e4500(2mb l2 cache, 2.20ghz, 800 fsb) windows xp 2gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 667mhz-2dimms 20 inch monitor 500gb serial ata hard drive (7200rpm)w/databurst cache 19 in 1 media card reader 16x dvd=/rw drive this is $828 or same as above with vista home premium dual drives 48x cdrw/dvd combo drive + 16xdvd+/-rw drive $799 should i go with the xp and sacrifice the dual optical drive?
does it matter?
i know the price difference is insignificant.
i am currently using a 8 yr old hp pavillion with upgraded xp 850 mhz 256 mb i had me and it was a complete disaster!
i do not want to go through it again with vista.
i guess i need reassurance that it's a good os or stay with my trusty xp.
any advice?
