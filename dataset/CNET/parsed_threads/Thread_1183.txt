<s> Recently purchased MacBook Pro 17&quot;. </s>
<s> All fonts are micro type. </s>
<s> Web pages are columns using only one half to one third of the nice big screen. </s>
<s> I can &quot;zoom&quot; but that is not a permanent solution. </s>
<s> This includes the tool bar........ its tiny. </s>
<s> How do I make things readable and fit the screen? </s>
<s> I cannot find the answer in the manual or online but I may be searching the wrong criteria. </s>
<s> Help in the form of the correct web page is fine. </s>
<s> this question gets asked by recent switchers who are used to having a web page fill the entire screen. </s>
<s> Problem with that is that the web pages are not built to fill the whole screen. </s>
<s> Most are built to accommodate a 19&quot; monitor. </s>
<s> Try hitting the green button, top left of the window, and Safari will expand to the actual size of the web page. </s>

<s> The problem you are having is a real pain if you own an older model 17&quot; MB Pro but if you have the latest model then simply decreasing screen res should do the trick. </s>
<s> Current model MB Pros don't suffer the slightly soft, out of focus screen that results when you use any setting other than the highest screen res. </s>
<s> But if you did buy an older model then you are just going to have to live with command+ every time you open a new browser window. </s>
<s> Or you can decrease screen res and learn to live with the slightly soft screen. </s>
<s> 1600 x 1000 is the lowest setting I can tolerate but image/text will still appear proportionally smaller than on a 15&quot; MB Pro set to a native res of 1440 x 900 or a 20&quot; Apple cinema display set to its native res of 1680 x 1050. </s>
