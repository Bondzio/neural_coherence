have had a magic jack since it first appeared on the market,have bought some for friends as gifts.what could be better than a 20 dollar a year phone bill,for those spending hundreds and more on other services.a good internet connection is essential,the service has improved steadily since it started.you have a choice of using a phone,many different types,and as another user said,some phones work better than others, or you can use a headset and mike setup if you prefer.really simple to set up and many features come with it.perhaps some people are put off when they see the name &quot;magic jack&quot;, but this little device does provide some technical magic,mine works great and you have a 30 day period to return it if you don't like the way it performs.
