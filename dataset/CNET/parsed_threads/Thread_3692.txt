<s> Please help. </s>
<s> I've noticed a file named &quot;Thumbs.db&quot; appearing in different folders on both of my PCs. </s>
<s> I have a DELL 4700 with XP which I use for browsing. </s>
<s> I also have a Windows98 PC which is connected to the DELL in a small network. </s>
<s> This file has appeared on both PCs. </s>
<s> The properties tab does not really show me anything about the files which are different sizes ranging from 5kb TO 340kb. </s>
<s> Is this some sort of spyware or something ? </s>
<s> I would really like to know. </s>
<s> Thanks guys </s>
