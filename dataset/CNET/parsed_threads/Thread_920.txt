<s> i have a us robotics broadband router (model 8003) networking two computers at home for cable broadband. </s>
<s> last night i was on the net, viewed some movie trailers and closed the browser. </s>
<s> i tried getting back on a few mitues later and there was no connection to the net found on both computers. </s>
<s> i tries re-booting the router by pushing the pin-sized reset button, after that the status light is still showed as orange (which means that there is a system failure according to the us robotics manual). </s>
<s> anyone have any possible solutions to find out what excatly is wrong? </s>
<s> thanks in advance. </s>
<s> If removal of power and that reset fails, it's likely to be dead. </s>
<s> Reading http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2004/Jun/0116.html is interesting in that it could have a security issue. </s>
<s> Bring that up when you call in for RMA. </s>
<s> Tip: Be nice, but firm on the phone. </s>
<s> No threats, growls or such. </s>
<s> If in warranty, good. </s>
<s> If not, use that security issue to make your point it should be exchanged. </s>
<s> Tip 2: Accept a replacement of another model if it does the same job. </s>
<s> Observation. </s>
<s> OfficeMax had a belkin router for 10 to 15 bucks. </s>
<s> I have no use for another one, but the problem is that shipping can run as much as replacement. </s>
<s> This makes a mess out of repair options.. Bob </s>
<s> thank you very much. </s>
<s> if there is some sort of security issue i probably should/will just get another one. </s>
<s> a cable modem blip by attaching the CM directly to a computer. </s>
<s> If you get an IP and get online, then reattach the router and get no IP, it's likely a failed router. </s>
