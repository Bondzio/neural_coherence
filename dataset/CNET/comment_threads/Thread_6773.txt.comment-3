Because your MB has on board video, I would guess it takes the AGP function and you will be limited to PCI cards which are getting rare.
Your video is probably using some system RAM so you should regain this with a dedicated board.
These will not perform nearly as well as AGP, however.
But to verify this, you will need to open the box and look yourself.
Sound cards are usually easier to deal with.
