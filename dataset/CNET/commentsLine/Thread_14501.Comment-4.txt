i don't think i have any problems, my dvds burn and play pretty good.
i was just thought that after a year of heavy burning(dvd and cd) the burner would be dead but it seems okay.
i did some research on the brand name of the drive-tsst corp. which is a joint venture between toshiba and samsung.
the last firmware upgrade i got maybe fall of 2005, and none since.
this is why i think maybe i should get a new burner, because they've stop giving updates, meaning that my burner is outdated.
maybe i'm over reacting, i guess if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
