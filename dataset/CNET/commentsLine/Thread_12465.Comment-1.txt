i just recently upgraded everything but my gpu which is the nvidia geforce gt 520. my screen now randomly flickers, and makes the sound as if a usb has been unplugged.
i'm running windows 8, as i was on my last pc and it never did such thing.
i tried the latest drivers for the card, and even some previous versions and nothing has fixed this.
gaming seems to make it happen just a bit more frequently, and sometimes it minimizes the game and flashes non-stop, resulting in a reboot.
other system components are i5 3570k 8gb ddr3 ram, 1tb hdd, any advice would be great because i'm at a loss.
thanks.
