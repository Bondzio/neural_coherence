It says that despite being an AGP card, it still needs a PCIE connection as what it says on DailyTech http://www.dailytech.com/Sapphire+Prepares+2+More+HD+2600s/article7556.htm &quot; Although the card is AGP, it still requires additional power via a PCIe power connector&quot;

The quote from your post is indeed what it says on the page you link but I suspect they used the wrong term for the extra power connection. It does require an extra power connection on the card besides the slot connection.
