have you solved the problem yet?
i have a college degree in computer science (including n+ class) and i use the d-link di-704p (the black one, not the brown one) on my dsl with three computers at home.
a hub isn't really for connecting to the internet, rather for connecting segments of a network together.
some hubs only have ports to connect computers together in a peer-to-peer environment, not to another source such as a dsl modem.
what hub are you using, and can you tell me what ports you are using?
also, i can tell you a router is much faster than a hub.
a router remembers what is plugged into each port, a hub just broadcasts the data to every machine that is connected to it.
if you have a packet for computer #1, instead of the hub saying this is for #1 so i'll send it there, it plays &quot;mail call&quot; like you see in old war movies.
&quot;i have mail for computer #1!
!&quot; &quot;ok, i'm over here at mac address xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.&quot; &quot;alright.
here comes your mail&quot;.
a router says &quot;i've delivered to computer #1 before, so i'll just use the same connection and send it there again&quot;.
which would you say is faster?
plus, most routers have a firewall built in (the d-link di-704p does).
a hardware firewall is much better than any software firewall.
why?
a hardware stops attacks/probes/unsolicited packets before it arrives at your computer, even before it gets into your network.
where is a software firewall stored?
inside your machine.
any unwanted data much reach a point inside your machine before it is stopped.
to some degree, it has already infiltrated into your computer.
and it's totally already on your network.
go with the router, and you'll be better off.
i can help you out if you need in getting it set up and configured.
i usually don't offer free services, but i will this time since i work with the same router every day.
