<s> Hey guys...I am trying to resolve this problem for someone at work. </s>
<s> She uses this keyboard to input recieving orders, nothing really daunting on the keyboard at all. </s>
<s> Anyway, just today the little light in the right corner next to the volume knob became solid blue-purple and the keyboard does not respond now. </s>
<s> It used to always blink while it was active. </s>
<s> Already read the manual on everything to try, reset, new batteries.... </s>
<s> So really not sure on what is left to try. </s>
<s> Dell doesn't offer anything outside of the manual, which I said didn't help. </s>
<s> Anyone have any experience with these? </s>
<s> It is a Dell Optiplex gx240, rather old but still in good condish. </s>
<s> It uses win 2000.thanks </s>
<s> You didn't tell. </s>
<s> I am not sure if I did in the first place. </s>
<s> The thing is, all the machines in the warehouse have these keyboards and this is the first one to have problems. </s>
<s> The driver software was installed properly on all of them. </s>
<s> What do I need to do to 'pair' these together? </s>
<s> Keep in mind, I will be testing this on another pc that has xp professional instead. </s>
<s> Not only would you have to install the driver for the bluetooth dongle, but pair it before it would work. </s>
<s> All this is in the manuals and I'm just a programming dealing with bluetooth in my application. </s>
<s> I did not read the manual for your keyboard and I didn't look for it. </s>
<s> I had hopes that me mentioning pairing would ring a bell. </s>
<s> In short, moving it to another PC will bring with it a lot more work than just pairing it (a bluetooth procedure you do all the time). </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Okay, then apparently we made biiiig mistakes, lol. </s>
<s> Well what must one do to pair this keyboard with it's usb counterpart? </s>
<s> I am going to give this another try tomorrow. </s>
<s> I can only guide you to generic answers. </s>
<s> Like these -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=How+to+pair+Bluetooth+keyboards . </s>
<s> Okay, I have the keyboard in front of me now. </s>
<s> What numbers do you need? </s>
<s> I have a model number of: Y-RAQ-DEL2 Is there some program I am looking for to pair these? </s>
<s> Sorry about having so many questions, I just avoided wireless for so long because I dislike it lol. </s>
<s> I am not familiar at all with Bluetooth. </s>
<s> Thanks so much, by the way, for all the help you have offered so far! </s>
<s> You would give me the link to that manual. </s>
<s> This is all volunteer so like me stopping to help you change the tire, you get to show me the tire and more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Read http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/acc/P109356/en/index.htm </s>
<s> Didn't think to find manual to link to you-I am reading the paper one right now. </s>
<s> Anyway. </s>
<s> Yes, that is the one. </s>
<s> I have the exact same keyboard, and just tonight, it flipped into the mode you describe - if the power is on, the bluetooth light illuminates with a purplish tint. </s>
<s> It happened when my GSM Blackberry was very close to it, and I think the strong RF field from the cell phone damaged the programming on the circuit board that runs the keyboard. </s>
<s> I've looked at it enough that I'm giving up on it. </s>
<s> I like the keyboard, but I can't imagine how I'd get the firmware back into place on this. </s>
<s> Sadly, it indicates poor design on Dell/Logitech's part, that a RF-based keyboard would be so susceptible to damage from RF. </s>
<s> Good luck - if you figure out how to recover from the purple light of death, I'd love to know how! </s>
<s> It is very poor design attempt on tier part lol. </s>
<s> I have not been able to figure out why, although I did notice everyone in her area has a Bluetooth headset on all the time and none of them understand the settings on their phones so someone probably tried to pair it up with their phone lol. </s>
<s> If I am actually able to figure something out I will post! </s>
<s> I had the same problem that you and synchros described!!! </s>
<s> I put my keyboard and mobile in the same pocket and later on when i wanted to pair the keyboard again it didn't work any more =( only the purple led of death.. does anyone knw where can i find a solution?? </s>
<s> besides throw it away and never buy dell again? </s>
<s> this is so incredibly.. </s>
<s> My logitech bluetooth through me for a loop last week. </s>
<s> I finally had to remove it from the pairing screens (talk about not intuitive) and then pair it up again. </s>
<s> It still does not work when I switch users. </s>
<s> Bluetooth appears to be &quot;not ready&quot; for the market. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thought I would update to save the next poor soul.. </s>
<s> Your batteries are dead.. Trust me.. </s>
<s> The batteries you got from the Dollar store are not reliable. </s>
<s> Been there done that. </s>
<s> Reading 1.55V on the voltmeter. </s>
<s> The issue I noted is just one of many bluetooth gaffes I'm seeing. </s>
<s> What am I doing? </s>
<s> I'm in year 5 of bluetooth programming with PalmOS, now porting to Windows Mobile and more. </s>
<s> The bluetooth consortium gaffed it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> it is not the batteries or anything BUT the place where you turn the power on and off, in the back, you take off the small square/retangle shape cover and there is a small power board, it is that, that went out, i switch that with another power board and the keyboard works again </s>
<s> I had the exact same problem for years but left the keyboard in dust but now need one for a new system. </s>
<s> I opened it up and found this power board. </s>
<s> Where did you get a new one? </s>
<s> I spoke to Dell themselves and they had nothing on their knowledge base about this issue which I think is amazing. </s>
<s> The Tec said to me they would normally just swop the keyboard over so I'm assuming that this is a well known problem that they aren't admitting to as it;s a design fault. </s>
<s> You'll note that they have discontinued the product. </s>
<s> Did any one manage to find out where to get the spare power part from? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
