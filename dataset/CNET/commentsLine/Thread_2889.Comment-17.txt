for the most part, i'm back in business.
i (somehow) disabled the internal software of the rca camera, and now just plug it in, and access it thru &quot;my computer&quot; as another drive, view the avi files, and then drag them into another folder.
i can successfully view and listen to them in vlc media player.
i cannot, though, view them correctly thru windows media player or real player.
but, vlc is a stable player, and now i don't have to mess around with that cheesy software that was in the camera.
i appreciate all the help.
now....help me with my sound card update, which i posted in the appropriate forum.
as for windows media player, after doing very exhaustive research, seems alot of folks have the same problem.
alvin and the chipmunks way too fast audio.
some get it fixed with adjusting the acceleration.
that didn't help in my case.
thanks again, janice
