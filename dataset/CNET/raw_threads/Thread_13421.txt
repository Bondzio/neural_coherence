I have put a new cpu cooler - Coolermaster Hyper 6+ in my computer. It's a 4-pin cooler connected on a 4-pin connector on the Intel D975XBXLKR Bad Axe motherboard with 975X Express Chipset. I have Intel Pentium D 930 processor. So, the problem is that the temperature of my CPU is 46 degrees with opened case, and 51-58 with closed case and the fan speed is max. 1750rpm. The cooler specif. says that the fan speed is from 1800-3600 rpm. I have installed speed fan and all the fans (front, rear and cpu-fan) are monitored and controlled trough EMC6D103 chip and as I understand, PWM function. I've tryed to change the speed with speedfan, but nothing happends. With the default processor fan i had the same temperature results, but he changed the speed normaly, from 1900-2500 rpm. Help please, if You have any idee. THX!!

Proffitt	8/20/06 7:50 PM	1.1561034E12	Link, comment.	http://processorfinder.intel.com/Details.aspx?sSpec=SL94R notes some 63.4C temperature and a CPU that can emit possibly 93 Watts. To drag the temperature down you'll have to work very hard to improve the cooling. But so far you are in spec. Bob

Once, that theshold is meant, then the higher rpm fan setting kicks in to help cool an over-heated cpu. It seems after reviewing the website Robert posted you're within std. specs. of the cpu operation. Unless, your bios has a fan setting to change, then all this is done at a h/w level and no action from you will change it. tada -----Willy

(i've got a 650 (3.4ghz) with an artic cooler and its fan only spins about 500rpm most of the time and idle temp is about 55C. if you have intel's desktop utilities installed, open the mobo monitor and notice the green/yellow/red temp ranges.) your bios may have an option to turn off its fan management. doing so may allow speedfan to handle the management. also make sure your version of speedfan supports the 975 chipset. when i downloaded it last year it couldn't work with my D945GNT mobo. Alfredo Milani-Comparetti (speedfan's author) sent me a beta build with support for the 945 chipset.
