The inability to import has NOTHING to do with the Apple Macintosh hardware you were - or are using.
The issue is that iMovie is a free, consumer-grade, relatively low-end video editing application.
If you were capturing in 24P or some other high-end, it was not designed to handle that.
You need FinalCut...
I don't know if Express will do - I've been using Pro (in the Studio bundle) for a bit, and it does pretty much everything.
I suggest a quick read through of http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/ http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/ Sorry for all the posts... hope they help, though...
