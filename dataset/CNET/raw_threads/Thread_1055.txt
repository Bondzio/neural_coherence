despite working against longest time recall having severe nat problems devices such pair xbox consoles connecting online services such xbox live ever replaced modem router year ago assumed networking gear fully functional dsl line cause problems technician correct longer case yesterday he confirmed work he last time he visited line supposedly clean speed gaming devices continued report strict nats across board week ago order accommodate speakers spent entire night rearranging computer desk move hard drives wire gateway belkin wireless router requiring disconnect cables power adapters clearly everything powered off order moved took place repairs made internet service alright everything rebooted powercycled reconnecting setting everything noticed change nat settings looking problems specifically rather their presence router upnp enabled nat enabled proper trio ports opened xbox live etc apparent reason why nat readings register open begin happened dlink router use many moons ago longer works test past week noticed wired xbox having trouble connecting parties games live service entirely live taken down completely tuesday maintenance little help yesterday xbox connected hdtv separate media room began disconnect frequently internet wireless network live profile use failed sign online consoles repeatedly reported strict nat setting wired xbox continued function throughout ran options long ago decided try machine told although tried steps before luck step microsofts suggested path restart either modem router powering off router modem few seconds waited around seconds before reconnecting power router modem last before ran nat test machines once were fully functional lo behold reported errors open nat bit surprised excited nonetheless knowing test ignored strict nat past retested connections several times problems signed machines problems watched online performance saw nat problems day problems popped halo longer message game closed nat thrilled check results order further validate meantime course mostly story hoping relayed clearly having issues could really use help hope able explain myself enough questions truly understand why powercycling worked maybe xbox nat test somehow configured router tell howif thats transpired networking gear off longer period time rearranged room mentioned repairs made line time ago unless att something line called technician how simple powercycling alleviated long standing natfirewall problem modified modem router settings could happened general less related note lately routers coverage signal strength noticeably diminishing macbook pro establish connection megabits per second while same room router sony vaio fw vista notebook kitchen opposite house couple dozen feet reports megabits per second link read strong signal using contrast hp quadcore elite desktop media room down hall same room wireless xbox registers megabits per second link excellent signal walls between media room called office between kitchen vaio yet desktop getting quickest link specs three computers using report excellent signals macbook pro model ghz core duo processor while sony vaio model last year features slower ghz chip gb ram mac latest version os leopard vaio vista home premium sp quadcore hp runs ghz gb ram runs vista ultimate getting fastest connection while being farthest away router could either different wireless card manufacturers every mobile handheld device own reports weak signals same room router iphone pick network ventured outside next kitchen firstgeneration ipod touch registers single bar same room router iphone os week yet upgrade touch os recently tried scanning networks old sony psp device using latest firmware same room router repetitive registered signal strength while neighbors across streets signal over entering home portable gaming device uses router set allow traffic tests run perform order correct poor signal coverage problem tried using ap grapher mac crashing continuously hasnt provided useful information yet bothersome observations least show how poor coverage belkin router appears official product page should penetration around house neighbors older netgear linksys router run yet spreads further routers overall handling coverage throughput looks abnormal already thought using range booster considering getting mixed results same room router help thoughts long please bear posted previous threads before macintoshrelated forums macbook pro reported errors regards wpa encryption wireless network occurs macbook house taken visit others their wpa networks operated absolutely fine according apple discussion thread others seen similar problems believed errors os xs network utility merely showing packets being retransmitted lost mean network operate wpa course give little bit errors sent received macbook increase exponentially harmless told before link observations stop considering nat problem absent moment knock issues park good how go fixing considering replacing belkin router airport extreme base station possibly adding airport express unit good measure weekend intend replace networking cables gigabit ethernet wires safe major improvements theres good chance ill return apple networking gear apple store iphone madness going around fails once investigate settings wire gateway thing time consuming task over currently bridged disable routing functions belkin should faster capabilities firewall should off should effect anything never hate working separate interfaces accessible functioning router bridge mode reset entire thing set got box getting bridge mode according dslreports guide easier done properly many nat problems wonder restored wires routing capabilities disabled wifi connected belkin results before long ago getting double nat interference mac noticed didnt agree disable firewall belkin while using external router network function importantly safe belkin broadcast signal provide protection save firewall wire separate device could work yet try already tried reverse point decided working bride mode ill sounds simple enough never seem enough time dedicate work thoroughly plus always worry breaking something wires functionality easy work please suggestions feedback really help anyone could provide counsel references could work really appreciate making weekend project intend succeed prepared either troubleshoot replace entire modem andor router need clarify details asked many many thanks bmf
