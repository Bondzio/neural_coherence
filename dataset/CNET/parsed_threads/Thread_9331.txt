<s> Hello, I'm currently building my first computer. </s>
<s> I'm following the same parts as the $647 pc recommendation from the magazine maximum pc. </s>
<s> the parts are: CPU: AMD Anthlon II X4 620 MOTHERBOARD: Gigabyte GA-MA74GM-S2 MEMORY (RAM): Patriot 4GB DDR2/800 VIDEO CARD: Sapphire Radeon HD 5770 HARD DRIVE: Seagate 500GB Barracuda 7200.12 CD DRIVE (OPTICAL DRIVE): Samsung SH-S223C POWER SUPPLY: Cooler Master RS-460 the recommended case was &quot;Rosewill R220&quot; but apparently they aren't in production anymore. </s>
<s> I don't know much about computer cases so I need some help on finding the right case that's affordable at a decent price and supports those parts. </s>
<s> Also, if there's other recommendations on other parts, please let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> you need now and possibly use later ? </s>

<s> like the title, a case below $100 in its original price is fine with me. </s>
<s> in response to the slots, I want something like: 4 - External 5.25&quot; Drive Bays 1 - External 3.5&quot; Drive Bays 4 - Internal 3.5&quot; Drive Bays 7 - Expansion Slots </s>
<s> set the case criteria (with or without PSU) anywhere you want. </s>
<s> Lots of option http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/ddaStep.asp?platform=10021&model=10597&os=10394&type=10079&st=browse Let us know what looks good to you. </s>

<s> I found some cases off newegg.com that might fit what I want. </s>
<s> Is there anything in particular I should be aware of when finding a case? </s>
<s> How will I know if it'll fit my video card since I've heard that some cases have problems fitting newer video cards. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this is true or not so I want to make sure. </s>
<s> minis could be a problem....they're not too deep front to back. </s>
<s> Specifically which are you looking at ? </s>
