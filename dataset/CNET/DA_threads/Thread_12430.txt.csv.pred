1.1.2	I have a telephone line connection to the internet .	St
1.1.3	Can anyone recommend an external modem for me .	Ques
1.1.4	All options please .	Sug
1.1.5	Cheers .	Polite
1.2.1	Any USR external was nice for me .	St
1.2.2	But today I tend to just pick up units like http : //www.compgeeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=CDIMM00131-PB & cat=MDM which are under 20 bucks .	St
1.2.3	The modem market is littered with such bargains and support is non-existent .	St
1.2.4	While you are asking for all options , I ca n't help since that would be too much work on my part plus what you can obtain may be limited to what country you live in .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	There are a lot of choices .	St
1.3.2	They will all work .	St
1.3.3	Go to www.pricegrabber.com and put in External modem and you will get a list with lots of choices .	St
1.3.4	I like USR modems but there are many good ones out there .	St
1.4.1	http : //www.usr.com/home.asp	St
1.5.1	Do n't settle for & quot ; non-brand & quot ; modems out there even if the price is decent .	St
1.5.2	The brands that seem to pop-up alot are USR ( 3Com ) and Zoom .	St
1.5.3	Both supply docs and s/w if needed , while many off brands tend to skip on alot of support or offer basic needs .	St
1.5.4	Plus , the chipset to look for is Lucent or Rockwell , but there are Conxent , Cirrus , and Motorola , maybe others .	St
1.5.5	Check to be sure any cabling is supplied as that 's an extra cost otherwise .	St
1.5.6	You can google or websearch and see what the vendors offer but if you know you have a problematic telco link , make sure to correct that as well .	St
1.5.7	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
