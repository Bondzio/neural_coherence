<s> Hello Again-- You all helped me solve a problem with my cd rom last week. </s>
<s> Maybe now you can help me with my Lexmark x125 all-in-one. </s>
<s> The short question, is it possible for the USB cord to go bad? </s>
<s> I have had this Lexmark for 1-2 years, and it has always required me to restart the computer every day as it &quot;freezes&quot; up and won't print if it hasn't been used for a while. </s>
<s> Of course I wouldn't save the doc I was trying to print, so I would lose that and then have to sit while I restarted and then start all over again. </s>
<s> For a printer without an on/off button, this need to restart has always troubled me. </s>
<s> So over the last month the restarts have not been working. </s>
<s> Recently, I just couldn't get the thing to work even though the printer status showed ready. </s>
<s> So, I moved the cord to the front usb ports and it started working again. </s>
<s> Today, I had to unplug the cord several times before it would work. </s>
<s> So is it the cord? </s>
<s> I have Windows XP Home Edition 2002, have downloaded all the Win Service Packs, and it's all running on a Compaq with AMD XP1700 processor 1.47 G with 480M of RAM. </s>
<s> Yes, they can, their cheep so get a couple of spares. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Well, that would seem to be the quick fix this case...and they are cheap to boot! </s>
<s> Gotta love that. </s>
<s> Will pick up a couple tomorrow. </s>

<s> Sure USB cables can go bad but seeing as you'd have to pull on it to break wires or a pet would have to chew on it I doubt that's your problem. </s>
<s> You see if you had pulled it hard enough to break a wire you'd have unplugged it first. </s>
<s> Since you didn't mention any pets I'm betting that's not your problem either. </s>
<s> From my experience it's usually the female part of the connector rather than the cord. </s>
<s> USB connectors were poorly designed and the male end tends to wallow out the female connector making for bad or intermittent connections. </s>
<s> If that doesn't solve the issue the next step is to look at the drivers. </s>
<s> You said you've had to reinstall the software and that sends up red flags for me. </s>
<s> Sometimes when you reinstall software there are bits left over from the previous install. </s>
<s> Those bits can actually cause problems. </s>
<s> Don't think that because you deleted the directory or used Microsoft's uninstaller that you got rid of it all because more often than not you haven't. </s>
<s> There are usually sites on the net that will walk you through a thorough uninstall of particular software but you'll have to search them out. </s>
<s> Speaking of drivers it might not bew a bad idea to check out your USB drivers under system devices. </s>
<s> Somtimes you'll get multiple drivers listed in there that can cause troubles. </s>
<s> John, I appreciate the info you have provided also...but the new cord seems to have fixed the problem. </s>
<s> I guess a new cord would have fixed the adaptor end you were talking about too! </s>
<s> As to the uninstalling being a problem, dealing with my cd rom issue taught me that this is much more of a problem than I ever imagined. </s>
<s> I will check this out if the problem crops up again. </s>
<s> Thanks everybody for their help! </s>
