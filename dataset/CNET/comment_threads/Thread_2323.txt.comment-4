It probably would be a problem solved if I changed my graphics cards to two more modern ones that were somewhat guaranteed to work together to create a three monitor setup.
I wish I could.
I'm positive that there is a specific answer to the specific problem I'm facing with these ATi cards.
That said, I appreciate your input.
