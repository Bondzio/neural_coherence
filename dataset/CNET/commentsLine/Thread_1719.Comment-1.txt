hello, i have a hp pavillion 734n with phoenix bios.
i tried to install a second hard drive with another xp on it.
it booted up a couple of times, then the next cold start all i get is a beeping.
i have no monitor or floppy.
all i got is the beeping.
i removed the second hard drive, but the beeping still continues.
i tried to put in the restore cd's but they wouldn't boot up either.
any help or thoughts would be appreciated.
thanks in advance, bobby &quot;the beep&quot;
