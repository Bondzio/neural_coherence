1.1.1	I 'm investigating the best way to provide connectivity between two locations 2200 ' apart , with at least 2 sub-locations at each end .	St
1.1.2	The current plan is pulling rg6 and cat6 , but I 'm not sure that would even work ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 'd like to see a wireless implementation , possibly including VoIP phones at the remote location .	St
1.1.4	There are 2 phone lines into the main house only , though the 'barn ' could be wired , too .	St
1.1.5	I 'm thinking satellite broadband , distributed wirelessly .	St
1.1.6	It 's not currently obvious that there is LOS to the retreat area , but NLOS , I 'm pretty sure .	St
1.1.7	Would it make more sense just to put satellites at either end ?	Ques
1.1.8	Unfortunately , the two locations are on different transformers , so connecting over the power lines is not an option .	St
1.1.9	What might be a ballpark budget for connecting 2 computer in the remote location ( also wirelessy ) and 2 or 3 at the main house and 'barn ' ( separated by about 300 ' ?	Ques
1.1.10	Thanks for any ideas_________compwire	St
1.2.1	There are microwave links for just such an application .	St
1.2.2	They run from 1 to 5 thousand per end and line of sight is required .	St
1.2.3	Usually people will not do this and just drop a wired connection into the ground .	St
1.2.4	In the 300 foot range , you can go with consumer items such as WiFi and place repeaters to extend the range of the Access Point .	St
