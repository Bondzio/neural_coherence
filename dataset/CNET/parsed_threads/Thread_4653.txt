<s> I have 3 computers all with WinXP all hooked to a linksys wireless router. </s>
<s> My notebook (HP pavilion n5435) is wireless and the others (emachine and Dell) are wired. </s>
<s> My problem is I keep on losing my cable connection (motorola pcx1100u bought from my cable ISP)The connection goes down for no apprent reason. </s>
<s> I have had other computers hooked-up (which have now been replaced with the ones I have now so I know it is not the compters)and had the same problem. </s>
<s> Therefore the problem must be with the router, the cable modem, or my ISP. </s>
<s> When it goes down sometimes all I have to do is reboot the cable modem other times just the router. </s>
<s> Sometimes both or even both and the computers. </s>
<s> This has been an ongoing aggravating problem. </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly apprecitated. </s>

<s> Lost connections through cable can be confounding. </s>
<s> I found that the cable itself (RG59 or RG6) can cause an issue when split too many times prior to the modem. </s>
<s> I requested that my installer run one line directly off the main to insure a good signal. </s>
<s> You can eliminate the router as the problem source by taking it out of the mix and attach the modem directly to one PC. </s>
<s> If the problem persists, then the router is ruled out leaving just the cable or the modem or the ISP. </s>
<s> In any case I would make it their problem. </s>
