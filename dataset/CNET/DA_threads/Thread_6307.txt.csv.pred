1.1.1	i live in a dorm and i want to stream movies to my nexus 7 but i dont want to buy a nas .	St
1.1.2	can i connect my external to a router ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16833704137 ) and use that to stream movies .	Ques
1.1.3	i dont need to be able to connect to it all over campus ( i know that involves hacking the proxy ) but mainly in my room would be nice .	St
1.1.4	could you tell me if it 'll work and why/how ?	Ques
1.1.5	thanks http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16833320059 would it work with this router maybe ?	Ques
1.2.1	The likely reason ( s ) for no one having answered this is that it could entail hacking into a secured network for potentially nefarious reasons , which is not only unethical but could also have legal rammifications .	St
1.2.2	Methinks you are on your own in this circumstance .	St
1.3.1	If you connect your external to a router , it 's attached to a network ( a small network , consisting of your nexus and that router ) .	St
1.3.2	That is what we call Network Attached Storage , or NAS shortly .	St
1.3.3	So , if your external can be connected to the router , you already have NAS .	St
1.3.4	And if it does n't it wo n't work .	St
1.3.5	But I see the Nexus 7 has a USB-port .	St
1.3.6	And most externals I know ( unless they are Firewire of e-SCSI ) can connect via USB .	St
1.3.7	So why do you think you need a router ?	Ques
1.3.8	Kees	St
1.4.1	And what would he use as an ISP ?	Ques
1.4.2	What I gleaned from the original post was to be able utilize the available on campus service which unless I am mistaken would require hacking into the server .	St
1.4.3	On many college campuses doing this is unacceptable because of security restraints and tight internet use policies when using their system ( s ) .	St
1.5.1	& quot ; I dont need to be able to connect to it all over campus ( i know that involves hacking the proxy ) but mainly in my room would be nice & quot ; Just using the portable hard disk in his room with a USB-cable seems feasible .	St
1.5.2	And the same method would work in friends rooms and , in fact , all over the campus.That extra cable is a little bit clumsy indeed when walking or on bicycle , but not being able to watch video then might be a minor nuisance .	St
1.5.3	Kees Kees	St
1.6.1	I have no intentions of hacking but I think I go it figured out I think , but I only want to use it in my room	St
1.7.1	It has to be rooted to use the usb	St
