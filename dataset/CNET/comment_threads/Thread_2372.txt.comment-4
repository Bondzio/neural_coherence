There are three key voltages used by computer components.
12 volts, 3.3 Volts, and 5 volts.
If the card needs 30 amps on the 5 volt line, having 30 amps on the 12 volt line won't help a bit if the 5 amp only has 10 amp capabiliy.
Another reply told you how to see the specs for each of the voltages.
Convert each to watts and then read more, the supply normally cannot supply the sum of the three wattages, thus they also post a specification about the maximum total power for the combination of two or three.
