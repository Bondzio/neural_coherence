Here is my setup: -Motorola Cable Modem which goes into a -Linksys WRT54GS Router From this point I have the Office PC plugged into 1 port and a Vonage Phone Adaptor plugged into another port. I am able to get the internet access on both the office PC and on my laptop when I connect wirelessly. I also have 2 printers connected to the Office PC. I figured it would as easy as choosign to SHARE the Printers from that machine, but I guess not. Do I need a print server? Do I need to send the Cable modem into the comptuer first and then out to the router? (I don't want to do this becasue I use the router for QoS) I would also like to be able to share a folder on the office PC so that if I work on a document on the laptop I can just copy it over to that machine for storage because I also backup everything on the office PC to off-site storage. any advice on my setup? thanks Tucker

Secondly, you have to make sure that they are part of the same workgroup. For some reason I've found that they have problems when you don't keep them in the same workgroup and do basic file sharing.

Are you saying on the router or on the computer and on which computer? Is this to share the printer? Also, what ports do I need to open? Do I allow these in the router or in the firewall? (I use McAfee Firewall by the way on the Office PC and Symantec on my laptop since it is a work PC). Also, how do I make sure it is part of the same workgroup? If this is more info then this forum can provide, is there someplace I can go to get this info? thanks

Hopefully all of your computers are running XP to simplify things? You will need to configure non microsoft firewalls.

I don't want to mess it up by adding a new &quot;workgroup&quot; but that could also be why the shared printing isn't working. advice?

But it's still simple to join your home workgroup when needed. Hold down the Windows Logo key and press the Pause/Break key. On the system properties box select the Computer Name tab and click the change button. Select the workgroup option and enter the name of the workgroup you want to join. You will have to restart the computer.
