So I'm looking for a simple way to take advantage of networking 2 PC's in my home using Windows ICS. I've done everything correct as far to setting up both PC's. However when the Machine#1 connects to the internet, Machine#2 does not connect at all. Does the Verizon's VZAccess Manager application is causing my problem? I really need help with this...as far as Networking...I'm consider to be a white belt. 2 - P4 (Dell) Windows XP Home PC 1 - Verizon Wireless UM150 USB Modem 1 - VZAccess Manager 1 - Crossover Cable Machine 1 IP address - 192.168.0.1 Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0 Gateway - (blank) Machine 2 IP address - 192.168.0.2 Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0 Gateway - 192.168.0.1

Most broadband ISP's let you use a configuration with cable-modem-router and then multiple PC's connected to the router. Did you check with your ISP (that's Verizon?) if it can be done this way? Kees

I did contact Verizon to help me resolve my networking issue but they stated that they do not support networking with there product and that I shoud purchase another USB modem and pay for 2 years $60 a month. I thought that Windows ICS and with a LAN Crossover Cable could do the job since Machine#1 at like the DHCP server and not require a Router, Switch, or Hub. Since I'm only connecting 2 Machines. As last resort I could buy a router and cross my finger it will fix my problem.
