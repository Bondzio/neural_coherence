OMG!
I didn't expect such a setup.
It is easy and economical for me to setup individual PCs rather than setting up Thin Clients and stuffs.
I thought I could build a big size CPU with some extra VGA outputs and USB ports for my project.
So, I am going to set up some vertical Desktop CPUs, so that I can make a compact setup.
Anyhow, thank you for your kind information.
