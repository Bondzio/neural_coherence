m, thank you for your detailed answer.
i understand the flow of how the connections need to be made.
as to the products themselves...can you recommend one that is cheap but fast and reliable for apple.
do i need to worry that it is an apple (and should get airport express) or does that not matter.
how about how many ports does the router need and speed and reliability?
again many thanks for your time.
