OK So I am right in thinking this is what you are saying.
Connect the router to the cable modem Connect PC to router then for the rooms where I would like Wifi - run wired waps back to the router How expensive are wap's If I go this route then should I get a 802.11n router or 802.11g?
Thanks as always
