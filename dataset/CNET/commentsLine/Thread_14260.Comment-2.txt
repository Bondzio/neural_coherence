do i need a &quot;core2 duo, 512 gpu, 3g ddr2&quot; type setup, or a &quot;core i7, 1gb gpu, 4gb ddr3&quot; type setup?
either are nice but i'd stick to the 4gb machines since you move solidly into the 64 bit wave and won't feel left behind.
the memory on the gpu is all about gaming.
so no real gain for your listed uses.
i am using something along the first model (c2d w/4gb ddr3) and it's nice.
but will shop for a quad desktop later this year.
