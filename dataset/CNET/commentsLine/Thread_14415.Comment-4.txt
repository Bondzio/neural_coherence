i really appreciate the help.
i am going to try the steps that you have suggested when i get home this evening.
i am using a dial up to connect to the internet, but ethernet to network my computers.
i am assuming that when i double click the network connections that i am going to be adjusting my settings for dial up since i am using a modem for my internet.
is this a correct assumption?
thanks again for the help, laraine liverman
