I currently have a PC2700 512Mb ram.Im not tryin to buy from Hp site because it cost way more than in store or other sites online like newegg. Should i get 512mb maybe cause of dual channel or a 1GB PC2700 memory? Is dual channel better if i got a 512mb or would it be faster if i added a 1gb with my stock Hp memory? I only have 1 memory slot left and the mobo max is 2GB. Heres a link to what kind of memory i would like to get for my HP. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820144202 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820144104 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820141429 1GB Memory-&gt;&gt; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820144122 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145439 ok theres the site link. I was thinking to just buy one stick of maybe a 512 or 1GB. If i buy a kingston or corsair 512mb will i still have dual chanel wit my stock ram?

Or should i just buy dual channel system (2X512mb) because i dont want to throw away the 512 i have in my HP that came stock wit it.

I think it will use dual channel because if u have the same amount of ram like 512x2 it will work. but i duno if i should just get one more 512mb stick from any company. will it be faster?
13912	6	118718	1347988	1347828	bigygf	8/8/05 1:24 PM	1.12350744E12	i stand corrected	well, your cpu does support dual channel operation but the chipset on your motherboard does not, so you might as well just buy any brand of memory for that 2nd 512mb stick, having a matched pair won't make a difference on that motherboard
