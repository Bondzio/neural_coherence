I would use it for internet access, downloading small Docs and Word files, writing, picture storing, and occasionally watching videos. I want reliability and I will probably also replace my monitor but my space for the monitor is only 22 inches wide. I have plenty of room for any size tower.

As an example I took a desktop and in 3 months it could not access the internet. We had done nothing to the machine but it's antivirus suite expired and &quot;to be safe&quot; it shutoff any networking. This is reliability? Sorry but for now, there are no know reliable Windows PCs. This and other issues plague this industry. Can you imagine a toaster that stops working in 3 months? Bob
