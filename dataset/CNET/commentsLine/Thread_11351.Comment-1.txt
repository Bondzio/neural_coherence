my backup pc, which is a pentium 4, with windows xp pro, does not have any sound.
it has an asrock p4vm800 motherboard.
when i did a scan at crucial.com, it told me that it was an asus p4v800-x for some reason.
so i am wondering how do i get the sound to work, and can this motherboard with it's current video and xp pro support dual monitors?
thank you
