The connectors don't seem to match, and there are two hard drives in the Maxtor, so should I have bought two enclosures or one that fits both into it? I tried to connect one of the hard drives into the Metal Gear Box, but the white plastic connector wasn't the same as the one to the Maxtor HD. Can anyone advise me to a compatible enclosure or tell me what I'm doing wrong? Thanks.

Does this picture look like your drive cable and connections -&gt; https://www-304.ibm.com/systems/support/supportsite.wss/sata2.jpg If so, you need to shop for the SATA drive housing. Bob

And what happened was that I put a power adapter that was too strong into the Maxtor external HD, so it didn't read on my computer anymore. The LED light kept flashing, but not steadily. Thanks.

That might damage more than just the enclosure, but also the electronics of the disk itself. No guarantees they work even in the right enclosure. In that case, all you can do with it is throw the disks away. Kees
