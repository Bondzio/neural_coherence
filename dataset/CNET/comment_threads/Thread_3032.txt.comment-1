I have a router and two pcs on it.
One (ethernet connected to the router) has a printer and I want to share it with the other pc.
I set up the printer as shared Then I went to the other pc (wireless connection to the router) and tried to define a remote printer.
The printer add wizard cannot find the printer: I tried browsing and it found nothing; I tried telling it the printer was \\pcname\printername and it couldn't find it either What am I missing?
Both machines are running WinXP Home John
