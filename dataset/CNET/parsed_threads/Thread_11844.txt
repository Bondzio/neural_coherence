<s> I am considering buying a white macbook soon, $1300 version, and was wondering what kind of difference upgrading from 1 to 2 gigs of RAM would make. </s>
<s> I will be using all the iLife programs, maybe some video editing, DVD watching, and maybe some gaming (obviously not new games, I know it has a bad vid card.) </s>
<s> I was just wondering what affect the upgrade would have (it is $175) and if you think it's worth it. </s>
<s> Also, do you think a bigger hard drive (120 gig) for $150 is worth it? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> Please no &quot;just get a pro&quot; or anything of that nature. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> More RAM is usually More better! </s>
<s> If you do not have a problem with the extra cash, a 120GB would be fine for what you have described. </s>
<s> Remember though that an external Firewire drive would have a larger storage space for less money. </s>
<s> The drive would also be a full sized on running at 72000 rpm and probably a larger cache than is on the internal. </s>
<s> That video card is not exactly bad, just not as good as it could have been. </s>
