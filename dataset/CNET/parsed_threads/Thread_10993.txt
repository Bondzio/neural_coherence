<s> Changed from Comcast to ATT/Yahoo DSL but it still has Comcast on the top of the browser window....&quot;Microsoft Internet Explorer presented by Comcast&quot;. </s>
<s> I've searched files and folders and everything is deleted that I had from Comcast. </s>
<s> Why is it still on there? </s>
<s> I'm confused! </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> If you're using XP Pro you can customize the Internet Explorer title bar to read, &quot;By Lucy&quot; or anything else you like. </s>
<s> Just type gpedit.msc in the run dialog box. </s>
<s> Expand the User Configuration node in the Group Policy console on left. </s>
<s> Select Browser User Interface and then in the right pane double-click Browser Title. </s>
<s> In the dialog box that opens, select the &quot;Customize Title Bars&quot; check box and type whatever you want. </s>
