<s> I am looking for a new pc. </s>
<s> I have been researching and found that SEVERAL people are having problems with live tv freezing, or locking up their system. </s>
<s> No one seems to know what the root cause is. </s>
<s> some theories are the duel core processor, the tuner and an AMD processor. </s>
<s> The list goes on. </s>
<s> Are there new pc's that have a tv tuner that does not lock up. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> a properly configured machine doing that. </s>
<s> It's usually a PEBKAC error. </s>
<s> Users will try to do something they either shouldn't or can't, or hose up their machines with a gazillion running programs in the background, or they expect too much out of a PC that just barely meets requirements, or are filled with adware, spyware, trojans, etc. </s>
<s> As I said, a properly configured and clean machine will perform as advertised. </s>
<s> PEBKAC - Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair. </s>
<s> I agree with the PEBKAC theory with some. </s>
<s> But some of these posts tell a different story. </s>
<s> http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&q=gt5032%20gateway&btnG=Google+Search&sa=N&tab=wg Thanks for looking into this. </s>
<s> but I think I'd shy away from Gateway. </s>
<s> But part of the travails of PCs are driver issues and maybe a machine that has issues with heat or &quot;other&quot;. </s>
<s> A proper machine will not lock up on use of a TV card. </s>
<s> It seems that we are expected to fix issues with vendors that don't deliver the machine ready to use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the feedback. </s>
<s> I am looking for a pc that I can edit homemade camcorder video,and must have a reliable tv tuner. </s>
<s> I thought Gateway was good, however I am open to suggestions. </s>
<s> about an HP. </s>
<s> The hp m7360n seems like a loaded pc. </s>
<s> does HP have a good service record? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> But I am fairly adept at finding current drivers and avoiding heat or power issues. </s>
<s> What I was alluding to was that today's vendors and more are leaving it to us to sort drivers and such out while that other maker seems to take a different approach. </s>
<s> This may not be an option for those that must run Windows. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> HP/Compaq is pretty good, I've had several over the years and zero problems (today I build my own). </s>
<s> The latest article I read in PCWorld magazine showed that IBM/Levono rated highest in customer satisfaction and reliability. </s>
<s> Which is why I own an IBM Thinkpad. </s>
<s> Again. </s>
<s> Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't. </s>
<s> Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. </s>
<s> I think I have settled into the HP7360n. </s>
<s> It should handle my home movie editing, and vhs transfers. </s>
<s> With the few reviews posted on this site, It seems that the tv tuner works well(unlike the Gateways). </s>
<s> I bought a seperate monitor that has dvi capability. </s>
<s> Is it possible to upgrade the hp7360n to accept dvi? </s>
<s> Secondly, would dvi make that much of a difference for watching vidos, and tv? </s>
<s> Thanks for the link to your web site. </s>
<s> Some great downloads there. </s>
<s> And some great reference for me seeing that I am incharge of the phone system at work. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
