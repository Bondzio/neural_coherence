I built my own PC a couple years ago, and I discovered recently that my on board USB slots are all USB 1.1 after I tried to transfer some pretty big files to a friends external HD and it took forever. I want to upgrade to USB 2.0 and mount it in one of my 5.25'' bays so they're in the front. I've priced USB 2.0 cards, but before I buy one, I want to make sure that it'll work right. Does the motherboard need to support USB 2.0 for it to work at the higher speeds, or can I just buy a PCI card and be done with it? Thanks!
