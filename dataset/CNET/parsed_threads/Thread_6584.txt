<s> Hi all, &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I have a Virgin Media Super Hub with a 60mpbs connection in my study on the first floor. </s>
<s> The hub is connected to my NAS and my laptop, both wired. </s>
<s> Wireless is disabled on the VM Super Hub, but it is not running in modem mode since I need access to the extra LAN ports. </s>
<s> &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;A gigabit cable runs from the study to the living room on the ground floor where it is connected to the LAN port on a TP-Link n router. </s>
<s> There are three devices connected to the router, again wired. </s>
<s> This router acts as my wireless hub for all the devices in the house (approx 10 devices in all). </s>
<s> I use only the TP-Link as the wireless router since its performance far exceeds that of the Super Hub. </s>
<s> &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, none of the routers are dual-band. </s>
<s> Now that I have a couple of dual-band capable devices, if I enable 5Ghz on the VM Super Hub and retaing the 2.4Ghz on the TP-link, will I get the benefits of dual band? </s>
<s> If not, what would I need to configure in order to achieve that? </s>
<s> Do they need to have the same SSID? </s>
<s> &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Many thanks. </s>

<s> As that's well discussed I'll answer no and move on. </s>
<s> What is this benefit of dual band? </s>
<s> You never revealed that. </s>
<s> I find that having a dual band helps since we know that WiFi is half duplex (sorry if I don't define all tech terms) and that means only one device can transfer a packet at a time in only one direction. </s>
<s> Having a second WiFi channel (you may call this dual band) means we doubled our WiFi capacity. </s>
