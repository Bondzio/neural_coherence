now the correct question appears &quot;which brand of hd do you trust most&quot; that makes sense!!
i like wd have a dell desktop 3yrs old use two external wd drives no problems with either and they are on at least 12 hrs.
a day.
i did have an omega external drive that crapped out after 1 1/2 yrs.
i'd go with wd
