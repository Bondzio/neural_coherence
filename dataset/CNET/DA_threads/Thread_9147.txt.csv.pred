1.1.3	When I insert the 4GB Micro SDHC into my mobile phone , it can read and write data .	St
1.1.4	When I insert the 4GB Micro SDHC into its SD Adapter , and then into my Lenovo T61 laptop with Windows XP SP2 , then I can not access nor format it , even after rebooting with the card inserted .	St
1.1.5	The card shows up in My Computer as & quot ; SD / MMC ( D : ) & quot ; and when I click on this icon I get & quot ; Please insert a disk into drive D : . & quot ; I 've tried doing this with the lock tab on and off on the SD Adapter .	St
1.1.6	I then put the 4GB card back into a SDHC compatible digicam , and the card can not be read .	St
1.1.7	So I format it .	St
1.1.8	I then put the 4GB card back into the laptop , and it works fine .	St
1.1.9	I then put the card into the mobile phone , and the files are readable and fine .	St
1.1.10	I then put it back into the laptop and I get the original error .	St
1.1.11	When I insert a different , good/working 1GB SD card from the digicam into my Lenovo T61 , that card works fine .	St
1.1.12	So , now just please answer : Is this normal ?	Ques
1.1.13	Could the SDHC MMC card be partially bad ?	Ques
1.1.14	Does anyone else have an SDHC/MMC card that works fine in your digicam , mobile phone and laptop ?	Ques
