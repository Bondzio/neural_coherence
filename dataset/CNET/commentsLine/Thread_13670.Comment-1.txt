hi, i'm trying to help my roommate with his computer, but i need some help figuring out what's wrong with it.
i don't know all the specs, but it's got a p4 and has been working acceptably up until now.
this morning he tried to turn it on and it wouldn't boot.
i've opened it up, and a green led on the mobo is lit whenever the computer is plugged in, which makes me wonder if the psu is ok. when i try to turn on the computer the cpu's heatsink fan spins for a second, and then stops, which also seems to indicate that it's getting power.
the psu fan does the same thing: spins for a second and then stops.
if i hit the power button after that nothing happens.
if i unplug the computer for a few seconds the led will go out, and when i plug it back in and hit the power button the fans will again spin for a second and then stop.
the fact that at least some juice seems to be flowing makes me wonder if the mobo, not the psu, is the problem.
any advice would be greatly appreciated.
jason
