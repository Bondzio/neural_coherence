<s> Hi - I'm looking to purchase an external drive enclosure that works with Windows 7. </s>
<s> I would thought that this would be fairly easy. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I am finding out that they spec in for windows XP, Vista, but very few for Windows 7. </s>
<s> A few that have advertised for Windows 7 in the buyers' reviews will mention that the ads are incorrect and they do not work with Windows 7. </s>
<s> Hoping someone here can provide some recommendations. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to find an enclosure that holds the entire drive as opposed to the drive just plugging in the top of the drive enclosure. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Have a Great Day, Jim </s>
<s> why an external hard disk should work with XP and Vista and not with Windows 7. </s>
<s> So find your local computer shop, let them show that it works with any of their Windows 7 PC's (they won't have anything else in the shop anyway) and let them assure you that of course you can return it if it doesn't work with you. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
