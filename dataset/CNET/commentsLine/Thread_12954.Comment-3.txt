the problem i'm having with the camera is that the camera is a not much - a gateway w/5 mega pixel.
i can take good pictures of cotton fabric but it's the silk or exotic fabrics that don't do well.
my options were to buy a realy good digital camera ($$$) or a scanner so i thought a scanner would be less expensive.
also, i don't know much about photography or scanning but i have a feeling i'm going to have learn one or the other to get what i need.
thanks for your response.
