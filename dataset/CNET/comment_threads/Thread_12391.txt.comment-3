Hi there, just an update to my post.
I discovered that there will be no problems if the Vista notebook initiated the Ad-hoc connection.
So if the Vista creates a new ad-hoc network, and the desktop computer (XP Pro, also acts as internet gateway) connects to it, the connection will be magically very well.
But if the Windows XP Pro Desktop computer initiated the ad-hoc network, and the Vista notebook connects to it, the problems arise.
For convenience - is there a way to make the connection work if XP initiates the ad-hoc network?
Thanks!
