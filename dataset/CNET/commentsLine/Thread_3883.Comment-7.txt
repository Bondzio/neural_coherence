dont u do that !!
even though the performance of the xt is better than the pro (obviously.....y wud they bother 2 give it a diff name ??)
its not bad ( 100 mhz higher clock speed , shaders improved etc) its like , if the price was lesser and u dont own any card , u might wanna consider buyin it... i say u shud stay with da pro for like two years untill another game comes out and ur card is on the minimum requirments list !!
(just kiddin) just stick around with the pro card - its awesum (wish i owned it !!
i have a 9600 xt but im still very happy !)
