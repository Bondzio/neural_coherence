I recently bought a new external hard drive (Seagate) with a NexStar case.
It shows up in &quot;Device Manager&quot; but not in &quot;My Computer&quot; or &quot;Disk Management&quot; which means i can't partition it or anything.
I've tried using the installation CD, but that didnt do anythin.
I tried a program Discwizard but that kept telling me to reboot over and over.
If you could help me, It'd be greatly appreciated, thanks!
