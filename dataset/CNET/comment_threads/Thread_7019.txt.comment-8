Good info.
The only controller I'm planning on using is the one built into the Tyan S2696A2NRF Motherboard ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813151048 ).
At the moment, I'm actually leaning toward using two Raptors striped (Raid 0), and relying on the network storage for really important data backup.
Make sense?
Thanks again!
