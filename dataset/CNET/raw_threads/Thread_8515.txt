I have a card bus controller so I assume I have a cardbus slot which I guess is or could be the same as pcmcia slot. I purchased a ExpressCard sound card and inserted it into the slot but it does not reach far enough in to make the connection. My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 8600. I take the same card to a co-workers laptop which is a Dell Inspiron 9400 and it connects no problem. So I obviously have the wrong slot. Is there any inexpensive adapters I might be able to find that will make the expresscard funtion in my laptop????

Just needed an audio input and hardware that can create decent MP3's and maybe improve the listening quality and enjoyment as well. I am sure I am loosing a little going from expresscard to USB but hopefully it will do the trick. Now I just need Creative Wave Studio for XP which I like better then using the free audacity software.
