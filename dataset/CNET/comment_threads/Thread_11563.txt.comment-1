I know it doesn't make much sense to have one SATA and another UATA drive and make the SATA as a slave.
But IF someone wants to do so, make the SATA as a slave (or #2 as is the politically correct in LA Country now....) is that possible?
Are SATA and UATA compatible at all?
I mean can I use a SATA drive as a 1 drive and the UATA as the 2nd?
I know that the main advantage with SATA is the thinner cable which provides better airflow in the case.
But what else is the advantage?
I have asked this before, but since we don't have a search engine here, it's rather hard to find old posts...
Thanks in advance!
