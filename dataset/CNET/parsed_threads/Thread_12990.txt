<s> I have a newly installed Fantom 1 TB HD. </s>
<s> (Two months ago) Yesterday I was rearranging my computer room, after getting everything where I wanted it and hooking everything back up, my 1TB hd is not recognized by the computer and when I turn it on, the blue light blinks and it continually beeps. </s>
<s> Running win XP Pro, P-4, 2.53, 2 G ram. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks, Bill </s>
<s> But at 2 months they should replace it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I will give that a try, thanks, Bob </s>
<s> I finally located the problem. </s>
<s> I did what you suggested Bob and nothing was any different. </s>
<s> I then disconnected everything in order to start again. </s>
<s> I found that I had two identical input power cords, I changed the two and everything is working fine. </s>
<s> Thanks, Bill </s>
