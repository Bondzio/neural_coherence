They are at the age now that they won't hold the cmos settings. The company says that they are the only ones who can replace the battery/cmos chip, and of course rather expensive. I have completely dismantled one and I can't find anything resembling a battery. I thought they might be using a cap but the one I see that is in the package I would expect is being used to filter the backlight. I have looked under battery, behind pcmcia slot, all around the screen and I am stumped. Any help would be appreciated.

Don't be cheap. Pay them for the answer. Bob

It is an integrated real time clock / battery used on some motherboards. An example is one that has the brand Dallas Semiconductors and has a drawing of a clock on it. I am surprised the Cmos battery is depleted on a recent tablet like the hh3.

It is the one with the RAM chips on it. The battery is on the bottom of the board. The battery is a Panasonic BR2330. Digi-Key part number P025-ND.
