1.1.1	Hello ALL , I could really use a computer , but I do n't know if I should wait until X-mas sales .	St
1.1.2	I would really like an HP high performance computer .	St
1.1.3	Should I wait for prices to tumble so I could get a quad core , or should I just get a dual core , probably AMD now ?	Ques
1.1.4	I 'll probably try and get 3gb ram , 500gb hdd , tv tuner , wireless , maybe a 19 & quot ; widescreen .	St
1.1.5	I want to render images , use CAD , and do other engineering related items .	St
1.1.6	ANY THOUGHTS ? ?	Ques
1.1.7	tHANKS	St
1.2.1	I see Quad Cores in sub 1K buck boxes .	St
1.2.2	Since this is not your price you only have to wait .	St
1.2.3	As to 3GB , I strongly suggest 2GB today if you are going to run the usual OSes .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I was thinking around a total price tag of $ 1000- $ 1100 , so the intel high performance gets close .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/cto/computer_customize_components.do I was really trying to ask if I should wait to get a quad core .	St
1.3.3	Will it be worth it ?	Ques
1.3.4	Or do you think that average person/engineering student would really benefit that much from a quad core ?	Ques
1.3.5	Also , why would you strongly recommend only 2gb ram ?	Ques
1.3.6	I will probably just run vista home premium .	St
1.3.7	Thanks for the reply !	St
1.3.8	!	St
1.4.1	The time between Thanksgiving and after New Years , is the most promising time to buy a new system .	St
1.4.2	During this time , offers will come and go , peaking at Xmas .	St
1.4.3	If you can wait , the deals , sales , reductions , etc. , should be numerous it is worth it .	Sug
1.4.4	Up to you .	St
1.4.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	It has to do with most people running 32-bit Windows .	St
1.5.2	Those that dare to run 64-bit Windows encounter issues you can research later .	St
1.5.3	But here 's the quick reasons for just 2GB .	St
1.5.4	1 .	St
1.5.5	Windows limits application memory to 2GB .	St
1.5.6	2 .	St
1.5.7	Even with the /3GB switch ( see XP 3GB on google ... ) the application must be compiled with a special switch or it still is limited .	St
1.5.8	3 .	St
1.5.9	Read posts about XP 4GB to see that some experience slower speeds with 4GB installed .	St
1.5.10	Today I advise to stop at 2GB unless you have done more research or will not complain about the known issues .	St
1.5.11	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks Bob ! !	St
1.6.2	I really appreciate it .	Polite
1.7.1	If you can show some real patience , wait until after Christmas Day and purchase between Christmas and New Years , they are really aggresive in marketing at that time and prices fall below those offered for Christmas .	St
1.7.2	There are some great deals on new items being returned and it seems like the retailer are always unloading inventories that were not sold before Christmas .	St
1.7.3	Good Luck	St
1.8.1	Hi , I worked in retail computers ( big box stores ) for awhile and the only & quot ; good & quot ; deals you get at that time of year are on the mid to low end and the & quot ; special , two days only & quot ; computers .	St
1.8.2	These will NOT have a graphics card and will have one to two cores and 512mb to 3 gb ram .	St
1.8.3	If you find a deal like the Gateway quad-core Gt 5628 ( best buy has this week ) I 'd get it .	St
1.8.4	Specs : Core 2 Quad Q6600 , 3gb DDR2 , 500gb H.Drive , Nvida Geforce 8500gt graphics card and a DVD/Cd burner Get it with the Samsung 2232bw 22 & quot ; mon .	St
1.8.5	and an Hp F4180 AIO for around $ 1250 .	St
1.8.6	Ends today however !	St
1.9.1	I really like hearing the feedback ! ! ! !	St
1.9.2	It 's greatly appreciated to hear some good opinions ! !	St
1.9.3	So , I was just wondering since you said USED TO WORK , did you really have that many high performance machines at your store .	St
1.9.4	I mean , the high performance machines coming out now , I believe but could easily be mistaken , are a fairly new thing .	St
1.9.5	I would think that bb or cc would have sales on all of there stuff around the holiday season .	St
1.9.6	thanks again in advance !	Polite
1.10.1	It appears that 3GB is the standard/default for new high-end HP Vista-32 desktop computers .	St
1.10.2	I would hope that somebody tweaked something to make them run reliably .	St
1.10.3	Any chance of that ?	Ques
1.11.1	They never have the really good sales on the hot rod computers .	St
1.11.2	( refer to my first post for type of computers that will be found on sale ) .	St
1.11.3	And yes , bb and cc ( I have worked for both ) has carried high performance computers .	St
1.11.4	bb once carried alienware and now has velocity micro and cc could do a build-to-order high performance computer and also now carries velocity micro .	St
1.11.5	Yes , the vast majority of retail computers do n't have a dedicated graphic card ( they have alway had one or two ) but most of those customers do n't play games and do n't want to spend 1100 to 5000 on a computer configured to play them .	St
1.11.6	Though check out the new acer ( 5630 ) that has a radeon hd 2400 for 750.00 .	Sug
1.11.7	You could alway build your own .	St
1.11.8	Check out tomshardware.com for ideas on low , mid and high cost gaming computers .	St
1.11.9	good luck !	Polite
