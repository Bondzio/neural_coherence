I want to get the Intel Core 2 Duo E7200 Wolfdale processor but it only came out last month and has not been validated with my board yet. Will I have to wait for validation by the board manufacturer? Other processors with similar specs work with this board as is. Here is the response from Gigabyte: hello, core 2 duo E7200 wolfdale with 3 MB cache is new still under validation may need bios update to support cpu ID code please check back with us a week later or keep an eye on this web for cpu support list after validation will listed in there : http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ProductID=2714

The mtrbd. support probably will issue a bios update and w/o that you're stuck at some lower level and thus no 100% benefit from the new cpu installed if it works at all. IF you have a problem then everyone in the loop expect you has an excuse. Effectively they'll blame you for rushing the issue as it wasn't proven yet, so they can back out of any &quot;warranty&quot; because you went in too soon. tada -----Willy
