i agree with the other replys, that your reported 100mhz buss speed is not something to worry about.
it is a multiple of 400 , and 800, so you are probably doing just fine.
it does get doubled then quad pumped to the memory buss on most motherboards.
on the cpu upgrade, make sure you have enough power supply, 350 watt will be good.
400 watt is even better if you want to overclock.
the newer processor will generate more heat, so be sure you have a good cooling fan and a well vented case.
additional case fans are good if you have the space to add them.
they are cheap insurance against component failure.
no advice on the cpu adapter kits....use caution.
