I have an HP Pavilion computer with windows ME operating system.
It is connected to an HP deskjet 932C printer.
For a while now, when I print in color, I find that I get pink and black, but no blue and yellow.
I uninstalled and then reinstalled the printer.
I used the toolbox to clean the cartridges and recalibrate the printer.
Since this has happened with two cartridges, bought at separate times, I don't think it's a cartridge problem.
I have also cleaned the surfaces around the cartridge with a damp rag.
Nothing has worked thus far.
Any suggestions would be most appreciated.
