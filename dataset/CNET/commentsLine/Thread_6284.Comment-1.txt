first off here is the basic configuration: amd athlon 2600 ati all in wonder 2006 edition 256mb 512m ddr ram asus motherboard 400 watt power supply promise ultra ide 100 controller (2)wd 160g ide drives 16x dvd rom 16x dual layer dvd writer maybe this is related to my other problem with the computer freezing after sitting idle for 20 minutes reboot and every thing is fine until the next idle period.when i tried to reboot into safe mode for defrag the mode starts to load drivers etc.
but then reboots to the startup choice screen again, does this with the command prompt choice also.when i choose to start windows normally it will start normally with the freezing problem later,if i keep working on the computer it doesnt freeze only when i leave it idle!thanks for any suggestions.
