Hoping that they would be safer on a seperate drive. Is this idea valid or not, and are there any other better ways to protect my files, other than the fact that I must back up my files. I do use an antivirus program and firewall,and don't download anything questionable.

Usually done in the small hours of the morning or due to a non-booting PC which someone installs the OS in hope of regaining access. Go ahead but keep in mind that it's not a backup. Bob

Another disk is partitioned for MP3s, another for Photos and another partitioned for Downloads only. I named another drive/partition &quot;Resources&quot; and I keep copies of XP PRO (the entire CD) and XP OFFICE and other data/files from other computers, etc. It is always a good idea to NOT use the entire C:\ for the operating system AND your programs because if it crashes then you are risking losing all your programs and data, etc.. If you partition enough room for the root drive (C:) and install programs, etc., on other drives/partitions, you will not lose as much.
