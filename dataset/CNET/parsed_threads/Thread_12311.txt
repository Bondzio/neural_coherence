<s> Hi all, I work in a production facility and a majority of my day is spent away from my desk either in meetings or out on the production floor. </s>
<s> While I am on the floor I get a lot of questions I am not able to answer because I cannot access my email (Microsoft Outlook), sharepoint sites, SAP etc. </s>
<s> This causes me to have to take notes, walk back to my desk and then follow up with the person later on. </s>
<s> This creates a lot of wasted time in my day. </s>
<s> I also use SAP heavily. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there are any tablets that are capable of doing a remote desktop back to my office where I could then use SAP on the floor. </s>
<s> If I was able to do a remote desktop it would probably be the best for me so I could keep all files on one computer and only use the tablet to link to my office while on the floor. </s>
<s> I would assume a tablet could not support having its own SAP program therefore I am pursuing the remote desktop. </s>
<s> So my question is there a tablet capable of remote desktop connection which is reliable and able to use SAP through the connection? </s>
<s> I would assume most any tablet could connect to sharepoint sites or Microsoft Outlook so my biggest question is being able to use SAP. </s>
<s> I also have a laptop but it does not work well on the floor because I usually do not have a place to set it down to work. </s>
<s> This is why I am pursuing the use of a tablet. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> Plenty out there. </s>
<s> If you mean best, Panasonic Toughbooks are best for such things. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.panasonic.com/business/toughbook/toughbook-products.asp#/U1 Bob </s>
<s> You could also try the ASUS EP-121 which is a Windows 7 tablet. </s>
<s> I have one that I use both for home and work which provides more versatility and flexibility. </s>
<s> Only disadvantages are its weight of 2.6lbs, battery life of 3.0 - 3.5 hours and of course the price of 1199.00 for the 64gb version which I recommend. </s>
<s> I comes with a leather cover, and Bluetooth keyboard with pen for writing. </s>
<s> I saw this post and thought I'd answer even though I am a year late. </s>
<s> I have been using &quot;jumpdesk&quot; app on my ipad, my iphone and my acer mini to get work done on the fly. </s>
