<s> I have an IDE hard drive that I'm trying to convert to SATA. </s>
<s> Here's the adapter I bought: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812206002 I connected the female molex into the HD but the other molex doesnt' connect with the SATA power cable. </s>
<s> It seems as if I need a 4 pin female to 15 pin SATA power adapter but can't seem to find one. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. </s>

<s> my logic tells me this is a ide harddrive so why do I need a special &quot;power&quot; cable? </s>
<s> The data cable may need to be different but not the power cable. </s>
<s> Call me dumb because I missed that when I first read it. </s>
<s> I agree--just connect the standard 4-pin Molex connector to the power adapter cable included with the device. </s>
<s> Connect the other ends of the power adapter cable to the hard drive and the device. </s>
<s> I hope you didn't do what I did. </s>
<s> I bought a new SATA II hard drive 300mb/per second transfer bla bla bla. </s>
<s> Installed it and then looked in device manager and realized I have a Ultra ATA Controller. </s>
<s> It's installed and works but because the controller is Ultra ATA I assume I am only going to get the old school speed of up to 100mb/per second. </s>
<s> Could have saved a few dollars maybe if I had done my research though. </s>
<s> FYI Western Digital Internal Hard Drive (WD2500KS) 300mb/s 16mb cache $89 at Circuit City </s>
<s> Even those SATA drives that have both type of power ports, they clearly say never hook power to both of them or damage may occur. </s>
<s> Also remember that both SATA and PATA BOTH are, IN FACT, IDE drives. </s>
<s> Hope that over time we start using PATA and SATA. </s>
<s> Hey Ahtoi, if you are Art from the zdnet forums, hello old friend. </s>
<s> I still like to give misinformation here now and then, lol. </s>
