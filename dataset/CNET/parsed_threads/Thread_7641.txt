<s> Hello, I'm looking for a good quality photo printer (5 or more colors) that will print on many types of media and up to 13x19 paper. </s>
<s> I've read the CNET editor recommendations, but I won't buy another Epson Stylus due to all the problems I've had with mine, the printer where I work, and those that my sister has experienced. </s>
<s> Canon's i9900 looked promising until I discovered one must use only Canon paper (how realistic is that!?). </s>
<s> I would appreciate any suggestions as I am completely without a printer now (the Epson Stylus 1280 I have has quit after three years of light use). </s>
<s> Thank you for any suggestions! </s>
<s> I too got fed up with the Epson. </s>
<s> I had two that failed after a short time with a printhead issue. </s>
<s> I switched to HP in order to avoid that. </s>
<s> If you want to be able to print 13x19, there will be fewer choices. </s>
<s> While I do not have one of these, here is a link to a review of one: http://www.steves-digicams.com/2005_reviews/hp8750.html Also, PhotoSmart printers can print directly from the camera, media or computer and this one (HP 8750)has built in network capabilities. </s>
<s> Of course with the capablility to print 13x19 pictures, you have to expect a pricetag that is hefty also. </s>
<s> Thank you for your suggestion. </s>
<s> I'm checking into it! </s>
