File system issue: Fat16 has a hard limit of 2gb in 9x and 4 Gb in NT based oses.
It is not fat 16.
Probably fat32.
from a run line type &quot;convert c:&quot;(or d: or whatever)&quot; /fs:ntfs&quot; to convert to ntfs.
Size: Is it 7.82 or 78.2 ?
Computers think in a base 2 system, so where we think 1000 MBs to a GB they think 1024.
So reporting is usally off because that.
