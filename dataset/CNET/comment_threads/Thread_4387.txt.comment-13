I think it depends on you taste...if you want a high-performance mean flexible lag free machine then choose i pad 3 ....but the problem or sometimes the advantage of i OS is that Apple had kept in a prison or a closed box so that nothing can affect you from outside...you are safe and secure whatever happens .....and i Tunes,and the well flourished application Eco system makes i pad 3 an irresistible choice.... but if u want a tablet with which u can do anything go 4 window 8 tab.....because you have the full freedom over the device...but may not delver the performance by apple`s i pad 3....but don't think that windows is low on performance...it will be equipped with high end hardware.... the choice is yours...both have their own merits and DE-merits....choose the one which suits you the best.... i ______________________________________________________________________________________________
