1.1.1	I am building a new computer, and purchased a dvd rom, and dvd burner (Sony DWU18ABK).	St
1.1.2	My motherboard (MSI K7N2 nVidia ILSR)has only one plug for audio for the master rom drive.	St
1.1.3	How do I connect these two and get sound from both, or do I not need to connect this 4 pin cable?	St
1.1.4	Any help is much appreciated.	St
1.1.5	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	Since DVD audio is played digitally, the cable in question is not required.	St
1.2.2	Even CD Audio could be played digitally so it's not needed.	St
1.2.3	Only when you play some CD Audio in analog mode will this be needed.	St
