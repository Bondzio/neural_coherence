I will be using it mainly for printing text and copying text for homeschooling purposes (one child). I'd like it to be able to: handle occasional cardstock sheets from printing or copying one ink cartridge fairly cheap (obviously color is optional) Automatic feed I need the printer to be fairly inexpensive as well. Max $170! And I don't want to have to replace the ink cartridge ALL the TIME. It won't get a ton of use but a fair amount. I have Windows XP if that helps any. I have reviewed a few different printers and can not decide between the HP Laserjet P1005 (which is not a copier) Or one of the All-in-One Canon Pixma MP520 or MP610. i don't really have use for photo printing since I send all that off to be done. So the all-in-ones seem like a waste of Money to me. So any other suggestions for me? Anyone? Thank you very much in advance!!

Get your cardstock poundage and then check the specs on the printers under consideration. Be aware that consumer printers that don't do photos will likely not be in the usual store shelves. I also see multifunction printers for under 99 bucks that last about 2 years. Why isn't that aceptable? In closing I set up the office and home with the HP k550. For scanning we use a scanner. Bob

It can print on thick paper, photo paper, etc. I usually get my photos printed at a place like Walmart, cheaper. Ink I purchase is around $23 a cartridge and I use the cheap ones. My printer is no longer made. Make a trip to Office Max or Staples and check out the printers and the prices of ink for them. A nice sales person should be willing to help you. Rick
