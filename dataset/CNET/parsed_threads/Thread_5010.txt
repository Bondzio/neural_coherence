<s> Alright, I have had a crappy G router from D-Link for a while and my desktop computer upstairs had a matching wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Just recently my adapter has been having issues with getting too hot, because I found that when it wasn't working it was hot and after it cooled it worked fine again. </s>
<s> Well, now it seems that it is becoming completely useless because it is pretty much broke and only allows a few minutes of internet use before having to unplug it and replug it back in. </s>
<s> If I was only to get a new wireless adapter right now, what kind should I get? </s>
<s> Also, if I was later to upgrade my router to an N router, would that wireless adapter be able to pick that signal up as well? </s>
<s> Im assuming that it doesnt matter, but Im not sure. </s>
<s> I've used D-link for years, once tried Linksys. </s>
<s> My current setup is the D-link DIR-655. </s>
<s> Wireless N Gigabit wired. </s>
<s> Zero problems. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys WRT350N in storage because it died and was replaced. </s>
<s> The replacement is what is in storage. </s>
<s> I have a Netgear Gigabit PCMCIA card in my ThinkPad laptop. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys EG1032 Gigabit PCI card in my server. </s>
<s> Stick with the brand names. </s>
<s> A wireless card is designed to run hot, you ought to feel the PC card in the laptop. </s>
<s> But a flaky solder joint will render any device broken. </s>
