i have a hard drive inside of a USB external hard drive enclosure.
I dont know what model it is, but its a 200GB seagate that was originally in a Hewlett packard laptop.
the other day it started making the clicking sound ive heard you never want to hear.
well I have tons of precious files on that hard drive... any ideas on what i can do to possibly recover all if not some of the files?
