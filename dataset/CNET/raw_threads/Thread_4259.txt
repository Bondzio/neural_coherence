Sometimes they start making strange noice, but that certainly isn't like chatting and voices. So I think nothing is wrong with your hard disk. Kees

I agree that HD never speaks but some motherboard does (like ASUS P4..). They have a system that speak (instead of beeping) when something is wrong.. this systen could be enabled and disabled trught the BIOS configuration and it is very useful to diagnostic problems. You must check your motherboard manual. The important isue here is: what the voice told you? It is the error report... according to that error you can identify the failure component, HDD, Video card, etc...

Turn-ON your PC and if the noises disappear then you know the HD is going bad or is bad. If the noise appears then likely a bad fan or similar, locate noise source. Now, if the HD is bad, then you need to replace it, provided you're capable. If you have warranty, use it. It appears if the HD is bad, it gone too far and physical damage, you probably can't recover data. If the noise is elsewhere, repair that, then retry powering-ON system and check results. Also, take notice of any heat build-up, as that alone can cause all sorts of issues with a failing HD and anything else in the system that it finds the weakest and generally heat will cause failure. So, take that into account if so found. It would be a good time to clean out your system case of any dust build-up and overall clean-up. tada -----Willy
