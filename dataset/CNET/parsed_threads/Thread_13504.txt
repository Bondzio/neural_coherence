<s> Hey, I am trying to connect a front panel (I'm not sure what type but it has 2 USB's, a mic, and a headphone jack. </s>
<s> The 2 USB ports seem to worl already but the headphone and mic have never worked. </s>
<s> I've recently discovered the retailer I bought it from didnt install it. </s>
<s> I went to attach the wires to the motherboard and when I opened up the computer I saw there were 2 blue caps or something blocking the motherboard connections. </s>
<s> They spanned 2 connections between BLINE_OUT_L and LINE out_L BLINE_OUT_R and LINE out_R Does anyone know what these are for and if I can remove them? </s>
<s> ASUS tech support isn't open right now and I'm anxious to do this. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It sure would be helpful if you supplied what system/mtrbd. </s>
<s> you have in order to get detailed help. </s>
<s> From what you described, now you know why the vendor didn't connect the leads to the audio, etc.. You should go back and see if they will replace the mtrbd. </s>
<s> with one that's more flexible to connects. </s>
<s> What do you mean by &quot;caps&quot;? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> oops, sorry, I forgot to mention it is a A8N-SLI premium motherboard from ASUS. </s>
<s> By caps I mean little blue things that over the pin sticking out of the motherboard. </s>
<s> One cap covers two pins with the arrangement I mentioned before. </s>
<s> They are easily removed with needle nosed pliers but I didn't try plugging the wires in yet for fear of breaking something. </s>
<s> I'm worried they might be required jumpers that connect the pins because there IS metal inside. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help </s>
<s> The &quot;caps&quot; are jumpers, and are sending the audio to the rear panel of your computer. </s>
<s> You'll need to remove the jumpers and attach the front panel wires to BLINE_OUT_L and BLINE_OUT_R. </s>
<s> Of course, this will disable your audio from the computer's back panel. </s>
<s> Yeap, those are &quot;jumpers&quot; as another poster mentioned. </s>
<s> You need the manual and get the details it supplies to &quot;find where&quot; the connection is for the frt. </s>
<s> panel. </s>
<s> Using the the Asus support website, find your exact model mtrbd. </s>
<s> and then if you don't have a manual get the d/l'able one and then print it out or review it on screen. </s>
<s> Once you locate the true location of the connections you need plus what or how it is connected w/o too much guess work. </s>
<s> I'm sure there is a location to be found or re-route it if it is already being used to the frt. </s>
<s> panel, rather than a rear location. </s>
<s> That is what the jumpers(caps) probably are intended to do. </s>
<s> Understand you don't connect to mthose jumpers but rather there is a dedicated connection for the frt. </s>
<s> panel, you may in fact be able to use both frt. </s>
<s> and rear connections, again this info is supplied by the manual. </s>
<s> Try this link for manual: http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=A8N-SLI%20Premium tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for all the great info guys! </s>
<s> I'm still kind of confused though. </s>
<s> I have the manual that came with the motherboard right in front of me and it shows to use the connections I said in the original post. </s>
<s> I don't see anything else in it where it shows a different set of connectors for front panels. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help though, I'll look again </s>
<s> Well, I removed the jumpers and then plugged in the connections and it works perfectly. </s>
<s> If I plug my headphones in the fron tthe speakers stop working and the audio goes to my headphones! </s>
<s> The retailer had wired the front audio to a 10pin connector so I was hoping that they had jumpered the pins inside the connector to replace the blue jumpers the manufacturer installed. </s>
<s> I guess they did. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help! </s>
