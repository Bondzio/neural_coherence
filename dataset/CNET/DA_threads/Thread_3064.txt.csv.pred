1.1.1	With that said I need some help on this.	St
1.1.2	It's time to upgrade but I really am not up on the current tech.	St
1.1.3	More over, my price range is limited with a baby on the way so those of you who are patient and want to help I'd more then welcome it.	St
1.1.4	I want to be able to play the new PC games so I want decent stuff but I know with my budget the latest and greatest is out of the question.	St
1.1.5	I want the best bang for my buck over all.	St
1.1.6	I was thinking of going with the Athalon 64 3200.	St
1.1.7	Is this a good plan?	Polite
1.1.8	(I love playing World of Warcraft and I want this to run smoothly) I also want to know what is the difference between socket 754 and 939 pin.	St
1.1.9	Now I've figured out I probably want 939 pin but I don't know why.	St
1.1.10	Finally on this topic, what does 90nm mean?	St
1.1.11	Do I want this or the standard Athalon 64 3200?	St
1.1.12	Ok, section 2 of Jon's PC building for idiots.	St
1.1.13	I need a good mother board recomendation for this processor.	St
1.1.14	Again, I want it to run games well but I don't need a ton of bells and whistles.	St
1.1.15	I'm trying to keep this as cheap as possible but still good enough to game on.	St
1.1.16	Finally, graphic card?	St
1.1.17	I found a Sapphire Radeon 9250 for $44.	St
1.1.18	That sounded like a great deal but will it hold up to the most current games out?	St
1.1.19	Can I run World of Warcraft on a high setting with this?	St
1.1.20	I've been told the PNY Verto nVIDIA 6800 GS is the best bang for my buck but I wanted to stay under $100 for a video card if possible.	St
1.1.21	Oh, and once we put something together here I'll need to know what power supply to run.	St
1.1.22	I'm sure I can figure out ram.	St
1.1.23	I have 2 hard drives and a well ventilated custom case.	St
1.2.1	And do you need Windows XP and a monitor?	St
1.3.1	I do have monitor and XP.	St
1.3.2	I have everything I need...a fully running box, I just need a new motherboard, processor, and video card.	St
1.4.1	Socket 754 is dead (no more from the production line).	St
1.4.2	That means replacement (and upgrade) CPU's and motherboards are becoming harder and harder to find.	St
1.4.3	Todays AMD desktop CPU's fit socket 939 motherboards.	St
1.4.4	Current popular AMD desktop product lines: - Sempron (budget, analogous to Intel Celeron) - Athlon 64 - Athlon 64 X2 (dual core) - Athlon 64 FX (gamer) More AMD product line info: http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118,00.html 130nm, 90nm, 65nm = Size of CPU die (in nanometers) - smaller is supposed to be cheaper, faster, cooler, and more efficient, but actual models don't always see all these benefits.	St
1.4.5	http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ComputingSolutions/0,,30_288_13265_13295%5E13337,00.html	St
1.5.1	Look for a motherboard with an nVidia nForce4 chipset.	St
1.5.2	Check NewEgg.com if you are in the USA.	St
1.5.3	Whatever fits your budget: - nForce4 - nForce4 Ultra - nForce4 SLI Descriptions: http://www.nvidia.com/page/mobo.html (Scroll down to the chart)	St
1.6.1	I forgot the nForce4 feature chart: http://www.nvidia.com/page/nforce4_family.html	St
1.7.1	DFI nf4 DAGF (board) AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ (processor) 2GB (2x1GB) Corsair XMS DDR400	St
1.8.1	Another question.	St
1.8.2	With this mother board: BIOSTAR TForce6100-939 Socket 939 NVIDIA GeForce 6100 Micro ATX AMD Motherboard Do I need a graphic card?	St
1.8.3	I noticed it doesnt have an agp slot and I really want to use this graphic card: PNY GeForce 6800 GS / 256MB GDDR3 / AGP 8x I've decided on these products so far: AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Venice 2000MHz HT Socket 939 Processor Model ADA3200BPBOX - Retail --$154.00 PNY GeForce 6800 GS / 256MB GDDR3 / AGP 8x / DVI / VGA / TV Out / Video Card -- $179.99 I need a suggestion on a good quality board preferably around $50 - $80 that will work with these two components.	St
1.9.1	The latest & greatest video card slot is PCI Express X16.	St
1.9.2	Video for gaming: worst &lt; integrated &lt; PCI &lt; AGP 8X &lt; PCI Express X16 &lt; best Note that &quot;PCI&quot; is not the same as &quot;PCI Express&quot; Also note that PCI Express X16 cards are just as inexpensive or even less expensive than AGP cards.	St
1.9.3	That particular motherboad has integrated GeForce 6100 video and a PCI Express X16 slot.	St
1.10.1	AGP is dead, and ATI/nVidia probably won't make any new cards for it.	St
1.10.2	For the price of the 6800GS, you should look at the 7600GT, or an X1800GTO with a large rebate.	St
1.11.1	Hi I am kind of in the same boat ...	St
1.11.2	I'm still using an Athlon XP 1800+ with a Via KT 266/333 chipset and that mobo does use AGP.	St
1.11.3	So, got a cheap eVGA FX5500 256mb card from newegg.	St
1.11.4	Having problems, think it's the motherboard and/or the chipset.	St
1.11.5	So, I'm going to probably be buying a cheap &quot;for now&quot; (like eMachine T6528) computer so we have something to use until I can get my custom built re-built.	St
1.11.6	Then figure out how to network the 2 computers.	St
1.11.7	I looked at the motherboard you chose, looked around and found this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128286#DetailSpecs About the same price.	St
1.11.8	If you already have an AGP card and need to upgrade this may work for you.	St
1.11.9	Personally, I'm reading everything review-wise I can on all the boards I'm looking at.	St
1.11.10	This site and google can be your friends.	St
1.11.11	The motherboard, processor and power supply from my (limited) understanding are the 3 most important components in your computer.	St
1.11.12	You don't have to pay top dollar for the latest or just for a name, but I believe it does pay to spend that little extra to get good quality.	St
1.11.13	Just my .02	St
1.12.1	I was trying to tell the poster that his chosen motherboard has integrated video and a PCI Express X16 slot, that AGP is less desirable than PCI Express X16, and why the consideration of an AGP video card on that motherboard is moot (no AGP slot).	St
1.12.2	Sorry for my vague post.	St
1.13.1	...why he would want AGP.	St
