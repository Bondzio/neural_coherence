i'm glad to see you mentioned both areas od ssds that made me nervous.
there were issues with many of the early ssds with regard to garbage collection.
at work, one manager had an ssd installed in his system.
it was an old 65 gb ssd.
i kept getting errors reported on a central log (for symantec a/v and one for wsus and patching) that the drive was full.
the manager told me i was nuts.
when i did get to look at the system, it ran so slow it was almost useless.
worse than an old floppy drive.
i refreshed the firmware in the drive and the thing now screams and all the errors are gone.
i know they have applications that keep track of your read/write cycles on an ssd.
ssds are coming down in price and, even if they don't have the lifespan of an hdd in terms of read/write cycles, nobody should ever put their faith in a computer component, especially a drive, is going to last for any length of time.
thats why we have raid systems and backup systems.
especially in the enterprise.
after all, one nasty piece of malware can lose all of your data for you even without dealing with heating/cooling and electrical issues (clean out those dust bunnies!)
good job and excellent references.
