The laptop is an HP Pavilion dv2315nr, and I'm using a Thermaltake Black Widow to extract the data, but I can't get the HDD to fit. I tried getting it to work with a discount enclosure from frys before, but I had the same problem and ended up snapping one of the brackets that holds the HDD into place. So now I can't get it to fit in this much nicer one and I'm clueless. Please I need your help badly, this HDD has important data to me! Joe

The HDD says Serial ATA, but it doesn't look like SATA I've got some pictures: http://www.flickr.com/photos/33154207@N07/
