difference too.
for 80-wire drive cables with three connectors (including the one for the mb), drive jumpering (using cable select- &quot;cs&quot; ) and drive placement on cable makes a difference in drive assignment/designation .
in this scenario, whenever drives are jumpered as &quot;cs&quot;...the drive at the end of the cable is designated as primary/master and the drive on the middle connector is designated as secondary/slave.
also....which drive channel the drive is physically connected to on the motherboard determines whether it's read as primary channel or secondary channel.
lots of different scenarios and options here.
maybe it would be simpler and help you get where you want to go if you tell us the problem you're trying to solve.
many intel systems have a secondary controller too so what's doing what drive may be more difficult to pinpoint the answer to your question.
