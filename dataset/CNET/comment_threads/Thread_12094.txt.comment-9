re question 3: I was wondering if it was possible to check the usb are actually 2.0, perhaps through control panel?
I live in Tokyo and I bought the machinee here, hence why the os is in Japanese.
If I am going to be looking around for the it will take me a while as my Japanese especially as far as computer terminology goes is limited.
Yes the os came with the machine.
Does this mean I dont have to look for the Drive and Disk Managment?
