Bob, OK I will search for the processors.
As to the DVR I was looking at the Hauppauge HVR 1250 card to process the cable signal and the tech said this: &quot;If that is a single core system then it is recommended to have a 2.2 GHz or higher anything lower can cause issues such as stuttering video.
If you have a good video card to pull some of the strain off the CPU then it could possibly work in that system but if not you will most likely experience some issues.&quot; This is digital and analog capable, but I could go down to just analog since I will be recording off my cable.
Compaq has integrated video processor which is crap.
I'm all ears if you have a better plan.
Thanks again, Ken
