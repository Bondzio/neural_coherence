<s> I am working on this machine and all it does is count the memory up to 256 in the upper left corner. </s>
<s> When it reaches 256 it just stops there and leaves a blinking cursor underneath. </s>
<s> The person this computer belongs to mentioned that the keyboard has been acting up. </s>
<s> I am using a totally different(and brand new keyboard) and nothing. </s>
<s> Is it possible that something happened to the port on-board so that now the keyboard cannot work? </s>
<s> I can get the files off by putting this hard drive into one of my dummy machines, but should I tell this person to start shopping for a new PC? </s>
<s> I really can't see it being anything else but the keyboard port. </s>
<s> I even reseated all the cards and memory and still no luck. </s>
<s> Any advice/suggestions are greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> :-) Thanks Ekaba </s>
<s> try resetting it manually at the Cmos jumper. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Since the keyboard seems to be the problem, I can't even access the BIOS. </s>
<s> I asked the person about the memory or anything else new he may have tried to put into the PC, but he states that nothing new has been added. </s>
<s> He only says that over the past few weeks the keyboard has been acting up and now the PC cannot get past the POST. </s>
<s> Any other ideas what it may be? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
