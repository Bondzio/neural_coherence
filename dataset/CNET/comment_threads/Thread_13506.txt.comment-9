I'm running ZoneAlarm as well (on both the &quot;host&quot; computer and &quot;client&quot;) - and can access the shared printer without a problem.
You may want to try turning off ZA (briefly) on the client computer and trying to access to see if it makes a difference.
You can turn off ZA by right-clicking on the ZA icon in the system tray and selecting &quot;Shutdown ZA.&quot; You may also want to check to make sure your home wireless network is in the Trusted Zone (double-click on the ZA icon in the system tray, click on the &quot;Firewall&quot; tab/button on the left side of the ZA panel, then click on the &quot;Zones&quot; tab).
