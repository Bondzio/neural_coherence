I thought I had good air flow but after a failure I decided to record the HDD temperature.
49C (120F).
Way too hot.
Ended up installing a cooling fan and the temperature dropped to 33C.
I wrote an article about my experience.
See http://temperature.insmart.com/hddheat.html Can supply cheap temperature recorders if anyone needs one.
