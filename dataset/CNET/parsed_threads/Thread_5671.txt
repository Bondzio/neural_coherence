<s> Hi, I built a pc a couple of years ago, with a Gigabyte motherboard, GA-7DX, 1GHz AMD processor. </s>
<s> It has been working fine, until recently, when it refuses to boot up upon pressing the power button. </s>
<s> Initially i thought it may be a power problem, and indeed it still may be but i'm not sure. </s>
<s> Basically when i press the power button nothing happens except for a single green light comes on (a light on the motherboard) which i believe is the DIMM led. </s>
<s> So power does reach the board, but it doesn't boot up, any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks Adrian </s>
<s> The real test here is to get it to beep. </s>
<s> No beeps means dead CPU, power supply or motherboard most of the time, but you have to strip it down to ... Motherboard, CPU+HSF, power supply and the speaker. </s>
<s> No cards, IDE cables, no video card, no RAM, nothing but four parts. </s>
<s> If it beeps, good. </s>
<s> If not, you are looking at the four possible bad parts. </s>

<s> I have tried the beep test and it does not beep. </s>
<s> Is there any way to test which is the bad part without purchasing new equipement, or will I have to purchase new equipement to test which part is bad? </s>
<s> Thanks Adrian </s>
<s> This is where a service shop has the advantage. </s>
<s> But at an average 120 dollar bill, you might beat them on that price even if you had to buy a new power supply, motherboard and CPU. </s>
<s> Since it's an AMD CPU and those do fry in under 1 second if the heatsink is not on proper, it's my first guess. </s>
<s> Next is the power supply which you can test on another machine (spare parts? </s>
<s> ), but at 20-30 dollars for a 450 Watt PSU, that may be your first choice. </s>

<s> I know it has taken its time but.... </s>
<s> I purchased a new power supply and connected it all together, and it seem to be booting fine into windows, however something started to smell like it was burning so i switched it off. </s>
<s> Now when i switch it on, i get a repeated beep noise (about 3-4 seconds) I've had a quick look around, and since my bios is a award bios, most sites tend to say that the beeping either means its a memory or a graphics card problem.... </s>
<s> Which one is it more likely to be because i don't have spare parts to check etc and could that be what i smelt burning. </s>
<s> I can't smell anything burning anymore when i switch comp on... </s>
<s> Thanks Adrian </s>
<s> One of the problems at the office is we often buy 6 or more of the same board or such. </s>
<s> A batch of motherboards began to have issues, but not before we lost a few power supplies. </s>
<s> Finally I looked deeper and sure enough the motherboard had the BAD CAP problem. </s>
<s> These bad capacitors not only cause booting issues that subside with bigger power supplies but can cause smoke and board scorch marks as the bad capacitors degrade and fail. </s>
<s> Some short out and do other bad behaviours. </s>
<s> Out of that batch of boards (6), only 2 are still running and we were able to find replacement motherboards so we'll swap those out if (and when) they glitch. </s>
<s> Here's a site and pictures about this issue -&gt; http://www.badcaps.net/ Bob </s>
<s> Allow me to add to what Robert has mentioned. </s>
<s> I believe the problem to be, &quot;twofold&quot;. </s>
<s> Now, that you've replaced the power supply, the mtrbd. </s>
<s> fault was finally finished and it may have taken the new p/s with it. </s>
<s> OR the p/s was bad to begin with and took the final stage of the mtrbd. </s>
<s> along with it. </s>
<s> What happens to you is common, especially with power problems. </s>
<s> If it is a bad cap, then unless you're willing to repair and hope for the best, I suggest to move on and get a mtrbd. </s>
<s> replacement. </s>
<s> The 1ghz AMD cpu was very demanding and to keep it may not be cost effective in the long run. </s>
<s> Sorry, but that's IMHO more trouble than its worth, because now you ned to fix the mtrbd.(caps?) </s>
<s> and buy yet another p/s to continue on. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
