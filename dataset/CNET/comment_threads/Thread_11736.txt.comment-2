I have the same setup as you.
Dell Dimension 8100 series, pentium 4 1.5gHz 256mg pc800 rdram, running windows XP with same video card.
I would like the same question answered and if we need to upgrade the video card before getting the 19&quot; flat panel.
I am looking at the same flat panel also.
Let me know if you find a great price and have you seen the panel in person.
I live 120 miles from the nearest dell store where I could view such a monitor.
Thanks in advance.
Roy
