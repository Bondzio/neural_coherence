ok, i've found some 60x60x25 fans i can get for cpu cooling.
my existing fan is a dc 12v and .12a.
do i need to be worry about about staying with a fan that is still .12a?
or can i get one that runs higher?
what kind of rpms do i need?
my existing fan is an avc model c6025b12l.
thanks in advance to anyone who has anything to contribute.
