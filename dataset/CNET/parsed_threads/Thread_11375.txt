<s> Hello, I'm a high school student, and I was woundering what type of motherboard/CPU combo would be something that I could afford. </s>
<s> I don't really want to spend more than $300 on the pair. </s>
<s> I am a gamer, I would like to have Serial ATA, Raid 0 + 1, and at least 4 slots for memory(specificly DDR400), AMD hopefully, and other goodies like that. </s>
<s> What would be the best bang for the buck for the things that I would like? </s>
<s> Also, i would like a bios that i can overclock with, and set memory timings. </s>
<s> selection of mobo's at http://www.tomshardware.com and http://www.anandtech.com You see all details and pro's and cons. </s>
<s> Generally in groups by CPU or by chipset. </s>
<s> Tomshardware is an excellent source for information. </s>
<s> Pricewatch searches many different sites for the best prices for a lot of stuff. </s>
<s> Newegg's prices are very competitive. </s>
<s> I would recommend getting it there if it is only a few dollars more than somewhere else. </s>
<s> Hi, Also check out Tirger direct thay have a lot of cpu and motherboard combos, an AMD 64 bit processor and MB for under $300. </s>
<s> If there is a FRY's electronics close by the have many combo specials also Newegg is very good also. </s>
