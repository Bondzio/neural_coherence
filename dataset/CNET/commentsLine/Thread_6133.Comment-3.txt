i've made up my mind about the cpu- amd athlon 64 fx-55 proccesor and the nvidia geforce 6800 ultra or not dont really matter.
the case i dont really mind anything.
but i dont have any clue of what ram i should get or what is mobo, since im like one of those computer dead guys, lol, thx for the suggestions though, im getting closer to actually deciding everything.
