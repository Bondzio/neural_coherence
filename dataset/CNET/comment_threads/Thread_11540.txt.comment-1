If theres anyone there using dell xps Gen3.
I have a problem in accessing the cdrom drive.
the problem is it can read DVD Disc but it cannot read or write CD disc.
I might say I'm out of option.
I have already uninstall and re-install the drivers still it doesn't work.
I hope somebody outthere can help me on this and it will be highly appreciated.
thanks.
