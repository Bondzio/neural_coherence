1.2.1	I use two devices .	St
1.2.2	One is a simple CD/DVD reader and the other a burner .	St
1.2.3	The burner type depends on your needs .	St
1.2.4	One reason for this is so disks can be duplicated by copying directly to the burner and bypass the need to copy to the HD first .	St
1.2.5	I't just my personal choice .	St
1.3.1	With dual layer DVDRW drives under 99 bucks ( much less ) I can fit one of those and do-it-all .	St
1.3.2	Since a DVDROM drive can do all a CDROM can do and more , that may be in the second bay for easy CD dupes .	St

1.4.1	My experience tells me that a simple CDROM drive is much more capable of reading scratched or otherwise & quot ; damaged & quot ; disks than a writer or a combo .	St
1.4.2	I find that utilities like CDR Diagnostics , ISO buster etc are able to handle a wider range of the so called dead CD 's in a simple CDROM drive than in other combined drive/writers .	St
1.4.3	As far as DVD 's go , I 'm not ready to make any observation as of now .	St
1.5.1	I 've found CDRW drives to be more adept at reading so-so CDs .	St
1.5.2	My experience with the newer DVDRW drives is & quot ; not enough time yet & quot ; to write if I feel the same for them .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I want to take this time to thank everyone for their comments .	St
