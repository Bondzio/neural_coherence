Read the tutorial again.
When you recover those files it writes them to some other drive.
Think about this.
The drive does not need to be fully working to recover files.
Why I write this is that some folk didn't know that when we recover files we don't always fix the issue with the drive.
That is, we recover the data, then may format the drive and copy the files back onto the drive.
