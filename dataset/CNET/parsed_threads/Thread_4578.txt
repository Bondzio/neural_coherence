<s> I have a DSL router/modem Actiontec M1000 from Qwest. </s>
<s> It has a wifi dongle-bopper, and a single LAN port that I have connected to a TP TL-R860 router, to which I have connected all my hard wired devices. </s>
<s> I need to be able to network the wireless devices connected to the Actiontec M1000 and the wired devices on the TPLink subnet. </s>
<s> Details: Actiontec M1000 (with wifi dongle) WAN address assigned by PPPoE, irrelevant. </s>
<s> LAN address 192.168.0.1 Wireless devices are on this 192.168.0.0 subnet. </s>
<s> There is no way to assign IP addresses to specific devices, i.e. </s>
<s> no DHCP reservations with this firmware. </s>
<s> TPLink TL-R860 (no wifi) WAN address assigned by M1000, 192.168.0.2 LAN address 192.168.1.1 Hard wired devices are on this 192.168.1.0 subnet I can reserve DHCP addresses by MAC address. </s>
<s> Questions: 1) I need to allow the wireless devices (laptops, tablet) on the M1000 network to access printers (Jetdirect networked HP 1320n) and devices (Pogoplug, Roku, desktops, etc.) </s>
<s> I have added this route to the M1000: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0/192.168.0.2 But cannot connect from the wireless devices (192.168.0.0 subnet) to the wired devices (192.168.1.0) subnet. </s>
<s> Is it even possible with my configuration? </s>
<s> If so, what am I missing? </s>
<s> 2) Since I cannot assign IP addresses on the M1000, can I set the DHCP IP range to say, 192.168.0.3-100, and set my TPlink router with a static WAN IP of 192.168.0.2? </s>
<s> (So that IP is not assigned to another devices, and mess up the M1000 routing table.) </s>
<s> Would the M1000 be &quot;aware&quot; of this setting? </s>
<s> Can I add an entry to the routing table to make it aware? </s>
<s> Notes of some relevance: I do not have the firewall or any security enabled on the TPLink router. </s>
<s> I have no problem connecting to the internet with any devices. </s>
<s> I previously have set the M1000 as a transparent bridge, and it worked fine and would continue to be so if not for the need of the wifi capability of the M1000. </s>
<s> The TPlink router is wired-only. </s>
<s> I have considered disabling DHCP on the TPLink router, having it act like a switch and getting addresses from the M1000, but I sorta need static, assignable addresses for my wired network. </s>
<s> (Specifically for setting up a web server for Roksbox and Roku.) </s>
<s> And, like I said, the M1000 is not capable of reserving DHCP addresses with this firmware. </s>
<s> Just set the IP addresses manually? </s>
<s> I can't hold the full class on IP networking here but even with DHCP enabled nothing stops you from setting the IP addresses manually on a server. </s>
<s> As to no wifi on the tplink, routers in my town start at 20 bucks so why not sell off that POC and get what you really want? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I agree with Bob. </s>
<s> You can, as you mentioned, disable DHCP on the TPLink. </s>
<s> Connect routers LAN to LAN (not WAN to LAN). </s>
<s> Adjust the DHCP range on the Actiontec and set manual IPs on 192.168.0.x but outside the DHCP range on the devices that need it. </s>
<s> All devices will then be on the same 192.168.0.x subnet. </s>
<s> Should be a straightforward setup with no new equipment if that's what you're after. </s>
