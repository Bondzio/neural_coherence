if you do a lot of printing, say 500 or so a month, you would be better off going to a laser printer instead of an inkjet.
the most ink forgiving inkjet printers are probably the hp units that use the 02 series cartridges(more for home use) or the 88 series (geared more toward light office use)kodak has a couple of all in ones that are claimed to be much cheaper to run but there have been some software issues with them, supposedly the glitches have been worked out.
but again, for quantity a laser is more efficient but way more expensive (especially color all in ones} and the cartridges are pricey.
