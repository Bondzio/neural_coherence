<s> Hi everyone I have a plextor PX-712A drive. </s>
<s> It does not read some dvd roms which other drives are able to read. </s>
<s> When i insert that DVD rom in the drive the drives LED blinks with an orange colour (Orange colour usually indicates that there is some problem with the Disc). </s>
<s> The discs are fine as they have not much scratches on them. </s>
<s> Some people told me to clean the lens using a lens cleaner CD. </s>
<s> I used it but it didnt work. </s>
<s> My system info is: 1Ghz intel celeron Windows Xp professional 256mb ram 40 GB harddisk Dvd burner PX-712A. </s>
<s> What should i do. </s>
<s> Your suggessions are highly appreciated. </s>
<s> Let me add one thing to the above initiated discussion that when i insert the disc for the first time the drive does not read the disc by blinking the LED but then after i insert it three four times again at last the drive starts reading the disc. </s>
<s> But this is true only for some discs but others are not read by it even on repeated insertions. </s>
<s> Need more info. </s>
<s> What OS, what type of pc, how old is drive, does it read any disks at all? </s>
<s> Thanks, Paul </s>
<s> Didn't see your info the first time...however does it read any disks at all? </s>
<s> Thanks again, Paul </s>
<s> It reads all the cds but when it comes to DVDs it reads only some. </s>
<s> It reads some others when inserted for the fifth or sixth time </s>
<s> What you are saying is, it reads most cds, and not certain dvds. </s>
<s> I noticed you said the disks are fine, not &quot;many&quot; scratches. </s>
<s> DVDs are a fussy disk. </s>
<s> I have many dvds and let me say, one scratch in the wrong spot will keep it from playing in my DVD drives as well, or takes a few times to open them. </s>
<s> Some drives will play a scratched DVD while others can be a bit more fussy. </s>
<s> Most of my old cds that are scratched badly , still play with ease. </s>
<s> This has to do with the format of the disk also. </s>
<s> Since the format of a DVD is (well, let's just say more condensed for now) it is also vulnerable to lighter scratches as the laser spreads even a bit and is unfocused, the DVD will skip, not play right away, or at all. </s>
<s> CDs are not so(once again just for purpose sake) condensed and have a slightly better range for margin of error. </s>
<s> This is currently my take on your problem but others may have another idea. </s>
<s> I just feel if it was in fact the player, it wouldn't work at all. </s>
<s> Also, it may be the software you use. </s>
<s> Some won't play certain regions as to where some play more. </s>
<s> This is my take on it. </s>
<s> Others may have other suggestions but I do feel this is what's happening. </s>
<s> Take care, Paul </s>
