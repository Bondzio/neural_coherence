Thanks for your advice.
It is really confusing because my HP network sharing center has the network in my name and the McAfee has it in his name.
I also wanted to ask this, The network is stating it is public.
Should I make it private or keep it public?
It is only me and his laptop a desktop and the printer we share and a Roku device.
And I am not going to Starbucks any time soon to use my computer.
