<s> what do you think which one is better the canon pixma MP500 or the hp C6180 i dont really need the fax but i want the one that has a better quality in the photo printing and has a better cd/dvd printing ability what do you think i need to buy? </s>
<s> Okay, first the MP500 is not available from Canon as a new printer any more. </s>
<s> It has been replaced by the MP 510 and MP 530 (with fax). </s>
<s> Now owning the the MP 530, and knowing what I do about the ink cartridges, the Canon is a better value than the HP. </s>
<s> However, the HP will do a good job on photos. </s>
<s> If cash is not a problem, and you want the best AIO without a fax look at the Canon Pixma MP960. </s>
<s> Look at what you really want to do, neither of the ones you want will print directly on photos, only Epson's will that I know of. </s>
<s> The HP isn't bad, but the cartridges will end up costing you more in the long run. </s>
