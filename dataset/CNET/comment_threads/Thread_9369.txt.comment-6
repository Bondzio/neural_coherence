Since you've uninstalled SP2, I would uninstall the device, then re-install.
I'm not sure about the Multimedia Device with the question mark.
Could be onboard audio, or may be related to the sound card.
I always try to eliminate all question marks by reinstalling.
I'm unsure if this will solve the problem, but it's easy enough to try.
