I need some assistance as how to connect it via USB.

You need a firewire hook up, not sure what the unit has for output, either 4 or 5 pin. The pc has to have a firewire hook up as well. Basically it is a matter of getting the right cable and of course your computer having firewire capability. Could it be used as a web cam, possibly. Check the unit manual and specifications. It would be easier, unless you have the hardware, firwire card in computer and proper link cable, to buy a usb web cam, they are cheap and readily available.

The camera is web enabled as this can be set in the camera menu. 02. I have obtained the correct Firewire cable. 03. 2 of the three PC's I have do have Firewire connections. I'm surprised that the HP Compaq (The latest purchase) does not have Firewire. I would have though all new PC's would have this as a standard. I will give this a try now and see how things work out. I have been told that using a digital video camera as a webcam provides far superior image compared to the usual webcams on the market.
