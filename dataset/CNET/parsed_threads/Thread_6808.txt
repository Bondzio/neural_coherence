<s> Hello, I have been looking for quite a while for a fairly high end grahics card plus a tv tuner that is for a PCI-Express machine. </s>
<s> I know there at some out there such as ATI All-in-Wonder X1800, but I am really looking for a tv in, as well as a tv out, so i cant hook it up to my tv while recording tv, or play doom III on the tv as well. </s>
<s> Does such a product exist, or do i have to break up my grahics card and tv turner to get the tv out feature? </s>
<s> Thanks Matt </s>
<s> http://www.ati.com/products/radeonx1900/aiwx1900/specs.html it features: - tv in and tv out - tv recording - tv as second monitor a regular tv tuner card is an input only device. </s>
<s> but most all modern graphics cards that support dual monitors have tv out capability. </s>
<s> do you know if XL1800 does the same thing as the XL1900? </s>
<s> If so, what the major deference it features </s>
<s> xl1800 and xl1900 are not ati a-i-w model numbers. </s>
<s> here's what available in the a-i-w lineup. </s>
<s> all will have more/less the same video/tv features. </s>
<s> the differences will be with the graphics processors. </s>
<s> + x1900 a-i-w is the top of the line and great for gaming ($450) + x1800xl a-i-w is last year's model and good at gaming ($350) + x800xl a-i-w is older tech but is still a good midrange gamer ($300) + a-i-w 2006 edition is the current product but with a very low end graphics chip (x1300). </s>
<s> it's not really suitable for gaming imho. </s>
<s> ($180) </s>
<s> Hey, thanks alot for the information, it def helped </s>
