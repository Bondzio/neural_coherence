hi guys, i'll make this quick.
basically i want a tablet that has to be 10+ inches (so no small nexus 7's (don't see the point in a small tablet) and i would like it too be pretty quick.
so dual core and some sort of tegra.
but the main thing (unless you can persuade me otherwise) is i want a high res screen.
(i played on my friends ipad 2 and being able to see the pixels really annoyed me) the best fit i can find is the nexus 10,. however it's out of my price range.
