1.1.1	Spyware Strike has invaded my XL taskbar by placing an unwanted and unauthorized icon on the taskbar.	St
1.1.2	Normal means of removing the icon are useless, as any click on the icon connects to their website where the SpywareStrike software is downloaded to your system.	St
1.1.3	I don't know why they think that putting their malware on my computer is going to make me feel comfortable about letting them remove everybody elses malware, but apparantly they think that showing me how powerful they are will make me love them - WRONG!	St
1.1.4	Is there any way I can remove their malware without having to click on it?	St
1.2.1	Try EWIDO from google.com	St
