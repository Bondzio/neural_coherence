has master, and slave printed on it, which is what concerned me.
now i'm guessing that it means master and slave for cable select, or for normal settings.
jumpered in a hdd from an &quot;antique&quot; compaq about a month ago, to copy some files, and set it to slave.
all worked fine, so guess the main hdd is set as master.
i'll try it as cable select, when i get the new drive, but may have to get a new power supply first.
have a 300 watt supply now, supposedly certified for p4, and athlon, but don't want to push it.
appreciate the reply.
