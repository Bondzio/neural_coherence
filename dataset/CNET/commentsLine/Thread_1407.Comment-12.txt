mostly when we install the intel accelerator software but that's for intel based boards.
or when we use odd raid or other controllers.
for those i have to ask the maker for guidance to find where they moved the dma tab.
the issue is not simple.
xp will degrade the dma from say 5 to 0 and not tell the owner.
read  for more pictures to see where this setting is.
