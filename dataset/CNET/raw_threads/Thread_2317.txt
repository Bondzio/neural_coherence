Of course I want it all. Great gaming, and great video editing. What should I go with? I'm even up in the air about Athlon vs P4. I read Maximum PC and they area praising the AMD stuff right now and suggest waiting for the new dual core chips from Intel to come out. I've always had Intel Inside so I'm somewhat biased. TIA Shawn

My suggestion build your own. A list of parts would be avilable upon request and $1500 is all you need for just the computer. Roger

I've done everything to an exsisting computer aside from changing the power supply and the motherboard. I have never built a tower either so I would have that built for me as well. I'm leaning toward the top end athlon 64, definitely need 2GB of ram. I would rather have one really fast HD for video editing and game playing and another for mainly storage of MP3 warez etc.

They had versions to test. The AMD left Intel looking bad. When one takes into account the terribly high power consumption of the Intrels there seems to be no choice. You do have to cool them you know. The Intel consumes more power at idle than the AMD at peak. And to hold their heat down, Intel has to run the processor slower than their single core [3.2 vs 3.8]. Notice also, that since the AMD has the MCH in the CPU die, the Nvidia 4 Chipset for the AMD is a single chip, while for the Intel it is still the Northbridge and southbridge. Yes Intel calls the MCH and IOCH.

Configure a high end Dual Core now with Intel: http://www.velocitymicro.com/wizard.php?iid=20 (don't forget dual WD Raptor 10,000RPM Hard Drives) Or wait to see what they come up with for AMD's new 'dual core' processors. AMD has previously announced that they will not consider their top FX 55 for dual core until games for dual core are out. Intel has been working on that also: http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050308net.htm?iid=search&

If I go with the THERMALTAKE Silent Purepower W0014RU ATX 480W Power Supply 100 - 240V will that work with the dual vids and the 4800? Thanks again Shawn

6465	12	105053	1210810	1210771	John Robie	5/26/05 11:42 PM	1.11715092E12	It is not clear to me that a Dual Core Athlon	processor can be thrown into just any current Athlon motherboard. From what I understand the new AMD Dual Core Processors can be installed in a socket 939 motherboard and be activated through the BIOS. As to the details, I would suggest contacting AMD for clarification on which current motherboards. The pricing is supposed to be: $1001 = 4800 $803 = 4600 $581 = 4400 $537 = 4200 respectively, in 1000 unit quantities According to Ray Harinec..... &quot;AMD's dual core isn't due until late 3rd quarter, early fourth.&quot;
6465	13	105053	1211078	1210771	Ray Harinec	5/27/05 5:53 AM	1.11717318E12	As John says, only the socket 939	mobos. Of course at that time a BIOS update will be required. Consider the two top Abit mobos, the fatality or the SLI. High price but ready for the future. very highly rated in testing sites. And the heat that the Intel Dual cores put out would scare the hades out of me. My thoughts are that Intel will almost force one to go to a BTX style system [new case, new mobo, new HSF et al. [of course Intel has been pushing the BTX spec, and vendors have tried to ognore them. a little like the Intel insistance on sticking to rambus memory until****. There are some BTX cases available now. The mobo goes in from the right side rather than the left as the current ATX's go. Change will continue to happen, simply progress, can't fight it.

Tom's and other such sites get actual devices from the mfrs to use before they are generally available, so they are actually testing the real devices. The heat issue will floor you.

For my third system, I thought, &quot;What the heck; I spend so much time tinkering around with this stuff, how hard can it be?&quot; The hardest part was getting SP1 loaded on a 200GB Harddrive--Bill used all kinds of subtefuge to get me to buy into SP2, but I resisted. SP1, without a patch, can't handle the Large harddrives (I can't exactly remember what the limitation is, but it's less the 200GB). Anyway, I paid twice as much money for a fundamentally limited Gateway in 1998. Then, thinking to outfox the limitations, in Feb 2004, I bought an &quot;expandable&quot; e-Machine advertised at PC 3200+. I could never figure out how the nVidia chipset, rated by the nVidia people, the FIC mobo assembly people, and the AMD designers; all three of these entities said this was 400 FSB / 3200+ (eMachine said it was a 3200+ machine as well--it just couldn't handle FSB over 333 (does anyone see a problem?). Somehow, e-Machines was able to downsize the FSB to 333 DDR (I had two 512 DDRs for 2 slots). I had been reading the wrangling about whether this is a PC2700 or a PC3200 that I had. I got a good price on a pair of Crucial 1GB 400 DDRs and decided to take the chance. Wrong. The BIOS recognized the 2048MBs of 400DDR, but as soon as I would plug in my AGP (I was giving the system it's enema and because the MoBo was designed w/ nVidia integrated video, I had to set the rest of the stuff up. then, load the nVidia video drivers for the AGP card. Before rebooting to the new drivers, I had to disable the onboard nVidea drivers. OK so far--AGP drivers loaded fine, the 400DDR was up and running so I'd power off, unplug the power, pop the AGP card in, plug it back up, power it up and everything would load properly until it came time to adjust the new AGP card setting--Bam--BSOD. After running in that circle for 2 or 3 times, I said, &quot;Screw this--I'm going to either mess up the new memory or my AGP card & maybe the sound card--who knows? I need 64 bit processing anyway (need? BS; I wanted it!). Down to the local store, bought an ABIT mobo w/ a 64 bit, true pc 3200+ for that Socket 939. No more Socket A for me. True, that set me back a few bucks, but the total expenditure on MoBo & Chipset was less than a 4th of what I spent on the eMachine. No more trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. I snatched out the new 200GB HD I had installed in the eMachine, it's unappreciated new 400DDR mem mods 2GB or did I say that, the 52x (at the top) CD burner/DVD reader. The sound card (and I think that's it). I kept the eMachine's DVD read/readwrite/re-write (or whatever) drive. I forgot--I also took the PCI USB/Firewire card to put in the new system. So, for about 350 bucks (I think) plus all the good stuff already bought and paid for that was wasted on the eMachine, I now have a system that screams. I'm not a gamer, but this setup could be competetive--replace the 128MB video card w/ 850 dollars worth of video card (at that price, take your choice), and you've got a gamer. I guess I'd also have to go to Serial ATA (the ABIT board can Serial built-in but my harddrives are IDE) or a bunch of tiny hard drives--my 200GB is like a 747 flying against a squadron of F16s. Isn't that what a SCUZZY really is? However, if you don't feel like tinkering w/ your computer, go ahead & buy the eMachine. They are a very good buy--just don't plan to upgrade. You get what you pay for and eMachine gets the most out of the little material that they've put in--hat's off on that count. I'll never buy another pre-assembled desktop (I'll be forced to replace my laptop in about 18 mos & I can't assemble one of those--I'm too clumsy).

Keep the suggestions coming, extremely helpfull. I like the fatal1ty from aBit, think I will go with that. I've been a maximum pc fan / boot reader for sometime and seem to be in love with it. I'm not much of a gamer at this point, but I know I will be when I get the system. are the vid cards dual slot? If so, is dual PCIe needed or even available at this point? Shawn

Just the thought of running 4 cpus at once makes me drool. Sure the motherboard alone is $1,500.00 but if u got the money, it would be amazing to have. 10 friggin ram slots, a total of 32gb of ram supported!! 4 AMD Opteron 800 processors. Its expensive, and sure you wouldnt need it, but damn id love to see anyone top you with that. But in serious terms, you should go for a dual intel computer with a nVidia 6800gt graphics card, and as much ram as you can fit on there.
