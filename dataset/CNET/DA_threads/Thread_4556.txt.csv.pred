1.2.1	Your Pavilion ZE4200 - found the computer listed on HP.com - HP 's memory configurator listed a Pavilion ZE4100 and a ZE4300 , but no ZE4200 !	St
1.2.2	- Crucial.com ( memory company ) did n't have it listed !	St
1.2.3	- Kingston.com ( memory company ) has upgrade info .	St
1.2.4	Here 's what Kingston has to say : - two memory slots - maximum memory is 1GB ( 512MB x2 ) - type : PC2100 ( 266MHz SODIMM ) See for yourself : http : //www.kingston.com	St
