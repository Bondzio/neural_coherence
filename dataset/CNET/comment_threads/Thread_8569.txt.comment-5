Willy, yes that is the card.
As I said, there is an unused 4 pronged inline plug available but that would not fit the card nor even reach it.
I am hoping RS has the plug available when I go back.
Thanks for the help.
As for the internal DVD vs external, I wrestled with that but went with an external ( even though they are more expensive) because I have 2 other computers ( a laptop and another desk top) neither of which has a dvd burner, so I figured I would be able to use the 1 burner for 3 computers.
Plus my main PC s almost 4 yrs old so I might soon need to buy a new one anyway.
Thanks for the replies.
