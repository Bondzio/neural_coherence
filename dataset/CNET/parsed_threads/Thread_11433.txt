<s> Is there a difference in flash drives? </s>
<s> In terms of quality and reliability, is there a difference? </s>
<s> It seems that some are temper mental - you think you save something on the drive and then go and pop it into another computer and it's not there. </s>
<s> Any USB Flash Drive can fail, you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> If not, it may not be there. </s>
<s> I think I lose something on these 1 time in many thousand times. </s>
<s> Maybe once in 2 years. </s>
<s> This may explain why some take the chance and &quot;store&quot; stuff with no backup on such drives. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Are you saying if I pay $89 for a thumb drive it's better than the $20 thumb drive just because it cost more? </s>
<s> That's the whole reason I posted the question in the first place. </s>
<s> I haven't seen any reviews on thumb drives, except from retail outlets that wanted to sell them. </s>
<s> Thanks for the response. </s>
<s> I do try to eject the drive before I remove it. </s>
<s> However, there are times that I get a response that the &quot;drive is still in use&quot; although the file has been closed. </s>
<s> I've found the only way to get around this is if, while in the same program, I open a file from my hard drive and I guess that frees up the memory? </s>
<s> My method has been to log off and possibly shut down. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> That would probably work, but it's kind of defeating the convenience factor. </s>
<s> &quot;still in use&quot; dialog comes up; I press &quot;ok&quot; then press &quot;stop&quot; operation again. </s>
<s> It usually work 85% of the time. </s>
<s> The other 15% I do it three time, and if that doesn't work then I would do what Bob suggested...log off/shutdown. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I guess that's the best answer. </s>
<s> I still would like to know if there are any thumb drives better than others and if I could really tell the difference. </s>
<s> I normally just go with the well known company like kingston, pny, etc. </s>
<s> They seem pretty quick and not very expensive. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I'll try it. </s>
<s> I guess that I have been lucky. </s>
<s> I try twice to eject, make sure the drive shows the files. </s>
<s> then simply unplug it. </s>
<s> For the past 5 years, I have never lost anything. </s>
<s> My main use is to carry files and programs from my main home office to various places that I work. </s>
<s> My preference is SanDisk 8 Gig drives. </s>
<s> Every now and then I 'catch them on sale at Office Max and I generally get a $10 off on $20 purchase every month or two so they are really inexpensive. </s>
<s> Andy Seitz - the CIRCUIT RIDER </s>
<s> KenHusveg is, more or less, right. </s>
<s> USB sticks are generally cheap, and they do fail over time. </s>
<s> So that would cover that. </s>
<s> As for brands, some would swear by Sandisk; based on personal experience, I certainly do not. </s>
<s> The thing that has lasted me the longest so far, is a 256 MB Sony. </s>
<s> You may care to look at http://www.pcmech.com/article/how-long-will-that-media-last/, incl. </s>
<s> the comments. </s>
<s> My choice for reliability is SD cards mounted as USB sticks, since they beat even optical disks. </s>
<s> Thanks Andy! </s>
<s> That's exactly what I was looking for. </s>
<s> Sounds like my issue may be more &quot;pilot error&quot; than anything else. </s>
<s> I've never seen reviews on them and didn't know if I should be paying more - or if there's a difference. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I use it in my camera as well. </s>
