In theory it should be possible to assign the mouse wheel to perform a repetitive action; however, I don't know how to do it. I've been told that the Logitech G5 and G9 are both capable of this, though I have been unable to confirm it based on any documentation that I've read. Anyone know how to do this? For example, I'm looking to assign the mouse scroll wheel to press the Q key whenever rolled forward or backward.
