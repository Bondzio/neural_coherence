I suspect that the HD in the original system wasn't readable or available, it will repeat the same problem on another system.
If that's the case, then what is the original problem or reason to try to recover data.
Once, that's explained we can go from there.
Otherwise, you may not be resolving the real problem.
Please explain system specs and details or order to give a some resolution.
