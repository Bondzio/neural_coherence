However it has a D-sub connector only and my Video Card has both VGA and DVI-I connector. The package contains a DVI to VGA adapter. My question is will my LCD show an improvement once I have used the adapter to the DVI-I rather than the VGA connector. I know that some LCD's do the conversion from analog to digital within their electronics, however in this case will the LCD know that it is a digital input it is connecting to or will try to use the analog circuitry. Will I see a difference.
