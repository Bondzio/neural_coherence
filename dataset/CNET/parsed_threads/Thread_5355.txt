<s> I currently own a Linksys WPC54G wireless router. </s>
<s> I don't use wireless for my desktop, but I have 2 other laptops in house that use wireless. </s>
<s> The router works pretty well, although I occasionaly have to bypass it because a download will freeze up. </s>
<s> I assume the speed for my 2 laptops will increase if I upgrade to a 802.11N router, but will see an increase in speed on my desktop since my signal runs through the router? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If your wireless performance seems acceptable and ISP's supply is slower than present router's max (802.11g claims 54mbps) would you expect an improvement ? </s>
