I want to connect the processor to the TV, so that I can watch movies and TV programmes streamed through my computer on my TV screen. Could I do this by using a HDMI cable to HDB15? See link below for details of cable. http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/HDMI-m-HDB15-m-DVI-m-DVI-m-HDB15-m-HDB15-m-HD-high-speed-cable-/251149664283?var=#vi-content

The manual I fetched from http://tda.panasonic-europe-service.com/docs/2z50ad3a54z3z25898z656ez706466z23z5553b55f2df4296ddea7d3f8c678b0149a7de09d/tsn2/data/EU/TX32LXD69A/OI/781274/TQB0E0507.pdf Makes no mention of VGA support.

There's a HDMI socket at the back of the TV. At present I have a HDMI cable attached from this socket to a Blu Ray player. I should have wrote in my post that I want to connect my PC to my TV.

From what I gather on this thread that's what you're left with. If there is some adapter, it may not be as cheap or as ready as a video card with the HDMI port. Don't make this complicated at least that's the direction I'll go. If you plan to buy another PC, the new video card would be cheaper. I suggest a ATI 4350 or similar. tada -----Willy
