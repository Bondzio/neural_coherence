If your setup allows boot from other, network or scsi then you should be able to do so.
Don't believe you can boot from USB.
I could be wrong but believe USB is loaded following boot to allow for hot swapping.
There is no reason the IDE connects cannot be routed to a rear connector and a hard drive placed in an enclosure with separate power.
Everything internal will need to be exactly the same as I'm sure you are aware.
