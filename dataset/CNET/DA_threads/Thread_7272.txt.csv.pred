1.3.1	Yes you can dual boot XP with Windows 7 , but whether this computer is compatible with Win 7 I ca n't say .	St
1.3.2	If it is , you get to find and install hardware drivers for it .	St
1.3.3	Win 7 may have some and if you are fortunate may have them all , but when installed you should head over to the Device Manager and check .	St

1.4.1	Thanx Mark yes it is compatible i have done a check , just dont want to get rid of xp really so was going to fit another hard disk and load win 7 on that Cheers Stu	St
1.5.1	to think about .	St
1.5.2	When you install the new drive and start the Win 7 installation , that setup process will replace XP 's boot.ini with it 's own BCD file , ( Boot Configuration Data ) .	St
1.5.3	It is this which allows the dual boot .	St
1.5.4	If you then remove the XP drive or wipe the data from it , Windows 7 will no longer boot , because it 's boot file has been removed .	St
1.5.5	Worth remembering .	St
