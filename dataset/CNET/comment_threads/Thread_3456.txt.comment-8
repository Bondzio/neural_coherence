The PC is probably from 1999 or so.
I got it from a friend and put a Pentium III 500Mhz processor and it has 768 of RAM.
I tried all the PCI slots and also verified the PnP option in the CMOS is enabled.
I flashed the BIOS using the MI413 one from this site: http://www.fic.com.tw/support/motherboard/bios.aspx?model_id=16 .
I also uninstalled SP2 and reinstalled XP without any luck.
