1.1.1	I 'm working with a self built PC from about 8 years ago .	St
1.1.2	It has a 3.2 gHz P4 HT processor that , according to the internal sensor is running at about 70-80 degrees C normally .	St
1.1.3	The sensors may be a bit off i suppose , but the heatsink is hot to the touch and I have been having problems with random restarts for years .	St
1.1.4	Building this PC was the last thing I did with hardware other than routine maintanance on it , so I 'm a bit rusty .	St
1.1.5	The PC has been degrading in performance steadily for the past 3 or 4 years , even when used on software of its era , so I think overheating may be the problem .	St
1.1.6	Diagnostic software such as everest and Hirens find no problems in anything of my comp much to my dismay of not having an easy fix .	St
1.1.7	Is there a way to reduce the CPU temp or is damage from running at high temp for so long permenant .	St
1.1.8	My heatsink fan is stuck at 5000 + RPMs , which I previously thought would discourage overheat so I did n't attempt to fix it , but is this causing a problem itself ?	Ques
1.1.9	I could try and reseat the heatsink , but wanted to get some opinions before I do anything that could make the situation worse , as I definitely can not afford to buy another processor right now .	St
1.1.10	It has been about 7 years since this particular heatsink was added so could I need to take it off and apply more thermal paste perhaps ?	Ques
1.1.11	Any input would be much appriciated .	St
1.2.1	It means the heat from the CPU is getting to the heat sink .	St
1.2.2	At 8 years that 's clearly when we started to see BAD CAPS .	St
1.2.3	Google bad caps to learn about and how to inspect for that .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I agree that a hot heat sink is good thing in as far as it 's clearly dissipating heat from the CPU but personally I would be more than a little concered running an eight year old processor at those kind of temperatures for prolonged periods of time .	St
1.3.2	If you manage to repair your mainboard I would seriously consider spending a little cash on some better cooling solutions .	St
1.3.3	Mike	St
1.4.1	Since the last time applied was 7yrs .	St
1.4.2	ago , it would n't hurt to remove and clean cpu itself and reapply thermo paste .	St
1.4.3	Now , only a little bit goes a long way .	St
1.4.4	Inspect the fan be sure it 100 % clean and dust free itself or replace with similar fan .	St
1.4.5	Then assure proper remount of fan ( HSF ) onto the cpu .	St
1.4.6	While you 're at it , clean out the entire PC case .	St
1.4.7	Check ! ! !	St
1.4.8	the frt .	St
1.4.9	cover vents , as many users do n't remove it and clean that out .	St
1.4.10	Its usually the air inlet to the case .	St
1.4.11	I find that alone can an undisclosed area to check .	St
1.4.12	Check also all the replies you had here as they all make sense .	St
1.4.13	Excluding any damage to cpu , it should work better than before , if not , then maybe another is at fault or the cpu is cooked .	St
1.4.14	Intel cpus will run at lower speeds if too hot and then start shutdown when hi-temp reached .	St
1.4.15	There are other cpu monitoring s/w , freebie that work great and can report the status as well , like CPUID and my favorite , PCWizard 2010 ( entire system report ) , but google for others .	St
1.4.16	To check for proper thermo paste application , google & quot ; Artic Silver & quot ; and follow instructions .	Sug
1.4.17	tada -- -- -Willy	St
