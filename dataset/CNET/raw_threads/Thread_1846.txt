Which ones are the best? I would like something that is easily portable and that I can have access to whether I am in the office, car, beach, coffee shop, etc. How secure in a sense are these drives. For example if I drop it is data going to erase? My flash drive has been through hell and back and still works (drops, wash machines, step on, etc.) so I am looking for something like that. Thanks in adavance. M

For a LOT MORE MONEY you can find SOLID STATE EXTERNAL DRIVES that will survive better than many external hard drives. The lesson here is simple. &quot;We only lose what we didn't backup.&quot; These externals are useful things but do not count as &quot;storage&quot; but as &quot;convenient copies.&quot; Bob

I have 2 of them (seem ok so far..but have never given it the drop test yet, hehe).
