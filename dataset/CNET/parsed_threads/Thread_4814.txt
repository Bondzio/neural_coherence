<s> Hi, I have a wireless network at home set up with the Gateway WGR-200 router. </s>
<s> I'm having trouble accessing 1 particular site (page not found). </s>
<s> When I bypass the router completely, I can access the site. </s>
<s> So I think the router's built-in firewall is blocking the site. </s>
<s> How do I unblock this site? </s>
<s> I can't find where I can configure the router's firewall. </s>
<s> I can access the router's set-up page via the http link, but I don't see any option for configuring the firewall. </s>
<s> I'm using Windows XP, with a desktop, laptop and cable modem. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Ed </s>
<s> I ran into this and it turned out to be an odd DNS failure. </s>
<s> But I can't connect the dots without that last detail. </s>
<s> To see if it's a lookup failure use DNSLOOKUP (see google.com) on your machine. </s>
<s> Also my router has this feature (DNSLOOKUP) to help in such troubleshooting. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the response. </s>
<s> When I bypass the router completely, I can access the site. </s>
<s> I think the router firmware may be corrupted or something. </s>
<s> I'm going to try to reset the router and upgrade the firmware. </s>
