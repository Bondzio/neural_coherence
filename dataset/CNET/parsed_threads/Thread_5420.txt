<s> I'm setting up my first home network. </s>
<s> I'll have three computers, two with XP Home and one with XP Professional. </s>
<s> Are there any compatibility issues as far as networking? </s>
<s> The two with the Home edition will use CAT5e (wired) and the one with Professional will have a wireless connection. </s>
<s> Yes, the network cards are compatible. </s>
<s> I have cable access, and the cable modem. </s>
<s> I will get a router with a WAP (any ideas there?) </s>
<s> and it's just a simple little home network so the the kids can access the internet and the printer. </s>
<s> One computer with Home edition is 1.67Ghz (I know, I know), the other one with Home will be around 2.6 or 2.8 (waiting on the tax return to buy it :D) and the one with Pro is 2.2Ghz. </s>
<s> All will have 512 RAM (unless the new one gets a gig). </s>
<s> I think that's more tech specs than needed for the compatibility issue. </s>
<s> But I'll take ideas on the whole setup. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I am aware of but some will have problems with file sharing based on overzealous firewalls. </s>
<s> In it's out of box experience you should succeed. </s>
