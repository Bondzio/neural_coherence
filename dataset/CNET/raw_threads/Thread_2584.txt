6538	2	160027	1777177	1776238	linkit	2/27/06 6:37 PM	1.14106542E12	I agree -- dedicated video	For gaming, I would recommend a system that has a dedicated video card (not integrated and no shared memory). ...or add an upgrade video card with dedicated video memory to an existing system. This often requires an upgrade to the PSU as well.

You should decide the top 3 things you want your PC to do, then pick a PC that's good at those things. For instance, don't spend the extra cash on a media center PC unless you want it to be your media center and you'll be watching TV/movies, timeshifting TV, recording TV/DVDs, and listening to music on it all the time. A regular PC can do these things with a few upgrades, but if you want to put a PC in your living room to do these things often, then get a media center PC. If your top 3 things you want to do are &quot;play the sims&quot;, &quot;surf the web&quot;, and &quot;download music&quot;, then just get an inexpensive PC. If you're top three things are &quot;play battlefield2&quot;, &quot;convert DVDs to DivX&quot;, and &quot;edit videos&quot;, then get a PC with an AMD X2 or P4-D and a fat video card like an ati X1800 or geforced 7800.
