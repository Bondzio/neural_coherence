<s> So I recently purchased high-speed and networked my house. </s>
<s> One of my computers is running Windows 98FE, so I have this hooked up to my network with a wireless ethernet bridge. </s>
<s> However, my computer did not come with an ethernet port, so I had to install one. </s>
<s> I bought the Linksys Etherfast ethernet card that is supposed to work with even 95. </s>
<s> However, the cd linksys included only had the drivers for Windows XP on it. </s>
<s> The linksys people told me to download the 98 drivers from their website so I did. </s>
<s> I installed them, but ever since I did so, my computer will freeze up after I close internet explorer (browsing the internet works fine though). </s>
<s> I can think of two possible reasons why this is happening: 1. </s>
<s> The drivers on linksys' website were for version 5.0 of the card, but my card is version 5.2. </s>
<s> The linksys people told me these drivers would work, but some of them aren't so bright so I wouldn't be surprised if they were wrong. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The 98 drivers from linksys' website are meant for windows 98 SE. </s>
<s> If that is the case, should I try to install it using the drivers for windows 95 (I heard the 98 FE is more similar to 95 than it is to 98 SE). </s>
<s> Do either of these sound right or is there something else that is wrong? </s>
<s> Also, is there somewhere I can buy an ethernet card that is SURE to work with 98 FE (i am sick of dealing with linksys' incompatibility with older OSes)...like a 3com or intel one or something? </s>
<s> And if so, where can I find one? </s>
<s> Try the usual cure. </s>
<s> Delete all BHO's from this machine. </s>
<s> What's a BHO? </s>
<s> Ask google.com How do I uninstall them? </s>
<s> HIJACKTHIS What is HIJACKTHIS? </s>
<s> Ask google.com Sorry if I don't write a long post but its the cure I use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> do you really think that is the problem? </s>
<s> I didn't think it was just a coincidence that it started freezing right after i installed the ethernet card </s>
<s> I was offering the usual cure to lockups when we exit IE. </s>
<s> Let's wait for others to offer something else. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Can you get the free SE updates for this one? </s>
<s> As well, try to get your hands on an old 3Com 905 series NIC. </s>
<s> These had drivers written for Win 98 and they worked. </s>
<s> I've given a box load of these things away and keep a couple handy for troubleshooting or second NICs in XP machines because XP already knows them. </s>
<s> Great old board. </s>
<s> Do you know where I can get one of those cards (besides ebay)? </s>
<s> And is that card compatible with FIRST edition? </s>
<s> Also, what would be the best NIC card to get for my Windows ME computer? </s>
<s> Google search I'd get the TX or TXNM rather then the M type. </s>
<s> NM means &quot;non-managed&quot; and M means managed. </s>
<s> Some of these managed types needed to have that feature shut off using a DOS utility in order to prevent their BIOS interruption during boot up. </s>
<s> These originally carried a price of well over 100 bucks each but you should be able to get one for less than 10. </s>
<s> If you've got a local builder who does upgrades, I'm willing to bet these cards pass through his hands regularly. </s>
<s> Check with such a shop. </s>
<s> I'd. </s>
<s> The drivers are still on the 3Com web site or easily available elsewhere. </s>
<s> I'd say they should work with ME but have no such experience. </s>
<s> ME was a later OS and might even have the drivers built in. </s>
<s> I was thinking 98SE had the drivers as well and such is why I mentioned the upgrade. </s>
<s> The cards will work with the first editions. </s>
<s> The reason I suggested this was threefold. </s>
<s> I had a lot of experience configuring these and found them better and more reliable than other brands of that era. </s>
<s> Many were made in the USA though some came from Singapore and even Ireland. </s>
<s> They were sturdy. </s>
<s> Lastly, to me it makes good sense some times to use parts of similar vintage. </s>
<s> Though you can still buy hardware that &quot;works&quot; with Win 98, I have to question just how much effort went into tuning that driver. </s>
<s> Such is why I recommended an older reliable card with an older OS. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> If you didn't complete the BHO removal then you are likely going to repeat this issue again. </s>
<s> The issue I note is well known, and easy to fix. </s>
<s> Also you can disprove it in a few minutes for free. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I rarely use it. </s>
<s> You might try a fresh install of Firefox to see if the lockups still happen with it. </s>
<s> Win 98 is no where near as stable as XP. </s>
<s> We'd have to blow these up and freshly install the OS from time to time as last resorts to unresolved problems. </s>
<s> Cleaning out pests often helped but they do come back when using IE frivolously. </s>
<s> The BHO removal didn't work. </s>
<s> I think it is a driver problem because I am having similar problems after installing the same card on my Windows ME computer. </s>
<s> Do those cards on the google search come with the CORRECT drivers (cough cough, linksys) on a disk or something? </s>
<s> Tell me which motherboard chipset driver you are using. </s>
<s> Is it current? </s>
<s> How do I find that? </s>
<s> When you post the forum asks for details such as make and model of the machine. </s>
<s> Given that, members can offer direct links rather than generic answers. </s>
<s> Tell a little, get a lot more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm running two Gateway Desktops. </s>
<s> One is Windows 98 the other is ME. </s>
<s> The 98 is Pentium II, the ME is Pentium III. </s>
<s> Do you need anything else? </s>
<s> If not, time for a shop to fix this. </s>
