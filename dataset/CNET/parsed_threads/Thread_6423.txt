<s> I have a Dell E310 computer, and I would like to buy a graphics card. </s>
<s> I've wanted to play Battlefield2 and Call of Duty 4. </s>
<s> I just can't seem to find a decent graphics card for my computer though, I know my computer cant handle a x16, and I was hoping I could find a x1 or something for it. </s>
<s> The best I've found is here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143032 If anyone could find something better, that would be nice. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> Check this out http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-dimension-e310-pentium/4505-3118_7-31594474.html </s>
<s> At least you can get them now. </s>
<s> Just kinda hoping someone might be able to find a better one, than the one I have. </s>
<s> Any in that search would decimate the gma 900 onboard graphics. </s>
<s> Thank you, I'm going with this one: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=N82E16814161079 I think it should work...for Battlefield 2 at least...not sure about COD4 though. </s>
<s> Thank you though. </s>
<s> I'm looking for a better hard drive too. </s>
<s> =]. </s>
<s> The E310 only has an 80gb one, and I have no clue if some of them are compatible with my computer, what kinds are good. </s>
<s> This one seems good to me, but I don't know. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148140 Help me with this too please? </s>
<s> lol....Thank You. </s>
<s> I don't need a massive HD, but it would be nice to have around 250-320gb. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I have no clue, don't know a lot about computers...just a little. </s>
<s> I didn't know it mattered. </s>
<s> See http://www.pcisig.com/specifications/conventional/conventional_pci/lowp_ecn.pdf for measurements so you can see if your PC can use such a thing. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect shows some good links and pictures to the normal size. </s>

<s> The first one didn't download, I don't know why. </s>
<s> I'm thinking about replacing my mobo now, I wanna be able to get an x16 card. </s>
<s> It IS possible, I found that here http://forums.3dgamers.com/archive/index.php/t-12904 and then I was trying to find a mobo on newegg... otherwise, i was thinking I could just go with this one http://www.buy.com/prod/intel-d945gbo-desktop-board-pentium-d-celeron-d-pentium-4-intel-945g/q/loc/101/202166272.html That way I can have MORE expansion slots for RAM, it will still fit, and I can get an x16 card. </s>
<s> Do you think I could do it with little experience on taking that stuff out and installing a new one. </s>
<s> I've only opened up the computer to put something in the PCI slot... Is it better than my current one?...too many thought right now.. </s>
