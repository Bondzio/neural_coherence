I really meant what I said that the 24&quot; iMac would be great and match the budget with software included.
Fast, elegant, easy, lots of capabilities in case the users decide to expand what they do on a computer.
I own a Mac and like the OS a lot.
A $2.5k budget for typical computing needs is kinda like driving a luxury car for your commute.
But I'll be honest -- whereas I drive a little hybrid, I know I'd be more comfy in a Lexus or Benz.
