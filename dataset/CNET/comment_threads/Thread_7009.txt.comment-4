Are all the units the same?
- Of course not.
But for your first question in your original post the differences are less than 1% so I'll stop writing here.
Do you or any one else can share their results with their router?
- Unlikely.
If you would publish some web site with &quot;Can you do this benchmark for me and share the make, models and (all) your settings?&quot; then maybe you'll get a load of data but for the setup I shared we are still in the sub percent difference when we copy files to/from machines, change the switch and re-test.
This is why I don't bother sharing make and models.
These are FUNGIGLE.
