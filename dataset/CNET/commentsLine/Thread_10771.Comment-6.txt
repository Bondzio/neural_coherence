what game was installed on the day the problem started.
bob, iunderstand your post on the difference between a virus and trojan/malware but in the example i posted, does not this thing replicate itself?
it seems they had this problem before installing that av so your advice is sound.
idon't want to hijack this thread so i won't input anymore on av for android.
iwill start a new thread soon to discuss av/android soon.
i have to be honest, i am on the fence about av and android.
thanks for discussing, dafydd.
