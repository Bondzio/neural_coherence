I was checking out Ernies suggestion but wasn't able to find anything about capturing streaming ANALOG video for conversion to DIGITAL.
This is why I suggested the other device.
I can't tell if that card has RCA in ports, which is what my camera had coming out of it.
I don't have any other cable ports from my camera so I had to use the RCA to USB that VIDEOH offers.
After saying all of this, I may be incorrect about Ernies idea.
It may be just what you need.
