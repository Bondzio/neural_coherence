thanks for the response.
i found the following article  is that basically what you're suggesting?
following this, would i leave my wireless router plugged into the modem or plug it into the switch that is already plugged into the modem?
do i leave the my book plugged into the wireless router?
for clarification, i have an at&amp;t 2wire wireless router/modem combo unit that feeds internet to a netgear n750 wireless router and a netgear fsv318 firewall into a netgear fs516 ethernet switch.
the my book live is currently plugged into the at&amp;t 2wire.
