<s> I just built a custom PC, but have yet to get it to start properly. </s>
<s> I have an Intel Core 2 Duo E6400(not positive at the moment if this is the right one)processor, MSI 945GT speedster A4R motherboard, dual slot patriot 2GB memory, and a new power supply and harddrive. </s>
<s> I made sure the memory and motherboard were all compatible with the CPU, and the power supply has ample power. </s>
<s> When I turn on the computer, an error/ progress screen pops up for a split second and goes away, and does it again every 20 seconds or so. </s>
<s> It doesn't stay on long enough to see what it says or get a picture. </s>
<s> I tried pressing F1 repeatedly to get to the system setup, but it doesn't respond. </s>
<s> I've tried 3 different harddrives, unplugged everything but neccessary components, checked all power and reset plug-ins and nothing has worked. </s>
<s> I did notice that I don't have a reset button to hook up, but I don't want to buy one to attach unless it makes a difference. </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, it seems like the computer keeps resetting on it's own (not turning off, but recycling to the same screen continuously). </s>
<s> I also noticed that the screen is fuzzy when it pops up. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> You've got the wrong motherboard. </s>
