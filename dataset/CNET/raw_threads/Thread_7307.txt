Bios will not recognize hd, as I did not install sata raid drivers last time I installed new ide hard drive. Is there a driver for the ASUS motherboard of her a600n hp tower, I can install, without reinstalling windows. only added hd for storage. computer has 2 ide hd's now, but there are 2 sata ports available minus the one for the new hd. Hd is a Seagate SATA also. Thanks in advance. 1967F100SB

Any attempt to install drivers will only tax your time and patience. Your product = http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&lc=en&product=424351 I see that you might enable a THIRD MASTER in the BIOS at http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1144192 However unless you find a document with the BIOS screen shots, this is as far as I go. Plan B. Install some card like this -&gt; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815124020 but beware that many don't want to flash the BIOS for the IDE emulation so it will work. Bob

Which makes me ask about the document on the machine's BIOS. If you can't find it, why not take pictures for others to assist? Why not enable the THIRD MASTER? Bob

I did what you said and looked over the other web shot you found stole a jumper from a old hd and BINGO ! the drive showed up.... Thanks A bunch..... and no i am not gonna kiss ya. Now I will transfer 7 to the 500 and reformat the rest of the ide drives for max space. Thanks again , glad /i saved this message. Tim B.
