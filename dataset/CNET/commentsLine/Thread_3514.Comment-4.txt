i've been looking at bundled atx motherboards and cpu (p3's usually around 800mhz)but was not sure if they would plug in/fit in the case and work with my existing dvd rom and floppy.
also power is now a question.
do i have to upgrade power with upgraded board?
currently running a 200-250 watt power supply.
