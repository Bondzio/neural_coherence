1.4.1	I'm glad I'm not their client.	St

1.5.1	What did I say?	St
1.6.1	That card plugs into a normal PCI Express slot on the motherboard.	St
1.6.2	I don't think the power supply has anything to do with it.	St
1.6.3	Forget about what it &quot;calls for.&quot; Computers don't use nearly as much power as they claim.	St
1.6.4	a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system.	St
1.6.5	Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent... What is a normal PCI Express Slot?	St
1.6.6	You should have said a PCI-Express (x16) slot.	St
1.6.7	THE POWER SUPPLY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT!!!	St
1.6.8	The ATI X800XL requires a 350Watt PSU, that's including CPU, DRIVES, ETC... And also oem psu (except dell) would never run at their written wattages, maybe when it was new.	St
1.6.9	&quot;a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system.	St
1.6.10	Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent...&quot; A 300 watt is probably sufficient for a decent Pentium III, but bare minimum for a AMD AThlon 64 or Definitely a Pentium 4 Prescott.	St
1.6.11	The X800XL definitely makes a big dent.	St
1.6.12	ARE YOU BLIND, can you not see the huge fan on the card + the processor on that gfx card makes a good sized dent.	St
1.6.13	BTW DAGGER, all of your posts were simply hilarious, as it seems you have no ******* clue as to what you're talking about.	St
1.6.14	Roger	St
1.7.1	Hey, I salvaged the old power supply from my last compter, and it works just fine!	St
1.7.2	As long as it connects, who cares!	St
