a game port would not have midi.
i attempted to explain the history where creative labs add the midi signals to the 15 pin game multi port yet you ask for a game port to midi converter.
since a game port has no signals we can use to talk midi, a converter is not possible.
please add a midi port or if your game port has midi (remember multi port?)
then get the cable you need.
==&gt;&gt; remember that i can't recommend any card or cable because i can't find what machines and midi keyboards are in play.
