I have the Seagate 60GB part # 9W3532-556 It comes formatted to FAT32 which we all know what happens on USB drives. I changed that to NTFS and have nothing to report bad or good. It's working fine for me. Bob

Really need portability ? How much real data do you need to backup ? Thought about backing up to DVDs ? VAPCMD

What is FAT32? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table What is NTFS? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS The key points are that FAT32 is not damage resistent and one could lose the drive contents. This is not the fault of the USB drive makers but a limitation of this very dated file system. Hope this helps, Bob
