1.1.1	Yesterday morning when I turned on my home PC, it started acting very strangely.	St
1.1.2	The display was very odd, with every window that I closed appearing as a ghost image, before it shut down.	St
1.1.3	The mouse moved extremely slowly and anything I typed took a long time to show up.	St
1.1.4	I had to leave for work, so didn't get back to it until last night.	St
1.1.5	By the evening, all appeared well, and so I thought my problems were gone/over.	St
1.1.6	However, this morning when I turned on my PC the display never even lit up.	St
1.1.7	And once again, I had to leave to go to work.	St
1.1.8	I suspect that the monitor is shot, but I need to test this by putting another monitor onto the system.	St
1.1.9	Years ago I was told that you cannot hot swap monitors on Windows.	St
1.1.10	However, a friend of mine just told me that you can.	St
1.1.11	So I'd like to ask you all, can you hot swap DVI monitors on Windows 7?	St
1.2.1	While you can hot swap the monitors, it just makes sense to shut down and re-connect.	St
1.2.2	The time involved is minicle so it shouldn't be that long to do this.	St
1.2.3	At times some configs.	St
1.2.4	of the monitor may cause issue, so if things act up rather quickly then reset the monitor and/or setting via the OS and/or its video mgr.	St
1.2.5	to do this.	St
1.2.6	You may need to install the monitor disc to fully make use of all capabilities or install its s/w manager.	St
1.2.7	Basically, its up to you to conclude what's happening here.	St
1.2.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	But how do I shut down the system gracefully, if I've got no video to work with, so I can see where to click the Shutdown link?	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	If you see any display you act accordingly.	St
1.5.2	If none, then momentarily hitting the power-ON/OFF button will start the shutdown, direct h/w wise.	St
1.5.3	In some cases you may need to hold power-ON button longer to get reaction, too long it may restart again, you'll get a feel for it after awhile ------Willy	St
1.6.1	That worked perfectly!	St
1.7.1	Today's machines can power down, hibernate (the one I use), sleep, so you can tailor the power button to do what you want.	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
