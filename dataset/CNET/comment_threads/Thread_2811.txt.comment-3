ok I read that but friend i want to ask that BY HOW MUCH AMOUNT A DUAL CHANNAL MEMORY INCREASES THE PERFORMENCE AS COMPEARED TO SINGLE CHANNAL, AS I AM PLANNING TO |^ THE MEMORY FROM 256 TO 768 BY ADDING SINGLE STICK OF 512 MB ?
SHOULD I DO THAT OR PROCEED FOR DUAL CHANNAL MAMRY BY APPLYING 256 +2X128+ 256?
