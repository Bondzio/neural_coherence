sorry, couldn't resist throwing a bart simpson quip with the use of double negative.
i was surprised that my answer was not listed as an actual option on the polls above.
a request to the cnet administrators - when you put the poll in the forums for discussions, please also include the link to the actual poll.
i chose to receive plain text newsletters and i can't actually exercise my vote anywhere because the link is not provided either in the newsletter or here.
