Hello.
I have a friend who has a Sony CD Drive.
The Os installesd is Windows 98 SE, Pentium 2 192 mb ram.
When I put a RW Cd in the drive, it can not read the cd.
When I put a non burnt cd in it could read it after a few tries.
(there is currently no cd burning software installed).
Can anyone help me with this?
