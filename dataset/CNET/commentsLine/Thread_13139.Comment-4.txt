there are folks who know how and have used a flash drive as a bootable device?
.
yes i have.
have you booted with linux or ubuntu on a flashdrive or a cd?
.
yes i have.
this is well documented and well discussed area of pcs.
the only time i see folk in trouble is if their machine doesn't support this or if they didn't follow the directions on making the bootable media.
