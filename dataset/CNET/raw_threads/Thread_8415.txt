(I leave my computer one all the time) I go into task manager and it shows msmsgs.exe,Internet explorer and lucallback.exe running. I googled the lucallback.exe which I didn't undersatnd as it says something about a proxy and also auto updates. My computer is set for auto updates but the time is set for 2:30 AM, it is 6:30 when I get on my computer. The time and date are correct in the control panel. When I do a re-start it says that msmsgs.exe and explorer needs to close. I end the program, restart and everything is back to normal with the processor runnning between 1 and 4 %. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Wayne

As for msmsgs.exe, are you leaving Windows Messenger running the background? If so it may be doing various pings among other things to see if you are still connected, which icon to show, etc. since some have time thresholds of like &quot;after 15 minutes of idle show Away&quot; message. Internet Explorer is a world unto itself I think in terms of its CPU and memory usage at times though it could be worth noting which version you use and if there are updates or enhancements for it. Regards, JB

I am also using Norton anti-virus so I turned off the auto updates feature there and will just do it manually. I keep reading that a persons computer can be used as a zombie computer so that is why I was concerned. I had never seen this before. Thanks again and I will keep an eye on it for the next couple days. Wayne
