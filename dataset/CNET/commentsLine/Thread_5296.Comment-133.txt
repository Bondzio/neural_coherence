excellent points made.
very well thought out and expressed.
most new &quot;name-brand&quot; desktops come with the barest minimum in power supplies.
these are usually not enough for adding a new video card, so you can almost plan on the extra price and hassle of changing the power supply out for a more powerful one that will support the new video card.
h.p, dell, gateway/e-machines all fall into this category.
also, most of these brands come with entry level motherboards.
make sure that the system you buy has the extra slots, and also the available room inside to add a dedicated video card.
open slots is one thing, a good video card though usually takes two slot positions and could be longer.
watch for both of these.
the mid-tower suggestion is very good in this respect, but also watch the included motherboard ... is it a micro-atx or a standard atx motherboard?
be careful to ensure that expansion is possible if you even think you may like to try newer games.
