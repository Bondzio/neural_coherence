What would you suggest?

Sigh. M$ compatibility has come a long way in recent years. So you want a fairly recent Mac that can run OS X.3.6. Which requires a good bit of RAM to run well. Yet, a used Mac might come with OS 9.2.2. Which was not quite rock solid, no. And a used Mac might not come with enough RAM. OS X should have a minimum of 256 MB. And of course, you'd have to buy OS X for the used Mac. It's not free. OS 9 could be reliable enough if you were willing to limit the third-party stuff. Now, I always added stuff to 'trick out' my Macs. But I used a brand-new Mac some years back and was surprised how fast it was running. And realized that it was faster BECAUSE it was 'stock', not 'custom'. Which led me to understand that all the software gadgets I was running were each cutting out their own slice of processor power. And reliability too ! The more stuff you add to OS 9, the more likely it will crash occasionally, especially while running Web Browsers, for some reason. But adding extra goodies to OS X is much more reliable. So, what do I recommend? You can watch for a deal on a used iMac. With OS X, 256 MB of RAM at least. Or you can buy a used iMac, then buy more RAM, buy OS X.3.6, and end up with something almost as good as buying a new eMac. If you can handle the installation of RAM yourself, that is. The eMac is the all-in-one low cost Mac Apple sells for education. It goes for about $799 or so.

Mac's cant run PC tittles, they can run MS office if that's what you mean. If you still want a cheap quality Mac than look for a used iMac 300mhz or better...
