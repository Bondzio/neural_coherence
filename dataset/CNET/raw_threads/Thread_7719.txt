I connected it all up but when I turned everything on, XP did not find any new hardware. I went to &quot;Power Options&quot; then UPS tab and set up the UPS as Generic using COM1 as the connection as per my mother board diagram but I can't seem to get any communication between my PC and the UPS. When I unplug my UPS from the wall socket and my PC starts running on battery power I can go into the UPS tab again under power options and it still tells me that I'm running off AC. Does anyone know how to get the UPS to communicate this the PC when using the RS-232 interface? Is there some special software that is required?

The Manual just says &quot;Contact your sales reprsentative&quot; Another statement it makes is &quot;Some computers may need special UPS monitoring software. Contact your dealer for details on the various interface kits&quot;. I bought this new from a discount store and was wondering if anyone here had any knowledge on this model of UPS. I have see quite a few on sale. Power Sentry 2200VA with an RS-232 interface. thanks mtree

Most newer UPS that have links to the system for s/w control are USB based. If you google and find such s/w available, it needn't be directly provided for that brand name. It *MAY* work as a generic type setup, it just needs A UPS to work. So, if you find a newer s/w it *may* work also using a RS-232 to USB adapter then again, once you get into deviated manufacturer setup, it could falter as well. tada -----Willy

Could be one of those cases where they produce a bunch of them and then relabeled them for some reason (maybe quality or age). The whole thing is crazy. It came in a Philips box, was labeled Power Sentry, but was manufactured by Powercom. http://www.powercom-usa.com/ProductDetail.asp?ID=20

Contacting them seems like a good idea is all else fails or if you take too long, return product for refund. etc.. tada -----Willy

Just a version of UPSMON which I already had from one of my old UPSs. Still did not interface with my main PC as it would not connect using com1,2,3,4. Had to go in the BIOS and switch the addresses to AUTO for COM1 & 2. Connects now and everything to work. Man what a headache all that was. M
