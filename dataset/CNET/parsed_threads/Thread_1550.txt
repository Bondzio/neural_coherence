<s> I have two young children (8 and 6). </s>
<s> What computer configuration should I go with to support this age? </s>
<s> PC? </s>
<s> Mac? </s>
<s> What features? </s>
<s> Oh...I am on a budget! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> From about age 6 had a PC. </s>
<s> Now he's 10 and has his own PC. </s>
<s> I rarely have to help him out, but did last week as we installed an entry level video editor so he can make his own video production. </s>
<s> I'm sure there are Macs too, but I am a little PC oriented due to work and more. </s>

<s> Since you didn't say what your budget is it is hard to say. </s>
<s> But many people get a new computer and give the older one to the childern. </s>
<s> If you have a MAC then go that way. </s>
<s> If you have a PC go that way. </s>

<s> I would go with a cheap Pentium 4 or a cheap Athlon XP...they really don't need top of line if they are that young. </s>
<s> I would say I good idea would be to get them a webcam/video camera for computer so they can make stupid videos and stuff. </s>
<s> That is just my opinion tho. </s>
<s> If you can get a working used/freebie(given) computer of at least 500Mhz or better will be decent enough for them to enjoy small pgms. </s>
<s> and/or kid interaction type programming. </s>
<s> They will learn the basics and still be able to get internet access with enough speed to be comfortable. </s>
<s> Being used, the system will be very cheap if &quot;working&quot; no repairs other than maybe getting to a clean slate as it were. </s>
<s> Otherwise, a cheap system and I do mean cheap but affordable are in the $500 range or cheaper if brought on sale, supplied by Compaq, HP, eMachines, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, Best Buy, Circuit City, Fry's and verious online sources. </s>
<s> That system is usually an entry system is normally new or a &quot;reburbed&quot; one that's returned to as new condition, just read the fine print. </s>
<s> The side benefit of a vendor supplied system is usually some OS and s/w bundle in part of the deal and basic warranty, if new, less warranty if reburbed. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> Gee, everyone has made good suggestions and for children that age it would be best to go for an inexpensive used or low priced as others have suggested. </s>
<s> The webcam/video camera that cv4stm suggest is inexpensive and should be a hit with them. </s>
<s> He should know as he has stated before that he is 15 years old. </s>
<s> When my grandchildren come over they play with my 500MHz desktop that I paid $2375 for 6 yrs ago now worth about $200, or the emachine 766Mhz. </s>
<s> If they need to play a current high tech game then they use my 2.0 GHz desktop. </s>
<s> i did see something a little bit ago about a disney-themed desktop geared for kids - complete with mickey ears on the monitor. </s>
<s> i believe it is in the cnet desktop reviews. </s>
