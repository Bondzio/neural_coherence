I have a drivers disk and I tried the downloaded version but that did not work either. It installs the drivers but then a screen comes up with installin initial setup but then never finishes it.

The printer worked fine on a dell demension 2400 that was 6 yrs old. The demension 3000 is five years old. The message reads that it is setting up for intial settup but it never finishes the setup. Any other information needed to give advice?

The only one on the website did not list the Demension 3000 as a compatable machine when I clicked on the compatbility tab. How can that be if it is a dell product that is only one year apart in terms of how old it is.

Only other option might be to 'google' your printer model # for drivers, and see what comes up. Sorry B.
