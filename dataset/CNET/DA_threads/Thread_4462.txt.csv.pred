1.1.1	Buddy brought in this old PC to look at ... Every time I power on , it POSTs fine , then Win98 splash screen , then it reboots .	St
1.1.2	Over and over .	St
1.1.3	Cleared CMOS , reset frequency multiplier , same symptoms .	St
1.1.4	Removed audio card , floppy drive , and all but one stick of RAM , same symptoms .	St
1.1.5	Attempted to boot gparted live CD .	St
1.1.6	Went to selection screen , I chose failsafe mode , it rebooted .	St
1.1.7	Then tried memtest86+ , memtest worked fine ...	St

1.1.10	Some Specs : ABIT-BE6-II mobo Award BIOS PCI/PNP 686 ( 270620240 ) Intel Pentium III 300E MHz ( Slot 1 ) 512 MB RAM ( all three sticks in total ) ATI 66702 Xpert 98 ( Rage XL ) 8MB SDRAM 2x AGP PowerMan 235W PSU ( FSP235-60GT ) Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.11	?	Ques
1.2.1	Since Windows 98 boots that 's a good sign .	St
1.2.2	98 rebooting could mean you need to install it again .	St
1.2.3	Many have forgotten how ( I wo n't tell either ) but you find these machines are often dumped because people have forgotten how to install the OS .	St
1.2.4	Why I do n't tell is it 's all for the taking on the net .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	In such cases , I review the specs of the mtrbd .	St
1.3.2	and/or system so at least the & quot ; cockpit & quot ; is alright .	St
1.3.3	I make sure what 's plug-in and/or present is working on another system as in & quot ; test bed & quot ; .	St
1.3.4	Thus , i try to eliminate any possible sources of problems .	St
1.3.5	Because , of the reboot , i would swap out the PSU for a known good one .	St
1.3.6	Alas , due to wear & tear to include age you ca n't trust anything .	St
1.3.7	Since this is a win98 based system , disconnect the HD and Cd if present and note that in the bios .	St
1.3.8	Now , if in the bios does n't it remain up and running there , like walk away for 10min .	St
1.3.9	is it still working for some input ?	Ques
1.3.10	If yes , then provided a FD is connected , use a bootable floppy and what are the results ?	Ques
1.3.11	If it reboots , you have either a cpu or mtrbd .	St
1.3.12	problem if the PSU has been replaced .	St
1.3.13	Otherwise , if original PSU , that maybe at fault .	St
1.3.14	No telling what could be happening here .	St
1.3.15	I have found real mice dropping , etc .	St
1.3.16	that have corroded lands and/or eaten wires , etc. , so a close inspection is warranted .	St
1.3.17	A bad capacitor ( cap ) can be bad as in anywhere in the system , so do n't discount that .	St
1.3.18	Further , what was the reason that system was put away ?	Ques
1.3.19	If it had some problem beforehand , you 're revisiting it .	St
1.3.20	Last , hopefully if the system remains up and running during bios look see , be sure the battery itself is good .	St
1.3.21	tada -- -- -Willy	St
