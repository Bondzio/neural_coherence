If the files can be copied out then you can solve this...
Sorry but sometimes people think they can &quot;fix&quot; GPT access issues.
The brutal truth is that we need to get the files off the drive.
By any means possible.
I noted Linux CDs since we can boot that and see if it's an exit.
So the next steps are up to you.
At least we know what the issue is now.
