At 5 years all electrolytic capacitors are suspect.
That 300W PSU is assured to not be able to put out that much.
And we are talking about a 5 year old PC so it would be proper to have to disable a balky onboard NIC and install some PCI card to stand in.
However you will encounter tech's that will try anything to avoid that.
Go figure.
