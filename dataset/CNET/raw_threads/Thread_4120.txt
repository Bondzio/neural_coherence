I have a Packard bell ixtreme pc, PIII, 1GH, 640MB ram, Asus V9520/TD GeForce FX 5200 graphics card, Windows me with dvd and cd-rw. Should I make any upgrade changes in order to keep up with newer games and applications? Any suggestions? But I really wouldn't like to re-install windows.

The video card selection isn't in the top half over at http://www.tomshardware.com The P3-1000 MHz is ok for many things, but you may want to keep the screen size to 640x480 or 800x600 so the game and display don't work too hard. And much like the Spanish Inquisition, installing any OS may be too painful to some. Why is this an issue? Bob

What games would you like to play? the Pentium 3 is a decent processor (but to play newer games like Halo, or Farcry you'll need a different processor) That graphics card isn't the best. for most games it will be fine. But if you want DirectX 9.0 (halo and other new games) You could go up to a GeForce FX 5600 Ultra(older, but still ok), or a 5700 Ultra(new and good) if you need top performance a Pentium 4 or Athlon64 (both require a new motherboard, probly new memory) with one of the afformentioned graphics cards will do great. so what ever level you want of performane choose the hardware in tha level. But if you just want to play games like Warcraft 3 or other games like that, your system is fine.

As far as re-installing windows, there's nothing better then a machine that feels like it just came off the assembly line. http://www.pricewatch.com/ Good Luck!

Since the announcement of the Geforce 6800 and the Radeon X800, the Radeon 9800 Pro has dropped in price. It's an absolute beezer of a card and has no problems running Farcry, Halo, Painkiller etc. If you can't stretch to the 9800, the 9600XT is still a good card, only cheaper.
