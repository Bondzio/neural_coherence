i was talking to a user a while back about backups.
he was telling me about some product he uses and how he backups this and that and this and that, sounded good.
so i asked have you ever tried to restore using these backups?
answer=no so i asked how do you know the restore works?
answer=oh it will work.
so i said let's test.
wipe the hd and restore.
answer=subject title
