My desktop PC is being fixed and I am using my laptop on my home cable connection right now with it being connected through the network jack in the back. With my desktop pc whenever I download something I get between 350-450kb/sec and with my laptop I am receiving 5-20kb/sec. and the connection isn't that stable with the performacne fading after I use it for a few minutes and then I have to restart the modem and sometimes the laptop to get back on. My question is if I were to get a USB/Network adapter so I can plug the internet connection through the USB port would this solve my problem or at the very least improve my speed. The laptop is a Sony Vaio w/ a 2.0ghz P4 processor with 256MB RAM. Thanks.

I have DSL, and I've used this on a Compaq XL125, which is very old. However, before you buy that I would check all my network settings for the laptop nic and see if they are right. Have fun....
