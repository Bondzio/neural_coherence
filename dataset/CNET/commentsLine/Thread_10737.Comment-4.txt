the sounds like the hd, but it doesn't seem to continue on.
if that's all, then the hd is probably awaits some system error display to allow to continue.
i suggest you wait and give it more time and see if any error message appears.
wait about 10-15mins.
the noise itself doesn't suggest a bad hd though, unless this is constantly doing this.
