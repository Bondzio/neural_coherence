1.1.1	I 'm wanting to add 1GB in addition to my current 512MB ram in my desktop ... but my computer only has 2 slots for ram and both are filled with 256MB DIMMS .	St
1.1.2	Is there something & quot ; out there & quot ; that can combine both DIMMS into one DIMM slot so that I can add the additional 1GB I want into the other DIMM slot ?	Ques
1.1.3	By the way , my memory is the PC2100 kind .	St
1.2.1	or a single GB DIMM these should do fine : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16820145024 given that board you 'll need either a single GB DIMM ( they exist ) and one of those 512MB DIMMs , or to get 2 1GB DIMM 's and have 2GB i 'd just suggest getting two 512MB DIMM 's	St
1.3.1	Will your mother board/BIOS/OS support 1 Gig of RAM ?	Ques
1.3.2	Your RAM speed tells me that the machine is an older model .	St
1.3.3	If your setup will support it , then it 's purchase time .	St
1.3.4	A 1 Gig stick and a 512 stick .	St
1.3.5	But I 've also found that anything over a Gig is major overkill .	St
