there are only 2 802.11n devices in the house, and they usually use the same router.
the other laptop doesn't have the 'n' protocol and it uses the other router.
the problem did improve some when i reconfigured the router my wife is using.
it turns out that the belkin unit i bought prefers to have the connection to the network on the wan port when it is set up as a wireless access point.
that is different from any other router i've set up that way.
