1.1.1	I have a Toshiba Satellite 1950-A740 ( Pentium 4 2.2GHz , 512MB RAM , 40 GigHD Win XP SP2 ) I have a combo drive DVD/CD-RW drive [ Toshiba DVD-ROM SD-R2212 ] About 2 months ago , it started giving me trouble , it will read data discs and install discs but will not recognize a DVD or burn a CD .

1.4.2	I have a Toshiba DVD-Rom SD-R2212 that will read and burn CDs and data discs , but will not recognise a DVD .	St
1.4.3	I used to be able to play DVDs on it without any problems .	St
1.4.4	I even switched it from region 1 to 2 when I moved abroad , and had no trouble with it .	St
1.4.5	Then one day , I went to play a DVD , and suddenly I got & quot ; Please insert disc into D drive & quot ; .	St
1.4.6	HUH ! ? ! ?	Ques
1.4.7	Did I not just play a DVD , like , a week ago ?	Ques
1.4.8	I have no way of reinstalling the DVD software that came on the recovery discs without doing a complete system restore ( which , owing to half my doctoral thesis being on my hard drive along with numerous other VIP docs , I 'm loath to do ) ; I have used a lens cleaner to no avail ; and I 'm a wuss when it comes to registry modification .	St
1.4.9	So unless I wipe the hard drive , I have no way of knowing precisely what the problem is , because every time I 've done a troubleshooting test , the drive is supposedly fine ; the drivers are up to date ; and XP recognises the DVD-Rom portion of the combi drive .	St
1.4.10	Anyone have any suggestions ?	Ques
1.4.11	Or should I just ignore it and get back to researching ?	Ques
1.5.1	If so , maybe a Lazer lens cleaner may help.I 've bought different media disc thinking it was the wrong brand.Used Lens cleaner and I was able to burn and play..	St
1.6.1	Ok I tried a CD lens cleaner and I was able to burn a CD properly again .	St
1.6.2	I though & quot ; great , & quot ; and I 'll try to see if DVD read functionality has been restored later .	St
1.6.3	Before I tried to see if I could read a DVD ( about a week later ) my whole drive disappeared !	St
1.6.4	It 's not listed in My Computer , I ca n't find it in the device manager and if I try to type in & quot ; D : & quot ; to a address field it comes up with [ Can not find 'file : ///d : / ' .	St
1.6.5	Make sure the path of Internet address is correct . ]	Res

1.8.1	I had finally given up on the drive and in my machine its not easy to remove the drive .	St
1.8.2	I have to take out a few screws and then get a pair of pliers to pull on the chassis to pull it out .	St

1.9.2	I have never had troble reading DVDs but sometimes It wo n't read CDs .	St
1.9.3	If you want to reinstall the DVD software that came with the computer ( WinDVD ) uninstall it first by going to : Start Menu , Control Panel , Add or Remove Programs .	St
1.9.4	Find it on the list and click Remove .	St
1.9.5	To reinstall it go to : C : / , HP , Programs , DVD .	St
1.9.6	Click on the file named Setup .	St
1.9.7	An instilation wizard will come up and install it .	St
1.9.8	If you do n't want to wipe the hard drive because you has important things on it , it would probably be best to put it all on CD 's so you do n't loose it if something happens to the computer .	St
1.9.9	And if you copy everything you need to CD 's or DVD 's it is n't that hard to wipe the hard drive and reinstall everything .	St
1.9.10	If you decide to wipe the computer and have troble with an error message that says & quot ; Wrong Model Notebook & quot ; I can tell you how to get around that .	St
1.9.11	If you get it working let me know .	St
