it belongs to a friend and she said there was no problems beforehand so i am not sure.
she states that she was on facebook and had to run to town so she just left the page open and when she got back she had the page with all the information.
she also says that this is her 3rd cd rom and she was having problems with it as well.
is there anyway other way to reinstall the os?
when i put the cd in it takes forever for it to let me eject it.
i was hoping i could put it in and the option would pop up to reinstall.
