<s> I often forget to turn my printer OFF when I have finished using it. </s>
<s> Some more expensive printers have a &quot;sleep mode&quot; which turns them &quot;off&quot; if left &quot;inactive&quot; for a long period of time. </s>
<s> I have been told it is a big NO-NO to leave a printer turned on for too long &quot;inactive&quot; because it dries the ink up. </s>
<s> I can leave my printer on for days, completely forgetting that it is turned on. </s>
<s> What sort of harm or damage am I doing? </s>
<s> I really would appreciate some good constructive advice. </s>
<s> Thanking you in anticipation of a reply. </s>

<s> The printer when active usually sits at the ready unless as you know goes into a &quot;hibernate mode&quot; or simply parks itself. </s>
<s> This action allows it to &quot;cap&quot; the printhead in order to lessen any drying of the printhead. </s>
<s> If your printer doesn't do this then it exposes the prthd. </s>
<s> and starts to dry out. </s>
<s> When turned-OFF it will park and come to rest on the capping mechanism preventing drying. </s>
<s> Again, if it can't do this it wull cause problems fo especially inkjets, less so for any other typical home printer. </s>
<s> I exclude power and electrical issues. </s>
