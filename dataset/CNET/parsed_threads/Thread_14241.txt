<s> Hey I have 1 gt 640 and i play cod4 and looking into upgrading my video. </s>
<s> What would be better? </s>
<s> How fast would 2 dual Nvidia gt 640 vs 1 Nvidia gtx 660 ti be? </s>
<s> I run a ok 250fps on my 1 gt 640 now but with a super low config file and rez set to 1440. </s>
<s> That's a big jump. </s>
<s> That parallel stuff....2xgt.....might turn out to be a big headache. </s>
<s> Make sure you have a psu that can handle that card. </s>
<s> I find those with dual and more cards to be too hard to support. </s>
<s> Or rather the problems often mean we have to re-vamp the machine to get it to work as well as they expected. </s>
<s> A single card is the easy path. </s>
<s> Your choice but if you go with dual cards, be sure you have support on hand and a thick wallet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> &quot;Dual cards&quot; has always been a problem in the long run. </s>
<s> To me, dual worked well only during the demo days (at a computer show in my land). </s>
<s> Thereafter, it was one problem after another. </s>
<s> Had to go back to single card coz support for dual wasn't free a-tall. </s>
<s> Suit yourself. </s>
<s> Great for demos! </s>
<s> Thanks all, that pretty well says it gtx is the go! </s>
<s> I only just joined Cnet and got answers that night. </s>
<s> Love it! </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
