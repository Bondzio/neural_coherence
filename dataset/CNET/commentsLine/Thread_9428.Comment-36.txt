in the frustrating and hype-filled world of computers it's hard to tell when to buy.
but a 5 year old machine is ripe for replacement.
you should just be careful to make sure it is future-proofed because the next version of windows -- windows vista -- demands a lot of firepower.
so the savvy thing to do is to buy a computer with a motherboard that uses amd athlon 64 bit processors (939 pin variety) that will also accept amd's dual core processors (athlon 64 x2).
the dual cores are prohibitively expensive for most folks now; but they do use the same motherboards as the single core (in a huge number of instances -- nearly every asus 939-pin motherboard (for amd processors) supports both single and dual core processors.
intel motherboards support only single core or dual core, not both.
so you'd need a new motherboard to later move up to dual core if you go the intel route -- and you want to avoid that since microsoft will require you to buy a new copy of windows xp (or vista) when you change the motherboard (and windows came installed on your computer) -- nasty practice, but true.
also, be sure to get a serial ata (sata) hard drive of at least 250 gb in size, dvd drive (make sure it is ide, not sata because with a lot of motherboards you cannot boot from a sata dvd or cd drive; at least 1 gb of ram (windows vista, due out late this fall, will work best with 2 gb).
and i would avoid any manufacturer that uses a lot of proprietary parts like dell does.
