Sorry but my prior reply was off target.
Here's the problems you face.
1.
There's no DVD or Blu-Ray playback codecs/capabilities included with Windows 8 RT, and (currently) no add-on ones.
2.
You can't install software, drivers or such from said drive.
Hope you are getting the message fast that RT may stand for Restricted Tablet.
