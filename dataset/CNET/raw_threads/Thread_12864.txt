I would like to know if I can print to it from a tablet at a friends house on one network (the printer being at my house on another wifi network). I am using Win XP with services Pack 3. Many thanks

I honestly don't know exactly but from what I understand it allows you to send a file to a cloud account such as gmail, which I have, and the printer will automatically print it instantly. May be I am wrong - or am I correct and it is just that my printer doesn't support cloud printing. I don't know.
