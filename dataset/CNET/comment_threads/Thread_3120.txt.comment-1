I cant do it.
INFO: My laptop has a wireless network connection Dell Wireless WLAN 1350 WLAN Mini-PCI card.
It also has a Local Area Connection Broadcom 440x 10/100 which is currently disconnected.
My desktop has a 1394 Net Adaptor and also a Local Area Connection 2 3com gigabit NIC It is also connected to a Linksy router by an ethernet cable which in turn is connected to a DSL modem, also by an ethernet cable.
Now, I have no trouble accessing the internet, but everytime I try to run the &quot;set-up network wizard&quot; it stops in middle and tells me something is wrong and it wont say what.
Furthermore, I created a shared files folder on my laptop, which APPEARED in the Network places folder on my Desktop, but wouldn't let me access it, saying that it didn't really exist.
Any ideas?
