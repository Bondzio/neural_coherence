i have a macbook air.
i have it connected to a large external monitor and use it mostly like a desktop.
what makes most sense for battery life: a) keep it plugged in at all times while using?
b) use on battery all the time (up to 100%, run down to 0, back up to 100% ...)?
as a rule, i do not turn the computer off, put it to sleep at night, so if you recommend &quot;a&quot;, what about at night?
keep it plugged in, or recharge in the morning?
and if recharge, run it to 0 first?
or what?
thanks.
