I have a Toshiba Satellite P205D-S7454 notebook, I also have a dead (spilled water on it and it won't turn on) Compaq Presario 2100 notebook.
I recently took the old notebook to a local computer shop, asked them to transfer the data from the old notebook to DVD.
They wanted $130 for the job.
I mentioned it at work and a guy told me I can remove the CD/DVD drive on my new notebook, plug in the old hard drive and download from the drive.
This seems risky to me, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.
