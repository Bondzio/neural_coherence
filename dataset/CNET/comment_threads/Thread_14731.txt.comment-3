In the BIOS it says Device ID: Unknown.
So apparently it can tell that something is there, but can't communicate with the drive?
I may try the external cable today, since I have to head to down to best buy anyways.
Also, powering off and removing all the cables didn't do anything.
For the record, the drive is a Seagate Barracuda 1TB
