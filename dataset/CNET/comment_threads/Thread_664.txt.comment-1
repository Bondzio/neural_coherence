HI all, I have a G4 Titanium powerbook 15&quot; DVI.
The right hand hinge has broken and I have dismantled the machine,successfully removed the bezel from the screen and removed the offending bit of hinge.
All has gone very well.
However, I have discovered a small hexagonal &quot;pillar&quot; with a magnet fixed inside the top and a screw thread on the opposing side.
The magnet is the same size as the four that sit inside the plastic frame, which in turn sits inside the case.
I don't recall unscrewing this - I noted that a number of screws were a little loose, so in moving the innards I may have disturbed it.
Anyway - anyone have any idea where it goes?
Thanks
