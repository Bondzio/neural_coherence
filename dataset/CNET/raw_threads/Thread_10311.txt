While I didn't have any issue with our 2 storey, let's go with the story you could not get WiFi to the second floor. How I solve that is with 2 more things. 1. An AC Powerline Bridge (see amazon and google) 2. A second router but configured as a WAP. (see google for how to do that.) This is just above beginner networking so you must be comfortable with this and researching it on google or have it done for you. Bob
