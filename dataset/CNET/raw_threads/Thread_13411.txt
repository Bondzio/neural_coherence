Look for an AGP 4X/8X video card with 8 or 12 pixel pipelines (Radeon 9600 only has 4). Recent article: http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/10/31/the_best_video_cards_for_your_money/ (Go to the AGP recommendations of the article.) Also, note the minimum PSU Wattage ratings of the cards. Many discover that they need a better PSU to support a better video card.
