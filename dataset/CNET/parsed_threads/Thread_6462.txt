<s> Ok, so here's my problem. </s>
<s> I'm home from school and for some reason or other my laptop will not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I was home for Thanksgiving break and it was working fine. </s>
<s> It seems to be working fine now, aside from it not connecting to the internet. </s>
<s> My wireless signal is as strong as can be and it connects to the router, but when I open IE it wont connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong or how I could fix it? </s>
<s> to the router, then open Internet Explorer and click on tools and click on online. </s>
<s> then try it. </s>
<s> If it does not work, try a different browser, to make sure you really are connected. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> yeah, it says that its connected to the wireless router, i've tried disconnecting and re-connecting but it still says its not connected to the internet. </s>
<s> I can't get on AIM or anything, but the signal strenght is strong and it says its connected to the wireless router... </s>
<s> I dunno? </s>
<s> I think most probably you are not connecting to wireless router, although the signal is strong. </s>

<s> I had that problem twice with me Sony Viao. </s>
<s> I was using Norton antivirus software, somehow a glich would occur in my security settings and block my access to the wireless internet connection. </s>
<s> I had to go into Norton and change my settings. </s>
<s> Also if you are running windows xp and those security settings are set to high that might also block you from the internet. </s>
