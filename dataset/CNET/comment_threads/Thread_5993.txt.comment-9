But youve missed what I suggested, Try this .... Make sure you remove the power cord from the back first.
Unplug all hdd and CDROM Unscrew the CDROM and take it out, now check where it says the lil jumper should b to make it master.
Now put the CDROM back in and make sure it's on the end of the IDE cable.
Now see if u can boot the cd, if not, remove the CDROM again and put the lil jumper on cable select.
Put it back in and see if u can boot.
If the it does boot either as master or cbl select then try another IDE cable and/or CDROM If you get the CDROM working reconnect the hdd , go into the bios and find where it enables sata and make sure it's enabled.
If neither the Ide or the sata don't work I would think bad mobo or maybe although less likely the psu or try switching ram I would also check the temperatures inside the bios Last hope reseat the CPU Computers eh
