<s> I have been using Bluetooth for a few years now but it was always &quot;simple&quot; pairing of a PDA to my computer or a headset to a cell phone. </s>
<s> I bought a BT stereo headset hoping that I could pair the headset to my computer and phone so I could stream the audio from my computer while connected to my phone at the same time. </s>
<s> I got the pairing done with the phone, works fine. </s>
<s> I paired it with my computer but, even though it says it's connected, there's no sound from the headset. </s>
<s> This is the first time that I've tried to do something like this so I don't know exactly what to look for. </s>
<s> I have a Windows XP SP2 PC with a Linksys USB BT adapter (USBBT100) and the headset is a Motorola HT820. </s>
<s> I've had the adapter for a long time so maybe it doesn't support what I'm trying to accomplish. </s>
<s> Any advice, direction, help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Partially due to Microsoft's half hearted adoption and the other to the Bluetooth consortium. </s>
<s> Both are closed shops and with the dog eat dog nature of Bluetooth development (don't ask me why I know this) you are unlikely to find any real fix. </s>
<s> The adapter is also only BT 1.1 http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1119460478394&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper so it will never have STEREO. </s>
<s> If you want to pursue this, look at google.com and use the words SKYPE PC BLUETOOTH. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
