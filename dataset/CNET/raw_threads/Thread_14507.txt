And I would more than likely concur with this statement, but what about the other design professions out there. 3d-graphics, modellers, game designers, furniture and industrial design, architects, interior designers....and the list goes on. any thoughts anyone?

It just works, Apple is making false claims about windows crashing and not doing things you want it to. I know many other graphic designers who hate their Apples because they aren't compatible with all the Windows printers and stuff. Plus, they crash more than Windows. Macs are designed to be simple, in fact, way too simple. So simple, you have less customization. I use Adobe CS2, on Windows and it runs great, I never have issues.
