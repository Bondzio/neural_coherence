1.1.1	I have determined that I need a new motherboard.	St
1.1.2	I have an AMD Athlon XP 3200+ processor.	St
1.1.3	I would like: At least 2 rear USB 2.0 ports Ethernet Sound Rear FireWire port At least 3, up to 5, PMCIA slots SATA and PATA connectors Attachments for front USB ports At least attachments for 4 HD/CD drives, hopefully 6 to 8.	St
1.1.4	4 DDR RAM slots Any ideas on a mobo that fits this?	St
1.1.5	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	only 2 or 3 Socket A boards will feature that, and I wouldn't suggest any of them My personal suggestion: Abit AN7 Secondary suggestion: Abit NF-7 S barring those, DFI's LanParty NFII Ultra B is good (expensive if it's still avliable) and Gigabyte's GA7N400-L wasn't a bad board for the short time I used it...	St
1.4.1	Those are easily to find in any good computer shop, my mainboard was pretty cheap and it has 3 memory modules, 6 hd places (4 serial), and 10 usb ports so you really don't have to look for the most expensive.	St
1.5.1	I'm just suggesting a good model, that should serve him just fine, and in my experience it's better safe than sorry, purchase from a known good maker than from a no-name store and end up getting over charged on it...	St
1.6.1	get a server 8 or 16 sticks 2 agp the future needsmorememory	Sug
1.7.1	I looked on Newegg and couldn't find any Socket A server motherboards.	St
1.7.2	Could you suggest one?	Sug
1.8.1	i wouldn't get a server mobo, that's just way to expensive and it's something you don't need at all	St
