hi, can somebody help me please, i have a toshiba px1265se-1g16 external hard drive, it has onspec regen in stalled on what i think is a virtual drive, the only problem is is that when i enter the password for the drive, it says that the drive is enabled but when i go to my computer, it is only showing up as a cd drive with only 19.7 mb.
the drive itself is 200gb.
i have loads of pictures and files on there which i do not want to loose.
can anybody help?
is there a way of removing the virtual cd drive, thus allowing me access to my files?
i am running windows 7 on a samsung nc10.
thank you.
