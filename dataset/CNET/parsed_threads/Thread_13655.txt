<s> My mobo has always had problems from the beginning. </s>
<s> Every so often, the BIOS would reset or I would have to reseed the video card because of beeps. </s>
<s> This morning, I turned my computer on and it didn't boot. </s>
<s> All the fans went on, everything clicked properly harddrives and all, and the system hung. </s>
<s> I figured maybe the video card was having an issue again, so I shutdown, unplugged everything and reseeded the video card. </s>
<s> I turn the PSU back on, and the motherboard LED lights lit up. </s>
<s> I pressed the power button and nothing happened. </s>
<s> Not even a 1 second fan spin. </s>
<s> It was as if the power button didn't even work all of a sudden. </s>
<s> I unplugged, checked connections, and nothing. </s>
<s> I took out the battery, waited, put it back in, nothing. </s>
<s> I reset the CMOS with the jumper, nothing. </s>
<s> I took out the video card - nothing. </s>
<s> What the heck happened? </s>
<s> I'm much more sure that it's the mobo over the psu because the mobo has been giving me on and off issues from day 1, but how can I tell which it is, or should I just order both a psu and a new mobo? </s>
<s> I'm using a 500V psu and an Abit IC7-G mobo. </s>
<s> I'm currently at work and when I get home in a few hours, I'm going to unplug everything and try to do a bootup with just the CPU and memory, but I'm not very confident. </s>
<s> Why would the LED lights turn on but the computer won't even turn on for a split second? </s>
<s> &quot;My mobo has always had problems from the beginning.&quot; If this is/was the case, why are you bothering with it. </s>
<s> Exercise your warranty &quot;Every so often, the BIOS would reset or I would have to reseed the video card because of beeps.&quot; Further indications of a bad board, bad memory or more. </s>
<s> Call the supplier. </s>
