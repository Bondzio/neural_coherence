latest version of toast is 6.1.1 if that does not work for you try this.
if this drive is new, send it back for either your money back or a replacement drive.
sell this drive, as an internal drive, for $67 and for a little more in a firewire enclosure.
let us know how you get on.
this is the first time you have mentioned that this drive has never worked.
