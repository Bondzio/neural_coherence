<s> Recently setup trendnet router. </s>
<s> Know nothing about wireless networking. </s>
<s> I disconnect network from the internet when not on line by turning the external cable modem off on the box the cable co. installed. </s>
<s> After I turn the box back on the router must &quot;repair&quot; the connection. </s>
<s> Is there a check box or something else I can do that would simplify this? </s>
<s> Please make answer for wireless impaired person. </s>
<s> Thanks Jan </s>
<s> I have to guess what issue you are trying to fix. </s>
<s> In one sentence you mention wireless not working, in another it appears the router is defective. </s>
<s> Why not return the defective parts? </s>

<s> just the problem with the nut behind the wheel! </s>
<s> I don't know how to &quot;turn internet access off&quot; without using the cable co. modem and I don't want to be on the net. </s>
<s> all the time. </s>

<s> On my laptop I have a button that turns on and off my WIFI card. </s>
<s> On another machine I have ZONE ALARM (a free firewall) which has a setting to effectively block all network traffic essentially turning off the internet. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
