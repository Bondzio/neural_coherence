1.1.1	Dear friends , I have just received a Firewire enclosure for a SuperDrive I bought months ago from the same company , Other World Computing .	St
1.1.2	I was told that they would work together , but now that I 'm assembling it , I find that the tiny holes on the drive ( very near the edge of the drive , and only two on each side of the top , not the many more that the enclosure seems to indicate should be there .	St
1.1.3	In addition , the holes in the drive and the ones in the enclosure do n't match up .	St
1.1.4	The enclosure also is very long for the drive , even allowing for room to attach the ribbon cable and other cables inside .	St
1.1.5	I have now spoken with three different people at OWC , and nobody knows why this is or how to work out the problem , except to offer me another , less desirable enclosure that they assure me will fit the drive .	St
1.1.6	( I did n't mention that the drive is an older model and that they no longer carry it . )	St
1.1.7	Well , I was assured that the one they have already sent me was just fine for my drive , so you can 't blame me for being a bit wary of the assurances for the other enclosure .	St
1.1.8	The drive fits very snugly in the enclosure and does n't seem to shift around .	St
1.1.9	If I replaced a metal piece around the front of the drive that I took off to make it fit more flush with the front of the enclosure , it would be an even tighter fit .	St
1.1.10	It would n't look as nice , but it could be done .	St
1.1.11	My question is I whether I can dispense with putting in those screws , which are meant to secure the drive within the case and keep it from shifting around .	St
1.1.12	( The screws meant to attach the back panel of the enclosure , the one with the internal cables , and the holes in the enclosure will fit together fine , because they are both part of the same thing . )	St
1.1.13	I would really love to move on with this and not try out anything elselet alone a less good driveif I can .	St
1.1.14	I wonder what you think .	St
1.1.15	I have only a short while before I must make a decision , and I 'm leaving for a visit to part of my family in about two weeks .	St
1.1.16	Any input is very welcome .	St
1.1.17	Thanks , jenny	St
1.2.1	If the drive fits in there snugly , dispense with attempting to put the screws back in .	St
1.2.2	Just remember not to carry the enclosure around with the nose pointing down .	St
1.2.3	If it is to spend its life sitting on a desk , it will be fine and will function as designed without the screws .	St
1.2.4	I still think they sent you the wrong thing , the DVD drive , in the first place .	St
1.2.5	Good luck P	Polite
1.3.1	I am inclined to agree with you on both countsthat the drive will be quite safe , so long as I am careful and that it was the wrong drive in the first place .	St
1.3.2	It would appear that OWC is great for anyone who knows exactly what she or he wants , but try to go there fully prepared Many thanks again , oh , wise one , Jenny	St
1.4.1	let us know how you get on .	St
1.4.2	Hi to Mumsie P	St
1.5.1	I have n't used the drive yet , but when I turned it on , the drive sounded as though it was spinning like mad , even though there was no cd or dvd in it .	St
1.5.2	( Please forgive the crazy lack of capitals .	St
1.5.3	for some reason the shift on the righthand side of my G3 Powerbook is n't working . )	St
1.5.4	Attaching the cables inside the enclosure was really hard , because , as I wrote in the first message of this thread , the enclosure 's very deep for the drive , so it took some delicate reaching in with my fingertips in order to align the plugs .	St
1.5.5	still , it 's done now , and I have every reason to suppose that all systems are & quot ; go. & quot ; Nice of you to remember my mother in your good wishes , although you 've never met her .	St
1.5.6	she had had a hard week .	St
1.5.7	Jenny	St
