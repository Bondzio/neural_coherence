I posted late last night and must not have sent my message.
The 2100 C comes with Precision Scan software, which should set up software buttons.
On my 4070 the software is called HP Director.
Mine turns on at start up and turns off 10 minutes later.
Activating one of the software buttons turns it back on.
As Bob mentioned, it may have been a cost savings attempt, or it may have been an attempts to eliminate another part to fail down the road.
Look here for HP support.
