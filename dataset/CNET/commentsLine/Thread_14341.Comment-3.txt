@ bill 012 thank you.
your reply was helpful and clear.
i appreciate your time and lending me your expertise!
i really appreciate people who share their knowledge and abilities for the simple sake of helping others.
i wish i could do likewise.
so replacing a modem is not as straight forward as i imagined or as replacing a router.
understood.
btw, the router is probably a ppp, as you say as this is the green light that they keep asking me if it is on or off.
router: since the router will be easier to replace, i went ahead and i just bought a top of the line asus (ac66u) to replace the present ethernet only router - at least i will have wifi and better throughput @ the router end.
modem: i will drop &lt;phone/cabletv/internet&gt; bundle in favor of internet only contract: it's cheaper, i don't understand japanese tv and ip phone often doesn't work with fax, 800 numbers, etc.
they will replace the bundle services modem which i have now with an internet only new modem next week: which are the critical settings which i should check (while the technician works) to successfully replace this internet only leased new modem with a purchased one?
any chances that i might pull it off if i get the right parameters?
which are they?
again, thanks for your time and help!
