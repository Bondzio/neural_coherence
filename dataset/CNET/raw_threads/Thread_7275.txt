But today when I started one of the computers there is a message: *** For Realtec RTL8139 (A/B/C) RTL8130 PCI Fast Ethernet Controller Client MAC ADDR: 00 11 09 97 55 33 GUID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 DHCP... (and fast changing symbols \|/-\|/-... that looks like spining) *** After a while the message *** PXE-E53 No boot filename received PXW-M0F Exiting PXW ROM *** apears at the bottom and the same goes again. If I unplug the network cable it shows a message, informing me that the cable is out. What should I do?
