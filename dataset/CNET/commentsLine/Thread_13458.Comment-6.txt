ait, ill get an 80 gig hdd with my next pay.
i dont have an internal modem coz i decided to buy a bt voyager 105 modem from aol instead.
i can remove a dial up modem from this pc so thats not a problem.
i really do appreciate your help and look foward to coming bak here wen my new hdd decides to start running circles around me.
looks like i was thinking way too much about the power instead of simply buyin the right equipment.
