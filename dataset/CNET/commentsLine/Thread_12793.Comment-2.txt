very interesting article.
i have just obtained and returned a d-link 624 g router because the new firmware would not allow me to select a channel.
the article implies that, when operating in the 108 mode, you lose the ability to select channels.
what was frustrating was that no one in tech support at d-link had a clue as to why i was locked in on channel 6. it appears that this simply is the way the implementation is suppose to work.
i also found posts about the netgear 108 product where people are complaining about being locked into only one channel.
is this truly the way the implementation is suppose to work?
if so, would you not think that the vendor's own tech support would know this?
