How permanent, secure or immune to failure do you think USB Flash Drives are ? Are you asking about this in the context of primary storage ? VAPCMD

But really do you want to back up 200gb of data onto 40 dvd's (at 4.7Gb per disk). It takes about 15 minutes (on my dvd in a laptop, it is 5 years old). So 15 x 40 = a lot of time vs. just drag and drop walk away and come back it is done. - also you would need rewritable dvd's if you want to update the data. - also how do you verify that the data is not lost through wear and tear, are you going to test 40 dvd's. That sounds like a really bad idea It sounds a like a much better idea to have two external hard drives, you can buy a 1terabyte drive for about 120$, back up your data that way.
