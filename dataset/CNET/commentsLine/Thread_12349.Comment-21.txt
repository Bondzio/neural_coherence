brand matters to the extent that dlink provides little customer support.
i called tech support for help with problems getting my wap up and running.
the tech got me to the point of being able to send packets back and forth between the two machines.
neither machine could see each other in the network neighborhood, neither one could send files back and forth, could not share the internet connection.
the tech told me told me that since they were sharing packets back and forth, that was basically the extent of d-links obligation to assist me.
he sent me multiple links to reference files that i could refer to to solve the rest of my problems.
thanks d-link!
