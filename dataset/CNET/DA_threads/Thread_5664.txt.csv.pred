1.1.1	Dell Dimension 4100 running XP SP2 This is really odd... sometime in the last week, the two DVD burners on my system have downgraded themselves to CD.	St
1.1.2	When I look at my system on Windows Explorer it shows my two drives as DVD-RW drives.	St
1.1.3	But if I put a DVD in either one, I get the message &quot;No disk in Drive&quot; and now Explorer says the drive is a CD-RW.	St
1.1.4	If I put a CD in, everything looks fine, and indeed I have burned a couple of CD-RWs with no problem.	St
1.1.5	Control Panel - System says my two drives are working properly.	St
1.1.6	I haven't installed any software or hardware lately, but just in case, I restored my XP to two weeks ago ... still no help.	St
1.1.7	Is it possible I have a problem with my IDE channel?	St
1.1.8	Any Ideas or suggestions?	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance Perry B	St
1.2.1	XP knows nothing about DVD recording and this issue is widely reported.	St
1.2.2	The good thing is that CD/DVD recording works fine even if the drive type is not right according to Windows.	St
1.2.3	There is however another failure here.	St
1.2.4	Try the usual hardware removal in the device manager and remove the upper and lowerfilters (see google.)	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I want to be clear about your advice, since I haven't played with this kind of problem before.	St
1.3.2	(I should mention that my burner definitely will not burn a DVD.	St
1.3.3	The burn software detects that there is no DVD blank present, and terminates.	St
1.3.4	It burns CDs just fine) By 'the usual hardware removal', do you mean remove the device in device manager, or physically remove the device, or both?	St
1.3.5	Then I think I can navigate the upper/lower filters thing.	St
1.3.6	Although, should I try that first, and see if the problem clears?	St
1.3.7	Thanks again for your help Perry B	St

1.4.2	Example about those registry entries -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/270008 In closing, I can't count how many will reply the error message doesn't show on their machine and fail to remove the noted registry entries.	St
1.4.3	I won't explain further that I use the articles for how/what to remove.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I will proceed as you advise.	St

1.7.1	The advice above is what should be a first response given the symptoms.	St
1.7.2	There are other symptoms which change the answer but this one is fairly safe (as safe as can be!)	St
1.7.3	so we always give it a shot with these symptoms.	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	but can not figure out how to remove the upper and lower filters.	St
1.8.2	Any guidance would be appreciated.	St
1.8.3	Thanks, Guy	St
1.9.1	Find a friend that knows about this to help you.	St
1.9.2	The instructions are there but not everyone should be doing this so it's ok to get help locally at times.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	when I rum regeidt and look at the key in the MS article you posted I don't see anything called upper or lower filters.	St
1.11.1	This paper has the procedure for changing the registry.	St
