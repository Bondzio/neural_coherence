your a bit paranoid in the wrong way everything your saying is useless is just rather pointless stuff to complain about, and it's stuff any basic knowledge or logic could dictate you either keep and use, or remove because your not using it all machines, including those you custom build, boot with a very open set-up, very few operating systems are designed to view the world as ineherently bad, microsoft has finally now just realized (seemingly, as if they didn't know problems existed before...) that the internet isn't this forum of intellectual exchange comparable to the roman forums, but instead a place filled with problems and lots of people trying to destroy other people's computers just because it makes them feel oh so special your basically saying that because you have to do a slight ammount of work it therefore makes the machine bad or unworthy, that isn't true, that isn't true at all consider anything else in life, you have to put something in to get something back, you can't just expect the pc to be able to protect itself 100% of the time 24/7, you have to secure it yourself and continually ensure it's security...
