power supply does not control the temp of the cpu!.
you can buy a shim for the processor and use thermal grease to help the cpu heatsink and fan you currently if this does not help you can upgrade the heatsink and fan to a better and faster version.
then there is the noise level you must contend with.
reaserch the fans for noise and fan size and speed before you buy.
whats quite for me maybe unacceptable for you!.
