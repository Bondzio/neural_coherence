1762	0	342976	3044774	NR	ccs004	5/15/09 7:56 PM	1.24241736E12	New CPU, No Display	I just got a new Core 2 Quad, Q9550, to replace my core 2 duo, E6600, but when I installed it there is no display on the monitor. I checked to see if i installed it right, which I did, but still no display. I have since put my old processor back, and my computer works fine. Anyone know what might be wrong?
