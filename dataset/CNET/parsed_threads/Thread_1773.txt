<s> i have a pentium 4 build from scratch, i'm using a intel motherboard model D865GLCL at a bus speed of 400mhz. </s>
<s> I notice in a catalog from tiger direct.com that my mother board can go up to 800mhz. </s>
<s> I want to know how i can boost it up and do it my self. </s>
<s> Please help, thanks cnet's best visitor bigfoot </s>
<s> Most likely, this is done through the BIOS. </s>
<s> When your PC boots up, go into your BIOS options (usually press F1, F2, or Del), and change the FSB setting. </s>
<s> If you use dual idental memory modules (DIMMs) the system will run at 800Mhz if you set it for that. </s>
<s> You do need PC3200 memory for this to work. </s>
<s> Since you didn't mention the specs. </s>
<s> of your cpu, I can only guess that your cpu is probably 400 mhz fsb, in which case, that's as fast as it will go without overclocking. </s>
<s> i'm running 2.00ghz and 496 m-ram, so what should i do please tell me..thanks kevin </s>
<s> If you are using memory in marched pairs then go into CMOS setup (the BIOS) and you should be able to find the setting to run the bus at full speed. </s>
<s> Unfortunately you won't be able to increase your front end bus speed very much because your P4 2.0 Bus speed is 400MHz by default. </s>
<s> You either have to by a new P4 with the FSB of 800MHz or you can try to overclock it using the Intel Desktop Control Center which should be on the disc you got with your board or download it from Intel. </s>
<s> It will only increase your FSB speed 4% but I guess that's better than nothing. </s>
<s> What I would really suggest is getting a faster P4 that supports Hyper Threading and has a FSB of 800MHz to begin with. </s>
<s> Your board would automatically recognize it and you would not have to make any Bios adjustments. </s>
