I have a V2 Premier and I had the same problem.
The problem was using a USB connection to the cable modem instead of network cable.
I used a Belkin network cable between the CPU and the cable modem and the problem was instantly solved.
I was rather mad that only 1 tech out of 5 had the answer to the problem.
ShopNBC uses their ''layers of support'' as a selling point, but the support is pretty bad.
After upgrading the IGP (yuck) video to a GeoForce FX 5500, and replacing the 512 mb of PC2700 RAM with 1 gig of PC3200 RAM, the computer is running very, very well.
