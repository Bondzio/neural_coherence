i'm not sure you entirely understood my problem... and at this point i do have a little more specific info as well.
here is a cut from the log file now using a fvs114 and the netgear vpn client software.
keep in mind that there is already a vpn using this gateway that work properly as long as no other vpn's are enabled.
that is between 2 fvs114's.
also keep in mind that i have a completely different vpn tunnel to a different office all together using the client software and is work fantastically and the vpn setups are almost identical with the exception of the ip addresses of course.
