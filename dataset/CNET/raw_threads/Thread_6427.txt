It has a 3.2 gHz P4 HT processor that, according to the internal sensor is running at about 70-80 degrees C normally. The sensors may be a bit off i suppose, but the heatsink is hot to the touch and I have been having problems with random restarts for years. Building this PC was the last thing I did with hardware other than routine maintanance on it, so I'm a bit rusty. The PC has been degrading in performance steadily for the past 3 or 4 years, even when used on software of its era, so I think overheating may be the problem. Diagnostic software such as everest and Hirens find no problems in anything of my comp much to my dismay of not having an easy fix. Is there a way to reduce the CPU temp or is damage from running at high temp for so long permenant. My heatsink fan is stuck at 5000 + RPMs, which I previously thought would discourage overheat so I didn't attempt to fix it, but is this causing a problem itself? I could try and reseat the heatsink, but wanted to get some opinions before I do anything that could make the situation worse, as I definitely cannot afford to buy another processor right now. It has been about 7 years since this particular heatsink was added so could I need to take it off and apply more thermal paste perhaps? Any input would be much appriciated.

If you manage to repair your mainboard I would seriously consider spending a little cash on some better cooling solutions. Mike

Since the last time applied was 7yrs. ago, it wouldn't hurt to remove and clean cpu itself and reapply thermo paste. Now, only a little bit goes a long way. Inspect the fan be sure it 100% clean and dust free itself or replace with similar fan. Then assure proper remount of fan(HSF) onto the cpu. While you're at it, clean out the entire PC case. Check!!! the frt. cover vents, as many users don't remove it and clean that out. Its usually the air inlet to the case. I find that alone can an undisclosed area to check. Check also all the replies you had here as they all make sense. Excluding any damage to cpu, it should work better than before, if not, then maybe another is at fault or the cpu is cooked. Intel cpus will run at lower speeds if too hot and then start shutdown when hi-temp reached. There are other cpu monitoring s/w, freebie that work great and can report the status as well, like CPUID and my favorite, PCWizard 2010(entire system report), but google for others. To check for proper thermo paste application, google &quot;Artic Silver&quot; and follow instructions. tada -----Willy
