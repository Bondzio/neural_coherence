im in desperate need for a new gaming computer and have a very limited budget.
i can't afford to look at the new high end computer componants.
if your pc is starting to die i would think about getting one asap.
stick to the reputable components like popular graphics card (eg geforce 6800)and amd athlon 64bit 3200+ cpu.
this sort of setup will be good for gaming today (although you might not be able to run on full detail)and will be cheap as bigrinoz explained.
just you make sure you get components that can be upgraded at a later date, like a motherboard that supports dual cpus and high amounts of ram (4gb) and graphics cards that support sli (although ive heard that sli is a right pain).
general rule (for me anyway) - buy now, but buy upgrade friendly components so you will be ok in a couple of years.
(ps.
my first post!)
