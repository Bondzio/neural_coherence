i am sorry but.... i would never buy another netgear.
i have had problems with mine and the tech support i had with them was horrid!
i almost just forgot about accepting the new one and bought a different brand (after hours of trouble shotting...of which they finally decided was defective).
it was such a terrible experience i wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
i actually had laryngitis when i called and the tech insulted me..and all senior citizens...thinking i was old and incapable.
my son also has similar problems with his and has to unplug the router and wireless and plug back in on a very frequent basis.
