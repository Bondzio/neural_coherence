here's my problem: my internet connection keeps failing on me every 10mins.
i'm still connected to my network but i can't access any sites at all unless i right-click and use the 'repair' function.
it started happening a couple of weeks ago and it's still happening even after i formatted my disk.
there are other computers connected to this network and all of them seem to work properly.
my laptop's connection is excellent when i use it on the same room and with the same wireless connection.
i already tried using microsoft's fixit but it's still the same.
help, anyone?
this is getting very annoying.
