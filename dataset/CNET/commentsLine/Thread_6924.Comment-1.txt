looking for a &quot;possible&quot; cpu upgrade.
i'm running a epox ep-9nda3j with a athlon xp 4000 64bit along with 2 gigs of ocs ram and a xf 7800 gs.
i'm heavily into gaming.
so now, if i purchase a athlon xp 64 x2 3800, would i benefit at all or would i loose power.
if not the 3800, what about the 4200, 4400 or 4800-which is rare, and prices are through the roof for socket 939 boards.
any advice would help.
thanks.
