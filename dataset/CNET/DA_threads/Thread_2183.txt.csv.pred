1.1.1	hey guys i just wanted to see if anyone could help me make a new computer config using newegg.com or tigerdirect.com.	St
1.1.2	I was just going to get one off of a website or something but i really think building one would be fun and make the system hold a sense of ownership.	St
1.1.3	All i really need is a setup that would work with the CPU and GPUs i want i just dont know what else i would need like right size case, cables, and or other stuff like that.	St
1.1.4	pretty much i need everthing else to house a AMD 4000+ CPU and two OCed nvidia 7800 GT graphic cards and a 600watt SLI rdy power supply.	St
1.1.5	This is what i got so far off tigerdirect for bout a grand &gt;AMD Athlon 64 4000+ / 1MB Cache / 2000MHz FSB / Socket 939 / San Diego Core / Processor with Fan &gt;Two (2) XFX GeForce 7800 GT Overclocked 256MB DDR3 PCI Express Video Cards and an Ultra X-Finity 600 Watt Power Supply (comes with 600 power supply) I havnt done this before and im only looking to spend about 1600+ but if there is a way to keep the price down i would like to have a FX53 cpu:) and no dual core stuff plz i know it rocks and i will upgrade later when every game is dual cored thanks	St
1.2.1	on my 4000+ CPU should i get the clawhammer or san diego?	St
1.3.1	here http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128301 case your choice.	St
1.3.2	but i would go for these 3 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811129154 black http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811133132 silver http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811133133 need hard drive windows xp optical drives 1 gb of memory 1 tube of arctic silver thermal compound keyboard,mouse,speakers, monitor?	St
1.4.1	Hmm $1600+ for a system with dual overclocked 7800GT's and an FX-53?	St
1.4.2	Sorry it won't happen.	St
1.4.3	You said you want the 4000+ and are going to upgrade in the future; I suggested dual-core but we had this conversation already in your previous post.	St
1.4.4	Why would you get a powerful processor like the 4000+ when a cheaper alternative will work just fine?	St
1.4.5	Games aren't heavily depended on the processor, memory and graphics card matter the most in gaming.	St
1.4.6	Here this would be my system build, so that you won't have to spend a whole great deal now and you can upgrade in the future.	St
1.4.7	Processor Case Hard Drive OpticalDrive Motherboard Memory That is about all the parts you need right now.	St
1.4.8	Of course you got your power supply, along with the graphics cards so no problem there.	St
1.4.9	You will need your own copy of the OS.	St
1.4.10	The case I suggested is great because it allows for plenty of airflow, critical for your hot running overclocked graphics cards.	St
1.4.11	Get some Artic Silver thermal compound if you are going to overclock the processor, or in general want a reliable thermal compound.	St
1.4.12	I believe the processor ships with the compound (but that is the cheap kind).	St
1.4.13	You might want more case fans, or a better heatsink; all up to you.	St
1.4.14	The components is the list may tip over $1600 (along with your graphics cards and your power supply), but they are quality products that will last you for a long time.	St
1.5.1	I'm assuming you don't need Monitor,Keyboard,Mouse,Speakers,Floppy Drive/Media-card-reader,Printer Don't forget Operating System and arctic silver thermal compound.	St
1.5.2	AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Manchester Socket 939 Processor-325 GIGABYTE GA-K8NF-9 Socket 939 NVIDIA nForce4-4X ATX AMD Motherboard - Retail-76 CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB (2 x 512MB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 (PC 3200) Unbuffered Dual Channel Kit System Memory Model VS1GBKIT400-73 Western Digital Caviar SE WD800JD 250GB 7200 RPM Serial ATA150 Hard Drive-99 2xNEC Black IDE DVD Burner Model ND-3550A-80 2x7800GTs & PSU=~700 Total $1373, giving you around $200 to use for, either to upgrade the ram, hard drive, motherboard, processor, sound card, case Sound Card if desired, and takes off load from cpu Case Extra Cooling Fans if desired	St
1.6.1	That motherboard you suggested the GIGABYTE GA-K8NF-9 Socket 939 NVIDIA nForce4-4X can't handle SLI, and also Sharpiessharp doesn't want dual-core processors for some reason, only wants single core processors.	St
