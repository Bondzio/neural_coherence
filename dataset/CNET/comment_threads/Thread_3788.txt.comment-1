I have an old motherboard that is used in a Digital Video Recorder.
The motherbaord is a 2003 Bayfield, the memory chip is a 256MB SDRAM DDR DIMM 184 PC133.
I want to put a 1 Gig chip in but not sure if the faster chips will work in the motherboard.
I dont need the faster speed chip, but they are all that is available now and also much cheaper.
Do you think a PC2700 or something similar will work in a 2003 Bayfield Motherboard.
I think all it takes is One Memory Chip.
I haven't opened the case up yet because I need it recording my store.
Thanks!
