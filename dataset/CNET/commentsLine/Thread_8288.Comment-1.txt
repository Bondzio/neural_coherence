hello, i am a beginner so my apologies if i do not understand or have to ask again anyways, i just got a toshiba laptop with windows 8 pre-installed.
it had a 1 tb hard drive and i added another 1 tb as it has a slot i want to install linux.
how should i go about partitioning my extra hard drive that i added?
currently it is unallocated and currently i do not see this hard drive i added in the list of my drives in the my computer but yes i do see it in the disk management area any help is much appreciated
