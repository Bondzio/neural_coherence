I too am in same position.
Thought Costco might even have Memorial Day specdial on this machine, but if they do not, I will buy it.
Waiting, I think it will go off market and be unavailable at this price but who knows.If you wait there are always new things and then you never get anything...that has been what I have done for the last few years.
Now, I am buying.
