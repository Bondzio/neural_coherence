1.1.1	System Info : AMD Athlon XP 3200+ Asus A7N8X Deluxe Rev .	St
1.1.2	2 Mobo 2 * 256MB Corsair TwinX LL PC3200 DIMMs 80GB Hitachi Deskstar SATA Hard Disk ATI Radeon 9800 XT ( AGP 8 ) Antec TruBlu 480Watt PSU Wavemaster Coolermaster TAC-T01 Mid Tower Case ( 3 * 8mm case fans ) Internal Iomaga Zip 250 Drive DVD-RW/CD-RW Combo drive DVD-Rom Windows XP Pro SP1 Samsung 213T 21.3 '' TFT Problem : When I first boot the system up ( after it has been off for a few hours ) , I am able to see the POST and the beginning of Windows Launch , however just before Windows loads up properly the system stops outputting graphics .	St
1.1.3	After leaving it run for a few minutes and then performing a cold restart ( need to stop doing that I know ) the system will boot up properly .	St
1.1.4	It is n't the my display as I 've tried with a selection of others ( TFTs and CRTs ) .	St
1.1.5	I then thought that there may have been too much of a strain on the PSU , so disconnected 2 of the fans plus all of the drives , but am still having the same problem .	St
1.1.6	I suspect that it may be a loose connection somewhere , which is solved when the system heats up and connections expand - but I could be wrong .	St
1.1.7	As a last resort I will probably disconnect and reinstall everything , but before I do I 'd most appreciate any help from anyone who may have had a similar problem or may have a theory about a possible cause .	St
1.1.8	Thanks in advance Harinder	St
1.2.1	When you 1st boot-up and see the booting display , that 's the h/w output on basic default level .	St
1.2.2	Once it starts the XP OS , etc. , its gettig into the & quot ; desired & quot ; display output selected and since you have a full plate , expect it to take time .	St
1.2.3	Swapping out displays while a good idea for h/w , is n't 100 % for s/w issues .	St
1.2.4	The next time on a cold boot , just walk away and see what the results are , before doing anything drastic , allow at least 10min..	St
1.2.5	If you have n't alrady clean the system of old files , old pgms .	St
1.2.6	etc.. that simply are used or long in tooth , decide what stays .	St
1.2.7	Then find some & quot ; registry cleaner & quot ; to better handle the tidbits to best final clean the system .	St
1.2.8	This will reduce prolonged boot-ups too as the registry is n't as long as before upon boot checking .	St
1.2.9	Then finally & quot ; defrag the HD & quot ; for tidy-up sdome more .	St

1.3.1	Take out the video card and re-seat it .	St
1.3.2	First , take a soft pencil eraser and lightly go over the contacts to get rid of any residue that might have collected there .	St
1.3.3	If this or Willy 's suggestions do n't work then consider a new video card .	St
1.3.4	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.4.1	It does kind of sound like a cold solder joint or connection .	St
1.4.2	I would first suspect A : Graphics card or B : system board .	St
1.4.3	Try opening up your system before power up and warm it up with a hair dryer then power up .	St
1.4.4	If it comes up , good guess is connection or solder joint and go from there .	St

1.6.1	Hi , Apologies for the very , very late reply / update , I had just started a new job .	St
1.6.2	To update the situation , I had kind of side stepped the problem by swapping my Radeon 9800XT with my brother 's old Geforce 2 MX .	St
1.6.3	My card has been in his 1.5GHz P4 system for a number of months now , and he has had no problems , and vice versa , I have had no problems with using his in mine .	St
1.6.4	I guess it makes sense that the BIOS/POST is n't making drastic demands on the G card .	St
1.6.5	I recently carried out a clean install and upgraded the XP to SP2 .	St
1.6.6	I will be re-installing the card to see if this solves the problem .	St
1.6.7	Regards Harinder	St
1.7.1	Hi Jack , Thank you for the info , I did try this but it did n't seem to make a difference .	St
1.7.2	The graphics card has been working fine in my brother 's P4 system for a number of months now , and his Geforce 2 MX has been working fine in my system without any problems for the same period of time .	St
1.7.3	I have just carried out a clean install , so will be swapping them back again pretty soon .	St
1.7.4	Regards , Harinder	St
1.8.1	Hi , I did try this , but it did n't seem to make a difference , saying that though , the card did sometimes sit at a 'funny ' angle .	St
1.8.2	Regards , Harinder	St
1.9.1	It seems like quite a useful tool ...	St
1.9.2	Regards , Harinder	St
1.10.1	Hi All , Another chapter in this horrid saga , I purchased a new BFG GeForce 7800 GS OC last week ( yes I gave up on my poor 9800XT ) , and it is having exactly the same problem .	St
1.10.2	The card boots up to the login screen and is stable , but once you login , it restarts without even getting to the desktop , restarts a few more times and then freezes at the POST directly after the RAM check has completed .	St
1.10.3	The 7800 ( maybe the fan ) also gives out what sounds like a high pitched beep .	St
1.10.4	Have once again had to revert back to my ancient GeForce 2 MX400 , and as usual it gives me no problems .	St
1.10.5	Contacted , BFG support and tried their suggestions ( they 've been very helpful ) , they have kindly offered to replace it ( which I will take up if my new PSU and Mobo still do n't fix the problem ) .	St
1.10.6	Have now ordered a new OCZ ModStream 520W PSU , if that still does n't solve the issue , I will try replacing the Mobo .	St
1.10.7	Will update to let you all know happens .	St
1.10.8	In the meantime , does anyone have any other suggestions as to what the most likely culprit is .	Ques
1.10.9	Thanks in advance for all your suggestions , Regards , Harinder	St
