I configured one on newegg with Socket 939 and it came to about $900. I configured another with Socket AM2 for about $1000. Is it worth $100 more to go with AM2? I heard it's only 1% faster.

Besides the AM2 is going to be the future of cpus from AMD, so really get it if you can. HOWEVER, if you wait just a little longer the &quot;older&quot; stuff will come down in cost for sure, maybe in 30days or so. You should already see some lessing of pricing of older cpus, etc.. tada -----Willy
