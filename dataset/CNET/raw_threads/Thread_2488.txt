Hi, i am currently building a pc, and i am considering using a sempron processor(because it is cheaper)... Now here comes the question: Will it work on a K7VME Soyo motherboard? The motherboard has socket A and it works with athlons xp's up to 3000+. Thanks!! I appreciate all the answers!

You may not want it either. http://www.techwarelabs.com/reviews/processors/sempron/ It's another answer to the Celeron and you may be shortchanging yourself. Be sure to check the processor compatibility list at the motherboard maker. Bob
