<s> Greetings. </s>
<s> I was hoping someone could assist me. </s>
<s> I have a Maxtor OneTouch II Drive I have used for the past year. </s>
<s> For some reason when I've tried to access it (via my computer and multiple other computers) I cannot find my files. </s>
<s> I never manually deleted them, so I'm confused as to where they went. </s>
<s> When I plug in the usb to a computer, the drive IS recognized. </s>
<s> But it dopes NOT show any of the files. </s>
<s> When I click on &quot;properties&quot; it lists a capacity of only 87 GB instead of the full 300+ GB. </s>
<s> This harddrive is my primary backup and the contents are desperately needed for my business. </s>
<s> I've spoken with Maxtor and recieved little help. </s>
<s> When I use the Windows Disk Management function it tells me that there are 87 GB available and 192 GB &quot;Unallocated&quot;. </s>
<s> I've seen through a generic recovery program that there are files there (although I can only see extentions and not any actual file names). </s>
<s> So it appears that the 192 GB are the files I am looking for. </s>
<s> My question then is: How do I access/recover these files that are showing up as &quot;Unallocated&quot;? </s>
<s> Any ideas, data status theories, or places to outsource the recovery to? </s>
<s> Thanks, Matt </s>
<s> And should clear up as soon as SP2 is intalled. </s>
<s> Sorry but these minute details matter. </s>
<s> Hope it's this usual. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> SP2 is installed on the computer the OneTouch is plugged into. </s>
<s> There are companies that specialize in this but was it formatted in FAT32? </s>
<s> That's not resistant to damage. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> ZAR or Zero Assumption Recovery. </s>
<s> If it works then it's a simple question of &quot;are my files worth it?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I know what your talking about, i have had my external hard drive die on me twice, but both times i have been saved by Runtime Get Data Back (click &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.runtime.org/faq_gdb.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt; for there FAQ)as long as you haven't put anything new on the drive it should find the lost files fine, it even works if you have formatted the hard drive. </s>
<s> you can download the trial version from there &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.runtime.org/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; site &lt;/a&gt; , however you cannot save the files the trial version finds, as far as I know you can view them. </s>
<s> there are two different versions, for FAT and NTFS. </s>
<s> you obviously want the one for your hard drives file system. </s>
