spooky or what?
i turned my machine on this morning and have exactly the same problems.
power supply fan and cpu fan both start,again no beeps from the memory, monitor led doesn't change from amber to green.
tried pressing reset button but nothing happens, pressed power button again nothing, only way to turn off is to disconnect from mains power supply.
wondered if there may have ben a power surge overnight?
anybody got any ideas?
otherwise it's going to be case of swapping each componant into another machine one at a time to find the fault.
regards mike
