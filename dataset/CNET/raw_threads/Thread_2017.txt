I had to recently replace the CPU Fan, I also bought the Maxtor Hard drive as the WD80 was showing a permanet blue screen and installed XP home as my XP Pro wouldnt install, the machine then repaired the fault and I disconnected the new Maxtor 6Y120. It doesnt make a difference whether both hard drives are connected or the main WD80.

If that is the case, there might be a problem in the motherboard. Check the capacitors near the power supply (there are 3 or 5 big capacitors in there as compared to other capacitors some read 2200 uf or 1500 uf 3.3 volts), is it bulging on top (showing a burnt-up capacitor)? The capacitors in there control or maintain the power supplied to various parts. Once they are busted, there will be low power output supply to various parts. The DVR or CD ROM LED's may light-up but will not operate since LED's require a small amount of current to light-up. Burnt-up capacitors sometimes show after you had put your electronic equipment off, since they had exhausted its reserved charge when they were idle and no power is supplied to it.

My wife was powering off, and a program was hanging the shutdown (Win 98), then the screen went black. Next day I found the vid card was blown. Popped in another, no bootup. Pulled all hardware except ram and cpu; no beep, no BIOS. Sent it to shop, and it turns out my motherboard just died. Can't say whether the amd 1.4 chip is dead or not, as there were no other boards to test in. Just installed another motherboard and Intel chip. All other hardware survived, best that I can determine. But do try to get into your BIOS; this will at least give you a hint as to what *may* have failed. Good luck.
