my pc: hp pavilion media center m7750n athlon 64 x2 (w) 5000+ 2.6 ghz 4 gb ddr2 ram 400 gb sata 7200rpm hd running vista i purchased a hp 1tb personal media drive to use in the removable drive bay about 1 month ago.
well the drive is loud and rather annoying to say the least.
i have one free internal 3.5&quot; bay available.
is there any preference (internal or external) with regards to speed, noise and performance if i wanted to replace the noisy drive?
my use for the drive would be to store all my media and the drive would be used frequently as i stream my media to my ps3.
any good brands to use?
thanks in advance
