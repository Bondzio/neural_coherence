you want to upgrade your mtrbd, thus that tells me you want to keep the mtrbd.. if not, then you replace the mtrbd.
you will have problems.
as the other poster mentioned, you will need a new os install cd, as most oem type cds provide install only for the system or brand they were sold under.
while you can swap much of the old system(h/w) to a new mtrbd.
you're stuck getting the drivers when the new os has been installed.
vista, being a pita if you stay with it, may not have vista available drivers from their vendors once you correctly id the proper drivers needed.
if you stay with the old mtrb.
and the whole purpose was to reduce or remove bottleneck, then really what was the point if you blame the mtrbd.
as the bottleneck fault.
be sure to check dell's support website for any bios updates that may address some issues and if they apply to you, then you need them.
hopefull, that may address yopur bottleneck issue.
