i have successfully revived 5 hard drives using the following technique.
i found that the problem was not the drive assembly but the controller board attached on the drive.
my process: 1. buy an identical hard drive.
my experience tells me it must be exactly the same, right down to the manufacturer, part number, size, speed, etc.
2. remove the controller board from the good drive and swap with the controller from the bad drive.
the screw head type varies - torx, allen, phillips, etc.
3. install and boot or read from the old hard drive with the new controller on the drive installed.
transfer the data to a known good drive.
4. you can continue to use the old drive with the new board, or swap back and use the new drive with the new board.
this beats the many dollars data recovery companies charge to recover data for the price of a new drive.
hey, if it doesn't work, at least you have a new hard drive you can use.
