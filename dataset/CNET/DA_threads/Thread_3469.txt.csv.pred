1.1.1	hello , I installed a 6 ( 1 internal , 5 external ) hub usb 2.0 card on my pc .	St
1.1.2	it is a PIII 800mhz , running xp professional with 752mb ram .	St
1.1.3	I thought it was working fine , but I plugged in two devices to them , a wd backup external hdd , and a dazzle hi-speed usb 2.0 memory card reader/writer .	St
1.1.4	now , when I either turn them on , or turn the computer on with them plugged in , i get a yellow baloon on the bottom right with this message ( paraphrazed ) : & quot ; this device can work faster if you plug it into a usb 2.0 hub .	St
1.1.5	Click here for a list of available hubs. & quot ; when I hit that , it seems to show the ones they are plugged in ( the computer has 8usb ports .	St
1.1.6	two 1.1 's that came with the pc , and the 6 ( one internal ) that I installed and where these devices are plugged into ) .	St
1.1.7	Now , I know those devices are plugged into the 2.0 card I put in .	St
1.1.8	I tried to look online for some kind of usb speed check , much like you find for internet speed connection , to compare the 1.1 's to the 2.0 's , but had no luck .	St
1.1.9	does anyone have any suggestions on this .	Ques
1.1.10	If I am getting the usb 1.1 and could get it to work as fast as the usb2.0 , it would make backing up the computer and writing/transfering memory cards much faster .	St
1.1.11	thank you for your help .	Polite
1.1.12	L.A .	St
1.2.1	forgot to ad , I have SP2 in there as well .	St
1.3.1	Either the hardware is not USB 2 functional or incorrect drivers are installed .	St
1.3.2	Make sure all drivers for the MB devices are up to date .	Res
1.3.3	Sometimes Windows does not install the correct ones for some reason .	St
1.3.4	If the hardware is compatible and the USB 2 drivers are on the system but not installed , you can sometimes just remove and redetect the USB components .	St
1.3.5	Windows should find and use the best drivers .	St
1.3.6	Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	Most of the USB ports that came on PIII systems less than 1Ghz were only USB 1.1 .	St
1.4.2	To upgrade to USB 2 you can get an add-on PCI card .	St
1.4.3	My P4 system came with USB 1.1 , so I picked up a five port USB 2 PCI card and put it in my computer .	St
1.4.4	It has four external ports and one internal port and cost less than $ 20 at Fry 's .	St
1.4.5	If you are not afraid of working on your own system pick up a card , install the software that comes with it first , and then slipped the PCI card into any open slot on your motherboard .	St
1.4.6	Make sure you screw in tightly , move all your USB plugs to the new card and reboot your machine .	Sug
1.4.7	As long you as you use the new card you should not see that pesky message again .	St
1.5.1	Thanks Steven , I tried re-installing the drivers using device manager , but the wizard said that ''XP can not find better drivers for your device '' .	St
1.5.2	the other thing is that although this is a 6port usb hub , when I check the device manager for installed hardware and click usb , it shows the ports , but it just lists one as an ''enhanced Pci to usb host controler '' does this means the pc is only recognizing one of the the 6 hubs as a 2.0 , or is that the way that they usually show up on the device manager .	St
1.5.3	I tried to paste a snapshot here , but I could n't figure it out .	St
1.5.4	I had it as a paint file !	St
1.5.5	PS b_derf , this is a new usb card .	St
1.5.6	I got it about 3 months ago .	St
1.6.1	Do n't let Windows look for the better drivers .	St
1.6.2	Force Windows to look specifically where they are ... .be it on a disk or extracted to a folder on the HD .	St
1.6.3	Again , I would try removing and letting Windows redetect the USB components .	St
1.6.4	I have done this successfully with MB USB devices but not add in cards .	St
1.6.5	It might be worth a try .	Sug
