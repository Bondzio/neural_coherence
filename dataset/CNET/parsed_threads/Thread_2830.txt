<s> I am trying to install a SATA connected DVD writer. </s>
<s> I have hooked up the SATA connection and see there is another cable to attach to the back of the DVD_RW It is the same connection going to my hard drive, I assume it the power cable. </s>
<s> My problem is this, it is too short. </s>
<s> Can I get an extension and what is that type of cable called. </s>
<s> Is this an internal sata dvd-rw drive (didn't know they have those thing)? </s>
<s> If not then what brand of portable case is it? </s>
<s> Just wondering. </s>
<s> What's the model number of the DVD burner? </s>
<s> So, you connected the SATA data cable. </s>
<s> Good. </s>
<s> Now you need to connect a power cable. </s>
<s> The drive itself will take a PSU cable with one of two endings: 1. </s>
<s> 15-pin SATA power connector 2. </s>
<s> 4-pin Molex power connector The one you need is determined by the type of power connector your DVD burner has. </s>
<s> If you need an SATA power connector, but you only have a free 4-pin Molex connector, get an adapter cable. </s>
<s> If you just need more length, there are extenders and y-cables that will get you there. </s>
