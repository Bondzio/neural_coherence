do you know if these individuals will be in fixed sites or will they be roaming?
since you said they are located across the country, i'll suggest you look up vpns and use virtual private networking.
they could have access either by wired or wireless from many locations.
you mentioned ftp which is simply for file transfer so i presume it's for document sharing.
you'll need a server somewhere that's open to the web.
my best suggestion, since you said you're not an it guy, is to hire one.
i can't tell you who to turn to as this depends on your location.
you may have someone in your city who you can call that would be happy to sit down with you and chat about your needs.
