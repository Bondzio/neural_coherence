Inexpensive TVs won't have the color range or accuracy of a good 22&quot; or 24&quot; monitor ($300 - $400).
They'll also have a lower resolution (1366x768 or 1280x720 vs 1680x1050 or 1920x1200).
If you'd also like to watch high def TV, consider this viewsonic with an HD tuner and high resolution: http://www.viewsonic.com/products/lcdtv/NX2232w/ Choppy DVD playback could be due to a slow (by current standards) CPU.
Most new video cards offer decoding assist to help the CPU so they may help you in that respect.
