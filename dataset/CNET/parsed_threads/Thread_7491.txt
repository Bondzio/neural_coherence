<s> Right now I have two sticks of ddr3 1333 4GB. </s>
<s> I am thinking of getting two more sticks of ddr3 1600 4GB. </s>
<s> What I want to know is if I mix the two RAM speeds will my computer use both speeds equally, use the faster speed RAM first, or will it underclock the faster sticks to match the slower ones? </s>
<s> The bus speed drops to the lowest speed on the CPU bus. </s>

<s> Does that mean that the ddr3 1600 underclocks to ddr1333? </s>
<s> Im not on the geek squad..yet,but from wat i've seen,it defaults to the lowest MHZ....yes. </s>
<s> so would it be faster to have just the 8GB of 1600 or 16GB of 1333? </s>
<s> If I were to guess that GAMES or PHOTOSHOP then the 8GB wins. </s>
<s> If I were to guess some DATABASE in 16GB RAM then the 16GB wins. </s>
<s> The winner depends on the question. </s>

<s> file sizes you're running. </s>
<s> If the file sizes are small... the RAM over 4GB may never get used. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I would go with the 16GB's...definitely. </s>
<s> Your doubling your memory,and only losing 1267mhz...i wouldn't think twice dmobbjr. </s>
<s> ...but then again,i'm the guy who posted &quot;can i run two power supplies?&quot;.lol </s>
<s> I can't subtract apparently...your losing 267mhz. </s>
<s> My advice doesn't exactly instill confidence.lol </s>
<s> I am using this compute for gaming so it sounds like I should go with 8GB </s>
