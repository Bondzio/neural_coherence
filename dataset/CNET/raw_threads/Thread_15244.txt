At initial startup running at 1.2GHz (FSB 122), it reads both my HD, but when I clock the FSB to 333, it does not find my SATA drive. I have a 500W power supply and wonder if I require more power or if this is a whole different problem.

Suggest checking out the PSUs at http://www.Newegg.com ....read the buyer reviews, writeups .... take a look at PCPower and Cooling, Corsair, Seasonic, etc., ... they get great reviews and they have 3 or 5 year warranties. In PSUs...you want quality, stability and reliability. You can read more about PSUs over at http://www.jonnyguru.com Let us know how it goes. VAPCMD
