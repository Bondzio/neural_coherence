Can a bigger size hard drive, e.g.-2tb 16mb cache, & cache make an operating system,e.g.-windows xp, boot-up & multi-task faster? In-other words, make a system's O.S. more efficiently faster? What other specs make a h.d. faster?

SATA 3 is common and SATA 6 is just out. It should provide some improvements over SATA 3. SCSI seems to still take the prize with platter type devices. Solid state HDs didn't offer much (if any) improvement over platter types initially but are gaining ground. All I know is what I read and all I told is only what I've read so take it with a grain of salt.

Compare a 5 millisecond seek to the 6 millisecond seek and you soon discover that buffers pale in comparison to payback. Bob

You might want to scan the drive for errors, defragment it, move most used programs to the inner tracks and see if the manufacturer has any utilities such as ones that lengthen the timeout, etc. FiOS-Dave

Put simply, the less there is to look through the faster you accomplish the find. With the rotational speed and low seek times once you've looked up what you want the quicker that happens. Overall though, a small (60GB ish) solid state disk is the speediest option. Apart from the most specialised HDD none beat them as they operate at almost teh speed of memory. HTH
