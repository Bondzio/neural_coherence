well first, is there a disk in the floppy drive?
try removing it, then rebooting.
that message means there's no os on the first disk drive of the &quot;boot sequence.&quot; if the error is not because of the bios looking for an os on the floppy, even if your hard drive operating system files are corrupted/gone, with a little perseverance you can remove the drive and hook it up to your other machine and get the data files off it that way-- assuming of course, that the drive still works.
