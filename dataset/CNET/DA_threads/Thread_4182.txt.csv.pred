St
1.1.3	any method can solve it ?	Ques
1.1.4	thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	I 've found some ports and machines to cause this .	St
1.2.2	So try it elsewhere first so you do n't lose weeks chasing that old issue .	Sug
1.2.3	Next up ?	Ques
1.2.4	Recovery softwares like http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=USB+PEN+DRIVE+DATA+RECOVERY as well as these titles you find with google.com PC FILE INSPECTOR ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY GETDATABACK To preemptively answer the usual question I 'm writing that if you feel the data is not worth buying a solution then you 've put a price on the files .

1.3.1	Its a common problem , but maybe these may help .	St
1.3.2	First , flash drives do go kaput and no amount of help will be enough , they 're dead .	St
1.3.3	Next , some recovery s/w can help but again depending on the physical damage ( ESD/static ) may not help .	St
1.3.4	Here 's link to such , look for others if cost is a problem : http : //www.freedownloadscenter.com/Utilities/File_Maintenance_and_Repair_Utilities/USB_Flash_Drive_Data_Recovery.html If you can , try using the flash drive in another system entirely and see if data can be recovered .	St
1.3.5	Last , look at the support website for that flash drive maker and see if they offer any help or clues to recover or resolve the problem .	St
1.3.6	Quite frankly , in most cases I have n't been too successful when this problem comes up in recovering , & quot ; data & quot ; , though sometimes re-use of the flash drive comes back , but that 's not saving the data .	St
1.3.7	It 's important in the future to duplicate data to a system folder whenever possible .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
