this may be just a helluva coincidence, but it's happening, from one day to the next, on my home net and on the office net.
it started happening after i installed the latest win and ie security updates from microsoft.
i can't browse the network (&quot;network unavailable&quot; warning) - yet the find command locates any computer on the net and grants access, as does the cd\\&lt;computername&gt; command.
also, any previous links in network neighborhood work.
ics works fine.
in other words, the networks seem to be working perfectly - i just can't browse them - and yesterday, they were browsing normally.
the nets are via ethernet cards, mixed w98, me, xp i'm curious if anyone else is noticing this, because i suspect a ms bug.
