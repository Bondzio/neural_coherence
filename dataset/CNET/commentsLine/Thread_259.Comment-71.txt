first, it's been maybe a month since i did a defrag and i've never done an analysis that tells me the disc needs defragging, but i usually do it anyway, so it shouldn't take long.
i have not yet ordered an external drive.
frankly, i've had a hard time keeping up with you, but i can order it probably in the morning, once i decide what i'm going to order.
my hard drive is 120 gb and it's about half full; there's 67 gb free.
if you need any other specs on the beast, let me know and i'll post what is in this thread 2 or 3 times.
one question: what do you mean by : ``windows has done one of its spike things that happens in the night.''
thanks, ann
