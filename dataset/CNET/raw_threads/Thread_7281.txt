My scumbag boyfriend sold it to me for $50 after he got the Note 8 from Samsung. Anyway, he didn't give me the original charger with it, I can't find the motorolla one he did use and it keeps giving me this message that it wants the original charger instead of the ac adapter I had it hooked up to. I tried it on my PC instead, and still the same message.
