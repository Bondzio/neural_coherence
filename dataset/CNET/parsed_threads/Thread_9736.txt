<s> i have been having a strange problem with my keyboard. </s>
<s> Two keys, the down arrow key and the page down key, are sticking. </s>
<s> But they don't actually stick. </s>
<s> i have had keyboards with sticky keys before, and that is not what this is like. </s>
<s> The keys do not appear to be physically sticking in any way. </s>
<s> The computer acts as if i am holding the keys down. </s>
<s> i don't think it's an issue with dirt because i have removed and cleaned the keys several times. </s>
<s> The keyboard is in great shape and has never had anything spilled on it. </s>
<s> So what else could it be? </s>
<s> This can be a very frustrating problem when it happens at just the wrong time while web browsing or playing a flash game. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>

<s> ...yes,listen to profitt...borrow someones keyboard,or try one u have.Allways solve a problem by starting with the obvious.If the problem remains,see step two (whatever that is ) I've had similar problems,and a new mouse or keyboard solved it.I just spent hours trying to figure out a mouse pointer glitch...the thing would freeze every 10 seconds or so....it seemed like a software issue...it wasn't....the mouse was bad. </s>
<s> It's not the plastic keys but what's underneath them. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard Typically, the ones you use most go first. </s>
<s> You're flexing the domes on the top layer of the keyboard. </s>
<s> They're supposed to pop back into position but they get weaker with age and use. </s>
<s> Eventually they don't return to proper shape and the electrical contacts stay closed...or open...whatever the case may be. </s>
<s> You don't fix these but you replace them. </s>
<s> You can get very good keyboards made for heavy use. </s>
<s> If you're interested, you can try those made in Germany by Cherry. </s>
<s> I've got one...very nice but has a feel that some won't like. </s>
