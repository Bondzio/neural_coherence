Dell XPS 600 Plentium D 3.0 ghz Bus clock 800 mhz 1022 MB ram 2 512 ddr2 cards Psu 650 watt Windows XP SP 3 Home Edition A scan with crucial ram detection program shows I have a ddr2 5300 and ddr2 5200 card installed.
This causes the computer to run at 533 mhz which is the speed of the 5200 card.
I have the option of installing a 2gb set of ddr2 5300 at 667 mhz Or a 2 gb set ddr2 6400 at 800 mhz Price wise the 6400 is only about $4 a set higher that the 5300 With the bus clock at 800 mhz will the 6400 at 800 mhz be faster than the 5300 at 667 mhz.
Which set should I install?
