<s> I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit with a GA-EP45-UD3P (Rev 1.0/1.1) motherboard. </s>
<s> When I play games I get a BSOD STOP 0x0000001E. </s>
<s> It occurred to me I didn't install all my drivers or the new BIOS for my system since updating to Windows 7 64-bit. </s>
<s> I have installed all current hardware drivers, but when I try to install the BIOS it says it is not compatible with 64-bit and to contact the company. </s>
<s> I have contacted them, but without a reply. </s>
<s> Is windows just saying it isn't compatible when I try to run the update in windows, but really is compatible if I used a disk to update the bios? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>

<s> The ability to update the BIOS while Windows is running is a very new trick. </s>
<s> I'm not trying to offend you but if you think back just a few years such updates were done with DOS boot diskettes for years and arcane command lines. </s>
<s> It's improved but I have no qualms with a boot CD or diskette to do this update. </s>

<s> I just updated the BIOS on my GIGA-BYTE P55-UD3R while running Win 7 Pro 64 bit and it went without incident. </s>

<s> Thanks for the input, I appreciate it. </s>
<s> However, I think my question was misunderstood, it's an odd question. </s>
<s> I was trying to ask if, since I tried to update the BIOS within Windows, would it give me a message stating the BIOS update was not compatible with 64-bit windows, EVEN THOUGH it was actually compatible IF I used an alternative method to Windows. </s>
<s> So in essence, should I try to update the BIOS with a USB drive (since that's all I have) even though when I tried to update within Windows it said it was not compatible? </s>
<s> Hopefully that's a little more clear. </s>
<s> Still a very new trick. </s>
<s> I expect it to not always work. </s>
<s> Hope that's clearer. </s>

<s> floppy disk but when I ran the program ...the file was too large for a for a floppy disk. </s>
<s> So I decided to try the @BIOS update program running under Windows. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
