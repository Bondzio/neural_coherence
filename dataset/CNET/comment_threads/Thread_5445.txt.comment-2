I fixed one like that last month.
The owner didn't take the free advice to put two more drops of heatsink compound on the CPU.
They gave up and I did it for the 50 buck minimum charge.
They were not happy.
I'm unsure why some don't try the easy stuff first.
There is also an issue with memory, bios, timings and more but I will not write more than that here.
It's far too deep and in short a warranty+support problem.
