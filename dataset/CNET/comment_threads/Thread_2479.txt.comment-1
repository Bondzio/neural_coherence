HI Currently i am using the Lacie 2 Big Qudra 1 TB Actually it holds 2 Hard drives of 500 gb each My Question: Is it possible to upgrade and replace the hard drives to an 2 TB each so i will have 4 TB total.
I notided that lacie have the same model with 4 TB hard drives.
I askd lacie support and got the answer that it might not work as the computer wont recognise the drives.
Cant understand why ?
