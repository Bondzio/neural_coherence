Sometimes, its harder to move the user's thinking and/or habits for best results.
This is an good example, if the user can access some other area or a more controlled enviroment the problem will persist.
The only solution I can think of and it must be a controlled one, is a heated table or surface.
This will dehumind the immediate area and any intake huminity actually helps cool the system/laptop.
When I say heated only slightly like a warmed sunlit exposed table, maybe 10-15deg.
above.
The system/laptop should still have its own acceptable cooling working 100% with any help like bigger fans, etc.. tada -----Willy
