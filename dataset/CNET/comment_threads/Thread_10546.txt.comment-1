I have a idotconnect metal gear box 3.5&quot; Hard drive.
The box reads 3.5&quot; IDE TO USB 2.0/1394A I lost the power adapter for this hard drive and ALL my stuff is on it.. it's 6-PIN and it says &quot;DC IN&quot; where it plugs in to the Hard Drive.
I've been googling this company, the product, the adapter..
I cant find anything with this PIN layout.. is this a typo??
I found something similar, with the 5V and the GND Reversed.. SEE PIC BELOW http://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i440/grimlocksmom/Photoon2011-04-06at23542.jpg
