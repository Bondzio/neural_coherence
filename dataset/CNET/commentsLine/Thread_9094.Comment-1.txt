i'm having an issue with my network adapter.
my daughter was surfing the web when she says the internet stopped.
i looked and the network adapter is not picking up the network from a router two feet away.
the wireless network is working fine - i can connect with the other three devices in the house.
but this cpu will not recognize the network.
i have updated the device drivers for the adapter and run a basic windows diagnosis - it says the drivers are up to date and the device is operating properly.
i have also run anti-virus software just in case she picked up something while browsing.
what am i missing?
