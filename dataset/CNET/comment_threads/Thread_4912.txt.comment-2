http://support.asus.com/download/download_item.aspx?product=1&model=P5P800-VM The manual notes it has the AGP 8x slot.
I would chose any AGP card from this link -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/12/03/best_graphics_card/ &quot;With the 7600 GS at $100, it's a little too close to the much better performing 2600 XT, so we're dropping that card in favor of the extremely cheap Radeon X1650 PRO.
Yes, it's a DDR2 card, but it's only $65, and would make a decent upgrade for an AGP system&quot; The only other item I'd check is the power supply rating.
I'd like to see it north of 400 Watts.
