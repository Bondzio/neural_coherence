Be honest to yourself.
If you find little or no info on a company you plan to do business with, then move on.
Don't fill-in required knowledge with hard luck stories.
Plainly put, try someone else with better reviews or at least more of them and take it from there.
While, I can't tell why you didn't much on Iron Computers, it maybe because: 1) new company 2) co. name change 3) they started selling on WWW 4) shell co. for some big name that not all good 5) legal requiremanets of some kind But, if uyou have to guess or need to find out, then why brother.
More than likely someone else sells the same items or PC build for similar costs or close to it.
You may want to checkout &quot;white box or bare-bones PC&quot; which is another term for a vendor built PC that includes only the case and installed innards from your build or what they offer as PC#1, PC#2, etc., but nothing else.
You may to supply everything else or add more to order list.
Larger online vendors offer such, like NewEgg, TigerDirect and ZoomZipFly, etc.. tada -----Willy
