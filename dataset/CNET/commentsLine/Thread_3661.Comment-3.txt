unfortunely, a weak p/s unit causes all havoc and just makes the system flaky in general.
p/s problem can effect all aspects of the system, so you really can't trust anything.
thus, the quickest fix is to replace/swap.
but, you mentioned your heat is hot, that alone can effect the p/s worthiness as it starts to falter under such conditions.
leave the side cover off the system and it seems to settle down, you truly got a &quot;heat problem&quot;.
further, you can place a household fan to better cool the innards and it really settles down, you found a heat problem.
that being the case, damage maybe already done and replacement may still be called for on the p/s or any other fan(s), plusa they have to sucking in air and exhausting it as well at a rate capable of cooling the system.
air circualation is must to better help air flow through out the system case.
a good p/s unit should be 400w+ or better and be a quality build unit as well, so pick a namebrand if that what it comes down to.
hope this helps... enjoy -----willy
