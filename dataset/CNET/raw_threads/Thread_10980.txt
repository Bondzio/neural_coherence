I had the same error on my Dell Optiplex 240, 1.5mhz, 256MB, 80gig, win2000 pro system, when I tried to install the pinnacle studio av/dv card on my system. I talked with dell support as well as pinnacle support, basically had already tried what they told me to try, different PCI slots and taking all cards out that I could except that one and configuration setup to no avail. Ended up taking it back to Best Buy for a refund! So much for those tech support people reading it from a manual. They were no help. I'am finding out that here on Cnet and myself are the best tech support.
