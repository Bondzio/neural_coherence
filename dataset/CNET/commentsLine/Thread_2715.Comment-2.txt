what you haven't told is if the bios is current as well as you finding drivers for motherboard, video and what else is in the machine.
some install xp and thought that microsoft would install latest drivers or with a click of that button &quot;driver update&quot; would get the latest.
that is a demo.
nothing more.
in closing, a fresh install of xp finds the user fighting off the ms blaster or other worms since said os is wide open to attacks within a few seconds of connection to the internet.
an antivirus doesn't help here.
after the sp1 install, drivers and more, then i usually finish with a clean pass from adaware, spybot, cwshredder and housecall.
the xbox doesn't need that... bob
