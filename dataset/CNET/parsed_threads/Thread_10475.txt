<s> Trouble with DVD Drive: it shows the drive but does not acknowledge the presence of a disc in drive. </s>
<s> I've tried various things and now I seem to need a new nudge from some enlighten mind regarding what else is there to do. </s>
<s> My DVD Drive is from a really exotic and elusive, as it turns out, manufacturer: AGI Technologies, where apparently one of their bloody technologies is disappearence.The thing is called ATAPI DVD STAR2000.Curiously- it plays any kind of a CD/R but no DVDs....My OS is Win98.I have plenty of Memory and Direct X #9.In Device Manager under CD ROM Controllers I have only one driver, one for Drive D, where I have CD/R/RW but nothing that would govern the DVD Drive because there is nothing I can find for it and when I got it it came naked without any instr. </s>
<s> or software. </s>
<s> It may be it doesn't need one, but than- what does it need to play properly? </s>
<s> Help,enlighten, lead out of darkness, please! </s>
<s> If I find a DVD drive that shows a drive letter, but can't read any disks, then I save people time and money by trying a known working drive. </s>
<s> Try a known working drive. </s>
<s> Oh! </s>
<s> You want to test this drive? </s>
<s> Here's the test. </s>
<s> Try to boot from said drive. </s>
<s> If it can't boot a CD, then it's 99.99% likely to be dead. </s>

<s> Dear Mr. Bob, What does it mean &quot;to boot from a drive?&quot; </s>
<s> http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ If you can't make one, have a friend do this for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you most kindly. </s>
<s> I am downloading the Basic CD Bootable for Windows.Meanwhile I hope it will not require to communicate with my system in DOS: there is always something that stomps me whenever I tried to get into diagnostics.I am at moments of exasperation ready to do what you suggested- to buy a next DVD Drive, but then, I had so little use of this one and in the past it worked . </s>
<s> It even worked yesterday, before I tried to improve everything with the newest Direct X and some free diagnostic tools. </s>
<s> I will put up another fight before I will collect my body from the ground and shamble to Best Buys to get another suspect DVD Drive... </s>
<s> It's not so much you need to use the utilities on it, its for the bootable feature so you can see if that DVD drive can boot from it. </s>
<s> I use such all the time to tell if the drive has failed. </s>
<s> Then I put in a good drive and a test boot tells if it works. </s>
<s> Some want a &quot;test&quot; so this is the one I find to be easy without touching the OS on the hard disk. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Question: my system is apparently aware of the Drive E, where I have the DVD Drive and it even works, as a CDRom device: what it does not want to do is to what it ostensibly suppose to be-namely a DVD Drive!Is that a problem solvable among the BIOS? </s>
<s> Is it something within CD ROM Controllers or ,perhaps in Hard Disk Controllers, with all those Primery and Secondary stuff? </s>
<s> Forgive me if I sound idiotic, but it is not ,obviously a familiar ground to my mind. </s>
<s> Is that some program you installed? </s>
<s> I've seen many ZOMBIE DVD drives. </s>
<s> Ones that don't see DVD and others that see DVD, but not CDROM. </s>
<s> You can find these posts here. </s>
<s> If it shows a drive letter and works with CD, then the cable, master, slave and IDE is likely just fine. </s>
<s> Many owners grasp for hope the drive can be saved... </s>
<s> In closing, you can try uninstalling then installing your DVD software player. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've re-read the dialogue and it's unclear if it really is connected to the machine. </s>
<s> You do need to power down, pull the case cover and make sure the IDE cables are seated into the units. </s>
<s> Also, that the BIOS SCREEN shows the drives. </s>
<s> Some do, some don't. </s>
<s> If the drive has died, can't boot, etc, you may want to consider a DVD recorder. </s>
<s> Not much more than what you paid for a DVD drive? </s>
<s> http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=DD0405-N&cat=DVD In closing, did this unit ever work? </s>
<s> I didn't read if it did. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, it worked first time when I bought it, about 2 years ago. </s>
<s> Then I took it out and now reinstalled it and it worked yesterday for a while and I went to bed feeling good. </s>
<s> Today is functioning only with CDs, no DVD is recognised as present there. </s>

<s> I want to do that, but I am still downloading Ultimate BOOT and it takes forever to download 68 MB on dial-up. </s>
<s> Sometime tonight I will try my luck with reinstalling WinDVD 6 tial version.I looked up Microsoft System Information utility and under Components, in Storage it lists Hard Drive, Floppy and both CDRom and my unhappy DVD Drive as well. </s>
<s> http://www.geexbox.org/en/index.html It's a little smaller... And what I use to play DVDs sometimes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I want to add my gratitude for your patient and sagacious advice. </s>
<s> I have to confess that at the end I am returning to your original advice:get a spank new DVD Drive! </s>
<s> Once I saw how inexpesive they become since I bought mine I feel I can buy one every month and chuck them out like a used lollypops.Thank you again,with my best,Henryk. </s>
