1.1.1	Here 's the dilemma .	St
1.1.2	I 've got a 3Com 10 port managed POE switch were using to connect to wireless APs in a school I give some volunteer support to .	St
1.1.3	We 've 8 ports in use with APs and one is used to link with the router .	St
1.1.4	We have a potential need to add 2 more APs but , with 9 in use , we 're one port short .	St
1.1.5	I have POE injectors but would prefer to connect to this switch because we turn it on and off separately from the other network devices .	St
1.1.6	This POE switch has an SFP port .	St
1.1.7	BTW , the model # is 3CDSG10PWR-US .	St
1.1.8	Can I buy a module to fit this port that allow me to plug the Ethernet cable from the router into it and gain use of all 10 POE ports ?	Ques
1.1.9	These modules come in many forms and some are quite pricey .	St
1.1.10	The manual for the switch does n't get into this sort of detail .	St
1.1.11	I guess they expect folks who buy these to know how to use them .	St
1.1.12	TIA	St
1.2.1	Or they expect us to call the maker .	St
1.2.2	I know Cisco .	St
1.2.3	I know they have engineers and a better level of technicians standing by to answer technical questions .	St
1.2.4	Did you call and ask ?	Ques
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Cisco offices seem abundant here in New England .	St
1.4.2	They make a technical product and while I know a little about Cisco gear when it comes down to specific part numbers and does it work with this or that I always call them .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Had to check this worked the same as most other vendors .	St
1.5.2	Stupid forum will not cleanly let me post the specs on your switch so .	Sug
1.5.3	You only have 9 ports .	St
1.5.4	The last port is shared with the SFP module .	St
1.5.5	This is very common trick vendors do when counting ports .	St
1.5.6	The 10th port can either be the built in port or the SFP .	St
1.5.7	Both are not active .	St
1.5.8	In your case the last port is not even POE so should put your router in port 10 In general I do not think I have seen a SFP that can do PoE itself .	Sug
1.5.9	They can do copper 10/100/1000 but not the PoE .	St
1.5.10	Many times in switches like this they do not support the copper SFP module since its silly to do it since the built in port is already 10/100/1000 copper .	St
1.5.11	I think you are out of luck you are going to have to daisy chain another switch to make this work .	St
1.6.1	10 seemed like a strange number ... some sort of 4-4-2 arrangement .	St
1.6.2	We also have a 50 port switch .	St
1.6.3	40 are standard 10/100 , and 2 are 10/100/1000 .	St
1.6.4	It also has an SFP port that , I believe , is shared with one of the gigabit ports .	St
1.6.5	I 'll re-read the spec sheet on the POE switch .	St
1.6.6	We originally only expected to need 4 or 5 APs so bought a smaller switch .	St
1.6.7	That became 8 APs very quickly do to some amateur miscalculations on my part .	St
1.6.8	Hey , I 'm just a guy off the street and not an IT wizard .	St
1.6.9	We 'd now like to add more coverage .	St
1.6.10	We use the management capabilities minimally ... mainly to enable/disable ports as needed .	St
1.6.11	You can also enable/disable power to any port .	St
1.6.12	I enabled 1-8 so can easily check to see if I can get power to the other 2 .	St
1.6.13	Otherwise , the APs we bought came with injectors and we can use those as needed .	St
1.6.14	You just lose some remote management ability though but that 's not critical .	St
1.6.15	Thanks for pointing that out .	St
1.6.16	I 'll check to see if you 're correct that only 9 ports will available for POE .	St
1.7.1	This is the switch http : //www.3cbsi.com/other/pdfs/products/en_US/3com_401049.pdf 3Com does list accessories for its products .	St
1.7.2	I should be able to find what I need from them .	St
1.7.3	The SFP port shows as dual purpose ... copper or fiber .	St
1.7.4	I need copper and it should work as desired if I just find the right module .	St
1.7.5	Thanks again .	St
1.8.1	Says it 's dual purposed with one of the 10/100/1000 ports .	St
1.8.2	It does n't say shared or which port but I remember that trick with 5 port hubs .	St
1.8.3	The 5th was just an extension of # 4 to be used as an uplink without needing a crossover cable .	St
1.8.4	I suppose that all I need to do is enable the SFP and see if another port gets lost .	St
1.8.5	So much for that idea .	St
1.9.1	The 3com one is sure confusing .	St
1.9.2	This is a link that has the tech specs I was looking at .	St
1.9.3	All the sites that sell these seem to have a similar listing .	St
1.9.4	http : //www.buy.com/prod/3com-officeconnect-managed-gigabit-ethernet-switch-with-poe-9-x-10-100/q/loc/101/204860509.html The SFP you would need is 3CSP93 The 2 sfp the have listed are mm and single mode fiber .	St
1.9.5	I suspect since it is not listed it will not take the 93 .	St
1.10.1	It shows the SFP 91 and 92 as options .	St
1.10.2	These are n't dirt cheap and I do n't see what would be the purpose of having 10 POE ports when one obviously has a need for some sort of uplink that wo n't need power .	St
1.10.3	The only SFP connector we have now links the fiber optic broadband system to the LAN and that part is owned by Time Warner .	St
1.10.4	I can see using these for fiber or longer distances than Ethernet but all I 'd want is to use it to uplink to the router to gain one more port .	St
1.10.5	That does n't , at this point , look to be an economical solution .	St
1.10.6	This is only a small K-8 school .	St
1.10.7	We installed wireless for the laptop/netbook use in the upper grade classrooms , library , and common areas .	St
1.10.8	It 's been working wonderfully for that purpose and do n't want to make trouble .	St
1.10.9	I doubt this is a good idea now but was worth a shot .	Polite
1.10.10	Thanks again	St
1.11.1	Whether I could find a copper SFP module or not is n't going to matter .	St
1.11.2	Port # 10 is shared as earlier noted .	St
1.11.3	Thanks for the response .	St
1.11.4	Nothing learned is ever wasted .	St
