1.1.1	I was never interested in going wireless until I saw my bro ' in laws access point linked to his cable modem , and was surprised at the speed using 802.11b .	St
1.1.2	He does n't have a network , as I do , which is hardwired .	St
1.1.3	Here 's the question : Can I link a wireless router to my existing router and still be networked ?	Ques
1.1.4	Or will this only enable me to surf the net ?	Ques
1.1.5	I was looking for a cheap , access point kinda setup , but all I can find on the net are wireless routers ( well , on newegg and tigerdirect . )	St
1.1.6	This is mainly for my laptop , and possibly later for my daughter 's machine .	St
1.1.7	I 'll keep my system hardwired .	St
1.1.8	So , is this doable ?	Ques
1.1.9	If you 're interested , here 's a link to the wireless router , which is a Netgear ; I helped my br ' in law reinstall windows , and was surprised how quickly setting it up was , but again , he does n't have a network , and only uses an access point ( if that 's the proper term for the thing that 's allow wireless , but not being a router . )	St
1.1.10	http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=458470 & CatId=373 Oh , I also intend to use a usb adapter for the laptop/my daughters system ; same as my 'bro in law .	St
1.1.11	TIA .	St
1.2.1	This wireless router has a 4 port switch , so I can just replace my existing router , and have both ethernet and wireless .	St
1.3.1	I forgot .	St
1.3.2	On the back of my existing router , I have a printer port for pinr sharing over my network .	St
1.3.3	So I 'm back to square 1 , as to my question .	St
1.3.4	Can I link the Netgear router to my existing one ?	Ques
1.4.1	Specifically a WAP11 , but you may want a G rated WAP .	St
1.4.2	No need to change the router , just add the WAP .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	That was my original thought before I posted .	St
1.5.2	But I could only find routers on the net .	St
1.5.3	Maybe I 'll look locally ; I 'm settling on Netgear , cuz that 's what my bro ' in law uses , and setup was so quick , and he said their tech support was really good .	St
1.5.4	Will let you know how it goes .	St
1.5.5	Thanks for input .	St
1.5.6	btw , the new look in here is pretty cool .	Polite
1.6.1	The unit needed a firmware update before it would play with the wifi cards .	St
1.6.2	With consumer goods , they should n't be doing this .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	... MR814 ( b ) .	St
1.7.2	As I said in a post above , surfing was fine , but accessing my network was just too slow .	St
1.7.3	Think I 'll look online for an 80.11g WAP just for surfing purposes on my laptop .	St
1.7.4	In the meantime , I 'll stay hard-wired , and drag the 50 foot cat line from living room to bedroom , lol .	St
1.7.5	Thanks for input .	St
1.8.1	I linked the wireless Netgear router from my ethernet router by linking from ethernet to the WAN port in the wireless , thereby creating an access point that allows me to connect to the net , but I ca n't browse my network .	St
1.8.2	My network populates , but I 'm denied access to any other computer except the computer that has the wireless adapter .	St
1.8.3	I was able to even send a print job .	St
1.8.4	What I do n't understand is , why ca n't I link lan to lan ports ( with the idea of being able to browse my network ) .	St
1.8.5	When I link lan to lan ports , I get neither net access or ability to browse network .	St
1.8.6	Any ideas ? I 'm thinking there must be some kind of advanced settings or something , or 1 or both of the routers is somehow firewalling .	St
1.8.7	If I could get my network to populate , I 'd trade in this 802.11b router for a 802.11g , but I do n't think it 's worth it just to access the net which is fine using the & quot ; b & quot ; .	St
1.8.8	Just a side question regarding speed : when something is rated at 11Mbs , that 's 11 million bits , correct ?	Ques
1.8.9	There 's 8 bits to a byte , 1024 bytes to a meg , so 11 million divided by 8 , divided by 1024 , gives about 1.34 megs/sec .	St
1.8.10	Am I correct in my thinking ?	Ques
1.8.11	I 've googled this , and I get & quot ; it depends & quot ; kinda answers- depends on binary or some other standard ; forget which .	St
1.8.12	TIA .	St
1.9.1	Remember that you do n't get all those bits for your data payload .	St
1.9.2	Some are used up in preamble , postamble and checksums of the data packet .	St
1.9.3	While 11 megabits may arrive at your PC , only 1/2 of that may be your data , the rest for bits before , after and about the data you needed to move .	St
1.9.4	This is why it depends .	St
1.9.5	As to your network , that issue is fairly well understood .	St
1.9.6	But your network looks too complex for me to offer any support .	St
1.9.7	It 's bad enough with Cable/DSL to router , but it looks like you have two routers .	St
1.9.8	Such a setup is for experts to own and love .	St
1.9.9	Bob	St
