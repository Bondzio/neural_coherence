<s> Kids shot the screen wit a BB gun (:-( and damaged it. </s>
<s> Where can I procure the screen component for replacement. </s>
<s> I am an electronic tech of 30 years but I do not know of a source for this. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thank you, Mike Crosby </s>
<s> Somewhere in that huge company they must have spares and a distribution mechanism for them. </s>
<s> But it seems very well possible to me that the price of a spare screen for a unit that was sold from 2004 is much more than the current price of a comparable unit. </s>
<s> Better check before you order. </s>

<s> You may be right, but it is worth a shot. </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike </s>
<s> Depending on how old the LCD is, finding spares is out there in the &quot;used/spares&quot; vendors market. </s>
<s> Google for model# and see if so-so has anything and of course the full cost. </s>
<s> If the LCD is real old and/or at least 3yrs. </s>
<s> old, I would consider it a lost unless you really got to have it. </s>
<s> In most cases a LCD subassy. </s>
<s> (alone) or if used, maybe the whole assy. </s>
<s> the cost varies. </s>
<s> Buying a new 19in. </s>
<s> LCD, especially now during this Xmas time, there has to be a decent deal out there, well worth the checking out. </s>
<s> Of course, there is eBay too just find a F1903 out there. </s>
<s> BTW, the HP F1503 and F1903 were part of a bad series of LCDs that had poor componets used and caused failure. </s>
<s> So, the parts got used/repaired often and/or these bad LCDs were sold, so verify it is a working model component/LCD. </s>
