nVidia has a 6 month project refresh cycle.
They just refreshed their line, so the next big thing won't be out until the fall.
The 6800gs will probably fall to $120 by then and the 7800gs should be about $200.
The following refresh (about the same time as Windows Vista is debuting) should make the 6800gs (or similar) an entry-level card and the 7800 should reach your target price.
However, by then PCI express may be so dominant that AGP becomes a niche market and niche product prices don't fall as quickly as mainstream products.
That's why the 7800gs with 16 pipes is more expensive than the faster 7800gt with 20 pipes.
Ditto with x800xt AGPs selling for $280 while x850xt's are only $170.
