The latest Intel.com driver is at http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/CS-009236.htm I see item 2 at http://downloadcenter.intel.com/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=816&OSFullName=Windows*+XP+Home+Edition&lang=eng&strOSs=45&submit=Go%21 writes &quot;This utility installs INF files that inform the operating system how to properly configure the chipset for specific functionality such as USB and AGP.&quot; Good luck.
