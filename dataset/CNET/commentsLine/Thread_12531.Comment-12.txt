did you format using the included software/setup assistant?
i did (w/usb connection).
but then i re-did formatting native, but it still didn't help.
most likely you have the same motherboard as i did.
the sad part is that you may have to go through the hoops with support until they are convinced any software or bios settings were tried.
and they do suggest some pretty crazy things that i knew wouldn't make a difference, but if you don't &quot;cooperate&quot;, you lose.
if you do get a new mobo, there is some fallout that i found out.
itunes licenses get broken.
my system tray was messed up.
i got a new msn startup service to track to down and shut off.
my desktop wallpaper was screwed up.
but worst of all my windows o/s got de-activated!!!
i think the latter was because i upgraded to ultimate on top of the pre-installed home premium.
i think if o/s remains the same, it is okay.
or at least easier to re-activate.
