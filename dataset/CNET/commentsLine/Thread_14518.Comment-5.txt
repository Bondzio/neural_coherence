electricity, in whatever form does &quot;mysterious&quot; things.
basically, since you saw the &quot;blue arc&quot; that was roughly 40-50k volts jumping around.
you have seen the after effects, so it does make sense to lessen its build-up.
use &quot;fabric softner&quot; (50/50 softener/water)or made for sprays around the carpet and mats.
ground the keybd.
and/or add a static pad to touch before using anything.
check your home heating/cooling to increase humidity levels to proper acceptance.
as for correcting the system, you may have damaged not the cpu but other componets of the mtrbd.
which will hamper the system booting.
in either way, the damage is hard to pinpoint as it can be anything.
thus, either have a good tech look at it or bite the bullet and start lookng for a new system.
if you have warranty, use it, but no mention of static damage.
good luck -----willy
