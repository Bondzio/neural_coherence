14200	0	315929	2904985	NR	jerrywh1	11/11/08 3:09 PM	1.22641614E12	Video Card Upgrade	My M/B is a ASUS P5LD2-VM, the chipset is Intel 82945G, the cpu is dual core and runs at 26.6 GHZ, and I have 4 Gigs of RAM. I want to install a 3D Video Card to improve the display. Presently I'm using the onboard video. I need a suggestion for buying a compatable video card, that will give me the best performance for the price. Any other suggestions are welcomed. I would like to stay under $250.

You need to be a little more precise about the circumstances under which you want to 'improve the display'. Do you mean for general use, for games, for CAD/CAM, etc., ?? VAPCMD

Presently the only thing I'm thinking about is using 3D with Google Earth. I also have &quot;MS Flight Simulator X&quot; and the &quot;LS99 golf&quot; game. I just increased my RAM from 1 to 4 gigs, but I haven't noticed much improvement in the performance of the computer. I suspect that I'm not running anything that requires that much RAM. My fear is that I'll spend a lot of money on a card that may not be compatabile to my system, or may not be any better than what I now have. Thanks in advance for the help.

I wasn't going to go into the store and just pick up one, and the advice of the so called tech people in the stores near is horrible. I installed a GeForce 9400 GT 1 GB DDR2. It was reletively inexpensive (about $75 w/tax). On Google Earth ad the Flight Simulator the performace was much better. I haven't tried the golf game yet, but I'm well pleased. I was ready to pay much more. Thanks Agian, Jerry
