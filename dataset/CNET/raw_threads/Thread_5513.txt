But when connected to a friend's Dell Inspiron laptop with Win XP Pro, the option to connect is greyed out. http://www.geocities.com/erickarn/LinksysGreyedOut.JPG My router is the the 'K' one, the unsecured linksys router also shows the same thing. There is an &quot;Odyssey Network Agent&quot; installed (without my friend's knowledge, don't ask :-)) that has &quot;Uninstall&quot; greyed out even with the admin login. No &quot;Odyssey&quot; shows up in Add/Remove. No useful Google search on Odyssey yet. http://www.geocities.com/erickarn/LinksysOdyssey.JPG If Odyssey is the problem, how do I get rid of it without a System Restore? Thanx.

Sorry. Bob
