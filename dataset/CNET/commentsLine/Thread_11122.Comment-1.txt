i recently replaced my psu and graphics card in my computer.
everything was fine until the monitor started to act strange.
i would turn on my computer and i could hear it was loading windows but the monitor will not display anything.
sometimes i am able to turn of the computer and then turn it back on and it works, but now it doesnt seem to want to do anything (even though i was using it fine and hour or so before).
is this problem being cause by my new graphics card or psu r is it another issue?
thanks for any help.
