This happened before but somehow it actually fixed itself, (how?
i dont know) but now its actually lasting longer than it previously has.
OK, so i turn on my computer and everthing looks as though its going smoothly, then while it is 'Detecting IDE Drives' it takes a little longer than it usually does, then after that, this comes up: 'Primary Master: None Primary Slave: None Secondary Master: Toshiba DVD ROM SD-M1502 1008 Secondary Slave: _NEC NR-7700A' Then it pops up saying 'Verifying DMI Pool Data....Update Success Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM: Failure...
Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM: Failure...
Disk Boot Failure, Insert System Disc...' Recently I installed windows XP, though im pretty sure this has nothing to do with the problem, any info you need i dont mind on telling you.
Any help would be appreciated.
