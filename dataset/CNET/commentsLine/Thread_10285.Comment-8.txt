i did read your posts and shared what we ended up with.
-&gt; today's software offerings seem to never be bug free.
do demand it but you are on windows and there is a deep issue there that i work with all the time.
i didn't reveal this but i write software.
on embedded machines, palmos, windows mobile, windows, dos and more.
let's get away form that for a moment and look at the other old solution.
hylafax.
google that and you find the most common industrial solution with clients on windows for looking at and retrieving the faxes.
sad to write this but the bug in the software you noted is wide spread.
&quot;bug free&quot; is not something i find today.
