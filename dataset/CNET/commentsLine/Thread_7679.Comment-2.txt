this is where one creates a business plan with projections and more.
if they don't do this, then they shouldn't venture into this space.
there are also some that won't put in the needed 18+ hours a day to launch their new business or will not have the capital to run for a few years without a profit.
no business plan = no business.
hope this explains it.
