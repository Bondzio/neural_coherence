i had a similar problem when transferring large files, but i would lose all connectivity and the router would reset itself.
i tried every possible solution before giving up and buying a different make/model router.
i haven't had a problem since then.
does the router have the latest firmware installed?
have you tried a factory reset?
do you have the same problem when both computers are wired to the router?
