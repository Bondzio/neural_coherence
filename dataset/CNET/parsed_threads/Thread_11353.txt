<s> We have a small download limit every month and keep ramming into only days into our billing period. </s>
<s> I am trying to identify the culprit but need to find a way to log the traffic of individual IP address (which are all static) on the network to figure out where all the bandwidth is going. </s>
<s> Does anyone now a (preferably free) application that will allow me to monitor this? </s>
<s> Network Infrastructure: Modem connected to NetGear N2000 (older model) Router 192.168.0.1 Family Desktop - 0.2 (Ethernet) My Desktop - 0.3 (Powerline Ethernet) Brothers Laptop - 0.5 (Wireless) My PS3 - .0.30 (Wireless) iPods - (Wireless) Router only tells me when someone is on and can track total network traffic usage not individual hardware. </s>
<s> Any help will be MUCH appreciated. </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/7723-12549_102-528957.html?messageId=5143905#message5143905 where the OP mentioned a program networkx to install on the PC to measure it. </s>
<s> http://www.softperfect.com/products/networx/ seems useful for you indeed. </s>

<s> There are many tools like the one mentioned above but it must run on each PC. </s>
<s> What you need is a device that can monitor all the PC. </s>
<s> The only common point you have is the router or the connection to the ISP. </s>
<s> You could buy what is called a tap and place it on the cable between the ISP and the router. </s>
<s> You would then run wireshark and capture the traffic. </s>
<s> Wireshark has good reporting but can be tricky since it has many option. </s>
<s> Although simple to setup it is not a cheap way to do this. </s>
<s> The method I would recommend even though it too is not free. </s>
<s> Replace your router with a router that can run the open firmware called dd-wrt, mostly linksys. </s>
<s> Then run the tool called rflow collector. </s>
<s> This is very similar to a feature called netflow used in commercial routers. </s>
<s> There are good instructions on how to set this up but it is still fairly complex. </s>
<s> It is fairly easy to get instantaneous data and some router/firewall will display open sessions to get historic type data you need to store the information and routers cannot do that. </s>
