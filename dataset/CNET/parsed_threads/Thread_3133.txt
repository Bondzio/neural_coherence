<s> FSB :- Front Side BUS But as the person who posted before me said, do a search on google for more info then you will understand what it is mate..... </s>
<s> I like this explanation: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/motherboard4.htm </s>
<s> The problem with looking up acronyms on Google is sometimes the results are WAAY on the bottom. </s>
<s> For me it was #8 or so. </s>
<s> Anyways, FSB is how fast data is carried to/from CPU to system RAM. </s>
<s> Among one uses, I hear faster FSB speeds is better if you do alot of video editting and video related stuff. </s>
<s> IIRC, the FSB has to be a multiple of the system RAM speed. </s>
