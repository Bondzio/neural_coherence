sorry i didn't mention that stuff.
i have an ibook g4 running osx 10.4.9 commercial dvds do not show up on the desk top, and they will not play in apple dvd player.
however, using the same optical drive, i can play the movie in vlc player.
when i open toast 8, and select copy disc, it says &quot;copy summary: &lt;no volume&gt;&quot; and then has the size of the dvd under it.
this one being &quot;7.46 gb&quot; when i went into disc utility and click on that drive, repairing disc permissions is grayed out.
should i try with a data dvd?
this on is a commerial dvd.
