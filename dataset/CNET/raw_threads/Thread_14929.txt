I try turning on the computer with another PSU that i had but still nothing. Anyone has any idea what is wrong or what i can do?

The power on button (did you test that button) the wires to the motherboard then the motherboard tell the PSU to power up. There are just a few parts that involve the PSU powering up. Since the CMOS battery was removed and replaced and the failure followed that, this is why I noted that. As to the new battery, what Voltage is the Volt meter reading on that battery? We want just over 3 Volts. Sadly if that's good and typing THE DEAD PC at google finds nothing you can use then the motherboard id dead. If any other cables were unplugged I was not told about that so I have no reason to tell you to test without the IDE cables plugged into the main board. Bob
