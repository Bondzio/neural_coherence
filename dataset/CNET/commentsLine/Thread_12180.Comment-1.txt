i have a dell dimension v350 (win95) that is run occasionally and complained about lost date and time settings - so i replaced the cmos battery.
now it won't boot on power up fans and hd starts spinning and display lits up saying: phoenixbios 4.0 release 6.0 copyright 1985-1998 phoenix technologies ltd. all rights reserved copyright 1985-1998 intel corporation.
4a4rb0x0.10a.0018.p06 dell dimension v350 bios version a05 pentium ii processor 350 mhz 64 mb system ram press &lt;del&gt; to enter setup then nothing happens and it doesn't respond to &lt;del&gt;.
&lt;ctrl-alt-del&gt; restarts the process but it ends up in the same spot.
if i hit &lt;del&gt; while it is counting memory up to 64 mb it instead ends up with entering setup ... on the bottom of the screen and nothing happens.
only response i get is a beep when hitting &lt;any key&gt; after that i have hit it several times before.
i'm a little puzzled over that it only counts up to 64 mb as it is equipped with two memory chips labelled &quot;pc100-322-620&quot; which i belive are of 128 mb each.
removing one or the other of them stops the counting at 32 mb.
i'd be much obliged for any help on this, ct
