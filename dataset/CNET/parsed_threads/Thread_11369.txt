<s> I have 2 desktops connected to one server. </s>
<s> All machines are running XP Home Service Pack 3 and we install all relevsnt windows updates. </s>
<s> We are using a Netgear E104 Hub. </s>
<s> The data in the server is shared. </s>
<s> Each PC has direct access to the internet.We are hard wired via an ethernet cable. </s>
<s> One PC regularly loses connection to the server for up to 2 minutes while the other continues to stay connected. </s>
<s> Wondering whether I had a faulty network card or cable I installed a USB wirelees device which successfully connected to the server. </s>
<s> But then it also lost connection for a while. </s>
<s> I tried to run the repair function for the ethernet connection but it failed to clear the ARP cache. </s>
<s> I apologise if I have not provided sufficient information, but any asistance would be gratefully appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> I read very little about the server. </s>
<s> XP Home while it can share directory is not a server OS. </s>
<s> That is, you shouldn't lean on it too hard. </s>
<s> Thanks, I'll try and be gentle but at times I do want to scream !! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> With your reply I am left to guess you are using XP Home as a server. </s>
<s> Now there are now many connections allowed in XP Home so you run out of road very quickly. </s>
<s> What else is installed like some firewall, Torrent program? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> We are running AVG Internet security on all 3 machines </s>
<s> The issue can be the firewall. </s>
<s> Since it is all too likely your machines are behind a hardware firewall or router, turn the firewall off and re-test. </s>
<s> Is the server actually a server like the Windows Home Server or the Windows Server 2003 or 2008? </s>
<s> Are you simply using an XP Home edition to share it's folder to the other two computers. </s>
<s> Are all these devices connected to a router or just the hub? </s>
<s> Where is your DHCP or are you using static numbers? </s>
<s> Need more info please. </s>
<s> How are the two computer connected to the internet? </s>
<s> Unless you are using static numbers, you should have a DHCP running someplace either with the router or your Windows Home Server. </s>
