but just because it has more doesn't mean it's better.
the memory interface is just as important if not more.
for example my system came with a 7300le turbocache card listed as 256mb.
it was configured to use 512mb.64bit memory interface.
most half decent cards now are true 256mb cards with a 128bit memory interface.
the higher-end cards are 256mb+ with 256bit+ memory interfaces.
