1.1.1	Are there any netbooks out there that can be viewed in direct sunlight ?	Ques
1.1.2	Almost nothing else ( memory , battery life , etc . )	St
1.1.3	is a concern .	St
1.1.4	Thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	While we know the Toughbooks ( see google ) have sunlight readable displays there is no market for the netbook version .	St
1.2.2	Or rather will the market be big enough to support the sunlight readable Toughbook and a netbook version ?	Ques
1.2.3	I 'm going with no .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well , I might defer to that touchscreen one from Acer .	St
1.3.2	T91 I think .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for your responce Bob .	Polite
1.4.1	Guess I 'm just spoiled from using my T400 outside .	St
1.4.2	I was hoping to find something in the netbook size/pricerange .	St
1.5.1	I 'm assuming you 're referring to glossy vs. matte displays ?	Ques
1.5.2	Most netbooks and consumer laptops have glossy displays , which are next to impossible to view outdoors .	St
1.5.3	There are a few netbooks that do have matte displays , however .	St
1.5.4	Namely the Samsung NC10 and the HP Mini 110 .	St
1.5.5	I have n't used either of them outdoors , though .	St
1.6.1	Thank you .	St
1.6.2	I am looking at the reviews now and may grab one of these models soon .	St
1.6.3	Both have reviews stating they are & quot ; suitible for outdoor use. & quot ; Thank you for the reply .	St
1.7.1	I am not the happy owner of an HP 110-1030NR .	St
1.7.2	Imagine my surprise when walking through the PX ( military everything-type store ) here in Afghanistan and seeing it on display right after these posts .	St
1.7.3	It came with an extended battery .	St
1.7.4	I 'm happy to have the extra battery life , but mixed on not being able to pack it without taking it off .	St
1.7.5	But if that 's the only downside , I 'm sitting pretty .	St
1.7.6	Thanks for all of the help .	St
1.7.7	Chad	St
1.8.1	not = now	St
1.9.1	Congratulations on your purchase .	St
1.9.2	The HP Mini 110 is much easier to find in retail outlets , so at least you can see what it 's like in person .	St
1.9.3	The Samsung NC10 is much more difficult to find in retail brick-and-mortar stores , so you 'd have to order one and have it shipped to you .	St
1.9.4	BTW a fair number of netbooks have six-cell batteries that stick out in a rather inelegant manner , e.g .	St
1.9.5	Dell , HP , Acer , and so forth .	St
1.9.6	Although the extended battery life makes up for it , and then some .	St
1.9.7	Be safe !	St
1.10.1	The battery on this on goes straight down , creating a ninety-degree angle .	St
1.10.2	It 's a little odd to hold , it can potentially be a handle .	St
1.10.3	But I hesitate to pack it without taking the batter off .	St
1.10.4	I 'll look into an extra smaller battery , that way I can pack it away , and have a few extra hours in the bag .	St
