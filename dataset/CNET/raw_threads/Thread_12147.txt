Pros for Shared Memory Graphics: - Less power required. - More time on battery (same size battery!) - Less heat. - Cheaper. Cons for same. - Gamers loathe such. - 3D performance pales to dedicated video memory and GPU. - Some CPU performance loss as video memory access causes the CPU to &quot;wait.&quot; - More money. Hope this helps. Bob
