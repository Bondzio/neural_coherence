I just have a quick question.
Does anyone know if these printers that say direct usb photo printing or pc-free photo printing will also print documents?
I've got no experience with this and can't confirm it either way.
I know the more expensive ones will print documents, but I am hoping to find a sub $200 multifunction printer that can print documents via a USB flash drive.
Thank you!
