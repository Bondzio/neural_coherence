<s> However the Cpu Charts at http://www.tomshardware.com/2004/12/20/the_mother_of_all_cpu_charts_part_1/ should help you sort out which is better. </s>

<s> There are lots of dual core CPUs with lower clock speeds that do far better on benchmarks you do realize right? </s>
<s> If you want to recycle the RAM from your existing computer you should specify what that is, IMO. </s>
<s> Lastly, you could go with some cheap Socket 939 AMD64 configuration but this will have limits on upgrading you know. </s>
