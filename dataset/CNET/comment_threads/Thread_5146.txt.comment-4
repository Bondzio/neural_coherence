Bob's answer is the most workable solution nowdays.
A DVD-Rom will play EITHER DVDs or CDs.
A DVD-RW will burn EITHER DVDs or CDS.
By the way, Bob, I have been happy with the BTC (badged as Emprex) 8x multi-format I got for $70 at Fry's.
Not the fastest out, but I'm not so busy I can't wait 20 more seconds.
I am curious why DVD media prices haven't really come down.
Unless I'm missing something, they cost the same(pennies) to manufacture as CDs.
