<s> This is pretty basic, but I can't figure it out. </s>
<s> I have a desktop and a laptop I use for school. </s>
<s> How can I setup my network such that I can share files between the desktop and laptop? </s>
<s> The desktop is a typical home desktop using a wireless card to access the wireless router and internet connection. </s>
<s> The laptop can and does access the same router, but is also configured to login to my network at school (wirelessly and hardwired). </s>
<s> Is there a way I can easily port files from the desktop to laptop and vice versa when I am at home? </s>
<s> is your workgroup names. </s>
<s> Since you are logging into a school network with one PC, it's likely those settings do not match the other. </s>
<s> Workgroup names need to be the same for one PC to see the other. </s>
<s> I have been able to access different PCs that belong to different networks, as long as you know how to get there. </s>
<s> All you have to do is go into My Network Places and click on either &quot;View Workgroup PCs&quot; or &quot;Entire Network&quot;. </s>
<s> With View Workgroup PCs option, just click on the &quot;up&quot; arrow and you'll see a list of networks, choose one and find the PC. </s>
<s> If you go w/ Entire Network, then Microsoft Windows Network and you'll have a list of networks. </s>
<s> The easiest way is to make them be on the same network, but the MOST important thing is that you have enabled file sharing. </s>
<s> If this isn't enabled...you won't see squat under the network name. </s>
<s> The first issue is that you didn't specify your Operating Systems...this is a very important part of the puzzle. </s>
<s> So what OSs do you have? </s>
<s> I have been able to access different PCs that belong to different networks, as long as you know how to get there. </s>
<s> All you have to do is go into My Network Places and click on either ''View Workgroup PCs'' or ''Entire Network''. </s>
<s> With View Workgroup PCs option, just click on the ''up'' arrow and you'll see a list of networks, choose one and find the PC. </s>
<s> If you go w/ Entire Network, then Microsoft Windows Network and you'll have a list of networks. </s>

<s> So what OSs do you have? </s>
<s> They both use XP. </s>
<s> I have a folder shared on the desktop (which is where all of the files I want to get to are). </s>
<s> I can't see it though on the laptop. </s>
<s> So you have a folder shared on the desktop of your desktop PC and your laptop can't see the folder that is shared on your desktop PC? </s>
<s> Are both PCs using Windows XP Pro? </s>
<s> First step I'd say is to make sure your PC (with the shared desktop folder) actually realizes its shared. </s>
<s> To do this, 1st make sure there is a lil hand under the folder, 2nd go to My Network Places and see if any shared folders appear in there. </s>
<s> If it's not in there...that's a problem of the file share settings. </s>
<s> If it is in there, it may be that you are on a different workgroup (have you tried browsing workgroups like I mentioned in ''actually''?). </s>
<s> To see if they are on the same workgroup, then right-clicking on My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Computer Name (Tab) should tell you the name, workgroup, and domain (if applicable). </s>
<s> Since you said you use this at school...you may be in a domain which may interfere with the home network (this is out of my league though if it involves a domain name). </s>
<s> If they are on different workgroups, you'll have to change the workgroup of one or go workgroup ''browsing'' to find the foldershare. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> &gt;&gt; So you have a folder shared on the desktop of your desktop PC and your laptop can't see the folder that is shared on your desktop PC? </s>
<s> Are both PCs using Windows XP Pro? </s>
<s> Yep they are both using Pro. </s>
<s> There is a folder shared on the desktop. </s>
<s> The laptop can't see it. </s>

<s> If it is in there, it may be that you are on a different workgroup (have you tried browsing workgroups like I mentioned in ''actually''?). </s>
<s> 1st - the little hand is there. </s>
<s> 2nd - it's in there like Prego. </s>
<s> I tried browsing for it from the laptop, and the only Windows network it &quot;sees&quot; is the one from school. </s>
<s> The desktop does have a different workgroup name. </s>
<s> The desktop has no domain. </s>
<s> The laptop does have a domain. </s>
<s> I just tried to modify the domain and change it to a workgroup (the same one the desktop is on). </s>
<s> Now I can't login to the laptop for whatever reason. </s>
<s> Guess I will be visiting computer services at school tomorrow. </s>
<s> I love Windows. </s>
<s> I shoulda mentioned not to mess w/ the domain name in my last post, I apologize for that. </s>
<s> Unfortuneatly I do not know how you can set this up having your laptop on a domain. </s>
<s> The IT people at your school may be able to tell you how to make the shared folder accessable to your laptop (most likely it is due to a setting on your laptop). </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
