Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 As it stands today there is no place to hide in &quot;no-security&quot; and WEP.
I've seen too many wifi setups failing and fixed too many with the move to WPA.
+ -&gt; Change the RF channel.
Try 1 then 5 or 6 then 11.
If need be, get wired.
The less wifi clients the better.
Also, don't expect the move to WPA to instantly knock the pest off your back.
I had one system that they attacker didn't give up for days.
Hope this helps, Bob
