The HP seems to have a better processor and much larger hard drive.
I plan on playing some games such as CoD4 and using Photoshop CS3.
I would also like to have the option to have the tv tuner thing which the hp has and the dell charges extra for.
Seem like a better buy with the HP but the dell may let me expand more down the road easily.
Any experience or ideas are appreciated?
