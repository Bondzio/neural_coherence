Just got a response back yesterday from the Vo-Tech center & they agree also the motherboard was indeed bad.
I had already suspected the mobo for being bad but thought it would be a good for the students to learn more about them.
I dought they could tell me whats up with the board & what componants are bad.
Capacitors I am told are the #1 componants that go out on mobo's.
I just wished I new what internal componants resistors,capacitors,relays,switches,regulators or what ever was was bad on it so I can learn to repair these boards.
Thats what my goal is.
To learn more about them & go into the business repairing them.
Did a search for motherboard repairs & comes up with companies that repair them.
