additional information - on the source inspiron laptop, which has windows/xp and has been around for awile, the external drive is recognized and the image was created.
on the target laptop, which had to have windows/xp reinstalled, the external drive with the image is not recognized in dos using ghost when trying to restore the image.
it appears that some configuration change that is in the source laptop is not in the target laptop.
ideas or suggested changes.
