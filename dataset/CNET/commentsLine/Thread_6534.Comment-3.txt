it has all the features your looking for except i don't know what kind of drawings you will be printing out but they should look good.
just make sure you use diffusion or the high quality print setting for drawings.
also run a automatic printhead alignment.
the text is near laser quality and graphics are very good and it also has a adf.
the adf seems to work the best out of all the ones i have had.
the photo quality is excellent.
officemax and newegg.com both sell them for around $200.
