1.1.1	If Cd's and DVD's have a shelf life, which appears to be the case, is it more secure to store data and photos on usb flash drive memory?	St
1.2.1	$9 for 8GB vs. 200GB?	St
1.2.2	no contest.	Res
1.3.1	My thought ..... USB flash drives are much less secure or reliable compared to CD or DVDs.	St
1.3.2	How permanent, secure or immune to failure do you think USB Flash Drives are ?	Ques
1.3.3	Are you asking about this in the context of primary storage ?	Ques
1.3.4	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Thanks for your thoughts.	St
1.4.2	Not primary storage at all.	St
1.4.3	Purely backup.	St
1.4.4	I had better stick to cd's and dvd's!	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Are you comparing the cost of a usb drive to buying dvd's?	St
1.6.2	But really do you want to back up 200gb of data onto 40 dvd's (at 4.7Gb per disk).	St
1.6.3	It takes about 15 minutes (on my dvd in a laptop, it is 5 years old).	St
1.6.4	So 15 x 40 = a lot of time vs. just drag and drop walk away and come back it is done.	St
1.6.5	- also you would need rewritable dvd's if you want to update the data.	St
1.6.6	- also how do you verify that the data is not lost through wear and tear, are you going to test 40 dvd's.	St
1.6.7	That sounds like a really bad idea It sounds a like a much better idea to have two external hard drives, you can buy a 1terabyte drive for about 120$, back up your data that way.	St
