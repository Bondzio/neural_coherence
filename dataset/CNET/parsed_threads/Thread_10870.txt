<s> Hi, I was thinking of buying a good mouse. </s>
<s> I would usually use it for portable use with macbook. </s>
<s> Any mouse is okay, as long as you don't need a power socket. </s>
<s> I have big hands so ergonomics counts alot. </s>
<s> I also care about the features of the mouse too! </s>
<s> My choices so far: Microsoft Arc Mouse Microsoft Explorer/ Explorer Mini Logitech Vx Nano You guys are welcome to give more suggestions. </s>
<s> I mainly want to see the other people's opinions about these mice and any problems that may have arisen after usage, since I don't want to encounter the problems with a mouse AFTER I buy it. </s>
<s> Thanks alot </s>
<s> It has one and only one quirk. </s>
<s> It sleeps a lot. </s>
<s> That is the first millimeter of movement when it's been sitting still might be ignored. </s>
<s> It's there but not a killer reason for me to change it out. </s>
<s> I'd buy it again. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the advice. </s>
<s> I have seen the v450 nano. </s>
<s> It would be one of my choices as well. </s>
<s> However, I was really looking for a prosumer kind of mouse, like the vx nano (different from v450 nano) </s>
<s> Our family now has 3 of the 450 nanos. </s>
<s> I'm unsure why I'd get the other one today. </s>
