I check the devices manger and it has a error of 10 - it can't be started, also The mass storage controller has the yellow ? with the yellow and back &quot;!&quot; with an error of 28. Any ideas on how to get it running again? Also when i reboot my comp with the hard drive pluged in it keeps cycling the restart, gets to the windows xp screen then restarts, but if the hard drive isn't plugged in i get no problems, And ideas? The stuff on the hard drive is important and i need to access it ASAP

Do you have backups on optical disk? If not you can Google data recovery to find a company that might be able to recover your data. In short, the drive is dead. There is the off chance that the case has died. You might try putting the drive into another case or as a slave in your PC.

789	3	280999	2687394	2686444	sportsstud35	1/24/08 6:29 AM	1.20115614E12	sorry	Sorry, The drive works fine on other computers, and I'm having trouble on all the ports, my usb mouse works fine in the one its in - scared to try to move it. It gives me the error 10, but on the uub controller I have a error 28- thats whats causing the problem I'm guessing. Also another thing I noticed is on my computer there are no network connections, even tho I can see my printer on the network and have internet. But no way to accsess it

789	7	280999	2688106	2688040	sportsstud35	1/24/08 9:29 PM	1.20121014E12	hmm	It didn't do anything, so i changed it back, my external is recognized now, but I still have the yellow &quot;?&quot;'s and &quot;!&quot;'s and also nothing in my networks folder....
789	8	280999	2688290	2688106	R. Proffitt	1/25/08 6:36 AM	1.20124296E12	So one problem down?	As to the network issues, it sounds as if drivers or maybe some firewall like Norton, Mcafee took a dive. But let's start a new discussion on that. Bob
789	9	280999	2688693	2688290	sportsstud35	1/25/08 4:40 PM	1.2012792E12	cool	Cool, on the new decsussion, but any idea what the &quot;?&quot;'s mean?
789	10	280999	2688794	2688693	R. Proffitt	1/25/08 7:16 PM	1.20128856E12	(NT) Usually means disabled device or missing driver.	NIL

I plug in my external, and doesn't work, ahve the yellow &quot;?&quot; for it. any idea's?
789	12	280999	2708317	2708181	R. Proffitt	2/19/08 5:53 AM	1.20340038E12	That's caused by a few things.	1. The bios has usb set to be bootable. 2. There is a corrupt file on the root directory of the usb drive. You may solve this soon.
789	13	280999	2708539	2708317	sportsstud35	2/19/08 9:15 AM	1.2034125E12	would that fix..	If i go in and change that - how would i? Woud that fix the fact that i cant find the harddrive on my computer when its plugged in?
789	14	280999	2708560	2686242	R. Proffitt	2/19/08 9:29 AM	1.20341334E12	From the top.	Reply to the top when we hit the depth limit. &quot;If i go in and change that - how would i? Woud that fix the fact that i cant find the harddrive on my computer when its plugged in?&quot; First, you would read your Gateway manual on the BIOS changes. Next, the drive appears to be still dead or corrupt. At some point you had it working so that was the time to get your files out and to a safe place. Scanning your discussion it looks like some motherboard or other driver has gone missing. Who installed this OS? Bob
789	15	280999	2708653	2708560	sportsstud35	2/19/08 11:53 AM	1.20342198E12	Yes	All of the stuff on the External HD Is backed up to where I can get it - Just easier on the external. As far as installing the OS, That was done by Gateway, Haven't touched it sense i got it. As for the BIOS changes, I can't seem to find where to go in the BIOS, as I don't have the manual anymore - been about a year now and 2 moves.
789	16	280999	2708668	2708653	R. Proffitt	2/19/08 12:10 PM	1.203423E12	You have contridicted yourself.	Above you wrote an answer to &quot;Look for &quot;USB LEGACY SUPPORT&quot; and turn that off.&quot; that told me you had done that. Now you claim you don't know how to get into the BIOS... Something's fishy. The manual is up at gateway.com Bob
789	17	280999	2708754	2708668	sportsstud35	2/19/08 1:45 PM	1.2034287E12	Sorry Miss understood	Sorry I guess I didn't write it correctly, I did turn off USB LEGAcy SUPPORT, But now in the BIOS Menu, I can't find where to turn off the Boot from USB. I can't find the option to turn that off anywhere in the BIOS. Sorry for the mis wording, I will look at the Manual right now, and try to follow it when i get off work in an hour
789	18	280999	2708867	2708754	R. Proffitt	2/19/08 4:33 PM	1.20343878E12	I understand. But be aware I can't read your manual.	I went through this discussion twice and couldn't spot the model number of this gateway laptop. It's very important to give such details in your first entry so that others can fetch the details. As it is I can't check for a manual or point to a page number, suggest a driver, etc.
789	19	280999	2708921	2708867	sportsstud35	2/19/08 5:46 PM	1.20344316E12	I feel dumb	But really appericate your help, I have the Gateway MX6440 laptop.
789	20	280999	2708923	2708921	R. Proffitt	2/19/08 5:49 PM	1.20344334E12	Don't feel that way.	Sometimes I can't find the right words and people don't understand I'm asking for that. For reference the manual and more is at http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Q106/Blade/1008824nv.shtml I'll be back later when I've read more. Bob
789	21	280999	2708989	2686242	R. Proffitt	2/19/08 7:16 PM	1.20344856E12	Gateway's docs are not helping here.	&quot;If available, change the BIOS settings for the hard drive sequence, making sure the USB device is at the top of the list above all other hard drives. Not all BIOS Setup Utilities have this option.&quot; I can't find the exact screens for your BIOS so I will not be able to guide you on how to disable the USB boot process. Bob
789	22	280999	2709032	2708989	sportsstud35	2/19/08 8:06 PM	1.20345156E12	no luck	Bob, I tired to find it but I can't find it in my BIOS, I don't think mine has that option, Also It kept turning off on me in the BIOS, the first time I had about 5 min worth of time to look, then it shut off, i figured i hit something, then Had maybe a mintune, then down to lucky to get 15 seconds before the machine turns its self off, but when I boot to windows its fine... well except the missing wireless and External
789	23	280999	2709882	2709032	sportsstud35	2/20/08 5:53 PM	1.20352998E12	reinstall	Would it be worth it to reinstall windows? would that fix my problems? As I don't want to do it but its starting to look like i have no other choice
789	24	280999	2709976	2709882	R. Proffitt	2/20/08 6:53 PM	1.20353358E12	What if we don't use this external drive?	I've reread this missive and are we still talking about the external hard disk issue?
789	25	280999	2710066	2709976	sportsstud35	2/20/08 9:03 PM	1.20354138E12	yes kind of	In the long of it yes, I still can't get the external HD to work on this computer, I also have the problems with my wireless card in the computer. I have thought that reinstalling windows would set it all to the way it was before any of this started as it would get back to factory settings, I would just need to spend a day or two backing up all my files like music and school work onto DVD's = something I don't really have the time or engery to do. and that would be a last resort If you can think of anything else, in the other thread you asked If i have norton = i do not for anti virus I use McAfee and AVG with Ad=aware for anti spyware. I do appericate all your help and willingness to try to help find out what is causeing this
789	26	280999	2710068	2710066	sportsstud35	2/20/08 9:06 PM	1.20354156E12	Oh and Also	I work at OfficeMax, and was able to get another External - got a Maxtor one touch and have the same problem with it, So its not the drive as the drive works on the other 3 computers I have access to in my house
789	27	280999	2710270	2710068	R. Proffitt	2/21/08 5:46 AM	1.20357276E12	This points to the motherboard chipset driver	Have you installed the latest version of that?
789	28	280999	2710476	2710270	sportsstud35	2/21/08 8:23 AM	1.20358218E12	I will	I haven't touched anything that says motherboard, as I know thats a big deal to the computer and not knowing a whole lot didn't want to mess up something even worse, I will download the driver tonight and see what it does. Can a driver just stop working like that?
789	29	280999	2710534	2710476	R. Proffitt	2/21/08 9:02 AM	1.20358452E12	Yes.	Let me fish (re-read) your post and I'll see if I can give up a link on the driver I'd install. Bob
789	30	280999	2710586	2686242	R. Proffitt	2/21/08 9:45 AM	1.2035871E12	See the download marked &quot;Motherboard Downloads&quot;	It's at http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/search.asp?st=pn&param=1008824 Before running that, I'd unplug the USB drives and uninstall the USB ports in the device manager. XP will redetect on the next boot after the driver install. Bob
789	31	280999	2711055	2710586	sportsstud35	2/21/08 6:29 PM	1.20361854E12	Didn't work	I tired uninstalling the USB drivers, then reinstalled them, but it changed nothing, just when i started up it asked to search for drivers, and didn't find anything.
789	32	280999	2711051	2711055	R. Proffitt	2/21/08 6:48 PM	1.20361968E12	That's a fine clue.	&quot;i started up it asked to search for drivers, and didn't find anything.&quot; That means our motherboard drivers are not installed proper. You can expect a machine in such a state to hang when USB devices are plugged in. Looking again for another driver package since the gateway one didn't work. http://www.randomfix.com/2007/02/08/gateway-mx6440-notebook-modem-and-sound-driver-problem/ is damming. Great scott, they have an unofficial web site with the rest of the drivers. I'll try one more time before I ask you to call gateway to ask them to give you the secret web site. http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Q106/Blade/1008824sp2.shtml tells me its the ATI Radeon Xpress 200M Chipset (RS482M). This driver is at AMD now. But where? Try http://findfiles.com/list.php?string=ati_system_drive_mb.zip&size=180256102&db=Mirrors Bob
789	33	280999	2711060	2711051	sportsstud35	2/21/08 7:08 PM	1.20362088E12	yup	The driver wasn't installed correctly, I think it just had a hicup when installing, I just did it again and its all working now, just now i still have my 2 little yellow friends in the devices manger, as well as no wireless internet and no External support - one more wrench in the thing - my usb mouse and jump drive work fine, but not the Seagate external.... weird huh?
789	34	280999	2712144	2711060	sportsstud35	2/22/08 11:43 PM	1.20372378E12	another wrench	Well i did it - i reinstalled windows, I got my wireless driver back, but now my external is still not showing up - not its not even in the disk managment. any idea's?
789	35	280999	2712451	2712144	R. Proffitt	2/23/08 7:41 AM	1.20375246E12	Same as above.	But maybe I missed something. I see Vista is now the OS supplied. Are you using their restore CDs?
789	36	280999	2712522	2712451	sportsstud35	2/23/08 8:43 AM	1.20375618E12	Yes	My laptop came with XP, So I used their restore CD that came with it - lost all my music, and files - i can get them back but it's just a pain, so its back to factory default as far as i can tell. It reinstalled everything, as I only had the options of reinstall(destructive) and restore- which said it would save all files but didn't, but it appears to have reinstalled my drivers for my wireless that had the same problem but not the external. as all my other usb devices that i could find in the house work, But the external works on all the other computers. I think i'm going to try to use another computer to transfur everything to a new external and try that.
789	37	280999	2712648	2712522	R. Proffitt	2/23/08 10:44 AM	1.20376344E12	If it does not work after a factory restore then...	It could be that note about what you installed. &quot;My laptop came with XP, So I used their restore CD that ..&quot; XP doesn't support over 127GB drives so after a restore to XP I have to get SP1 at minimum installed for big drives to show up. Bob
