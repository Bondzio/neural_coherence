1.1.1	It was working before about a couple of years ago.	St
1.1.2	But when I inserted a DVD yesterday, my computer would just not play it .	St
1.1.3	Why ?	Ques
1.2.1	a couple of reasons.	St
1.2.2	Not being used in a couple of years tells me the laser head is probably dirty.	St
1.2.3	Clean it.	St
1.2.4	Also, the formatting on today's DVDs may not be compatible with the player.	St
1.2.5	Check the doco and compare.	St
1.2.6	But my guess is it's just dirty.	St
1.2.7	Don't watch many movies??	Polite
1.2.8	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.3.1	I was able to play CDs even yesterday.	St
1.3.2	If the laser is gone then it would not have played CDs' also right.	St
1.3.3	It also displays the DVD menu for some DVDs' its only that when I click the PLAY button nothing happens.	St
1.3.4	Also when I open the Sony provided DVD Player software &quot;Media bar&quot; I hear the DVD spinning and then the DVD spinning stops and the play button on the software gets disabled.	St
1.3.5	Does this suggest any other type of problem like software on my computer etc ?	Ques
1.4.1	an audio signal is not as complicated and playing an audio and video signal at the same time.	St
1.4.2	Have you tried cleaning the DVDs?	St
1.4.3	Use a soft all cotton cloth if you do, or a recommended cleaning kit.	St
1.4.4	You said that the player will bring up menus on some DVDs.	St
1.4.5	This still tells me that your player may not be able to play all the different DVD formats out there.	St
1.4.6	Please check this.	Sug
1.4.7	I am talking DVD+R, DVD-R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW.	St
1.4.8	Also, very carefully check the surfaces for scratches.	Sug
1.4.9	Have you tried playing the DVDs on a different player?	St
1.4.10	Let us know.	St
1.4.11	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.5.1	Hi, Sorry for the late response.	St
1.5.2	The DVD I am trying to play is regular Hollywood DVD in DVD-video format (not +RW/-RW/+R/-R).	St
1.5.3	If it had been DVD-RW +RW etc I would have been doubtful if it would ever play on my SONY VIAO notebook computer (I donot think those formats do).	St
1.5.4	But since its a regular Hollywood DVD video, and my note book has a DVD-ROM drive and I have played DVD-videos a couple of years ago, it should very well play on my drive.	St
1.5.5	Since these videos play perfectly on my JVC DVD player, I dont think its an issue with the DVDs'.	St
1.5.6	I tried installing my DVD/CD driver by removing it in safe mode and letting the OS (Window 98) re-install by rebooting the computer.	St
1.5.7	It still does not work.	St
1.5.8	The DVD disc just spins initially when inserted and then stops and does nothing.	St
1.5.9	Even if I open the SONY provided media bar software to play the DVD, the PLAY button is disabled.	St
1.5.10	Does this give you any clues as to what could be the way to fix this problem and be able to enjoy the DVDs' on my laptop computer when I am travelling around rather than just sit at home and watch the DVDs' on the DVD-player.	St
1.5.11	?	Ques
1.6.1	You have not mentioned what software you are using to view dvds, or os.	St
1.6.2	try reinstalling the software (power dvd etc) then give it another try, after that length of time any program can get corrupted.	St
1.7.1	I uninstalled the old &quot;media bar&quot; software and resintalled the media bar software yesterday from the SONY application recovery CD I have.	St
1.7.2	Even then , the DVD would not play.	St
1.7.3	The play button is always disabled.	St
1.7.4	Any more suggestions would help.	St
1.8.1	The recovery cd probably has an older version on it.	St
1.8.2	Go to Sony's website and download the updated version and install it.	St
1.8.3	Hang in there.	St
1.8.4	The fact that the play button is deactivated tells me the software is not recognizing that particular dvd as playable.	St
1.8.5	This could be either a hardware or software issue.	St
1.8.6	Let us know.	St
1.8.7	and life goes on... Jack	St

1.10.1	My wife's Dell laptop uses an older DVD-rom and can only read &quot;DVD- &quot;, not the &quot;DVD +&quot;.	St
1.10.2	Check all of your documentation the came with you unit and it should say specifically what formats it will read.	St
1.10.3	When my friend and I purchased a 100 pack of the &quot;DVD -&quot; disks to archive a set of various data and entertainment files, we found that they would't play on her laptop or our bargain DVD player.	St
1.10.4	Had to go back and get some &quot;DVD -&quot; media and all now play on all the afore-mentioned players.	St
1.10.5	Try you docs first and then check for the format on the disks you want to plsy.	St
1.10.6	Your only so;ution may to upgrase to new player on your unit ...(if it is possible).	St
1.10.7	Notebooks and laptops are notoriusly un-upgradable.	St
1.11.1	Even after uninstalling and reinstalling SONY Media bar software from the recovery CD it didnot work.	St
1.11.2	So I searched around and found Power DVD is one of the best universal DVD players that usually works for most people with DVD play problems on computers.	St
1.11.3	So I installed Power DVD Version 6.0 and Microsoft DirectX 9.0 C. Both installations went fine.	St
1.11.4	But now what happens is Power DVD can recognize that I inserted a DVD video disc (I am not meaning any of the recordable DVD formats.	St
1.11.5	Just the plain old DVD videos).	St
1.11.6	Power dvd starts up and starts playing automatically unlike how my SONY Media bar software was behaving before.	St
1.11.7	So far so good.	St
1.11.8	However the problem is, I can see only symmetric rainbow colors playing over and over on the screen.	St
1.11.9	I can hear the DVD audio in the background.	St
1.11.10	But the video is just some symmetric random hazy array of shapes that repeat over and over again and again.	St
1.11.11	I donot see even a bit of the actual movie video.	St
1.11.12	I tried different movie DVDs'.	St
1.11.13	I get different patterns of symmetric shapes with different DVDs'.	St
1.11.14	Nothing more.	St
1.11.15	Does this suggest where the problem could be ?	Ques
1.11.16	Appreciate your help in advance.	St
1.12.1	u just clear the lens of the dvd drive and restart the desktop/laptop wat u have then u can play dvd on ur dvd drive.	Sug
1.12.2	good bye!	Polite
1.12.3	respond me if any further problems.	Sug
