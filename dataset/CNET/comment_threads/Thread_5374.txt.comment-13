In some Intel documents 65 C is in the normal range, however the internal sensor which causes the throttling or shutdown is very reliable.
My suggestion is that one should always have a top exhaust fan and a side fan that brings room ambient air directly into the area where the CPU HSF is.
I'm not sure how one handles the SLI cards.
Wonder if cyberguys have anything exactly for that.
