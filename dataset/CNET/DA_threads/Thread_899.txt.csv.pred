1.1.1	Somebody once said to me that a PC only uses about as much electricty as a light bulb .	St
1.1.2	Is this true ?	Ques
1.1.3	If so how much would it cost to have that light bulb turned on all the time .	St
1.1.4	Is the cost of this more or less than what it might be if something went wrong to reasons contributed with turning on and turning off the PC .	St
1.1.5	I myself turn off my PC after a while .	St
1.1.6	I think that things are more likely to go wrong if something is in constant use .	St
1.1.7	i.e .	St
1.1.8	a freind of mine had his fan/cooler breakdown on him and when this happened the motherboard got too hot and became partially non-functional and so he had to have his motherboard replaced .	St
1.1.9	Surely if the fan was left to run for too long then this would get too hot and the motor or circuits would burn out , causing more damage in the long run ?	Ques
1.2.1	The truth is that an average computer uses less than a penny of ellectricity per hour , so why not leave it on all the time .	St
1.2.2	like a light bulb , the turning on of the computer uses the most ellectricity , so it would make sence to leave it on , in order to save money .	St
1.2.3	Providing you have adiquate coolage for the processor , it makes good sence .	St
1.2.4	Leaving it on gives the computer a smoother path , where through turning it off every day , you leave the risk of causing errors .	St
1.2.5	No matter how careful you are .	St
1.2.6	Like a car engine , the processor needs time to warm up in order to work at its fullest .	St
1.2.7	We already know that our computers only use a fraction of what they are capable of , but if the computer is turned off , then the processor cools , the computer is set back to sqaure one , and in time slows down in doing the simplest of tasks .	St
1.2.8	To leave it on , is to prolong the life of the battery , and keep the working parts moving .	St
1.2.9	Surely this makes sense to you all ?	Ques
