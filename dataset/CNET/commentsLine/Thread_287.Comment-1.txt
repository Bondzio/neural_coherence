i'm trying not to get my hopes up, but i bet that my mbp will come back with something wrong.
if apple moves to replaced it like they had suggested to me (i hope), i would probably get a santa rosa machine.
i doubt that they could get me the exact same one i had, since the 2.16ghz models are no longer produced.
their store site does not list any refurbished ones either, thought that doesn't mean anything... i wouldn't want a refurb though.
the mac is still relatively new... i'm wondering if they would swap it with the low end 2.2ghz model, which really isn't too different, or if they would let me go for the 2.4ghz model.
the low end one has half of the graphics memory, a somewhat slower clock speed, and wouldn't give me any performance boosts that i could actually see.
coming from a 2.16ghz model, would a 2.4ghz (or a 2.6?)
show any increased performance?
i mean, i'd have a new nvidia card with double the memory that was on my ati card, and i'd have a boost of at least 240mhz.
plus, the battery life is supposed to be very good with those led displays.
i hope they let me get a good one that works so i don't have to deal with any more problems... i've already lost a great deal of time because of all this.
not to mention i broke a router in the process and had to get another one... i'll be happy with at least 2.4ghz and a 250gb hd.
2gb of ram is fine for me.
even though the 2.2ghz model replaced mine, i really could use a little extra power.
the 2.4ghz model seems to represent the santa rosa line anyway, does it not?
