i need to take a portable self contained scanner into the field to capture archival photographs.
it would have to be a flat bed type as these photographs would not survive a journey through the sheet fed variety.
i would need on-board storage (as much as possible) and portable power supply.
output to a mac would be preferable but not a necessity.
i couldn't find any product in previous threads on this subject, but wonder if there are any new products on the market.
i gather a high resolution (&gt;10 megs) digital camera might be the answer, but i need the highest resolution i can get.
any suggestions?
thanks.
