i started using pc's in 1998. it was a desktop gateway 433mhz celeron with ati rage 128 graphics and a dvd drive and a seperate iomega zip 650 cd burner and a zip 100 drive.
it was a great workhorse for multimedia and music management.
windows 98(non second edition) never crashed on me.
not ever!
win 98 is the most reliable os micrsoft has made upto now.
