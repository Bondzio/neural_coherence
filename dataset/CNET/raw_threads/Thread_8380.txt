I want to allow other users to use this document either FTP or HTTP or any other alternative way through internet. Is it possible to share folder from my PC or Server and allow other ppl to use it? If it is, what are the process of sharing? It will be very helpful for me if anybody provides solution of this problem..

Does your ISP provide you with webspace or ftp ?? What I would do is get a free web host i used to use www.web1000.com then get a free ftp client and upload what you need to your site and give ppl the link the the file
