The x1300 is the entry-level GPU from ATI.
Consider these benchmarks: http://www.hothardware.com/viewarticle.aspx?page=13&articleid=734&cid=2 http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1875353,00.asp The x1300 is slower than a 6600gt and x1600xt yet those cards are only $140 (compared to the $200 price for the x1300).
To quote ExtremeTech: &quot;We're starting to see a pattern: ATI's new low-end card is slower than all the other cards in its price range.&quot; Every card I mentioned in my previous post will PERFORM MUCH BETTER than the x1300 and cost less than $200.
Many articles have proven that 512MB offers no benefit except at super-high resolutions (1600x1200 and higher) with 8xAA.
The x1300 cannot support those resolutions.
At 800x600 and 1024x768 (which is really all that card can do smoothly), 128MB is adequate and 256MB is more than enough.
512MB is just marketing gimmick on this card... like putting a spoiler on Kia.
It may look cool, but it won't make it go any faster!
