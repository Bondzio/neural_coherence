255	0	344063	3050673	NR	Guerito	5/26/09 4:00 PM	1.2433536E12	Desperately need BOOTMGR	I have built quite afew systems but my latest has me baffled. Gigabyte AM2+ 770 UD3 Athlon x2 2gbs 800mhz DDR2 Maxtor 160 ATA drive Optiarc/Sony DVDRW All hardware present in BIOS and seems normal except... ...after build powered up went into BIOS changed BOOT order to CD 1st then HDD, inserted Win 7 disc, restarted and OS began to load. Got to expanding files screen and got the message &quot;Some files are missing Windows cannot continue&quot; or words to that affect. Have used this DVD before with no problem. Tried again to install. Got the BOOTMGR is missing. Strange I thought, I am booting off the disc. Tried several restarts and got same message. Tried Vista Ultimate disc. Same error. Desperation turned me to XP disc...same error BOOTMGR is missing. How is this posible? I could understand having this error after changing or swapping out drives but this is a clean install on a new HDD and how can all the OS discs have BOOTMGR missing? I don't have a floppy installed or a USB device with enough capacity to boot from but I am guessing that even if I did the same error would come up. Into my 2nd hour now of trying different BIOS settings, Fail Safe etc. still same problem. What went wrong? How can I get my new machine to bot of a DVD and install? Realy frustrated...please help!

You do not mention whether it is new or not but try it in another computer to see if it will allow a boot up in the other computer, if you can get that far.
