1. chassis fans should be oriented to bring in outside air through the front (and sometimes the sides) and to expel component-heated warm air out the back (and sometimes the top).
2. cpu fans are generally oriented to force air downward over the hs to dissipate cpu heat.
however there is at least one formerly prominent hs mfg (alphacool) that specified just the opposite for their units.
3. and it you look very carefully ...youll almost always find two arrows embossed on the outside of the fan showing the direction of fan rotation and direction of the airflow.
