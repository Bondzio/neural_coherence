<s> I bought a Free Agent in Dec '08 for a computer with an XP operating system, installed it Jan '09 by Mar. </s>
<s> 5, 2009 it stopped working. </s>
<s> The light is pulsing as if it is working but it is not recognized by the computer. </s>
<s> I went to Seagate's website and there was no help there except to exchange it because it was still under warranty. </s>
<s> When what I need is a fix to recover my data from the drive. </s>
<s> I also went back to the store where I bought it from and their solution was to open it up and put it inside my mini tower or buy another enclosure. </s>
<s> Of course opening the enclosure will void by warranty and I still may not recover my data. </s>
<s> I like the advice given. </s>
<s> It's one of well worn good answers. </s>
<s> Putting the drive into another PC (or another USB2 enclosure) will prove two things. </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> If it works, the enclosure is bad, get another one. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> If it doesn't work you know the drive is bad. </s>
<s> If the drive is bad then you're probably SOL on the data. </s>
