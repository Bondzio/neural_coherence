99.99% of the time set the tcpip settings in xp and 2000 to dhcp then plug them into the dlink router.
bingo.
they are now networked.
you have yet to reveal what networking feature is not working or if you can't share files or more.
i can't guess what step is eluding you.

please take time to tell more.
