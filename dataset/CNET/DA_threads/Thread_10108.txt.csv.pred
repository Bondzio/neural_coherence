1.1.1	What is the difference between Quad Core and Dual Core?	St
1.1.2	I would think a Pentium D Quad Core Processor would be better than an Intel Core 2 Duo but it seems like it isn't?	St
1.1.3	How is that?	St
1.2.1	quad cores have 4 cpus; dual cores have 2 cpus.	St
1.2.2	pentium Ds are dual core versions of the pentium 4; there is no pentium D quad core.	St
1.2.3	the core2 cpu is a different design than a p4 and has more compute performance at a lower clock speed.	St
1.2.4	so a 2ghz core2 cpu can outperform a 3ghz p4 in most applications.	St
1.2.5	core2 is available as dual core and quad core chips.	St
1.3.1	Quad Core CPUs have four physical cores, while Dual Core CPUs have two physical cores, both comprise a single CPU.	St
1.3.2	As has been said, Pentium D is the dual core rendition of the Pentium 4, using the Smithfield and Presler cores, while Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad are P6 derived and much more efficient in terms of FP performance and memory efficiency, which increases overall performance.	St
1.3.3	The advantage to multi-core CPUs is the ability for the CPU to do more than one thing at a time, which increases system performance (it is not 2.0x, or anywhere near 2.0x), and allows more complex calculations to be completed, which means a quad core can do more than a dual core, however this ability to do more won't usually manifest performance increases in situations where it can't be utilized (just because you have a Ferrari doesn't mean your daily drive is any shorter).
