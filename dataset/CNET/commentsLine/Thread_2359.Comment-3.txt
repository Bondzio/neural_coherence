hi, do i have an option of windows xp 64bit cause iam not really happy with vista.
i like the vista interface and everything, but the background software that runs in vista is very annoying.
i also want to know weather the ram iam going to buy now will match and work along with my old ram.
cause i heard about some latency and other stuff should also match.
