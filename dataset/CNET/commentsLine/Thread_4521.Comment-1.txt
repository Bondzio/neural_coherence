hi all, i've looked through several forums and websites about this problem but all of them were more or less out dated.
long story short: -brand new hp slimline desktop, win8 -has two dvi ports, dvi-d and dvi-i (came with dvi-i to vga adapter) -tv is a samung led, 1080p.
bought about a year and a half ago, never any problems.
ps3 is hooked up to hdmi port, no issues.
tv recognizes pc via vga adapter, but picture isn't good, so i bought a dvi to hdmi cable.
while windows is booted i can unplug vga cable/adapter, and plug in dvi/hdmi cable--will get a picture on the tv in hd, like normal.
however, if i restart the pc or shut it down, then boot, while the dvi/hdmi is connected (and vga is not) the tv displays a &quot;no signal&quot; message.
in the &quot;source&quot; options of the tv, the hdmi port is shown as recognized.
this leads me to think that the pc is for some reason not booting to the dvi-d port.
if this is the case, how do i change this?
please help!
