Your message implies, but doesn't state, you'll be using your laptop for college.
You don't state if you're already in college or will be attending later.
I assume you're already in, and know what you need.
If you're not already in, you should first find out what the college recommends.
You wouldn't want to be using a Mac when the college and other students are using MS.
