1.1.1	I am researching components in while I save up for my first PC build .	St
1.1.2	The goal is to build a budget/low end HTPC .	St
1.1.3	I do n't know if I have a need for an HTPC and really just want to do the build for fun/curiosity .	St
1.1.4	It may end up as a general purpose desktop when it is all said and done .	St
1.1.5	What would be desirable specs for a processor in a build like this ? & lt ; div & gt ; I sifted through processors on Newegg and made a list of processors with 65W or less , most current sockets , and $ 100 or less with up to $ 125 as a grey zone .	St
1.1.6	This leaves the Celeron G530/540 , Pentium G600 & amp ; G800 series , Athlon II X2 series & amp ; X3 400e series , AMD A4 APUs and the A6 3500 APU .	St
1.1.7	The i3-2100 is in the grey zone .	St
1.1.8	I currently am leaning toward the A6-3500 .	St
1.1.9	Are there any big downsides to going with it vs an Athlon II X2/X3 , Pentium G800 series , or i3 2100 ? & lt ; div & gt ; I purposely left out discussing form factor to keep this post shorter .	St
1.1.10	I plan on starting a thread when I look into motherboards .	St
1.1.11	& lt ; /div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.2.1	I wanted to mention , my second choice right now is the Athlon II X2 250 .	St
1.2.2	I 'm not sure if a discrete graphics card would be needed with something like this , though .	St
1.3.1	One has to know if it will be transcoding content on the fly .	St
1.3.2	If so , you need about double that for CPU power .	St
1.3.3	If it 's just to play content on some HDMI 1080 display , then pair up any CPU you listed with the fanless ATI 5450 card and you are there .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the reply , Bob .	St
1.4.2	You 'll have to forgive me , I am new to some of these terms .	St
1.4.3	They way I understand it , transcoding on the fly would be taking a video file saved as one format and convert it to a different format so that a certain program can display it all while the program is playing the video and the file would not be resaved in the new format ?	Ques
1.4.4	Would transcoding not on the fly then be converting the file to a different format , saving it , and then playing the newly saved file ?	Ques
1.4.5	Is it common to need to transcode on the fly ?	Ques
1.4.6	Would n't you be able to get around this need by choosing a program that could display the original format ?	Ques
1.4.7	I think I would mostly use the machine for streaming HD video and playing saved DVD/BluRay content .	St
1.4.8	It would be unlikely , at least early on to transcode on the fly .	St
1.4.9	If I get into it that much , I would likely just look into building a new machine .	St
1.4.10	Final question : What level of processor would do away with the need for a discrete graphics card for 1080p viewing ?	Ques
1.4.11	I was under the impression they were not needed with any A series APU .	St
1.4.12	I 'm not against a discrete card , just trying to get a feel for cost/benefit .	St
1.4.13	Thanks Dylan	St
1.5.1	Because you would be the one creating or supplying the content .	St
1.5.2	As to streaming , if the file is to be streamed , then we do n't need that powerful card or CPU .	St
1.5.3	We 're moving bytes down the pipe and not much else .	St
1.5.4	I think the CPU and the 5450 would be a great solution .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.6.2	I am sure I will have many more questions .	St
