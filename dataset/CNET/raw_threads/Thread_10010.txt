Four port wireless router, cable modem, PCI NIC, and wireless NIC for my laptop. Excellent support. All D-link devices self discover each other and self configure. If you mix and match you're in for headaches. Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained. See the CNet faces behind the posts. I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image. - - Stephen W. Hawking
