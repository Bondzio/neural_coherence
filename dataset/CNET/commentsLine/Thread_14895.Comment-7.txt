i believe you misunderstood.
the p/s units come with dual fans(already installed) actaully on the p/s unit.
the push and pull as it were to better handle the p/s unit demands to exhaust its own heat build-up.
the p/s itself will help vent system heat build-up but with dual fans it just gets the job done alittle better.
that doesn't exclude any other &quot;system case&quot; fan(s).
the system case *may* have an empty spot to install fan, use it.
if none present, then use the a slot fan that mounts in a empty buss slot either getting power from the slot or actual power harness.
these types of fans directly exhaust the system case plus may help vent the area next to a buss card or just the case itself.
other fan(s) whose only purpose is simply to get &quot;air flow&quot; going to prevent &quot;dammed air&quot; sticking too long in any one area, like wire harness or along cards.
a well placed &quot;blow hole&quot; on top of system case helps alot as heat rises, but you usually have to make a hole and then install a fan.
as to the pcpower andcooling mentions, they basically say, you need a &quot;proper air flow&quot; to best handle heat situations.
that's why you see the frt.
case fan usually low, the rear exhaust fan, higher.
the orginal p/s unit fan(s) are carry over when that was that was needed, but more importantly it handled the p/s heat venting plus any system demands.
of course, we've come a long way from that, some systems do have 4-6fans installed if air-cooled.
