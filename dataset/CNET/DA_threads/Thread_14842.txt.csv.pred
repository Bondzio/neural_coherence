1.1.1	We recently had to replace the hard drive in one of our Windows XP PCs.	St
1.1.2	I thought I had everything up and running OK, but have since discovered that when we attempt to read a diskette, a message displays asking us to insert a disk in Drive A:, even though there is already one there.	St
1.1.3	Did I miss something in the setup?	St
1.2.1	It may be that the drive is not hooked up or is not connected properly.	St
1.2.2	Recheck the drive and connections.	St
1.2.3	If it still does not work, try a different drive.	St
1.2.4	It may seem improbable but it has happened that you missed the DC connector alignment.	St
1.2.5	I had it happen to me.	St
1.2.6	I also have had the BIOS report the drive was connected and it was, in fact, not connected.	St
1.2.7	The BIOS must not actually check that it is there.	St
1.2.8	It depends on the motherboard.	St
