The first thing I would do is disconnect anything that the power supply is connected to (hard drives/optical drives), pull out any add on cards, and also the memory.
Then try to boot.
See if it stays on ( you should get a continuos beep for no memory) If it doesn't stay on, it's either the power supply, switch on the case, or the motherboard.
There is also a chance that the motherboard is touching the metal of your case, so take the board out of the case.
Be careful to set it on a non conductive surface and try it again.
If you get the same results, its either one of the above.
Get a power supply tester from your local computer shop to test the power supply.
If it does stay powered on with a repeatitive beep, add one thing at a tme until you get the probelm reproduced.
Hope this helps!
