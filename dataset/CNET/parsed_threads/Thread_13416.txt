<s> I have an e-machine T1440. </s>
<s> It has a 1.40Ghz Intel Celeron processor,running Windows XP home edition. </s>
<s> It came with 128mb SDRAM. </s>
<s> I added a stick of 256mb SDRAM to it. </s>
<s> when I check the computer to see how much memory there is, it still says 128. </s>
<s> I was told that it will detect the added ram automatically. </s>
<s> I added the ram because I was getting low memory popups. </s>
<s> I am still getting them. </s>
<s> Did the computer not take the new ram? </s>
<s> The new stick of ram has been tested good also. </s>
<s> does the ram show in bios? </s>
<s> if not try taking out the old stick and swapping slots. </s>
<s> or make sure rams inserted correctly </s>
<s> If Control Panel/System still shows only 128K then the memory is not being recognized. </s>
<s> Either it is the wrong type, or it is not installed properly. </s>
<s> Your system should recognize it automatically. </s>
<s> well sometimes people trying to sell RAM will send pop-ups to your computer telling you you are low on ram. </s>
<s> I have 512mb of ram and still see them. </s>
<s> if this is an internet - sent popup, ignore them. </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> It is windows giving me a low memory warning. </s>
<s> I've tryed switching te slots and leaving one out, I still get 128k no matter what I do. </s>
<s> just a guess, but I was once told that not all RAM fits in all motherboards. </s>
<s> did you consult you Mboard website for recommended brands of memory? </s>
<s> might be a conflict there. </s>
<s> in the interim, try shutting down any mem resident programs you don't need. </s>
<s> good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help everyone. </s>
<s> I tryed booting up with only the 256 in both slots, and it won't boot. </s>
<s> So my guess is the ram is bad, or doesn't work with my motherboard. </s>
<s> Crucial.com says the density might be wrong, and that the motherboard is picky about its ram. </s>
