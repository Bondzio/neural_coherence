1.1.1	I have an Artec 8R/4RW/32X CD-RW on my PC working under Win 98 2nd edition and Nero 5 Burning Rom.	St
1.1.2	I have only used the unit a few times in the last year but it worked OK.	St
1.1.3	When I tried to backup some info recently, the software asked me to load a blank CD and then started and completed the burn process, but nothing physically happened to the CD disc.	St
1.1.4	If I load a CD into CD-RW I can read the contents, but if I try to burn a new CD the software (Nero) goes through its burn process and says burn completed OK, but the CD does not eject automatically and when checked there is nothing on the CD and no physical signs of any burn.	St
1.1.5	I suspect the burn part of the CD-RW has gone faulty but wondered if there were any tests I should follow to confirm this before purchasing a new unit.	St
