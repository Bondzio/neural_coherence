hello, one of my co-workers purchased a new imac g5 over six months ago and loves it.
no problems ever.
i think that apple did their job on this one.
yet, he leaves his toaster oven on repeatedly.
he will probably burn his house down some day.
he does not use his imac for frying eggs in the morning either.
seriously, on the other hand, another co-worker bought one of the brand-new imac g4s before and has had a lot of problems with it for over a year.
but, not overheating.
mostly software issues.
where in the world did you hear the feedback that the imac g5 overheated and fried?
i would like to know please?
need facts and documentation!
if it is true, than i think that it could become the next george forman fry-o-lator!
foodnetwork.com could be selling them next.
i think that i am getting hungry with all this frying stuff.
is it also good for toasting crumpets also?
thought that i would keep the discussion light.
:) kevin
