Howdy, I have the same issue, for about a week now.
Provider sent me a new modem, but I unlocked it by going into my providers supplied software and loading a prior configuration.
However once I did this I lost my CD drives and am now at a point where my system will not boot.
Outside of my computer not booting, which could have been done by me, I was not able to access the internet from my PC.
I could access the internet wirelessly.
I am trying to recover and will repost if I get past my inability to boot the system.
Best of luck.
John
