and i also tried the freezer method, which also didn't work.
it does make a distinctive noise... an intermittent beeping which is supposedly the sign of a damaged motor for maxtor drives.
so i guess i am out of luck.
i'd really like to get the data back, but not enough to want to pay a retrieval service big bucks.
maybe i will try slamming it.
thanks.
