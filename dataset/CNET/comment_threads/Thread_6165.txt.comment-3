Ah thanks for the stats in detail.
So clearly the internal drive will be much faster, but my sound card is also on the PCI bus (which my understanding is the number you state is shared amongst everything).
Also, I'm not sure - does the AGP video card draw from that as well?
Thanks for the prompt reply.
This follow-up is to primarily fuel or extenguish my lust for an onboard SATA adapter.
