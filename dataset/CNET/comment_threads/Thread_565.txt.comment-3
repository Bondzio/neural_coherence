The computer the hard drive is on now is presently working but getting old, about 6 years old HP 6545c with win98se.
It has a lot of business info on it and when we get another computer we wanted to just place it in it so we can have all the info we need instead of transferring it over to the new hard drive.
We plan to get another HP so I thought that might things easier.
Would it be better to just transfer everything over to the new hard drive?
How hard is that to do?
I just didn't want to use up all the new hard drives space.
