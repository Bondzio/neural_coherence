<s> Hello, I use a webcam over skype to chat long-distance with my family. </s>
<s> The kid moves around a lot and doesnt stay in front of the webcam and I think it would be convenient if we had a wireless/bluetooth webcam which we can point at the kid wherever he goes. </s>
<s> Does anybody have any suggestions for a wireless/bluetooth webcam for this application? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Bluetooth's bandwidth is too slow for this. </s>
<s> You'll also want support from software to let them view the camera. </s>
<s> Today this would likely be a wifi webcam but nothing seems to fit what I would think a consumer could use. </s>
<s> Almost all of them require some networking knowledge and you telling the person on the other side how to view said camera. </s>
<s> If you are technically inclined and could rig battery power to such, here's a possible unit. </s>
