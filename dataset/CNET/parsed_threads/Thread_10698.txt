<s> My friend's monitor picture keeps sliding off about two inches to the left and in order to bring it back to the centre, he has to adjust via buttons on the front of monitor. </s>
<s> It holds for a couple of seconds/minutes then slides to the left again. </s>
<s> Anyone know what the problem is ? </s>
<s> Have to say what gfx card and system ure using! </s>
<s> Maybe driver issues or junk monitor? </s>
