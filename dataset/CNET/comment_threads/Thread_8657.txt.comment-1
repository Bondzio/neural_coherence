I am currently setting up a network in a small retail store.
They are looking to have 5 computers and possibly add one more, and a server.
They want all of the computers to have access to the server since they will be using a POS system and right now the point of sale has different information on each computer (which is not a good thing).'
The reason I am going with wireless is that they constantly move there displays and only one of the computers is in a permanent spot.
Which equipment would you guys suggest for this setup?
And what would be the ideal way to set it up to access the server?
Thanks
