As a student, I also appreciate being able to easily transport the laptop to and from school every day - I also really need the laptop to be durable! On that note, I have narrowed down two laptops that I particularly liked: the Asus UX32A and the Asus S400CA. Both have i3 processors and 500GB of storage (more than enough) as well as 4GB of storage? Which laptop would be better for my usage, considering the requirements I listed above? Thank you!

Here's the dictionary. &quot;able to withstand wear, pressure, or damage; hard-wearing.&quot; I would not subject today's laptops to pressure or damage. If this is indeed a criteria you have to move to laptops such as the Panasonic Toughbooks. Why not treat it gently? Bob

As a clarification, I am not going to &quot;throw it around&quot; and be rough with it. I just want to know if it is able to last as long - I am asking because it seems really thin and might be a tad flimsy. In general, are Ultrabooks good enough to program with and research with? Thank you all for your excellent advice!

The Asus x202e looks nicely built but just like all the models except for those Toshiba toughbooks I have to be gentle. And let's call out the battery with it's 300 cycle rating. Let's say an owner charged it daily to use it on battery power every day. The battery would be worn out in one year (almost all laptops have this type battery) so durable is not a word I'd use here.

But thank you Bob, for your input on battery. I am going to assume therefore that all batteries with most laptops function this way... Is there anyone who can answer three simple questions - 1) Might the UX32A be damaged easily? 2) Which is better for power - the UX32A or the S400CA? 3) Which is better for programming - the UX32A or the S400CA?

Today a member is sharing a story about a drop from 1.5 feet and the HDD and other parts have failed. 2. The i5 wins the CPU benchmark round. 3. The 14 inch screen for me. Looking at these closely, they are similar in many ways to the x202e I have from the office. The x202e looks great for hitting the round to do support for our apps. But for programming I'm back to some 15.6 inch laptop with the usual 16GB RAM, big HDD, etc. Bob

2103	8	604184	5512015	5511996	R. Proffitt	10/26/13 11:30 AM	1.382787E12	I looked this link.	http://www.cnet.com/laptops/asus-vivobook-s400ca/4505-3121_7-35547535.html notes an i5 and 15 inch screen. Sadly it appears you have left out the EXACT model so I took a chance and used the first CNET review I found on each model. I would find a 13 inch screen too small. Here's a setup I used before and similar today. Link follows. Bob -&gt; http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/desktop2.jpg
