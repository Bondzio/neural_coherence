As Bob said no need for new motherboard to add a capture or sound card.
For info on your mobo download Belarc Advisor http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html Find what free pci slots are available and buy the appropriate cards.
Choose a capture card that does not require a seperate audio connection, and problem solved.
My Compro Digital/Anolouge TV tuner capture card requires no connection to the sound card.
No doubt there others.
