Router #1 is the new Apple AirPort Extreme (2013) plugged into an ADSL modem in the lounge. Router #2 is a Netgear R6300 and is in the downstairs bedroom. How can I connect these 2 wirelessly to make the downstairs bedroom and other rooms downstairs have a strong connection. I don't want to run a wired connection due to logistics. Both routers are 802ac so I presume the 2 routers will have a strong connection between them with 802ac and the beam technology built in. But I need to know how to set up each router to make this possible? And also do I connect to router #2 (Netgear) with a LAN cable into my downstairs computer or will that be able to distribute a wireless signal to seperate devices downstairs ie computer/ipad/iphone?? Ideally I would like to connect my iMac via a cable but also be able to use my iphone and iPad downstairs aswell off of the Netgear router via wireless if this is possible? I have been reading a few forums and believe you can bridge routers or set them up as access points but I need some help on the specifics on my set up please! Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Maybe you could do this if the netgear was on the internet connection since from what I read the apple router can be a repeater (that's no bridge.) From what you wrote I doubt you want a bridge but may want a repeater. As in all these setup the repeater is placed halfway from the source to the final destination. I've lost count how many times that they put the repeater in the room that had bad coverage. Bob
