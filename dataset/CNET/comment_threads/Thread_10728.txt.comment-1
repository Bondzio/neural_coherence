I have just been given 2 old computers a Dell and a Tiny to play with.
I want to find out what hardware is inside without dismantling them.
Is there any software that will do this for me.
I want to find out what kind of memory they have, what hard drives and what processor.
I know I can get some info from My Computer etc.
The Dell one is running Win 98 but I haven't tried the Tiny one yet.
Any help gratefuly received
