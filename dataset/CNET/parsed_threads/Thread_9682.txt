<s> Just got a new desktop PC, Compaq Presario with AMD Sempron 3400 and 512 MB of memory, but.. when starting up the computer, it takes long to show my 1st page and the surfing speed is slow especially the pages from foreign country. </s>
<s> I'm using Window XP, can anyone tell me how to improve the speed of page loading up...? </s>
<s> Thanks a bundle. </s>
