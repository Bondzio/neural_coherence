1.1.1	Hi , i bought a new memory slot for my old PC and installed it it worked well , but when i installed my old memory slot with the new one the windows stopped and a blue screen appear which says that windows stopped to not cause some damage , but the old memory slot was working well before i installed it with the new one they are the same module and the same speed sorry about my english	St
1.2.1	I 'd talk to those that know your machine and see what they think .	St
1.2.2	I have some ideas but for now ca n't give advice with only this story .	St

1.3.1	http : //imageshack.us/photo/my-images/62/4ia.png/ The motherboard is VIA P4M800-8237 and i think that the link above provide some information about my PC	St
1.4.1	And clicking it takes me to http : //imageshack.us/f/62/4ia.png/ and 404 not found .	St
1.4.2	The p4m800 is many years old so for now my advice is a good cleaning , replace all heatsink compound , check fans and if the PSU is over 4 years old , replace that with same rating but add 100 more Watts .	St
1.4.3	The reason why is well discussed but given the lack of detail in this discussion I have to move to the usual answer for an old PC .	St
