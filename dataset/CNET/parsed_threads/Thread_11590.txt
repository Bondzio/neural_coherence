<s> Hi This decision is painfully difficult for me right now. </s>
<s> I can't decide between tablet hybrids. </s>
<s> I know the specs and everything, but the design type is eluding me. </s>
<s> I need to use a tablet mostly as an e-reader and math writer (stylus) for my books and math class, but I need it to function well with a keyboard for typing essays and reports for english, science, ss, theology. </s>
<s> The ultimate goal is to have a mid-cheap atom based tablet plus keyboard, preferred to have trackpad. </s>
<s> Most have 2GB lpddr2 and 1.5(1.8)Ghz clover trail. </s>
<s> I'd like to keep it in the atom tablet range to keep it cheap. </s>
<s> I'm mostly stuck between tablets like the asus vivotab TF810C, and the dell latitude 10 business model plus bluetooth keyboard case and larger battery. </s>
<s> Other than that, HP envy x2 is nice, but no digitizer. </s>
<s> Any help with this or added tablet options would be great. </s>
<s> With the asus vivotab, I'm reaching $870 with msd card and keyboard dock. </s>
<s> This is getting into ultrabook range, but the lenovo yoga doesn't support active digitizers, and I don't know any other convertibles in this range that reach 8+hr for a full day's use at school. </s>
<s> Why this is, is well discussed. </s>
<s> But here we go again. </s>
<s> Since the battery is just a 300 cycle rated part and the warranty only calls the battery bad when it drops to 50% capacity you see that to get 8 hours a day for 2 years you need a battery that when new hits 16 hours and then in 2 years you are still getting your 8 hours. </s>
<s> What's odd about such a requirement is it's rarity. </s>
<s> You might find new students that want this or think it's a requirement but if it was then wouldn't there be plenty of choices? </s>
<s> OK, battery's done. </s>
<s> On to the digitizer. </s>
<s> What do you use now? </s>
<s> Why I ask is that I find many ask for this then in a year they are back to mouse or pad. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm in high school right now, and my classes are still crammed together, making a 7 hour school day. </s>
<s> There's my 8 hour requirement. </s>
<s> After school, I'm free to move about and find a power outlet. </s>
<s> Next year, I'll be in college and have charge time between classes. </s>
<s> I might start saving now and sell this tablet hybrid after a year to move up to a core i hybrid with less battery and more performance. </s>
<s> I've done my research on digitizer pens and palm rejection and how it works. </s>
<s> Last year, I was all pen and paper. </s>
<s> I'm very interested in writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus. </s>
<s> I'll be adjusting to the glassy surface and need the touchscreen to have the necessary support for active digitizers for good palm rejection to work and for enough accuracy for handwriting. </s>
<s> Then you are going to re-discover the truth about this one. </s>
<s> Hopefully you don't get too upset later. </s>
<s> It's odd to see you write about handwriting recognition. </s>
<s> That is, since when was it a digitizer issue? </s>
<s> Or palm rejection? </s>
<s> You seem to write as if you are new to all this. </s>
<s> I fear you would buy such a thing and then write blogs or facebook how bad it is. </s>
<s> Avoid all this and get out there and use these things. </s>
<s> Then you will find out exactly why I have written the above. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The usual Google Nexus 7, Transformer tf300t with dock, other pads. </s>
<s> And the office plunked down an Asus x202e but not one would be my idea of what would be needed to meet your requirement. </s>
<s> None have the 16 hour battery time we need to begin and not one has progressed to the point I would call handwriting to text conversion worthy of use. </s>
<s> Notetaking? </s>
<s> Sure. </s>
<s> But unless you are doing this, you may be seeing the promises and not the reality. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't want it to try to recognize my handwriting and convert it to text. </s>
<s> I want it to keep it the way it is, but I need it to follow the pen more closely than a passive stylus would. </s>
<s> I expect it to be difficult to adjust to and have imperfect accuracy, but I also expect it to be usable for a first timer like myself. </s>
<s> I don't see where you're going with this. </s>
<s> I have a budget of $900 for the hybrid plus accessories, which is why I'm looking at the atom based ones. </s>
<s> I don't need 16 hours, but if I did, I'd stick to the asus vivotab TF810C plus keyboard dock or the latitude 10 plus 4 cell battery. </s>
<s> I didn't mention text conversion at all. </s>
<s> Atom based windows hybrid, not android </s>
<s> It appears you are going to learn this the hard way. </s>
<s> Good hunting and come back in a few months with your experiences. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> 16 hours. </s>
<s> I thought I covered why you need that. </s>
<s> In just a year with these 300 cycle batteries, you will have to replace the battery to keep that 8 hour usage per charge. </s>
<s> I had hoped this simple explanation would suffice. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> &quot;text conversion&quot; is what you noted about. </s>
<s> Here's what you wrote -&gt; &quot;writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus.&quot; How else would one highlight a paragraph unless the app converted your writing into text? </s>
<s> --&gt; I have these things and have encountered too many students that thought all this was good to go. </s>
<s> Well, the good to go part must be vendors and industry willing to take your money. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My reply was to share what we have at the office on hand beyond the others that have come and gone. </s>
<s> I meant writing out my math as one thing and highlighting in digital textbooks as another. </s>
<s> Writing out my math requires my authentic handwriting to prove it's my work. </s>
<s> I don't think it could recognize my poor handwriting anyways . </s>
<s> I only need to have 7 hours for one school year. </s>
<s> Afterwards, I won't need that much. </s>
<s> If it halves in 2 years, then it quarters in a year. </s>
<s> one school year is about 2/3 of a year, and 2/3 of 1/4 is 1/6. </s>
<s> 5/6 of 9 hours is 7.5 hours On a full charge, the samsung ativ 500t would reach 6.7% of it's usable capacity at the end of the last day of high school. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/computers-accessories/dp/B0098O9TB0 I don't see any user access to the battery so my bet is that it's a return to factory as you wear out the battery. </s>
<s> -&gt; About digitizer accuracy. </s>
<s> I find in all the models with the usual touch sensor (AKA capacitive) that a stylus works best and we have to write larger and shrink it later. </s>
<s> Again, I am doing this but it appears you have yet to use these products. </s>
<s> So here is how I would write on almost any of the usual tablets. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Grab the stylus. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Start the app (natch.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Get to where I need to write. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Write at about 2 times the size I want and then use the note taking app's feature to shrink it to the good looking normal size. </s>
<s> Only those that have not used these devices would think they could write as if they were on college ruled paper. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The software available today is still not good enough to handle perfect conversion of written text or speech into a word document. </s>
<s> I have always tried to find a good program out there and have yet to stumble across one. </s>
<s> I recently purchased Mac Speech Scribe and paid $150 for the latest version and it is still no good. </s>
<s> It skips words and just cant grab ahold of what I am saying, even when I do annunciate. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions of software they know works well and doesn't run into the same problems everyone has? </s>
<s> I feel like I would have known by now if there was, but if anyone has suggestions, please share. </s>

<s> As I previously stated in reply to R. Proffitt, I don't need or want to convert anything to digital text. </s>
<s> Being able to use an active digitizer requires more than the regular capacitive touchscreen. </s>
<s> It also needs to have inductive input. </s>
<s> That's the deal with the different kinds of digitizer pens. </s>
<s> For example, the dell xps 12 can use a digitizer but not an active digitizer because it only has capacitive input. </s>
<s> But you've lost me here. </s>
<s> Keep in mind I've been around since the GE 210 and was part of a company that made a few light pens decades ago. </s>
<s> To me, any device that translates position into some x, y and possibly z coordinates is in fact a digitizer. </s>
<s> Now with that out of the way I think you are asking what resolution these digitizers have. </s>
<s> My answer is they are poor for drawing and do slightly better with a stylus. </s>
<s> The Samsung S Note uses the active pen as well as the Activ PC. </s>
<s> You want to use a stylus so be sure to go for models that have such. </s>
<s> This doesn't cure the other issues that will come back to haunt you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'd budget a new battery in a few years but with the S pen, it probably will do what you want. </s>
<s> You've helped a lot with your information. </s>
<s> I've decided that I still need the trackpad, so I'm crossing the latitude 10 off the list. </s>
<s> Now, all I have left to decide on is whether to get the samsung ativ 500t, 9hr, for $680 total or the asus vivotab TF810C, 12hr, for $900 total. </s>
<s> If I calculate purely based on battery life, they have almost the same value/price. </s>
<s> I'm also about to order in some parts for a diy lithium ion battery pack @ 14.8V, 9.6Ah going through a car DC port and adapter for any device I choose. </s>
