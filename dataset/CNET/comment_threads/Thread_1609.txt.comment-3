Thanks for your reply.
It seems that the primary use for external drives is data backup.
USB max speed is 480 Mb/s and the sata is 3000 Mb/s.
I want to have max speed for I/O operations due to a small but very speedy SSD drive.
Most of the separate enclosures with SATA connections also have USP ports for data and/or power.
Your point is correct that the USB allows use with other slower computers but this should be available with the box hooked up USB.
