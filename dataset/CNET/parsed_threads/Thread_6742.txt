<s> A friend gave me a stick of RAM that he wasn't using anymore. </s>
<s> I would like to know how to tell if it will work in my computer. </s>
<s> My computer is a Dell Dimension 2100, running Windows ME. </s>
<s> It has one 128mb stick of RAM in it. </s>
<s> I think it uses SDRAM but I'm not positive. </s>
<s> Any help anyone can give me would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Go to Crucial.com and enter your computer model in the Crucial Memory Advisor Tool. </s>
<s> When I did that, Crucial.com says that your computer takes PC133 type memory modules. </s>
<s> Two 256MB modules equals the maximum of 512MB. </s>
<s> See if you get the same information. </s>
<s> About the stick of RAM that was given to you, what do the markings and/or stickers say on it? </s>
<s> I did get the same info on Crucial. </s>
<s> The stick has three stickers on it, this is what the one that looks most relevent says: IBM 9730 32MB 4M X 72 E 1334739JCC-10T </s>
<s> Without Google searching that info, I can tell you that looks to be a 32MB ECC module. </s>
<s> Maybe someone will have more info. </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your help! </s>
<s> I would like to ask you two more questions if that's alright. </s>
<s> The first one being, can I put that stick of memory in my computer? </s>
<s> The second, I also just received a box of old RAM for another friend and he said that he thought if the a stick of RAM had those two little notches in the bottom that they would work (the RAM that's already in my PC has the two notches). </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Thanks again for all the help! </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> Sorry for the delay in my replys, I have extremly slow dial-up. </s>
<s> If the notches match, that's a good sign. </s>
<s> Investigate (Google) each RAM module to learn its type and size. </s>
<s> I would only insert PC133 RAM modules. </s>
<s> Some PC100 modules may work in that motherboard. </s>
<s> For me, it would be worth it to try some modules in that slot. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> That is an older computer and I wouldn't care if something were to go wrong. </s>
<s> Plus, I don't invest in PC100 or PC133 RAM these days. </s>
<s> I would only upgrade that machine if I happened upon &quot;a box of old RAM.&quot; Happy hunting! </s>
