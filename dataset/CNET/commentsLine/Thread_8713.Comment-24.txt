if you go to the dollar store you can buy many colored dish cleaners that are matted and thin.these are open enough even to breathe.
they can easily be placed in front of any opening with no problem.i even use these with a covering of charcoal fiber and place in oven fan and filter fan in bathroom.
they are wonderful and thick enough to stop many small particles of stuff.
do it.
