I also have a zd8000, and there's a really easy way to tell.
If you look on the side of the computer with drive (should be the left-hand side), there should be 3 icons on the drive door.
The first one (towards the back of the computer) should be the DVD symbol, the middle one should be the CD symbol (says &quot;disc&quot;), and the one towards the front should say &quot;RW&quot;.
Underneath the very front one, it will say &quot;DVD+R DL&quot; in very small letters if you have a double-layer drive.
I believe it came standard on all zd8000's, but I'm not sure.
