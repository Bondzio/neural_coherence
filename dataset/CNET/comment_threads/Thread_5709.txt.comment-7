Bob, I know based on the published bandwidth capabilities of G band, I shouldn't have a problem - yet I was still wondering if a G Band router might choke if three computers were online at the same time on a 20 Mbit/s broadband connection.
I don't want the router to get in the way of utilizing all 20 Mbits of bandwidth.
I'm confused over Net bit rate of 54 Mbit's vs. the throughput of 19 Mbit/s.
At which point does a G band router bottleneck and slow things down?
Thanks.
