<s> In other words. </s>
<s> If my cable modem only has 50 mbps is that all I will get out of my wireless router, even if the router has a higher mbps rating/ </s>
<s> So let's add one more thing. </s>
<s> The speed from the web site or server to your router is set by the slowest link anywhere in-between. </s>
<s> It's not fun to read folk post about slow download speeds and they act surprised when this is brought up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not sure I understand your answer. </s>
<s> I have a 50 mbps router and I want to upgrade it. </s>
<s> My cable modem is only rated at 48 mbps down stream. </s>
<s> If i bought a router with say, 150 mbps, would I see and benefits or would my modem limit any benefits because it's only rated at 48mbps? </s>
<s> There's a server over somewhere and from there to your PC are a bunch of links. </s>
<s> The possible speed from that server to your machine is going to be limited by the slowest segment or link. </s>
<s> This is why, most of the time increasing the cable modem or wifi router speeds rarely improves the speed from most servers on the internet. </s>
<s> Since your router is already faster than the cable modem, the benefits are indeed muted to near zero. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> O.k. </s>
<s> I get that. </s>
<s> So in your opinion would it be helpful to upgrade both the modem and router or is the server the weakest link. </s>
<s> What I really want is more range from my router, </s>
<s> Range is limited by a few simple things (that we can't see!) </s>
<s> The power of the router, and the environment or walls and location of the router and buildings. </s>
<s> Sometimes it's interference from things like old cordless phones. </s>
<s> No maker has a stronger router signal because all have a limit imposed by the FCC (or your government.) </s>
<s> To improve range I move the wifi router to a better location. </s>
<s> Some folk ignore the basement warning and that's easy to fix the range by moving it out of the basement. </s>
<s> I've seen folk pay hundreds for such moves. </s>
<s> Here I continue to move mine for free. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Maybe a simpler example. </s>
<s> You take your PC which has a gig interface and plug it directly into the cable modem and how fast would you expect it to run. </s>
<s> The reason you would want a faster router is if you wanted to say stream video between devices INSIDE your house. </s>
<s> Since this does not pass though the modem it could run at the speed the router allows. </s>
<s> Now bobs comments are the reason it all doesn't matter. </s>
<s> Lets say you wanted to copy file from your friends pc and he only has a DSL connection that can run 384k. </s>
<s> No matter how fast your modem is you are restricted by HIS device. </s>
<s> This is true for all types of connection you just can't find out how slow or fast they run. </s>
<s> I might have noted a cheap/free booster like the following. </s>

<s> Your download speed is dictated by your ISP and the bottlenecks that Bob mentioned. </s>
<s> Period. </s>
<s> My Cisco cable modem is DOCSIS-3 and is rated at Gigabit output speed as is my D-link router. </s>
<s> My cable speed is 15 Megabits/second. </s>
<s> What do you think my download speed is? </s>
<s> My wireless N is rated at 54 Mb/s. </s>
<s> What speed do you think I get? </s>
<s> Both questions, I get 15 Mb/s on a good day, usually slower because of those accursed bottlenecks. </s>
<s> In other words, you get what your ISP provides. </s>
<s> Now, on my home network, between devices, I get blistering speeds. </s>
