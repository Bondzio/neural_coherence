1.1.1	Replaced my mobo with the exact same one that was on my system Intel desktop board D815EPEA2.	St
1.1.2	The only difference was the old mobo had onboard video and the new one needed an AGP card.	St
1.1.3	I installed a evga card e-geforce MX4000 and added a Trendnet wireless pci card.	St
1.1.4	I left the hard drive with windows xp home that was being used on the old system and 2 cd drives.	St
1.1.5	The problem is that when I turn on the system I get no video.	St
1.1.6	Nothing happens on the monitor.	St
1.1.7	I looked at an old post in April where someone had the same problem but it was inconclusive.	St
1.1.8	Would appreciate some ideas as to why this is happening.	St
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	When I have this type of problem with a clients PC, the first thing I do is to remove all expansion cards except video from the motherboard.	St
1.2.2	And then disconnect all drives from the motherboard, so the only thing you have left is memory and video card.	St
1.2.3	Make sure the drive cables are disconnected from the motherboard not just the power cables.	St
1.2.4	Then try booting the system.	Sug
1.2.5	If you get video, then try reconnecting the drives and installing the expansion cards one at a time.	Sug
1.2.6	If you don't get video, then either the video card, memory, CPU or motherboard is bad.	St
1.2.7	If you get down to the last four items, remove the battery from the motherboard or reset the BIOS with the jumper and try again.	St
1.2.8	Try removing all the memory, and see it you get a beep warning from the BIOS from the missing memory.	St
1.2.9	If there is no beep without the memory then the motherboard is the problem, if you do get the beep warning , then it is probably a bad video card.	St
1.2.10	You can also remove the CPU from the motherboard and power on the system for a few seconds to reset the motherboard, sometimes the CPU and motherboard get out of synch and doing this resets them.	St
1.2.11	Hope this gives you some ideas about what to try.	St
1.3.1	If you can't boot , how did you install the video drivers for the card?	Ques
1.3.2	Paul	St
