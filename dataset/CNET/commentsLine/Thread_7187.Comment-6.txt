is standardized (5.2v, 500 ma, that's 2.6w).
so any device suitable for usb power shouldn't have blown the power supply (that's 30w or 40w for the netbook), especially if you dimmed the screen to have that use less power.
maybe they were defective and something short-circuited?
is there anything in the documentation from acer about maximum power the usb can safely deliver?
if not, that's the question to ask their customer service.
then you have the specs for your speakerset.
however, the usb power of a laptop generally is less than the usb power of a desktop, especially when they run on battery, making usb powered speakers definitely not the first choice.
as i said, any externally powered speakerset should be ok. kees
