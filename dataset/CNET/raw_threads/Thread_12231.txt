M4 Motherboard w/ 8x AGP and 800Mhz BUS P4 3.06Ghz 800Mhz 2 x 512 DDR266 Sapphire Radeon 256MB 9600XT 480W Thermaltech Silent Power After pretty much rebuilding my comp, I notice that for some reason that whenever the computer is doing any sort of action, the fans sort of slow down and then go back... I didn't pay much attention to it until I tested my system w/ 3d Mark 03... It really chugged at some points (ie, CPU testing) , and I ended up getting only around 3000 Marks. I checked out a similar system in the database yet with only half the ram scored 5000+. Is there something wrong with the processor, and if so how can I fix it?

In the PC design, this is a &quot;bulk&quot; power supply and will vary more than a few percent. The human perception level of change is about 2 percent. When the +12V current draw increases the fans may spin down some RPMs since the bulk power supply voltage can drop. This is by design and not a performance consideration. But new designs are going to have to be made since such variences cause support calls. In closing, the fan variences are not to be fixed. Bob

I do embedded electronics and use PCs to do some test and control. I read your post and can't see any item to stick out like a sore thumb. But how about the usual? 1. Is the machine free from all parasites? 2. Can you detail what's in the machine? 3. Is the BIOS current? Bob

I don't know a whole bunch about this sort of thing but could it just be a bunch of those annoying programs that you pick up from the web(I forgot the single word name but those programs like wildtangent) or could you have a virus that is running on the computer and pulling down your performance. i dont know just speaking my mind
