I bought this video card: NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 420 for my computer to support all my pc games.
I have never had a problem until now.
When I installed Call of Duty 2, I got an error message that my video card did not support alpha blending, which was strange to me because I have two other Call of Duty games as well as many other pc games that never gave me a problem.
I looked at the NVIDIA web site to see about downloading an update, but I'm nervous about picking the correct one.
Can anybody tell me which download is the right one?
