<s> I have an Olevia 27 inch monitor/TV. </s>
<s> I have it connected to my HP Media Center m7360n via the VGA connection and it works perfectly well. </s>
<s> On Black Friday I decided to get a bigger monitor/TV but I am cheap, so I bought the Emerson 32 inch that Wal-Mart had on sale for $388, and then gave my old TV to my roommate. </s>
<s> I thought I was getting a good deal, however, now, maybe not. </s>
<s> The problem is my PC has no HDMI port and the new TV has no VGA port. </s>
<s> I tried connecting them using RCA cables with no luck. </s>
<s> I think that problem lies with the PC as the DVD player connected to the new TV with no problem. </s>
<s> My question is, do I have to buy a new computer with an HDMI slot, or is it possible to upgrade my existing computer? </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Here is my suggestion, just get a VGA to HDMI cable and hook it up and you should be good.They are only like $6.00 so it isn't a pricey fix,just run to fry's or get on online.I hope this helps. </s>
<s> I've never done this with VGA to HDMI to a TV, but I did this with a DVI to VGA to a regular monitor. </s>
<s> Two possible fixes. </s>
<s> Find an adapter that matches your needs(the cheap fix) or buy a new video card. </s>
<s> If video card, you need to disable the on-board video, install new card with required ports and s/w to finish install. </s>
<s> Being a media center system may complicate things, IMHO. </s>
<s> Of course you can google away for others that may have fixed a similar issue. </s>
<s> Believe me, this HD TV stuff is getting popular BUT attaching to old systems can be a NO GO w/o added attention or expense. </s>
