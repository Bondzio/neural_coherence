shows vtx not to be a solid yes.
i won't detail what this cpu feature is but it is growing in importance to many.
shows a solid yes to vtx and given the higher clock rate i could safely bet that for almost every use this would outperform the older q8300.
but if you could get the old gear for cheap, it's still a great choice if the price is right.
