amd is coming up with its fusion technology that combine cpu and gpu technology to create what we call apu (acclelerated processor unit).
amd is the first to fuse graphics and central processing units in one single chip.
graphics will be much speedier because graphics will lockstep with central processor instead of relying on slower memory speed.
just check it out at  for more information and which model that will comes with fusion chips and where to buy them.
intel is dominant in integrated graphic market where graphics chips are soldered on motherboards to make it integrated and connected to whatever ram modules you have be it ddr, ddr2, or ddr3.
it is not as fast as amd fusion chips .
you can still add graphics cards to amd fusion to boost graphics performance even further.
i read that the fusion chips will use ati 42** circuitry which is pretty recent.
amd bought ati graphics in 2005 so to unite both technologies in one single cpu or so called apu.
integrated graphics is not found inside cpus but in its own separate chip on the motherboard.
amd fusion chips will not need any integrated graphics chips on the motherboard as graphics circuitry will be fused with central processing circuitry on the same clock.
ddr3 memory is not as fast as central processing clock so that is why amd fusion chips promises to be very exciting for the masses with limited funds to buy the most bang for the buck!
learn all you can about the coming amd fusion chips just around the corner.
