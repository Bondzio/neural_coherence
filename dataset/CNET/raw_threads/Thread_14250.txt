I think i have fried my motherboard, there is no power getting to my PC. I was tying to install my geforce graphics into my IMEDIA x2416 and i got fustrated and pulled a wire out from something which i assumed might be the integrated graphics card (it was a silver box which is not the hard dive, maybe it was the memory im not sure). I tried to turn off the computer but the fans and stuff started going faster and then the computer went off. Now it wont turn on. Im asssuming too much power has went to the other components and has short circuited the motherboard. Would i be right in assuming this? Will i have to buy a new motherboard or can i get it fixed?? I think IMEDIAs have a denver 11 motherboard. Please help and advise, thanks. P.S Im computer illiterate as you can tell so now jargon plz.

Can i not test it myself to see whats wrong, i heard one way is to replace each component with a working one and see what component is broke. But i dont have spare components so is there another way?

I got this problem sorted so just want to let you know what happened in case it happeneds to any of you and your PC goes dead. While i was investigating and talking to some tech guys they told me i should do 3 things before i take it into the store (because thats what they do first when they get it) 1. Change the fuse in the plug 2. Plug it into a different socket 3. Take the cables out and hold in the power button for 10-15secs (this flushes out any static) Turns out i hadnt fried my motherboard at all as i suspected but after doing step one i realised i add just blown the fuse. Problem solved. Maybe you wanna pass this advice onto any noobies with the same problem.
