<s> I have a Dell PC that I bought at a closing down sale and only cost $1200. </s>
<s> Problem I have is that the digital cable I had to connect it to the monitor (came with pc) does not fit the back of the pc. </s>
<s> This cable was already connected to the back of the monitor, and both ends of this cable are identical, and have a symbol that is identical to the symbol on the port on the PC. </s>
<s> This symbol is the same as my sisters cable, but in her PC, she has a slightly different port. </s>
<s> It's the same as in the back of her monitor. </s>
<s> My problem is, even though the symbol is the same, is this a digital cable or not? </s>
<s> I can't get the cable to fit it. </s>
<s> Thankyou all. </s>
<s> See this link -&gt; http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_Digital_Visual_Interface_DVI_Bus.html Harumph! </s>
<s> That shows at least four DVI connections and I've seen at least one other with a cross instead of a bar in the C1, C2, C3 and C4 area. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info, but I found exactly the same thing in my search. </s>
<s> Problem is, my connection in the PC is different; I don't have the bar bit. </s>
<s> Just three rows across the connection, with one hole missing on the bottom row, 3 from the edge. </s>
<s> Still, it has the Digital symbol on face, so it must be a digital connection. </s>
<s> Right? </s>
<s> I'm confused. </s>
<s> As you can tell there are varieties to the DVI connection which can be all analog. </s>
<s> To solve this puzzle you have to figure out what video card you have and your monitor's capabilities and get the right cable. </s>
<s> However this information is missing so all we can do is look at the issue. </s>
