One way to find out is to issue these commands Hit START then RUN and type COMMAND and hit enter At the black screen type DEBUG and hit enter then type -d c000:0 -d -d Way out to the right it will show text that will probably tell you what video card type you have plugged in. type -Q to exit Debug. Type exit and hit enter to close the window

I did the debug at the msdos prompt & found out it is a standard IBM VGA compatible Monitor. Looked in the drivers listed in the ME software & it doesnt seem to be there. The Videocard is built onto the Motherboard & so I cannot remove it & re-install. The screen size will not move off 480x460 size wise & the colours are still 16 only... HELP

You might try using the reinstall CD to get drivers installed under &quot;repair&quot;.... sometimes works, sometimes not.
