<s> Hi I'm looking at monitors around 23&quot; and don't want something over $200. </s>
<s> I found 2 asus monitors that i think would be good. </s>
<s> Can someone give me an opinion as to which one you would choose or perhaps another option? </s>
<s> I'm studying 3d modeling and i need a good screen with accurate colors. </s>

<s> I'd go with the VH236H. </s>
<s> I would prefer the LED backlight offered in the other but it doesn't show having a DVI port and I want that capability. </s>
<s> As well, the ML238H specifies a glossy black cabinet. </s>
<s> I think the VH236H looks glossy too but the bezel is smaller. </s>
<s> To me, gloss is a distraction to the eye as it creates reflections. </s>
<s> The price of either isn't bad. </s>
<s> If you can live with D-sub and HDMI only and don't mind the glare and larger bezel, an LED backlight has some appeal. </s>
<s> I guess that's a non answer but I'd recommend that you look closely at the features each offers. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I think the Asus ML238H is slightly better hardware wise between LED backlight, which will also help provide better contrast for purer whites and deeper blacks, tilt and swivel stand, and it uses almost half the power of the VH236H, helping a tiny bit on your electric bill. </s>
<s> That said, the lack of a DVI port annoys me on general principle, but f your only using 1 monitor and have a HDMI connection then dont worry about it. </s>
<s> I also GREATLY prefer the appearance of the VH236H and am actually using a VE246H right now. </s>
<s> The &quot;border&quot; around the screen is the same size on each side, not larger on the bottom like this one... </s>
<s> I just dont like its appearance. </s>
<s> All that said, you realize newegg has &quot;Deactivated&quot; the ML238H on their site, meaning it is not simply on backorder, but doubtful they will ever have any to sell again. </s>
<s> The VH236H is on backorder and you might need to wait a month but at least it looks like they still CARRY it. </s>
