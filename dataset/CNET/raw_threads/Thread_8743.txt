I'd try this one. http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/chipsets/k8-series/k8m800/ (about chipset) http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=420&OSID=1&CatID=1070 (first item) Then again, the device could be a dud.

At very least you should have a device with a splat next to it. The splats are usually driver problems. If you do find a splat delete it(or them) and reboot your machine. This can be caused by older devices causing IRQ conflicts. Installing new devices seems to aggrevate the issue and new devices just don't work for some reason even though they are PNP. Joe Fox
