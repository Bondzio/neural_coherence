The big time avid gamers use it, however they are students of the subject and buy all of the needed protection devices and are willing to accept losing a CPU along the way to acheive a few more FPS.
For a simple CPU slight clock speed increase, you will never detect any process improvement.
A lot of o'clocking novices do not realize that as they increase the memory bus speed the PCI bus and the AGP bus increase their speed proportionately.
Thus any device plugged into those slots may not respond kindly to the higher speed.
Tis not a simple subject.
