As a television, the picture was great.
And pictures--such as desktop backgrounds--show up pretty well.
It's just text and gaming that are awful.
My boyfriend kept telling me that the resolution was something like 1300 x 700, but I just checked it and it's 1024 x 768 right now.
Another strange thing about the resolution is that if you go any higher than 1024 x 768, the desktop doesn't adjust to fit the screen.
Instead, you would have to move the mouse toward one of the edges of the screen and it will scroll to show you the whole image.
