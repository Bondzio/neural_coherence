I've run my AV software normally and in safe mode several times, to no avail, and I also just noticed Windows Media Player won't open.
I reinstalled the program itself, but no change.
Drives slowing my PC to a standstill, AV software not operating as usual, programs not functioning at all...got to be a virus of some sort, but how do I get rid of it if my AV software won't catch it?
Thanks!
