for a desktop there is absolutely no other choice than hand building.
in most instances its cheaper.
not to mention i am putting exactly what i want into my system, no bulkware, no bloatware, i can overclock, change components and get a case with room to expand.
all without worrying about voiding a warranty.
unless you absolutely positively can't fathom building your own system, its something where once you do it once, you never buy oem again.
