Like you, I wanted to be able play all the music stored on my PC through my stereo.
After much research (I did try the D-link product you have...it was crap), I found something called a Squeezebox by Slim Devices (go to slimdevices.com).
While you cannot play your music through Windows Media or iTunes, it does have their own software which gets the job done (and they are constantly updating it to add more features).
I have used it for a year now with great success.
