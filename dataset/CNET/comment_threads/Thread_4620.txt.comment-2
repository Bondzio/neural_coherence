- What's your OS?
- What's the joystick model number?
- Did the joystick come with a CD, and what did you do with it?
- Are you sure you followed the exact installation instructions?
- What exactly is the error message (full text, without typos like &quot;executible&quot; - I suppose it's a typo) and when does it appear?
