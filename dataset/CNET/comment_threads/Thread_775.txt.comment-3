keeping track of amd's family is a moving question since they're always introducing something to compete in the low-mid range.
if you're not interested in high-end performance, just go by price since they're very competitive in their price range.
personally, i'd go with a phenom x4 to get the extra cores at only a little more cost and 90% of most users, they're more than sufficent.
