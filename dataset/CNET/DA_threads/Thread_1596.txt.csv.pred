1.1.1	Hey guys.	St
1.1.2	Thanks to all that replied to my post ''Where to buy a PC...Circuit City or Best Buy''.	St
1.1.3	In it, I asked about the in store service plans offered by both stores but no one commented on that aspect of the posting.	St
1.1.4	Personally, I never buy those extended service plans they always try to push but since I've heard so many bad things about tech support from many of the leading PC manufacturers I was considering buying an in-store protection plan.	St
1.1.5	However, after finding this website, http://www.retailworker.com/node/7273?from=0&comments_per_page=10 where a bunch of sales people, mostly from Circuit City, talk about how useless the Cityadvantage Service plan is, I'm thinking maybe I should pass.	St
1.1.6	The one thing I liked about HP was that their warranty (1 yr parts/labor) could be extended at anytime within the first year.	St
1.1.7	I think with CC and BB you have to buy their plans at the time you buy the pc, even though most of the coverage doesn't kick in until after the manufacturers warranty expires.	St
1.1.8	I'll have to see if Gateway offers the same option to extend the warranty like HP does.	Ques
1.1.9	From what I've read, most things covered under the manufacturers warranty will happen within the first year anyway so an extended warranty may just be a waste of money.	St
1.1.10	I figure that if I have more than one major problem in the first year than maybe extending the warranty might be a good move.	St
1.1.11	I purchased the 2 year x-warranty for my Dell and can't remember ever using it even once and my Dell is about 5 years old and still running.	St
1.2.1	i think the 7 day return policy from the store is enough.	St
1.2.2	if something wrong happens within those 7 days, just return it and exchange for a different one.	St
1.2.3	went i got mine from bb, i left it on those 7 days w/o shutting it down to make sure that any problems possable would occur within the return.	St
1.2.4	i believe that the 1 year warranty is enough and the store warranty is just for money.	St
1.2.5	i've never used any of the warrantys on any of the pc's in my house let alone i never bought the store ones, so i saved myself money.	St
1.2.6	konny	St
1.3.1	Personally, I never purchase extended warrenties for technology.	St
1.3.2	The way I see it, most problems will show themselves within the first month or so if there are any defects.	St
1.3.3	During the first year they provide you with free support with any problems you may occur...even if you just need help performing a task.	St
1.3.4	(I never buy a product with less than a 1-year warrenty, as that's usually a sign that they don't expect their product to last long.)	St
1.3.5	After the first year, it's not common when a major problem occurs, so it's best not to waste the money on an extended warrenty.	St
1.3.6	Then, if something does go wrong, I take it as a sign that it's time to upgrade, assuming I hadn't already.	St
1.3.7	For instance, a little over a year from now, just after the warrenty on your computer expires, the standard would be a dual-core processor, Windows Vista, etc, meaning you're computer's obsolete when compared to computers in the same price/performance bracket.	St
1.3.8	Thus, if you're a geek, you'll probably be upgrading or buying/building a new computer.	St
1.3.9	However, for the ''average'' user, it is a nice security blanket, which assures them that they won't have to worry about the computer for X number of years.	St
1.3.10	The lack of technical experience (and friends with such) and the desire to keep the same computer for several years without worry usually dictates whether or not an extended warrenty is purchased.	St
1.3.11	Now, for furniture, I always pay for an extended warrenty from the store.	St
1.3.12	Over the course of a few years, I see several computers come and go, but each one is cradeled by the same computer desk.	St
1.3.13	Each new TV sees the same couch get pelted with food when my favorite teams lose.	St
1.3.14	Face it, furniture is a much better value, for it doesn't become obsolete or broken down nearly as fast as technology.	St
1.3.15	Thus, an extended warrenty is well worth it.	St
1.3.16	Hope this helps, John	St
1.4.1	When it comes to desktop systems, the choice is really up to you.	St
1.4.2	Having dealt with x-number of various users over the years, some truly need help in the worst way while others can do without.	St
1.4.3	So, you know better than anyone else where you fit in this spectum of users.	St
1.4.4	IMHO, most don't need the extended warranty for a desktop.	St
1.4.5	BUT, for a laptop I truly believe you really need it.	St
1.4.6	The costs and the special componets that make-up a laptop aren't that generic and tend to be costy and hard to get.	St
1.4.7	Plus, all too often the user may cause extra problems fixing the orginal one.	St
1.4.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	I just don't think their plans are worth it, First, Very expensive, Next, In BestBuys case, The service is horrible, I know of a couple of people that got &quot;service&quot; from Bestbuy, Took 1-2 weeks to get their computer back and the original problem still existed.	St
1.5.2	A guy from work took his back 3 times and bestbuy didn't fix the problem, He finally threatened a lawsuit and they gave him a new computer.	St
1.5.3	IMO for the price of the extended plan, You can easily replace any part that goes out on your own.	St
1.5.4	(If you feel comfortable doing so).	St
1.6.1	I think these &quot;plans&quot; are just a way to rip you off.	St
1.6.2	Usually if there is a problem, I just fix it myself because it is more of a hassle to deal with tech support, in-store or not.	St
1.6.3	Hey, if you run into a computer issue, just post it on cnet.	St
1.6.4	You'll get better results.	St
1.7.1	Here's what you guys are missing.	St
1.7.2	1.	St
1.7.3	Best Buy or CC does not offer &quot;Extended Warranties,&quot; because they don't extend the worthless limited defects only warranty from the manufacturer's.	St
1.7.4	They provide service on everything except flood, theft, abuse, & software.	St
1.7.5	The manufacturer doesn't cover heat damage due to usage, or anything else that is wrong due to just using your computer.	St
1.7.6	&quot;Defects only&quot; means it has to be the company's fault.	St
1.7.7	2.	St
1.7.8	If you have a problem with it being gone for a week or two, then purchase the in-home version, because they don't get sent to the service center where the store's don't even touch it.	St
1.7.9	Honestly, it gets sent off and the store doesn't have any choice in how it's fixed.	St
1.7.10	3.	St
1.7.11	It's not a rip off, of course the stores makes money on them, they make money on everything they sell.	St
1.7.12	How else could a store stay in business?	St
1.7.13	The biggest benefit to them is for the proprietary parts.	St
1.7.14	I can fix my own computer, but I'm not going to jimmy-rig anything.	St
1.7.15	I want the correct part and I don't want to pay jacked up prices from the manufacturer or spend time on eBay trying to make sure I don't get ripped off.	St
1.7.16	Of course people are going to have some trouble with the service plans.	St
1.7.17	Nobody's perfect and there are tons of these stores and millions of people who dealt with them.	St
1.7.18	I've had nothing but good use out of Service Plans from these stores.	St
1.7.19	Go your own way, but don't listen to everybody on here, because there are plenty of advantages to those plans.	St
1.7.20	Learn everything you can about them and make up your own mind.	St
1.8.1	I've worked at Best Buy and Circuit City in the repair department, and I have to say that the service plans (not extended warranties) are good on some items, and not worth it on others.	St
1.8.2	Laptops are one of those items thats a no brainer to get it on, especially with the battery replacement that is available, I've gotten a new battery every year, where if I were to buy it online for my model it was $230 per battery + s&h.	St
1.8.3	As quality of work at BestBuy, depends on who touches it, best buy has over 2000 instore geeksquad agents, and I can swear that the majority of them our good techs, but i have met one or two bad apples, and trust me they dont stay with the company for long, b/c they do watch how many redos you get and you do get performance counselled.	St
1.8.4	And as for how long it takes, depends, on desktop, if its anything but the motherboard/processor, then it can be repaired in store, which isnt that long of a fix.	St
1.8.5	If its a desktop, they can only do memory and harddrive repair instore (alot of manf.	St
1.8.6	will not send parts, but mem and harddrives are pretty generic) (notebook harddrive repair is new for instore warranty repair at bestbuy) As far as cc quality, well they are doing a massive recruiting effor of the more experienced geeksquad agents, so I'm new to them, and the as of now, the instore pc services do not handle any of the warranty repair.	St
1.8.7	If your computers broken, you take it to customer service and they send it to the service center, I have heard that its alot faster then bestbuys service center, (bestbuy we would quote 2-8 weeks for items being shipped) at circuit they quote 1-2 weeks.	St
1.8.8	Overall, a computer is an investment, and if you want to protect your investment, then get the protection, dont hate on the sales people for pushing it down your throat, they are just trying to make a buck, (they may not get commission, but they get schedule more hours if they are more profitable)...	St
1.9.1	I'm going to be very bias here.	St
1.9.2	Circuit City, screwed me on a rebate, so I don't recommend them any more and thus don't shop there either.	St
1.9.3	Plus, from past visits wasn't impressed with the computer side, it seems like what Sears would do in sales, just not spectcular, IMHO.	St
1.9.4	But man, get into audio&video they seem to cater to the customer, odd.	St
1.9.5	Best Buy, is a big vendor here and the horror stories are at a mimium.	St
1.9.6	The usual, they couldn't do this or that but after seeing the immediate repair facilities, its no wonder.	St
1.9.7	I'm not impressed at all and they seem to hire your local &quot;teen guru&quot; tech, good or bad.	St
1.9.8	However, the return policy is generous within the 15-day period.	St
1.9.9	For both vendors, I wouldn't recommend any ext.	St
1.9.10	warranty policy, use your credit card to offer that.	St
1.9.11	But, if you get into a laptop, you should seriously consider it.	St
1.9.12	This is the only item I suggest to do so as in most cases, it gets send out and not routed internally for repairs.	St
1.9.13	But, it may take time to resolve as laptop gets send out.	St
1.9.14	Up to you, but desktops, no way.	St
1.9.15	tada -----Willy	St
1.10.1	The cold facts... CityAdvantage Plus plan (CCitys plan) -add on within 30 days of plan -cancel anytime (pro-rated) -plan starts from day 1 and covers beyond reg warranty (thats why it starts instantly,if it started the next year and you break something thats not covered incld.	St
1.10.2	in manufaturuers, your screwed) PLUS PLAN covers extra stuff (e.g.	St
1.10.3	power surge, water damage, cracked screen, dropping, ANYTHING) -ALSO ask about the extras, they usually pay for the plan: Camcorder play 54.99 2 years inclds Annual Head and dust cleanings (usually $50 done pro) We dont make commission off of it but sometimes our managers just make us hate it cause of the drive for selling it when we make no benefit.	St
1.10.4	I do like the plan and find it much cheaper than CompUSAs and relative to Best Buys minus Accidental Damage repair that ours have.	St
1.10.5	Its just frustrating when customers come in with a broken camera that sony wont fix in the first year and it costs the same for a new camera as it does to fix their screen ($189).	St
1.10.6	I usually see those people buy it the next time...	St
1.11.1	but more often than not, you're throwing money away.	St
1.11.2	Espesially if you pay for more than a year.	St
1.11.3	Every ''consumer-expert-type'' I've come across (online, in print or on TV) has alwyas said they are generally not worth the cost.	St
1.11.4	Most hardware thses days is pretty well made.	St
1.11.5	Even the cheap stuff.	St
1.11.6	If something fails or goes wrong, 90% it's going to do so within the first few months of ownership (in which case the standard manufacturer's warrenty will suffice).	St
1.11.7	Case in point: I just bought my mom a new HP monitor.	St
1.11.8	It was defective.	St
1.11.9	I contacted HP online and they shipped out a replacement via 2-day air (with a sticker to return it prepaid).	St
1.11.10	The second monitor had another defect, so we repeated the process.	St
1.11.11	So far, so good, on the third one.	St
1.11.12	Again, problems generally turn up during the warranty period.	St
1.11.13	Standard Disclaimer: YMMV	St
1.12.1	Hello!	St
1.12.2	Here is the run down on the best buy in-store performance service plan.	St
1.12.3	The price of the service plan is relative to the price of the laptop.	St
1.12.4	The service plan allows for 1 free battery replacement for each year that you have the service plan.	St
1.12.5	(Typically 3 years) As long as you say that the battery is not holding the charge that it did when you got it, you call the number on the pamphlet and they will ship you a new battery and you will turn in your old battery.	St
1.12.6	The service plan covers normal wear and tear, dust, heat, power surges, humidity, and all hardware.	St
1.12.7	The LCD screen is NOT covered which is logical, as about 90% of the cost of a laptop is the price of the screen.	St
1.12.8	If you have burnt out pixels or any other form of defect in the screen, that IS covered.	St
1.12.9	If you punch your laptop in a fit of anger, that is NOT covered.	St
1.12.10	Service plans take effect the day of purchase, NOT after the manufacturer's warranty ends.	St
1.12.11	If your laptop IS a service-able item it will be shipped to the manufacturer, repaired, and shipped back to Best Buy at no additional cost.	St
1.12.12	If your laptop is NOT a service-able item, you will receive the original amount of money paid toward a new item.	St
1.12.13	Even if the original price was 1000 and it is now 400, you will get the 1000.	St
1.12.14	With the No-Lemon policy, if (within the policy time constraint of 3 or however many years) you have any 3 problems repaired and you have a 4th problem, the item will be considered a &quot;lemon&quot; and you will be compensated with a comparable (but not better) item.	St
1.12.15	The plan also covers diagnostics as well as cleanings.	St
1.12.16	To ME, the fact that the service plan includes a new battery each year as well as power surges is reason enough to get the service plan.	St
1.12.17	If you can put together the money to get the service plan, I would recommend it...and as far as that article that you referenced, NO, I do NOT lie when selling the service plan.	St
1.12.18	I am a personal shopping assistant at BB and building a relationship with the customer is much more important to me than landing a &quot;big sale&quot;.	St
1.12.19	Best Buy is non-commissioned sales so there really is no point in lying about a service plan.	St
1.12.20	Hope that this helps!	St
1.12.21	Lindsey - LDrenckhahn@comcast.net	St
1.13.1	I also forgot to mention that at BB there is a 14 day return policy and a 15% restocking fee.	St
1.13.2	You can buy the service plan up until the 14th day of the service plan.	St
1.13.3	The restocking fee is obviously waived if there is any defect in the laptop.	St
1.13.4	I can understand why there is a 15% restocking fee, as to deter people from &quot;renting&quot; the laptops until the one they really want comes out.	St
1.14.1	You should reread your laptop battery coverage.	Ques
1.14.2	Sometime around August they changed it to 1 battery for the life of the plan.	St
1.14.3	It is no longer 1 battery per year.	St
1.15.1	Actually the Best Buy service plan covers the laptop battery, once each year for the life of the service plan.	St
1.16.1	I favor Best Buy extended service plans.	St
1.16.2	They are the cheapest in the business and there is no hassle when bringing something in for repair or exchange.	St
1.16.3	I bought a laptop from Circuit City and the service plan was twice what I could have had it for at Best Buy.	St
1.16.4	The hard drive went bad and I had to send the whole computer to their service center.	St
1.16.5	The turn around was one week.	St
1.16.6	Circuit City does not have &quot;in house&quot; service like Best Buy does.	St
1.16.7	Their sales people are not as geeky as Best Buys' either.	St
1.16.8	I've had a camera ($500) and a printer ($400) replaced over the counter At Best Buy in less than 10 min.	St
1.16.9	each time.	St
1.16.10	When I had a problem with a Canon photo printer that I had purchased at Circiut City the tech guy at the service center had me on the phone for over 1 1/2 hours trying different procedures before finally agreeing with me that it was &quot;busted&quot;.	St
1.16.11	We don't need the hassle.	St
1.16.12	Besides that, Best Buys' rebate program is a lot faster than anybody else also.	St
1.16.13	Jerry	St
1.17.1	About mid August of 2005, Best Buy changed the wording in the Service Plan brochures.	St
1.17.2	You get whatever benefits were listed in your brochure at the time of purchase.	St
1.17.3	Yes, the new brochures list that you only get one battery replacement for the life of the plan.	St
1.17.4	Also if you read closely as well, if the product is no-lemoned or is non reparable, it will be replaced with a product of COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE.	St
1.17.5	So if your laptop was $1500 when you got it but now a $500 is the most comparable, you get the $500 one, unless you want to get a nicer one, in which case you just pay the difference between the $500 one and the one you want.	St
1.17.6	As of early November 2005 Best Buy also will offer Accidental Damage protection as well that will cover drops and cracked screens.	St
1.17.7	And beleive me, on a laptop it's worth it.	St
1.18.1	As an employee at circuit city, in the computer department, i know our esps.	St
1.18.2	batteries are covered, 1 per year go for accidental, it covers if you spill break crack, etc, be careful though, they will not replace a notebook with a hammer hole in the screen	St
1.19.1	Alright Big time Discussion goingon Service Plan han!!	St
1.19.2	Well I definatley would recoment a service plan cause i have seen people coming back to Stores with their broken or not working laptop withing the time frame of 1-3 years with no money of buying a new laptop and want to get that fixed.	St
1.19.3	Definatley Best Buy service plan will Cover it they will not charge you any extra for repairing or putting any new equipment in it.	St
1.19.4	Also, i mean if you are not gona use the service plan you can get benefit from one battery that they give you in that time Frame Average Cost of a Battery about 130 Dollars.	St
1.19.5	Also, with these hurricanes coming in and we are using too much voltage at our house Surge is Covered, humadity and Dust.	St
1.19.6	Oh yeah the people who want to stick to Manfacture Warranty Do so but you might have to learn Another language cause they transfer your calls to India people who most of the time have no idea wat they are talking about oh Yeah and if you lucky enough to get somebody online .. Well if you got leaisure time wait on for 50 Mins for somebody to help you.	St
1.19.7	I recently had the same Issue with HP, Thank God i had the service plan and they fixed my laptop.	St
1.19.8	Also Best Buy Got Accidental Covergage Mandatory For Students, we know you gona Party at College and yep we know you gona Drink and will Soak Your Laptop So get Accidental Coverage As well.	St
1.19.9	Another thing is no lemon Policy that Best Buy does is After three Repairs they give you out the same money again the same amount of money for a new laptop, the Actual Price of Laptop that you bought for.	St
1.19.10	So why not , and yes the Screens are Covered for two times.	St
1.19.11	I would Definatley Recomend a servie plane .. yes its money but they Provide You Service and again if you are looking for something Cheap mannnnn then who cares .. Really if you willl stay at Ebay and search for thousand of hours to look for somthing well you even dont deserve to come to best buy.	St
1.19.12	Cause yes we make money Yes we profit why not..we should.. Alright.	St
1.19.13	I am Best Buy, and i am not on COMMISSSIIIIOOONNNNN SALES PERSON..	St
