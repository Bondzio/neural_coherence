I rececently purchased a wireless network adaptor, while I am waiting for my router to come in the mail.
But for some reason I have internet connection in my apartment.
I guess I might have connected to someone elses netowork or maybe a &quot;hot spot&quot;.
Now while I am using this network, which is not mine, can other people steal file from me?
