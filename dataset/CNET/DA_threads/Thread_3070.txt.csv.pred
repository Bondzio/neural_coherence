1.2.1	No make, model or link to the machine's manual so I'll just write &quot;BIOS setting.&quot;	St
1.3.1	As stated by Robert, you can reboot or once power is returned to system cause a reboot of that system.	St
1.3.2	However, because this is a power issue, its far better to allow it to sit out until &quot;stable power&quot; is present.	St
1.3.3	If the power is erratic or on/off as it were, repeated reboots/start-ups could corrupt the system.	St
1.3.4	I suggest you have a more protected system as in stand-by power, line conditioner and surge protection in all or varied forms.	St
1.3.5	Having this will reduce any real or reduce damage to h/w and/or reduce some s/w corruption or allow a proper shutdown at least.	St
1.3.6	If your power problems are constant than this is your best way to help yourself.	St
1.3.7	I offer this as the post you supplied provided little info.	St
