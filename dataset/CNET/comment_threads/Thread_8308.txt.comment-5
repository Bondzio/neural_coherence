yet.
The various X's of AGP cards used different voltags.
Wondering if yours used the 3.3 volts that the memory also uses.
Power Supply failure [high][ of the 3.3 volts could have damaged lots of things, including the CPU].
Hopefully the on mobo regulators for the CPU didn't let the overvoltage get to the CPU.
I'm talking as if it was the supply.
Not really intending that.
An internal supply failure could let the voltages come up but not release the Power Go signal to let the system start the boot process.
So many possibilities.
