That's not really what I was hoping to do...
I don't have dead spots or lack of connectivity...
I want to use the router as a sort of distribution point of the wireless signal... Kind of like the reverse of what it normally does.... Have it recieve the wireless signal from the main router, and then distribute it via ethernet.
