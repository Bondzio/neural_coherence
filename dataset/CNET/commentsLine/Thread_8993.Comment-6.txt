note that: -&gt; the firewall protection is only applicable if the computers are connected to the internet through that device.
otherwise, you're not protected.
-&gt; the antivirus protection from mcafee must be installed on each computer.
that will work even when your computers are not connected to that device.
-&gt; you should never disable your antivirus protection, even when connected to that device.
-&gt; you should always use a firewall...you need to install a software firewall for use when you're away from the d-link device.
