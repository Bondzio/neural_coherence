there's a server over somewhere and from there to your pc are a bunch of links.
the possible speed from that server to your machine is going to be limited by the slowest segment or link.
this is why, most of the time increasing the cable modem or wifi router speeds rarely improves the speed from most servers on the internet.
since your router is already faster than the cable modem, the benefits are indeed muted to near zero.
