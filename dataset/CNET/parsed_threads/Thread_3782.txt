<s> Hey, I got my new external HD enclosure today for my old 200 GB hdd. </s>
<s> Plugged it in the IEEE 1394 port of my laptop and I could read my old hdd. </s>
<s> I rebooted my machine with the enclosure still plugged in and powered up. </s>
<s> After restarting my laptop detects the enclosure but does not detect my hard drive any longer. </s>
<s> Just to make sure of the problem I connected another HDD and same result. </s>
<s> Any suggestions how to rectify this problem so that I can read my hard drive again Thanks, anirud@hotmail.com </s>
<s> When I see this I find the owner has &quot;loaded Windows&quot; and didn't get all the drivers. </s>

<s> Actually I tried connecting the enclosure to the USB port. </s>
<s> Same result. </s>
<s> Laptop detected the enclosure but when I double click on the new drive E it wouldnt let me access it. </s>
<s> Infact when I went to the Disk Management Tool the hdd shows up there as active and healthy and also as empty with 200 GB free. </s>
<s> Do I need to install a new set of drivers ? </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Since it now doesn't reboot, now it may be time to partition and format this drive? </s>
