this is the second time that i tried to build my own pc.
the first was a success but i am having trouble with this new motherboard.
problem: when i turn on the motherboard the cpu fan spins and so does the power supply case...but my monitor doesnt display anything!
it has a vga port that i plugged the monitor into.
does the motherboard have to be inside a computer case?
this is the same monitor that i'm using right now.
am i forgeting something?!
here is the mogherboard info:
