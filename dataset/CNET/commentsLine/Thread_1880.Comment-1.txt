hi.
i hope i don't sound like an idiot, but i just moved to a new home, transported my computer tower in my car without incident, and allowed it to remain in the car for about a half hour after arriving.
it was very cloudy and not very hot that day, so i don't think i damaged it in the move.
now when i use it for longer than 15 minutes or so i hear a repeated whirring about two seconds in duration: whir...whir...whir.
it's very annoying.
i don't have a cd or any other media in any of the drives.
the computer is about a year old, and i haven't had any other problem with it so far.
any ideas?
