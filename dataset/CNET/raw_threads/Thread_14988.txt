I want to replace MB myself for a backup box. Where can I order one and are they easy to replace? I'm handy with tools and have added memory and removed my power supply before.

As this is the case, let me share I picked up a Compaq Deskpro EN 1Ghz with 128MB RAM, 20GB HD, CDROM and onboard sound, 4MB Video, ethernet, serial, USB times 2, parallel port for under 199. I did it only because it included a Windows 2000 license which is worth about that much. What my post is abour is that you want to shop with extreme care if you want to recycle what you think is still good in that box. Bob
