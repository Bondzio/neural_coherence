New user of Serv-U program, I am trying to learn the great event system on the fly and thought I'd ask to hope some experts are around.
My goal is to have a weekly e-mail of all new uploads, top downloads, etc.
be sent out.
It is easy to set up an event to send out an e-mail on every individual upload/download, but I couldn't think of a possible combination of filters/commands that would make it occur only once a week and combine them into a single text.
Anybody have experience with this?
Or have access to it and be willing to accept the challenge to try and figure it out?
Much appreciated!
