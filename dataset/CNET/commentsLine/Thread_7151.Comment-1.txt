i want to hide everything that can be used to find the location of my internet connection.
in order to do that, i'm planning to use ultrasurf, hotspot shield, smac(or any program to change my mac address), and maybe putty.
the only problem is that i need to know how i can combine these programs.
i need to know if there is a program that can take a proxy address like ultrasurf and let me select which program will run with it.
this would be very helpful because in that way i do not to change the configuration of mozilla firefox or ie every time i use them, and it also allow me to use ultrasurf in programs that don't have an option to set up a proxy.
the program that most closely would fulfill my needs is gtunnel (  ), but for some reason did not work on windows vista and it did not shows all my programs.
do you know any program like this?
any suggestion on how to hide my location?
please, do not tell me this question is illegal because it's not.
i do not plan to do anything wrong with this.
