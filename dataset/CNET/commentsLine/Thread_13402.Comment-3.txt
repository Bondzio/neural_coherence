there has to be a place that has it ready made.
i'm not handy with wire-cutters and shrink-wrapping and splicing and dicing.
i don't want a y-splitter.
i just want a short little cable with 4 pins on either end, both female.
one end plugs into the external drive case on the inside circuit board, and the other end plugs into the power plug on the hard drive or dvd burner.
that would be simple!
where do i get such a cable?
