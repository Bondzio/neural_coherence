1.1.1	I have an IDE configured SATA HDD with Windows 7 currently running on it.	St
1.1.2	(WD Caviar 500GB) I have a twin for this disk, currently not installed.	St
1.1.3	I would like to, if possible configure these two disks so that it registers in Windows as a single disk (1TB) with one drive letter.	St
1.1.4	Any help or pointers is greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	Create an image of the disk with your operating system and software.	St
1.2.2	Use the imaging software of your choice to do this.	St
1.2.3	Make at least two copies on two different drives.	St
1.2.4	Next, install the two 500GB disks on RAID enabled ports and create the RAID-0 array.	St
1.2.5	All data will be lost on both drives during this process.	St
1.2.6	When that is completed, restore the image to the RAID array.	St
1.2.7	Windows should see it as one drive.	St
1.2.8	With a little luck, Windows will be happy.	St
1.2.9	What you'd want to do beforehand, however, is to enable RAID for the ports you plan to use and make sure drivers are installed.	St
1.2.10	Good luck	Polite
1.3.1	Could I use Acronis Disk Director to copy disk to an external?	St
1.3.2	and then what do I do install both drives and then set it u via the bios?	St
1.3.3	Also how do I restore the system copy from the external at that point.	St
1.3.4	I am pretty nervous.	St
1.3.5	Also how do I find If I have the right drivers installed?	Ques
1.3.6	and wouldn't those be on the motherboard?	St
1.3.7	Thanks.	St
1.4.1	If you use Acronis, you use their True Image product.	St
1.4.2	Disk Director deals mostly with partitioning.	St
1.4.3	You could use Acronis True Image to create a full backup image of your existing drive but you'd want to be sure that the restoration process would go smoothly.	St
1.4.4	You'd be moving to RAID-0 which means Windows needs the RAID drivers that go with your motherboard.	St
1.4.5	Those should come on the CD.	Sug
1.4.6	You'd need to enable the ports you want to use for RAID and let Windows detect the change so you could get the drivers in place.	St
1.4.7	Then you'd create the disk image.	St
1.4.8	Next you'd connect the two drives to the RAID designated ports and boot into the RAID bios to configure the drives.	St
1.4.9	You'll be asked which drives to use and the two should already show.	St
1.4.10	You'll be asked whether RAID-1 or RAID-0 but it may not be phrased that way.	St
1.4.11	You select RAID-0.	St
1.4.12	It may say &quot;performance&quot; and not mirror.	St
1.4.13	Once done, you let the BIOS configure the array and all data will be lost on your old drive.	St
1.4.14	Once the array is created, You boot from the Acronis disk while the HD with the image you created is present on another HD.	St
1.4.15	It could be an external.	St
1.4.16	You have Acronis restore the entire image to the RAID array and you may alter the size of the partition at this time.	St
1.4.17	Once done, you remove the Acronis disk and restart the PC.	St
1.4.18	You re-enter the BIOS and set the RAID array as the first HD in the boot sequence.	St
1.4.19	Cross your fingers and restart.	St
1.4.20	If all goes well, you're golden.	St
1.4.21	If not, you troubleshoot.	St
1.4.22	Personally, I don't recommend doing this.	St
1.4.23	You're going to need a good backup plan.	St
1.4.24	The array will eventually fail.	St
1.4.25	It's not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;.	St
1.4.26	You do want to be sure the HDs you use are specified for RAID use.	St
1.4.27	Some newer drives have sophisticated re-alignment cycles that cause problems with RAID.	St
1.4.28	You're on your own.	St
1.4.29	Good luck.	St
1.5.1	Yeah I will have to get True Image.	St
1.5.2	and as far as the driver disk goes...Um thats in the garbage.	St
1.5.3	I got this tower from my moms boss, which was originally configured for RAID 0 and they wanted to wipe the drives so I had put an 3.5 in it until they gave me the drives back.	St
1.5.4	Then I used crummy easus disk copy to get it on one of the original disks, then I decided to shoot for RAID.	St
1.5.5	I know I painted myself into a corner.	St
1.5.6	LOL.	St
1.5.7	These two drives were originally manufactured for RAID.	St
1.5.8	Yeah I do alot of that.....&quot;Cross your fingers and restart.&quot; Thanks dude.	St
1.5.9	You cleared a lot up for me.	St
