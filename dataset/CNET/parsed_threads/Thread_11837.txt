<s> In my LAN, there are couple computers, all running windows xp, i want to share internet and priter together. </s>
<s> but want to share my folder within specific computer only, and don't allow other pc to access it. </s>
<s> anyone get the answer please help me! </s>
<s> thank in advance </s>
<s> You want to share a folder but you don't want to share a folder. </s>
<s> What have I missed? </s>
<s> i mean i only want to share my folder some computers in my LAN not to all computers in the LAN!! </s>
<s> for example, in my LAN there are 4 PCs: A, B, C, D. I want to share PC A's folder that let B and C PC to access it, and don't allow PC D to access that folder. </s>
<s> MS's article on the subject of file sharing in XP.... http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;304040 Basically you would turn off Simple File Sharing on the View tab of Windows Explorer's Tools menu. </s>
<s> Then you can set the permissions for each individual folder's sharing properties by right clicking and choosing Sharing and Security. </s>
<s> but I'm trying to work out how I can set permissions on my folders so only certain PC's can access certain folders, is this possible? </s>
<s> I have turned off simple sharing, and I can still access the folders from the PC I don't it to access.... i have been told that MAC address filtering can do what i say above, is it right? </s>
<s> and can u tell me how to make MAC address filtering? </s>
<s> and another alternative way is to use the Windows Firewall to block off the file and print sharing service except from the IP addresses of my machines, is it true? </s>
<s> and how can configure window firewall? </s>
