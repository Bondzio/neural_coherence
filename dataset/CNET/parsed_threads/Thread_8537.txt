<s> Ok guys um I have a HP Pavilion 6645c series comp. </s>
<s> Its 5 years old now and I think my HD is failing now. </s>
<s> My comp is now freezeing with regulatory time. </s>
<s> Problem is I have to buy Windos XP if I buy a new HD. </s>
<s> But what im wondering most about is what HD is perfect for this comp? </s>
<s> If you know post it. </s>
<s> The motherboard is a Cognac, don't ask me I can't find anything about this motherboard, well from the company that made it. </s>
<s> I have a Intel Celeron 566MHZ processor, 15GB HD, with Win98. </s>
<s> I have 384MB RAM, and a 64MB Nvidia graphics card. </s>
<s> Are you getting error messages related to corrupt data or bad sectors? </s>
<s> Lots of things can cause freeze ups besides HD issues. </s>
<s> And, why must you get XP if you replace the drive? </s>
<s> That system is a bit thin on hardware resoures to run XP well. </s>
<s> You can still buy drives of 40 gigs readily and 20s are available. </s>
<s> Your PC, at 5 years, will probably handle a 40 gig drive but might not use the full burst speed of it. </s>
<s> WD, Seagate, Maxtor and such are plentiful and any should work ok with your system. </s>
<s> As for freezing, it's fairly simple to do some basic cleaning and maintenance. </s>
<s> Get the dust out of the fans, reseat boards and RAM modules, and do the usual disk maintenance and spyware removal. </s>
<s> If that doesn't help, your power supply might be getting weaker. </s>
<s> Make sure its fan and insides get a good blast of compressed air as well. </s>
<s> Also, give the system a good scan for viruses and spyware. </s>
<s> Recover your Windows 98 product key if you need it for a Windows XP upgrade version. </s>
<s> It is good to have the product key, just in case.... http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html </s>
