i am okay about that part.
what about formatting the drive i am adding?
i would like to erase all the info on the drive.
possibly install windows 98 on it.
would i do this in disk managrment?
will the drive automatically be assigned a drive letter when i reboot?
will it change the drive letters of my other drives?
that may affect the file paths of things that are already in my computer.
my new drive uses cable select.
