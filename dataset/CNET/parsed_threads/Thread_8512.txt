<s> Hello: From what I can tell, computer headsets bifurcate at the ends, leaving one cable for the audio jack and one for the stereo jack. </s>
<s> This is fine when you are using a laptop and have both jacks literally right at your finger tips. </s>
<s> But what happens when you are using a desktop? </s>
<s> My tower isn't real close to where I sit and I question whether the cable would stretch that far. </s>
<s> Further complicating matters is that I have PC speakers plugged into one of the stereo jacks on the back of the tower. </s>
<s> As a result, I have two small speakers next to my monitor and when I want to use headphones I just plug the headphones directly into the speakers as opposed to the back of the computer. </s>
<s> So what can I do to resolve this issue. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
