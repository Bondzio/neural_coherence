Here are a couple links that may help to identify the motherboard pins on a standard Intel USB pin header: http://www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_USB.htm http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-009048.htm Note that you should see a small '1' on your motherboard next to pin #1 of the USB pin header. This gives you a starting point to identify what numbers the other pins have as their designation. Caution: That 2x6 plug doesn't sound right for USB. Are you sure it's not 2x5? Can you provide the case manufacturer name and model number?
