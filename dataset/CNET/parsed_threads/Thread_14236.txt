<s> I just built my first pc. </s>
<s> its been running for a week now and the temprature is running around 100F to 104F. </s>
<s> Is this to hot? </s>
<s> Iam using a MSI K8Neo 4 Platuim mobo and a AMD Athlon64 3500 + processorer and its not been overclocked.I did have to replace heat sink and thermal compound. </s>
<s> I used stock heat sink and Shinetsu blue compoud. </s>
<s> Looks like good temp as the max is 65 or 70 degrees c and you are 37 to 40. </s>
<s> Is this temp idle or at load? </s>
