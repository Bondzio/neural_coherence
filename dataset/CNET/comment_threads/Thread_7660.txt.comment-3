Well i found out WHY!
i have no sound, need to get the CD for the sound card driver.
The guy didnt bother sending it with the Tower... Now as for graphics card, i currently have ATI RADEON X550 256mb.
My chipset is PCI-E, Now i am not an extreme gamer so i dont plan on playing games like Crysis but... i want something that will run the current games i have on high settings The Elder Scrolls Four: Oblivion, S.T.A.L.K.E.R and soon its expansion, Company of heroes, Gothic 3, and soon The Witcher.
I recently went to systemrequirementslab.com and did a scan.
Now i wouldent be typing in this box asking for someones opinion if i knew what the hell to get, hehe...
So if you would know what i can get that wont be majorly expensive!
I would appreciate it.
I also checked at all sites seeing what they recommend, But i never do trust what they have down... After 2 months it goes into the garbage
