i appreciate your reply--you have clarified some of the concerns i have about this.
i have a couple of questions: what is windows ics (i don't understand the acronym ics).
also what is a pci device?
as you can see, i am a novice at this.
also, do i attach the &quot;wireless adapter&quot; to the old computer or the new one?
and the same with this router that should come in the mail today--it connects to the modem i have,so it has to be next to the new computer, right?
thank you so much for your help!
i'm beginning to think that trying to connect my old computer to the internet isn't worth it.
thank you, rain2snow
