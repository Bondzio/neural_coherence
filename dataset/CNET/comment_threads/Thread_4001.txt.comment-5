Those are really great suggestions but i think im going to have to go with a little bit cheaper processor.
Mainly im going to be using the game for some light gaming, internet use, music and video.
My budget is yet unknown, and since im only fifteen its a little harder to get the funds but at this point i think 400-500 is what im going to be able to spend.
So i really like the suggestion but i think ill go with a 50 dollar cheaper processor.
