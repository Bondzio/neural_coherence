Will a USB/Gameport adapter work or would putting in an old PCI sound card just for the gameport work? Would this extra sound card cause more problems than it would solve? Thanks for reading Bedford

Unless you've got a whiz-bang joystick that you can't bear to part with, a new joystick would probably be a better alternative. Decent joysticks are only $15-$30. http://www.buy.com/retail/searchresults.asp?querytype=home&qu=joystick&qxt=home&dclksa=1 Gameport to USB adapters do exist, but I can't find any. Your local RadioShack might have one of these but note that a customer says is won't work with MS Sidewinders: http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2036256&cp=&kw=gameport+usb&parentPage=search Cheap ($10) sound cards do provide joystick/midi ports, but they may cause conflicts with your on-board sound and may not even be as good as your built-in audio. Better quality sound cards (worthy of replacing your on-board sound) have phased out game/midi ports in favor of digital audio ports and/or more surround sound connectors.
