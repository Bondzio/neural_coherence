Hello Guys Im having a problem with my AMD Athlon XP 3200+ It should be able to run at 2.2GHz, but at the moment its only running at 1.8GHz...
This is the manual for my motherboard: http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/socka/kt400/a7v8x-x/e1198_a7v8x-x.pdf I have 1GB or Corsair RAM, PC2700.
250HD.
BFG Tech Geforce 6800GS 256mb.
Windows XP Home.
Heres a pic of my processor info taken with CPU-Z: http://img82.imageshack.us/img82/6566/cpu4zw.jpg (Its showing as an 2500+ becuase its running at 1.8 GHz, the same speed as a 2500+) In my motherboard manual, it says that it can support upto an AMD XP 3200 so i dont know what the problem is.
Any help would be great, thanks.
Im running PC2700 RAM, My motherboard can support PC3200, but on in 2 slots.
