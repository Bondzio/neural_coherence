<s> I'm quite interested in purchasing a Desktop PC in the Slimline Form Factor, but have read some negative reviews on at least one vendor. </s>
<s> Are there any brands that you can recommend that have a history of reliable operation? </s>
<s> I'd also be interested in any other comments such as service considerations, restrictions on add-on cards, and power supply capacity. </s>
<s> Let's put it this way. </s>
<s> These are ready to use, not so ready or easy to upgrade boxes. </s>
<s> The negative reviews are often from folk that went too cheap and want to add a 3D card for gaming and then run into the usual slim case issues and limitations. </s>
<s> But we've had many over the years and they're fine for what they are. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I'm just looking for an Internet and Email PC and would probably add Microsoft Office. </s>
<s> There would be no need for video upgrades. </s>
<s> It looks like the PC does have spare card slots but I see that they are a smaller form factor. </s>
<s> Would those be half height PCI Express slots? </s>
<s> My concern is reliability, as I believe I read that some of the earlier HP Slimline PCs had motherboard failures and possibly overheating problems. </s>
<s> It appears that Acer, Lenovo, and perhaps others have joined HP in offering the Slimline PCs, so I am wondering if some brands might be more reliable than others. </s>
<s> My take is if the maker won't answer what the spare card slots are, don't buy from them. </s>
<s> As to reliability I see the drive makers are pulling back to 3 years and the machines are only 1 year warranty. </s>
<s> Yes they may last longer and they do here. </s>
<s> But then again I know how to used the CANNED AIR once a year. </s>
<s> TIP! </s>
<s> On your birthday change all your fire alarm batteries and find your canned air to clean your PC's vents. </s>
