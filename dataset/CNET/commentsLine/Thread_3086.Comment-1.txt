i have my neighbors computer that is failing to boot past the initial american megatrends screen.
she said that she was having trouble with her dialup and somehow got into the bios.
she changed two values from &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;no&quot; and now it won't get past the &quot;american megatrends tvx0619b&quot; screen.
it's a biostar mb-8500tvx-a mother board.
i have tried clearing the cmos by strapping jp4 and also removed the clock chip that also has the battery in it for 10 minutes or so.
nothing seems to help.
holding keys down on the keyboard won't force a keyboard error either.
is there any way to force it into setup this early on in the boot process or is it toast??
any help would be appreciated.
