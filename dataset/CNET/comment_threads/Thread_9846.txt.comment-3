The driver for the chipset is as from the MSI support site, version 8.521, which was posted on 9/4/08.
I just remembered this, but in the windows device manager it shows a yellow exclamation point next to a secondary ide channel (this device cannot start), but the motherboard only has a single ide channel.
It has been like that for a while, but never seemed to adversely affect the motherboard.
