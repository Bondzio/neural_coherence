<s> Here is what i need - Must be IDE - Must burn very well - Must be able to booktype - Dont really care about speed that much thanks </s>
<s> http://www.k-probe.com/bitsetting-booktype-faq.php When you see a person asking for that, you usually discover they are attempting to find a recorder that will make Video DVDs that play on all recorders. </s>
<s> -&gt; Sorry, no one has made such a drive or media. </s>
<s> In closing, I use the usual 29 to 59 dollar drives from newegg and geeks.com without ANY issues. </s>
