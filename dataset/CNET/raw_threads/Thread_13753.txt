I made sure my pictures, music, and movie files were backed up, then deleted certain ones from my computer. When trying to access a certain picture file, it isn't there. The other files are, as is my music, etc. If the EHD had been 'synced', is it possible since the files were no longer on my computer that the EHD deleted them as well? I'm using a Sony Vaio for what it's worth. Thanks.

If we explore the settings we can have the sync software delete or add among other choices. However I find many won't explore such settings for reasons I can't fathom here. But Sync software usually can do that and more. It's your choice as to the settings. -&gt; Since it's a backup copy, nothing lost. That's why we backup. Bob
