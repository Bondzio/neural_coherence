In my earlier post, I should plainly explained to use 64-bit fully or at all, requires 64-bit &quot;h/w&quot; as well.
The drivers thus must be MS ready for 64-bit usage.
In Vista it's all the more harder, not only finding 64-bit ready s/w but Vista has not been warmly supported as one would like.
Though, this is a big problem as in XP it still prevalent as well.
Vista was suppose to clear problems found in XP 64-bit version but it seems things aren't all that good.
Let's just say, if you can avoid 64-bit usage as a beginner there are problems in plain old 32-bit to deal with that seem more solvable.
