i'm living temporarily in an apartment complex where one of my neighbors has thoughtfully installed an open wifi access point, which i am happy to use.
but it doesn't work all the time.
sometimes it's fine, and sometimes there's no signal at all.
(but even if i get no reception in my apartment, i know the transmitter is on because if i take my laptop down the hall, it picks up the neighbor's signal loud and clear.)
is there a stronger *receiving* antenna that i can install in my apartment so i can always pick up the neighbor's signal?
all the repeaters and extenders i see advertised seem to apply to the sender's location.
what, if anything, can i do as the receiver?
