I didn't replace the PCB yet.
I hope to.If I can find a match.& I did call DriveSavers & even W/ a 10% discount It would still cost from 1200-2400 just to swap out the PCB.
What is cloning a boards ROM ?
Is this a real thing?
There is a guy in canada who says he can do this esp.
w/ WD drives & he has an E-bay store called ''Dariusale HDD solutions''.Im a total newbie so forgive my ignorance,but is it really possible to clone a PCB's ROM?
