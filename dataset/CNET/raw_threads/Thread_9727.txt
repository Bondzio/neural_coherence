It says I am able to have 2 networks in this 1 router and I was able to set up the 2 networks, but i do not see the second network in my network list. I have a total of 7 devices that are connected to the router and my main thing I wanted to do was have 1 laptop on its own network and be able to use the 5ghz channel. Any help would be great and thanks in advance.
