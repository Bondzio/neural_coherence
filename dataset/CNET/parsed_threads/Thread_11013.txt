<s> Hi everyone i need help choosing an antenna, im looking a directional antenna for a project. </s>
<s> So far i found an antenna: http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.37185 But im not sure about the quality of the antenna so im asking you guys. </s>
<s> Also i would like to know how much range i can look at with a 20dBm transmitter and a 36Dbm/4W Amplifier. </s>
<s> (Transmitter -&gt; Amplifier -&gt; Antenna). </s>
<s> Also if someone knows a better alternative it would be great. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> enkm </s>
<s> You can tell by the slick design that much of the effort went into the plastic artwork. </s>
<s> Great looking is your tipoff that they may have shortchanged the antenna work. </s>
<s> This area is when ugly beats pretty every time. </s>
<s> Look up the CANTENNA as a fine example. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the cantenna is thick and big, i need something thin that i can put on my project enclosure, it has to be lighter than lets say 200-500 grams, and as small as possible with at least 6+ dBi. </s>
<s> Im pretty sure you are right and this antenna is cheap and a piece of garbage but i couldn't find a better alternative, you might. </s>
<s> Thank you for your reply and i hope that someone will have a solution to my problem. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Why not try it? </s>
<s> Well there is no problem with trying, but im a paranoid type and i always have to have a plan b, so if the antenna is not 10dBi or close, i need to know that i have an alternative at any given situation. </s>
<s> That antenna look like exactly something i need, im also looking into the option of just modifying that antenna. </s>
<s> Also im wondering about the radiation pattern of that antenna since there are no actual radiation pattern image i am wondering if i can contact the manufacturer. </s>
<s> Yet i cant find that antenna at their website, so im starting to wonder if it is actually their product. </s>
<s> Shady Stuff </s>
<s> edit - sorry there is a mixup of the websites. </s>
<s> the product is there, not much information is there anyway so we are waiting for someone who has that antenna to comment on its performance. </s>
<s> Why must it be exactly 9 or 10 dB? </s>
<s> Something is not being told here. </s>
<s> If that performance is that important wouldn't we get out our RF NETWORK ANALYZER (see http://www.testequity.com/products/960/ ) and test this setup? </s>
<s> Tipping my hand here. </s>
<s> I wrote software for antenna testing years ago and used this and other gear to test these things. </s>
<s> But at 10 bucks this is something you should just get and try. </s>
<s> It's cheaper than time in the lab. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You sir are absolutely right, thank you for your help amd have a great week. </s>
<s> And for your question, one db is not much, but two, three db is almost and twice as weak signal. </s>
<s> im trying to establish a long range tunnel to connect to a device wireless, which is why i need the best focusing antenna i can get my hands on, one that is portable. </s>
