there is no file named that on the xp cd.
this could mean a bad xp cd or bad cd drive or cable.
the hard disk might be full.
tell me the output of the chkdsk command so i can tell what state the hard disk is in.
also it may take awhile but this could mean the hard disk couldn't be written to as in the case of sata drives.
if you have such, be sure to tell.
