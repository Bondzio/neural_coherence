1.1.1	Can i use my windows xp hard drive on my older pc that i have windows 98 on ?	Ques
1.1.2	I just want to use the xp equipped drive into the old pc not at the same time .	St
1.2.1	Is the OS on that drive ?	Ques
1.2.2	Are you going to replace the drive or add it ?	Ques
1.2.3	Is the drive NTFS ?	Ques
1.2.4	It wo n't work if you 're adding a non OS NTFS drive to a computer using Windows 98 .	St
1.3.1	installing XP writes to the hard disk information about your computer hardware , everytime you boot up , it checks the hardware in the computer against the list , if it differs by too much , it wo n't boot ... . hope this helps jonah .	St
1.4.1	It will boot , no matter how different the hardware is .	St
1.4.2	Windows will just detects the list of new devices and try to install drivers for it .	Sug
1.5.1	that you do n't really know what you 're talking about , you 're doing a great job ... . .	St
1.6.1	If you intent to use the XP HDD as an additional 'storage ' , AND if the free space you wish to use is is formatted in FAT32 , Yes , you can .	St
1.6.2	Only make sure that the XP HDD is not used as a Primary Master .	St
1.6.3	If you wish to run XP from the XP HDD , the answer is in all probablities , NO .	St
1.7.1	You might as well use the Windows XP as OS .	St
1.7.2	Since Windows XP formats the disk with NTFS as the first/default option .	St
1.7.3	Chances are your disk is NTFS .	St
1.7.4	Windows 98 wo n't be able to read it .	St
1.7.5	Besides , why use 98 when there is XP ?	Ques
1.8.1	If you do n't know what you 're talking about , do n't say anything .	St
1.9.1	this -- - & gt ; It will boot , no matter how different the hardware is .	St
1.9.2	Windows will just detects the list of new devices and try to install drivers for it is wrong ... take a HD from XP machine # 1 put it in XP machine # 2 and only if you are VERY VERY lucky will it boot up to desktop !	Sug
1.9.3	( and even then , you may possibly have problems with display/sound/modem etc ) take that same HD and put it in a win98 machine , and i will wager it will never boot up ... .	St
1.10.1	It will , I 've swapped harddisks between different machines many times .	St
1.10.2	Stop making assumptions .	St
1.11.1	Please give yourself some time to learn more .	Sug
1.11.2	Bob	St
1.12.1	People will correct you .	St
1.12.2	I agree this is bad advice you have given .	Polite
1.12.3	Bob	St
1.13.1	Stop acting like that .	St
1.13.2	I 've swapped harddisks before , and it will work .	St
1.13.3	Sound cards do n't work without a driver , but you do n't need sound to get into the system .	St
1.13.4	Graphic cards will always work without a driver , even though very inefficiently , usually at only 256 or even 16 colors .	St
1.13.5	When Windows does n't detect the existing hardware , it 'll simply try to detect and install the new hardware .	St
1.13.6	It 'll work , it has always worked .	St
1.13.7	Trust me .	St
1.13.8	When you try , you 'll see .	St
1.14.1	My xp system motherboard is fried but i want ot run xp on my other machine but I tried it and it gets to ''Insert disk to boot ''	St
1.15.1	If your old system is a vendor system do not expect to use XP .	St
1.15.2	If your OS disk is an OEM you may get lucky .	St
1.15.3	You will have to make the XP disk the master , the 98 disk a slave .	St
1.15.4	In BIOS set the CD-Rom as first boot device .	St
1.15.5	Insert the XP OS cd , save changes and reboot .	St
1.15.6	Follow the prompts to format the XP drive and install the OS .	St
1.15.7	This will create a dual boot system and will work with the OEM OS disk .	St
1.15.8	The problem ... Windows activation .	St
1.15.9	Do a google on dual boot .	Sug
1.15.10	Items to note : Xp needs 256MB memory min .	St
1.15.11	5 MB of H/D space .	St
1.15.12	Last note , 9x would at times allow H/D to be swapped from system to system .	St
1.15.13	60 % at the time it worked not so with XP .	St
1.15.14	Xp takes a snap shot of all the hwd on the system .	St
1.15.15	If the hwd profile does not match the system will not boot to Windows .	St
1.15.16	Dagger is in denial and a danger .	St
1.15.17	Follow Bob 's and Johan 's advice .	St
1.16.1	First of all , to get this out of the way , others seem to be saying that XP may simply not boot if the hardware is too different .	St
1.16.2	I ca n't say one way or the other , but it 's possible .	St
1.16.3	I 've moved drives with Win98 between systems and it was a pain because Win98 usually wanted to install new drivers for a lot of stuff .	St
1.16.4	WinXP may be pickier still , so it may just not work .	St
1.16.5	Putting that aside ...	St
1.16.6	If all you 're getting is a simple & quot ; insert boot disk & quot ; type of message , it sounds to me like you 're not getting as far as booting XP .	St
1.16.7	Of course without seeing the exact message , that 's just a guess .	St
1.16.8	I do n't think you said exactly what you 've done .	St
1.16.9	It sounds like you 're trying to boot from the XP drive in the other computer .	St
1.16.10	How is the XP drive connected ?	Ques
1.16.11	Primary or secondary IDE ?	Ques
1.16.12	Master or slave ?	Ques
1.16.13	For the moment at least , I 'd suggest disconnecting the Win98 drive and making the XP drive the primary master , assuming that that 's not what you 're already doing .	St
1.16.14	Depending on how old these systems are , if this other computer is seeing the drive geometry differently ( number of cylinders , heads , etc .	St
1.16.15	) , it may not be able to read the old data correctly , so it ca n't boot from it .	St
1.16.16	For example , if one computer was using LBA ( Logical Block Addressing ) and the other was not .	St
1.16.17	Also , if you disconnected the Win98 drive and connected the XP drive in its place , check the BIOS and make sure the drive information is correct there .	St
1.16.18	If the BIOS is still trying to use the Win98 drive information with the XP drive , that could be a problem ( unless the two drives happened to be the same or equivalent models ) .	St
1.16.19	If this other system is fairly & quot ; old & quot ; , whatever that means in computer terms , and the XP drive is fairly new , and especially if it 's a large drive , it 's possible that the other system just wo n't be able to read it correctly .	St
1.16.20	If you just ca n't get it to work , you might try posting some more hardware details , like your motherboard and hard drive model numbers .	St
1.16.21	If you can get the system to boot from the XP drive , but , as others have suggested , XP just wo n't work , you may still have a couple options .	St
1.16.22	I 've read that you might be able to do an XP install over top of the old XP install , so that XP can install the required drivers for the new hardware .	St
1.16.23	If you have anything on that XP drive you need , you should probably try to back it up before trying that .	Sug
1.16.24	Which brings us to ...	St
1.16.25	If you ca n't boot from that XP drive , you might be able to at least copy data from it by hooking it up as a second drive .	St
1.16.26	XP normally uses an NTFS filesystem , which Win98 does n't know how to read , but XP can use the FAT32 filesystem .	St
1.16.27	If your WinXP installation used FAT32 , Win98 should be able to read it .	St
1.16.28	If it 's NTFS , there may be Win98 programs that are capable of reading it .	St
1.16.29	If nothing else , there is a program named & quot ; NTFS Reader for DOS & quot ; that you can find on www.ntfs.com that can read NTFS filesystems .	St
1.16.30	As the name implies , it 's a DOS program , but you can also run it from a DOS window under Win98 .	St
1.16.31	It 's not perfect , but it might help .	St
1.16.32	And one last thing .	St
1.16.33	You said the & quot ; xp system motherboard is fried & quot ; .	St
1.16.34	If the motherboard went , it 's possible it took the drive with it .	St
1.16.35	For that matter , the _drive_ may have died and taken the motherboard with _it_ .	St
1.16.36	Either way , the XP drive may simply be broken .	St
1.16.37	At this point there 's no way to tell ( at least not based on what I remember you saying so far ) .	St
1.16.38	Good luck .	Polite
1.16.39	James	St
1.17.1	it wouldnt seem to me that 98 would be able to read the ntfs format .	St
1.17.2	i know xp can raed fat32 but that 's more a sort of backwards compatability deal where ntfs didnt really reach common place usage til xp hit the market .	St
1.18.1	I have to agree with this .	St
1.18.2	Ive taken my old hard drive out of my old computer , and put it into a freshly built computer , and it ran just fine .	St
1.18.3	Sure some programs had problems but that was complelty cause of things i installed .	St
1.18.4	Other than that the drivers installed for the new hardware , except for a few i had to add through a cd .	St
1.19.1	If what they have been saying about not being able to change too much of the hardware , then consider this .	St
1.19.2	If that was the case you would not be able to do serious updates to your hardware like i have done , and i know many others have to .	St
1.19.3	For a friend , who had XP installed on a Gigabyte k7 triton motherboard , with an amd athlon 2000+ cpu , 512mb ddr2700 ram , and a gainward gnvidia geforce fx 5200 , to a amd athlon 3000+ , 3 sticks of ddr3200 512mb ram , and an nvidia geforce fx 5600 on his b-day .	St
1.19.4	The harddrive had no problems .	St
1.19.5	Sure he had to install alot of new drivers , but other than that it was just fine .	St
1.19.6	Like i said in my last post as well , i have moved a hard drive from one system to another , one with completly diffrent parts .	St
1.19.7	XP does build a list of hardware , but it doesnt stop working when those go away .	St
1.19.8	If that were the case you wouldnt be able to upgrade .	St
1.19.9	Saying it only happens if , & quot ; too much & quot ; of the hardware is upgraded would be even worse coding than microsft is known to make .	St
