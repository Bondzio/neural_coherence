i'm getting ready to buy a new video card.
in the specs it states the resolutions and the refresh rates ( i.e.
800x600 70hz - 1028x720 75hz etc.
)for the card.
while looking at my monitors manual i also noticed that it included these same numbers (resolutions-refresh rates)and that the refresh rates for the same settings were different.
my question is - which of the two( video card or monitor)determines the refresh rate you see on the screen ?
or how does this work ?
