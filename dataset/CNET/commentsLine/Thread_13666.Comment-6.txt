wire would be best but you lose portability of that's of importance.
i'm not sure that bridging through your laptop can be easily done.
frankly, i've never tried that other than to create an ap from another pc.
it would seem best to connect it directly to the whole network than require a dependency on another machine.
bridging to router should not be that hard.
you need two capable devices and create an association between them.
you can set up your dhcp server (generally your router) to provide some addresses dynamically but reserve a range for those that need fixed addresses.
i'll be limited in what i can offer in the way of specifics as i've only done this (minimally) with printers as single devices.
it works with these.
