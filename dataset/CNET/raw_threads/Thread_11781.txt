It just isn't generic enough to be accepted, though I'm sure a plain flash drive is. See, if the school will allow an install so you can proceed, if not see what products are supported. It may mean the school system needs to be updated as a possible another source of the problem. tada -----Willy

Is there any alterations that I could make to the flash drive and not the computer? I can run programs just not install them.
