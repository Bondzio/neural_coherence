i have a dell dimension 2400. xp home edition.
i don't have anything altered to the default factory settings.
the situation i described is all i know, i have never been able to pin point the audio problem to a specific occurrence.
i never have noticed after i do something it happens, it just seems to occur every so often.
would it be a driver for the os for audio?
or a driver for winamp/media player?
