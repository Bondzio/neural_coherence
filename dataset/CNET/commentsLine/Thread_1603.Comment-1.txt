just got a brand new hp pavilian dv5 notebook.
everything is fine.
except i can hear clock ticking sound from hard drive constantly.
it is not exactly one second per click, but very similar.
when hard drive is working hard, it makes normal sound.
when it is kind of idle, it is ticking.
is this normal?
thanks
