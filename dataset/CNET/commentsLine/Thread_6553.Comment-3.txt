epson has three models i know of, ranging from $100 to about $400 (the latter also being a quality photo printer), but none of them are all-in-ones.
i know of no other paper/disk printers at this time.
you must realize that these will not print to ordinary disks, but only those with a special surface to receive and retain the ink.
hope this helps frank
