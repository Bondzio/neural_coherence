Which brand of hard drive is best to use?
and Circuit City has a sale on SeaGate for Internal and Simpletech for external(one is a network attached hard drive and one is not).
Any suggestions?
While I am asking, what about memory?
Are there any brands of memory that are better than the others?
Circuit city has a sale on Kingston.
Thank You.
