1.1.1	I sent in rebate form and invoice for $500, they first denied receiving it, then they denied the invoice was included, and it was voided.	St
1.1.2	Their rebate vendor, and Alienware, are scammers.	St
1.1.3	I filed with the FTC and attorney general Florida.	St
1.1.4	DONT buy from ALIENWARE, THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF !!!!	St

1.4.1	Alienware makes an awesome gamers delight!	St
1.4.2	How could someone NOT like to have one?	St
1.4.3	haha	St
1.5.1	and i don't do server/professional, nor do I know where to obtain a decent MIPS ISA OS, nor do I care to find out I wouldn't like an Alienware, or any Botique computer for that matter also to Alienwaresucks...um, is it possible that it got lost in the mail?	St

1.6.7	We are considering a class action lawsuit (any lawyers interested?).	St
1.6.8	The system may be good, but when a company advertises a price *post* rebate, it really puts a bad taste in my mouth to have to turn on the PC every day and look at it every day knowing that Alienware has my $500 and the $500 of many others...	St
