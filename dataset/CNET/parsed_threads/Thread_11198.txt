<s> i have 2 pc with different os windows 98 and windows xp can i network them so that i can share files from both pc what cable should i use and what other configuration should i do thanks </s>

<s> All you should need is an ethernet card in each computer and cross-over ethernet cable for the connection. </s>
<s> Both OS's should be able to automatically configure the hardware so that sharing of files is possible. </s>
<s> The network setup wizard on XP should be run on both computers, but isn't absolutely necessary. </s>
<s> To run the XP setup wizard on 98 you can use the XP setup CD or a floppy disk with the wizard on it which can be created when the wizard is run on XP first. </s>
