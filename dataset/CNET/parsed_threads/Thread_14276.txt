<s> Hi, I was using wifi with IE which now suddenly failed but can still go online wired to the Netgear router. </s>
<s> My other PC works in wifi on same router. </s>
<s> From the scan below can you say where it went wrong? </s>
<s> [URL=http://img189.imageshack.us/i/edsz.jpg/][IMG] http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9436/edsz.jpg [/IMG][/URL] Asus P5K Premium WiFiiFi Intel, Intel Core 2 Quad Pro Q6600 95W 2.4GHz, OCZ Vendetta Cpu Cooler, 2x2GB, 240-pin DIMM, DDR2 800 (400mhz) PC2-6400, EVGA GeForce 9800 GTX KO 512MB GDDR3 (PCI-E), Seagate Barraguda sata 250gb, Corsair TX750M Psu, X45, XPhome/Win8 </s>
<s> Routers do go bad after a few years, even though they have no moving parts. </s>
<s> Have you made any recent changes before this happened? </s>
<s> Have you checked Device Manager to be sure your WiFi adapter is enabled and working properly? </s>
<s> SOLVED DNS & Adresses changed to &quot;automatically&quot; </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> So do I. </s>
<s> The only thing I did for uknown reason was to plug in a cable pc-to-router & it worked too but, when that was unplugged lost the WIFI connection. </s>
<s> May that upset the settings? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I do know we can't get wired and wifi at the same time without some expert tweaking but just using the stock system, it's a mystery still why it changed. </s>
