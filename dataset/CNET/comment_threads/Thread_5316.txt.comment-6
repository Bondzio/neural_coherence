&quot; at the end the story is usually told that it was not worth the trouble.&quot; I'm taking this in deep consideration.
I kinda agree with it, but it's good to have more opinions in the same side to put things into perspective.
In specific, from the research I've been doing, this is probably true for hard disks.
I mean, I don't know any tech place claiming to fix RAM memory, for instance, or pen drives - they just are able to recover the data in the rare case you need to.
Hard disks just almost seem like are made to break sooner or later.
Thanks!
