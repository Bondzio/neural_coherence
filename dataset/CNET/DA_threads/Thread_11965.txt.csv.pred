1.1.2	Both computers are running XP.one home one pro .	St
1.1.3	I ahve gone through the network setup wizard on both of them .	St
1.1.4	I dont know which configuration to choose so i just picked one .	St
1.1.5	I think it was the defalut that comes up .	St
1.1.6	I entered in all of the info and it said it was done and that I ahd to restart .	St
1.1.7	so i did .	St
1.1.8	i also did this on the other which connects via 802.11b .	St
1.1.9	I went to My Network Places and tried to view the workgroup computers .	St
1.1.10	Each time i received a dialog box that said I could n't access the network .	St
1.1.11	It said that a server had n't been secified .	St
1.1.12	The internet works fine on both of them by the way .	St
1.1.13	I have done other posts in the past and i have not provided enough info .	St
1.1.14	if you need anymore .	St
1.1.15	please let me know .	Sug
1.2.1	name , they both should be the same .	St
1.2.2	Turn off the firewalls until the LAN is working .	St
1.2.3	& quot ; It said that a server had n't been secified & quot ; This sounds suspiciously like a Domain had been set .	St
1.3.1	the workgroup names are both the same .	St
1.3.2	I pretty sure that I did n't set up a domain in the first place .	St
1.3.3	just a refresher put what is the domain again .	St
1.4.1	on the Computer name tab your workgroup name or the Domain you belong to will be shown .	St
1.4.2	If a Domain name is listed you can change by clicking the Change button and switch to a workgroup .	St
1.5.1	well in order to do that you would have to be able to view the workgroup computers right .	St
1.5.2	( i think ) well thats when i get the error message .	St
1.5.3	it comes up when i click & quot ; view workgroup computers. & quot ; I came home and i did what you have just explained wheere your click on the name and click on properties so i think i know what your saying .	St
1.5.4	i am going over to their house tomorrow to look at it again	St
