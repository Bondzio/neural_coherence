Technically, you cannot buy that OEM version of Windows.
While I doubt you'll get a knock on the door, it won't be legal according to the license policy.
OEM version are for resellers only.
The price is quite cheap but you also have one other issue to deal with in that you will not be able to use that copy again if and when you build a new PC.
You're spending plenty on your rig.
I'd suggest a proper copy of Windows would be a good idea.
