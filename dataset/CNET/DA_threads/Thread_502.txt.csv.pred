1.1.1	Hello , I just bought a notebook with that being its processor , and now am having some serious second thoughts .	St
1.1.2	I know that the Celeron is for the & quot ; budget & quot ; users , and does not hold up too good when compared to the Pentium M. My question is , the Celeron M Processor is 1.50GHz/1MB Cache/400MHz FSB and the Pentium M Processor 730 is 1.60 GHz/2MB Cache/533MHz FSB To me it looks like its just a small difference .	St
1.1.3	I mean , its just a .1 difference for the # of Ghz , and 1 MB for the Cache , etc .	St
1.1.4	What do these numbers mean anyway ?	Ques
1.1.5	Can somebody explain it relatively ?	Ques
1.1.6	Would a .1 difference in Ghz be that big ?	Ques
1.1.7	If it would help , I 'll be using my notebook for lots of multitasking , but just between word documents , internet , playing mp3 's and small videos .	St
1.1.8	I wont edit videos on it or anything , but will want to watch DVD 's and download music .	St
1.1.9	And for gaming , just want to play Sims 2 .	St
1.2.1	oops , the processor I got with my notebook being the ''Celeron M 370 '' one	St
1.3.1	The cache and fsb is different .	St
1.3.2	The cache wo n't make much of a diff .	St
1.3.3	As for the fsb speed , it determines your multiplier , which determines your clock speed .	St
1.3.4	So 1.5 wo n't make much of a difference to 1.6 .	St
1.3.5	Usually if you customize a notebook , you can upgrade to a 1.6 for little $ $ $ .	St
1.3.6	The main difference is the features .	St
1.3.7	The 370 lacks certain features that the Pentium M comes with .	St
1.3.8	BTW , good luck playing sims 2 , i believe you need a direct x 9.0c compatible gfx card .	St
1.3.9	Now the gma 900 , which proabbly comes with your system supports it i think , but ppl had problems with it .	St
1.3.10	ROger	St
1.4.1	The system that I got was the based system of the Dell Inspiron 6000 , but I just upgraded the processor from the Celeron 350 to the 370 .	St
1.4.2	Now I know I should 've bought the more expensive one , but hey .	St
1.4.3	Alright , so what other features does the Pentium have that the Celeron does n't ?	Ques
1.5.1	There 's a website called google .	St
1.5.2	You can search for the answer to your question there ...	Ques
1.5.3	But as you 've already in grief , i 'll answer it for you .	St
1.5.4	The main difference is enhanced speedstep which is only for centrino systems ( not actually confined to that as it has migrated to desktops ) .	St
1.5.5	Enhanced Intel SpeedStep technology Enhanced Intel SpeedStep technology enables real-time dynamic switching of the VOLTAGE and FREQUENCY between two performance modes based on processor DEMAND .	St
1.5.6	This occurs by SWITCHING the system bus ratios , core operating voltage , and core processor SPEEDS without resetting the system .	St
1.5.7	It lets you have more battery life .	St
1.5.8	The Celeron M is only a cut-down Pentium M as the Celeron D is a cutdown of the Pentium 4 .	St
1.5.9	Roger	St
1.6.1	Although I tried to understand that as much as I could , I generally got the idea .	St
1.6.2	Oh geeez , I should 've just shelled out a $ 100 more just to get a Pentium M ( you think ? ) .	St
1.6.3	Alright , alright , thank you very much .	Polite
