1.1.1	I have a Intel Processor running on Windows XP Home.	St
1.1.2	I have bought two Kingston 512 MB of RAM and I have propely put it in the soket.	St
1.1.3	The problem is that on Windows, it says that I have 896 MB of RAM.	St
1.1.4	Please help!	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Did you check to make sure this RAM was compatible with the motherboard you installed it in?	St
1.3.2	If not this could be the issue.	St
1.3.3	That is why many mamory manufacturer sites have a configuration tool.	St
1.3.4	This will allow you to put the make and model of you board in there and it will tell you the part numbers that you should purchase.	St
1.3.5	This is really a big factor.	St
1.3.6	Does not matter if you set the memory in there correctly or not.	St
1.3.7	For example on SOYO board only takes dual sided RAM in slots 1 and 3 and in slots 2 and 4 it must be single sided.	St
1.3.8	Which leads me to another factor.	St
1.3.9	You could try moving your RAM into differnt slot combinations because you may have the same issue.	Sug
1.3.10	The final thought would be that you have a bad stick.	St
1.4.1	Right click My Computer and click the properties button.	St
1.5.1	I did not find anything like the sort.	St
1.6.1	...where you get this number.	St
1.6.2	Also, is it listed as total RAM, free RAM, used RAM?	St
1.6.3	What is the computer model?	St
1.6.4	Does your computer use integrated video or a video card that has shares system memory?	St
1.6.5	If so, some places will display the total system memory minus that which is being used for video display.	St
1.6.6	What does PC Wizard ( http://www.cpuid.org/pcwizard ) say about your installed memory?	St
1.7.1	...that you got it from the System Properties window.	St
1.7.2	Sorry about that.	St
1.7.3	Still, try a system utility program like the one I previously mentioned.	St
1.8.1	If you subtract 896MBs RAM from 1024MBs RAM you get 128MBs.	St
1.8.2	Since you've added RAM, maybe plug and play and the OS sets aside more RAM ... maybe 64MBs, for the onboard video.	Sug
1.9.1	I also have to inform you that I made this custom.	St
1.9.2	It has an ATI Express 200 and I think that it takes 128 MB of my RAM.	St
1.9.3	Thanx!	St
1.10.1	a separate video card ??	St
1.10.2	Or one of the new video cards that has some RAM on the card but can use some of the system memory too ?	Ques
1.11.1	problem solved.	St
1.11.2	chuck	St
