1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	So I just bought a new 1 gb crucial ram for my HP Pavilion Media Center TV m7750n PC ( http : //h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/ho/WF06b/12132708-12133156-12133158-12133158-12133158-79481422-79912096.html ) and I ca n't seem to fit the RAM into the slot on the motherboard ( I have to force it in , and then the pc wont boot , and gives off a beeping sound ) .	St
1.1.3	The RAM that I brought was crucial product # CT12864AA53E ( 1GB 240-PIN DIMM 128Mx64 DDR2PC2-4200 UNBUFFERED ) and I 'm sure that it matches the 2*1 GB RAM that already came with my computer ( I verified the memory specifications with HP 's website and other websites ) Thanks for any suggestions .	St
1.1.4	I am desprate for that extra 1 GB performance , because I run really memory-eating apps !	St
1.1.5	.	St
1.2.1	only allows it to be installed one way .	St
1.2.2	How much RAM do you have now ?	Ques
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Visiting the web link you provided , states that the ram is DDR2 type .	St
1.3.2	Further , you mentioned you brought just 1 ram stick .	St
1.3.3	In order to use the ram in DDR2 mode , you need actually 2 ram sticks , thus another 1gb ram stick is required to quiet the beeping .	St
1.3.4	That will be a total of 4gb which undewr the OS will accept and further only see 3.5gb of it for use but it will acknowledge the 4gb total .	St
1.3.5	Google if you want more into .	St
1.3.6	IMHO , you need another 1gb ram stick or return the 1gb you brought for 2x512mb ram sticks in order to populate the ram slots if you like .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	have purchased 2 @ 512 to take advantage of dual channel architecture But I 'm not sure I agree with .	St
1.4.2	.	St
1.4.3	.	St
1.4.4	'In order to use the ram in DDR2 mode , you need actually 2 ram sticks , thus another 1gb ram stick is required to quiet the beeping . '	St
1.4.5	Another stick is not required and it 's not consistent with what 's stated on the Crucial site ... see below .	St
1.4.6	http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=Media % 20Center % 20m7750n & quot ; Q : Do I have to install matching pairs ?	Ques
1.4.7	A : No .	St
1.4.8	No , you can install modules one at a time , and you can mix different densities of modules in your computer .	St
1.4.9	But if your computer supports dual-channel memory configurations , you should install in identical pairs ( preferably in kits ) for optimal performance .	St
1.4.10	Q : Does my computer support dual-channel memory ?	Ques
1.4.11	A : Yes .	St
1.4.12	To benefit from the performance advantages offered by dual-channel systems , you should install memory in identical pairs .	St
1.4.13	Installing a kitted pair is the best way to ensure that your modules are identical , right down to the chip count. & quot ; VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	about your specific computer ; I went to the Crucial website , from there I entered the specific make/ model and this is what it came up with : http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=Media % 20Center % 20m7750n You do n't have to buy exclusively from Crucial , but it gives you specific details on the memory or your setup	St
