16gb, no extra programs...at least not that I recall.
If it had any, I simply deleted them.
In any case, why not simply delete the programs on your flash if you don't want to use them?
Last year I bought one of those Cruze Micro flash drives with the U3 software.
Simply reformatted it to wipe out the US software which was a waste of time.
All flash drives can be reformatted to be &quot;plain jane.&quot;
