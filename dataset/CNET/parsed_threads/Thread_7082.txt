<s> I bought a new hdtv and I am trying to get all my stuff connected with the receiver I have. </s>
<s> I have my XBOX 360, Blu Ray and HDTV Cable box connected to the back of my tv with 3 HDMI cables. </s>
<s> The tv has an optical out so I have an optical cable to my reciever so all those things are in surround sound. </s>
<s> I have my desktop connected to the tv with a VGA, the audio is connected from the headphones jack to an auxillary port (RCA). </s>
<s> I have some DVD backups on my hard drive and I would like to get the sound instead of standard stereo to be 5.1. </s>
<s> The problem is the only port I have left on my older receiver is the composite audio which is an older technology but would give me what I want. </s>
<s> I searched everywhere on the internet and the only audio cards I could find have optical out, hdmi, or the computer speakers 5.1 style. </s>
<s> I will probably have to get an older card from ebay since this technology is kind of dated but if anyone can point me in the direction of a specific one I would be so very greatful. </s>
<s> so instead of plugging the phone to TV RCA why not plug them into receiver RCA? </s>
<s> Isn't that what composite audio is (white/red)? </s>
<s> Then set your receiver to fake 5.1 out for that input. </s>
<s> From what I understand composite audio was one cable that handled the 5.1 signal, on my receiver its the DVD/6Channel input. </s>
<s> what you are looking for is on the audio card or built-in audio on the computer; Your earphone or line-out are such connections. </s>
<s> You just have to get one of those plug to RCA adapter cable. </s>
<s> That's actually what I have, I have a headphone jack to (Red and White) RCA cables but that only produces 2.0 stereo. </s>
<s> I AM LOOKING FOR A PCI CARD FOR MY DESKTOP COMPUTER THAT HAS A COMPOSITE AUDIO OUTPUT WHICH WILL PRODUCE 5.1 SURROUND SOUND. </s>
<s> http://www.pricewatch.com/gallery/sound_cards/5.1_channel It's not called composite audio, it's multi-channel audio. </s>

<s> My understand of a COMPOSITE connections are one video and one stereo. </s>
<s> Are you thinking of coax audio connection which uses a cable that looks like a audio cable? </s>
