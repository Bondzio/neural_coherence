1.1.1	I 'm in the process of upgrading my entire system 's hardware and would like to transfer the data from 2 PATA hardrives to the new SATA hardrive that is in the new system .	St
1.1.2	The two old drives are both western digital , the new one is a seagate .	St
1.1.3	Whats the easiest way to transfer data between the old and new hardrives ?	Ques
1.1.4	Both the old and new systems are or will be running XP Pro .	St
1.1.5	Can I install XP on the new system using the XP disc that was installed on the old one , without running into licensing problems ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or would I be better off installing a fresh XP disc on the new system ?	Ques
1.1.7	The data I want to transfer is saved games for the kids , pictures , and videos .	St
1.1.8	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	First , games ( and almost any program ) will not move if they have been installed .	St
1.2.2	They 're set in the registry and just will not move .	St
1.2.3	Other stuff can be moved by putting the old drives either : As a slave drive in the new machine By putting the drives into an external USB2 case Once XP is installed in a machine it can not be installed into another machine .	St
1.2.4	Remember the & quot ; Activation & quot ; step ?	Ques
1.3.1	Thats kind of the way I was thinking .	St
1.3.2	Games being re-installed and just the saved progress folders being substituted , and trying to direct transfer other files from one HD to another .	St
1.3.3	A new XP disk is already on the way also .	St
1.3.4	I 'm glad to know I 'm on the right track .	St
