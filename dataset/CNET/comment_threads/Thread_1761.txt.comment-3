The keyboard problem doesn't occur if I use a usb keyboard instead of a ps/2.
I removed the optical drives, floppy disk and PCI cards.
I left only the sata disk and PCIe video card.
The keyboard problem didn't occur then.
But the onboard nic problem didn't change.
The PSU is a 5 year old one that came with the Aopen case.
There doesn't seem to be something physically wrong with the motherboard, at least visually.
I'm going to look for a decent PSU and then see what happens.
