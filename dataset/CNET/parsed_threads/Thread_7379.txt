<s> I am about to purchase a new computer proably the CyberPOWER GAMER ULTRA SLI PRO. </s>
<s> The system comes configured with 2 NEW!!! </s>
<s> NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 320MB 16X PCI Express graphics cards (Major Brand Powered by NVIDIA) and a STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY. </s>
<s> However a 500W Power Supply is recommended for using dual 7900 and X1950 or above video cards. </s>
<s> Should I stay with the STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY or should I upgrade to 500W [for +$49], 600W [+79], or even a 700W (quad SLI ready) [+146]? </s>
<s> I have more of the specs right here: - Free! </s>

<s> Thank-you </s>
<s> I like having the extra 100 Watts because the electrolytic capacitors degrade pretty fast in the first 2 years. </s>
<s> It's a cheap thing to add the extra 100 Watt capability and saves headaches later. </s>

<s> there's more than 1 AM2 4400. </s>
<s> And for a few more bucks, you can get a 4800 (2.5GHz) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103778 VAPCMD </s>
<s> I'm getting a (Socket AM2) AMD Athlon64 X2 4400+ Dual-Core CPU w/ HyperTransport Technology and I do not plan on upgrading CPU. </s>
<s> If you had a power supply JUST BIG ENOUGH, it would have an issue in about a year. </s>
<s> That's why we move up the the next size. </s>

<s> As previously indicated .... AMD has many CPUs...case in point THERE ARE TWO AM2 X2 4400s ... which ONE comes with your system ? </s>
<s> The 89W or 65W CPU ? </s>
<s> Or the 65nm or 90nm technology ? </s>
<s> 2200Mhz or 2300Mhz ? </s>
<s> 2MB Cache or 1MB cache ? </s>

<s> It's often the case you can upgrade to a faster CPU for only a few bucks more than the one you're buying. </s>
<s> Can't figure why you're putting such a low-end CPU in an otherwise high-end system ? </s>

<s> I am getting the (Socket AM2) AMD Athlon64 X2 4400+ Dual-Core CPU w/ HyperTransport Technology. </s>
<s> You can see more specs @ http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/spec/getspec.asp?n=CPU&v=%28Socket%20AM2%29%20AMD%20Athlon%u212264%20X2%204400%2b%20Dual-Core%20CPU%20w/%20HyperTransport%20Technology . </s>
<s> No I am not changing my CPU. </s>
<s> I just need to know what power supply I should get. </s>
<s> you'd know exactly what is was you were getting (paying for) and that there were CPU options that better matched your system without spending much more. </s>
<s> But since you're not interested in knowing more or scoping out better options...I'll leave you to your power supply. </s>
