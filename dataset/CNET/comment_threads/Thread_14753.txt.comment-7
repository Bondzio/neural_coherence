The major thrust for externals, I always thought, was that you could backup all your data and just transfer to another PC when your primary went down.
I've lost about 5 HDs in the last few years but it never slowed me down much.
I have 5 PCs and a laptop, all with USB2.
I have 3 externals with some data replicated on all 3, in addition to the internals.
I lost an external a while back and decided HDs, external and internal, just weren't dependable enough for critical data, unless quite redundant.
I thought that's what RAID was all about.
If your OS gets corrupted, you'll need another HD with the OS on it anyhow to pull the files off ( unless you're lucky enough to get System Restore to really work - mine always look like an MS patch-job, too little, too late ) I always have a formatted HD lying around to reinstall XP Pro on for emergencies.
Anything short of a format seems to leave all sorts of artifacts that MS wants as evidence of your criminal activities.
I can always be back on the air in a few hours, with access to most of my apps, although complete reinstall with the thousands of registry entries so dear to the hearts of the lower level programmers takes a full day.
