Proffitt	2/17/07 8:46 AM	1.17170196E12	Exactly which model?	http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/alcatel-bugs As I can see if you tracert to say www.google.com the first or second IP address will be your ADSL/Router/Bridge. But only on some models. You could try that exploit about the EXPERT logon. Bob
