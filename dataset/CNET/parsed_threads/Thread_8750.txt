<s> Hi, Recently I have bought some extra ram for my old Packard Bell. </s>
<s> At current it has 256mb of ram but once I get the ram in the mail an installed it I will have 512mb. </s>
<s> Going to the next step is replacing the CPU. </s>
<s> I don't know if I will but I would like to get some info on it anyway. </s>
<s> I have a Gigabyte GA-8SIML which supports Intel socket 478 and 400 fsb. </s>
<s> The current processor is an Intel Celeron 2.1Ghz and my chipset is a SIS 650. </s>
<s> My main questions are: What is the fastest processor that my motherboard supports? </s>
<s> Where can I buy it? </s>
<s> (I live in Australia and is ebay ok?) </s>
<s> Is buying a second hand or used CPU ok? </s>
<s> Is it worth it? </s>
<s> Will I need a new cooler? </s>
<s> Is it as simple as this: -- http://www.tech-faq.com/upgrade-cpu.shtml -- or will I need to change options in the BIOS or in Windows My current temps are around 12-14 degrees Celsius and I think the cooler is an AVC C7015B12M Fan with this Heat sink: http://img76.imageshack.us/img76/56/img0032ts8.jpg (I don't know what it is called). </s>
<s> So it looks like this: http://www.freewebs.com/pcconfig/images/0010.jpg . </s>
<s> At this stage I'm not sure if I want to do it but the more involved I get the more I want to do it! </s>
<s> If you need any more information I will gladly try and find it for you. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> PB about upgrade CPUs ?? </s>
<s> Even though GigaByte made the MB in your system ...they made it for PB who is responsible for supporting it. </s>
<s> I was not able to find any reference to that MB on the Gigabyte website. </s>
<s> Until you find out the upper limit of your CPU upgrade choices, the prices and describe the intended use, it's kind of difficult to comment on ...'Is it worth it?' </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I read some of the documentation that PB gave me and I found this out. </s>
<s> Socket mPGA 478B. </s>
<s> Supports Intel Pentium 4 FC-PGA2 processor, 1.4 to 2.2 GHz. </s>
<s> 100 MHz (x4 = 400 MHz) data bus speed is supported (Quad-Bumped technology). </s>
<s> Does that mean that the best processor I can get is a P4 2.2Ghz? </s>
<s> This Website tells be differently: http://support.packardbell.com/uk/item/index.php?i=spec_columbiagx&pi=platform_clipper_imediavl#CPU What information do I beleive? </s>
<s> (Or is the info on the internet just newer because maybe the higher p4 CPUs wern't around when my documentaion was printed) Here is the link for my motherboard on Gigabyte's Site: http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ProductID=1335 I cant't find my computer on Packard Bell's site. </s>
<s> I am mainly using my computer for general use like email, internet, light gaming (e.g. </s>
<s> Age of Empires 2), music and storage. </s>
<s> The main reason is for shear speed as I am quite tired of waiting 1 or 2 minutes for iTunes to load even though I have upgraded my ram (which has greatly increased speed). </s>
<s> Another main reason I want to do it is to maybe make the computer a media centre computer (with a program like mediaportal). </s>
<s> I'd try this link... http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ProductID=1335 Lots of CPU choices....only question is whether your PC has PB BIOS or one by GigaByte. </s>
<s> Was this the MB that in the PC or was it a replacement MB ? </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thanks for the cpu link. </s>
<s> According to the table the best I can get is P4-Northwood 2.6 Ghz. </s>
<s> I am running AMI (American Megatrends) Bios version 3.0B which I am guessing is the PB Bios. </s>
<s> GigaByte show BIOS &quot;Fe&quot; dated 2002/10/28 and P4 Prescott 3.4Ghz. </s>
<s> Your machine will most certainly run better with more RAM. </s>
<s> Keep us posted. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> (I'm quite angry right now because I just finished typing my post then IE froze so thank goodness for Safari. </s>
<s> But I still have to retype the post!!! </s>
<s> Waaa) I am quite sure I cannot use the P4 Prescott 3.4Ghz because on the right hand side of this table: http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ProductID=1 it says it is not avaliable for my motherboard. </s>
<s> I am running the original BIOS And have never upraded it. </s>
<s> The main reason for that is I don't know how but hey!, I can ask CNET. </s>
<s> So will I have to upgrade by BIOS to upgrade my CPU? </s>
<s> I still sort of want to know where I can buy a CPU. </s>
<s> I am in Australia not far from Sydney but too far to go just for 1 little CPU. </s>
<s> There is a computer fair just down the road that that runs every month so I will take a trip down ther when I can. </s>
<s> Is buying a used CPU alright because I can't get boxed ones any more as Intel no longer does this for this CPU an Is ebay a good place to buy them? </s>
<s> If I do find the Northwood CPU would I need a new heatsink/fan and would there be a considerable increase of speed If I did upgrade from the Celeron 2.1Ghz? </s>
<s> I recently search for a Pentium D upgrade and there no where to be found. </s>
<s> &quot;End of support&quot;. </s>
<s> This thread untracked </s>
<s> Most often what I see is ....a mfg like PB build a system using a MB from a company like GigaByte but often it's not a production MB....it's made specially for PB, HP or Gateway, etc., But in this case it appears that PB is using a retail production GigaByte MB and that you could use the GigaByte BIOS vs the PB BIOS. </s>
<s> There's risk that it might not work or fail however if it works ...it could permit a higher performance Prescott CPU. </s>
<s> The other option is buy new and at today's prices...that's an attractive option. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...You would have to get a more robust HS Fan for the Prescott CPU. </s>
<s> Without advertising .. Intel makes HS Fans to match the CPU so they're beefier for the higher end units. </s>
<s> it should be: http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ProductID=1335 This is the link for the same motherboard including the changes PB has made: http://support.packardbell.com/uk/item/index.php?i=spec_columbiagx&pi=platform_clipper_imediavl Ok thanks for the information. </s>
<s> It is greatly apprieciated. </s>
<s> I will buy new if I can and I will buy as soon as I feel I am ready. </s>
<s> Thnx, Jono </s>
<s> max CPU would be P4-Northwood 2.6G...I was misreading the right hand side of the chart. </s>
<s> Given the cost of DDR2 and the multitude of CPU options ... you can get a good bang for the buck in today's PCs. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> if i were i would rather purchase a new set of mboards, processors, rams, graphic cards and other interfaces. </s>
<s> i recently purchased intel core 2 duo boards and cpu, w/ 160 gig of hdd, a 2 gig of ram, and 512 mb of graphic card and its cost me around 25,000 pesos or if i convert it into dollar i thinks its around 500 usd? </s>
<s> yeah its 500 usd and its worth it! </s>
<s> i enjoy vista and lot more no crash down no slow boot up and of course a nice gaming environment.. dont take it seriously im just suggesting because if you upgrade yours you wont prevent any errors and malfunctions to occur. </s>
<s> thanks and hope tis will you. </s>
