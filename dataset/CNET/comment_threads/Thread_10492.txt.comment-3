The fact that even the laptops had some amount of delay makes me think it's more than that (though upgrading would certainly help)?
I saw one forum that mentioned something about setting DNS for your local server vs. that of your ISP being part of the problem.
Again, while the Win 98 computers were definitely set for replacement anyway, just want to make sure; we don't want to buy upgrade everything else and still have the same issue, thanks.
