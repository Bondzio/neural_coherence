1.1.1	I 'm trying to get my new dvd burner to be the master drive .	St
1.1.2	First : Can anybody tell me how to figure out which drive is master and which slave ?	Ques
1.1.3	In bios , it always jyst says a cd device boots up after c : .	St
1.1.4	( I have cdrw and dvdrw ) .	St
1.1.5	I ca n't tell if the 40pin ide cable 's grey ( middle ) pin is the master or is the black ( end ) pin master ?	Ques
1.1.6	I thought it was the grey , so I set the dvrw jumper to master , plugged it into the grey pin ( middle ) of ide cable and started the computer .	St
1.1.7	I think the cable is the 40 ( line/pin ) type .	St
1.1.8	I ca n't tell how to tell if it is regular or the 'y ' shaped kind of cable.Either way I plug in , black or grey pins , the cdrw drive blinks first ( by like a tenth of a second though ) , the cdrw jumper is on slave , the dvdrw on master .	St
1.1.9	( ( I also have an I think 80 ? pin ?	Ques
1.1.10	ide cable , it has a blue connector as well , I could try that one ? ) )	Ques
1.1.11	But again which pin is which master/slave ?	Ques
1.1.12	And in computer properties it does'nt tell you which drive is the first boot ? !	Ques
1.1.13	Please help .	St

1.2.1	80 conductor cables just assign M/S by placement and you set all drives to CS or cable select .	St
1.2.2	No mystery , but you just be able to tell the difference on the cable .	St
1.2.3	Since you have BLUE , BLACK and GREY connectors , we 'll call it an 80 CONDUCTOR cable .	St
1.2.4	ALL the drives on such a cable will be jumpered to CS .	St
1.2.5	In closing , you do n't want to know that I still find NEW CDRW drives that wo n't play with other drives until I update the CDRW drive FIRMWARE .	St
1.2.6	This is asking far too much of consumers , but once I mention it , then most will go & quot ; aha ! & quot ; and fix it .	St
