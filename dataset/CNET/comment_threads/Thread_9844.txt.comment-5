I reset the modem to factory defaults and tried it again and got the same results.
Still a moderate NAT.
I thought maybe the issue was the fact the router isn't certified for the xbox but if you have no issues then that's probably not it.
I tried to upgrade to the latest firmware and it said none was available.
