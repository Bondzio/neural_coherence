murphy's law says that your external backup drive will cease to function the first time you really need it, no matter how long you have owned it or how many times you have used it.
having been involved with computers since 1971, i've seen most of the worst case horror stories up close & personal, including &quot;our data center burned up last night with all of our backups in it&quot;... (not my doings!)
i suggest you purchase at least one additional backup device - the cost is so much less than five years ago!
my personal preference is for three devices - grandfather, father & son, and you should keep at least two of these at a different location than your computer, like at work or in a safety deposit box.
i saw a 500gb external drive today for $59, so the cost is minimal to actually have 3 separate backups.
