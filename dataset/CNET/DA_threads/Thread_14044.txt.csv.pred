1.2.1	Then plug that into your LAN and follow HP 's instructions for printing over the LAN .	St
1.2.2	A print server would only serve to waste time and money .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I ca n't plug the printer into the LAN .	St
1.3.2	Well , I could but it would n't work .	St
1.3.3	All the computers , or anything else plugged into the LAN , at sikorsky have special chips in them .	St
1.3.4	No chip , no access .	St

1.4.1	Your IT staffer needs to get involved .	St
1.4.2	They have a secure LAN and even with a print server this will be quite a mess .	St
1.4.3	Let your IT staffer do their magic .	St
