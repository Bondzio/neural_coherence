i am not going to build one now or in the next month or so, but i was just curious about what cpu might be the best right now considering that vista will be 64-bit and..the virtual ocean of cpu options.
i am not a 'gamer' so i won't need a top of the line system, but i do have a level of performance that i expect from my pc.
right now i have an athlon64 3200 with 1gig of pc3200 ram and a 128mb agp 8x video card.
i would like to experience the next level of performance in the next year or so being as my system is only about 1 year old now.
thanks much for the opinions and recommendations.
ciao, rocco
