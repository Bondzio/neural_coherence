the main thing is that you are the only one who can decide what you need and when you need it.
i just purchased a new computer by walking into our local &quot;you build it shop&quot; and told the owner what i wanted to do with it and let him make suggestions to see if we were on the same page.
i will pick it up this wed. after he checks it out.
i wanted a graphics oriented computer that could handle the things i wanted to do without me growing grayer in the process.
i had been debating a bare bones and me doing the work but with a 3 yr old in the house i decided to let someone else put it together this time.
by the way, this new computer is not a &quot;need&quot; but an &quot;i want&quot;.
