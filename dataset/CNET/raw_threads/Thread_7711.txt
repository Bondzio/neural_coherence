I need to know which one is a better deal. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150254&ATT=14-150-254&CMP=OTC-C173T&nm_mc=OTC-C173T&cm_mmc=OTC-C173T-_-Video+Cards-_-XFX-_-14150254 or http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127281 The clock speed on the GT is higher than the GTX but the GTX has more memory. I'll be playing games like Oblivion, call of duty 4, fear, crysis, UT4, etc. Most of the time fast paced so i need something that will not let me down in my aiming :P Thanks -MrCoffee

The other thing is ... if you're set on the 768MB GTX...looks like there may be better choices than the MSI...like the eVGA or the BFG. Good Luck and let us know. VAPCMD
