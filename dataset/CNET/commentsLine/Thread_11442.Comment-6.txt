sorry i neglected to understand that this is a work laptop and therefore a member of a different workgroup.
but it's still simple to join your home workgroup when needed.
hold down the windows logo key and press the pause/break key.
on the system properties box select the computer name tab and click the change button.
select the workgroup option and enter the name of the workgroup you want to join.
you will have to restart the computer.
