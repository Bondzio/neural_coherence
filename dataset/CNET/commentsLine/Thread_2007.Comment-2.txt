it depends on what you use it for.
it seems good, except for the graphics card.
if you intend to do any kind of gaming, you will want a seperate graphics card with its own memory.
i have an hp, and i'm happy with it, but you also might want to look into emachines.
i'm not sure about their quality, though.
