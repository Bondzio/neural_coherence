I just put in a DVR-108 into my computer; however, the computer does not seem to see that it is there.
I can play a movie on it or a cd, but not record to it.
I never received an installation CD and I got the firmware already.
Still no go.
Can someone help please b/c I know that I'm doing something wrong!
