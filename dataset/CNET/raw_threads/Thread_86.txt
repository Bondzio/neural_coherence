I have an external Hard Drive, as detailed above, that presumably needs drivers to mount in my Mac OS X 10.3 Panther on iBook G3. Can't find any drivers and it's looking maybe as if the drive doesn't have any for Mac OS X. Any thoughts?

Unfortunately, your iBook only has USB 1.0 and not enough power up the USB chain to power the drive which could result in a non-mounting drive. If there is a connection on the drive enclosure for an external power supply, that would cover that problem and the drive would mount with no problem. I say, No Problem. You would still be left with the slow USB 1 transfer speeds. What is that, 12Mbs? P
