<s> I have storage on external hd and backup on another external hd, but I still want to put everything on dvd disc or something, as well. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend a reliable brand? </s>
<s> How many gigs can you get on one disc these days? </s>
<s> The one's I've been using are 4.7 but I would like more. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I've had stellar luck with HP, Sony, Maxwell and ahhh!! </s>
<s> I see a trend here. </s>
<s> The &quot;names&quot;. </s>
<s> That is, nothing but the names we know. </s>
<s> More about handling and storage at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=care+and+handling+of+cds+and+dvds&btnG=Google+Search&aq=1&oq=care+and+han I can't tell you how often people show me a DVD that won't read and it's covered in fingerprints or scrapped. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Robert, pretty much pointed out buy brand name discs. </s>
<s> Don't be cheap maybe on a sale or two, buy what you need. </s>
<s> I tend to favor Philips and TEAC though many other names do fine. </s>
<s> DVDs are in the 4.7gb range for now, unless you get into Blu-Ray, etc., but that's a costly alternative. </s>
<s> http://www.blu-ray.com/faq/ For now unless you got globs of data to store, std. </s>
<s> DVD will do fine. </s>
<s> Remember to treat critical DVDs like your new born, with care. </s>
<s> besides writing the data, be sure to verify! </s>

<s> or has any one make tests on them; but I uses GQ (the least expensive of them all)..and it hasn't fail me yet. </s>
<s> That's really a tough question to answer. </s>
<s> Yeah, 4.7 for single layer, 8.7 or there about for double layer and the newest is 25 for bru-ray. </s>
<s> Ask 6people and you will get at least 7 answers! </s>
<s> I think the point Bob implies is very important, use a good branded disk, not the cheap spikes you can pick up at the computer fairs. </s>
<s> For CDs, my preference is Imation and for DVDs Titanium single layer 4.7 MB (the brand, not the metal!). </s>
<s> For anything important, be sure to use -R and not -RW, the erasable disks do decay quicker. </s>
<s> And also as Bob mentions, do store them correctly - I use regular width cases with a black back to keep the light away from the recorded surface or better yet, the fully enclosed black DVD cases. </s>
<s> Keep them cool, dry and out of direct sunlight and handle only with the edges. </s>
<s> and don't go sticking labels on the disks - write a disk number in the clear bit in the middle and then label the cases, not the disks. </s>
<s> Quality does matter as does how it works with your burner. </s>
<s> Go to the web site for your burner. </s>
<s> There will be recommendations for what works best. </s>
<s> Do not use RW discs for long term storage. </s>
<s> Do not use any packet writing programs such as Drag to Disc, InCD, etc. </s>
<s> These are programs that require you to format the disc before you use them and allow you to simply drag the file to an icon on your desktop. </s>
<s> The idea was good but in practice, it is flawed. </s>
<s> Most of the people I work with say that Taiyo Yuden are the best. </s>
<s> They must be bought online. </s>
<s> Verbatim and Fujifilm (the ones made in Japan; not Taiwan) are also good. </s>
