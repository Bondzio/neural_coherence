my usual list: 1. big whopping power supply.
no mention of your complete machine parts list, but i often just pop in a 450 watt psu and try again.
2. set the fsb (a bios setting) from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 mhz.
(beats crashing and hair loss) 3. pull the case cover, point a fan at the internals.
4. just one stick of ram.
then try another stick.
don't not count that the ram works in another machine.
needs to work in this machine.
best of luck, bob
