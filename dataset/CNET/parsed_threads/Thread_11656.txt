<s> You can sift through http://www.tomshardware.com/motherboard/20040119/ to see that even from PC2700 to PC3200 it will be doubtful you could tell any real difference except in a benchmark. </s>

<s> If you buy the faster memory it will still run at the speed of your FSB. </s>
<s> That will not change with faster memory, so the speed will be no different. </s>
<s> You would have to boost the FSB and that would require at least a processor upgrade (if not a motherboard upgrade as well). </s>
<s> Buying faster memory expecting to use it in the future is almost always a waste of time, because the memory requirements change every couple of years, and that memory will most likely not be fast enough for your next system. </s>
