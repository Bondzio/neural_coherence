It's currently plugged into an HD5850 1680x1050 however also tried it with an X1600 pro from my laptop same resolution. Tried with both Windows 7 and OSX 10.6.2 I've followed the user guide found at the manufacturers site and done the auto adjust, tinkered with brightness and contrast and tested both the DVI-D and VGA ports. Both exhibiting the same behavior with 3 different cables and a laptop with DVI out along with my main PC. I'm confident it's a problem with the monitor. I'm not sure if this is the appropriate forum for this question but I'm hoping someone may have had this same problem with this monitor or could shed some light on a resolution. Hah what a horrible pun that makes. Thanks in advance!

You can see if said monitor has a menu and any RESET options but today, here, now, the repair rates exceed the cost of a new monitor. Unless it is in warranty you know to quickly dispose of this thing. Bob

Also, research BAD CAPS on google. Yes, these are afflicting displays and too many other electronic gear. In short: 1. Resets. 2. Bad Caps. 3. Bad solder work. Hope this gives you some ideas. Bob

Most gamma charts consist of an arrangement of black and white patterns and solid tones. You estimate gamma by viewing the chart from sufficient distance (typically one to two meters from the monitor).
