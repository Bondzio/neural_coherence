yea, i did finally get a hold of someone over there that wanted to help me figure out what is happening, he said since i ran the ntune stress test and it passed fine that it is likely nothing at all wrong with the card.
he suggested taking a spare hdd and loading windows, the drivers, and one game and try it taht way to rule out some software (like norton) isnt the root of the issue.
i'll going to work on that later on, let you know what is happening.
thanks again
