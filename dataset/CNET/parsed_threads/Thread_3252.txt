<s> I will be graduating from college in May and my parents have decided to buy my a new computer for a graduation gift (...didn't really expect one but can't say no if they offer). </s>
<s> They said that they would be willing to shell out $2000 and I could possibly add another $1000-$1500 onto that because I really want to get an amazing computer right now that will last me a while. </s>
<s> $3000-$3500 isn't enough for a quad core, so I'm looking at Core 2 Duos, like the E6600, something with 4 MB cache. </s>
<s> I also would like to get a high end graphics card (something that I would be able to play games on for a while like the new GeForce 8800s) and either 2 or 4 GB RAM. </s>
<s> I've looked at several companies, but have ruled out Dell and Gateway now because I can't really find what I'm looking for at a price I'd want. </s>
<s> Other companies that I've looked at were Velocity Micro, Polywell, Mediagear, ABS, and Cyberpower PC. </s>
<s> Cyberpower PC seems to have the best deal, but I've read lots of user reviews about them, most not good and include PCs DOA. </s>
<s> So I wanted to see what other people think about which company I should go with based on their experiences with the different companies out there. </s>
<s> I've been impressed so far with Polywell and ABS but don't know much about them. </s>
<s> I'm also open to other suggestions of companies to look at. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> building ur own comp? </s>
<s> its well worth it because u get to choose the parts u want in it and almost every aspect of your pc. </s>
<s> u can make one heck of a pc with 2 grand man. </s>
<s> and even if u dont know how to build one just go to comp usa or your local pc shop and they will assemble it for you for a small price. </s>
<s> hope this helps goodluck with your pc </s>
<s> I build, mostly because I then at least know what is there. </s>
<s> The OS disk will be complete and the drivers will be the right ones for at least the first time I turn the PC on. </s>
<s> I use AMD when I build. </s>
<s> Many of the computers I have had to fix using computer companies restore disks leave me wondering what I have installed. </s>
<s> Over the years I have come up with some things to look for when buying/shopping for a main stream PC. </s>
<s> Often my gaming computer of today becomes my workhorse computer 6 months to a year later, so I would buy with that in mind. </s>
<s> Look at the next generation operating system and look at what are the minimum specifications to run the newest software that you might be interested in using. </s>
<s> Try and find out if the new computer can be up-graded. </s>
<s> It should come with a restore disk system. </s>
<s> You need to read carefully to see what is shipped, some companies require you to burn your own restore CDs or charge more for restore disks. </s>
<s> Hard drives fail and this restore system is needed if you fail to have a backup system in place that is self-installing/bootable (without operating system in place). </s>
<s> Most restore systems work by formatting the drive so you will lose your data. </s>
<s> If you want the computer back the way you had it you must have a good backup system in place and use it. </s>
<s> The software bundled with the PC should be what you want not OEM (original equipment manufacturer) software that has a poor uninstall track record and may not have all the features you want. </s>
<s> I have had to remove OEM anti-virus software at the registry level so watch out for this (I have done this on 2 Compaq computers). </s>
<s> I would go with as little as possible installed software and then purchase exactly what you want later. </s>
<s> This way when you install after a crash you will have the software on hand and your chance of getting support is more likely if you have a retail copy of the software. </s>
<s> OEM add on cards will work but, watch out, some companies make a point not to support their OEM products versus their retail products. </s>
<s> I once had new drivers to install but because the sound card was OEM the company that built the computer had to supply the drivers. </s>
<s> The company that had their name on the card denied me the use of their new drivers. </s>
<s> I had to keep the old drivers. </s>
<s> Dont get fancy OEM optical drives installed. </s>
<s> I have found that external USB optical drives are more usable for me because I can move them around and if they dont work I can take them back to the store without opening the case and voiding the warranty. </s>
<s> I have also had OEM optical drives that almost worked, I mean the drive would do just enough that I could not ask for a new one but not as good as I needed. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that specs don't tell all. </s>
<s> Check posts of customer's to see if there are problems that you can't work around. </s>
<s> Do this by finding the model number of the computer you are interested in and do a search on it. </s>
<s> Read the posts that seem to show problem areas. </s>
<s> In the past, I have found complaints about slow remote controls to motherboards being replaced. </s>
<s> (From your post you are already doing this.) </s>
<s> The goal of the company selling the computer is to keep cost low and one way they do this is by using a small/weak power supply (and some other components). </s>
<s> They select the power supply size by what the power consumption specs of the parts it is sold with use. </s>
<s> The computer will usually work until you up grade with a power hungry video card or additional hard drives. </s>
<s> This often shows up as failed boot ups, sometimes requiring 3 boots before the computer is stable or artifacts appearing on the screen from nowhere. </s>
<s> So keep this in mind when planning to up grade your main stream PC, a new high power video card may require a new bigger power supply. </s>
<s> If the new PC arrives and you dont like it take it back. </s>
<s> I have returned as many as 3 PCs when buying just one. </s>
<s> I took one back because it was broken out of the box. </s>
<s> 2 more because the software I wanted to run would not run, by the specs the software should have run. </s>
<s> I went through 2 model upgrades and 2 computer companies before I found what I wanted and that had to be built to order. </s>
<s> This was made easier by the computer store I used being next door to where I worked. </s>
<s> When returning the PCs I used the supplied restore disks to clean them up. </s>
<s> More thoughts when buying direct or online. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Read the return polices of the vendors you are interested in with the idea you may have to use their return policy. </s>
<s> Look for full refund not just exchanges. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> When prices are close, watch for low price computer but high handling and shipping fees. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Watch for OS being preloaded with no OS CD included, may need to pay more for real CD. </s>
<s> If you ask for real OS CD and pay for it, make sure you get it. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Dont throw away the packaging, you may need it to move it or to send it back. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Don't forget to get a UPS to plug the new computer into. </s>
<s> Clean power into the the computer will extend it life and keep crashes due to power failures at bay. </s>
<s> I have onwed Compaq, Gateway, HP, and Dell. </s>
<s> All of them worked but I was never happy with them and that is why I build my own now. </s>
<s> The perfect PC is just a compromise of what you want and what you can get. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> They've been doing reviews of gaming desktops while posing as a 'regular' buyer, not a review site. </s>
<s> So, they tell you how well a system performs and how well the vendor did assembling, shipping, and supporting the system. </s>
<s> http://consumer.hardocp.com/reviews.html?cat=MjUsRGVza3RvcCBDb21wdXRlcnMsaGNvbnN1bWVy </s>
<s> I'd recommend going with the highest clock speed Core 2 Duo you can get, if you are going to build your desktop. </s>
<s> With that huge budget, you should try to get two nVidia 8800 GTX graphics cards in SLi mode (where they work together) and a good motherboard. </s>
<s> Also try to get a HDD over 300 GB, since you'll need a lot of space for the video games. </s>
<s> At least a gig of ram, preferably two gigs, are implied. </s>
<s> And make sure you have a good power supply and case, and that everything is compatible - or you may end up with a fried computer. </s>
<s> :) Hope this helps... </s>
