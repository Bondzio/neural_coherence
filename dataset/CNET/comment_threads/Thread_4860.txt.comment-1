I have my internal hard drive set up with 3 partitions.
on the 1st partition I have XP sp1.
I use that for a backup operating system.
On the 2nd partition I have XP sp3 and I use it as my primary operating system.
The 3rd partition is the largest and I use it just for storage.
I dont really need it because I recently purchased a large external drive.
I really want to try the Linux based Ubuntu operating system.
Can I install it on the 3rd partition?
