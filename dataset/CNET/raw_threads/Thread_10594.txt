I have a HP Photosmart c309a multifunction printer. Unable to connect wifi (ad hoc) from laptop to printer for wireless printing. I created SSID and still can not print anything. Printer LCD display shows symbal that it is doing something but in the end it does nothing but eventially say there is no connection. HP service reps are no help and appear to not really know much about basic stuff. Could some one please help me. I am pulling my hair out. Oh yeah, software is loaded too.

I needed to remove the default printer software that came with my laptop. (Not that I received a printer. Not sure why this was on my computer) I then told my pc to look again for the printer. Other things that may have helped but not sure it really mattered in my case was checking the firewall protection is not to strong and making sure that my pc was set to share with other devices.
