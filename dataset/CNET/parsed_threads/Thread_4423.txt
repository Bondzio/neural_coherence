<s> Hello before I state my problem, i'll list my computer specs Computer 1 MB: GIGABYTE GA-K8NXP-SLI CPU: AMD FX-55 RAM: 2 gigs This computer has two lan ports on the MB, 1 is 10/100 mbps and other at 10/100/1000 mbps. </s>
<s> Computer 2 MB: ASUS A8V-VM CPU: AMD 64 3000+ RAM: 1 gigs This computer had one lan port on the MB rated 10/100 and has a addon pci lan port rated 10/100/1000/2000 (TRENDnet TEG-PCITXR) Right now on each computer the non 1000 lan ports are being used to connect to a router for the internet. </s>
<s> The other two 1000 lan ports are connected together with a crossover wire rated CAT6 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812117854 all the ips and gateways are setup and everything works but the speed. </s>
<s> if you look at status and task manager it says the connection is 1gbps but when i transfer it only clips at 100 mbps. </s>
<s> so in the task manager is only 1%. </s>
<s> How can i sove my problem? </s>
<s> I also forgot to mention Computer 1 Western Digital Caviar 250GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s Computer 2 Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive </s>

<s> Someone tried that here and what a mess to setup. </s>
<s> It didn't work well until we changed to this setup. </s>
<s> internet-&gt;modem-&gt;router-&gt;1Gb Switched Hub-&gt;PCs. </s>
<s> And you can imagine all the whining &quot;it should work...&quot; over and over but we had the 1Gb Hub so it didn't take long to setup. </s>
<s> There's a lesson here somewhere but I won't write more about it. </s>
