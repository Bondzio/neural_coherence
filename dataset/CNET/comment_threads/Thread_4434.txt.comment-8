Not that it's too far from the clients (how far?)
but I found a router buried under books and it was simply overheating.
Try moving it so that all the bigger sides are exposed to air so it's a little cooler.
I take it that you power cycled the router... -&gt; Sadly it looks like the router needs to be swapped out at this point.
Sometimes the firmware version matters.
Since you are not sharing details I can't look into that issue.
