soolshock, from the other side of the world, thanks for your tip.
first, i lost 2 working days fixing for &quot;hotoffers&quot; spy-ware.
after finally fixed the spyware problems using spydoctor, adaware & hijackthis, this &quot;autoexec.nt&quot; problem occurred.
i think it was caused by one of the anti-spyware accidentally removing it.
fortunately, your tip fixed it.
thanks for suggesting the link.
i could've used the microsoft's suggested solution (  ), but being such a novice user, i am sure i would've done more damage than repaired it.
