Thanks for all the great info guys!
I'm still kind of confused though.
I have the manual that came with the motherboard right in front of me and it shows to use the connections I said in the original post.
I don't see anything else in it where it shows a different set of connectors for front panels.
Thanks for your help though, I'll look again
