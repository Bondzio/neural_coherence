I live in a long ranch house. On one end I have my desktop computer and a Netgear WNDR3300 wireless router. In another room, approximately 70 feet away, is another desktop computer that is not near a cable jack so I'm using a D-Link AirPremier DWL-G550 PCI card with antenna to connect to the Internet. The connection is so-so and reception depends on the placement of the antenna. Approximately 20 feet further away is a Wii which cannot detect the wireless signal. I would like to replace the router with one that has a stronger signal that is able to reach the 90+ feet necessary to establish good connections to the computer and Wii. Are newer routers able to dependably cover long distances? Most usually have disclaimers about walls, building materials, etc. What I don't want is to buy a new router and spend several hours setting it up only to find that it's no better than the one I have now. I was looking at the Asus RT-N56U model. I would appreciate any opinions on this or other models that would solve my problem. Thanks.

I will write the DWL-G550 is a card that was indeed SO-SO and using another antenna helped. This is why we have other solutions like moving the router to a central location or using a second router as a WAP. Sorry but the answer is no. Bob

OK, now that we know that routers don't have &quot;more power&quot; or vary greatly in distance, what can we do? 1. Location, location, location., There are many that for whatever reason will not place the router in the central location (or worse, in the basement!) These folk are best left alone to let them buy enough routers until it sinks in. This is not mean at all. It's how many folk learn. 2. With location our of the way, the basic settings are covered in the CNET Forums often. Let's repeat them. Router Defaults, except for what the ISP wants. Then we change the SSID to simple things. SHORT IS GOOD! Never hide the SSID and switch to WPA2 AES/PSK (WPA if your gear does not do WPA2). Finally we may change the channel. 3. NO 2.4GHz cordless phones allowed. Hope this helps, Bob

If all routers are distance limited then why, if I do a network search, does the computer pick up signals (sometimes moderately strong) from the neighbors routers which are certainly more than 100 feet away? 3. I've heard about gizmos you can buy (that you place in other parts of the house) that boost the router's signal so you can cover more distance. Do these things work? 4. My phones are Panasonic DECT 6.0.

You get dark and light spots. The same is true with RF. It's not an even distribution and a spot could be better because of a bounce or other reflection. 3. Gizmos. I never use them. I use well worn solutions such as &quot;HOW TO USE A ROUTER AS A WAP&quot; (google that) since it's cheap, effective and I am sure of what it does and the boost in the coverage. No gizmos. In short I can use a 25 to 50 foot ethernet cable to my ROUTER AS A WAP towards the spot that isn't so hot and I've good. If the ethernet cable is verboten, I can use a powerline bridge to the router as a wap. Bob

I read reviews on many of these (mostly Netgear, Linksys and D-Link) and most got many bad comments. I was ready to give up when I ran across a relatively new model by Diamond, the WR300N. It had almost uniformly good reviews so I decided to try it out. It took me about 15 minutes to set it up, and I'm glad to report that it works like a charm. I plugged it in about 50 feet from my router and now both the desktop computer and Wii at the other end of the house have strong wireless signals. If you can't move your router or use a router as a WAP I suggest trying out this product.
