sorry for the long delay on this.
i hope that you all haven't been holding your collective breath, awaiting my answer about which speakers i got.
i considered all the speakers i mentioned, plus a three-part set at j&r, and ended up the with harman jbl ones.
they're a little funny-looking, but they are compact and have lovely sound and had the virtue of being on sale for $15 less than the usual price.
i am pleased with them.
i do wish there were some way to turn off their lights without taking the plug out.
usually, i don't bother, but with the cable modem, the router and the speakers all on (and the other two of them blinking lights constantly), i feel like an energy waster on a big scale.
my environmental bona fides is at a new low.
(multiplied by all the others who are doings as i am doing, it's a lot of energy use.)
but the cable guy told me never to turn off the modem, and i've no idea what turning off or unplugging the router would do, so i go on, a bit shamefacedly, letting them all glow or blink without hindrance.
&lt;sigh&gt; thank you for the guidance, p. the radio shack speakers were just fine, but i found the harman jbl sound mellower, and though that wasn't what i started out looking for, it caught me, unawares.
i listened to a schubert string quintet the other day and was surprised by how pleased i was, being able to listen and work in the same room.
i hope that everyone's new year will play out happily and successfully.
