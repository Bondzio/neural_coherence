for the games listed, you might see some improvement with more ram but tweaking may help more.
for example, battlefield 2 can consume &gt;1gb on its own but you can reduce ram usage and stuttering by setting texture quality to medium.

2gb will be the power-user setting when vista debuts early next year, so if you plan to keep the pc for 18+ months, a ram upgrade may be more worthwile.
but if you plan to get a new pc in 2007, tweak what you've got.
