Thanks for the perspective R. Proffitt.
It's interesting you refer to these machines as &quot;high end.&quot; Both manufacturers (Gateway for the intel, ZT Systems for the AMD) bill these machines as Home/Home Office and the prices of $499 and $599 suggest &quot;medium&quot; computers!
The reviews I can find for the Gateway (SX2802-03) say it's &quot;whisper quiet.&quot; Can't find any pro reviews on the ZT but other ZT systems are reported to be loud as you suggest.
I generally keep my computers for 5-7 years and don't generally &quot;upgrade&quot; them with the likes of fancy video or sound cards, or additional drives.
I think either will meet my needs for several years so will probably go with the Gateway since it is a small form factor size and &quot;whisper quiet&quot;!
Thanks again for your input.
