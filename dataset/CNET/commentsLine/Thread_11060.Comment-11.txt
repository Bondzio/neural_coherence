i have kept my desktop as xp professional, and will do so until the cartridges are finished.
i would have to buy a new laser printer so am hoping this one will last quite awhile longer.
it would be great if there were new drivers to work with my vista 64 bit laptop .

.
if anyone knows of any i would love to hear where to find them.
