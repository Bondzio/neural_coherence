1.1.1	hey guys , i am getting my first custom PC this weekend have a couple questions on what ya 'll recommend and what all i can do with this PC set up specs are ... Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L ( rev .	St
1.1.2	2.0 ) Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33GHz , 45nm , 1333MHz FSB , 4MB L2 Cache Logisys 700Watt PSU 5 or 6gb ( cant remember ) DDR2 PC6400 800MHz Dual Channel ( expandable to 8GB DDR3 1066MHz DC ) Seagate 320GB HDD 7200RPM 16MB Cache 512MB Video GeForce Forsa 6600 will this set up run win7 x64 good ?	Ques
1.1.3	i know the video card isnt too new , would i need a new one to run windows 7 x64 better than with the one thats in it ?	Ques
1.1.4	do ya 'll recommend upgrading to 8gb ddr3 ?	Ques
1.1.5	or should i stick with what i have for now .	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	It 's a nice system .	St
1.2.2	It will run Windows 7 x64 just fine .	St
1.2.3	However , what do you use your PC for ?	Ques
1.2.4	You called out the graphics card , so I 'm guessing you are a gamer or like to watch videos or both .	St
1.2.5	The one thing that stood out to me was the hard drive .	St
1.2.6	Seems pretty small , but if you do n't need to store a ton of music , photos , or videos , than it 's probably fine .	St
1.2.7	I would n't worry about going to 8GB RAM right away , but if you think you will want to do that , I would instead recommend going with the fastest RAM your mobo supports and make sure you get the largest memory sticks for each socket .	St
1.2.8	Even if that means you get only 4GB of RAM to start .	St
1.2.9	That way , if you want to upgrade later to more memory , you wo n't have to throw out any old sticks to make room for newer ones .	St
1.2.10	Good luck and let us know how you like your new setup .	St
1.3.1	im not wanting to do a whole lot , i do watch movies and tv shows on my comp and would like to hook it up to my 24 & quot ; tv as well ive just been looking at the graphics card and it just seems old , i have just started getting into computers lately and just not up to date on what everything can do .	St
1.3.2	just didnt know if the graphics card would hold up windows 7 x64 bit and not be laggy or anything .	St
1.3.3	ya the HDD is a little small i will def .	St
1.3.4	end up getting a new one pretty soon to add to that one and have 2 externals so i am good for storage for now .	St
1.3.5	im mainly wanting to dual/triple boot OS X , Windows 7 , and Linux ( idk which one yet ) i dont do a whole lot of gaming as of now , but i think with the new system i will start to for sure .	St
1.3.6	just not sure how stable my graphics card is .	Res
1.3.7	thanks for the feedback , appreciate it .	Polite
1.4.1	Best if both are HDMI , second would be DVI , and third would be a way to send component video to your TV .	St
1.4.2	Otherwise , I think you 'll be fine .	St
1.4.3	Sure , a better graphics card is good , but my own experience says do n't spend the money now if it 's something you & quot ; think & quot ; you might do .	St
1.4.4	You may find you like doing other things on your new PC and do n't have time to get into gaming .	St
1.4.5	You can always upgrade the graphics card later , and since you 're getting into computing , you 'll probably find it 's a pretty easy upgrade .	St
1.4.6	Good luck !	Polite
1.5.1	My graphics card is good enough for now to run everything smoothly correct ?	Ques
1.5.2	That 's the main thing I 'm worried about is that my graphics card is a little out of date .	St
1.5.3	And that my system wo n't run windows 7 smoothly .	St
1.5.4	I 'm sure in the future I will be upgrading to a newer one but for now if I do n't have to then I do n't want to worry about that .	St
1.5.5	Thanks for the help !	St
1.6.1	that system will run windows 7 perfectly .	St
1.6.2	i have win7 running on a desktop and laptop , with much lower spec 's all round .	St
1.6.3	you mention triple booting with OSX .	St
1.6.4	that might be a problem .	St
1.6.5	osx is a bit iffy when not installing on apple 's chosen hardware so i 'd do some research that your components are OSX compatible .	St
1.6.6	other than that , you 'll be fine	St
1.7.1	just make sure there 's a win7 driver for the graphics card	St
1.8.1	hey mate , that 's an awesome configuration you got there and windows 7 x64 will easily run on it .	St
1.8.2	No doubt about that .	St
1.8.3	However , for such a system i advice having more space on external hard disk than in built .	St
1.8.4	320 GB is cool , but it 's better you get an external hard disk of any size you want .	St
1.8.5	Save most of your data on it rather than your inbuilt space .	St
1.8.6	this advice is coming out from the worst experience i had with high end systems .	St
1.8.7	But all in all , fantastic configuration you got there .	St
