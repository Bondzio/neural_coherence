12458	0	55908	666015	NR	JustBill	1/8/05 6:16 AM	1.10516496E12	SCSI Scanner	I had a SCSI scanner installed in my old computer but don't see a port I could use to plug it into on my new computer. My current computer is a Dell model 4700 P-4 with Win XP Home operating system with 512 Ram. Is there any type adapter that would allow me to use a PCI card slot for a SCSI scanner? As you can see I'm not all that knowledgeable so if my question is ridiculous try not to laugh. Thanks
