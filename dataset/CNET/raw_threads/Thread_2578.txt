I've decided to buy a refurbished Refurbished iMac 20-inch 2.4GHz with 1GB of memory and 320GB hard drive. I know refurbished iMacs work fine because my friend has one and he says there is no difference. But the one problem I had was with the low memory. I have these questions about that topic: -Do you think it's a good idea to add an extra stick of RAM? -How much more memory (max is 4GB)? -Should I buy the RAM from Apple or from another, cheaper company? -Will there be a difference in speed? I really appreciate your advice, Thanks!
