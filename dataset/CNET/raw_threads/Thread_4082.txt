Any advice would be appreciated for I am not that technically savvy. Questions: 1. Where should I buy? Online retailer vs. Electronics store? Which online retailers? 2. What brand? Name brands vs. other companies? Ebay? I need something that I can play games on, but also something that also acts like a media center. 3. Is a dual core processor worth the price? And finally, any other PC buying advice or tips. Thanks a lot.

I did not see it in the Specs, but still wanted to check. The Dual COre one looks like a great deal I think, but am interested in having the TV tuner feature
