I am running XP Home on an Emachines T3624 2.66GHz Celeron (Coppermine I think) with 256MB of mem of unknown specs.
I am considering upgrading the mem to 1GB and need help determining which mem to buy.
Crucial indicates that sticks of PC 2700 or PC 3200 are compatible with my system.
Being that the CPU is only 2.66GHz, would the PC 3200 stick be a problem if installed by it self (w/o the currently installed 256MB?)
Might the PC 3200 installed alone actually make the transfer rate of my machine faster than the 2700 would (I'm guessing &quot;fat change&quot;?)
Here's the Crucial page I am referring to: http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/viewscanbyid.aspx?id=216014FC31D926C3 Thanks.
