my daughter tripped over hdmi cable connected to my video card.
since that happend my pc has been turning itself off.
to make things funny it only happen when standing.
when i put pc on the side it works fine.
i replaced video card and power supply unit, no good.
it looks to me, there is some loose connection or something gets overheat, but how can i figure out what?
