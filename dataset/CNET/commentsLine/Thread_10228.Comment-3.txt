yes the upgrades will void your warranty, but only to a point.
the new hardware will not be covered, but if you have a problem, you can restore the original configuration to have the unit serviced.
(put the old video card back in & remove the new memory.)
as for upgrading the memory, i hope you have deep pockets because the dimension 8250 used rdram which is very expensive.
rdram memory sticks must be installed in matching pairs and 2 sticks of 256mb is currently running between $200 and $250.
good luck.
