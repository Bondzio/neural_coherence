Thanks for responding to my post.
Perhaps I did not make myself clear.
I replaced the original hard drive with an identical one [same manufacturer, same size, same model] and I installed the same O/S.
everything worked.
When I removed the new drive and replaced the old drive, the problem shows up.
There is nothing wrong with the motherboard, USB ports, mouse or keyboard.
The problem exists within the O/S for the original hard drive.
I do not want to reinstall the O/S to the original drive because I will then loose critical files.
I need to be able to find the problem with the original drive's O/S and repair withiut having to reformat it.
