Both have internet but I can't share files or my printer. I am not sure if I set up my network right or what. When I go to My Network Places on my desktop I see the other computer but when I try that on the other computer I don't see my computer. Also when I try to set up my printer for file sharing it says &quot;Printer Settings could not be saved. Operation could not be completed&quot; I am not sure what to do.

Be sure the workgroup name is the same on both computers. I don't know what operating systems you are running so you might need to follow the prompt to create a network setup disk to run on the 2nd computer.
