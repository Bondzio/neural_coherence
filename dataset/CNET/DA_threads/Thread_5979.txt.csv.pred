1.1.1	I am trying to find learning material for Decimal to Hex and Hex to Decimal conversion but cannot find any?	St
1.1.2	Is it simply the case i have to use a Binary conversion as a middle man?	St
1.1.3	Thanks All	Polite
1.2.1	http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Hexadecimal http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgVc1Tl-JDA The other way around, from hex to decimal is easier.	St
1.2.2	Last digit + 16 * previous digit + 256 * previous digit and so on.	St
1.2.3	So DEF hex = 15(F) + 16 * 14(E) + 256*13(D).	St
1.2.4	By the way, this is mathematics, not networking.	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	Hi Kees, Yes it is maths but the maths used in networking for M.A.C AND I.P address translation.	St
