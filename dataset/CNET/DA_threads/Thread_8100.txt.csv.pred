1.1.1	I just purchased a WD 500GB External Drive .	St
1.1.2	I know nothing about working with them , but want to use it mainly for backups and also store photos and music .	St
1.1.3	First , I would like to know just WHAT I actually Need to back up and how often.I wo n't need any office information , just general uses .	St
1.1.4	Also there is little information about how to back up .	St
1.1.5	I need to learn from scratch the very basics .	St
1.1.6	Would appreciate any help and information anyone can give me .	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks in advance .	St
1.1.8	Red	St
1.2.1	Hi Red I just recently started using an external drive as well .	St
1.2.2	What you actually need is a back up program , or just drag & drop .	St
1.2.3	There are a bunch of back up programs out there .	St
1.2.4	I do n't give much credence to the ones that come with Windows , if only due to failure in the past .	St
1.2.5	So if someone suggests one here , you may want to look into it .	St
1.2.6	You can check out some on Cnet , in the download area .	Sug
1.2.7	For automatic back up , that may be a great start .	St
1.2.8	I usually know where my files are ( saved to ) , so I drag them to the drive myself .	St
1.2.9	This way I know they are backed up .	St
1.2.10	It also gives me control of what is being copied .	St
1.2.11	I 've had some that backed up everything new or modified , including files I did n't want or deleted .	St
1.2.12	I know that Nero has a back up program that is n't too bad .	St
1.2.13	It does ask if you want it to back that file up , which can get bothersome .	St
1.2.14	They have a program called InCD , that was n't too bad , that just copied only the new files , in the folders you have already selected .	St
1.2.15	Some programs ( software ) , has a back up feature .	St
1.2.16	Just select the drive letter of your external , & they 'll do the rest .	St
1.2.17	How often you need to back up is up to you .	St
1.2.18	Or often .	St
1.2.19	Depends on how critical the file is ( or it 's loss ) .	St
1.2.20	A picture of someone vs. a shopping list .	St
1.2.21	Many people will have many answers .	St
1.2.22	Often & redundant is the best .	St
1.2.23	That is , every day & to two separate mediums ( drive , disc or online ) .	St
1.2.24	So from there , base it on your files & needs .	St
1.2.25	In a nutshell of learning .	St
1.2.26	The backup software will ask you where you want to back up to .	St
1.2.27	Your external drive will have a letter ( Not C ) .	St
1.2.28	Give the folder a name , or use their default one .	St
1.2.29	Like Redspix for your photos .	St
1.2.30	If it 's a group back up of everything , it may get a bit confusing at first , till you poke around & see what everything is called ( sub folders ) .	St
1.2.31	Meaning , a directory Redspix , will than have sub folders ( hopefully ) of your other stuff .	St
1.2.32	I use folders by date & sub folders in there .	St
1.2.33	Example : 01-01-10 is the folder , than folders off that like ; Christmas 2009 .	St
1.2.34	One final thing .	St
1.2.35	Make sure that your external drive shows up under my computer , as a separate drive , with a letter , & remember what that letter is .	Res
1.2.36	There will be an icon of a dive type shown , so it 's easier .	St
1.2.37	Hope this helps , I 'm sure you 'll have more questions as you learn more about it .	St
1.2.38	Just ask .	St
1.3.1	Thank you for the information about external .	St
1.3.2	Yes , I may have more questions later .	St
1.3.3	Thanks again , Red	St
1.4.1	Windows 7 has a nice backup..I tested it..it work .	St
1.4.2	Nero does as a responder stated ... it works .	St
1.4.3	I bet Roxio does also .	St
1.4.4	Check CNET downloads ... .plenty of programs .	St
1.4.5	Or just use an Cloning/Imaging programs like Macrium Reflect ( free ) and clone your whole harddrive every few weeks ... .paid version of it and ACRONIS allow you to clone just files/folders etc .	St
1.4.6	AND MOST IMPORTANT alot of these external drives come with SW to backup does yours ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.7	Did you read the booklet on it ?	Ques
1.4.8	?	Ques
1.5.1	Thanks for answering my post .	St
1.5.2	I finished backing up yesterday .	St
1.5.3	I used Windows 7 and , so far , everything seems to be ok. Will post again if I run into any problems .	St
1.5.4	Thanks again , Red	St
1.6.1	Do n't count on the ext .	St
1.6.2	HD for storage over extended periods of time .	St
1.6.3	If you review the horror stories on ext .	St
1.6.4	HDs , they do fail and/or become troublesome .	St
1.6.5	I suggest you consider seriously any true important data get saved/backup/copied/stored on media such as DVD or CD as 1 copy or more .	St
1.6.6	This need n't be everything but what you consider super critical at least .	St
1.6.7	Further , do n't treat your ext .	St
1.6.8	HD lightly , it can easily become a victim of mishandling or s/w corruption and this is normal mode .	St
1.6.9	While , I paint a dire picture here , its better to play safe than sorry .	St
1.6.10	Take due care ... tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	Yes , I understand most of the things about Back Up , but not everything .	St
1.7.2	When I purchased my computer , the first thing I did was make recovery disks .	St
1.7.3	I had one large external drive so I had a friend Ghost my computer after I went to Windows 7 .	St
1.7.4	I put that drive away for safe keeping .	St
1.7.5	I also made a repair disk .	St
1.7.6	So I am pretty well fixed for now .	St
1.7.7	I just want this disk for backing up important information about the PC on a regular basis and maybe add some photos and music .	St
1.7.8	Now , here 's the latest news that I may need some help with .	St
1.7.9	I thought I had this disk backed up , but now , not so sure .	St
1.7.10	When I go to Explorer and right click the drive-properties , it has zeros like nothing is on it .	St
1.7.11	It lists two headings that I used but when I click one , it brings up the restore box .	St
1.7.12	Thats the one I used after I did the install .	St
1.7.13	The other one is supposed to be the important information and when I click it , a message says that there is nothing to read it with .	St
1.7.14	Now , I really feel stupid and do n't know what to do .	St
1.7.15	Should I format the drive and start over ?	Ques
1.7.16	If so , could you explain to me just how to do the process ?	Ques
1.7.17	I thought I knew , but it seems like I did n't know what I was doing .	St
1.7.18	Sorry to make this so long , but thought you would need the entire story if you can help me .	St
1.7.19	Thanks again for any help you can give me .	St
1.7.20	Red	St
1.8.1	If you 're saying the ext .	St
1.8.2	backup disk is already corrupted , then reformat .	St
1.8.3	Use win7 own format routine and be NTFS type , provided of course whatever data is now coming from the working system .	St
1.8.4	Once done , use win7 own backup pgm .	St
1.8.5	for such .	St
1.8.6	Unless , you have other capable back-up ( vendor provided ) and win7 ready , do what you feel seems OK. Last , whenever using the ext .	St
1.8.7	HD be sure to actually dismount it via the s/w , once it says done , then unplug it .	St
1.8.8	If you want to save the current data , then google for & quot ; recovery s/w & quot ; , I believe the sticky post here as links as well , check it .	St
1.8.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	Here 's what I 've found.I may have it correctly backed up .	St
1.9.2	I went to & quot ; Computer & quot ; .	St
1.9.3	My Libraries and Drives are in left pane .	St
1.9.4	I click my external drive and properties .	St
1.9.5	It tells me that I have 72GBs on the drive .	St
1.9.6	That sounds about right for the things I backed up .	St
1.9.7	It has 2 items listed in right pane .	St
1.9.8	Under & quot ; RayPC & quot ; , Properties , it lists the GBs and other information about changes that I can make.The other item on the list is MediaID , which I assume is my personal information .	St
1.9.9	It opens in Word Pad .	St
1.9.10	There I find some letters and numbers that I ca n't tell anything about .	St
1.9.11	So , I guess I have the data on the external drive .	St
1.9.12	Is there anything else that I need to do , like make a special folder for it ?	Ques
1.9.13	I have it set to back up once a week , Sunday , so I 'll see if it automatic backs up .	St
1.9.14	Any other information that I might need would be appreciated .	St
1.9.15	Thanks for the help Red	St
1.10.1	About not counting 100 % on external hard drives for backup .	St
1.10.2	I had a 120 Gig drive I used to backup all files , documents , pictures and such .	St
1.10.3	I am also from the old school about always double covering yourself with anything important .	St
1.10.4	I have pictures that ca n't be replaced so I also burned everything to DVDs The external drive crashed after a year , but I really did n't lose anything because I have everything on DVD .	St
1.10.5	DVD/RW and CD/RW blank media is cheap and well worth the time and investment .	St
