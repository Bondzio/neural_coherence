<s> Hi all, i hope somebody can help me... My computer is a HP Laptop Model Number DV2815EA running windows vista 32 bit. </s>
<s> Its a few years old. </s>
<s> Recently i have had problems with my wireless adapter turning itself off whenever i watch videos online. </s>
<s> It doesn't happen all the time, but if i am watching something for more than an hour it will cut off. </s>
<s> There is a blue light and a switch on the front of the laptop, and when the wireless adapter is off, the light changes to red. </s>
<s> The light will change to red sometimes whilst watching video, and the only way i can turn the wireless back on is if i restart the system. </s>
<s> Even if i activate and disable the wireless adapter using the external manual switch, or the internal controls using the wireless assistant. </s>
<s> As you can imagine this gets very annoying when i am mid way through a show and it cuts out! </s>
<s> Also, not sure if this is relevant but i can no longer either watch videos on full screen as the image gets jolty. </s>
<s> Things i have tried; 1) restoring the system to a previous restore point - i tried this but for some reason the only restore points i could find were ones dated after i started noticing the problem. </s>
<s> 2) reinstalling the wireless adapter driver and video card driver. </s>
<s> 3) running a full 6 hour antivirus scan - I am using Eset NOD32 antivirus and also i scanned using comodo cleaning essentials. </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> We had to remove the internal wifi card and use an external usb wifi. </s>
<s> This has been done a few times and for those that insist on the shop replacing the internal card, we won't and if they insist we'll wrap it up and return the laptop. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> It costs too much to fix again when it fails again so we just don't do that anymore. </s>
<s> We remove the internal card since we need to cut the heat production inside the laptop as well as the failing card has proven itself to cause other machine errors. </s>
<s> Some owners can't accept this solution and all you can do is nod and hand the machine back. </s>
<s> Some have really been upset about that. </s>

<s> Bob, thanks for responding, is it easy to access the wireless card, or is it attached to the mother board? </s>
<s> Is under one of the covers on the bottom and the only item I forgot to mention is to tape the antenna ends up so they don't fly around and short out something. </s>
<s> Your first year tech knows how to do that. </s>
<s> There are now MANY USB wifi solutions for under 10 bucks so try a few. </s>
