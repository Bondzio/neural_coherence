hi, i am looking to replace my old netgear rangemax wireless router wpn 824v2 with one that meets the following criteria: 1. good range, my router will be in the basement and my gaming computer is 2 floors up from here.
2. much better speed, 300+ would be good.
i have been looking at the netgear wndr3700 is there a better one out there?
thank you
