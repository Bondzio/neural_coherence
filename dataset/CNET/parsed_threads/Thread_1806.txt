<s> we have an older computer made 2000-2001 probably, are master drive work by its self and so does the slave drive when the jumper is set to normal. </s>
<s> Also, the screen is acting up because it doesn't start from the beginning but when it says welcome the screen turns on,but when the master and slave are connected the don't turn on the screen. </s>
<s> Please help I can't figure it out </s>
<s> We would move the uncooperative drive to the second IDE channel. </s>
<s> Back then you would run into this. </s>
<s> Today, people are not going to accept such nutty things. </s>

<s> do i switch the ide? </s>
<s> I'm still have a problem with the screen not turning on at the very beginning when i turn the computer on it only turns with welcome </s>
<s> &quot;do i switch the ide?&quot; Your choice here. </s>
<s> As I noted above this is what we did years ago. </s>
<s> Today we encounter people that insist &quot;but this should work.&quot; We nod and wait for them to relent and let us fix it. </s>
