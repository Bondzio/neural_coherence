There are two yellow slots for DDR2 and two blue slots for DDR Ram.
You can put one stick in either of the two yellow slots (slot1 and 3) as single mode and have the computer boot up.
You can put two sticks in those slots and have dual channel mode.
This works for the blue slots as well.
If I put DDR ram into the two blue slots, it boots up fine...it's only the DDR2 (yellow slots) that gets whacked for some reason.
Hope this explains it better.
This is the last computer I will be building for sale so I know not to go with the ASRock mobo anymore.
Give me a reliable Abit or Gigabyte any day of the week.
