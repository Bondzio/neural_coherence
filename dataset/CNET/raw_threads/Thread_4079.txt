I bought my Dell 4550 series in 2002 and I'm in need of upgrading it or buying a new one. What do you think is the best thing to do? The specs are: Intel Pentium 4 Process at 2.0 GHZ, 256 DDR SDRAM at 266MHz, 30GB ultra ATA/ 100 Hard Drive 7200RPM. I use it for basic college work, downloading music (have maybe 600 songs & download 10/ per month), take plenty of pics and I'm looking into editing and maybe getting a camcorder to play with a maybe edit. In the next two years I will also be using in the field of elementary education as a teacher. Thanks for your ideas!

Remove the spyware and viruses that you let in with it. 3. Get the RAM to at least 512MB. At that point, it should be a decent system for basic college/business work. http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4550/specs.htm#1101572 If you really need a new desktop today, look to a system based around an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU.

Check you system specs, if the cpu is a 478-socket(Intel) then you pretty much got little cpu to grow on, replace ASAP, if at 400FSB. If a P4 at FSB500 or even FSB800, you got some room to really get better and add some more ram. However, for all the cost, you can seriously think a replacement system if only to move on an 'investment' the money spent on newer technology and such. Any upgrades like more ram, bigger HD, etc. could for a few $ more be spent on new system. Even a basic new system is in the $500 or less with alot of goodies that would be what any upgrades may provide into an old system. At this time of year, it would be very possible to get a decent system to select from and be ahead of any upgrades for awhile. Your old system is still worth something and most data can be swapped to new system. At the rate you're going, added audio and video files alone require a larger HD. Since, you want edit/play media a faster system is a practical must, plus if an XP based system you may want to look into Media Center type of OS. tada -----Willy

With Vista so close at hand keeping an old system may just be a waste. If Missj1235 can hold off with the camcorder side of it then buying a new system after bugs are out of Vista may be the way to go. I have choosen to wait and see what comes out of the Microsoft OS works. Maybe Missj1235 should look at what camcorder will meet the need and see what system will work it now. Then see if up-grading old system will do or hold off till the smoke clears away from Vista. I'm not sure but wouldn't a new system have to have Xp Media Center OS to have an OS upgrade ticket for Vista?

A PC with Windows XP, will get you an upgrade to Windows Vista Basic. I have applied for my Premium upgrade already, and it appears to be going well...
