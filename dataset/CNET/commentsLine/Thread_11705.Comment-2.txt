for example: i'm running an outdated amd athlon 1.2ghz with a fsb of 100mhz and a graphics card of 32mb so my system wouldn't even except half life 2 nor any of the other games you posted now the amd sempron is a pretty decent processor compared to an amd 64 the amd processor you're using only has about 400mhz of fsb and is only 1.80ghz my friend is running a 3.6ghz intel p4 and has an ati graphics card of 128mb which his half life 2 is running pretty damn sweet what i would recommend is taking back the one you own and gettin the newer bundle the graphics card you own won't except your nvidia geforce which only has about 64mb of memory plus a higher processor is recommend for a type of game like that you will probably still beable to play the game with your graphics card but it's gonna look nasty
