1.1.1	Here's a weird one.	St
1.1.2	I've had an HP PSC 1210 All-in-one printer/copier for about 5 years.	St
1.1.3	About a week ago, it kept getting jammed everytime I tried to print/copy with it.	St
1.1.4	I went through HP tech support page, and it told me to uninstall the software and reinstall.	St
1.1.5	I tried that, but everytime it got to the end of the installation process (the part where you plug in the USB cable) it didn't recognize the printer.	St
1.1.6	I tried EVERYTHING to fix this, including: - Multiple uninstalls followed by reinstalls - Unplugging everything from every port and receptacle and waiting - Downloading updated drivers from HP - Turning off my antivirus and firewall during installation - Running Windows update - Trying different USB ports and chords - Reinstalling the USB drivers to the mobo - Following the damn troubleshooting tips on HP - Talking to an HP troubleshooter over tech support chat Nothing works.	St
1.1.7	This printer was perfect a few weeks ago, and now its own drivers don't recognize it.	St
1.1.8	Help!	St
1.1.9	PS - Here are my specs: Windows XP Professional SP3, Pentium D 3.24gh, 2 gb of ram, homebuilt PC with a Gigabyte 81945gzme-rh mobo	St
1.2.1	1.	St
1.2.2	Test the printer on another PC.	St
1.2.3	2.	St
1.2.4	Try another USB cable.	St
1.2.5	3.	St
1.2.6	&quot;- Reinstalling the USB drivers to the mobo&quot; Instead, install the motherboard CHIPSET DRIVER PACKAGE.	St
1.2.7	Good luck.	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	the program requires the printer to be connected to the PC before installing the software/ drivers.	St
1.4.1	Actually, it doesn't.	St
1.4.2	the installation package makes it really clear that you shouldn't attach it until prompted.	St
1.4.3	Thanks for the feedback, all.	St
1.4.4	None of it worked, but i appreciate the gesture.	St
