1.1.1	External HD : Cavalry 500GB Started using : around early April Used : 120GB out of 500GB ( would like to save if at all possible ) A week ago , started to have the problem of not able to access the drive , with a warning message saying the drive is not accessible , and that the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable .	St
1.1.2	When I go to the Properties for the drive , it shows 0 byte for everything and format is shown as RAW .	St
1.1.3	Yesterday , I finally got around to try to fix it .	St
1.1.4	I first went to the Properties for the drive and tried to run check disk from there , the dialog window disappeared as soon as it started checking .	St
1.1.5	Then I went to the DOS prompt to use chkdsk /f /r from there , that actually worked .	St
1.1.6	It fixed a number of indexes as well as the MFT .	St
1.1.7	After that is complete , my correct volume is shown under properties again for this drive , and the format is back to NTFS .	St
1.1.8	But the weird part is none of the files and folders is showing up , even though it said I used up around 120GB of space .	St
