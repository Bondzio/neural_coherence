i jump in here because i see that no one has come to your rescue.
i am not really a &quot;techie&quot; and my mobo is an8 ultra, a very plain jane.
mine had a strange boot problem, and a new power supply fixed it.i see that official support from abit is the same as nothing, but you might try (if you have access to a computer that will get online) google abit kv8-max3 .
much information there, i didn't read it all, but you might get some clue.
if you get it fixed, please post back and let us know what works
