<s> XP will perform better if you get your RAM up to at least 512MB. </s>
<s> A clean install of XP may help. </s>

<s> BTW, what computer model is it? </s>
<s> What motherboard model do you have? </s>
<s> More RAM well make the biggest different, you need to check how much RAM your machine can take and try to match it. </s>
<s> This well make the biggest difference. </s>
<s> How big of Hard Drive do you have? </s>
<s> This would slow you down some, but nobody should need to defrag every week unless you are installing and uninstall a lot of programs. </s>
<s> That would just be overkill. </s>
<s> When you defrag click the &quot;Analyze&quot; button, if XP says you need to defrag then do it, if not don't. </s>
