<s> I have been looking into new computers because mine died. </s>
<s> I was considering getting a intel quad core computer then some one asked if I really needed that much power when most programs barely use more than a single core let alone a dual core. </s>
<s> So I was thinking I should just go with a dual core chip with the best graphics card I can get. </s>
<s> The things is I have been doing a lot of reading and I wanted to find out which of the dual cores are the best for intel and for amd. </s>
<s> Then from those chips which is considered the fastest and best for games movies and music. </s>
<s> as a side note anyone have and good recommendation for a great website to build a computer to compare to dell and such. </s>
<s> thanks as always. </s>

<s> As to why I'm going to skip that and point to tomshardware.com as he's all over it. </s>
<s> check out ibuypower.com if you know what you want in a computer and don't want to overpay, if you not sure you'll end up paying HP $600+ for 8GB DDR2-800MHz dual channel SDRAM (4x2048) when you can get better quality ram from newegg for less then $300 ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227270 ) not that you'd need that much, thats just proving a point. </s>
<s> Do research on your parts and know how much they are worth before buying from one of the big companies. </s>
<s> Or just build it yourself, its usually the best option. </s>
<s> AMD's fastest dual core is the Athlon X2 6400+ Intel's is the Core 2 Duo E6850 or the E8400 (65nm and 45nm) </s>
