4292	0	120195	1363316	NR	Brett Cherrington	8/16/05 3:08 AM	1.12416168E12	logon failure	I have been trying to help a friend set up a wireless network in her home (2 XP Home desktops). She got a Dlink wireless router hard wired to her 2 year old Dell and a Dlink wireless card for her new Wintergreen. Went through the setup and the connection to the internet works for both, and the Dell can access shared folders on the Wintergreen. Problem is, the Wintergreen cannot access the shared folders on the Dell. The error message is: ''Dell is not accessable. You might not have permission to use the network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. Logon failure: The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.'' I have tried everything I can think of and am coming up with the same thing. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Brett P.S. Got to go to work. I don't work in an office so I will be away from computers for the day so I won't respond immediately. Stick with me. Thanks again

A search of the net found other issues relating to connectivity such as trying to network more than one operating system, but nothing for two XP Home units. I have a bit of mistrust for Dell. Could there be some proprietary blocking done for purposes of security or something? Any other ideas? Thanks Brett

An uninstall is sometimes needed. After I check workgroup names, IP and subnet addresses, enable file and print sharing, set some folder to share, and the network PC is still not shown, I will do a Search for the PC using XP's Search feature. If the name does not work, I try the IP address.

The Dell shows up as a computer on the network but if you click on the icon you get the aforementioned message. I am not there right now but I doubt the search would allow access. Any other ideas knowing the Dell is &quot;shown&quot;?

4292	7	120195	1364919	1364800	Brett Cherrington	8/16/05 6:08 PM	1.12421568E12	here's some more info	Thanks for sticking with me. As I said in my initial post: ''Problem is, the Wintergreen cannot access the shared folders on the Dell. The error message is: ''Dell is not accessable. You might not have permission to use the network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. Logon failure: The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.'''' I have folders in the Dell set up as shared, I just can't even get access to that computer. The Dell can Access The new Wintergreen but the Wintergreen get's the ''Dell is not accessable'' message. To clarify: Both computers show up in the Wintergreen's ''View Network Computers'' but none of the Dell shared folders show up in ''My Network Places'' under ''Local Network'' on the Wintergreen, only the Wintergreen shared folders (which are accessable, though obviously unnecessarily so). Both computers show up in the Dell's ''View Network Computers'' and all shared folders from both computers show up (and are accessable) in ''My Network Places'' under ''Local Network'' on the Dell. Also, The Wintergreen is unable to see the shared printer. ....... I just saw your recent post. I read the link and two things: one, i had already changed the restrictanonymous setting having found that suggestion earlier. And two, the link refers to XP Pro which is different as pointed out in the last posts so that option will not work.
