I use DHCP to give each system a unique address within the net. If I connect one of those ports to my whole-house wiring, can any computer in the house that is connected to the wiring share that port? Will they still each get a unique address?

Many computers can connect wirelessly, however. You have to put a switch or hub or wireless access point on the other end of the cable to allow multiple computers to connect to the router through one of the numbered ports on the WRT54G. Internet ----- Router ----- switch/hub/WAP -~-~-~ computers ----- wired -~-~-~ wired or wirless

I spent a lot of time on the phone yesterday with Linksys tech support describing what I wanted to do. He kept insisting that if I connect one port to the house wiring the router would support any computer that was tied in to the house and DHCP would accomodate each computer with unique addresses. I havne't actually tested it yet but it does sound suspect.

For example, if you have four cables running throughout the house and they all have an end plugged into one of numbered ports 1-4, DHCP will assign an IP addresses to whatever device is on the other end of each cable. The device on the other end may be a computer or another network device, such as a Wireless Access Point or switch.
