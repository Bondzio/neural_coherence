1.1.1	My Dell laptop has been used some years , and it seems something wrong with the laptop ac adapter , so I bought a new Dell PA-12 AC Adapter from http : //www.papatek.com/Dell-Adapter/Dell-PA-12-AC-Adapter-19.5V-3.34A.html , the new one is good , but I still want to know , if the old one can be repaired , who can give some advice ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Since you ask , I am going to assumed that you will be taken it to a repair shop .	St
1.2.2	My guess is that you wo n't be able to do it for under $ 10 ( if it is something obvious and simple ) and really hurting for business .	St
1.2.3	But who knows..give it a shot	St
1.3.1	You might want to provide us with more details on your old adapter because not all faults are repairable .	St
1.3.2	However , if you do n't mind the hassle of bringing it down to a repair shop to check it out , then just do so .	Sug
1.3.3	They will be able to advice you whether your adapter is repairable and at what cost .	St
1.3.4	At the end of the day you will need to decide whether it 's worth while to fix it .	St
