1.1.1	I'm building a new computer, will be using Win XP.	St
1.1.2	What is the most efficient, most powerful Intel processsor I can buy, money is no object?	St
1.1.3	On the other end of the spectrum, where money is a concern, maybe up to $200- $250, what is the best Intel offering?	St
1.1.4	I won't be doing games, photoshop mostly.	St
1.2.1	the top end consumer choices are now the core i7 which has 4 CPU cores and hyperthreading.	St
1.2.2	to the OS, it appears you have 8 processors.	St
1.2.3	since you're sticking with xp (and thus 32-bit photoshop), they're probably overkill for you.	St
1.2.4	(if you're a pro that edits extremely large content, vista 64bit + 64bit cs4 + 6-8gb of ram are an ideal combo.	St
1.2.5	read this link for more info: http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb404901&sliceId=1 ) core i7: core i7 920, 2.8ghz, 1mb/8mb L2/L3 cache, $300 core i7 940, 2.93ghz, 1mb/8mb L2/L3 cache, $570 here are intel's mainstream quad and dual core processors.	St
1.2.6	note that the core i7 920 will outperform the q9650 in most intensive photoshop tasks (things that take 20+ sec to finish).	St
1.2.7	if your photoshop work is less taxing, a q9400 will give you great performance.	St
1.2.8	core2quad: q8300, 2.5ghz, 4mb L2 cache, $190 q9400, 2.66ghz, 6mb L2 cache, $240 q9550, 2.83ghz, 12mb L2 cache, $280 q9650, 3.0ghz, 12mb L2 cache, $345 core2duo: e8400, 3.0ghz, 6mb L2 cache, $166 e8500, 3.16ghz, 6mb L2 cache, $190	St
