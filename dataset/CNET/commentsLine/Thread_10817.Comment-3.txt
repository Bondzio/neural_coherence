i like and use splashtop.
i have android, but it's also available for mac.
they do have a separate app for ipad.
they have an app for just about every os, even the hp touchpad.
i can't quite remember since i got it last year, so not sure if it's free or not.
i think the best might be teamviewer.
i also have this installed - i installed this one so that i can remote into my family member's pc when they have problems.
i can look around their system and fix things.
i believe you can even reboot the pc remotely.
i tested it out already and it loaded very quickly and using it very impressive.
moving around is very fast.
i am guessing you could probably remote into your own pc, but i haven't tried this yet.
it's one of the best apps for remote pc help.
it is also free for private use.
if you are a business, then you have to pay for it.
i know it works for mac and i believe they have a dedicated ipad app as well.
