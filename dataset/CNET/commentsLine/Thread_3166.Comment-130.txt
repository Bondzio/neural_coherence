when buying any electronic devices always purchase well known established brands, such as sony, panasonic, rca, toshiba, etc.
as it relates to the most reliable hdd manufacture, in my experience seagate, western digital, & to a point hitachi.
i have a 40gb seagate in my desktop had that for bout 6 years, works great.
also had a 60gb segate for my laptop, that survived a few falls, bout 4 years, smart data read all's good (had to do replace it, needed more room; 250gb wd) still use it as an external though.
