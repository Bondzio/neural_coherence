<s> Hey everybody, Looking for some help utilizing my Panasonic TH-42PX75U as a computer monitor running from my iBook G4. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, my Panasonic does not have a VGA input. </s>
<s> It does, however, have HDMI, S-Video, Component, and Composite. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas as to how I could make this work? </s>
<s> Will the picture quality be worth it? </s>
<s> I'm a video editor who uses Final Cut Pro, so I'm hoping image quality can at least be decent... </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I did a quick search for something to convert VGA to something that your TV would recognize but found nothing that was any good. </s>
<s> Some things went from VGA to composite but the resulting quality was not worth the effort. </s>
<s> Hopefully you will get an answer to your problem P </s>
