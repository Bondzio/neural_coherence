the email asks what version of windows do i consider the worst.
that would obviously be vista, but for some reason all of the answer choices are hard disk manufacturers?!?
oh, i see, the question was supposed to be which brand of hard disk do i prefer.
well, i have never had a problem in the sense of drive failure/lost data.
however, if i had to choose a brand, it would be western digital, because they have the best compatibility, meaning they work with pretty much any computer or motherboard.
i have a western digital hard disk in this computer, and i am very happy with it.
