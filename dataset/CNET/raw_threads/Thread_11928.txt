I am going to order an iMac G5 (2.0 Ghz) next week. I intend on ordering 1Gig of RAM and was thinking of ordering a single one gig DIMM (so I could upgrade later without wasting memory). But I have seen some comments posted around the web arguing that the imac may run faster with matching pairs (i.e. 2 512 MB memory sticks are better than one 1 Gb). I was wondering what you guys, who are obviously more experienced with MACs that I, think. Any thoughts. Franklin

I doubt you will notice the difference in everyday use. Get the Single 1Gb and later you will be able to get the second on and have a matching pair. I don't know what the Bench marks are for the different configurations but I'm guessing that unless you are doing something really RAM intensive, it will not show. Good luck P

Face it, would u like to search for a book in 2 bookshelves or one. Same thing w/ RAM. It's faster to transfer data to 1 stick of RAM that 2. Data transfer through the North bridge will be faster w/ one stick than if u utilize 2 RAM sticks.

I'd get the single stick of 1G RAM because the difference in speed will be smaller than the difference in expense. By that I'm referring to the expense of losing two 512s to the stockpile or a reseller. If you upgrade as you say you might later, that is. If money is no object then get two 1G sticks. Also, it's nice to be able to squeeze the last bit of speed out of a computer when it's older and the components cost less. Just my 2 cents--your universe may vary.

But I think I'll go with the 1 gig DIMM and upgrade later. Thanks to everyone. Franklin

Installing matching pairs with only 1Gb of memory (2 X 512) means that you will have to replace BOTH the dimms, only two slots in the iMac, when you decide to upgrade your memory if you want to maintain the matching pair strategy. Install 1 X 1Gb now, upgrade later, with another 1Gb, and you now have the matching pair that Apple recommends and will not have wasted any money. P

Could it be that the memory data path is expanded when both slots are in use? P
