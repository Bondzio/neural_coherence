Hello there, I hope English speaker geek will help me, the French one couldn't ;( One of my &quot;fiend&quot;, even he is not really one right now, decide to destroy the MFT from my extra backup hard-disk to be able to read my NTFS files on his (f..k.ng) Mac OS to watch a ... movie ????!!!!! Now I can' t access my files (backup of few years of work). Symptoms : 1- &quot;My computer&quot; see nothing. 2- The disk management from Windows see it as &quot;unallocated space&quot;. 3- PTDD Partition Table Doctor see : - the partition, - the root and the files in it (there is some hope here) - confirm that the Boot sector is right. - rebuild the MFT in Automatic and in Interactive mode (27 hours ...) So what now ? Any advices. Other software ? Maybe it is not the MFT the problem (or was but there is another one)? Help ......

Only partition Doctor can. The other solution are about recovering files that have been deleted, which is not my case. thansk if anybody else as a solution.

Playing around with it between Partition table doctor and Testdisk, I went back to Unbuntu and now I can access 2 of the 3 partition which is fine for me as the third one has stuff I don't really care about. The problem is now to try to extract the files as it is extremely, extremely slow 11kb/s ....... As we are talking about 320 giga, it is a bit too slow. Why that ? Cause the MFt is bad ? Cause I am strating a linux on a USB key, so not installed ? Any suggestion, thanks

The most common self inflicted damage is from those that defrag external drives. If there were LESSONS to be learned from the storage forum it would be to backup what you can't lose and don't defrag external drives. Bob
