i am trying to install a samsung 320gb (hd322hj) new sata hard drive.
my abit motherboard (vt7) has the provisions for this drive however the bios will not recognize that it is there.
i have tried updated bios and flashing.
i am trying to install as the only drive with windows xp.
any a help or suggestions would be appreciated.
