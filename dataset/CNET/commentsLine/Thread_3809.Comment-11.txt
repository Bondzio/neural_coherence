this one is 70 bucks and it was the same as the antelearthwattsa and cm real power for some tests and better for the rest, they aslo said the quality of the psu was astounding.
is it a safe bet that this psu will be alright for my build and could i run sli on it?
it has 20a ouput on each rail (and i've heard you need 18a for dual 9800gtx+
