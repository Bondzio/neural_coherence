1.1.1	I have a frustrating question .	St
1.1.2	Over the past two weeks I have been dealing with a video problem on my Dell dnInspiron 8500 ( 2.2 GHz MP4 , 512 Mb RAM , nVidia GeForce4 4200 64Mb Go video card ) .	St
1.1.3	After two weeks of searching and toiling and reading thousands of community forum posts the culprit ended up being a little pin ( that tells the computer to go into standby mode ) that had worked its way out of place and was sending a continuous signal to go into standby .	St
1.1.4	I fixed it rather easily once identified , inspite of finding MANY posts from DELL representatives stating that the mother board needed to be replaced for this problem .	St
1.1.5	If I had stopped there everything would have been fine .	St
1.1.6	Unfortunately for me , while searching the DELL knowledge base , I also discovered that DELL recommended a BIOS upgrade for my video card .	St
1.1.7	Since I was steeped indealing with video card issues at the time , once I fixed the pressing problem I decided to follow their recommendation and flash the BIOS to update my video card .	St
1.1.8	They offered two options , and being slightly lazy , I decided to go with the easiest method which entailed downloading the flash utility and running it from my hard drive .	St
1.1.9	I followed the directions explicitily and quit all applications before starting , then launched the utility and ran it .	St
1.1.10	It then posted an additional window that stated this should take a few seconds to complete .	St
1.1.11	After 10 minutes I was starting to get a little worried .	St
1.1.12	I clicked on the original window only to be told that it was no longer responding !	St
1.1.13	Of course , I was VERY concerned about what just happened and you guessed it , upon restart I got nothing !	St
1.1.14	The hard drive light flashes a couple times , but never spins up .	St
1.1.15	I get no splash screen , and clearly it just stops at that point .	St
1.1.16	Now I am trying to determine if there is any way to reflash the BIOS ( blindly -- without an operational LCD ) .	St
1.1.17	I tried making a bootable floppy disk but my laptop will not boot from it ... possibly because it does n't realize I switched the CD drive with a floppy drive .	St
1.1.18	I am trying to make a bootable CD , but not sure how to get the flash utility to run automatically .	St
1.1.19	I am desparately searching for any ideas .	St
1.1.20	Do I really need to buy a new video card ?	Ques
1.1.21	Can it really not be re-flashed ?	Ques
1.1.22	Help !	St
1.1.23	Help !	St
1.1.24	Help !	St
1.1.25	Please .	St
1.2.1	I had deja vu when reading this post .	St
1.2.2	My experience is with the exact same equipment and pretty much the same steps you followed with the exact same unhappy results .	St
1.2.3	I wish I had a solution but I have pretty much given up .	St
1.2.4	I hope someone replys to this post with an idea .	St
1.3.1	Try using an external USB floppy drive for the BIOS flash .	St
1.3.2	If that does n't work , contact Dell and complain to them that you followed THEIR RECOMMENDATION to update the video card BIOS/firmware .	St
1.3.3	THEIR RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE AND SOFTWAE ''bricked '' your video card and they need to rectify this .	St
1.3.4	A solution would be a new video card or a utility that repairs the video card BIOS .	Sug
1.4.1	I 've not received any good ideas that have worked from this post or the others I have fished with .	St
1.4.2	I tried reflashing from a boot disk as some have suggested , but the system fails the POST tests and never proceeds far enough to actually boot up .	St
1.4.3	I did talk to the IT person at my place of work and he basically told me my only recourse was to buy a new video card .	St
1.4.4	Unfortunately , because the cards are fairly machine specific the word & quot ; new & quot ; refers to a used card purchased from eBay ; the only source I could find .	St
1.4.5	It will run about $ 120 with shipping .	St
1.4.6	This is one mistake that I will not make again and that will start with not buying Dell laptops .	St
1.4.7	I 've always been fond of Apple computer and this only reinforces my reason why .	St
1.4.8	I see a MacPro on the horizon .	St
1.4.9	Good luck with you endevors .	Polite
1.4.10	If you find anything that helps please let em know .	St
1.5.1	I fully agree with you .	St
1.5.2	This is Dell 's fault !	St
1.5.3	They should pay for the replacement .	St
1.5.4	The problem is contacting Dell 's tech service and dealing with the hours of waiting and language barrier to likely have to fight repeatedly with them over this issue .	St
1.5.5	Outsourcing is done for one reason ... to save money and that is n't only related to cheaper labor , it 's related to poorer service .	St
1.5.6	I 've , this time , chosen to bypass the Dell tech service nightmare and pay the price for a replacement card .	St
1.5.7	They absolutely , however , need to take the harddrive BIOS flash solution off of their website !	St
1.5.8	Thanks for the comment .	St
1.6.1	yea , told a friend i would reformatt and update their pc , installed all the updates , got to the vga bios update and now i own a laptop i cant afford unless i fix it ...	St
