Recently, I have been searching for an Android tablet, however, I don't know which android tablet to get. I have narrowed it down to these three, however, all suggestions would be accepted. I was looking for pretty good battery life (at least 7 hours, but more would definately be preferable). Beyond battery life, I was looking for expandable memory, and good initial memory. The final two things that I was looking for were a good clean bright screen, and a lighter tablet (it doesn't really matter but, would definately be nice.) The price doesn't necessarily matter.
