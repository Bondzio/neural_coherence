Do you know the reason? - Also how do you use &quot;PC card&quot; on a desktop computer? Is it just for laptops? I'm planning to add a wirelles adapter to my Desktop PC, specifically &quot;Microsoft MN-730&quot;. Which one do you recommend USB adapter or PCI adapter?

Move the base and/or handset as far from the router and PC cards as practical, or get a 900MHz, or 5.8GHz model instead. The wi-Fi operates at 2.4GHz.

I agree captaincraig, as a 2.4 GHz very definitely interfere with a 802.11b (most common) wireless network, as they both work in the same frequency range. As for the PC Card, it can be used on a desktop, but it requires a special PCI card be installed inside the desktop. As for the Microsoft adapters, either should work equally well. The USB adapter is easier as it's external.

Wi-Fi networks work on 2.4 ghz range so if you have a 2.4 ghz phone you will lose the connection because the network and phone will conflict with one another. As for the other things I don't know enough to give you sound advice.
