There is a single network point in my room. I keep my desktop connected to this as this is where I get internet access. I want to sync both my laptop and desktop and this usually involves me unplugging the LAN cable and plugging it into my laptop. I'm looking for an easier solution. Can I buy a USB wifi stick for my desktop and connect simultaneously to my laptop wirelessly and the university network via cable? Note both pcs have Windows 7 X64.

If so, I'd think you could add another Ethernet card to the desktop and use a crossover cable for data transfer. You'd have to use static IP addressing for the laptop NIC and the new NIC for the desktop.
