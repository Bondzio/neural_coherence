I recently decided to go and purchase an iMac because my 3 year old compaq desktop is truely outdated.
But now I discovered that Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) is on the way.
Do you think that a new iMac or Macbook will debue with OS X 10.6 when it is released next year?
Should I buy my iMac now or wait?
Thank you for your advice!
