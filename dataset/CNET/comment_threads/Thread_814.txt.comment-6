Thank you for your suggestion.
I continued to play around with this set up and discovered that on the desktop I can access the netbook by accessing the &quot;workgroup&quot;.
On the netbook I can access the desktop with &quot;network places&quot;.
I do not know if that is the best or correct way but I have been able to transfer data and that is what I wanted to do.
When I delete a folder in the &quot;Share Document&quot; folder it does not delete the original, does it?
