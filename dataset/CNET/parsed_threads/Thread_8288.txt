<s> Hello, I am a beginner so my apologies if i do not understand or have to ask again anyways, I just got a Toshiba laptop with windows 8 pre-installed. </s>
<s> It had a 1 TB hard drive and I added another 1 TB as it has a slot I want to install Linux. </s>
<s> How should I go about partitioning my extra hard drive that I added? </s>
<s> Currently it is unallocated and currently i do not see this hard drive i added in the list of my drives in the My computer but yes i do see it in the Disk management area any help is much appreciated </s>
<s> If I install UBUNTU it will ask me where to install and what boot loader to use. </s>
<s> At no time am I partitioning or formatting ahead of the install. </s>
<s> Those that do such tend to blow up there installed OS. </s>
<s> Bob Step 4 of http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-desktop-latest shows this. </s>
<s> Again I have to wonder why so many want to make this harder than it needs to be. </s>
<s> Hello Bob and thanks for the message and help, and i did try to directly download Ubuntu without creating a USB and it started but then I got the message &quot;can't mount file&quot; or something like this about mounting a file and that was the end of it and nothing happened i still do have my windows 8 and nothing was changed and yes I want to keep my windows 8 and hopefully be able to dual boot await any help cheers Reza </s>
<s> I think the problem is that Ubuntu was trying to instal itself on the hard drive where Windows 8 exist and since there is no room there as I did not shrink it, hoping Ubuntu would use the other hard drive it failed. </s>
<s> If i shrink the first hard drive that Windows 8 is on it and if Ubuntu installs correctly can I move it or give it more room from the second drive which would be free it is just a thought i am a beginner and do not know exactly if the cause of the error message (cant mount file) is really what i just said any expert thoughts/suggestions please? </s>
<s> The new 1Tb HD is made by someone. </s>
<s> If WD or Seagate, they provide s/w to help install and prepare and others provide similar(I assume). </s>
<s> That should include any partitioning s/w as well. </s>
<s> Just be darn sure you are addressing that new HD. </s>
<s> Once only the partitioning is done you can access it for Linux as it should see a prepared HD awaiting use and direct the Linux there. </s>
<s> I'm unsure if GParted is capable under Win8 use but it has provided partitioning setups for prior OSes. </s>
<s> http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php Before you attempt anything, be sure you have a working back-up or recovery discs made in order to restore you current setup, just in case. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I read you tried to download without creating the usual USB or DVD. </s>
<s> Frankly I can't understand why anyone would do that and put themselves in an unsupportable position. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> Hello again, yes sorry but I was trying to download directly and why I do not know . </s>
<s> Anyway, I made a USB and booted from it and nothing happened. </s>
<s> I do not know what to expect to be honest. </s>
<s> Would Ubuntu come up automatically? </s>
<s> sorry but I am beginning on this path but very eager and determined I tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything anyways thanks Reza </s>
<s> I don't usually duplicate the Ubuntu site. </s>
<s> Use their site and tutorials and it's usually fine. </s>
<s> That is, I usually find folk are making up something undocumented and wondering why it doesn't work. </s>
<s> There is a clue &quot;I tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything&quot; as that tells me you did not boot from the USB drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hello I installed ubuntu 12.10 using a CD image and actually did so twice. </s>
<s> In both cases i lost my windows 8, or actually i did not lose it as when i used the recovery disk i re-gained windows 8 but i could not dual boot and only can boot into ubuntu, does so directly I read many forums and Ubuntu site for how to fix this and many said run a boot repair 1- can someone please send me a reliable site or wasy to get boot-repair 2- i found some commands to be typed from ubuntu to run boot repair but to my surprise my ubuntu informed me i did not have boot repair 3- any suggestions in general as how to solve this issue 4- also when i use the remix linux from ubuntu site it goes to another site and when i make a USB it does not boot. </s>
<s> becomes a non-bootable usb, how come? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot in advance and much appreciated for your patience i am still a beginner Reza </s>
<s> After all this I now think this is a dead end. </s>
<s> KEEP READING PLEASE. </s>
<s> The newer laptops arrive with UEFI BIOS enabled and that is going to break old install systems. </s>
<s> OK, how did I fix that on a new Windows laptop that came with UEFI enabled? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I created the restore media. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Since this was the first time I had to deal with this I slipped in a new blank HDD. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I set the BIOS to LEGACY ONLY. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I used the restore media to restore the laptop to near factory condition. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Finally I could boot Linux media and do a good install just like we did before UEFI. </s>
<s> --&gt; What does this all mean? </s>
<s> As the industry changes to UEFI BIOS we'll have to wait till the Linux distros catch up. </s>
<s> Sorry I didn't spot this earlier. </s>
<s> And this subject is widely discussed so I'll stop here so you can do more research. </s>
