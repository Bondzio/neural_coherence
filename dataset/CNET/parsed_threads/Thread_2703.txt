<s> hi- recently my amd duron 1200 cpu died, and im having trouble tracking down a replacement, my question is if anyone knows where to find one affordably, and second- does the K7S5A mobo with a atx case with 300 power supply support the amd duron 1400? </s>
<s> any thoughts?? </s>
<s> any help at all would be appreciated! </s>
<s> I believe there was more than one version of the K7S5A motherboard. </s>
<s> You'll need to know which version you have. </s>
<s> If you have the manual that will be the easiest way to determine the specs. </s>
<s> If not download and install Belarc or Everest Home. </s>
<s> These small programs can tell you everything installed on your computer. </s>
<s> Once you know, go to the ECS website to check the supported cpu's. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> If it supported the Duron cpu, then it supports the AMD XP cpu class as well. </s>
<s> Depending on the mtrbd., it *may* also support the newer Sempron cpus as well. </s>
<s> During the orginal release of the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and later, many a bios update has come out, check the support website for the details, as some update maybe required to support the full range of cpus other than what it orginally supported. </s>
<s> You will then know for sure what cpus it supports. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> http://www.pricewatch.com look for processors. </s>
<s> Others will send you to eBay. </s>
<s> on the back of the box it says iso-9001 on the bottom left.. and on the front of the manual is a sticker under the K7S5A that says EA=000795B22C56 and in the manual introductions it says : socket a support for an amd k7 type processors, and you can install any one of these processors on the board. </s>
<s> the mainboard supports front side bus speeds of 200/266 mhz. </s>
<s> beyond this i cant seem to find a model # or anything else... </s>
<s> The manual is generic. </s>
<s> Should be a sticker around the bar code. </s>
<s> But the most accurate info will be on the MOBO itself. </s>
<s> There will be a version sticker next to the chipset. </s>
<s> I had a version 5. </s>
<s> Why limit yourself to Duron. </s>
<s> The board takes Athlon, including Thoroughbred. </s>
<s> The version # will tell you how late a processor and DDR memory (usually up to PC2100). </s>
<s> Just checked Elitegroup. </s>
<s> The latest (K7S5A Pro v.5 also takes XP Athlon. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> chuck </s>

<s> However, I don't know if the board supports this chip. </s>
<s> I'm assuming so since it's 266MHZ FSB. </s>
<s> 300 watts is plenty. </s>
