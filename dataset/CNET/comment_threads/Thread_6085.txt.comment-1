I was under the impression that a video card, graphics card, and video adapter card were all the same thing, but now I think I'm wrong.
On my PC, whenever I'd run software to detect what video card I had, it would say this - &quot;ATI 3D Rage Pro AGP&quot;.
It's been called a video card or a graphics card by different software I use and when listed under my device manager, it's called an adapter card.
That's why I thought those were all the same thing.
However, I recently purchased software that says I don't have a video card.
I checked the requirements and it said I needed a video card that was directx 9.0 compatible and could handle up to 32-bit color and a resolution of 1024x768.
As far as I've been able to tell, that 3D Rage Pro meets all those requirements, but I could be wrong.
Can someone clear this up for me?
