I would like to merge the two physical drives into one without reformating my primary drive to create more space for programs. Is this possible? If so please give me instructions on how to merge the drives into one. Your help in this matter would be much appreciated. thanks.

But you can move a great deal of the content of the c:-drive (your Documents folder and everything it contains and the other subfolders of the rootfolder you created yourself) to the d:-drive and start using that. Windows and Users (except for the Documents part) can't be moved. Program Files can't be moved, but you can install most (not all!) programs onto the d:-drive also. To move your Documents folder, right click and find the Move command in it's properties. Kees

As there are TWO PHYSICAL DRIVES there is no other way than to RAID the two but unless you are comfortable with this I feel you should use the other drive for some files and keep the C drive tidy.

Then that whole d:-drive becomes a folder in the c:-drive. I'll leave it to you to research the details. Did they ever tell you that external drives are slow and unreliable? Only store documents on them if you either have a good backup or don't mind losing them. Kees
