Hi, I have a Dell Dimension 4600 purchaed 1 1/2 years ago.
About 2-3 weeks ago, I installsed a 200 GB Maxtor 7200 ATA 133 in the machine in addition to the 40GB original drive.
A week later, the system acted funny by making a sound (HD) and giving me the follwoing message: Primary drive 0 not found, strike the F1 key to continue, F2 key to run the setup utility.
The following morning the system worked fine.
A couple of days ago it came up with the message but it did not work in the morning.
I moved the controller wires around but no luck.
Any idea how I can get my machine working?
At this time I will be happy with having access to my original drive!!
Thanks Tinman6g
