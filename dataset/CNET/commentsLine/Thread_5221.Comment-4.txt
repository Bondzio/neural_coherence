because i know the gps issues.
something about working with gps tracking helps me here but as to the wifi that's odd too.
i found no two devices to give the same range.
some would call that a defect.
again, i'm back to writing about limitation or differences.
the biggest problem i see folk encounter is when they try to replace their laptop with an android or other pad.
they learn first hand what's up.
