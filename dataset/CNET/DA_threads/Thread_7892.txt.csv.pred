1.1.1	Hi .	St
1.1.2	I want my PC to be good at gaming .	St
1.1.3	Actually not just good i want it Really good .	St
1.1.4	I decided to upgrade it .	St
1.1.5	I bought a new graphics card and a new processor .	St
1.1.6	The graphics card was & quot ; Geforce 6200 Vram 512 & quot ; , I wanted 6 series .	St
1.1.7	It was cheap so i took it .	St
1.1.8	The processor was & quot ; Intel P4 2.8ghz HT tech & quot ; .	St
1.1.9	I 'm wondering if this was a good choice .	St
1.1.10	1st i bought the graphics and tried it .	St
1.1.11	Games were good but sometimes slow because of my old Processor & quot ; Celeron D 1.8ghz & quot ; .	St
1.1.12	I did n't try the new proccesor yet cuz the store guy told me he should change the motherboard too .	St
1.1.13	He had to format so he told me to come Tomorrow & quot ; which is today & quot ; .	St
1.1.14	It 's 11:18 am here and i 'll pick my PC at 7:00pm .	St
1.1.15	I 'm excited about the new processor .	St
1.1.16	But i 'm wondering is these upgrade good ?	Ques
1.1.17	specially too bad i did n't search alot b4 buying and that 's a big mistake .	St
1.1.18	thank u	Polite
1.2.1	The graphics card that you bought is not good at all for gaming .	St
1.2.2	With graphics cards and computer parts in general , you get what you pay for .	St
1.2.3	In gaming , your performance will improve more if you just get a better graphics card rather than a new processor .	St
1.2.4	Where did you buy your graphics card , and what did you pay for it ?	Ques
1.3.1	I 'm from kuwait .	St
1.3.2	i bought it from Bin Khaldon St. in Hawali .	St
1.3.3	It 's a famous St. where there 're alot of computer stores .	St
1.3.4	I paid 27 k.d for it .	St
1.3.5	About 81 US Dollars .	St
1.3.6	But i heard Intel Celeron D is not good for gaming .	St
1.3.7	So i thought changing the processor may boost gaming .	St
1.3.8	Speciely HT tech .	St
1.3.9	i though it might help .	St
1.3.10	thank u	Polite
1.4.1	memory ( RAM ) might be a bottleneck also .	St
1.4.2	There 's no magic bullet .	St
1.4.3	Read the minimum specs for the game , and double them to play comfortably .	St
1.4.4	Remember Tetris , Jezzball and Pacman ?	Ques
1.4.5	Work perfectly on my 8 years old 200 Mhz-48 Mb-S3 machine .	St
1.4.6	But World of Warcraft goes much better on 1 Gb than on 512 Mb .	St
1.4.7	Hope this helps .	St
1.4.8	Kees	St
1.5.1	Sorry i did n't mention full PC specs .	St
1.5.2	the ram is 1giga .	St
1.5.3	I have a game & quot ; Act of War & quot ; .	St
1.5.4	I have the recomended specs but the proccesor .	St
1.5.5	Recommended = p4 2.8 and mine celeron D 1.8 .	St
1.5.6	Even on low i suffer for fps drops .	St
1.5.7	The thing that confuses me is in & quot ; Battlefield 2 & quot ; .	St
1.5.8	When i play single player battle the game is slow on Low although i have the recomended & quot ; but processor : p & quot ; .	St
1.5.9	The game runs smooth and great on High on multiplayer if there 're few players or only me .	St
1.5.10	So i think the proccesor in the problem i face in gaming which should be changed	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
