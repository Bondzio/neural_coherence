1.1.1	I am not sure how can I set up Wirless network within my home as my situation is a little different from the regular networking setup.	St
1.1.2	Here is my situation, I receive my internet connection from the local ISP using LAN without any cable modems.	St
1.1.3	The LAN pin is plugged into one of the 2 D-Link Ethernet 10/100 cards in my Desktop PC.	St
1.1.4	The local ISP along with the internet connection provides a Windows Login Client Application.	St
1.1.5	Unless I do not login into that client (which works only on my desktop) the internet will not work.	St
1.1.6	In such a scenario where I just HAVE TO login to the desktop PC, how can I set up home wifi?	St

1.15.1	is the same as the default IP of the router.	St
1.15.2	This explains why you cannot reach the routers setup page.	St
1.15.3	Take this cable out of the WAN port and put it in one of the LAN ports.	St
1.15.4	Then cycle the power of the router and reboot the PC.	St
1.15.5	See what IP you now get on the 2nd NIC.	St
1.15.6	It should be 192.168.0.100 or so.	St
1.15.7	If this is the IP, you can now enter the routers setup page by typing 192.168.0.1.	St
