<s> Anyone know if there's any PC with the new AMD APU Trinity A series? </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/a10-4600m-trinity-piledriver,3202.html I read there are demo units out there but what happens next is well known. </s>
<s> Are you aware how this works? </s>
<s> What happens next? </s>

<s> I saw some good review on it so it caught my attention. </s>
<s> http://www.futuremark.com/news/60791_amd_trinity_a-series_apu_launched/ I read around the APU A10, and yesterday I been searching around for computer and I have found this one called ARCTIC MC101 having the A10. </s>
<s> Looking good and the other feature are matching to what I m looking for...I might go for that... Bob, what you mean when you say what happens next ? </s>
<s> I see Tomshardware did check it out but again, can't find any compelling reason over other solutions. </s>
<s> But, there are folk that want the latest. </s>
<s> They'll ask when the iPhone 5 will be out but as soon as that shows up, they will hold off and ask when the iPhone 6 will arrive. </s>

<s> Hi , I am planning to buy a PC with latest processor, is this latest from AMD? </s>
<s> how about Intel? </s>
<s> If the AMD Trinity as you said is the latest processor, the MC101 you mentioned, do they have barebone coz I want to add my own storage or OS? </s>
<s> @Sjones0000 _ yes they have barebone version, much cheaper than the full version. </s>
<s> I have brought the MC101 from ARCTIC at the end, I got the full version with Trinity A10, it's excellent and I love it. </s>
<s> Working great and its really small and good looking, fit in my living. </s>
