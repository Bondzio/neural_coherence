<s> Yesterday my computer failed to boot because of some problem (probably) the boot record. </s>
<s> Swapping out the problem hard drive with a good drive corrects the problem. </s>
<s> Then, to trouble shoot, I set the jumpers on the bad unit to the slave position and tried to boot with my spare hard drive again as the C drive. </s>
<s> When the boot process got to &quot;verifying DMI pool,&quot;, the computer reported... NTLDR is missing Press Ctrl-Alt-Del to restart When I did that, the computer then &quot;hung&quot; on recognizing the good hard drive as well. </s>
<s> So, my question is &quot;What is NTLDR and should I just garbage can this drive?&quot; I would at least like to be able to read this drive one last time as I have a couple of files that I didn't backup. </s>
<s> Try... 1. </s>
<s> That drive set to CS and an 80 conductor IDE cable to the secondary channel. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Put it in an USB Hard Disk enclosure. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> With a dead drive, nothing is assured, but we try... </s>
