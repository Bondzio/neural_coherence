<s> I recently purchased an Iomega External drive. </s>
<s> I backed up all my stuff on to it. </s>
<s> I was having some problems with a desk top and decided to take my Iomega drive apart so I could try putting in my desktop drive in to at least read it (using my External drive as a hardware enclosure). </s>
<s> When I did unscrew my external drive and pull it out of its case I noticed my plan would not work so I carefully put everything back together again. </s>
<s> I then hooked it back up to my laptop and found out that it would not work at all! </s>
<s> The light comes on it, showing that it has power. </s>
<s> But it will not show up as a drive on my computer. </s>
<s> It used to make a little whirring sound when on before (you know the processor working, fan doing it's job that type of thing) but now it is utterly silent. </s>
<s> I did ground myself before taking it apart and made sure to be very careful with it in taking it apart and putting it back together so I am at a loss here! </s>
<s> Any ideas or suggestions? </s>
<s> Not unheard of and no one I know has bothered to spend time trying to fix a cranky enclosure. </s>
