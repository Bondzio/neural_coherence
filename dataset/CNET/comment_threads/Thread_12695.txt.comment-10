You didn't answer my question.
But your comment &quot;I'm not sure if its smaller size would be causing the corruption.&quot; peaks my curiosity.
We run on embedded machines running Windows 2000 on 64MB so that can't be the cause if you were thinking of low ram.
However XP did corrupt drives without some service packs.
I may skip over such but this is the second time you wrote &quot;XP&quot; and not &quot;XP SP2&quot; or such.
For now you could try turning off XP's write caching.
This helps in some cases -&gt; http://www.accucadd.com/TechNotes/Cache/WriteBehindCache.htm That article covers almost all versions of Windows.
