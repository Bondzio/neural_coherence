one of my computers is an old one that didn't have room for a case fan, so i added one of those &quot;fits in a slot&quot; cooling fans that blows out the back in a vacant slot.
it dropped the tempurature of the primary hard drive by 10 degrees f. (verified by &quot;speedfan&quot; using built in hd sensor) about $10 for the fan i expect this will extend the life of the hard drive.
this also reduced the tempurature of the exhaust from the power supply also, so everything is running cooler.
also, i have found that just getting the system up 4&quot; will reduce the dust quite a bit, an old phone book or two works great.
my cooling issues are in the winter; the heat blows down near where this computer sits; in the summer the a/c blows into the same spot, so it runs quite a bit cooler in the summer than in the winter.
i could never run a pc in the summer without a/c in texas.
when the a/c failed the last time the 2nd floor tempurature reached 118 degrees f. after two days.
