todays memory is made to some very exacting standards.
so one would think that if they bought two sticks of the same type from the same maker and even if they came from different batches that they would be very close timing wise.
if their not, well funny things might happen.
if you only have one stick then timing between sticks becomes a non-issue.
just something to consider.
as for the perf thing you can run that through google but i suspect that unless your running some very demanding apps you will not see a diff.
