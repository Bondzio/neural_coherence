hello, i decided it would be a great idea to re-install my win xp-pro os because it seemed to be having too many problems.
when i backed up the drivers, i must have missed a very important one.
now i've searched the net for this, but to no avail.
i'm running xp, my dvd is a matshita sr-8176 cd/dvd-rom(working fine until i did this) my error keeps saying that cannot find ittimg3.dll...i don't have the disk for my dvd-rom...please help!!
!
