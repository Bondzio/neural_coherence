1.1.1	I bought a 320GB Western Digital Scorpio Blue hard drive (WD3200BEVE) for a laptop that died.	St
1.1.2	Since then I have gotten rid of the laptop but wanted to use the hard drive externally for my PC for storage.	St
1.1.3	I bought a Gigaware 2.5&quot; IDE Hard Drive Enclosure.	St
1.1.4	I set it up and the enclosure light turns blue.	St
1.1.5	The PC searched for the drivers for quite a while and failed.	St
1.1.6	From what I see on the WD website they don't offer drivers for external use of the hard drive.	St
1.1.7	Any help is appreciated.	St
1.1.8	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	No drivers is correct.	St
1.2.2	But I find some forget to partition and format these blank drives.	St
1.2.3	Did you prepare the drive?	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply.	St
1.3.2	I did not prepare it as you mentioned.	St
1.3.3	How do I partition and format the blank drive?	St
1.3.4	When I plug it in, the PC makes the sound that it recognizes something was plugged in, but no drive appears in the Computer folder.	St
1.3.5	Thanks again any help is appreciated.	St
1.3.6	FYI I have a Dell that uses Windows Vista.	St
1.4.1	Click the orb, type DISK MANAGEMENT and you should find it.	St
