hey, i got my new external hd enclosure today for my old 200 gb hdd.
plugged it in the ieee 1394 port of my laptop and i could read my old hdd.
i rebooted my machine with the enclosure still plugged in and powered up.
after restarting my laptop detects the enclosure but does not detect my hard drive any longer.
just to make sure of the problem i connected another hdd and same result.
any suggestions how to rectify this problem so that i can read my hard drive again thanks, anirud@hotmail.com
