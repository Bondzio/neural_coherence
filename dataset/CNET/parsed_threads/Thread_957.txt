<s> Hi; I currently have a Motorola Netopia SmartModem (2525A-3347) and would like to replace it with a more advanced wireless gateway router. </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest a good replacement? </s>
<s> I would like more wi-fi range and good throughput; as well as dual-band support. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I looked for that model and failed. </s>
<s> As to range, since all routers play by the same rules (power, etc) I don't find any that give me double the range. </s>
<s> Link please to your product. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob; I guess I should have put that in my post. </s>
<s> It's not for dial up, I am using Qwest DSL. </s>
<s> http://www.qwest.com/internethelp/modems.html The link above is the only page I have been able to find which has anything on the 3347, and it's not much. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Since we don't want to replace the DSL MODEM, I see from your link it does support &quot;Setting up Bridging (RFC1483)&quot; You can do that and use a wifi router of your choice (again, many names are one is just like the next.) </s>
<s> Or you can check out this forum's sticky about post 18 where we use more than one wifi router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again for the response Bob. </s>
<s> I was also wondering if any of the products found here: http://reviews.cnet.com/best-wireless-routers/?tag=centerColumnArea1.0;buyAdvice would be as good or better as the 3347 I currently have. </s>
<s> I'll be honest with you. </s>
<s> I am fairly good with computers and programming, but for some reason this whole networking/router/modem thing is throwing me for a loop. </s>
<s> I don't know if I am suffering from information overload or what, but I am having trouble with it so I would like to K.I.S.S. </s>
<s> it if at all possible. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be wonderful. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Skip the valet and the 614/615. </s>
<s> I have an early version of the 3700 and it's very nice. </s>
<s> Same for the 2000. </s>
<s> The belkin lost me years ago when they did their adware router. </s>
<s> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/07/help_my_belkin_router/ Never read an apology but something about they thought the market wanted that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the great information. </s>
<s> One more question (hopefully the last, for your sake because you're probably getting tired of being pestered): In addition to the Netgear 2000, which one would you recommend out of the ones listed on this page: http://reviews.cnet.com/4504-4_7-0.html?id=33485574&id=34041744&id=34103434&id=32145084&tag=compare I've looked at these, but I really can't tell the difference (other than the price and that two of them are gigabit routers). </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> As you stated the differences are very hard to detect. </s>
<s> For you average person who just used the router to surf the internet it does not really matter. </s>
<s> I will point out a couple of the features that you may or may not care about. </s>
<s> 5G band. </s>
<s> Most stuff uses 2.4G frequency and sometime it can be crowded so devices that can run at 5G are useful in certain situations. </s>
<s> Devices that say they support 802.1a (which only runs on 5G) and also run N will run N on the 5G band. </s>
<s> Dual This feature sometime means it has 2.4g and 5g radios that can be used at the same time. </s>
<s> More often it means that you can run 2 connection between your router and PC to get 300M. </s>
<s> Gig ports. </s>
<s> In almost all cases including the use of 300m dual channel stuff you are wasting your time if you are just surfing. </s>
<s> There are no consumer connection that can give you more than even 100m of internet. </s>
<s> Most the traffic that would need this high speed would be BETWEEN machines in your house. </s>
<s> Although I don't know if any of these have it some routers have the ability to filter traffic to prevent the kids from going to bad sites. </s>
<s> Are models other members have and they don't complain much. </s>
<s> I have a few friends with the valet's and all report super easy to setup but think the performance is lower than their old routers. </s>
<s> With all the great choices this is why I write to pass them up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> to consider. </s>
<s> I have found some good reviews on the 3700 around the internet. </s>
<s> The only concern seems to be a lack of network printer support, but that's about it. </s>
<s> Do you think the 3700 would work good for my application, which is: 3 computers running Windows 7 connected to the router via ethernet cables 2 Ipods and 1 ipad using wi-fi within 50 ft 1 printer which is going to be connected to 2 computers via usb splitter Also, maybe you can help me understand why, when I am paying for 1.5 mbps dsl, and the internet speed tests show that I am getting around that, does my computer show all download speeds at a max of 171 kbps (that's not why I'm replacing the router)? </s>
<s> My computer has a 10/100/1000 ethernet port, and the Motorola 3347 has a 10/100 spec. </s>
<s> Is there something I need to, or can do to increase my speed. </s>
<s> My computer is: NZXT w/Windows 7 64-bit Core i7 processor 12 GB RAM 10/100/1000 ethernet card Can you help me with this? </s>
<s> Thank you sir. </s>
<s> That anyone I know uses. </s>
<s> I think it's because as they replace printers they get the printers that have wifi. </s>
<s> Even worse, a printer that didn't come with wifi is often a poor choice to attach to any printer server. </s>
<s> Sorry, I can't explain download speeds very well. </s>
<s> Or rather while I have explained it in the past it appears I do a poor job. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just have a hard time understanding at times. </s>
<s> I re-read your previous posts and the little light came on regarding internet speeds and connectivity speeds between networked computers. </s>
<s> Next time I just need to read a little more slowly. </s>
<s> Thank you for the time you spent with me on this issue Bob. </s>
<s> You jave no idea how much you helped me. </s>
<s> And you have given me a lot to ponder. </s>
<s> I'll quit bugging you about it. </s>
<s> Have a good one. </s>
<s> I would recommend you to buy LINKSYS WRT120N WIRELESS-N BROADBAND RTR. </s>
<s> It is cheap and I had it for almost 2 years. </s>
<s> I didn't have any problem at all. </s>
