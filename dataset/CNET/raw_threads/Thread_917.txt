I am currentlly putting together a computer with a quad core processor and want to be able to add two video cards and a physics accelerator so I expect the computer to get pretty hot. I have looked at the Asus Arctic Square ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835101010&Tpk=asus%2barctic%2bsquare ) and the Zalman CNPS9700 Led Fan ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835118019 )and they both have good reviews. I plan on having a case with clear sides and in the case there are a few blue LDS so I would prefer if it went with the style, looked nice, and wasn't out of place but it also has to be good at cooling the system because I would like the computer to be as QUIET as possible. Any suggestions would be great! Thanks, Chris

It does help to have good air flow in the case though, specially with that many graphics cards.
