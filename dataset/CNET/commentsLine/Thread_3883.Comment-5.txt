i think you need to take into consideration what your system is now.
case in point: my own xp pro, 2000+ athlon (1.67 ghz), 512 ddr ram @ 266 front side bus.
put in an fx5900 xt card.
plays far cry a little bit better at medium and low resolutions w/aa turned off.
my daughter's recently upgraded system: p4 2.8 ghz celeron-d, 512 ddr ram @ 533 mhz fsb.
her system plays almost equally as well with a ti4200 vid card.
point is, i have a better videcard, but there's obviously a bottleneck caused by my slower cpu and fsb.
check your system specs before you spend a lot of money on a vid card they may not meet your expectations if your system isn't up to snuff.
even if your system is up to snuff, i have a persoanl bias against ati boards.
i've heard more stories about the catalyst drivers hosing people's systems, or the cards not working in a windows box.
but that's my bias and what i've heard from friends.
using a high-end card on a low end system is like putting premium gasoline in a motor-scooter.
you'd more than likely be wasting money.
