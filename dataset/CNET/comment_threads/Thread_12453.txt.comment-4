If I were to build such I'd be looking at the Quad Core, 2GB RAM, SATA RAID and what card I can afford from http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/07/03/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ For the power supply the C2D wouldn't need much over the 400Watt mark (depends on the video card) and the Core Quad would have me look for the 500 and up units.
