thank you frank, i am currently using a program called avronis's true image.
this is on a 3rd hd in my current computer.
each fri after a full virus scan, it automatically run's to take a snapshot of my ''c'' drive for a backup.
so the mirror feature would not be needed.
with that in mind, do you have suggestion's as to the way to set the raid on the new computer?
