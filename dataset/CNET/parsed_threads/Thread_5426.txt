<s> Hello Ive done something really stupid. </s>
<s> I sent my computer off for repair (Apple Powerbook G4) but as it was not going to be ready before I left on my travels I asked the repair company to send me my hard drive (60GB). </s>
<s> I put the hard drive in a caddy and connected it to my friends Mac (heres the stupid bit) I put an AC power source and not DC as it said on the caddy and now my friends (ex) USB port dosnt work nor does my hard drive. </s>
<s> I have tried it in a new caddy but it still does not work. </s>
<s> Does anybody have any ideas? </s>

<s> Just as a matter of interest, who makes the &quot;caddy&quot; that takes a Laptop HD and makes it connect to a USB port? </s>
<s> Sounds like a piece of kit that could come in handy. </s>
<s> I use an adapter to connect laptop drives to an IDE cable and take power from the computers power supply or from an external drive enclosure. </s>
<s> My other question is how do you put AC into a device that only needs DC? </s>
<s> Sounds like a design flaw. </s>
<s> On another note, was the HD working before you sent the machine away and does the drive only fit into the caddy, one way. </s>
<s> How do you determine which pins carry the DC voltage for the drive? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> When you installed the hard drive mechanism in the drive case, you would have seen the electronics on one side of the drive. </s>
<s> One item you did not see was the motor that drives the spindle that spins the platters (at 7200 rpm) that hold the data. </s>
<s> Also not visible to you are the armature mechanisms that hold the drive heads that move across the platters that read and write the data. </s>
<s> If the external circuit board blew out, that might be easy for a drive repair/data recovery company to fix. </s>
<s> Chances are pretty good that in addition to blowing out that circuit board, the spindle motor and the armature mechanisms were impacted by the surge in AC power. </s>
<s> There is a slight chance that the heads (being held by the armatures) went bananas and could have scruffed the platter surfaces. </s>
<s> If only external stuff was impacted, that is one thing - but if anything internal was impacted, the only way to get to the data is to actually open the drive - in a special &quot;clean room&quot; and with special tools read the platters sector by sector and recover whatever may be recoverable. </s>
<s> I presume you had no data back ups... Bummer. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
