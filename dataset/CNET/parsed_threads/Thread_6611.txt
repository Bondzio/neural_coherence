<s> Here is the short of it 1) My PC froze. </s>
<s> 2) I rebooted because it would not respond. </s>
<s> 3) I received &quot;Boot disk failure load system disk&quot;. </s>
<s> 4) I selected Repair in the windows xp home edition setup menu. </s>
<s> 5) I received the message &quot;Setup did not find any hard disk drives&quot; I moved the hard disk drive to another pc and it booted from the drive in question just fine so this problem is not my hard drive. </s>
<s> I attempted to reload windows xp using a new SATA cable and a new hard disk and I received the same messages described above. </s>
<s> I tried this install using all 4 SATA ports and had the same errors. </s>
<s> I am thinking maybe a bad SATA controller on my MSI AMD motherboard? </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Installing XP to a SATA hard drive is not simple enough. </s>
<s> Not to duplicate all the thousands of posts I'll keep it short. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You must have a XP SP2 CD or newer PLUS (read 2, 3) 2. </s>
<s> Try the BIOS setting to enable IDE emulation or disable AHCI. </s>
<s> No, I didn't read your motheboard manual. </s>
<s> Just sharing what I try. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If your motherboard doesn't do that, use the drivers from the machine's maker they gave you on the F6 FLOPPY DISKETTE to give XP SATA support. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> 1) I am using XP SP2 CD 2) IDE emulation is enabled Any other ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Take it back to its maker for correction or fixes. </s>
<s> As described in first post, this was a working pc until a few weeks ago. </s>
<s> When you say &quot;it's&quot; defective, what are you referring to? </s>
<s> As far as the setup, it was working fine until this message appeared. </s>
<s> I have tested the following: 1) Both hard drives are recognized in another pc and Windows XP boots correctly. </s>
<s> 2) I tried reconnecting the hard drives using a new SATA cable and that didn't make a difference. </s>
<s> I am thinking that maybe the SATA controller went bad? </s>
<s> At this point I am following up on the warranty for the mother board. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> My bet is the motherboard. </s>
<s> It could be settings but if they don't reveal how to set it then it's just a bad board. </s>
