Hi, My current system comprises of the following, of which I am looking to upgrade the motherboard: Processor: 6.00 AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Motherboard: ASUS M2A-VM1.XX Hard drive: Hitachi HDT 500Gig SATA 2 x 1G Ram NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT IEEE 1394 Firewire card I have 3 main uses for this PC, which are: 1.

That is, isn't wiring something any skilled technician be able to handle and wouldn't have to find a motherboard with the exact pin for pin connections? Hint: There is no standard for the onboard audio connections. Bob

The MB is socket AM2 & the ram is unbranded DDR2 & the only other numbers on each stick is 667. Unfortunately I can not find the invoice which lists the specific details of the pc's components. Hope this is helpful. Ian

For info on your mobo download Belarc Advisor http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html Find what free pci slots are available and buy the appropriate cards. Choose a capture card that does not require a seperate audio connection, and problem solved. My Compro Digital/Anolouge TV tuner capture card requires no connection to the sound card. No doubt there others.
9661	7	287100	2725653	2725404	ramarc	3/9/08 4:30 PM	1.2050802E12	there's no reason to replace that mobo	it's up-to-date. here's the link for your motherboard (mobo): http://usa.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&l2=101&l3=496 your mobo uses standardized usb pinouts. if your firewire card has an internal port, it will be standardized also. your mobo has front-panel audio port (page 1-30) and an s/pdif port (page 1-28) with simple and fully documented pinouts. if you're still having problems connecting your multifunction panel, you should replace it, and not the motherboard.

Just like to say thanks to everyone for their replies. I have taken on board all your comments and suggestions. I can now plan what hardware I must have and find a way to achieving the connectivity that I require. Regards Ian
