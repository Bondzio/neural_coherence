<s> wher can i build my own costume gaming pc for low prices </s>
<s> What is a low price to you for a gaming system? </s>
<s> less than $1000 </s>
<s> cyberpowersystems.com and ibuypower.com </s>
<s> Well, you can custom build with just about any of the computer companies like Dell, Gateway, HP/Compaq, Velocity Micro, I Buy Power, ABS Computer Tech, Monarch Computers, American Computeh, cyber-Power, etc... </s>
<s> I didn't list the major high end gaming custom computer companies. </s>
<s> But, with $1000 (not including a monitor or printer) you will not be traveling with the high end gamers. </s>
<s> However, you will be able to play the latest/greatest games without problems. </s>
<s> (Just a high end Video Card will eat up $500+, and heavens to betsy if you go with a 10,000 RPM Hard Drive, high end CPU/Mobo,& RAM.) </s>
<s> The main guts for a gaming PC is the Video Card, RAM, and CPU. </s>
<s> It is a matter of going thru with each company trying to get the best CPU/Motherboard, then Video Card, and RAM. </s>
<s> Sometimes you can skimp on the video card and RAM getting a less powerful one when configuring with a company, keeping in mind that you can beat their prices by buying separately elsewhere, removing the lesser ones, and installing a more powerfully one yourself, and still stay within the $1000 limit (without monitor/printer). </s>
<s> I'm off to Church right now, then to watch NASCAR on TV, but when I get some time in a day or so, I'll see what I can scratch up for you, but suggest you take pen in hand, and with fingers roaming over your keyboard try to do it yourself. </s>
