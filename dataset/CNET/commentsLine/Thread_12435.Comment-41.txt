i've been using western digital drives in my pc & all i build.
haven't seen a drive yet that had trouble.
noteworthy, i am guessing here, but isn't the maxtor drives you're getting the ata133 ones?
if so, does your system board support ata133?
i know mine supports up to ata100 in eide mode.
wd only has ata100 in eide drives.
sata is up to ata150.
my wd drives have all been silent while in operation.
only &quot;click&quot; i ever hear is on shutdown when the head parks.
normal there.never a noise while read & write.
