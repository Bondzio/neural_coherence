<s> I have a maxtor 4 which at times is not recognised by my Dell Inspiron 530 (Windows XP Home). </s>
<s> The message I normally get is: one or more of your components is not recognised. </s>
<s> When I run the cursor over the Maxtor icon it says MAXTOR STATUS ICON NO DRIVE CONNECTED, so at that moment I have to switch around the components attached via USB ports, because at that time I cannot access the Maxtor. </s>
<s> so could you assist with eradicating this problem </s>
<s> Will do that. </s>
<s> Not to duplicate all that's been written about USB powered drives such as http://www.chipchick.com/2007/10/another_addition_to_the_portable_hard_drive_-_maxtor_one_touch_mini_4.html and more the troubles are sadly a fallout of USB supplying only so much power and an industry willing to sell stuff that may work 98% of the time. </s>
<s> To improve your odds do this: 1. </s>
<s> Only use it when the AC cord and AC power is used on your laptop. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Use the dual USB power cable. </s>
<s> No, it's not a new issue. </s>
<s> Same old one. </s>
