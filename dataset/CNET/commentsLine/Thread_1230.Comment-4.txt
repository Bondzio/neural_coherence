hey bob, thanks for the reply.
i do realize that most apps in windows can only access 2gb max, my problem is that i'm getting info that tells me that i have 4gb installed but only 2gb are available.
for example in my system properties it says 2gb.
i have tried the 3gb switch but it changed nothing.
thanks again.
