I'm wondering how much this computer would go up for (it's value) currently. The computer's specification: Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 2.40GHz - L2 cache: 256kb Asrock Motherboard: P4i45GV R5.0 Intel(R) 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics Controller Video Card 256MB RAM 16x CD/RW + DVD (not-DVD RW) Windows XP If there is anything I've missed please state so, thank you.

Actually the XP OS cd if not OEM from the likes of Gateway, Dell, etc., maybe the full value of the system more than anything else. Restore/recovery disks must be the actual disks shipped with system. In other words, if the XP CD is a &quot;retail version&quot; it has value. Your Asrock mtrbd., as well as the low amount of ram and Celeron cpu is on the low-end. More than anything else, the buyer would be advised not to buy from a knowledgeable person, considering what maybe required to get into a higher level, etc.. A basic system from eMachine while more expensive starts out offering much more and just as important, support. tada -----Willy
