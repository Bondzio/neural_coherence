I have these specs: AMD Anthlon XP 2400+ 640 Mb.
PC-2100 RAM 160 Gb.
Maxtor Diamondmax 9 Hard Drive Nvidia Geforce FX 5700VE 256 Video Mb.
250 Watt Power Supply MSI MS-2003 Motherboard I'm pretty much a gaming enthusiast, but I been experiencing laqs and crashes with the most recent PC games like BF2 and Doom 3.
Can anyone tell me if my PC can still hold itself for gaming.
Anyone can tell me what to upgrade for better performance without breaking the bank?
