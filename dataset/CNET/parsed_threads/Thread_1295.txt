<s> Hi, I have a 4 year old Dell Dimension 4550 PC desktop. </s>
<s> The PC came with 256mg RAM, and I added 512mg RAM to it 3 years ago. </s>
<s> I don't want to toss this PC, but it's running a tad sluggish. </s>
<s> Would increasing the current 768mg RAM to 1gb RAM (max it can take=1gb RAM) would make an appreciable difference? </s>
<s> The cost would be about $75 (if I bought through Dell). </s>
<s> $ is not the issue, but I also don't want to waste my time if consensus says &quot;the PC is too old for the additional RAM to make a difference.&quot; I use the PC for web-browsing, email, MS Office, and the kids sometimes play not-so-intense web-based games. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>

<s> Before you upgrade your memory look at your swap space or virtual memory. </s>
<s> right click on My Computer / System properties/ Advanced / Performance / settings. </s>
<s> This is how much space on the disk (usually C) you have allowed for big memory applications or multi-tasking when you launch a bunch of programs to have for swapping and saving information. </s>
<s> If you've filled up the C drive and that space has decreased or has never been increased it might be why you've gotten sluggish. </s>
<s> Then I would say look to other sources for that older memory, it'll probably be cheaper elsewhere including used off e-bay and will answer your question. </s>
<s> Memory is the best performance enchancer most of the time. </s>
<s> Past that some of these $399 systems being offered now sure perform better than older systems, with smaller amounts of memory but faster bus speeds, CPU's and graphics. </s>
<s> light of use. </s>

<s> If you're running XP OS, 1gb of ram is the most practical and useful amount of ram to have. </s>
<s> In that light though don't expect globs of improvement it simply will be better overall. </s>
<s> You can however try to do the usual tweeking and such in order that the system itself can best run. </s>
<s> That usually means, cleaning of excess or unwanted files or pgms.. and clean and defrag the HD. </s>
<s> Use a registry cleaner. </s>
<s> I'm sure you can find outside of Dell, other ram sources for your model at less cost and again in that light it won't hurt to have 1gb of ram. </s>
<s> If you're running WinMe, having 768mb of ram isn't that good as 512mb is best for overall operation, but you didn't mention what OS you had. </s>
<s> is say that as 512mb was best because WinME had a glitch of a ram issue and it never was resolved, if I recall right even with the small fix. </s>
<s> But no WinMe, don't worry. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
