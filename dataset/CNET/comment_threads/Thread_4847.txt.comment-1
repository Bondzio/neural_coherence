i wanna connect 10meter usb extender to a 4ports usb hub.
But it is not working because it said unknown device.
It shows &quot;Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems.
(Code 43)&quot;.
It is working fine if connecting 10meter usb extender to a mouse or keyboard.
It just can't connect to a usb hub.
So is the power problem of the usb hub or i can't connect extender to hub?
