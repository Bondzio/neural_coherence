John Robie, I respect your posts here.
You always prove to be well researched.
However, I will NEVER post a suggestion that goes against a manufacturers recommendations while it is still under warranty.
The ATI X700 is a very good card and for the marginal difference between it and the nvidia, why go against manufacturer recommendations?
I own a recently purchased T6212, the same as mentioned in the &quot;disable onboard graphics&quot; question and have added 1 gig of Corsair dual channel memory and an ATI based ABIT RX600PRO.
I have not tried to o/clock and I have yet to find something the video can't do and my card is one step below the X700!
I watch streaming video and do video editing and the X600PRO is perfect.
The X700 goes one better.
Keith.
