Bob, I am not at home right now, so I can't give you complete specifics.
It is a Compaq and I bought it used a few years back.
Having said that, my complete hard drive was tranfered from the computer that I had long before this Compaq that we are talking about now.
Beyond that, I can't tell you anything until I get home and see the information you require.
As it is Windows 98SE, I just assumed that there was a standard Windows 98SE driver or update that needed to be downloaded.
Tell me exactly what you need to know and I will provide that when I get home from work.
Thank you very much.
