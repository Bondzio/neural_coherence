you can just install the soundcard without disabling the onboard, when you install the drivers from Creative it will set the Audigy as the primary audio device, and Windows will handle disabling the onboard sound as for what damasta is talking about, the ZS Gamer is nothing different from the 2 ZS, except it includes a lot of free games, the Platinum is no different from the 2 ZS, except it includes the front panel I/O and a remote...along with a slightly different software suite
