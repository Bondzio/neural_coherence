<s> I cannot get my ATI All in Wonder 9800 AGP to post when combined with the Asus A8N Deluxe MB. </s>
<s> The ATI board works on an older Asus MB and the MB works with a PCI video board. </s>
<s> After much conversation with the ATI people I am concerned that the AGP slot in the MB is defective. </s>
<s> Has anyone gotten this combination to work? </s>
<s> The ATI people won't comment on this, and the ASUS people will not reply. </s>
<s> Thanks, David </s>
<s> The ATI ALL in WOnder 9800 AGP works on an AGP port and cannot on a PCI video board. </s>
<s> The Asus A8n deluxe board has PCI-Express slots and ordinary PCI slots, none of which works with the card!!! </s>
<s> Suggest get a new card. </s>
<s> The 9800 is comparable to an X600 which costs $200. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> No Sir, the A8N Deluxe I have does have a AGP slot. </s>
<s> Note that Asus makes at least 3 boards that start with A8N. </s>
<s> Now, can you answer the question. </s>
<s> Thanks, David </s>
<s> David, unfortunately you have run into a problem that ATI refuses to deal with (or admit to). </s>
<s> There is an energy spike that occurs with this card during bootup that causes many newer mobo's to auto shut down. </s>
<s> I went thru the whole bit with an Abit AS8 V board and finally had to buy a different video card to fix the problem. </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with your mobo. </s>
<s> The only fix I have heard (which isn't really a very good one) is to disconnect the secondary power cable to the video card for about 2 seconds at the start of booting up and then plug it in. </s>
<s> What a pain every time you start your system!! </s>
<s> Until ATI deals with the problem your 9800 AIW is going to be useless. </s>
<s> My best advice is to get a new TV tuner (an HD one) and avoid ATI. </s>
<s> It sucks that I paid almost $400 for my AIW when it was newly released and like you I rebuilt my new system around the darned thing (instead of a newer PCI-e system and core 2 duo cpus which my AS8 V can't support). </s>
