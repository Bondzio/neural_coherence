Run msconfig.exe and try booting in safe mode and then normal mode and see if it helps. If not, go into hardware settings in control panels system icon and look for devices related to sound which may be disabled or in conflict. You should also run Windows Update and contact Microsoft for a $35 incident if necessary.
