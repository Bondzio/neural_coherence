So is it worth the trouble of going P4?
I don't have the money to get a new PC.
I've already upgraded to 512 RAM, bought a new DVD burner, 160MB external HD, and 2.0 USB PCI card.
So I'm pretty much at a point of no turning back to buy a new PC.
If I could upgrade my processor I'd be good for a long time and have saved some cash.
So mother board, power supply and the processor I understand, but you say I need a new tower case?
That's sound like some work transfering everything over, or did I misunderstand.
