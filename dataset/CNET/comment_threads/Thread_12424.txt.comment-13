You are correct.
I got what I paid for.
I had seen a ZDnet forum where you explained &quot;The main difference is that the Pent4 6xx series has the 64-bit support technology (EM64T) and 2MB of L2 cache, whereas the 5xx series does not have the the 64-bit and has up to 1MB of L2 cache.
The 6xx series also has the PCI-Express bus along with introducing the Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology (EIST) on desktop processors.&quot; I had &quot;copied & pasted&quot; that onto a WORD document.
The Belarc link you provided told me that I had the 2MB of L2 cache (it did not mention the 64 bit technology) but I think I can safely assume I got what I paid for based on the L2 cache size.
I appreciate your help.
Further, I enjoy following what you write because I am not a computer geek and appreciate the way you can put things in layman's terms.
