My inquiry is a general question about LCD monitors about which I hope someone can enlighten me.
My current LCD monitor is a 19&quot; monitor.
I am looking to buy a new larger LCD monitor for a new computer system I am building.
I noticed that there are many new larger LCD monitors.
All of the larger LCD monitors are wide-screen monitors.
That is, they retain the same height as my current 19&quot; monitor but are wider, anywhere from 20&quot; wide to 30&quot; wide within a reasonable price range.
While I am interested in some of these new LCD monitors for my new computer system I am curious as to why the larger LCD monitor technology are all wider than my current monitor but not proportionally taller as far as the display area goes.
Why is that ?
I would have assumed that as newer, larger LCD monitors are being engineered that the display area of the monitor would be proportionally larger so that it could display both a greater width and a greater height.
