A few days I ago i reset my router, because it had blocked my school website, but nothing else. I reset the router, and I was able to get on my school website, but I wasn't able to use my pc. My computer is attached to the modem, (don't have internal modem) The cable goes into the modem, then I have a cat 5 cable, that connects to the router, and then had another cat 5 cable connect to the pc. I don't have the any information on the router, other than its a netgear wireless router mr814v2. A friend of mine suggested I had bad cables, (wasn't a problem), type ipconfig in the cmd, but didn't do anything. Please let me know if anyone has any suggestions. I have a g4 mac 10.2, 867 processor 768mem compaq presario labtop, Xp HomeEdition, amd 4, proc 489, 496 memory

My mac is connected to the modem, then connected to the router. then I a cat5 cable is connected going from the router, to the pc. I only have one router, everything is daisy chained to each other. The pc has cat5 cable that goes from the to the router to the pc's port. When I had the cable installed it was installed on my computer. All did to get the pc online was plugin a cat5 cable. I had to reset my router, and I think thats when the connection got lost on the pc. I tried a repair option in windows, is there a way I can tell is what its ip address should be?

I've never seen such a setup. I'd ask who designed it to help you make it work. Bob
