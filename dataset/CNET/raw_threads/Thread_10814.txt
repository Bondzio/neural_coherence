So just need a basic PC I am thinking of staying away from Vista until all its bugs are gone Can you please advise how this system is? Also is it ok to go with a 'refurbished' system? Thanks Rajat Agrawal

She does what you are wanting to do plus she is a gamer.The only thing different is she installed a graphics card and upgraded to Vista Home premium which runs great. As for the re-furb thing, I have never bought one that way and don't know anyone who has. What kind of warrenty are they giving? If Fry's stands behind it, that is an excellent price for that computer.

Why did your friend have to install a graphics card - I thought the Nvidia Geforce 7500 LE graphics card that comes with the PC is a high-end card and good enough for gaming Thanks for your feedback

He said she wanted something heavy duty with 512MG of memory on the video card. He said she also had to have the power supply changed out for that card as the 1657C comes with a 300watt power supply and the new card needed at least 450watt.

It is intergrated, there is no real card, it is a chip built into the motherboard and it lags really bad in FPS' and any other game with decent graphics. The only plus about that is you have alot of open ports so you can buy any card you want and not worry about taking something else out.
