<s> Hi to everybody, just got my pc parts from newegg, but encountered a problem with this mobo; in the users guide that came with it, chapter2:hardware setup 1.jumper setting: set the cpu external clock, frequency ratio and the cpu voltage according to the instruction printed on the manual or silkscreen printed on the mainboard. </s>
<s> Now, i read all the guide carefully but didnt find anything mentioning where and how to setup jumpers for any cpu. </s>
<s> Does that mean that the mobo is jumperless? </s>
<s> (on the mobo i found only 4 jumpers(jp1(cmos clear), jp2(cpu fan),jp3&jp4(both 3 and 4 are power On by usb) i m just afraid im missing something here. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> What's happened to their support. </s>
<s> Do they just dump this stuff in your lap and run away? </s>
<s> Why would you buy for such people? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> BIOS area?? </s>
<s> Most newer mobos only require setting one parameter. </s>
<s> Are you sure that &quot;cpu external clock ratio&quot; is the correct terminology?? </s>
<s> Modern CPU's have their multiplier [clock ratio] top locked [you can lower it if overclocking] What settings are allowed? </s>
<s> my bet would be that you are setting the memory bus speed, so that the correct FSB gets set. </s>
<s> What speed memory are you using??? </s>
<s> Seems that Robert thinks that newegg sold you a kit. </s>
<s> They are only a parts supplier. </s>
<s> automatically. </s>
<s> Just set the mobo up with CPU with HSF, memory, video, and monitor. </s>
<s> Front panel connections, nothing else. </s>
<s> Turn power on and get the first video screen. </s>
<s> Get that, shutdown and hook up a keyboard and turn on again and go into BIOS, it will show the CPU frequency et al. </s>
<s> Don't bother installing anything else until you get this far. </s>
<s> If the speeds are incoreect, the mobo should default to the lowest to protect the CPU. </s>
<s> The voltage sttings are probably for overclockers use. </s>
<s> Doesn't the mob manual show a default setting for the voltage??? </s>
<s> With that the mobo sets it automatically for the CPU. </s>
<s> yes, i used the correct terminology. </s>
<s> In the user guide there is a two page bios setup program chapter from which the only thing about voltage and stuff is 'frequency/voltage control' allowing to adjust freq/volt of mobo. </s>
<s> Im using roswell 512 ddram, pc3200. </s>
