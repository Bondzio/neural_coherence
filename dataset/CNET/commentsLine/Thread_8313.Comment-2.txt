out of all the vendors/makers out there, ibm is the most helpful.
they have a support website and provide the details you need.
they really do, check there.
since laptops vary, i &quot;assume&quot; this maybe one where you lift the kybd.
up by unlatching a 2nd set of locks where you lift the lcd up(when latched), check there.
that's a guess... next time, give *full* details of what your model is.
