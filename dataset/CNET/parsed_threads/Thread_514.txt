<s> Hi; I just bought Skyrim for the PC. </s>
<s> I fit all of the essential requirements, and the game will play. </s>
<s> But for the recommended I need a better video card. </s>
<s> I have an ATI Radeon HD 4350. </s>
<s> Apparently that's not enough. </s>
<s> The game is a pretty laggy (enough for it to be annoying.) </s>
<s> Here is the requirements it says I need. </s>
<s> Any recommendations on what I should get? </s>
<s> I have been thinking about upgrading for a while, so I am willing to spend a fair amount. </s>
<s> Nothing outrageous, though. </s>
<s> I don't do THAT much gaming. </s>
<s> Here is my PC specs. </s>
<s> And unless you are ready to install a new big power supply I can only offer the that 5450 can drop in without another change. </s>
<s> And is cheep at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102882 http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/4926494171 covers this again. </s>
<s> Once you admit that a new PSU is needed you pick your card from the usual list at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&objectID=c01894996 has ALL the specs on this machine. </s>
<s> At least it will accept common power supplies and video cards. </s>

<s> You need a video card that's compatible with your motherboard. </s>
<s> Your pics don't tell about that. </s>
<s> Common video slots at the moment are pci-e (x1) and pci-e x16. </s>
<s> Don't buy an x16 card if your motherboard doesn't support it! </s>
<s> Less than a month ago they published a new video card review on tomshardware.com: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html This is considered authorative, but it won't harm to look at a few other reviews for the cards that are on your shortlist after studying this. </s>

<s> What..? </s>
<s> The first pic is the same as the second! </s>
<s> I thought I fixed that before I posted. </s>
<s> Here the requirements: http://i50.tinypic.com/14c4scx.jpg &lt;div&gt;Here is the motherboard: http://i47.tinypic.com/s45c1k.jpg &lt;/div&gt; IPIBL-LB, If I am reading it correctly. </s>
<s> From what I have learned, the motherboard does indeed support x16. </s>
<s> The one to the left of the fan does not look good. </s>
<s> Could be the picture but it's a sign I look for when inspecting machines. </s>
<s> More at http://www.badcaps.net/pages.php?vid=5 Bob </s>
<s> Might be - hopefully - a crappy picture. </s>
<s> I wasn't using a great camera, and the lighting was terrible. </s>
<s> There was some dust in there I had to blow out. </s>
