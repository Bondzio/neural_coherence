<s> I am looking for a new computer. </s>
<s> I have close to $700.00 to spend. </s>
<s> I have read the specs for sims 3 but for one,I want to make sure it has more than the basics. </s>
<s> Since adding Custom Content and expansion packs will slow things down. </s>
<s> The computer I had fits the specs but If I added a bunch of CC's ( not even a quarter of what I used to have on SIms 2 )it would slow way down. </s>
<s> I dont' want that. </s>
<s> I want a computer that can handle lots of Custom content, since that's half the fun of the Sims is adding custom content..and getting more expansion packs. </s>
<s> Secondly, I have no idea of how to covert those things mentioned in the specs into other products. </s>
<s> There are so many names and brands and numbers of processors and graphics cards, it's just very confusing to know what is equal to what. </s>
<s> I am currently looking at a computer a gamer suggested to me. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone could tell me if the specs sound good for Sims 3..I also want to run &quot;Daz&quot; on it..if any of you are familiar with that.it's not a game but a 3d graphics program.. Anyways I guess, mainly concentrate on the Sims 3 if you dont' know of the other. </s>
<s> Whatever works for Sims 3 should work for that as well. </s>
<s> Please let me know if the computer below is good for SIms 3 or if you have any other suggestions. </s>

<s> &quot;Parts 90 days limited&quot; is a terrible warranty. </s>
<s> But my wife's machine loads Sims 3 slowly but plays just fine. </s>
<s> It's a lowly Celeron 2+GHz with 2GB RAM and some PCIe ATI HD 2400 card. </s>
<s> Your machine exceeds that in many ways. </s>
<s> I doubt Sims 3 will be an issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks for your input. </s>
<s> Yeah not crazy bout the warranty..I thought maybe they had some kind of plan that you could buy to extend that warranty but I'm not sure..although I have had long ones before and then my machine would go like a month after the warranty was over..oh well, anyway thanks for your opinion. </s>
<s> You did not state in your original post the current specs for your computer; depending on your PC skills (and the age of your computer), for $700 you could upgrade the individual components inside it, and get extended warranties on each component (the manufacturer warranties are usually pretty good). </s>
<s> thanks but I'm not interested in upgrading. </s>
<s> I have already upgraded once and I really don't want to go through that again...besides the computer's getting pretty old and it's not really up to being upgraded anymore than it already is. </s>
