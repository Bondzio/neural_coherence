i have the gateway software package that came new with one of the machines.
along with it (98se) the keycodes and gateway recovery disk.
i had to put a nic card in it, clean the lint and dirt, installed a new cmos battery.
i installed ubuntu on both machines.
i was going to offer them to someone for $50 apiece (includes crt monitor, mouse and keyboard, speakers.)
i just wondered if that was too much.
