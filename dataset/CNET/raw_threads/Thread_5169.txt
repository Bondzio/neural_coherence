When trying to play &quot;Age of Conan&quot; or &quot;FreeRealms&quot;, or the Star Trek online beta after a few minutes I get a crash, which according to Win7 is being caused by ATIKMAG.... Just upgraded drivers and Catalyst control center to 09.12 (also tried removing the catalyst control center because a post on the web said that might be the problem (it wasn't). Tried switching off Aero, tried 9.12 hotfix, tried re-seating memory (ran windows &quot;memory diagnostics utility&quot; showed no problems) nothing doing any good... Help please!

Sometimes a small problem can cause so much chain reaction. Right now we've got a lot on our plate if we go at it one by one, but here's are some places to start: Insufficient Power Bad Memory Modules Over Clocking Motherboard/Memory Compatibility Overheating Defective Motherboard

This changed it to 1333, haven't had a chance to see if it did any good. Did notice that a hardware monitor program showed something in red zone heat right after re-booting (after one of these crashes), unfortunately I'm not sure exactly what it's telling me is the particular heat problem... It lists Mainboard (ok), CPU (ok), temp 3 (which has no sensor), and CPU0 Core (which is where the red showed up). why it shows CPU ok, and CPU0 Core as a problem, I don't know what it's listing as this CPU0 Core that i need to address....

Ok that you changed it to stock which may help but have the machine's builder pull the heatsink off the CPU and drop some fresh heatsink paste there. Then have them make sure the heatsink is in solid contact and fans to working. For heat issues it's very important to clear those up as it ages parts and machine quickly. A 5 year machine will see trouble after the first year. Bob
