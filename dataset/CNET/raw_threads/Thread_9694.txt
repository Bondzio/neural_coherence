If not and you actually unplug the card when &quot;ON&quot;, you probably did damage. If the cable, make sure to inspect the pins aren't bent or pushed-in. Otherwise, get a new card but be prepared for a possible mtrbd. replacement too, if you're not lucky. At least that's what you post appears to me. -----Willy

I have done it with just about any type of system you have seen, over 1000 different systems at least. I frequently update a system by putting another one next to it and moving the video cable back and forth as I have to change settings, in one session I may do it 25 or more times.

You need to take it out and plug it in again, or maybe just push it in a little harder. If that doesn't fix it, you may have damaged the card, but that is very unlikely.
