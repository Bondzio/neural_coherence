i charge it up every night, and i have to use it from battery life because i use this about 3 or 4 times each day, every day and after each time i use it i have to be able to put it away quickly, without going through the doo-dah of packing the charger away.
i mean, i don't really want to use the charger unless i really have to, e.g.
when it says 'plug in or find another power source' or 'reserved battery level (7%)'.
also, if there is a plug socket nearby and the netbook is already charged up and i plug it in, it does that horrible sizzling noise which does my head in.
