the two you mentioned are decent brands.
some users *may* complain of noise levels but even with good brands, there are so many models it does get confusing.
i suggest besides using a wattage calculator buy the biggest hunking psu and brandname and provide for a stable system.
the better the psu the more the cost, but cost does pay back in a stable system.
take into acct.
if it fails it may take other devices/components with it.
as for noise, look for the db levels as part of the specs.,, however as stated so many psus out there check at these websites and others:    for cost comparisons.
