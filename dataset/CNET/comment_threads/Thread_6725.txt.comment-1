I have a computer running Win ME.
I want to transfer the files from that hard drive to a computer running Win 2000.
Is it possable to take the HD from the ME computer and put it in the 2000 computer as a 2nd drive?
I would then copy the files to the drive that has 2000 installed on it.
I would then put the ME drive back in the computer that it was in first.
Will all the programs work ok?
