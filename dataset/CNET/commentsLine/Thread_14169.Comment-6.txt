as you have described the macbook you are using as only having 512 mb of ram... i would suspect that this could be part of the problem.
you say you're familiar with windows machines.
how much performance would you expect from an xp or vista box with only 512 mb of ram?
there are several things you could do to help keep your aunts' macbook running smoothly.
one of the major maintenance procedures is repairing permissions using disc utility.
another would be to limit the amount of open programs you have running at any given time.
another is to keep plenty of open room on your hard drive.
bottom line however is the fact that you're not gonna get much from this computer with so little memory installed.
btw... do us all a favor and go back and reread your original post.
telling folks that their computer of choice sux in their own forum... informing us how much better a windows machine is... complaining some more... and then challenging us to persuade you to buy a mac... is pretty unreasonable public behavior.
i would suggest that if you really need help, then asking for it politely next time will get you the &quot;kind&quot; response you seem to have been expecting.
even a zoned in, tranced out dude like you oughta know, if your throw an elbow in the middle of a trip hop rave and smack someone, then you oughta apologize instead of being surprised if you get elbowed back.
ciao!
