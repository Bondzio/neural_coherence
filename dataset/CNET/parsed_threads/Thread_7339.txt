<s> Our company installs computers sytems using Tripplite (basic) UPS/battery back-up. </s>
<s> Computer and Monitor are hooked to the battery side or this ups while the printer goes into the surge protector part. </s>
<s> This has been a good set-up with HP's 5P, 6P, 2100, 2200 series. </s>
<s> We are encountering a problem with SOME 2300's, in which the printer is working fine and within a few days it will not print via LPT1. </s>
<s> Replacing the cable does not fix the problem. </s>
<s> Sometimes a full shut down (of all equipment) starts it up again. </s>
<s> We encountered that if the printer is replace, the new printer works perfectly. </s>
<s> Also, the old printer is then connected somewhere else without any problems. </s>
<s> Has anyone encountered this problem? </s>

<s> Has anyone encountered this problem?&quot; Yes. </s>
<s> But we have LJ 5mx's or such. </s>
<s> We knew to check firmware revisions to tell what exactly the models were. </s>
<s> Your view is as deep as &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot;. </s>
<s> With such a view on the hardware, my best advice is to have HP fix the ones that don't work proper. </s>

<s> Problem is that there is nothing wrong with the replaced printers. </s>
<s> In some cases it works fine at another site. </s>
<s> It's also not a driver issue since we've tried different drivers. </s>
<s> HP has something about LaserJet printers and UPS. </s>
<s> And both manufacturers (HP & Tripplite) are saying that is might be the other's fault. </s>
<s> Frankly the power draw of the laser printer zooms from almost nothing to some 1,200 Watts in about a second or less. </s>
<s> Your UPS should be something about the size of the printer to match the power requirement. </s>
<s> You can find out if its the UPS by removing it from the setup. </s>

<s> Thanks, I think that would be the best solution. </s>
<s> Although not a problem in the past series, I think 2300 needs a little more juice to bring it out of sleep mode. </s>
<s> I wanted to remove other posibilities since the 2300 is a &quot;relative&quot; new printer. </s>
