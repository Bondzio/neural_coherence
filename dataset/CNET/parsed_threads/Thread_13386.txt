<s> Have two cd drives. </s>
<s> Cd player on top, under it is a floppy drive and then the cd\rw drive. </s>
<s> There is some space and cover has been taken off for better ventilation. </s>
<s> One day the cd\rw drive was not getting read by the computer anymore. </s>
<s> It will open and close on command but it doesn't read anything. </s>
<s> Sometimes when i turn on the computer the cd drive(D) does not show up, the cd\rw drive(E) stopped showing up a while ago. </s>
<s> The cd player plays every now and then but it makes loud clicking like noises and sometimes it just freezes and does not read at all. </s>
<s> Is there anything i can do to restore them or fix them or am i too late? </s>
<s> Do i just need to buy new ones? </s>
<s> They are about 3 -4 years old. </s>
<s> Appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> These are now 10 to 20 dollar items on sale, so repairs are not an option. </s>
<s> But if you insist, here's all about CD repair: http://www.repairfaq.org/REPAIR/F_Repair.html Bob </s>
