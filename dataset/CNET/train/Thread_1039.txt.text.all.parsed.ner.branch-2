(2) why waste electricity leaving it on, even in sleep or hibernate mode? really, how lazy and selfish can we be to not shut down our computers overnight? while it's only a small amount of electricity saved by each individual computer each night, take that small amount and multiply it by 365 (nights a year) and multiply it by tens of millions of computers -- and now you're talking a lot of electricity. the only beneficiaries of leaving the computers on, even in sleep mode or hibernation, are the electric utilities. everybody else loses. and really how lazy can we be if we can't allow 30 to 120 seconds for the computer to boot fresh each day? like any of us have 30 to 120 seconds we can't spare each day of our computer using lives? it's not like we are forced to sit at our computers while they boot up. so why can't we put this debate to sleep already (pun intended)? turn it off completely and do the smart thing.
