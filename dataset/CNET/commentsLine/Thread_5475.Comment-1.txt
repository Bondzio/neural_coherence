i have a 2yr nearly 3 yrs old eee pc (a 1005ha to be exact).
i bought it for the ridiculously long battery life which was advertised at 8.5 hours but naturally it was actually 4 hours as companies like advertising battery life at double what it actually is.
i have been happy with it since now, when the battery life has much decreased (just over 2 hours now).
i have the battery conserving setting switched on with the fn keys and also in the windows settings.
does anyone have tips for conserving/increasing battery life or do i need a new battery?
