1.1.1	Hi , My system was working perfectly , sound worked great .	St
1.1.2	Then , I was going thru the menu 's in musicmatchjb , and I tried to go into player setup , and mmjb crashed .	St
1.1.3	Then , when I restarted it , I found that it would not play .	St
1.1.4	It gave a message like : mmjb failure : soundcard problem , or something like that .	St
1.1.5	I looked in device manager , and it said my sb was working , but still I had no sound .	St
1.1.6	So , I deleted the sb from the device manager , and proceeded to restart so the card would be recognized again .	St
1.1.7	A card was recoginzed , but it said & quot ; PCI multimedia device & quot ; , no SBLive ... Then , it asked for a driver which I could n't find , but would not accept any driver on the creative sblive install disk .	St
1.1.8	Next , I removed everything from the computer that I thought had to do with the sb .	St
1.1.9	First , I did add/remove programs and removed SBLive , and all software .	St
1.1.10	I removed the wave device that was added to device manager .	St
1.1.11	No sound card was listed .	St
1.1.12	I went thru and manually removed everything in the registry that had the words creative , or cddb , or anything else I thought might be related .	St
1.1.13	Now I try to restart again .	Sug
1.1.14	Same thing !	St
1.1.15	I ca n't install this card , yet I know it works .	St
1.1.16	When I got close at one point to getting it to at least install something , I would get a & quot ; ctstub & quot ; error .	St
1.1.17	I really need help .	St
1.1.18	I use the pc mainly for music anymore , and without sound , this thing is a boat anchor .	St
1.1.19	The manual says that when the dialog comes up for selecting a driver location , to cancel and insert the install disk and go thru the process .	St
1.1.20	Sometimes that goes thru , but while still in that program , the found new device ( PCI multimedia device ) comes up again .	St
1.1.21	I click cancel , and the install finishes , but no sound card is ever installed .	St
1.1.22	PLEASE HELP I have win98 installed if that helps .	St
1.1.23	I know I have been long winded , but I wanted to give as much info as I could so someone out there can understand the problem and hopefully help .	St
1.1.24	TIA , Viper	St
1.2.1	did you try re-seating the card in its slot ?	Ques
1.2.2	-- fj	St
1.3.1	The card is firmly seated in the socket .	St
1.3.2	This seems like a windows system/driver problem to me .	St
1.3.3	I removed the software and device from device manager , and reinstalled windows .	St
1.3.4	Windows did not correctly pick up the card when reinstalled .	St
1.3.5	Then , with the new windows installation , I removed all sb software and devices again .	St
1.3.6	Then , rebooted .	St
1.3.7	This time , it did recognize the card .	St
1.3.8	It recognized two things actually .	St
1.3.9	1. sblive 5.1 wave sound device and 2. pci multimedia audio device .	St
1.3.10	The only one it asked for the driver for was the pci , and I said cancel .	St
1.3.11	Then I used the sb disk to run it 's installation .	St
1.3.12	Seemed to go well , but when finished and restarted , I got the new hw found : pci mult audio device again .	St
1.3.13	I clicked cancel again .	St
1.3.14	Then went to device manager .	St
1.3.15	The soundblaster card was NOT listed .	St
1.3.16	What else can be done to get this card to install .	St
1.3.17	Where else can I get help ?	Ques
1.3.18	TIA , Viper	St
