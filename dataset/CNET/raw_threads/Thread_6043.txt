I did set my games to 5.1 or 7.1 output, so idk whats wrong. Megalodon has its own sound card, so does that mean it will totally ignore my original sound card? I have ASUS P5SD2-A mother board and it has 6 channel audio so i'll assume its integrated sound card can support 5.1 audio anyway? On to the next question, Im interested in getting a logitech G51 5.1 surround system, so as i mentioned above, will my motherboard(integrated sound card) support this system? Thanks
