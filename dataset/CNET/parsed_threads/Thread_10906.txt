<s> I am currently looking for a new desktop and don't really know which one to get. </s>
<s> I am currently looking at the new Sony VAIO, the Dell 8400, and the power mac. </s>
<s> If you have another suggestion than those listed please feel free to let me know. </s>
<s> I will primarily use the computer for gaming, downloading music, burning cds, and surfing the web. </s>
<s> Money is not really an object, so which desktop do you think is the best out there? </s>
<s> Any help is much appreciated. </s>
<s> Sony = Last in service. </s>
<s> Dell = PC with so-so service, but can be good value and good hardware support. </s>
<s> Apple = Top support, but you gotta love it. </s>

<s> If money is no object, find a site like, www.pricewatch.com,www.computergeeks.com, tigerdirect.com, there are other sites but what i'm saying is have a desktop custom built with the products you want or, better yet learn to build your own. </s>
