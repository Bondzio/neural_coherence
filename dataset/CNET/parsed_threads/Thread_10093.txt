<s> I just purchased a new Maxtor 200 gb usb 2.0 hard drive because my old drive was going to crash. </s>
<s> I transfered all of my files to the external drive and everything went fine. </s>
<s> I then installed a new internal hard drive and set up windows. </s>
<s> I loaded up the software for the Maxtor hd and everything was installed but the drive isn't showing up in my computer. </s>
<s> I set it up in disk management but when I try to double click the drive it says that it's not formatted, do i want to format now. </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> I don't want to have to reconnect the old drive and transer stuff over again. </s>
<s> Is there something I did wrong? </s>

<s> It's a common problem and could be easy to solve. </s>
