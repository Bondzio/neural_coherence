you might be able to.
go into your bios and see if there is a cpu temperature reading if you want to use the old heatsink and fan.
remember you need to grease the heatsink with the cpu.
besides, don't the cpu you have came with a heatsink and fan combo, mine did but it was a pentinum d. if not, look up a heatsink with the correct socket for the motherboard.
you can look it up on yahoo or google and find the motherboard and its socket type.
hope that helps.
