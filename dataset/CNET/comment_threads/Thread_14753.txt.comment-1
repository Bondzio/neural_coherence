I just bought an external Hard Drive which is larger and faster than my internal hard drive.
I want to take advantage of the additional speed by making my new external hard drive the boot drive where my OS (Win XP) runs.
I have been told that I should make my new external hard drive the internal hard drive and my current internal HD the external drive.
What is the best way to do this?
Should I copy Win XP onto my new drive while it is in the external mode, and what about transferring all the all the other software (eg.
office/MSIE, et) so I can run these from the new faster drive.
And is there something I need to do in the BIOS?
Thanks.
