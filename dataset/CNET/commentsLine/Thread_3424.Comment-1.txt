i have an 80gb usb iomega hd hard drive attached to a windows xp desktop.
i purchased the iomega in part because i really liked the iomega backup program--automated, worked in the background, reliable.
i have no trouble transferring files to and from the hard drive.
but the iomega backup software works once, maybe twice, and then gives an &quot;error starting backup&quot; message.
sometimes going to the control panel and using 'repair program' works.
but more often it doesn't.
this is not what i'd call hassle-free backup.
does anyone know what might be going wrong?
i'm running zonealarm and avg as well as adaware; could there be a conflict with one of those or is the iomega backup software just problematic?
