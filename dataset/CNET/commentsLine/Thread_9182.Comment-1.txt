terabytes of nas are great for backing up lots of stand-alone pcs on the network... but what about backing up the nas?
say i'm using the mybook (with it's vast storage) for a central network data warehouse.
raid will help with redundancy inside the mybook box, so if one drive fails, the other will have a copy of the data.
but what happens if the whole wd mybook unit burns in a fire?
i need another unit just like it somewhere else.
but terabytes of data don't transfer quickly on a 100mb network.
do you have a suggestion for how to maintain a replica of this huge drive somewhere else?
