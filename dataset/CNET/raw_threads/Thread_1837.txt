Find the maximum size the integrated graphics of your Dell supports. Should be in the specs. If that maximum is the same or bigger than the native size of that monitor, it's OK. If it's less, don't do it.

I just bought a AOC 1080p monitor and it works even at 640x480. Of course I personally never done any business with Dell (all my computers are home built).
