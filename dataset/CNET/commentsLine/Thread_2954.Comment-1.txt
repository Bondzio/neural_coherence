i have been facing few problems in finding enclosure.
i have bought 3 different type of enclosure till date and all of them are off in dimension by few millimeters and hence not working.
it is for 2.5&quot; sata internal harddrive 80gb from my 1 year old hp laptop.
any recommendations will be surely appreciated.
thanks harvijay
