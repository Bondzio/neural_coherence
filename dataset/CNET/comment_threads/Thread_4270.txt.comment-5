This is the latest list of camera's that Apple have tested with iMovie 08 This is the list Hope this helps Apple tech support claim that iMovie 08 will NOT accept video & Audio up the USB ports.
However, on Friday I was using a Sony HD based camera and imported video from it into iMovie 08. iMovie could NOT see the camera when the camera icon in iMovie was pressed.
It could only see the built in iSight camera.
Importing ok up the USB port but no live recording with that camera.
It did NOT have a Firewire port, by any name, on the Camera.
Also on some Hard Drive camera's, if there is SD as well as HD content on the drive, the SD content has to be erased before iMovie will import the HD content.
