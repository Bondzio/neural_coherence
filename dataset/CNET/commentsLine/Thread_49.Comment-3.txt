my machine is a wtx (  ) but the link above hinted wtxs are backwards compatible with atxs, so thought this means standard atx psu would work... i just came across some blogs/threads which hint dell and hp alter the wiring on the 24 pin atx of their proprietary psus to make standard ones incompatible...
