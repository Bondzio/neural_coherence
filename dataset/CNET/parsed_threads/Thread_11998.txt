<s> Hello all Often when I try & safely remove a USB Mass Storage Device a Problem message appears to advise it's still in use suggesting, &quot;I close any programs or windows that might be using the device, and then try again later&quot;. </s>
<s> Any/ all programs are closed & it doesn't matter how long I wait, it cannot be removed safely. </s>
<s> I've had a look at Task Manager Processes and Services for anything obvious but I don't really know what I'm looking at so leave those alone. </s>
<s> I run CCleaner to no avail & end up shutting down my machine as a last resort. </s>
<s> My machine is a HP Compaq Presario A900 Notebook PC & OS is 32-bit Vista Home Premium SP2. </s>
<s> Any ideas guys? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Your anti-virus or any other protection scheme maybe active in scanning unattended any new files or media sources. </s>
<s> Also, while connected, if you networked, its a storage area that may not readily return until unhooked. </s>
<s> When this happens to me, I just shutdown the system rather than gamble the flash drive become corrupted because I removed it during that time. </s>
<s> Also, check your firewall for any doubtful activity. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Cheers, thanks Willy. </s>
<s> I'm glad I'm not the only one. </s>
<s> Rip it right out of the port. </s>
<s> Simple as that. </s>
<s> I do it all the time and nothing gets screwed up. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I used to &quot;just remove the device&quot; until my computer wouldn't shut down because the device &quot;was still running&quot;. </s>
<s> I ended up plugging the portable drive back in, powering down the computer and unplugging device, then rebooting as suggested above. </s>
<s> I agree that something may be accessing that drive, but if you're waiting that long, that isn't the problem. </s>
<s> I wouldn't bother with clicking the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon. </s>
<s> I haven't since ME. </s>
<s> I only did that because the computer didn't like to reboot with that drive in it all of the time. </s>
<s> After the drive stops blinking, I wait till the count of 10, then remove it. </s>
<s> Unless I'm still going to use it. </s>
<s> No issues there. </s>
<s> I even do that on my friend's computer (an HP), she does the same. </s>
<s> If you're having a shut down or reboot issue with it I'd reformat it. </s>
<s> Which is good to do every few months. </s>
<s> This doesn't apply to PNY (I don't use them since they screwed me), nor the &quot;Cruiser&quot; line of drives from San Disc, that is one's which have their own program in them. </s>
<s> They could be writing to the drive as well. </s>
<s> I'd opt for reformatting the drive. </s>
<s> I'm sure you've tried using other drives (size & model) & have the same problem. </s>
<s> Don't forget to defrag your computer, & no, you don't have to defrag the flash memory card. </s>
<s> installi dispositivo, scansione controlla percorso. </s>

<s> If you are using iTunes, then look out for a couple of processes that will continue hooking your USB drive - even after you've shut down iTunes itself. </s>
<s> If you find iTunesHelper.exe in your Task Manager, Processes list, then try shutting it down (click on iTunesHelper, and End Process). </s>
