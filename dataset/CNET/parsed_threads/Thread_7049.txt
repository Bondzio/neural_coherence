<s> qnap recently released their hd station (video for reference http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu59r_MrVag&noredirect=1 ) and more info http://www.qnap.com/hdstation/us/ Is this a viable option to skip your media player? </s>
<s> I think its really cool how you can have a file share/backup/ BT dl and more all in one with the QNAP. </s>
<s> Anyone have experience on the product? </s>
<s> any feedback is greatly appreciated </s>
<s> Unless you are comfortable with encoding your content for this player, pass. </s>
