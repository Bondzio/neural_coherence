as a public and corporate it professional, i have had the privilege of working with and on most everything... when i break down my experience (with pc's) to basics, it comes back to maintenance & support.
if the computer is designed with the long-term customer support / retention built in, then the brand will build a loyalty base.
there are always exceptions, when people are given a pc or have to purchase the most cost effective at the time, and they have a good experience, they may become loyal to that brand.
i have had the best experience with ibm thinkpads, and aptiva's which are now product lines of lenovo, but the same great minds that built them before are now joined with the great minds of lenovo, and the synergy that the team has acheived is apparent in the newest product line models.
i acquired a new z61 model in the last 6 months, and it is the best ever...(it's my 6th).
i have either owned or been assigned a thinkpad computer since they came out with them in the early 90's.
otherwise, hp is really high on my list as a very close 2nd mostly for the same reasons.
ps i do own a self-built generic server running win 2008 server and it is like a child; you never fall out of love with it...
