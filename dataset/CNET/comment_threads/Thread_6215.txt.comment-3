Remove your old drive and install the new one and install your OS.
After you've done all your updates and you're satisfied with your new drive, power down your computer and plug your old drive back in, making sure to have both drives' jumpers set properly, new drive=master, old drive=slave.
Boot your computer, you should be able to access both drives now.
Caution, if you suspect your old drive may be failing, I wouldn't store any data there and always make backups in removable storage.
Cheers
