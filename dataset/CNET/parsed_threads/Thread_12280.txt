<s> I installed a Rocketfish 900w (RF-900WPS) into my HP p6620f desktop for a new graphics card I was planning on getting. </s>
<s> I did a one for one swap. </s>
<s> The motherboard had a 24-pin slot so I used all 24 (old PSU only had 20). </s>
<s> I put in the 4-pin cpu connector on the MB too. </s>
<s> I put an 8-pin PCI-e connector in the PSU for when the card comes tomorrow. </s>
<s> I also put 2 connectors into the HDD/SATA ports that had the molex adapters. </s>
<s> I plugged one into the hard drive and one into the CD Drive. </s>
<s> I turn on the computer and the hard drive works fine. </s>
<s> However, there is now a protected Q: drive that says it is loaded with Microsoft Office Click-to-run 2010 and is 0 bytes in the properties summary. </s>
<s> There is no CD Drive now even though the drive physically opens and closes, and the HDD light flickers when I put in a CD. </s>
<s> The problem is, no optical drives can be found on my computer, and I have this pesky Q: drive that isn't real. </s>
<s> I'm guesing you used the Molex connecter with some adapter as the old one was. </s>
<s> If so, then use it is connected or swap to yet another one test out on the PC. </s>
<s> It should work, there shouldn't any conflicts that I know of, unless that adapter is diferemnt from what intended. </s>
<s> Nowe the connectors that ypu used to the mtrbd. </s>
<s> should all done right, in other words no extra one until the video is instaklled. </s>
<s> I suggest you unplu azny unneeded ones even if a place is present for its use. </s>
<s> That way you eliminate the use of any until needed or presents a problem, just plug one in att ime. </s>
<s> I aslso refrain from any guesses here, be sure what is required at each plug-in.Teh CD drive shouldn't have jumpedfrom a Q one as the change was only a PSU as I understand it. </s>
<s> Check out that out and report back. </s>
