I went with 6gb option which was the lowest offered and is 6 sticks. It seems sufficient as Currently I am running a single core processor with 4GB of memory. They offer upgrades to 8gb and 12 gb. The 12GB upgrade costs $300, and replaces the 6 1BG sticks with 2GB sticks. Since later expansion will require replacing sticks in the future if, how likely is it that I will need that much memory in the next 3 or so years? I realize that this is a bit of speculation which depends on my usage and what happens in the future applications. I use my system for drafting, rendering, photo work, and a very small amount of home video editing. So, basically, if you are not into gaming, is 6GB a good choice, or will it choke the capability of my machine? I would appreciate you comments and suggestions. Thanks, Allen PS This is my first post. I expect this is a frequent question, and I do not mean to be repetitive. If there is a relevant thread, perhaps you could point me to it. Thanks again.

It links to a specification page that says it comes with 64 bits Vista Home Premium. So it can make use of all 6 Gb. That's nice. For your usage, I'd say that 6 Gb is more than enough. Kees

Dell does populate all 6 slots with 1GB sticks which is a real bummer - if I order now with 6GB and see that my heavy home video editing could use the full 12GB, then I would have to replace ALL 6 1GB DIMMs. So that is a waste of the initial investment for me. My question: if I'm running Corel VideoStudio ProX2, editing a large movie (45+ minutes), have multiple photoshop image files open, etc., could this system take advantage of the full 12GB of RAM? A previous poster recommended ordering with 6GB and monitoring usage, but I don't want to waste the initial investment by throwing all those away if I see 6GB is not enough.
