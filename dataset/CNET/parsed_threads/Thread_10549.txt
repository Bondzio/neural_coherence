<s> Hi everyone, It is the first time I'm building a computer and I would like to be sure thatt this setup is problem-free and relatively adequate for my use. </s>
<s> I'm mostly doing heavy Photoshop work with some Premiere work, and I'm gaming only occasionnally. </s>
<s> - i7 3770K - ASRock Fatal1ty Z77 Performance - Ventirad Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - Kit Dual Channel DDR3 Kingston HyperX XMP Blu Red, 2 x 4 Go, PC3-12800, CAS 9 - ASUS GeForce GTX 660 Ti Direct CU II, 2 Go - SSD SanDisk Ultra Plus, 128 Go, SATA III - Seagate Barracuda, 2 To - Xigmatek Midgard II case - PSU Be Quiet Pure Power L8, 630W Is there anything unneccessary or is there a bottleneck somewhere? </s>
<s> More importantly, is there a serious compatibility problem? </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>
<s> http://www.bequiet.com/en/powersupply/250 has me checking the dual rail +12V but at 30A each and looking at the power tests I think it's OK. </s>
<s> I see you going for the somewhat expert OS install on SSDD so let's hope you have support handy for that. </s>

<s> Unless your planning on over clocking look at the 3770.......sans &quot;k&quot;. </s>
<s> Thank you for your good responses! </s>
<s> Maybe I'm indeed going to overclock it so it seems the K is fine. </s>
<s> My concern is more about the GPU, isn't that a little over the board as I don't think I'll be playing a lot of heavy games? </s>
<s> Is the 660 or the HD7870 (or even slightly lower) still acceptable? </s>
<s> This is where you head over to Tom's...do some reading...let your wallet be your guide. </s>

<s> Start with none. </s>
<s> The 3770 comes with an Igp......test it. </s>
<s> If that's acceptable to you......good to go. </s>
<s> If not......move up the gpu ladder. </s>
