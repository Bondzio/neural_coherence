lots of options...might just make it easy and get a basic dell....just make sure you have enough ram...at least 512mbs (1 gb if you get oboard video), enough disk space...100 gbs, a 19' monitor, and a cd-dvd reader writer....you could get the el cheapo cd-rom drive from dell and get a cd-dvd writer of your choice from newegg or elsewhere.
as far as the software is concerned...unless you absolutely positively need the real deal, just use openoffice 2.0. regards, vapcmd
