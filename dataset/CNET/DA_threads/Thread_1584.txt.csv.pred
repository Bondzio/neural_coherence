1.1.1	my harddrive's been working fine up until now.	St
1.1.2	when i plug it in, it beeps a few times, it doesn't show up in My Computer, but the computer still recognizes that there is something in the USB port.	St
1.1.3	Does anyone know what's wrong and how to fix this?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I have this very same issue.	St
1.3.2	My drive gives 3 beeps at a time for 4 cycles then stops.	St
1.3.3	The power light stays on and even though DM sees it, it doesn't appear visible anywhere else on my notebook.	St
1.3.4	A tech at WD told me it may need replacing, but with over 200GB of music data that will undoubtedly take a monumental effort to reaquire and organize again, I need an alternative desparately!	St
1.4.1	I recently purchased several WD passport external drives for my kids to put their games on the drives.	St
1.4.2	I realized that the drives worked just fine on the laptops, but when plugged into the desktop they would not even get recognized by the program.	St
1.4.3	I discovered that the USB version on the laptops is 2.0 and that the desktop version was 1.0, the version of USB drives on the WD passport are 2.0. at the point WD will not work on the USB 1.0 versions and as far as I know there is no way to change the version of the software on the WD passports, if you find out anything else let me know.
