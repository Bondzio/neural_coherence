I am using it to temporarily replace our main office copier/fax machine until its repaired. Initially I could not send or receive faxes, but then I was instructed to turn off Error Correcting Mode (ECM) and turn off v.3.4. After I did this I was able to receive faxes and I was able to send a test fax to epson which they received, but when I try to fax to other numbers it does not go through. Any ideas as to why this might happen?

You may find folk that DEMAND AN ANSWER but the simple truth is &quot;it does not always work.&quot; Bob

Like http://www.popfax.com/ for example - those are great guys. They just give you everything you need about faxes and they have really low prices and a free trial period, so... you can just try it.
