<s> Well, I'm back looking for more help. </s>
<s> My original problem is detailed in the thread referenced here - http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=110288&messageID=1253394 After finally getting the system working right, my daughter used the drive as a CD-ROM for several days and everything seemed fine. </s>
<s> Then, she tried to burn a CD to play on her CD player. </s>
<s> Using Nero, the process seemed to go well. </s>
<s> However, when she tried to play the CD on her CD player, it would not work. </s>
<s> I told her that she probably didn't finalize the disk and to do so or just burn another one and be sure that finalize is selected. </s>
<s> Instead of doing that, she tried to burn with Windows Media Player. </s>
<s> The PC got hung up and when she rebooted, the problem of the missing drive returned! </s>
<s> I've tried deleting the upperfilters and lowerfilters in the registry. </s>
<s> No effect. </s>
<s> The drive does show in BIOS, but not in My Computer, Windows Explorer, etc. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> By the way, also can't boot into safe mode. </s>
<s> I've looked at the forums a little and this too seems to be associated with Nero software. </s>
<s> Is it possible that I should delete all Nero software and use something else? </s>
<s> Since the drive shows in bios, go to Device Manager check the status there. </s>
<s> If it shows there, uninstall the drive, reboot and let Windows reinstall. </s>
<s> I've had similar experience with a micro advantage cdrw drive. </s>
<s> I had to install about six times, but finally got it. </s>
<s> It's been working for two years now without problems. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> Neglected to mention that it does not show up in the Device Manager either. </s>
<s> BIOS is the only place that there is any evidence of a drive. </s>
<s> I would go back to the beginning to retrace the steps taken, including Bob's post of deleting filters from the registry. </s>
<s> Also double check or reset the jumper settings. </s>
<s> If it were me, I would try the cable select setting. </s>
<s> It can't hurt anything. </s>
<s> If all fails, I suspect the drive is bad. </s>
<s> Install it in another machine to see how it reacts. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
