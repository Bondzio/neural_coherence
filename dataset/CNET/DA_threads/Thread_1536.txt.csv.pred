1.1.1	Lately my home-built computer has been making a strange popping sound after it is turned off .	St
1.1.2	Specifically , the computer 's hard drives stop spinning , etc .	St
1.1.3	and only the fans are running , which it typically does for about 10-seconds .	St
1.1.4	Once the fans stop running the computer makes a popping sound which is heard through the speakers , while the power light on the computer 's front panel briefly glows at the same time .	St
1.1.5	The popping sound continues with a brief delay between each .	St
1.1.6	The popping sound also diminishes in volume as does the brightness of the power light .	St
1.1.7	The continually diminishing popping sounds ( and light ) continues for about 10-seconds .	St
1.1.8	I have noticed absolutely no other odd behaviour by my computer , including any other strange noises .	St
1.1.9	Regarding the computer itself : home-built with XP Pro ( all current updates ) , 1GB Corsar RAM , 2 Western Digital hard drives , ATI All-in-Wonder video card , Antec case and 450-Watt power supply , Asus motherboard and Pentium 4 2.4GHz chip over-clocked 5 % through a BIOS setting .	St
1.1.10	I suspect the issue is the power supply as the sound only occurs after everything else has shut down .	St
1.1.11	Any thoughts will be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	& quot ; Once the fans stop running the computer makes a popping sound which is heard through the speakers & quot ; This annoyance is not just your PC .	St
1.2.2	I 've seen and heard this on dozens of machines .	St
1.2.3	Sadly it 's not a defect but a sign of poor design of the audio system on that board ( mother or whichever . )	St
1.2.4	I have fixed it in the past by disabling the onboard sound and using ( my choice of ) Creative Labs sound cards .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	You are correct that I use the on-board audio and not a separate audio card .	St
1.3.2	Is it common for a problem such as this to crop up after three years of use ; out of the blue , so to speak ?	Ques
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	R. Proffitt , moderator extraordinaire , thank you .	Polite
1.5.2	I was going to try swapping for another power supply , but I think I will try buying a sound card and installing it .	St
1.5.3	Hopefully you are very much right and this will solve matters .	St
1.5.4	Thanks for the advice !	St
1.6.1	My 10 year old home built recently developed the same issue , but with a couple different twists .	St
1.6.2	Since I did n't see a post from forkboy whether the sound card solution worked , I 'm reposting the issue .	St
1.6.3	Like forkboy , the popping noise begins after everything else has shut down and gradually diminishes and stops after a half minute or so .	St
1.6.4	Now however , the noise can begin a random even several hours after shut down and it is continual .	St
1.6.5	I have to shut down power to the computer for it to stop .	St
1.6.6	When I opened the case , I noticed the 4 fans inside ( 2 case fans , power supply , and cpu ) would jerk slightly along with the popping noise .	St
1.6.7	Then my plan was to systematically disconnect peripherals to see if any were the cause of the issue .	St
1.6.8	The first cord disconnected was the keyboard , and the popping stopped .	St
1.6.9	I plug it back in , and it started again .	St
1.6.10	Is it possible the keyboard is causing the problem ?	Ques
1.6.11	Granted it 's an ancient PS/2 keyboard , so upgrading would n't be a bad thing .	St
1.7.1	Are you in a standard outlet , UPS or using some surge protector ?	Ques
1.7.2	As well , is this coming through your speakers and is their power applied to them with the PC off ?	Ques
1.7.3	It sounds like the PS is responding to some transient and wanting to start .	St
1.7.4	This could have internal or external causes .	St
1.7.5	I 'd make sure the speaker system is turned off and see if you can tell if the fans still jerk .	St
1.7.6	Work with the AC outlet configuration if you can as well .	St
1.7.7	I also have to wonder about stored voltages in the PC 's capacitors that are n't bleeding off properly .	St
1.7.8	Sounds like a good one .	Polite
1.8.1	But after too many cures over the years I continue to use the card since to replace the motherboard for this fault is more expensive .	St
1.8.2	Bob	St
1.9.1	It 's all plugged into a Belkin surge protector , which is connected to a standard outlet .	St
1.9.2	The speakers are not self-powered , but connected to the case via RCA jack .	St
1.9.3	If I disconnect the speakers , the fans still jerk , I just do n't hear the popping .	St
1.10.1	I hooked up a USB keyboard and the noise and fan jerk were still there , though it seemed to lessen in duration .	St
1.10.2	Oddly , like the PS/2 keyboard , the noise stopped if I diconnected the keyboard .	St
1.10.3	No other USB connection seems to affect the noise .	St
