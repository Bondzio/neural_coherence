Well, OK, if you have a reasonably high-powered system and want quiet, air cooling might not cut it. Water works well there. Plan on spending about $300 in parts to do it right. See http://www.dangerden.com and some of the better water cooling forums like http://forums.overclockers.com.au/forumdisplay.php?f=24 if you're serious.

The water cooling did cost $300 and required some case moding but it is absolutely silent. It does require maintenance, adding coolant semiannually. I can hear my CD, DVD, and HDD spinning. The water cooled system is quieter than my laptop, Dell Latitude D600. Yes, the system has been OC'd and it was amazing what I could do with it! I've got 2 AMD 64 systems (3000 + 3400) running with the retail package fans installed on the CPU and 120mm case fans. Yes, they are hot but not as hot as those 32 bit AMD 2600. They are very quiet. Save your money and spend it on other hardware.

I have seen a couple which are older models and overclocked to the max, which get a bit war! but if you are running at standard spped it is absolutely unnesessary

Of all my buddies with super fast systems only two of them use the water cooled sulutions and they both run overclocked Intel P-4's. My AMD 64 FX is just as fast and I have no problems with cooling it. Can't wait to get my new AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor.
