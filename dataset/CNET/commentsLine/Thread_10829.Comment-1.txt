hi guys, i have recently gotten a lenovo ideapad s206, as i was looking for a cheap, lightweight laptop.
however, it seems to have problems with windows - several times when i've put the machine into sleep mode, windows won't restart afterwards, and i've had a few blue screen crashes in the last few days as well.
does anyone know if these machines are prone to crashing a lot?
or might the problem be due to something else?
i've tried doing a system restore, but it won't let me - i keep getting error messages.
any tips gratefully received!
thanks.
