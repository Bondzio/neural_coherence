After reformatting my hard drive and reinstalling my OS which I have done time and time again. My Motherboard just beeps and dose not display anything on screen. Any Ideas? Motherboard is a ECS Elitegroup C51GM-M with an AMD 64 3800+ x2.

It's a long beep about 1 sec. and 2 secs between beeps. only seems to happen when a hard drive is pluged in. once I unpluge the HD I can load the BIOS. dose this to all hard drives I try.
