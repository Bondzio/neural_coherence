I print a confiuration page from the printer it's self, and it works. I go to print a Windows test page and The printer gives me a flashing red light. It seems to me to be a callibration issue or something wrong with the media or media settings but I'm out of ideas on how to figure out exactly the problem. I run windows xp Pro SP3. I've tested it on multiple computers and I always get the same thing. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Billy

The Zebra is probably 40-col. printing and normal PC output is 80-col or more. So, if you use the std. windoze test pattern, that's not going to work. Generate a dummy file, of small size and dump that instead, if possible. example: 1 22 333 4444 55555 end of test Just is the final use of the Zebra intended for? Install the app. you want it to use and then configure that as well. This is where it may start to work right provided it knows the configurations of both PC and printer match to accept each other. tada -----Willy

I can get it to print a windows test page (it's just a picture of the windows logo) After I send the print job and it errors, I can restore the defaults. It runs through and calibrates to the label size and prints what ever print job was in Que. Even if it's multiple print jobs (either the windows or the intended application.) However, the whole process repeats it's self after that.

That suggests the Zebra is somehow misconfigured or its bad. I checked the manual, after some time and it offers nothing to resolve this other that to check the physical h/w(platen, etc.) or use the command lingo, as in ^SC, if I recall. the error is in the Zebra physically or the setup. While you have tried USB connection, try the parallel port if available, unless of course ONLY USB is present at the printer. If you swap to various USB ports, that will cause an issue as quenes get hosed unti returned to proper last connection of that request. The manual also refers to the media being(paper), be sure its routed correctly and refers to same media. If I remember right, the Zebra post is a repeat of a past post. If this is so, then maybe its best to query Zebra for support. If in fact there is something wrong it will diagnosed and maybe covered under warranty. If you have access to another Zebra printer, copy those settings as reference. It shouldn't be taking any issue, because you say it prints a windoze test(logo) but the typical windoze test is more than a logo, far more. Because it stops and errors and doesn't finish the job, it should try again when cleared, maybe that's an area to review. If I had this setup in frt. of me, it makes more sense to try this or that. The options should be few and it works or doesn't. tada -----Willy
