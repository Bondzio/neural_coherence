i currently have an asus amd a8n-e motherboard that only supports ddr ram.
i have 2gb of 400 mhz patriot ddr ram.
if i decide to switch to intel's new core 2 duo processors and, accordingly, replace my motherboard to an intel-compatible one, would i need to buy new ddr2 ram for the new motherboard?
or can i use my ddr ram in the ddr2-standard motherboard?
it just seems like a waste of a lot of good, fast ram.
thank you.
