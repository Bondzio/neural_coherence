Everything went fine with this, but when Windows boots up my mouse does not work. I have tried plugging in an external mouse, but this does not seem to work either. When you first boot up the computer you can got into a program called &quot;Access IBM&quot; (basically a pre-installed computer diagnostic program). In this program that mouse works fine, however as soon as Windows boots up the mouse does not respond to anything Can anyone please help??

I'm well familiar with IBM laptops (I've had 5) and the restoral partition. But I've never heard of your problem. You might go to the IBM site http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/product.do?template=%2Fproductselection%2Flandingpages%2FhotNewsLandingPage.vm&sitestyle=lenovo&validate=false and input the laptop specs. Look for updated drivers.

The mouse works and I go into BIOS and it shows the mouse as being disabled. Weird situation... Thanks so much for trying to help!

It's much stranger that another (non-Windows program) sees it, despite the BIOS-settings. Something is wrong here. Kees
