i'll tell why in a moment.
the hannsg hh-191dpb contrast ratio pulls it ahead of the others.
dhcp helps too.
for me this model is a no sale since these are not the current technology of wide screen.
because of my work i must get the new displays that you see today or my software efforts would be hampered by using the older displays.
i'm sure you have a reason for this choice.
