You'll have to set aside the fears and get it done then see where things stand.
For me the clone job is the easy path.
Just one thing I'll like to add.
DO NOT BOOT YOUR MACHINE AFTER THE CLONE JOB.
Just slide the clone into it's new home position and don't have the old hard disk attached to see if it worked.
You don't want any chance that booting your old OS will mark the clone as non-boot and you don't want to chance corrupting of what may be your only copy of your files.
Which brings up a point.
Are you ready for it to all vanish?
