<s> I want to build a pentium system on a budget of about $2000. </s>
<s> The uses will be heavy microsoft office functions, possibility of engineering CAD applications in near future, and moderate gaming. </s>
<s> I would also like something failry media capable. </s>
<s> No need to include OS or office in this budget but I would like a decent set of 5.1 speakers as well as a monitor(19inLCD?). </s>
<s> What are my best hardware options here. </s>
<s> I'm mainly curious about what CPU, motherboard, video card, and RAM to use. </s>
<s> Also any speacial comments on good tv tuner, monitor, and speakers would be helpful. </s>
<s> Feedback would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I would go with a pentium 4 640 (atleast) if u are sure you want a Pentium for the mobo, I can't help really, I only know about athlon mobos for the videocard, I would go with one of the Nividia 6000 series cards....probly a 6800 GT (either an XFX, Leadtek or eVGA) and I would go with 1 GB of RAM </s>
<s> there are a totally different family of video cards for that purpose. </s>
<s> I have no idea how they perform for gaming. </s>
<s> It would seem that the new Dual CPU Intel with hyperthreading also would be a good plus for CAD, but with the video card and CPU, not much money left. </s>
