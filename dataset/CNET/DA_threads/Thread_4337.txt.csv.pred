1.1.1	Hey , I 'm planning a Christmas Upgrade for my computer this year , in preparation for Windows Vista in February .	St
1.1.2	So far I 've had a processor reccommended to me - the Intel Pentium D 945 - would you agree that 's pretty & quot ; high end & quot ; , or am I setting my standards too low ?	Ques
1.1.3	Also , I 've pretty much extended my current ( old ! )	St
1.1.4	motherboard as far as it can go - so I need a new one to use that processor .	St
1.1.5	I have 3 questions about that ... 1 .	St
1.1.6	Do most motherboards come with RAM , or will I need to order some ?	Ques
1.1.7	2 .	St
1.1.8	Will it be possible to plug my existing RAM sticks in ( 2x 512MB DDR PC2700 sticks ) into a new motherboard , or do I need to stick it on eBay and start fresh ?	Ques
1.1.9	3 .	St
1.1.10	How much RAM do you reccommend to get the best out of that processor ?	Ques
1.1.11	Will 1GB be enough ?	Ques
1.1.12	Also , if anybody can reccommend a decent and cheap motherboard I 'd really appreciate it .	St
1.1.13	Apologies for the long post , but I do n't know who else to ask !	St
1.1.14	Many thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Since you wrote that you have PC2700 RAM , I 'm guessing that your current motherboard is a socket 478 Intel board .	St
1.2.2	Too old for today 's CPU 's .	St
1.2.3	You need to start anew .	St
1.2.4	Try to get a ''Core 2 Duo '' CPU .	St
1.2.5	New : motherboard CPU DDR2 memory PSU Likely needed new : case hard disk DVD burner sound card 1. no , most do n't come with RAM 2. no , a desirable new motherboard will take DDR2 memory .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	1GB is a good place to start with Vista Motherboard and other hardware recommendations come when you tell us how you want to use your comouter .	St
1.3.1	You 'll also need a new PCI Express X16 ( not PCI or AGP ) video card if the motherboard does n't have integeated video .	St
1.4.1	I have an MSI mobo at the moment - Last time I got my computer upgraded I ended up with an AMD processor .	St
1.4.2	Thanks for the advice regarding which RAM I should be looking for , that will be helpful .	St
1.4.3	The reason I chose a Pentium D is because I 'm on a fairly tight budget , and I 've heard that not many programs use the full power of a ''Core 2 Duo '' processor yet .	St
1.4.4	I 'm planning to get a new case anyway , so that 's not a problem - but why would I need a new DVD burner , hard disk and sound card ?	Ques
1.4.5	I think mine should be fine with most new motherboards , but I may be wrong .	St
1.4.6	Finally - the PC is used for all sorts of things , so it 's hard to say .	St
1.4.7	Sometimes it 's a home desktop , sometimes I use it for designing , sometimes it 's used for playing some pretty hardware-intensive games ( Such as The Sims 2 ) .	St
1.4.8	Thanks for your response .	St
1.5.1	Gaming is usually the most hardware intensive activity for the general use computer , and today it requires a decent CPU , at least 1GB RAM , and a mid-level to high-end video card .	St
1.5.2	Of course , all this depends on your budget .	St
1.5.3	I was just guessing about the DVD burner , sound card , hard disk , and other components because of the type of RAM you stated ( older RAM type means older components ) .	St
1.5.4	If you have good components , then by all means add them to your new machine .	St
1.5.5	If you tell us what you want to keep ( kbd , mouse , monitor speakers , HD , DVD burner , sound card , etc . )	St
1.5.6	and then give us a budget for the rest of your machine , then we can suggest some builds .	St
1.6.1	All I wanted was a CPU , a case and a motherboard , but it 's becoming clear that 's not realistic - so let 's make that a CPU , motherboard , a decent amount of RAM , a case and ( only if I NEED one ) a more recent GPU .	St
1.6.2	Here 's some of the stuff I 've got at the moment - bear with me , though , because I did n't install it and do n't know much about it .	St
1.6.3	- Two HDs - A fairly recent DVD burner - A Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS sound card - An nVIDIA 6800 LE GPU ( AGP , not PCI ) - Obvious stuff such as mouse and keyboard ( not USB ) Ideally , my budget is only 300 ... that 's not a lot , I know .	St
1.6.4	I hope my PSU and fan ( both fairly new ) can be put in a new case , otherwise I might as well not bother with this upgrade !	St
1.6.5	My Dad 's paying , but I suppose he could be swayed slightly as I 'm giving him my old RAM and Processor to speed up his machine - we both had the same but I decided I needed more speed about a year ago .	St
1.6.6	Call it a part exchange , I suppose !	St
1.6.7	Again , 'scuse the long post .	St
1.6.8	Many thanks .	Polite
1.7.1	Alright , here 's what I just got last week : - ASUS P5B Socket T ( LGA 775 ) Intel P965 Express ATX Intel Motherboard - SAPPHIRE 100106L Radeon X850XT 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 Video Card - Intel Core 2 Duo E6400 Conroe 2.13GHz LGA 775 Processor Model BX80557E6400 - Patriot 2GB ( 2 x 1GB ) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 667 ( PC2 5300 ) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Model PDC22G5300LLK And I spent $ 691.89 on all this from Newegg.com .	St
1.7.2	I suspect these prices will drop as the Core 2 Duo 's become more popular , and AMD comes out with their new Quad-Core processors around Christmas time .	St
1.7.3	If you go to anandtech.com , they will show you the trends of hardware prices and have very good reviews on hardware ( it 's where I did all my research for my Mobo ) .	St
1.7.4	Newegg is typically the best place to get them , but there are other great deals out there .	St
1.7.5	Also , tomshardware.com is a good place to compare CPU speed using benchmarks that are most useful to you ( For example , AMD X2 +4400 processors are faster than the e6400 at some things like gaming , but not multitasking and dvd burning , which is what i wanted ) .	St
1.7.6	My new setup runs like a dream , and on a scale of 1-10 , my computer would now probably be about a 7 .	St
1.7.7	I used my existing Case , CD drives , Floppy , and Power Supply .	St
1.7.8	I ended up needing to get a new power supply for $ 70 , because mine was 400w and the minimum requirements for my new hardware was 400w , so I upgraded to 600w because the power was acting funky .	St
1.7.9	I suspect if you wanted to go lower in RAM ( 2GB is the most you 'll ever need , so 1GB would probably suffice ) , and also go for the Core 2 6300 which is almost just as good as the 6400 but for 50 bucks cheaper , and they also make decent PCI-e graphics cards for only $ 70 , this would all save you about $ 150 from what I paid , not to mention the drop in prices that should occur in 3 months .	St
1.7.10	I would suggest keeping your old case , HDD , and dvd burner , as they will be compatible even if you have IDE drives .	Sug
1.7.11	You can upgrade to SATA later , as they perform much better .	St
1.7.12	So I spent about $ 750 getting all this stuff , which is 397GBP , but I did manage to sell my old mobo , processor , RAM , and extra PCI cards on eBay for $ 300 , so it came to around $ 450 for my upgrade .	St
1.8.1	The new board more likely to have agp8X slot and I have learned it is not backward compatible .	St
1.8.2	So the old video board might not be compatible .	St
1.9.1	I 've worked out a way to stretch my budget a lot , and I 've found a load of stuff that I think should work together .	St
1.9.2	How does this sound , and will it all work ?	Ques
1.9.3	Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 : http : //www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp ? ID=23931 1GB RAM : http : //www.crucial.com/uk/store/partspecs.asp ? imodule=CT12864AA53E nVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT : http : //www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp ?

ID=24021 Antec NSK 3300 case : http : //www.xcase.co.uk/acatalog/Antec_NSK_3300.html Note that I picked 1GB RAM so that I can always add more later if I need it - but with that processor I 'm sure I wo n't !	St
1.9.4	( Does anybody know if I 'll end up with all the cables I need ?	Ques
1.9.5	Will I be able to use ones from my existing system ?	Ques
1.9.6	Obviously that 's important ! )	St
1.9.7	Thanks for your speedy replies .	Polite
1.10.1	Video card slots : Best & gt ; PCI Express X16 & gt ; AGP8X & gt ; PCI & gt ; worst New boards should have PCI Express X16 and not AGP4X/8X .	St
1.11.1	Motherboard is incompatible with your CPU and video card .	St
1.11.2	300W PSU wo n't support your video card ( too low ) .	St
1.11.3	Motherboard should come with all the cables you need .	St
1.12.1	& quot ; Motherboard is incompatible with your CPU and video card. & quot ; Good reply , but can I ask why ?	Ques
1.12.2	What do I need to be looking for that 's different from the one I chose ?	Ques
1.12.3	I picked one from the & quot ; Socket 775 ( Intel ) & quot ; section on the Aria site , to match my processor , and presumed that was enough .	St
1.13.1	Some other chipset will also work but 965 should be a sure thing .	St
1.14.1	What 's the benefit of having the same chipset - will it cause problems if I do n't , or is it just a case of the processor being ''guaranteed '' to fit ?	Ques
1.14.2	The reason I ask is that having a 965 chipset board adds almost 60 to the price ( on Aria , at least ) .	St
1.14.3	http : //www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp ? ID=24272 ^ That 's the one I 've got my eye on at the moment , it 's got PCIe x16 , DDR2 RAM and it mentions the Core 2 Duo .	St
1.14.4	It 's also got 4 USB ports , which is something I was hoping for - my current 2 means a lot of mucking about .	St
1.14.5	Will that one be alright ?	Ques
1.14.6	It 's an Intel 945G chipset one - presuming the numbers go in order , that 's pretty close ?	Ques
1.14.7	Right ?	Ques
1.15.1	Just because a motherboard has a particular CPU socket , it does n't necessarily mean that all CPU 's of that socket type will work .	St
1.15.2	The motherboard BIOS also needs to support the particlular CPU type .	St
1.15.3	The link you posted states that the motherboard is compatible with & quot ; Intel Pentium D , Pentium 4 , Celeron D processors , Socket T ( LGA775 ) . & quot ; Hmmm ... I seen no & quot ; Core 2 Duo & quot ; in that list .	St
1.15.4	Now , you may go to the motherboard maker 's website to discover if there is a BIOS update for compatibility with C2D processors ; however , there may never be such an update for that particular board .	St
1.15.5	Bottom line : Make sure the motherboard specifically states that it is compatible with your CPU family .	St
1.15.6	Note that some motherboards are compatible with C2D , but not C2D Extreme CPU 's .	St
1.16.1	That 's the one I almost got , but it had problems I did n't like .	St
1.16.2	Look at the layout , the PCI-e card is way close to the large Power supply cable you 'll be running , and that heatsink may also get in the way .	St
1.16.3	For some reason , manufacturers are being complete retards with their motherboard layout , so make sure you take that into consideration .	St
1.16.4	Otherwise , that board will work and it 's a good bang for your buck .	St
1.16.5	Listen to that Linksis guy and me , we know what we 're talking about .	St
1.16.6	Ignore that other guy , he has no idea what he 's talking about .	St
1.16.7	All Socket 775 boards require PCI-e , AGP sucks .	St
1.16.8	But yea , also be careful because not all Socket 775 boards support Core 2 Duo Processors	St
1.17.1	Thanks very much for your help so far ...	St
1.17.2	I think I 've almost got it !	St
1.17.3	If you could confirm this will all work , that 'd be excellent ... Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 : http : //www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp ?

ID=24557 Asrock motherboard : http : //www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp ? ID=24272 I 'm also thinking of this case , just because it 's the cheapest : http : //www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp ? ID=23750 Will that be alright , and can you reccomend a PSU from aria.co.uk ?	Ques
1.17.4	The nVIDIA FAQs say I need at least 400W , but that does n't help much - I never know exactly what I 'm after .	St
1.18.1	Get one that 's 600w .	St
1.18.2	Also , I hope you do realize you 're getting Micro-ATX stuff .	St
1.18.3	It will all work with each other , I 'm just pointing that out so that you know you may need a micro-ATX power supply also .	St
1.18.4	That 's one hell of a video card you got here , too .	St
1.18.5	And if you 're only getting 1GB of RAM , it might be cheaper to get 2 DIMMs ( 2x512MB Dual Channel ) .	St
1.19.1	I do realise I 'm getting microATX stuff ... the motherboard being cheaper is the main reason .	St
1.19.2	Also , I often cart my PC accross the country when I 'm visiting my Dad - so I expect that might make it slightly easier .	St
1.19.3	Why would I need 600w , Is n't that a bit OTT ?	Ques
1.19.4	Obviously you know more than me - I 'm just making sure I do n't waste money if it 's more than I need .	St
1.19.5	Re : the graphics card , that could end up being different depending on my budget .	St
1.19.6	The idea of this upgrade is to not need another one anytime soon , but I think I might end up going for an older model in the GeForce 7 series .	St
1.19.7	It all depends on how much I have to spend on the case and the PSU - do I need a microATX one for the case I just posted ?	Ques
1.20.1	Check this article for info on selecting a gaming video card : http : //www.tomshardware.com/2006/09/26/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ Compare for yourself : http : //www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html Make sure the +12V rail on the PSU has the number of amps ( A ) that the video card requires .	St
1.20.2	One 7950GT model I saw on NewEgg.com states that it needs 28A on the +12V rail .	St
1.20.3	This is in addition to the high maximum Wattage rating .	St
1.20.4	It is better to have more Wattage than to skimp .	St
1.21.1	NIL	St
