let's get rid of another issue.
power and heat.
i've found routers and dsl modems buried under books cooking away.
also we are never sure of the power so put it on some ups.
the dsl modem can be the failure point which i used to loan out my old but stable modem to sniff that out.
sorry about the person jumping into your discussion and me missing that you came back.
at this point it's something of a mystery what it is.
ok. no torrents.
then again we had that member the swore up and down no torrents.
just limewire.
ouch, bob
