<s> Friend's computer. </s>
<s> Emachines ET1331G-07W nvidia geforce 6150SE integrated windows 7 home premium 64bit amd athion II X2 250u dual-core processor 640 GB HDD 4GB DDR2 memory its hooked up to Dell monitor via VGA. </s>
<s> when computer turns on it doesn't show any of the boot up process, fans run, the keyboard and monitor lights flash green then the moniter goes yellow. </s>
<s> if you press the moniter buttons it displays a message along the lines of 'moniter in power save mode, press any key or move the mouse etc.' </s>
<s> but the mouse and keyboard are unresponsive, the mouse glows red but nothing happens. </s>
<s> i haven't found an answer in my surfing. </s>
<s> https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=The+Dead+PC gives you and introduction to troubleshooting dead PCs. </s>
<s> There is no &quot;answer&quot; to be found according to some folk. </s>
<s> I think some think they can fix this without swapping parts and for those folk, they get another PC or end up at a shop counter. </s>

<s> Thanks, i'll have to ask him if he's okay with me pulling it open. </s>
<s> quick clarification, when i turn the computer on, while the screen never does anything the power button light is lit, does that mean i can bypass the checking of the power supplys connection to the motherboard? </s>
<s> But asking to open the case means I would be returning this the next time I see them. </s>
<s> I have repaired thousands of machines over the years (my background is more embedded computing than PCs) and repair involves a lot of knowledge but the PC is simpler. </s>
<s> We don't fix a board today. </s>
<s> We swap it out. </s>

<s> I had a similar scenario a couple of years ago (quite rare) it turned out to be the Monitor, that would be the first thing, try another monitor </s>
