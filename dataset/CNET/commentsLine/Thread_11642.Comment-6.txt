i've had a few of them and was not impressed with their performance or reliability.
yes, they were purchased by seagate to help stabilize pricing.
maxtor had a bad habit of cutting prices first.
this caused the others to follow suit knowing that their products were better than maxtor's.
western digital and hitachi will benefit from this as well.
i look for hard drive prices to creep up and stay up in the next 6 mo.
and, have you noticed maxtor with sata drives?
i haven't.
good luck with your system and give us a holler anytime.
and life goes on... jack
