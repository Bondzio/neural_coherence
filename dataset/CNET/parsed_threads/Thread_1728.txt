<s> OK, I originally got the error 0x0000009C(0x0000004,0x80545FF0,0B2000000,0x00070F0F) and researched that error. </s>
<s> I changed out the ram from 1Gig to 512Megs, and it seems to run good for basic stuff like web browsing. </s>
<s> However if I try to start up a game it either crashes or gives me a bunch of color on the screen. </s>
<s> I started up both Sim City 4 and the original Neverwinter Nights. </s>
<s> The machine is has an Athlon 64, GeForce 6600GT, 200GB SATA HD, on a ASROCK motherboard. </s>
<s> Any help at this point would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?q=0x0000009C finds no single error or simple cure. </s>
<s> It's likely something you need to take back the machine's maker. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, I tried that. </s>
<s> Problem is I am the maker, and was hoping for some help before I just randomly start changing parts. </s>
<s> Also, it wasn't my ram as the problem finally came back with the new ram. </s>
<s> So if anyone else has the next best guess.....?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Sometimes you get lucky and find which driver it might be. </s>
<s> Then again the machine's parts are not listed. </s>
<s> Imagine the builder that didn't fit a big enough power supply. </s>
<s> Can you reduce the parts for awhile? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Tried that, didn't get anywhere. </s>
<s> My next move is going to be the power supply, it is older, and has a lot of things to power. </s>
