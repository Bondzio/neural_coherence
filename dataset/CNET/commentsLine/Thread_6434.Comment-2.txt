you have to use hp's latest driver offerings and if it's crashing, call it in under support.
be ready to wipe the machine and reload but stick with it.
some get a new motherboard or such until it works.
on the game forums, others have hacked the nvidia drivers to let you use them on laptops.
but i offer only this information and nothing more.
-&gt; to me, this is a warranty issue and possible bad hardware.
