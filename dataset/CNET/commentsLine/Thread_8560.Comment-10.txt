last minute update: if you're willing to spend the money, grab a system builder copy (about $120) of vista home premium.
the media center application is one of the best out there, with built-in astc (digital) support and dvr functionality.
plus, it will support almost any tv tuner card out there.
(just be sure to grab either a 32-bit copy, or a usb-based tv card, as 64-bit oses almost never work with internal tv tuner cards.)
