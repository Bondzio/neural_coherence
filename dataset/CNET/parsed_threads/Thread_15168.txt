<s> When i switch on them the cpu fan rotates,hdd starts(i can feel them by physicaly opening the cabinet and touching them) but no display is coming on led monitor.I tried changing power supply but same problem is there. </s>
<s> But to bring in notice.They sometimes start in about 20 times trying switching again and again but it is also not sure. </s>
<s> Please any hardware expert help me to sort out this problem.Any help will be helpful thanx </s>
<s> Take a Volt meter to the CMOS battery and if it's the common CR2032 it must be over 3 Volts. </s>
<s> Next, research BAD CAPS. </s>
<s> Finally since there are no make, models here, that's also a sign of an overtaxed power supply. </s>
<s> It's a shame details are missing as it could be one of the common issues but without details, you have to check these and more. </s>

<s> See if it's the other monitors with the problem, or the computer. </s>
