Does it have a drive letter? Does dir work? Does chkdsk work? - What do you mean with &quot;open in Device Manager&quot;? What does it show? - What does Disk Management say about the disk? - What happens if you connect the hard disk to another PC? Does it behave normally or just as strange? - What happens if you connect a USB-stick or another hard disk to this PC? Does it behave normally or just as strange? - Maybe the drive letter has been marked to be hidden.
