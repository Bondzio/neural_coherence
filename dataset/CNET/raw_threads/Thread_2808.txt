Pull the jack halfway out and the first speaker goes silent and the quiet speaker starts to play. Sound quality is O.K. Obviously a dead spot there. What part do I buy to fix this problem? Not the sound card is it?

If so, the solution is to use a stereo cable. Count the number of black (or green) rings on the 1/8&quot; (Sony) ending: 1 ring = mono 2 rings = stereo Even if you have a stereo cable, it may be faulty, so try another stereo cable. Does another source, such as an iPod, CD player, Walkman, etc. work with the speakers?
