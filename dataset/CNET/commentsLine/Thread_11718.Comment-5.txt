desktop maintenance.
about once a month i delete all of the files in my recycle bin.
i use outlook express and once a month i delete all of the files in the outbox, sent items, deleted items, and drafts.
in internet explorer about once a month i delete all of the files temporary internet files, cookies, history of websites visited and inprivatae filtering data.
i don't think i have the knowledge or skills to check the cpu heat sink.
this problem is relatively new, like a month, so i doubt that could be the problem.
but, if i can't get it fixed, i take it in to a shop and tell them to check the heat sink.
