1.1.1	Thanks for coming 1stly , Guys .	St
1.1.2	Well , My HP s3714uk PC started to give me no response after I pressed power button .	St
1.1.3	The power light blinked in yellow less than 1 sec and then went off no matter how many times you pressed .	St
1.1.4	Then it randomly turned on by itself suddenly , but it would be shut down suddenly as how it turned up ... it became a time bomb in my heart ... . later on , I thought I discovered something in my old house since my cacuum cleaner was burnt when it was plugged in the socket , whicn was used by my PC as well .	St
1.1.5	hence , I tried to unplug and then plug in another socket when my PC gave me no response again .	St
1.1.6	and it indeed could be able to power on in a higher chance than in before .	St
1.1.7	But still could be shut down suddenly when i was using it .	St
1.1.8	afterwards , I moved to my current address where the electricity circuit is good definitely .	St
1.1.9	and my PC looked as if became normal .	St
1.1.10	but i was wrong because i only turned off the PC but not the socket after use .	St
1.1.11	and if you turned off the socket , then next time when you wan na turn on PC , it started to give no response as if it was not fit with the new & quot ; voltage & quot ; but it 's a little bit better than in before as it would not be shut down suddenly when i used it at least .	St
1.1.12	so , any mate could tell me what this problem of my PC is .	St
1.1.13	and how could i fix it ?	Ques
1.1.14	and do you think there is any damage on hareware components ?	Ques
1.1.15	( in fact , i runed the pre-installed hardware diagnostics tool and it said & quot ; no & quot ; ) many thanks for reading .	St
1.1.16	good luck to everyone , i am considering about buying a UPS in future , is there any cheaper one ?	Ques
1.1.17	or good brands could be recommend .	St
1.1.18	to be expert !	St
1.2.1	Contacted with US HP online support .	St
1.2.2	they recommended me to reseat the cable from power supply in pc tower to motherboard and from motherboard to cable ... . and said if the power light still does not glow fine , the problem should be on the motherboard ... .due to there are lots of minicircuits on it .	St
1.2.3	i am not an expert ... . maybe he is right .	Res
1.2.4	don you guys also think the burning of my cleaner a totally different thing ?	Ques
1.2.5	my PC works fine now in my new house just with booting problem sometimes ... maybe i should wait until monday to contact with UK online support ... ... ... .	St
1.3.1	They would likely have a bench with spare power supplies to try .	St
1.3.2	Then they move on to main boards .	St
1.3.3	Type THE DEAD PC on google and you see the same advice .	St
1.3.4	Swap out the most likely parts and reduce what 's connected .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	In most cases like yours , swapping out the PSU is the best resource to do .	St
1.4.2	Further , since you mentioned it , I would have a pro look at your electrical AC outlets .	St
1.4.3	No telling what could be happening there to include possible safety issues .	St
1.4.4	I suggest that strongly because I have found either due to a old house or improper wiring that either the new or past homeowner had made changes that compromised the electrical circuits in some fashion .	St
1.4.5	If you do n't already , use a surge protector and/or AC line conditioner if you have poor power in your region , like brown outs , etc.. Last , do n't settle for & quot ; cheap & quot ; anything you 'll know the value of cheap far too often when they fail or less desirable when they do n't do the job they 're suppose to .	St
1.4.6	A UPS offer a simple surge protection but these are mainly to power down a system in a controlled manner if lost of power NOT to be the main protection from electrical problems other than shutdown .	St
1.4.7	An ext .	St
1.4.8	surge strip and similar at AC cord connector itself an help further than singular strops , etc.. good luck tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Hi askforhelp , Here is an HP support document for your PC on troubleshooting power supply issues : http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? docname=bph06788 & tmp_task=solveCategory & lc=en & dlc=en & cc=us & lang=en & product=3876701 I hope this helps .	St
1.6.1	Looks like a power supply issue .	St
1.6.2	Try replacing it .	St
1.6.3	A UPS is helpful if the electricity in your place is unstable .	St
