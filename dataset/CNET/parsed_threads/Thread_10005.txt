<s> I have an Radeon X1650 Pro video card, there is an s-video on it, I want to know if it is in and out or just out s-video. </s>
<s> I sent an email to AMD, never an answer. </s>
<s> I have seen two different answers to this, I do not have the disk to read the manual. </s>
<s> I want to connect a video player to copy a couple of videos to CD. </s>
<s> I want to avoid buying Dazzle or other equipment if possible. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Video capture is a rare item and given so little detail I'm answering with &quot;No, it's just an ouput.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> VIVO=video in, video out the x1650 is capable of vivo but not all manufacturers implemented it. </s>
<s> you need to check the specs of your card on your manufacturer's website to see if your card has VIVO. </s>
<s> if it does, your video editting/capture app needs to be able to support the x1650 as an input device. </s>
