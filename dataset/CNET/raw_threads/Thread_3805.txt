The program has grown increasingly undependable and buggy. Do you recommend another (totally free, not 30 day demo) data backup utility? I use it for backing up data from/to external and internal HDs Thanks!

Other people use SYNCBACK from http://www.download.com/SyncBack/3000-2242_4-10413802.html or SYNCTOY from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E0FC1154-C975-4814-9649-CCE41AF06EB7&displaylang=en Both are free.
