I have a Dell Dimension 1100 desktop computer and a Panasonic Viera TV (Model TX-32lXD69A), which is LCD.
I want to connect the processor to the TV, so that I can watch movies and TV programmes streamed through my computer on my TV screen.
Could I do this by using a HDMI cable to HDB15?
See link below for details of cable.
