<s> I'm having trouble getting this card to function properly with my PC. </s>
<s> I went through the installation procedures, and when I first start up the PC, I can see everything up to the Windows loading progress bar screen. </s>
<s> But after that, everything goes black. </s>
<s> I imagine it could be some configuration problem, but I'm at a loss. </s>
<s> BTW, it's not a power supply problem, I have a 500W supply installed. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The good news is I doubt it's a hardware issue. </s>
<s> So try this. </s>
<s> Boot to SAFE MODE and change the resolution to 800x600, OK your way out and do a proper reboot. </s>

<s> Well, I tried to reboot into safe mode, but the process began to hang at the Agp440.sys service. </s>
<s> I found a MS support doc that instructed to disable this service (via windows recovery off the CD). </s>
<s> So now it just hangs on another service in the boot process. </s>
<s> When I don't try safe mode, it exhibits the same problem as before, no problems until after the Windows progress baar screen. </s>
<s> I'm at a loss as to what to do, and since I'm not that windows-savvy, I don't want to do anything irreparable. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> It will appear to hang. </s>
<s> Many people won't give it the 20 minutes I've see it take to boot. </s>
<s> My bet is still on the video resolution is incorrect so this is how I fix it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I let it go for about an hour twice, and each time it hangs on btkrnl.sys. </s>
<s> I just can't get to that logon screen... </s>
<s> And not a good one. </s>
<s> It is usually a sign of malware or spyware damage. </s>
<s> My next step is to do a XP REPAIR INSTALL (see google.) </s>
