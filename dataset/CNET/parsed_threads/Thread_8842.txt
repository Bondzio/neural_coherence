<s> Hello, I am reasonably new to networking and would very much appreciate some assistance. </s>
<s> I am trying to network my desktop pc (windows xp) to an older laptop (windows 2000). </s>
<s> I just cannot work out how to do it, if you indeed can. </s>
<s> The desktop is connected to the internet through an adsl router. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Thanks, Mark. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> By a network cable (blue one). </s>
<s> I have done simple windows xp-xp networks before with these cables so I am guessing this is what you use. </s>
<s> Thanks for reply. </s>
<s> Make sure the network name is the same. </s>
<s> That is, firewall settings, accounts, shares, etc. </s>
<s> Go get NETWORK MAGIC and you're done. </s>
<s> I tried running the setup on both machines (by making a network setup disk). </s>
<s> The laptop (windows 2000) said that the setup could only be run on windows 98, me and xp, not 2000. </s>
<s> Also what is Network Magic? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> is it impossible to network a machine running xp to another running 2000, the network setup disk was the only way I could see and you can't run it on windows 2000. please help... </s>
<s> To network as you noted without the router it will tax the owner and they will likely fail. </s>
<s> If we install the router and then use NETWORK MAGIC then the usual owners can get it working. </s>
<s> What I'm running into more and more are owners that just want it to work without having to learn about firewalls, shares and accounts. </s>
