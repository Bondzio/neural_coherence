<s> I have more than 1GB of files on my laptop that need to be backed up hopefully using a single small portable drive. </s>
<s> As the files grow USB devices seem too small and even zip disks are small and not that convenient. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> External DVD drives on USB 2.0 work well. </s>
<s> The USB 2.0 PCCARD was under 40 and the DVD recorder was under 100. </s>
<s> Seems you should go shopping? </s>
