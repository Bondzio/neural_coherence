<s> I found a 2nd hand Etherfast Cable/DSL Router and want to try and hook it up. </s>
<s> It has an ethernet cable and power supply cord. </s>
<s> I has a 4-port switch. </s>
<s> What I have is a computer with DSL, and a box/modem with the first plugin for DSL, 2nd, usb, 3rd, ethernet, and 4th power. </s>
<s> The ethernet is plugged into the back of the tower. </s>
<s> I am wondering how to hook up the Linksys(where to plug it in)and also, it doesn't have a little antenna which I though all of these did. </s>
<s> I don't see anyplace where one might have been either? </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> I have Windows Vista SP2 and can give you further info if needed. </s>
<s> I want to be able to pick up the DSL signal from my laptop;) Denise </s>
<s> when the linksys is hooked up to the modem and pc, there is no internet connection. </s>
<s> The internet &quot;light&quot; is not coming on and when I try my browser it is not connected. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me what I might try to fix this? </s>
<s> The lights are on on the router so it appears to be functioning properly. </s>
<s> I think these instructions, http://www.tech-faq.com/how-to-setup-a-linksys-router.html are correct but I can't get to the &quot;configure&quot; part where you go to the IP address online. </s>
<s> Can I configure that before I hook up the router maybe? </s>
<s> Thanks again for any help, Denise </s>
<s> Found out my Linksys router is the wrong kind. </s>
<s> Please close this thread;) ty, denise </s>
