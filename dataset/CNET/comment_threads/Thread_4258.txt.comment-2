Sorry, I forgot to include that I have an AMD X2 4400+, an EPoX nforce 4 motherboard, 1Gb of Patriot DDR400 memory, a 320GB sata II harddrive, my old 200GB ATA drive attached as a secondary drive, and Im using windows XP pro.
I have all the critical updates, etc.
for windows XP and I have installed all the drivers that came with my motherboard already.
