Hi, I'm looking to put together a mid-range to (low)high-end workstation PC for my own use and I'm trying to educate myself on what parts I should think about getting, but I am stuck on the video card. Geforce cards are way more affordable than the Quadro FX cards(I'd like to stick with Nvidia.) In a perfect world I'd like the performance of the Quadro with the price of a Geforce.... but to be honest I've never used a Quadro and wouldn't know how much of a difference it makes. Would it make more sense to buy a high end Geforce or a mid to entry range Quadro?

I use photoshop and painter as well, but I'm certain I won't have problems running those. I figure Quadros are for professionals who are making money through 3D Design, so I wouldn't need a $1,600 Quardo card, but I'm wondering if a lower end Quadro would be better for learning on than a high end Geforce.
