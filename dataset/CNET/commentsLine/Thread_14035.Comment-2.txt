strange value.
how did you arrive at that?
it seems all the ddr3 memory stick comes in 2/4gb each...and the board have 4 sockets.
did you happen to get some 3gb ram or some spares that you want to use.
the prices are so reasonable, i probably would not want to mix them.
take a look at mwave or fry's.
