preferably if you own the one-touch mini-  tried contacting seagate, but of course, they're closed on weekends & their hours'll be spotty for the holidays.
few things: i'm a little lost on how to use to &quot;sync&quot; & back-up features.
what're the main differences between them?
also, i'm getting the red 'm' icon on my toolbar.
(the maxtor isn't &quot;found&quot; on the laptop) there's no way easy to find a help area for this thing & i'm a novice to it all.
damn.
all i really wanna do is store stuff (esp.
music) from my laptop to the maxtor.
thanks in advance
