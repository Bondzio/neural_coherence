<s> hi all new here so here goes have a siemens amilo computer and the trouble is i cannot connect to a certain wireless network. </s>
<s> The router can take upto 4 laptops and this one will be the third so itis not a question of to many. </s>
<s> All the other laptops can conect to the router when the pass key is put in but this computer will not. </s>
<s> This computer will connect to other networks but not the one at home. </s>
<s> When i put the pass key that it asks into the computer it says that it is not the right one. </s>
<s> What am i doing wrong or is there something missing from the computer. </s>
<s> Not very experienced at this so be patient and spell it out in laymen terms thx </s>
<s> But as a test to see if it's your network, try it at a hotspot out at starbucks, macdonalds, panero bread, etc. </s>
<s> This will tell you if it's the network or the laptop. </s>
<s> I'd like to discuss this but I have to use networking terms such as WPA2, settings and more. </s>
<s> It's best if you tell what those settings are. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> laymens term means i dont know much about computers as such. </s>
<s> WPA2 i think is something to do with security but i could be mistaken. </s>
<s> If i hover the curser over the connection the it does not say WPA2 but WPA-PSK. </s>
<s> As afar as the signal goes then the other laptops can connect to this signal so i would doubt that it would be this. </s>
<s> I cannot connect to the signal with this laptop but when i go to my sister's house i can connect to her signal and that is why i am puzzled. </s>
<s> There does not seem to be anything wrong with it HELP!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> But unless we can use the networking terms and discuss settings think about how you get support today. </s>
<s> Is there someone you call over? </s>
<s> Maybe they can fix this one for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> give it a go. </s>
<s> Maybe i will understand it a little. </s>
<s> Not totaly brainless. </s>
<s> It is late as im in ireland at the moment and its 3 oclock in the morning </s>
<s> I've helped folk before and until I know the laptop works elsewhere I have to write it's a laptop in need of repairs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> if its too much of a chore then dont bother but i did tell you that it works at my sisters which is a different signal </s>
<s> Tell me which channel your router is on. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/7723-13973_102-560420/wifi-disconnects-from-time-to-time-galaxy-tab-7-plus/?tag=contentBody;threadListing where we find that it matters. </s>
<s> This can lock out a PC that is set one way and the router another way. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> are you a complete moron, If i was to give you all this information that you asked for then there would not be any need to be on this forum. </s>
<s> I thought that this forum helps people who are stuck with something on the computer who are unable to do it themselves unless they get help. </s>
<s> I have already told you that i do not know much about the networking side of things and you go and ask me to get you technical stuff that i could not possibley know. </s>
<s> I think it is best that i leave this forum and join another one that will tell me how to get the information that they want to fix the network that i am, trying to get </s>
<s> I avoided technical questions at your request and now you write this. </s>
<s> I'll try if you will but very few forums will help folk when they write such a post. </s>
<s> -&gt; Yes, it's technical stuff. </s>
<s> But it's the stuff that matters. </s>
<s> If you don't want to figure out this stuff that's OK but then you need to find help that can come over and find out the details and what the issue is. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
