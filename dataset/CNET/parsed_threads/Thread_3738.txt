<s> Yes that's right, my monitor is being a chunt.. </s>
<s> Brand new pc, bought it yesterday from (oh god) PC World, first thing that went wrong, was they gave me a european power cable, when they're a british company, with this building being situated, in none other than britain.. </s>
<s> So just been to town today, got my power cords swapped for UK spec, and Ta'Da.. Switch on the pc and i get the following messages flash up [OSD Locked] --- --- --- (short pause) --- --- --- [Power Saving Mode] or the same thing, but saying [OSD Unlocked] ..... Let me just re-state, this is a brand new system, not even connected to the internet yet, and it isn't working.. </s>
<s> So please help me so i can get the hell off my mothers crappy notebook </s>
<s> the pc has to be returned to store as it has a technical fault. </s>
<s> Not really surprising to me. </s>
