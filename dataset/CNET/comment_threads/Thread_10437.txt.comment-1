Hi, Currently I have a 1TB mechanical hard drive on my custom built PC.
I want to switch over to a solid state drive.
However, I am looking to save some money, so I had an idea to buy the cheapest, and therefore probably the smallest SSD available, probably around 30-60 GB.
I wanted to move my operating system and any necessary files to get my computer to run onto the SSD, and then have my extraneous files such as photos, music, documents, and possibly even programs onto the mechanical hard drive.
Is there an easy way to accomplish this?
