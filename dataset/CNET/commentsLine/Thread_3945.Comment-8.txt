transcend's an ok brand.
corsair probably has the best rep as high-performance ram companies.
crucial is considered high-quality ram also.
ocz, geil, patriot, and transcend are other companies who make high-performance (flashy) ram.
kingston and pny are mainstream ram and generally slower.
as for motherboards, it depends on your budget.
if you're willing to spend another $100, you can probably get a core 2 duo cpu and a 965 based motherboard.
but you'll have to wait a few more weeks and run the usual risks of being an early adopter of new technology.
if you're budget concious, but want to be able to possibly upgrade to a core 2 duo in the future, i'd recommend getting a mobo based on the 946g chipset.
here's intel's model:  it has built-in graphics, sound, lan, supports 4 sata devices, 2 ata(ide) devices, 8 usb ports, and pci express slots (for high-performance graphics).
it only 2 ram slots, so i'd recommend filling them with 2gb.
if you just want a good, inexpensive pc now, then get a motherboard based on the 945g chipset.
here are 2 suggestions: biostar, $93:  asus, $115:
