I don't really know what that (router firmware) means or how to figure that out... we did JUST get the router though.
I saw the settings on my router for the WPA Enterprise thing that said it uses a RADIUS, but that was not the option we selected.
Also how would that explain the reason my desktop connects wirelessly and it doesn't support the certificate settings
