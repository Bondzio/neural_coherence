1.1.1	My 4 month old dog just made two holes on my SanDisk Extreme III SD 1GB card..and when I place it on the usb reader, it states &quot;Please insert a disk into drive X&quot;.	St
1.1.2	When I place it on my digital camera, it said the SD card is locked, So I moved the lil lock thing on the sd card and nothing.	St
1.1.3	It is physically unlocked, but the Canon camera says the sd card is locked.	St
1.1.4	I don't think it's possible for me to run data recovery since the media card is not even being read.	St
1.1.5	The two bite marks it has don't look THAT bad, I honestly thought it was going to work, although you can see the green chip inside, but no such luck.	St
1.1.6	Any possible solutions to maybe unlocking my sd card?	St
1.1.7	or is it completely ruined?	St
1.1.8	PC specs : Windows XP, 512MB Ram, Pentium III 800mhz	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	As Vapcmd implies try contacting the manufacturer, see what developes.	St
1.3.2	In such small locks, the sliding part internal to that contact themselves may have broken off.	St
1.3.3	It still remains at its position on the &quot;locked&quot; setting, physically.	St
1.3.4	Small tools if a physical impairment, access it and move if off to the unlocked position.	St
1.3.5	This is only a guess any actual damage and warranty to replace are at the makers discretion.	St
1.3.6	Remember, it not their fault your dog bit it, sorry.	St
1.3.7	tada -----Willy	St
