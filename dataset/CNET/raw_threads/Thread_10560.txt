I did purchase another internal drive for it. When installing the other internal harddive, i had to install software before i could use it. If i reformatt my drive, would it recognize it right way? Its a 160GB harrdrive with very important stuff in it. I need to know if it can recognize it after the reformatt of the 80gb harddrive it came with. Info: eMachines 3882 Segate 160gb hdd
