one thing to keep in mind is that dell, hp, compact and gateway will use non standard cases and mb.
so a standard atx mb may not fit in your gateway case.
a pii is probably a at case fromat so an atx mb will not fit.
save up you money and plan on building a new pc.
outpost.com has a amd sempron 2400+ and ecs mb for $70.
get a new case for $50 with a 400wpsu on sale.
a stick of 512mb ddrpc 3200 for $40 after rebate.
a dvd burner for $40.
a 128mb video card is $50.
