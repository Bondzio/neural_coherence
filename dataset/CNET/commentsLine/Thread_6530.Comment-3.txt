router and adapter are in the same room, about 6 feet apart.
router has always worked previously, just using ethernet cable.
but i've never tried it wirelessly before.
ssid broadcast is enabled.
router is a 2wire 2701hb-g. if i understand you, you're saying that you don't expect the wireless adapter to work if my ethernet cable is also plugged in?
