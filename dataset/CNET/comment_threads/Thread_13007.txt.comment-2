I suspect that 1TB disk is newer SATA and maybe even your older MB is having problems with its size.
You might see if your drive has jumpers to scale back to &quot;legacy&quot; SATA speeds or you might just try using a small drive.
Of course basic PC maintenance such as cleaning out the dust and reseating connections won't hurt.
Make sure you PS is up to the task as well.
I've never had much luck with giant HDs in old machines.
Good luck.
