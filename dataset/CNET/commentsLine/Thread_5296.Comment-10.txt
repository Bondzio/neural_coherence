the answer to your question if you're buying a laptop is pretty easy, yes, you're pretty much stuck with whatever graphics capability comes with it, whether it is integrated or a separate chipset.
laptops have very limited expandability.
for a desktop, the answer is more interesting.
first off, no, you aren't limited to integrated graphics as long as you have one or two pci-e slots, and a decent power supply (psu).
you can add a gaming graphics card, assuming that you have a roomy enough case (take a look at the dimensions of an ati radeon 5850, for example, good graphics cards generally only use one pci-e slot, but are double-width).
chances are when you do this you'll also have to upgrade the standard psu...they're usually only in the 300w range.
for example, when i upgraded the graphics card in my dell desktop pc, i also upgraded the psu to 650w, since the stock psu was only 375w, and lot of the graphics cards require about 500w.
also, i needed to make sure that i had space in the case for the graphics card that i was going to buy.
cooling can also be a problem, but most oem systems should be adequately cooled, and the graphics cards all have built-in fans as well.
so, within the above parameters, yes, you'll be able to upgrade your graphics capabilities if you get a decent pc with enough extra space to begin with.
