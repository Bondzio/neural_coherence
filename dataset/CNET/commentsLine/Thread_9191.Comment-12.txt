intel gma 950 graphics processor with 64mb of ddr2 sdram shared with main memory(4) (4) memory available to mac os x may vary depending on graphics needs.
minimum graphics memory usage is 80mb, resulting in 432mb of system memory available in 512mb configurations and 944mb in 1gb configurations.
the above, from the apple site, would indicate that the gma950 has no ram of its own except for 64mb of dedicated system ram and then draws from system ram for everything else it may need.
it would also seem to be using 16mb of the system ram at all times.
while this system is capable of supporting 2d graphics, like flash, and low stress 3d graphics it will not stand up to something like halo.
as all the processing of graphics is done by the intel processor, the extra load and relatively slow ram speed will result in unacceptable performance.
having said that, i'm not sure that video editing requires the use of a high end graphics card as the function of the program is not to display the video, but to manipulate it.
i could be wrong but the displaying of video from a dv source is not quite the same as displaying video that is the result of millions of calculations from code source.
bob p may have an opinion on that.
bottom line?
while this machine will run vista, it probably will not support all the bells and whistles that have been added to the top end version.
also note that ms have specifically prohibited the use of most versions of vista when running under a virtual environment.
(parallels or vmware) boot camp is ok for all versions though, it is not a virtual environment.
