LGA775 is the newer design for the P4 processors and I still see a few such processors available. This doesn't mean I'm recommending it over the ASUS. Both are beyond the days of manufacturer support and there won't be a way to determine which will outlast the other. But, the Intel is probably newer. Hope that helps.
