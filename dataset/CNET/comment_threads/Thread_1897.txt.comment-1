I am building a P4 pc.
I am no expert but I built a 1GHZ pentium years ago after I blew up my old one.
I purchased an ASUS p4S8x MB off ebay.
I also purchased a P4 2.6 ghz 533mhz processor.
Well the problem is the proocessor turned out to be a 800 mhz processor.
I guess it was listed wrong or I was just screwed by some seller.
My question is will this processor work on this board?
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
