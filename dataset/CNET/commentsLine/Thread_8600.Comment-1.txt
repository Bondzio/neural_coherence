few days ago, i let my computer to download a movie.
it took few hours.
when i came back and wanted to open the movie, i found my computer in 'hang' state.
then i pressed power button, shut it down and started again.
it again became hang.
i thought its because of virus problem and tried to format.
even after multiple tries, i couldnot format it.
finally, i made only one partition of my hard disk and tried to format again.
and it worked.
this way i did the complete format of my hard disk.
however,my laptop did not worked out the way i wanted.
it is too slow.
and if i open up heavy programs(having more disk space i.e.
photoshop, dreamweaver etc) it becomes hang.
i took my laptop to the service center and they said that its the problem of hard disk and i should change my hard disk.
but i dont think that my hard disk is totally corrupted and if it is not why should i change my hard disk?
right??
nowadays, i open it in safe mode.although, it generates a bit more heat than usual, it works well.
can you please tell me what exactly is the problem??
and how can i solve it?
?
