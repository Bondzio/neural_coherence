Some advice on my new computer	First of all I bought the new Intel 945 chipset on a Gigabyte board but I see a lot of people bying the 955 chipset on Asus boards. I didnt see a whole lot of difference between the two except 100$. Did I start out making a wrong choice. Im building this computer to be worth something in 2-3 years until I build another one. Secondly I am confused about why cpu price varie so much but the specs say nothing different except .2 Ghz for example with the new LGA slot chips like the 800 series and 600 series the specs are identical (specs below) can someone tell me the difference between the 800 and 600 series and whether .2Ghz matters that much cant I overclock the difference. Thanks for your help LGA 775, 830 Price $$ 359.00 LGA 775, 840 Features: Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology, Level 1 Cache (Two 16KB Data Caches and Two 12KB Micro-op Execution Trace Caches), 2x1 MB Level 2 Cache, 800 MHz Front Side Bus, Execute Disable Bit, Intel Extended Memory 64 Technology (Intel EM64T), 90nm Process Technology, Streaming SIMD Extensions 3 (SSE3), Dual-Core Processor.

13951	2	113094	1284517	1284426	John Robie	7/7/05 1:00 PM	1.1207412E12	Nope, you didn't make a wrong decision	with the 945 chipset. The 955x chipset is for the Intel Pentium Processor Extreme Edition. The 945 chipset is top of the line for Pent D (dual-core) or Intel Pentium 4. There are two versions of the 945, a 945G and 945P. Difference is slight, however the 945G may be little higher in price as it has the new Integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA 950) and PCIe x16. The 945P only has the PCIe x16. The 945G also has other minor differences like HDTV & LCD widescreen modes, dual display option. The difference in 6xx & 8xx. The 6xx came out around January to introduce the 64-bit support distinguishing it from the 5xx series. The 8xx series just came out a month or so ago to introduce the &quot;Dual-Core&quot; Processors and it also has the 64-bit support. Unaware of overclocking.....seems to me if all it needs is overclocking then there would not be such a price ifference.

What i meant by overclocking was when I look at the specs between the 830 and the 840 they look identical one is 3.0 Ghz and the other is 3.2 so is the 300$ difference a good investment. My prof said that when a new processor speed comes out that a lot of times its just the old processor overclocked to a faster rate. One more thing does the 945 support the 8xx series(dumb question?)

13951	5	113094	1285037	1284724	jcurry	7/7/05 6:17 PM	1.12076022E12	thanks Akonny	Im slowing getting all this now. I see that there are two different 800 series. Pentium D and the EE which pentium made exclusively for the 955 chipset. So my only question now is the price diference between the PD 830 and 840 $329 or $558 and the difference between 3.0Ghz and 3.2Ghz and thats the conundrum and where I began in this forum. Please help me to justify to my wife the 200+$ difference. Thanks for seeting me up with my line of attack against the 600 series I won that battle. Lol
