seems like you want to your pc to be a media center pc.
a cheap case that i like is the thermaltake soprano.
dvd burners are cheap; $60 or less gets you a dual layer.
since you have an sli ready motherboard, it makes more sense going with nvidia.
if you want a tivo type thing, then get a seperate tv tuner.
ati all in wonders are good since it doubles as a t.v.
tuner and graphics card.
they are however bad because they do have problems when you are trying to burn a show to dvd, or are trying to record a show.
as i said, get a graphics card and a seperate t.v.
tuner card, or an external t.v.
tuner.
as for the graphics card, you have such nice specs on your system that you should get a better graphics card, and also your motherboard is sli ready.
as i said before, you should get a gefore 7800gt, but if that is to expensive then get this  you can also put the 6800 gs in an sli configuration.
