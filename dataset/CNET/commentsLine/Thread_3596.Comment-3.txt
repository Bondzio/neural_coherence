ok, i just checked on the net and i am 90% sure i can use a crt with an lcd togther in dual monitor setup.
and, i checked the box for the video card and i am 99% sure i can support dual monitor.
my question is now, if i am wrong about these 2 statements, let me know.
my main question is tho, how would i use dual monitor.
like, would it play the game for example on both monitors, or could i use one monitor for the game and another for another program?
lastly, ius it easy to setup up dual monitor?
