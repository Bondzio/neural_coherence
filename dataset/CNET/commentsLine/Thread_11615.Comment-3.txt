is there any other way other than 1080p for blueray watching you mean?
well i really think it all depends on screen size and viewing distance.
on a large screen there would be no difference between 720p and 1080p to the eye unless your viewing form really close up.
on a 20 inch monitor, being fed a 1080p source like blueray, i think one would have a hard time discerning a 1080p monitor from a &quot;900p&quot; one.
(all else being equal) the 16x9 ratio probably makes more difference at that size than the resolution.
if i had more money i would be being a bigger monitor, not one with higher resolution at the same size.
