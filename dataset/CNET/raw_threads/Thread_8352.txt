Hi, I have a Dell Dimension E520 with a Intel Celeron 2.8GHZ processor and 1GB of ram, and I want to upgrade it to be able to play blu-ray on it and since my processor isn't fast enought to play blu-ray, I want to upgrade my graphics from Intel intergated graphics so, that the graphics card will do all the encoding, so that it doesn't require the processor to encode it. I am looking for a good graphics card that will do the encoding without using the processor that is under $200 and will work on my Dell Dimension E520 without having to replace the power supply. Thanks Dell Dimension E520 Intel Celeron D 2.8GHZ 1GB of Ram Windows Vista 32-bit 305Walt Power Supply
