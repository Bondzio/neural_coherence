i recently purchased an external hd (3.5 desktop seagate barracuda 7200.7 80gig model:st380011a) and a hard drive enclosure (unbranded but working).
i wanted to connect the hd to my laptop with a measly 20 gig hd to store video.
i tested the enclosure with a 10 gig quantum fireball hd that i knew worked fine.
the drive was recognised by windows was formatted etc through usb 1.1. when i tried to connect my drive using the enclosures firewire port however the drive failed to show in my computer.
after some serious fiddling it did work (once) and i was able to transfer data successfully.
after this i put the seagate hd in the enclosure and attached it to windows via usb 1.1. the drive was formatted in ntfs and worked perfectly.
again when i tried to use firewire it failed to be recognised by windows, no matter how much i fiddled.
now my firewire port in my laptop is a pcmcia card (unpowered), this couldnt be the problem however because the enclosure has its own power supply and you can hear the hd initialising when you flip the power switch on the enclosure.
the firewire card itself works fine, i have tested it with my ipod mini and it recognises it and transfers data perfectly.
i've checked device manager and the hd doesnt show in disk drives when connected via firewire, when connected via usb it shows as 'st380011 a usb device'.
the firewire device shows as it should do, under network adapters and ieee1394 devices when plugged in.
the thing that really has me confused is that about 80% of the time when i connect the hd via firewire i can hear the ping that shows windows has detected a new pnp device, but nothing shows in device manager, my computer or disk management!!!
please help me!!
p.s.
i own a toshiba satellite 1110 mobile intel celeron 1.5 ghz 256mb ram 16mb mobile radeon graphics
