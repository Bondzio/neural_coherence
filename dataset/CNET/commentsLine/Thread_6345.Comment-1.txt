my old hp pavilion dv9207us stopped working and i purchase a new hp pavilion dv3-2155mx notebook.
the old computer will not start up.
i pulled out the external hard drive (western wd 1200bevs) sata 2.5&quot; and purchased a thermaltake blacx docking station (p/n: st0005u) to transfer data onto my new notebook.
it says it should easily transfer sata 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; hard drives.
i am cannot connect my hard drive to it.
do you know why?
