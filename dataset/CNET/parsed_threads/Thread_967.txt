<s> I have a network setup in my house using a Netgear 3500 wireless N router. </s>
<s> I have a Dell computer hooked to the router with a cat 6 cable and a HP printer hooked up with USB to that computer. </s>
<s> I bought a new laptop with Windows 7 and am trying to get that to be able to print wireless to the HP printer. </s>
<s> I have followed the instructions from the Microsoft site and can't get it to work. </s>
<s> Microsoft says it is possible so I must be missing something. </s>
<s> I talked to a couple techs at BB who said they didn't think it would work because of the Windows Vista and Windows 7 mix and advised me to buy a wireless print server. </s>
<s> I could buy a wireless printer for a little more money than the print server, but really don't want to spend the money right now unless absolutely necessary. </s>
<s> My Granddaughter uses the laptop for her school work and then we have to hookup the laptop to the printer to print things out which is a real pain. </s>
<s> Has anyone else on the forum run into this and if so how was it fixed? </s>
<s> If it won't work, I will bite the bullet and buy a wireless printer. </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>

<s> I have a new Dell Desktop with Windows 7 hardwired to the router and a Canon printer connected by USB to that computer. </s>
<s> I have a laptop with Vista and am trying to get that to to print wireless to the Canon printer. </s>
<s> When trying to print from the laptop I get a message which says that the print drivers can not be found on the laptop. </s>
<s> Do I need the drivers installed on the laptop if the print is connected to the desktop? </s>
<s> I was thinking the same thing and loaded the drivers and software on the wireless laptop and still couldn't it to work. </s>
<s> A friend of mine has the same router and printer setup I do and has no trouble at all getting his wireless laptop to print. </s>
<s> The big difference is both his desktop and laptop are Windows 7 Home premium. </s>
<s> It must be a problem with Windows 7 and Vista not working with each other causing the problem. </s>
<s> The techs at BB said it wouldn't work, but they were also trying to sell me either a wireless print server or wireless printer. </s>
<s> I am going to another computer tech today that does this for his living and see what he says about it. </s>
<s> Will let you know what he says. </s>

<s> Contrary to what the BB and Staples techs told me, you can print wireless without the expense of added equipment. </s>
<s> The tech yesterday told me it can be done and said I had it setup right, but was leaving out one step, the last one, choosing the network named printer rather than local. </s>
<s> If you go to Microsoft support and follow the instructions closely on setting up your network, it will work. </s>
