Not expensive and worth trying for the few hundred bucks.
Remember that we'd hand make the antennas in our shop (we are engineers) so that's a zero cost item.
In the US if you interfere with others then the costs can be so high that you &quot;don't want to know.&quot; So what you noted is not done in populated areas and I must decline citing US regulations.
Let me try this again.
No one will tell you it will or will not work but I can give you the one important nugget and that you want to run it at 802.11b speed.
