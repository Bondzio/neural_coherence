firstly if you are using xp go to control panel/display/settings and then see what the max.
supported resolution of your graphics controller is by sliding the bar to the far right.
i think a 22' monitor needs about 1680 x 1050. if you find that your graphics controller can only just handle the 1680 x 1050 res.
you may be better off going for the 20&quot; or sticking with the 17&quot; the down side of running your graphics card at near max.
resolution will be very very slow frame rates when playing games and poor quality video.
