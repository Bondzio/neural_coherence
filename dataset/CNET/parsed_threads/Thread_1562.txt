<s> The only thing I have from my old eMachines system is my Klipch speakers so thats all I have. </s>
<s> THank you all for any and all advice you can give me. </s>

<s> is codewords for &quot;Good motherboard&quot;. </s>
<s> If you have a good motherboard? </s>
<s> With a fast bus? </s>
<s> You can always upgrade later, adding things to it. </s>
<s> So get a fast reliable motherboard with the latest chipsets. </s>
<s> Best quality. </s>
<s> Then budget everything else (except the monitor). </s>
<s> I know in the 1 setup that you guys suggested it had a tower w/450Watts. </s>
<s> I was just seeing is it smarter to get one over 500 or can 450 do the job. </s>
<s> Also anyone else have any setups that might be good for me. </s>
<s> The only product I think I am going to go with at the moment is the eVGA 7600 GT graphics card so if you can think around that please let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks again for all your help! </s>
