<s> Booted up my mom's comp and it said that one of the drives had bad sectors and recommended that I run scan disk. </s>
<s> After scandisk, it said that physical damage had occurred to the drive and that I should back up the files. </s>
<s> My mom has extremely important things on that drive so I transferred them to the secondary hard drive in my comp (no it isn't partitioned it really is a seperate drive). </s>
<s> Now I'm just looking for a course of action. </s>
<s> Is scandisk just giving me a bogus analysis? </s>
<s> Any suggested course of action would be appreciated. </s>
<s> windows 98SE 80gb ultra ata hd that is the trouble </s>
<s> the file to run from a floppy to run diagnostic tests of the drive. </s>
<s> That should tell you where you stand. </s>
<s> Is the drive still under warranty?? </s>
<s> A few years ago the warranty was 3 years, then most changed to 1 year. </s>
<s> If you you have no receipt to prove when you bought the drive, they will go by the date of manufacture that is on the nameplate. </s>
<s> You really do not have to prove ownership. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> I would look for the receipt, call the mfg., and get an RMA number, for free replacement (hopefully). </s>
<s> The good news: HDD's are cheap to replace, these days (about 69.00 at Fry's for a 120 gig). </s>
<s> I ran scandisk overnight from Windows with a full surface scan. </s>
<s> When it was finished it said it didn't find any errors. </s>
<s> But now when I boot up the comp, there's no error message or anything. </s>
<s> Is it possible scandisk fixed something? </s>
<s> Scandisk scans the HDD sector by sector and it has a better and more rigid testing parameters than checkdisk. </s>
<s> If it finds a bad sector, it tries to recover the data written on that defective sector then transfer it elsewhere to a non-defective sector. </s>
<s> Scandisk thereafter patches or marks that defective sector as bad so that any data will not be written on it later on. </s>
<s> If bad sectors had been reported in your HDD, then you have to prepare yourself for HDD replacement. </s>
<s> Back-up all the files. </s>
<s> Don't re-format it (I am referring to the defective HDD) , erase important personal files so you can show the defect to the shop where you bought it, of course, if it is still under warranty, else, you need to buy a new unit. </s>
