<s> My mom purchased a Dell laptop, which came with a free Dell A920 printer. </s>
<s> So, having no need for it, she let me have it for my computer. </s>
<s> When I was trying to put the ink cartidges in, I broke both retaining doors for the cartridges. </s>
<s> Since my last 2 printers were Lexmark, I was used to pushing down on the locks and having the doors pop up, but on the Dell you have to push the locks in. </s>
<s> I didn't know this and wasn't paying attention so I pushed them down and broke both both of the locking clips off. </s>
<s> The printer still works if I tape down the doors, but I would still rather fix them since the printer is brand new. </s>
<s> Plus the tape loses grip often and the printer makes a whole lot of noise from the doors hitting the top of the printer. </s>
<s> So does anyone know if it's possible for me to get replacement cartidge doors? </s>
<s> Can I get them online somewhere or am I going to have to contact dell for this? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Contact Dell and *hopefully* under warranty the printer maybe replaced. </s>
<s> Allow your Mom, to call or call on her behave and start the process to see if they're cover it, it worth a shot. </s>
<s> Otherwise, the cost of finding and replacing maybe too expensive or just a PITA to deal with. </s>
