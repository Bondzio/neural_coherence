1.1.1	Hi, I have connected USB disk drives to my Win XP PC in the past and worked fine.	St
1.1.2	However, having recently borrowed a 50 GB usb drive, I cannot view this in My Computer.	St
1.1.3	It is visible in device manager, in disk manager it is marked as &quot;Healthy (active)&quot; but has no volume label (also no info in the &quot;file system&quot; column).	St
1.1.4	when i right click, the only option is &quot;delete partition&quot;.	St
1.1.5	in DiskPart, the disk is visible and &quot;online&quot; but does not appear as a volume.	St
1.1.6	i have noticed that in device manager the Location is Location 0.	St
1.1.7	Not sure if this is right or not, as the C Drive location is Location 0 (0).	St
1.1.8	the disk has data on it which i need so cannot format etc, can anyone help me get access to this disk?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	in computer management/disk management, open help, go to the index, and open the importing disks , overview topic.	St
1.3.2	the command line info should be what you need.	St
1.3.3	btw, location 0 is the position of the disk on its controller.	St
1.3.4	i assume the usb disk is the only loaded/connected usb drive and is thus location 0. your c: drive is location 0 on your hd controller.	St
1.4.1	thansk for the reply, but when i try to import the disk i get a message saying &quot;the disk you selected is not part of a group that may be imported&quot;.	St
1.4.2	any ideas what this means?	St
