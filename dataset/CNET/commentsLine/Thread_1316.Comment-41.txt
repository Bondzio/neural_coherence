i have been intergrating my laptop with the stereo system and tv for years.
it's getting easier to find compatible hardware since the flatscreen technology has become more affordable, and i don't need analog converters as i did in the past.
i didn't see anything groundbreaking about the marriage, but i am a broadcast radio engineer and announcer.
we've been &quot;wired&quot; to the pc for a long time in the broadcast industry.
it followed me home from the radio and tv stations one day...
