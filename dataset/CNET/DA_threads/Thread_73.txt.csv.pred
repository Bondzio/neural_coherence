1.1.1	Here's the new hardware I bought: nforce2 ultra 400 ga-7n400-L mobo xp 3000+/400 barton geforce fx5900 xt 4 sticks of 256mb pc-3200 viking When I boot up nothing happens.	St
1.1.2	It's like the video card isn't even there.	St
1.1.3	When i replace the mobo with my old one, it works (sort of).	St
1.1.4	What I think is happening is that the video card is set to 2x agp and the mobo doesn't support 2x.	St
1.1.5	But i cant see the bios so i cant set it to 4x.	St
1.1.6	Thats the big problem, another is when i replace the new mobo with the old one i can boot into windows but it will only recognize 128mb of ram.	St
1.1.7	Which is really strange because i have 4 256mb sticks in it.	St
1.1.8	thx for help guys	St
1.2.1	The usual gaffe on such a list is the lack of a power supply.	St
1.2.2	I'd use a 450Watt PSU to get by.	St
1.2.3	As to the RAM, the Nforce's require specific memory sticks.	St
1.2.4	Did the supplier help you with this?	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
