well in that aspect, i guess it would be a better choice to use dvd-rw media.
fortunately i have dual layer discs, so that gives me some extra storage space per-disc.
i was hoping to use usb for an easier storage method, but not at the cost of potentially losing data.
that would basically defeat the whole purpose of backing it up.
