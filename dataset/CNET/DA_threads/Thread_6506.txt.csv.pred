1.1.1	Hi , all .	St
1.1.2	I have two laptops , both running XP and running wirelessly .	St
1.1.3	Both computers are able to access the internet and both WERE able to see and access the other computer but one day it just stopped happening .	St
1.1.4	Both are still able to access the internet but I ca n't see computer 1 while on computer 2 and vice versa .	St
1.1.5	I have a 2wire modem that I am using .	St
1.1.6	Nothing has changed that I can think of that could have caused this to happen .	St
1.1.7	I have disbaled the firewall on both laptops and still a no go .	St
1.1.8	I 've also tried going through windows and & quot ; setting up & quot ; the network again on both laptops .	St
1.1.9	I 've also tried a suggestion from another thread on this forum that involved setting up the wrong network , rebooting , and setting up the correct network but this did not work .	St
1.1.10	I ca n't figure out how to disable the firewall on the 2wire modem just to try this out but I do n't think that is the problem .	St
1.1.11	Any help would be GREATLY appreciated ! !	St
1.1.12	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Well , I ended up checking the network today and it was working ! !	St
1.2.2	I think the suggestion in the other thread worked which had you set up the network the wrong way , reboot , set up the network the right way , and reboot .	St
1.2.3	I think I just did n't wait long enough for the network to catch .	St
