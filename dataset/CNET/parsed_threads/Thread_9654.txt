<s> I originally had a Western Digital Hard drive specs are: 750 GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache The drive I purchased to install with it was a Western Digital Caviar Black specs are: 640 GB 7200RPM 64MB Cache My problem is that once I received the new drive I wiped my computer and proceeded to install both drives everything installed fine. </s>
<s> I used the newer drive that has better specs for the C: drive partition and the old drive that is a little bigger as a D drive. </s>
<s> I'm only going to have the two partitions and I was going to use the D for just installing games, for instance my steam games which I have a lot of. </s>
<s> Everything installed great. </s>
<s> Didn't really have a problem. </s>
<s> Seemed like the new drive was a little slow at some points but still worked out. </s>
<s> After I installed everything I've noticed that when I go to access or just load up steam or navigate on it I get the loading cursor for a few seconds, I'm not an impatient person but I mean it brings this up every few seconds for the simplest things.. like clicking on a particular game to view the page or initializing a game to install. </s>
<s> I was told that this could be that the old drive that I'm putting just my games on (D drive) doesn't have a paging file for it and that if it did this might clear it up but then I read somewhere that putting a paging file on a drive you will only see if a difference if the drive you put it on is faster than the other. </s>
<s> I'm kind of confused about the whole thing can you put a paging file on two drives? </s>
<s> Or can it just go on one? </s>
<s> I just don't really have any knowledge on this topic at all and was wondering if someone could up my understanding of this, and also if this would even make a difference and if so how do I do it? </s>
<s> Thank you very much for any help. </s>
<s> That's not it. </s>
<s> Never has been. </s>
<s> What OS is this? </s>
<s> XP for example has issues with the new 4K sectors. </s>
