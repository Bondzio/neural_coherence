i currently use s-video to connect my laptop to my lcd tv but found that i could get much better resolution using a borrowed vga cable.
neither my tv nor my laptop have dvi ports, so is a vga cable the best choice for watching streaming movies or dvds from my laptop dvd drive on my tv?
can i attain hd picture quality through this connection?
would i benefit from purchasing a vga to hdmi converter like these:  my graphics card is the stock intel gma x3100 capable of at least 1280x800 resolution (see specs below) - should i consider upgrading?
also, what features (if any) should i look for in a vga cable to get the best picture?
i went to an office supply store last night and found only cables that were for use with 17&quot; and smaller displays.
what's the difference between these and the cables that are used for larger displays?
thanks in advance!
hardware details below.
sorry if some information is extraneous: computer: toshiba satellite a205-s7458, vista tv: samsung ln46a630, 1080p, 40,000:1, 120hz video card: intel gma x3100, intel gm965 chipset, 358mb graphics memory, displays 1280x800 on laptop (capable of more?)
