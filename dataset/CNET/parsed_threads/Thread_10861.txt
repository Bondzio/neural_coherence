<s> I recently tried to setup a VoIP telephone through my wireless network, but experienced a major problem: According to Uniden, the people who make the phone, the phone needs to be wired directly into the router or modem. </s>
<s> However, the modem is not in the office, where the phone needs to be. </s>
<s> I was able to get the phone to connect to the network in the office by plugging it into a computer on the wireless network, and telling Microsoft Windows to bridge the wireless and LAN connections. </s>
<s> However, when I began using the phone, the call would frequently cut out. </s>
<s> Someone told me this is because the wireless is not fast enough to relay the voice signal. </s>
<s> However, the computers on the network have used voip programs like Skype without any lags or cut outs. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the delay is being caused by the windows bridge? </s>
<s> In short, if I get a wireless bridge from D-Link/Netgear/Linksys, and plug the phone into that instead of the windows computer, will it eliminate the problem? </s>
<s> The computer is running Windows XP SP2 and the wireless network runs off a D-Link DI-524 wireless router (the network is a wireless G network). </s>
<s> Thank you for any help, svz90 </s>
<s> Stray off the beaten path and there is no support. </s>
<s> I used such a system for awhile and found that over wifi it was too unreliable. </s>
<s> I moved to another system later in which I wired the voip to the router and that worked fairly well. </s>
<s> I don't expect anyone to tell you that this or that will work since wifi is subject to a lot of interference. </s>
<s> I decline from writing much about this interference since I'd be duplicating web content. </s>
<s> This is likely why it cuts out. </s>
