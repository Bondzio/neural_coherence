<s> Hi, I,m just planning on buying a computer and i wonder if a sound card really makes any difference? </s>
<s> I would gladly accept recommendations about different sound cards which have got good test results and are worth the money. </s>
<s> (listening to music and sound with movies) the sound built in motherboards is quite good enough. </s>
<s> But maybe you've got some special requirements you don't mention? </s>

<s> Unless you're an audiophile or require a specific audio need, what comes with a typical system now will do fine. </s>
<s> Of course, you can usually upgrade after the purchase later. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The one lackluster area of onboard I've found is the occasional lack of stereo inputs. </s>
<s> The next is the analog inputs tend to be noisy compared to any Creative Labs card made in the past decade. </s>
<s> Beyond that I'd try the onboard sound first. </s>

<s> If you're thinking of a ready-made computer (assembled in a factory, ala HP or Dell), it's gonna have audio on the motherboard, and is going to be quite good sounding, surround-sound capable and all that jazz. </s>
<s> I'd encourage you to try the built-in before investing in an add-on. </s>
