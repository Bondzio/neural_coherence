<s> I need to replace my wifes old 333mhz Dell and am not sure if this is best way to go. </s>
<s> My budget is around $500-$600 and she primarily uses it for web, email, and digital photo storage, editing, etc. </s>
<s> Id like to use it for video editing too. </s>
<s> She really wants a laptop but I cant get something powerful enough in this price range. </s>
<s> I also feel like if Im going to buy something now, it should be Vista Premium compatible which is why I like this HP model. </s>
<s> I realize video card & pwr supply may be an issue for Vista later. </s>
<s> I could go with a slightly smaller box, A1600N same cpu but 3800+, 1GB RAM and for a little less money. </s>
<s> Is there a substantial performance diff between 4200 vs 3800? </s>
<s> But Im also wondering if I should wait on getting a Vista machine (better deals & compatibility later?) </s>
<s> and just get her an even cheaper box to get by until can afford a much better box?? </s>
<s> BTWthis is for her birthday which is right after Xmas so Im motivated to take advantage of the few remaining Xmas deals. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input and advice!!! </s>

<s> hp will provide a free upgrade coupon for vista with that pc. </s>
<s> it's vista-ready as it is now. </s>
<s> as for downgrading, if you're not saving more than $150, stick with that cpu and 2gb since that's what they're worth. </s>
<s> My advice, get what you want for you ... get what she wants for her ! </s>

<s> 1.8 GHz 3400+ , 1600 MHz, AMD, ATI Radeon Xpress 1100 Sempron, $549 </s>
<s> get at least a turion x2 or a core duo. </s>
<s> also be sure to check if an acer comes with a vista upgrade (hp/dell/gateway etc do, but some of the smaller brands don't). </s>
<s> Office Depot has a Toshiba Satellite on sale now with Core Duo T2050, 512MB, 80GB, DVD burner, 14.1&quot; widescreen, & XP MCE for $600 (after $150 rebates). </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> My local Office Depot has it but they don't offer the Vista upgrade. </s>
<s> Debating if I should even worry about that now. </s>
<s> They didn't even advertise the rebate at the store. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip! </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/expressupgrade.mspx Looks like the upgrade is dependent on the HW MFG...not the retailer. </s>
<s> Let me know if you see it otherwise. </s>
