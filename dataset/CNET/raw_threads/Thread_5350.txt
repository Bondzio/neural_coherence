E.g: I have a form1 which has to use IP 122.230.255.255 and lets say form 2 to use another IP 123.230.255.255 Thanking you in advance for any positive help provided. For information, i am on a network where the IP addresses are assigned automatically by my ISP and i dont want to use this IP, i want to use the specific ones which has been provided. Best rgds, Coolhans82

Here's more about that. http://www.comptechdoc.org/independent/networking/guide/netaddressing.html &quot; The value of 255 is never used as an address for any part of the IP address. It is reserved for broadcast addressing. Please remember, this is exclusive of CIDR. When using CIDR, all bits of the address can never be all ones. &quot;

I have serious doubts you will be getting far with such basic IP address issues. Your question sounds as if you need some basic courses on WEB servers and how a log in works. I've yet to find anyone use the IP address. Bob
