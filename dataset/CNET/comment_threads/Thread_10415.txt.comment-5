You provided lots of information but still need a.
For $800 the hp mentioned is a nice machine.
There are 3 major companies that still make desktop (HP, IBM, and Dell).
The others only do it as away of supplementing their laptop sales.
I would stick with on of those 3 or go to your good/trusted local computer dealer (not best but/CompUSA) and tell them you want to spend $750 including tax for a decent box with a large hard drive and a full 1 year warranty.
You should get a decent system without the head ache.
