Try changing your FIOS router with a standard DLINK, Netgear or Linksys router.
My Samsung Katalyst T-Mobile phone works fine with wifi with my Dlink WBR 2310 router(switched to DLINK DIR 625 and it still works).
If the FIOS router is in only wireless G/N mode or in WPA2 mode, your samsung won't connect.
The FIOS router must also be broadcasting SSID.
Good Luck!
