i found another person who had the same problem with the same hd model as me.
here is his post: --------------------------------------------------------------------- hi all -- just came across this post after having this same event id 51 problem myself.
i built a new system this weekend with the following specs: asus a8n sli premium motherboard amd x2 64 4800 processor (2x) samsung sp2504c 250gb sata 3g drives with ncq in addition to the event id 51 problems, i was having intermitent problems with windows taking a long time to boot.
it was driving me mad!!!
a big thank you to everyone with similar specs who solved the problem by disabling the command queueing on the controller in device manager.
that seemed to work for me as well... i'll let this go a few more days but this appears to have fixed things.
wondering if anyone has tried the 6.70 nforce4 drivers from nvidia and keeping command queueing on.
my current drivers are the 6.65 and these clearly don't work with ncq.
------------------------------------------------------------------- it all seems to lead to nforce4 controllers that are incompatible with the model of hd.
all my pata and sata controllers are nfore4 intel edition.
