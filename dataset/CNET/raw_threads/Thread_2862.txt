There were a few blue screen of death issues before this problem occurs. I found out that none of my software causing my system to crash but the NT kernal alone. Do advice

I have a Asus P5N-MX motherboard Intel Pentium Processor E2160 Kingston DDR2 667Mhz 2+1 GB WD Caviar Green 500GB Phoenix BIOS Windows 7 32-bit I turn on my PC and I can't even see the BIOS page. Power indicator does turn on, but my monitor is blank, I have checked everything including my monitor, but no sign of faulty cable. I have removed my RAM and test again, normally the system with no RAM will produce a long beep, but this time no beep is produced. I have also checked the cable on the motherboard, none of them are loosen or connected wrongly.
