backup is defined quite well out there.
it's that copy you have put somewhere for the day your hard disk or such device goes wonky.
where is that backup?
&quot;dos_fat_32 partition type.&quot; that's the worst possible file system to trust for usb hard disks.
i always feel sad when i see those.
good luck, bob
