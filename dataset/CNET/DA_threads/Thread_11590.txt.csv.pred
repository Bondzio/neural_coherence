1.1.1	Hi This decision is painfully difficult for me right now .	St
1.1.2	I ca n't decide between tablet hybrids .	St
1.1.3	I know the specs and everything , but the design type is eluding me .	St
1.1.4	I need to use a tablet mostly as an e-reader and math writer ( stylus ) for my books and math class , but I need it to function well with a keyboard for typing essays and reports for english , science , ss , theology .	St
1.1.5	The ultimate goal is to have a mid-cheap atom based tablet plus keyboard , preferred to have trackpad .	St
1.1.6	Most have 2GB lpddr2 and 1.5 ( 1.8 ) Ghz clover trail .	St
1.1.7	I 'd like to keep it in the atom tablet range to keep it cheap .	St
1.1.8	I 'm mostly stuck between tablets like the asus vivotab TF810C , and the dell latitude 10 business model plus bluetooth keyboard case and larger battery .	St
1.1.9	Other than that , HP envy x2 is nice , but no digitizer .	St
1.1.10	Any help with this or added tablet options would be great .	St
1.1.11	With the asus vivotab , I 'm reaching $ 870 with msd card and keyboard dock .	St
1.1.12	This is getting into ultrabook range , but the lenovo yoga does n't support active digitizers , and I do n't know any other convertibles in this range that reach 8+hr for a full day 's use at school .	St
1.2.1	Why this is , is well discussed .	St
1.2.2	But here we go again .	St
1.2.3	Since the battery is just a 300 cycle rated part and the warranty only calls the battery bad when it drops to 50 % capacity you see that to get 8 hours a day for 2 years you need a battery that when new hits 16 hours and then in 2 years you are still getting your 8 hours .	St
1.2.4	What 's odd about such a requirement is it 's rarity .	St
1.2.5	You might find new students that want this or think it 's a requirement but if it was then would n't there be plenty of choices ?	Ques
1.2.6	OK , battery 's done .	St
1.2.7	On to the digitizer .	St
1.2.8	What do you use now ?	Ques
1.2.9	Why I ask is that I find many ask for this then in a year they are back to mouse or pad .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'm in high school right now , and my classes are still crammed together , making a 7 hour school day .	St
1.3.2	There 's my 8 hour requirement .	St
1.3.3	After school , I 'm free to move about and find a power outlet .	St
1.3.4	Next year , I 'll be in college and have charge time between classes .	St
1.3.5	I might start saving now and sell this tablet hybrid after a year to move up to a core i hybrid with less battery and more performance .	Sug
1.3.6	I 've done my research on digitizer pens and palm rejection and how it works .	St
1.3.7	Last year , I was all pen and paper .	St
1.3.8	I 'm very interested in writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus .	St
1.3.9	I 'll be adjusting to the glassy surface and need the touchscreen to have the necessary support for active digitizers for good palm rejection to work and for enough accuracy for handwriting .	St
1.4.1	Then you are going to re-discover the truth about this one .	St
1.4.2	Hopefully you do n't get too upset later .	St
1.4.3	It 's odd to see you write about handwriting recognition .	St
1.4.4	That is , since when was it a digitizer issue ?	Ques
1.4.5	Or palm rejection ?	Ques
1.4.6	You seem to write as if you are new to all this .	St
1.4.7	I fear you would buy such a thing and then write blogs or facebook how bad it is .	St
1.4.8	Avoid all this and get out there and use these things .	St
1.4.9	Then you will find out exactly why I have written the above .	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
1.5.1	The usual Google Nexus 7 , Transformer tf300t with dock , other pads .	St
1.5.2	And the office plunked down an Asus x202e but not one would be my idea of what would be needed to meet your requirement .	St
1.5.3	None have the 16 hour battery time we need to begin and not one has progressed to the point I would call handwriting to text conversion worthy of use .	St
1.5.4	Notetaking ?	Ques
1.5.5	Sure .	St
1.5.6	But unless you are doing this , you may be seeing the promises and not the reality .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	I do n't want it to try to recognize my handwriting and convert it to text .	St
1.6.2	I want it to keep it the way it is , but I need it to follow the pen more closely than a passive stylus would .	St
1.6.3	I expect it to be difficult to adjust to and have imperfect accuracy , but I also expect it to be usable for a first timer like myself .	St
1.7.1	I do n't see where you 're going with this .	St
1.7.2	I have a budget of $ 900 for the hybrid plus accessories , which is why I 'm looking at the atom based ones .	St
1.7.3	I do n't need 16 hours , but if I did , I 'd stick to the asus vivotab TF810C plus keyboard dock or the latitude 10 plus 4 cell battery .	St
1.7.4	I did n't mention text conversion at all .	St
1.8.1	Atom based windows hybrid , not android	St
1.9.1	It appears you are going to learn this the hard way .	St
1.9.2	Good hunting and come back in a few months with your experiences .	St
1.9.3	1 .	St
1.9.4	16 hours .	St
1.9.5	I thought I covered why you need that .	St
1.9.6	In just a year with these 300 cycle batteries , you will have to replace the battery to keep that 8 hour usage per charge .	St
1.9.7	I had hoped this simple explanation would suffice .	St
1.9.8	2 .	St
1.9.9	& quot ; text conversion & quot ; is what you noted about .	St
1.9.10	Here 's what you wrote - & gt ; & quot ; writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus. & quot ; How else would one highlight a paragraph unless the app converted your writing into text ?	Ques
1.9.11	-- & gt ; I have these things and have encountered too many students that thought all this was good to go .	St
1.9.12	Well , the good to go part must be vendors and industry willing to take your money .	St
1.9.13	Bob	St
1.10.1	My reply was to share what we have at the office on hand beyond the others that have come and gone .	St
1.11.1	I meant writing out my math as one thing and highlighting in digital textbooks as another .	St
1.11.2	Writing out my math requires my authentic handwriting to prove it 's my work .	St
1.11.3	I do n't think it could recognize my poor handwriting anyways .	St
1.11.4	I only need to have 7 hours for one school year .	St
1.11.5	Afterwards , I wo n't need that much .	St
1.11.6	If it halves in 2 years , then it quarters in a year .	St
1.11.7	one school year is about 2/3 of a year , and 2/3 of 1/4 is 1/6 .	St
1.11.8	5/6 of 9 hours is 7.5 hours On a full charge , the samsung ativ 500t would reach 6.7 % of it 's usable capacity at the end of the last day of high school .	St
1.12.1	http : //www.amazon.com/computers-accessories/dp/B0098O9TB0 I do n't see any user access to the battery so my bet is that it 's a return to factory as you wear out the battery .	St
1.12.2	- & gt ; About digitizer accuracy .	St
1.12.3	I find in all the models with the usual touch sensor ( AKA capacitive ) that a stylus works best and we have to write larger and shrink it later .	St
1.12.4	Again , I am doing this but it appears you have yet to use these products .	St
1.12.5	So here is how I would write on almost any of the usual tablets .	St
1.12.6	1 .	St
1.12.7	Grab the stylus .	St
1.12.8	2 .	St
1.12.9	Start the app ( natch . )	St
1.12.10	3 .	St
1.12.11	Get to where I need to write .	St
1.12.12	4 .	St
1.12.13	Write at about 2 times the size I want and then use the note taking app 's feature to shrink it to the good looking normal size .	St
1.12.14	Only those that have not used these devices would think they could write as if they were on college ruled paper .	St
1.12.15	Bob	St
1.13.1	The software available today is still not good enough to handle perfect conversion of written text or speech into a word document .	St
1.13.2	I have always tried to find a good program out there and have yet to stumble across one .	St
1.13.3	I recently purchased Mac Speech Scribe and paid $ 150 for the latest version and it is still no good .	St
1.13.4	It skips words and just cant grab ahold of what I am saying , even when I do annunciate .	St
1.13.5	Does anyone have any suggestions of software they know works well and does n't run into the same problems everyone has ?	Ques
1.13.6	I feel like I would have known by now if there was , but if anyone has suggestions , please share .	St
1.13.7	Note : This post was edited by a forum moderator to remove signature link which are prohibited in the forums on 07/19/2013 at 1:58 PM PT	St
1.14.1	As I previously stated in reply to R. Proffitt , I do n't need or want to convert anything to digital text .	St
1.15.1	Being able to use an active digitizer requires more than the regular capacitive touchscreen .	St
1.15.2	It also needs to have inductive input .	St
1.15.3	That 's the deal with the different kinds of digitizer pens .	St
1.15.4	For example , the dell xps 12 can use a digitizer but not an active digitizer because it only has capacitive input .	St
1.16.1	But you 've lost me here .	St
1.16.2	Keep in mind I 've been around since the GE 210 and was part of a company that made a few light pens decades ago .	St
1.16.3	To me , any device that translates position into some x , y and possibly z coordinates is in fact a digitizer .	St
1.16.4	Now with that out of the way I think you are asking what resolution these digitizers have .	St
1.16.5	My answer is they are poor for drawing and do slightly better with a stylus .	St
1.16.6	The Samsung S Note uses the active pen as well as the Activ PC .	St
1.16.7	You want to use a stylus so be sure to go for models that have such .	St
1.16.8	This does n't cure the other issues that will come back to haunt you .	St
1.16.9	Bob	St
1.17.1	I 'd budget a new battery in a few years but with the S pen , it probably will do what you want .	St
1.18.1	You 've helped a lot with your information .	St
1.18.2	I 've decided that I still need the trackpad , so I 'm crossing the latitude 10 off the list .	St
1.18.3	Now , all I have left to decide on is whether to get the samsung ativ 500t , 9hr , for $ 680 total or the asus vivotab TF810C , 12hr , for $ 900 total .	St
1.18.4	If I calculate purely based on battery life , they have almost the same value/price .	St
1.18.5	I 'm also about to order in some parts for a diy lithium ion battery pack @ 14.8V , 9.6Ah going through a car DC port and adapter for any device I choose .	St
