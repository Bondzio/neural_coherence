1.1.1	oh wow this is annoying .	Polite
1.1.2	i bought a linksys wireless N PCI card , and i had two problems , one was resolved in another thread about using WPA encryption , and the other is I had a stuttering problem which did n't exist on the wireless-G usb by linksys .	St
1.1.3	so i decided to try a D-Link wireless-N usb adapter to replace the PCI one , thinking the PCI was causing interference with my PCI soundcard .	St
1.1.4	well , it stutters alright , but another check back on the wireless-G usb card shows no stuttering .	St
1.1.5	any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	tried that , thank you for the suggestion though .	Polite
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	but is n't this an adapter problem ?	Ques
1.5.2	the wireless-G adapter had no stutter issues .	St
1.5.3	my router is WRT300N v1.1 with firmware 1.51.2 and linksys is offering 1.03.3 for WRT300N v1.0 on their downloads page which is weird .	St
1.6.1	I 've had the same annoying stutter since I installed the N card and router .	St
1.6.2	I tried a couple of things I read on other threads , but nothing fixed it - it would stutter at least 2 or 3 times in a matter of 3 or 4 minutes .	St
1.6.3	I just tried something new and It has n't stuttered for 10 minutes - I 'm hoping this fixed it .	St
1.6.4	Go into your router 's control panel and open the Wireless Settings tab - in the Basic Settings panel , make the following changes : Radio Band : Standard 20 MHZ Channel Standard Channel : 11 - 2.462GHZ Then , re-establish your connection .	St
1.6.5	I 've just listened to over half a CD and still no stutter .	St
1.6.6	Hope this helps .	St

1.7.1	hey earl , thanks for the response .	Polite
1.7.2	unfortunately that 's not good enough for me cause i work as a composer , so having a wireless system that causes any stuttering is really bad .	St
1.7.3	for the time being i 'm still on my G adapter and just hoping that the N router has been helping with the connection however it can .	St
1.7.4	maybe not by being N but being more up-to-date maybe it has better range .	St
1.7.5	then for those moments when i 'm really stuck with say an FTP upload i use my cheap D-Link N adapter .	St
1.7.6	this is not ideal though but hey better than drilling holes in my house for wiring .	St
1.8.1	The Linksys WRT300N was one of Linksys ' first configurations in the Wireless-N format .	St
1.8.2	All reviews by CNET , PC Mag and other reputable sources gave it a less than stellar rating going back to June , 2006 .	St
1.8.3	User opinions were worse .	St
1.8.4	If your devices are all 802.11 b/g then a wireless-N router is going to afford you little to no improvement .	St
1.8.5	802.11- b/g devices are intended to operate in the 2.4Ghz band and not the 5Ghz band of 802.11-n. Granted WPA security is better than WEP .	St
1.8.6	However , to gain the maximum through-put in a 802.11-n environment you need to use WPA2 security .	St
1.8.7	Unfortunately , most 802.11 b/g devices prefer WPA .	St
1.8.8	If you want 802.11-n and 802.11 b/g connectivity there 's only one best choice - the Linksys WRT600N router which has dual band capability for 2.4GHz ( 802.11-b/g ) and 5GHz ( 802.11-n ) .	St
1.8.9	Also , it is the only router on the market , at this time , that will allow operation of both bands at the same time .	St
1.8.10	It has also received an excellent review by PCWorld Mag .	St
1.8.11	The only negative is that it 's expensive at $ 150- $ 200 plus and extra $ 100 for a WUSB600N ( USB ) adapter that supports both bands .	St
1.8.12	So , not knowing what devices you are trying to connect ( meaning their internal configurations and how old they are ) you may want to consider the WRT600N .	St
1.8.13	FYI , I own a Linksys WRT600N .	St
1.8.14	I did n't need the WUSB600N adapter as my laptop is wirelss 802.11-a/b/g/n capable .	St
1.8.15	Good Luck !	St
