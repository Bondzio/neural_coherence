hi there buddy , appears that u r struggling with this problem for quite some time.i have an exactly similar problem on a compaq presario 700 laptop.here's what i did : a. format the drive b. install winxp pro c. after the install , maintain only one account d. do not install any drivers at this stage - let the system run only on the native windows drivers.
e. go to regedit , to the following key - hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\winlogon f. right click on the right pane and click on string value g. rename this `new string value' to msgina h. right click on msgina , click on modify i. enter the value `c:\windows\system32\msgina.dll j. restart load the chipset driver load the audio driver after all drivers are loaded , load the video driver if this does not correct your problem , nothing on earth will.
however , on the positive side , i have noticed this problem on quite a few amd machines , but hardly never on an intel machine - there might be a problem of overheating of the cpu also.
