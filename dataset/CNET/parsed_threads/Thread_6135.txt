<s> Ok, I have a Western Digital 80 GB Hard Drive. </s>
<s> I have it hooked up as a slave right now and am attempting to format the drive with Partition Magic. </s>
<s> I can read from and write to the drive just fine in WinXP Pro, though Windows says it only has about 36 GB (I previously had a partition on the drive splitting it in half, so I'm guessing that is where this is coming from, but it no longer shows any partitions, just the one small drive). </s>
<s> Partition Magic shows the drive as &quot;BAD&quot; and produces an error when attempting to format (bad parameter/argument). </s>
<s> PM also reports that the drive has a bad MBR (Master Boot Record). </s>
<s> In Windows I can format to NTFS just fine, but nothing changes in PM. </s>
<s> I want my other 40Gigs back and to partition the drive again. </s>
<s> Is there any software or special jumper setting that can get it right? </s>
<s> Why not use Disk Management in XP to delete the existing partition and create a new one using the entire 80GB? </s>
<s> I suspect you format the drive into FAT32 earlier which may be why it only shows 32GB as XP cannot format a volume larger than 32GB into FAT32. </s>
<s> If you use NTFS then it can format all the 80GB in one partition. </s>
<s> Tell us what Disk Management reveals. </s>
<s> It should show the balance of the HDD as unallocated space? </s>
<s> For reasons I won't go into-my workplace had a WD 1200JD (?) </s>
<s> 8mb buffer drive they wanted converted back to Fat23 from ntfs,(GRRR) It resisted several efforts but what finally worked was to get a W98se boot disk, (bootdisk.com) make the disk, and also find and put on the disk &quot;DELPART&quot;, so that once I booted with the floppy-( the WD I was working on connected as only Hd-Primary master) I could type delpart at the A:\ prompt,( the usual message from the boot disk about there being no drive present)then rebooted, floppy again- then Fdisk, make whole drive primary and active, even though the W98 fdisk lists the total space incorrectly,then rebooted with floppy again and formatted-took ages, but it's what finally worked-then put it as primary slave in a computer with XPpro which we have left as Fat32, XPpro sees complete drive, then used Partition Magic 9 to gradually break into 30ish partitions -one at a time-reboot each time.. and it finally worked all the way thru-now I can,if need be, make any of them into NTFS, or not// whatever they decide....I may have been able to leave out a reboot here and there-but this had made me so crazy I decided to go for the smallest verifiable steps and reboot.. </s>
