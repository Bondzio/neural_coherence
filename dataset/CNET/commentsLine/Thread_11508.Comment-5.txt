they're all good, but i prefer the d-link routers for several reasons that include their performance, their user interfaces, their ease of setup, their versatility, their rock-solid reliability, and most importantly their absolutely spectacular customer support.
i personally use a d-link dir-655 which reaches every corner of my rather large, three-story home with excellent throughput.
as with most routers nowadays, when wired it serves as a gigabyte switch.
i got mine very soon after their introduction over three years ago now and it has never suffered as much as a hiccup requiring a reboot.
but understand that any router, even old 80211.g routers (please get an 80211.n -- it really makes an enormous difference), can swallow a 12mbps network connection -- or much faster than that -- without a hitch.
your router will not be the choke point effecting internet performance.
please note that my preference for d-link in my own home and my recommendation of them to others is what a lawyer would call a &quot;statement against interest,&quot; in that i own stock in cisco, manufacturer of linksys home routers.
