14587	0	383753	3251776	NR	Learner7	2/20/10 6:56 AM	1.26664896E12	C: drive almost full	I have an MSI Wind netbook, with (I thought) 160GB HDD, but when I clicked on My computer properties, it says C: 39GB D: 106GB. A message came up saying I had minimum space (or something like that) on the C: Drive. I have 88GB free on D Drive. C: has programmes on it, D: also has some programmes, and all my data. I have XP Home SP3. The hard drive was already divided when I got the computer, and didn't realise everything was going on to the C Drive, until a friend advised me to put the data on D: Can I increase the size of C: with an SD card, (there is a slot on the computer) ? If so, when I put the card in howcan I link it to the C Drive. Also when I look at the computer properties it lists &quot;Memory Card on EP4695a4&quot; (Z:) but I don't know what this means, or where it is. The only connections I have on the netbook, are the Ethernet wire slot, monitor connection, headphones and microphone connections, 3 USB ports, SD Card slot. Can anyone enlighten me please?

If we fill thee closets, we either get rid of something or find other storage space. You can invest in a larger hard drive up to the capacity that your hard drive and budget can handle and you can clone the old drive to the new. You can buy an external drive but that takes away some portability convenience. You may be able to merge the two drive partitions but that has its downsides as well. I'd start with the larger drive option and you can keep the original for either overflow storage or in case of disaster. Ultimately, you get to work out the plan of your choice that fits your needs and finances.
