i'm informing you that adding more to this oem type pc will start to make it more stressful.
even, after all is aid and done it should work, it maybe on a limited(sooner or latter) start to falter.
that pc was build to be the model# is and only a little room to grow on.
once you start to burden it, it becomes less capable even though the os and immediate usage should be ok. it's the long run prospects that will become evident.
other considerations like cooling and power should also be included as i posted earlier.
its not that you can't probably add a another hd, it's the overall final pc and its continued use.
good luck tada -----willy
