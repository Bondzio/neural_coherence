hi guys, i have a fujitsu-siemens p4 3.2ghz, 512mb ram, 160gig hdd, and a high speed dvd + rewriteble cd rom.
the problem i have is that whenever i want to read a cd or intstall new software off a cd, it freezes the computer and i have to reboot the computer.
it does finally read the cd after 3 or 4 reboots.
one of the problems with the fijitsu-siemens is there is no reboot button, so you have to switch the computer off at the back and then on again.
first question is, is this not bad for the computer.
second question is, is there a speed setting for the cd rom, because is the cd rom reading the cd at the wrong speed and so causing it to freeze.
i hope someone has heard of this problem and can help me.
i'm a novice with computers so be gentle.
ha ha ha!
