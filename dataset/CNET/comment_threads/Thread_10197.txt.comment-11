It will be interesting since the people you have to deal with about the dead printer may take no interest in about 90% of what you posted.
Hopefully your venting here will let you blow off the steam and let them get the printer fixed/exchanged.
Politics has little to do with your issue or everything, but Epson service won't care.
Best of luck, Bob
