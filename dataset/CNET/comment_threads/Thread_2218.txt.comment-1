I have an ASUS B202.
I don't think a sound card was ever installed on this device, it's a hand-me-down but it's in great condition.
When I go to the volume control it tells me that &quot;no active mixers are installed&quot;.
I've installed the drivers from the ASUS website but an error pops up during install, &quot;no audio device on HD detected&quot; (or something like that).
I think my only way of getting sound off this thing without having to send it back to ASUS might be an external sound card (USB) but I know absolutely nothing about them.
Do they work?
Does it basically replace what should have been installed on the motherboard?
Thanks in advance for help, you guys rule.
