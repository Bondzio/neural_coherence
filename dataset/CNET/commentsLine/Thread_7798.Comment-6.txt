first a word from microsoft about the &quot;network neighborhood&quot; or nn for short.
&quot;note if a computer is removed from the network before the computer is logged off the network, it may take up to 45 minutes for that computer to be removed from the browse list.&quot;  this annoys many in that the nn is not realtime.
even if you had shared this printer for just a split second, it could have been picked up by another machine.
further documents show that the nn may hold such for days or weeks.
don't let it bother you too much.
