<s> Dell xps 600 Intel Plentium d 930 processor Hard drive wd 250 gb Windows xp home sp2 I want to buy and install a second hard drive for Linux operation system. </s>
<s> A search of Western Digital show the following small drive available. </s>
<s> wd400jd 40gb serial 150 ata wd800jd 80gb 3.0gb My current hard drive is the 3.0gb same as the 80gb. </s>
<s> What is the performance of the 3.0gb as compared to the sata 150. </s>
<s> Dollar wise the 80gb is a couple of dollars more and the extra storage is worth that much. </s>
<s> I just don't understand what the 3.0gb is telling me. </s>
<s> Once installed will I be able to format to fats32 using xp disk management. </s>
<s> I've been using ME for a number of years and always formatted with fdisk so this will be new to me. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help in advanced. </s>

<s> If I'm reading your post correctly both of these seem to be SATA drives the 40GB is a SATA 1 with a 1.5GB/s transfer and the 80GB is SATA 2 with a 3.0GB/s tranfer. </s>
<s> If you PC has the SATA connection I would suggest going with the 80GB drive since most SATA 2 drives are backwards compatible. </s>
<s> As for the drive format NTFS is traditionally more stable then FAT32. </s>
<s> sorry noticed you said you were making it a linux drive, are you planning on making using a swap file dual-boot system? </s>
<s> Another option would to be let the linux discs format the drive for you, so it's a native linux file format. </s>
<s> Depending on the Linux you should still be able to setup a Dual Boot system </s>
<s> Linux's installer will prepare the drive for you. </s>
<s> To trouble yourself with partitioning and formatting is wasted motion since the FAT32 partition will be unusable for Linux and you'll battle yourself as you learn more about Linux. </s>
<s> You might even post a question why Linux won't install. </s>
<s> Instead I'd boot my prospective Linux CD and take it's offer to install on the blank hard disk. </s>

<s> Thanks mcmatter now understand what 1.5gb and 3.0gb relate to in the harddrive spec's. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob will install on 80gb and manually partition to 40gb and swap and the rest free space. </s>
<s> Will use ext3 format from Dapper Drake. </s>
<s> Thanks again to both of you for the reply Ray </s>
