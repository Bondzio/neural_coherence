re question 3: i was wondering if it was possible to check the usb are actually 2.0, perhaps through control panel?
i live in tokyo and i bought the machinee here, hence why the os is in japanese.
if i am going to be looking around for the it will take me a while as my japanese especially as far as computer terminology goes is limited.
yes the os came with the machine.
does this mean i dont have to look for the drive and disk managment?
