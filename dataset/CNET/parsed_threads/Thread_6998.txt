<s> Hi Just recently i purchased an Hp Media Center m7160n and i was just wondering if it is possible to add a 2nd hard drive. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Take a look inside. </s>
<s> If there's an extra bay, and there are two controller ports on the system board, go for it. </s>
<s> And if there isn't a 3.5&quot; drive bay available for a second HDD, see if you have a 5.25&quot; drive bay available. </s>
<s> You could put the 3.5&quot; hard drive in a 5.25&quot; bay (mounting kit required). </s>
<s> Much much better in my opinion to mount a second drive internally for backup and extra disk space....just read the messages about externals in the STORAGE forum. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Be sure you new HD have to set as secondary slave...(jumpers on the back) if you have SATA, dont needed too, just add power, and cable and let's ready to roll </s>
<s> Hi again thanks for the help so far It dosent appear that i have a second hard drive bay, i found that my hard drive is a maxtor 250gb serial ata. </s>
<s> ifound the cable that goes from it to the mother board. </s>
<s> When i looked on the mother board i found that there was 3 more of the same ports in different colours. </s>
<s> What does this mean? </s>
<s> Also on the power cable that geos to the hard drive there is another cable coming from it that goes to the hp personal media drive. </s>
<s> Would i have to dissconect that to add a 2nd? </s>
<s> When i looked for other free pwer cables i found a bunch of regular 4 pin cables. </s>
<s> Could i get an adapter for those? </s>
<s> or would i need to buy another PSU? </s>
<s> so even if i could do all that and it worked were would i put i couldnt just lay it on the bottem of the case or could i? </s>
<s> Thank for the help so far, please respond with any info regarding this. </s>
