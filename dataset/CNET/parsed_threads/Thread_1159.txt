<s> Hello, I finished building my system, installed windows, etc and everything was running fine. </s>
<s> Suddenly the power shuts off. </s>
<s> When I tried to turn it back on, the power, fans etc would all turn on for a 1 sec and turn back off. </s>
<s> Then it finally stayed off. </s>
<s> Long story short, I ended up buying a new PSU and Mobo. </s>
<s> Same thing happens. </s>
<s> I isolated the problem to the ATX 12V 4 pin connector. </s>
<s> When it's plugged in, the mobo won't turn on but when I unplug it, the mobo will turn on. </s>
<s> Does this mean my CPU is fried? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> This problem occurs on both identical mobos. </s>
<s> Troubleshooting with just the 24 pin and 4 pin connected. </s>
<s> Specs: Mobo: ECS GF7100PVT-M3 PSU: Thermaltake Purepower 500 ATX 12v 2.0 CPU: Pentium D 3 Ghz Ram: 2GB </s>

<s> PSU is inside the case. </s>
<s> Mobo is outside the case. </s>
<s> Have you tried starting with virtually nothing attached ...no drives, 1 stick of RAM, only a speaker attached ? </s>
<s> Here's a link to the MSI Troubleshooting Guide... http://www.msicomputer.com/support/sup_tshoot.asp Keep us posted. </s>

<s> Ok so I cleared CMOS. </s>
<s> Connected ONLY the 24 pin to mobo with speaker and power on cables attached. </s>
<s> 12V NOT attached. </s>
<s> Still same thing. </s>
<s> CPU and PSU fans turn on but no sound or anything. </s>
<s> Verified all No POST steps on MSI's Web site. </s>
<s> Still no luck. </s>
<s> @!#$%^ Gonna try a new CPU tomorrow. </s>
