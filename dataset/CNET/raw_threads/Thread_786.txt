Hi guy's/ PC hardware Guru's. &lt;div&gt;Ok so I'm trying to build a new computer for the first time to play DCS and Battlefield 3 among others. At the time of buying my last computer I was quite up to date with computer hardware as in i told the shop what i wanted and they made it..... however, not any more. Please excuse my lack of understanding in this topic. So this is what I'm thinking so far: Not a complete list yet. maximus iv gene-z motherboard intel 2600K @3.40 GHz, 8MB Cache processor Nvida Geforce GTX 570 graphics card 8GB Kingston Hyper-x Genesis dual DDR3 1600MHz RAM 500GB WD5002AALX SATA 6 Gb/s, Hard drive CORSAIR 750W TX750 V2-80 PSU My current PC spec is: Intel Quad Core Q8300 @2.5GHz Processor 500 gig SATA - 7200rpm Hard drive 4 gig DDR2 RAM Asrock 4core 1600 GLAN Motherboard 1 gig nvida geforce 9800gt Graphics Card 620 WATT PSU My first question is: Can i rip any parts out of my old pc to use in the new one? I'm thinking that PSU is worth swapping but I don't know if it's compatible or will supply enough juice. And that hard drive looks good to swap but its slowly dying of old age so i think il bin it. Second question: im not exactly the best with PC hardware or the pricing of it either... so can you see any improvements that are worth while, or any errors i've made in compatibility? And finally: can you suggest any compromises to save money? Thank you very much for your time. &lt;/div&gt;

Suggestions.....add links to the products to ensure we're looking at the right products...even if you don't plan to buy there, Newegg has good selection, product description and buyer comments. Re reusable components... I don't see much to move to the new system. What 620W PSU are you referring to and how old is it ? Perhaps you could use the old HDD as a backup. VAPCMD
