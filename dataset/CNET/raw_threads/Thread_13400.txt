Just like we read at http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ many change video cards, add this or that as well as the power supply ages and then they are caught in a vicious spiral of blaming drivers, reloading windows or more. In short, the number of 1+GHz machines I've fixed by simply upsizing the power supply is nothing short of amazing. There is no reason to shortchange the power since 450 Watt PSUs are 15 to 30 bucks.

You can try a few other things to see if you can EEK by. Unplug an extra CDROM, remove the case cover and if it's AGP set the AGP rate to 1X. But 90 is just too slender to put much more than what the machine came with...

Read the article.	hmmm.. i just put in a new 300watt antec in and its doing the same thing.. but i have figured out what the main problem is, i just don't know how to fix it. i can only load up windows if the driver isn't installed..and when its not installed, the first 3d image that comes up makes my monitor go in standby mode and wont come back..and then i have to restart.. i've tried 4 different drivers already..

Turn off your computer and take out the old card and put in the new. On bootup the system should recognize the new and ask for the drivers. Your problem is a common one if you do not uninstall the old card first and then put the new one in. Hope this works for you

If your old machine is not plug and play or if your operating system does not have the right drivers, and you uninstall the old card you may have some trouble finding a driver for your new card, unless you have the disk that came with the new card.

I've tried everything.. uninstalling my s3pci card, taking it out and puting the gforce in and installing the driver in safe mode..but still when i boot in normal mode it freezes up on the load screen.. this was my first and last time buying an nvidia card..prolly just gonna scrap this one and go out and buy a ati card

4677	9	12830	147639	146847	R. Proffitt	2/23/04 4:45 AM	1.0775115E12	Aha! Try this.	The clue for me is &quot;i can only load up windows if the driver isn't installed..and when its not installed, the first 3d image that comes up makes my monitor go in standby mode and wont come back..and then i have to restart..&quot; The new card can produce a video signal outside the capability of the monitor. In fact, it may start off at 800x600 and beyond 72Hz. To fix this... Install the driver and on the last reboot, boot to SAFE MODE. Go to the display properties and set the video size to 640x480 and that should work on the next boot. Then you can play with size and refresh rate to see what you can get on your monitor. Bob

They're a waste of time. I bought one for under $20 and I sent the PSU back 4 times and EVERY one of them burnt out within a matter of DAYS.
