<s> Hi I need help, it all started with an ipod.... </s>
<s> I have a p3 system that had been working fine running win 2000. then I started to have issues with the ipod, it would not recognize it, as it was using a usb1.0 I thought I would upgrade and see if this solved the problem, I added a USB card in one of the empty pci slots and then when I tried to reboot. </s>
<s> I got nothing. </s>
<s> I removed the card (all the while being careful to ground myself) and still nothing. </s>
<s> it boots up to the cmos and tries to initiate the hard drive but fails, the hard drive doesn't spinn at all and I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting the cables. </s>
<s> is there anyway I can get this thing working again or is it dead? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> the cables are connected but it does not spin.. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'll try that when I get home, what am I expecting to find? </s>
<s> if the HD spins is that good? </s>
<s> I also should mention that its SCUSII HD and has it's own controller card. </s>
<s> The old SCSI drives had a jumper which in English said &quot;Spin up when you get power&quot; and the other setting was &quot;Don't spin up until you get a command from the SCSI controller.&quot; If the controller was not set proper and it former setting was used, a boot failure occurs. </s>
<s> The joy of SCSI. </s>
