If you wiped out import files in the root directory the system will no longer boot.
You need to SYS the drive to get it to boot again, if it is seen at boot time.
Boot with a floppy disk that has the same version of DOS that is on the system (www.bootdisk.com for a copy) and then SYS the drive SYS A: C: to restore the boot information and get it to boot up.
