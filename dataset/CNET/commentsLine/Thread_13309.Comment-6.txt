what you've provided, and some information i found on hp's website, the mainboard has the intel 945 chipset, which is core 2 compatable in most all cases, and you said you have a core 2 duo currently installed (and working i would assume?)
which leads me to believe it might support the quad core, however there are other variables you should consider before going for a quad core, like the power supply and case cooling.
