1.1.1	Has anyone used DBAN , how long does it take to wipe your hardrive ?	Ques
1.1.2	( please specify capacity etc ) .	Sug
1.1.3	Reason I 'm asking is because The Airport in my country normally checks all computers .	St
1.1.4	I do n't have anything immoral , only Some pirated software ( and the airport here makes issues and fines about that ) .	St
1.1.5	I simply can not afford to buy software ! !	St
1.1.6	So my plan is to launch DBAN when the authouraties decided to check my computer ?	Ques
1.1.7	Do you think this could work in time ?	Ques
1.1.8	Please advise .	St
1.1.9	Thanks Dean	St
1.2.1	DBAN is not a 'quick solution ' and if you 're waiting at Customs at the airport expecting to be checked , you will not finish the process in time .	St
1.2.2	That in itself would be suspicious and if I were a Customs Official I would begin investigating further if a traveller turned up with a laptop running DBAN or similar .	St
1.2.3	I find your post rather strange .	St
1.2.4	Saying that you have & quot ; pirated software which is not immoral & quot ; is a matter of opinion .	St
1.2.5	I find it immoral , and offensive .	St
1.2.6	We do n't discuss piracy in these forums and such discussions often get locked .	St
1.2.7	But not only that , if you can not afford to buy the software , then you do n't use it .	St
1.2.8	It is that simple .	St
1.2.9	If you can not afford to buy a car , do you steal it ?	Ques
1.2.10	If so that is a criminal offense in most countries , and to me software piracy is the same .	St
1.2.11	You do realise that DBAN wipes everything ?	Ques
1.2.12	The whole hard disk .	St
1.2.13	Nothing survives .	St
1.2.14	That 's it from me but beware , I am tracking this discussion .	St
1.2.15	Any 'workarounds ' or otherwise replies that I feel contravene Forum Policy and I will start deleting and will lock the post .	St
1.2.16	Mark	St
1.3.1	Being a part time computer and network tecnician as well as a systems administrator I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT PIRACY IS !	St
1.3.2	And Yes I also know how DBAN works , All I wanted to know was an average of how long it takes to function .	St
1.3.3	Your argument is useless .	St
1.3.4	First of all if a person ca n't afford a car there is always public transport .	St
1.3.5	This is not always the case with Software ! ! !	St
1.3.6	I use many open source and freeware programs but there are still certain programs that I need which are neither of these and this is when I turn to piracy !	St
1.3.7	( and this is not my will , I only use it because my university insists that I use certain programs ! ! )	St
1.3.8	Secondly..	St
1.3.9	I did not ask you for any pirated software !	St
1.3.10	WHAT I ASKED is how long a perfectly legal program will take to run .	St
1.3.11	As I said your argument is useless .	St
1.3.12	Well Now Ill just use DBAN myself and see how long it takes rather than wasting the rest of my time arguing with you .	St
1.4.1	As we ca n't discuss pirated software , this discussion is now closed .	St
1.4.2	If you want to discuss DBAN , do that to avoid discussion locks .	St
1.4.3	If you want to discuss justifying use of pirated goods then post that in another forum so you can get going on the topics .	Sug
