<s> I am freaking out. </s>
<s> I received a Maxtor One-Touch 500 gig External Hard Drive for my birthday last year. </s>
<s> I have been using it without any problems up until today. </s>
<s> I have all my music, all my backups, and all my videos stored on this thing. </s>
<s> Today, I open up the next episode of Bones with VLC media player, and it plays the first 8 seconds and freezes. </s>
<s> Curious, I open up other files in the same folder, and they all behave the same. </s>
<s> So, I figure now would be a great time to defrag my external, and my computer. </s>
<s> I also run Ccleaner, spybot, and uninstall some old programs. </s>
<s> The problem is now worse. </s>
<s> It seems that around 70% of my eternal is messed up in some way, even the .txt files! </s>
<s> I can click on an episode from House MD, and VLC or WMP will play a song from Journey! </s>
<s> They are in completely separate directories, but are somehow connected. </s>
<s> The documents I had stored on there respond similarly. </s>
<s> If they are linked to something that notepad is not meant to read, they display strange characters or boxes. </s>
<s> I have no idea what is going on, but it seems like something has messed with the file structure and cross-linked files for some strange reason. </s>
<s> wiping my external and replacing all the lost media will take months, and I probably wont be able to recover everything. </s>
<s> If there is any way to correct the file system and make it so that Bones episodes dont play music from my Turisas collection, I would love to hear it. </s>
<s> Things I have done: Defraged several times Uninstalled and re-installed VLC Downloaded codec packs Restarted Tried other media players Cried Scanned for viruses Stubbornly clicked videos over and over, hoping for different results Died a little inside Googled like a madman made a cnet account. </s>
<s> With a corrupted hard disk, defragging is one of the things you certainly should NOT do. </s>
<s> Chkdsk with repair option is the only sensible thing. </s>
<s> All you can do now: format the drive (the partition) and start all over. </s>
<s> And, yes, you'll lose everything that you don't have a backup of. </s>
<s> That's a very common thing with external drives. </s>
<s> There are several reasons this could have happened: 1. </s>
<s> Bad disk, bad case, bad cable. </s>
<s> The best thing to do then: throw away the broken component. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Unreliable USB-port on the PC. </s>
<s> The best thing to do then: use another USB port. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> You didn't 'safely remove hardware'. </s>
<s> The only remedy: don't do that again. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> A one-time power interruption. </s>
<s> Difficult to prevent except using an UPS. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> A one-time software fluke. </s>
<s> Can happen. </s>
<s> Difficult to prevent. </s>
<s> Sorry to read about your loss. </s>
<s> Be more careful in the future. </s>
<s> Maybe the Bones collection on DVD (see http://www.amazon.com/Bones-Complete-Season-David-Boreanaz/dp/B000HT3P60 for example) is a nice birthday present for this year? </s>

<s> So, the one thing I had yet to try was to unplug my external, and then start it back up. </s>
<s> Worked like a charm. </s>
<s> But I assumed all that work you mentioned had taken several days, including at least one shutdown each night and reboot each morning. </s>
<s> So either all that work was done in just one day, or you're one of that people that leave their machine on continually. </s>
<s> That's not what Windows is made for. </s>
<s> Anyway, don't forget the lesson about backup of data on an external. </s>
<s> If you read through this forum, you'll see many posts about problems with external drives resulting in data loss. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Nope, all this took place in the space of a few hours. </s>
<s> See, I was going to have a friend over to watch the shows with me. </s>
<s> When I started one of them to see if everything was fine and it didnt work, I freaked out. </s>
<s> I happen to be one of those people who leave their computer on continuously. </s>
<s> I have read that starting up is the most stressful thing a hard drive can do, so I thought I was doing my system a service by leaving it on continuously. </s>
<s> How exactly is windows not made for continuous running? </s>
<s> I thought the only time windows needed to reboot was when a program was installed. </s>
<s> I don't think turning a harddrive off and on each day does have any negative influence on it's lifetime. </s>
<s> In fact, it can be argued it has a positive influence. </s>
<s> Mean time between failures is measured in hours of operation, without any mention of stops during that period. </s>
<s> There are hard drives in camcorders and mp3-players that only run when needed (to conserve battery live). </s>
<s> Windows has energy-saving options that turn off the hard drive after a certain period of inactivity. </s>
<s> They wouldn't do that if it's harmful. </s>
<s> The main effect of leaving a computer on 24/7 is a higher electricity bill. </s>
<s> The price of the power consumed during the night in the lifetime of a PC is comparable to the price of a new hard disk. </s>
