<s> I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 with Android 4.0 ice cream sandwich. </s>
<s> The HBO GO app won't play video. </s>
<s> I get the ratings screen, and then just the circle spinning around as though it's buffering. </s>
<s> My connection is fine and it runs Netflix great, this is the only app giving me problems. </s>
<s> HBO has no troubleshooting info on this. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> yes i have an HBO account and am signed in when this happens. </s>
<s> It also runs on my xbox and pc just fine. </s>
<s> It's up to the app's author to fix such things. </s>
<s> In other words the tablet maker's work is done once the app launches so now it's up to HBO's support. </s>
<s> You see this issue on BD players too so it appears that HBO, Netflix and others have work to do. </s>
<s> Why do you think it's yours to fix? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
