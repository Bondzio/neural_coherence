1.1.1	I had my old computer die .	St
1.1.2	I bought a new one with Vista but am scavanging the old parts from the old computer to make another older one work again .	St
1.1.3	The Problem I have right now is loading the OS on to the computer I am trying to get running again .	St
1.1.4	I had windows XP Home Service Pack 2 on my old computer and have taken out the Hard Drive and put it in an enclosure and hooked it up via USB to my new computer as an external drive so I did not loose any of the content from the computer that died , but I would like to take that copy of Windows XP from that hard drive and install it on my other old computer I am piecing together .	St
1.1.5	The old computer with the HD I removed originally came with XP installed on the computer when I bought it new and am wondering if I can burn a disc with XP on it and then load it on to the other old computer I am putting together from parts from the one that died ?	Ques
1.1.6	I have a new optical drive for the frankenstein computer I am putting together so it will have a super multi drive and I just need to figure out how to get the OS on to the computer I am resurrecting .	St
1.1.7	This will give my daughter that lives in another state a functional computer until she can afford to buy a new one .	St
1.1.8	I am sending over parts from my old computer to make the one she has work .	St
1.1.9	Sending a bigger RAM Card , the Super Multi Drive with old style connections , and just need to get the OS from my Old computers Hard Drive and installed in to her computer ( a relative of hers had pieced her computer together with a pirated copy of windows which is now causing trouble of some kind for her and all I know is that she needs a legit copy of Windows on it for her to use , I am trying to get my legit copy on to her computer instead ) I will only be using the copy of XP from my old computer on her one computer so I dont think I am doing anything wrong here .	St
1.1.10	I would like to keep from sending her my old Hard Drive if possible though if I had to do so to make it work I would .	St
1.1.11	Please help I have no idea how to do this .	St
1.1.12	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	Many think that the OEM license makes it & quot ; legit & quot ; and transferable but what you are attempting is outside the license and you are experiencing first hand the roadblocks they set up to make this fail .	St
1.2.2	In more harsh words .	St
1.2.3	You are not entitled to move a pre-installed XP OS from machine to machine .	St
1.2.4	You can try but there are far too reasons for it to fail .	St
1.2.5	And all are intentional .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have not attempted to do this but am sure that they dont design it to make it easy .	St
1.3.2	Though since I did buy it legitimately and am just trying to use it on one computer still it doesnt seem like it should be a big deal but I guess it is .	St
1.3.3	That was the whole point is my ex 's husband had put this computer and I dont know how my daughter foudn out it was not a legal copy but that is what we are trying to do just like I have done scavanging the other parts of the computer since it was not worth having fixed .	St
1.3.4	So what would be the least expensive legal way to get a copy of XP on to her computer and delete the illegal copy ?	Ques
1.3.5	Her computer is about 10 years old and not worth spending money on obviously but until she can afford a new computer we just want this one to run until then .	St
1.3.6	I have a super multi drive that was not SATA so I am sending her than an a 1 Gig memory card I bought for my old computer , so those will help make it run a bit better until she can afford a new one .	St
1.3.7	But I just need to know the least expensive way to get the OS on there .	St
1.3.8	Thanks Much .	St
1.4.1	A & quot ; legitimate & quot ; OS you bought would have an install CD .	St
1.4.2	You do n't have that so what you appear to have is a pre-installed OEM version .	St
1.4.3	Again this is all setup to make it very hard to impossible to move the OS to another machine because you do n't have the install CD .	St
1.4.4	- & gt ; It seems very hard for some to grasp the issue .	St
1.4.5	The parts are indeed scavenge able but the OS may be a dead item .	St
1.4.6	Let 's see that install CD .	St
1.4.7	The least expensive version of XP is over at newegg.com .	St
1.4.8	And if you just need to eek by till next year & quot ; Windows 7 RC will expire on June 1 , 2010. & quot ; So you can use that till then .	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	It seems you carefully worded your post to leave out exactly what old system you have .	Sug
1.5.2	Apparently many a pre-installed OS suggests an OEM type install .	St
1.5.3	If that 's case the OEM EULA makes transfer to any non-OEM brand system ( still hard ) outside of its intended usage .	St
1.5.4	The other posters pretty much covered the topic .	St
1.5.5	I just like to add , while you can get a & quot ; generic OEM & quot ; ( for new DIY system ) as your best bet to get your current swapped h/w plus any drivers required for that rebuild system .	St
1.5.6	In other words , you see the problems with & quot ; pirated & quot ; OS , the the same for old legit but non-original OEM system is the same result .	St
1.5.7	If you buy a retail version of XP ( full/upgrade ) you can install that on any 1 system and again , if that system fails on another system provided it remains on only 1 system .	St
1.5.8	The generic OEM version is likely the cheapest to get , though I exclude eBay and other sources .	St
1.5.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Thanks I will check that out .	Sug
1.6.2	It is like pulling teeth to get the self put together specks to the computer she has , she thinks she needs a new monitor because the mouse cursor is moving when the mouse is not .	St
1.6.3	So it is very frustrating for me not knowing much of anything about her computer but being asked to fix it blindly from another State .	St
1.6.4	I am not an IT wiz kid but she is not aware of common computer use which makes things worse .	St
1.6.5	My old computer is OEM installed version of windows xp home that I upgraded to service pack 2 over its life time .	St
1.6.6	It is an Emachines Model T2245 .	St
1.6.7	So no I never had the XP disc but at one time the computer crashed and I did have the restore discs from Emachine to wipe it clean and getting going again .	St
1.6.8	There was a suggestion to use Windows 7 Beta edition here but when I looked at the system requriements I dont think that my daughters 10 year old computer is up to the task .	St
1.6.9	It was a system put together by someone else and while she cant tell me how much RAM it has I am assuming it is low .	St
1.6.10	I have offered to send her a one Gig RAM chip I had installed on that old Emachines knowing it was not worth spending money on but that was cheap and kept to computer going for a while along with an inexpensive external mini 250 Hard Drive which I can use with my new computers .	St
1.6.11	So it doesnt sound like she has the system resources for Windows 7 or it would be a cheap way to go .	St
1.6.12	I do understand the licencing thing , but I dont have to like it .	St
1.6.13	I paid for one copy of the OS to be used on one computer and if the old one dies I think like any of the other parts I already paid for I should be able to use them .	St
1.6.14	But I do understand that this is not the licensing agreement made with the computer manufacturers .	St
1.6.15	So it sounds like the easiest thing to do is to buy a & quot ; Generic OEM OS & quot ; where is a good place to but this ?	Ques
1.6.16	I have always had the OS installed on my computers and have run recovery discs but never had to deal with buying any OS separate until now .	St
1.6.17	The other old computer with the Pirate copy of XP is in Idaho , I am in Seattle , My daughter doesnt knows VERY little about computers so I wont even have her machine to work with and between her and her husband hopefully talk them through the RAM card and Optical Drive installation .	St
1.6.18	For now a new OS would be good and perhaps I can work on her other computer issues at a later time .	St
1.7.1	I ran Windows 7 RC on a 512MB single core machine with an agp video card .	St
1.7.2	That is very dated stuff .	St
1.7.3	It booted and ran very nicely .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Ok well I was just reading the information from the microsoft site .	St
1.8.2	If I can get them to understand how to plug in the RAM chip they would have that covered .	St
1.8.3	I read the microsoft instruction on the need to download the files and burn them to a DVD as an & quot ; ISO & quot ; disc .	St
1.8.4	I am not familiar with that term so I wondering what setting to use on my brand new HP a6700y ( which I like ) and came with one & quot ; super multi drive & quot ; installed and I installed a second .	St
1.8.5	That way I could send her the discs and make things easier for her .	St
1.8.6	I think until June 2010 with Windows 7RC would be a perfect solution if they can just figure it out .	St
1.8.7	They should be able to save up for a new PC in a year and you cant beat free .	St
1.8.8	I will just make sure they back up everything on the computer they have now .	St
1.8.9	If I can make the discs I am thining between the two of them they can figure out how to install them .	St
1.8.10	Thanks Much	St
1.9.1	That 's not a hardware setting .	St
1.9.2	It 's a way to burn a ISO-file ( a disc image ) to a DVD , so the exact details on how to do it depend on your burning program .	St
1.9.3	Which one do you use ?	Ques
1.9.4	Kees	St
1.10.1	Well I believe these are the programs I have .	St
1.10.2	Windows Media Player Windows DVD Maker Cyberlink DVD Suite Avega Media Centre Quicktime Muvee Nero 7 For audio I usually just use Windows Media Player and for DVD 's I have been using Nero .	St
1.10.3	But whatever works best or if I need to download something else is just fine .	St
1.10.4	Thanks , Tom	St
1.11.1	Choose the & quot ; burn image to disk & quot ; option and select the iso as file to burn .	St
1.11.2	This should give a bootable DVD .	St
1.11.3	Kees	St
1.12.1	Ok I will use Nero 7 .	St
1.12.2	I downloaded the file when I went to bed so I can make the disks .	St
1.12.3	I really would like to go over where she is to do this stuff for her I think they will have a hard time installing the DVD multi drive and chip and dont understand why they need to & quot ; upgrade & quot ; like this , even though it is all free .	St
1.12.4	I think she may also be confused with the 7RC and the browser 7 but I tried to explain the difference .	St
1.12.5	But thanks for the advice , the RAM is too old to be useful for a new computer and the connectors for the super multi drive wont work with a new SATA connection , but will make a big difference with her hacked together illegal OS systemed computer until they get a new one and a year should be long enough .	St
1.12.6	Thanks , Tom	St
