My question is, would flash drives be better in terms of hardware reliability? Let me give you an some examples of what I was considering: External Hard Drive Enclosure: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817816008 2.5&quot; Hard Drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148128 Now the total for the enclosure and drive is: $64.98 which gives me 80GB of storage. Now, for Flash Drives, to get anything remotely close, I'd have to get a 64GB Flash drive, and on newegg those range from $100-$130, and don't really have that great of reviews. To me, the obvious solution would be the enclosure + hard drive route over the USB Flash Drive. But, is there something else I'm not factoring into my choice here? Keep in mind I'm not dead set on the exact hardware I'm picking yet for this purpose, I just used the newegg links to give you an idea of what I'm looking at. Also, if I were to get a larger capacity drive to match my PC hard drive, would it work to make an image of my PC hard drive, port it to the external via USB and use that to replace my data in event of a crash? Or is USB way too slow for large chunks of data? Thanks for any and all help, I appreciate it.

Just yesterday I found a machine that would corrupt any volume that was plugged into its USB ports. -&gt; Would that upset you? It did its owner as they had nothing backed up on DVDRW or such. -&gt; Why I note this. The USB hardware was reliable. After we found the cause and fixed that, all devices that we could format began to work again so the bottom line was &quot;all the hardware was reliable.&quot; Bob

I see your point. Now, I do know there are some flash drives that have a read only switch, similar to how old floppies worked. I assume there is no way to make a HDD read-only however? In that case, it seems that for a safer backup method, flash drive wins in that respect.

Fortunately I have Dual Layer discs, so that gives me some extra storage space per-disc. I was hoping to use USB for an easier storage method, but not at the cost of potentially losing data. That would basically defeat the whole purpose of backing it up.

Of course, in the unlikely event that stuff gets zapped on writeable media I'd be out of luck. I've heard disabling auto-play in Windows prevents viruses that attack USB drives from destroying your data. Of course, that's not going to help if you aren't even aware you have the virus in the first place but I have avast pro and spybot search & destroy installed, so I'm pretty safe unless I get nailed by a zero-day virus, but I highly doubt that. I don't open suspicious email attachments and only download things from reliable sources. But my question is, taken from the poster above, a PC he was working with corrupted the data on the USB devices. Would disabling auto-play work in that instance? Of course, we might need specifics of what exactly was going on with that computer to figure that one out. Just trying to cover all my bases.

It was quite the puzzler. -&gt; As to autorun. Please take a look at AUTORUN EATER. Very nice patch for a very serious issue. Bob

You can get 4 or more times as much storage for the same amount of money as that. http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=414&name=External-Hard-Drives I am assuming you must have a laptop. If you've got a desktop, I'd go for a twin-drive raid array if you are really worried about your storage.
