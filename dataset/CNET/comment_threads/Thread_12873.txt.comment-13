I reinstalled the video card by first using device manager to remove all drivers and uninstall it, then I removed the video card from the machine, put it back in, and reinstalled the video card.
It does not have onboard video, it has to have a video card.
I thought I fixed the problem by turning down the video card clock speed, but it happened again.
Need more help, as Nvidia wont help and both game manufacturers dont help.
