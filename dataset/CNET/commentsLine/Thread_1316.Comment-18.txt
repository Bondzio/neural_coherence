yes, i have 2 computers, i.p.
duel core and amd duel core attached to a 42 in samsung plasma along with a ps3 this is also attached to a 5.1 sourround sound audio system.
my dish hd allows hd/tv to play with the same system to the tv.
im very impressed with the blue-ray movies on the ps3.
the scaler on the playstation 3 does a great job on regular dvds.
my main interest is gaming.
i have all the rainbow six and ghost recon games, as well as the delta forces games by novalogic.
ghost recon 2 [pc] looks as good as the hd games on playstation.
my graphics card is a nvidia 8500.
3 gigs ram.
you cant have to much ram when playing games...
