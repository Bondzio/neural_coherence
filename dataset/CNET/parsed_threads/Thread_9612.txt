<s> I have a 2 year old 52&quot; LCD TV with Ethernet port, no wireless. </s>
<s> Is there a device on the market, I can connect through the Ethernet port on the TV (or HDMI), which will allow me to connect to my wireless home network? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Find a shop that has a help and return policy in case you can't get it working. </s>
