<s> Hi guys, I'll make this quick. </s>
<s> Basically i want a tablet that HAS to be 10+ inches (So no small nexus 7's (Don't see the point in a small tablet) And i would like it too be pretty quick. </s>
<s> So dual core and some sort of tegra. </s>
<s> But the main thing (Unless you can persuade me otherwise) is i want a high res screen. </s>
<s> (I played on my friends ipad 2 and being able to see the pixels really annoyed me) The best fit i can find is the nexus 10,. however it's out of my price range. </s>
<s> At the office we are porting apps so I get to play with a lot of tablets. </s>
<s> We got to try the cheaps, that is the ones half the cost of a Nexus and lower and always came away with issues. </s>
<s> Now those that buy such have their reasons but for now I think the bottom end is the Nexus and the rest is for folk that have a budget to meet. </s>
<s> That is, they have to compromise what they want to meet the budget. </s>
<s> The iPad with retina is great too. </s>
<s> And take another look at the Kindles. </s>
<s> Remember you didn't tell what use this is. </s>
<s> A rather poor and now poorer student thought it could stand in for a laptop! </s>
<s> Ouch! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Theres no need to pay that sort of cash for a tablet ... i got an android tablet for like less than half that and it was good for me. </s>
<s> Got it at this reltd.org website and have never had any problems. </s>
<s> Plus you dont need to tell anyone you didnt pay 200 odd quid for it lol </s>
