<s> Hello everyone, so I'm looking into buying a powerline adapter and have narrowed down my decision to two possibilities: the TP-LINK TL-PA4010 AV500 or the TRENDnet TPL-406E2K AV500. </s>
<s> The thing I'm really concerned about is any disconnection problems - if the connection happens to drop for some reason, I would hope that it would be able to reconnect itself rather than having to manually plug it back in. </s>
<s> I know the TPL-406E2K has a high editor's review on here, but the TL-PA4010 has more reviews on Amazon with a higher percentage of favorable reviews. </s>
<s> It's hard to find any other sources of reviews on the latter though. </s>
<s> Any guidance about either would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> And never found them to drop UNLESS they are on different legs or AC phases. </s>
<s> That issue will dog powerline use for the current and future users. </s>
<s> As they document that, I'll just note it and nod that all seem fine if they are on the same AC side. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't have knowledge of either of those particular units, but I've had luck with very similar adapters. </s>
<s> I've never had a problem with disconnections. </s>
<s> The link was always solid. </s>
<s> Just remember to plug it directly into the wall and not into a surge protector or power strip. </s>
<s> Surge protectors will interfere with these devices, and you will very likely have issues if you don't plug it directly to the wall outlet. </s>
<s> TP Link and Trendnet are both trustworthy to me; I own networking gear from both companies. </s>
<s> I would recommend just relying on the reviews and be sure to purchase from a place with a good return policy should anything not work correctly. </s>
<s> For that matter, I would pay attention to those powerline adaptors that use AC pass-through. </s>
<s> These have an integrated AC socket which is infact filtered so as to ensure proper powerline-network throughput. </s>
<s> As well, you don't forfeit an AC outlet just because you are using it for your powerline adaptor. </s>
<s> In a few markets, most notably UK and Europe at the moment, there are powerboards that have integrated powerline-adaptor functionality thus providing the functionality of both devices in one box. </s>
