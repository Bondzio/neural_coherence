How many peripherals have you had to retire after upgrading to Windows Vista or 7? -- None at all (Lucky you!) -- One. (What were they?) -- Two. (What were they?) -- Three. (What were they?) -- Four. (Wow, that many? What were they?) -- Five. (Wow, that many? What were they?) -- Six or more. (Wow, that many? What were they?) -- I haven't upgraded. -- I don't do Windows.

The OS actually worked, and ALL my printers, scanners and everything worked as soon as I plugged it in. Even my old Canon BJC 85 portable printer. Worked perfect without downloading drivers or programming(which by the way was not available with Vista.)

Even though hardware makers said they were not going to create drivers for either 32 or 64 bit Vista, when you install the peripheral, Vista went out on the Internet and found drivers that worked just fine with them. I even installed a 10 year old Laser printer that had a regular printer input. I was able to get an adapter cable that converted from a printer cable 50 pin output to USB. I was surprised to find that Vista actually installed a printer for this old war horse of a printer. It also installed a printer than I though that I wasn't going to be able to use to work with both Vista and Windows 7. Both of those programs are very user friendly for installing printers and other peripherals that you might think would work with these new peripherals.

I have upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate (32) on my laptop and just finished building a new desktop with Windows 7 (64). Didn't have any trouble obtaining drivers for any of my peripherals, though none are older than 3 years. I might just add here that I am basically a Microsoft hater, but I think they may have finally gotten Windows right with Windows7.

Downloaded new drivers for Epson scanner and HP printer. They worked fine. However, Wacom had discontinued my digital tablet model and no driver was available. I was forced to buy a new tablet. It added around $150 to the cost of the upgrade. Annoying, but I got over it. :o/ Jim in sunny Florida

The bummer is this thing is less than a year old. I'm certain it's a driver issue, but nothing they offer helps. So it goes.

It wasn't so much replacing the scanner it was the attitude of the guy I spoke to at HP.

I didn't really care too much about the printers, but to not be able to interface my meter has been a real pain.

Also found drivers for an old Epson Scanner. The best part, I turned everything on before install and Win7 found them all, one worked with Vista 64bit driver. Even an 11 year old program that wouldn't install with Vista, works fine with Win7. Win7 the best upgrade yet.

My not so venerable t5 is not compatible with Win 7 (64) and even though I tried the bluetooth connection it was not successful. After a couple of months of this and that.. I simply dual boot - using my WIN XP partition when I have to backup or install stuff on my Palm. Eventually I will find a PDA device that does what I want with Win 7. Because of work related security issues I can't use a cell phone device so the smart phones are out... although I think the Ipod Touch will apps will handle the program requirments.. TOO BAD PALM..

Also an off brand webcam would work, but not the software or drivers for it. I could use it for Yahoo Messenger, but no adjustments could be made. Same with the New Windows 7 64 bit system. Both would work, but only partially.

But I'm disappointed with Canon, who chose to abandon their old color laser installed base by not providing 64-bit drivers. My LBP5000 still has more than 50% of its original toner, but I now need to copy files over to an old notebook if I want to print to it. A software casualty of the move to 64-bit computing was my wife's beloved PrintMaster - the replacement of which by an incompatible name-alike has left many loyal long-time users without a home DTP option - especially when Microsoft's Office Home and Student Edition doesn't include Publisher.

The manufacturers site times out when I try to reach it looking for a new driver. Various sites answer when I search but they all require their Scanning Program to be installed and with no guarantee that they actually have a driver. There is absolutely nothing else I think I can do. I have tried the 3000 and 7000 scanner drivers but they don't work. Maybe this scanner is just due to be retired Any help will be valued. M.Mcx

It seems that Canon isn't overall very fond of making new drivers for old devices. My friend had a Mulifunction printer and Canon has no Windows 7 drivers for it. 32 bit Vista drivers exist but these won't work in 64 bit machine, otherwise it would be worth a try. But my opinion is still that 64 bit is the way to go. On my second machine based on a Intel Q8200 Quad Core processor, 4 GB RAM I had XP before changing to Win 7 64 bit. It became a totally different machine, faster, smoother and very joyable.

When I made the move from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 in college I found that some of my hardware didn't work. I noticed that all of my hardware that had been sold with the Windows logo on it (WHQL Certified) worked fine. Some of the hardware I had picked up from other computer stores didn't. So after that I figured I would be better off with hardware that was WHQL Certified. When I made the move from XP to Vista all of my WHQL hardware moved over just find. Additionally my Windows Certified software all moved fine and had none of those problems with the Allow/Deny prompts that many people reported. The WHQL drivers from XP worked on Vista. Overall the transition was smooth.

Couldn't find a driver so we called HP support. The guy's attitude was clearly that they can't be bothered to support existing products more than two years old, so go buy a new printer. We bought a Canon and have been very pleased with it's quality and lower ink cost than HP. That has saved us a lot of money. Now, we've upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit and guess what? Canon had new drivers available for us, no problem. I wonder how many customers HP has blown off with their attitude?

A lot of my customers also had to replace equipment. I don't mind so much the old stuff, but some of the things that I had to replace were still new, or even pruchased after Vista came out. I think that retailers should have to make it clear that an item won't work with a current OS, or that I only works with the 32-bit version of the OS that is listed on the box.

When we got the new Vista laptop in 2008, I'd hoped its faster components, portability, and 4MB RAM would be an improvement over our 2001 1MB RAM desktop's game performance problems. Much to my chagrin after the purchase, I was warned not to try running the game on Vista. So I haven't, and it's been a real bummer, esp. since I struggled with whether to order the laptop with XP or Vista in the first place, and had waited for MS to get most of the bugs out of Vista and put plenty of RAM aboard to handle it. Otherwise, once we got used to Vista, it works fine for us, with none of the common issues people originally griped about.

My ADSL Router: It was connected to USB port and had no driver for Windows 7; neither 32-bit nor 64-bit. 2. My Sound System: It was a SoundMax integrated sound chip on my ASUS P5LD2 SE motherboard. There is only beta driver available for it that works with Windows Vista and Windows 7 but is very quirky. Windows Update immediately updates to Microsoft High-Definition Somethin' and takes away a lot of its features including recording. 3. My old IDE hard disk. This hard disk was too slow for Windows 7. My HP ScanJet 3128 also lost its enhanced driver which was not compatible with Windows 7 and is now using a basic WIA driver. I also had to retire my Diskeeper and Kaspersky Internet Security because they were incompatible with Windows 7.

Adaptec stopped supporting all SCSI cards without explanation-typical company behavior-the hell with people who have their equipment. They are now all SATA RAID all the time now. A canny business decision that damns the customer as usual. Windows 7 works okay but like all Windows OS's it eats fabulous amounts of memory and CPU during normal operation. If I try to do things like move down a page while Windows 'draws' icons on the desktop or something similar-it's Blue Screen of Death time. Not the first Windows version with this problem.

This op sys seems far more user friendly - why did they ever abandon it? - and it has brought a lot of my old software friends back into reliable use again. I am now wondering whether to abandon or downgrade (upgrade to Windows 2000 Pro?) my Compaq Windows XP machine. Currently I have not dared trying to use my HP 35mm slide scanner with anything but my very old Windows 98SE machine, with which it works like a charm. It would probably work just as well with Windows 2000 Pro, but I would be very grateful if one of your other readers can tell me if this is so before I even start trying to install the SCSI interface board.
