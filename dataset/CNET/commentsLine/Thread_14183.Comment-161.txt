lee, this has been one helluva trip down memory lane.
this is the first time responding to one of your polls, but oh how sweet to hear about these babies.
i have played with almost all of the computers mentioned: the vic 20's, atari's, ibm pcjr, packerd bell's, trs 80's; and yes i had to buy a seperate tape recorder for the programs-still have it today; the huge 5.25&quot; floppies, the green and amber screens, an old harris-something used by the airlines - gosh, now i really know my age.
i remember using the internet before the &quot;internet&quot; was a word.
at my post in central america, we would send the message then go to the john.
when we returned, the reply was scrolling slowly across the screen.
then ages later, came prodigy, a big step up from compuserve, but then you would open the page, go to the john, and return to see the page almost finished loading.
but, anyone out there had a radio shack pocket computer.
this one was a little special (circa 1982).
it looked like a pre-pda.
it really was a full computer and you programed it using basic.
it had only a 1-line lcd, but that sucker would work and we used it to do the weight & balance charts for the small commuter aircraft.
i was so proud when i wrote programs that were very practical.
and of course, i traveled with it everwhere.
it was about 6&quot; long and 3&quot; wide.
been looking through my attic but only found an ibm 80286 with the original discs.
it's really amazing how quickly the technology has changed.
those old vic 20 games seem like just yesterday... dream on... my toshiba vista notebook is calling me with a &quot;bing&quot; and makes the dell 8600 with xp seem ancient next to it ...if only they knew their origins.
once again, a really sweet trip down memory lane.
thanks again, lee
