<s> Hi, I have a GeForce 4 Ti 4600, which has served me perfectly well in its aging years. </s>
<s> I updated the drivers to the 81.89 ones, which are not the WHQL certified or whatever. </s>
<s> Consequently, the next day I recived a nasty BSOD, in which Windows kindly told me it was my Driver. </s>
<s> I uninstalled it, tried to rollback, got drivers from 2001 Driver CD; nothing. </s>
<s> The BSOD's are gone, but the computer will not or cannot go to a higher resolution and produce 32bit colors. </s>
<s> Does anyone know where I might find the older drivers from nVidia, or an archive of them. </s>
<s> I admit that I should have cancelled the installtion, but I didn't thinking it would be ok. </s>
<s> Sadly, I cannot restore the computer, either. </s>
<s> If anyone knows where to get old drivers, it be a great help. </s>

<s> http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_81.94.html You can find the archives on the left hand side of the above page. </s>
<s> Just click on windows xp/2000 archives to get to the old drivers. </s>
<s> Thanks alot, I can finally see what color my desktop is, lol. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
