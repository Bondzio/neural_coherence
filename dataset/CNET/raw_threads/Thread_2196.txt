I've got a KV8-MAX3, it had been hanging intermittently and finally wouldn't boot the other day. I popped open the case and found that the Northbridge fan had burnt out. I replaced the fan and am still having the same issue. The computer comes on, displays the Abit splash screen and just sits there. The board displays code 52 which I believe is a memory check. After close to five minutes it proceeds to a 7F and displays a screen that says CMOS checksum error, defaults loaded. Asks you to push F1 or delete. The system doesn't repsond to any key presses. I have tried clearing the cmos, replacing the battery and pulling memory modules. I'm out of ideas here! Thanks in advance!

I am not really a &quot;techie&quot; and my mobo is an8 ultra, a very plain jane. Mine had a strange boot problem, and a new power supply fixed it.I see that official support from ABIT is the same as nothing, but you might try (if you have access to a computer that will get online) GOOGLE ABIT KV8-MAX3 . Much information there, I didn't read it all, but you might get some clue. If you get it fixed, please post back and let us know what works

I thought I had everyhting disconnected but what i thought was my mouse actually was an external usb hub. The computer will not boot when the Nano is hooked up. I've seen some othe rpeople have had this problem as well. Bizarre symptoms, I was very close to buying a new board..

I had an MSI motherboard with an Athlon 64 3000 CPU and it would hang on boot when it started the IDE detection process. Turned out to be a failing/defective CD-DVD drive. Once I disconnected the defective CD-DVD...it booted and worked flawlessly. Ergo the reason it's so important to disconnect (not remove) periperhals when troubleshooting PCs that won't post or boot.
