i ordered a new monitor for my 2.5yr old pc.
the monitor is a wide-screen with resolution of 1680x1050.
i looked at my video card and it does not have this as a res (likley since wide-screens were not being offered at the time).
i downloaded an updated driver but it still does not support that resolution (i also made sure to show all resolutions, not just the ones supported by my current monitor).
so i guess i need a new video card and i am trying to figure which to buy.
i currently have the nvidea geforce4 mx 440 with agp 8x.
i mainly use the pc for photo editing, not really for games (the only game played is sims2 occasionaly).
i've looked at some cards but they were close to $200 which is more than i would like to spend, would rather put it towards a new pc is i were going to spend that.
any advice on which to purchase, which brand is good, and what i need to know when purchasing a graphics card????
also, the new monitor is both digital and analog.
my current monitor is only analog, and that is the only way it connects to the pc.
if i buy a new video card, would it allows to use either analog or video, or is that dependent on another factor.
basically i am cluseless with video cards as i've never had to upgrade or replace it.
thanks for the help...
