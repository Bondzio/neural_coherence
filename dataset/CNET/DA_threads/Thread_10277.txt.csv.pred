1.1.1	My CD-ROM Drive only reads DVD cd's...	St
1.1.2	I can't play anything but DVD's... How can I solve this problem...	St
1.1.3	Please help me... eddyespina9@yahoo.com	Sug
1.2.1	But with no mention of any operating system it would be too much for me to supply fixes for Apple, Linux, Windows and the many Windows there are.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	First off, allow me to say, you invite spam if you place your full email here and any other forum, so use caution.	St
1.3.2	Next, check under the system mgr.	Sug
1.3.3	and see if any &quot;?&quot; is next to the line item for CD drives.	St
1.3.4	If yes, check to see if any error # is present.	St
1.3.5	If yes again, then look-up by googling for what that error # is and what it means.	St
1.3.6	You can then proceed to fix by googling further for known fixes on such an error #.	St
1.3.7	Otherwise, since you offered no info on CD make, OS, etc., you pretty leave us in the dark.	St
1.3.8	tada -----Willy	St
