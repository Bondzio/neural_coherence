<s> I just got a new laptop with Vista home installed and need to know if I need to install the Vista printer driver on it to be able to use my Dell aoi 962 printer which is connected to my decktop running XP with all updates. </s>
<s> My last setup I had XP on both my desktop and laptop and I downloaded the printer driver from the desktop to the laptop. </s>
<s> I do not know if the XP driver will work with Vista. </s>
<s> Dell has a Vista driver on their web site for this printer, just need to know if I need to download this driver and install it before trying to share this printer across the network. </s>
<s> I have three systems one with 98se, XP which is the main system and the laptop (do not print from the 98 system, only used for grandkids games). </s>
<s> All systems are able to see and transfer files to each other. </s>
<s> Thanks swijo </s>
<s> is to go to Drivers and Downloads Select model choose printer printer again now find your printer download and install the Vista Utilities and patches for your Vista machine. </s>
<s> You only need to do this for your Vista machine. </s>
<s> If I'm reading this correctly, your printer is hooked to the XP machine. </s>
<s> Also read the information on Printer Sharing and many other items that may apply, there are 2 pages, at our Forum Sticky . </s>
<s> If you still cannot do all your functions, You may want to consider fixing your network first, like the forum sticky suggests. </s>
<s> Unsure if you'll need to use the Vista patch on the XP machine, if any. </s>
