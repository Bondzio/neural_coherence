i find it reasonable before attempting anything with a dell as in upgrades to be sure of the bios level.
more often that not, there can be quite a difference.
so, if you check and find a06 present and a11 available, do upgrade the bios and correctly follow instructions.
next, exactly what are your dell specs for your model# plus its sn# or use the service tag# to truly id the product.
in other words don't settle for the dell badge, know exactly what you have.
then review the specs of your model# found.
the info can vary if an user simply accepts model# across the board does this and that and the model# can vary as model# -a is different from model# -d even though both are dell model123.
there can be a major difference, so be 100% sure.
i would for testing, disable or remove the virtual clonedrive.
upgrade the bios, and verify your gx520 actually can use 2gb ram per slot.
also ram is best as in matched pairs.
yes, win7x64 can use above 4gb and/or can the intel p4(single core) really keep-up, if i suspect all of what your doing is pushing the cpu to its limits.
it maybe a &quot;bottleneck&quot; sort of problem.
