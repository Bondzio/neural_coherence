<s> So i over clocked my AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2Ghz to 2.46Ghz and when i use my computer for any reason sometimes its 5 minutes sometimes more i get a Blue Screen that says something about hardware i've never finished it but after it i turned it down to 2.25Ghz and i dont get it anymore. </s>
<s> Is this hardware, software, maybe not enough cooling? </s>
<s> Please help </s>
<s> When you OC, you're pushing things. </s>
<s> You have to find a happy medium and then it'll settle down. </s>
<s> Cooling is very important as well as adding a slight voltage increase for the cpu to be OC'ed. </s>
<s> This is a go or no go process, until you finally get there. </s>
<s> As you increase cpu voltage then cooling even in a default system is critial it becomes even more so with an OC'ed one. </s>
<s> So you take your chances as it wre. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Alright Thanks, guess I'll get a new better Heat sink and fan cause i'm currently the stock </s>
