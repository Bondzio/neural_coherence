After hours on the phone with Linksys, they tell me that contrary to what Best Buy told me, I cannot use the Print Server on a Multi Function Printer. Even if they could help me get it working, to use their product, they tell me I'd have to plug and unplug the print server when I want to use anything other than the printer.

Unfortunately, these fancy-dancy multifunction printers cannot be attached to a print server and still retain any functions except plain ol' printing. Sorry. If you want those extra functions, they only work when the device is connected directly to a host computer. dw

But since my current printer isn;t that old and I love it, I can't see spending $359 for the later model. Thanks all who wrote here.

Perhaps they are getting better, but still not ready for prime time. That said, if you have a network and use different machines in various places around the house, printers on a server sure is a good idea. You don't have to leave the host machine on just to use the printer. You don't need a printer for every machine. In your case, perhaps you might leave the multifunction printer hooked up to a host computer for those times when you need all its features or capacity, but get a small quick printer that can sit out there somewhere on a print server for just when its needed. dw

Thanks. I can stop obsessing on this and now start trying to figure out why Windows Taks Manager says I have 60 processes running! (I think a higher priority problem:))
