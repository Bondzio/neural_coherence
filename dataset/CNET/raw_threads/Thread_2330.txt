If you live in the U.S. Might as well gety a good 450 Watt unit. The main possible issue is with the D----d proprietary case that the HP uses. You need to be certain that the new supply will fit. HP uses the standard ATX interface, but in some older ones the PS had a special size and shape. The standard ATX PS mounts to the case using four screws. One screw is not in the rectangular pattern so that there is only one way to mount the supply and then if it has multiple fans they are located properly.

If you enable email in your profile, I'll gladly send you my email address to be able to communicate via email. Meanwhile I'll go to the HP website to see if they have a picture of the tower.
7995	5	118792	1347730	1347604	Ray Harinec	8/8/05 11:12 AM	1.12349952E12	Here's a link to HP	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/manualCategory?product=424215&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&lang=en&cc=us On that page click to see the &quot;Parts replacement manual&quot;. From what I can see it appears that the Power Supply uses the standard mounting.

I Every time that I go to the HP site to try to help someone, the more that I am impressed by the info that they provide.
7995	7	118792	1347756	1347738	Unknown	8/8/05 11:30 AM	1.1235006E12	lol where u find the pic	where u find the pic of my mobo in the HP site. So the PSU i should get is wit the 4 pin connector? What psu u think is good cuz im gona soon run a Geforce 6600GT agp card in there soon. =D
7995	8	118792	1347758	1347604	Ray Harinec	8/8/05 11:31 AM	1.12350066E12	There are two approaches to buying	an adequate power Power Supply. Robert Proffitt tends to link to computergeeks and such sites, and buy inexpensive supplies with wattage ratings far higher than needed. Thus even if it may not be able to actually supply the rated power, it will certainly have enough margin to meet the actual needs. I simply go to newegg and pick a quality supply and pay the price. No need to pay for the really top line supplies. I use them only if building a new computer, just to have the new features such as separate pluggable cables and dual 12 volt rails. You don't need either. You can also find a supply you like at newegg and then search for a better price. I don't because newegg's price is usually close to the lowest, their shipping is low and delivery is really great. Also pick a few of the supplies there that you like and then watch for a few days. Usually one of them will appear as a special with free shipping. I would expect you to find a good oneunder $60 at newegg, possibly as low as $35.

Your mobo uses the 20 pin power connector. I didn't check these to be sure that they had the 20 pin connector.

BUt the more memory wit the same speed will make my comp faster rite? can u give me some links from newegg too lol. Tyvm. i gotta go to football prac ill b bac later to check on forum =D
7995	16	118792	1347897	1347875	Ray Harinec	8/8/05 12:42 PM	1.12350492E12	The addition of memory is	your choice and pocketbook. Looks as if each slot will take 1 GB. Not sure what the note about the memory in the HP info means. Probably with a total of 1 MB, you'll be at the limit of noticing any real speed increase by increasing memory. The CPU and PC 2700 limits your FSB, so you can't run at 400 MJz FSB. You might want to double check me on that.

Using two monitors one analog and one DVI so I got the lowest priced card that had both outputs. Think it is an MX400 which is a value model. I see in your other thread that you have inputs from John Robie. He is a very knowlegeable guy. Also ozos has much knowledge regarding video cards.
7995	19	118792	1348152	1347931	Ray Harinec	8/8/05 2:34 PM	1.12351164E12	I mentioned earlier that Micron	is the memory that Crucial sells mostly. Normally they sell CAS 3, sometimes 2.5. Not familiar with the info for an empty slot. It seems to imply that for PC2700 [166 MHz] it will not support CAS lower than 2.5. However CAS 2.0 memory will clock just fine at 2.5. If the memory's SPD chip tries to force CAS 2 timing simply disable &quot;by SPD&quot; and set it to the same speed [CAS]as the memory in slot 1.
7995	20	118792	1348168	1347931	Ray Harinec	8/8/05 2:41 PM	1.12351206E12	You mentioned earlier about	getting an additional PC 2700 stick. Thus I assumed [yes I know] that you only had PC 2700 memory. Seems that the report indicates that you have PC 3200 [DDR400]. Before you buy anything we need to know exactly which CPU you have. The problem is that AMD has three CPU's that they called 3200+. Does the CPUID info give anymore info regarding the CPU???
7995	21	118792	1348226	1347604	Ray Harinec	8/8/05 3:12 PM	1.12351392E12	It is beginning to look as if	HP has used a mobo that does not support the full capability of the CPU. At HP's ite they have a way that you can connect a tech support guy [probably something like AIM]. Maybe try that and get clarification on what the exact capability that your CPU and mobo have. They can look into your computer to get the data, that's why I can't do it from here. The problem is that the best AMD3200+ athlon [not the 64] supports PC3200, Dual Channel memory and 400 MHz FSB, but the mobo seems to not support it.
7995	22	118792	1348254	1348226	Ray Harinec	8/8/05 3:21 PM	1.12351446E12	On the HP site for your mobo it does say	motherboard specifications subject to change without notice. I hope yours was changed for the better. Best way is to use the HP tech support chat. Let us know when you get the correct answers.
7995	23	118792	1349166	1347604	Unknown	8/9/05 7:58 AM	1.12357428E12	ima make a new thread for memory	ima make a new memory discussion so it wont say anything bout PSU when they come to check.
