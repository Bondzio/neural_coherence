1.1.1	I have an external Hard Disk (internal disk converted to external by means of an enclosure).	St
1.1.2	It is connected to my computer through USB 2.0.	St
1.1.3	Because my internal hard diak already runs-out of disk space, I plan to install programs, applications and games to it.	St
1.1.4	Is it possible or it's the same in terms of performance as an internal drive?	St
1.1.5	Because I think external hard disk is only used for saving files (documents, pictures, music and videos) or for back-up purposes.	St
1.1.6	Thanks in advance!	St
1.2.1	Most programs allow install on any drive.	St
1.2.2	So, in principle, it's yes.	St
1.2.3	But it's slower.	St
1.2.4	And it's less reliable.	St
1.2.5	Your choice.	St
1.2.6	Alternatives: - clean unnecessary files from your internal hard disk - install a second internal disk (not possible with a laptop, alas) - install a bigger internal disk than you have now - store other files on your external (but DON'T FORGET THE BACKUP!)	St
1.2.7	in stead of these programs Kees	St
