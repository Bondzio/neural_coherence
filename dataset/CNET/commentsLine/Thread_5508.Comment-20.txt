isnt the whole point of having an external hard drive to have a place to store and access your data, music, documents, text files, photos etc so you can keep them safe from computer problems, crashes etc, and be able to access all that important stuff by simply attaching and accessing the external hard drive??
if that's not the case then i and most people i know must have completely the wrong idea about what an external hard drive is for..
