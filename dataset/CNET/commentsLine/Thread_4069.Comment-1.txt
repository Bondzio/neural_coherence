i am having problems with my microphone, i can hear sound coming from the speakers, however, when i try to use my mic (record or on the web), i can't.
i have tried to use the sound trouble shooter, but it doesn't help because i can't use the mic.
i have also changed mics and tested both mics on other pc's.
