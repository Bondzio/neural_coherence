I definitely want a 5:4 aspect ratio, not a wide screen. I am looking at three Hanns G comparable 19 inch models. The differences seem so minor that I can't make out what is significant. Models are JC199APD, HH191DPB, and HX191DPB.

I tried to add the link here, but o luck. I just copied it. http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/?filter=1000036_13686276_100021_10061970_500166_5101600_&tag=mnco

DHCP helps too. For me this model is a NO SALE since these are not the current technology of WIDE SCREEN. Because of my work I must get the new displays that you see today or my software efforts would be hampered by using the older displays. I'm sure you have a reason for this choice. Bob

Graphics capabilities is not my primary concern. I realize everything has moved to wide screen format. perharps there are some disadvantages that I don't understand. I welcome your thoughts on this.

I picked up the swivel model as you see at http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=desktop2.jpg If I didn't swivel that then maybe 2 docs side by side? All personal choice there. Bob
