no real good reason....just trying to work this out.
now if the default ip address of the switch is 10.90.90.90; should i use that as the gateway and dns address.
also, should i use ip's in the range of say 10.90.90.
* if so, should the subnet be 255.0.0.0 ??
i seem to have just enough knowlege to have gotten myself into troube here and can't seem to get out.
thanks for the help, mike
