1.1.1	I 'm planning on buying a new laptop soon since my current HP ZT3000 's monitor does not work properly ( works 1/50 times the laptop is turned on ) so it 's constantly hooked to an external and ... well , no longer a laptop ( costs around $ 600 to have it fixed by buying a new motherboard ) .	St
1.1.2	I remember when I bought a desktop 6 years ago I went with an AMD because they were generally cheaper than the pentiums , and performance-wise they were almost the same .	St
1.1.3	With all this new intel dual-core , Inter core duo and AMD dual-core , I 'm kinda lost now .	St
1.1.4	What 's the best option out there ?	Ques
1.2.1	What metric do you use to determine & quot ; best & quot ; ?	Ques
1.2.2	If it is performance then the Core 2 Duo would be the winner while if it is bang for the buck then it may vary a bit .	St
1.2.3	I would suggest a dual core laptop , e.g .	Sug
1.2.4	Intel Core Duo , Core 2 Duo ( which is the successor to Core Duo ) or AMD Turion 64 x2 , if you do any CPU-intensive tasks .	St
1.2.5	I would likely stay away from Celeron or Sempron laptops unless you do n't mind having a low power processor as these are for low-end systems which is n't the same as saying they use less electricity .	St
1.2.6	Regards , JB	St
1.3.1	definitely go with a dual core laptop .	Sug
1.3.2	there are 3 main flavors : intel core duo , intel core 2 duo , and amd turion 64 x2 .	St
1.3.3	sometimes you 'll see & quot ; pentium dual core & quot ; which is really a core duo .	St
1.3.4	the turion 64 x2s are about as fast as a core duo at the same processor speed ( GHz ) ; core 2 duo is about 12 % faster at the same processor speed .	St
