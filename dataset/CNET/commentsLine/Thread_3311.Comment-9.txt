hmm k, i'll have a look at that... and yea i am still using the phone line for net access for a coupel reasons actually... 1 i'm too cheap to justify $40 a month when i'm paying $10 now, and 2 other than satilite which is $70 a month no high speed alternative is available where i live so i'm out of luck anyway.
so anyhow this would be pretty strictly gaming and jukebox type of comp so would the 3400 be the best move with a mid board to work with it?
this given of course a gig of ddr400 and a 6800gt...
