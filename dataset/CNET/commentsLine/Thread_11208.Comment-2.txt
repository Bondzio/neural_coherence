&quot;emachines sells a small selection of monitors, and it included its new e15t4 lcd with our t6212 test system.
the 15-inch flat panel provides a crisp, bright image and costs only $199 (after a $50 mail-in rebate).
busy multitaskers might find the screen too small for daily use, but it's a great buy for a budget machine you spend time with only occasionally.&quot; from the t6212 review personally, i have emachines old monitor the e15t3 which is the same size as the new one.
i have sampled wide-screen and full-screen dvds.
the overall picture is pretty good but the screen is alittle small for watching movies in my opinion.
if you plan on watching dvds alot i would get a larger monitor, but it would work.
