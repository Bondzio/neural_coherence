First ask yourself; 1-Is there anything wrong with my current picture?
(too grainy, jerky, pixelated), 2-How much do I want to spend?
A $100-$300 AGP won't give you $100-$300 worth of improvement.
If you want a good card it'll cost you a quite a bit and seeing as you don't play games, this is probably an unnecessary expenditure for you.
Even so, if money isn't an issue, sure go ahead.
Happy viewing
