<s> I just purchased a Kensington 33085 USB bluetooth adapter off ebay. </s>
<s> The drivers are ONLY for XP, so how am I supposed to install this POS on 64 bit Vista? </s>
<s> I'm lost... </s>
<s> Did you go to http://us.kensington.com/html/1492.html and download Kensington Bluetooth USB Adapter 2.0 (Rev. </s>
<s> 5.1.0.1700 and Rev. </s>
<s> 6.0.1.5100) ? </s>
<s> This is a 30 day trial. </s>
<s> How do I go around that? </s>
<s> It works now, but it wont in 30 days. </s>
<s> Any others that are free/no trials? </s>
<s> If you think they are, please get your money back. </s>
<s> The Toshiba bluetooth managaer says it is only a 30 day trial. </s>
<s> So yes, the drivers will still work after 30 days, but how do I transfer files without a manager/file transfer app? </s>
<s> I must be missing something... All I want to do I transfer files between my cell phone. </s>
<s> I'm thinking the USB cord is faster and more efficient... </s>
<s> You want to buy a dongle that comes with all things Vista. </s>
<s> Here I didn't install the &quot;manager&quot; but use Vista's native Bluetooth manager. </s>
<s> Sorry but I don't duplicate web content or help content included with the OS. </s>
<s> I only fill in the hard to find items. </s>

<s> I'm not stupid... </s>
<s> I have a Dell Studio 540 I purchased recently, and it's running 64 bit Vista Premium. </s>
<s> When I go to control panal/hardware and sound, all I get is Bluetooth Local COM, which is NOT a bluetooth wizard, just a list of COM ports. </s>
<s> If I search for bluetooth wizard, I get no result. </s>
<s> It is also not in the accessories file like everyone says. </s>
<s> When I run fsquirt.exe, I get an error saying windows cannot find it. </s>
<s> How do I not have the wizard/where can I get it? </s>
<s> If not, you ask Dell where they hid it. </s>
<s> That is, if they supplied the OEM version of the OS. </s>
