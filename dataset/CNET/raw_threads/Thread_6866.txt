I use it primarily on my laptop, a Dell Latitude d610. Now, I started having problems when I tried to access certain folders in the drive. I would double-click them, and My Computer (I sound like an idiot, but whatever you call the thing you browse your hard drive with) froze up. This happened repeatedly and consistently. I was told to run a disk check (chkdsk or whatever), and many sections were found to be 'unreadable.' Finally, I formatted the entire hard drive, since I couldn't access anything on there anyway. Now, at least from some initial testing, it seems to work fine. However, I barely have anything on it at the moment, so the problem could still be there. Anyone know what is going on? I'm kind of a newb, so feel free to remind me if I've forgotten to include anything.

Proffitt	6/19/07 6:16 PM	1.18227696E12	&quot;Anyone know what is going on?&quot; = No.	Sorry but with so little clues I have to write the drive is dying or you don't backup your files. External hard disks are fine copies but not a backup!
