1.1.1	Since you have your SSD installed has it lived up to your expectations ?	Ques
1.1.2	Does it do what you want or do you find it lacking or even more troublesome than a std .	St
1.1.3	HD ?	Ques
1.1.4	Since , these have been out for some time and early problems resolved ( I think ) just are your thoughts on that ?	Ques
1.1.5	I like to exclude any costs here , just your real PC experiences .	St
1.1.6	thanks -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.2.1	Was n't looking for the fastest around but just better boot , program launch , software updates , utilities execution and shutdown times vs. HDDs .	St
1.2.2	Got all handily and never bothered with benchmarking .	St
1.2.3	Have them in dt and notebooks .	St
1.2.4	No problems if FW is good .	St
1.2.5	Unfortunately not all mfrs support their SSDs with up-to-date FW and that has given SSDs a bad rap .	St
1.2.6	User reviews will point out the brands that satisfy more than others .	St
1.2.7	Not worried about longevity ; 3 yr warranties cover me with replacements should they die prematurely and I have system image backups , in case .	St
1.2.8	After 3 yrs who cares , it 's time for a new machine anyways ; small businesses feel differently , but they should n't because it 's a bad decision to stall due to HW wearouts .	St
1.2.9	Do n't & quot ; store & quot ; data on system drives , be they HDDs or SSDs .	St
1.2.10	Therefore only buy SSD up to capacity necessary for OS and apps to save money and heartaches .	St
1.3.1	It seems to be a little faster but nothing to brag about .	St
1.3.2	But the price has come down abit ... which is a good thing .	St
1.3.3	I bought mine for $ 80/120GB to see just what it 's like .	St
