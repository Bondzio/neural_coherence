<s> My router is old and runs on 802.11b while my new laptop has the 802.11g inbuilt wireless card. </s>
<s> Would changing the router to 802.11g significantly improve my internet speed (I subscribe to the DSL) </s>
<s> Your internet speed is controlled by your internet service provider. </s>
<s> You would see no difference. </s>
<s> Your internet speed will be the same. </s>
<s> If you have more than 1 computer on the router and share files between them your speed will increase dramatically. </s>
<s> 802.11b runs at 11 mbs and 802.11g runs at 54 mbs or 108 mbs depending on which 1 you buy. </s>
<s> A new router may provide better wireless security. </s>
<s> If you decide to upgrade look at your laptop specs to see if it is a 54 mbs or a 108 mbs wireless connection. </s>
<s> You may use either 1 no matter what you decide. </s>
<s> goodluck </s>
