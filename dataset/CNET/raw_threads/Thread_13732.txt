5356	0	566907	5329755	NR	Exilium	6/30/12 9:25 PM	1.3410915E12	Is this a good gaming pc build for under $1250	I want to build my computer for the first time. I have done a good amount of research on what GPU's and CPU's are good for gaming. I want this machine to last me at least 5 years. I was wondering what you guys think of this build and if there are any changes you think I should make to it, or anything I may be missing. Thanks ahead of time! (my budget is $1200) Case- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6811129042 HDD(500GB 7200RPM)- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6822136769 GPU (GTX 670 EVGA)- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130782 DVD-drive(Sony SATA DVD drive 18x)- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6827118031 Power Supply(800w Corsair)- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6817139025 RAM(8GB G.Skill Ripjaws)- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6820231428 Motherboard- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6813131821 CPU(Intel i7 2600k sandy bridge 3.4Ghz)- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6819115070 Cooling fans- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Prod [...] 6835150007 Thanks again!
