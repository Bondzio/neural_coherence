Is there a way, via hardware or software, to make two 750G hard drives act as one 1.5T drive? I just bought both of these recently and have already outgrown each as an individual drive. I need more storage for my iTunes library. I have already researched splitting my library and found that it is not the best solution for me. Thanks.

Some of these even allow connection to USB devices that allow for more growth. You must have some massive music library. At some point, I'd think, to be able to listen to every recording exceeds one's life expectancy.
