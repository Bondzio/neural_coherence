but as presented it's just windows 7 64 bit and after we install that, we get to install the drivers or some things don't work.
i can't tell from the post so far what's different in the two connections so i can't make a guess yet.
but the story is typical so my first guess is just an incomplete windows setup.
there are shops that build pcs and they get a few different types of clients.
the un-fun one is the &quot;clean install&quot; client.
it's not fun when they get after you for installing an app to turn on the wifi so you get to show them it doesn't work without it then you descend into the conversation about &quot;then you must have the wrong driver.&quot; well (and it's a deep one) that can lead to shops that toss on the barest of installs and leave the fine tuning to the end user.
