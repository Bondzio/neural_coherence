the new 1tb hd is made by someone.
if wd or seagate, they provide s/w to help install and prepare and others provide similar(i assume).
that should include any partitioning s/w as well.
just be darn sure you are addressing that new hd.
once only the partitioning is done you can access it for linux as it should see a prepared hd awaiting use and direct the linux there.
i'm unsure if gparted is capable under win8 use but it has provided partitioning setups for prior oses.
before you attempt anything, be sure you have a working back-up or recovery discs made in order to restore you current setup, just in case.
