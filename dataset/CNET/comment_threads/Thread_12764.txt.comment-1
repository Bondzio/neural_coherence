Hi -- I'm having some real problems with my Soundblaster PCI128 - I had problems installing it initially, and it was all down to the PCI Legacy Device that it was trying to install.
Eventually, it just didn't install the device, and, since I don't use it, it wasn't missed.
I rejigged the guts of my PC yesterday, and moved the soundcard to a different PCI slot.
It redetected on Windows load, and it locks up -mouse, keyboard - everything - as soon as it detects the 'Soundblaster PCI128 Legact device' - I've removed all references in Device manager and rebooted - same problem.
Any ideas?
