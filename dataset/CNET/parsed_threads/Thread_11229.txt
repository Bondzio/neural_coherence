<s> I really need help. </s>
<s> My computer hasn't been working right since Christmas. </s>
<s> At random times, the computer will just restart itself. </s>
<s> It can be when using Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, running a virus scan or whatever. </s>
<s> Also, whenever I play a game, it lets me play for awhile but then it closes the game. </s>
<s> It doesn't even give any error. </s>
<s> I called FutureShop to ask about this and the guy said it was a memory problem, which made sense because I got more RAM for Christmas. </s>
<s> To solve this, I brought that back and got a new 512 RAM. </s>
<s> The problem is still happening. </s>
<s> I have scanned my computer with AdAware SE, Spybot Search and Destroy, AVG Anti-Virus, Norton Anti-Virus and Armor2net and haven't found any problems. </s>
<s> My specs are: AMD Athlon XP 2200+ Ultra DMA 80 GB Hard Drive Kingston DDR PC3200 512mb RAM 256mb RAM (don't no specs-came with computer) Nvidia GeForce XFX video card (128mb) stock motherboard (not sure company) Windows XP (with Service Pack 2) I have heard some people talking about doing a memetest or something for the RAM but I don't know where to find it. </s>
<s> I have also heard about updating the BIOS but don't know where to find it either. </s>
<s> I have had this computer since summer 2003 and it was working fine up until 2 weeks ago. </s>

<s> Everything I have on here is completely replaceable I think. </s>
<s> Wat about Windows Service Pack 2?? </s>
<s> Do I have to get that again or something?? </s>

<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> I have read thru wat u said but I was also reading the booklet that came with the computer and it basically guides you through this whole thing and it looks pretty easy. </s>
<s> It is also based on Windows XP so I think it will work. </s>
<s> I see what you are saying and putting links to but I don't completely understand what you mean because I want everything to be wiped off this computer. </s>
<s> All the drivers and stuff that I need are on the restore disk so it isn't a big deal. </s>
<s> I also have the disks for everything else I have installed so I am not worried there. </s>
<s> Anyway, can you just explain to me what you are talking about in the easiest terms possible. </s>
<s> I was reading in the user manual that on the back of my computer, there are 2 choices for the voltage the computer is running on, 115 volts or 230 volts. </s>
<s> How do I know which one my computer is supposed to be running on? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> In your prior posts you didn't reveal that restore CDs would do this. </s>
<s> Many don't have such, format the machine and end up having to pay someone to install the OS, drivers and more. </s>
<s> If you have good restore CDs, it can be simple. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> sorry bout that, I didn't no it either and I just assumed all did. </s>
<s> I just read it before I posted it. </s>
<s> So, just to verify, since my restore disc has the OS and drivers on it, I can just do the reformat without having to do all that other stuff that was in the links. </s>
<s> I actually do want to back 1 thing up, Nero. </s>
<s> How would I back this up on a disc. </s>
<s> Just burn the whole thing on there or just parts of it. </s>
<s> It is a downloaded ISO version. </s>
<s> I just have a simple question. </s>
<s> Do you expect help with pirated software? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I figured it out myself. </s>
<s> My PIRATED Nero has a backup option so I am backing up my important stuff rite now. </s>
<s> Lol. </s>
<s> I am not trying to be mean here. </s>
<s> I am just joking around with u Bob. </s>
<s> Thanx for all the help man. </s>
<s> I take a dim view of piracy. </s>
<s> Period. </s>
<s> If you want your discussions to be locked, just cross that line. </s>
<s> Got it? </s>

<s> sorry, I didn't know u thought that way. </s>

<s> I tested how my computer would run with only the original RAM installed and it has worked without problems for the last 45 minutes with 35 of those being in Counter Strike Source. </s>
<s> It never restarted and never closed the game. </s>
<s> I am now gonna try to do the same thing with the 512 chip and see what happens. </s>
<s> Just as a test, I used the stock RAM and the 512 RAM by themselevs and for both, the computer has never shut down or a game closed. </s>
<s> I think it is because the MHz difference. </s>
<s> The crap stock 256 RAM is 266 MHZ and the good $150 Kingston 512 RAM is 400 MHz so now I will just leave the 512 in until I buy another one. </s>
