finished a machine this pm., MSI K7T266 pro-2 MB, 256 memory,DDR.
standard (pulls) cd-rom and floppy.
CPU is AMD 1800, MSI page said it is compatible.
Kicked the power up, and monitor wont show signs of life beyound recieving power.
I changed out video cards, get the same.
I think it could be problem in ROM memory, but what should i be checking first..?
