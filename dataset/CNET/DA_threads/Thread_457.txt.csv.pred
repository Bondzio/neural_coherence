1.1.5	) , after the power comes back on the wireless connection on my laptop says the signal is there but it does n't actually work .	St
1.1.6	I have to recycle the modem/routers one at a time in wired order to get things back to normal .	St

1.2.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? threadID=345085 & tag=forums06 ; forum-threads At this point you should look at the smallest UPS units you can find for those parts .	St
1.2.2	Since we are looking at such small power usage , the UPS may be the cheap cure .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	it 's all part of the same reworking of the wifi setup but the power failure i thoguht was a different subject/ quesiotn , hope that is ok. i will look into the ups , maybe there is a small one for those 3 itmes - fj	St
1.4.1	Yes there are power sequencers like http : //www.fullcompass.com/product/276661.html but an UPS is cheap .	St
1.4.2	And here is cheaper than new routers or modems .	St
