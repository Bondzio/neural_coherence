<s> I'm in the market for a new desktop and would like some advice on making the right selection. </s>
<s> My primary use is for viewing and editing photos using Photoshop. </s>
<s> I plan on upgrading to the most current edition of Photoshop along with the purchase of the desktop. </s>
<s> I won't be upgrading my monitor. </s>
<s> Could you make some recomendations as far as system requirements to help me select a system? </s>
<s> I have a HP computer with AMD 4200 duel core processor and 2 gig of ram. </s>
<s> I am using Photoshop CS2 and that combination seems to work great. </s>
<s> After I bought the computer I added the 2nd gig of ram and a 256mg video card and did see better performance. </s>
<s> I also do video editing through the firewire port and so far nothing seems to slow it down. </s>
<s> The graphics forum on CNET has a lot of good information so you might check there. </s>
<s> Most any new system today would probably work out for what you are looking to do - the biggest factor may be price. </s>
<s> If you are looking for a system with good performance you should be able to find multiple choices for around $500-600 that would come with the complete system, a 19&quot; flat panel monitor, and a basic printer. </s>
<s> I would start with the major OEMs such as Dell, HP/Compaq, or Sony and see what you can configure as your best price. </s>
<s> Don't hesitate to call them and see if they can improve the deal as well - they often have unadvertised specials and incentives that can get you a great system at a great price. </s>
<s> If you are looking for something specific or a certain brand and would like some more help or have other questions post back and I'll see what I can do. </s>
