<s> I' getting a new pc and i was wondering what is the best processor/ graphic card combination is? </s>
<s> i've got a NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTX w/ 768MB card and a Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6600 (2.40GHz) and 2 gbs of ram , will this all work good together? </s>

<s> See how yours fared. </s>

<s> Sweet, the cards is being called the fastest, but will it work smoothly with the processor and ram, i also have a 700watt power supply </s>
<s> It seems you have a pretty good system. </s>
<s> I don't foresee any major conflicts. </s>
<s> I do however suggest you look into the PSU(power supply) side as that will strongly determine the uptime of this system as it will sustain heavy power demands. </s>
<s> You should look for a SLI certified PSU and/or of least 500W or better and cheap is cheap(not good). </s>
<s> The better PSUs are into the $150+ range and there's a reason for that as for similar wattage units costs less *may not* maintain their wattage output for long under heavy demands and/or build-up systems with all the goodies. </s>
<s> If you don't have problems within 30-90days but do later get flaky issues, consider the PSU at fault, excluding s/w issues. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Hope this answers your question. </s>
<s> at this time. </s>
<s> As noted don't forget about the psu. </s>
<s> If you want to go SLI figure 750-1000w. </s>
