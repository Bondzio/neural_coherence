<s> Hello guys, I need help, i'm buying a new computer for myself and i have a choice of buying a HP XW4100 or HP6000, the difference in price is only $100. </s>
<s> HP XW4100 Specs: 3 GHz Pen 4, 1GB Ram, 80GB HDD, 128MB Vid HP XW6000 Specs: 3.06GHZ Pen XEON, 1 GB RAM, 40GB HDD, 128MB Vid I'm a student, use photoshop at times, like to play games, no heavy video editing... What would you suggest me to buy? </s>
<s> Again the price difference is $100 does it worth it? </s>
<s> What is the main difference in between Pentium 4 and Xeon? </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> i'm a broke college student so 100 bucks does matter. </s>
<s> Prices are: HP XW4100 $350 HP XW6000 $450 Cheap eh? </s>
<s> Please Help me to decide. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> i just don't know what is the difference between the two? </s>
<s> seems like all the specs are the same except one is xeon and the other is p4 (with more HDD space)? </s>
<s> and yes i'm on a VERY tight budget... but if its worth i will buy it. </s>
<s> What is the advantage of Xeon over P4 (i researched and found out that it is originally made for servers, and dual workstation etc but what is so special about them)? </s>
<s> Will i really need a Xeon based pc? </s>
<s> Can someone please help me? </s>
<s> Hm.. </s>
<s> I believe you can customize the PC's as you wish, so you can upgrade or downgrade the hardrives. </s>
<s> OK, Xeons have a few thingys that make them alot more apt to be used for multiple procssor motherboards. </s>
<s> NOT DUALCORE: TWO PHYSICAL PROCESSORS! </s>
<s> the features inclued some faster memory capabilites, bigger cache, and few security things... </s>
<s> These are usually meant for the servers,as you know, but I can't give a perfect apple to apple compairson... </s>
<s> I have P4 2.8GHz at home, and a Server running TWO physical Xeon processors at 3.00GHz. </s>
<s> The server, is of course faster for many reasons, but its hard to compare those two processors. </s>
<s> Features of Xeon that P4 doesn't have, well, back then: error checking memory, system management features and fast system buses and L2 caches, can hold up to 64GB of memory, tons of management stuff, Hope that helped... -Ibrahim </s>
<s> Hi, thanks for clarification... i was researching a lot and came to a conclusion that for my needs the P4 will be a better choice. </s>
<s> First treason is that the Buss speed is higher than Xeons (800Mhz compared to 533)the memory is supposed to be better (dual channel), the hard drive is bigger (160GB compared to 36.4 but 10K PRM), and ofcourse the price tag is lower. </s>
<s> So i'm gonna go with XW4100. </s>
<s> But thanks again -Ibrahim. </s>
