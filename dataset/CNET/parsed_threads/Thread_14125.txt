<s> Hey, Folks, I posted earlier, re. </s>
<s> whether or not to purchase a custom tower. </s>
<s> After receiving a &quot;Yes--with reservations&quot; and making some changes with the builder, I purchased the tower. </s>
<s> Only to immediately have problems with what I thought was the NVidia Graphics Card: upon installing the drivers, it would constantly quit, then restart, then, finally, freeze or blue screen the computer. </s>
<s> I posted a second time, here and elsewhere, with the specs of the adjusted build, and again received advice from several sources, advising that the PSU, a Raidmax 500-watt Power Supply (which in fact turned out to be a 450W PSU) might well be the problem. </s>
<s> Okay, actually, it was pretty universally hated, so, I replaced it. </s>
<s> Here are tower's the new specs: PROCESSOR: Intel Core I5-2320 Sandy Bridge 3.0GHz (3.3GHz Turbo Boost) 1MB L2 Cache & 6MB L3 Cache Socket LGA 1155 Quad-Core Processor MOTHERBOARD: Biostar H61MGC LGA 1155 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard 4 x Rear USB 2.0 ports 2 x PCI-E x1 Slot VIDEO: PNY Nvidia Geforce 430 GT (Fermi) 1GB DDR3 128-bit PCI Express Graphics Card 1xVGA Port, 1xDVI Port, 1xHDMI Port Core Clock: 700Mhz Shader Clock: 1400Mhz MEMORY: 8GB (2x4gb) Team Elite DDR3 1333 Gaming/High Performance RAM HARD DRIVE: 1TB Seagate Barracuda 7200RPM 16MB Cache OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit (my copy) OPTICAL DRIVE: Samsung Multiformat DVD Burner 2xUSB Ports, 2xAudio Ports POWER SUPPLY: Corsair CX500 V2 80-Plus Bronze 500-Watt MONITOR: BenQ GW2450 24&quot; LCD I installed the new power supply, and I must say the computer is running 100% better. </s>
<s> It boots really fast, shuts down really fast, gets where I want it to go really fast. </s>
<s> When I installed the NVidia drivers, everything was fine... right up until the moment I plugged in my WD 1.5TB external hard drive. </s>
<s> When I did that, the v-card immediately began to repeatedly quit, then restart--three or four times in less than 5 minutes. </s>
<s> Not illogically, I disconnected the external drive (which my laptop has no problem handling at all)--but the v-card continued to quit/start, though less frequently. </s>
<s> Then, about fifteen minutes ago, it froze, then blue-screened with a notice that the video card could not recover before Windows &quot;timed out.&quot; So the question is: What the heck is going on? </s>
<s> Could it actually be possible that these specs, with the addition of an external drive, could be too much for the PSU? </s>
<s> Or is it likely the card? </s>
<s> Could there be something amiss with the mobo? </s>
<s> That last seems unlikely, since I haven't had a single crash with the onboard v-card... though the computer positively hates my SIIG Soundwave 7.1 USB sound card and freezes for a full five minutes if I click to get into its control panel. </s>
<s> So, what's my logical next step? </s>
<s> The builder may have very well sent you a working PC provided you &quot;added&quot; those ext. </s>
<s> USB devices when it arrived, etc.. That is an added burden but it should have worked. </s>
<s> Your comment on the SiiG soundcard does provide a clue if still connected. </s>
<s> Remove it, if so at least during the testing. </s>
<s> If your Biostar mtrbd. </s>
<s> has audio on-board disable it via the bios setting. </s>
<s> You do have a better PSU BUT!!! </s>
<s> you remained with 500W unit. </s>
<s> You should have upped the ante and gotten more due to your past problems. </s>
<s> Let's be clear, better PCs now have 700W PSUs or better maybe a 650W or similar. </s>
<s> The point being you don't want to stress the PSU to its upper tolerances even a good one. </s>
<s> I suggest you use the rear USB ports. </s>
<s> If the ext. </s>
<s> USB devices are powered by USB port, find a powered ext. </s>
<s> USB hub. </s>
<s> Just how many USB devices are attached, don'e exclude any mouse, etc.. the whole USB list. </s>
<s> Is the video card cooled by fan or totally quiet type with heatsink only? </s>
<s> Have you applied any bios updates? </s>
<s> Place a household fan to open case and try to run it? </s>
<s> Goto Intel and check for any Sandy bridge issues, yours maybe an older CPU even if i5 type. </s>

<s> Actually, I solved the problem by packing up the tower, with an eye toward sending it back to the builder for a refund first thing Monday morning. </s>
<s> The builder/seller, bless his heart, has been incredibly helpful, but the tower just wasn't working. </s>
<s> The fact that the computer runs perfectly well, so long as I don't add that &quot;one last thing,&quot; made me consider the idea that this issue may not have anything to do with the PSU or the Video Card, but something underlying. </s>
<s> Truly the number of items I use shouldn't take up more than a absolute maximum of 325W, or so I've been told. </s>
<s> In any event, my work has reached a stage where I have no more time I can spend testing and trying things to make a tower that should have worked out of the box actually work. </s>
<s> At this point, I am debating whether or not to build a box myself, since I still have the Corsair (by the way, it turns out that the Raidmax was actually 450W, not 500). </s>
<s> I could return it, get a refund and look at buying a higher watt PSU, but the cost of both sending back the tower and having a 15% &quot;restocking fee&quot; chunked out of the PSU return is going to put a dent in what I can build at this point. </s>
<s> I've suddenly gone from having between $650 and $700 to work with, to $550 to $600. </s>
<s> NOT how I was planning to spend my little birthday windfall, let me tell you... </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm still looking to buy/create a tower that will put up with some fairly extensive video and graphics work--and which can be upgraded as time goes on. </s>
<s> It doesn't have to be the fastest (though I do want it to be pretty :-D ); it just has to work when I turn it on and have the nerve to want to access the storage drive, run Firefox, and watch a video at the same time. </s>
<s> Since the PC is going back and you may build your own. </s>
<s> I offer that you look at &quot;bare bones or white box&quot; PC. </s>
<s> basically, it's the PC case and what's inside only. </s>
<s> The whole package depends on what's inside is already a match for what should work. </s>
<s> You &quot;add&quot; the final items to complete the PC system. </s>
<s> There is also just the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and cpu setups for sale as well, you then finish it with the remaining items. </s>
<s> Again, the pairing of cpu and mtrbd. </s>
<s> is good to go setup. </s>
<s> Sorry for your last PC, it happens. </s>
