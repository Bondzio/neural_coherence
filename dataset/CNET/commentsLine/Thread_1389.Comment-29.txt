and are you likely to want to do things that require more power?
for example, if you plan to go broadband, your processor power becomes limited on surfing.
950 mhz is really quite slow; i'd vote for the upgrade, unless you want to hold out for when the next os comes out.
my rule of thumb is to go for the new system if the other upgrades add up to 50% of the cost of a new one, and i suspect that a new hd and usb 2.0 (which your motherboard may not support, btw -- be sure to check that out!)
is close to that level.
and i strongly second the suggestion of a second external hd as backup -- getting one of those last christmas saved my bacon when my main hd mysteriously failed to boot one day a couple months later.
