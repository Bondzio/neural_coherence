i just bought a asus a8n-sli motherboard for a fresh build.
i have a few very knowlageable friends when it comes to computers but cant seem to get a straight answer as to which ram configuration is better- 4x512mb or 2x1gb.
one friend says i should go for the 4x512 because its faster that way because of duel-channel processing.
my other friend says go with the 2x1g because with 4 sticks my mem gets clocked down from 400 to 333. can anyone shed some more light on this subject?
thanks.
