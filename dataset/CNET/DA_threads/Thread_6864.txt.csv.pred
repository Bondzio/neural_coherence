1.1.1	to make a long story short I recently recovered a 40 gig hdd that I stupidly tried to download linux mandrake to a dos partition.	St
1.1.2	I tried to fix it in dos but it created a 3rd partition and dos fdisk didn't want no part of that.	St
1.1.3	So, I thought the drive was dead.	St
1.1.4	Thanks to a recent purchase of partition magic 8 I was able to delete the partitions and work from there.	St
1.1.5	I also found out I could of done this with xp's disk.	St
1.1.6	my problem now is I disconnected my 60 gig maxter to protect it, and inserted my new recovered 40 gig western digital as master and loaded a dual boot of XP and Linux mandrake.	St
1.1.7	After I finally got everything running right I hooked up my maxtor as master, which read secondary master and the west.	St
1.1.8	dig.	St
1.1.9	as slave which read as secondary slave.	St
1.1.10	I booted up in hdd-o through my firmware or bios and right away went to check all the drives and it showed my drives mixed up.	St
1.1.11	So I ran partition magic and found out my storage drive of 20 gigs of saved stuff,programs,music movies and documents, the drive read unallocated.	St
1.1.12	My heart raced and I about died because about 5 years worth of Important stuff had been lost.	St
1.1.13	So I ran partition magic and thankfully I was able to recover the drive.	St
1.1.14	I tried to do a backup then and it read 7 days and 14hrs.	St
1.1.15	to backup.	St
1.1.16	I didn't have the time or that many disks so I went to reboot and went into my bios and swithed to hdd-1 and checked out my xp/linux dual boot and everything was fine so went back to hdd-0 and tried to bood and it said I had a corrupted boot file.	St
1.1.17	Something like system32.dll boot file has been deleted or corrupt.	St
1.1.18	please reinstall the file.	Sug
1.1.19	Yeah right!	St
1.1.20	So I unhooked hdd-1 and reloaded XP and everything is fine on that drive.	St
1.1.21	WHAT DID I DO WRONG?	St
1.1.22	This sequence worked before until I loaded mandrake on the dos partition.	St
1.1.23	I read in an earliar discussion that involved Proffitt About Master/slave vs. cable select.	St
1.1.24	What should I do and how can I tell if I have a cable select ribbon cable?	Ques
1.1.25	Also my west.	St
1.1.26	dig.	St
1.1.27	40 gig hdd reads as 57,500mb the same as my 60 gig maxtor.	St
1.1.28	Is there a way to fix that?	St
1.1.29	Sorry this wasn't so short!	St
1.1.30	Skip	St
1.2.1	http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCS-c.html Many fight this tooth and nail and lose their data.	St
1.2.2	It sounds like you should identify if your cable is 80 conductor and set it proper.	St
1.2.3	Some will try master and slave on 80 conductor cables, but I don't.	Sug
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I'm not sure what 80 conductor is either.	Res
1.3.2	I have many cables in a box.	St
1.3.3	Some never used.	St
1.3.4	I will read your link and hope it tells me.	St
1.3.5	Thanks once again Bob.	St
1.3.6	Your Great!	St
1.3.7	Skip	St
1.4.1	What a bunch of tricky crap!	St
1.4.2	So this means I need to check if #28 pin is missing in the middle for a 80 conductor cable, right?	St
1.4.3	And if not I need to set my master drive in the middle and slave at the end?	St
1.4.4	Right?	St
1.4.5	skip	St
1.5.1	The issue of master slave jumpers changed years ago (about 5) but to make it live on, the 40 conductor cables are still out there on the second IDE channels.	St
1.5.2	Here's a picture comparing each cable type... http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html Specifically ... http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/z_000524wires4080.jpg Bob	St
1.6.1	Hi Skippy333, There is a bit more to add to your story yet!	St
1.6.2	The cable select bit is probably a bit of a red herring (if you carefully read this article you may get it) http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ide-cable-select.html Cables supplied with most m-boards don't use cable select , but high-speed cables (with 80 instead of 40 wires) do support it.	St
1.6.3	But there is another problem you ran into - this is with disk partitioning!	St
1.6.4	Basicly, Microsoft FDISK stinks!	St
1.6.5	It is better on XP than in earlier Windows (if you partitioned a disk with Win98 FDISK, you got a different result from Win NT4 FDISK - and they couldn't read each others partitions).	St
1.6.6	But DOS and Windows only allow 4 partitions on a drive and have strict rules as to how they are read, depending on which version of Windows you boot up in.	St
1.6.7	If you have two drives with a bootable partition on each, DOS/Windows insists that the first bootable partition on the 2nd drive MUST be drive D: which means that connecting a 2nd drive will often give new letters to all your original partitions!	St
1.6.8	So how come I was able to partition drives into 10 parts in the early 80s!!	St
1.6.9	I USED A BETTER PARTITIONING UTILITY!	St
1.6.10	FDISK and DOS didn't exist then and I could put 4 or 5 different operating systems on a drive.	St
1.6.11	For mere info, read the articles at www.ranish.com/part/ (but beware that Ranish Partition manager is not easy to use).	St
1.6.12	Another problem is Partition Magic, as it produces 'non-standard' partitions - some other partition managers do not understand them!	St
1.6.13	Linux is not so limited - it understands the peculiarities of DOS/Windows and will usually add it's own partitions to an existing drive without upsetting things.	St
1.6.14	But don't expect FDISK to understand what has happened afterwards - it is safer to stick with the Linux partition manager after using it once - and life can still get complicated when you have two hard drives (I run Fedora on a 2nd drive).	St
