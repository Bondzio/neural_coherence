<s> Can a new hard drive be cloned through a USB port if the old drive is still functioning? </s>
<s> I have an external hard drive enclosure with a USB connector. </s>
<s> I used CLONEZILLA. </s>
<s> Others use other things. </s>
<s> What stopped you from getting this done? </s>

<s> I always thought you had to connect the drives internally to clone them. </s>
<s> Since I have an enclosure, I thought it would be so much easier to clone the new drive externally. </s>
<s> I didn't know it could be done through the USB port. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info BOB </s>
<s> After doing this too many times over the years I noticed that write speed is slower over than read speed. </s>
<s> This has lead to me putting the new drive inside the machine and the old drive outside in the USB case. </s>
<s> DOWNSIDE? </s>
<s> I have to watch my answers and clicks to what drive is the source and which is the one to write to but it may save me an hour. </s>
