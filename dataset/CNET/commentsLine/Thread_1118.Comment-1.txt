my computer will not boot.
when i hit the power button, nothing happens.
it was fine the other day and there were no recent lightning storms or anything, and i use a surge protector.
i tried replacing the power supply, but nothing happened.
when i hit the power button, i just hear a slight whir from the power supply.
that's it.
no lights or anything.
my cpu is an amd athlon 700ghz and my motherboard is a gigabyte k7 [socket a].
could it be that either my motherboard or cpu is fried?
the power supply i am using is 200 watts.
is that enough?
what type of power supply is recommended?
does the cmos need to be reset?
thanks in advance for your help and suggestions.
