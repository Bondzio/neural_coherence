1.1.1	Im currently looking to purchase a portable external harddrive, something like: http://www.dabs.com/products/samsung-1tb-s2-portable-2-5--usb-2-0-portable-hard-drive--piano-black--74NX.html?refs=47160000&amp;src=2 Which I am wanting to use between my home computer (win7) and the universities computers (macs), compatibility is a key concern as im wishing to edit information at both locations.	St
1.1.2	I have basic to moderate knowledge of computing on PCs and im new to Macs altogether, so sorry if this seems a little amateur!	St
1.1.3	I was wondering if you could clarify what the formatting and compatibility issues are in relation to my specific needs: 1, will I need to reformat every time I move between a mac and win7 2, can I edit, add and remove from both mac and win7 3, will the device work as a plug and play on both ends?	St
1.2.1	2.	St
1.2.2	With some limitations.	St
1.2.3	(4GB file size limit for example.)	St
1.2.4	3.	St
1.2.5	Most do.	St
1.2.6	But let me write the ONE MISTAKE FOLK REPEAT so you don't have to.	Sug
1.2.7	Do not use this as STORAGE.	St
1.2.8	Find some SYNC SOFTWARE to sync when you get to work and for when you leave.	St
1.2.9	If you don't believe this will not happen (plug in drive and Windows wants to format it) then you only need to read the CNET Storage Forum for the pleas for help.	St
1.2.10	Also, why not use DROPBOX for free?	St
