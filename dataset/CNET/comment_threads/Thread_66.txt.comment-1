Okay, so I know little about the inner workings of PC's, but I'd like to upgrade mine.
Basically all I want is to be able to play most games without slowdown and the like.
I currently have an eMachines E4028, and was wondering what sort of upgrades would be suitable.
I have tried looking at graphics cards, but I just get confused.
Someone has offered me an 'XFX PV-T34K-NAHG 5200 NVIDIA AGP' graphics card, but apparently I already have 128mb in onboard graphics?
Oh, and I am on a budget, being a student!
If anyone could help I'd seriously appreciate it.
Cheers, James
