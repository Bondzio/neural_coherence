1.2.1	First thing, install new CMOS battery, just do it.	St
1.2.2	Then if you truly have a floppy but hardly use it, disable it in the bios area.	St
1.2.3	Otherwise, its a true fault, nothing can be done.	St
1.2.4	If possibble try another floppy drive.	Sug
1.2.5	Again, if that doesn't fix it, the FD port is kaput.	St
1.2.6	If you need a FD port, install a FD card for that option.	St

1.4.1	Then remove the CMOS battery for 10min.	St
1.4.2	and then replace it and go from there.	St
1.4.3	Again, while you're doing that, install new battery.	St
1.4.4	if the problem persists, use the &quot;clearing CMOS pins&quot; to go to basics.	St
1.4.5	If you boot-up then even with an error, do so.	St
1.4.6	Then reboot, enter the bios and correct for proper setting.	St
1.4.7	Checksum is a sign something has changed and doesn't match what was saved in the last correct bios post.	St
1.4.8	If you're using a USB kybd.	St
1.4.9	take it out, repeat the above steps with a plain PS/2 kybd..	Sug
1.4.10	If that corrects it, then return USB kybd.	St
