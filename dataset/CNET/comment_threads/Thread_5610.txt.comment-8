like Tomshardware.com, Anandtech.com, etc., and others.
Read the buyer reviews at Newegg.com ... very very few products never mind motherboards, get such positive initial feedback.
It's not that I don't like MSI, ASUS, Gigabyte, etc., the positive comments and reviews across the board are just great !
Your call...just thought you might be interested in what appears to be better.
Let us know.
