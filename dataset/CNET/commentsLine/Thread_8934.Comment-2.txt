i see this question open at  after trying a few keyboards on current android laptops (not 3.0 versions) i have to say you are looking at the ipad.
yes, the ipad charges from usb as noted at  and has excellent keyboard support.
yes, it didn't meet your price point but today's 300 dollar pads do not meet your requirements either.
