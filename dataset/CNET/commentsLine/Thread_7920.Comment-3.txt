hi, you can use team-viewer for file sharing and screen sharing otherwise to make a vpn either you have to buy dyndns services for connection of vpn if you are planning on using dynamic ip's or else you need to request static ip from your respective isp's and then creating a vpn using network setup wizard from your pc windows.
vlan however is entirely a different scope.
