<s> I am a small business owner looking to backup my important business documents in case my older model Acer Aspire 3680 laptop unexpectedly crashes before I fully transition to a new computer. </s>
<s> The documents are primarily Word and Excel with the occasional photo album. </s>
<s> I have been looking at 250GB external hard drives but started to think a flash drive might be a simpler, cheaper solution. </s>
<s> Good idea? </s>
<s> Bad idea? </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> FYI- No matter which, flash or HD, they both have poor records for long term storage. </s>
<s> So, don't count on them as back-up other than for short periods. </s>
<s> CD/DVD/BD discs offer better long term storage. </s>
<s> Depending on the amount of your storage needs will determine which storage media to pick. </s>
<s> If, you pick flash drive, then get several as cost isn't that much especially if on sale or bulk amounts. </s>
<s> Ext. </s>
<s> HDs are OK certainly for larger amounts and do well if treated well, so don't take them for granted. </s>
<s> Again, for super critical data, using discs will help besides any other storage media, just burn what is deemed critical to a disc as well. </s>
<s> It doesn't hurt to have multiple copies as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If you don't need these files, you don't need to backup to other places and devices. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> I read your post and it sounds as if the machine dies, you might lose your files. </s>
<s> Why are you taking such a risk since we have DROPBOX and so many other solutions today? </s>
