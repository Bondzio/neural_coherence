i'd look at a new power supply, just to be safe, and given that that x2 is probably leaps and bounds above whatever its replacing, in power consumption and performance.
i'd also look for a high quality psu over sheer wattage ratings, i can't stress this enough, and if you do decide to skimp on it anyways, all we can do is look on and say &quot;told ya so&quot;  a few manufacturers to add to that list: corsair memory (rebadged seasonic parts) ocz technology (very reputable manufacturer)
