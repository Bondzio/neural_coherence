the cost of the ethernet cable is about the price of a cheap wifi router.
in fact, i was on travel and in a pinch needed a temporary router.
i went to fry's and for under 20 bucks was done.
a 150 foot ethernet cable could cost as much.
-&gt; but are you saying you have wifi out at 150 feet?
i missed that detail and it can explain almost all of the troubles.
you may have to deploy another system to move the wap closer to your pcs.
