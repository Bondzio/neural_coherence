Due to eye surgery and eyeglass issues I have to get a monitor as low to the desktop as possible to avoid having to look upward too much. I'm looking at both 17&quot; LCD and 19&quot;LCD. I understand that the native resolution is 1280 x 1024 for maximum clarity. Right now I have my CRT at 1024 x 768. Here are my questions: Assuming that I have to have the maximum clarity, should I make the logical assumtion that the icons, etc. are going to be smaller than on my 19&quot; CRT. Would the 19&quot; LCD give me larger icons than the 17&quot;. This can be a potential problem because the 19&quot; screen size will be taller and I will have another 2&quot; to look up. How tall is the viewing height on each. Width can also be an issue here becasue I don't have as good peripheral vision now and want to minimize moving my head from side to side. Are there any LCDs width a native resolution of 1024 x 768? Also would a digital video card do anything here. Thanks, Marc

You might get, if you don't already have one, a pneumatic chair that can rise up a bit. Yes, LCDs work best in their native resolution and, with 17&quot; and 19&quot; having the same one, the 17 will produce smaller icons. If you wear glasses which are bi/trifocals, get a pair of single vision lenses optimized for your normal position from head to screen. XP will let you make the icons larger and stay with the native resolutin so that's not a problem. There are also some &quot;accessibility&quot; options that you can work with. Hope this helps.

I learned that 15&quot; monitors have a native resolution of 1024 x 768. That horizontal viewing size is very close to my 19&quot; crt. Does that mean that the height is the same as my crt which is 11&quot;? Most importantly, am I correct in thinking that the 1024 x 768 resolution is the same actual icon and text size on both types? Finally, I see that there are few 15&quot; anymore so I need some reccomendations. I have a TV tuner card in my computer and often watch TV both in a small box and full screen if this matters. I can check the manf. web sites to see if they will take one of those arm mounts on the back although I assume that they all can. Thanks in advance for the info. Marc
