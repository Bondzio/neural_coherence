1.1.1	Hey I have 1 gt 640 and i play cod4 and looking into upgrading my video .	St
1.1.2	What would be better ?	Ques
1.1.3	How fast would 2 dual Nvidia gt 640 vs 1 Nvidia gtx 660 ti be ?	Ques
1.1.4	I run a ok 250fps on my 1 gt 640 now but with a super low config file and rez set to 1440 .	St
1.2.1	That 's a big jump .	St
1.2.2	That parallel stuff ... .2xgt ... ..might turn out to be a big headache .	St
1.2.3	Make sure you have a psu that can handle that card .	St
1.3.1	I find those with dual and more cards to be too hard to support .	St
1.3.2	Or rather the problems often mean we have to re-vamp the machine to get it to work as well as they expected .	St
1.3.3	A single card is the easy path .	St
1.3.4	Your choice but if you go with dual cards , be sure you have support on hand and a thick wallet .	St

1.4.1	& quot ; Dual cards & quot ; has always been a problem in the long run .	St
1.4.2	To me , dual worked well only during the demo days ( at a computer show in my land ) .	St
1.4.3	Thereafter , it was one problem after another .	St
1.4.4	Had to go back to single card coz support for dual was n't free a-tall .	St
1.4.5	Suit yourself .	St
