<s> I purchased a computer from Gateway.com and it was to come with an ATI X1950 XTX video card. </s>
<s> It came installed with a x1900 card. </s>
<s> This was 2 months ago and I am STILL fighting with them to get the right card. </s>
<s> The card they sent in my system is worth 1/2 the card I paid for. </s>
<s> If you purchased from Gateway you better open your case and see what they gave you!!!!!! </s>
<s> I hope you got what you paid for. </s>
<s> I did not! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> If so it's usually not too late to lodge a complaint there to get your money back. </s>
<s> Yes you do have to return the PC too. </s>

<s> I paid with my Debit Card. </s>
<s> I contacted the BBB about it and Gateway responded to BBB that I ordered a x1900. </s>
<s> The X1900 was not even an option on the system. </s>
<s> ( I have my order form) I explained that to the BBB. </s>
<s> Waiting for final response. </s>
<s> Anyway beware!!!! </s>
