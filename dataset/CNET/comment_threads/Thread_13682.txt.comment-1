Hi folks, Im looking for an ADSL router that support a class B private IP address with a subnet mask 255.255.254.0. e.g 172.16.0.1 255.255.254.0 or 255.255.0.0 Im planning to migrate to class B network but unfortunately my ADSL router ( Linksys Wag54g2 doesnt support a 255.255.254.0 subnet mask ) Any recommendation please?
