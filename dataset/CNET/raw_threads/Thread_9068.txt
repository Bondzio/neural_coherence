Here they are: Video Card: XFX PVT84GUDD3 GeForce 8600GTS 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 HDCP Video Card -($224.99) Processor: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ 3.0GHz Socket AM2 Processor - ($169.99) RAM: WINTEC 2GB (2 x 1GB) 240-Pin DDR2 667 (PC2 5300) Dual Channel Kit Memory - ($77.99) Hard Drive: Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB 3.5&quot; SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive - OEM - ($109.99) Motherboard: ABIT IB9 ATX Intel Motherboard - ($86.99) All of this is from newegg.com and that is just a start that I have going right now. I was just wondering what you guys thought of that stuff and if you have any ideas of things that I am going to need to play some awesome games. I am going to play games like F.E.A.R., Rainbow Six Vegas, Battlefield 2142, Call of Duty 4 when it comes out, and other games like that. Help me out please. THANKS everyone!

I'd be surprised if you are getting 100 bucks more performance. Bob

All I really want is to play all of those games VERY smoothly. Everything else is good though? Or what? Anything else that you would suggest?
