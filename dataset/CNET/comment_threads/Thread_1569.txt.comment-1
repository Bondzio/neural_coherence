hi i have a pc with the following spec: Windows Vista Home Premium 32-Bit Intel G33M Motherboard 500-Watts PS Intel Core 2 Duo E6550 @ 2.33Ghz 2 x 1Gb Patriot PC-6400 RAM @ 800Mhz GeForce 8800GT OC WD 500Gb Hard I know that he maximum supported ram is 8Gb on my pc, i currently have 2 GB in dual channel and i notice vista is a bit slow on startup.
Will i see a performance increase if i upgrade to 3Gb?
What if i upgrade my ram to 8Gb by adding 2 more 2Gb ram sticks?
Will having unused ram decrease my pc performance?
thanks
