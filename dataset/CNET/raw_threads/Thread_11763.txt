Hello, I realize my question is going to be a bit vague, but I have a computer, windows XP SP3, that has a main HD (C:) and a storage drive (G:). There's nothing on the storage drive other than misc. stuff like pictures taken, pdf files, work stuff etc. (no installed software). If I were to remove this, can I just as easily reinsert it and have it work as before or do I need to do something special to ensure the G: drive is read again?

For example mine is a &quot;Tools free&quot; Desktop tower from Alienware. Tools free means all I have to do is shutdown, disconnect the power, remove the side panel, discharge myself of static, then unclip a couple of connections and pull the drive tray out. What makes it easier is that the drives are all SATA conventional and no SSDs to confuse the issue. What computer is yours? Mark
