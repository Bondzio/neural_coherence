bob, i'm sorry i didn't answer your question...i probably misunderstood.
but there are no guest accounts except default, and there is no server, per se.
the 'server' box is a w2k workstation in a locked closet so it can't be used by anyone but me.
all databases and documents simply reside there for ease of use and as a central depository.
the other 3 pc's have full permissions/access to it.
the 3 pc's access the internet (dial-up, only method available) through a 3com modem/router and hub.
this is a very simplistic &quot;network&quot;, no permission or access limits for anyone.
that is what is so frustrating at this point...the old hp laserjet 2100 worked just fine for all users.
i've supposedly granted full permissions to the entire list....from administrator to backup operator to users.
i'll check everyone again next week.
i have not configured or changed configurations somewhere and can't find my error.
but now i am administrative tooled out.
that's why i'm turning to you experts for help.
thanks royala
