If you really lost it, you will have to uninstall your game and buy a new version of Hot Date so you have a new password.

I've bought things on line and lost or misplaced my code or password. If they have your name on file they will give you a code or new password...buying on line helps you because they send you an e-mail, usually with your user name and password, so any time you have to re-install they will send you to a site to re-install....good luck
