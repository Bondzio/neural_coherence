when i worked for a metro newspaper in 1967--we had a giant box that housed a friden 'computer' that received the nyse-stock exchange over phone lines for fast publication.
in those days--6/8 line optical perforated tape ran a number of devices.
publishing was one of the first computer-oriented businesses.
my first(1984) home pc was &quot;the first laptop&quot;--the quirky apple iic.
i did use it for early &quot;online&quot; chat rooms using aol or compuserve that cost $6/hour!!
i had some serious credit card bills ($6/700-month.)
i still have it in storage/limbo.
for the appleiic=imagewriter printer=1200 baud modem cost was $2500.
in 1984 dollars!
