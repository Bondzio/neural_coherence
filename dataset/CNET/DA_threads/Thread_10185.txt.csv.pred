1.1.1	Buyers Beware : Rosewill , advertises itself as a manufacturer of computer components through their website , ads at NewEgg.com , through people/companies/sites that review products , through non-existent company sites ( TRG Electronics ) that sells their wares through numerous re-sellers .	St
1.1.2	In these same venues they advertise that they design and engineer their products to the highest level , this is claimed to reduce failures of the products .	St
1.1.3	Based in large part on their advertising , the fact they have now been in business for appr 5 years and that I had heard they were owned by NewEgg , I decided to try one of their products , a 750 PSU ( power supply unit ) on a new system I was to build .	St
1.1.4	I initially test all new components in an existing system , so if there is a problem , I know it is with the new component , which is what I did with this PSU .	St
1.1.5	When I first powered it on their was a loud pop , a hint of smoke and nothing .	St
1.1.6	I immediately killed the power and disconnected everything .	St
1.1.7	When tried with the original PSU , still nothing .	St
1.1.8	Further testing indicated the motherboard , CPU and one of the graphics cards had been ruined , the second graphics card ( of an SLI system ) , would work , but barely and not up to spec ) .	St
1.1.9	I filed for an RMA on the product through NewEgg and wrote a review on the NewEgg site so that others would know of my experience and hopefully would be wary of the product..	St
1.1.10	I was surprised to find that Rosewill responded to the review publically and offered to replace the fried components , with the caveat that they need some more information , I promptly wrote them , describing in detail , what happened , and then the real problems began .	St
1.1.11	After ignoring my initial e-mails , they finally responded .	St
1.1.12	Turns out the additional information they asked for want sufficient , now the wanted me to dismantle the system and send the components to them so they could test them to see if the PSU was the cause of the damage .	St
1.1.13	This sounded both odd and suspicious as I have seen failures of this sort before and , after working/building computers for 28 years know of no way that they could do any tests to make that determination without the entire system intact .	St
1.1.14	Problems of this nature normally occur from a short in the system , again , normally , but not always tied to an improperly installed motherboard ( i.e .	St
1.1.15	it shorts ) .	St
1.1.16	Also on the suspicious side was the fact they wanted me to ship all these components to an individual , actually , t6o the ATTN : of an individual at an address , no mention of Rosewill , NewEgg or anything else just the street address and to the attn of a Mr Arthur Chou. , and to include a copy of their e-mail .	St
1.1.17	Being rather suspicious now , I googled the address to find it attributed to a cargo company in the Yellow Pages , so I wrote and asked them of my thoughts .	St
1.1.18	A ) Why to this address , why not an address listed in the BBB , B ) Who is this Mr Chou , that is suppose to do the testing , per their e-mail , he is listed as Rosewills manager , and I had found sites where he is attributed to being the person that answers the NewEgg reviews C ) what methodology was to be used to determine the cause of failure/damage D ) why is there no RMA paperwork , as I was addressing the RMA dept .	St
1.1.19	The first three questions they ignored , and have ever since , to the RMA question , I was informed there is no RMA paperwork as they dont have RMA procedures , all are through NewEgg..	St
1.1.20	I responded by repeating my earlier questions ( which were again ignored , and have been ever since ) , and asked why then , do they list RMA procedures ( which mention the paperwork ) on their web-site and if so , then how do they abide to their warranties , which in many cases extend far beyond NewEggs policy of handling returns for a maximum of one year .	St
1.1.21	No response to my questions .	St
1.1.22	At that point , there was no way I was going to just up and ship over $ 1,400 worth of hardware to an unverifiable address , to the attn of someone who appears to do everything , and trust them with anything , until they answered my questions .	St
1.1.23	I fully expected that if I did send the components they would claim they never received them ( as anybody could sign for a UPS/FedEx shipment , or they would get them , let them sit for a few days ( I would now guess weeks ) and then claim they had tested and the PSU was not the source of the problem , these thoughts coming from their complete lack of hanesty and failure to answer questions .	St
1.1.24	After a couple more weeks of trying , I filed a complaint with the BBB that Rosewill was just playing games , and in the complaint I asked the same exact questions that I had been asking for weeks , the only response I requested was that they answer the questions , I didnt ask for compensation of any kind , just answers ( I also did ask about all the questionable/mis-leading/ ?	Ques
1.1.25	? false advertising issues I had come across by then ) .	St
1.1.26	As with me , Rosewill has ignored the BBB by not responding .	St
1.1.27	After trying a while longer , I let them know I would file a more in depth complaint with the BBB and post my findings elsewhere , at which point they conditionally agreed to pay current value for the PSU and the fried components .	St
1.1.28	Their conditions include a full retraction of the BBB complaint ( no problem with me if they were going to take care of the matter ) and to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement about the matter , which I again had no problem with , being well versed in these from former government service as well as from testing software/hardware for various companies .	St
1.1.29	I expected a reply along with the agreement the following day .	St
1.1.30	After numerous put offs that their legal department was working on the Agreement they finally sent it , over six working days later .	St
1.1.31	The agreement , their legal department worked on for over six days was , according to my attorney , nothing more than a boilerplate fill-in the blank forms available from any one of a number of sources .	St
1.1.32	Yet it took a legal Department six days , sound shady to you ?	Ques
1.1.33	Me too , especially after reading it .	St
1.1.34	There are points that arent entirely factual and they want me to attest and stipulate to these in this legal document .	St
1.1.35	Obviously , that wont work .	St
1.1.36	Of further note , once again , though they claim to be a manufacturer of the products they sell , going as far as to claim the design/engineering behind the products as well as the manufacturing ( making ) , I personally have yet been able to find a single product of theirs that isnt manufactured by a different company than them , all have had UL numbers on them from a variety of different OEMs ( Original Equipment Manufacturer ) , I have also had other system builders , consultants , techies and engineers check on what Rosewill products they could get a look at and they all ended up with similar results .	St
1.1.37	Not a single product that bears Rosewills name is made by Rosewill .	St
1.1.38	As near as I can determine they are , as many have noted on the net , nothing more than a rebrander that buys other peoples products and slaps their name on them .	St
1.1.39	Another thing that bears note is that , of the OEMs that have been identified , I , myself would never be able to attest to the quality of their products , based on what Ive seen and read about them , I do know I would not buy their products , nor would I have purchased this PSU if I had looked into it closer .	St
1.1.40	So in summary , NewEgg owns Rosewill and Rosewill sells lines of products under their name , claiming they manufacture them , when in truth they buy the products elsewhere and in effect brand them by putting their label and packaging with them , which can actually drive the price higher , which when you look at what appears to be low prices now , think about it..would probably be much lower without the rebranding , which may be more indicative of the products themselves .	St
1.1.41	I believe I have had some positive effect on Rosewills misleading advertising , which adds credence to the fact that they know what they have been doing , do to the fact that since until I challenged them on their advertising practices as extremely deceptive and misleading if not completely false in early/mid July they have ceased with what was their semi-standard line they used in responding to customers who complained via NewEgg reviews where they would state that they Engineer our products , they have since gone to We try to provide the most reliable productsproblem is , since this began with me , I am also seeing more and more people coming out and speaking out about receiving shoddy PSUs that arrive DOA ( Dead on Arrival ) or die shortly thereafter .	St
1.1.42	These products are suppose to be reliable and with a 3 year warranty or whatever but too many arrive DEAD ( lack of or extremely poor quality control and/or poor quality parts ) .	St
1.1.43	Additionally please dont take the reviews posted at NewEgg as being a true representation of the products , my first review , which , granted was extremely critical of Rosewill ( they had just destroyed in excess of a $ 1,300 of components ) was rejected by NewEgg on the grounds that it didnt meet their RULES and criteria .	Sug
1.1.44	When I challenged NewEgg as to please point out exactly what criteria I wasnt meeting they went ahead and published it .	St
1.1.45	I know for fact this has happened to others also , and like mine , YES the reviews did meet all criteria .	St
1.1.46	I would hazard a guess that negative reviews of Rosewill PSUs far outweigh any positive or semi-positive reviews , but that NewEgg publishes enough positive versus negative reviews to keep them in line with the quality made PSUs of name brands .	St
1.1.47	You will also see a number of negative where the authors openly state/claim they feel that NewEgg wont publish their reviews , my guess would be these are people that have had trouble with NewEgg before , reviewed and not been published .	St
1.1.48	The really sad part is that NewEgg allows this .	St
1.1.49	Lastly I would strongly recommend those with bad experiences speak out about them .	St
1.2.1	companies and prefer to deal with product mfgs ... not 'tweeners ' .	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Newegg is not neutral and wo n't press many complaint on their website	St
1.4.1	I found that out also , NewEgg is refusing to answer any questions also , especially on advertising matters .	St
1.4.2	One of their Customer service people ( an assistant manager I believe ) called me on the issues and assured me on the phone that he 'd get the answers to my questions from Rosewill a couple times while on the phone .	St
1.4.3	Then he confirmed that HE 'D get the answers via e-mail .	St
1.4.4	After I sent him the questions ... .guess what ... .NO answers .	St
1.4.5	Then a manager contacted me , he wo n't provide any answers either , in fact like Rosewill he just ignores it .	St
1.4.6	Maybe because one of the questions is about a Rosewill PSU they advertise as SLI Certified , which apparently is n't , anyway can find a cert for it and they wo n't provide any documentation .	St
1.5.1	Some time ago , I posted a comment on this website complaining about my purchase of a Rosewill power supply unit and other matters involving Rosewill .	St
1.5.2	Having been in continuous discussions with Rosewill in regards to my complaint , Im happy to inform you that Rosewill and I have come to a mutually agreeable conclusion to the issues that instigated the complaint .	St
1.6.1	OK ; this is in no way to reprimand the author of this article , and I have used Newegg for years .	St
1.6.2	Rosewill is obviously a named Newegg brand .	St
1.6.3	I would never buy a side brand OEM for products that are vital to the operation of anything .	St
1.6.4	As a rebrander Newegg takes these failures as a hit , but the forum is so controlled that it does not really matter .	St
1.6.5	I know , I know , most of this is stated in the article , but my point it this a PSU is basically the most important part in a computer as nothing at all will run without it .	St
1.6.6	So it should be treated as such and I would never buy a side brand PSU period .	St
1.6.7	The same can be said for a Motherboard and as such it should really be treated the same .	St
1.6.8	As far as it goes though there is value in Rosewill as well but not in major components .	St
1.6.9	Housing ( Desktop towers etc ) , Fans , Lighting and products like DVD drives I would use if branded by Rosewill .	St
1.6.10	Why you will ask I am sure !	St
1.6.11	The reason is relatively simple .	St
1.6.12	Fist they are cheap and second generally there made by a large OEM but sold off and rebranded .	St
1.6.13	I can guarantee you Rosewill makes no fans , DVD/Blueray , Cathode tubing etc etc , they just buy overstock for pennies from the major OEMS , rebrand them and sell them .	St
1.6.14	My rule is this if it cost 1/3rd to 1/4 the price of a major OEM components but physically look the same I may buy it .	St
1.6.15	I also generally try to verify very specifically elsewhere for reviews since it is Newegg 's rebranding company so the reviews on ether ( Newegg , or Rosewill 's ) website would most definitely be flawed .	St
1.6.16	Then I would buy very specifically by the product number of said Rosewill product I was considering a buy of .	St
1.6.17	Once again I would never buy a major ( PSU , MB ) product from a rebrander .	St
1.6.18	The reason for that is it will be of questionable origin and have no literal holder of said warranty .	St
1.7.1	I purchased a RX-950 psu and it was doa.I contacted rosewill for a rma and now they are asking for everything + the kitchen sink.Looks like lesson learned .	St
1.7.2	I will never have any rosewill or newegg pc parts again.Got me once boys.Never again .	St
