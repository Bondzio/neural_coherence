<s> I have been working on a Dell Dimension 4400 Desktop Computer. </s>
<s> However, I have run into a big problem. </s>
<s> When it starts up, It gives you the menu for Safe Mode, Last Known Good Configuration, Boot Up Normally, etc. </s>
<s> If you click on any of these options, you get a quick blue screen, and the computer reboots. </s>
<s> It takes you back to that menu. </s>
<s> Can anybody help me with this? </s>
<s> I'd appreciate it! </s>

<s> Take a moment on your next post to craft a meaningful title. </s>
<s> Please. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Consider that I can only guess that you may be using Windows 2000, XP or 2003. </s>
<s> Repairs may vary, BUT a little history could reveal what the issue is. </s>
<s> For instance, another poster with the same plea revealed they changed the motherboard. </s>
<s> The answer is clear on that one that they get to reinstall the OS since Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003 don't like such changes. </s>
<s> Tell more and post a better titled post with more words and history in the OS Forum that matches. </s>
