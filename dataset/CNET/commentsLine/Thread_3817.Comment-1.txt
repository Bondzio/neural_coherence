okay, so i'm a gamer.
let me explain my problem.
i recently built a computer.
in it is an asus m3a78-em mother board.
an amd athlon 64x 3 ghtz dual core processor.
onboard video is integrated ati radeon hd 3200 gpu with 256 mb memory.
onboard audio is realtekalc1200 high definition audio.
250 gb hd.
windows xp sp3.
i also have a kfa2 nvidia geforce 8500 gt pcie expansion video card when i have the geforce installed, i can run most all my games.
except command and conquer generals and warcraft iii.
they freeze up during game play.
when i use the radeon i can run generals and warcraft but some of the other games suffer.
for instance unreal tournament performance starts to decay, red alert 2 play seem sfine except for when an in game note pops up.
the note never come through.
i hear the sounds and see the black box it appears in but the text seems to freeze up.
age of empires 2 freezes half way through the installation of itself.
now i've tried looking for an updated version of the driver from ati but i can't find the radeon 3200 hd in their lists.
i also tried updating the software for the geforce, but it still would freeze in both generals and warcraft.
my own impressions are that the geforce is having compatability issues with the asus motherboard, and i just can't seem to find the appropriate updated driver for radeon.
i'm currently running with the radeon.
what do you all think?
any ideas?
i appreciate any help that is offered.
feel free to offer your opinions.
thanks matt
