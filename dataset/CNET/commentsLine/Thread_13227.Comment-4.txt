the emachine t6212 comes with a 300w power supply.
the ati x800xl is a fine card.
seaninwa in this theard installed a x899xl and didn't mention upgrading the ps:  someone else in that thread, rickgut2004, installed a 450w power supply with his t6212.
if you have problems, then of course increase the ps.
