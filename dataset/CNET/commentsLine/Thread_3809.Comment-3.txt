well from what you have said, this is a cheapo psu and should not be trusted and my other hardware depends on this thing working what would you recommend for under $100?
cpu-intel c2d e8400 gpu-xfx 9800gtx+ psu-hec x-power pro 650w hdd-western digital 500gb ram-kingston 2gb mb-xfx 780i case-thermaltake m5 it will need to run all these things, a rough estimate at the power needed is fine, i just need a decent brand to look for and ill do all the adding myself note: i would like to run sli in the future
