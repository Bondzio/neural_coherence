1.1.1	Hi everyone, Im new to this boared and I saw you guys are all pretty educational in regards to this stuff so I will ask for your opinion I have been looking for a couple of weeks now for the perfect laptop (and as most of you know THAT is almost impossible to find!)	St
1.1.2	I ran across the Acer AS5112WLMi (which is a part of the 5110 series) Everything in it looks pretty amazing especially for the price that it is selling for (about 1400 US) I would be primarily using it for gaming and surfing the net but I will also use it a little at school taking notes and what not.	St
1.1.3	If you could please give me some input on what you think or have heared of this laptop it would be much much appriciated!!	Sug
1.1.4	Thanx!!	St

1.2.1	Will that be an issue?	St
1.2.2	How about that warranty?	St
1.2.3	3 years?	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	The battery is fine, since I figured if I wanna find a computer with power it will be short on battery life nevertheless The warranty is 12 monthes parts 12 monthes labour and you can add an extra year on top of it for $225 and 2 years for $250.	St
1.3.2	Thanks a lot for replying :D:D	St
1.4.1	Just want to pipe in that I have given up with the small form factor Sony's et.	St
1.4.2	al.	St
1.4.3	Whether at home or traveling -- I cannot do without my Dell Latitude with 15.4&quot; screen and resolution of 1920 X 1200.	St
1.4.4	It is a bit heavy -- but well worth the added weight.	St
1.4.5	I would consider other brands -- if I could get them to tell me what their resolution is (and sell me a laptop with a high resolution monitor at a reasonable price).	Sug
1.5.1	Hmm..All I have been hearing constantly for a year now is how Dell isn't as good as other notebooks are.	St
1.5.2	I dunno I guess it gave me a bias opinion towards them and now no matter what I always look the other way when I hear Dell.	St
1.5.3	:S	St
1.6.1	Please help	St
1.7.1	These types of questions generally illicit tons of opinions that just cause further confusion for the buyer.	St
1.7.2	As I write this, I see an older Toshiba sitting beside me, a Gateway in my travel bag, and my daughter's new Acer that she bought when she got her first job out of college.	St
1.7.3	None of these computers have ever given me any issues or problems.	St
1.7.4	All three have performed at or above their respective specifications and my own expectations.	St
1.7.5	So what would you have me say?	St
1.7.6	I would rate all of them a buy.	St
1.7.7	What I would suggest is going to a store of your choice and test driving all of the systems.	St
1.7.8	Compare them and then make a decision based on your results and reviews.	St
1.7.9	I just finished helping a neighbor purchase a new notebook and after everything was done, they bought a new HP laptop.	St
1.7.10	I think they made a great choice based on their criteria, not mine.	St
1.7.11	That is what's important.	Polite
1.7.12	One more thing, regardless of what you buy, once you have, don't second guess yourself based on information you didn't have originally.	St
1.7.13	Make the best choice available and then move on and enjoy the new system.	St
1.7.14	Good Luck and let us know what you eventually get.	St
1.8.1	Hey thanx a lot for the response !!!	St
1.8.2	My biggest problem with this acer notebook is that I can not find a single review of that model for the life of me!!	St
1.8.3	Am I gonna be the only one in the world who purchased it?!	St
1.8.4	It kinda scares me lol	St
1.9.1	Well you won't be the only one, that is exactly the one my daughter bought at CompUSA in late August.	St
1.9.2	She went for all the bells and whistles and so far has been very pleased with the performance.	St
1.9.3	I doubt she will ever &quot;review&quot; it as being a full time 6th grade teacher, she doesn't spend much time doing that type of thing.	St
1.9.4	I won't review it as I don't spend enough time on it to do a proper job of reviewing it and that wouldn't be fair to the people reading the review looking for an opinion.	St
1.9.5	I will say this - out of the seven computers in the house, it is by far the fastest one of the bunch.	St
1.9.6	It smokes thru spyware and anti-virus checks (that I do for her every month).	St
1.9.7	Other than that I would prefer not to comment further.	St
1.9.8	Again, Good Luck with your search.	St
1.10.1	Hey thanks a lot for the comments everyone!	Polite
1.10.2	I have bought the Acer 5112 which I was looking at for a long time.	St
1.10.3	Its a great computer...For me its incredible!	Polite
1.10.4	It runs new games on high speed (the one i tried was oblivion) very well.	St
1.10.5	The battery life isnt the greatest but thats cuz its a powerful notebook.	St
1.10.6	If you have any questions or if you wanna buy this laptop and cant find any reviews anywhere *arrrr* then you can ask me and I shall answer again thanx a lot!	Ques
1.10.7	!	St
1.11.1	Congratulations!!!	St
1.11.2	Enjoy your new computer, you obviously did your homework and now it is time to reap the benefits.	St
1.12.1	the notebook i own is old but it still has better specs intel 2.00GHZ 768ram 80gb hd	St
1.13.1	how is 768 ram better then 2 gigs of ddr2?	St
1.13.2	Yes...your intel has 2.0 ghz but mine has 2 processors, and they are AMD so an AMD 1.6 ghz processor is better then a 2.0 ghz intel.	St
1.13.3	Just cuz AMD processors are measured differently.	St
1.13.4	Oh and Im sure my graphic cards can kick your comps ass	St
