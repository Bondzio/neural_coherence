First time poster, long time lurker &gt;.&gt; I've decided to build a computer for gaming. The last one I built was about four years ago. I'm really into RTS games and the horrible frame-rate on SupCom is the last straw. My current rig was state of the art when I put it together but a long time has passed. Based on my preliminary research, here's what I'm thinking of: CPU: AMD Athlon 64 FX (Dual-Core) $215 -I &lt;3 AMD, so the CPU was a no-brainer. Motherboard: Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe $169 or an ASUS crossfire $237.66 -I really didn't know what motherboard would be best for my purposes, but both came highly recommended for my intended processor. Ram: ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2gb $89.98 x 4= $359.92 -Ram wise, well... let's just say I'll probably end up repeating this process another half-decade down the line. Though, I still can't figure out the difference between just buying ram and buying a ram kit. hard-drive: Western Digital WD1600YS 160gb sata2 7200MB 16mb bus. $69.00 -As far as the hard-drive goes, I don't really have a use for uber amounts of space. So long as it holds the game, faster is better. video-card: Geforce 8800 GTX Video card, PCIE, SLI. $540 x 2= $1080 -I think either motherboard was really postured for use with Nvidia cards, otherwise I probably would've went with Rage. Or something. I marked it down twice because, correct me if I'm wrong, SLI requires two of the same cards. CD/DVD drive: Plextor PX-810SA $99.48 -I don't write DVDs. I just wanted to be able to put a game in and play. A cheaper alternative more suited to my needs would be welcome. Case: Raidmax katana atx-729WB black steel. Full tower. $95.98 -I went with a large tower to hold all the stuff in this list. I'd heard there were particular problems fitting it all into a mid-size. PSU: Nspiregear 58655. 850W unit. $178 -I figured this system would draw roughly 650ish watts. I wanted to overshoot by roughly 200 just in case. As another aside, Nspire is made by Texas Instruments, and I loved my TI-82 to death. Literally. Keyboard: logitech G15 $68.99 -Dunno. Heard it was good. Macros are are always welcome. mouse: Logitech G7 $56 -Sometimes I get a fixation on FPS. It usually ends poorly. Altogether, this should run between $2391.37 - $2460.03, depending on the motherboard. I've got quite a few concerns before I take the plunge, but I'd like outside opinion before finalizing any decisions.

My advice today is that if you are going to run Windows XP (gamer's choice) then stop at 2GB since it's a 32-bit OS and you don't want to repeat all the lessons learned by others about the 4GB issue. Looks like fun. Bob
15228	3	267757	2605807	2605501	ozos	10/13/07 9:40 AM	1.1922684E12	wow, lots of problems	and wherea re oyu getting these prices, its so expensive firstly: look at Intel's Core 2 Duo line, and AMD's Athlon64 x2, you dont need FX (and it doesnt get you much, unless you're buying the DSDC set, the DSDC setup would increase FPS in supcom) secondly, SLI, worthless, get the 8800GTX single, install it, and forget about it, you dont need SLI (it wont help much with supcomm) thirdly, ram kit just means you get 2 or 4 sticks of RAM in one package, vs buying each individually, DO NOT GET 4GB OF RAM, Windows XP and Vista 32-bit won't even see part of it, and while Vista x64 can see all of it, nothing can make use of it (its a waste of cash, is what I'm getting at), if you want a lot of RAM, get a 2x1GB kit and a 2x512MB kit and run 3GB of RAM in dual channel, it'll save you the money on buying another GB, and it'll be usable the money you're spending on that optical drive is obscene, look at basically any other brand of DVD burner, it'll cost about $35, Lite-On and NEC are both great, so is LG I'd look at an entirely different PSU, as the one you've selected doesn't inspire confidence, check out companies that are revered for their PSUs, not their calculators, such as Corsair, Seasonic Tech, Silverstone, PC Power & Cooling, Enermax, etc if you still want SLI for whatever reason, 850W is skimpy, I'd look at a different case with SLI too, try Silverstone, Lian-Li, or Antec (you need more airflow), and 850-1000W of PSU from a reputable, known PSU maker honestly, the Kb/mouse aren't worth the $100, you dont need &quot;gaming hardware&quot; just to game, if you want a fast response mouse, check out the IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 from MS, should run you about $35, just as capable as the Logitech, but none of the built up hype, hence cheaper (even Razer's mice are cheaper) check www.newegg.com, you should be able to do a whole system with a 500GB HD (they only cost about $95) for under $1500

I'm a little strapped for time at the moment; I'll be heading out the door in a few minutes to go TDY for a week. Thanks for the insight, I'll see if I can't put it into practice on my return.
15228	5	267757	2612086	2605868	Paladin.	10/21/07 8:57 PM	1.19300022E12	Alright, some changes...	Just got back and had some time to review. Here's what I've come up with so far. CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 $210 -As per suggestion. Motherboard: Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe $140 -Made a decision and picked this one instead of the crossfire. Ram: ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2x1 gig (A-Data $28x2= $56) and 2x512 mb (Wintec $20x2= $40). -As per suggestion. hard-drive: Western Digital WD1600YS 160GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0 Gb/s, 16mb cache. $60. -Still not wanting space as much as speed. I wanted something with higher RPM, but I wasn't sure if SATA 150 was compatible with the motherboard, so I went for this. video-card: Geforce 8800 GTX Video card, PCIE, SLI. $500. -As per suggestion. And if I have the need, I can always get another. CD/DVD drive: Lite-On DVD-ROM DH-16D2S-04. $18. -As per suggestion. Case: Lian Li PC-G70B ATX Full Tower. $200 -As per suggestion. PSU: COOLMAX CTG-850 ATX 12V 850W. $230 -I tried to find one under the manufacturers that was recommended, but they didn't have anything on newegg.com that was near the wattage I wanted. I think this one has all the cables I'll need, but I'll research it more later on. Total: $1454. Let me know what you think.
15228	6	267757	2612128	2612086	VAPCMD	10/21/07 9:45 PM	1.1930031E12	More research and analysis required or you	won't get the best bang for the gamimg buck. CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 $210 (WHICH ONE ???) -As per suggestion. Still recommend Intel C2D as CPU ....clearly the CPU of choice for today's PC. Motherboard: Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe $140 -Made a decision and picked this one instead of the crossfire. Still recommend MB for Intel Platform such as the Abit IP35 Pro http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813127030 $159.99 after $20 rebate Ram: ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2x1 gig (A-Data $28x2= $56) and 2x512 mb (Wintec $20x2= $40). -As per suggestion. Personally I'd buy the 4GB now and decide how to best use it afterwards. Believe you can use it all with the 64bit version of Windows. It's unbelievably cheap today. hard-drive: Western Digital WD1600YS 160GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0 Gb/s, 16mb cache. $60. -Still not wanting space as much as speed. I wanted something with higher RPM, but I wasn't sure if SATA 150 was compatible with the motherboard, so I went for this. For peanuts more you can get a 320GB or 400GB SATA see here http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010150014+103530105+1035915133&Configurator=&Subcategory=14&description=&Ntk=&srchInDesc= PSU: COOLMAX CTG-850 ATX 12V 850W. $230 -I tried to find one under the manufacturers that was recommended, but they didn't have anything on newegg.com that was near the wattage I wanted. I think this one has all the cables I'll need, but I'll research it more later on. ******Read here for best info re PSUs . . . http://www.jonnyguru.com/reviews.html and then check Newegg.com again . .they've got PSUs from 100W to 1200W and prices with shipping are usually quite competitive. And by all means ...read the buyer comments...they're usually quite helpful and informative and helpful. VAPCMD
15228	7	267757	2614365	2612128	Paladin.	10/24/07 6:34 PM	1.19325084E12	Putting in some of the recommended tweaks.	CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400+ Windsor 3.2GHz 2x1MB L2 Cache AM2 Socket. $210 -My bad, failed to specify. As far as AMD vs. Intel, maybe I'm counter-culture. I just like AMD more. hard-drive: Hitachi Deskstar 7K1000 750GB 7200RPM 32MB Cache Sata 3.0Gb/s $200 -Well, I thought the matter over and maybe extra space wouldn't be that bad. The price seemed alright and I liked the cache. PSU: PC Power & Cooling Turbo-Cool 1KW-SR EPS12V $430 -Thanks for the johnnyGuru link. I went back and picked this one out. Reviews were favorable. Adjusted total: $1754 --- I figure if I need more RAM I can always go back and buy more; the motherboard has the slots. If the games I play can't use it yet, I'll wait until they can.
15228	8	267757	2614343	2614365	VAPCMD	10/24/07 7:26 PM	1.19325396E12	Ok...	One more thing... Might be better with two HDDs than just one. Here's why .... drive 0 serves as space for your OS and APPs (C:) with a second partition for DATA (D:). Drive 1 is also installed internally and serves as an easy, fast back up (and restore) for the main HDD. One big HDD .. if it dies you're toast and have no backup. With two HDDs you've got some redundancy and not likely that both drive could fail simultaneously. Virus infected yes...fail unlikely. VAPCMD
15228	9	267757	3013329	2605484	ndemko	3/28/09 2:10 PM	1.2382494E12	Do NOT buy from CyberPower PC	When looking for a gaming PC for my son, I relied on the reviews from PC World to select CyperPower PC (www.cyberpowerpc.com/) . They have been HORRIBLE. We purchased two PCs -- one for $3,500, one for over $5K. The $5K PC arrived and wouldn't stay on for over 1 minute before overheating. We went back and forth and finally were issued a full refund. The cheaper PC ($3.5K) has been returned -- the motherboard went out after eight months. Customer service is non-existent. You will be on hold for hours. Trying email is a joke. After about a month of communications trying to honor the warranty on the motherboard, we did receive the PC back with a new motherboard. Today, we discovered that the PC won't turn on. Power is getting to the PC, but it won't start. We've been on hold to Technical Support with CyperPower PC for hours. Do NOT purchase a PC from these people. It is a joke. It is a shame that PC World would have rated them so highly.
