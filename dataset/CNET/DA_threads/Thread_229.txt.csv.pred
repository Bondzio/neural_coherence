1.1.1	As it gets ready to feed a new piece of paper , HP Photosmart 8250 makes horrid grinding noise .	St
1.1.2	It makes normal clicking noises , then very fast thack-thack-thack-thack , more normal clicking and then another set of grinding .	St
1.1.3	There are no error messages and it prints just fine ( when there 's ink ) .	St
1.1.4	It 's been doing this for a while and we 've been ignoring it .	St
1.1.5	What could cause it ?	Ques
1.1.6	I posted this question in HP 's forum in January and got no replies .	St
1.1.7	We do n't print enough to use the ink up before it expires .	St
1.1.8	We ignore the warnings about using expired ink .	St
1.1.9	That would n't cause this , would it ?	Ques
1.1.10	( Those expiration messages are just SO ANNOYING . )	St
1.1.11	Now it wo n't print black & white because it says we are out of yellow ink .	St
1.1.12	What does yellow ink have to do with printing black & white ?	Ques
1.1.13	We do n't know whether to throw this piece of cr*p away or buy more ink and put up with grinding noise .	St
1.1.14	This is Windows 7 Home 64-bit .	St
1.1.15	Any advice would be most welcome !	Polite
1.2.1	I see at http : //www.amazon.com/HP-Photosmart-8250-Printer-Q3470A/dp/B000A6X9CU this was first available in 2005 .	St
1.2.2	ANY CONSUMER GRADE PRINTER is non-repairable for very simple reasons .	St
1.2.3	The minimum shop fee is over 100 bucks and a new printer can be had for less .	St
1.2.4	This does infuriate some folk so we know to not upset them by writing about this issue .	St
1.2.5	( Oops . )	St
1.2.6	I see folk do sell used ones starting at 50 bucks so your choice to get another to take its place without issues .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I suppose it did serve us well .	St
1.3.2	It 's not the answer I was hoping for .	St
1.3.3	Yes , I 'm one of the folks that gets infuriated by the planned obsolescence !	St
1.3.4	Something else to add to the landfill , not to mention the waste unused and probably expired ink cartridges ( but no yellow ) !	St
1.4.1	I hear you but are you willing to pay for the repairs that cost more than the printer ?	Ques
1.4.2	It 's not planned ob ...	St
1.4.3	It 's simple economics .	St
1.4.4	If you can make a printer for 50 bucks retail that lasts for 2 years then why not ?	Ques
1.4.5	It beats having to pay about a grand for a printer that lasts a decade .	St
1.4.6	250 bucks is cheaper than 1,000 ?	Ques
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I am using that same printer and it will make that noise when it 's doing self maintenance .	St
1.5.2	If it has a empty ink cartridge it will do the clunky weird noise almost every time you try to print .	St
1.5.3	I let one of the cartidges go dry when I first got the printer and it did just what you are discribing .	St
1.5.4	After I replaced the cartridge the noise went away except for when it does it 's maintenance .	St
1.5.5	Have not let one go dry since and no noise .	St
1.5.6	You may have a different problem , but as Bob said , it 's not worth wasting money to have it repaired when a new printer is cheaper .	St
1.6.1	Thanks !	St
