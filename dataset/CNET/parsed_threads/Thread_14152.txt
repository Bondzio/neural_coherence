<s> ok. i've just installed a new stick of 256mb DDR RAM. </s>
<s> i already had 256mb already installed that was fine. </s>
<s> When i turned on the comp after putting the new stick in i went to start &gt; control pannel &gt; system and saw that the new stick of RAM was not recongized. </s>
<s> it still only said 256mb of ram. </s>
<s> The system i'm running is: AMD 2400+ athlon xp 256mb RAM ASUS K7S8X mother board etc can anyone help me on how to get it to work? </s>
<s> Wrong type of ram. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> it's not the wrong type of ram as the motherboard is made for DDR and the type i put in is DDR. </s>
<s> so what is the problem then? </s>
<s> A common misconception is if it plugs in, it should work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> could mean lots of different types of ram and not all ddrs are intercompatible. </s>
<s> You need to know the speed not DDR! </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> How can i tell the speed of the RAM? </s>
<s> and why would it be incompataible? </s>
<s> ram sticks have speeds and if wrong speed then wont work. </s>
<s> dats y u go to crucial.com, kingston.com, or other ram manufacturers website and use their configurators to determine the exact spec of ur ram. </s>
<s> [what speed DDR] PC 2100, 2700, 3400 [DDR 200, 266, 333, 400]???? </s>
<s> What speed is the old stick??? </s>
<s> The system will only run at the speed of the slower of the two sticks, and only if you have the memory bus speed set properly. </s>
