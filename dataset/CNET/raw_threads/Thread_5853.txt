I have my eye on the AIW 9800 pro and the AIW X600 pro. The 9800 has 128 mb ram and is 8x AGP, and the X600 has 256 mb ram and is PCI express. How do these two compare in performance? Are the new X... line of cards comprable the the previous line? (e.g.: X600 = 9600?)

If you need the high frame rates and shading for high end games. Look to the PCI express technology, this path will allow you to upgrade to newer cards as they are developed.

13996	6	54362	669340	652323	krazydonutboy	1/9/05 2:21 PM	1.10528046E12	i just realized	hey, mrfrantik, i just realized that the 9800 does come with ati's acclaimed remote, but the X600 does not. that may account for the price difference.
