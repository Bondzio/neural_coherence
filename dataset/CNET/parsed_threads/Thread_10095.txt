<s> I recently purchased Comcast internet, specifically the &quot;Performance&quot; package (25 Mbps). </s>
<s> I purchased an approved modem (Motorola Surfboard SB6141) and a router (Medialink Wireless N - 300 Mbps). </s>
<s> My problem has me so mind-boggled that I'm flipping out: My speeds are slower when wired to the router (PC--&gt;modem) versus wired directly to the modem (PC--&gt;router--&gt;modem). </s>
<s> Here's the rub: Regardless of whether I am wired directly into the modem or wired to the router, I get 25 Mbps when I go to Speedtest.net. </s>
<s> How could that be? </s>
<s> I thought maybe it was in my head, maybe it was psychological, but I tested it time and time again. </s>
<s> For example, when streaming video while connected to the modem, I can pause the video and it buffers very fast. </s>
<s> But, when I'm connected to the router, it buffers about 1/10 of the speed. </s>
<s> Yet Speedtest.net is saying they are both maxing out at 25 Mbps! </s>
<s> The ping rate is the same too. </s>
<s> WTF!? </s>
<s> How could that possibly be? </s>
<s> (I tested this 20 times with the same video and got the same result each time.) </s>
<s> I also tried changing cables and power cycling, but that doesn't make a difference. </s>
<s> Did I get a bad router? </s>
<s> I also tried connecting to the router wirelessly. </s>
<s> While Speedtest.net shows a slightly slower speed (i.e., 20 Mpbs), the buffering on streaming video is still ungodly slow. </s>
<s> Why is this happening? </s>
<s> Someone please help me before I rip all my hair out. </s>
<s> It's not surprising. </s>
<s> Look for reviews on this router and some say it's not so hot. </s>

<s> I acknowledge that bad review, but I purchased that router precisely because it had the highest rating on Amazon! </s>
<s> Do you have another suggested router? </s>
<s> But be sure of your return privileges. </s>
<s> Call the support and see what they offer. </s>
<s> And my trick? </s>
<s> Always try this with the WiFi off and the target in the DMZ. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Seems happy but your story actually makes sense. </s>
<s> It's a delicate play on TCP/IP windowing and software. </s>
<s> I'll definitely try with wireless turned off on the router (I'll have to figure out how to do that). </s>
<s> As for DMZ...??? </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29 ?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> A setting or entry by name is what we use. </s>
<s> I'm surprised this router didn't note the DMZ entry. </s>
<s> Maybe it's for mass consumption and not for folk that need to do more than the usual? </s>
<s> This means no, I didn't read this router's manual. </s>
<s> Mostly because all have had the DMZ feature. </s>
<s> Is this a first? </s>
<s> A router without such? </s>
