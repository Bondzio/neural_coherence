<s> Hello everybody, I have a rather awkward problem most of the times I try to watch a movie in my PC. </s>
<s> The moment I insert the dvd disk in and starts to read then all of a sudden the pc automatically restarts. </s>
<s> I have a Pentium 4 in 3.0 GHz with Windows XP home, 512 MB Ram, 80GB Hard drive, LiteOn dvd-RW, and a VGA 128MB PCI-express. </s>
<s> The problem doesnt appear in all dvd movies but in the majority of those. </s>
<s> With common dvd (software content) and CDs there is no problem at all. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It turned out to be the sound driver. </s>
<s> This one had driven many tech insane as all CDs worked as well as MP3s and many DVDs. </s>
<s> I will NOT dive into the gritty details but the theory is the DVD used the 5.1 stereo portion of the audio driver and that is where I guess the flaw was. </s>
<s> Finding the latest driver was not easy since it was some OEM motherboard by Fujitsu-Siemans. </s>
<s> But a little sleuthing and we found it. </s>
<s> Your issue sounds oh so familiar. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> And yes, the Microsoft Update Driver button announced it had the latest drivers. </s>
<s> I wonder if they'll ever fix that. </s>
<s> if your Processor isnt getting enough power from your Power Supply Unit then your system will reboot itself under the strain. </s>
<s> P4 3.0Ghz CPUs draw quite a lot of power so if you continue to have this problem later in life then I would look at upgrading your PSU........ </s>
