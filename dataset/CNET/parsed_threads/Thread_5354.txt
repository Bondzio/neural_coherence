<s> I'm looking for a new graphics card for my XP pro 2.8 GHZ computer. </s>
<s> I don't have much to spend and I see several Nvidia 6200 s on sale on ebay for 49.99 + approx $10 shipping. </s>
<s> I have an Nvidia FX 5200 PCI now. </s>
<s> My motherboard is an intel d865glc with an 8X AGP slot. </s>
<s> Would I notice a lot of improvement? </s>
<s> there is a few shader improvements from the FX 5xxx range graphics cards towards the 6xxx range cards, but performance wise from a FX 5200 to 6200 very little, its a cheap card and ok for newer games on lower resolution like 800x600 and maby 1024x768 but when you want to play on high quality modes with Anti-Aliasing (Multisampling ) and Anisoptropic-Filtering to give the game more depth and details you would wanna consider a Geforce 6600GT and higher or X600 / X1600 / X800 and higher, especially on FPS games like Quake 4, Call Of Duty 2, FEAR even the previous titles Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Far Cry requires more Graphics Processing Power to be played enjoyably and on eye candy modes... On the AGP side, the ATi Radeon 9800 Pro-128 Meg and 9800 XT-256 Meg version was some of the best AGP card and still compares very well with X700 and Geforce 6600+GT PCI-X range cards, and might even be still available at a very good price. </s>
