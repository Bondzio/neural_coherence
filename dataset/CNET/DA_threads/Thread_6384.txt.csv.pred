1.1.1	Hi , this is just a disclaimer for people who read strange things about Yzy-oui-fi.com hacking Wifigator ... . ( http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-7574_102-302266.html ? tag=nl.rCOMBINED ) the thread have been closed because of offensiv post , this is a good thing but as we could not answer to the flaming message about us , i decide to publish a short answer in order to clarify the position .	St
1.1.2	Yzy-oui-fi.com is not an hacker website .	St
1.1.3	We work for Wisp and hotspots providers since 2005 , we built firmware and hotspot server system .	St
1.1.4	We did not hacked Wifigator.com , we are Wifigator.com PARTNER !	St
1.1.5	The association of the Wifigator and Yzy-oui-fi name is synonym of & quot ; more secured system & quot ; , & quot ; no stolen code & quot ; , & quot ; Company who respect and listen to their customers requirement & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	Oregon Micro Science was Wifigator Partner , but this is ended this spring at the same time that Wifigator start dealing with us .	St
1.1.7	Wifigator.com is the only & quot ; Wifigator hotspot billing system & quot ; owner ( but I guess Loren Wolsiffer , the Wifigator CEO , could explain this with lot of details better than me ) .	St
1.1.8	We see lot of bad copy and lot of people claiming they are wifigator devs , or Wifigator owner , this is probably due to wifigator success story .	St

1.1.10	system go where ever you want except at Wifigator.com .	St

1.3.2	You could look as forward as you want Chuck , but as you do not know a penny in wifi and in AAA system ( I 'm pretty sure you do not knwo what is AAA system ) , people could get more reliable information about wifi if they just ask the butcher near there home , rather than asking you .	St
