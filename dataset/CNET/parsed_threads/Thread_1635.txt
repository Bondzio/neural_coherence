<s> Hello, We have been recording (voice and music) on 90 mins tape for the last 12 years. </s>
<s> I am looking to create a digital library (covert all those tapes on MP3). </s>
<s> I am wondering on wich support to keep that library. </s>
<s> One hard drive a year and a copy on another location. </s>
<s> Copy the MP3 on a DVD. </s>
<s> Copy the MP3 on DSS (DAT) tape. </s>
<s> What is the life expentency of each support. </s>
<s> My first idea was to store on Hard Drive but last week I dropped one of mine in its external casing and the drive broke (I had almost had everything on backup but I lost a month of recording). </s>
<s> So now I am unsure how I should procede. </s>
<s> Just discussed at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=6&threadID=185344&messageID=2017489 Your comment of &quot;My first idea was to store on Hard Drive but last week I dropped one of mine in its external casing and the drive broke (I had almost had everything on backup but I lost a month of recording). </s>
<s> So now I am unsure how I should procede.&quot; is telling me you don't have a backup system. </s>
<s> Or even a second copy. </s>
<s> No matter which system you used, without a second copy none will satisfactory. </s>
<s> &quot;I am wondering on wich support to keep that library.&quot; Before I comment further, said library must have a backup system. </s>
<s> &quot;One hard drive a year and a copy on another location.&quot; Seems to be OK. </s>
<s> When one fails you toss it, get new and clone the copy again. </s>
<s> CHEAP, big storage. </s>
<s> Pretty fast but no write protection means that if the user errored or some virus did it in that the same fate awaits the second copy. </s>
<s> Where's the write protection? </s>
<s> &quot;Copy the MP3 on a DVD.&quot; Here's the care, handling document: http://www.itl.nist.gov/div895/carefordisc/ Here's the lifespan document: http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/05/0024258 &quot;Copy the MP3 on DSS (DAT) tape.&quot; The only downside here is that DAT tape and readers are not widely available. </s>
<s> It's not something I'd consider today. </s>

<s> Please change the file permissons for it. </s>
<s> Step 1: Set Permissions ========================== 1) Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> 2) Locate the file or folder for which you want to set permissions. </s>
<s> 3) Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab. </s>
<s> 4) Click the name of the group or user. </s>
<s> 5) In Permissions, click Allow for each permission you want to allow. </s>
<s> further you may also give it read-only rights, so that no one else deletes it. </s>
<s> Step 1: Rread-only ========================== 1) Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> 2) Locate the file or folder for which you want to remove read-only. </s>
<s> 3) Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the General tab. </s>
<s> 4) Ccheck the options &quot;Read-only&quot; Now you have stored the files, but we should always maintain a back-up of all our important files. </s>
<s> To maintain backup, I would suggest you to write the contents to a CD. </s>
<s> CDs are more durable than DVDs. </s>
<s> However DVDs hold much more data. </s>
