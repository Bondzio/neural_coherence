I demo'd this for years for new IT staffers that would announce they secured our PCs or locked them down.
We would pull out the old Linux CD (today we use the USB stick version) to boot up, bypass all the security and get into the PC.
Leaving no trace we would leave.
I think we are going to repeat prior discussions about PC security and that physical access means I have full access to that PC, HD contents and more.
I can't guess which method they used.
It could have been as simple as FireSheep (see google).
