I have built my own computer and am having some trouble with something.
Im not sure if the BIOS is wrong or what but when I power up the computer after about a day of not being used, I check the temperature of the CPU in BIOS and it always says 113 degrees F.After a while I will go back into the BIOS and check it again, of course since it has been running for a while the temp has gone up some.
My question,is the BIOS temp wrong?
The fan speeds seem to be reading right and everything else in the BIOS seems to be right.Why does the temp read 113 when the CPU is cold?Also it says system temp 95 degrees but inside the case seems more cool than my house @ around 78 degrees.
My system: Intel Celeron 2.8Ghz 768 MB DDR Windows XP Home(for now) ATI Radeon 9600 Graphics Card 1 Intake fan (Cool Master 80x80x25mm) 1 Outtake fan (Same as above) 1 Extra fan just in case (same as above) 1 CPU Fan with heat sink (Zalman 109x109x62mm 2400RPM) Thermal Paste that came with CPU Fan was applied 120Gig HD
