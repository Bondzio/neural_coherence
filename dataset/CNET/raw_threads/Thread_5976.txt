A too often asked question is whether PC133 memory works in a machine with PC100. The answer is simply yes. But there are more factors than just the speed. Such as not all 256MB sticks work in all machines. It's not just the PC100/133 at issue there which is why you use the various configurators you find on the net. Bob
