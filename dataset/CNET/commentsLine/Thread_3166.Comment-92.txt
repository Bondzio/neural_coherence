i have a total of 10 usb harddrives.
of these five have failed.
in two cases it was the hdd and in the other three the electronics (all three were wd).
when the hdd failed it was out of warrenty so i just reformatted them and could reuse them.
the three with electronic problems all failed within warranty.
they all stopped beeing recognized by the os.
the first i got replaced by wd.
but with the two others i ran into problems.
i use them for backup of my server.
so the data on the drives is very sensitive.
it contains all information abot my bussiness.
thus it was impossible for me to send the usb hd for repair.
one thing to be aware of.
(oh, by the was, there was no error what so ever on the hdd it self).
from that lesson learned i have now changed strategy and have more or less stopped using the encased usb drives.
instead i have ordered a usb dock for sata drives.
i intend to use that dock as a &quot;tape station&quot; where sata drives will act as tapes.
two docks.
one for a weekly full backups (mirror) and one for all files changed since.
if that fails, with the mirror, i will just use full backup.
