i have just bought an external usb hard drive case that enables me to add in any ide hard drive.
whenever i put in my 40gb maxtor hard drive it gets recognised instantly on my windows xp service pack 2 system.
however when i swap the drive to my ibm 120gb hard drive it does not even get shown in device manager.
i put the ibm drive in another system but attached directly to the internal ide cable and the drive works fine.
i then reformatted the ibm drive but it is still not recognised when i place it back into the usb case and attach it to my system.
i did try changing around the drive jumpers but nothing seems to work.
does anyone have any ideas?
