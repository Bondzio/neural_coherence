In terms of pure speed, it's my belief that a smaller drive, with high rotational speed, a large cache and high seek times would suit your purpose.
Put simply, the less there is to look through the faster you accomplish the find.
With the rotational speed and low seek times once you've looked up what you want the quicker that happens.
Overall though, a small (60GB ish) solid state disk is the speediest option.
Apart from the most specialised HDD none beat them as they operate at almost teh speed of memory.
