<s> Hi there, My router seems to be frozen with all lights on. </s>
<s> With power cord in, I tried resetting per the dlink website, but after several seconds of holding the reset button in, it stays frozen. </s>
<s> I also tried something called a &quot;recovery reset&quot; and that didn't work either. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Try a newer router. </s>
<s> I was afraid that it would be too old. </s>
<s> I think that I bought it about 2 years ago. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure if that was too long. </s>
<s> I didn't know what the expiration date for it would be. </s>
<s> Just hoping for an alternative solution. </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
