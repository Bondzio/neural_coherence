Everyone here seems to be well versed in the online persuit of computer hardware, so here is my question: Where is the best place to buy a complete system online?
My concerns in order of importance are price, customization, and customer service.
I'm a casual gamer, at least moderate performance is a must.
I have shopped around at various places, but I want to make sure I'm getting the best deal I can.
Thank you in advance for any info/ideas.
