<s> I plug my Levelone WBR-3406TX wireless router into my Aztec DSL-600E modem and follow the instructions of the ISP help line. </s>
<s> It connects to the ISP but after 15 secs is thrown out. </s>
<s> The ISP help-line say that this is a very rare but known problem but this seems strange to me. </s>
<s> Anyone out there have a clue what to do apart from buying a new router from a different company? </s>
<s> Laptop: Dell 1525 W7. </s>
<s> Try it setup per the instructions in this forum. </s>
<s> I've lost count how many times that helped. </s>
<s> Thanks for taking the time to answer my prob. </s>
<s> In the end I downloaded the latest software for the router and hey presto here I am writing back to you from the middle of my back yard, sipping a very large bushmills and enjoying the dusk! </s>
<s> That is part of the advice at the top of the forum. </s>
<s> There is one more piece of advice that is not in the forum sticky. </s>
<s> &quot;If it works, don't fix it.&quot; Enjoy! </s>
