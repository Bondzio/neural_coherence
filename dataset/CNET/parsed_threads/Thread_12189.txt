<s> Win98SE P3 800 Mhz 256 RAM ; Mitsumi CR4804te CD/RW This has been a sturdy machine -- but a couple of lock ups and one blue screen happened. </s>
<s> could only restart each with the longheld press on the power button. </s>
<s> Now I can not play or explore a CD, though the D drive is visible in My Computer, and device manager sees no problem, functioning normally. </s>
<s> have already dealt the *.vxd's that can cause conflicts. </s>
<s> I searched for newer drivers but there is nothing newer than version 3.0d as far as I can tell. </s>
<s> What else can i check? </s>

<s> My dad's machine had from memory that same drive. </s>
<s> Its dead now and while dieing would cause lockup. </s>
<s> Windows also thought it worked. </s>
<s> Try another drive. </s>

<s> Hi Bob (When the machine locked up the first two times, the D drive was not in use. </s>
<s> I was trying to open a CD when it did lock the third time. </s>
<s> Now it is working. </s>
<s> I did not do anything much; just tried to scan the registry for errors -- none. </s>
<s> Then i thought to use the soundcard to play the CD -- Creative Live! </s>
<s> has a Playcenter which can find music sources. </s>
<s> The CD/RW drive played. </s>
<s> Then I re-installed WMPlayer 9 (which uses very little resources on this machine)and it started to find the songs too. </s>
<s> -- I can not explain the inaccessibility -- it was not just WMP because I could not open the drive through My Computer either. </s>
<s> You still believe that the drive is dying? </s>
<s> I don't play CDs much on it, nor use it as a ROM, but I do burn occasionally, with excellent results. </s>
<s> I realise it's now 5 years old, but it has not done that many miles. </s>
<s> Cheers Faldown </s>
