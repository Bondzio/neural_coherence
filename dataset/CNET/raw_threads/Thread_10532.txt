I decided to try and use it with Realplayer instead of the M:trip that comes with the m:robe. Basically it screwed up the m:robe. Now every time I turn it on the m:robe says &quot;invalid file, missing file&quot; and it won't even let me turn it off using the power button. I have to wait until it shuts off on it own with the preset shutoff time. Is there a way to use the m:robe as a drag and drop external hard drive and still have it play music normally? Does anyone at least have a way to format it so it works the way it was designed again? I shouldn't have messed with it I know.
