Both pc's are running win xp pro.What i want to know is what is the difference between a Switch and a Router.Will both let two pc's on the internet at the same time?Is there an advantage to using one or the other.I have a Linskys 4 port wired Router and a Netgear 4 port wired Switch, I just need to know what is the best option. Thanks Dan-n

If not, then you should use the Linksys router. Even if the modem is also a router, you could still use the Linksys, but you would need to set the modem as a bridge (turning off its routing capabilities) and thus letting the Linksys do all the routing. (This is more complicated than simply using the switch). So, you need to check what model modem you have and then check out its specs to see whether it functions as a router or is just a modem.
