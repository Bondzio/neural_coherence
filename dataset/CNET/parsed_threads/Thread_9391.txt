<s> I think my mom's monitor is about to die, as it randomly changes colors now and then. </s>
<s> A white screen will take on a purple tint, then green, then white, then off-white, ec. </s>
<s> I've been looking on newegg for a new monitor, and I'm wondering if maybe I should give her my monitor (ViewSonic E70 - LOVE it), and get the new one for myself. </s>
<s> I was originally thinking flat screen CRT: ViewSonic E70F+SB Metallic on Black 17&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116254 But then, I thought about some LCDs, and thought maybe I could get one of them. </s>

<s> However, I do watch my DVDs on my PC. </s>
<s> Is 25ms too slow for watching movies? </s>
<s> If so, how about 16ms? </s>
<s> I've never owned an LCD display (unless you count my Pocket PC). </s>
<s> I suppose I don't really /need/ the LCD, but it would be nice. </s>
<s> Thoughts/comments/suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks... Or even better yet, any suggestions on a different monitor that's better than the three listed above? </s>
<s> If it's CRT, I want flat screen if possible. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
