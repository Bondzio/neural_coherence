i had a somewhat similar issue with my dell laptop.
i bought the 1 gb jumpdrive traveller from best buy and it would not recognize on my laptop.
i exchanged it and the same thing resulted.
i do own an fmi 512 mb drive from compusa - works great; never a problem.
i did a test with a usb extension cable (came with my digital camera) and the jumpdrive - worked fine.
i found that the jumpdrive does not &quot;fit&quot; very well with my dell usb ports.
it's like a manufacturing defect.
it even looks a bit larger than the fmi.
the usb cable makes a very snug fit to the jumpdrive therefore works.
i will try this drive out on other pc's and if similar results - i will return it and get another manufacturer - maybe and fmi.
