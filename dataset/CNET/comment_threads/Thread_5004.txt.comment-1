OS 10.3.9, 1.07 GHz PPC G4, 256 MB Ram.
On ATA-3 Bus is the Matshita CD-r, DVD Rom drive that came with the iBook.
My DVD 109 is enclosed in a Macally 500BC enclosure, firewire.
System profiler shows it on the firewire hardware.
When I insert a blank CD, however, and drop files into Toast Titanium 6, & clik burn, I get word that the tray is open, even though it's closed.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
