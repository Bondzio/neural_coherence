<s> I found a solution. </s>
<s> Logically it makes no sense to me, but it worked so... Go to Control Panel. </s>
<s> Choose printer. </s>
<s> Then choose Add Printer. </s>
<s> ChooseAdd a local printer. </s>
<s> Click on Create a new port. </s>
<s> The default in the drop down box is Local Port. </s>
<s> Do not change that. </s>
<s> Click Next. </s>
<s> A dialogue box will appear asking for you to enter a port name. </s>
<s> Type in the \\computer name\printer name ie. </s>
<s> My computer's name is basement and the printer name is EpsonSty so I typed in \\basement\epsonsty Yahoo! </s>
<s> It worked. </s>
<s> Go figure! </s>
<s> I guess Microsoft thinks printers on a intranet are local. </s>
<s> Hope this helps someone else so they don't spend the hours I did on it! </s>
<s> // It worked for me. </s>
<s> Great fix - thanks for the work around. </s>
<s> This worked the first time for me too </s>
