Desktop with Windows XP Toshiba Laptop with Windows Vista Linksys Wireless G WRT54G Broadband Router Arris Cable Modem HP PSC1400 All in one Printer Having problems setting up a network environment allowing my laptop to access my printer connected to my desktop.
I want to be able to be in another room in the house, and print from my laptop without having to connect my laptop to the printer.
I have ran the network wizard and the laptop sees the main computer name, but that is all.
Any help will be greatly appreciated&gt; what do I need to make this work?
