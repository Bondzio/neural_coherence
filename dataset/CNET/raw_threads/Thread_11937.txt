I got a p965 neo motherboard from MSI and it has 4 memory slots. Currently I only have one 1gb ddr2 memory installed. The manual of the motherboard didn't discuss much about memory configuration. My Pc turns on but it beeps continuesly and doesn't go to POST.I have doubts that It might need a second memory or maybe the motherboard requires only a pair of memory. I am buying again a 1gb ddr2 memory but I wanna make sure my doubts really is true. Any suggestions? I would appreciate any reply. Emler_01

I heard rumors a long time ago that if the motherboard have 4 memory banks it should require 2 memories but if only 3 banks it can accept 1 memory but that was old days already.

The four slots provide capability to run two pairs of memory in Dual Channel Mode. One possible confusion when running Dual channel mode is that most mobos want one stick in the first slot and an identical stick in the third slot. The individual pairs must be the same size memory, but each pair can be a different capacity. Read the manual. Unfortunately some mobos use adjacent slots for the dual channels, thus one must read the manual. They all should run just fine with a single memory stick, but it will be in single channel mode. Some of the better mobos are rather fussy about which memory will run in their slots. Check the mobo mfr's website for approved [they tested] brands and models.

I just bought a second memory but unfortunately the first memory (Elpida brand) didn't work in my motherboard while my second memory works perfectly.Now I'm convince it will run only 1 stick memory module in 4 slot motherboard. The one I'm figuring out right now is i couldn't boot my original windows.Maybe I need reinstalling it and re activate it again. Anyway thank you guys for your help.

They are the correct size -- actually identical to what came with stock with the computer. When I go to bios after installing, it will not acknowledge the 4th slot -- it says not installed. I've tried reseating it and rearanged the sticks to find out if it was a faulty memory stick. The did nothing. Is it likely that the 4th slot is some how damaged or is there something not right with the puter to only take 3g's of RAM. I have an AMD64 Duel processor.
