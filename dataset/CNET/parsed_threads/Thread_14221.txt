<s> I received 3 different emails today claiming they were from fedex... each said they could not deliver a package becasue there was an error in the address. </s>
<s> They requested that I check the attached mailing label. </s>
<s> I didn't open for fear it was a virus.. </s>
<s> I am, however expecting a package and wondering if this may related to that... somehow I doubt it. </s>
<s> I happened to receive a mail like that also. </s>
<s> While I'm sure I don't expect any package brought by Fedex from the USA to Europe. </s>
<s> So just consider it malware. </s>
<s> Very good not to click it. </s>
<s> It's even better to not even open it. </s>
<s> In case of doubt, I look at the source in Outlook Express. </s>
<s> That doesn't open it in the regular sense. </s>
