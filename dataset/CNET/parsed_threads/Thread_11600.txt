<s> I have recently bought a new hard drive to replace the old one for my computer. </s>
<s> I installed it and in the &quot;My computer&quot; window it shows that I have two hard drives installed when I really only have one. </s>
<s> What does this mean? </s>
<s> It shows that there are files stored on this &quot;second&quot; hard drive. </s>
<s> Is there a way to delete this &quot;fake&quot; drive? </s>
<s> the manufacturer/vendor install restore/master cd that came with your computer to install windows? </s>
<s> If so, that cd might have created the second harddrive (partition) by default because that's where it keeps its files in case you want to add/remove components or need to replace a corrupt file. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
