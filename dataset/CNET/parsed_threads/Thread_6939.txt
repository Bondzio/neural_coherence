<s> I have A celeron 1.7 GHz PC 128 MB RAM, using XP and Windows 98 on different partitions. </s>
<s> Yesterday i had just been trying to upgrade BIOS-&quot;Award softwares&quot;-using motherboard-&quot;Gigabyte&quot; cd.It asked for some .bin file from MB cd, so I searched and okayed. </s>
<s> it then asked to restart the system so restarted... now the real problem started, now system does not start at all. </s>
<s> i cant even go upto bios setting prompt. </s>
<s> it says &quot;BIOS Checksum error&quot; and &quot;boot disk failure insert system disk and press enter&quot;.Inserting motherboard cd or XP cd doesn't help it as system doesnot detect cd-drive and says boot disc failure. </s>
<s> when i insert the floppy it detects the floppy but cant boot from it, says again &quot;disc failure pls insert system disc and press enter, and that too doesnot work. </s>
<s> I am screwed.... can any1 suggest any solution.... i think a few settings are missing.. but i dont have ny idea... plz help </s>
<s> and you can use a boot floppy to see what happens. </s>
<s> Have you tried the BIOS jumper to reset the BIOS to the default??? </s>
<s> Is this a Gigabyte mobo with the dual BIOS??? </s>
<s> If so read the manual as to how to get the backup BIOS to be used. </s>
<s> All Mfr's say to only update the BIOS if it is needed to correct a specific problem that you are having and that the new BIOS is intended to correct. </s>
<s> I know that Robert tells everyone to update the BIOS, but it can be a risk. </s>
<s> The Gigabyte dual BIOS systems that I have seen have the CMOS chips [2 of them] soldered in, thus getting a new chip is not likely, unless mobo is sent back to Gigabyte. </s>
<s> Let us know what you find out. </s>
<s> Some MB show Checksum error after update. </s>
<s> You then have go into BIOS and redo all of the settings and save them and exit and restart. </s>
