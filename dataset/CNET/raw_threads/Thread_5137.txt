I am deciding between these setups: 2 160GB hard drives at 5400 RPM for $215 2 100GB hard drives at 7200 RPM for $150 (already own first one) The good thing about the 160GB option is that I could use the old 100 GB drive for backup, and get an enclosure for it. What's making this decision difficult is the drive speeds. RAID 0 will speed things up, but will 5400 RPM be enough for games like Team Fortress 2? Running Vista Home Premium, too. Greatly appreciate the help, Brian

I just received a 750GB SATA 7200RPM drive today for 103 bucks. see http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WD7500AACS-R&cat=HDD For your one drive I could have 2 750's vs. your pair of 160GB drives. Why is your price so far out of line? Bob

But if game performance is an issue don't look to hard disk speeds to get a boost. That only helps on the initial load time and no where else. Hope this is clear enough. -&gt; Areas that do help. RAM and better video chipsets. Bob

For the 160 GB drives, I think I'm stuck there too, since I don't think you can buy the special secondary hard drive bracket that replaces a cd drive. Thanks for the help! I will quit thinking about RPM speed, and focus on how much memory I want.
