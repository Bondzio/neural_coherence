<s> Hi, i am trying to export songs, mp3's from my computer onto my Samsung A920. </s>
<s> I am using my belkin and my transflash card to put music on to so i can then put it on my cell phone. </s>
<s> However when ever i try and move an mp3 file onto the transflash card it tells me that there is write protection and to try and use another disk! </s>
<s> i have no idea what that means and i need to know how i can remove the write-protection on the mp3's so i can get them onto my cell phone.... </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP! </s>
<s> thank you. </s>
<s> Click Properties. </s>
<s> Look at the bottom of the window. </s>
<s> Uncheck Read Only. </s>
<s> I did what you said above and it is still giving me the same message that it is write-protected, and when i go back to properties it has been changed back to read-only. </s>
<s> moving them to the HD first. </s>
<s> hi my name is maria and I am having the ecxact same problem i've tried to do what you told him but it's not working can you please help me i'm desprate. </s>
<s> It is not too hard to download MP3s to your phone. </s>
<s> First you will need to have a USB-Micro SD Adapter. </s>
<s> Circuit City sells them. </s>
<s> Plug it into your USB port. </s>
<s> Make your the Micro-Transflash adapter is not set to lock (this is what enables write protection, it is on the side of the adapter). </s>
<s> Copy files into the Media folder created by your phone on the disk. </s>
<s> Now you can play those MP3s. </s>
<s> E-Mail me at csamples@sw.rr.com for info if you need help. </s>
<s> I had the same problem.There is a button on an adapter for your trans flash card with position lock.If your is on lock just slide it on the other side and you should be able to put music on your trans flash card. </s>
<s> I tried going in properties and uncheck &quot;read only&quot; but iT did not help. </s>
<s> I hope this help to all with thiss issue </s>
<s> It doesn't work!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The wikipedia helps you understand this. </s>
<s> Here's the article. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniSD_Card Bob </s>
<s> Are these mp3 files dowloaded files that you paid for. </s>
<s> Have embeded code for preventing copies. </s>
<s> I had the same problem and i just forgot to unlock the lock button on my mp3. </s>
<s> TIP: before pluging your mp3 make sure its unlocked!!! </s>
<s> Thats is. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work then you are an idiot! </s>
<s> I just received a 2GB microSD (Trans Flash) and installed it into my Motorola V3i (D&G) in order to have my MP3 for ringtones and for on the spot videos. </s>
<s> The phone detected the card and said it was unformatted, &quot;do you want to format?&quot;. </s>
<s> No matter what I kept failing. </s>
<s> Remember, first use, brand new SanDisk. </s>
<s> I then took out the card, placed it in the adapter, switch by default in the open position and tried to format using my built in reader. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> Dazzle high speed reader, same thing. </s>
<s> My question. </s>
<s> Is this &quot;electronicaly locked&quot; or a malfunction (bad batch of cards? </s>
<s> Maybe SanDisk can help here. </s>
<s> Colonel Terry </s>
<s> thanx so much i haad the same thing i just took it off lock but it was with my mp3 neways thank you god bless you </s>
<s> Good evening Colonel I am in a similar boat. </s>
<s> I have the 1GB micro sd card and I get a write protected error each time i try and load. </s>
<s> I formatted it on my phone (VX8300) initially and the lock is not on. </s>
<s> I tried 2 different cards and two different sd adapters. </s>
<s> I too have the dazzle high speed reader. </s>
<s> could this be the problem? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I used a new GXT data stick and copied a lot of files to it in one go. </s>
<s> Then when I went back to add more and delete a couple it wouldn't let me do either, said it was write protected. </s>
<s> There are no buttons on the data stick itself, there is nothing in the properties box to check or uncheck or that says it is write protected. </s>
<s> it just says to remove the write protect to keep on using but doesn't tell me how and there seems to be no way to do this. </s>
<s> Help please, please. </s>

<s> by tchanter I had the same problem.There is a button on an adapter for your trans flash card with position lock.If your is on lock just slide it on the other side and you should be able to put music on your trans flash card. </s>
<s> Thank you my friend!You Really saved me!! </s>
<s> !^^ </s>
<s> There seems to be an issue here thats not being resolved. </s>
<s> Many out there clearly have a problem with removing write protection. </s>
<s> They are not idiots. </s>
<s> Unfortunately some people giving advice are not very good listeners. </s>
<s> so for you in particular Id like to state the facts. </s>
<s> Unchecking read only, though cute, does not work Downloading to hd is another cul-de-sak And the most obvious suggestion, unlock sd card, is obvious. </s>
<s> So whats the problem, well its most likely that the write protection message is in fact a smoke screen to hide the fact that your card reader is at fault, alot of multi card readers seem to be the problem, other than that there really is very little else that can go wrong. </s>
<s> Swap card readers and find out. </s>
<s> Regards cnet 2007 </s>
<s> Good Morning, I'm having the same problem. </s>
<s> The tab on my card is not locked, and I've tried with two different card readers. </s>
<s> Also, when the card is in my digital camera, the photos save to it just fine. </s>
<s> Do you have any other thoughts on this? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Sorry to hear your having problems. </s>
<s> This really is a pain..Whenever I had an issue with write protection I always managed to solve it by changing card readers, but it sounds like youve done this. </s>
<s> How about going into a dealer and ask to try out a spangly new card reader there and then, take your memmory card and try and download in the shop. </s>
<s> Most shops will let you try before you buy, especially if you say something like &quot; I dont trust buying online any more. </s>
<s> we should all support our local retailers&quot;. </s>
<s> You know the kind of thing. </s>
<s> Anyway it seems like its really hit or miss out there regarding writ-pro, with some people sailing fullsteam ahead without a sign of an iceberg whilst others resort to the WHY ME senario so good luck and remember when technology goes bad its not personal. </s>
<s> Dont get angry, get even </s>
<s> I just had the same thing happen to me. </s>
<s> I was using the card reader that is built into my Canon MP830 printer. </s>
<s> Then I remembered that my printer has a built in read/write lock in the printer itself. </s>
<s> I went into the setup menus for my printer and changed the card reader from read only mode to read/write mode. </s>
<s> Then I put the card in and I was able to copy files to my mini-sd card. </s>
<s> Chances are that if you are having this issue, your card reader is set in a &quot;read only&quot; mode. </s>
<s> -Thanks, RP </s>
<s> ok gheres a link to a video i made last ngiht on how to fix the wrror if u watch and like please rate and leave comment thanks http://www.metacafe.com/watch/786206/how_to_put_music_on_cell_phone/ </s>
<s> I'm not sure why the rest of you are continuing with this chain as if the problem has not been solved. </s>
<s> If your Sandisk is write protected and you've already set it to &quot;unlock&quot;, then you card reading device is most likely in read only mode. </s>
<s> Give the dude some credit! </s>
<s> I have several brands of data stick all of a suden my computer said they are write protect,how do I rmove it </s>

<s> I've been having the same problem with write protection. </s>
<s> I finally managed to transfer an album onto my Micro card when I changed the card adapter. </s>
