Hi, I plugged my seagate portable drive into my mac and It found straight away and I could access the files. However, on the second attempt the mac reported that the drive was not recognized. I tried on my pc and it found the hardware but was asking me to format drive. I have over 200 gb of stuff on there and I cant access it. How do I recover all the files without great expense as it is mainly films and music!

Opening the Seagate case to get the drive out? In closing did you try these titles found with google? GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY Bob
