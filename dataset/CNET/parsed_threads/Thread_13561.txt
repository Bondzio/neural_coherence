Whenever I buy games, I do look at the system requirements and the recommended requirements, however some games like World of Warcraft and Far Cry has a recommended spec that is close to my computer's specs, but when I play those kind of games, I experience lots of lags, and my computer won't be able to handle graphics to the max. </s>
