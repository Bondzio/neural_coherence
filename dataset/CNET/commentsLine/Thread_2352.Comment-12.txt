well, onto my state attorney general complaint.....gotta document this lovely road trip....i havent given up yet as there are still a few avenues to go down.
ill keep you all posted.... what i need from everyone affected by the problems with the f1503, only if you would be willing, is to email me at hpf1503watchers@hotmail.com with your first and last name, return email address, how old was the monitor when you started having problems, and did you contact hp.
what i am trying to do is document an actual list of people affected so i can validate a problem exists, and so that if i can get some action from hp or someone who can represent us i can make sure that all of us are included in making a choice to pursue.
as you all know hp ignores forums and byline names but real names and email addresses equal real people with a real problem.
i will not use the information in any way other than to get an accurate count and if any opportunity presents itself i will email you to explain what the next step maybe and see if you want to continue with the ones who do.
any help you can all give me will just make our case stronger for trying to secure representation or support.
my name is ann baldetta and the above email address is strictly for f1503 victims.
thanks to all who are out there and dont give up yet, i live about 20 minutes from the palo alto corporate headquarters and if nothing else i may have to drop by and say hi to hp one of these days in person to lodge our complaints.
