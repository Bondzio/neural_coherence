Because of the difference between 40 and 80 pin cable this ONLY works, when it works, to solve CD drive conflicts using 40 pin cables.
Drives to master/slave settings, then plug the MIDDLE plug to the motherboard and each end to a drive.
Of course placement of the drives may not allow the shorter end to reach.
It gives both drives direct access to the port on the mobo and cuts down on any cross cable electrical interference between the drives.
