Just after Windows XP Pro launches on my computer, the motherboard begins to let out one long annoying beep and it doesn't stop. I have no idea what is causing it and I can't get it to quit with the beep. It is really loud and makes it so I can't use my PC out of sheer frustration. What is the problem and how can I fix it? Thanks!
