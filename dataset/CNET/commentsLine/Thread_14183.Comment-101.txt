in was 1982. the 8th grade science fair had just finished and a friend built a sinclair zx81 kit computer that he failed to get working.
but that didn't matter to me and my friends; our love affair with these new machines was set in stone.
the atari vcs was at it's peak despite the release of a *very* disappointing rendition of pac-man.
me and my friends were already &quot;computer crazy&quot;.
not one of us owned a game machine like the vcs or odyssey-2 (intellivision was still a year away).
we were holding out for full-fledged computers.
after prolonged begging and extolling the virtues of the &quot;commodore vic-20&quot; to get my parents, my high-school drop-out step-father revealed that he has been looking at computers and found the &quot;atari 400&quot; to be the superior machine.
i disagreed and we immediately went to the mall to compare the two.
the computer store in the mall had an atari 400 parked in front running a near perfect rendition of pac-man that was attracting customers like flies.
the 400's flat membrane keyboard was a real turn-off, but when i learned it came with nearly three times as much memory (16k) as the vic-20 (which, despite its name, only came with 5k), and seeing the quality of the game that was running, i quickly concluded the atari-400 was the better machine.
rare was the time i admitted my step-father was right, so he immediately bought a 400 on the spot.
to our disappointment though, they were out of pac-man cartridges, so i had to settle for a low-quality game stored on cassette tape called &quot;maze of death&quot;.
in the years to come, i taught myself how to program in basic and even started dabbling in &quot;assembly language&quot;.
by the time i reached college, i had a huge jump-start on the other students and aced every programming course.
