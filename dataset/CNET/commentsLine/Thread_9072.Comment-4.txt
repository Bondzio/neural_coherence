if the added hard drive in some manner has caused the cpu to run at a higher temperature, it is possible that the cpu is being internally throttled down due to the higher temperature.
the stuttering would be typical.
maybe you blocked airflow in some way.
the drive adds more heat, but that alone should not do it.
did you accidently disable a fan?
?
