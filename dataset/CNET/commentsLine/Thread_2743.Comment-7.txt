but you have an amd system so you as the os installer get to find and install all the lovely drivers for motherboard, video, audio, usb and more since microsoft doesn't do that.
if not, i'd expect the machine to be very unpredictable.&quot; you're not saying amd is &quot;bad&quot; hardware are you :-)?
i only have amd, and have seldom had any problems!
but then, i also automatically install the drivers for the hardware because i know (or figure) i have to.
maybe it is a good thing i haven't been spoiled by mico$oft, if they are automatically loading drivers for intel based devices.
if i know i have to install all the drivers for all my devices, then i won't forget, or have to figure out, which one i need to install.
