Thanks for the info.
I was planning on upgrading my video card to DX 10 to play &quot;World in Conflict&quot; thats coming out in September.
No way I'm gonna fork over the cash for a new OS, DX 10 card, power supply, and probably a cooling unit to boot.
There's still a lot of DX 9 games out there to keep me satisfied for awhile.
