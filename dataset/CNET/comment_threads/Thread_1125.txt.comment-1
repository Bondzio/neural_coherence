Hi, I am really green in networking, I have never made a network myself.
I have a desktop PC sitting on my desktop, having a cable modem connected to its Ethernet card.
The problem is I bought a laptop and I would like to connect the two PCs, without unplugging the cable modem, so I can use internet on both computers.
Do I need to buy anything to do this?
What else should I do?
Both PCs run WinXP Pro.
