it was a real workhorse, too -- until it died.
i googled your brother mfc-5890cn, and saw that cnet really savaged it in their review (although it got fairly decent user reviews).
i could have sworn the scanning surface of my epson 3490 was legal-size (which would have made multifunction devices with 8.5&quot;x11.7&quot; scanning surfaces (f.ex.
cnet's top-rated lexmark s305 &amp; s605) problematic choices.
however, i finally got out a measuring tape to measure the 3490's scanning surface -- and it's only about 9&quot;x12&quot; (to fit european a4 paper originals?)
-- so it's not that big after all.
no big immediate rush on getting a new printer or scanner for me, so i can wait for a really good sale or coupon special (or the next time i get a big amazon.com credit from sending off my oldest's college textbooks to their buyback program!
).
