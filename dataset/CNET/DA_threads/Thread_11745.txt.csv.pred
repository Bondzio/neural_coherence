1.1.2	I work for a company that produces and refurbishes parts for a large printer company .	St
1.1.3	Some of our jobs involve flashing codes onto printer cpu boards .	St
1.1.4	This usually requires installing and uninstalling several hundred boards .	St
1.1.5	As you can imagine , the cables become worn out rather quickly , so we are constantly replacing machines .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone know of any sources for various sized extension cables ?	Ques
1.1.7	Most of the connectors are side by side ( instead of stacked ) varying from 4 pin to 12 pin .	St
1.1.8	I think replacing cables would be a much simpler solution as opposed to the hacked up splicing we 've been trying .	St
1.1.9	All thoughts and ideas are appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	The connectors are basically like what you find on CPU fans .	St
1.2.2	There are some 2 , 3 and 4 pins .	St
1.2.3	A 12 pin resembles three 4 pins layed side by side .	St
1.2.4	I hope that makes sense .	St
1.3.1	Here 's where we found POGO PINS to be kink on our test fixtures .	St
1.3.2	Maybe you just need your engineers to make up a better system .	St
1.3.3	Q .	St
1.3.4	Does anyone know of any sources for various sized extension cables ?	Ques
1.3.5	A .	St
1.3.6	Sorry , no .	Res

1.4.1	Is it possible to replace/repair the actual ends themselves ?	Ques
1.4.2	Basically , the wires kink and break at the connector from all the pushing and pulling .	St
1.4.3	If we could remove the ends and reattach them 1/2 & quot ; up the wire , that might at least make the machines last a bit longer .	Sug
1.5.1	But the answer is simply yes .	St
1.5.2	Any engineer or tech can do this .	St
1.5.3	It 's just a cable .	St
1.5.4	Make your own ?	Ques
