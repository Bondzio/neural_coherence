1.1.1	I have an epson workforce 630 .	St
1.1.2	I am using it to temporarily replace our main office copier/fax machine until its repaired .	St
1.1.3	Initially I could not send or receive faxes , but then I was instructed to turn off Error Correcting Mode ( ECM ) and turn off v.3.4 .	St
1.1.4	After I did this I was able to receive faxes and I was able to send a test fax to epson which they received , but when I try to fax to other numbers it does not go through .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas as to why this might happen ?	Ques
1.2.1	I 've found some machines will not work with each other and the fax does not go through .	St
1.2.2	You may find folk that DEMAND AN ANSWER but the simple truth is & quot ; it does not always work. & quot ; Bob	St
1.3.1	Actually , from my point of view you make a big problem of this .	St
1.3.2	it 's much more easier to use an online service for this stuff .	St
1.3.3	Like http : //www.popfax.com/ for example - those are great guys .	Polite
1.3.4	They just give you everything you need about faxes and they have really low prices and a free trial period , so ... you can just try it .	St
1.4.1	I looked at the site and did not find ONE word about the problems folk have with FAX .	St
1.4.2	This issue is not new , but when you have a product to sell , you may not want to talk about the problem areas .	St
