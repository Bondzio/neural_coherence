<s> I have a 2GB flash drive, vendor unknown, (bought from Ebay), 4 computers all running under Win XP Home, with two desktops and two laptops. </s>
<s> The problem: I put two folders, each containing several MP3 files on the flash drive called &quot;medialink&quot; and &quot;mrKeen&quot;. </s>
<s> The drive is written using my IBM desktop. </s>
<s> After writing the files, I read them to see that they are OK. Then I eject the flash drive using the ejection software in the System Tray, then replug the drive and look again at the two folders. </s>
<s> Now one of them is empty! </s>
<s> Where did the files go? </s>
<s> How do I retain them? </s>
<s> It didn't used to work this way. </s>
<s> How do I determine the cause? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> Simplest is to reboot your PC and replug in the drive. </s>
<s> When you eject the media, versus just pulling it out which should be ok for flash unless you changed the drive config, the PC disconnects the drive. </s>
<s> When you replug in, PC takes a while to detect it and the media. </s>
<s> You may have checked for folder before the autoconfig finished. </s>
<s> Faulty even. </s>
<s> Did you do a chkdsk on the drive already? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I did a check of the flash drive by starting My Computer &gt; Select drive &gt; Properties &gt; Tools &gt; Error Checking. </s>
<s> It said the drive was OK. </s>
<s> But, I'm not sure it is OK, because I can do the same things with another Flash Drive, and there are much more predictable results. </s>
<s> Does anyone have suggestions about how to thoroughly check a Flash Drive to verify its condition? </s>
<s> Are there certain software utilities which can be employed, available somewhere on the Internet? </s>
<s> By the way, I did reboot the computer and replug the Flash Drive. </s>
<s> The missing files are still missing. </s>
<s> I found a utility (Flash Check v1.08, freebie) on the internet. </s>
<s> I ran tests on all my flash drives, and all had zero errors except the NoName 2GB drive which was giving me trouble. </s>
<s> This drive gave me about 260 errors! </s>
<s> This Flash Check Utility seems to be a very handy item. </s>
<s> If anyone knows of a better checker, please let me know. </s>
<s> I also observed that the board and USB connector on this troublesome drive is somewhat loose in its case. </s>
<s> I suspect the following: I have a clock radio next to my bed which permits playing MP3 files stored on a USB Flash Drive. </s>
<s> I had used this drive the night before. </s>
<s> It is quite possible that sometime during the night I hit this drive while it was still plugged into the radio and did it some damage. </s>
<s> It sticks out like a &quot;sore thumb&quot; and could easily be harmed. </s>
<s> The lesson learned: Don't leave the flash drive in the machine over night if it is within reach. </s>
<s> Your flash drive seems to be logically wounded. </s>
<s> It is probably due to fatal virus attacks, file corruption or operating system failure. </s>
<s> I suggest you to consult data recovery experts www.eprovided.com who can not only fix your problem but can retrieve your data in minimum cost. </s>
<s> Consulting doesnt cost! </s>
<s> Just wanted to add that i am suffering a similar problem (based on two XP Pro systems). </s>
<s> I thought that it would be a good idea to use a USB flash drive as a backup for my digital camera. </s>
<s> Thought it would be more useful for file sharing. </s>
<s> I have tried two different drives (16gb and a 32gb) and the same thing happens. </s>
<s> I have always taken them out correctly, used all the scan disks and recovery utilites, and still no luck. </s>
<s> Folders randomly empty themselves, or leave corrupt files. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on what is going wrong would be really helpful. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Maybe I think you should scan your disk firstly by recovery software. </s>
<s> If it could find the data and preview, I think it will recover it. </s>
<s> I have the similar experience as you. </s>
<s> I download a demo version of EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard and try to scan. </s>
<s> It is fair to know if I should buy their software. </s>
<s> I think this is a good way to try if you can get the data back. </s>
