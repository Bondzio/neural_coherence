1.1.1	I just purchased a Dell 9100 and am about to set it up .	St
1.1.2	I saw a post on this board a while back from someone that had great advice for basic things to do regarding backups and other general setups for new computers .	St
1.1.3	I have searched for it but ca n't find it again .	St
1.1.4	Does anyone know where this can be found and point me in the right direction ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	The new PC should have come with a restoral CD , one that will restore the PC to day one , put it back like the day you bought it .	St
1.2.2	All other data such as documents , pictures , email addresses , emails , favorites , etc .	St
1.2.3	can simply be burned to optical media .	St
1.2.4	After a catastrophic failure you can run the Restoral CD , then copy the other files saved to optical media back to the PC .	St
1.2.5	I find this is much easier than finding a & quot ; backup & quot ; program to run .	St
1.2.6	Most backup programs tend to be a hassle .	St
1.2.7	At my site below I have a great little utility called OE Freebie Backup .	St
1.2.8	It will back up your email account , everything there , in one or two clicks .	St
1.2.9	Scroll down to the Free Software link .	St
1.2.10	Wayne Wrinkles only go where smiles have been - JB Click here to see the CNet faces , learn a little about telephones , internet connections , spyware removal , and download free software .	St

1.4.1	thanks .	Polite

1.6.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.2	That was very useful information .	St
1.6.3	Question about creating my own system backup/recovery CD .	St
1.6.4	Do I need a product like Norton Ghost or can I create a system backup CD/DVD with the native tools that come on the Dell 9100 .	St
1.6.5	Excuse my ignorance , not a complete newbie , but not a real techie either .	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the reply and the link to your information .	St
1.8.1	Using the native software should be OK for simple file backups but to do cloning ( that 's taking an exact copy of the hard drive ) one of the commercial applications would probably serve you better .	St
1.8.2	I use Acronis .	St
1.8.3	It satifies my requirements for both cloning and incremental backups .	St
1.8.4	Some people swear by Ghost but I stay away from all Symantic applications ( had very bad experience ) .	St
1.8.5	There are several others out there .	St
1.8.6	It just depends on what you want to accomplish .	St
1.8.7	Some do n't clone , others do .	St
1.8.8	If you 're going to backup a lot of data I would recommend an external hard drive .	St
1.8.9	Just do n't leave it in-line after you 're done with it .	St
1.8.10	and life goes on ... Jack	St
