1.1.1	I need to find which product is on the market that offer the best speed in internet download.	St
1.1.2	that will do well with video & voice conference.	St
1.1.3	That work well on a GSM network that offer Wimax or 3G.	St
1.2.1	Since you can only use the cards they allow, list those here for members to comment on.	St
1.2.2	I already gave my reply as to which I'd use.	St
1.3.1	We can buy card or USB and take it to them for programming or just put in the chip.	St
1.3.2	So its not a matter being limited by there own cards that the company / providers provide.	St
1.4.1	My advice is to take the free card.	St
1.4.2	Ask those that use the service you are looking at and if it plays out like it does here, one card is just like the other.	St
1.4.3	No winner.	St
1.5.1	OK then.	St
1.5.2	But i was just looking for better options apart from there's.	St
1.6.1	My buddies that have such cards have run such speed tests and it's like a horse race that one or the other wins.	St
1.6.2	Not a single device wins all the time.	St
1.6.3	I'm assuming you meant 'better' as in more speed.	St
