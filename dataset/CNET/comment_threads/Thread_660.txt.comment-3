I am not quite sure how it works, but a friend of mine found an adaptor that plugs into the 1/8 inch port on your phone.
The idea was to be able to use your home phone in conjunction with your cell phone so that you do not have wasted minutes at the end of the month.
However, his idea was to use the device in his car, with a power inverter so basically, he hooked up a home phone set in his car.
I saw this and wondered the same thing your...since all a computer does is listen to the beeps and such, this should work on a computer as well.
I have yet to find the hardware, but am still looking.
