8617	0	65530	777764	NR	briannajoy	2/20/05 3:46 AM	1.10887116E12	Need advice on upgrading	I'm not super computer savvy but I have a amd motherboard with a nforce 2 chipset, a xp 2200+ cpu, 768mb ram, and a geforce titanium 4200 (I think) video card. I need to upgrade my computer, it runs really slow and I play some up to date games, this isn't cutting it. First off, should I upgrade everything? I was thinking of going with a new motherboard with a nforce 4 chipset, 64 3000+ processor, adding a gig of ram and upgrading to a 6600 gt video card. This won't be cheap, but I was wondering, is there a way to maybe take the price down a notch without sacrificing too much performance? Any suggestions? Or if you know of a place where I can get these compontents cheap (I know about price watch) or something? any advice/help/suggestions is appreciated

It is only alittle bit more and probly worth it. Also make sure you get a skt.939 mobo and CPU. U also don't need the best mobo either. Don't get an ASUS one just cause of the name. They are basically all the same. Make sure it has an AGP slot, atleast 4 PCI slots and 4 dual channel DIMM slots

I've seen and fixed machines so hosed up they would take over five minutes to boot, then five minutes for Explorer to load. Forget about surfing.

Proffitt	2/24/05 11:59 AM	1.10924634E12	Hey jcrobso...	&quot;Disadvantages: * Youre currently not able to take full advantage of the technology because the software vendors havent made the switch from 32-bit to 64-bit processors.&quot; Given I have such 64-bit machines running on XP's 32-bit system and I can use VIRTUAL DUB and it kicks into a 64-BIT mode PLUS XP's SP2 uses some 64-bit extenstions, that statement needs a rewrite. Also, I have Suse 9.3 in it's full 64-bit glory. Again, I wonder what your definition of full advantage is. Your passage is much like what was written when we were transitioning from the 80286 to the 386. In fact it is! Bob
8617	8	65530	995327	993184	jcrobso	2/25/05 8:14 AM	1.10931924E12	True!!!!!!	Thanks for the Info Bob. I have an XP64 Pro beta on 1 PC now ( waiting for my copy of RC1 from MS) regular XP SP2 on the other, got Suse 9.3 but haven't had the time to insall it yet, glad to hear that it runs great. One of the reasons I have reg XP SP2 on one of the AMD 64 is it gives me a way to compare same OS on different processors, This will end as soon as I gat a chance to install the Suse or the XPRC1.
