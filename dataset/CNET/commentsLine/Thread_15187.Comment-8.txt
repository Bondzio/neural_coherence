that windows 98 can't handle more than 512 mb of ram.
it doesn't say anything about ram errors.
you're on the wrong track, that seems sure.
another point.
it's recommended to do a clean install of the os when replacing the motherboard by a another one.
the old motherboard drivers installed for the old board might give an error like this.
did you do a clean install?
you don't tell anything about that.
