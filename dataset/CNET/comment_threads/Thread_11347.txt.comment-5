Hi Bob &gt;&gt;I'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by ISPs.&lt;&lt; No this is not the case for me.
&gt;&gt;You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product&lt;&lt;.
What do mean I can try ?
could you please explain ?
&gt;&gt;As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more?&lt;&lt; Yes I konw that port 20 is a data port on a server side.
When the client uses active mode, the server only needs to receive connections on port 21, so forwarding only port 21 is sufficient for that.
&gt;&gt;Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP&lt;&lt; This is also not my case.
