<s> I recently installed windows 8 on my laptop and have had some problems burning dvds and playing them. </s>
<s> Windows burning software would not work burn them and neither would imgburn or dvdflick. </s>
<s> So i downloaded Freemake video converter and successfully burnt 30 dvds onto tesco dvd-r disks. </s>
<s> Every single one plays without problems on my dvd player and xbox 360 but not one will play on my laptop. </s>
<s> They are on Pal. </s>
<s> The computer views them as blank dvd-rs and says they are empty not sure how this can be though as they are dvd-rs not dvd-rw so should not be re-writable. </s>
<s> I have tried updating the drivers for the drive but windows says it is upto date. </s>
<s> I also uninstalled the drivers and re installed but still no luck. </s>
<s> Any help on this would be appreciated Thanks! </s>
<s> http://www.howtogeek.com/127774/how-to-play-dvds-on-windows-8/ tells how to fix this. </s>
<s> This may confuse folk but DVD Player Software is not free. </s>
<s> VLC Player is free due to where the folk that write it are and the laws of the land there. </s>
<s> Since Microsoft would have had to pay a license fee, many Windows 8 versions can't play DVDs. </s>

<s> It's by design that they don't play: Windows 8 doesn't come with DVD-player software. </s>
<s> A retail DVD won't play either. </s>
<s> http://www.extremetech.com/computing/142796-how-to-play-dvds-and-blu-ray-discs-in-windows-8 tells more. </s>
<s> But it shouldn't show as empty, I think. </s>
<s> Can you read a data-DVD? </s>

<s> You might want to try Nero software. </s>
<s> It works well on my Windows 8 computer. </s>
<s> I have a $20 LG DVD/CD drive there. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for the reply's, i should have been more clearer in my first post but i have VLC installed and i can play retail DVDs on the computer through VLC. </s>
<s> When i insert a burnt DVD-R autoplay opens and gives me 2 options one is to burn disk and the other is do nothing. </s>
<s> The burnt DVD-Rs also wont open directly in VLC as it says error please check log. </s>
<s> So basically everything works fine accept on burnt DVDs which show as empty, it literally offers the space on the disk to copy to. </s>
<s> I will try nero now and see if they will play but would really like to find a solution to this situation as i have burnt 30 DVDs that wont open Thanks! </s>
<s> If the person making said DVD didn't make a single closed season or used that drag and drop method to create the DVD, all this should happen! </s>

<s> Hi bob, i made the DVDs using freemake video converter, i opened freemake, choose video at the top and browsed to the desired movie file. </s>
<s> I then clicked to DVD and choose settings Pal and burn to disk when finished converting. </s>
<s> They all converted then burnt to the DVD-Rs and as far as i could see the disks where finalized. </s>
<s> So the problem is freemake? </s>
<s> not correctly burning the disks? </s>
<s> although they do play on the xbox and dvd player. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> But why create a Video DVD at all if you have the source file? </s>
<s> With the source file on a DATA DVD it can be played in many apps and I would not lose resolution. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The reason i created DVDs was so i could play the movies directly in my xbox and DVD player but also be able to play them on the computer. </s>
<s> I gets awkward when you have to use a VGI cable to watch your movies on the TV. </s>
<s> Basically i just wanted to be able to play the movies on the computer, DVD player and xbox which is why i didn't just keep the avi, mp4 and mkv files on disk. </s>
<s> Something in the creation is broken. </s>
<s> You can play the files directly on the computer so for now it appears you are able to do what you need. </s>
<s> Maybe not what you want. </s>
<s> In closing, I use DVD FLICK to create such DVDs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, DVDflick wouldn't work for me, it make the video_ts and audio_ts files but would not successfully create a dvd. </s>
<s> I can still do what i need but its abit of a inconvenience so will give nero a shot. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> think i could just convert the files to the required format then play them on xbox through the media player? </s>
<s> think that would avoid the need to create a DVD. </s>
<s> I can create those to drop onto a DVD in a custom way. </s>
<s> Most of the time I have DVD Flick create an .ISO so I can create a few copies or even better, play the .ISO in VLC PLAYER. </s>
<s> In closing, I use IMGBURN to create the DVD from the .ISO. </s>
