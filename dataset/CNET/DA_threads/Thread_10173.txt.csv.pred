1.2.1	Try using another new &quot;namebrand&quot; media to burn to.	St
1.2.2	If it fails, then reset burning speed to a lower level on yet another new media disk.	St
1.2.3	FYI - Its not good to have both Nero and ROxio on the same system, pick one and stick with it.	St
1.2.4	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	I thought I could consider Verbatium or Imation pretty name brands when it comes to DVD's.	St
1.3.2	The thing is, these are DVD's that have ALWAYS worked on this burner until this week.	St
1.3.3	I will uninstall Roxio since I never use it anyway, its just a backup system incase something doesnt work, plus it was there before I bought Nero.	St
1.3.4	I will try this and update if I still have problems.	St
