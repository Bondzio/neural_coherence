hi all - my xps410 (winxp, 4gb ram) began having startup problems this morning.
upon power up, it gets to the windows xp startup screen, the blue dots scroll back and forth for about 20-30 seconds, then the monitor goes blank.
i can start the computer in safe mode ok. i used system restore to go backwards a couple of days, but no luck with that either.
what am i missing here??
thanks in advance.
