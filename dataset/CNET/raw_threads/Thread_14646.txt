His Dell computer doesn't have a NIC card and instead of hooking it up USB I was going to install a NIC that I have. The question is, the Dell site says that it uses a 120 pin NIC card. The ones I have are all 116 pin. The people I have talked to, say they have never heard of the 120 pin. Is that just a type o or does Dell have special card they use?. Thanks Wayne
