<s> I get internet via cable modem. </s>
<s> That connection goes to a 8 port switch. </s>
<s> From that switch I have a Cat 5 cable running to a wireless router. </s>
<s> From the router there is a Cat 5 cable to my TiVo in one room so that it will share info via wireless to the other TiVo. </s>
<s> That works fine. </s>
<s> The signal also allows me to get internet on my laptop. </s>
<s> Now, back to the 8 port switch. </s>
<s> From the switch I also have Cat 5 running to a Desktop computer in one room, another Desktop in a bedroom and a third desktop in a home theater. </s>
<s> The 1st desktop and the bedroom desktop get internet fine. </s>
<s> The Theater and the LAPTOP don't. </s>
<s> Instead they get the &quot;The Network Did Not Assign A Network Address.&quot; I tried hooking the notebook computer directly to the cable modem, skipping all the network and still no address. </s>
<s> It used to work fine until I add the 8 port switch. </s>
<s> Prior to that all the computers were hooked to the wireless router and whether Ethernet or Wireless, the notebook worked fine...sent info to the printer on the network , and saw all the other computers and TiVo... </s>
<s> Sorry about being long winded, but this has me scratching my head. </s>
<s> I'm going to skip why but note the hookup should be: Cable modem -&gt; wifi router -&gt; 8 port switch and PCs. </s>

<s> Did that and now all are talking to internet. </s>
<s> So picky though...I had done it before and still didn't work. </s>
<s> Possibly due to order of power up. </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> Modem on...router on...switch on...pc on. </s>
<s> Thanks for making Labor Day Weekend less labor. </s>
<s> If I saved you some hair, even better. </s>
