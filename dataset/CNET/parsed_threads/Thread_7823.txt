<s> Hi all, Having recently discovered some pretty awesome games for my PC, it has become clear that my 'on board' graphics card is not up to the job! </s>
<s> I've looked at several review sites to help decide which graphics card to purchase and discovered that there are two main competitors - Radeon VS Nvidia. </s>
<s> I would be interested to hear anyones personal experiences with either of these makes and I would welcome any advice in helping me choose a card (ideally suited to gaming - Americas Army for example). </s>
<s> Many thanks, Robin </s>
<s> I would go with Nvidia, I've had some of their older cards and they worked great for me. </s>
<s> I'm currently running a Radeon 9200 SE and it seems to not do as well compared to my older Nvidia cards. </s>
<s> You also want to see what your connectivity is...if you're running an off the shelf system, you might be limited on what you can upgrade. </s>
<s> You'll want to have at least an 8x AGP slot if you're going to be playing graphically intensive games. </s>
<s> Whatever you do, don't get a regular PCI video card...I got one for my old Compaq (since I didn't have AGP) and it was a waste. </s>
<s> It played old games well, but newer ones crashed it bad. </s>
<s> For my next PC I'm gonna be building after christmas, I'm looking at either the GeForce 7800 GT or GeForce 7800 GTX...they're pricey, but from what I hear they're kick-ass cards and I work at CompUSA, so I get a good discount </s>
