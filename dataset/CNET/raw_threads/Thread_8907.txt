So, i am on a somewhat tight budget and am looking for a projector costing around $500 or even $600... It will be mostly used for movie watching and occasional gaming. I would of course like it to be HD (at least 720p) but i understand it may be a stretch for the price? Perhaps you know of some sort of sale or clearance (with the whole black friday or cybermonday ordeal)... Any help is appreciated, thanks.
