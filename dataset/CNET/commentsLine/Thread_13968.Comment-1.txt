i just purchased an hp n7060m media center pc.
and, boy, it's a chore adding other xp-compatible software to it.
i guess hp does not want you to add your own collection of (xp-compatible) software products to it.
since it will not recognize my cakewalk music creator 2003 software, does anybody have a suggestion of another music-type creator software product that i can buy that will work with the hp n7060m?
thanks, r
