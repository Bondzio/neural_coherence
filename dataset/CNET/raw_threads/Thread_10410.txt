Some of you suggested that i replace the battery for my BIOS so i did. So far no luck, the only thing that i notice differently was the beep sequence that it gives when i first turn it on. It starts with one beep than two consecutive beeps twice and at the and one solo beep.(beep------beep,beep,beep-beep,beep,beep------beep) if you guys have any more suggestions i will greatly appreciate it. thanks for your help \ freddy

If i drift this way do you have any suggestions to what kind of board i should purchase. thanks for your help man freddy
