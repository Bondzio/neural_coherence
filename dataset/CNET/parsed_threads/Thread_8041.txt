<s> The flash drive worked fine until yesterday. </s>
<s> I plugged in the flash drive in my winXP SP2 desktop, there was no any response, no icon in system, nor did it light up. </s>
<s> I tried it in another desktop (win2K), it failed to light up or appear in the system.,either. </s>
<s> Even worse, my friend used his flash drive (the same model) in my computer with winXP SP2, it became corrupted too. </s>
<s> It didn't light up when plugged in, nor did the icon appear in the system. </s>
<s> He tried several other desktops or laptos with winXP, and nothing worked.What happened to the flash drives? </s>
<s> Did they get burned up in my desktop? </s>
<s> But there was no any indication of it. </s>
<s> Once a time I used the flash drive, winXP warned ''low power'' for the device or something like that, but I tried other USB ports, it worked fine then. </s>
<s> But this time, suddenly it didn't work. </s>
<s> If someone would give any clue, I'd very appreciate it. </s>
<s> There are important data on the two flash drives. </s>
<s> There is a message about current draw on USB which your machine maker has a patch for. </s>
<s> But I don't know if this applies since you didn't supply the exact error message. </s>
<s> At least that message is fixable. </s>
<s> I can't tell if it applies. </s>
