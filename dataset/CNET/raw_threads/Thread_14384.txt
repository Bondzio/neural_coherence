I am planning to buy a new gaming PC in April but I am confused with my options, i have seen the XPS 720 at Dell, with a QX 6600 is that good enough to run games like warcraft 3, counter strike , call of duty, crysis etc or should i go for some other pc. 2) And which proccesor will be better for these games? Core 2 Quad QX6600 or Core 2 Duo E6850 as some games dont use as many cores. pls help !
