<s> While researching something else, I ran across an article about matching mtu settings on my home LAN to what my ISP likes for the Internet. </s>
<s> Changing MTU setting supposedly solves some problems with page hangs/unsuccessful download of large pages. </s>
<s> I tried pinging a couple of Internet sites and also other computers on the LAN. </s>
<s> When I ping other computers on the LAN the maximum MTU that works is 1492. </s>
<s> When I ping web sites the maximum that works is 1454. </s>
<s> I'm connected to the Internet via fiber broadband. </s>
<s> I do experience occasional problems loading pages, usually at heavily scripted pages like mail.yahoo.com, but occasionally other pages. </s>
<s> It isn't a big problem so I have mostly ignored it. </s>
<s> I understand that if my computer is trying to send packets larger than the MTU then the packets get fragmented, it creates extra overhead and so on. </s>
<s> What I don't know is how important this is in the real world. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> If the connection is generally working as is, is there much utility to trying to change the MTU for everybody on the network? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If things are working correctly MTU is &quot;discovered&quot; when the session is initiated. </s>
<s> MTU can change anyplace in the path. </s>
<s> There is so much equipment there is no way to know for sure. </s>
<s> The one place that MTU size has a large impact is when the do not fragment flag is set. </s>
<s> Normally a device that cannot pass it will return a messages via ICMP that says fragmentation required but the flag is set and drop the packet. </s>
<s> The client then resends it with a smaller MTU. </s>
<s> When a firewall blocks this message (some people do not know ICMP is not always ping) you get very strange and hard to debug issues. </s>
<s> Packet fragmentation used to be a much larger issue. </s>
<s> Depends what device is doing the reassembly of the packet. </s>
<s> PCs now days have plenty of power and so do most routers and firewalls. </s>
<s> There is also the issue of extra overhead for the tcp header on the fragments but bandwidth is huge so that also makes little difference. </s>
<s> The only MTU settings that make a large performance difference is when you can run jumbo frames but this is limited to equipment that can support this. </s>
<s> I'll leave the settings where they are for now. </s>
