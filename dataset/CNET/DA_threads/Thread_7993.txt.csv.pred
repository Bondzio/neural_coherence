1.1.1	Do these two products have the same MOBO?	St
1.2.1	probably as gateway owns emachines.	St
1.3.1	its not the same mobo.	St
1.3.2	the 827gm has intel integrated graphics or dat is what it says at circuitcity http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Gateway-Desktop-PC-827GM-/sem/rpsm/oid/120108/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do although dat is surprising as i thought intel only made mb for their processors.	St
1.3.3	emachines t6212 uses a msi ati x200 chipset.	St
1.4.1	There is a mistake in the Circuit City Web Site, its not the Intel 900, its the Radon 200 in the 827GM	St
