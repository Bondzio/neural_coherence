1.1.1	My present PSU is 250Watts - Is this enough power for my system described below?	St

1.2.1	This system has to be 3-4 years old, why are you asking this now?	St
1.2.2	Many systems from that time came with 250Watt power supplies and they were sufficient, more would be better, but if it has run for 3-4 years it probably was enough.	St
1.2.3	If you needed to replace it you probably want to get a 350-400 Watt PSU, but unless you are having problems you don't benefit changing out a power supply on such an old system.	St
1.3.1	personally, i'd go with a major upgrade of power supply if for no other reason than eventually you will need to so why not now.	St
1.3.2	if your system is running fine with your 250, then you may not need one, but any future system upgrades (especially upgrading that cold-molasses speed cpu) will probably require more juice.	St
1.4.1	You are right - I have had the PC for 4 years.	St
1.4.2	But I added the DVD RW and Second Hard Disk few days ago.	St
1.4.3	The shop assistant asked me whether I wanted a 400W PSU also.	St
1.4.4	I declined as I have already changed the original 200W PSU to a new one (250W P4 Ready)10 months ago.	St
1.4.5	Some people tell you 250Watts is enough others insist on something more powerful!	St
1.4.6	I just don't want to spend money on something not useful.	St
1.4.7	Thanks for your added input.	Polite
