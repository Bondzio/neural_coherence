1.1.1	If you are buying a macbook would it be better to spend $ 200 to get the 2.16GHz model ( that also comes with 120GB HDD and superdrive ) or spend the money on buying apple care ( wo n't be treating the macbook too badly , just traveling on the train with it using a protective case ) .	St
1.1.2	Thank you for any help	St
1.2.1	Do not consider purchasing a MacBook , of any flavor , without purchasing the AppleCare for it .	St
1.2.2	Remember that you can purchase AppleCare at any time during the initial warranty period .	St
1.2.3	Buy the 2.16 model , save up the AppleCare price and get it .	St
1.2.4	P	St
1.3.1	there 's not much performance difference between the two processors in mac os x like there would be in windows .	St
1.3.2	get more ram ... that 's where the difference always will be ; 8 gigs of ram in a 2.5 quad g5 make it better at large datasets than 1 gig of ram in a quad xeon 3.0 , as an example .	St
