1.1.1	We have an eight year old Gateway tower ( OS = Win XP ) hooked up to our Samsung flat screen TV and watch all our TV and movies through our Internet hook-up ( Hulu , Netflix , sports through random free sites ... etc . )	St
1.1.2	This is working well for us and we 're very happy with the set-up except that the Gateway is so weak , we need to upgrade .	St
1.1.3	Questions for those who know about these things : 1 .	St
1.1.4	Given that all we care about for this computer is internet/wireless speed and video and sound quality , what specifications should I be looking for in a new tower ?	Ques
1.1.5	What processor speed/capacity , RAM memory , sound , video and wireless cards , will maximize the quality of our viewing ?	Ques
1.1.6	FYI- we live in a rural area where our Internet service is limited to 6 MBPS max ( right now it runs about 1.5 to 2 MBPS but will soon be upgraded ( in theory ) to be closer to the 6 MBPS max ) .	St
1.1.7	We will also want to play DVD 's through the DVD drive that the new computer should have .	St
1.1.8	We do not need a TV tuner .	St
1.1.9	We do not play video games .	St
1.1.10	And I also assume we will not need much hard drive capacity but maybe I 'm forgetting something ?	Ques
1.1.11	2 .	St
1.1.12	What operating system should we get ?	Ques
1.1.13	I 'm inclined to get Win 7 because Win 8 seems like overkill for what we need .	St
1.1.14	Plus my wife is very frustrated by changes brought about by periodic software upgrades .	St
1.1.15	Win 8 looks like nightmare to her .	St
1.1.16	But I worry that we lose out in the future by not starting off with the latest OS when available .	St
1.1.17	Any help on any of this would be greatly appreciated- thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	Any i3 or better , 4GB or better with a video card with dedicated video memory with HDMI and the DVD player and of course Windows 7 should be fine .	St
1.2.2	WiFi is nice but can be trouble for some if the distance to the WiFi router is too far .	St
1.2.3	It 's all about location and what 's between you and the router .	St
1.2.4	It rarely is the hardware choice unless it was some rare 2 dollar thing .	St
1.2.5	Windows 8 might be OK if we add the start button back in .	St
1.2.6	http : //www.stardock.com/products/start8/ for example and there are others and free ones as well .	St
1.2.7	We 'll get a few Windows 8 machine just in case we get asked if our apps run on it but for now we see that Windows 9 will be fine .	St
1.2.8	For me I went simpler with an Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7 to the HDTV but this falls short on what you want to do but I thought I 'd toss this in .	St
1.2.9	With that out of the way , let 's look at the top sellers at amazon.com for desktops .	St
1.2.10	Stores have drank the Windows 8 Kool Aid so my bet is you may not get what you want there .	St
1.2.11	- & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Desktop/zgbs/pc/565098 At NUMBER 2 I see http : //www.amazon.com/HP-P7-1490-Pavilion-Desktop/dp/B009X8EC90/ so read the buy comments and see what you think .	St

1.3.1	As you 're using your OLD PC and got what you wanted , anything newer is going to do this as well of similar specs .	St
1.3.2	You need to pay attention to your current cable setup and be sure that is also similar to what is offered in a new setup .	St
1.3.3	While , I 'm inclined to go Win7 also , Win8 provides the same answers .	St
1.3.4	If you go through the trouble of Win7 , Win8 will be just as much , so decide which maybe less of a headache for you .	St
1.3.5	Also , if Win7 , you can upgrade to Win8 later .	St
1.3.6	With the setup ( cable ) they should provide anything newer if need be because you have a new PC if applicable or they may swap over the items that are part of thier setup to new PC .	St
1.3.7	That service should offer what it takes via the support website , the needs of continued service -OR- they send someone out to do this or instruction & quot ; YOU & quot ; .	St
1.3.8	DVD movies will play nicely provide the DVD drive is there .	St
1.3.9	The other half of this is the player s/w , but at least Windows media will handle that OK .	St
1.3.10	Since most newer PC will have globs of HD space , consider how much you need , but typical offering should be 1Tb or better .	St
1.3.11	If you need more , then buy with new PC as part of it , but 2Tb should do well .	St
1.3.12	if you save or store personal movies or offline movies then that will take HD space .	St
1.3.13	Win7 , 4gb ram , Intel cpu ( I perfer ) , DVD drive , 1Tb HD ( at least ) and ports ( ethernet , USB , etc ) , video ( card ?	Ques
1.3.14	512mb ram or better ) otherwise on-board video supports 512mb or better .	St
1.3.15	It appears you want a & quot ; desktop & quot ; to replace your old Gateway , so run away from tablets , laptops or netbooks , unless that suits you , but most of those would be better with Win8 and touchscreen if decided upon .	St
1.3.16	Shop online of local stores ( check for deals either way ) .	St
1.3.17	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Thanks very much to to R. Proffitt and Willy for the advice !	St
1.4.2	Couple follow up questions : 1 .	St
1.4.3	I 'm not up to speed on HDMI technology but understand that 's the connection I need to make between the new computer and Samsung flat screen TV we have ( as opposed to the parallel port cable I 'm currently using ) .	St
1.4.4	When I look at the specs for the HP desktop that R. Proffitt provided a link to , I do n't see anything about HDMI ports or cables .	St
1.4.5	Is there another name for it ?	Ques
1.4.6	2 .	St
1.4.7	As far as hard drive space , we do n't download movies- pretty much stream everything when we watch the TV ( or use DVDs ) .	St
1.4.8	So I do n't plan on getting a ton of hard drive space .	St
1.4.9	But am I going to regret this because I 'm not thinking of where entertainment technology is headed ?	Ques
1.4.10	Or is hard drive memory cheap enough that I should just go ahead and get a good amount of hard drive space ( say 1 TB ) anyway ?	Ques
1.4.11	Couple clarifications- Internet connection is via DSL and WiFi is a must since there 's no phone jack near the computer .	St
1.4.12	Thanks again !	St
1.5.1	You 're right .	Res
1.5.2	It has DVI and VGA .	St
1.5.3	Now DVI does use a small few dollar adapter to HDMI but it might not put sound on the HDMI .	St
1.5.4	If this was my choice I 'd add the usual 30 dollar ATI 5450 1GB video card ( I already checked for the slot and power ) then I 'd be good to go .	St
1.5.5	Try a few other models from that top sellers .	St
1.5.6	There 's a reason those are in that list .	St
1.5.7	If I 'm unsure which I should consider , the best sellers at Amazon has been a great help to narrow it down .	St
1.5.8	http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? docname=c03541337 & cc=us & dlc=en & lc=en & product=5298325 # N403 Bob	St
1.6.1	HDMI- If you have no connection coming with new PC , then you can add it latter .	St
1.6.2	USually , I perfer the video card addition vs the ada [ pter , however the adapter will work too with added instructions to make it *all* work .	St
1.6.3	Which is why I perfer the video card with HDMI port amongest others that maybe included , DVI or VGA .	St
1.6.4	HDMI handles the audio as part of tis make-up .	St
1.6.5	HD storage- The main feature of a larger HD is more storage .	St
1.6.6	Newer PCs will come no thought with a larger HD .	St
1.6.7	Overall , it 's good insurance to have the extra even though you may not think you'lll use it .	St
1.6.8	It 's just there and it part of the overall PC build , just be keen on what 's provided .	St
1.6.9	Of course , you can use the HD storage any way you want .	St
1.6.10	1Tb is just darn good to have , IMHO .	St
1.6.11	Ports- All those connections you may need are going to come with the new PC .	St
1.6.12	The only lacking ones are called , & quot ; legacy ports & quot ; , like parallel/LPT , etc..	St
1.6.13	But , those can be added later if the need arise by adding a PCI type card with those required old ports .	St
1.6.14	Though its important to know that your new PC has available empty slots to instal them on , so be sure to review specs .	St
1.6.15	tada -- -- Willy	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the quick and informative responses !	St
1.7.2	I think I 'm good to go .	St
