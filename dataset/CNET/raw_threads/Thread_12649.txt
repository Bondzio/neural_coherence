Most are just the photos. My question is. Is there a scanner that has an auto feeder that will work with photos? I didn't know if they made one. I know they have document feeders but wasn't sure if it would damage photos. Thanks for your time. Nancy

If you have a Windows 2000, XP machine see if you can find a HP P1000 like http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=hp+p1000+photosmart+Scanner&btnG=Google+Search&aq=0&oq= and http://www.shopwiki.com/search/HP_Photo_Scanner_1000_%28C9907A%29?loose=t If you find one, you may find that at under 15 seconds per scan you can scan in quite a few photos without much ado.

Not only will photos be torn by trying to document feed them, photos unlike documents rarely can be batch scanned to get good results. A fast scanner will help, but you will spend time with each photo. I've scanned in many old family photos over the years with great success.
