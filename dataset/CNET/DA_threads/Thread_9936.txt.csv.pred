1.1.1	I have built my own computer and am having some trouble with something .	St
1.1.2	Im not sure if the BIOS is wrong or what but when I power up the computer after about a day of not being used , I check the temperature of the CPU in BIOS and it always says 113 degrees F.After a while I will go back into the BIOS and check it again , of course since it has been running for a while the temp has gone up some .	St
1.1.3	My question , is the BIOS temp wrong ?	Ques
1.1.4	The fan speeds seem to be reading right and everything else in the BIOS seems to be right.Why does the temp read 113 when the CPU is cold ? Also it says system temp 95 degrees but inside the case seems more cool than my house @ around 78 degrees .	St
1.1.5	My system : Intel Celeron 2.8Ghz 768 MB DDR Windows XP Home ( for now ) ATI Radeon 9600 Graphics Card 1 Intake fan ( Cool Master 80x80x25mm ) 1 Outtake fan ( Same as above ) 1 Extra fan just in case ( same as above ) 1 CPU Fan with heat sink ( Zalman 109x109x62mm 2400RPM ) Thermal Paste that came with CPU Fan was applied 120Gig HD	St
1.2.1	You did n't note the power supply size or the motherboard make/model and finally no words if you updated the BIOS .	St
1.2.2	Your post did n't tell all .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The mother board is a Abit IC7-G Socket 478 Power Supply is 300W I also updated the BIOS from the MB website to the newest version .	St
1.4.1	Look at http : //www.tomshardware.com about power supplies .	St
1.4.2	The other issue can be the board 's does not support this CPU .	St
1.4.3	Maybe I missed it , but what was the make/model board ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	First off , I agree with Robert , 300W is n't enough for what you have even if its working now .	St
1.5.2	Sooner or later considering the installed devices it 'll probably come back to haust you .	St
1.5.3	Next , I just checked my own system and 116F is shown on mine or 48C .	St
1.5.4	It should heat-up upon being used and more if intensely used .	St
1.5.5	I would n't sweat it for now , provided all cooling is proper and such .	St
1.5.6	so enjoy .	Polite
1.5.7	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.6.1	How hight should I go ?	Ques
1.6.2	Is there such thing as too much power ?	Ques
1.7.1	The PC will only draw what it needs .	St
1.7.2	Even cheap 450W supplies are in the 20 dollar range .	St
1.7.3	You are pressing your luck with 300 , but I really would like to know the make/model motherboard since I just came across one that only did up to some 2.0 GHz Celeron .	St
1.7.4	While the 2.4GHz Celeron did appear to run , it was unstable .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	Im currently using MB made by ABIT and the model is IC7-G and when I went to ABIT 's website to check the CPU compatability it said the Intel Celeron was compatable but only up to 2.4Ghz .	St
1.8.2	The reason I put this CPU in this MB is because the guy at a computer store here said it would work in it .	St
1.8.3	So also wondering is the high temp due to the fact the MB doesnt fully support this speed on this CPU ?	Ques
1.8.4	If so will it hurt the CPU or MB ?	Ques
1.8.5	I will only be using CPU til after Christmas maybe not even that long.Also what things am I pressing my luck with using a 300w ?	Ques
1.8.6	The CPU was originaly in a HP with a 250W .	St
1.9.1	Hang ups , random reboots , freezes and in the worst case some failure of the PSU or motherboard .	St
1.9.2	I think you found your issue .	St
1.9.3	The motherboard does n't support that CPU .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Ok now I have got a P4 2.8ghz with HT and it is supported by the MB .	St
1.10.2	Now it starts out at 130 degrees .	St
1.10.3	Is this normal for a HT CPU ?	Ques
