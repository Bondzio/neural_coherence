you seem to dismiss the fact that we only lose what we didn't backup.
i found no difference in the units when it comes to failures.
if the sellers will not discuss the products with you, i would not shop there.
here i found zero difference as to the life spans.
it is true both will die.
but with a spare copy it means that when one dies you know to get another drive to get back into a state of backup.
