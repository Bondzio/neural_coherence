<s> I just finished building my first PC and I encountered this annoying problem. </s>
<s> When I minimize a window on the screen and then go to move the window it moves in segments....like it's rolling or under water. </s>
<s> It isn't smooth like it normally would be. </s>
<s> Even a full screen, like my yahoo home page, when I take scroll bar and move the page, it goes in waves! </s>
<s> I'm not sure if it's a setting that isn't right. </s>
<s> I have already checked the smooth scrolling box in internet options and checked the mouse setting (3 frames per click...like my other computer). </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> My computer system info is as follows: MOB: DFI LANPARTY UT nF3 250GB CPU: AMD athlon 64 3200+ Newcastle (Socket 754) HD: WD 160Gb serial ATA 150 7200rpm Video Card: ATI Radeon X700 PRO AGP 256mb Mem: OCZ Ultra High performance Dual Channel Kit 1Gig 3200 (2 x 512mb) Monitor: Viewsonic VA1912b OS: Windows XP Pro Thanks </s>
<s> the only time ive ever gotten that is when windows resets itself back to a very low video setting! </s>
<s> go into control panel and check display to see what the card settting is </s>
<s> right click mycomputer&gt; properties&gt; advance&gt; performance&gt; settings&gt; visual effects&gt; then uncheck the &quot;show window contents while dragging&quot; box. </s>
<s> bells and wistles are fine, but if you really want to squeeze more speed from your pc you could select the &quot;adjust for best performance&quot; button in this tab and just leave the &quot;smooth edges of screen fonts&quot; and &quot;use common task in folder&quot; checked. </s>
<s> enjoy life is good. </s>
