i've always had epson printers.
generally, i like them, but.... they have a problem, which is actually mentioned in their manual.
you have to use them regularly, or the heads clog up!
i want good quality b&w & colour printing.
acceptable photo printing.... pretty much all the things any home user wants, but what i don't want is to attempt to print something & find the heads are clogged because i didn't use the printer for a month or so.
i've never seen this issue mentioned in printer reviews & was wondering if anyone has ever tested various brands for it?
i would love any suggestions as to what printer i could buy that would not require me to use up trees pointlessly, just to keep it running.
