Good evening.
I dont know if im posting this in the right forum but I have being trying to get the wireless on my MSI Wind U100 which is running windows XP to pick up signal, yet it does not seem to want to pick anything up.
I have reinstalled the drivers and that didnt change anything.
Im using a Thompson st546 connected to the DWL-2100ap.
I can pick the wireless up on my laptop so I know its working.
Any suggestions would be helpful.
Thanks
