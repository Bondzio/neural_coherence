[img]  [/img] so, it my pc ok?
or te damage is already taking its toll?
this morning it happened again, i got so nervous when i was about to push that sensitive power button, my hands shake when touched it and.... well my pc turns back on with a very strange noise coming from the chasis, i think i just damage something, it's all my fault t_t
