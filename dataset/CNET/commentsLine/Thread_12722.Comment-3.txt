hey buddy.
let me start off by saying &quot;don't buy it.
build it !!
!&quot; (are u still reading !!)
here's why: 1) you'll get the exact configuration you want for your needs 2) it's probably gonna be cheaper than pre-built pcs 3) it'll be easier to upgrade in the future since you know exactly what you put in there and what it is compatible with 4) there is a ton of information and resources available on the web to instruct you on how to do it.
you don't need to be a computer engineer or a technician.
you just have to follow a logical sequence of steps.
5) it is easy and fun !!!
youtube.com videos and computer.howstuffworks.com have tons of info on building a pc.
here's a good page that explains the basic steps (once you read this, you'll change your mind and then look for more detailed info) :  note that i'm new to system building too.
3 months ago, the very thought of building a pc sent shivers down my spine.
but i have done a lot of research over the past few months about comp parts and technologies.
now, i am armed with so much information that i'd feel stupid buying a pre-built pc.
assuming that you will consider my advice and think about building your pc, here's some relevant info: note - i'm planning to build a high-end machine for gaming, just like you are, so i think that you might find my few cents on this helpful.
first let's start with the &quot;where to buy&quot; - undoubtedly, newegg.com.
overwhelming variety of computer parts and accessories, and from the reviews i've read, great cust.
service and super-fast shipping.
motherboard - i have read that asus and evga are good.
- processor: you probably want intel core 2 duo or core 2 extreme (extreme is available in dual and quad core) - ram: about 4 gb ddr2 800 dual channel (patriot, corsair, or g-skill brand) - hard drives: seagate 7200.10 sata drives how much ever space u need.
(these have become pretty cheap) - graphics: evga 8800 gtx 768 mb pci-e x16 graphics card.
- a good power supply unit (probably &gt; 700w power output) - a good case that has room for all this and whatever else you need.
these are the most important components.
the rest are relatively trivial - optical drives (dvd burners, card readers, etc) finally, i want to include the specs i've decided on for my computer, which will be an all-in-one work/gaming/home-theater system: you can use this as an example or a guide.
you probably want something similar.
please read and look these up on newegg.com.
i hope you'll change your mind after reading this.
