- if your regular task is doing internet surfing stuffs... there is no need to spend $$$ to get a new machine, in these days, external hd is cheap, you can get a named brand hd for under $100.
see below url links.
- you can save your files in the new drive, then take the drive to your friend's place to swap/exchange files, or when later on, you decided to get a new pc, you still can use this external drive.
- one advise is, you should save all your personal files in this new drive, it will be easier to do backup the whole drive any time, and when windows crash (or running too slow), re-install (or restore) the whole system on the old drive as a new system.
and you still have your data on the side (the new drive) - as long as you get a hard drive less than 128gb, you most likely will not have any issue with the partition being too big issue (if you do not know what this mean, don't worry about it... just get one under 120gb, you should be fine.)
[if this doesnt work return it just make sure you can do so before you purchase the drive.]
- check your cpu's manual, if your cpu not support usb2, then may be go get an internal card for about $20.
you don't really need to get it right away, just stick the new drive in, and follow the instructions to set it up (may need to partition/format), and start to use it... if you &quot;feel&quot; it is too slow, then you can go and get the internal card.
inserting the internal usb card is very easy, if you don't think you are comfortable to do so... ask for help... or just save the headache and continue enjoy the &quot;slow&quot; ride... good luck.
