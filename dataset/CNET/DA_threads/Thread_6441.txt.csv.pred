1.1.1	What happens if I put PC3200 RAM with super low timings (2-2-2-5 or such) into a board and CPU that runs with PC2700?	St
1.1.2	Now what happens if I increase the FSB of the CPU with the PC3200 installed?	St
1.1.3	CPU is AMD Thoroughbred 2600+ @ 2.13MHz	St
1.2.1	Either the pc3200 won't work, because the board doesn't support, or the pc3200 will be underclocked to 333Mhz PC2700.	St
1.2.2	As for increasing the fsb, this isn't an athlon 64, so increasing will be just that a increase in fsb.	St
1.3.1	PC 2700???	St
1.3.2	If so the PC 3200 should simply run at the speed of the PC2700.	St
1.3.3	As to the memory timing, how is the timing set in the BIOS???	St
1.3.4	bY SPD, or can you set the CAS [CL] etc?	St
1.3.5	Is the mobo an overclockers type??	St
1.3.6	if so you may be able to increase the Memory clock speed 1 MHz at a time to see how fast it will run.	St
1.3.7	How can you increase the FSB other than by increasing the memory clock??	St
1.3.8	?	Ques
1.4.1	using CPUID or Speedfan I can increase the FSB (which does increase the memory clock), but the mem is OEM in my HP (thus no BIOS options) and so the RAM is pretty low quality, I can't increase the FSB past 138 (from 133) without it becoming unstable.	St
1.4.2	My reasoning was, if I have better ram, then I could increase the FSB (with these programs) more because the RAM will allow me to go higher and be stable.	St
1.4.3	I was able to push it to 143MHz, but anything that cause above a 25% CPU usage would blue screen the comp, albeit, I pushed the 2130 to 2300 or so.	St
1.4.4	I would like to get to 2600 stablely if I could, and I think the only way I can do this is with better ram.	St
1.4.5	Lowering the multiplier from x16 won't work, or I haven't found a program that will actually let me do it.	St
