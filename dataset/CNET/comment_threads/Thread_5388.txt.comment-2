If you have no time to even store the &quot;important data&quot; what good is trying to store the system.
Basically, if storage fails for some reason, then data is gone.
Always think data first, then the h/w..
I suggest you wrap in orginal packing if available.
If not, then a simple double bagging in plastic bags will do fine then store in closet.
If you have access to descentant, use some.
All this depends on the condition/enviroment of area of storage.
