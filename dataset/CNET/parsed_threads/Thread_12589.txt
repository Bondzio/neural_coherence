<s> If this is what you mean- Defragging requires some free disk space as temporary storage in order to do the rearranging. </s>
<s> Often people wait until the disk is too full to do it and there is not enough available to complete the task. </s>
<s> If you have some big files you can back up, do so, delete them and try again. </s>
<s> Hi there, I am also having the same problem. </s>
<s> Whenever I try to run the defrag-either from Norton SystemWorks, or from properties under My Computer&gt;Drive C: it replies back with &quot;Drive C may not be configured properly&quot;. </s>
<s> I try to run a complete scan disk, and it says there is no error. </s>
<s> I am &quot;running&quot; at 59% defragmentation, and the computer is so slow, and running horribly (surprise, surprise). </s>
<s> I am current on my AVG (antivirus), Zone Alarm (firewall), Ad-Aware, and Spy-Bot, and have resolved all those other problems. </s>
<s> Any ideas, please?! </s>
<s> I've no idea how to solve this problem! </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
