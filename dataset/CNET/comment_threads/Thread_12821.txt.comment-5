If the DVD is IDE, then each IDE port on your MB supports 2 drives (master & slave) - the ribbon cable should have 2 connectors, so you can do that.
You may need to change jumpers on the devices so that 1 device is master & 1 is slave.
If the DVD is SATA, no you can't plug your IDE into the same cable.
A quick search shows 2 SATA ports and 2 IDE ports on that MB.
Unless you already have 4 IDE devices in use, you can attach to 1 IDE port or other.
