What repair is not known since ... there is no story in your post. Not only about your machines, but your background. You could start taking PC Repair courses, read a few books on PC repair and hang out, get a job at a small PC shop to gain the knowledge. As it stands, the machines chould be missing RAM (common) or just burnt out. Bob

NOTE: if you shut off/unplug your power supply to check internal connections, wait about 30 seconds after turing the power supply back on before you boot up to allow the mobo to rcharge or you will get that same beeping. When you restart your comp after a beeping fit, you may get a CPU speed error message. this is usually caused by the cpu trying to start but it didn't have enough power. that error message will let you know with more (but still not complete) certainty that your power supply is failing. good luck, and if you have more questions i'll check up on this thread occasionally for a couple days

Three beeps usually is a video card.....one long continuous beep usually is a RAM problem. TONI

I will apply the suggestions you have offered. A little about me. I am a therapist who recently got a donated computer given to me, with a box of parts, and a motherboard. I asked for a case, and ended up with a lot of older computers (166 win 95 type of machines) I decided to start to rehab them for children and needy families. I started PapabearCares http://www.kellin.org/papabearcareshome.html . I am learning as I go, and am learning to ask questions. Luckly, I have a number of spare parts now so if a component is bad, I can replace it. One day I will probably get into the classroom for more formal training. Thanks again for your help.
