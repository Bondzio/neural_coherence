the serv-u ftp server lets you store users and related information in a file-based repository or an external database.
by default, serv-u uses the file-based repository, but as long as you have serv-u gold or serv-u platinum you can switch to database users at any time.
as soon as you start using serv-u's database-resident users, you can pull user-level and group-level statistics such as number of transfers, total size of transfers, average transfer rate, and number of sign-ons from the user and group records on the database.
(see the serv-u db integration guide for specific schema information.)
the serv-u team has been busy adding new logging options (features to msmq and windows event log are in testing now) but direct database logging won't be ready for a few more months.
in the meantime, here's what i would suggest: 1) create one table in a new db using the following schema: &quot;dailyfilestats&quot; - date (either date or datetime) - path (string) - bytes (large integer) - count (integer) - direction (string) 2) create a command-line batch file or app (contact me for help with this if you need it) that does this: - accepts date, path, bytes, count and direction arguments - performs the appropriate insert and update sql statements to put this information into your dailyfilestats table (the insert makes sure the record is there; the update sets or increments the data) 3) set up two events in serv-u: - file uploaded: calls your command-line app with direction = &quot;upload&quot; - file downloaded: calls your command-line app with direction = &quot;download&quot; 4) set up a windows scheduled task to run at 00:05 on sunday (or whenever) to pull the top uploads, downloads, and new files and turn the report into a file.
5) use automation to mail out the report file.
