<s> Hi, My computers memory is infected with eco virus (Boot sector, MBR). </s>
<s> The only original boot disk is also infected. </s>
<s> I don't have a backup copy of boot disk. </s>
<s> According to Symantec, I can use a Norton Antivirus Rescue Disk to clean this virus. </s>
<s> However, I have to create a rescue disk from an uninfected PC having Norton Antivirus software. </s>
<s> http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/eco.b.html Is it ok if I create this rescue disk set on a PC running a different windows o/s? </s>
<s> I currently have Windows 98. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> SN. </s>
<s> I can fix a boot sector virus in 98 very easily. </s>
<s> I'd seek other fix-it articles. </s>
<s> For me, I make a virus free boot diskette (run win98se.exe from bootdisk.com) on a virus free machine, then boot that write protected diskette and type... FDISK /MBR The boot sector virus is now removed. </s>
<s> BUT if it's in the OS or elsewhere, you still need to deal with that. </s>
