I also use an Inspiron 5150 with a &quot;Mobile Pentium 4 3.06GHz&quot; (not the cooler running &quot;Pentium M&quot;).
It runs VERY HOT.
I haven't had the shutdown problem...YET.
As R. Proffitt outlined in his other posts, I am expecting to have to clean the heatsinks and vents and within the next year.
I will get a cooling pad if the temps still get too high.
I use SpeedFan (Download.com) to get an idea of how hot the CPU is getting.
