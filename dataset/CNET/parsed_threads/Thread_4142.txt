<s> I have a Acer Aspire One Netbook and was wondering if would it be able to power the USB powered WD My Passport Hard Drive 250GB. </s>
<s> I can power a 2.5&quot; external with my Lenovo netbook but bought a powered CD/DVD external device so why should the Acer not work. </s>
<s> If need be, there are USB cables with an extra power pigtail that will plug into a second USB port for additional power. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply!!!! </s>
<s> I called the company and they said 100% it would work. </s>
