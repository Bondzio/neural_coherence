<s> Just from reading what I have so far. </s>
<s> Wireless Networking appears to be an access to the internet/ISP, without wires. </s>
<s> It sounds as if rather than having an dial-up access to the internet or a DSL/Cable connection you have a reauter. </s>
<s> I am not so sure about my above interpetation though. </s>
<s> Because It's called wireless networking so I suppose you must have more than one computer operating off of this reuter; but dont you have to have the reuter near or in the computer (whatever a reuter is)? </s>
<s> I guess my main question is not so much what wireless networking is...I guess I want to know how does it affect the Family PC? </s>
<s> Is Wireless Networking replacing DSL and Cable ISP's in the home? </s>
<s> Or is it just a business thing. </s>
<s> Second is wireless networking just a connection to the Internet; do you still need to have an Internet Service Provider? </s>
<s> O.K. </s>
<s> I know you can tell that I am very knew to using computers and internet service providers. </s>
<s> As I type I'm just switching from dial-up to cable. </s>
<s> So please be gentle towards me &quot;A NOVICE&quot; in your answers. </s>
<s> Thank You! </s>
<s> Your Internet connection must be DSL or cable. </s>
<s> Connect a wireless router to the DSL or cable modem. </s>
<s> Install a wireless NIC into the desktop or laptop. </s>
<s> You can now access the Internet via the modem using RF (Radio Frequency in the GHz bandwidth). </s>
<s> My home network has a wireless router, D-link DI-614+. </s>
<s> I have three desktops wired to three ports and the laptop has a wireless NIC. </s>
<s> I can use it all over the house. </s>
<s> I could install a wireless NIC into one of the desktops and use it in another room without running Cat-5 wire. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for that info. </s>
<s> I was thinking that &quot;wireless networking&quot; was replacing ISP's. </s>
<s> From your response I understand that you still need a cable or Dsl ISP. </s>
<s> But this way you don't have to have a seperate dsl or cable modem for each computer. </s>
<s> The router connects to the DSL or cable modem. </s>
<s> The router's ports connect to each PC, wired or wireless. </s>
<s> Hence the name router, it routes the data to each PC. </s>
<s> And with a router you get a pretty good firewall to block unwanted junk from hitting your PC. </s>
<s> And with a router and more PCs you can build a little home network. </s>
