but i'm not sure if they have much in the way of long&flat designs...they more go for cubes.
still, i've heard good things about them, and they've got a system for most any current processor (amd 64 included); a lot of people use them for gaming b/c of their portability.
still, the good barebones are gonna be around us $300 (that is without a hd, optical drive, or graphics card)
