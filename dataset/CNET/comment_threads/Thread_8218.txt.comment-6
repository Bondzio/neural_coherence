The pins that put airspace between the board and the case/hold the board in place?
I believe I have 4-6 placed around for support.
My issue is that the computer itself turns on, but my screen does absolutely nothing.
I'm fairly confident that I have all the connectors where they need to be.
( I even double checked and reassembled by following the manual verbatum.)
