From the cable modem I go to a netgear hub. From my hub, I connect one port to my router (which has two 2k PC's behind it: works great). from another port on my hub I connect directly to a test PC I have set up (just a plain XP install with no data on it). I would like this to be exposed to the internet. The two PC's behind the router work fine. It's the exposed PC that can't get an DHCP or DNS address. Is this config possible or do I need a second ISP account for my XP box? If push comes to shove I can put the XP box behind my router and add its IP address to the routers DMZ. To me, this looks like it would accomplish what I'm trying to do. Correct? I'd still like to know if the first config is possible. Thanks, Bruce Thanks, bruce
