If I had tons to spend I would go with something a site like FalconNW or something, but Im looking to spend around $850. Im looking at Cyberpower, Im thinking an AMD PhenomII X4 cpu with a Radeon 5760 gpu. 1)Is this pretty good for gaming? If so, how long will it be sufficient for running most games? 2)What should I know about matching the mobo with the cpu, if the mb says amd...is that all I really need to worry about? 3)Case size...I dont ever think I will need to run a setup with more than one gpu, I dont play high end fps titles. Can I just go with the default case? 4) What is an internal usb extension module? What is a motherboard expansion card? Do I need these? Any help would really be appreciated, Im in over my head a little

Lots of positive ones but the negative ones are scaring me a bit, a couple said they dont test the systems before shipping. Does anyone have suggestions as far as comparably priced vendors? ibuypower perhaps?

You can do all that just as well. What many consumers complain about is generally they ordering a top-end PC and putting through its paces on gamers demands. These users are generally the most demanding punishing out there. Make no bones about it, they want the best for the least yet don't really put the effort to really get things going smoothly. You can't OC and expect things to always be good. You can't push the PC to the extremes and expect good results. You can't allow the PC to cook in heat bath for long. You really can't play for hrs. on high output and then expect to run every day like that. You CAN only if the $ is spend, wisely installed components and everyday TLC. Usage of only the best components and pay attention to the small details. Cooling and more cooling and make it work. Follow the hints/tips/clues of any hic-up via some gamers forum, drivers forum, s/w forum and/or basic google hits. Of course, if CyperPower ships a piece of crap, well that speaks for itself. Check your wishlist against all those gaemr PC systems and see what makes them tick. -OR- look into high-end PCs and just what they offer and see if you can build one. I generally advise now, is to get a big case, big and namebrand PSU and any cooling options. Then build on that because those 3-items I mentioned are not overlooked or taken for granted and/or shortsighted with regard to the classy items a PC will need. That's all..... tada -----Willy

The majority of gamers build their own. That way you can assemble a computer without spending mega bucks. As you claim you are not too computer literate start by googling the web for the fastest CPU, the best video cards and the best motherboard. Make a note on the specifications, and price of each component. This would give you an idea of the cost. Don't get caught up with the 'speed' hype. A good dual processor will blow the doors off of a quad or even a six CPU. Remember that Intel is better than AMD. You also would want to get the best power supply, and RAM you can afford along with a good mid size case. Goto all the forums and glean them for information. This way you will be able to get a good computer without buying a ready made one. My saying on this is 'Get a PC at Bestbuy,Walmart etc Get a Computer by building it yourself'. With modern computer parts it is quite easy to assemble your own. Gone are the days where you had to jumper motherboards and needed an engineering degree to set one up. Good luck.
