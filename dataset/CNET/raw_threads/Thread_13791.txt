After upgrading your hard drives, do you reuse your old ones (granted that it is in proper working order)? Why or why not? -- Yes. (For what? Do you ever fear it will fail on you?) -- Sometimes. (When?) -- It depends. (On what?) -- Never. (Why not?)

Second, I just don't have that much data to store. About the only data I keep are photos. I burn them to a DVD. They are much easier to store and use. I could use an old hard drive as an external drive but I don't even use the portable external hard drive I already have.

Well, on second thought, I do keep them around because I work on computers for a living. I just had a machine the other day that the customer wanted Windows 7 put on it, and it was an old Dell that was previously running XP Home. The hard drive that was on it was rather small, but still big enough to support Windows 7, but not much more. We're talking about parallel drives here folks, so I added a second drive to give them some more storage. Mobo didn't support serial, so even if I wanted to go out to buy one, it wouldn't work in this particular system. So, if you work on systems, they have a use. But if you don't work on systems for a living, then you might as well get rid of them. It also depends on how big the hard drives are. If it's a small one, I'm probably just going to write it to zeros (to protect my customers' data) and throw it in the garbage. But if it's a big one, it doesn't hurt to keep it around in case you might need it.

I make it a point to toss 20gb or less. However, if its broken, rarely does it make past the recycle bin. But, its not like I do this every day or even monthly, maybe 3-4 a yr.. Heck, there are 3Tb drives out there. If I have a 500Gb and I used it for 2yrs+, then looking at an affordable 3Tb is inviting. It's been my experience that a good drive will last at least 5yrs. or more. However, if a drive pukes at 3yrs. or less, its not worthwhile to save other than data and hope the warranty is still there. tada -----Willy

I'm frugal to the extent that I'll squeeze the last bit of life out of any drive. Current drive capacities are such that storage space isn't really a worry. Smart testing and other disk checks provide warning of impending failure. No specific reason to ditch an old drive before it shows signs of stress.

Now, since some cd's are 3 dimensional, the 3 time write over supposedly doesn't work. At a Business show a few months ago, some guys were selling a &quot;Drive Shredder&quot; that actually chops up the drive into tiny metal and plastic pieces that resembles the way a paper shredder works. How important is your data? How paranoid are you? Do you think a hammer and saw could accomplish the same thing?

BUT I keep my old HP brand XP with upgrade for some of my games that do not trade up easily. My Acer Aspire is running on Windows 7, and I had to do some fancy footware to get it to go on some of the games written for much simpler machines. SO some things I doubt would go to Windows 8. Therefore the XP is still on board. I can save other stuff, like family pictures on it as well. Who prints pictures? My addresses for email are on it as well. some are changed, but the really old ones are still somewhat useful. There are just enough things that just don't transfer from machine to machine - like the pinball machine! I love it, but it won't transfer out of HP-XP to the Aspire. Darn!!

Regularly sort saved items and transfer all I want to keep to external HD, thus built-in HD remains spacious enough to hold installed software and current files. And this way there is an external back-up in case notebook goes AWOL. Re-using the old HD is likely more an enthusiast thing, where people replace a 500GB drive with a 750, or a 5400RPM with 7200. As an aside, for me, speed really increased when adding RAM, not when upgrading the HD. Also ensure better cooling of notebook - i.e. not using it on a warm lap as that way the thermal envelope is less likely to be reached - meaning the cpu and HD slow down when reaching around 50C to avoid overheating, on my desk the surrounds are 20C, on my lap 35C. It's the main cause of slow computer when room temperature reaches 30C. But I digress.
