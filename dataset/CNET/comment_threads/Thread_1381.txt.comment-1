I have a Maxtor 80 gb firewire drive that all of a sudden is not recognized by Windoiws XP.
I powered off and restarted and it was recognized, then the computer acted as though I had shut off the drive, which I hadn't.
Most of the time I restart the drive my computer won't recognize it though the lights are on indicating the drive is getting power.
Every few times my computer recognizes the drive for a second, then loses it.
Same scenario when I tried the drive on another computer.
Any ideas how I can at least run the drive long enough to move everything off to another drive?
Any ideas would be appreciated.
Thanks Marc Berris marc@berrislaw.com
