1.1.1	http://shop3.outpost.com/product/5008295?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG Can anyone please tell me if this Compaq laptop is worth 500$.	Ques
1.1.2	Im planning to buy it, mainly because I going to use it for surfing the web and downloading stuff.	St
1.1.3	Thx for any comments or suggestions... =D	St
1.2.1	Based on your particular uses (surfing and downloading), it would appear to work just fine.	St
1.2.2	It won't be the fastest laptop, and a little more memory will help, but out of the box it should be suitable for you.	St
1.3.1	Don't forget to look for a similar machine at Tigerdirect.com or another online-only place.	Sug
1.3.2	There are a few other online retailers that can sometimes beat the price of the bigger chains like Fry's, so it might be worth your while to shop around and maybe save enough for your memory upgrade.	St
