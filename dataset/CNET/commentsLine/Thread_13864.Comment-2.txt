xp and windows 2000 pro will not host your server applications and the install should fail.
microsoft's server os map looks like this: nt (various) server -&gt; 2000 (various) server -&gt; 2003 (varous) server.
if you need more storage, split that onto a new machine and leave the dual pro with what doesn't move.
