<s> Recently i have noticed that my mouse is jumpy. </s>
<s> When I move to a location or move very slowly the mouse seems to jump a bit further or move up or down. </s>
<s> The whole system is only about 6 months old. </s>
<s> I have cleaned the mouse and tried to remove the mouse pad. </s>
<s> I have tinkered with the settings in the properties without sucess. </s>
<s> It is just a standard wheel mouse from MS. Any ideas???? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> It could be a broken mouse or a very slow processor and if you perocessor is fast enough then there is a software or spyware running on your computer which is loading you cpu to it's maximum. </s>
<s> There are more posibilities but these are the most common ones. </s>
<s> Shah, </s>
<s> I don't have an answer for you but a few coments. </s>
<s> We have just installed about 400 PC's with Microsoft Optical mice 1.0A. </s>
<s> They all have similiar problems as you describe. </s>
<s> Occaisionally a small movement of the mouse causes a big move in the pointer on the screen. </s>
<s> We have tried the differenet settings and mousepads too but the thing that solves the problem is switching to a Logitech mouse - problem disapears </s>
