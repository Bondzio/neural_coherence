1.1.1	I currently own an ATI All-in-Wonder 9600XT and I recently bought a Magnavox 51 & quot ; supposed & quot ; HD & quot ; but it only has YPbPr ( RGB ) and S-Video connectors .	St
1.1.2	Anyway , I hooked my PC to it with an S-Video cable but it 's pretty blurry .	St
1.1.3	Video looks terrific but anything else in Windows is terrible .	St
1.1.4	Is there anything I can do to drastically improve quality ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is there a software to increase the quality or will my quality increase at all if I connect through YPbPr ?	Ques
1.1.6	if it will could you give me a link for a cheap yet good VGA & gt ; YPbPR converter .	St
1.1.7	Thanks , Maynard	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I wish but no , that would make things a great deal easier .	St
1.3.2	Well I 've found a few VGA & gt ; RGB converters but I 'm not too sure if that would resolve my issue .	St
1.3.3	If anyone has used these before and could give me some insight on them that would be great .	St
1.4.1	someone might be able to help there .	St
1.5.1	http : //www.keohi.com/keohihdtv/experttips/markrejhon/htpc_superguide.html	St
1.6.1	That helps quite a bit , does n't answer the S-Video question but if it does not cover it I guess that means S-Video with not look good at all ... oh well .	St
1.6.2	Thanks again , Maynard	St
