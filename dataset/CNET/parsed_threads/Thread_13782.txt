<s> Your specs show no immediate support for PATA type(EIDE) HDs. </s>
<s> Unless, the CD drives have use of an EIDE port, then you *may* install an IDE HD, but it won't be quick or as desirable other than it can be used. </s>
<s> If you plan to use some old IDE HD, you may have to look at some adapter to attach on IDE drive then i/f with SATA port. </s>
<s> IMO, you would be better served simply to have a SATA type drive to install. </s>

<s> If you have the Dell XPS 600 Motherboard nForce4 SLI XH241, it sure looks like there is an IDE connection. </s>
<s> Open the case and have a look. </s>
<s> You won't need to change anything, set the jumper on the IDE HD to slave. </s>
<s> Just connect to existing IDE cable and reload your XP CD. </s>
<s> Do a full format, it should work like any other reload. </s>
