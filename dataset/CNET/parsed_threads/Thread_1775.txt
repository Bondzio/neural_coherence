<s> I have a Windows XP machine (custom built), first it didn't recognize my DVD-R all of a sudden (thanks to your forums I fixed the problem), now that it recognizes my DVD-R, every time I open My computer, then I double click one of my hard drives (C, D & E) a dialogue box of &quot;Choose the program you want to use to open this file&quot; pops up. </s>
<s> My floppy drive my DVD & DVD-R opens just fine, if I go through other means to get to the folder (My Docs, or other windows) I can access the stuff I need, only when I open My Computer and try to double click the C, D, E drive does this happen. </s>
<s> I went to device manager etc etc and all indications show that the hard drives are recognized and are working properly, please help. </s>
<s> A pest appears to cause this. </s>
<s> Try this common software -&gt; http://www.download.com/Autorun-Eater/3000-2239_4-10752777.html </s>
<s> Thank you so much it worked first shot!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> There is a pest that does this. </s>
<s> Your protection software isn't catching it so before something worse happens please read what Grif notes to use at the next link I share. </s>
<s> -&gt; And thank for the report back. </s>
<s> You described the symptom very well so you gave up the best clue. </s>
<s> The free tools I'd scan the machines that this drive was attached to are free and Grif notes them at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=319857&messageID=2925588&tag=forums06;posts#2925588 Bob </s>
