<s> Hi guys/gals: Don't ask me why, but what I am trying to do is have two network connections on my PC - one wired and one wireless - balance internet requests based on type. </s>
<s> They each have local static IP addesses. </s>
<s> For example, my wireless connection 192.168.1.11 is my default - it goes to the web as my default connection. </s>
<s> What I would like to do is use this in most cases, but say when I am attempting to get an mp3 file (for example), the wired connection is used. </s>
<s> Environment - Windows XP Pro I know this may seem silly to do, but I was hoping there were some great minds out there that might have some ideas on how this could work. </s>
<s> Also - the ability to do this at the Application Layer would be ideal. </s>
<s> Changing a bunch of Windows settings can be tedious and would need repeated on each different machine. </s>
<s> Either way, I am open to any ideas or suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Mind you are probably using Windows so that means the only adjustment you can make is to establish a route to one or the other network based on the IP address. </s>
<s> Tell me you understand routing and then we'll move to the next step. </s>
<s> This will never &quot;bond&quot; the 2 channels. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Yea I know a bit about IP routing. </s>
<s> What I can't get my mind wrapped around is intercepting the HTTP GET requests and being able to change the interface it goes out on. </s>
<s> I read a good deal about &quot;bonding&quot; and not sure if thats what I am looking for. </s>
<s> I want to be able to, effectively, choose which interface I use on each request. </s>
<s> Most talk about bonding or this type of thing leads into a reply with - you should just by a better router with load balancing. </s>
<s> I am not looking for this. </s>
<s> I want to write an application that filters the request and chooses an interface based on the content type. </s>
<s> I appreciate your fast response. </s>
<s> Let me know what you think. </s>
<s> Thanks, Nick </s>
<s> We can only establish subnet the internet to give differing routes for which subnet we wish to send it to which gateway. </s>
<s> If you want to bond the interfaces you can't do it native. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thats alright, i dont really want to bond them. </s>
<s> i want to create some sort of NAT, one that lies on the client side and chooses which interface to use. </s>
<s> do you have any suggestions? </s>
<s> ICS, routes and such. </s>
<s> The NAT we do with ICS is only going to thoroughly dismiss what you asked to do in your first post. </s>
<s> -&gt; So is subnetting the internet going to accomplish your goal? </s>
