1.1.1	My memory stick has encountered a really bad trouble .	St
1.1.2	Every time when I tried to use it on my PC , it will ask me to format it .	St
1.1.3	But , I know that the formatting thing will delete everything inside this stick .	St
1.1.4	Please help me save this memory stick and inner files back ?	Ques
1.1.5	I am not so good at computer .	St
1.1.6	So , if you could , I hope you can tell me the detailed steps .	St
1.1.7	Thank you very much !	St

1.3.1	OK !	St
1.3.2	Do n't panic !	St
1.3.3	In my persona experiences , you also can still have chances to restore all your files , as long as they are not rewritten by anything new .	St
1.3.4	What you should do right now is to choose a proper data recovery program to restore all your inaccessible files back successfully .	St
1.3.5	But , if you really know a little about the data recovery stuff , you can read this thread to know the detailed steps : http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-595975/any-suggestion-to-get-back-my-data-from-my-hard-drive/ Note : If you still want to save the memory stick , you 'd better format it after the data recovery process .	St
1.3.6	Good luck !	Polite
