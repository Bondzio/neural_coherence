Assuming that the printer you want to share is just a printer (meaning not an AIO because with this solution you may lose scanning capability) you can place the printer on your network via a USB print server and connect it directly to your router via Ethernet cable.
Any desktop/laptop connected to the network (wired or wireless) can share the printer using the IP address of the printer during printer setup on each computer.
If your router is configured to do so it will generate an IP address automatically; or you can assign one yourself.
Of course, each desktop/laptop on the network must register with the proper WEP, WPA or WPA2 security, unless your network is unsecured
