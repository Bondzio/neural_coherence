i know how stupid this sounds, but i need help with my epson workforce 600. i got a paper jam, which i cleared.
i also canceled the printing job.
the printer tells me to turn it off after i cleared it.
but there is no power button, just a button to stop/clear settings.
i pressed that, i pressed the start button, but all i get is flashing green lights.
i've look carefully at the booklet, but there is no diagram showing all the parts of the printer.
there has to be a power button somewhere.
i checked the epson troubleshooting page, but it's no help.
i think i'm going crazy!!!
please help me.
