you've got a 375watt power supply that should be able to handle these cards.
radeon hd 5750, about $155 radeon hd 5670, abut $110 geforce gts 240, about $110 but your power supply is 5 years old.
it may not hold up well with a hd 5750 due to it's age.
i also don't think the power supply can handle a gts 250 (about $140) because they draw too much power.
