Ifixit has great instructions for this, which includes a guide for keeping the various screws you remove sorted by type and location. Question that came to me was raised by someone else recently asking a similar question. Do I need to worry about upgrading the firmware for this drive? How would I even determine what the firmware version is? If the firmware does need upgraded, do I do it before I reinstall the OS? I've upgraded firmware in windows machines and digital cameras but this is my first hardware experience with a mac. The new hard drive is a Toshiba MK1234GAX 120GB ATA-6 (I picked it from a list of HD's that iFixIt gave as replacements they would install for my model iBook) The computer is an iBook 12&quot; 1.2 ghz G4 Thanks for any info... grim

It is a topic that has never raised its head since I started to use any of Apple's computers. Wind it up and let it go. P

Of course an iBook isn't the same, but same principle in a way... LOL. I've never even heard of updating HD firmware for computers, but my PCs are from the Pentium era, so there's not much to work with. I would think that once you install the system, the iBook will do everything it needs to for you. What HD are you upgrading from? My MBP has a 120GB HD, and I find it to be a tad small, though I haven't used up half of it... yet. Surely it can go a bit bigger, but maybe 120GB is plenty for you. I have never owned an iBook but the G4 models are still pretty good, considering that a lot of the good ones were produced a little over two years ago. I've seen a friend's iBook and he just loves it. Too bad he got it the day before the MacBook came out LOL . Cheers. -BMF

I thought about a faster drive but decided against it, in favor of longer battery life. I won't be using this computer for anything more than basic graphic design, and web design while on the go. If I need more room I also have a portable 120 gb usb drive. I will need to get a new apple sometime in the near future capable of decent speeds for video editing.
