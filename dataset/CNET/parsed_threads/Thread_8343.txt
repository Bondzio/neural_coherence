<s> I upgraded from some old Yamaha speakers that I have had for ten years, but after spending 40 minutes hooking them up, they won't work. </s>
<s> I am running Windows 7 64 bit. </s>
<s> I have tried opening up the audio controls, turning up the volume, ect but nothing fixed it. </s>
<s> I have all the cords hooked up right, and made sure the volume is at max. </s>
<s> The Default sound device is Speakers, which I assume is them, but I tried HDMI(my monitor's built in speakers), SPDIF Interface(TX0), and SPDIF Interface (TX1), but none of them play besides my monitors. </s>
<s> They all show the volume is moving on the green bar. </s>
<s> I have two sound cards listed under my Sound and Game controllers. </s>
<s> One is VIA and the other is ATI HD audio. </s>
<s> They are both up to date, but could me having two be the problem? </s>
