I was in the same quandary just last week for the same two desktops.
I even bought the 6030 but returned as soon as i found an open box at Sams Club for an HPm7767c, E6600 processor, 2 gigs ram, 600 gb harddrive, nvidia 7500, and a 22 inch monitor for a spanking 849.99!!!
The the e6300 beats the amd in many areas, and vice versa.
but i still would have gone with the amd for its more stylish casing, graphics card, and faster baseline processor speed.
