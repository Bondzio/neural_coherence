1.1.1	I have an Xbox 360 Elite and unfortunately I also have a Netgrear Rangemax model # WNR834B v2 wireless router.	St
1.1.2	My router isnt recognizing my 360.	St
1.1.3	When I first bought the router the two worked fine.	St
1.1.4	For some reason it stopped.	St
1.1.5	I called Microsoft and they tell me that its the router.	St
1.1.6	I called Netgear for tech support and Im told that I have to pay for that support.	St
1.1.7	Im not.	St
1.1.8	Could anyone help me reconnect?	Ques
1.1.9	Pleeeaase!	St
1.2.1	You didn't tell how you added wireless or wifi or the 360 to your network.	St
1.3.1	I set my wireless connection to my Xbox when I first purchased my Netgear.	St
1.3.2	I went through the set-up procedures that Netgear provided.	St
1.3.3	I have tried to look for some type of installed program offline helper but there isn't one.	St
1.4.1	I never had to touch my wifi router to add my 360.	St
1.4.2	But I did have to add a wifi client or wifi &quot;bridge&quot; to my 360 and configure that.	St
1.4.3	For the official xbox 360 wifi thing there are screens on the 360 you go to, to set the wifi network you want to use, etc.	St
