your system is too old for this, i am upgrading mine to 64bit.
i am also increasing my ram to 4gb.
my system was purchased last summer.
i am in an a+ class.
one of my instructors advised me on what to do.
i reserched my motherboard and chipset.
i will be ready for vista.
i think you should get a new ststem, but first research.
find out if you need vista.
if not, you may be able to get a good deal on a 32bit system.
