i have bougt a marine monitor 10.4&quot; 640 x 480 pixels (vga).
the navigation software i'm using require a resolution of minimum 800 x 600 pixels.
i have tried to &quot;cheat&quot; the software by changing the resolution after i have started the software.
but then it is not possible to see the whole screen picture.
i have windows xp.
is there a software or a hardware that can solve this problem
