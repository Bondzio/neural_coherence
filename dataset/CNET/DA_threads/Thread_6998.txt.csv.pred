1.1.1	Hi Just recently i purchased an Hp Media Center m7160n and i was just wondering if it is possible to add a 2nd hard drive.	St
1.1.2	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Take a look inside.	St
1.2.2	If there's an extra bay, and there are two controller ports on the system board, go for it.	St
1.3.1	And if there isn't a 3.5&quot; drive bay available for a second HDD, see if you have a 5.25&quot; drive bay available.	St
1.3.2	You could put the 3.5&quot; hard drive in a 5.25&quot; bay (mounting kit required).	St
1.3.3	Much much better in my opinion to mount a second drive internally for backup and extra disk space....just read the messages about externals in the STORAGE forum.	St
1.3.4	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Be sure you new HD have to set as secondary slave...(jumpers on the back) if you have SATA, dont needed too, just add power, and cable and let's ready to roll	St

1.5.3	When i looked on the mother board i found that there was 3 more of the same ports in different colours.	St
1.5.4	What does this mean?	St
1.5.5	Also on the power cable that geos to the hard drive there is another cable coming from it that goes to the hp personal media drive.	St
1.5.6	Would i have to dissconect that to add a 2nd?	St
1.5.7	When i looked for other free pwer cables i found a bunch of regular 4 pin cables.	St
1.5.8	Could i get an adapter for those?	St
