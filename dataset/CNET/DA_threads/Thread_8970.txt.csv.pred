1.1.1	Hi , everyone i have philips 107e 17 & quot ; CRT monitor , and below monitor is bass speaker.Is it bad for my monitor because i listen pretty loudly music , and when i volume up speakers i see some lines on screen.And , yes my monitor picture is shaking.Could it because bass is draving power from sistem or it is just electromagnetic field ? ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thanx , Fema	St
1.2.1	This area is thankfully well discussed .	St
1.2.2	It 's all about physics but to keep it short I wo n't write about electrons , CRTs theory of operation but just share that it was 1897 when this was discovered .	St
1.2.3	http : //www.davidparker.com/janine/electron.html Bob	St
1.3.1	Move speaker ( s ) or monitor away from each other , distance them .	St
1.3.2	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	and most speakers do have fixed magnets .	St
1.4.2	The volume at which you play the speaker is n't , itself , an issue but excessive vibration can damage just about anything .	St
1.4.3	Much will depend on just how close the speaker is to the CRT and whether or not it 's magnetically shielded .	St
1.4.4	Symptoms of damage from magnets are color and image distortion .	St
1.4.5	You can easily see this by moving a smaller magnet around near the screen .	St
1.4.6	Most minor magnetic damage is n't fatal and some will be produced by components within the monitor itself .	St
1.4.7	But , these tend to have automatic degaussing functions that reduce or eliminate the effects of magnetism .	St
1.4.8	Here 's a youtube of what a magnet can do .	St

1.5.1	Maybe could be just an old monitor ( 8.5 years ) Thank for replies , Fema	St
