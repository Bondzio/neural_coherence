I just ordered these speakers... http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006BK4ZY/qid=1119620874/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-0691789-9968025?v=glance&s=electronics&n=507846 and now I realize it says &quot;whitebox&quot;.
What does this mean you think in the case of these speakers?
Thanks for any help!
