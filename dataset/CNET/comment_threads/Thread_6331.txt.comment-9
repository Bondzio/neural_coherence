There are generally 3 types of slots on motherboards these days.
PCI (usually white colored connectors) for sound cards, modems, and network cards.
AGP (usually brown colored) specifically for graphics cards and those also come in 3 different speeds depending on your system (2x, 4x or 8x) ...............................OR...................................... PCIe (e=Express) they come in 1x, 4x, or 16x (16x is for graphic cards) Your system has an AGP slot, therefore you must only buy an AGP card compatible with your type of AGP slot.
A PCIe will not fit and AGP slot.
Trying to do so may damage your system and the card.
You must also consider the wattage requirement of the card you plan to buy.
The powersupply you have is probably only 185W, some cards will require more wattage on certain voltage lines.
Please research this more before you go jumping in.
