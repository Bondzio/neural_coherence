i am also looking at the rx630 (model # for asia).
since i am an epson fan (i had owned hp and canon printers, which i swear never to use again, before switching to epson and have no complaints), i am trying to decide whether to get the all in one or the r800 which adds a second black cartridge as well as this new gloss enhancer (total 8 cartridges).
anyone know if the photo prints are that much better on the r800 or should i stick with the multipurpose rx630?
thanks...
