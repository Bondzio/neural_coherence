Major upgrades to an old machine do not normally return much bang-for-the-buck.
Round numbers.
Cpu...........100 bucks mobo.........100 bucks Gpu...........100 bucks.........since you mentioned gaming.
Psu............100 bucks.........maybe you can use the old one.
Ram...........100 bucks If the new mobo won't support pata.
HD +optical ..........100 bucks Now you've got a bunch of parts that you have to assemble and hope they work.
Then you get to install some old OS on this new hardware........that can be a joke/chore.
Your call.
