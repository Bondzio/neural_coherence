<s> My PC has been making a whirring noise that I can't pin point. </s>
<s> I have 2 hard drives (exact copies) and have removed each one at a time and whirring continues. </s>
<s> I've halted every fan (tower, CPU, and video) temporarily and whirring continues. </s>
<s> I thought it must be the power supply or it's fan, so I replaced it but I am still getting the whirr. </s>
<s> I've also removed other drives (e.g. </s>
<s> DVD & floppy) and they aren't the cause. </s>
<s> Temperature does not seem high but I've tried external cooling anyway to no avail. </s>
<s> The whirring sounds like a fan going from low speed to very high speed, ~2 seconds loud, ~2 seconds quite, ever repeating (but it's obviously not a fan unless there's a hidden one somewhere). </s>
<s> The computer makes this whirring noise about 80% of the time it's running (doing nothing or computing seems to have no affect). </s>
<s> I don't know what other moving parts there are or what to check next. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The PSU also could have dual fans so don't discount the one you do find. </s>
<s> Also, the frt. </s>
<s> panel may have a buried fan located behind the frt. </s>
<s> cover. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the ideas. </s>
<s> As mentioned, the PSU (and it's internal fan) was replaced (with a brand new PSU). </s>
<s> There is no fan in the front cover, but I appreciate the creative thought. </s>
<s> Any more ideas? </s>
<s> You can make it a basic or minimized system, disconnect all drives. </s>
<s> If the sound returns, then some fan or sound source can be located by &quot;ear&quot;. </s>
<s> Don't discount any &quot;resonance&quot; like metal contact, etc.. You can test the PSU alone by jumpering the wiring, Google PSU self-test, if the noise appears then you have your source. </s>
<s> Remember, no drives connected and only the PSU and PC case alone to power-ON should eliminate alot of stuff. </s>
<s> Testing the PSU alone also can be done. </s>
<s> If you can't find a source then, well you do have a mystery, maybe allow someone else to hear it. </s>
<s> Also, be sure no wiring is banging against any fans. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The high then low thing rings a bell. </s>
<s> I have a Alienware R4 and had somewhat that same noise. </s>
<s> The tech came and could not find a thing, but he had the side panel and locking latch off when he was testing. </s>
<s> After a couple months of that I started pushing things on the outside of the case to see if I could get any change in the noise... once I pulled up the case locking bracket halfway in the back the noise stopped. </s>
<s> All along I thought for sure it was a fan. </s>
<s> I made a little cardboard shim and stuck it between the two metal parts. </s>
<s> No more noise. </s>
<s> This may not be your problem, but you can never tell on these things. </s>
<s> It's a little embarrassing, but it turned out to be a fan after all. </s>
<s> Willy's recommendation of looking for a front fan turned out to be the issue. </s>
<s> I had actually looked there in the past and saw nothing, but there in fact was a fan up there that I'd missed (thanks Willy, and sorry I responded too quickly with there is no front fan). </s>
<s> It seems hard to miss a fan, but it's hidden very well. </s>
<s> Anyway, I would not have found it if not for posting and getting great ideas. </s>
<s> Thanks all. </s>
