Problem with the macs are that they aren't in my price range. + I don't know where to look for computer parts if i want to build one; because i would like it 2 be as cheap as possible. And it's gonna be the first time i am gonna build a computer so I don't know what 2 look for, how to build it etc...

And to ask what is best means that you may not know either. For example one person things nonglare screens are best, the next loathes them because you lose clarity. It's been said that best may be to go shopping at places and see what fits your price and then, if you like the display and parts, buy it. Bob

The idea of assembling a PC myself is only slightly less strange to me than the idea of assembling a car or a bicycle myself. I have it done in a shop. I've always wondered why anybody would do it himself. But then, I'm not an electrical engineer like you. Kees
