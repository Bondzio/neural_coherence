not intending to be personal here, but suggesting that my dvd backups might get destroyed if a tsunami hit is a bit over the top isn't it?
sure, what happened in japan recently was a terrible thing, but they honestly don't happen all that often, and as someone else has already said, if a tsunami did hit then the safety of my data would be tha last thing on my mind.
secondly, my pc is just that, a personal computer, so i don't have to worry about business records being lost.
even if i was running a business, i wouldn't use an online service for storing my backups, because again as others have mentioned, i wouldn't want my private information available to anyone out there who knows how to access (legally or illegally) such a system.
as far as smart phones are concerned, i don't have one, i don't need one and i don't want one.
call me old fashioned if you like, but i only use my mobile for phone calls, text messages and taking the very occasional photo if i don't have any of my cameras with me.
i don't need instant access to emails and/or the internet or any of the other myriad of services available via a smart phone.
if i'm away from home and an important email comes in or someone suggests that i look at this or that on the internet asap, then it can wait until i get home.
finally, i'm a realist, although i don't care if you call me a fatalist.
if any kind of disaster, natural or otherwise is going to strike my home, then it's going to happen anyway and there's nothing i can do to prevent it.
if something like that does happen though, and the worst thing that results is that my computer (including my dvd backups) and other personal belongings are damaged or destroyed, then it won't be the end of the world for me because i'll still be alive and material things can always be replaced.
sh*t happens everyday, but i'm not going to sit around worrying about all of the &quot;what ifs&quot;.
