1.1.1	Hi everyone .	St
1.1.2	I recently recieved a Siemens SE505 Wireless Router .	St
1.1.3	The quick installation guide told me to first disallow Windows from configuring the Wireless Network .	St
1.1.4	Once I had done that , I had to change the SSID of the adapter to ConnectionPoint .	St
1.1.5	Once I had done this , the Computer could see the router , and I had excellent signal strength .	St
1.1.6	I then had to enter the IP address of the router and this would allow me to configure the router .	St
1.1.7	I configured it , was able to surf the net , and everything was fine .	St
1.1.8	I then went again to the cofiguration page , and enabled WEP encryption and MAC control ( if that is how one refers to that ) .	St
1.1.9	Then I logged out , and since then , I have never been able to connect to the router .	St
1.1.10	I always have excellent signal strength , but I can never connect to the router or enter the cofiguration state .	St
1.1.11	When I type in the routers address in Firefox or Explorer , I get the message saying the connection was refused .	St
1.1.12	I tried both enabling and disabling WEP on my adapter , but niether setting helps .	St
1.1.13	I tried the factory reset on the router which should have reset all passwords and settings , but i still have no luck .	St
1.1.14	I do n't know if this is relevant , but when I directly enter my routers IP address and Subnet mask rather than saying to look for the IP address automatically ( as i am supposed to do ) , I am able to enter the configuartion pages .	St
1.1.15	However , I can not connect to the Internet when I log on to the router this way .	St
1.1.16	I have also tried updating the firware , and this also has not helped .	St
1.1.17	I would greatly appreceate any help or info .	St
1.1.18	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	How do you know all this works ?	Ques
1.2.2	Go back to factory settings and try each item one by one .	St
1.2.3	What no one tells you is that all this does n't always work .	St
1.2.4	If you do n't like that , return the defective product .	St
1.2.5	In closing , another thing no one tells you is the & quot ; new & quot ; product can arrive with out of date firmware and drivers .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	BTW , what MAC address did you enter ?	Ques
1.3.2	Your router mac address or your Ethernet card mac address ?	Ques
1.3.3	With WEP enabled , usually you need to enter username and password - add it manually in your wireless network configuration .	St
1.4.1	I entered .	St
1.4.2	But it should n't make a difference once I 've reset the router , should it ?	Ques
1.4.3	I am going to try the reset again , and try all the options .	St
1.4.4	Excuse my networking illiteracy here , but does Windows automatically know to try and reach the router address ( when i type it in ) using the wireless connection , and not my regular internet connection ( which is offline ) ?	Ques
1.4.5	Thanks for the replies .	St
1.5.1	Nothing is & quot ; automatic & quot ; .	St
1.5.2	The wizards may help or they may not .	St
