thank you so much for your help.
i think that is the right direction but i have one last question (or at least i hope it is one last one) let me see if i can descibe this - you know how when you initially plug in some devices it asks you what application you want to use to access the device, and at that time you can pick one and also indicate if you want to always use that application.
here is what i think is happening - i think when i plug in the phone and hit music sync it is trying to open an application.
issue is i don't know which application it is.
i do not think it is rhapsody.
rhapsody is just the application i eventually want to also use with this device.
when i plug the phone into my work laptop (the one that works) i don't think i have an application associated with the phone.
it does come up with a box with 3-4 options on what application to use.
my home pc (the one i want to get to work) i do not get this option.
so again i think plugging in the phone causes an application it is associated with to try to open, which is then causing it not to connect.
so phew... here is my question: how do i 'deassociate' this so that is goes to asking me what application to use?
that is what i want to do.
can i do that from some place?
or how to i determine what application it is trying to use so that i can reauthorize it (or authorize it) from the virus software you decribed.
i hope i am asking this correctly and describing what i am trying to say.
i really hope i can get this to work and i am at the point now where i really think plugging the phone and hitting sync music is causing the pc to try to open an application, it isn't, and thus it does not connect.
