1.1.1	It 's time to replace my old Sony 200es monitor and I want an LCD in the 17-19 & quot ; size .	St
1.1.2	I 'm looking for any suggestions as to which ones to lokk towards and which ones to shy away from .	St
1.1.3	I 'll probably stay to the lower or middle of the spectrum pricing , so any help would be appreciated .	St
1.1.4	Mostly used for browsing the web , imaging , and typical home stuff without much if any gaming .	St
1.2.1	Stay at or above the 500:1 contrast ratio .	St
1.2.2	Below that I see murky grey instead of black .	St
1.2.3	Always take a gander at display units .	St
1.2.4	If they show any defect , do n't buy that one .	St
1.2.5	I 've seen the ultracheeps with waves on the display , the salespeople say that 's only on the demo unit .	St
1.2.6	Nope ... Do n't get too uptight about going beyond 1024x768 on 15 inch and 1280x1024 on 17 inch displays .	St
1.2.7	Most find the display text gets too small .	St
1.2.8	Even if it is , Windows has ways to push up the text sizes .	St
1.2.9	- & gt ; If you know you can live with a 3 year lifespan , your gamble on the warranty .	St
1.2.10	If it offers a 90 day warranty , do n't consider those .	St
1.2.11	Hope this helps , Bob	St
1.3.1	Are you saying that they generally only last about three years ?	Ques
1.4.1	I just looked at the ads and see that many are tft as apposed to lcd .	St
1.4.2	The ad has at least three or four on sale .	St

1.5.1	If they do supply all the data , you should find some number of hours till the display is some 1/2 brightness or MTBF .	St
1.5.2	For simplicity I 'm using the 3 year number .	St
1.5.3	It 's an average of what I see out there .	St

1.6.1	As I posted in a later thread , I just bought a Planar PL1700 17 & quot ; from CDW .	St
1.6.2	I got a special price through my son-in-law 's company but they are & lt ; $ 300 and have a 3 year 2 day replacement warranty .	St
1.6.3	Bob is right about the 3 year life expectancy , but my son-in-law has one that is 4 years old and still going ; sorry I ca n't remember what brand though .	St
1.7.1	It 's just the form of the LCD , Thin Film Transistor , to be precise .	St
