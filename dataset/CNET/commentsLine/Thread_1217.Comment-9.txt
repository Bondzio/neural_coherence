hey bob, i changed the ports in which the drive were set, this time it did not get past the boot stage i.e.
it did not recognise an operating system which tells us that the ports were correct in the first place, so i then took the hd and placed it into another pc with the os hd in the lowest port this time it acts as it was before i.e.
error message and windows starts to boot however instead of simply resetting itself it bluescreened.
so seems like the pc simply wont take the hd, have you any other suggestions toi get the data - maybe our best method might be placing it back in the external and trying to access it through there?
thanks, ger.
