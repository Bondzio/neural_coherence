in many cases 300w p/s maybe enough if only the it is a decently made one.
these cheap units you see now just don't cut it.
understand also, that the wattage rating is for the &quot;peak output&quot; it can support but not on a *constant level*, so buy a larger p/s unit you can afford.
i should have mentioned 350w is a good start, but 400w is better, if you buy cheap then get the highest wattage you can find.
it wouldn't hurt your system to have extra wattage, it's just &quot;available on demand&quot;.
try  or  for a good source of p/s units and selection.
you'll see the varying price range.
