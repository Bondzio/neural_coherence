my viglen would only handle 40gb total so i couldn't even split my 80gb drive into two.
i went here...  and ran their bios info program and ordered an upgrade - quite reasonably priced - they will issue you with a guarantee list of what the new bios will do for you.
i can now see 137gb but my pc is still too old to see any more.
you may be able to see more of your new hdd but you may be looking at a pc upgrade before seeing all of it.
good luck.
