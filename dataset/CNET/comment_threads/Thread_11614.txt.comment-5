please explain what you mean by &quot;lost electrical power&quot;.
Do you mean the AC input voltage to the power supply or the power supplies DC output voltages to the computer.
The Intel P4 has built in overtemperature sensors which will tell the mobo to shut the DC power off to the computer when the CPU gets too hot.
Be sure to check that your CPU's HSF is still working, or not clogged with dust bunnies.
What country are you in??
Running without the third [ground] wire is certainly not good practice.
Computer power supplies can handle low line voltage fairly well, because of the way a switching type supply works.
You certainly should get a better extension cord, one with 16 gauge [AWG] wire, or larger [smaller number AWG is larger diameter wire].
