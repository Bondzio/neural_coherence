but actually i was wondering if it has something to do with the current (?)
at home.
i will probably change a new motherboard as a last resort but as of now i am thinking of alternatives since a new motherboard is expensive.
essentially the problems goes like this, the computer keeps switching off after 1 seconds when it is in my house, but it works perfectly well in the technician's place.
this is a very reproducible problem.
since the problem began (about a week ago) i have not had a single occasion that the computer did not shut down by itself after a few seconds, when it is in my house.
but when i moved it to the technician place, there is not a single time that the computer shut down after a few seconds.
i've been to the technician's place twice and in both occasions i did not see it switch off by itself.
in fact, the 3 days in the technician place, the technician also claimed that it did not switch off at all.
the technician also says it is unlikely to be motherboard and initially diagnosed it as a case of overheating.
he added some hardware adjustments, but the problem remains unresolved to now, whenever the computer is in my house.
hence is there any other cause of this problem?
please advise, thanks.
