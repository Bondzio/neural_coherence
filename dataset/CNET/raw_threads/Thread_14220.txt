I have a Mitsubishi WD-52627 and I intend to use it as my computer monitor, it has an HDMI input for a computer as well. My PC is a Dell Dimension 4700 with an Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3 GHz and has 512 MB of RAM. The card I have now is supports S-Video but I do not care for the picture quality whenever I plug the PC into my Mitsubishi. My question is what kind of card should I buy to support HDMI? Or can this be supported? And finally is this an easy install? (easy is a relative term, I know)

(You should check first to make sure that you don't already have this, but I'm pretty sure the Dimension 4700 does not. It would be a white port, not the usual blue one.) You can purchase any PCIe (PCI express) video gard with DVI output, which most cards have. You can get a nVidia 7300GT for under $100 from retailers like zipzoomfly.com. Just pop that into your PCIe port on the motherboard and you're ready for the next step, which is to purchase a DVI to HDMI cable. It's a simple cable with DVI on one end, and HDMI on the other. Just plug the DVI into your video card port, and the HDMI into your TV, and viola, you're ready to go. Just google DVI to HDMI if you need help finding a cable.
