there can be many reasons for this type of problem, the most likely are that you need updates to your software.
have you gone to the nero web site to see if they have any software updates for that version?
that might fix it.
if not you should consider the roxio software.
if a software update doesn't do it, you may have registry corruption that is causing this problem, unfortunately the only fix for that type of problem is a rebuild of the system.
a system as old as yours is very likely to have been corrupted over time and that can cause the types of issues you have, as well as others.
