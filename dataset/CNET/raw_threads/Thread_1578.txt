I've had 2 Maxtor hard disk failures in recent months, and even after reformatting drive C several times, the problem keeps returning. I got rid of drive D since even Maxtor software couldn't fix (or even find) the problem. The errors I get are invalid space reports, and &quot;Boot failure - system failed&quot;. Windows ME also locks up on startup on occasion. I have an up to date virus scanner, and I'm very careful about opening files taken from the Internet. What could be causing this? The only thing I can think of is I started using a cellphone and leaving it on near the PC this February. Thanks.
