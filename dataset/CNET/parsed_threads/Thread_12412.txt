<s> I recently got a 802.11g card for my laptop to use when I am traveling. </s>
<s> I plugged it into my computer and it detected to network and I was able to connect to it. </s>
<s> I was surprised since I did not purchase a router: so I'm mooching off someone else's network. </s>
<s> I live in an apartment in a densely populated area so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. </s>
<s> When looking at the connection properties it says the connection is excellent and running at 11Mbps; so whoever has the network is using .11b. </s>
<s> Also under the properties it say the network name is &quot;default&quot;. </s>
<s> I already use Zone Alarm for my firewall but was wondering what I should do? </s>
<s> I have no idea whose network this is and now stable it will be. </s>
<s> Is there a way to secure my computer further so the &quot;owner&quot; of the network can't see my information? </s>
<s> Is there a way, besides going door to door, to find out whose network this is? </s>
<s> You can try another RF channel to see if you can make your own network, but your discovery is not rare. </s>
<s> Many laptops have a Wifi &quot;off&quot; button for such occurances. </s>

<s> I know on the admin area of my wireless router I can see who is connected. </s>
<s> I can ban their IP address so they cannot connect through the router. </s>
<s> You'll find out if the owner knows what they are doing if you can't connect soon. </s>
<s> Or they might not care... </s>
<s> So can the owner see me only when I'm online or is there a history section that shows previous action? </s>
<s> But I look at the SNMP output when I see the links blink and I don't think they should be. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well I'm still able to connect. </s>
<s> I've turned of file sharing in windows so I guess there's nothing else I can do to secure my PC. </s>
<s> Trying to decide if I should cancel my cable modem and mooch off the other person's network. </s>
<s> Would doing so make me a bad person? </s>
<s> At home we don't run the WiFi 24x7. </s>
<s> Only when needed. </s>
<s> I also enabled MAC filtering so only my laptop and one other machine can connect. </s>
<s> Since the setup is WEP enabled, MAC filtered and no sharing besides the printer is done, it's about as tight as it gets. </s>
<s> When the laptop boots, it connects to the last network (mine) and all is well. </s>
<s> If mine is down, it would find another (Linksys!!! </s>
<s> fix that!) </s>
<s> But clicking the the utility and then the network I want puts me back in my network. </s>
<s> I did change RF channels to as far away as the other networks I see. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Well if I buy a router and set my own network I'll make sure to follow your suggestions. </s>
<s> But for now, I think I'll be an evil b*stard and mooch. </s>
<s> Hey--I am in the same situation as you. </s>
<s> Opened up my laptop, it picked up a linksys signal and i'm online. </s>
<s> What can I do to protect my computer and my personal info that I transmit on the web? </s>
<s> When responsing, please keep in mind that I am not very computer savy </s>
<s> Don't use other people's networks. </s>
<s> You leak all the sites you visit and if you send email, most email is sent &quot;in the clear&quot; and easy to log and read. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> HAS EVERYBODY READ THIS? </s>
<s> Bob, this should be posted in huge print at the top of the page, next to &quot;Networking and Wireless Forum&quot;. </s>
<s> This is what I've been talking about. </s>
<s> With wireless, you have no idea who is using your network. </s>
<s> It uses airwaves and you have no control over who receives that signal. </s>
<s> That's why corporations are staying away from WiFi. </s>
<s> Even an encrypted signal is not very secure. </s>
<s> Now &quot;dweebe&quot;, as far as your post, I will make no bones about it. </s>
<s> You asked the question, &quot;I already use Zone Alarm for my firewall but was wondering what I should do?&quot;. </s>
<s> It's simple, really. </s>
<s> Quit using someone else's wireless connection. </s>
<s> Anyone helping you with any other advice is &quot;aiding and abetting a felon&quot;. </s>
<s> What you are doing is illegal, and I hope they catch your butt and throw it in prison for a while to give you time to think about what you are doing. </s>
<s> There are federal laws governing usage of wireless connections, and you are violating them. </s>
<s> Check with the FCC and see how many they have prosecuted already. </s>
<s> Maybe you'll be next. </s>
