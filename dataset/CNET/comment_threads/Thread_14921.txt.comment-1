My colleague bought a Kingston 512MB Extended Memory to install on his ibook.
The ibook detected the memory, and updated the total RAM as 768MB (512 + 256).
Everything seems alright, but after working for a very short while, the ibook will stop responding.
He restarts the ibook, and after a while, the machine &quot;hang&quot; again.
If he removes the 512 memory, the machine will work fine.
Could this be the problem of the RAM?
Or what other reasons can there be?
