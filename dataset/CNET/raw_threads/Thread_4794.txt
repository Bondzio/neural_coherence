This is usually not a problem as it used to be only noticeable when I ran scandisk or something. i.e. when the scan hits the bad sector, the hardrive makes a different noise from the usual, and has to spend more time scanning that area. However, I just formatted my laptop, and installed windows XP, file system: NTFS. Now the hardrive makes this strange 'bad sector' noise EVERY TIME I reboot. Does anyone know why this is? anyway to stop it? Its very annoying as it slows down my boot time. Thankyou all for taking the time to read this. all help welcome.
