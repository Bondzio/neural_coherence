Sometimes it turns the computer on, sometimes it doesn't. She thinks she needs a new on/off switch. I've scoured the net and can't find one anywhere. Some folks sell old ones pulled from working computers on eBay, but none match the 5100. 2 questions: 1. Is it really likely that it's the switch that's bad? The computer does occasionally power up. 2. Where the heck can I find a switch???

Trace them to the motherboard connectors. The switch is the &quot;momentary&quot; type which means the contacts close the connection on the wires only while the button is pressed. You can do the same thing with a small screwdriver between the two connectors on the motherboard. If it powers up every time, the switch is bad, a not uncommon occurrence. You might find a replacement switch here, input the PC make and model number. http://www.impactcomputers.com/dellparts--parts-for-dell-dimension.html
