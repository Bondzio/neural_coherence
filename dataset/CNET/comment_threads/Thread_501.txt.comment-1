Ok, I am running: Dell dimension desktop, ethernet connection to BT Voyager 2100 wireless router/modem.
I also have a pegasus TI notebook connected wirelessly.
Both can access the internet.
Now I am trying desparately hard to set up a network for filesharing/ printing.
But I am getting a major problem: When I try to set up the desktop for sharing, I get &quot;spooler SubSystem App encountered problem and needs to shut down&quot; during the configeration process.
As a result it never configures fully - help!!!
As a result I do not see my laptop - and my lappy cannot get to even find the printer!
Help please......
