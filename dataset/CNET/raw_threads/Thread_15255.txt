One has all of the OEM software with keycodes. I have installed Ubuntu on both of them. One of them is a P3 700, with 192 mb of Ram and a 20 GB hard drive. The other is a P3 550 with 320 MB of Ram, and 2 hard drives. OS on a 10 GB and the data drive is a 20 GB. Along with CRT monitors, keyboards and mice and speakers, I plan on taking the machines to Goodwill. Unless I can find someone in need of a PC, I will take them tomorrow. Any idea on value of them? They both work. The one with the least memory has a NIC card, I was just surfing the internet with it a few minutes ago. The other PC only has a modem installed.

Along with it (98se) the keycodes and gateway recovery disk. I had to put a NIC card in it, clean the lint and dirt, installed a new CMOS battery. I installed UBUNTU on both machines. I was going to offer them to someone for $50 apiece (includes CRT monitor, Mouse and keyboard, speakers.) I just wondered if that was too much.
