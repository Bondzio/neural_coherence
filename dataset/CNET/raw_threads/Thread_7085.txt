Have AMD 64 3000 chip, w/ DFI Lan Party UT nF3 250Gb moboard, plus 1GB DDR400 PC3200 RAM, and Radeon 9550 video card. The moboard came with CD for drivers for onboard chips, Also have HD Maxtor 200GB SATA/150. Plan on installing WinXP Pro OS. Once all hardware is set up, what software do I install and in what order. Thought I would only install DVD-ROM and floppy at first. Sound card is on moboard. Do I need install video card before installing drivers on moboard and HD drivers, and OS??? Appreciate someone giving a brief outline of steps. Thanks! Jim P.S. Does CNet have site that gives this detailed info step by steP?

6639	2	59497	706573	706477	Ray Harinec	1/22/05 4:08 PM	1.10641008E12	Limit the first assembly step to	installing the mobo in the case, adding one stick of memory, the CPU/HSF, , connect the front panel switches to the mobo, the Power Supply to the mobo, no mouse, no keyboard, no video card. Power up and hope to hear a lot of beeps complaining that you have no video. Power down [and turn off the Power Supply from ots rear switch to remove the 5 volt standby power. Remember to turn it on when you go to power up again]. If you are successful to this point plug the video card in and connect a monitor. power up and hope to get the first screen showing BIOS versipon and maybe a splash screen with the mobo mfrs name. Get this far, power off, connect a keyboard, power up and get into the BIOS and make your settings. Then add the floppy drive and but a boot floppy in to see if it boots to an A prompt. Get this far, add ONE item at a time and test. With XP installing from the CD, might want to put the CD drive in next. If you can't get past any of these steps there is absolutely no reason to go further. Find out why it didn't work. If you are putting the mobo in a case where another mobo had been, make sure that you remove any metal standoffs the DO NOY line up with the mounting holes on the new mobo.

6639	7	59497	711414	709703	John Robie	1/24/05 5:29 PM	1.10658774E12	Building basic PC	Hi Big Steve, Not that I know of, but really when it comes down to it, building a gaming PC and a PC not for gaming is the same. A gaming PC is what everyone really wants to aspire to as they have all the top ingredients for a quality desktop PC. If it wasn't for gaming, there wouldn't be much incentive to keep improving the high end efficiency of home computers. All you have to do is follow the procedures for building a gaming PC to build a PC that is not specific for gaming. Just reduce the Processor (CPU) speed, the amount of RAM MB, and type of graphics card (Video Card), if the cost is not in your range. If the cost can be managed, then building a Gaming PC is excellent for a PC to surf the net efficiency, email, personal finance, and word processing. Actually, unless you have a real interest in building, for your enjoyment the challenge, learning about details in a computer structure, satisfaction in bragging about building your own computer, experts agree that the cost is about the same for building yourself or buying one already built, especially now-a-days with the reasonable prices. If all you want to do is what you say, then look in your newspaper ads for used computers for about $150-$200. Still better look at the excellent bargains on the emachine. Best Buy has one this week for $329.97 with 17&quot; flat screen CRT monitor, and color printer, that is powerful enough (2.66 GHz CPU with Celeron D Processor), 256 MB RAM, 60GB Hard Drive, Integrated Graphics, to handle more than what you require, and it is not considered a gaming machine, but will play many of the non high tech games. Other sources for how to build...www.google.com...type in &quot;building a computer&quot; or words to that effect. JR
