hi all i have been looking to buy an imac for a long time, and i have finally decided to do so.
however, i would appriciate some help choosing the right configeration.
it will be used for general use (email, web browsing etc) but also for editing home movies and photos.
so, my questions are 1.is there a notable increase in performance with 2gb ram?
2. should i upgrade to a 500gb drive?
it is cheaper (in australia at least) to get an external 300gb maxtor drive instead, however it has recieved many negative comments on cnet... 3. if i do get an external drive, will the performance of accessing/editing files on that drive be slower than on the internal drive?
4. should i get the wireless keyboard and mouse, or the standard keyboard and mighty mouse?
or, in other words, is the mighty mouse worth getting over wireless?
and, last but not least, should i wait until the apple 30th anniversary on april 1st, incase it improves.
im not much concerned about small performance increases, however i have heard rumors of a 23inch hd screen on the imac, which would be nice.
thank you in advance will moisis
