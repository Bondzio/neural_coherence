dear squirtlewa: thanks for all the ideas.
here are some follow-up questions/comments that now come to mind... 1) LCD monitor - yes, I was curous about the power issue too - the monitor is from 1997 I think.
2) Sorry for the RAM - it is indeed 1GB, not MB; 3) If I can figure out how to restore eveything I need after reinstalling XP, then I think I can manage the time to do it myself.
However, would you suggest any service that is good for projects like this?
Geek squad or the like?
I have never used anyone like that.
4) I get your point about the internal HD issue - I think...
So I could buy internal HD of much larger size, but it owuld have to be PATA and therefore would also be out of date and essentially stalling the inevitable.
5) Re the laptop - I think where I am heading is to a) get a good external HD that will last beyond this system and clear a lot of space on the HD; b) try the OS reinstall and reformat as suggested to improve performance; c) get a LCD; d) get a cost effective laptop to hook into our wireless network here.
