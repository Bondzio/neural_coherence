I just got the following DFI Lanparty UT nF4 Ultra-D AMD Athlon64 X2 3800+ 2GB OCZ RAM 250 Seagate SATA with NCQ eVGA GeForce 6600GT I am hoping this will last a good 5 years I also have a question about working with High Definition Video The minimum requirements for working with 1080i in Pinnacle Liquid Edition say it requires a 256MB Video Card.
Will my 6600GT be able to handle it?
or will I have to upgrade it?
