hi all i haven't been here for a very long time, since my last pc build just a little under 2 years ago, so i am really out of the loop with hardware and stuff, so once more i have returned to ask for the help and support of those more technology-knowledgeable than i. basically i start university on the 16th of september and will be moving away from home for the first time.
after much consideration, and due to my limited budget i have decided to try and build a new desktop pc, rather than buying a cheap laptop.
my budget is around &#65443;500 for the system and monitor, and due to limited desk space i will definitely need an lcd screen (19&quot; maybe?
): primary uses: - listening to music, i am planning to purchase a set of 2.1 speakers and to use my pc as my main audio device instead of taking a hifi system down to university.
- the usual sort of office stuff, word, excel, running together with irc, msn maybe and also the music playing together with any other background things (makes me wonder if i need a dual core?).
secondary uses: - i will likely watch movies regularly, in order to make use of the unlimited download bandwidth in campus in the first year.
- i will probably play on a few games, but i'm not a big gamer and if i do play games they tend to be strategy games and the like, rather than first person shooters and stuff, so frame rate isn't a huge problem for me, but a nice looking screen would be good.
as i will go very soon, this leaves me just a few days to decide upon what parts i want for my pc so that i can order them and get the system put together before i head off to university.
therefore i would really, really appreciate any support and advice any of you can offer on this subject... as to be honest i just don't know what combination, within my price range will give me the best performance for the above stuff?
thanks in advance to anybody who is willing to give me a helping hand!
kindest regards john
