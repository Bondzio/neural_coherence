All super critical data is saved on discs, like CD/DVD and flash drives.
No other method is used for my needs.
There are multiple copies and usually the amount of data is greatly reduced to the current needs, rather than a prolonged storage overs yrs.
as example.
I do however, like the fact, that once I upgrade to a new HD, I keep the old HD &quot;as is&quot; for several months not only as a safe return if something happens on new HD install but as a back-up version as well.
Once safe and sound, that old HD gets re-used.
