<s> First of all I have the Linksys wrt54gs router, and I have Verizon's DSL it's 3mbps and I am upgrading to symmetrical fiber 12mbps. </s>
<s> The things i have connected to the router is a ps3 on wireless, 2 laptops, 2 computers. </s>
<s> And if this might help I do play games online and i download alot and watch shows online aswell. </s>
<s> That router has a speed of 100 Mb/s wired, and 54 Mb/s wireless. </s>
<s> The only thing faster is Gigabit. </s>
<s> You can upgrade to what I have, a D-link DIR-655, Gigabit/wireless N. My machines are all Gigabit and wireless N. But then you'll have to upgrade all your other stuff to Gigabit and N. Keep what you have. </s>
