two choices - install new as second drive.
copy everything wipe old drive install xp or - much time saver my choice:: install new drive as c: ...... may need to change phisical position of old c: to make cableing work without kinks hahahaha.
dont connect the old c: into the cables yet.
now install xp on new drive.
you will get question about partitioning new drive.
say yes and set drive c: to about 20g.
you can leave the rest ok if you wish.
think of hardrive as a file cabinet.
top drawer c: ... all u put in it is xp next drawer your wp and other programs nedt drawer files, which can be sep by things like articles music, videos, pics etc.
.... anyway, u get the idea.
you can make many partitions but i would only do max 3 on this drive.
this should have u set up and ready for the world to say hi.... hahaha shut down then install the old drive now - reload wp and other programs you use.
during the install it will ask if default folder 'c:/program name etc' || (browse button) say no and change the drive letter to d: .... for each pgm you install.
when all done then u can copy all the files you want to save to folders you name and you will be well organized hahahaha then u can wipe the 2nd drive and use it for backups and other file saveing so now you can see that if u have a system problem u can wipe and reload anytime and not worry bout files... thers a bit more but that detail can wait.
