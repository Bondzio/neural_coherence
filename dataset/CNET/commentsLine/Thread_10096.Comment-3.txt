given that all other things are equal... you may have to &quot;activate&quot; the drive.
go to my computer in windows explorer and right click.
click on &quot;manage&quot;.
under &quot;storage&quot; click on &quot;disk management&quot;.
now look for the drive and make sure it's &quot;activated&quot;.
if not activate it.
hope this works for you.
and life goes on... jack
