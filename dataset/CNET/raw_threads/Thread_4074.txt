An Intel 2.8GHz dual core should be fine with 1 or 2GB RAM and a newer video card. I think this Dell has a PCIE slot so let me offer a card I would use -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Zotac-nVidia-Express-Graphic-ZT-20404-20L/dp/B002X7A6N4 This moves the video card up to game play standards without having to replace the computer's power supply. Be sure to see if the card mechanically fits. Bob

Let's get that model's link. http://www.amazon.com/Sparkle-SP95GT1024D2LHP-GeForce-HDTV-Out-Graphics/dp/B002B7JFYC This has 1GB Video ram and would be great for this sort of machine and those older games. Cheaper than that alternative. Bob
