<s> Hello, I am about to begin online college courses and was considering a netbook (looking at multiple versions of asus eee) for portability reasons. </s>
<s> The college i'm enrolled in requires 56k baud modem which is not included on any of the netbooks i've seen. </s>
<s> Does anybody have any advice on if it is a good idea to buy an external modem for this kind of device or I should just give up the netbook idea and stick to taking my classes on my pc. </s>
<s> I am specifically interested in a netbook because of the price point but it just may not offer what i'm looking for. </s>
<s> I'm not very tech minded so would love advice from anyone who has experience with this type of issue. </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>
<s> I still on the rare occasion help with such. </s>
<s> Your choice on the final decision but the bottom line here is that I can get one in hours to a day or two for not much (amazon, fry's, newegg) so I could delay this till I needed it. </s>

<s> not sure i understand this reply... </s>
<s> Here, today, now, I could have a modem by tomorrow for not much. </s>
<s> My thought here is you could try to get by without the modem and if not, get it without much notice. </s>

<s> since my home access to the internet is via dial-up. </s>
<s> I bought a CONEXANT DELL 56K EXTERNAL USB MODEM ADAPTER cheap on eBay and it connects at 48k. </s>
<s> Be sure to get a driver disk with the modem. </s>
<s> DELL drivers can be found on their Support web page if you work at it. </s>
