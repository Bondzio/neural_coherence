1.1.1	I have what I think is a tough question to answer .	St
1.1.2	Is it possible to wirelessly link two networks together ?	Ques
1.1.3	Here is the situation : Network 1 - 2 desktops & Laptop ( with wireless ) hooked up to a Belkin Wirelss G Router/Gateway which is hooked up to Comcast Internet .	St
1.1.4	Network 2 - 2 desktops hooked up to a Netgear Wireless G Router/Gateway .	St
1.1.5	I would like the two networks to be able to share internet , files , and be able to play games .	St
1.1.6	The distance between the two networks is at max 50 feet .	St
1.1.7	But there is ABSOLUTELY NO way to wire the networks together as they are across a hallway .	St
1.1.8	If this can not be done , some suggestions on how to make the situation better would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.9	Also I do n't really want to buy wireless cards for the two desktops on network 2 .	St
1.1.10	Thank you for your help .	St
1.2.1	That 's called a wireless bridge and the only mistake I see is that you may be attempting this with a wifi router .	St
1.2.2	If said router has bridge capability that 's fine but imagine if it does n't .	St
1.2.3	Hint .	St
1.2.4	WIRELESS BRIDGE on google.com Layout hint : LAN - & gt ; Wireless bridge -- - ( air ) -- - Wireless Bridge - & gt ; other LAN .	St

1.3.1	Speaking of wireless bridges ...	St
1.3.2	I have a situation where we 're trying to set up a wireless network in a SINGLE ROOM because the architectural geniuses who designed the place put the cable jack in a spot surrounded by TWO DOORS so it would be borderline impossible to run ethernet cable to the 2nd workstation .	St
1.3.3	Now , the 2nd workstation itself is a desktop machine without any open PCI slots so we 've been trying to use various USB wireless network adapters that seem to cause all SORTS of lovely driver-related lockup issues ( to say nothing of severely complicating reloading Windows on the 2nd machine ) .	St
1.3.4	I had been looking at potentially using a wireless bridge ( I guess some of them are called & quot ; gaming adapters & quot ; ? )	Ques
1.3.5	so that the 2nd machine can be connected to the network via its built-in ethernet port ( which performed well when previously connected to a wired ethernet network at another location ) .	St
1.3.6	Questions - has anyone tried this configuration ?	Ques
1.3.7	Does anyone have a wireless bridge they have had luck with ?	Ques
1.3.8	( There seem to be lots and lots of wireless network adapters but very few wireless bridges . )	St
1.3.9	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	Please follow my suggestion of what to type into google.com since I do n't duplicate ready web content .	Sug
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	I read your post and that is sort of what I was thinking needed to be done .	St
1.5.2	Unfortunately the routers are not bridges , so I 'll need to buy two bridges it looks like .	St
1.5.3	I was wondering if you have any experience with bridges and know what brands are any good ?	Ques
1.5.4	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	Linksys , dlink , etc .	St
1.6.2	Some routers can be a bridge and that wrt54 series if it does n't might be coerced if we install other firmware .	Sug
1.6.3	I 'll note where it is so you can see if it has a bridge mode .	St
