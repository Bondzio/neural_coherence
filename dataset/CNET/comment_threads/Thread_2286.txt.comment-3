Dear Mr. Bob, Can you instruction me like that: - There is program, that can load bitmap into printer, in this program, it can send command to order printer print out that bitmap.
( you can see this program: Epson TM Flash Logo Utility's in http://www.epsonexpert.com/ ) - But how to order printer print out that bitmap in other aplication program?
It mean I have to know the command line and write it in printer drive such as Generic/text only.
(in this drive, I can adding command line to printer) Here is I don't know exactly how to set the command to order printer print out bitmap such as flash program.
Hope that you can know my mind and show me where can find that knowleadge.
Thank for your instruction.
Long Lt
