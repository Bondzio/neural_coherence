<s> I recently bought a PS3, and it has the option to search for a media server. </s>
<s> It doesn't find media on my network attach computer hard drive. </s>
<s> Is it looking for a networked hard drive like the HP Media Vault MV2120 or D-Link DNS-323 2-Bay Network Storage Enclosure with media on it? </s>
<s> Do I have to get a &quot;media server computer&quot;? </s>
<s> Can I use my computer and run some program to make it recognizable as a media server to the PS3? </s>
<s> Can someone help? </s>

<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I should have done that. </s>
<s> I didn't see a way to do it with NAS. </s>
<s> Does the PS3 need a computer running one of those programs on the network or can online storage be accessed by a PS3? </s>
<s> As the links suggest we can't just pop a share or NAS out and have it use it. </s>
