THe idiot that I am, I compressed the wire and suddenly saw sparks, and a message popped up alerting me of a hardware failure, and suddenly my computer shut off. Now when I try to turn it on, it just hangs on me. The computer turns on, but nothing starts and nothing beeps--the cd drive doesn't run nor does the floppy drive. I thought it might be the harddrive that got fried, so I bought a new one, but that still didn't work. My computer-tech friend looked at my computer and tested all the components except the motherboard, and they seemed to work fine. So my question is, is it possible for the motherboard to fail due to a short-circuited mouse? I'm just wanting to make sure before I buy a new motherboard.

All I can think of is that when you put the wires back together, they were mismatched, and the voltage ended up going where it shouldn't have. This very well could have caused the failure, and if your friend has already tested everything else, it looks like the mobo did get fried.

Have you tried leaving the PS 2 mouse port disconnected and using a USB mouse?? Will your system boot up to the first video screen with nothing connected to the mobo except video card, memory, CPU/HSF, the power supply and the front panel connections? No mouse, no keyboard?? You may have zapped the I/O chip on the mobo, and possibly the Southbridge chip. Sounds as if you need a new mobo.
