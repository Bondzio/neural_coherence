after you install the second monitor and reboot, it will be running in clone mode (identical display) by default.
right-click on the desktop and select properties.
select settings.
you should see two monitors (1 and 2).
below the monitors should be two check boxes (probably greyed out).
if you see two monitors, click on &quot;2.&quot; the two checkboxes should now be available.
select the second box (extend my windows...).
full-screen applications like wow will run on one monitor only, but will change the resolution of both monitors.
maximized apps, like mozilla will maximize in one screen only, but can be dragged to whatever screen you want.
you can also resize them manually to both screens at the same time.
(be aware that, although you can have different resolutions on each monitor, i don't recommend it.
it makes screen swapping much harder to get used to.)
with two monitors, you will be able to have, say, your word processor and web browser up at the same time.
moving between them is easy; just move your mouse to the monitor of your choice.
it's like an extension of your desktop.
