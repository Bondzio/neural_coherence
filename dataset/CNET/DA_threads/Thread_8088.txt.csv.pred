1.1.1	Running Microsoft XP Home edition SP2 on an eMachines T3958 Intel Celeron CPU 2.93GHz, 504 MB of RAM.	St
1.1.2	I have been using this DVD burner for a couple of years with no problems.	St
1.1.3	Now I've got a problem.	St
1.1.4	When I view it under My Computer it is listed as a CD drive.	St
1.1.5	It will write data and burn DVD's with Sonic Record Now but the DVD's only play on the computer not on a standard DVD player.	St
1.1.6	I get disc error when trying to play.	St
1.1.7	I use the DVD burner to record home movies.	St
1.1.8	The programs I normally use are Super DVD Creator and Ultra DVD Ceator.	St
1.1.9	However now when I run those programs the field that shows the recording device is completely blank.	St
1.1.10	It used to show _NEC DVD_RW ND-3500AG.	St
1.1.11	I have AVG free version 8 and ran full scan.	St
1.1.12	I also ran a deep scan with Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware.	St
1.1.13	Drive still will not work.	St
1.1.14	I went to device manager, which says it is working fine, and right-clicked to uninstall drive.	St
1.1.15	Rebooted and Windows automatically detected new hardware to be installed but it was recognized again as a CD drive.	St
1.1.16	Read on another forum to try XP_CD-DVD-Fix by Doug Knox and it did not help.	St
1.1.17	I have had some problems with malware on my computer and something disabled my system restore so I cannot restore to an earlier date.	St
1.1.18	I've done everything I can think of and pray that somebody on this forum can help me.	St
1.1.19	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Some try for months to avoid replacing an old drive.	St
1.2.2	What I learned is to give the software approach a try then swap the drive.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I know a little bit about computers but I would be too scared to try replacing the drive myself.	St
1.3.2	Getting someone else to do it is costly.	St
1.3.3	So I'd probably go the external USB route.	St
1.3.4	But that's at least $60 on eBay at the cheapest and of course money is tight these days.	St
1.3.5	I just wanted to make sure I had exhausted all possible avenues before buying a new one.	St
1.3.6	Anybody got any other suggestions for me on how to fix this one?	St
1.4.1	Let's say that the usual software tasks are done and you tried a lens cleaner.	St
1.4.2	Replacing a desktop drive is a simple cheap task.	St
1.4.3	About 25 to 30 at newegg.com or geeks.com Externals are a great idea.	St
1.4.4	http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=GSA-E60L-NP&cat=DVD seems less than 60.	St
1.5.1	That looks a lot better than what I was considering on eBay!	St
1.5.2	I think I'll just skip all the frustration and purchase a new one:)	St
