1.1.1	I'm getting a budget video card, and I heard that Geforce 6800 is the best for my price range, 160-180.	St
1.1.2	I have a aGP slot.	St
1.1.3	Which one of these is better?	St
1.1.4	Is there something else that is better than these for the price?	St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.1.6	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150106 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130202	St
1.2.1	The 6600 GT is way more powerful than the 6800 vanilla....	St
1.2.2	Here's a good price for it.... http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1642902&CatId=1560 Hope you can get this one... My friend got one and now he can play any game at any settings with jaw-dropping results!!!	St
1.2.3	Good Luck, and peace out!!	St
1.2.4	!	St
1.3.1	due to the 4 extra pipelines and 256 bit memory interface... versus the 6600gts 8 pixelp ipelines and only 128bit memory interface the extra money for the 6800 is worth it.	St
1.4.1	and has more reviews...i would go for the evga one.	St
1.4.2	but both evga and xfx are great brands.	St
1.5.1	Since the 6800 is slightly better than the 6600GT because it has 4 more pixel pipelines, it makes sense to get the 6800.	St
1.5.2	But just the original 6800 won't give you awesome gaming performance, unless you overclock it like I do, which will definetly give you a extra boost in frame rates....	St
1.6.1	I have there products and because the EVGA card has a D-sub connector.	St
1.6.2	Wouldn't have to use the adapter to hook up to an analog monitor.	St
1.6.3	One small thing I wouldn't need to remember to bring with me when I go somewhere.	St
1.6.4	Never purchased any XFX stuff, yet.	St
1.6.5	I will, though, eventually.	St
1.7.1	Check this out: http://firingsquad.com/hardware/geforce_6800_unlocking/ You can unlock 4 extra pipelines and make the 6800 into a 6800GT, this only works for the AGP cards.	St
1.7.2	Next step is to overclock with coolbits: http://www.iamnotageek.com/a/39-p1.php Do these two things and you'll have a rocking card at a low price.	St
1.7.3	Buy the lowest priced 6800 card, none of them stray very far, if at all, from the nVidia reference design.	St
1.7.4	Please don't be mad at me if you nuke your registry, or mess up your system, extreme caution should be taken when modifiying any software or system files!	St
1.8.1	dont.	St
1.8.2	i wouldnt unlock though as i remember reading something how it decreases memory speed or something,	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
