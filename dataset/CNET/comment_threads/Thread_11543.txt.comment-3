just delete it in Device Manager, restart, and see if it finds the driver.
The question mark means that the driver is either not installed or was corrupted during installation and needs to be reinstalled.
Did you get a CD/floppy with the drivers on it?
If so, you'll need it when you restart.
Then follow the onscreen instructions.
Good luck!
