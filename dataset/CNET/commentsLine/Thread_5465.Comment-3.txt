i'm not aware of any file on a hd that will block the machine from post.
if the machine &quot;did&quot; beep after post and now does not....make it smaller.
work with the bios....get the machine to beep.
you don't need for a beep.
hd's floppies optical other unplug that stuff.....get the machine to beep.
