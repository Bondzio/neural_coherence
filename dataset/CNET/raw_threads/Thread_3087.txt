Whenever I help one of my friends with their computer, I install SpywareBlaster, Spybot-Search & Destroy, and Ad-aware. If they don't have antivirus protection, I install AVG Free. On my own computer, I also have Atomic Clock Sync, Moffsoft FreeCalc, Notesholder Lite (handy reminders and notes), ShortKeys Lite (simple way to enter things like often-used addresses), Weatherbug, Webshots, Citi Virtual Account Numbers (from my Citibank credit card service), Auction Sentry for eBay, and Photoshop Elements. On my kids' computer, I also have Webroot Spy Sweeper for additional protection with scheduled updating and scanning for spyware threats. The vast majority of my favorite utilities are free.

This free utility has been a real boon. There are various automation features, but I just have a couple of separate jobs I created that I manually initiate at the end of the day. Not only does it ensure that the files are in sync, but you have the added benefit of an automatic backup onto another machine.

Some ppl post so much that in haste, they make typos from time to time. For others, English ain't their native language. The fact that the latter could actually converse on these english forums is impressive enough. I would much rather receive a reply that has its fair share of typos and spelling mistakes, and grammar woes like &quot;their&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;they're&quot;, and &quot;theyre&quot; that are helpful and answer questions to those with correct spelling and grammar that don't really contribute anything. Of course there is a limit to how much can be tolerated, as there is a threshold where a post is just unreadable, but IMO, this thread isn't the case

If you've used Mac OS or linux before, you know that windows are capable of more than just minimized, maximized, and restore. This utility also lets you maximize vertically, maximize horizontally, set a window to alwasy be on top, shade (just leave the title bar), and even minimize windows to system tray. ScreenPrint32* takes screenshots. Let's u save images in 4 major formats, whole screen or partials, and even to set naming schemes Magnifier* this basic utilty comes with Windows. When i wanna zoom in on pictures or text, it's quicker to use this than to DL and blow it up in M$ Paint and Fax Viewer IconConverter Not a necessity, but now that I have it, I can spice up my folders and desktop icons with custom icons VirtualDub* compress, convert, and tweak (screen size, aspect ratios, filters) video clips winzip 7-zip* may be better for file compressions, but I'm already used to this, and it's paid for too. winrar again, I got winrar before i heard about 7-zip. Otherwise, 7zip would probably have replaced winzip and winrar WinAmp* I don't do anything fancy other than basic playlists, equilizer settings, and skins SpyBot search & destroy* + Ad Aware* scans and removes ad/spyware and configures settings prevent/block 'em as well Norton AntiVirus 2005 It work's adequately for now. In the future, maybe I'll switch to Avast*, AVG*, or some other freeware AV apps if the renewal fee for NAV becomes ridiculously high.
