There is no automatic search for new space in order to continue on as it were.
The system uses what it is &quot;directed&quot; to place data.
Once the new HD is installed, you need to either tell the system/pgm.
where to place data or configure it to do so.
The original pgm.
is the method to place whatever data is stored at, you may or will need as stated configure to a larger storage area if that's what you mean this is not done automatically.
