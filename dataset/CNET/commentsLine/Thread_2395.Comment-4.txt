ok, without the make, model of the printer i can't answer about color carts.
but in a nutshell just look at the offerings.
it will sink in quickly.
refills?
sorry, 2 decades of watching others try and i decided to never do that myself.
instead i only print what i really really really (times infinity) need.
big savings.
