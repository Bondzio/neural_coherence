my first pc was an amstrad computer.
it had a 4 digit processor number (8086 or 8088, i forget which) and had two 5-1/4 floppy drives and no hard drive at all.
you had the operating system (dos 3, i believe) on one floppy and your application on another.
my next one was a screamer: 80486 running at 66 mhz with a 540mb hard drive and a 3.5 floppy drive and cd rom drive.
