build it, you won't regeret it.
for 2k you can build a pretty decent system and then you know what you have.
it is not hard to do, by the time you get done you will be surprised at the result.
for 2k (or less) you can build a slick system, far superior to what you can buy retail, unless you spend a ton of money and go to alienware.
just do it, you will have fun!!!
good luck!!
