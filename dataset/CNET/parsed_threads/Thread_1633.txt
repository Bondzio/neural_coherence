<s> Have two strips of 128. </s>
<s> If I buy a third of 256 do I have to arrange them so the biggest is in the first slot? </s>
<s> This is determined by the machine in question. </s>
<s> Most machines don't have such a requirement. </s>

<s> BTW, this is a newly installed MB by PC Chips with an AMD K7 processor. </s>
<s> RAM is DDR333 PC2700 if that means anything. </s>
<s> Old WinME still in place. </s>
<s> If it was me I would browse through the mobo manual and see if there was a ref to such an issue. </s>
<s> If not, I would install the new stick in the next available slot and test. </s>
<s> It's a &quot;good rule of thumb&quot; to place largest ram first, but that's not absolute. </s>
<s> Alot depends on the ram mapping as the mtrbd. </s>
<s> maker usually provides in how ram can be installed. </s>
<s> Check the manual, usually this is provided at thier support website for that model mtrbd. </s>
<s> or actual manual or on driver/info CD provided. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I don't know for shure, but you can bet that first the 256Mb than the other 2. </s>
<s> IT WILL RUN IN ANY ORDER, HOWEVER, ARE THEY ALL SAME MANUFACTURE & QUALITY? </s>
<s> LOWER LATENCY MAY BE BEST FIRST. </s>
<s> MB SIZE ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT AS EACH MEMORY ROW IS ACCESSED INDIVIDUALLY. </s>
<s> IF IT SEEMS TO RUN WORSE, TRY JUST 256 MB STICK ALONE, TRY VARIOUS COMBOS. </s>
<s> IT SHOULDN'T HAVE PRECEPTIABLE EFFECT. </s>
<s> HECK CALL MAIN & MEM MANUFACTURERS IF YOU WANT MORE OPINIONS. </s>
<s> WHY NOT MOST EXPENSIVE FIRST? </s>
<s> WEAR LATEX GLOVES WHEN HANDLING MEMORY, -=NEVER=- TOUCH STICK WITH BARE FINGERS OR IT WILL RESONATE POORLY DUE TO SKIN OILS/CONTANIMENTS.SIGNED:PHYSICIAN THOMAS STEWART VON DRASHEK M.D. </s>
<s> When I first start in computers, in '83, I was always told that you put the fastest memory first (this is just a carryover from earlier times when you bought memory in nanosecond speeds - 100, 90, 80, etc. </s>
<s> nanoseconds). </s>
<s> Next I was always taught that you should put the largest stick first, etc. </s>
<s> Reasoning being that what you're doing might require over 250mb and if you put 2 128s first then the &quot;overflow&quot; carries over to the 2nd stick, instead of just the 256 if it was put in the 1st slot. </s>
<s> Pretty simple explanation, of a complexe issue, but it'll get the job done. </s>
<s> Should not make any difference. </s>
<s> Ensure that the computer is reading the memory. </s>
<s> During boot up you should see, at the top of your screen, the memory being tested or at least displayed as total memory. </s>
<s> You can also check total memory installed after boot through System Properties. </s>
<s> Just make sure that all sticks are DDR333 PC2700, or that the faster stick is backwards compatible. </s>
<s> FSB is a issue here. </s>
<s> And it's a rule of thumb to install the larger stick in slot-1. </s>
<s> Unless specified by the motherboard manufacturer, Install chips from the smallest size to the largest size. </s>
<s> Picture it this way, would you rathaer place a waterhose with a 2&quot; output into another hose with a 1&quot; output or the other way around? </s>
<s> If the larger module is installed first and then you have to begin using the smaller ones then the larger one has to unload its supply into smaller &quot;waterhoses&quot; It's best to do it the other way. </s>
