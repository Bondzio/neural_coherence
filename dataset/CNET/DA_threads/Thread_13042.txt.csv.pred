1.1.1	I want to build a new PC and am looking for suggestions for specs and specific brands of motherboards etc .	St
1.1.2	Also where have you had the best luck purchasing components .	St
1.1.3	I am not a gamer nor do I do a lot of high end processing and do n't need a top of line speed or high end video .	St
1.1.4	Prob a dual core .	St
1.1.5	Want to do 2 hard drives .	St
1.1.6	1 for the OS ( may want to do a dual boot ) and 1 for evything else .	St
1.1.7	Suggestions appreciated .	Polite
1.1.8	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	since you & quot ; not a gamer & quot ; and do n't & quot ; do a lot of high end processing & quot ; , you wo n't save any money building one yourself .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the feedback but that really does n't answer my question .	St
1.3.2	I 've never built one from bottom up before and want to do it to learn .	St
1.3.3	So I realize I may pay a little more , but am willing to do so .	St
1.4.1	And not from forums but places like tomshardware.com	St
1.5.1	if you can only afford $ 500 .	St
1.5.2	likewise , why suggest a $ 800 build if you are willing to pay $ 1200 ?	Ques
1.5.3	if you just want the pleasure of building a pc , and you do n't have any special needs , then realize that it may perform no better than the $ 400 weekly special ( that often come with printer and/or monitor like this one ) but it will likely cost more .	St
1.5.4	just giving you notice in advance so you do n't get a case of buyers ( builders ) remorse .	St
1.5.5	here 's a $ 600 build that i suggested for another poster but it 's a small form factor ( mini sized ) since it 's intended use is to watch TV : http : //my.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=290837 & messageID=2747850 & tag=mcnt # 2747850	St
1.6.1	Why not get some PCs from craigslist for free/dirt cheap and just rip them apart and upgrade them ?	Ques
1.6.2	Good will sells all of their PCs for $ 15 .	St
1.6.3	I have see a few P3s there and I still use a P3 as my workstation .	St
1.6.4	( It has 2x15GB IDE drives raided together for a swap file , 512MB Ram , 1x 40gb drive for storage , 1x20gb drive for OS and a DVD burner . )	St
1.6.5	It is n't a speed demon but with a dedicated video card ( free ) it runs XP nicely .	St
1.7.1	Great idea .	Polite
1.7.2	I hand't though about that .	St
