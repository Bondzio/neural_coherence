<s> I'm building a new computer and am not sure which motherboard to get. </s>
<s> I'm going to be getting an AMD X2 4200 or 4400 (not sure yet on AM2 or socket 939 any suggestions on that?) </s>
<s> I assume the AM2 is newer, so if the opportunity is there to get one for AM2 should I jump on it? </s>
<s> Anyway, I know this would have to be 2 different reccomendations since I'm not sure on the socket. </s>
<s> I will also be purchasing an ATI X1900 graphics card and a Hauppauge 500 dualtv tuner. </s>
<s> I saw a couple Asus motherboards that received very high reviews, but I saw it talk about SLI, which I figure I would not use since I have an ATI graphics card and won't be putting 2 in my machine. </s>
<s> One of the cards I was looking at was the A8N SLI Deluxe which received very good reviews. </s>
<s> Another was the ASUS A8R32-MVP Deluxe but I know someone that has had a lot of problems with it. </s>
<s> Any reccomendations would be great, Thanks, ~J </s>
<s> I'm not really compelled to jump on the AM2 bandwagon... </s>
<s> It's not a giant leap over 939, it's a babystep to DDR2. </s>
<s> The next big thing for AMD will be K8L in 2007, which isn't too far away. </s>
<s> As far as a 939 board, the DFI LanParty nF4 UltraD overclocks exceptionally well, but only if you have a good idea of what you're doing, or if you get good advice from someone that knows what they're doing. </s>
<s> If you want to overclock, but you're not too familiar with how to go about doing it, Abit has some really good boards that you should look in to (I have an AT8). </s>
<s> They feature the uGuru overclocking utility - it's an easy way to get a good OC. </s>
<s> One of the GREAT things about Abit is the support that you get at their forums from other Abit users. </s>
<s> Re: processor - if you're waiting for the price drop in a week or two, go for it. </s>
<s> If you were planning on spending somewhere around 400, do yourself a favor and get an Opteron 165 or 170 instead. </s>
<s> They work with any board that supports dual-core 939s. </s>
<s> i'm just looking into this stuff, what new chip is coming out in a few weeks causing the price drop? </s>
<s> End of July we talkin? </s>
<s> Ok I just got back into looking at things and thought that AM2 was going to be the new standard, either way I thought it was better than 939. </s>
<s> I'm not interested in overclocking right away atleast, possibly down the road. </s>
<s> Ill check with Abit, as well as Asus. </s>
<s> I really want a highly rated board. </s>
<s> What is the difference between an Opteron and the other chip I was looking at like the 4200 Manchester or Windsor. </s>
<s> A lot better chip? </s>
<s> Will I notice a performance difference? </s>
<s> I don't know anything about them compared to the ones I was looking at. </s>
<s> I see price wise it's just about the same. </s>
<s> I appreciate the help, thanks, ~J </s>
<s> Is the new chip, code named Conroe I believe. </s>
<s> Woodcrest is the server version that competes with Opteron if you are curious. </s>
<s> Woodcrest is the new Intel Xeon processors. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> Based on early benchmarks, AM2 offers 3-4% performance increase over 939, I believe. </s>
<s> I was in the same position as you - looking at a 4200 or 4400 X2, but ended up going with a 170 based on the user reviews. </s>
<s> The main difference? </s>
<s> Most chips are produced with a certain (high) level of performance in mind. </s>
<s> Towards the end of production, they're 'binned' - they test each one, knowing that there will be variances in performance - out of the same batch of CPUs, some will end up being $300 CPUs, some will end up 1000 CPUs. </s>
<s> Opterons are some of the better performing and most sturdy - server-class. </s>
<s> They're selected with the premise that they'll be on, running 100% load, 24/7/365 for years and it's possibly because of this that they OC so incredibly well. </s>
<s> Okay, 4200, 4400, Opty 170 - difference between the 4200 and the 4400 is the L2 cache - twice the size in the 4400. </s>
<s> The Optys all have that larger L2 cache, but the clock multiplier is lower. </s>
<s> Both the 4200 & 4400 have an 11X multi (core clock X multi = CPU speed, in this case, 200mhz x 11 = 2200mhz = 2.2ghz) the 170 has a 10X multi, the 165 a 9X multi with the same stock 200mhz core clock speed... but they OC well - you can increase that significantly. </s>
<s> I normally run my 170 24/7 at 260 X 10 = 2.6ghz or FX60 speed, although I can run it a little higher. </s>
<s> Some people run'em at 280*10, some 300*10, some higher... let's put it this way - if you DON'T get it to run 260*10, something's not right! </s>
<s> So how long will it be for these chips to fall in price? </s>
<s> Id figure the drop would be substantial, is there a new chip coming out at the end of the month? </s>
<s> So I assume you are saying that this trip would run better than the 4200 or 4000 X2. </s>
<s> If I do get it, is there a motherboard I should look for that would work well with it? </s>
<s> Also, any reccomendations on memory? </s>
<s> I wanted to get 2GB. </s>
<s> Thanks, ~J </s>
<s> That's the dilemma for you - it's not likely that the Opterons will drop in price - they're not technically consumer chips, and the Opteron division is healthy - no reason for them to cut prices. </s>
<s> The X2s will be dropping by up to 50% in the next couple of weeks in anticipation of competition with Intel's Conroes. </s>
<s> They next motherboard that I will buy for a 939 will be the DFI LanParty nF4 Ultra. </s>
<s> Pair that with an Opteron 165 or 170 with 2gigs OCZ PC4000 ram, and you'll likely hit 300+ X 9 or 10 = 2.7 - 3.0 ghz + with the proper settings. </s>
<s> So, you have to decide - go with an X2 in the $200 region, or spend another $150-200 on a chip that has the potential for 3.0 ghz. </s>
<s> I'm new to overclocking. </s>
<s> If I do decide to go that route and get the Opteron and that board to overclock it, is it easy to do? </s>
<s> Is there somewhere I can go that would guide me through it? </s>
<s> It'd definitely something I would do assuming I wouldn't be damaging any of my new parts, or decreasing their longevity. </s>
<s> I would assume I would need to buy new fans in order to overclock it is that right? </s>
<s> Intel Conroe will come out very high in price I would assume, so it's probably not something I'd be interested in looking for, I might just go this route. </s>
<s> I appreciate all of your help so far, thank you very much, ~J </s>
<s> It's not too tough, it just takes patience... and having someone very knowledgeable goes a long way! </s>
<s> I got some good advice from the guys at the Abit forums, but what really opened it up was the advice I got after joining the Abit Wolves Fold@Home Team. </s>
<s> You don't necessarily need to have an Abit board to join, we have our own forums with restricted sections for members. </s>
<s> There are several VERY knowledgeable guys that you can ask any number of questions, from selecting components to RAM settings to voltages. </s>
<s> There's always a risk with overclocking, but the more you know, the more you can manage it. </s>
<s> Temps and voltage are the things that you really want to keep an eye on - if they get out of hand, it'll shorten the lifespan of your equipment - That's why I usually run at 260*10, because it's the highest I cane run without bumping the voltage from the stock range. </s>
<s> It can certainly be run higher with a little more voltage and still be in the low-risk range, but my CPU is ALWAYS at 100% load and I never turn my rig off... As far as CPU cooling - the stock coolers with the Opterons are actually pretty good - it's a 4 heat-pipe design. </s>
<s> If you want to cool things down a little more, there's the Zalman CPNS 9500 - it's one of the better aircoolers out there. </s>
