your &quot;my documents&quot; folders and sub-folder but just random files from the hard drive, did you?
All you really needed was what you created or saved in the way of personal data and not files from programs.
Sorry, but I can't picture at all what you did now or what the files were.
You said the old drive was &quot;moderately functional&quot;.
Is it possible that it still may be in that condition?
If so, a USB enclosure might allow you access to your &quot;my documents&quot; folder to just extract what you have deliberately saved.
There may also be stuff in the downloads folder if you used the default Windows structure.
