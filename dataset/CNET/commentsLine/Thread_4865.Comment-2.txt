since you do not give details on this, what was the status of your system before this?
was this a working system?
if so, take out the seagate drive and put the other drive back in.
if all ok, bad drive.
if this is not the case and the system never was started before, try a different drive or try the drive in question in another system.
while i have not used a drive of that size, from the specs it does not use any more power than smaller drives and should not overwhelm the power supply.
