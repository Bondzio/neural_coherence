1.1.1	I installed a program called SpeedFan 4.32 just to check my computer temperature .	St
1.1.2	When I installed it and it first ran , the temps were : CPU 51c Ambient 37c HD0 41c HD1 39c When I turned the computer off for the night and restarted it , the temps were : CPU 42c Ambient 23c HD0 20c HD1 19C I let the computer on while I was out today and when I returned , all the fans were running in the computer Normally , the computer is almost silent .	St
1.1.3	With the fans running , the temps were : CPU 38c Ambient 28c HD0 32c HD1 31C Should all of the fans be running 100 % and is it possible that I lost a hard drive because it overheated ?	Ques
1.2.1	The temps look normal , very normal .	St
1.2.2	Without speedfan the fans do a fair job .	St
1.2.3	Running speedfan enables the fans to 100 % and the machine is cooler .	St
1.2.4	But do n't put too much stock in those temp sensors .	St
1.2.5	I get two different temps when comparing SpeedFan to Everest .	St
1.2.6	Just looking at the numbers , your machine and drives are well below any danger zone .	St
1.2.7	If you lost a drive it 's not because of temperature .	St
1.3.1	HD a few months ago , and now I am only guessing that it may have been heat related .	St
1.3.2	Should I let SpeedFan control the fans and let them run ?	Ques
1.3.3	What is the best way to get the correct temps ?	Ques
1.4.1	and it will automatically adjust your fans to maintain those temps .	St
1.4.2	if you like quiet , raise the temps .	St
1.4.3	cpu 50c , ambient 35c , and hd 35c should make for a quiet pc and reasonably cool temps .	St
1.5.1	If you maintain your system cleaning and just use it as a typical one , the monitoring fan pgms .	St
1.5.2	just report and really do n't do much .	St
1.5.3	More often than not , you will get various different status reports , as long as they do n't goto to extremes , you 're OK .	St
1.5.4	If you run a system more into extremes like gaming or intense usage , then *maybe* the more intelligent fan monitoring pgms .	St
1.5.5	can help but even then I thought very much .	St
1.5.6	If anything an alarm is the best setting to use to get your attention , but typical bios setting do that anyways .	St
1.5.7	The monitoring pgms .	St
1.5.8	wo n't do anything but report if you do n't use variable fans that can vary their RPM s , so take that into account .	St
1.5.9	Alas , having good quality fans and large ones if possible help to reduce noise and/or reduce fan failure .	St
1.5.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	The temps looked good before you installed SpeedFan .	St
1.6.2	I 'd uninstall SpeedFan .	St
1.6.3	The temps are really on the low side which is good .	St
1.6.4	I doubt if the failure was heat related .	St
1.7.1	I always thought my computer was very quiet ( too quiet perhaps ) when I bought it .	St
1.7.2	I do n't know why the HD failed or really if it were the HD that failed .	St
1.7.3	But since replacing it , the system seems to be fine	St
1.8.1	I just want to know what HD1 stand for because my HD1 temp allot higher than my HD0 ?	Ques
1.8.2	Plz reply	St
