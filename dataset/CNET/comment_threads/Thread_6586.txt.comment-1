Hi, My 40G laptop HD has some bad sectors.
By trial and error I have been able to isolate the bad area.
I have partitioned off the good sector (25G) and left the bad part (15G) unallocated using XP's disk management tool and reinstalled XP on the 25GB partition.
So far its working well.
My question is will the bad part spill over to the good part over time and cause problem?
Thanks in advance.
