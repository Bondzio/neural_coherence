If I connect one computer to the switch through LAN cable and another computer to the wireless router through WiFi, will both computer be able to go onto the internet? Sorry about the long question, but it's just that the logistics of the rooms and stuff makes things difficult. Cheers

Connect your switch to one of the ports in the router. Why would you need a switch anyway. Do you have more than 3 computers you want to hardwire or are you just experimenting?

The modem gives you one ipaddress (unless its a combo) and the router is a NAT that essentially subdivides that one number and sends the message to the proper computer which can be wired or wireless (if it's a wireless router). Kind of like a veteran mailman who gets a mail that don't have the address. He knows everyone in town and knows that the mail belong to this house and not that. The switch cannot translate. It's like a new mailman and knows virtually no one in town. Whatever address he sees on the mail, that where goes to put it, but he would be lost if the address wasn't there. The NAT (router) is a smart device that knows which computer out of 10 computers in your house ask for the message from the internet. The switch is not that smart. He dropped out of college. This is not a technical explanation, but it gives you an idea.

It's just that the Modem is in my room while the router is very far away (the wiring from the modem to the router is inside the wall), I don't want to have a cable going all the way from the router to the computer so was thinking of some way of hooking the computer straight onto the modem without disconnecting the router. Thanks for the quick reply, guess I'll just have to go with wireless then.

Just take the router and connect a patch cable (short cable) to it (WAN side) and plug the other end into the modem. Take the long cable from the modem that is in the wall and plug it in one of the port of the router. Take another patch cable and plug one end to your computer and the other to the router. At the end of the long cable in the other room, get a switch and plug in as many computer as you want (limited to the number of ports, of course). modem &gt; router &gt; 1st port your computer, 2nd port long cable to the other room &gt; switch.

I am also setting up a network at home and plan to have modem&gt;router&gt;switch. However, is it possible to connect some computers and devices to the router's extra ports and the rest of the home's devices to the router? This is mainly because of geographical constraints (the router has to be in my office room which has only one drop)\ Many Thanks.
