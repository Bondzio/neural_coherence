Did you ever find a solution to your question?
I have the same questions.
Does anyone out there know of ways to have a laptop get internet access in a park or on a lake or in a car?
The cell co's ARE expensive and need monthly service plans, and what if you're not near their towers?
Do they &quot;roam&quot; like a cell phone and use other co's towers?
What about a satellite company like he asks about.
Anyone know who the &quot;satellite&quot; companies are?
(not for putting a dish in home/office, but for when outside or travelling!)
Thanks!
