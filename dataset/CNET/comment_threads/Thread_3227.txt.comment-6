The bigger size is for folk that want to carry 32 or more GB of audio or other files.
My tablets get from 8 to 32 GB memory (I'm working with a company on Android apps.)
And that's been plenty for us.
The iPad 2 has very nice accessories too.
Nice unit and what most other tablets want to be compared to.
