Ive just bought a new PC with Windows XP installed on it, but I have another hardrive from my old computer also with Windows XP on it, is there anyway I can get my old files to the new computer and then use the old hardrive as a secondary drive? Could I install the old hardrive as a secondary drive and boot up the edition of Windows XP on there and just copy the files over?? Any help would be great. Cheers

That simply gives the desktop et al settings so that each account has the screen that they prefer. You can get into any file from either account and even if you skip the account by hiting enter. I think that XP has a file settings and Transfer wizard that'll do it all for you and keep the dll links so that the applications will still work, Simply dragging and dropping does not always maintain those links and then you have to reinsall the Application [you will not lose the data though]. Post this in the XP forum with a very descriptive subject line. Hopefully David Chan will see it and provide excellent support.

I am told this works better. --fj ps do cable select on the jumpers.

My objective is to install a new hardrive with windows XP only and nothing else. I plan to install an XP Pro upgrade after doing this. What is the best way to go about this? Can I put the existing windows program files on a flash drive and boot the new hardrive with it? Suggestions please!
