<s> Hello all, I was just wondering what is a good method of non-professional monitor calibration. </s>
<s> I can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars to buy those calibration equipments but I recently noticed the difference in few pictures on Mac and PC screen. </s>
<s> Mac was much better so I think I need to calibrate my PC monitor. </s>
<s> Any suggestions are welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
