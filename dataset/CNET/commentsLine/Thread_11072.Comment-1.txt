i am interested in upgrading a dell 400sc computer that currently runs a celeron 2.4ghz with 512mb of ram.
i already have 2gb of ram for the upgrade and am thinking of buying an intel 3.0ghz prescot 800mhz 478 pin.
my question concerns compatibility.
from everything i read the 400sc uses an 800fsb motherboard with a 478 pin processor socket.
so the prescot would work?
also, what do i have to do with regards to a heat sink or fan?
any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
thanks in advance...
