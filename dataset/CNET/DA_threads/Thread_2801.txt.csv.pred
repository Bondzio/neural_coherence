1.1.1	I was going through Newegg looking for parts to build a gaming rig , and came across two processors , both Intel i5 's , and both 1156 chipsets .	St
1.1.2	My question was , Should I go with the Quad core one at 2.8 GHz , or the Dual core one at 3.2 GHz ?	Ques
1.1.3	The dual core is cheaper , and I have heard that the higher clock speed is better for games , while more cores are better for things like Photoshop that are written to be CPU dependent .	St
1.1.4	I 'm sure both will work , but is it worth saving the $ 30 and losing two cores ?	Ques
1.2.1	Most i5s have hyperthreaded cores so you see 4 cores in task manager .	St
1.2.2	And then the i5 has the turbo boost to let a core clock up dynamically .	St
1.2.3	My bet is the i5 will consistently beat the older Core 2 Quad core CPUs .	St

1.3.1	And what if I went with an AMD Phenom X4 ?	Ques
1.3.2	I found a nice looking one at 3.5GHz on newegg for $ 190ish .	St
1.3.3	I know Intel tends to be more on the cutting edge , but I 'm trying to stay under $ 1000 , and I need to focus on the gpu more than the cpu , because the rig I want to build will be for games primarily .	St
1.4.1	You could check the CPU charts are tomshardware.com to see but I do n't use the AMD units anymore since I do n't want to sacrifice my time getting such things sorted out .	St
