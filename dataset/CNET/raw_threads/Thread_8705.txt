I bought an LCD monitor with a: DVI-D dual input ..and a Vid card with a: DVI-I dual input ..and I have a DVI-I single input ------------ Picture for details: http://xs104.xs.to/xs104/06326/dvi-config-1_edit.gif The picture shows the cable in RED, the VGA and LCD's complementary inputs in green and violet. ------------ Now the DVI-I cable won't fit into the LCD's hub, but will fit into the Vid card's. The only thing preventing fitting to the LCD is the 4 pins (around the flat pin) you see in the photo. Would removing them manually cause any conflicts? Because the alternative choice now is to buy a DVI-D cable which has no pins around the flat thing. What do you think? Thanks.
