I had it set up under the RAID configuration so I have not lost any data. What I would like to know is can I replace the bad drive with the following WD 500GB harddrive WD5000AAKS? The bad drive has the following on it WD5000KS. They are both SATA drives and it looks like it will work, but I'd like to get some input. Thanks
