think it over very carefully.
some get confused over the wan and lan settings.
you claim above its an isp changing the ip address so no where should we be tinkering with the lan settings.
also, you have to extend your thinking to &quot;how things work&quot; in regards to what a disconnect could do to help us fix this.
i know many that will insist the documentation suggest that this could or should be used to some specific issue but you asked for ideas so here they are.
