<s> Periodically, both &quot;Enter&quot; keys on my stock Dell keyboard stop working (both the standard enter key & the enter key on the numeric kepad on the right). </s>
<s> I have swapped in a known good keyboard, but the enter key continues not to work. </s>
<s> The system is a stock Dell desktop (1.8 GHz Centrino, Windows XP) with Dell keyboard, Dell monitor (motherboard graphics), Dell mouse, Dell 802.11b USB wireless ethernet adapter. </s>
<s> Sometimes, a reboot fixes the problem... and then it reappears. </s>
<s> In an attempt to fix this problem, I have uninstalled the keyboard driver & allowed the system to reboot so that Windows &quot;finds the new hardware&quot; and then installs a new driver, and reboots... this solves the problem for a while, but then it returns. </s>
<s> I'm at my wits end! </s>
<s> Any ideas on what I might do to fix this issue? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You may need to visit the Dell support website and check for updated driver. </s>
<s> Hint: Be sure that you know the exact model # of your keyboard. </s>
<s> Be sure that your computer is free from all virus, adware, spyware, etc. </s>
<s> If you haven't already, run ad-aware, Spybot, CWShredder, and also run a virus scan with Norton or other anti-virus program. </s>
<s> Many thanks -- I tried Spybot & cleared out everything... it seems to have fixed the problem. </s>
