i haven't oc'd anything myself.
i bought a custom build pc from a very reputable company.
the ram is a kingston hyper x made to run at the speed it runs at.
the i7 2600k is a cpu made to be overclocked, hence the k. the overclock on it has always been moderate, barely pushing it at all.
everything else is at stock level, i have never had my cpu or any other components anything past moderately warm and the usage is never that high.
also voltage has always been stock.
so what was that about me pushing my pc?
more than likely it seems to be a psu failure and i have a feeling the cpu cooler pump has gone, i'm just hoping the motherboard is at least ok...
