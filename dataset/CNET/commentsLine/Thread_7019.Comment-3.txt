actually, the majority (say 6 or so) data loss issues my company has had have been due soley to hardware error.
several went to data-recovery services (who confirmed the hardware-based error base), while several just ended up on a stack of &quot;bad&quot; drives.
the worst case was a single external lacie 1tb drive.
we run multiple levels of security (hardware/software firewall, site-licensed anti-virus), and our user base is extremely familiar with proper saftey protocols.
the drive configurations i'm asking about will be for single-user workstations, so i'm actually leaning toward no raid data redundancy, since the most critical data will be saved to our network storage (which is data-redundant).
thanks for your input anyhow.
