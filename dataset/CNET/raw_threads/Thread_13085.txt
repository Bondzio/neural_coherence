I first read about my system on http://Cnet.com an Emachines T6524. Their specification shows Ram DDR SDRAM PC 3200 @ 400MHZ . When I received my system it came with 1 gig of ram. I added another gig as my first upgrade. Skip 6 months and I'm looking at my systems info and realize that I have 2 gig's of PC 3200 @ 200MHz. So I have my system scaned to see if an upgrade of ram is out there. Sure enough PC3200 @ 400MHz OK now the $64 question If I switch to the 400MHz will I notice a jump in performance? Is it worth the switch? Thanks
