go into the printer software, find printers in control panel click on icon.
there should be an hp printer assistant installed, in the assistant there should be options.
you can set it to print black only from there.
generally for printers to function you need to have all cartridges installed, running just one cartridge in a two cartridge system confuses everything and you may wind up re installing the software to make it function properly.
good luck.
