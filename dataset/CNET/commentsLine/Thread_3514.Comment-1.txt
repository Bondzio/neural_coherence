i desperately want to upgrade my old desktop but am not sure what i can do.
i am running an old gateway g6 350 machine.
i recently upgraded to windows me on this machine to utilize my cable connection, and i need to know how i can improve this machines performance.
i have been considering a new motherboard with faster processor, but was beginning to wonder if i could just plug in a faster processor into my existing board.
i have an atx board with an intel pentium ii processor running 350 mhz.
l2 cache:512, pipeline burst integrated,100 mhz bus speed, package : secc, 1 slot.
running 256mb ram.
this is the only info i have on processor, don't know if it is enough.
i have been looking for info on these subjects for days.can i plug in any atx board with faster chip?
can i plug in any &quot;slot 1&quot; chip?
is there a different &quot;chipset&quot; # or term i need to look for about this processor.
would rather spend $ on upgrading processor than on more ram (only 2 slots).
need help!!
!
