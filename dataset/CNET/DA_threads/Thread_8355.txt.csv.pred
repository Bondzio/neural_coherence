1.1.1	For the last few days I have been recieving beep codes after POST.	St
1.1.2	I have phoenix bios circa year 2000 and the beep pattern consists of two short beeps without any pause in between.	St
1.1.3	For example: BeepBeep, w/ the 2nd immedietly following the first.	St
1.1.4	This beep occurence does not always occur when i boot, but happens spontaneously.	St
1.1.5	Sometimes, following the beeps, I get a message &quot;OS not found&quot; and the system halts.	St
1.1.6	Other times Win 2k just continues loading after the beeps.	St
1.1.7	I have checked internet resources on phoenix codes and listed codes do not match what I have personally heard.	St
1.1.8	Listed phoenix codes follow a pattern such as 1-3-2 or 1-3-3-2, unlike mine.	St
1.1.9	Interestingly, there is an AMI beep code that matches this one which signifies dying RAM.	St
1.1.10	Didnt phoenix buy out ami?	St
1.1.11	specs: generic hp pavilion phoenix bios dated year 2000 Windows 2000 sp4 128 MB RAM	St
1.2.1	http://www.pchell.com/hardware/beepcodes.shtml notes that for Phoenix as well.	St
1.2.2	You can make a boot diskette from http://www.memtest86.com and the only good result is ZERO errors after 8 hours.	St
1.2.3	Given the age of the machine and you noting HARD STARTING, it's either the memory, motherboard capacitors or a power supply that has seen better days (and now has less power capability.)	St
1.2.4	Most of these &quot;computers in a ready to use box&quot; never fitted much more Watts in the PSU than needed.	St
1.2.5	And as users installed another hard disk, a 3D card and more, the power supply strains.	St
1.2.6	Here's a link to the capacitor issue that is well noted on hard starting machines -&gt; http://www.badcaps.net/ident/ Bob	St
