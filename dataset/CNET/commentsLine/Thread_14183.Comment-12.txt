apple iic about 1984. no hd, built in green monitor.
appleworks program provided first experience with wordprocessors and spreadsheets.
most of that has not fundamentally changed.
example: control-c for copy and control-v for paste or insert were apple-c and apple-v respectively.
(apple was a key on the iic.)
the closest thing to the internet was a subscription to compuserve where you used cryptic commands and waited a reply.
like &quot;go wea lax&quot; i think to get the weather in la.
the &quot;fast&quot; response would come trickling across the monitor in simple text that could be seen moving from left to right.
a paragraph could take several seconds.
wow!
printing was on dot-matrix printers.
media for programs and data was with 5.25&quot; floppys that had to be shifted in and out.
i had an external floppy drive in addition to the built in drive which saved a few steps.
(all programs were on floppies because there was no hd.)
surprise- it never crashed, ever.
that came later with ms-dos pcs.
though i have used windows exclusively since because of compatibility with workplace programs, i've always had a 'soft' spot for apple computers - and may again go back.
