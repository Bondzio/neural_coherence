But, I also have a SMC 7004VWBR 4 port wireless router and would like to get all our laptops in my house connected to wireless. Is this wireless router compatible with my Speedtouch UCB adsl modem? Will I be able to set up a wireless system in my house, so that all the laptops w/wireless cards can access the internet? What do I do next? I'm clueless! Or, do I have to resort to buying a combo adsl wireless router/modem? Many thanks, Jenny

No. I haven't seen a wireless router that will use an USB ADSL Modem. Bob

And will this be a fairly easy set up, as in I just have to plug this wireless router/modem into the phone line correct? thanks so much! jenny
