5149	0	253117	2518850	NR	kjang	6/20/07 4:00 AM	1.182312E12	dual core cpu 50 percent usage	having a bit of a problem (as anyone who'd seen my previous posts would know) i have an AMD 5200 X2 dual core cpu and whenever i run a program in processes i can't get the cpu usage for one program to go above which sux becuz im gaming and company of heroes needs more cpu horsepower than 50 percent also like to add it's both cores go to 50 percent it's not just one core or something and if i run any other programs i can get total cpu usage above 50 p.s. sry for my sloppy grammar and poor format
5149	1	253117	2518851	2518850	kjang	6/20/07 4:06 AM	1.18231236E12	forgot	one last little detail is it doesn't go below or above 50 percent for one program it literally locks out at 50 percent and it only happens on games so far so it's not like it happens when i run itunes or something thnx
