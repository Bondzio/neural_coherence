Technically speaking, does this mean that my Router 2 (N600) will have to be configured as an access point? Just a few clarifications. Router 1 will be on the ground floor Router 2 will be on the upper floor There is only one internet connection which is coming into router 1. This has to be shared with router 2 so that people on the upper floor can also use the internet via Router 2. Internet on Router 2 Also required for Media Reciever to play YouTube, etc. Router 2 will also be used to connect a network hard drive which I Intend to use to store my media files (music movies), and use for viewing content stored on it via a media reciever.

Hope that helps. Mark
