<s> I have a 10 gig hd not in the computer, which i would like to get the music off of and clear everything else off of it and put it into a new built computer sometime later. </s>
<s> Is there a cable I can purchase to connect the hard drive to a usb port to download the music files into another hard drive, and wipe the hard drive clean for use in another machine. </s>
<s> thanks for any help. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Buy an USB 'hard disc enclosure' to put your hard disk in. </s>
<s> That's the &quot;cable&quot; you mention. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Mount this disk as a slave in any other computer. </s>
<s> No need to buy anything. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
