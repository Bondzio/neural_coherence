<s> I am a digital photographer with a dye based modified Epson 1280 loaded with expensive quad tone ink. </s>
<s> I also have a new Epson Stylus R1800 for color photo printing. </s>
<s> I hate to print text in business letters, web pages, web receits with these. </s>
<s> I want a low maintenance printer that I can use only ocassionally that won't clog up to print text with. </s>
<s> I want the text quality to be excellent. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> I agree with Bob. </s>
<s> Overall cost per page is less, you do not need worry about nozzle clogging during periods of non-use, and for black on white, there are several for under $200. </s>
<s> If you do want color for printing web pages, I think the Konica-Minolta for under $400 is a good buy. </s>
<s> I myself use HP and Brother lasers, but I have friends who use Samsung with good results. </s>
