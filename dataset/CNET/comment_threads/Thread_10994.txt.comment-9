that &quot;I'm Canadian, and proud!&quot;...but that would be a fib, John!
However, as far as I know, that is how they count letters up here (at least at the federal level).
It's also the way they count letters in several state and federal departments.
(I thought &quot;civics&quot; was a required subject when you went to school...) I don't believe there are any hard and fast rules as to how many &quot;points&quot; each letter counts for (10,000 seems to be a &quot;standard&quot; number)...but they do count for a lot more than one letter.
And, as I've said, it depends on the department and/or organization.
Personally, I believe there are certain segments of government that wouldn't care how many letters we wrote.
(You weren't by any chance a postman...were you, John?)
