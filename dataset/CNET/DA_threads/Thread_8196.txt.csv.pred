1.1.1	I have a toshiba 51H84C HDTV-CRT , and I was going to hook up my computer to it through DVI converted to HDMI , but then I saw in the manual : Note : This TV should not be used with a PC .	St
1.1.2	Is there any reason why it would state this ?	Ques
1.1.3	Also , could someone explain to me the whole DVI-D and DVI-I thing and which ones would work on a TV ?	Sug
1.1.4	and another thing , I am using an DVD Player through Component ( Y , Pb , Pr ) and even though I select widescreen for all the settings , it still comes out as 4:3 with those bar things on the top and bottom , is it becuase Component is a analog signal ?	Ques
1.1.5	Also , one more thing ... My TV only came with one HDMI port , would this be a problem in the future ?	Ques
1.1.6	Because I plan to get HD Cable and a HD DVD Player , which would require 2 ports , what would I be able to do about this ?	Ques
1.2.1	There was a discussion about this subject but I can seem to located that thread though .	St
1.2.2	If my recollection is correct ... you could connect a computer to the tv , except the tv has to on first before the turning on the computer , otherwise the HDMI will not recognize the DVI connection .	St
1.2.3	On the subject of DVI ; DVI-I will support both digital and analog signals and DVD-D will only support digital .	St
1.2.4	On the 4:3 thing ; are you sure the material you are viewing is wide screen ?	Ques
1.2.5	Other than that , I do n't know what to say ( tv and dvd got so dawn many adjustments ) .	St
1.2.6	One HDMI port ; Do n't know too much about them but I think that may be normal .	St
1.2.7	The whole idea about HDMI is its universal connection..like usb on computer .	St
1.2.8	Hope this help a little .	St
1.2.9	My brain is all tapped out , hehe .	St
1.3.1	My DVD 's are widescreen , dunno why it comes out like that .	St
1.3.2	And ...	St
1.3.3	I 've heard some people with issues about DVI-I and DVI-D Compatability with HDMI , has anyone heard about this before ?	Ques
1.4.1	how do i tell if my DVI port is DVI-I or DVI-D ?	Ques
1.5.1	You ca n't tell the difference by looking at the connector , so I guess your best bet would be to consult the manual .	St
1.5.2	It appears that dvi comes in two favor ( single link and dual link ) .	St
1.5.3	Single link is 18 pins and dual link is 24 pins .	St
1.5.4	The dual link is the one that gives you the best graphic .	St
1.5.5	If you are connecting the video card to a dvi port and not to a vga connection then it does n't matter what you have .	St
1.5.6	That 's the best I can do..good searching !	St
