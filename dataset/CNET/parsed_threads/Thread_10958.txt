<s> This is probably a silly question, but, is there a significant difference between a multimedia desktop and a gaming desktop? </s>
<s> That is, if I buy a gaming comp., will it be unsuitable for watching DVDs and TV? </s>
<s> Likewise, if I buy a multimedia comp., will the graphics card, etc., likely be insufficient to play current and next gen. games? </s>
<s> My problem is that I want to buy a computer (perhaps a desktop) for college, one that can handle next-gen gaming, play DVDs, and be used to watch TV. </s>
<s> My confusion regarding gaming versus multimedia has made it difficult for me to properly research. </s>
<s> Please excuse my novice understanding of computer lingo, any help is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Gaming usually means you need a 3D card which is not required for Media such as Tv, DVD and photos. </s>
<s> So one could use a gaming PC and be sure it has the chops for DVD and TV. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> gaming computers generaly have better video cards and multimedia computer usaly have things like TV tuners and remote controls. </s>
<s> that dosnet mean multimedia computers cant have great video cards or gaming computers cant have tv tuners this is just how it is usaly clasifed. </s>
<s> Gaming computers and multimedia computers are both computers at the core. </s>
<s> It's just that multimedia computers are usually outfitted with a remote control or a tv-tuner. </s>
<s> If you want a beast of a machine that can do it all, get a gaming machine and then drop in a tv-tuner. </s>
<s> Then you can watch cable tv or any other input that the tuner will alow. </s>
<s> REMEMBER: it doesn't matter which type you get because you can always upgrade the system to suite your needs (ei. </s>
<s> upgrade a multimedia pc with a better video card so it runs games at higher resolutions) that's about all you need to know Dre </s>
<s> Gaming is better than multimedia, and can of course handle multimedia (better than multimedia pc's can). </s>
<s> Which way you decide to go, I would recommend you have at least 1GH Memory as a minimum. </s>
<s> 2HG will give you plenty to run major programs as well as handle all the programs that run in the background. </s>
<s> Any system will work for both .......... well. </s>
<s> let me clarify that: Stay away from base model budget systems. </s>
<s> You will need a CPU that can handle heavy multitask responsibilities. </s>
<s> High-end P4s or AMDs will cover that. </s>
<s> I'm not that well-practiced with the new dual-cores. </s>
<s> I can tell you that a zapper P4 is tough to beat. </s>
<s> My nephew has an AMD in his system that rocks. </s>
<s> Those are both good choices. </s>
<s> 2 Gigs should be standard these days. </s>
<s> Go ahead and buy 2 Gigs. </s>
<s> You will not regret that. </s>
<s> Get a base model graphix card and upgrade that after you buy the PC. </s>
<s> Most graphix card manufacturers have system scans available online. </s>
<s> As far as gamimg goes, no game works exactly the same on any system. </s>
<s> Keep that in mind when someone tells you that you bought the wrong graphix card. </s>
<s> What's good for the goose isn't always good for the gander. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> For next gen games the graphics card is far far more important than the processor. </s>
<s> Any processor 3ghz and up (or AMD equivalent) should be fine but have plenty of ram and a good draphics card. </s>
<s> i.e atleast 256MB PCI express nvidia 7600 or ati x800. </s>
<s> These cards are really not that expensive nowardays and should cope but a 7800/7900 or an ATI x1800 would be a better longer lasting choice. </s>
<s> He sounded like he was strapped - so I suggested a starting point. </s>
<s> And, by the way, I did tell him to get some heavy RAM. </s>
<s> the only concern. </s>
<s> Like others have said/will say, gaming is the biggest concern you will have. </s>
<s> Gaming and maybe, MAYBE video editing, is the things that are the most demanding on a computer. </s>
<s> As long as your computer has a good graphics card, a good amount of RAM and a TV tuner card, you should be ok. </s>
<s> First off, thank you to everyone who responded. </s>
<s> I feel MUCH better informed now. </s>
<s> As I understand it, I am better off buying a gaming desktop, and then adding a TV tuner, etc. </s>
<s> Do any of you have a recommendation for me? </s>
<s> I'd like to stay at or under $2,000. </s>
<s> If something earth-shattering goes for $2,500, that's fine. </s>
<s> But please, no recs for $3,000 and up desktops, that's just too much for me. </s>
<s> Thank you again, you guys are the best! </s>
<s> Ok i worded what i meant wrong. </s>
<s> In my opinion he can save a bit of money on getting a slightly lesser processor and spend that on his graphics card. </s>
<s> With processors a change as small as 200mghz can vary price by like $100 which is not really worth it. </s>
<s> For that you can get a very very nice pc. </s>
<s> I would think more in the range of 1500 could get you something pretty decent. </s>
<s> Checkout dell because although i dont like them they tend to be pretty reasonable. </s>
