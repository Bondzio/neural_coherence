When you installed the hard drive mechanism in the drive case, you would have seen the electronics on one side of the drive.
One item you did not see was the motor that drives the spindle that spins the platters (at 7200 rpm) that hold the data.
Also not visible to you are the armature mechanisms that hold the drive heads that move across the platters that read and write the data.
If the external circuit board blew out, that might be easy for a drive repair/data recovery company to fix.
Chances are pretty good that in addition to blowing out that circuit board, the spindle motor and the armature mechanisms were impacted by the surge in AC power.
There is a slight chance that the heads (being held by the armatures) went bananas and could have scruffed the platter surfaces.
If only external stuff was impacted, that is one thing - but if anything internal was impacted, the only way to get to the data is to actually open the drive - in a special &quot;clean room&quot; and with special tools read the platters sector by sector and recover whatever may be recoverable.
I presume you had no data back ups... Bummer.
Good luck.
