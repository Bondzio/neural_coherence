1.2.1	There were several video drivers listed under & quot ; winbond & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	You did n't give your model number or any other identifiers so hard to say if yours is there ... Also I did find downloads on the Winbond site ( once I switched it to english . )	St
1.2.3	but it was not clear to me of these were what you were looking for ... Hope this helps -- good hunting .	St
1.3.1	sounds like you need the via hyperon 4n1 driver for the mother board then the video driver , http : //www.viaarena.com/default.aspx ? PageID=2 & Type=1	St
