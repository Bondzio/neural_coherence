i have an smc 70004awbr router with built in print server.
works fine with that but i've looked to replace it and all the print servers i've looked at, both wired and wireless, explictly say they don't support it.
do you really need a wireless print server?
right now i have the old router plugged into the new one just so i can use it as a print server.
the best i've seen is to replace the printer with a brother hl-2070n which i've seen on sale after rebates for $125 or so and it has built in eithernet.
