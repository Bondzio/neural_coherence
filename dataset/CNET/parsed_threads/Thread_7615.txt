<s> recently we have purchased a machine with ht processor 3.0ghz, 865 series m/b, it only shows HT when hyper threading is enabled in the BIOS,and i seen a proceesor chip that shows no HT symbol, but fsb is 800mhz, and i also use a third party s/ws , but i am not satisfied, any body can give solutions clearly please note: there is no HT symbol in processor sticker </s>
<s> Accesss Device Manager by typing devmgmt.msc in the RUN box, then hit enter. </s>
<s> To the left of &quot;Processors&quot; should be a + sign. </s>
<s> If you see 2 procs listed, you have a HT CPU. </s>
<s> Another way is opening up Task Manager. </s>
<s> If you see 2 graphs in Performance Tab, you have HT. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
