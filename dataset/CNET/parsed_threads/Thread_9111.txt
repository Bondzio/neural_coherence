<s> After three monthsof using the new version of Yahoo email I experience freezing several times a day. </s>
<s> This version to me is still not BUG-FREE! </s>
<s> I am back using Yahoo Classic with no freezing. </s>
<s> The last version of Classic had more features than the one I am using now. </s>
<s> Could you please assist me in getting back the last version of Classic before the new version of Yahoo email became available. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> If I could transfer all my stored emails I would transfer them to Google Gmail. </s>
<s> Any comments please. </s>
<s> I think this is web mail which is, well, what it is. </s>

<s> Thanks Robert, however, could you elaborate a little more on your statement, &quot;I think this is Webmail which is, well, what it is&quot;. </s>

<s> What does this mean and how do I go about getting other email providers that are not Web based. </s>

<s> Thanks &quot;You could elect to not use web based email and go get some app?&quot; </s>
<s> Now that you know what web email is, you can look at email apps and see if you want those. </s>
<s> Many pick up Thunderbird and you can use your Yahoo email account. </s>
<s> At least according to; http://kb.mozillazine.org/Creating_accounts_in_Thunderbird_for_popular_email_providers However, if you are asking what web email is now, I fear you will be put off by having to learn about SMTP, IMAP and more. </s>
