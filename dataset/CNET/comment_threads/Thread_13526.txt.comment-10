I am enjoying my new pc, it's so fast!
I did call Best Buy because I didn't see a Windows XP with my new pc, and they told me I could create a Recovery cd like you said, or buy one from HP.
I am still planning on putting the CPU in my old Presario as soon as my brother in law pays for the one he fried.
I'll keep in touch.
Thanks
