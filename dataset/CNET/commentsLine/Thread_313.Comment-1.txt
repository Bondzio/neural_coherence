dell xps 600 intel plentium d 930 processor hard drive wd 250 gb windows xp home sp2 i want to buy and install a second hard drive for linux operation system.
a search of western digital show the following small drive available.
wd400jd 40gb serial 150 ata wd800jd 80gb 3.0gb my current hard drive is the 3.0gb same as the 80gb.
what is the performance of the 3.0gb as compared to the sata 150. dollar wise the 80gb is a couple of dollars more and the extra storage is worth that much.
i just don't understand what the 3.0gb is telling me.
once installed will i be able to format to fats32 using xp disk management.
i've been using me for a number of years and always formatted with fdisk so this will be new to me.
thanks for all the help in advanced.
