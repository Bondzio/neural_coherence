the cheapest up front costs on an everyday basis are generally the store brands of paper and cartridges.
staples, officemax, etc., have their own.
sometimes there are special sales on name brand items.
i prefer to wait and stock up then.
now, a lower cartridge cost does not guarantee that you will get as many usable pages of print.
