I voted somewhat important.
I don't play games or edit video so I don't need the fastest thing out there.
I like to watch movies on my PC so I need something a little faster than the cheapest.
And I don't like the video using my RAM either.
So I spend about $50.00 and for the most part I have been happy with what I get.
