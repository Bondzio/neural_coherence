first of all, &quot;quality&quot; matters, cheap is cheap.
get a namebrand psu of at least 400w+ or better.
if you buy a generic brand then get the highest wattage you can find to produce the most stable psu from any poor quality or just cheap make-up.
namebrand psus tend to be stable for even less wattage than generic ones.
having a high wattage psu will have its power demands available for the &quot;needed on demand&quot; usage as any excess will be available as required.
read the specs as any psu should detail themselves via thier decal/sticker.
understand, wattage output of the rated wattage is avilable but not for constant output, its only for &quot;peak&quot; usage and can't be sustained for extended periods will surely test the &quot;quality&quot; of any psu, thus more rated wattage is a plus.
find the rated wattage, and expect at least 75% be available on a constant stable output.
last, remember all devices are attached to the power output should a psu fail, the strong possibility exists that it may take with it any/all weak devices to include the mtrbd.
so keep that in mind.
