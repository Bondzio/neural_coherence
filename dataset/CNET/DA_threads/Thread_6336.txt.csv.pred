1.1.1	Hi, I am trying to buy new RAM for my gateway desktop and there is a really good deal on for some DDR3 1600MHz RAM.	St
1.1.2	The memory adviser results on the crucial website say that my computer can hold 16GB of 1333MHz DDR3 ( http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=FX6831-01&amp;Cat=RAM ).	St
1.1.3	But does that mean that my computer can't handle 1600MHz RAM?	St
1.1.4	And would there be a performance difference if i was to have 1600MHz instead of the 1333MHz?	St
1.1.5	Also, does it matter if the RAM is DRAM or SDRAM?	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	If you already have 8GBs of DDR3-1333MHz and you add 8GBs of DDR3-1600MHz, the 16GBs RAM would all run at 1333MHz.	St
1.2.2	Bottomline, it may or may not run at all with the higher speed RAM.	St
1.2.3	Do you actually know what RAM is in it now ?	Ques
1.2.4	(NOTE...it may be equal to or greater than what the mfg advertises.)	St

1.3.1	The RAM thats in my computer now is 4x2GB 1333MHz DDR3.	St
1.3.2	And I'm wanting to remove it all and replace it with 4x4GB of 1600MHz DDR3.	St
1.3.3	So you're saying that the 1600MHz RAM might or might not work?	St
1.3.4	I'm guessing there's no way to tell for sure.	St
1.4.1	The make, model of the PC but I see the mix and match question is answered.	St
1.4.2	Crucial almost always gets you the right RAM.	St
1.4.3	But as to the speed that's an interesting issue.	St
1.4.4	No company wants to produce slower ram so this is why you use higher speed ram.	St
1.4.5	It will work at the lower speed happily.	St
1.4.6	But you do have owners that want to know more.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	work, that it will work at the higher speed.	St
1.5.2	Off-the-shelf PCs from the BIG BOX MFGs just don't usually incorporate features to support higher speed RAM.	St
1.5.3	My recommendation...leave it as is and you really want/need more RAM then just add the additional recommended RAM Questions ?	Ques
1.5.4	We'll be here.	St
1.5.5	VAPCMD	St
