1. ask dell.
2. i just fixed one esata.
it was simple.
the owner thought it was powered by the esata connection.
changed the case to a powered unit and it spun up and worked.
3. esata may or may not work on all machines.
be sure that the drive spins.
if not, call the drive maker.
if it spins, the next call is dell.
