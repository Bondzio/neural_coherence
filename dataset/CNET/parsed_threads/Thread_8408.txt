<s> Hi, I recently needed to check what graphics card I have to see if I needed to upgrade. </s>
<s> But, I forgot which one I bought with the computer. </s>
<s> Does anybody know how to check which graphics card you have? </s>
<s> -thank you for your time </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You can just go to Display -&gt; Settings, and it should list the model there. </s>
<s> Start &gt; Ctrl Panel &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Adapter if you just goto Settings it sometimes does not list the actual adapter, especially if it's not using it's own drivers also, if you need an upgrade suggestion please list what your possibly needing to upgrade for... but w/o even looking at it, i'd suggest the GeForce 6600 AGP (not the GT) </s>
<s> Download either Belarc advisor or Aida, run them from a floppy and find out everything about your computer. </s>
<s> Print it out as a memory aid. </s>
