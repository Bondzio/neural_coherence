Vista 64 bits can use more, but you should be sure that the games you want to play (and the drivers for the hardware) are Vista 64 compatible. Moreover, http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2328804,00.asp shows that the current generation of games is quite happy with 2Gb. So 4Gb should be more than sufficient seen from that point of view also. As yet, I think it's unlikely mass consumer games will need Vista 64 bit in the near future. Kees

The other thing is the RAM...not sure I'd be anxious to buy RAM where there are no buyer reviews indicating compatability, failure/DOA info, etc. Is that RAM indicated on the MB mfg's QVL ? VAPCMD

Also, going to MSI's website I was not able to find the mobo in the memory compatibility section and also the ones I did find were 1666, when AMD can only go to 1066. If there is a way I can get a nice Intel processor that can last me awhile with a DDR3 rdy mobo I'd be all ears and thanks for the input so far.
9606	5	306854	2847383	2847345	bearcatext	9/1/08 12:27 PM	1.22027202E12	Another question	Also, I am not really sure how to overclock since im new to the whole building business. What would you suggest and I have heard a lot of people saying that its smart to heatsink the northbridge since it runs almost as hot as the CPU, would this be something to look into and for the CPU or should the fans in my case be ample? Again thanks for the output I am making the correct changes, and will prolly go to the E6666
9606	6	306854	2847444	2847383	ramarc	9/1/08 2:11 PM	1.22027826E12	half the cost?	using the prices from your own post, you can see that a q6600 is only $25 more. the phenom is slightly faster but as i said, OC'ing a q6600 to 3ghz (with the mobo i suggested) is as simple as changing a couple of jumpers to select 1333mhz fsb. no cpu voltage or memory tweaking is necessary. you can even use the stock cooler (but something along the lines of a artic freezer pro 7 or coolermaster hyper tx2 would be a good $30 upgrade). http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103031 i too prefer upgrading cooling on gaming PC chipsets. the msi p45 platinum has heatpipe cooling for the northbridge and cpu mosfets. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130179 note that i suggested msi since a) i own their board, and b) you spec'd msi in your original post. for budget conscious customers, i suggest biostar's tforce line. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138118 if you're worried about overclocking, going with a more reasonable power supply lets you get a q9400 or q9550 and stay within your budget. but OCing a q6600 would give almost enough budget room for dual hd4870 cards.
9606	7	306854	2847448	2847345	ramarc	9/1/08 2:23 PM	1.22027898E12	ddr3 is still double the price	don't get a board that has both ddr2 and ddr3 since they rarely perform as well as a pure ddr3 board and they have half the memory capacity with ddr3 (usually 4gb vs. 8gb). so if you plan to upgrade from ddr2 to ddr3 a year down the road, you'd wind up throwing away your ddr2 ram and not being able to expand the capacity. i had no problems with gigabyte's p45 ddr3 board for $175: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128348 paired with 2x2gb of mushkin's 4gb ddr3-1600 for $260: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146828 but you'll only notice the performance difference in benchmarks or if you have long running cpu/memory intensive tasks (like video encoding). and the ram is twice as expensive as ddr2-1066 so you could afford 6/8gb of ddr2-1066.

Also, the Video card I selected would they be alright to crossfire and still preform very nicely or is there a video card out there for the price of both of them that out preforms them?

9606	11	306854	2847533	2847485	ramarc	9/1/08 4:47 PM	1.22028762E12	almost any 4gb ddr2-1066 kit would be fine	so long as you're willing to set the timings yourself and use two 2gb dimms. msi boards are tweaker friendly and can be configured to handle up to ddr2-1200. i prefer the ocz reaper: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227289 but the patriot viper is fine also. just remember to do the initial boot with 1 stick (it'll run at ddr2-800). then manually set the specified timings and reboot. if everything's fine, add the other stick and reboot.

After tweaking the things you mentioned I have the following different: Processor - Q6600 (I dont know how to O.C. if its something easy to do im all for it) Mobo - P45 Platinum by MSI Memory - OCZ Reaper PSU - Antec 850W HDD - Western Digital 640Gb That hits me right at 1500 with the mail in rebates, sound good to you, and I will probably have questions on the tweaking and O.C. for the system since this the first time I am doing anything of this sort. So any more help would be greatly apprectiated and thanks for all the advice you have already given me.

Motherboard only uses DDR2 800/1066 memory, 1066 is required for one of processors. See specifications. Graphics card requires DirectX 10 this means the OS must be Vista. Unless your running two graphics cards that power supply is over kill. Somewhere around 550-600 watts should do for one card. If you go with two graphics cards heat will be a problem. How about your CPU cooler? Nice first attempt. More home work required. It's all in the specifications. Do some searches on those items directly from there manufactures web pages. Newegg does a pretty good job with specifications but they sometimes miss some important information. I think you could get more for your money. I'd suggest you keep shopping. This thread untracked.

You should get a bigger hard drive than the 320GB one you have. You can try replacing that with at least a 500GB or more hard drive(preferable with 10,000 rpm). You did not mention what OS you have. If it is a 32-bit OS, then you won't be taking full advantage of all of those 4 gigs of RAM that you have. If you really want to improve on your system, you can get two 500GB hard drives to replace the 320GB drive, and then set up the two drives to work together in a RAID 0 array for faster access time.
9606	19	306854	2851567	2850714	GENE8	9/6/08 6:17 PM	1.22072502E12	Agree and disagree	I agree with you that the RAM is too slow.But his motherboard may not be able to handle latency as low as 2. A latency of 3 or 4 might be better for him. I don't think that 1066 memory is necessarily required for the processor he's using. I think he can get by with 800 memory. Just because he is using a Directx10 card does'nt mean he has to use Vista. A Directx10 card will work with any OS, the programs will just not operate on the x10 level. And I disagree that the power supply he's using is overkill. With any system today, the bigger the power supply, the better. If he decides to install better video cards in the future, he will always have a power supply that can handle the upgrade. And keeping the CPU cool really has nothing to do with the video cards, unless the CPU has been overclocked.

I assume that you are staying with the same HDD that you selected earlier. Your system looks good, but if you have more money in the near future and want to improve your system, you can: add another video card to get SLI and add a 64-bit OS to put all the 4 gigs of RAM to work.If you plan to overclock the CPU, don't do it until you have first updated your motherboard to the latest BIOS and have tested the system for stability.You did not mention what monitor you will be getting. For a system like this, I would suggest a 24-inch LCD, with 5 ms or less response time, DVI W/HDCP and HDMI inputs. Don't use anything less than a DVI cable for hook up to the PC if you want the best picture quality.
