at the time i was looking for a desktop that would give me the option of adding periphials such as hard drives.
i had 2 from previous pc's, and wanted to keep them and utilize them as backup and etc...plus, the fact that they were in excellent shape.
i tried the brand names first, but most of them did not give u the option of adding other hard drives...don't forget this was before usb external hd's.
now, i have 3 hd's,plus a dvd in my desktop and still going strong.
