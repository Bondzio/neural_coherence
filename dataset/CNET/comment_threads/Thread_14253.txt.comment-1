Hi Friends, Building a 1U Linux Server is different from building a normal tower case because 1U is equal to 1.75 inches in height and I realized that it will be working within a smaller space than with other computer cases.
To this end, power supplies, fans, video cards, network cards, hard drives and CD-ROM drives all have been made with a lower height requirement.
So, I want to learn the process to build a 1U Linux Server.
If anyone having idea on it, then please share with me and help me for my mission.
Thanks and Regards, Rodger Hooks
