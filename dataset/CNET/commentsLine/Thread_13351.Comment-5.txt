ok, sorry for no restore points.
anyways, besides an actual audio card, there are audio section build on mtrbds.
i suggest you get the system checker:  find everest system checker pgm.
and d/l it.
it will check your system for all devices.
yes, the audio portion will be seen as pci type.
if present.
a quick physical check of the audio ports found on the system case, look for 3-4 small rca plug-ins, maybe labeled as spkr, input, output and/or mic, etc.
