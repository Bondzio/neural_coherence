hello i'm going to build my own gamer pc for the first time.
i have a list of the hardware i'm going to buy.
- graphics card: geforce gtx 580 - cpu: core i7-950 - motherboard: asus rampage extreme iii republic of gamers - ram: 2 x 6 gb kingston hyperx - hard drive: hitachi deskstar 7k2000 - blue-ray: bh10ls30 super multi blue - power supply: corsair tx650w it would be nice if you could make some comments about what you thought about it and may also make some suggestions on what else i can buy but it should not be much more expensive than what i've already selected.
thanks in advance
