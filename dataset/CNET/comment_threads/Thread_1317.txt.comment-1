I installed an Hitachi 500 GB SATA drive, but I can't get Vista to find it.
Well, when I go into Control Panel, System, Hardware, Drives, I can find it.
But I can't find it in Windows Explorer.
It looks like this Vaio already has 2 hard drives, but they must be in a RAID setup.
What do I need to do to get this new drive recognized?
I recently upgraded from XP Pro to Vista Home Premium.
