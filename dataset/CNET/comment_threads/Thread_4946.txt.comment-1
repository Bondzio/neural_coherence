Booted up my mom's comp and it said that one of the drives had bad sectors and recommended that I run scan disk.
After scandisk, it said that physical damage had occurred to the drive and that I should back up the files.
My mom has extremely important things on that drive so I transferred them to the secondary hard drive in my comp (no it isn't partitioned it really is a seperate drive).
Now I'm just looking for a course of action.
Is scandisk just giving me a bogus analysis?
Any suggested course of action would be appreciated.
