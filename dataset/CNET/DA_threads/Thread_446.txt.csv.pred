1.1.1	Hey all , I have a question ( obviously ) .	St
1.1.2	Ok , I 'm planning on buying a new computer to set up as my main base station ( yes , I use all the technical words ) , and placing my older computer in my room .	St
1.1.3	It 's a custom built job , so if you need any specifications just let me know .	St
1.1.4	But the problem is , that it is quite loud , and also the fan on the side has a nice flashing blue light .	St
1.1.5	I 'd like to be able to keep it on while I sleep , so I 'd like it to be a lot less noisy .	St
1.1.6	Would buying a new tower shell solve this problem ?	Ques
1.1.7	And are there certain towers known as more quiet as others ?	Ques
1.1.8	Or could this have nothing to do with the tower , and if so , what could the cause of the noise be ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
