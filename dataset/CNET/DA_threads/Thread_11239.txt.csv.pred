1.1.1	I applied some thermal paste from radioshack on my cpu a week ago but then today I was switching the motherboard and I wanted to know cant I just take the heat sink off and just put it back on the new motherboard without reapplying it?	St
1.1.2	I lost my thermal paste and I need to put my cpu in the new motherboard and I wanted to just move it without cleaning and reapplying.	St
1.1.3	Im not switching cpus, Im just moving it.	St
1.2.1	There will be gaps.	St
1.2.2	Spring for a new tube.	St
1.3.1	If the paste is sufficiently present, sure you can reuse it.	St
1.3.2	That's the true paste, NOT a heat pad which normally is shipped with new cpus.	St
1.3.3	To play it safe, get another tube of paste, which would you rather do, replace paste or burnt-out cpu?	St
