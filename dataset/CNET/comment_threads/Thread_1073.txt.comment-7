Its a shame that there's a bunch of s/w loaded when you install a new printer, but that's the way it is.
Understand, that all such s/w can provide function for tasks you *may* want of the m/f printer as times goes on.
You of course can(if applicable) de-install or reduce some functions.
Those functions are to email any pictures, fax s/w, OCR s/w for scanning, and s/w for cropping & manupitation before printing, plus monitor s/w for ink levels and not to forget the drivers of the OS being used.
There should also some management of any pictures and/or copied documents, etc.. Hope this helps in your quest.
May i suggest you look into the new Kodak 5xxx series of printers which offer reduced costs of ink, plus offer more permanent inks than usually provided from other vendors.
