<s> i've tried searching about the topic in google.com but im confused. </s>
<s> different topics are coming out from the search. </s>
<s> most of the times, articles about the Networking Standard Organization are the ones being displayed as the result of the search. </s>

<s> This may be the purpose of your class and assignment. </s>
<s> To jump in and start reading and eventually piece together the puzzle. </s>
<s> Since you didn't ask for anything specific I can't answer. </s>

<s> All i want to ask is: if you know any standards commonly used for networking. </s>
<s> like the ISO/OSI Referrence Model. </s>
<s> if you know any other networking standards, can you please share them to me, thanks. </s>
<s> The nice thing about standards is that the ones you noted are documented widely and fine books at the better book stores. </s>
<s> However there are those that think if they can ask the right person it all could be explained in two paragraphs. </s>
<s> Sorry, this may never happen. </s>
<s> Just look at what results you get at google and the wikipedia. </s>
<s> So far you haven't asked for something that isn't out there on the web or in a fine book. </s>
<s> It's all there for you to keep reading till it makes sense. </s>
