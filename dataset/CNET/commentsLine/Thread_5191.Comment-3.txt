the most that it changes is from excellent to very good.
i've seen the &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; before on another computer, but i'm not getting that.
it has also said wireless connection unavailable, but only for a few seconds and then it went back.
i cannot get ipconfig to work.
i must be doing it wrong, i'm hitting start&gt;run&gt; then typing ipconfig.
i think that i may have the wrong ethernet driver.
i am 100% certain that the cable i have hooked up to it is working (it was before.)
there are so many network drivers on the support page for this laptop that i don't know what is right.
maybe if someone could look at that for me and make suggestions as far as the driver.
i should at least be getting a wired signal.
