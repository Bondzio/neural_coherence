1.1.1	I have a Verizon Westell ADSL2 + Router Model A90-7500-07 combination.	St
1.1.2	It has been replaced by Verizon 4 times and yes it works ok when wired.	St
1.1.3	If I try to connect with my Iphone, Ipad or Book reader 1 in 10 times it connects, or randomly.	St
1.1.4	I have changed settings and channels.	St
1.1.5	I have turned off all security and it still doesn't connect.	St
1.1.6	My question is there a modem/router that I can buy myself, say at staples that works well.	St
1.1.7	Verizon tells me that none will work (will not connect to their DSL) I can't imagine that being true.	St
1.1.8	Can anyone help me?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Looked at the manual for this device and it is very complex...and I am too lazy to read the whole thing.	St
1.2.2	I would suspect you CAN run another DSL router but the DSL is not your issue it is the wireless so I would keep the DSL part since it works well on wired.	St
1.2.3	So a couple suggestions you will have to dig though the manual to figure out how to do it.	St
1.2.4	Run the westell device as a bridge and place a second wireless router behind it.	St
1.2.5	Your second router will use ethernet and not DSL for its WAN.	St
1.2.6	You in effect use the westell box as only a modem to convert the DSL to etherent.	St
1.2.7	Use a second router as a WAP.	St
1.2.8	You can disable the wireless signal on the westel and user it to do the DSL and the routing function.	St
1.2.9	Your second router would only do the wireless part.	St
1.3.1	I will try this out I have another wireless router that I'll bridge in.	St
