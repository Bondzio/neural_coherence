<s> Hi everyone, I just ordered a new PC, here are the specs: HP Pavilion p7xt customizable Desktop PC Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium [64-bit] OS Intel Core i3-2120 processor [3.3GHz, 3MB cache] 6GB DDR3-1333MHz SDRAM 1TB 7200 rpm SATA hard drive Integrated graphics - Intel HD 2000 SuperMulti DVD Burner Wireless-N LAN card (1x1) I'm going to buy and install a graphics card separately, maybe something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131338 Will I need a bigger power supply? </s>
<s> When I bought my first PC I had an OEM Nvidea card installed, so I'm not too familiar with putting these together myself, and I don't want to burn out the PC. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If any of you can recommend a good one for these specs, I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> I am NOT a gamer, would like to minimize the power required, etc. </s>
<s> Just want good graphics for watching videos, low-tech games, also free up RAM, etc. </s>
<s> Rarely needs the PC power supply upgraded. </s>
<s> So few times that I'm going with no. </s>
<s> How will you know if you need an upgrade? </s>
<s> Can you run tests? </s>
<s> I don't know exactly but I think my PC will be 300 Watts, I also looked at some of the $40 cards like: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125392 </s>
<s> The new video card you get even with basic options, will demand a certain amount of wattage to best handle it. </s>
<s> Whatever video card you may decide on, visit that video card support or maker's website and locate the requirements for power. </s>
<s> That alone is a good measure of the needs from any new PSU. </s>
<s> Not only to meet the needs but also to have breathing room for anything else, so don't fall for the minium needs alone, get well above and decent brand PSU as well. </s>
<s> You can use the website: http://www.tomshardware.com and check video card reviews for your match of video needs. </s>
<s> Alas, the more demanding the video card, the more cooling required as well, since anything HP provides will be lacking sooner or later. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> But after testing a few too many 5450's I will not test any more with those. </s>
<s> Any reason to try the 210? </s>
<s> Sorry, none here! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> A buddy of mine has a high-end Dell desktop, about 3-4 years old. </s>
<s> His factory video card failed, and I replaced it with an off-the-shelf, low-end (ie. </s>
<s> non-gamer) video card from Best Buy. </s>
<s> Installed it, and the machine wouldn't power-up (ie. </s>
<s> power supply loaded down). </s>
<s> Had to make a second trip back to Best Buy to buy a beefier power supply. </s>
<s> I feel like I should have just paid $50-70 for the OEM video card instead of $30-40 that may or may not work and need more power. </s>
<s> If I have to buy more power I will lose considerable money, no? </s>
<s> So well known for not having to replace the PSU that why are you changing? </s>
<s> I already ordered the PC, the guy said the build date is next week but I can't change the specs (although I doubt they would decline if I told them I wanted to pay MORE and get a card). </s>
<s> All that said, it's my first time buying a video card like this, anytime you do something first time you are taking a financial risk and it would be horrible to lose money on the whole thing. </s>
<s> What do you think about this NVIDEA card? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125392 </s>
<s> We continue with the 5450 because it continues to be one that we can pop in and not worry about the PSU. </s>
<s> This Nvidia card looks to be low power but any reason to pick it over the other? </s>
<s> Seems odd. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Newegg reviews ... Nvidea card got all good reviews, the 5450 had several reviews that said it was DOA Other people recommended &quot;make sure you get Nvidea&quot; I had Nvidea on my last comp The Nvidea card I showed has a fan (but I'm not sure how that affects PSU) ------ All that said, I could still get the 5450 if it's safe and reliable for my situation, but those are the things to take into consideration. </s>
<s> So take everything I say with a grain of salt When it comes down to the specs and what the cards actually do, I'm clueless! </s>
<s> Both cards should be fine. </s>
<s> The only reason I nod to the 5450 is we used a lot of them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The biggest concern I had were the Newegg reviews about 5450 arriving DOA, then those purchasers had to pay for re-shipping and everything, wiping out most or all of cost savings. </s>
<s> I tend to use Amazon Prime. </s>
<s> The NVIDEA 210 card I'm looking at, they said it will be fine on 300W PSU. </s>
<s> It also has a fan, so that should keep everything cool. </s>
<s> Bob, the 5450 you recommend I think is fine too after looking into it more, however the PowerColor brand might not be up to par with EVGA, ASUS, Gigabyte? </s>
<s> so to get a more reliable 5450 would be $36/37 and I would rather pay the extra 2 or 3 bucks for the fan. </s>
<s> What do you think about this solution? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> It will be fine. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> After replacing thousands of fans over the years, I like fanless boards. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Some online article I just read says that if you get a dedicated card, Intel's QuickSync will not run unless the integrated GPU is used, and one has to decide on the tradeoff. </s>
<s> What do you think, dedicated card still very much worth it? </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/quick-sync-video/quick-sync-video-general.html and other intel.com sites seem to note it needs an Intel CPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Technology-Primer-Sandy-Bridge-85 2nd paragraph of &quot;Detailed Features&quot; Also some techie threads on the internet: http://forum.cyberlink.com/forum/posts/list/15/17981.page Quote: When I put my first concern that I am not able to enable my Intel Quick Sync video, they provided me the information for which devices are actually eligible or compatible with this feature. </s>
<s> Below is the information they provided: 1. </s>
<s> CPU: 2nd Generation Intel&#174; Core&#8482; Processors with Intel&#174; HD Graphics 3000/2000 (Intel Sandy Bridge) http://www.intel.com/products/desktop/processors/index.htm 2. </s>
<s> Mother board: Intel&#174; H67(B3) Express Chipset 3. </s>
<s> When using Intel Quick Sync video, user can't use external/standalone graphic card (Some of the Motherboards has the function to switch between embeded Intel graphic card or external graphic card) 4. </s>
<s> Software supports Intel Quick Sync Video Technology (Like PDR, MediaEspresso) 5. </s>
<s> Windows XP itself doesn't support Hardware Decode. </s>
<s> (AMD Stream/NVDIA CUDA/Intel Quick Sync). </s>
<s> Which taps all the cores in my i7, I would not worry about this. </s>
<s> Then again, why would you disable the onboard video? </s>
<s> Most of us will leave it enabled for a second display. </s>
<s> And this neatly sidesteps what you are worried about. </s>
<s> -&gt; This is too far off topic at this point. </s>
<s> Hope the question you lead with is done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Someone was telling me that if you want to edit HD video, you will need stronger than the 210, that it's about as good as the onboard graphics. </s>
<s> Do you think that's incorrect? </s>
<s> I know it's incorrect. </s>
<s> Better CPUs and GPUs help speed up the process. </s>
<s> I can only guess there was some salesperson trying to upsell someone. </s>
<s> Seems a shame after all this time, folk still fall for it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah I told him I would be running everything in 1080p and he said the 210 is not strong enough to edit HD video in 1080p. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> It transcod video, even 1080p without displaying the images. </s>
<s> It's interesting how folk think the GPU matters for this. </s>
<s> Yes, a better GPU can help, but it's not the make/break item. </s>
<s> Going back to early video days, I would render a Video DVD on an Acer ter-600. </s>
<s> That's a Pentium 3, 256MB RAM, 11GB HDD and laughable video in 6 hours. </s>
<s> My other machine was slower and took about twice as long. </s>
<s> Does that mean the other machine could not do the work? </s>
<s> Today, it's not much different. </s>
<s> Folk can fall for the hype on this or they can use their head. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If I were &quot;falling for the hype&quot; I wouldn't be here asking questions. </s>
<s> I've never worked on computers, don't know much about tech stuff. </s>
<s> Is it 3DIMMs @2GB ? </s>
<s> 2DIMMs at 2GB and 2DIMMs @ 1GB ? </s>
<s> or 1DIMM @ 4GB and 1 DIMM @ 2GB ? </s>
<s> I ask because most systems are dual channel requiring memory in matched pairs...same mfg, same speed, same capacity, etc., </s>
<s> So I'm guessing one is 4GB the other 2GB you think that will be a problem? </s>
<s> Says: FREE UPGRADE to 6GB DDR3-1333MHz SDRAM [2 DIMMs] from 4GB </s>
<s> performance when the RAM doesn't work as &quot;dual channel&quot;. </s>
<s> The system does not operate at max performance when DIMMs at not matched...2 DIMMs @ 2GB, 2 DIMMs @ 4GB .....etc., It''s great they give you more RAM but not sure why they didn't optimize the system by adding 4GB vice 2GB...then it would have run as dual channel...128bit. </s>
<s> If you decide to upgrade or buy in the future, it's something to consider. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Is it possible they use two 3GB sticks? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Apparently Tom's Hardware did benchmark tests on dual-channel vs. single channel and found only 5% difference unless you are running really high memory applications, so hopefully it won't be too big a deal. </s>
<s> Even without dual-channel, 6GB should still be better than 4GB right? </s>
<s> DIMMs....so sorry no 3GB DIMMs. </s>
<s> Believe it could only be a 2GB DIMM and a 4GB DIMM in your case. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> should run better with 8GB in dual channel mode and where time is money ... who wants slow ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
