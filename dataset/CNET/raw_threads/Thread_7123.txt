I need black and white printer only, no fancy features required as long as it does its printing job well. I plan to refill ink from places like cartridgeworld or similar, hence I am looking for a printer that is cheap to refill as well. I will be glad if I could get some recommendations. Many thanks in advance.

The big plus if you truly do occasional printing, it'll be ready to go and the toner cart. will last as well for a very long time. Buy any cheap inkjet printer then expect cheap results over time and any refills you're at the mercy of the source of those refills, false economy. tada ----Willy
