in the last eight months, my sony vaio laptop of three years has had one thing after another go wrong, the latest being the lcd screen's backlight is dead (i currently type from my laptop, while hooked to a monitor).
the cost of repairs, most of them done by myself, to fix this laptop now would be anywhere between $450-$600; that's not even touching on the fact that this only has the limited power that existed three years ago.
so, i believe i'm looking for a new computer.
i've seen mixed reviews about emachines, which was my first look (due to the pricing), so i'm coming here.
let me outline some of the things i'm looking for: - desktop computer; no more laptops for me - lots of hard drive space, at least over 100gb - 512mb ram - amd chip (i'm a fan...) - 3+ usb ports - sound doesn't have to be great, but it has to be reasonable; i want a place to hook my headset - at least reasonable graphic capabilities.
doesn't have to be the best, but doesn't need to be the worst.
- monitor doesn't really matter to me, so long as it supports 1024x768 resolution at least - price under $900; in or around that, feel free to post it too i really like the look of some emachines' computers, but some of the prices make me wonder if what one pays for isn't what one gets (or at least in terms of quality)--(also do they or don't they come with a monitor?).
if anyone can offer some details into emachines, such as which model is currently looking to be the best and most reliable, or knows of a computer that fits or closely fits my specifications, i would greatly appreciate the information.
thank you!
sincerely, lelia katherine thomas
