I was wondering if all these were going to be expensive.
Only thing is, will a cheaper one travel the 400 ft to the router as good as a pricey one?
I sure don't want to screw up a good one.
We're actually planning to bring it in when we're not using it.
How long has yours lasted?
I don't want to keep getting $10 ones that die.
Also, what's the name of the one you got form geeks?
I search for usb wifi adapters and I still get $65+ price range.
