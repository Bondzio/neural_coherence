Since the drive shows in bios, go to Device Manager check the status there.
If it shows there, uninstall the drive, reboot and let Windows reinstall.
I've had similar experience with a micro advantage cdrw drive.
I had to install about six times, but finally got it.
It's been working for two years now without problems.
Best of Luck
