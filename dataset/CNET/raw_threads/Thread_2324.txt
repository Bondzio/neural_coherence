9308	0	500568	5001873	NR	tahuhali	10/3/10 2:00 PM	1.2861144E12	cannot find expansion	I have a HP pavilion elite e9237. I have another internal hard drive i want to install, but i can find a way to do it. There is another slot above my current hard drive, but i cant seem to find any connectors for it to my motherboard. I know there is HP's &quot;personal media drive&quot; option, but please don't make me explain why that's a stupid idea. So what i would like to know is if it is possible to install another hard drive in this PC.

Only question is whether there's enough drive controller and power connector support since the manual doesn't address ADDING a drive...just REPLACING a hard drive http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01859463.pdf VAPCMD
