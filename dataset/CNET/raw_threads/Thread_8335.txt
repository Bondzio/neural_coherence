I have a 19&quot; monitor and was experimenting with display settings in Control Panel. Well.... I put it at a resolution it didn't like, and now when the pc boots, I see the Windows logo come up.... well, the monitor display goes to black. I attached it to my laptop.... works fine. Is there something in the BIOS or CMOS settings I need to change to get it back to the default settings? Help!!!!! I'm kicking myself over and over again, and it's starting to hurt!!
