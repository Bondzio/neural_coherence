hi folks, i just wanted to share this email (below) that i received from a cnet member in regards to backing up your data.
while many of you may religiously backup your data locally on a physical external hard drive, dvds, flash drive, etc... if your data is important to you, in addition to your physical backup, do consider separate venues for storing your data--whether it is online storage service or having it kept at a completely different location.
because in catastrophic event like japan's recent earthquake and tsunami, your physical backup isn't going to do much good if it is physically destroyed.
so please keep this in mind and always be prepared for the worst case scenario.
be safe out there!
and thank you martha for sharing and caring enough to send us all a reminder!
cheers!
-lee here is martha's email: with the recent event in japan, folks along the coast of oregon had some anxious moments a week ago after the japan earthquake.
visiting with one of these coastal residents, an accountant with payroll &amp; tax clients, when ask'd about backups said she &quot;backed up&quot; every day but did not have remote or cloud backups.
seems like this is the golden opportunity to emphasize that backup means storing data in a separate venue.
when i did data management &amp; programming in the late 1980s two of us took home every night a couple of floppy disks (!!)
that had both app &amp; data.
this came in handy when the server failed.
the golden rule is backup, backup, backup.
the first is local (raid, etc.)
backup; the second is physical but stored at a remote location; the third is cloud.
i'll bet now that cloud computing is going to be look'd at much more favorably.
it is a good thing.
