<s> Hi All - I have been using a packard bell audiodream mp3 as a flash drive on my PC with no problems. </s>
<s> Recently atarted using a new usb flash drive (fingerprint) and ever since i've had problems with the packard drive. </s>
<s> the packard drive is recognised by my pc and is assigned a drive letter - i only know this as it comes up in the safely remove hardware window. </s>
<s> but it does not come up as a drive in 'my computer' any ideas? </s>
<s> Austin. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I've tried the Packard Bell mp3 in several other PC's with no proble so can only assume that it's to do with the PC and os. </s>
<s> Also, have tried other flash drives on the PC in the same usb ports and they all work too so it's something specific to the PB mp3 and the PC. </s>
<s> Any ideas anyone? </s>
<s> Replace it? </s>
