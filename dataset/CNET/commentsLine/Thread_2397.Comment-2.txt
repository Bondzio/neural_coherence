i have an 8700 and it is working fine with my dell 4600. the 8700 came with a version of paperport deluxe, mine was version 7.02. when i changed to xp pro i reinstalled it and i think had no trouble with the installation, and in any case it worked.
i am sure that when i upgraded to sp2 it worked fine with no change.
have you tried reinstalling it?
after reinstalling, if paperport opens, but you have trouble connecting to the scanner, try going to the file menu, and then to select source.
if there are more than one listed, try each.
in general, it is not the scanner that is the problem, but the software.
in late sept i found a paperport delux 9 on sale for a net of $30 after a $55 rebate.
i have not yet installed it because ver 7 is working fine.
