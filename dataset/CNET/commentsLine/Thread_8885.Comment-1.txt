i'm working on my sisters gateway machine that has one of those dual card modems (6001856).
the computer recognizes it and aol does too, but, when i try to connect online it comes back with a timeout and says no dial tone?
i know the line has a dial tone, it's the same one i use to dial out on with mine, not at the same time either.
the computer had a lot of spyware and adware on it among other things, which i removed.
i also even reinstalled windows without reformatting the hdd.
i can't figure this one out.
any ideas out there.
