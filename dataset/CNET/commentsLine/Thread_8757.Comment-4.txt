i'm just someone that gets called up when things don't work.
my view is from the area where it has failed and i share that not all printers work with all print servers.
if you can, see if they publish a list of what works.
mind you they can't keep an area 51 of printers to test so the lists are always out of date or incomplete but if you are lucky you may see your printer on the list.
