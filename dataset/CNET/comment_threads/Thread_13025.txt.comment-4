I have removed the media from the bad drive and installed it in a known good drive.
(I have facilities to do this kind of stuff) The heads seek but never find home.
Finally, drive gives up and stays parked.
I have tried Total Recall but they will not talk technical also, want $&gt;K to recover.
I can't afford.
If I can talk to knowledgeable tech I will learn what I don't know and may be successful.
how?
