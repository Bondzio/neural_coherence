after total system falure,(dvd-rw drives fail to burn dvd-r's, gfx card is pixelated and burned out, mobo won't boot with slave drive) it's time for an upgrade.
i haven't been keeping up with new hardware lately.
what would be some comparable parts for a new build?
seems like c2d and 9600gts are the way to go, but i still have no clue.
these are my specs: amd opteron @ 2.2ghz dual core 2 gb corsair xms ddr 450 asus a8n sli-x16 36.6 gb wd sata 3.0gb/s 10k rpm 250 gb wd caviar sata 3.0gb/s nvidia 7900 gtoc
