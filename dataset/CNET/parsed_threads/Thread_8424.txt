<s> Does anybody know anything about Fujitsu computers? </s>
<s> They are a big company over here in Japan but I am not sure if they sell their computers back in the the U.S., or maybe they do but under a different name. </s>
<s> Anyway, my current computer is over 5 years old and is pretty much shot. </s>
<s> Instead of trying to have it fixed and upgrade all the old components it would probably be better to just buy a new one. </s>
<s> I saw the following Fujitsu desktop in a computer store near my home as was just wondering if anybody thinks it's any good. </s>
<s> I tried looking for a computer with similiar stuff on the CNET Product Reviews site but had no luck. </s>
<s> So, I am going to try and include as much information as possible in this post and see what people think. </s>
<s> I apologize in advance for the length. </s>
<s> Model: Fujitsu FMV Deskpower FMV CE50H7 CPU: AMD Athlon XP 2800+ Cache Memory: 256MB (Primary); 512MB(Secondary) Chipset: SiS Company SiS741LV Chipset System bus: 333 Mhz Main Memory: Standard: 256MB (DDR SDRAM-DIMM, PC3200) Slots: 2 Open slots Upper Limit Memory: 1 GB Monitor: 17&quot; Digital LCD (Full Color 167,700,000 colors) Video Memory: 32 MB Graphics Accelerator: SiS Company SiS741LV FDD: optional HDD: 160GB (Ultra ATA/100, 7200turns/sec) DVD Drive: Super Multi Drive (DVD-RAM: Read 3x/Write 3x; DVD-R: Read 8x/Write 8x; DVD-RW: Read 8x/Write 4x; DVD+R: Read 8x/Write 8x; DVD+RW: Read 8x/Write 4x; DVD-ROM: Read 12x; CD: Read 32x; CD-R: Write 24x; CD-RW: Write 10x) Audio Function: internal chipset + AC97 Codec Speakers: internal (inside monitor) Modem: 56kbps (V.90 standard) 100BASE-TX/10BASE-T TV Capability: Yes It also has 2 slots for PC cards, 1 for SD Cards, 6 USB ports, input for S-Video or for three color VCR input cables, digital audio input and other stuff. </s>
<s> Can record upto 140 hours of TV programs directly onto the DVD-RAM. </s>
<s> Price is 160,000 yen ($1300-$1400?) </s>
<s> Even though the there a few things that probably could be better (ie: (1) the primary cache is only 256, (2) the CPU is not Pentium 4 (3) The graphics card seems to be an intergrated one (4) the systems bus is not 400Mhz or above) is this a good deal or should I keep looking? </s>
<s> It's just another PC. </s>
<s> I can't comment on the price since here it's double what we pay for such. </s>
<s> See http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=3005026&cat=SYS Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I figured that prices here were more quite high compared to back in the U.S., but I guess there's no way around that. </s>
<s> It looks like that Gateway PC doesn't come with a monitor. </s>
<s> According to the same website, monitors look to be about $300 and up so I guess that takes a little bite out of the price difference. </s>
<s> Couldn't tell from the page, but does that PC include DVD-RAM as well? </s>
<s> And, did it have TV capability? </s>
<s> Thanks again for the link. </s>
<s> It's dead here. </s>
<s> There is no interest in DVD-RAM and if I wanted such a drive, it's about 30 bucks on the used market. </s>
<s> As to TV cards, such are 49 bucks retail. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again for the reply. </s>
<s> That's interesting. </s>
<s> I think DVD-RAM is a big selling point over here. </s>
<s> TV cards are also a big selling point as well. </s>
<s> The sales rep at the store I went to said that it would be better to get a computer that came with a TV card preinstalled since the good ones cost about $300 (my guess) on their own. </s>
<s> Your replies have made me start to seriously consider ordering a computer from a U.S. company over the net. </s>
<s> Can you or anybody else recommend any going places that ship internationally and offer good support? </s>
<s> Also, I would need to get really good Japanese language capability so do you think I'll need a Japanese OS for that? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I've found &quot;support&quot; to be only for the hardware. </s>
<s> Some owners lose their cool when they find out that software support isn't being offered at the discount prices. </s>
<s> Is this OK? </s>
