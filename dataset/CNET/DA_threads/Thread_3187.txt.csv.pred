1.1.6	At first i was going to get a refurb aluminum unibody macbook pro 2.4ghz for $ 1600 but i would have to spend $ 400 of my own money , i was very set on this until my friend said i should build my own custom pc .	St

1.1.15	So which do you think i should get ?	Ques
1.1.16	Please leave all your thoughts , Thanks	Sug
1.2.1	Hi I bought I gaming laptop ( 2.6GHz Dual core AMD with Nvidia 7900GTX GO -17.1 & quot ; ) graphics and was happy for a short space of time ... the reason , when I wanted more performance after a year , there was nothing I could do except to get faster ram , bigger hard drive and re-install Windows .	St
1.2.2	It cost me 1600 and I regret it up to this day .	St
1.2.3	Recently I spend 1450 on building my own core i7 PC ( my first build ) and it was really easy - I have a large 24 & quot ; monitor , 920 i7 processor , 4870 1GB ATi card , 1TB HDD , 12GB DDR3 ram , Asus P6T Deluxe motherboard , coolermaster M850 , Thermaltake Armour case , Creative Titanium X-Fi sound card , Compro Dual DVB-T tv card and Windows Vista 64 bit .	St
1.2.4	The processor can be overclocked with ease whenever I want to ( Although , it 's not currently necessary to do so as it is able to run everything well ) and I have no problems - when I need more power , I can always upgrade components one at a time at a later stage .	St
1.2.5	At the end of the day , it depends on your needs - do you want a computer that you can take everywhere , or do you want something with performance that can serve you for many , many years with upgrades ?	Ques
1.2.6	Since , you are 16 , you probably need a computer that you can carry around to do all of your academic studies and some light gaming ( not sure about MACs for gaming -never used one before ) , but this is the rationale that you should use when trying to make a decision - good luck with the choice and remember , whatever you get will only be regarded as the 'best choice ' if it is able to serve all of your needs/requirements - hope this helps .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the response !	St
1.3.2	If i may ask where did you purchase your core i7 machine or did you build it yourself ?	Ques
1.3.3	Also what would be a good Windows laptop thats as good as the macbook pro but cheaper ?	Ques
1.4.1	Hi - I purchased all the components for my build from 3 retailers in the UK ( scan.co.uk / overclockers.co.uk/ tekheads.co.uk ) and yes I built the system myself - it was really very easy and there 's a wealth of knowledge on the internet should you have problems - and it 's cheaper than buying a pre-built system .	St
1.4.2	A good Windows laptop will be something like Alienware 's Area 51-m15x - it 's great for portability and has plenty of oomph to play some decent games - If you do n't want to buy from Alienware , try MSI or Novatech etc .	St
1.4.3	- you should find something similar .	St
1.5.1	You can get a better card : NVIDIA GTX 260- $ 170 @ newegg EVGA GTX 260 Superclocked- $ 175 @ newegg + a better RAM config : Patriot Viper 6GB ( 2x3 ) DDR 3 1600- $ 85 w/ mail in rebate @ Newegg save some $ $ $ ?	Ques
1.5.2	maybe a intel i7 920 2.66 Ghz @ buy.com if u want help just ask	St
