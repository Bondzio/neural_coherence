i do not know what the current warranty is with emachines or if there is a clause concerning breaking a seal of some type.
of course it is very easy to uninstall upgraded ram and a video card.
also if there is a defect in something, emachines would probably mail the new part and suggest where to go to have it installed.
of course, since you indicated what you need a computer for, you would not be installing additional ram and a video card, as that is to increase performance primarily in gaming.
