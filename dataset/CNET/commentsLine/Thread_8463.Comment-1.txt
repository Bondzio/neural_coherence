hi, - my wireless connection on my laptop gets lost whenever i receive phone call.
do you know the reason?
- also how do you use &quot;pc card&quot; on a desktop computer?
is it just for laptops?
i'm planning to add a wirelles adapter to my desktop pc, specifically &quot;microsoft mn-730&quot;.
which one do you recommend usb adapter or pci adapter?
