<s> Hey all, I'm thinking of purchasing the Motorola Xoom but I am a bit tentative so I need advice. </s>
<s> The last Motorola device I owned was the Motorola Dext/Cliq. </s>
<s> Motorola just ignored this phone and left it with bugs and on like Android 0.0.0.1 Will they keep a decent support for the Motorola Xoom? </s>
<s> Especially as the Xoom 2 must be coming soon... Also, I'm mainly going to be using it for browsing the internet and maybe doing some college work, will it be good at both those things? </s>
<s> Are there better alternatives in the same price range? </s>
<s> Thanks for taking the time to read this </s>
<s> &quot;College work&quot; was the clincher. </s>
<s> For now, today, this is not the machine you are looking for. </s>
<s> there's been some talk on here about Motorola Xoom and I thought I'd give it a review after getting my Motorola Xoom. </s>
<s> I've been a member for 2 days now and so far its been really good. </s>
<s> I've been able to download all the Harry Potter books, the entire Twilight Series, some David Balducci books, and even the comic book of that new movie 'Kick-Ass The only downfall I saw is when you turn up the volume the sound get distorted because the speakers cannot handle very high volume I seem them on sale on amazon http://amazon.com/MotorolaXoom </s>
