1.2.1	This is totally possible ...	St
1.2.2	I used my old Hawkings Wireless G USB reciever to plug into my 360 and voila , I could choose to use my network on the reciever .	St
1.2.3	Just go to the network dashboard menu after you plugged it in and you should see the reciever , just highlight it and select use .	Sug
1.3.1	You might want to plug the reciever on the back of the 360 , because in the front the ring of light and the DVD-Drive might interfere with the signals , so you want the best signal strength possible ...	St
1.4.1	I connected it to the 360 , but when i go to test connection , it seems to not be able to detect the hardware , despite the adapter getting power from the 360 .	St
