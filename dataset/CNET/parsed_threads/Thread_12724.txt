<s> I am having a problem with my computer after I return from standby. </s>
<s> I have an HP Pavilion ze5185 notebook computer with 2.1 Ghz Pentium 4 processor, 512 MB RAM, 60 GB hard disk drive, and the networking is built into the board. </s>
<s> I am using wired networking. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP Home Edition with SP2. </s>
<s> The router is a Dlink DI 604. </s>
<s> When I put my computer in standby mode and come back a few minutes or couple of hours later, networking isn't working. </s>
<s> I can't make a connection to the Internet. </s>
<s> I have to log off and log back on to restore access to my network or the Internet. </s>
<s> And, I usually run the computer in a limited account for security reasons, so I can't disable the network connection and re-enable it, or repair it, because I don't have admin access. </s>
<s> If anyone knows what the problem is, I would appreciate knowing what to do. </s>
<s> Is there a program that can help me with these connectivity problems and re-establishing network/internet connectivity when having these problems? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> on desktop... even on stand alone pc. </s>
<s> turning off the pc is much better than using standby or hibernate... </s>
<s> Gakada is correct--on some systems, there are problems with returning from standby and hibernate. </s>
<s> Sometimes a motherboard BIOS update that fixes this is available. </s>
<s> I did run into a wireless-g network adapter that exhibited this behaviour and was able to fix it by installing a newer firmware version. </s>
<s> Note that not all adapters have upgradable firmware. </s>
<s> Check to see if there is newer driver to download for the adapter. </s>
<s> Sometimes there is a network adapter setting that allows the computer to turn off the device to save power. </s>
<s> Try turning this feature OFF. </s>

<s> I use StandBy ALL the time - except for restarting once a week or so - I close the notebook cover and it goes in to StandBy. </s>
<s> Open it, and it is back on - Quickly. </s>

<s> I used to use Hibernate, but StandBy leaves the electronics warm - better than cooling down and heating up frequently. </s>
<s> The hard drive is off (maybe good, maybe not so good.) </s>
<s> And, it comes back to life very quickly. </s>

<s> I think that Hibernate makes much more use of the HardDrive, and I know that it takes MUCH longer to re-start. </s>

<s> Does anyone know of good reasons NOT to use StandBy regularly ?? </s>
