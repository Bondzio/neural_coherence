If you are asking if I am willing to physically build one myself, then no.
I have never done that so it would not be prudent to try.
I spend alot of time on the internet (4-6) hours sometimes a day and need reliability.If you are talking about having someone build it for me I am not sure...saving $100 bucks to have someone I don't know from Adam does not seem wise.
In my humble opinion, computers are machines and it is not IF they will break, but when.
What happens at that point is something I have to consider.
That is primarily why I do not want to buy a refurbished that normally comes with a 90 day warranty.
Buying an extended warranty with a company I know nothing about seems like a crazy idea.
I know that Dell is very reputable and that is why they are likely more expensive.
What did you have in mind?
