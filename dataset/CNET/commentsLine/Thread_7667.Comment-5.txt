i have the same router same setup (2 pc's hard wired, wireless laptop) and had the same problem.
im new to wireless and had just bought a laptop and router.
worked fine for a few weeks then started dropping out more and more.
called linksys and went step by step thru configuration and it has been ok since if i remember it had to do with the channel it was on.
call them and set it up right.
should be fine still cant share the damn printer though lol good luck
