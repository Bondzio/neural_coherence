all computers at this location access the internet wirelessly through an 802.1g wireless router, which is cabled directly to a dsl modem.
the wireless network is not encrypted, and frequently interlopers can be found camped-onto my internet connection.
usually mac filtering fixes this, but what i would like to do is to log traffic to and from the internet.
can this be done from the router or by bridging the hard-wired connection between the router and the dsl modem?
how difficult can this be?
thanks!
