1.1.1	I have 2 windows XP Pro SP3 systems , & quot ; A & quot ; is connected to the net through a router to a switch to the cable modem , & quot ; B & quot ; is connected via a crossover cable to & quot ; A & quot ; and connects out to the internet via ICS in & quot ; A & quot ; just fine .	St
1.1.2	I need to be able to RDC to both of them because they are going to another house where there is only the cable modem , no hub , no router , just the cable modem and I do n't want to spend any more of their money then I have to .	St
1.1.3	Now here is the strange part , I have two static IP 's , two separate Internet connections so I can easily test across the net .	St
1.1.4	I can RDC into & quot ; A & quot ; just fine , but not to & quot ; B & quot ; through the ICS connection .	St
1.1.5	I can RDC to & quot ; A & quot ; and in & quot ; A & quot ; start another RDC to & quot ; B & quot ; from within & quot ; A & quot ; and voila , I have connection across the net to & quot ; B & quot ; , but only by running one remote desktop connection from within another one .	St
1.1.6	That works OK but it is inelegant and I know I should be able to RDC directly to & quot ; B & quot ; through the ICS connection in & quot ; A & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	I changed the listening port for RDC in & quot ; A & quot ; and & quot ; B & quot ; and believe I have the router and NAT set correctly .	St
1.1.8	Both of my IP 's come out of my cable modem to a switch and I ca n't make this work even when I connect & quot ; A & quot ; to the switch and let it get a dynamic address and just bypass the router entirely .	St
1.1.9	I also believe that I have the firewalls set properly also but even when I turn them off I can only RDC to & quot ; A and then RDC again in & quot ; A & quot ; to & quot ; B & quot ; .	St
1.1.10	I can get to & quot ; B & quot ; for future needs on the part of my friends ( The & quot ; B & quot ; machine is for their 11 year old who destroyed the & quot ; A & quot ; machine by using P2P software and getting many viruses , I had to wipe and reload from scratch . )	St
1.1.11	This is driving me nuts ! ! !	St
1.1.12	There is an ICS bug in XP Pro SP3 that there is a hot-fix for and I installed that on & quot ; A & quot ; but supposedly do not need to on & quot ; B & quot ; .	St
1.1.13	Can anyone tell me if I am wrong there ?	Ques
1.1.14	I do not want to do anything to destroy the connections I have managed to achieve .	St
1.1.15	I would appreciate anyone who could tell me how to RDC directly to the & quot ; B & quot ; machine without having to nest RDP connections , even though that works .	St
1.1.16	Thank you very much and I apologize for the long post but this is pretty complicated .	St
1.1.17	Thank you in advance .	St
1.1.18	MeadMaker .	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Can they afford $ 30 for a router ?	Ques
1.2.3	Less problem 'cuz you wo n't have to have ICS and have it on everytime you want to access internet .	St
1.2.4	From the standpoint of remote control , this layout would be a lot easier to work with .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	Try logmein .	St
1.2.7	It 's free but you have to install a client application on the the two computers .	St
1.2.8	https : //secure.logmein.com/products/free/	St
1.3.1	Just today I saw a few go across Freecycle .	St
1.3.2	So it appears there are a glut of routers making the rounds .	St
1.3.3	So price may not be the issue since Freecycle things are free .	St
1.3.4	I will not help with your ICS routing issues .	St
1.3.5	No offense but it 's not a supportable position .	St
1.3.6	But I will tell you that for the second hop you may want to tinker with VNC ( see google . )	St
1.3.7	Bob	St
