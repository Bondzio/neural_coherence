Been hearing about this IP version 6 and have found loads of papers expalining what it does....... double dutch to me I'm afraid. What I would like to know is this: if I'm buying a switch, do I have to look out for certain criteria so it can handle IPV6? if I want to put in an IP address in Windows networking, how can I enter a 128bit IP address? as I understand it there is no more need for a subnetmask, what else is there to know? I've been trying to read some of the papers that are available but havent come across anything that's understandable. Thanks for your time Jimi
