<s> My father recently got a new printer (Epson Stylus C84). </s>
<s> As best as I can tell, the story apparently goes something like this: Since it seemed that at least some color ink cartridges were completely dry (several cleanings didn't solve the problem) he replaced the color cartridges (using 3rd party ink). </s>
<s> Since one of these wasn't recognized he got a replacement. </s>
<s> Since he wasn't getting ink he ran several more cleanings which didn't solve the problem. </s>
<s> Apparently, the magenta and yellow clogged with Epson ink (very likely completely before the first round of cleanings). </s>
<s> My question is: Do OEMs run tests to determine if 3rd-party in was used? </s>
<s> I am concerned that they will use &quot;it was the third party ink&quot; as a lame excuse to deny warranty service. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Most will ship in the printer with the non-maker refill cartridge and make it too easy for them to say no. </s>

<s> From Print prudently with recycled cartridges By Rik Fairlie Another sneaky way that printer manufacturers try to curtail refurbished consumables is an implicit threat to void warranties if you use these cartridges. </s>

<s> in these days of the Delusional Millenium Censorship Act) The Printer Cartridge Wars Page 4: The Environment and Your Printer Warranty About www.about.com Your Printer Warranty and You A legitimate concern of many people is whether using generic or remanufactured cartridges in their printer voids the printer's warranty. </s>
<s> The answer is no. </s>
<s> The following is a partial quote of the text of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Improvement Act, which deals with this exact question: MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY IMPROVEMENT ACT United States Code Annotated Title 15 Commerce and Trade Chapter 50 Consumer Product Warranties 15 Section 2032 ... (c) No warrantor of a consumer product may condition his written or implied warranty of such product on the consumer's using, in connection with such product, any article or service (other than article or service provided without charge under the terms of the warranty) which is identified by brand, trade or corporate name; except that the prohibition of this subsection be waived by the commission if: 1) The warrantor satisfies the Commission that the warranted product will function properly only if the article or service so identified is used in connection with the warranted product, and 2) the Commission finds that such a waiver is in the public interest. </s>
<s> In English, this means that no warranty may be voided by use of aftermarket products unless the manufacturer acquires a waiver that clearly shows such voidance would be in the public interest, or that their product will only function properly if the specified manufacturer parts are used. </s>
<s> There is one catch, however: the manufacturer (in this case your printer manufacturer) is not compelled to repair their product under warranty if damage done to the product occurred as a direct result of using aftermarket parts. </s>
<s> In other words, using generic cartridges is fine, and if your printer ever fails under conditions which have nothing to do with the cartridge you are using, no problem. </s>
<s> However, if the damage is directly caused (however unlikely) by the use of a generic cartridge, the warrantor may elect not to repair it, although the warranty would remain in effect for all other warranty issues. </s>

<s> From the mouth of the unnatural person Seiko Epson Corporation http://files.support.epson.com/txt/pho785/pho785f1.txt Q: Can the Epson ink cartridges be refilled or can 3rd party ink cartridges be used without voiding the warranty? </s>
<s> A: The ink cartridge cannot be refilled. </s>
<s> The ink cartridge has embedded within it, a 'Smart Chip' that electronically detects the ink levels and usage. </s>
<s> Once the ink has run out, the cartridge will no longer operate and needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> Refilling the ink cartridge will not reset the electronic counter on the chip. </s>
<s> Using non-Epson products will not void the warranty, however these products cause a failure, the repair will not be covered under warranty. </s>
<s> I know you have your own words to write. </s>
<s> But about that printer. </s>
<s> If you send it in under warranty, just don't send it in with refills or non-Epson carts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As in what axes do I wish to grind? </s>
<s> I don't have anything against a reasonable profit in concept. </s>
<s> Furthermore, some opportunities entail a great deal of risk. </s>
<s> Still, it seems that the insane business models which are sustained by consumables are only required in an insane world (world noun -- the empire of the United Nations of Texas) where everyone wants the latest $19.99 toy that can do everything. </s>
<s> Since R&D and development are expensive fixed sunk costs perhaps it would be better if we federalized and marketized it at the same time. </s>
<s> Generally speaking I prefer that only speculation (this includes short-term capital gains and the value of land irrespective of improvements) and extraction of non-recyclable natural resources be taxed. </s>
<s> In this case a small wealth tax may be in order. </s>
<s> (Historically only the wealthy benefited from technological advances.) </s>
<s> Voting rights could be issued (concerning the approval/rejection of grant proposals) commensurate with the tax paid. </s>
<s> Another possibility would be a big tax credit of say 70 to 90% while shortening patent and copyright protection to a few years. </s>
<s> Personally, I think the &quot;visions&quot; offered by Repugnats, Demobrats, the new enclosure movement, and the difficulties of the open source and free software movement have convinced me we need yet a another model -- one that is both equitable and workable. </s>

<s> &gt; 98% of getting your printer fixed is &quot;attitude&quot; &gt; and being in the warranty &quot;zone&quot; 1) As I've stated here even one of your employer's columnists and the unnatural person known as Seiko Epson Corporation agree with me regarding use of 3rd party inks. </s>
<s> I also stated that the printer had already clearly clogged on Epson ink. </s>
<s> 2) What does &quot;attitude&quot; have do do with it? </s>
<s> Did I attack their marketing scheme for example, perhaps by saying they are comitting fraud or simply state that they are doing what they can given economic realities and it is the system that is screwed up? </s>
<s> 3) By the way, I am a realist, not a cynic, let's keep the messages positive. </s>
<s> &gt; If you tell them all that you have here, then &gt; they may not want to deal with you. </s>
<s> You're the one who asked about what my &quot;issue&quot; was (besides the quite obvious already explicitly stated fact it clogged on Epson ink) and you got a few of them. </s>

<s> Hopefully your venting here will let you blow off the steam and let them get the printer fixed/exchanged. </s>
<s> Politics has little to do with your issue or everything, but Epson service won't care. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
