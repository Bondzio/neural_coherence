<s> I have a windows xp computer that i just tried to install a DVD burner into today. </s>
<s> The DVD burner is a NEC DVD+/-RW. </s>
<s> i read the article about how to install a DVD burner on here and thought i knew what i was doing. </s>
<s> But when i restarted my computer it stayed on the Gateway screen for about 3 minutes and then loaded onto XP. </s>
<s> then i went into My Computer to see if the drive was listed but it isnt. </s>
<s> Then my Direct CD icon in the corner of the screen has a little red cirle around it with a slash that says there isnt any drive.... i put a DVD into the DVD drive to see if windows media player would read it, but it didnt. </s>
<s> then i put a cd into my cd-r drive and it didnt even read that. </s>
<s> so now my dvd drive and my cd-r drive arent showing up. </s>
<s> i might have hooked the dvd burner up incorrectly.... i guess i need a little more help doing it. </s>
<s> the article on here is a little to 'smart' for me i guess and i dont think i fully understand somethings. </s>
<s> so, can anyway give me more in depth details about how to install it??? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> what may be wrong since no info was given as to how the drive was jumpered and cabled to the existing drive/s. </s>
<s> On a guess I would venture the drive is improperly jumpered and or cabled. </s>
