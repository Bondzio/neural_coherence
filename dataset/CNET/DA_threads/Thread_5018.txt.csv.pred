1.1.11	I would grately appreciate any help.	Polite

1.3.1	Hi Bob, Thanks for you message and sorry for not answering sooner.	Polite

1.4.1	Hi Bob, I just tried the Burnrights and it didn't work.	St
1.4.2	I still have the same problem the drives.	St
1.4.3	When I double-click on the drives in Windows Explorer, it still says that the drives are not accessible.	St
1.5.1	So far it sounds like the classic INCD issues.	St
1.5.2	Look up REMOVE UPPERFILTERS LOWERFILTERS on google.com after uninstalling Nero.	St
1.5.3	This is pretty proper stuff if there is no CD in the drive (you didn't say.)	St
1.5.4	Or the user has no rights.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Hi Bob, Thanks again for your message.	St
1.6.2	Indeed, there was a INCD issue, but even if there is a CD/DVD, it does that, but I finnaly found out from where the problem came.	St
1.6.3	Some program changed the the rights for the devices.	St
1.6.4	I just gave the rights back and it works!!	St
1.6.5	Thanks soo much for your help.	St
1.6.6	Have a good one Rapheek	St
