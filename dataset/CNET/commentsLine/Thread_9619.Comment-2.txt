all computers need a graphic card to work.
your laptop, of course, has one.
now you say your s-video cable doesn't work.
here is the thing.
s-video is not good for computer-to-tv.
tell me, what is the make/model of your tv?
better yet, what inputs (holes) does it have on the back.
does it have a blue monitor plug?
or dvi?
hdmi?
component?
a work-around: this may or may not work.
right-click your desktop, click properties.
click the settings tab.
look at the slide bar on the right hand side.
drag it all the way to the left.
then plug the cable in again.
s-video is primarily used for tv to dvd player or tv to vcr.
s-video cannot display the amount of pixels that your monitor has.
your laptop is doing good, you just may need a cable or two to connect it to your tv.
