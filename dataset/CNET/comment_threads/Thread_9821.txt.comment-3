I recently purchased PC-Telephone registration including 5000 units and an additional 10000 units.
After 1 brief international call, the credit shown in PC-Telephone menu went down to about 13,000 units but would not allow me to dial.
It is now showing 1 unit credit and will not dial anymore.
I sent detailed emails to PC-Telephone support with no response and now their email system is rejecting my emails.
What about the money I paid?
I am really frustrated.
There is no phone number that I could call.
What kind of company is this?
Are they fly by night or something?
