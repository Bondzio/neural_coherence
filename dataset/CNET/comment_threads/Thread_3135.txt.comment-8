I have the same problem with the same motherboard.
I replaced the blown MB in my eMachines T1742 with the Biostar and now the CPU fan spins, but I don't get any POST beeps or display.
I sent the first MB back and got a replacement, same thing.
I replaced the memory DIMM, same thing.
The board has built-in VGA, LAN, etc and nothing shows on my monitor when I power up.
I have double checked all the wiring and it's OK.
I sent Biostar an email asking for some tech support.
I re-seated the CPU and even tried another of the same CPU I have here and still nothing.
I've run out of ideas.
