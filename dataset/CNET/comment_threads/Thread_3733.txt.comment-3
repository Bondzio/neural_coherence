There is one other problem here.
That's not a proper backup but a &quot;good copy.&quot; Backup systems include multiple copies on media that is keep away from the site.
That is, when you backup to Media item 1, there is a media item 2 that is not attached to the computer and should be far away.
Otherwise you could be destroying what was on media 1 and therefore had no backup.
