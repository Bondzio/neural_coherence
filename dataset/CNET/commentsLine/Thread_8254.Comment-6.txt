hold it down at the first chime and keep it down until you see the grey apple and the spinning wheel.
the option key will show you all available boot disks that the system sees.
they are represented by the icons that you saw.
if it does not display the cd that you have inserted, then the system does not recognise it as a valid startup disk.
this could be because the cd drive is defective or that the disk itself is not correct or is damaged.
the flashing question mark indicates that the system cannot find the system folder on the hd.
either a corrupt system or a dead hd.
keep trying the &quot;c&quot; route for a while.
