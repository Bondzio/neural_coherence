sometimes i get too involved in my posts and assert my position without regard to keeping the conversation pleasant.
sorry about that.
there is an explanation that involves variation in total bytes among different hard drive makers.
it's difficult to get those densities exact.
the advertised total of &quot;120gb&quot; may actually be 120.238gb or 123.061gb.
that can explain the difference between 111.xxgb and 114.xxgb.
it took me a while to accept that a gb is not necessarily a gb, and that hard drive makers did a very poor job of explaining this.
(this was after i finally spent all that time and effort in switching my brain to metric.)
it even resulted in a lawsuit!
