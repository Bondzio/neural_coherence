<s> i'm building an awesome new computer and i need a motherboard and power supply to support what i'm getting. </s>
<s> so i'm getting a job over the summer and i'm getting $2800 at the end of it, so i'm spending it all on a new PC. </s>
<s> so far i'm going to get these things, two of these http://www.mwave.com/mwave/skusearch.hmx?SCriteria=4740101&CartID=done&nextloc= one of these http://www.xoxide.com/xoxide-alien-x-case.html and one of these http://www.ewiz.com/detail.php?p=XE-X5450BX&c=fr&pid=8dce7c2ae0fd0a7967838e4c35d0fe50ebe6a12d7693e08d219c7adb2f5d74a0 i already have a 500gb sata type 2 hard drive and a 4gb DDR2 RAM (two chips). </s>
<s> i also have a dvd drive but those are pretty much standard. </s>
<s> so what i need is a motherboard that supports all of these things and a power supply that supports all of these things. </s>
<s> preferably i would like the motherboard maximum to be 8gb with an available 4 slots for it, but 8gb with two slots would still be just fine. </s>
<s> i have no idea how to look for this kind of thing so that's why i need help from somebody else. </s>
<s> as you can see, i've stretched my budget pretty far already and i'll have to buy a keyboard, mouse, audio card, and other things so i need a motherboard/power supply that are within my current budget and work with everything that i want. </s>
<s> usually i'm not the kind of person to come on and ask about this sort of thing but i have no idea how to look for this sort of thing. </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help </s>
