hi, trying to print a stack of &quot;no.
6 3/4&quot; envelopes with my business return address.
it works great feeding them one at a time through the mp tray, but when i put a stack in the regulat tray, 75% come out printed crooked.
i have the side guides snugged down.
the nice guy at canon hemmed and hawed and basically said my machine may have a problem, then said that model wasn't really designed for that...what the?
anyone have luck printing more than one envelope at a time on a canon multi functon laser d480?
