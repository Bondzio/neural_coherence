$245 is outrageous for a motherboard.
i'm not a gamer but i am curious.
maybe in the future i'll try an sli setup.
i have always wanted to build a super high-end system for some reason, but i am going to wait until prices drop and newer boards come out with the dual x16 slots.
i read a customer review of the board where the guy had to tweak stuff in the bios to get it working properly; the customer specially mentioned it is not a novice board.
i going to wait and let the competiton fight each other.
