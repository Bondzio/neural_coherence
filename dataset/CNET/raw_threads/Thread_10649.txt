The graphics card, cpu and mainboard fans spin up as do the CD/DVD drives and harddrive but the system simply emits a series of single prolonged beeps . I have swapped out the RAM in all the various slot combinations and bought a nice 500W Ultra X-Connect PSU but to no avail. Should I buy new RAM as my current PC2100 RAM is supposed to be compatible according to the manual but it touts itself as a DDR 400 compatible board or should I get my machine checked over by an (expensive) professional ? Any advice would be much appreciated. Regards, gor41.

Can you go to memtest, download and put it on a floppy and test your memory one stick at a time. http://www.memtest86.com/ Running that system with anything except PC3200 in Dual Channel mode would be a shame. It is starved for memory bandwidth with PC2100. Not saying that the PC 2100 is the problem, just might be. The mobo mfrs site should give a list of memory that they have tested with the mobo.

I've checked Foxconn's website for info on RAM compatibility but to no avail however someone in another forum found some and I'm waiting for him to tell me where it is! Have you any sources?

Have you tried removing and reinserting the video card??? The AGP slot is sometimes hard to get the card fully inserted. Both Crucial and now also mushkin sites have info on memory by computer model and in some cases mobo's. There was another one listed in another recent thread about memory, in either the hardware or Computer Help forum.

To be sure the motherboard works with processors running at different speed and RAM running at different speeds however, the system is designed to use processors and RAM that go together like for your Athlon 3000 would normally use PC3200/DDR400 ....not DDR266. If you used a different processor running at a different clock speed .... maybe the system would boot right up. Even if the system would run with the CPU and RAM combo you have, you'd still lose a lot of performance because of the slower RAM speed. If able....I'd pick up some DDR400 like the Corsair ValuSelect CAS2.5 at Newegg (link below)...it's about $75.00 plus shipping for a kit containing 2 x 512MBs DIMMs total 1GB to take advantage of the dual channel memory architecture. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145440
