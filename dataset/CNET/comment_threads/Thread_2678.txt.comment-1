Hi myWD800BB-22JHAO just stopped working one day.It came pre-installed in my Gateway pc.It's only one year old.I bought a new HD&quot; WD800JB-00JJAO&quot; & swapped the pcb.It spun up,& showed in bios but I can't see or access it.It shows in device Mgr.
but not in disk management.Its an 80gb HD but in device manager it shows up as &quot;WDC ROM MODEL--SABRE--..7.87 gb&quot;.In bios It shows as&quot; WDC ROM MODEL--SABRE--..80gb&quot; Im a total newbie so I am confused .All I want is the data back.All Gateway & western digital will do is replace the drive.I could careless about the hard drive I just want my pictures & music back.So i have a few questions for any one who may know how I can fix this.I would definately send it to a data recovery company if I had the money ,but Im a student W/o a lot of money & can't afford it.
So my questions are ,is there a way I can access the drive by just finding a similar pcb?
Or am I going to have to find the same or similar pcb & swap & solder a chip from the donor to the dead pcb board?
and last,I was looking @ something called cloning the broken pcb's ROM ?There is a guy on E-bay that claims it will work &quot;Dariusale HDD solutions&quot;I would appreciate any info on this topic Thank You for your time & Patience I'm @ a loss b/c there were no signs or problems b4 it went kaput, no odd sounds,beeps ,or clicking.
I ran a diagnostic program(ontrack easy recovery) 2 try & get the data out (w/ the good pcb ) It spun up smoothly seemed perfect but ,failed the test saying it couldn't go thru w/ the test b/c of bad or errors or sectors or something 2 that effect.. Hopefully you can enlighten me .
Thank you for your time & patience ,Angela MDL#:WD800-22JHAO 7200rpm 2 cache IDE caviar DATE:08NOV2004 DCM#:HSCANTJAH PCB#2061-001292-000 AD made in Thailand
