i have a server (old pc i used) with a asus p4g8x deluxe motherboard and a geforce 6800 ultra (asus v9999) video card on it.
the system uses liquid cooling.
i decided to get the tower back up and running for various purposes, but that story aside, i have a problem.
two to three drops of coolant leaked (which is fixed) and somehow managed to land on the agp card right at the agp slot.
after not running for a large amount of time, these drops solidified (for some reason).
recent reuse made it hot, and the contacts on the agp slot (about 3 of them from what i can tell) melted.
this also caused burn damage on 2 of the contacts on the agp card itself.
the agp card still works in another agp board.
my concern is, will these two blackened marks (partially covering contacts) cause the contacts/agp slot of another board to overheat/melt?

thanks, guys....  this shows the damage.
a single contact is melted upwards.
any information would be helpful.
i'm primarily concerned that it might cause damage to a new motherboard.
