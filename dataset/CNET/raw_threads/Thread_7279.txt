I want any of my pcs to have an internet connection any time without depending on the other one (Not depending on the server system to be turned on for sharing the connection) and without the concept of proxy. Can I use a switch for this purpose or Is it must to use a Router.

Thank you for the reply Bob, Iam from India and I have a broadband connection subscription for 1 yr and can be extended too, but what I heard is a swith is cheaper than a Router, So if I use a switch is it possible to share the connection without the server system turned on? Thanks in Advance.

I would say for the most part you will need a router (it's a better idea for security reasons anyway.) But I was surprised to find that with my internet connection (w/ the supplied modem) I was able to plug in a switch and get directly to the internet from both machines. If you already have a switch laying around you could try it out.

A router is less than that so in one month you would incur more costs than a router. No, you can't share a connection on a switch. But your costs have to be firmly stated to figure out if you could use the ISP's offer. Bob

The broadband charges here are Rs 10800 per anum (approx. 230 USD i.e 20 USD per month) and the cost of switch is Rs 900 (20 USD) and the cost of Router is around Rs.2000 (45 USD). If I cant use swith for sharing without server then i must go for Router.
