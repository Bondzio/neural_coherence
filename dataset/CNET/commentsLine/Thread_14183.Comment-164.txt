first computer was a sinclair - you plugged it into a portable pc and ran it off a tape deck.
you turned it on and off by unplugging it!
second computer was ibm 360 mainframe, then the pc came out but instead of ibm i bought the compaq luggable.
two floppy discs.
a mouse!
that was new.
and a 5mb hard drive that i installed into a slot in the compaq as a beta tester - do not remember the brand right now but they were one of the very first.
later upgraded that to a whole 20mg!!
got one of the first true laptops at a computer faire _ remember those?
got my first color screen at a faire too, 14&quot; rgb.
wow!
was that hot or not!
went through various compaqs, gateways (had to rebuild one from scratch as the mother board kept failing and they kept sending me parts), finally am now fairly satisfied with two dell desktops and a laptop.
been a trip and a half though and have built a number of units for my sister.
we've certainly come a long ways since then!
