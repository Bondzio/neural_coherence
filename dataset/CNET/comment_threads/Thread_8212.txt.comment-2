You can get LCDs that adjust for height.
You might get, if you don't already have one, a pneumatic chair that can rise up a bit.
Yes, LCDs work best in their native resolution and, with 17&quot; and 19&quot; having the same one, the 17 will produce smaller icons.
If you wear glasses which are bi/trifocals, get a pair of single vision lenses optimized for your normal position from head to screen.
XP will let you make the icons larger and stay with the native resolutin so that's not a problem.
There are also some &quot;accessibility&quot; options that you can work with.
Hope this helps.
