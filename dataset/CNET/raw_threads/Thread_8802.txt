I was trying to open a folder and it went into (Not Responding) mode. I know I shouldn't but I was frustrated so I just unplugged it. Once I did that I got the bubble for a Write Error, I don't know the exact wording. Now I had just transferred something to it, but I thought is was done as the transfer notice went away. So now the computer does not see the hard drive anywhere. I have check, Disk Management, I have check BIOS and I have done this at home and on my work computer. Now while I would like to save the hard drive what I really need is some of the data. Does anyone have any ideas for getting the computer to recognize the drive again. I have a program to get the data back but first the computer needs to see the drive. Thanks for any help.

I've read where putting the HD into the freezer and cooling it down temporarily gets it to work sometimes long enough to get data off of it. The freezing cold changes the metal size and allows the stuck platter to spin again, so i assume. Good Luck! It is at least worth a try since nothing else is allowing it to be recognized at this point. Anthony
