compatible with USB 1.1.
Good buer reviews too.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16815104803 This would give you the hardware interface to use any USB device including you choice of USB external HDDs, external CD/DVDs, Flash drives etc., You can buy prebuilt or put together your own depending on need preference and budget.
If you buy prebuilt ...I'd avoid Maxtor as post for failures 'seems' higher than most.
Let us know.
