I forgot to mention that once we install PPPOE onto a PC that WINSOCK is forever suspect and may not be supportable or even repairable.
It may interfere with use on a router.
In one extreme case it was not repairable until we reinstalled the OS.
We tried but after hours on the phone with Microsoft we knew it was time to move on.
