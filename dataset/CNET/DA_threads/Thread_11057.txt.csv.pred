1.1.1	Im looking for help with what appears to be a common yet very fatal error with my PC .	St
1.1.2	When I press the power button , the tower lights turn on , fans start up , but I get no post , no beeps , and of course no video .	St
1.1.3	Now , a week or two prior to the PC basically dieing , I was experiencing some very strange behavior from my PC which , at the time , I thought was video related .	St
1.1.4	While in the middle of playing a game ( WoW if it matters , though Im sure it doesnt ) , the computer would crash , causing the image on screen to become distorted and repeat itself in rows across the monitor .	St
1.1.5	It looked kinda like if you tiled a small picture onto the background of your desktop .	St
1.1.6	Anyway this weird freeze started happening about once a day .	St
1.1.7	Audio would still be playing out of the speakers , but as far as the screen , I had to keep reseting the pc to get out of it .	St
1.1.8	After a while it started happening more and more frequently to the point where I could only be in game for a minute or two before the pc would crash .	St
1.1.9	Things only got worse from there .	St
1.1.10	This weird graphical glitch started happening outside of the game now .	St
1.1.11	Watching a video on youtube , for example , would cause the same error to occur .	St
1.1.12	After that the screen glitch would occur while simply being idle in my desktop .	St
1.1.13	After that , it started happening at the login screen , and once it even happened during a post .	St
1.1.14	Then finally , one morning when I tired to start it up , the pc refused to boot , and here I am today asking you all for help .	St
1.1.15	Here are my PCs Specs : Motherboard : ASUS A2N-SLI Deluxe CPU : AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 3.0ghz PSU : Enermax 600W Noisetaker II Video Card : Geforce 6800GT x2 ( SLI ) RAM : 2GB Kingston Hyperx DDR2 ( 2 Sticks , 1gb each ) I dont have a second computer to test components in , so the best I have been able to do is run some rough tests with a barebones setup outside of the case using : The psu 1 stick of ram 1 video card the cpu and heatsink fan ( no new thermal compound applied yet ) And ofcourse my monitor .	St
1.1.16	The first thing I noticed when I opened the case was that the cpu was stuck to the heatsink fan .	St
1.1.17	With the help of a hairdryer , I was able to ease it off .	St
1.1.18	I inspected the CPU and found that no pins were bent or broken ; everything looked ok. ( I just thought Id include that little bit on information in case it has some relevance to what the problem might be . )	St
1.1.19	Anyway , onto the tests : For obvious reasons , I wanted to test the video card first .	St
1.1.20	After basically watching any sort of graphical performance from this pc degenerate into crap , I was fairly convinced that the video card the monitor was plugged into had gone bad .	St
1.1.21	Besides , I had been having a lot of driver errors recently with these video cards ( which I believed I had resolved ) , so at the time there was no doubt in my mind that one of them was the culprit .	St
1.1.22	Unfortunately , as I said earlier , I have no second pc to swap components with , so the best I could do was swap my lead video card ( the one on top in my SLI set up ) with the other one .	St
1.1.23	Unfortunately , this solved nothing .	St
1.1.24	With my second video card installed in the barebones setup , I was still getting no post , no beeps , and no video .	St
1.1.25	This discouraged me quite a bit .	St
1.1.26	Is it possible for both video cards in an SLI setup to go bad at the same time ?	Ques
1.1.27	I had no clue , so for the time being I decided to test other pieces : -Swapping out my RAM with the other stick yielded no results .	St
1.1.28	-Removing all RAM from the setup gave me an error beepcode .	St
1.1.29	-Removing all video cards gave me another error beepcode .	St
1.1.30	-After leaving the power on for a few minutes , the cpu would get warm And so I turn to anyone willing to read this post .	St
1.1.31	I know its long , but I wanted to include as much information as possible , since I seriously do not know what to do next .	St
1.1.32	Whats the problem ?	Ques
1.1.33	Is it the mobo ?	Ques
1.1.34	I know mobos cause this problem a lot , but the fact that I was getting error beepcodes caused me to believe otherwise .	St
1.1.35	Am I wrong ?	Ques
1.1.36	Is it the cpu ?	Ques
1.1.37	The fact that it was basically welded onto the hsf when I first opened the case seemed a little weird , and again , I know that faulty cpus cause this problem a lot too .	St
1.1.38	Is it possible that a lack of thermal compound can cause barebones setup to not boot ?	Ques
1.1.39	Is it the video cards ?	Ques
1.1.40	Cause if you said yes Id believe you without question .	St
1.1.41	But the fact that neither card changed anything caused me to second guess myself .	St
1.1.42	Is it possible for both cards to go bad at the same time ?	Ques
1.1.43	I dont know , so I have not come to a conclusion .	St
1.1.44	Is it something else ?	Ques
1.1.45	Is this no boot problem even related to the video errors I was getting prior to it dieing ?	Ques
1.1.46	Please help me out .	Sug
1.1.47	If any part of my story has yielded some sort of hint that I clearly am not seeing , please tell me .	St
1.2.1	It appears you 've done all you can .	St
1.2.2	I would suggest replacing the PSU .	St
1.2.3	If you system was n't cooled enough during all the time you had it , it experienced & quot ; heat stress & quot ; which in turn applies to all componets .	St
1.2.4	What gave out or became the weak link can be anything .	St
1.2.5	Since , you play as gamer you can drive the system to extremes and cause an earlier death .	St
1.2.6	In other words , it was pushed until it pushed back and failed .	St
1.2.7	Even if you replaced the PSU there 's no guarantee it will work , though it may .	St
1.2.8	Many times removing parts to other system alone , they work , but once all together again , they do n't as a package .	St
1.2.9	As for the cpu being stuck ( welded ) , heat will cause air to be driven out and be some suction from application & dryness of the goop over time .	St
1.2.10	In many cases , I look at the psu or mtrbd .	St
1.2.11	being at fault .	St
1.2.12	You can google for t/s'ing guides but you did alot of what to test .	St
1.2.13	Of course , replacing parts is about what you can do since you do n't have another system .	St
1.2.14	Also , return the bios setting to defaults if you tweaked them for performance setting .	St
1.2.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply Willy .	St
1.3.2	I was able to test my PSU with my brother 's very old PC ( its the only component still compatible with his set up ) and it started up fine .	St
1.3.3	While I am not entirely sure this was the most effective test ( his PC is going on 5 years old ) , it proves my PSU is n't completely dead .	St
1.3.4	Should I just RMA my mobo and see what comes back ?	Ques
1.4.1	If you can RMA after 5yrs .	St
1.4.2	heck go for it .	Sug
1.4.3	PSU are strange items , I often post that they lose their & quot ; phuumf & quot ; after awhile .	St
1.4.4	The other half is the mtrbd .	St
1.4.5	and since logic is part of the & quot ; start-up ckt & quot ; something a user ca n't fix , a replacement mtrbd .	St
1.4.6	may be the fix .	St
1.4.7	However , as I stated it can be anything or a & quot ; combo & quot ; of problems .	St
1.4.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
