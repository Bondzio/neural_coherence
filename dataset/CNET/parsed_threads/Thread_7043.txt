<s> Hello, I'm buying a new Imac and am trying to decide whether it's best to buy a larger hard drive in the MAC or add more storage with an external drive. </s>
<s> I currently have an older Dell (8200 Dimension) with an external 750GB Seagate Free Agent Pro drive for back up of pics, movies, etc... </s>
<s> I'm looking at moving the external HD to the MAC... but have read some interesting recent reviews on these Seagate drives. </s>
<s> My new Imac is being used for photo/video editing/DVD creating. </s>
<s> These picture/movie files just seem to swallow up the storage space and I want to configure this right! </s>
<s> I have loads of family projects to do which involve a ton of scanning or digital image transfer of some sort! </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> I'd rather have more internal disk space....to wit I always put 2 HDDs in my PCs ... and the second HDD serves primarily as a backup to the primary drive. </s>
<s> Externals only used for 2nd backup Is a second HDD possible in an iMAC ? </s>

<s> and you wouldn't want to open up an iMac and void the warranty to try to fit two drives in. </s>
<s> It's an all-in-one, so there's limited configurations and a very limited upgradeability (RAM only). </s>
<s> To the original poster: Which iMac do you plan on getting? </s>
<s> If you need a lot of storage, go with one of the 24 inch models, which can support up to a 1TB drive. </s>
<s> That may work for you. </s>
<s> If you'd rather get a 20 inch model, you could get up to a 750GB I believe on the 2.4Ghz model. </s>
<s> The low end 2.0Ghz model will only take up to 500GB, so I don't recommend that one if you plan on doing a lot of projects. </s>
<s> Usually, my iMovie projects take up around 5GB or more while I'm working on them. </s>
<s> Consider how long your films/slideshows will be and how many files you would want to incorporate into such projects before making a selection on internal storage. </s>
<s> That said, you should get a secondary backup for your current external drive incase it dies. </s>
<s> Hope this helped. </s>

<s> applies to MacPRO ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Apple sells Pro components, in the form of RAM, hard drives, and graphics cards. </s>
<s> Those can be upgraded by oneself, I believe. </s>
<s> Best to go large with the internal on the iMac and buy a pair of externals just in case. </s>
