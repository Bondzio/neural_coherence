<s> 1gb SanDisk micro SD Yesterday I added some new songs to my card and noticed they wouldn't play on my phone. </s>
<s> Error message said files contained unrecognizable data... Two hours after that, I found that nothing could be either added or deleted from the card (tried to delete files using phone and computer). </s>
<s> Upon suggestion from my manager, I copied everything I had on the memory card to the hard drive on my computer and tried to reformat the card. </s>
<s> It wouldn't reformat in 2 phones (Cingular Moto krzr and Samsung D807) or on my digital camera. </s>
<s> Both phones said the card was corrupted and the camera merely said card error. </s>
<s> I did find that after I tried to format the card in the camera, everything was in fact wiped clean. </s>
<s> Now, all that's left is to format the darn thing. </s>
<s> Tried it in the krzr first... appeared to format, but actually didn't. </s>
<s> Tried it in the D807... also appeared to format, but didn't. </s>
<s> Tried it in the camera... card error. </s>
<s> I tried to format it on the computer (card no longer auto-runs, but you must manually run it and it prompts you to format) using FAT and FAT32, but again it was unable to format. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I can try? </s>
<s> Or should I just scrap this card and buy a new one? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7593_102-0.html?forumID=58&threadID=260721&messageID=2564853 See if SANDISK has similar and definitely the 1GB should be in warranty so ask for a freebie. </s>
