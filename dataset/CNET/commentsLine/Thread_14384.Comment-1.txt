i am planning to buy a new gaming pc in april but i am confused with my options, i have seen the xps 720 at dell, with a qx 6600 is that good enough to run games like warcraft 3, counter strike , call of duty, crysis etc or should i go for some other pc.
2) and which proccesor will be better for these games?
core 2 quad qx6600 or core 2 duo e6850 as some games dont use as many cores.
pls help !
