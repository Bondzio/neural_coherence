Hi, I've got 2 two rooms - each with 2 computers and a wired Ethernet hub - interconnected by an Ethernet cable.
I use dial-up from one computer and do not have broadband cable or DSL nor am I really interested in getting either in the near future.
I just got a Wi-Fi capable laptop and thought I'd get acquainted with Wi-Fi access to my wired network.
My first thought was getting a Wireless Access Point, say a Linksys WAP54G, but now I'm confused.
A router, say a Linksys WRT54G, *SEEMS* to have more functionality - 1) a WAP 2) a Hub - with 4 Ethernet ports (???)
3) a cable/DSL router for *LESS MONEY*, as opposed to a WAP with only 1 Ethernet port.
Am I missing something ???
Can I really replace a wired hub with the WRT54G and get wired hub functionality AND wireless access to my wired network ?
Thanks in Advance
