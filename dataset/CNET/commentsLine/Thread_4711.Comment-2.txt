25 years ago i worked in a small computer store while back in school as a non traditional student.
we sold some what then seemed rather expensive surge protectors.
the proof to me that they were worth the money was when one customers home was hit by lightening.
the only thing damaged in their computer was the modem, the surege managed to come in through the phone line.
they lost all the tvs, their microwave, their fridge and freezer plus a few radios to the hit but like i said the modem was the only part of their computer that received any damage.
one of the radios that died was in the other half the same duplex wall plug the surge protector was plugged into.
