<s> Hello, We have a new router (D Link) at offices which is fixed with LAN wall points on different places , we want to use it . </s>
<s> I connected computers to the LAN points with regular lan cables , it gives me the alert (connected) but no bytes received . </s>
<s> I tried to ipconfig an here's what i got : Windows IP Configuration Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection 2: Connection-specific DNS Suffix . </s>
<s> : Autoconfiguration IP Address. </s>

<s> : Any suggestions ? </s>
<s> i tried removing the drivers and reinstall it.. i tried changing cables , i tried restarting router , i tried giving an ip (192.168.0.5) to each computer... ALL the Same problem .. nothing seems worked. </s>
<s> Now go back to stock (auto assign IPs) and then use factory made cables from the router to a pc. </s>
<s> I can't explain why the wiring in the walls is wrong more than half the time. </s>
