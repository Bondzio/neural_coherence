Ok, I am running: Dell dimension desktop, ethernet connection to BT Voyager 2100 wireless router/modem. I also have a pegasus TI notebook connected wirelessly. Both can access the internet. Now I am trying desparately hard to set up a network for filesharing/ printing. But I am getting a major problem: When I try to set up the desktop for sharing, I get &quot;spooler SubSystem App encountered problem and needs to shut down&quot; during the configeration process. As a result it never configures fully - help!!! As a result I do not see my laptop - and my lappy cannot get to even find the printer! Help please......

My desktop is 2 1/2 years old, and runs XP sp1 - I was put off by all the probs with upgrading - maybe that is not such a problem now? The new notebook runs SP2. I have BTW found an answer on another forum found out how I can swith the print spooler off. I am still, however having major problems, in that neither computer is seeing each other, despite each being able to connect to the internet. I will try again later......
