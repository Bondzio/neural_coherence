1.1.1	A friend running Windows XP has an HP Color Laserjet 1600 and she asked me to have a look at why it was n't printing .	St
1.1.2	I clicked on the printer icon in the control panel which brought up the printer .	St
1.1.3	When I right clicked on the printer , it displayed the words 'paused - deleting ' .	St
1.1.4	I un-paused the printer , the documents in her queue printed , and the printer disappeared .	St
1.1.5	I re-installed the printer but could never get anything to print .	St
1.1.6	The first item in the print queue would have a printing status of 'error-printing ' .	St
1.1.7	Running the Windows troubleshooter yielded nothing .	St
1.1.8	I could not print a test page , print from DOS , etc..	St
1.1.9	I then did a system restore to get her system back to a week ago .	St
1.1.10	The printer once again said paused - deleting , only the documents were the new documents I 'd tried to print after the re-install .	St
1.1.11	I un-paused and the new documents printed .	St
1.1.12	And the printer again disappeared .	St
1.1.13	I ca n't seem to fix this .	St
1.1.14	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	The heading on the Peripherals Forum declares that 'CNET 's Forum on peripherals is the best source for finding help , troubleshooting , and getting buying advice from a community of experts .	St

1.3.1	Our Computer Help has more readers .	St
1.3.2	My thought is the old stop and start the print spooler issue or fix .	St
1.3.3	I make no apologies for Microsoft leaving this unfixed and decline to dive into a dissertation about it .	St
1.3.4	So the short answer is that its still buggy .	St
1.3.5	You can improve it sometimes with the latest service pack and HP 's drivers but even then , I 'll have to open the command line up and stop the spooler , delete a few files and restart it .	St
1.3.6	In closing you may not know this so let me add the video driver is used to render some content .	St
1.3.7	This means we want the video driver to be current too .	St
1.3.8	Good luck , Bob	Polite
