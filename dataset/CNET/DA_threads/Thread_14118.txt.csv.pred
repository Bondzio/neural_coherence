1.1.1	Yesterday I decided to clean out the dust inside my desktop , so I removed the RAM , video card and 2 fans , that 's it .	St
1.1.2	After cleaning it out , I put it all back in .	St
1.1.3	Plugged everything in and powered on my computer .	St
1.1.4	The computer makes the sounds it normally does when It 's powered on , but the monitor had an orange light , meaning there is power to the monitor but it is n't connected to a computer .	St
1.1.5	Yes , I made sure the monitor was hooked in well , not loose or anything , I 've checked and am pretty sure the video card is in properly .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.7	I hope it 's something obvious I might have missed .	St
1.2.1	Make sure the graphics card is seated firmly and screwed in .	St
1.2.2	Make sure any power connectors that went to the card are plugged back in ( 6 pin , 8 pin ) ( this often does n't apply unless its a powerful card ) Make sure the RAM is in the same slots you took it out of .	St
1.2.3	Do n't ask me why , motherboards are weird like that .	St
1.2.4	Try powering on with only one stick of RAM , try the other stick if it still does n't work .	St
1.2.5	Make sure the power supply is plugged into everything it 's supposed to be plugged into ( motherboard especially ) .	St
1.2.6	If you removed the heatsink and CPU cooler , double check you put it back on right .	St
1.2.7	This is all I can really think of right now .	St
1.2.8	I am leaning towards RAM being your problem if the monitor is powering on .	St
1.2.9	Do you have a speaker installed for beep codes ?	Ques
1.3.1	The only thing I can think of that I did wrong is put the fan that sits over the CPU heatsink wrong ( never took the heatsink out ) , but It 's still sitting over it doing it 's job , I just twisted it one more space than was supposed to .	St
1.3.2	The graphics card is out-dated so no power connectors .	St
1.3.3	I 'll try with only 1 stick of RAM and post again and post back in a few minutes .	St
1.4.1	Doing anything with the RAM did n't work ...	St
1.5.1	I ran into this last week .	St
1.5.2	The machine had onboard graphics as well as the VGA card .	St
1.5.3	I had to move the cable to the onboard to change the BIOS setting and then back to the card for the next boot .	St
1.5.4	Without make and model I ca n't tell if this applies or if that information would have me think of something else .	St
1.5.5	Bob PS .	St
1.5.6	Test the monitor on another PC .	St
1.5.7	PPS .	St
1.5.8	Check both ends of the vga cable .	St
