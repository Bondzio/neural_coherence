how often do you clean out the dust bunnies inside your computer?
once a month (how much did you find?)
once every few months (how much did you find?)
once a year (how much did you find?)
once every couple of years (how bad was it?)
whenever i feel like it whenever i start to hear strange noises whenever i do hardware upgrades never have (why have you never cleaned?)
i didnt know bunnies could live in my computer if do regularly clean out your computer's innards, share with us how you go about it.
