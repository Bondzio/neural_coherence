Every time I turn on my pc the monitor only has about a 33% chance of &quot;starting up&quot; and showing the computer graphics. The rest of the time the monitor turns on, but doesn't show anything (it's just black). I have checked all of my connections and use the latest video drivers, but I still seem to keep having this problem, which is really annoying since I have to reboot 2-3 times every time I try to turn on my computer just to get the monitor to work. I think it may have something to do with the fact that I have an integrated video card (I installed a AGP video card the first time I used it) and that this is confusing the monitor. Any ideas on what may be happening? Here are my system specks: Pentium IV 2.4 GHz 512 Mb Ram Video: GeXCube Radeon 9600 XT 256 Mb Video Motherboard: ASUS ASRock GE PRO-M2 Windows XP SP 2 I use a 15&quot; Monitor that worked on my previous PC. Thanks for your help.
