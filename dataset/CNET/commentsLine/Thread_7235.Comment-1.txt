i really don't want to research this, so was hoping for a quick answer from all you techies.
i am going to europe end of june and want a tablet (ipad or xoom) to take as its less bulky than a laptop.
i will be taking videos with my flip video camera and want to upload since amount of video is limited to about 3 hours on the flip.
i see the xoom has a usb port, does the ipad also?
what recommendations can you give me?
