PCpitstop benchmark says the Video is performing at 52% of the same card/CPU/memory on other systems. Checked direct x ( 9b). system runs ok, but checking video after processing seems very ordinary. what steps might I check-redo-etc to get to normal levels??,TIA

The reason revolves around the new drivers being more &quot;correct&quot; with less display issues. For example a stray line that appears on some game is now gone. Cost? A little speed. Bob

If you set the video refresh rate to 60 Hz, and your card tops out at 60 FPS, then a benchmark like you noted could give you low marks even though it was giving you a solid 60 FPS. There was no need to generate more than that. This is just one example of how a benchmark is flawed. Bob

I just ran it and it says my vid perf is 145% of SIMILAR,,,,What does similar mean?? Keep in mind their running a 2d test, not much value in a gamers world. If you want to play with this go here. www.passmark.com Get their perf test, 5.0 I think, and then a big piece of paper and a pencil as you test vid drivers, mobo drivers, bios settings and build a chart. It's GREAT fun.
