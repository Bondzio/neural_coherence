1.1.1	Hi I have recently acquired a Power Mac G4 using OSX which has a SCSI card installed in one of the PCI slots.	St
1.1.2	I have a very reliable Agfa scanner(Snapscan 310) which is over 10 years old but has always given me excellent quality and I'm reluctant to replace it.	St
1.1.3	Even though I've re-installed the software from the original Agfa installation disk, every time I try to use the scanner through Adobe Photoshop in Classic mode, a message pops up asking me to turn on the scanner which of course it already is!!	St
1.1.4	Does the fault lie with incompatibility between the scanner and the SCSI card or the Agfa software and the G4 or am I missing something blindingly obvious?	St
1.1.5	Thanks Eric	St
1.2.1	If you can, see how the scanner responds when you try to access it.	St
1.2.2	P	St
1.3.1	Appreciate the suggestion, but through trial and error I have since discovered that the SCSI card was the problem, OSX wasn't recognising it.	St
1.3.2	All sorted now thank you.	Polite
1.4.1	NIL	St
