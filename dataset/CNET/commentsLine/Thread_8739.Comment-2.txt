all i can offer is i would not setup or support such a system.
i will offer that i might consider using the more accepted &quot;use a router as a access point&quot; noted in this forum's sticky are at  there are routers that do lock up when a vista machine is near but that's an old issue cured with firmware or if not, replacing the bad router.
as to &quot;why is this happening?&quot; i can't tell you but i do see the problem and have had to cure far too many with firmware, replacements or revamping the network., bob
