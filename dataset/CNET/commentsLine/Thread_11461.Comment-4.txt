1. does your laptop have a hdmi connection or is there a cable that runs between vga and hdmi?
today, it's connected with the hdmi connection.
i can use vga but because the hdmi pipes audio it's a cleaner solution.
2, my vga signal is not recognized by the tv.
i have a request for information out there to toshiba -- i'm using a vga cable (15 pin, male both ends, to connect the two).
so far no response.
yes it's troublesome for some to setup.
i used the clone display option.
some have not played with dual displays or it just doesn't work for some.
let's just say i futz with it and so far i usually get it to work unless it's some os the owner loaded and there is a missing driver or bum os install.
3. the printer is not something i do not want to replace, got a great deal on it and it is more heavy duty (small business vs home use).
i'd rather move all equipment back if i could find an alternate way to stream movies (more important to my husband than me-- i need the office capability).
there are small print server boxes galore out there.
from 25 to much higher prices.
but the problem i see is some of them falter on features.
such as my wifi hp c4780 lets me scan from any machine.
4, i'm taking a serious look at the dell you sent the link for, thanks again.
ramarc, a member posted that.
nice find.
i had missed that one.
