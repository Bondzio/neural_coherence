<s> Hi all, I have a old, 2000, gateway desktop with no USb 2.0 ports. </s>
<s> I have bought a ALI 6 port USB 2.0 pci card hoping that it would be easy peasy but no way... the ports are showing in my hardware device but every thing i connect to the pci card ports wont be recognized or work properly... if i connect to the mainboard USB 1.1 ports everything is fine... installed SP2 windoes XP professional, upgraded my BIOS, did everything I could but the pci card, though showing the ports, wont recognize external hdd's, cameras etc... any help id much appreciated. </s>

<s> Sometimes it's the motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> But your post didn't reveal what motherboard chipset you have, the exact model of the machine and .. details. </s>
<s> Review http://www.usbman.com and hope you find it. </s>

<s> Those are two things to consider. </s>
<s> If there's a way for you to test that card in another PC- that would eliminate one variable. </s>
<s> Another possibility would be a conflict with another device. </s>
<s> Go into device manager & see what IRQ is assigned by going to view&gt;devices by resource. </s>
<s> Sometimes changing slots or even removing the one PCI device that's sharing the IRQ, installing your card, then reinstalling the first device- can get it recognized properly (shutting down & restarting for each). </s>

<s> Any question mark or yellow exclaimation point? </s>
<s> Do you see enhance 2.0 usb there? </s>
<s> Have you checked to see if the USB card manufacturer has updated drivers available for it? </s>
<s> I installed a CompUSA USB card a while back and was having some weird problems with it at first. </s>
<s> I d/l'ed and installed some new drivers for it from a CompUSA Web site and since then it seems to be working better (although I don't use the USB ports that much, so the apparent increased stability could just be coincidence or luck). </s>
<s> Worth a look. </s>
<s> Also, you might consider disabling the built-in USB ports if you can. </s>
<s> I mean disable them in the BIOS, not in Windows (Or at least, not just in Windows. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if disabling them just in Windows would help). </s>
<s> Disabling them in the BIOS should free up some resources (most notably, one or more IRQ's), which should then be available for the USB card to use. </s>
<s> If your problem is due to IRQ sharing or is in some other way related to a lack of resources, that may solve the problem. </s>
