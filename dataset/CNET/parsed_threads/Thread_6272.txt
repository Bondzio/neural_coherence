<s> So I recently upgraded my computer and I know for sure it meets a lot of the requirements for a lot of games, the minimum, some are maximum, but some of thse games still run slow. </s>
<s> I want to know why. </s>
<s> My computer meets the sysreq for Crysis but it only runs at 16 fps. </s>
<s> I have everything on low, and my resolution at 1024x768 Specs: Manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer INC. </s>

<s> Maybe the drivers for the devices are having a problem with the games. </s>
<s> The hardware appears to be adequate. </s>
<s> First one to try is the Graphics. </s>
<s> Go to the NVidia site and let the autocheck look at the video driver. </s>
<s> Since no mention of which OS, check on the motherboard drivers at the Asus site for drivers matching the OS installed. </s>
<s> If none of that helps, check on user forums for the games you play to see if others are having problems with the hardware you have in place. </s>
<s> I've lost count of poorly planned Windows installs. </s>
<s> How many times have you asked for the &quot;Install Plan&quot; and you read replies that are incomplete? </s>
<s> Get together with this machine's designer or vendor and make that plan. </s>

<s> I did this the other day, everything's up to date. </s>
<s> It's a recurring issue where I find folk forgetting some software that matters. </s>
