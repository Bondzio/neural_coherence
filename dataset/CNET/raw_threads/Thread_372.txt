(I would not like to overclock the CPU as I am not too savvy there as i could cause some serious harm to my system) I once used a diagnostics software called SiSandra or something similar and i think it had an option to use free RAM to help the CPU, but i'm not sure how i would go about it, What would you recommend for me to make use of the free RAM instead of the CPU sweating at 100% usage and the RAM lazing about, Many thanks in advance for any replies

When you start a new task, CPU will consume part of the resource to calculate and carry out this task. The best way is opening Task Manager and checking which process tie up too much resource. If anyone is useless at this time, you may close it.
