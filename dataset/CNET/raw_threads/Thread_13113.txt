I guess I decided that I had some money to waste or something so I upgraded it to 4GB (1x4) of 1066 MHz. I understand that with the limitations of a 32 bit operating system I won't get the full 4GB, but my RAM is downclocked from 1066 to 667. Why? I tried installing them all individually to make sure I didn't have a bad stick, and I even returned them and got a new batch, same deal. Any thoughts?

Ram described as 1066 means it is capable of running at that speed in a suitable MB not that it will run at that speed in any MB. There is a free application called cpuz-144 that will tell you what the bus frequency of your MB is, Ram rated speed should be equal to or greater than the bus speed of the MB. HTH
