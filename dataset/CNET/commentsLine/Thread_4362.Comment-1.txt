i know similar questions have been posted, buy my situation is a little different, so i will explain it here.
a couple of days ago, i had a new wireless home security system installed.
with it, they provided a new router (d-link dir-601), replacing an existing linksys e-3000 that i owned.
this didn't hurt my feelings because i was having major issues with the e-3000 and was going to replace it anyway.
as a part of the security system set-up, they had to assign a new ip address to the router (192.168.36.1) so all of the home security components can access it.
as i said, i planned on replacing the linksys - and in fact had ordered a new asus rt-n56u dual band the day before.
i like the dual band capabilities because of all of the streaming devices that are used in my house (x-box, tv's, netflix, etc).
well, it arrived today and i want to install it.
my question is.....how do i make the asus my primary router for all of my computers and multimedia components, but still use the d-link with it's ip address for my home security network.
we are totally wireless (no hardwired connections) with only 1 dsl line.
any help is greatly appreciated.
