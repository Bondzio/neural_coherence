My friend has a Lynksys model #WPC11 ver. 3 PC card in a Toshiba laptop connected to a Linksys 2.4 GHz.802.11b router. Youtube stuff stutters and jerks when it tries to play. The router is connected to Comcast cable in an urban area. Where can I get up to speed (heh) on the new technologies, like g and N? Any web sites or info would be very much appreciated. Thanks.!

A test: Disable the wireless adapter and connect the laptop to the router with a standard network patch cable. Does the problem persist? What's the model number of your Toshiba laptop? What OS are you running? To learn about wireless standards and speeds, try the websites for the major wireless router makers: Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, etc.
