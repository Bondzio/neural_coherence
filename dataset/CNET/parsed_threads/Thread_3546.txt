<s> Whenever I start my computer the everything (except the small fan on the motherboard itself, that hasn't worked for a while though) starts up like normal for about 3 seconds. </s>
<s> Then it all shuts back off. </s>
<s> The first time this happened I played with the battery on the motherboard a little bit and after that the computer went back to working, but only half the time. </s>
<s> I decided that it was the battery so I bought a new one and put it in and then the computer started up fine ~5 times. </s>
<s> Now (after going ~8 hours off) it's doing the same thing it did before. </s>
<s> Anyone know what this is? </s>
<s> Bad motherboard? </s>
<s> Hi John, If, by &quot;the small fan on the motherboard&quot;, you mean the fan on the CPU heatsink, you are heading for a burn-up. </s>
<s> That fan MUST start with the computer power-up, and MUST run all the time, to keep the CPU temperature in limits. </s>
<s> It sounds as though the motherboard or CPU overheat protection is shutting down your machine to prevent the CPU from cooking. </s>

<s> Here's my mobo: http://home.comcast.net/~johngafnea/board.jpg The CPU heatsink (located bottom left corner) works fine. </s>
<s> The small black plastic fan (a little bit left of center) is the one that isn't working (and hasn't been for a while). </s>
<s> I guess I'll try to get some more fans going in my room. </s>
<s> Thats the chipset fan - the motherboard will automatically power down when it detects that the fan isn't running - just use a CPU fan(if u have one spare - it'll require some creative mounting). </s>
<s> That fan was there because the chip could be damaged by overheating. </s>
<s> You just let it go and that may have resulted in the chip burning up. </s>
<s> While you can replace that fan, it is more likely you have a damaged chip and a new fan won't help at all. </s>
<s> Replace that chipset fan, NOW. </s>
<s> If you're lucky you'll be able to continue on. </s>
<s> If damage has already been done, it will continue to shutdown but at longer intervals before doing so even with a working fan. </s>
<s> Otherwise damage is too great and time to pitch the mtrbd. </s>
<s> in the trash. </s>
<s> Let it be a lesson not to be repeated. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Okay I replaced the chipset fan and that immediately fixed the problem. </s>
<s> Now though it's going back to doing what it was doing...about half the time. </s>
<s> What's weird is if I unplug all drives, then it starts up fine everytime (althought obviously it tells me no drives are found). </s>
<s> Would this indicate a power problem? </s>
<s> As everyone has been saying...your failure to fix your fan when it first quit has PROBABLY damaged your motherboard. </s>
<s> So...get ready to say goodby to it. </s>
<s> BUT BEFORE YOU DO...download a freeway MB diagnostic program (Use TUCOWS as a source) and find out for use what is working and what is not. </s>
<s> Perhaps you have laying around somewhere the install/driver CD that came with your motherboard/computer. </s>
<s> The manufacturer may have included a diagnostic program on that CD for just such a time like this. </s>
<s> Check it out. </s>
<s> God's Speed! </s>
