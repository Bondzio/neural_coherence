i had the original xp cd without the service packs.
i slipstreamed sp2 into the windows installer then burned it again.
after booting from the cd i pushed &quot;enter&quot; to do a clean install, as opposed to &quot;r&quot; for a recovery.
at the point where i was to select where to install windows, i selected the c drive, which had been newly formatted the maxtor utility.
the installation showed that i had lots of unpartitioned space on the e drive.
i installed windows on the c drive, letting windows format the drive.
when the install was complete, i went to my computer and found a 128 gb drive that was unformmattted.
i loaded knoppix, which found all of my data just fine.
is there a program out there (preferably freeware) that can recreate the file table i am assuming was deleted?
or make windows read the files on the drive?
