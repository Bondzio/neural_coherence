but i'm worried about support for the optical drive.
this means you won't get driver updates and that might bite you later.
going to 1gb of memory is a good idea.
i'd get a pair of 512s in a pack.
paired sticks are tested and selected for how close their specs are.
this way you won't have one stick's operations running against the other.
makes for smoother operating.
take the 80gig and turn it into an external drive.
i don't like running backup drives in the same system.
you burn up a motherboard and both drives could cook as well.
i'm also biased against maxtor drives, but, hey, that's just me.
you now have a good solid system that should serve you well for the next couple of years, or until you get the dual-core bug!
enjoy!
and life goes on... jack
