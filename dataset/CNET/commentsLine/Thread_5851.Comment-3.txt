thank-you for your reply.
if you are inferring that i should have backed up the dvd.
yeah!
i know that it would have been a good idea to have 2 copies of the dvd but i didn't.
i did try isobuster and it merely reported that the dvd was a blank disk.
it is my understanding that (on a hard drive) even if the file allocation table is damaged or erased that a disk recovery tool can restore files.
i'm assuming that something like that happened to my dvd-rw.
are there any other ideas?
