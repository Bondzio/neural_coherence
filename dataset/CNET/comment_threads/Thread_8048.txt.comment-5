It's worth thinking about what resolution your monitor is (and therefore the resolution you will be aiming to run games at) as well as what games you are likely to play.
Take a look at some benchmarks at places like tomshardware to help you choose the right graphics card for your budget and needs.
http://howtoinstallagraphicscard.blogspot.com/ has some brief advice about choosing a graphics card and how to install a graphics card if you fancy taking a look.
Generally speaking I think the ati radeon 5 series have been well received, however the 5750 is somewhat underpowered for many games and higher resolutions.
Hope that is some help!
