Unfortunately, the Asus doesn't have USB ports, which I definitely want, b/c I need USB for mobile broadband.
So, it's out.
I ended up buying a &quot;Superpad&quot; on Amazon for $199, more as an experiment as anything.
It got mixed reviews, but I thought, what the heck :-)Can always send it back.
Thx J
