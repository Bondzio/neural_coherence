1.1.1	Hi everyone i need help choosing an antenna , im looking a directional antenna for a project .	St
1.1.2	So far i found an antenna : http : //www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.37185 But im not sure about the quality of the antenna so im asking you guys .	St
1.1.3	Also i would like to know how much range i can look at with a 20dBm transmitter and a 36Dbm/4W Amplifier .	St
1.1.4	( Transmitter - & gt ; Amplifier - & gt ; Antenna ) .	St
1.1.5	Also if someone knows a better alternative it would be great .	St
1.1.6	Thank you in advance .	St
1.1.7	enkm	St
1.2.1	You can tell by the slick design that much of the effort went into the plastic artwork .	St
1.2.2	Great looking is your tipoff that they may have shortchanged the antenna work .	St
1.2.3	This area is when ugly beats pretty every time .	St
1.2.4	Look up the CANTENNA as a fine example .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	the cantenna is thick and big , i need something thin that i can put on my project enclosure , it has to be lighter than lets say 200-500 grams , and as small as possible with at least 6+ dBi .	St
1.3.2	Im pretty sure you are right and this antenna is cheap and a piece of garbage but i could n't find a better alternative , you might .	St
1.3.3	Thank you for your reply and i hope that someone will have a solution to my problem .	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	Why not try it ?	Ques
1.5.1	Well there is no problem with trying , but im a paranoid type and i always have to have a plan b , so if the antenna is not 10dBi or close , i need to know that i have an alternative at any given situation .	St
1.5.2	That antenna look like exactly something i need , im also looking into the option of just modifying that antenna .	St
1.5.3	Also im wondering about the radiation pattern of that antenna since there are no actual radiation pattern image i am wondering if i can contact the manufacturer .	St
1.5.4	Yet i cant find that antenna at their website , so im starting to wonder if it is actually their product .	St
1.5.5	Shady Stuff	St
1.6.1	edit - sorry there is a mixup of the websites .	Polite
1.6.2	the product is there , not much information is there anyway so we are waiting for someone who has that antenna to comment on its performance .	St
1.7.1	Why must it be exactly 9 or 10 dB ?	Ques
1.7.2	Something is not being told here .	St
1.7.3	If that performance is that important would n't we get out our RF NETWORK ANALYZER ( see http : //www.testequity.com/products/960/ ) and test this setup ?	Ques
1.7.4	Tipping my hand here .	St
1.7.5	I wrote software for antenna testing years ago and used this and other gear to test these things .	St
1.7.6	But at 10 bucks this is something you should just get and try .	Sug
1.7.7	It 's cheaper than time in the lab .	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
1.8.1	You sir are absolutely right , thank you for your help amd have a great week .	Polite
1.8.2	And for your question , one db is not much , but two , three db is almost and twice as weak signal .	St
1.8.3	im trying to establish a long range tunnel to connect to a device wireless , which is why i need the best focusing antenna i can get my hands on , one that is portable .	St
