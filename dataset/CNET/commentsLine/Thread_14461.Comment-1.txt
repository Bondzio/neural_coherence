first off,specs: athlon xp 2400+ epox 8k5a2+ geforce nvidia 7600gs agp powermagic 350w ps sony dru-84a dvd-burner cd-4x4x32 cd-burner at the moment, i'm back to xp pro sp3.
i ran for about 2yrs on xp with 1gb of pc2100 ddr dimms configured so:1x512mb/pc2100_2x256mb/pc2100 and xp was happy.
i installed vista ultimate and it grunted a bit so i ordered a 1gb pc2100 chip online.
it arrived and i installed it.
configuration is now this:1gb 1st bank-512mb 2nd bank-256mb 3rd bank.
now to the techy stuff.
during the day, my machine would die.
no warning, no shutting down, dead.
sometimes it would boot right back up, sometimes not.
when it wouldn't, the post codes would not read either.
my best guess was (with my limited knowlege) was it had to be memory related.
i pulled both the 256mb chip and the 512mb chip then booted to a disk with windows memtest v3.3.
all tests passed.
(i think this problem was just poor contact with one or more of the chips.)
fired vista up, and ran everest ultimate.
surprise!!

the epox mobo will only support up to pc2700.
xp pro sp3 is running fat an sassy on this 1gb pc3200.
how?
was the combination of pc3200 and pc2100 the problem?
is leaving this pc3200 chip in going to be a problem?
