http://www.anandtech.com/guides/showdoc.aspx?i=3497&p=5 btw, $2000 builds a high-end pc... you can have a great gamer for far less.
you could build a core i7, but i wouldn't recommend it for a first-time builder since the mobos are still a bit finicky.
here's a $1,600 build with a fast quad core, 4gb ram, dual 640gb hard drives, blu-ray drive, radeon hd 4870 1gb, xonar audio, wireless mouse/keyboard, and a 23&quot; monitor.
basically everything but speakers.
mobo: ASUS P5Q SE/R, $100 cpu: Intel Core2Quad Q9550, 2.83ghz quad core, $280 ram: G.Skill 2x2GB DDR2-800, CL4, $50 video: XFX Radeon HD 4870, 1GB, $220 audio: ASUS Xonar audio, pci-express, $90 hd: 2xWestern Digtial Caviar Green 640GB HD, $140 optical: LG GGC-H20L, BluRay/HD-DVD reader, DVD burner, retail, $120 cpu cooler: asus v60, $40 case: Antec 900, $110 power supply: Corsair 650W, 80plus, $100 kb/mouse: Microsoft Wireless Laser 5000, $40 os: vista premium 64bit, $100 monitor: Acer X233Hbid LCD, $210 intel matrixraid will allow you to setup the dual hard drives as a 100GB mirrored C: drive and a 1TB striped D: drive.
if you want more gaming horsepower, a geforce gtx 285 is another $120.
