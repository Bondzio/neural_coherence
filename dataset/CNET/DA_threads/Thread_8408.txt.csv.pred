1.3.1	You can just go to Display - & gt ; Settings , and it should list the model there .	St
1.4.1	Start & gt ; Ctrl Panel & gt ; Display & gt ; Advanced & gt ; Adapter if you just goto Settings it sometimes does not list the actual adapter , especially if it 's not using it 's own drivers also , if you need an upgrade suggestion please list what your possibly needing to upgrade for ... but w/o even looking at it , i 'd suggest the GeForce 6600 AGP ( not the GT )	St
1.5.1	Download either Belarc advisor or Aida , run them from a floppy and find out everything about your computer .	St
