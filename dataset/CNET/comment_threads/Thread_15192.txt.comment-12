For a resolution at or above 1280*1024 (most LCD's) you need at least a 7600GT or ATI based X1650XT -- preferably a 7950GT nVIDA based card (BFG card) or ATI X1950 Pro or XT to run any intensive flight sim at respectable frame rates -- you can get away with a 7600GT or X1650XT for lower budgets if you're using a CRT wherer you can scale resolutions anytime you want from 800*600 to 1600*1200 at a 5:4 ratio.
Most LCD's are 1280*1024 or above and need to be run at the native resolution only to avoid scaling issues.
Lower end but doable http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143049 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102068 Higher end and better http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143070 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814131027 Yet a bit higher and much better http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143071
