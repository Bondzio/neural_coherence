Thanks for all the help guys.
I checked the fan again, and it turns out that the fan itself is not making the noises.
You see, the fan is screwed to the top grill of the casing, when the fan rotates, the &quot;grill&quot; makes the noise, not the fan.
The fan is screwed to the grill, now i've tried tightening the screws but it didn't help.
I don't think theres any simple way to solve this problem.
what can I do, the grill is fixed, doesn't have any other screws, and it makes noise when the fan is on......any ideas??
Thanks once again.
