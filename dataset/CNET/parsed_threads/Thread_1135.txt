<s> I bought this hard drive to back up my family's 8 years worth of photos for safe keeping. </s>
<s> Only 3 days later the drive crashed. </s>
<s> I've contacted Toshiba and no matter what, they wont stand behind their product. </s>
<s> Below are the responses I get from them... Hello, Unfortunately, I cannot help you on this matter. </s>
<s> Please Contact my Supervisor for any concerns. </s>
<s> Sholeen Chaudhary Toshiba OA Dept Supervisor schaudhary@pcs-sj.com (510)651-6798 Dear Customer, Toshiba is not liable for any loss data. </s>
<s> You will need to take it to a data recovery center to have your data removed. </s>
<s> Regards, Sholeen Chaudhary Toshiba OA Dept Supervisor schaudhary@pcs-sj.com (510)651-6798 i understand their &quot;liability&quot; issue...all I'm asking them is for some help. </s>
<s> I have no back ups. </s>
<s> I have no other way to retrieve these pictures. </s>
<s> I have my baby's photos, Christmas's, Soccer games, everything...I don't know what else to do. </s>
<s> I don't have the money to take it to a recoverey center. </s>
<s> i just want my pictures back. </s>
<s> I wish I would have backed them up on CDs or something, but I thought an external drive would work best...man was I mistaken. </s>
<s> I've tried everything...any advice from anyone?? </s>
<s> I will never buy another Toshiba product again. </s>
<s> If I can steer one person away from them as well, so be it. </s>
<s> What happen to customer service? </s>
<s> They should replace the drive. </s>
<s> That's what they make and will usually make good on that. </s>
<s> You have the data. </s>
<s> It is your data, not theres and you must safeguard it with a backup plan. </s>
<s> -&gt; Let's go over a good backup plan. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> 3 copies. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A copy away from the other 2 copies. </s>
<s> If you decide not to maintain backups this is your choice. </s>
<s> -&gt; Let's note a fine company that you can talk to next -&gt; http://www.drivesavers.com In closing, read that warranty again. </s>
<s> It does not cover any data loss. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry about your loss. </s>
<s> Never have only ONE copy of anything stored digitally if at all possible. </s>
<s> I have so many photos that I could not keep them all on my laptop. </s>
<s> Moved them to two different external drives, so there are two copies. </s>
<s> One of the drives is portable and I carry to work each day...just per chance something happens at home. </s>
<s> Next step is to burn to DVDs...over 50 gb of data, so that will be at least 10-12 full DVD-Rs. </s>
<s> But after hearing your story and others, I'm going to spend the time doing just that. </s>
<s> Of course, the DVDs have a shelf life too! </s>
<s> As to Toshiba's liability: I'm afraid that no drive maker eve warranties against loss of data, only the repair/replacement of the hardware. </s>
