i'd like to know what i need to do to wire my home.
i'd like each room of my house to have an ethernet jack where i can plug into my local network and connect to the internet.
a standard router only has 4 ports and i need many more ports (i.e.
20) than that.
a switch has many more ports, but i've read that switches are only good to connect to a network; they aren't good to connect the devices to the internet.
my internet comes from a cable modem.
ideally i would like to connect all the wires to a central (1000mbps capable) switch/hub/router in my basement (so all the wires are kept out of sight).
whatever is used as the central hub, i'd like to connect my cable modem to that device.
(i don't want to use a computer has a gateway.)
i'd also like to make sure my wireless router (used for my laptop and other wireless devices) is kept on the 1st floor for easy access and better reception.
so what combination of routers, hubs, switches, cable modem, etc do i need to wire my home?
p.s.
the wired devices i would like to connect are: 2 or more desktop computers, 2 networked hdhomerun dual tv tuners (potentially more), printers, game consoles, media center extenders, internet capable tvs potentially in the future, maybe a home server in the future, possibly more devices that have yet to be created at this time.
thanks in advance for the help.
