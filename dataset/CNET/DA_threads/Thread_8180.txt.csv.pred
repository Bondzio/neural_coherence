1.3.1	This may sound stupid but whats a USB Wifi device and a PCI Wifi card ?	Ques
1.3.2	Is it a card that picks up he internet .	St
1.3.3	And could you help me with my post at Desktops .	St
1.4.1	It 's my choice not to duplicate web content .	St
1.4.2	Your answer was in the website noted .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	The difference is the connection .	St
1.5.2	Both are Wifi .	St
1.5.3	USB Wifi connects to the USB port of your computer , ( any computer that has a USB port - like a laptop or a desktop ) PCI Wifi is a PCI interface board , that plugs into any open PCI slots of your computer , which usually rules out a laptop ( unless you have a laptop docking station that provides PCI slots for you ) .	St
1.5.4	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - For the portability you should go with the USB , but that means it is one more thing you need external to your PC .	St
1.5.5	Most times that USB device can pull power from that USB connection ( another point , if on a laptop , that is going to be one more drain on your laptop batteries ) .	St
1.5.6	For the convenience when connecting to a desktop the PCI Wifi might be the way to go .	St
1.5.7	The caution here , though , is the the antenna , which is usually on the metal back-plate of the PCI card , might not have the range or position to get the best signal from your wireless access point ( probably your router ) .	St
1.5.8	Check out your options , on that website that Bob mentioned .	St
1.5.9	Good luck .	Polite
