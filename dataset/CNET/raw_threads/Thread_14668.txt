You made a bad post since there is no make, model to work with. But it's a common issue and you'll find other posts like yours. Try this, what does Crucial.com tell us about your supported memory? Bob PS. Yes you wrote hp presario but without the model number...

To answer your question, try entering the bios and reset it to &quot;defaults&quot; and reboot. If it works then, then re-enter(if needed) and reset any bios setting that reflect the old ones and reboot once saved. Make darn sure the ram was supported by HP support webpage specs, as I said, it can be very specific and/or limited. tada -----Willy

When it comes to ram, systems tend to &quot;auto-configure&quot; and usually its right. Your ram together if 899mhz type isn't supported but can for one get going but when pushed fails. Return the ram and get the right ones. Ram may look the same, but the &quot;decals&quot; on the ram say what? Unless, you go beyond consumer labeling, look at the chips themselves, etc. you see a probable difference, if not then the real world experience has failed you, return them. tada -----Willy
