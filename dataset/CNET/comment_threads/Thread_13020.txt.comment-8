If you bought a SCSI drive because you wanted the higher speed the drive provides you are not going to get it unless you spend some more money.
You are going to need a WIDE SCSI 2 controller that will cost more than an IDE drive to get this drive to work at optimal speed.
Do you want to run, ro do you want it to run right?
