Google maps might be a better tool to use than Google Earth. It clearly shows roads. Indeed, companies like TomTom and Nokia and Mio make such devices and such programs. But I think their own databases, not Google's. That's rather expensive, maintaining your own world-wide database of streets. For a start: read http://www.devx.com/wireless/Article/39239/1954 Kees
