1.1.1	I am currently have and am using a Free Agent Desk 500GB External Hard drive with a speed of 7200 .	St
1.1.2	I was thinking of purchasing the WD My Passport Hard Drive 250GB which is only $ 29.99 at Target and was wondering how reliable they are compared to the Free Agent drives .	St
1.1.3	I know that it 's has a slower speed but I like the fact that it 's USB powered vice A/C/ and is extremely small .	St
1.1.4	I 'm just going to be using this as a backup for my MP3 files .	St
1.1.5	Also , if someone knows of another good USB powered hard drive please let me know .	St
1.2.1	They are OK and quite a good idea as a backup copy ( but never as & quot ; storage & quot ; )	St
1.3.1	Thanks again for the reply !	St
