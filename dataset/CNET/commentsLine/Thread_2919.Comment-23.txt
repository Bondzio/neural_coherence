the first time was a hardware malfunction.
i noticed the drive making extra noises but was able to make a full backup of all my data (which i was not doing regularly).
whew!
the second was when i got up from the dining room table, caught my foot on my notebook's power cord and sent it crashing to the hardwood floor.
the computer would not power up, but upon replacing it and plugging in the damaged drive as an external one, it turned out that only some sectors were bad and i was able to recover most of my data, which, again was not recently backed up.
whew!
now, with external drives as cheap as they are and the cost of data recovery so high, i have a couple of external backups and also archive everything that will no longer be modified, such as original photos and ripped music (i back up all my cds), onto discs (two copies in the case of photos).
