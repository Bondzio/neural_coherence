<s> Hello everybody, n00b here! </s>
<s> I've been having a very annoying problem with my computer lately, and I'm hoping someone here might be able to help. </s>
<s> Basically I have an Emprex-make DVD Rewriter in my computer (running Win XP Pro), and I never used to have any trouble with it. </s>
<s> However, a few months ago I installed Norton Systemworks/Antivirus 2006, and ever since then there's been some serious rebooting issues. </s>
<s> From what I can gather, it only seems to happen when I put in a CD-R/DVD-R (whether blank or already written onto), &quot;commercial&quot; discs seem to work fine. </s>
<s> Occasionally it may read as normal and I can use it, but more often than not the computer will just reboot itself as soon as I put the disc in. </s>
<s> It will continue rebooting until I take the disc back out. </s>
<s> I don't know if the Norton programs are the cause for any of this, but it has only been happening since they were installed. </s>
<s> Would anybody have any suggestions or advice on why this is happening and how it might be solved? </s>
<s> I'm happy to supply any other system specs if necessary. </s>
<s> Any assistance is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> DF </s>
<s> Uninstall Norton. </s>
<s> That will tell you if it indeed is causing the problem. </s>
<s> It sounds unlikely but one cannot be sure until you try it. </s>
<s> If that does not cure it, then you have to look further. </s>
<s> My guess is that it is something else. </s>
<s> Maybe an update somewhere. </s>
