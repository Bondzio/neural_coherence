<s> this pc is my homebuilt one, mutt parts, core of the system is an amd athlon something or other. </s>
<s> is this a power supply problem? </s>
<s> my pc was doing some video processing, and it locked up, which hasnt happened in a very long time. </s>
<s> i power it down. </s>
<s> i power it up right away, the fans start spinning etc, but it dies immediately, like a car that wont start. </s>
<s> tried it again, same result. </s>
<s> unplugged all the perifs, powered up, and it seemed to run fine. </s>
<s> i put my hand behind the power supply on the back of the tower, and i notice a lot of heat coming out, beyond what i would expect normally i think. </s>
<s> time for a new power supply or possibly something else? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>

<s> ive had this computer for years. </s>
<s> this is not a new computer problem. </s>
<s> but, there is a new problem, and that is the strange amount of heat coming from the power supply. </s>
<s> is this what power supplies usually do when they need to be replaced? </s>
<s> Nothing lasts forever and you're already dealing with old parts. </s>
<s> If you have an &quot;under-powered PSU&quot; it will eventually die. </s>
<s> It may also become stressed just by wear&tear as heat is a culprit all too often in these cases. </s>
<s> Just consider you got your money's worth. </s>
<s> Replace the PSU or any other part as necessary. </s>
<s> If you feel the PSU is putting out too much heat, then replace it will fry itself and *maybe* take something else with it, if not already. </s>
<s> You have an iffy situation where all items together cause a problem, thus test elsewhere alone. </s>
<s> Let's not forget that a possible &quot;bad caps&quot; can be had if poor power was at fault or the famous bad caps manufacture. </s>

<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> is a basic method of solving problems on any type/age computer. </s>
<s> You want to find out what is causing the supply to shutdown or run hot. </s>
<s> If you want to see if the supply runs hot when not connected to anything. </s>
<s> Simply jumper the green wire on the connector that goes to the mobo to any of the black wires, and the supply should turn on [as noted by the fan turning][also tells whether the power switch is defective]and stay on as long as the jumper is present. </s>
<s> The supply will have no external load, and thus if it blows out hot air the supply itself is bad. </s>
