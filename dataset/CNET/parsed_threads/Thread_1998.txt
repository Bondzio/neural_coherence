<s> What is the best graphics card i can get for 100? </s>
<s> Or possibly 150? </s>
<s> Give the forum a list of what you can buy in your price range. </s>
<s> Not all the cards I can get, will be in your market at the price you might expect it to be. </s>
<s> Example, a 99U$D card may be double the exchange rate in you local market. </s>
<s> Next look to the VGACHARTS at http://www.tomshardware.com to see how your list fared. </s>

<s> It's a toss up between an ATI 9600 xt for around 100 or at a stretch (money-wise) an NVIDIA 6600GT AGP for around 150 </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/hardnews/20041111_132053.html seems to note the R4xx ATI chips to be the competitor to the 6600GT. </s>
<s> A very nice card. </s>
<s> Compare with http://www6.tomshardware.com/mobile/20040203/ to see if benchmarks help you decide. </s>
<s> Both cards should be fine for most games. </s>
