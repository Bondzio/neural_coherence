9739	0	246227	2478212	NR	MO FO	5/4/07 6:57 PM	1.17830502E12	am I nuts?	I've been thinking for a while that I want a new computer.I started out just using my Dell Dimension 2400 for accounts, emails - just general clerical stuff but I've ended up getting into computer graphics,home video editing, webdesign and now I want to have a go at making some music on it so I need a lot more from it than I did when I got it. I checked out the usual first port of call for buying &quot;customised&quot; pcs on the internet and I found the limited options irritating. For a start I just bought a new external DVD/CD writer so really don't want to buy a new pc with one already in it but you don't get the option of not having one. So then I got to thinking how if I really wanted a pc to my own specifications I could build it myself. Can it be that hard? I don't think there's much chance of anyone talking me out of this and believe me my family have tried but maybe someone can come up with something more persuasive than &quot;you'll never do it&quot;.So here's basically what I would really appreciate from the experts here (bearing in mind I'm a total beginner at this) First off, please don't suggest I just buy a Mac. I don't want one.I'm allowing myself a budget of about 550 and I guess a sizeable chunk of that will go on the monitor. 1.What are the most common mistakes when people do this? How am I most likely to %@*& up? 2.The first thing I'm looking at is the cases.Any tips on choosing one? I'm not interested in loads of flashing lights and sci-fi looking designs, I just want something sturdy and practical...and affordable 3. Well that will do for a start............

Second, to do most things with graphics is extremely difficult to do much inexpensively as graphics is the main factor in pushing up prices on a PC. The best way to approach this is you have to know what software you want to run and what you want to do as the software will tell you the minimum requirements. Take into consideration the Operating System that it's going to need as it has a whole set of requirements all it's own. When you get done with these issues, it now comes to hardware issues like a monitor, storage and drives with memory requirements. This isn't much of an answer but youer question does invoke me to ask these questions to get a proper response

It takes away all the scary Voodoo effect that Pc's have with some peope. its not hard. 1) A million places on the net will tell you how to Build a Pc. Print the info and your in bizz. my 2nd Advice is -- Take a few weeks to read up on these tutorials. AND most of dont be scared, nothing to be scared of. 3rd -- if your into vid editing/Music ect -- read on the web what other people use for Hardware, there are tons of Forums/sites that are directly related to this topic. 4th -- Always Use Newegg.com to buy your stuff. 5th - Ive been building computers fooorrr 15 yrs or so, so if you need help send me an email with the topic Help me build pc or whatever. I'll help you.

I'm not unsure, that's partly why I posted the query, I have a tendancy to jump in at the deep end with stuff.I'm sure I want to do this and maybe someone can give me a sensible reason why I shouldn't. Part of the problem with asking for advice is not knowing which questions need asking or even having the vocabulary to ask them.I have an aversion to manuals and have learned most of what I know how to do by trial and error.It's no good telling me this is a bad attitude, I already know that but thanks for pointing out what you need to know before you can offer advice. I already use Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Illustrator, Nero and Roxio. I am a perpetual noob but somehow manage to get by.I'm also exploring the possibilities for making music on the PC.Maybe I should get out more. The operating system I'm used to is XP. That's fine for me so far as I do actually use this thing primarily for running my business but part of the reason I want to get a new computer is that our old one is at the office.Its a crappy old thing with 2gb hard drive running win98. It definitely needs upgrading so we can have a broadband connection and install VOIP and generally do more stuff at the office instead of at home so my plan was to move this one there and get a better one for more general home + business use. So I'm thinking of going for Vista as an OS but am happy to stick with XP for the time being as I know all too well how long it took for XP to settle down after it was released. Moniter, probably a 19 inch flat LCD. I could do with freeing up some space on my desk.On second thoughts maybe I'd better budget seperately for the monitor. Hard drive, I only have 30gb on this one but with a 200gb external. I want 250gb on the new one. I have an external lacie dvd/cd writer, I'm not sure but I think I read somewhere I can take this out of its enclosure and install it as an internal one. I think that pretty much covers your questions.

9739	6	246227	2479248	2479275	MO FO	5/6/07 3:04 AM	1.17842064E12	yes	the exchange rate makes lots of stuff in the US really cheap at the moment if you buy it from the UK or if you actually go over there to buy it.For examle, the case I want is $40 dollars on newegg but it's about 40 in the UK so about half the price it is here and that's including VAT.I'm not sure about shipping costs from the states but shipping in general has never been cheaper.I'd be very surprised if it was going to cost the same to ship the stuff as it did to buy it but it becomes much more worthwhile if you buy stuff that costs more in the first place.A flat screen LCD monitor, for example, which is much cheaper there than here. The real problems are, can they be used here? I know some electrical goods just have a voltage swithch on the back so can be used internationally but what about stuff like monitors and PSUs? the other thing is taxes, would I get stuck with some sort of import duty?

Just check the model's specs. before you purchase. BE VERY CAREFUL to switch the PSU to the proper Voltage before connecting it. It's an expensive mistake when we forget to do this. Heck--to be safe, switch it to the proper input Voltage when you take it out of the box.

Make sure the number of pins on the PSU matches the power connector on the motherboard. These days, it's a 20- or 24-pin connector. Get a PSU with a 20 +4-pin connector to cover both types. PSU's with one 120mm fan are usually quieter.

XP is still the O/S of choice for music. Also inexpensive hardware or packaged systems (all on the motherboard etc.) usually don't function well as recording systems. Latency is an issue and bus/irq conflicts often happen. Video is a non-issue for music, but memory, bus speed, sound cards, USB and firewire support are. If this is truly a direction you intend to go do some research and visit some audio forums. Hope that helps for that piece of your decision making.

I would have to say people rush into it. Meaning you try to build the computer in a hurry. You well have to realize you need to take your time. If you arent sure about something then stop and dont try to guess. The only other thing I have heard of is watch out for static. Just make sure you ground yourself plenty of times. Also, like others suggested, find a good tutorial on how to build a computer. See if you are up to the task. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2.The first thing I'm looking at is the cases. Any tips on choosing one? I'm not interested in loads of flashing lights and sci-fi looking designs, I just want something sturdy and practical...and affordable. For a Sturdy case people like steal but weighs a ton. The only thing I suggest is what you want your case to do? Do you want the case to come with a power supply or not. For my first build I got the Power supply built onto it because I didnt want to mess with it. You can go either way. The other thing to look for is front ports that come on cases. Usually there are couple of USB ports, maybe some Audio and Firewire. See if that is important to you. I guess you have done things inside a computer before? Install a PCI Card? Put more Ram in? Really you need to feel comfortable working inside a computer. This is how I would start. First decide what Processor you want. Either Intel or AMD. Both have pros and cons. Go to Tomshardware.com for help. You want to get at least dual core but Quad Core (which costs more) is starting to become popular. A lot of graphic/video editing programs take advantage of Quad Core. Second is Motherboard. Depending on which processor you go with, you have to get a motherboard that supports that processor. Then you just want to check for what added features the motherboard has. How much Ram does it support. How many USB ports, does it doe Firewire? Most of this is the same with most motherboards but you might find some features you like more then others. I usually look at what other people are using and see if it fits my needs. Third. Probably RAM. The only thing to look for here is what RAM is compatible with your Motherboard. Usually if you go to the Motherboard manufactures website (or the Chip Set that is used on the motherboard) they list what type of RAM is good for your Motherboard. Four Hard Drive. Really this just deals with Size, how big of Hard Drive you want. Right now you probably well get a SATA drive. CD/DVD drive. I think you might have to get a CD drive just to install Windows with. Most of these arent that big of different. Usually the faster is better, but costs a little more. Most burners are under $50 now. Graphic Card. The newer cards are amied at gaming but the extra power never hurts with other video editing tasks. Again there is really only two companies to choose from. http://ati.amd.com/ http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html Just go through there site and look at there Media type cards. Usually the more RAM you get on the card the better it well be. Its really just how much your budget can afford. Also make sure you get a PCIexpress 16 speed. This is the fastest type of cards now. Also the type of Graphic Card you get determines how much Power you need. Last would be either a Modem, or wireless card, or however you connect to the internet. Newegg.com is a good place to get reviews of products, but they arent always the lowest price. Once you find what you want shop around. Make sure the website/company has been around then more then just a year.

But, that said, understand a few things: 1. You won't save any money (although you may get a somewhat better -- or at least more &quot;customized&quot; -- system for about the same money) 2. There are real pitfalls if you don't know what you are doing Let's talk about the 2nd point first: If you don't know what you are doing, you can make major mistakes in buying the wrong components, in assembling the hardware or in installing the operating system. All it takes is something like not knowing how to install the &quot;thermal solution&quot; (heatsink/fan) to destroy a $300 CPU, or not knowing about &quot;F6 drivers&quot; or &quot;chipset drivers&quot; to keep your system from working right (or at all). Because of this, I usually recommend that people who are doing this for the first time only proceed if they have access to help both before they order all of the components, and after the assembly, if things don't go well. It's not uncommon to build a new system, turn it on and ... NOTHING. It happens to experienced builders from time to time (say 5% to 20% of the time), but if it happens to someone who doesn't know what they are doing, it can turn into a real nightmare. In most cases, most people will do as well ordering a custom configured system from Dell, but if you want to build a system from scratch, do some research, talk to people, line up your resources and go ahead.

Yes, there will be tons of web sites to guide you through building your first PC, but make shure that you get the right components, and follow the guides. you can build a great pc within your budget, and I 100% agree with one of the other replies, SHOP NEWEGG.COM ! I've built tons of PCs myself and newegg.com is great for getting me what I need, at the best price. I suggest you get a Core 2 Duo PC with atleast 2GBs of ram. And also I suggest you throw away that old external drive and pick up a pair of DVD burners, since they're dirt cheap now. Oh, and go get your self a 400GB hard drive, since anything lower is not worth the price.

I'm disabled and after buying two pc's I decided I wanted something much better. I first decided on the motherboard from asus and now have a AMD 4600+ dual core proccessor with 2GB ram. Then purchased a great case suitable for the motherboard, then using the hard drive from my previous pc 160 GB and also added another 80 GB and 500 GB drive. With the help of my younger brother we had it built in a few hours running xp though I now use vista ultimate and I love it. I will never buy a new pc again. So, I would say &quot;go for it&quot;. I'm sure you will be glad you did.

When designing a purpose-built computer, start with the components needed for the task it's being built for. If you want to do video, start with video boards. The case you stuff it into is secondary. I think you like the idea of a &quot;custom built&quot; computer, but have no real use for one. Just buy a name-brand compute with the stuff you need, then install new components -if- you need them. Building a computer from scratch is a good way to spend a lot of money on something you could have bought off-the-shelf, and it will be difficult to repair or expand because it's a mongrel.

But - having said that - you need to do a lot of research before you start, if you're not sure of your &quot;parts list&quot;. This is nothing to be taken lightly. I shop Tiger Direct. Not a &quot;plug&quot; for them, just simple advice in saying check the online store for parts. You'll save a Lot of money, and Tiger Direct is great about returns. With the &quot;barebones&quot; machines you can grab for a couple hundred and then customize, you may want to rethink a total build of your own. we have a two-computer household, both built completely by me with special interest abilities. You sound unsure of exactly what you want. Figure that out before taking another step or purchasing anything. The case is as good a place to start as any, but remember, it's not just the case. Plan for add-ons and expansion to save yourself regrets later. Remember one thing. Trying to stay ahead of technology is futile. Once you buy your parts, they'll probably be out of date by the time you get your machine put together. So - having said that - don't skimp by buying &quot;old&quot; technology or you may find yourself trapped in an out-dated machine.

I built a computer for myself. I used a lot of used parts from old computers from &quot;past lives&quot;. It works! Having given you that information, I will tell you that you probably want to make sure that the case you purchase has front usb, firewire, media card, etc. slots. Make sure that you get a case that has at least one external 5 1/4 bay and at least one external 3 1/2 bay still open after you have every device that you think you will ever want. You will be wanting to up grade this new computer a couple of times over it's lifetime. You can skimp on the physical box, but don't skimp too much on the motherboard and processor. Get a mid-line model or above. (remember, you will be wanting to upgrade soon.) Get all the memory that you can afford, but get it in one stick so you don't have to discard a stick or two when you want to upgrade. Get the absolutely fastest processor you can afford. (This is the costliest upgrade. Try to do that one piece right the first time.) I am living proof that it doesn't take a &quot;Philadelphia Law Degree&quot; to build your own computer. Common folks can do it. Good Luck.

(As well as many other sources that I don't know about.) These and the websites of the component suppliers were the source of my reference and training materials. (also my personal preferences as component suppliers.)

He actually got it to boot and run successfully. Then he began to experience serious errors of the worst kind. The system would simply hang after an hour or so of use. It wouldn't shut down, it would not reboot, it wouldn't even give the blue screen of death, or a system dump. It would simply hang. We took the PC to a local repair shop where they ran it for days without a problem. Their diagnosis? Dirty power. So we bought an above-average power conditioner (even though no other PCs in my home have a problem), and it seemed to be ok for awhile, but then the problem returned. Remember that there is no manufacturer to call for warranty protection, nor a service contract where we could walk-in and return it. We let the system sit for a year, in a growing computer museum in my home, and then I decided I would like to use it again. So I took it to another computer repair operation (inside a national big-box electronics chain) and 3-weeks later they told me the problem was with the cache on the hard disk drive. They suggested replacing the drive, which I did. To make a long story short, I replaced the drive, got the system to boot once, and then I could not even get it past the system configuration menu. I have been using PCs for years - computers for even longer - and am quite capable of swapping most parts and diagnosing system problems. But this PC has me stumped because I simply don't have enough time to &quot;take it to the next level&quot; of worrying about motherboard jumpers, clock speeds, and I don't own an oscilliscope. So, you can do it, if your eyes are wide open. But be prepared to spend the time. If you have the interest, I am sure with help you could diagnose issues, and solve them. But if you end up in a situation like mine where the system simply doesn't work, and every trip to the repair shop is a minimum flat $65 (or more), then the economics don't make sense. I am now cannibalizing the parts (RAM, HDD, DVD, and probably the case), and selling them on eBay. I bought a new laptop for myself.

Any person who wants to have total control on things he buys with his budget to get maximum benifits and does not depend on mass produced, run of the mill branded items that sell only on strength on their brand names, is not a nut. He is a person to be admired and respected. Even if he is assembling a PC from retailed peripherals. Nearly two decades back from now, when IBM clones using Intel 286/386 processors and PC AT/XT platforms with combined ISA and PCI architecture mainboards, American brands like Compaq, Dell, HP, Tulip and Europian brands like Siemens-Nixdorf and Olivetti were the centre of attraction in every PC market of India, my company wanted to switch to a client-server network from the existing IBM mainframe system using Sun Solaris to bring in Windows 95 and Novell Netware. The choice was a line of Proliant servers by Compaq and Olivetti client desktops. These things were really very very expensive then. I as an employee could not afford a home PC at the price of these desktops. When time began to test and take its toll, the Modi-Olivetti PCs started malfunctioning within a semester of installation. The Compaq Proliant server however remained a sturdy and reliable machine, thanks to it's build quality. The repairs carried out by the resellers made me curious of the parts being replaced and as a commercial manager passing the bills, I discovered that non of the replaced high cost parts were of Olivetti make! They were rather cheap and mass imported Chinese peripherals that the entire Olivetti and other branded machines were built on! Only the brand name Olivetti had eaten out our pockets clean and with very little value for money to offer. The company Modi-Olivetti Ltd., that had marketed these PCs went off the Indian market in 2 years' time. I then got hold of a very simple but educative book called &quot;Assembling and maitaining PCs for Dummies&quot; from IDG International USA. This book with its humourous instructions taught me to buy parts within my budget and assemble a home PC for myself with better features than my office's branded machines. Since then I have not purchased a branded PC.

All the parts you choose must be compatible with each other. Second - Is a warranty important to you? Any of the parts you buy may come with a warranty but may not be honored if you did something wrong, or if something went wrong that may not be a manufacturing error. Third - Is it worth the effort? If you don't know what you're getting into, it could be quite frustrating and you may need somebody with konw-how to walk you through it. Fourth - Money... Some may argue a different point, but it may cost you more to build your own than to buy a new one. That depends on what parts you buy, the brand of parts, who you know, etc. If you can get good parts for a good price, go for it. But just like a car, It can cost much more to build one part-by-part than if you were just to buy a new one. Also, you will have to buy every little bit of software you want to install. that's actually where it can get a bit tricky. PROS You get exactly what you want if you put in the necessary research, work, and money. You can also get that if you go to Best Buy. You can choose what software goes on your computer and programs(viruses) like AOL, Norton, and other pre-installed &quot;trial&quot; versions of these program won't be there. You won't have to pay to continue using these teaser programs, you install what you want. Reliability. I cannot stress this enough. If you get the right mix of parts, your computer will be much more reliable and will be ten times as fast as a comparable model bought from the store. There are plenty of web sites that can guide you through the process of building your own machine. You

It is very easy to build your own computer, but it is really only useful if: 1) You have up hardware that you want to reuse 2) You have very specific design criteria 3) You need a hobby and want to learn more I use free versions of Linux in my machines (prefer MEPIS) and other freeware. I prefer them over MS programs anyway and I can alway leave them running without worrying about them crashing. Othewise if you just want a better media machine, then buy a MAC. It's not my opinion. I know video people that hate to do contract work for MS, because they can't use their MACs.

I dont mores the pitty! the short and sweet of it is&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a D 875PBZ AAC27087-208 intel MBoard. I can't tell if my specs will support an AGP x 8 video card upgrade or not. I take it that the aforementioned card will not go into a &quot;old&quot; PCI slot. Will that MB PCI take the new card. I have another posting with CNET that contains more computer info if this interests you any. Thanks in advance for your wisdom. PS WHat is the difference between an &quot;old&quot; PCI slot and one that is AGP compatible? I know I cant use an Express or X PCI Video card.... see I can read.
