Now i have read on the Epson website &quot;DO NOT USE THE CD THAT CAME WITH YOUR PRINTER!&quot; But they don't explain what to do if you HAVE done this! Anyone know how I can remove the old drivers and install the correct ones? Thanks in advance Martin

Now I boot safe mode, check that again and in the device manager and remove it if found. Finally with the printer unplugged I install the new drivers per Epson's notes. Bob

Trouble is Epson say &quot;plug the printer in and let the wizard automatically install from the internet&quot; But it never mentions the internet but just tries to reinstall the drivers that were previously installed!! Cheers
