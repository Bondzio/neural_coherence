i was wondering how much effect raises your ram does for your pc.
right now i have a 1 gb of pc2100 ddr.
my question is if i bought 2 sticks of dual channel ram at pc3200 ddr.
would it increase my speed by a large amount.
my specs 2.53 pentuim 1 gb ram 80 gb hard drive 480 power supply radeon 9800 pro
