So your informed help would be greatly apreciated. Kindest Regards Tony B.

Such are rarely needed for most of us. In fact, a new power supply with Watts to spare will cost much less than testing. Bob

LOL] You can probe the rear of the power connector on the mobo. The black leads are all common [ground in most peoples terms]. The main 5 volts is on pins 4 , 6, 19, and 20. The main [once] 12 volts is on pin 10 [now there is also a separate 4 pin 12 volt connector, 2 pins 12 V and 2 Gnd, it is now spec'd to be provided by a separate set of rails in the supply]. The 3.3v is on pins 1,2, and 11. The pins run from 1 thru 10 down one side and 11 [next to 1] thru 20 down the other side. The 11 thru 20 side has 4 black wires the other row only 3 black wires. 5 volts are virtually always Red. Minus 12 and Minus 5 volts are virtually no longer used. Testing an ATX standalone means you have to learn how to turn the supply outputs on. Robert's link probably shows that.

Processor fan and other fans=+12 good. Hdd spins, Cdrom drive opens=+5 good. Need meter (Harbor Freight ~$5) for -5 -12 -3.3, which I have found burnt out a few times because the current rating is small. www.duxcw.com/faq/ps/ps4.htm is a link to describe the voltages of typical ATX supply.

That's the point of a voltmeter. The old D'Arsonvals were usually 10,000 OHMs per volt. Modern digital are multimegohm. Meter burnouts occur when one tries to measure 120 VAC when on an OHMs scale [does it every time].

6235	6	33616	390670	390042	reefurbb	8/21/04 5:36 AM	1.09306656E12	not the meter, the power supply	-12, -5 are rated at about 300-400ma, while other voltages are rated 5a-20a. The point being that the minus voltages can be easily burnt out. I don't think they have the same interupt as the + voltages do. Short out the +5v and the pwr supp will restart instead of burn out. Lightening or other way excessive surges can more easily burn out -voltages, as has been my experience.
