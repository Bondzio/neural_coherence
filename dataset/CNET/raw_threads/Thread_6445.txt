Adaptec USB2Xchange &quot;System Requirements: Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition, Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition, Microsoft Windows XP&quot; Considering that SCSI has been mainly a Mac thing, this looks like a major oversight. Unless a Mac would be intrisically compatible(?) Waiting for response from Adaptec.

To top it all off Apple didn't put USB 2.0 in the machines till recently. You can imagine how many would flame as they tried this on USB 1... or expect full support on MacOS. Bob
