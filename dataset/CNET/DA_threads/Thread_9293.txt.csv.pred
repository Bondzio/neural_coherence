1.1.1	Hi , I recently bought an expensive soundcard for my computer the Creative XFi Fatal1ty ... . i really really like the sound card ... .	St
1.1.2	But i noticed that i 'm not really making full use of the soundcard ... because it 's potential is limited by my old Altec lancing 151i I 'm deciding on buying good 5.1 or 7.1 speakers ... .	St
1.1.3	Since my soundcard has Coaxial output ... . Is it better to get Speakers that support Coaxial ?	Ques
1.1.4	My budget is around 400-600USD and I 'm currently looking at 1 .	St
1.1.5	The Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1 or the GMX D-5.1 2 .	St
1.1.6	The Logitech Z-5500 Digital 3 .	St
1.1.7	Creative Gigaworks S750 7.1 ?	Ques
1.1.8	( i dun really like this ) OR another way is to use Coaxial and put it through an amplifier and to a home theatre system Pls give me suggestions ... . it will be better if you can introduce better brands within my budget ...	St

1.1.10	However i watch really alot of movies.. and i really like surround sound ... .	St
1.1.11	I would also like to listen to songs in qualities that i 've never heard before ...	St
1.2.1	I could vouch for the Logitech Z-5500 5.1 They sound realy good and for the money you can not go wrong .	St
1.2.2	The Klipsch 7.1 would give you better surround sound than the 5.1 speaker system , But you have to have the extra buck for the Klipsch 7.1 .	St
1.2.3	Then it depends on how much space you have to place your speaker .	St
1.2.4	My computer room is around 10 foot by 12 foot almost square .	St
1.2.5	My Logitech Z-5500 & My Logitech Z-680 Sound good and give me good sound from each speaker .	St
1.2.6	I have them conected to my Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS Platinum .	St
1.2.7	I have two computer systems in my computer room .	St
1.2.8	Your system will be pumping with what ever off the three system you chose .	St
1.2.9	Good Luck Wendell H	St
1.3.1	i know that My room will be pumping with those ... . but i want 1 with superb quality ... .. some people says the logitech is better than the klipsch or vice versa ... .	St
1.3.2	I heard the bass of the logitech is louder but not as tight as the klipsch ... . and the klipsch has better treble ... .. How about the last option connecting it to and amplifier to a hometheatre system ?	Ques
1.3.3	My room size is about 5m X 6m maybe bigget but definitely not smaller	St
1.4.1	i was looking at Klipsch Quintet II also ... .. ?	Ques
1.5.1	I did that with my Z-680 Logitech Speakers system There is only so much you can get from them , hooking them up to your TV system .	St
1.5.2	There is a lot more you can get from those speakers from a computer with a good sound card .	St
1.5.3	It is to ones taste what kind off speakers you chosse .	St
1.5.4	Before I chose my speakers and my sound card I checked out others and maid my choice .	St
1.5.5	I am pleased with the choice I made .	St
1.5.6	I am sure that my choice was a good one even though I would have been pleased with the Klipsch 7.1 at that time the funds were not there .	St
1.5.7	I am still looking to get Klipsch 7.1 speakers .	St
1.5.8	They are a true suround sound speakers , The more speakers the better sound .	St
1.5.9	Good Luck Wendell H	St
1.6.1	when you say 7.1 ... which model are you referring to ?	Ques
1.7.1	I am referring to the Klipsch 7.1 speakers system .	St
1.7.2	I did a lot with my 5.1 Logitech Z-680 & 5.1 Logitech Z-5500 .	St
1.7.3	I guess the Klipsch 7.1 system would sound good placed good in a nice small room .	St
1.7.4	If you dicide to hook them up to any kind off TV system you will have to get and adapter .	St
1.7.5	This is the apater that I got and used it on my TV system , click on the link below .	St

1.8.1	What 's your budget ?	Ques
1.8.2	Are you thinking more along the lines of PC surround speakers or integrating your PC in to a home theater ?	Ques
1.8.3	I get the feeling that you 're more interested in the PC surround speakers , and if that 's the case , I would go with the Logitech 5.1 THX system .	St
1.8.4	As far as whether or not to use a coax ... it depends - try it both ways .	St
1.8.5	Essentially , you 're trying to see which ( the X-fi or the surround speaker system ) has better surround processors AND digital-to-analog converters .	St
1.8.6	The digital-to-analog conversion in the X-fi is quite good , using the coax passes that processing on to the speaker system .	St
