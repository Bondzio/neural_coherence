running 3dmark06 professional version, i got a score of 10034. now, with my system specs i feel that is low.
does anyone have any advice??
here is what i'm running: cpu: core 2 quad q6600 @ 2.4ghz (stock) heatsink: zerotherm nirvana premium ram: 2x2gb corsair @ 800mhz (stock) gpu: evga geforce 9800gt 512mb (stock) mobo: nforce 780i sli hard drive: 500gb seagate barracuda looking at those specs, is my score low?
or is that normal?
i have updated all of the drivers so i'm pretty sure that isn't the problem.
i have also ran a test on 3dmark vantage, and got a score of about 6300. thank you for your time.
