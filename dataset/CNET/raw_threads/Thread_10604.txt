8363	0	303332	2825183	NR	GUG_II	8/2/08 1:25 PM	1.2176835E12	No Startup	My pc is not booting up at all (not even the bios screen). When I turn on the power, the hard drive starts, I can see all the fans and leds in the case turn on, but nothing else happens. I tested the power supply with a device I bought a while ago and it shows it's working fine. I tried replacing the video card thinking maybe I was just not getting a signal through, but that didn't help either. There's no lose connectors, I've checked them all one at a time. And finally, from an old article I had read, I tried manually resetting the BIOS. On a side note, what had led me to believe that it could be a failing power supply, was that the cd drives are not responding to the eject button either. So what else could be causing this, did my motherboard just die on me? Thanks in advance for any help.

(The RAM is fine, I put it in a different pc and it was sorking)

If the power comes on, make sure the CMOS battery is good. How? Use a voltmeter. I can't guess what's the right reading without you sharing the model of said battery. Bob
