1.1.1	I have a wireless network with 2 PC 's on it - a desktop running WinXP and a Laptop running Vista .	St
1.1.2	I would like to add an old PC running Win98 to the network .	St
1.1.3	I am willing to wipe the HDD , and purchase and install a fresh copy of Win98SE if necessary , as I have discovered FE is n't supported by anything I have found .	St
1.1.4	The computer does n't have the specs to run WinXP , so that 's out .	St
1.1.5	It also does n't have any USB ports , so a PCI card will be needed .	St
1.1.6	I just want it to be able to share my broadband internet connection at minimum .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions on a wireless PCI card for a Win98 ( or Win98SE ) PC ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you for your input !	St
1.2.1	Been there , done that , got the scars .	St
1.2.2	But it 'll be a fun project .	St
1.2.3	Stick with brand names .	St
1.2.4	I 'm partial to D-link for all networking parts .	St
