I have several CD-RW disc that I would like to use with Win XP in ISO9660 format so they can be read by any computer with loading additional software. Is it possible to reverse the UDF formating?

Put new CD-RW disc (from same box, but never formated as UDF) in drive and Windows has no problem recognizing it. Windows XP will not recognize CD-RW with previous UDF format. Am I missing something here?

You may have to catch up that UDF is what is used for DRAG AND DROP to a CDRW, whereas if you need to have compatibility you stop using UDF and just record to the blank CDRW with CD recording software like CDBURNERXP. For extra compatibility use a CLOSED SESSION. What demo or trial? Bob
