bob - i downloaded and ran the complete system scan from the link you provided.
the problem persists.
another symptom: when i connect to a vpn, the problem automatically occurs.
as soon as i disconnect from the vpn, i am able to receive packets again.
it's a cable connection and i'm using an rca dcm425 cable modem.
the wireless router is a netgear mr814, but as i mentioned before, this happens both on wireless and when i'm physically connected.
please let me know if there is any additional information that would be helpful.
i really appreciate it.
