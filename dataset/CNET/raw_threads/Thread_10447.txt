Or can Macs also wirelessly connect to any .11b/g signal? Even if this signal was being broadcasted from lets say a Cisco or Linksys wifi access point? Thanks to everyone in advance!

They do not have to be apple branded, and most routers are b/g backwards compatible, meaning the new wireless N standard routers support wireless b and g.
