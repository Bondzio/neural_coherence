So my question is apple going to replace it's core duo chips with the upcoming intel core duo2?

People who are upset about product line upgrades would not be happy with Apple. I will write that I hope Apple does not slow down it's pace to appease this portion of possible or present owners. Bob

As mentioned, Apple keeps changes of this nature very close to their chest. You can be certain though, that whenever you decide to buy a new laptop, there will be a newer one following right along. P

The reason for this is that from August to October Macs are updated as are iPods. In January MacWorld is all about consumer products and so there's another shot at MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo. As it stands, the MacBook Pro is too close to the MacBook spec-wise and it WILL get the Merom very soon. Wait if you can, otherwise I'd save some money & get a MacBook. If you really need it, get the MacBook Pro but don't look back. Udayan.
