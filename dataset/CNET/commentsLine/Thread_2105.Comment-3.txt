i don't want to boot xp from the desktop hard drive, although if i could i would so that i could then back-up my files to the usb drive.
but what i have right now is a brick with data on it, and i was hoping i could power up that drive, connect it to the usb drive (maybe while it's connected to my laptop), and then transfer from my old drive to the usb drive.
