<s> I set my screen resolution at a setting that my monitor couldn't display. </s>
<s> Now I get a black screen every time I try and turn on my computer. </s>
<s> I don't get the usual boot up screen either. </s>
<s> I can boot up when I connect to the motherboard, but not when I use my graphics card. </s>
<s> Is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution? </s>
<s> Boot SAFE MODE and change the resolution there, then reboot. </s>
<s> I can't even see the screen that'll let me do this. </s>
<s> It's just completely black from when I turn on the computer. </s>
<s> All the PCs I've used for years show a splash screen and could get the BIOS even with the Windows video setting being incorrect. </s>
<s> SAFE MODE seems to elude new users of Windows. </s>
<s> Let's try this again. </s>
<s> Tell me how you tried to get to Windows SAFE MODE? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thats the problem. </s>
<s> im not getting this screen anymore. </s>
<s> i've actually done this before when I was using a different monitor, and used the &quot;computer wasn't shut down properly&quot; screen to boot into safe mode and change it back. </s>
<s> this time though i don't get that screen. </s>
<s> do you think I might have done something to the graphics card? </s>
<s> could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat? </s>
<s> And no BIOS screen it does not look like a settings issue. </s>
<s> It now looks like a PC that needs repair. </s>
<s> As to the &quot;done something to the graphics card? </s>
<s> could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?&quot; I have yet to encounter that as a cause of a card failure. </s>
<s> Most failures are because of inadequate cooling, failed fan or a bad power supply. </s>
<s> Since there is no BIOS, splash or other screens the machine should be treated like a dead PC and we begin the repairs by replacing the parts we suspect first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can boot up fine using the integrated card, just not the external one. </s>
<s> I guess it must be the card then. </s>
<s> I was thinking that maybe changing the resolution could affect the splash screen. </s>
<s> If not, then I definitely destroyed the card. </s>
<s> I did mess with the card when it stopped working, and I do have a network card which partially obstructs the airflow from the card's fan. </s>
<s> I probably screwed it up. </s>
<s> Crud. </s>
<s> Better than a real dead PC since repairs can be costly. </s>
<s> Since the card stops the machine cold I'd keep that card out of the machine before it fries something in the PC. </s>
<s> Check the card warranty and you may get lucky, Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
