1.1.1	I tripped over the power cord to my WD 500gb My Book external hard drive today.	St
1.1.2	The power cord came out of the unit, and it fell over onto the carpet.	St
1.1.3	I plugged it back in, and it makes a sort of grinding noise about 5 times before seemingly giving up.	St
1.1.4	I plugged it into my Windows 7 computer once it was done, and it recognizes the drive as a USB disk, but not as the D:/ drive like it used to.	St
1.1.5	What might the problem be?	St
1.1.6	Can I get it fixed?	St
1.1.7	Are all of my music and important documents gone forever?	St
1.1.8	Thanks for your help!	St
1.2.1	http://www.drivesavers.com does this sort of recovery daily.	St
1.2.2	But where are the backup copies?	St
1.2.3	Externals fail more often than internals which means we can't go without backup.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
