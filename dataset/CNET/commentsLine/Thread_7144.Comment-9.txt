bob's right just leave it alone.
you could however right click it and attempt to up date it's driver from device manager.
if this does the trick (sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't) then just plug it back in.
you might look for events concerning this device in event viewer.
if there are then you might wish to take extra efforts to re-install it.
no events, no problems.
i hate it when that happens.
those annoying false alarms.
they drive me crazy.
