i think u mean 1gb of ram...and on ur question of vid card... u have to have an adequate psu of at least 400watts then u have to giv me specs as to whether your motherboard has pci-express 16 or agp slot or pci slot...i will assume u have an agp slot and will suggest getting a card from nvidia...since u have a budget of 200 dollars, i would suggest getting a vanilla 6800.
