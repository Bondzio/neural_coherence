hi every one i am curintly useing a older asus AGP not sure of the chip set.
2.4GHz 2 gig 512mn 7600 nvidia.
i am looking at either to update my sistem and go with a pci board and up my proseserr to a 3.0 doul.
or get a AGP radon 3850 card.
i'm not sure if that card will boost my gameing by atleast 40% better, or would it be better to get a new system with a 9800 nvidia and upgrade to three gigs of ram.
i am willing to pay for either just ot sure on how much of a impact the new card will make.
