speakeasy forum.
there is a guy named john robie that is an avid gamer he's in se all the time.
doesn't seem to show in the technical forums very much any more.
i'm certain that he'll be able to help you or steer you to help.
i just bought a chaintech ge force mx 400, so i'm probably up to where you were three years ago.
