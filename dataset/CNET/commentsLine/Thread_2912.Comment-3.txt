may be of interest to some.
after removing old ps unit, popped the top, and found no bulging, or leaking electrolytics, but did see a resistor, about 2 watt job, that the coating, enamel, ceramic, i don't know, had fallen off in a little pile around the resistor.
makes me guess the thing had been overheating.
anyway, the note i wanted to make is that i scavenged the fan from the supply (ball bearing job), spliced in a connector from my pile of other dead things, and now have a new case fan.
lol.
actually this computer only came with a hsf, and the ps fan.
no case fans.
wasn't running hot in the first place, about 30 degrees c, but now running at 26. icicles are starting to form.
lol.
