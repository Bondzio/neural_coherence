ok, i know this isn't fair, but can somebody sum this whole thread up for me?
i got really confused and now i'm worse off than i was before.
here's what i need... i'm in the process of starting my own stationary business and have just bought a ton of software, etc., so i'm looking for a good, though not super expensive printer to get me started.
i'm not opposed to starting small and maybe getting a second larger printer after i see how the business is going.
so far, my best friend is my only client.
can somebody point me to a good starter printer?
i'm using illustrator/photoshop on a mac if that has anything to do with the choice.
i know so little about printers, it's amazing that i know how to use the one i have.
thanks!
