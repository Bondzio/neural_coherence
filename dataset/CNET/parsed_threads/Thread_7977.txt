<s> Our PC (HP- a1330n pavilion) stops making noise, monitor goes dark(sleep) but on/off button stays lit. </s>
<s> Nothing we do will bring it back and we can not turn off from switch(button), it must be unplugged from power supply and re-plugged in. </s>
<s> We have our HP plugged into an APC power back-up/monitor both systems are around 3yrs old. </s>
<s> A few months ago I remember a message coming up saying the battery in the APC unit was old and should be replace, which was never done. </s>
<s> Any thoughts or solutions to this problem will be appreciated. </s>

<s> And you tried another power source aside from plugging it in to APC? </s>
<s> Hi hyghwayman, I work for HP and saw your message and want to help if I can. </s>
<s> Tip: One thing you can do to shutdown your PC without unplugging it is to press and hold down the power button for 5 seconds. </s>
<s> I'm trying to better understand your problem. </s>
<s> Did this just start happening? </s>
<s> Did it occur after installing any hardware or software, even a Windows update? </s>
<s> You might want to try updating your BIOS: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=pv-56089-1&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&os=228&product=1815825 This HP support document looks like it may help: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=bph07147&cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=1815825 It could also be that your PC is overheating. </s>
<s> Perhaps it needs to be cleaned? </s>

<s> Let us know how it goes. </s>
<s> --Although I am an HP employee, I am speaking for myself and not for HP.-- </s>
<s> my desktop did the same thing. </s>
<s> turned out to be the power supply. </s>
