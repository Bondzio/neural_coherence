next year right after vista comes out I am going to get a trully vista tested desktop or laptop, that time a dell or something like that is going to have a 300-400 dollar notebook with the specs to run vista, and a 700 dollar one will probably have the following specs: pentium m 2 ghz 64 bit processor(If they come out with a 64 bit) 1 gig of ram a ati x600, 9700, or nvidia 6400 etc possible a 15.4 inch wxga widescreen aobut 4 hours of battery and some other stuff and by the way, I have a question, is windows vista going to come out with vista pro and home or is it just vista
