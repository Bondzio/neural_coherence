i noticed your issue and thought i would add more info.
i have a vf17 monitor from hp and it too has had the blackout issue.
there are a couple of posts from people that have the vf17 as well.
i just got off the phone with hp (the 877-817-4380 x79 number).
talked to a serge, but got nowhere.
he stated that my problem was nothing like the 1703 issue.
he said that the 1703 issue was not related to the monitor blacking out.
i sent a complaint to the ftc consumer affairs
