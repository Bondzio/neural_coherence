I am in desperate need of help.I tried for hours with no success. Can someone let me know where I can go in order to download the firmware. I understand that all settings should be automatic but I do know that I need the firmware since there was no dics provided.I was able to get the instruction manual but without the firmware, I cannot do anything. Netgear was not helpful to me because this was a refurbished item. None of this was relayed to me during my purchase. Please someone help me, I am so frustrated after trying for hours! Thank you for you help in advance, decorator31

The router already has a version installed, and you don't need to download and install anything if it already has the latest version. All the routers I have seen NEVER come with a firmware disc because a firmware version is already installed in the router AT THE FACTORY. If the router doesn't have the latest firmware version (you need to read the manual to discover how to check this), then download it using a computer and Internet connection that works properly. IMPORTANT: After you download the latest version, follow the instructions on the webpage or in the manual to install the firmware update. If you don't read and follow the instructions EXACTLY as they are written, then you risk turning your router into an expensive doorstop. Please read the instructions. * * * * * I had absolutely no trouble downloading the latest version today. Version &quot;2.0.13_1.0.13&quot; for North America Version &quot;2.0.14_1.0.14&quot; for Worldwide - outside North America Download the one that is appropriate for where you live.

Can you give me step by step directions in order to do this.The Amazon store is not getting back to me. I need this new laptop because I am bed-ridden and can not use my desktop computer as often as I need to. I am so sorry and would appreciate any help that I could get.I have already been to the links that you provided me. That's when I get the message about the recovered file fragments. I have a surfboard modem from comcast and a Linksys router because I have Tivo connected thru my internet. I do know that I need to only use the Netgear router and forget about the Linksys router. Please help me as I am so frustrated. I am normally very good at figuring out electronic solutions but am having a big problem here. Thank you, decorator31

I can create a CD image and email it to you so you can burn a copy from it using Easy CD Creator, if you have that software. Also, I have a very similar configuration: Motorola Surfboard cable modem, Linksys Router (Vonage phone line), plus I have a wireless print server. I'm currently reloading my system with updated drivers. Let me know if you want me to image the CD for you. Good luck! pmpco

(The port that is closest to the antenna.) 2. Connect your computer into any of the lan ports on the router. 3. Plug the power cable into the router. 4. You should see 3 lights on the router (power, internet and lan connection). 5. Now, take out the power cable from the router and from the modem also. And plug the power back to the router, just to the router. 6. You should see 2 lights on the router (power and lan connection). 7. Open Internet explorer and in the address box type http://www.routerlogin.com/basicsetting.htm and hit enter. 8. user name is:admin / password is: password After you are logged in, page 27 in manual seems to be helpful Before you do too much, you may want to update the firmware in the router. Go to http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/wgr614v6.asp and download the latest firmware and install it, could make your setup go easier. If you are using this with Verizon DSL or a Westell modem/router you may have to change the ip address of the Netgear router. Please follow the steps to change the ip address of the Netgear router. 1. Connect the modem into the internet/wan port of the router. (The port that is closest to the antenna.) 2. Connect your computer into any of the lan ports on the router. 3. Plug the power cable into the router. 4. You should see 3 lights on the router (power, internet and lan connection). 5.

This will take you to the basic settings page of the router. 9. Click on apply button on the bottom. 10. Login to the router (User Name = admin Password = password unless you have changed it). 11. Click on LAN IP SETUP on the left hand side. 12. Change the lan ip address or local ip address to 192.168.7.1 and click on apply. 13. This will give you page cannot be displayed. 14.
