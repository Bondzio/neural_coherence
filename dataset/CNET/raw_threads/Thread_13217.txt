Since then, I have been unable to burn CD`s, either with Toast or iTunes; I get a message that the drive is busy or reserved by another application, even though nothing else is running. I just checked Apple System Profiler and the info about the drive (Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-103) states that disc burning is not supported. I`ve had this computer for several years (G4 AGP with the builtin burner) and never had trouble burning CDs before. What did I do wrong with the OS re-install and how can I fix it?

I guess a good question would be to ask what sort of corruption issues you had and who advised you. What sort of re-install did you do? Complete Format and install or a Clean Archive and Install? This drive was not original equipment on this machine which raises the question, did you have a patch installed to enable this burner to function with OS X? Something like PatchBurn from OWC? I remember Apple being very fussy about what burners worked in their systems. P

I bought the computer used; it was my first (and only) OS X computer and I never did figure out how to back up the startup disk, so I have no way of knowing what was on it. The corruption issue was that the computer kept forgetting settings for Netscape and other apps, and that I couldn`t start up in OS 9.2 without the computer hanging up during startup. I did a Clean Archive and Install. I still can`t start up in OS 9 but Netscape does seem to remember settings now. I had described my problems on this forum and was told that a reinstall sounded like what I needed. Thanks!

Are you starting in X and then switching to OS 9 (Classic), a situation you should try to avoid. Once you make the move to X, it is easier on your nerves to attempt to do everything in X rather than go back to 9 from X Which OS are you now having problems with, OS X or OS 9(Classic)? I remember that I suggested that you get a copy of OS X 10.3. There is a distinct possibility that the system is now so messed up that the best move is to wipe it all out and start again. Let us know about the 9 & X situation. P

I`ve no idea what I did; today the blasted thing is listed under Apple Profiler as fully enabled and burns anything I want. I still can`t start up in OS 9; even the Norton disk won`t start up; it hangs up after the startup screen. I did put in a new Sonnet processor back in September (Sonnet Encore/ST G4), but on the box it states that the upgrade requires OS X and OS 9.2 and that 9.2 IS supported. I`m getting OS 10.4.2 Monday and will upgrade; I hope it helps. I still have a ton of legacy software, or I`d give up on OS 9.
