Your subject line says your burner doesn't recognize media.
In your post you say you can burn music cd's (but no data cd's).
That seems a contradiction.
And isn't the recognition part of the burning the same for burning a music CD or a data CD?
So where in the turn of events does it differ.
You can try to burn using a free program called CDBURNERXP.
If that doesn't work either, I'd replace the drive and try again.
Replacing is a rather easy job and the drives aren't expensive.
