I wanted to share that these forums are all volunteer, all member to member.
Which means you get to try a little harder.
No paid staff also means that a few members get upset over &quot;tech support.&quot; I apologize for my analogy but I have many more to choose from.
But let's get back to YOUR discussion.
All that I wanted to share I have, now it's time for you to decide if it's worth helping others help you.
