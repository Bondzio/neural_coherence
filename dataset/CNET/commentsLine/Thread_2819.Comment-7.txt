i expect the answer to this is going to be &quot;because there are better alternatives&quot;.
i run an error check on my hard drive virtually every week.
it's supposed to look for and fix bad sectors and file system errors.
i once had a word document go bad on me and lost an entire edition of a magazine that i had stored to floppy.
this utility also works on floppies, so i had a chance to see it in action.
it restored my damaged file - even though it put in some squiggly marks to indicate unrestorable damage.
i got that edition back though, essentially intact.
as a complete novice i assumed, hopefully, that the same utility would also do a similar repair if i got a bad sector on my hard drive.
in case i didn't use the correct name i'm talking about the checking utility that you get by clicking &quot;my computer&quot; then right clicking on &quot;c&quot; drive or whichever drive you want to check, click properties, select &quot;tools&quot; tab and then click &quot;check now&quot; for error checking.
then check the two boxes, restart the pc and wait....... while the drive is checked.
then run a disk clean up to get rid of any check disk fragments.
so i expect you techie people will now tell me why this isn't the best way to fix things.
mostly i get told that microsoft utilities aren't as good as xyz alternatives.
my laptop is getting on a bit and so i might need this information myself one day.
