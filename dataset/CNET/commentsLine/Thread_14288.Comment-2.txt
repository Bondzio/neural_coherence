next year you will see dual-core cpus that will make you cry you paid so dearly for a dual-cpu motherboard based solution.
as to your machine crawling, the only time i see this is if the user leaves programs running they are not using.
also, internet exploerer is a great way to let parasites on the machine and again the complaints are similar to yours.
post if you dare a hijackthis log and let's see if your machine has parasites.
i will not do much other than note if i see them.
