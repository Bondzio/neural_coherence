2011	0	348799	3075481	NR	siva66	7/6/09 7:15 PM	1.2469077E12	Internal or External HD question	My PC: HP Pavilion Media Center m7750n Athlon 64 X2 (W) 5000+ 2.6 GHz 4 GB DDR2 ram 400 GB SATA 7200rpm HD Running Vista I purchased a HP 1TB Personal Media Drive to use in the removable drive bay about 1 month ago. Well the drive is loud and rather annoying to say the least. I have one free internal 3.5&quot; bay available. Is there any preference (internal or external) with regards to speed, noise and performance if I wanted to replace the noisy drive? My use for the drive would be to store all my media and the drive would be used frequently as I stream my media to my PS3. Any good brands to use? Thanks in advance

You can find 1,000+ long posts on that so let's not do that again. Given we can control the noise and speed can be the same in or out with SATA that's a tossup too. Why not get what you like? Bob

For sound level: why not try? Get the disk out, put in your PC and compare. As you already have bought a hard disk, why ask about a brand for another one? Do you happen to know what brand HP put into their case? I don't think they make their own. Well, I know. You need a second and third hard disk to backup your first. That's a smart idea! Many of our members don't backup and lose everything on their external. Kees

I still like internals for the very simple reason they last longer because: a. It's more protected. b. People tend to not drop a PC tower. c. They turn it off to move it. d. All of the above. c. All of the above and more. e. None of the above. I hope you see the Chevy vs. Ford issue here. Bob
