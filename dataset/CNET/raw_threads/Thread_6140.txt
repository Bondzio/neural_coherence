Yes, I've read where people write &quot;. I can not find a copy of Acer's eRecovery Management anywhere on the internet. &quot; So don't gripe too long about it. Bob

If you got it new, you've got warranty. If no luck with warranty, see if going back to factory conditions from the recovery media helps. If not, it's a hardware issue. Kees
