<s> I have a drive from an old xp computer that i put into an external enclosure to copy some files off of it, but all the files i need require special permission to access. </s>
<s> i tried messing around with the permissions stuff, but everytime i tried to apply full control, it said &quot;access denied&quot; for all the files i needed. </s>
<s> so, if i hook this up internally am i gonna have the same problem and/or potentially mess up the computer/drive? </s>
<s> The issue about permissions is well discussed. </s>
<s> Here's your google -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Vista+TAKE+OWNERSHIP+OF+DRIVE </s>
