2145	0	167310	1851320	NR	JSteinmetz	4/2/06 1:07 PM	1.14398322E12	networking 2 laptops	I have created a workgroup for my two laptops which run Windows XP Home. I can see whatever it is I want to share on each of the computers. My question is, can anyone else see my files/folders without the group name? Thank you. Jeff

You may wish to disable SSID broadcasting and change the default name and password of the router.
2145	4	167310	1851391	1851369	JSteinmetz	4/2/06 2:17 PM	1.14398742E12	password	My router is password protected but the ssid is not &quot;protected&quot; is that ok?
2145	5	167310	1851444	1851391	Michael Geist	4/2/06 3:09 PM	1.14399054E12	Your SSID broadcasting gets either....	turned on or off. I've found that MAC filtering is usually enough in most home environments since many will trip over WEP/WPA encryption.
2145	6	167310	1851399	1851444	JSteinmetz	4/2/06 3:24 PM	1.14399144E12	My SSID says	it is enabled WEP is an Open system and it says WEP is disabled.

2145	8	167310	1852221	1851545	JSteinmetz	4/3/06 6:40 AM	1.1440464E12	I am going to....	Enable MAC Filtering now and see what happens. I am checking the button only allow computers with MAC addresses listed below to access the network. It then lists my computers in the DHCP Client drop down list so I'll see what happens. thank you.
