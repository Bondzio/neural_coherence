<s> I can't find this driver for free download anywhere. </s>
<s> Can anyone direct me or send it to me? </s>
<s> The 5010 (without the &quot;i&quot;) doesn't work right. </s>
<s> I'm running latest XP Home, 512DDR, 40 gig HD. </s>
<s> Don't want to buy anything. </s>
<s> Thanks, Tom </s>
<s> Went to Compaq, routed to HP, plugged 5010i, got a page that said this: Downloads for this product are not available through this website. </s>
<s> Please contact your local HP representative for information on the specific update methods available for this product. </s>
<s> Same message i got. </s>
<s> What exactly is a local hp rep anyway? </s>
<s> I just want a download. </s>

<s> The response by Coryphaeus above already addressed that. </s>
<s> HP apparently doesn't support this product any longer. </s>
<s> By the way, the reason I need the driver is because the monitor buttons have lost functionality. </s>
<s> I cannot make any adjustments to the display, including the power button. </s>
<s> Thanks for the effort. </s>
