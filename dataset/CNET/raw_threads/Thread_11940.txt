I was thinking of just buying a modem and wireless router rather than renting either one ($2/mth) or both ($5/mth). I have a computer that is a few years old, so everyone has told me that most likely I have a &quot;G&quot; card, but I am not sure (Dell Inspiron 600m). So, then should I just get a G router, or is it worth it to get a N one, in case I ever want to upgrade my card? Right now, my wireless range would only have to be 100 feet or so. How are the Blinkin routers (recommended by Comcast and only $60)? Does the brand matter all that much? Also, I was thinking of getting a modem. Staples offers some (Zoom, Linksys) compatible with Comcast, but they are all DOCSIS 2.0. I heard that Comcast might upgrade to DOCSIS 3.0 in the next year. In which case, will my modem become obsolete and I will have wasted my money? Basically, I am trying to decide whether it is worth it to rent or buy (and if so, what equipment and will it become obsolete very quickly........). Thank you.

However, if your rented device fails, they replace it. If your owned device fails, you get to do that. Personally, I'd split the ownership. Let your ISP provide the modem. It's going to be MAC address linked, most likely to their system and they'll set it up for you. Buy your own router. Go with a good brand. I've always liked 3Com and US Robotics but others prefer Linksys, Dlink, etc. Read some reviews and posts here about these brands. You can easily enough replace your router as your needs change but let your ISP handle the modem. My two cents. Good luck.
