the desktop is a dell, running on xp, the modem is a verizon issues westell, the router is a linksys.
the desktop pc uses a usb hub to connect it to the b/w canon printer as well as a scanner and an external hard drive.
i'm hoping that being a little more specific about what kind of equipment i already have helps you help me?!
?
