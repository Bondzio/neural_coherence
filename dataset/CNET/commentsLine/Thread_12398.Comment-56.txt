thanks so much for the great feedback on the xerox 8560!
two questions: 1. with the dn model, will it duplex print on custom size 80# card stock?
i print mostly quarter pages.
2. where did you purchase yours from, and how was customer service, and how quickly did it arrive?
i need to get mine asap for two large projects i have coming up, and i want to avoid a long wait time, but not at the expense of quality customer service.
thanks!
