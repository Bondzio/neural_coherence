1.1.1	I have a GA-P67A-UD3-B3 + Intel i5 2500k + ATI Saphire 6950 1GB + 2x4gb G.Skill RipJaws Series + PSU CoolerMaster GX650w.	St
1.1.2	The computer boots just fine, I get the &quot;one beep&quot; on post, and I can get into the OS (w7 or ubuntu 11.04 with dual boot).	St
1.1.3	But after a while of using it I get a strange beep code, I couldn't identify what kind of beep code is it, and couldn't find any info online or even asking gigabyte support, I uploaded the beep code here so you can listen to it: http://kiwi6.com/file/mx750tt335 or here http://www.zshare.net/audio/98880046f982b8e4/ I tough it may be a temp or fan failure alarm, since it appears inside the OS and not on boot like normal beep codes, but I tried disabling all the alarms on the bios and the beep still appears, also I monitored the temperature while the beep code appears and it doesn't look too hot: Hardware sensors Monitor 4.5 shows: Mainboard: 25c CPU1: 44c CPU0: 46c HDD: 37c Chassis Fan Speed: 1950RPM Voltages: +12v : +12.04v +5v: +5.07v +3.3v: +3.38V Core: 1.33v Aux: 1.02v SpeedFan show temps: Core0 : 44c Core1: 45c Core1: 42c Core3: 46c HD0: 39C Temp1:42c Temp2: 25c Temp3: 36c Fan speed: 1929rpm And from the bios (pc health status section) just after the beeps: System Temp: 45c CPU Temp: 48c CPU Fan Speed: 2327RPM VCore: 1.212v DDR15V: 1.536v +12v: 12.073v Vcc3: 3.383v Vcc: 5.083v Vtt: 1.088v Does someone knows what could be causing this beep code?	St
1.2.1	the RAM ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I used memtest bootable usb from memtest.org, and didn't find any error, could it still be RAM?	St
1.4.1	failure'.	St
1.4.2	(AMI BIOS) That said if you've run memtest or something like it without error, then I'd eliminate that as a possible cause.	St
1.4.3	It's disappointing to hear that GigaByte has not been more helpful.	St
1.4.4	Keep us posted VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Take the side panel off.	St
1.5.2	Get a small fan and point it at the innards......test.	St
1.5.3	Memtest.	St
1.5.4	With 8GB of ram that can take some time to test.	St
1.5.5	I hope you let it run for 10/12 hrs.	St
1.5.6	Maybe try it one stick of ram at a time.	Sug
1.5.7	See if the symptoms change.	St
