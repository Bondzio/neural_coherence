But when I install it, the computer just holds on the motherboard Splash page. I am running: winxp sp2 2x Samsung 512 memory (new is Crucial 512 memory) p4p800s-e deluxe motherboard I know all the slots and memory sticks work as I have juggled them around to test them all, its just the motherboard doesnt like having more than 2 sticks in at a time. And I am sure the motherboard will take up to 3 GIG of ram. I cant think what it can be at the moment, so any suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks

As you add more sticks of RAM, the CPU BUS slows every so slightly and you may get failures. You also will draw more power so any power issues may show up. To get such to work I usually... first have the latest BIOS since some BIOS updates address memory timing. Next I try the BIOS defaults, then I may slow down the memory timings. If you feel this isn't right, you can always call the board/system supplier and demand they make it work or refund your money... Best of luck, Bob PS. XP rarely pays off above 512M except for Doom 3. And I've yet to see any payoff at 1.5G.

Im having trouble flashing the bios, but thats another story, Iv been told I have the latest version anyway. How do you slow down the memory timings? And what do you mean by pay off? im running a DAW (digital audio workstation) and need all the RAM I can get when running (often 3) big power hungry programs at the same time...if thats what u meant? Anyway, thanks.

YOU didn't post a link your your machines BIOS instructions so all I can offer is a GUIDE such as &quot;slow down the memory access&quot;. This means reducing the CPU FSB clock rate, inserting a wait-state or setting the CL from 2.5 to 3.0 or other... This may be bad news since video work is generally not that dependent on RAM past 512M. I know this one since we run some DVD compilation software and at 512M the box does its work in 6 hours. We added the second 512M and it finished in 5 hours, 55 minutes. No payoff there. The test was repeated many times. We did eek more time out of the boxes by getting faster RAM and finding some settings in the BIOS and we eeked out 5 hours with just 512M so that paid off. Sorry you didn't post your machines BIOS manual... Why are you not making this the machine supplier's problem? Bob

I just post problems on forums because they are a lot more helpful than most technical support, who tell you just to upgrade drivers to get you out the door quickly. I just restarted my machine to get into the BIOS and I think its completely freezing when it gets to the splash page as I cant hit DEL.

No one may be able to get this to work with the sticks of RAM you have. To get it to work, you would fit the monster power supply (try 550 or 650 Watts) so you know that's not the issue, have the latest BIOS or don't complain and then use 1GB memory sticks of the make/model that the motherboard maker lists as compatible. Remember that some boards have odd requirements for pairs of sticks to get better memory access. Bob

Anyway, is there a way I can test to see if it is insufficient power before I go buying another PSU? ..can I just disconnect some IDE devises for example and try and boot? And I also though it might be something about installing RAM in pairs, but there are only 3 black RAM slots, and it says nothing in the manual about pairing memory. Thanks for replying
