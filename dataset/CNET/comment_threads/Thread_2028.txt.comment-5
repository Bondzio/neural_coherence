Apple's ads aren't perfect, but I don't think I've ever seen one that was completely false.
The only problem with their ad campaign is they spend way too much time attacking the competition rather than promoting the many benefits of their own products.
Why tell your target audience that you should escape from something when you can just offer them something better instead?
Macs can advertise themselves.
The 27-inch iMacs are great deals, regardless of the processor choice.
I don't think upgrading to the i5 would make a significant difference, or the i7 for that matter, unless you are bent on running some heavy-duty editing software, although most probably don't support multicore chips.
Whichever configuration you get, I doubt you'll be disappointed with it.
