The amber light is on and I cannot ping any address, it just times out. I am thinking the onboard NIC might be bad. What do you guys think?

One easy thing you could try is to right click the network connection and click repair. That will release network settings, obtain new ones and flush the DNS and ARP cache. I have seen that work and also not work, but it's a start.
