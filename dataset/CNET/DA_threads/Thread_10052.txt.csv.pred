1.1.4	Thanks ceyesuma	St
1.2.1	Besides a jump drive .	St
1.3.1	You 're still way ahead to use Ethernet cable and network them .	St
1.3.2	You do n't have to have internet access to do so .	Ques
1.3.3	If you 've got XP , it 's still even possible to install NetBeui protocol and transfer files without even having TCP/IP on the one that does n't go on the internet .	St
1.3.4	It 's not installed by default but is on the XP CD ROM .	St
1.4.1	Yes there are USB transfer cables .	St
1.4.2	You can get one here .	St

1.5.1	If you only link to your own store , you find someone will notice and start cleaning up your posts .	St
1.6.1	ceyesuma asked about a product that I just happen to sell .	St
1.6.2	But I see what you mean I 'll post a few more location where you can get the product next time .	St

1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	That 's great I will have to explore that one .	St

1.9.4	Thanks again -Steve	St
1.10.1	It 's designed to work on windows XP and Vista .	St
1.10.2	I 'm not sure if it will work on other OSs .	St
1.10.3	If you need a universal solution .	St
1.10.4	I would recommend a second Ethernet card .	Sug
1.11.1	XP allows you to easily create a home network using a crossover cable between the two , or using a straightthrough cable from a swich to each computer .	St
1.11.2	This option would give you a much faster transfer speed , you could also share the internet connection this way .	St
1.11.3	Once the connection is made going throught the creat a new home network wizzard is easy .	St
1.11.4	From there I would create shared folders , or purhaps share the desktop folder .	St
