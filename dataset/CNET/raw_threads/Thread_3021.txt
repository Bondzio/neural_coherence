8889	0	219122	2326144	NR	katy24	11/18/06 6:35 AM	1.1638317E12	Compaq 5300 refuses to boot	....this computer tries to come on the second you plug it in..the lights on the cdrom, cdrw and the floppy flash and then..it only goes to a black screen..the green power light stays on, but the light that shows the hard drive working doesn't come on......can't get into ANYthing, ANYway. have also tried to boot from restore discs....no good. I have a twin to this computer and I have switched some things trying to find the problem. 1. the power supply 2. the video card 3. a different monitor 4. a different hard drive I have reseated all the connections. I have taken the mentioned parts and put them in the other computer and all of them seem to work fine. I do wonder about the power switch...I haven't traded that off with the other computer....should the faulty computer try to boot like this when it is first plugged in? The working one just sits there when you plug it in..waiting to be switched on. Would it act like this if the switch were faulty....It seems to be getting power, it just won't boot up. Does anyone have suggestions as to what might be wrong that I could check myself....I don't want to spend a bunch of money on this thing, would just like to get it running and sell it thanks LKM

8889	3	219122	2680970	2326144	jzou	1/16/08 7:01 PM	1.20051006E12	refuse to boot	The only time I have had such a problem is with hard drive broken, but as you stated, the hard drive works fine. May I ask if this is a new computer or second hand one or have you own it for a while now and it just suddenly stopped working? Another thing to consider is the RAM, my own computer experienced similar problems when I installed a 1GB RAM into a slot that can, at most, handle 512Mb.
8889	4	219122	2680984	2326144	nvo	1/16/08 7:07 PM	1.20051042E12	huh?	So when you hit power... does the computer screen show any output? are u able to get into bios? does it go past the post screen into windows? Have u tried switching out the monitor?
8889	5	219122	2681019	2680984	jzou	1/16/08 9:06 PM	1.20051756E12	reply	I have already fix the problem. The max ram my ram slot can handle is 512Mb, but the chip I put in is 1Gb. This had the result of the computer keep restarting before it gets to the bios or anything else, a blank screen.
