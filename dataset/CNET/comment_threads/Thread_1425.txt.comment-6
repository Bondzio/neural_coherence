Given the thread started with concerns about reliability and support, DIY is not a good topic to consider.
If something goes wrong, you're left troubleshooting and putting humpty-dumpty together again.
Best Buy has Geek Squad right there, so they'll be able to help with stuff.
I dunno if they have any XPS 420, but I'm sure they've something comparable in Dell or another brand.
You won't even necessarily pay more than you would for DIY.
But the advantage of DIY is you build it exactly the way you want it, rather than settling for the configurations that are supplied in a store.
My car needed its oil changed.
I know how to change my oil, and could have gone to an auto-parts store.
But instead I went to Jiffy Lube and got some reading done as they did the job in 1/4 of the time it'd have taken me (not to mention I garage-saled my jackstands and all that junk years ago).
