<s> I would like to have my laptop and my desktop use the same printer. </s>
<s> The PC runs XP and the laptop runs Vista. </s>
<s> The printer is an older HP 6110xi all in one and is currently used only by the PC. </s>
<s> Is it as simple as buying a printer server and plugging in both computers? </s>
<s> Do I need to load the HP drivers onto the laptop? </s>
<s> If so, are drivers available for Vista? </s>
<s> Can I get away with using a simple A-B switch? </s>
<s> I'm not even sure what other questions to ask. </s>
<s> Thanks, Sheldon </s>

<s> As to a print server, installation varies with the model. </s>
