913	2	229567	2381196	2381060	linkit	1/20/07 9:58 PM	1.16933028E12	Very nice	Nicely done! Besides XP, I'd just add one more thing--a floppy drive for the BIOS updates and to install the SATA/RAID driver. My favorite is the combination media card reader + floppy drive in one unit. Makes great use of one 3.5&quot; external bay space.

My battery always seemed to go low during a game of source so I threw it away. I got my keyboard from a goodwill equivalent for $4 and couldn't be happier. I have yet to see a KB under $70 that is as nice to type on as this baby. You can save a lot of money by going to good will for crap like that. The DVD burner... if you go to newegg they sell 20x drives for under $50. And spend $10 at xiode.com to get some thumb screws. Lots of em. They just make everything look so much cleaner (When they all match, inside and out).

913	5	229567	2381360	2381264	Gigity Gigity Goo	1/21/07 6:53 AM	1.16936238E12	ya i went to tigerdirect.com and made a cart,...	if you want absolute savings then yes... u could use a flash drive instead of a loppy so im not worried. the card reader you can get from microcenter for 12 bucks if you wana use an sd card instead for updating bios.. i did forget OS but updated so wif vista ultimate its 2988.88 bucks my wireless mouse lasts about a mounth in battery life. the unique scrolling mechinism would help too. ur right about the keyboard being expencive(i use a 30$ microsoft media keyboard that types just as nicely), but for gaming the other keyboard has amo count, and some usefull keys lieing around. have fun....
