1.1.1	For the past couple of weeks I've been playing Xbox Live and getting disconnected every 5-20 minutes or so.	St
1.1.2	I have it port forwarded properly and everything is configured right...DMZ, etc.	St
1.1.3	I've checked modem signals and stuff and posted that on dslreports.com and they claimed my signals were fine.	St
1.1.4	The disconnection lasts literally only a few seconds but its a major annoyance and critical to certain points when I'm playing on Xbox Live.	St
1.1.5	Another note is that this mainly happens when playing online games but also does happen when not playing just very less frequently.	St
1.1.6	Most of this time although the connection doesn't literally disconnect but drops to where there will be no upload or download speed.	St
1.1.7	As if I'm connected but I can't do anything.	St
1.1.8	Any help would be appreciated.	St
1.1.9	I've power cycled my modem and reset my router multiple times but this does nothing.	St
1.1.10	Modem - Motorola SVB5220 Router - Belkin Wireless N+ Comcast - 16/2 tier	St
1.2.1	Find the forum sticky and it's settings to help.	St
1.2.2	Read that first.	St
1.2.3	Now is it setup that way?	St
1.2.4	Next we find members posting about going all the way with N routers only to discover that it works better when you set the router to 802.11g mode.	St
