i would suggest the nvidia fx 5700le for pci aprx $89-$100, or the nvidia fx 5200 for pci aprx $68-$93.
to purchase check neweggg or places like best buy, circuit city, compusa, etc...  on the left &quot;advance search&quot; click the arrow on 'interface' and select pci then search at the bottom.
the companies do not make a high end pci card.
keep in mind that you don't select the pci-express card as that fits a x16 slot.
