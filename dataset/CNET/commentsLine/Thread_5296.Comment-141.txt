it has been mention numerous times that memory is not the key component for graphics but the graphics cpu chip or gpu is the key component.
now i will also agree that your question is &quot;mute&quot;, most pcs come with an integrated graphics card and most motherboards have a pci-e slot or regular pci slot where you can install your own graphics card....so search the net for that pc and see if find out if the motherboard has an extra slot for graphics.
and yes a mid level graphic card a few year;s old between $ 80-150 (w/rebate) will handle all your needs.......unless you are a gamer and gamers are never satisfied...they will always upgrdae.
when i brought my e-machine pc (now retired) back in 2003 the integrated card handle everything i threw at it and play all my son's games which were a few years old.
in six months i purchase a seperate card so he could play newer games.
and on my current system.....i ordered it with a graphics card so he could play all his games.
so find out if it has a slot and don't worry.
when you buy a card, to play it safe buy 512 mbyte of ram and if affordable buy 1 gbyte ram to ease your worries.
