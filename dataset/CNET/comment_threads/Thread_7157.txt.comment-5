The computer is an amalgam of three or four computers, and to be honest I don't remember the specifics.
I can access them and post them, but everything was working fine until that CD-RW went in.
I am going to take the IDE cable out and put in a newer one, and if that doesn't work, I will set both jumpers to CS and let the computer figure out what is what.
Thanks for the (generic, your word) information.
I appreciate your time and effort in helping with this issue.
