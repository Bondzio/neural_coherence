My external hard disk is virus affected and i can't access it using windows..but i can access it using Ubuntu...But some of the files (movies) in it can't be copied to my computer using ubuntu,especially large files...small files are getting copied..While copying large files the speed of copying get reduced slowly from 10mb/s to 1-2mb/s and finally the process get stuck...and a dialogue box appear with the writing &quot;An error occured while copying file&quot;...I haven't installed ubuntu in my system.. i am using it from a DVD..So can anyone help me to solve this problem?
