Several years ago I bought Wipe Drive because I could boot it from a floppy and wipe any HDD to a DoD spec.
Most drive mfgs have utilities that will diagnose their drives or wipe their drives, write zeros to them (WD has this one and so does IBM)), etc., etc., and I'm sure there are others.
If I run across any others...I post another note.
