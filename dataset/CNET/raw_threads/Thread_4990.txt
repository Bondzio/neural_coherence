I removed the hard drive from a Compaq 6470NX PC running Windows XP. Everything with the installation went well with installation and hookup. However I'm not savvy enough to know how to use it. I need to know how to transfer stuff to my Vista run laptop, step by step. Vista is still confusing to me. I need an explanation that will be understood by a new Vista user.

You can put the old hard disk into some USB case like -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=USB20-SATA-BLK&cat=CAS then plug that USB cable to your new PC. Then you use Explorer like you used to and copy your files out. Bob

I had a Compaq Presario 6470NX using XP that was about 6 years old. The power supply burned and I wanted new technology anyway, so, I bought a new Gateway laptop with Windows Vista Home Premium. I bought an Acomdata enclosure and put the Compaq hard drive in it as an external drive. I hooked it up, turned it on, and it doesn't show up in my computer anywhere except the task bar where the icon blinks and says that it's ok to remove the new hardware. BTW it is suppose to work with PATA, SATA, and IDE. Now I'm lost. I know that ther is stuff like name, addresses, phone #'s, SS #s, etc. on there as well as photos and medical records on there (I'm a terminal cancer patient) and I need to get the stuff on my new computer. (MT6920 Gateway Laptop) Please help. I don't know what to do do next.

I can't find your writings about reading the ACOMDATA manual about the drive JUMPER SETTING. It could be wrong. No, I don't know what setting to use. There are far too many drive casings out there. You must tell me what setting the documentation calls for and what your drive is set for. Next we have the corrupt drive data issue. AFTER WE KNOW THE DRIVE JUMPER is right we try the following softwares (the demos are fine for this test.) GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY EASY RECOVERY Good luck, Bob PS. All the above is written quickly so some get upset at the &quot;tone.&quot; Sorry about that but I do my best to get you the information you need as fast as I can since this is all volunteer.
