OK call me cheap, but I have a Sony external DVD burner DRX-500ULX (1394 & USB2). This drive has functioned flawlessly for 2 years. But now Id like to try burning dual layer DVD media. Seems the cheapest way to upgrade to a DL burner is to open up the Sony case and replace the drive (internal drives are cheap these days). The Sony DRU-810A Internal Double/Dual Layer DVD burner looks like a good deal. Has anyone done this (with a Sony)? Thanks
