hi, i happend to have enjoyed and extremely similar issue with my dell latitude 600 laptop, running xp pro+sp2.
at boot time i could capture a &quot;io read error: cannot read/find arcboot signature&quot; (or something pretty close to this) before the message is wiped away and it ends up saying there is no bootable disk.
problem was repeating and insisting on trying to boot wouldn't help (in which this seems to differ from your description).
it turned out that after bringing the laptopto a friend's place where xp startupcds were available (i thought i'd to reinitialise the system completely), the boot suddenly worked.
back home it failed again.
i suspected a false contact between the disk controller connector and the (removable) c: drive.
so, i kind of gently shook the (powered-off) laptop a couple of times in several directions, after which the system booted again... even though i initially thought it might have been a disk surface problem with the boot area, it would seem it was something completely different.
i hope something as easy as this is happening to your own laptop... success!
