It would be great if it could be a &quot;true&quot; 3rd monitor, but having the ability to switch my monitor #2 between my 2nd Viewsonic and the TV would also be acceptable. My graphics card (EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Ti FPB 1024 MB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 2DVI/Mini-HDMI SLI Ready Limited Lifetime Warranty Graphics Card, 01G-P3-1561-AR) has 2 DVI outputs, which currently go to the 2 monitors that I use. The motherboard (Gigabyte Intel Z77 LGA 1155 Dual Lan 4Way/3Way/2Way CrossFireX/NVIDIA SLI Dual UEFI BIOS E-ATX Motherboard G1.SNIPER 3) has an HDMI and a DVI output that are not being used thanks to the graphics card. Is it possible to use the outputs from the MoBo to run the TV as a 3rd input? If so, how do I set this up? If not, what are some other options (other than getting a new graphics card...). I looked into KVM switches as a possibly/cheap solution, but it looks mostly like those only go from 2 input sources to 1 output source (which is the opposite of what I need...). Help is much appreciated. Thanks! PS - I'm running Windows 7.
