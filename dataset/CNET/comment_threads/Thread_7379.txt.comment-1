I am about to purchase a new computer proably the CyberPOWER GAMER ULTRA SLI PRO.
The system comes configured with 2 NEW!!!
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 320MB 16X PCI Express graphics cards (Major Brand Powered by NVIDIA) and a STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY.
However a 500W Power Supply is recommended for using dual 7900 and X1950 or above video cards.
Should I stay with the STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY or should I upgrade to 500W [for +$49], 600W [+79], or even a 700W (quad SLI ready) [+146]?
I have more of the specs right here: - Free!
