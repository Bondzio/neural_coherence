It has a 30GB drive that was pre-installed, a Maxtor 120GB drive that I installed, a Liteon DVDROM LTD163, and a HL-DT-ST CD-RW GCE-8400B CD drive. I turned off the computer, took out the 120 GB drive, restarted the computer, used it a few times, and noticed that the CD drives were not working: they showed up in Device Manager as having damaged configurations in the registry. I tried uninstalling the drivers, but that didn't work. What should I do?
