<s> I'm buying a new computer from dell (XPS600). </s>
<s> I just want to know which videocard should I get: 1)512MB ATI Radeon X1900 XTX Or: 2)Dual 256MB PCI Express x16 (DVI/VGA/TV-out) nVidia GeForce 6800 Just out of personal preference, which do you feel is better? </s>
<s> Friends of mine say they like nVidia over ATI and I just need some opinions Here are the specs for the computer if you want to know: -Pentium D Processor 940 with Dual Core Technology (3.20GHz, 800FSB) - 2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM -250GB Serial ATA Hard Drive </s>
<s> it is much faster than dual 6800s. </s>
<s> if you're trying to save money compared to an x1900xtx, consider a 7900gt (very hard to find) or an x1800xt... both will be in the $275 - $310 ballpark and both will perform better than dual 6800s. </s>
<s> with those specs seems you've spaired no expense. </s>
<s> Go for the Radeon it's all about the sexy </s>
<s> The Radeon blows away the 6800, by the way. </s>
<s> Get the nVidia GeForce 6800. </s>
<s> Great deal for great performance. </s>
<s> Besides every one knows that NVidia is more compatible with Almost all if not every thing the Video card works with. </s>
