the monthly volume.
the hp 9500, for example, is designed for 5.000 to 25.000 pages a month (not recommended to go to the maximum of 200.000, it seems).
assuming it lasts 3 years, that's 900.000 pages (36*25.000) for $ 6.000 or less than 1 cent depreciation per page.
doesn't sound too bad (of course, there's maintenance and toner also).
but you might prefer one of the lower-end printers from  or even another manufacturer.
also note that there are offerings of printer leases against an all-in price per copy, including everything.
that's like leased cars.
no investment, and if it's broke the repair is included also.
might be interesting for a starting business.
