it's rare to see this installed by the owner proper.
they expected that xp would find all the drivers.
sadly we have to check with the laptop maker for bios udpates, motherboard drivers and maybe patches.
windows update and the mysterious driver update button will not do this for us.
my bet is the os install is incomplete.
as to winsockxpfix, yes, the spyware/malware is causing such damage.
