<s> Why not start with a socket 939 mobo and and 939 Athlon 64? </s>
<s> They're newer--you will have better upgrade options. </s>
<s> You can get a nForce4 chipset, socket 939 board for the same price. </s>
<s> Also, you can get socket 939 Athlon64 3000+ (w/HSF) for less than your Barton. </s>
<s> Athlon64 939 3200+ for a little more. </s>

<s> A socket is the place in the motherboard where the processor (CPU) is inserted. </s>
<s> A Socket A motherboard has 462 pin holes for insertion of a 462 pin CPU, such as the Athlon XP 3200+ CPU. </s>
<s> Socket 939 has, you guessed it, 939 pin holes for a 939 pin processor. </s>
<s> Socket 939 motherboards support todays best AMD processors Socket 939 motherboards support todays dual core AMD processors. </s>
<s> Socket A technology in the Athlon XP 3200+ is old. </s>
<s> In fact it is three generations old: Oldest --&gt; Socket A --&gt; Socket 940, --&gt; Socket 754 --&gt; Socket 939 --&gt; Newest Athlon 64 CPUs (not available in Socket A) support 64-bit Windows OS and other programs. </s>
<s> Among other advantages, Athlon64s have newer instruction sets, meaning that they will be compatible with more new software enhancements longer. </s>
<s> When it doesnt cost any more to get the Socket 939 Athlon64 processor, there is no reason to get a Socket A AthlonXP or a Socket 754 Athlon64, unless you already have a great Socket A or Socket 754 motherboard that just needs a CPU. </s>
<s> You can get a Socket 939 Athlon64 for less than the $160 you have indicated you might spend. </s>

<s> Pay attention to the interface-- AGP is not the same as PCI Express (PCI-X16). </s>
<s> The motherboard you select has to have a slot that is compatible with your video card. </s>
<s> As stated previously, a socket 939 motherboard with a PCI Express graphics slot should keep up with the latest games for the quite some time. </s>
