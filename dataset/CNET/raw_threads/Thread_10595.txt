After a full battery discharge, I plugged the power and tried to turn it on. All the lights turn on, but after a second it goes silent and I cannot see anything on the screen even the dell logo. Please someone to help me.. I am in the middle of exam session and I need it.. asap. I also tried to remove the battery and the power cord, pressed the power button for 30sec, doesn't help. Later today I will try to remove the RAM and then install it one by one to see if the problem may be caused by bad RAM , but I doubt that this is the solution. Thanks

There's some bad advice going around and if the battery/system is old you can lose a board by doing that. Bob PS. If it's working, don't fix it.

If this was caused by the discharge of the battery this laptop deserves to be thrown out of the window.. I needed the laptop outside with no power supply .. I am also not fan of discharging the batteries .. If someone still have a possible solution please let me know Thanks

At the age I'm guessing this is, some try to discharge the battery to regain some life. But an old battery can cause the power supply or motherboard stress if the battery has issues. I have yet to see anyone discharge a battery unless the battery was old and failing. Seems a lesson is being learned first hand. Wish there was more to the story. Bob

The discharge the battery is a clue albeit not a good one. I only see folk do that in some attempt to fix a battery but it's just a bad idea if the machine has issues. Now you write about Windows but your first post says that even the Dell logo is not showing. Has anything changed? Bob

I still can't see the dell logo, I can't hear the beep of removed HDD . I can press the button of the CD and it ejects .. still only the power LED is ON, nothing has changed.

Proffitt	4/23/13 7:55 AM	1.3667037E12	That link	Shows Battery Bar which is something I thought I'd toss out there if you ever want to know about battery wear and status again. Since Windows is not coming up, it sounds like a fried board and the clues so far about the discharged battery are why I am coming down to fried board. Bob
