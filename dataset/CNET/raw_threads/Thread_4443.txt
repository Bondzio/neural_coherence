Turned on File and Printer sharing, added a Gigabyte NIC for my D-link Gigabyte router, and voila. All my PCs, four, have Gigabyte NICs. The 160 is for &quot;stuff&quot;, and the 60 has my web site on it.

Do you have to route through a IP? Questions about Telephony On your site are you talking about telephony or tell a phony? If telephony can this technology be used to improve an IP connection? I was tinkering with this some time ago seems like it should be able to increase the link speed. I was running a 56k connection at the time currently I'd using DSL. I'm pretty sure it will not work with DSL because of multiplexing. Isn't there a link between it and hyperthread technologies?

I have a router with DMZ open on one port connected to the server. I use a D-link DIR-655 Gigabit/wireless B/G/N router. I like the D-link because it has incoming filter settings. If someone (and it has happened before) tries to slam my site I can block their specific IP address. Dial-up service has gone as far as it can go because of copper cable pair technology. It won't get any better. Also because the FCC regulates the strength of the signal hitting the PSN (Public Switched Network). Any stronger signal (to get a faster speed) would bleed over into adjacent cable pairs causing cross-talk. Not understanding your last question.
