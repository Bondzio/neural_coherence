1.1.10	Place your poll votes here : http : //forums.cnet.com/2706-21566_102-2306.html and discuss what and why you use it .	Sug
1.2.1	I use a B & W laser printer for 98 % of what I print , so I only buy ink cartridges once or twice a year .	St
1.2.2	Buying that infrequently , I do n't sweat it .	St
1.2.3	On the rare occasions when I do print on the inkjet , I 'm usually printing pictures on photo glossy paper where I want the best quality .	St
1.2.4	YMMV .	St
1.3.1	Many years ago I used to use the do-it-yourself refill kits .	St
1.3.2	I always got great print quality and found they lasted just as long as the original manufacturer ink cartridges .	St
1.3.3	I ca n't find those where I live anymore so I 've gone back to using the HP cartridges .	St
1.3.4	I do n't do much printing so I do n't mind paying the modest cartridge prices once or twice a year .	St
1.3.5	I 've had everything from Epson to Lexmark and I wo n't own any printer other than an HP because they are cheaper to purchase cartridges for and I 've always gotten excellent results with the many printers I 've owned throughout the years .	St
1.4.1	Ink cartridge prices are the biggest con job since bottled water .	St
1.4.2	The manufacturers could give the printers away for free and cut the prices they charge for ink cartridges by 50 % and we would still be ripped-off .	St
1.4.3	I print as little as possible .	St
1.4.4	The worst of the bunch is Hewlett Packard who charges more than its competitors .	St
1.4.5	The end product looks good but we pay through the nose .	St
1.5.1	I buy the remanufactured ones because even it it messes up my printer at the long run , with the price i pay for original inks I could get another printer with new ink .	St
1.5.2	But I been using this remanufactured inks for years with the reset chips and I tell you it works perfectly for my letterheads , flyers , business cards , heat transfers , thesis , homeworks etc ... . , even the toners i get like that too , and i am happy my wife is happy , I get to eat my rice and beans and steaks more often , other than allowing them at epson , hp , or lexmark eat it for me ... .God Bless , One Soul for Christ Ministry uses all this ink from Amazon , cheap , good , delivery on time , and more reliable from houseofinks , inktoners , inks123 , etc ... ... go ahead try it , you will like it , cause it is good production ... ...

1.7.1	The have individual color cartridges so if one color runs out you need only replace that color , save lots of money .	St
1.8.1	I get my refilled by my local Costco .	St
1.8.2	They always seem to work just fine even though the cost is about 85 % of a new cartridge .	St
1.8.3	I also do n't print near as much as I did in years gone by .	St
1.8.4	Mainly after a few years , you can accumulate too much paper around the house .	St
1.8.5	I just keep documents on the computer is my documents folder and probably print far less than 1 % of the documents that I create .	St
1.8.6	I can find what I want easily by using the W7 search function .	St
1.8.7	Give your file a good recognizable name and you can search for it and normally find it in a very short time .	St
1.8.8	I have several cartridges that HP claim are out of date , but they print just fine .	St
1.8.9	I only fill the ones that are empty .	St
1.8.10	The print quality if great with my HP 6180 AIO printers , but just use if more judiciously now just to keep the paper down rather than the cost of the cartridge .	St
1.8.11	If you are going to print a lot , you should look into getting a Laser Printer .	St
1.8.12	Costs for that are a lot less , and you can even get color lasers .	St
1.8.13	I have a scanner built into my printer , and use that fairly often and it was a good investment to buy the printer with the scanner included in the case .	St
1.8.14	Today , most of the printers seem to be wireless friendly , and I have 4 devices that can printer to one printer/scanner .	St
1.9.1	I use a Brother B & W Laser for general printing and tends to last me 3/4 years then buy a new one for $ 90 .	St
1.9.2	With inkjet have found every time have tried & quot ; other brand & quot ; have not got the same usage or they leaked and at my work saw a whole printer wrecked when somebody did a refill kit .	St
1.9.3	I stick to the Canon brand and find it much safer .	St
1.9.4	Marie	St
1.10.1	Folks , years ago the manufacturers held sales meetings and someone told the respective CEOs that they were going to sell inkjet printers for like $ 99 and the CEO quickly got mad and said we will make no profit off of a $ 99 printer .	St
1.10.2	And like the proverbial Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland , the briefer told the CEO & quot ; Do n't worry Boss , we are going to make a fortune selling the ink ... . & quot ; I have used inkjets for work purposes where I was changing cartridges sometimes twice a day ... .	St
1.10.3	They only have enough fill for about 100 -150 pages of serious printing .	St
1.10.4	Personally , I use a Brother Multi-Functon Color Laser Printer .	St
1.10.5	I get about 5000 pages or more from my black cartridges and about 2000 pages or so out of the color and I try to severely limit color printing by going into the & quot ; Properties & quot ; Button on the Print Screen and changing Color to Mono ...	St
1.10.6	Meaning Black only whenever possible .	St
1.10.7	Last year I bought 3 black cartridges and one each color Cyan , Yellow and Magenta from a reseller / refiller for about $ 270 or so .	St
1.10.8	For the most part they have worked well .	St
1.10.9	I did , however , get a black cartridge that had the wrong alignment tabs ...	St
1.10.10	So looking at the cartridge that had just died I shaved the tab to get it to work then I had an error message that stated the ink was & quot ; incompatible & quot ; .	St
1.10.11	I have not contacted the company to see what they will do about it yet .	St
1.10.12	Luckily I had the third black cartridge which aligned correctly and did have the & quot ; correct & quot ; toner .	St
1.10.13	Not sure how a printer determines that the toner is incompatible .	Res
1.10.14	Finally , reverting back to selling inkjets real real cheap and then pricing the refill ink astronomically ...	St
1.10.15	It 's like heroin , the pusher will give you the first taste free but then you 're hooked and have to keep coming back again and again .	St
1.10.16	I truly recommend a good laser printer for 200 to 300 bucks with cartridges that last 2000 to 5000 prints .	St
1.10.17	You will be much happier in the long run .	St
1.11.1	I agree they are expensive .	Res
1.11.2	Laser toner is also a rip-off .	St
1.11.3	My Dell 5200 likes Dell supplied toner cartridges at $ 250 each .	St
1.11.4	I 've managed to find a supplier of remans who charges about & # 163 ; 90 and they seem to give a decent lifetime .	St
1.11.5	A similar $ 45 reman lasted about 3 weeks .	St
1.12.1	I 've owned a Canon PIXMA ( whatever that means..	St
1.12.2	I suspect it 's a made-up word , like & quot ; Kodak & quot ; ) .. ip90 , which is a do-everything , extremely compact , feature-packed printer.. although it 's half a dozen years old , it still works fine.. it 'll print on plain paper , labels , and do stunning photo prints on glossy or matte photo paper.. it has the optional battery pack and internal Bluetooth dongle , and I did n't pay a cent for it , since , when I got it , I was writing for an online tech site , and reviewed it.. Canon told me to just keep the printer , which , optioned-up the way mine is , retailed for around $ 600.00.. so , ink.. the iP90 uses *tiny* non-refillable ink tanks.. the print head is not built into them.. instead , it 's part of the ink-tank-holding assembly , so unlike some printers , you do n't get a new printhead when you buy new ink.. because it 's a very small , portable printer , the ink tanks are so small ( it takes one black , and one tri-color tank , and MUST have one of each installed , or it will not print at all ) .. they do n't last very long , depending on how much I print..	St
1.12.3	When I got the printer brand new from a Canon PR guy , he told me he 'd not only let me keep it after reviewing it , but he 'd send me free ink & quot ; forever & quot ; .. well , & quot ; forever & quot ; lasted about a year , because Canon transferred him to a different division .. so I was left to fend for myself , when I ran out of all the free ink he had sent me..	St
1.12.4	He also told me to NEVER use third-party clone of Canon ink tanks in the printer , as it would foul the printhead and void the warranty , which is long-gone anyway.. Retail stores , and I do n't care which one you name , sell the iP90 ink tanks packed two black , or two tri-color to a box at insanely high prices.. full retail , plus tax , plus the gasoline to drive there and back , and I will not pay their prices..	St
1.12.5	I will also NEVER use lower-grade third party ink tanks in it.. What I do is buy genuine Canon ink , sealed in the original Canon packaging , on eBay.. there are a bajillion sellers who offer it , and I simply search for & quot ; Canon ( ink tank model number ) genuine & quot ; .. it 's the word & quot ; genuine & quot ; in my searches that eliminate all the crappy third-party / no-name ink tanks.. then I do a sort by lowest price including shipping..	St
1.12.6	Typically , this method of buying new ink tanks saves me at least 50 % or more off what I 'd pay for exactly the same thing at any store you 'd care to name , whether a physical store , or online.. As long as the seller has high positives , I 'll trust them..	St
1.13.1	I have the first HP printer I bought .	St
1.13.2	I do n't use it much anymore because it is n't wireless .	St
1.13.3	Since that first one , I 've had 5 different brand printers and ALL ink cartridges are a rip off .	St
1.13.4	Many many years ago during the Stone Age , I worked for Xerox , so I know a little something about toner printing .	St
1.13.5	Today 's toner printers are a rip off and so are the cartridges .	St
1.13.6	My opinion : Hardware of any kind is planned for obsolesce even if it still works .	St
1.13.7	No one repairs anything anymore because it is cheaper to buy new -- just as the original buyer mentioned with the poll question .	St
1.13.8	With energy costs so high , transportation so high , American jobs moving overseas to cheaper labor elsewhere ( where eventually those labor costs will climb to match American ) global companies will NEVER offer quality equipment that wears well enough to repair and provide software to stay current .	St
1.13.9	As an American consumer , I hate this profit driven rip off , not to mention the severe damage it does to global natural resources and the environment just so the CEOs and Holding Company shareholders can become billionaires .	St
1.13.10	Not one of them is worth the TNT to blow them ... well you know where !	St
1.14.1	I bought my first computer in 1999 , and have always used Canon Printers .	St
1.14.2	Within a few months , I found ACSI Bulk Inks 1-888-728-2465 .	St
1.14.3	Their website link is www.oddparts.com Since most Canon printers have separate tanks for each color , they are easy to fill .	St
1.14.4	The price of ink is virtually the same price as when I first purchased it .	St
1.14.5	It will depend on the inks , but the ones that I use for my Canon are about 23.95 a pint.I need to mention that since 2001 we have had two printers and refill the tanks of both .	St
1.14.6	I must tell you that I do not print photos with my printer , but have printed owner manuals , PDF documents , etc over the years , and I just checked my supply .	St
1.14.7	Of course I use more black than colors , and My last black was purchased in September 2009 , and have half of that bottle left .	St
1.14.8	I will have to order a new bottle of yellow .	St
1.14.9	The last bottle of yellow was purchased in October 2005 .	St
1.14.10	The first couple years , I replace my print head and , then I discovered that eventually the white filler in the tanks will bread down and clog the jets .	St
1.14.11	For a while you can clean them , but inevitably they would not clean up , and I thought I needed a new printhead .	St
1.14.12	And they are not cheap either .	St
1.14.13	Then I discovered that I could just buy the very expensive set of black plus 3 colors of genuine Canon tanks once a year , then refill them for a year .	St
1.14.14	No more printheads since then .	St
1.14.15	As I said I do n't hesitate to print a needed manual .	St
1.14.16	I once printed a 200 page manual for a sewing machine .	St
1.14.17	I never think twice about making printouts .	St
1.14.18	I am not exactly sure , but I would estimate that I have spent less than $ 200 for ink since 1999 , for two printers .	St
1.14.19	And my husband is still using a Canon printer that is 7 years old .	St
1.15.1	I have n't brought a printer is roughly 28yrs .	St
1.15.2	The ones i use are given or offered to me as payment .	St
1.15.3	The inkjet types then work and if they do n't i use the other sitting printers ink carts to replace depleted or re-use other printers and pitch the old one , actually recycle it .	St
1.15.4	OEM ink carts while many complain about price generally tend to keep the printer working w/o issue for some time .	St
1.15.5	if I have to buy an ink cart , then its a & quot ; refilled OEM & quot ; that pre-packaged or manufactured from office centers .	St
1.15.6	I 've tried all other methods and had poor results or lead to a failure relatively soon afterwards .	St
1.15.7	Since , I repair printers more than I can ever count , inkjets are the money grabbing lot I 've ever seen .	St
1.15.8	In fact , ounce for ounce it 's more than gold .	St
1.15.9	Quite frankly if you have to print that much , then think laser , even color is cheaper than inkjet .	St
1.15.10	Right now I have an HP printer that 's been working for 8yrs .	St
1.15.11	or more .	St
1.15.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
