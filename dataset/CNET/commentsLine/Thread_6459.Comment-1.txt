this is in reference to post 18 of 18 at:  i installed a new canon pixma mp830 this morning.
i went to canon's website and checked for new drivers and/or new firmware, and none is available.
with my previous a-i-o's, i have not checked for new drivers or firmware and haven't had a problem until the hp a-i-o referenced in the above link.
i am not clear as to when this needs to be checked.
is this something that needs to be done periodically or only when problems develop?
thank you.
