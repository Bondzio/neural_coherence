Now, I really don't see any benefit there at all.
The CEO of Intel in an interview on UK TV was quoted &quot;...there is no reason to throw more cores on a CPU because there are very, very few applications that can utilise them.
The only advantage for multi-cores is weather and genetic modelling that's why Intel are focusing on smaller transistor and die size.&quot; He goes on &quot;...hopefully/eventually we will be able to incorporate the GPU, the graphics card itself, into the CPU.&quot; If like most users 4 cores is more than enough, even excessive, where is the benefit for the home user especially when such a small minority of applications can utilize multiple cores?
We're still having problems getting true x64 bit apps when the technology has been around for 10 years.
