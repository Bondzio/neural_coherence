1.1.1	I have a d-link dir-655 extreme router .	St
1.1.2	I am on comcast 20mps service I only get 65mb on wireless .	St
1.1.3	So I need help/tips on possibly improving that speed .	St
1.1.4	Also the router is located in the basement on the left side of the house in the back .	St
1.1.5	Upstairs to the far right front side I have a media player which gets a decent amount of wifi .	St
1.1.6	I am wondering how can I improve the wifi speed and coverage in my house .	St
1.1.7	I dont know if I should use a repeater , extender ?	Ques
1.1.8	I was suggested a repeater and locate it half way upstairs or downstairs ( below the upstairs media player ) or should I use another router for an extender/hotspot ( I think that is what I was told ) .	St
1.1.9	Please any help and information will help a lot !	St
1.1.10	!	St
1.2.1	All advice I read and give tell us that is not where it belongs unless you want speed and coverage issues .	St
1.2.2	Use some powerline bridge to get the router into the center of the home and it should be fine .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I ca n't put it in a middle of the house since .	St
1.3.2	The cable outlet is where the router is at right now .	St
1.3.3	I already thought about putting the router in the middle of the house .	St
1.3.4	Requires long cord from modem to router but that would seem more work with wires etc.. i just prefer if I can use another router or repeater .	St
1.4.1	Why ca n't we relocate the router ?	Ques
1.4.2	This would be the first time that trick did n't work .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Umm.. just re-read your first answer and I have no clue what is a powerline bridge .	St
1.5.2	I was thinking you meant relocate the router like for me to use a 100ft Ethernet cord from the modem to the router , placing the router in the middle of the house ( which would mean staying downstairs still but just in the middle ) to receive better wifi signal around the house .	St
1.6.1	May you please tell me more about powerline bridge and what you recommend how I set it up .	Sug
1.6.2	Also which powerline bridges are good ?	Ques
1.7.1	I plug one in the basement and move the ethernet to that unit .	St
1.7.2	I plug the other in a central location and the ethernet to the router .	St
1.7.3	It 's one of those basic things that places that sell them should be able to boil it down to 2 steps and then talk a little about the 2 phases in your AC system .	St
1.7.4	I 'll stop here with I 've yet to find a bad unit .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	Thanks you !	St
1.8.2	I will research more about them and look into getting some for my house .	St
