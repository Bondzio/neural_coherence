i have a personally built pc with amd 1.4ghtz, 2 hard drives, dvd burner, and broadband.
a few months ago a strange problem started occurring.
whenever i power-up the computer, within the first 5 minutes of it being on it will either freeze, automatically restart, or the screen will go black.
either way i have to totally restart the computer.
this problem can occur once, a couple times a day, or it can be a couple days before it happens again.
there are no viruses, and a brand new power supply.
any help would be appreciated.
