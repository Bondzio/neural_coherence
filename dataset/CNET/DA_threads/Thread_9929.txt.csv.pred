1.1.1	Hi friend , I need a big help .	St
1.1.2	My computer was infected by various spyware and viruses , so I saved all my data files ( ~18GB ) to an external hard drive before formatting my computer .	St
1.1.3	Now I am not able to retrieve any piece of my data When I tried to read the external hard drive , my computer does recognize the hard drive as drive F : , but then it took for ever to run an AUTORUN program .	St
1.1.4	When I disconnected the hard drive from my computer , the computer popped up a window saying that virus was found in F : \autorun.inf and the virus type was Trojan Horse .	St
1.1.5	It seems to me that the autorun file in the hard drive was infected by this virus , which kept me from reading the data .	St
1.1.6	I have tried many data recovery software which does n't modify the data in the hard drive .	St
1.1.7	But I have no success so far .	St
1.1.8	If you have any suggestions or ideas , please let me know .	Ques
1.1.9	I appreciate your help very much .	Polite
1.1.10	Thank you , Ashley	St
1.2.1	No you do n't have to install LINUX .	St
1.2.2	But you can use a LiveCD and get your files out of that drive ... You can also disable AUTORUN on that drive by holding down the SHIFT KEY when you plug it in .	St

1.3.1	Hi Bob , Thank you for your reply .	St
1.3.2	I have tried to disable the autoplay and the computer was able to display the data folder ( all my data is under this one single folder ) .	St
1.3.3	However , when I click to open the folder , it again took a long time .	St
1.3.4	I would hear the sound of reading hard drive , but after a while , when the reading sound stopped , the drive disappeared from 'My Computer ' window .	St
1.3.5	What do you mean by LiveCD approach ?	Ques
1.3.6	I appreciate your reply .	Polite

1.7.4	Ashley	St
1.8.1	How long is & quot ; forever & quot ; ?	Ques
1.8.2	Try to wait until it stops- what happen ?	Ques
1.8.3	Try to disable auto-run by pressing & quot ; SHIFT & quot ; as soon as you plug in the external drive for a few seconds or release when the disk activity light stops blinking .	St
1.8.4	Somehow , try to open the drive to see the contents .	St
1.8.5	Find the autorun file and delete it or rename .	St
1.8.6	Do likewise with any .inf files or file you do not reconize as yours .	St
1.8.7	These files are dropped by the virus .	St
1.8.8	Try safe mode to do the above .	St

1.11.1	Hi , I have download a Knoppix from the internet , and burned it to a CD using Roxio .	St
1.11.2	However , it is NOT bootable .	St
1.11.3	What could be the problem ?	Ques
1.11.4	I burned it as a data CD .	St
1.11.5	Thank you .	St
1.11.6	Ashley	St
1.12.1	You need to check it 's notes but most ISO images are created not as a data CD but from a Create CD from ISO menu .	St
1.12.2	Example at http : //www.download.com/Active-ISO-Burner/3000-2646_4-10612384.html Bob	St
1.13.1	Thank you .	St
1.13.2	I made the CD bootable but there is a new problem .	St
1.13.3	At the end of the booting process , the GUI is not properly displayed .	St
1.13.4	I ca n't read anything .	St
1.13.5	It seems the OS does n't support the video card I am using .	St
1.13.6	I am using the Knoppix version 5.1.1 .	St
1.13.7	Is it because the version is old ?	Ques
1.13.8	My desktop computer is 4 years old .	St
1.13.9	Thank you for your help .	St

1.14.1	http : //www.knoppix.net/wiki/Cheat_Codes NOTES HOW TO SPECIFY THE VIDEO MODE .	St
1.14.2	Try fb800x600 Bob	St
1.15.1	Since I am not able to view the GUI , I do n't know how to exit from the GUI and go back to the boot screen .	St
1.15.2	Could you please me how to do it ?	Ques
1.15.3	Also should the command I type in be like : knoppix fb800x600 Is it correct ?	Ques
1.15.4	Ashley	St
1.16.1	Unlike Windows we are booting from CD so no danger ...	St
1.16.2	Remember I do n't duplicate web pages here .	St
1.16.3	But you should try that command ...	Sug
1.17.1	... you have chosen to burn an ISO image ?	Ques
1.17.2	Making a data CD bootable ( in which the data is the ISO image file ) is not the same as burning an ISO image , whereby the ISO image file is broken up into its separate components .	St
1.17.3	The choice to & quot ; burn an ISO image & quot ; at the burning program does this automatically , and if the ISO image includes files to make the CD bootable , you need not do anything further .	St
1.17.4	KNOPPIX version 5.1.1 is the latest version .	St
1.17.5	However , there is a DVD version ( also 5.1.1 ) of 4G in size !	St
1.18.1	With all the help you provided , finally I am able to boot my computer with a Knoppix LiveCD .	St
1.18.2	However , I encountered the similar problem when reading my external hard drive .	St
1.18.3	It does recognize the hard drive and open the main folder in it .	St
1.18.4	Then after I click on the subfolder which contains most of my data files , it took a long time ( 5~8 minutes ) to try to read .	St
1.18.5	In the end , it gives up with a popup window saying something like 'it seems the folder ( or disk ) does n't exist any more ' .	St
1.18.6	Is it possible that the viruses cause this problem ?	Ques
1.18.7	I tried before to clean the external hard drive using Symantec Antivirus in Windows , but had no success ; The external drive simply disappeared from 'my computer ' window when I did that .	St
1.18.8	I am also considering to use Norton Data Recovery software , but I do n't know if it is safe and useful .	St
1.18.9	Anyone knows about that ?	Ques
1.18.10	Thank you .	St
1.18.11	Ashley	St
1.19.1	This means the drive data or surface has suffered damage .	St
1.19.2	It is now likely and my bet it is so that only drive data recovery houses will be able to get your files out .	St
1.19.3	Try http : //www.drivesavers.com Bob	St
1.20.1	So , you are not recommended to try Norton Data Recovery ?	Ques
1.20.2	Ashley	St
1.21.1	Symantec 's direction in products is why I never recommend them .	St
1.21.2	I noted Drive Savers but you have not made it clear that you were wanting to try more DIY recovery .	St
1.21.3	In fact the amount of steps it took for you get get a working Linux CD and not researching the video mode tells me it is likely best for you to head to data recovery centers now .	St
1.21.4	You could try the demo 's of ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY or GETDATABACK but I fear that it 's time to move to the usual solution .	Sug
