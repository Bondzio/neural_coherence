integrated are more flexible if your desktop or notebook has additional pcie slot or if u feel the integrated card not power enough can choose too much graphic cards i mean integrated if not mistaken is cpu + ram + motherboard using this to create integrated card since most cpu have integrated graphic cards too much options to choose what graphic cards you want if u don't like the integrated graphic card performance just buy graphic card or cards install driver some will enable integrate graphic card with graphic card or cards some will disable integrated graphic card
