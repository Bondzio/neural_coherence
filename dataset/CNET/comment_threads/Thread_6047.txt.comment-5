Golly gosh, I thank you sooo much for your interest and help.
I just this MINUTE walked in my front door from being out of town for 5 days.
(In Dallas-now back to New Orleans).
Will unpack all the dirty laundry tonight, wash, be too tired and finally get a flashlight and look at the back of the monitor tomorrow...lol.
Will let you know about the back asap.
Thank You and Good Karma Be With You!!
