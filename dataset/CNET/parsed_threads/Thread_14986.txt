<s> I'm thinking about building my own computer (basically, a new MOBO, CPU, RAM and PS), and basically want to just move everything over from the old one (DVD Drive/ CD-RW). </s>
<s> But, would it be possible to move the old HD (with OS and programs on it) over to the new MOBO and have it still work, or would I need a new/blank HD? </s>
<s> There is a tried and true method of moving W98, but you have to be very comfortable around computers to feel confident enough to do it, as it takes editing the registry. </s>
<s> As I cite below in a method to use WXP full to keep your settings, part of the method can be used to stop at W98. </s>

<s> Coming from Windows 98 to Windows XP, you would want to bring the old files and settings from the W98 disk to the WXP disk. </s>
<s> Many schemes are available to do this in the form of new software and of course Windows XP file transfer. </s>
<s> You could buy an upgrade version of Windows XP and do the trick but you would be left with that crippled copy. </s>
<s> Buy a full version of Windows XP and do the following. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Clone a copy of your Windows 98 disk to another disk using GHOST. </s>
<s> Take the Ghost copy of the disk and install it in your computer. </s>
<s> Fire the computer up, and holding down the f8 key, go into Safe Mode. </s>
<s> In safe mode, bring up the registry by hitting the start button, click on run and type regedit in the box and hit enter. </s>
<s> This brings up the registry. </s>
<s> Find the ENUM key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. </s>
<s> At the top of the box find edit and either delete the ENUM key or rename it. </s>
<s> It is best to rename it in case you have to go back. </s>
<s> This action wipes out all of the hardware knowledge of your drive, so that Windows XP will find the hardware and assign the proper drivers to it. </s>
<s> If you are going to use the same disk and hardware for the Windows XP, then you do not need to use the ENUM trick. </s>
<s> Skip to step 2. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Obtain a copy of Windows XP update from a friend. </s>
<s> You are going to use it as a temporary measure to maintain your files and settings. </s>
<s> Run the borrowed copy on your machine, putting in the required Serial Number when asked. </s>
<s> Fire up your machine and install the borrowed upgrade copy. </s>
<s> After Windows is finished and everything looks good, insert your Full copy of Windows XP in the CD while you are still in Windows. </s>
<s> Move to the CD under My Files and open your copy. </s>
<s> The screen will give you a choice. </s>
<s> Choose to install XP. </s>
<s> The screen then will come back and suggest that you upgrade the existing Windows. </s>
<s> Do this and you will place your copy of Windows XP over top of the borrowed copy and require your unique registration number (Serial Number). </s>
