<s> Reading and looking at http://www.amazon.com/FSP460-60GLC-Bestec-ATX-250-12Z-Supply-Replacement/dp/B001AO0MT4 tells me that this is a common ATX power supply. </s>
<s> That is, there are some thousand models that can replace this. </s>
<s> Here's one for the herd. </s>

<s> You want to look at the physical size and specs for Bestec model#. </s>
<s> Once you have that in hand, you compare to any similar or direct replacement PSU. </s>
<s> So be 100% sure the model# is what is stated on the decal/sticker located on the PSU. </s>
<s> Then do your search. </s>
<s> If as Robert states is correct, you maybe lucky and have a common ATX-12V type sized PSU, which many are generic to your needs. </s>
<s> BTW, having more wattage and/or connections won't hurt. </s>

<s> Thanks for that. </s>
<s> After all the PSU's I've replaced over the years, one of the best pieces of advice I found was to get a single rail when possible. </s>

<s> It's got an inexpensive PSU in it now and this one at $45 net will be worthwhile to have as a spare or a substitute if I decide to upgrade the system. </s>
