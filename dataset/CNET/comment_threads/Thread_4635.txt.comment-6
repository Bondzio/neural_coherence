Which motherboard are you using at the current time (manufacturer and model)?
This will help determine what upgrades are available for your system.

This company makes upgrade kits for a large number of Intel based systems.
I have had good luck with one of their upgrades for my old Socket 423 system and they do have kits for socket 478 systems.
The solution they offer consists of a special base to insert into your current socket, and then a new processor fits into the new base.
Check their site, and the configurator will tell you if they have an upgrade for your system.
