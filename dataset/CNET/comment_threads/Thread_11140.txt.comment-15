My personal thanks to &quot;Bob B,&quot; &quot;John Robie,&quot; and &quot;Coryphaeus!&quot; After all your great suggestions I went out and bought a new 2.0 USB/Firewire card and a 160GB LaCie external hard drive.
I figured that in order to avoid any &quot;heat&quot; problems and cut down on the number of times I have to open up my computer and fiddle with the &quot;inerds,&quot; I'd take the chickens way out and go for an external drive.
No sweat installing either of them and the XP system recognized and accepted both without incident!
So now I've happily transferred my seldom used programs, files, all my images and music over to the external and my C: drive has increased its free space from only a few GB's to almost 13GB!
Maybe it's just me, but it seems to be running much more briskly now!!
But after spending some money on it - I'd hope I'd be getting some fringe benefits along with the additional storage.
You guys have been a real help, and made me feel assured enough to try it on my own.
Thanks again I really appreciate your efforts!
