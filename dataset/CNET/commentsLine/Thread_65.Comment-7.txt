thanks for the help, and guidance, though i admit some of the specs on the parts confuse me, the numbers and such get all mixed in my head, i might be a lost cause... as for a budget, well i never thought about it, though i really should have, i guess with me being a part time cashier my budget is meager at best.
i was hoping to buy each part individually as i can afford each one, but i guess if i have doubts on comparability that wouldn't be best.
i have put together a pc before, though it was at school and only basic stuff really...
