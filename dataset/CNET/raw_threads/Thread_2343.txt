This unit comes with a 250 watt supply and Gateway only has an upgrade to 350watts. I have been advised that in order to install a new AGP video card, such as a 7600 or X1650, that I'll need a 450 watt supply. Gateway won't tell me so I thought one of you might know. The ccase is a mid-tower ATX style. Thanks.

Might double check and see if you see it. http://www.power-on.com/gateway.html Alternatively you could try http://www.pcpowercooling.com/home/ I didn't see anything for GATEWAY specifically but your unit may be generic and they may have a replacement...worth asking anyway.
