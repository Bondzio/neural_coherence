That's why the confusion. Do server CPUs run standard Windows OSs like Vista or is server software needed/required to run them? Will a Xeon processor run Vista Business for instance. Would Vista run on a board with dual CPU sockets like this one: http://www.nextag.com/Asus-DSBF-DE-Socket-542041814/prices-html Do stand PC OSs run with server equipment? This is a very basic question but I know very little about servers, that's why I ask.

Seams it will not run anything over 2.80 GHZ. The 920 has virtualization that I don't need. My price break was at $100.00. It has dropped below this amount now and seams to less available then a few months ago, so I'm moving on it before it is unavailable/obsolete. My CPU performance number is 4.7 in the Vista performance monitor. I would like to exceed 5. The upper limit is 6.0. I'll be moving the RAM up in the next few months to this: http://www.crucial.com/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=97014715A5CA7304 My current RAM is rated a 4.9 but I think I have more time on this so I'll wait on the RAMs. With these two additions I will have nearly maxed this PC out. Sometime in the future I would like to add a physics card but may need a new power supply to accommodate it first. My current PS is rated at 300 watts and I'm running at it's upper limit, more then likely crossing it's limit at times.

Tom's hardware says this about the 820 and 920 Pentium Ds: http://www23.tomshardware.com/cpu_2007.html?modelx=33&model1=899&model2=891&chart=442 For the cost I think the 915 is the best buy for our multi media needs. Multi media is our primary want/need for this PC. At some time in the future we hope to build a PC. For now this one will do but we want to get as much out of it as we can. Why settle for less?

For now I'm switching to a RAM memory up grade instead till I find a better price on the CPU. http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146567 There is a risk that I will not be able to find the chip at all if I wait, a risk I'm willing to take. I'm not expecting a big performance boost from this processor anyway so the price &quot;must&quot; be right, cheap.

This is after heat reductions of &gt;14C that I've been able to achieve using my own methods. Your lowered temperatures may have come from the &quot;enhanced speed step&quot; feature. An improvement I was hoping to get with the 915. In shot, improve performance and at the same time reduce operating temperature. Moving up from 90-nm to 65-nm will increase CPU operating temperature not decrease the operating temperature of the CPU. It does more work at the lower nms processing information more quickly. Increasing The GHZ pushes the information through more quickly. Like a water hose.......larger opening = lower nms, more pressure = more GHZ.

Now to the Intel specifications: http://processorfinder.intel.com/list.aspx?ProcFam=2112 Click on any you like as GHZ increase the higher the operating temperature allowed. Ummmm, wonder why this is? Could it be they get hotter? Once these maximum operating temperatures are reached many PC will literally stop/crash till the CPU cools down. What's not said or implied is that most PCs run poorly as they approach this maximum, think within 5C or so of maximum. Having experienced this myself I'd say this is true. Past the 920 processor little chances. At 920 and above the processors are simply factory overclocked. Frankly, I like your approach. This way is how we learn by getting to the root of things by doing this we strip away the opinion and get to the truth. Thanks for your time on this unfortunately, I can't do the same right now and give this the time, Yet, in large part I already have. Like I said I don't need the virtualization feature. My RAM has been shipped in a few days we'll see if your right about it not working on my PC. I bet it does. I think we've reached an impasse. We're in a loop.

TDP = &quot;The maximum amount of heat which a thermal solution must be able to dissipate from the processor *so that the processor will operate under normal operating conditions.*&quot; in other words, TDP is how much heat the cpu cooler has to be able to dissipate to ensure the cpu will function properly... it is not a temperature that the cpu runs at. page 82, table 26 of this document explains it plainly: http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumXE/datashts/31030607.pdf quote: 1. Thermal Design Power (TDP) should be used for processor thermal solution *design targets*. The TDP is not the maximum power that the processor can dissipate. 2. This table shows the maximum TDP for a given frequency range. *Individual processors may have a lower TDP*. There's an overlap for the 3.2-3.6ghz range because the later D0 stepping of the 900 series (which includes all 9x5 processors) runs cooler than the original B1 stepping. Thus any pentium d 900 series you purchase now will have a TDP of only 95W which is the same as the TDP of the lower speed 800 series. This is proven in your link: http://processorfinder.intel.com/list.aspx?ProcFam=2112 here's the 3.4ghz 950 D0 stepping, tdp=95W, tspec=63.4C: http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL9K8, and the 2.8ghz 820, tdp=95W, tpec=64.1C: http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL88T . By design, the 900 series is no hotter than the 800 series and in real world use a 3.4ghz 900 series runs cooler than the 820. all pentium Ds will throttle back if they overheat (about 71c). as you said, the faster a processor is the more heat it generates. but the cpu cooler removes (dissipates) that heat. so, a faster processor will make a heatsink/fan work harder but if the cooler is designed properly and can meet the tdp spec, the cpu will not overheat and will not slow down. my 945 with an arctic freezer pro never goes above 61C, *never* throttles, and *never* sounds like the jet engine that spun up when the 820 got busy. throttling is seperate from eist (enhanced intel speedstep). eist slows down a cpu based on load to *avoid heat buildup*. so if the cpu load is low, the cpu may slow down by 30% or more. eist is adjustable and can be disabled; throttling cannot. no intel processors are 'factory overclocked'. intel has a strict 'no overclocking' policy and will not warrant any processor that is run outside its stated operating frequencies. intel tests each cpu to determine what speed it can reliably run at. once that speed is identified, the speed is then programmed into a multiplier on the cpu package (the mini-chips on the bottom of the processor: http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/cheapdualcore/pentium_d.jpg ). so a 3.4ghz pd 945 is running within spec and is fully warranteed by intel to last just as a long as 2.8ghz cpu. one last link: http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=1988&page=20 quote: Intel's second generation of dual core processors is much better than its first. The 65 nanometer Presler core is still quite an energy hog, but it doesn't produce as much heat and thanks to the larger L2 cache, is clock for clock faster than the Intel Pentium D 800 series processors. The Intel Pentium D 940 is the ideal processor for a Socket 775 user who's looking to upgrade. The 2MB L2 cache gives it a performance boost over the Pentium D 800-series, and the smaller 65nm manufacturing process means less noise and heat to deal with.

From your post: &quot;they emphasized that it requires specific processor and case cooling requirements.&quot; I am familiar with these specifications and have in fact brought this PC into compliance with them. The CPU cooler did work, two additional fans worked but the duct they recommend did nothing. We had added one of the fans prior to becoming aware of there recommendation, to assist in the cooling of our graphics card and Ethernet Adapter. In my opinion they could review these again. The sum total gain of there over all recommendation was in actually maybe &gt;2C. The combined total peak/dust free gain was 8C including the improvements I made; the CPU cooler and the additional fan. Neither fan is standard PC box fan. This might be of interest to you.

There seams to be a period of adjustment for most hardware installation, this observation is holding true for this RAM. I ran the Vista, &quot;performance monitor and tools&quot; application soon after the installation and no change occurred; still 4.9 but none the less, it is running faster and we have seen a &quot;good&quot; maybe 15-20% improvement in our video quality and smoother on line SL use. We will give it a little more time for a full evaluation. This time tomorrow we should know for sure. Unlike what has been suggested we have had no problems of any kind, none.
