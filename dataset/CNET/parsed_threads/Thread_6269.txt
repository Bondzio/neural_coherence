<s> You guys always give me good advice when I need it so here goes. </s>
<s> I have 2 computers set up on a Linksys wireless router(befw11s4) with DSL. </s>
<s> The second computer is continually losing DSL. </s>
<s> My question is this: can we keep the main computer on the router as it is now and then run a cable from the router to the second computer, instead of using the wireless or do I need to buy a wired router to do this?? </s>
<s> I see the router has a few plug in's, so I'm thinking this can be done?? </s>
<s> But I want to make sure. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If the router has multiple ethernet ports to use, then a hard wired connection to the problem machine can narrow down the possible trouble areas. </s>
<s> Use the port. </s>
