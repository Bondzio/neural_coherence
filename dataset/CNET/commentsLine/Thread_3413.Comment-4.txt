i'm with willy on this -- if this machine were a client's/customer's, you'd not even hestitate to say it's time to scrap the main board.
even if it were your employer's, your hourly wage is worth more than the board is.
in the photo, it's obviously a mess.
the card is reasonably nice, was once quite nice, in terms of computing power.
but the mobo isn't.
finding a replacement local could be tough, but if you gooogle or ebay, the price for an agp board isn't much more than what you'd pay for shipping it.
