1.1.1	Ok , I have two desktop pc 's that I want to share an sbc dsl connection with .	St
1.1.2	Both pc 's are running win xp pro.What i want to know is what is the difference between a Switch and a Router.Will both let two pc 's on the internet at the same time ? Is there an advantage to using one or the other.I have a Linskys 4 port wired Router and a Netgear 4 port wired Switch , I just need to know what is the best option .	St
1.1.3	Thanks Dan-n	St
1.2.1	If your DSL modem is actually a modem/router ( some are and some are n't ) then you should be able to just use the switch .	St
1.2.2	If not , then you should use the Linksys router .	St
1.2.3	Even if the modem is also a router , you could still use the Linksys , but you would need to set the modem as a bridge ( turning off its routing capabilities ) and thus letting the Linksys do all the routing .	St
1.2.4	( This is more complicated than simply using the switch ) .	St
1.2.5	So , you need to check what model modem you have and then check out its specs to see whether it functions as a router or is just a modem .	Sug
