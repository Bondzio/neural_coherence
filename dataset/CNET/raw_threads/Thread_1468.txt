I see many folk wanting to replace their laptops with these and learning an expensive lesson in the process. If I were to gather up the current best tablets, I have a list but as it's personal, you pick the best for you. iPad, Kindle Fire HD, Slate and the many other tablets means a lot of confusing choices for consumers.

Available from December 2012. You can't imagine to have your employees working on a cheap no-name chinese tablet, can you? You want to give them the best, or you wouldn't have asked for it. Kees

Hi Friend, My Suggestion is better to buy Google Nexus 7 Tablet...which is developed by ASUS Hardware Motherboard. Nexus 7 is designed to go wherever you go - and now with up to 32GB of storage and the ability to connect to mobile data networks - Nexus 7 can take you even further. Nexus 7 can now operate on more than 200 GSM providers worldwide.
