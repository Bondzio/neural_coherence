4136	0	10072	116469	NR	michael connor	1/30/04 2:18 PM	1.07547228E12	Printer will not print any text..	I have an Epson Stylus PHOTO 825 printer that will only print graphic images but NO text. For example, if I try to print an email all the framing is printed OK but the text area is left blank. It also will not print any Word, WordPad or Notepad documents. I just started having this problem a few days ago. I've gone over all the preferences and settings on the printer and everything seems enabled. Anybody have any ideas about this??
