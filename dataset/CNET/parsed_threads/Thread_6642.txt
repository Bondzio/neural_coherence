<s> Does somebody know how to deal with this problem? </s>
<s> I have a BENQ external cd-rw usb device and the notebook recognizes it as an USB Optical Storage. </s>
<s> I tried it in a desktop and it does the same thing. </s>
<s> I cant even install the driver because it does not found the device or because windows looks for a driver of a USB data storage. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance </s>
<s> Only 2 versions of Windows might see it as a CDRW. </s>
<s> All others see such as drive as &quot;USB Optical Storage.&quot; To use the drive I add software such as you find at http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the reply, but I do not see how can a burning software remedy this problem. </s>
<s> The site does not have any help on this problem and it seems that the software hasnt been tested on any external Benq yet. </s>
<s> Windows (most versions) does not know a CDRW drive from a CD drive. </s>
<s> Many are unaware of this and fall into a trap of &quot;it shouldn't be this way&quot; for some period of time. </s>
<s> I'll wait for you to figure that out. </s>
<s> In the meantime, if you want to create a CDR or CDRW disk, the software I noted is free to try out. </s>

<s> The problem is that the device was working ok, and after the same cable was used to connect a digital camera with the computer, it did not work anymore since it recognizes the drive as optical storage and does not read any kind of cd. </s>
<s> It seems to me that the device does not communicate at all with the computer (it must be it since there is no driver for the cd-rw drive). </s>
<s> While I may wonder why you didn't write this in your first post, I now just ask you to ignore any reply up to this point and hope someone else sees a solution. </s>
<s> To me the drive sounds dead or you have an USB 1.1 cable and it should an USB 2.0 cable. </s>

<s> I apologize for not being explicit in the beginning, I thought the fact that the computer recognizes the drive as optical storage would be enough, hoping that somebody else got the same problem. </s>
<s> I hope it is just a cable problem. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> The detail was needed since most Windows would ID such a drive as ... such. </s>
<s> And I would see nothing wrong. </s>
