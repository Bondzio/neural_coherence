4612	0	236296	2417705	NR	maxy1101	3/1/07 10:29 AM	1.17274494E12	Please Help	I have an Emachine T3112 AMDSempron Processor 3100+; 1.80 GHZ, 1600 MHZ FSB; 256 KB L2 Cache; 80 GB HD; 256 MB DDR Memory (plan to upgrade this to a gig soon) current video card is a S3 Unichrome 3D with an AVG slot available. 56K Modem. Am running Windows XP Home Edition Version 2002 with Service Pack 2. I believe the graphic card shares memory as I only show 192 or ram. I read the CPUs on the Emachines are crap with low wattage(wish I had known that before I bought it.) What I am looking for is advice on purchasing a gaphic card that will allow me to do some gaming without straining this machine. I would be satisfied to play older games if needed. Would a card like Nvidia 5500 be okay for this computer? Any other suggestions? Any and all help will be very appreciated. Like I cited above I plan on adding ram to the machine before installing a new card. Thanks, Maxy

Once you narrow it down...double check the PSU requirement and go from there. Re RAM...check you system DOCs carefully and by all means look at sites like CRUCIAL.COM. Sometimes it best to add RAM in pairs to maximize system performance. Before you go too far...check to see if buying a new unit may be better/cheaper than upgrading...adding RAM, adding new video card and maybe a new PSU. VAPCMD

Yes it is a Sempron which is the stripped down AMD CPU, just as a Celeron is a stripped down Pentium. They run just fine for most applications [the majority of low priced systems use Celerons or Semprons. Yes more memory should be a big help. Do you mean that an AGP slot for a video card [not AVG] is available. If so great, but don't get confused that most new video cards are PCI Express. Check your BIOS if you can disable the onboard video, thus witha plug in card you will get the shared memory back also.

Even though Crucial says I can add different size memory modules side by side I will probably match them. BTW are they a reputable company in your opinion? I know Pitstop recommends them. This computer is only about a year old and except for gaming has served me okay. Needs more ram but other than that no major complaints so I am by no means ready for a new machine yet. I think what I probably meant to ask in my last post was: What is a good graphic card upgrade for the Emachine T3112 based on the specs and information I have included?

As far as the CPU on this machine I guess I was just relating stuff I had read on other forums. Believe me I'm no expert on computers. If I was I wouldn't be asking so many questions. LOL. Would you be kind enough to tell me how to check the Bios to see if the card can be disabled? I have never ventured in there. And, thanks for your feedback.

The option only happens during early parts of the booting process. Many computers show a message &quot;to enter set-up&quot; hit {they then give the name of the key]. As an example for most non proprietary computers it is the DEL key. Hopefully the manual will tell you what key to hit and when. Surely someone else in these forums will know. Just realize that even though the actual function you want is set-up, it is usually referred to as the BIOS or as the CMOS. They're really slightly different terms but not worth worrying about is you get into that Place. LOL
4612	6	236296	2417838	2417705	ramarc	3/1/07 12:48 PM	1.17275328E12	how did you determine you have an agp slot available?	the emachines web site does not indicate any graphics slot is available for the T311x series. http://www.emachines.com/support/product_support.html?cat=Desktops&subcat=T-Series&model=T3112 for other models, such as the T312x series, it does indicate if a slot is available.

As mentioned ading a high power video card may require increasuing the Power Supply capability, and then going to the AMD Athlon CPU and on and on. Then cooling problems arise within the small case. In this case the lower power consuming Sempron is an asset, but for higher level gaming a detriment. Gaming and Video processing place the greatest demands on computers, thus low price and power are at odds, although there are now some fairly good gaming systems available for $800 or so.

4612	11	236296	2417849	2417853	ramarc	3/1/07 1:11 PM	1.17275466E12	ok, some suggestions	don't waste money on the fx series. get a geforce 6 or 7 series or a radeon x15xx or better. $120: geforce 7600gs http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121020 $115: radeon x1650pro (rebate available, recommended) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814161053 $110: geforce 6800xt (rebate available) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814141038 $90: radeon x1550 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102081 $56: geforce 6200 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127268

4612	13	236296	2417997	2417774	VAPCMD	3/1/07 4:43 PM	1.17276738E12	Crucial is absolutely reputable in my experience and	if you buy from them for your exact PC....they guarantee compatability. There are other sources that carry RAM from Crucial too....like Newegg.com. Re the GPU....Did you look at Tomshardware.com ????? VAPCMD
4612	14	236296	2418036	2417997	maxy1101	3/1/07 4:54 PM	1.17276804E12	Yes, I did check Tomshardware	I am going to put in order for ram at crucial tomorrow. Even though they sayI can mix sizes I think I will get a set just in case. Tomshardware was super interesting. I put the link in favs. Thanks for helping me. I just want to make the right decision and not buy a card that is too strong for my small computer. If the card is better than I have I will be happy. Have a good night. Catch ya later. Maxy
