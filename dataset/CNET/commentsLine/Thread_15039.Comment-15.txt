if you've got the drive bays... you can eliminate the external case and usb/esata cables; handling, etc.
my sense ...drives are a whole lot more reliable when used as internals than as externals.
just read the cnet forums....they're full of tearful please about problems with external hdds.
good luck vapcmd
