1.1.1	ok so i just bought the asus n56dp-dh11 its advertised and has a sticker on it stating that it has the amd radeon hd7730m gpu, but when I look up the display driver it says it only has a amd radeon 7660G.	St
1.1.2	I checked the display drivers through device manager and there are two, the 7660G and another that just says 7000m series.	St
1.1.3	does it switch to the 7730m when gaming?	St
1.2.1	If the seller and ASUS won't answer this, get your money back.	St
1.2.2	I can't tell if this is the same issue discussed before but with the ATI series the exact names change with the amount of ram and more.	Sug
1.2.3	So the &quot;CORE GPU&quot; may indeed be the 7660G but in a laptop where it is clocked down a little it's marketing name would be the hd7730m.	St
1.2.4	This could upset a consumer and for a consumer my advice is to return product where support is lacking.	Ques
1.2.5	Again, there's a good reason for this.	Polite
1.2.6	As to the switch.	St
1.2.7	It should.	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
