Google(for example) for bad caps, but inspect the mtrbd. for leaking, distorted or bulging caps(capacitors). Since, you have a 1.8Mhz system that suggests you had it for awhile as that's dated and/or been around. In that time the PSU has aged and possibly on its last legs. The bad caps is known problem from bad manufacture of caps. In either case, replace, I suggest the PSU, first unless you see bad caps. tada -----Willy

The final act of a dying system. I can't guarantee the new PSU will fix it, it's just a course of action to take when the system won't power-ON. All too often when a burnt PSU as you say, it could very well weaken or stress or outright take another compoment or device with it, if not now, later. try: www.badcaps.com for examples. YES, a bad caps situation can be corrected, but only if you're capable and/or allow a local source to fix it. If outside repair, it maybe more practical to just buy another mtrbd.. for money better spend. tada -----Willy
