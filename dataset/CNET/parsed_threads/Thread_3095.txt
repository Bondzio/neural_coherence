<s> Hey guys. </s>
<s> I have a question. </s>
<s> I am currently working a on compaq presario 7922, Win 98 not sure on the processor because its not mine. </s>
<s> The problem is the monitor displays nothing. </s>
<s> As soon as you boot the machine the monitor green light flashes and then turns amber. </s>
<s> I figured that the integrated vid card went bad because the monitor works on other machines. </s>
<s> I install an extra vid card I had but this didnt fix the issue. </s>
<s> So I dig a little deeper. </s>
<s> I check the power supply just to make sure the system is getting the power it needs and it does. </s>
<s> So the power supply seems to be ok. </s>
<s> I noticed that the keyboard lights doesnt light up as the system boots up (system boots up == all cables connected and fans/tower lights are fine). </s>
<s> Now the issue could be a mobo problem, but I'm not 100% sure on this. </s>
<s> This is just another thing that it may be. </s>
<s> Speaking of the lights not flashing, whenever I unplug the keyboard while the system is on, you can see the keyboard light come on and then right back off. </s>
<s> So it seems that the mobo is &quot;somewhat&quot; working. </s>
<s> I also suspected the Hard Drive because the windows logon doesnt sound when booting guess the sound is not muted because the user never mutes the sound. </s>
<s> Back to the keyboard, I also tried holding hold a key during the bootup to see if it would get a keyboard error. </s>
<s> That about all the things i have tried. </s>
<s> Can anyone give any suggestions or what youe think. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> in the BIOS before you tried the plug in video card??? </s>
<s> Does it seem to be booting normally [except no video]. </s>
<s> Any chance that the CMOS battery is bad, thus preventing successful POST / boot?? </s>
<s> By the &quot;power it needs&quot; you mean that the main 5 volts is in spec, the 3.3 volts is in spec, the 12 volts is in spec, and the PowerOK signal changes state shortly after the main rails are turned on. </s>
<s> Re errors, remembeber that in the BIOS, one can set it to not show any errors. </s>
<s> Thus maybe why the keyboard test didn't work. </s>
<s> Well, I can't disable the onboard card because I cant see on the monitor to do it. </s>
<s> I did change the cmos battery and still nothing. </s>
<s> I also connected the hard drive to a different machine and it boots and the monitor displays compaq. </s>
<s> I also tried another hard drive in the machine that is having the issue and nothing happens. </s>
<s> If you have an old PCI video card laying around, you may want to give that a try. </s>
<s> It will usually disable the on-boad when you put in another card. </s>
<s> That's my best suggestion. </s>
<s> I have already done that. </s>
<s> I put in the pci card and it's still doing the same thing. </s>
<s> Wouild any other try to help/ </s>
