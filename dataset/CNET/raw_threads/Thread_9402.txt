When my computer boots it loads three programs. After it boots, I checked the System status and noted that only about 40% of the installed 256 MB memory was available (i.e., 60% was being used by the start up programs)....so I decided to double the memory. I checked HP website for applicable RAM and then installed the recommendation of HP upto the max amount allowed by this PC (512 MB). Once installed, I checked the System again upon booting up and the computer recognizes/sees the RAM....but it still says only about 40% of the installed 512 MB RAM is available...as if the computer can see the additional RAM but it isn't using it. Any ideas on how to solve my problem? Thanks...

The MEMORY ARTICLES at http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm should help you understand how Windows uses memory. Such memory, if not used by an application will eventually be used to cache hard disk data or some other dll. Bob

As Rob stated, the O/S will find a use for the extra ram you've given it. Whether that be for cacheing hard disk data or whatever. Generally, the more ram you have the better, it may not show that in the % being used, but you may find a marked system performance increase because the O/S generally has to rely less on the pagefile or &quot;virtual ram&quot; on your hard disk. Reading and writing to and from physical ram is drmatically faster than to and from the hard disk. Simply put, the more ram you have the more the computer will use because if it goes to the physical ram looking for something and doesn't find it there, it'll look in the &quot;virtual ram&quot; on the hard disk, decreasing the time performance for that function. The more that can be loaded into the physical ram the better.
