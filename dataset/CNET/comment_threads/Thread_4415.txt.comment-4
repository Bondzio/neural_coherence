I can give router configuration for D-LINK 615 model Step 1: Disable SIP Application Layer Gateway 1)log into the webpage of your router and click on Advanced and then Firewall Settings 2)uncheck the box next to SIP under the Application Layer Gateway.
3) Save Settings and reboot the router.
No one can answer your question until you exactly tell the router model.
If you do require the solution urgently try to go for your local network support service provider who can communicate with you quickly.
This might help you more.
