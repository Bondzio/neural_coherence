1.1.2	I have a P4 system with an Ausus P4P800-VM motherboard based on the Intel 865 Chipset .	St
1.1.3	It came with a sound card onboard .	St
1.1.4	Now I would like to add an additional sound card ( any one ) to my system .	St
1.1.5	My Questions are 1 ) Is it Possible to have both the cards working simultaneously 2 ) Would it cause any performance losses to the motherboard ?	Ques
1.1.6	I would really appreciate your help in this regard ! !	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If you use Windows , then not any old sound card will offer dual sound card usage .	St
1.2.2	There is hope for this in Linux , but you did n't tell .	St
1.2.3	If you use Windows , the answer will be no .	St

1.4.1	Windows does n't offer a system to route sound from an application to a specific card .	St
1.4.2	If it did , this would have made for some very interesting applications of the PC today .	St
1.4.3	Since you do n't run Linux , then it becomes a costly endeavor with cards or devices like http : //www.protools.com/products/digi002/systems/002hw.cfm and software to match .	St
