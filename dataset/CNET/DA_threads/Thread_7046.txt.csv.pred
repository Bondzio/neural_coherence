1.2.1	your new pc will have different hardware and need different low-level drivers, so windows probably won't even start.	St

1.3.1	The XP license is only good for one computer.	St
1.3.2	A full REATIL XP license allows you to install XP on a different computer, but it must be removed from the old one.	St
