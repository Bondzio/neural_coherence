i had the same problem with my epson all in one dx4200 device.
i could copy and print but not scan.
i have tried everything, from removing background processes, to playing with control panel, getting a new cable, chatting with epson etalk support etc.
nothing worked.
then i installed one usb card on one of my pci slots.
it worked.
it's not the usb ports that have problems, because i use microsoft wireless mouse on it and a usb card reader which work fine, but those epson drivers which were definately poorely written.
