i have a hp a450n and i just added stick of 512 ram so now my im up to 1gb and i also added a new graphics card, a gefore 7600gs.
my problem is that when i play a game of any kind, some kind of box comes up saying something about i need more power in order to fun the card properly or something like that.
so i was wonder if i need a new power supply.
the one i have right now is 250w.
i was think about something around 400w becuase later on i might want to do more upgrading.
and i also want to know which kind i should get so that it complies with my system.
