<s> hey guys, I'm just about to buy a computer system that consists of the following components and was having trouble deciding on which video card to choose. </s>
<s> The basic specs of the computer are: Asus A8N-SLi Motherboard AMD Dual Core 3800+ CPU 1024mb DDR-533 Memory 200 gig Western Digital Hard Drive 19&quot; Widescreen LCD Monitor 16x Liteon Dual Layer DVD-RW I was originally going to go for the nVidia GeForce 6600GT 256mb PCI-Express Graphics Card. </s>
<s> However I can upgrade to the GeForce 6800 XT 256mb PCI-Express video card very cheaply. </s>
<s> I was just wondering whether it was worth going to the 6800XT and whether it is a good card? </s>
<s> Or am I better off sticking with the good old 6600GT? </s>
<s> I may also be able to stretch my budget to afford the GeForce 6800GS 256mb PCI-Express Card, but would laying out the extra money for the 6800GS be worth it considering I am on a budget, or am i better off going the budget route and sticking with the 6600GT? </s>
<s> I am doing a computing and multimedia degree at university (college) so I will mainly be using the computer for internet, typing documents, browsing the web, burning CD''s/DVD's, Java programming etc. </s>
<s> I do play games occasionally but not all the time. </s>
<s> Any help is much appreciated as I am leaning towards the 6600GT but was wondering if there was a better option. </s>
<s> Cheers Benny </s>
<s> as it is better to stay in budget, you might want to buy an overclocked version for a speed boost. </s>
<s> And then maybe later on throw in another one. </s>
<s> I wouldn't choose the XT because the GS can be had for a little more, and the clocks are different. </s>
<s> If you can save up the cash, go for the GS, if not the GT is fine. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ P.S. </s>
<s> Remember: You can always OC the cards, unlock pipelines, and even throw in another. </s>
<s> Take a look at the X1600pro and XT cards. </s>
<s> Very appealing and comparable to Nvidia 6600GT and 6800XT. </s>
<s> Good price too. </s>
<s> 6800gs good to lay out money but no greater than $175 </s>
<s> hello, well I think I have finally decided on what combination I am going to go with. </s>
<s> I have decided to just go with the GeForce 6600GT 256mb graphics card. </s>
<s> I had a look at the Asus motherboard that is the next model down from mine the A8N-E, which costs AUD$167. </s>
<s> THis has no firewire and if I was to buy an add in card which would probably cost AUD$30, this would put it above the price of the Asus A8N-SLi (AUD$189) which has firewire onboard. </s>
<s> However people keep on telling me SLi is not worth having so the DFi Lanparty UT Ultra D is only AUD$222 which is only an extra $33 on top of the A8N-SLi. </s>
<s> I have heard good things about the Lanparty series of boards so I think the base specs of my pc will be: DFi Lanparty UT Ultra D AMD Dual Core 3800+ CPU 1024mb DDR-533 Memory 200 gig Western Digital Hard Drive 19'' Widescreen LCD Monitor 16x Liteon Dual Layer DVD-RW GeForce 6600GT 256mb What do you guys reckon of this, Cheers Benny </s>
<s> not unless u have an am2 mobo and processor? </s>
