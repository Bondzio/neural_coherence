i have the hp 8250 and had some what the same problem when i first got it.
right click the 8250 in the control panel.
click printing preference.
click color, which should be the last tab on the right.
click advanced color settings.
you should be able to adjust the colors to pretty much what you want.
i was printing a lot of photos of people and couldn't get the skin tones right until i set the the color managment to colorsmart/srgb.
i am taking wedding photos now for a little extra money and picked up a epson stylus photo r380 and if people want a print, i use that printer over the 8250 because of the quality of the pictures.
