<s> For occasional home printing needs what company has the cheapest in term of $ cost ie replacement cartridges? </s>
<s> The cheapest up front costs on an everyday basis are generally the store brands of paper and cartridges. </s>
<s> Staples, OfficeMax, etc., have their own. </s>
<s> Sometimes there are special sales on name brand items. </s>
<s> I prefer to wait and stock up then. </s>
<s> Now, a lower cartridge cost does not guarantee that you will get as many usable pages of print. </s>
<s> Bought an Epson printer some 4 years ago; thus got introduced to high ink-cartridge prices and chips on cartridges (to prevent refilling). </s>
<s> There are &quot;work-arounds&quot; available to re-use the same, refilled cartridges again, but they are cumbersome. </s>
<s> Did dozends of refills on a couple of black cartridges, but the print-head finally clogged and could not be &quot;cleared&quot; (maybe as claimed by Epson, because of using &quot;off-brand&quot; inks). </s>
<s> Because of high cost of a &quot;shop-repair&quot; / cleaning of the heads I decided to look around for alternates. </s>
<s> Found a Canon &quot;remanufactured&quot; printer for $ 50, bought it, since the cartridges in it were worth the cost! </s>
<s> Also &quot;lucked out&quot; on several features that came with the printer: each color has its own cartidge (my earlier Epson had 3 colors combined in one cartrige, making replacment necessary each time only one of the colors ran out!!! </s>
<s> --- except when doing refilling). </s>
<s> The Canon does not use the chip on the cartridges, allowing hazzle-free refilling. </s>
<s> The cartridges are only half &quot;sponge&quot; and half liquid-reservoir (while most others are completely filled with &quot;sponge&quot;), thus they are running longer, before replacement / refilling is necessary. </s>
<s> Finally, the printer has a &quot;user-replaceable&quot; print-head assembly, which is available as &quot;re-built&quot; via the Internet, allowing home-replacement in case of failure, rather than shop-repair, that would have been needed with the Epson, with its &quot;built-in&quot; print-heads. </s>
<s> All these features make Canon printers using the &quot;BCI-3e&quot; cartridges and replaceable print-head assemblies a very interesting and cost-efficient printer. </s>
