I just recently upgraded everything but my GPU which is the Nvidia GeForce GT 520.
My screen now randomly flickers, and makes the sound as if a usb has been unplugged.
I'm running Windows 8, as I was on my last PC and it never did such thing.
I tried the latest drivers for the card, and even some previous versions and nothing has fixed this.
Gaming seems to make it happen just a bit more frequently, and sometimes it minimizes the game and flashes non-stop, resulting in a reboot.
Other system components are i5 3570k 8gb DDR3 RAM, 1TB HDD, Any advice would be great because I'm at a loss.
Thanks.
