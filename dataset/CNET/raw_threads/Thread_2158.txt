I'd like to get a wireless webcam so I don't have to have my computer on all the time to have the cam running. If I get a wireless webcam can I view a stream of what is going on in my house from somewhere else or do I need to have server space somewhere else first? I'm leaving on a vacation soon so I'd like to set one up asap if possible. Thanks!

There can be issues with wireless set ups, proximity to router, etc. so before you do this, get a bit of advice on what is best to use for your application.

Let me lead with just one. http://www.amazon.com/Foscam-FI8918W-Wireless-Camera-Viewing/dp/B0046710G6 It's not a bad unit but you are going to be ready to learn a bit about networking. If any maker tells you &quot;nothing for you to learn about this&quot; they lied. It's not hard stuff but what you want is out there and about this price. Bob
