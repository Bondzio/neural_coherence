Assuming that you loaded the printer software it should appear in ADD REMOVE PROGRAMS in control panel and should be removable from there.
If you find it and can remove it (from control panel) try reinstalling the software from the CD.
When you said test page, from where did you print the page?
If you can run a test print from WORD PAD or NOTE PAD, the printer is functional, that is a very easy test to run.
If not, back to square one.
