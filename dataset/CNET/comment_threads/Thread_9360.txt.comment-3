I can't interact with the external HDD at all when it's plugged into my XP pc.
The &quot;delete partition&quot; option and all others are greyed out in Disk Management when I right click on it.
But, unlike my two internal hard drives, this one has little diagonal grey lines through it's section of the lower right pane, and it reads &quot;Healthy (GPT Protective Partition)&quot; instead of &quot;Healthy (Active).&quot;
