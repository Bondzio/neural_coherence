You're going to want to know which security method you will be using.
It appears that today's thinking is that WPA2 is desired as the minimum.
Some of the bargain/closeout devices seem to offer WPA but not WPA2.
You could also go USB as these are portable.
There are mixed reviews as to whether a fixed card or USB device works best.
I've used both without serious issues.
