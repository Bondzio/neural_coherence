<s> Somewhere I think I heard it is just a software update? </s>
<s> Thank you, Billy </s>
<s> If there is a sofware update, you'll find it noted at http://www.usbman.com but the only reason I think the urban legend lives on is that we all wish it was a pure software update. </s>
<s> If you have a desktop, USB 2.0 cards start at under 10 bucks at newegg.com and compgeeks.com Best of luck with that! </s>

<s> This may be bad form to interject like this, but I am impressed w/your responses I've read (on numerous forums--don't you ever sleep?). </s>
<s> You appear to know what you're talking about, you're concise, and able to keep it understandable. </s>
<s> Even I can understand most of your responses. </s>
<s> While I don't imagine you're in it for the recognition, I think you deserve a &quot;thanks&quot; for services rendered. </s>
<s> Consider this one. </s>
<s> I do sleep. </s>
<s> And I use Mozilla that helps automate loading up about 1/2 the forums with just 2 clicks. </s>
<s> Then it's a breeze to see what's up in the forums I read. </s>
<s> I'm able to look around inbetween programming, design sessions and ... meetings. </s>

<s> Could anyone tell me what is involved in the upgrade. </s>
<s> USB1 TO USB2 The reason for upgrade is to allow me to transfer my old camcorder films to CD or DVD via &quot;dazzle digital video creator&quot; software which is still to be purchased. </s>
<s> THANK YOU IAN </s>
<s> You need to open your computer's case to find out if you have an empty PCI slot. </s>
<s> Your USB 2.0 card will come in the form of a PCI card that you insert into an unused PCI slot in your computer's motherboard. </s>
<s> After you insert the card, start up your computer. </s>
<s> You need to install the software driver that came with the card. </s>
<s> If the card came with no driver, Windows will find your card and may try to install a software driver for you. </s>
<s> If you need a driver, go to the card manufacturer's website and download a driver to install. </s>
<s> The best thing to do is follow the instructions that come with your PCI USB 2.0 card. </s>
<s> Even if you don't have an empty PCI slot, you can get a USB 2.0 COMBO card. </s>
<s> I think your computer has 3 PCI slots. </s>
<s> If they are all filled and one of them has, say, a PCI Network Interface Card in it, you can replace your PCI Network Interface Card with a combo card that has USB 2.0 ports and a network cable port. </s>
<s> Also, if you like to plug devices into the front of your computer instead of the back, get a card with an internal USB 2.0 port on it. </s>
<s> This will allow you to run a USB 2.0 connection to the front of your computer with ease. </s>
<s> I see you use a camcorder. </s>
<s> If you purchase a new camcorder, it will likely have use a Firewire (IEEE 1394) output to make a direct connection to your computer. </s>
<s> So you might want to consider a ''PCI USB 2.0 and IEEE 1394 combo card'' with internal USB and Firewire ports. </s>
<s> As an example, the following card has three external USB 2.0 and one internal. </s>
<s> It also has two external IEEE 1394 and one internal: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16815106004 </s>
<s> I am so sorry... </s>
<s> Thanks so much for your note. </s>
<s> Now if... </s>
<s> I could just cut back on the meetings.... </s>
<s> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION IAN </s>
