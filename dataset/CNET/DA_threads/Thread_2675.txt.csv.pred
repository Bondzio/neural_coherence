1.1.1	Hi and please answer these questions I have a Dell Inspiron 530s ( 2009 Model ) with specs of Intel 2 duo 2.53ghz , 500GB Hard Drive , 2GB of ram .	St
1.1.2	And I 'm not sure how much ram it can hold and if it takes DDR , DRR2 , DDR3 , ram because i am looking at buying a 8GB of ram that is DDR3 and i want to make sure its the right kind before i buy it and the other thing is that if i can put a Intel core i7 with 3.40GHz and with a Intel HD Graphics 4000 go into the motherboard or do I need to upgrade the motherboard .	St
1.1.3	So please answer these questions I really need the info .	St
1.2.1	and the Intel core i7 has a H2 socket	St
1.3.1	No ... ... you can not put 8GB of ram on that machine .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=Inspiron % 20530s & Cat=RAM No ... you can not put an I7 on that mobo .	St
1.3.3	If you change the mobo to accept an I7 your Dell OS will no longer function .	St
1.3.4	That means you get to go buy a new copy of Windows .	St
1.4.1	Tell what you need to boost the machine to do .	St
1.4.2	I can see this running a few games if it had the RAM maxed out and a better video card but what you asked about the CPU , motherboard would cost as much as a new PC .	St

1.5.1	Hi If you upgrade your PC then it require all the changed to your motherboard & it takes more costly .	St
1.5.2	So i recommended to purchase a new motherboard & configure the PC in your needs .	St
