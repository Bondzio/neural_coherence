after reading this thread and many things across the web i decided to lash out and get an ssd for my win 7 inspiron 1545. i decided on a crucial m4 512g as the manufacturer guaranteed it would fit.
thankfully, it did.
i read many things over a few days regarding ssd's and their limited write capability, things to do to ensure optimal running with less write cycles etc.
this is what i found: old wd 250g scorpio blue boot from bios finish to desktop - 26 secs, shutdown - 6 secs.
new crucial m4 512g ssd bios finish to desktop - 16 secs, shutdown - 3 secs.
old drive 60/56mb/sec read/write - ssd 260/245mb/sec read/write.
this older dell laptop is only a sata ii.
i read that it's best to disable superfetch, prefetch and never to defrag the ssd to avoid unnecessary write cycles.
i did all that and after all-day testing found keeping these enabled allowed better access speeds to programs.
likely because my ram is faster than the ssd.
i've always manually defragged.
i updated 15 of my old drivers and found the bootup speed had now slowed by about 4 secs on every reboot.
i defragged using &quot;mydefrag&quot; and a custom script.
rebooted twice and called &quot;rundll32 advapi32.dll,processidletasks&quot;.
i then rebooted and the speed went right up again.
defragging this particular sdd works!
i already have the most up to date firmware.
this probably makes a difference because i only have sata ii, where the drive is sata iii capable.
it might be a good idea to experiment fully with a new ssd to ensure what works best.
i won't be defragging very often though.
some people say that cloning an old drive to ssd doesn't guarantee proper partition alignment.
before win 7 that's highly likely, but if you have a drive you're cloning to ssd that was originally formatted on win 7 then it will be properly aligned as win 7 makes sure of that automatically.
