I tried everything that is talked about here and it worked great, I can watch my dish network programming on my tv and record.
As for your tuner card, I tried Hauppauge 1196 WinTV HVR-1250 PCI Express Hybrid High Definition TV Tuner Card and it worked great.
I dont know if that is the version you tried but good luck.
