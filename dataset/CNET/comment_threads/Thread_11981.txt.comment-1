After years of great performance, my laptop has suddenly given out on me.
One day my wifi was working and the next day, after a shut down and reboot, it stopped working.
I have the latest driver and management software for my Intel wireless wifi link 4965AGN; and while it sees all the networks and connects, I cannot get online.
I checked everything I could think of and finally think I have the problem.
The ping test fails every time.
Any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.
Also, the machine is a Sony Vaio AR520E running Vista Home Premium SP2.
