1.1.1	im running an intel 2.8Ghz processor , the board is intel D865gbf .	St
1.1.2	when i start my computer , everything is normal but usually ( and more oftenly now ) the display suddenly turns something weird , a combination of lines and blocks and everything is stalled .	St
1.1.3	this can happen before or after the loading of windows ( no fixed time ) .	St
1.1.4	and when i restart the pc , normality is restored for sometime but then again this problem can erupt any time .	St
1.1.5	to give an idea of the sort of display problem ive taken a snapshot of the monitor screen , which can be found at http : //www.geocities.com/anasimtiaz/problem.jpg note that im running win xp ( sp2 ) and i hv two memory ( RAM ) sticks for quite some time now i am not sure where the problem lies !	St
1.1.6	but its really annoying ... it could be the display , ram , or anything..itssurely not the monitor !	St
1.2.1	I found an all too similar display when someone 's GPU heatsink was not seated proper .	St
1.2.2	A failed fan could do same .	St
1.2.3	If not that , try another video card .	St
1.2.4	And a boot test with some Linux LiveCD .	Sug
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	let me first tell u that im not a very techie person .	Sug
1.3.2	i know this that on my board ( d865gbf ) i hv a built-in vga , so how can i try another one ?	Ques
1.3.3	the fan looks fine to me , its working ... .and a temp sensor in the casing shows temps around 35-42 deg celcius u think its not RAM ?	Ques
1.3.4	and i cant do much testing on the pc since it freezed almost a minute or two after starting	St
1.4.1	I do n't see how many sticks of RAM but if there are 2 I try it with one then the other ( only one at a time . )	St
1.4.2	The Linux LiveCD is a good test to see if it 's a hardware or software ( OS ) issue .	St
1.4.3	Type LINUX LIVECD into google.com to catch up on what that is .	St
1.4.4	They are free .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	i managed to run SpeedFan for a minute ( but then again it froze ) ... .the program showed cpu temp to be 65 deg C , overheating ?	Ques
1.6.1	Your posts are a little light on details .	St
1.6.2	Such as if the case cover is off or not .	St
1.6.3	Minor things that could shed light as fans and heatsinks all in their place and running .	St
1.6.4	Also is this some newly built machine or ? ? ?	Ques
1.6.5	For now , leave the case cover off and see if that helps .	St
1.6.6	Also check those fans and make sure all the heatsinks are on proper and the fans working .	Sug
1.6.7	One plea for help found they did n't have a CPU heatsink and fan .	St
1.6.8	It was one of those build yourself things and they did n't know .	St
1.6.9	I do n't know what you know about this machine .	St
1.6.10	Bob	St
1.7.1	the cover is currently off , machine was built by an expert 2 or more years ago .	St
1.7.2	processor is intel 2.8G , two ram sticks .	St
1.7.3	the fan is working ( i can see it running ) and the heat sink , how can i check it ? ? ?	Ques
1.7.4	i havent done that before , how can i know if its proper ?	Ques
1.8.1	You can research and read web sites about & quot ; How to build a PC. & quot ; I do n't duplicate such content but leave it to members to look for ready web content .	St
1.8.2	Why ?	Ques
1.8.3	These are self help areas and not tech support .	St
1.8.4	However it helps to bounce ideas off each other .	St
1.8.5	How did the test with just one stick go ?	Ques
1.8.6	And how are you doing with your Linux LiveCD tests ?	Ques
1.8.7	Bob	St
