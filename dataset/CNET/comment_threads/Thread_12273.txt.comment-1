I have an old computer that I occasionally use and today I found that the CMOS battery is now dead.
I opened the case and thought I'd find a small 3 volt battery that's common to so many motherboards but I didn't find that.
I'm very sure that the motherboard is a Shuttle Hot 541.
But when I checked the internet for info on where the battery is and how to replace it, I found nothing.
Here is a photo of the board http://mail.lipsia.de/~enigma/neu/pics/mainboard_i430fx66.jpg I'd appreciate any help in changing it out.
Thanks
