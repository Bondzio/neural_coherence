i have a generic graphics card with the sis 300/305 chipset ( 32 mb ram ) .
recently i upgraded to windows xp and had to download new drivers for the card ( from the sis website ) .
the problem is that whenever i run a game in opengl , it is way too dark .
with windows 98/me , there was full set of utilities with the driver software that allowed me to adjust the brightness levels .
however there is no such feature with the present drivers .
as a result , i cannot play any game in open gl , because it is too dark to view .
does anyone have any suggestions to correct this problem ?
