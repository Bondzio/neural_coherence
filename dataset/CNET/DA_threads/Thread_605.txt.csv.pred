1.1.1	Hello , I am planning a new itx-build computer and I 'm a bit unsure as to a video card .	St
1.1.2	Ideally , I would like to find a card that could sound as well as video through the HDMI port .	St
1.1.3	Would most video cards with an HDMI port be capable of sound output , or would I need to look for a special feature on the card ?	Ques
1.1.4	( Also , I have no real plans on gaming on it .	St
1.1.5	The most graphically demanding operation is probably just playing Blu-ray on it .	St
1.1.6	If I can find a slim blu-ray drive . )	St

1.2.1	This means you 're going with some Sandybridge CPU which will have on board graphics that should be capable enough for everyday use .	St
1.2.2	Have you selected the exact processor you want and checked to see which Intel graphics offering it has ?	Ques
1.2.3	I might suggest something in the i5 range due to possible heat considerations and you do n't need the unlocked versions .	Sug
1.2.4	You might want to put the box together and see how well it does before adding a discrete video card .	St
1.3.1	intel 's sandy bridge graphics are ( finally ) respectable .	St
1.3.2	unless you want to do some gaming , the integrated graphics are perfect for in an ITX form factor .	St
1.4.1	I was thinking of getting the i7-2600 ( non k version ) .	St
1.4.2	If I were to go the discrete card route , would any potential card with an HDMI port fit the bill of being able to output sound as well ?	Ques
