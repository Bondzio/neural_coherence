as another poster mentioned, if you can run the cables i'd do it since that would give you some options, wireless access points etc.
if you are going to do the cable runs use cat-6 instead of cat-5, if you can, since chances are you will eventually upgrade your hardware, specifically the modem/ router from a g series to a more current n and cat-6 would give you a potential for better throughput.
good luck!!
