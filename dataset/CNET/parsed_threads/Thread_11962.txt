<s> Some of us &lt;giggles&gt; OLDER users are just getting into this new century and updating things. </s>
<s> Anticipating a new system configured as follows -- would GREATLY appreciate any input from ANY of you out there: &lt;Thanks!&gt; ---------------------------------- Black ANTEC TX-640b case w/ 400 SMART power prob 2 add'tl Zalman SILENT FANS) ASUS A8N-E (939 socket) PCIe OCZ Performance DDR 3200 (2x512 d/c) Copper 2-3-2-6 ASUS nVidia GF EN6600TD (256) graphics card AMD Athlon64 3200+ (1.40 w/ 1GHz FSB) Seagate Barracuda/SATA 160GB w/ NCQ NEC ND3540A (black) (really just watch DVD movies) Princeton Prototype LCD 21 (2480x1920) ----------------------------------- Current thought for CPU cooler is Scythe Ninja 1000 silver fin Heatpipe Tower &lt;&&gt; NOT SURE about upgrade for Northbridge chips yet --- I'm sure I need to learn a bit more before making THAT decision ! </s>
<s> Only additional add-on is a custom designed BOEING PCIe-4X Firewire card (Reasonably sure SOMETHING out there will work better w/ FIREWIRE so ... better now than later I thought) ! </s>
<s> Can I have one?? </s>
<s> Instead of the ASUS graphics check out the ATI Radeon X850 family. </s>
<s> They're considered top of the line. </s>
<s> And since you have all that money, get a pair of WD Raptor 36GB 10,000rpm SATA drives. </s>
<s> Set them up as a RAID0 array and 'stripe' them. </s>
<s> This will really make that system honk. </s>
<s> You might as well use XP Pro 64-bit for the OS. </s>
<s> It can be had for $140 (OEM) at TigerDirect. </s>
<s> It will still run 32-bit stuff. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> The stock heat-sink-fan that comes with AMD does the job. </s>
<s> As for Firewire, yes something does work better with fierwire and that is VIDEO. </s>

<s> raptors in raid not much faster and waste of money. </s>
<s> getting 64-bit xp is stupid as there will probably be some software/hardware conflict as not many appls and stuff even use 64-bit yet would recommend u to stick with what u had i think there is a typo as 3200+is not 1.4ghz and i would recommend getting the 3000+ venice and overclock and getting an evga 6600gt. </s>
<s> Looks good, don't forget windows or arctic silver thermal compound if neeeded. </s>
<s> Other than that agree with suggestion to save and get the 3000+ and get the 6600GT or better. </s>
