there are some benefits to using g over b. the speed issue you know about, and while it won't boost your internet connection much, since i doubt you have an 11mbps connection no matter how broad your bandwidth is, it would facilitate faster file sharing between the machines on the network - a plus.
some g equipment is equipped with wpa (a stronger encryption protocol than wep), another plus - and you will want to encrypt your network; if you don't know why, read some recent articles in cnet on the subject!
lastly, any g hardware will work on a b network, like if the notebook goes down to a local cafe with wireless service, but b hardware won't work on a g network.
