1.1.1	I bought an ASUS EEE 1000 ( no h ) from craigslist a few days ago .	St
1.1.2	When I got it only has 7.48 gb on the c : drive and almost all of that is already being used .	St
1.1.3	I took it to a tech he found a partition under disk management and told me that there is 7 more gigs not being used and created an icon for me under & quot ; my computer & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	However moving things over there is not really freeing up much space .	St
1.1.5	I am running Windows XP .	St
1.1.6	I have done the disk clean up .	St
1.1.7	Nothing ... Where is all this space being used .	St
1.1.8	I mean under add/remove programs it 's just got the main stuff to run the pc .	St
1.1.9	No extras at all .	St
1.1.10	Any advice would help .	Polite
1.1.11	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Well , we ca n't look at your machine , so we do n't know the answer .	St
1.2.2	All we can do is tell you how to find out : 1 .	St
1.2.3	Delete all but the latest system restore point from the disk cleanup wizard ( advanced ) .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	Download Treesize Free from http : //www.jam-software.com/freeware/ and start analysing the contents .	St

1.3.1	You would have to tell us ( or post a screenprint at some image hosting site ) what disk management says exactly .	Ques
1.3.2	7.48 GB on the c : -drive for XP certainly is unworkable and it will become worse with each Windows update .	St
1.3.3	So either you have to merge partitions or ( better ) replace the drive .	St
1.3.4	You can clone the contents of the current c : -drive to it , so you would n't have to lose anything .	St
1.3.5	That your father has the same netbook but with a bigger hard disk only means it 's not the same configuration .	St
1.3.6	Kees	St
1.4.1	How hard would it be to merge the partitions ?	Ques
1.4.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	Such a merge is not without risk .	St
1.5.2	In your other discussion GPARTED was noted and I 've used that in the past HOWEVER once in a while the OS wo n't boot and I 'll have to boot the XP CD to fix the boot information .	St
