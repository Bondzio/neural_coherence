i have a dell dimension 3000 running xp with sp2, 2.4 celeron cpu, 512 ram, and a soundmax integrated digital audio card.
the sound for files accessed off the hard drive are fine.
however, on sound off the internet, whether it is using skype or voice im flash media or real player is uniformily of low volume even with all of the volume fully cranked up.
i have not been able to locate a updated driver for this card.
has anyone had the experience of great sound off the hard drive but very low volume off the internet?
thanks
