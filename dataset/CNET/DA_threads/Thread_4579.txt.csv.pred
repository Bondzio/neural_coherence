1.1.1	Hello everybody !	St
1.1.2	I 'm curently having 2 issues to be solved : 1 ) Sometimes my laptop ( Acer Aspire 5738G running W7 Ultimate SP1 x86 as OS ) suddenly frezees ( mouse , keyboard etc ... . no longer work ) , although all drivers in my machine seem to be perfectly updated .	St
1.1.3	2 ) Another issue is that my system does not often recognize both my USB flash drives and my external HD , forcing me to reboot it whenever this glitch occurs , despite USB PORT drivers appearing once again to be updated .	St
1.1.4	The problem is that whenever I try to copy or move a file on my Flash Drive or external drive or just perform a Virus scan on them my system 9 times out of 10 freezes and does not recognize any other portable devices I plug in unless I reboot Windows .	St
1.1.5	Both my motherboard and HDD should be OK because if I do the same things in SAFE MODE all the problems mentioned above vanished , meaning my machine never freezees .	St
1.1.6	Please note that I bought my laptop from a guy who had changed both HD ( from 250 GB to 500 GB ) and OS ( from VISTA to W7 Professional ) , then I installed W7 Ultimate edition .	St
1.1.7	So could the above issues be somehow related to this ?	Ques
1.1.8	Maybe my laptop has now a BIOS with an old firmware and this could be the cause of both issues : what do you make of it ?	Ques
1.1.9	Did anyone have the same experience ?	Ques
1.1.10	So a possible solution could actually be to update my BIOS ( so called BIOS flashing ) , but I understand that it 's a very tricky operation .	St
1.1.11	However I 've just found these free tools for that : http : //www.gigabyte.com/webpage/20/HowToReflashBIOS.html http : //support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page ? DocID=DS013909 But maybe I 'd better use this FREE CD bootable edition : is that right , dudes ?	Ques
1.1.12	http : //support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page ? & LegacyDocID=MIGR-74984 Ever tried one of these free tools ? ?	Ques
1.1.13	If you are aware of a good tutorial about flashing the BIOS , please just le me know ... ok ?	Ques
1.1.14	Here are the tech details about my BIOS and Motherboard : - BIOS Brand Phoenix Technologies LTD Version V1.05 Date 03/20/2009 Starting Address 0xE549 ROM Size 2MB - MOTHERBOARD Manufacturer Acer Model JV50 ( U2E1 ) Version 0100 Chipset Vendor Intel Chipset Model PM45 Chipset Revision 07 Southbridge Vendor Intel Southbridge Model 82801IM ( ICH9-M ) Southbridge Revision 03 Ca n't wait to hear from you ! !

1.1.17	P.S .	St
1.1.18	Hey , to my great surprise I 've just discovered by chance that my laptop is 64 bit capable ... so I was wondering why the guy who sold it to me had install W7 Pro 32 bit .	St
1.1.19	As matters stand , do I better to install W7 Ultimate 64 bit ?	Ques
1.1.20	If so , how can I replace the 32 bit version with the 64 bit one ?	Ques
1.2.1	Tell me about your canned air .	St
1.2.2	When did you use it last ?	Ques
1.2.3	I see this is the usual Core 2 Duo machine at http : //support.acer.com/acerpanam/notebook/2009/acer/aspire/Aspire5738G/Aspire5738Gsp2.shtml so the age is such that it may be time to do deeper maintenance but let 's start with the every few month maintenance .	St
1.2.4	Tell me about your canned air .	St

1.4.1	Hi !	St
1.4.2	Thank you for your prompt reply !	St
1.4.3	Sorry for my silly question but what do you mean by & quot ; canned air & quot ; ?	Ques
1.4.4	Something related to the dust settled in the radiator ?	Ques
1.4.5	It 's a product for cleaning electronic stuff like this ? ?	Ques
1.4.6	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_duster Never used it ! !	St
1.4.7	Pease tell me what I have to do and whether or not I need to update my BIOS as well ( if so , please tell me how to do that : can I use the above tools instead of the third party software suggested by my BIOS manufacturer which is not free ? ?	Ques
1.4.8	) .	St
1.5.1	But first NO to the bios update .	St
1.5.2	I see no reason to change that .	St
1.5.3	You will find folk with machines that need basic maintenance reload the OS , try a BIOS and conduct extensive driver hunts when they have yet to do the basic maintenance .	St
1.5.4	If the laptop has never been cleaned then you may need to open it up to do a deep cleaning and while we are inside we replace the old heat sink compound .	St
1.5.5	Let me be blunt .	St
1.5.6	These are not bricks .	St
1.5.7	They require maintenance and if the owner does n't they usually get 3 to 4 years out of the laptop .	St
1.5.8	Here 's some canned air - & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/Compressed-Gas-Duster-10oz-Pack/dp/B004E2MF5S/ I supplied links above for bonus material .	St
1.5.9	Here 's a video on canned air and laptops .	St
1.5.10	http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=EWwejCKVGOY Yes , there can be some software issues but given the age of the machine and your answers , it 's time to do the maintenance .	St
1.5.11	Later after this work is done , we 'll talk about Grif 's advice .	St
1.5.12	It 's at the next link .	St

1.6.2	I 'll buy that product as soos as I can ... .problem is I live in Italy , so if I buy it in US via AMAZON it will take ages before being dispatched at home .	St
1.6.3	Maybe I 'd better buy here in my local town even thogh at present do n't know where to go ( PC shop ? ? )	Ques
1.6.4	Did you have ever experience similar cases as mine ?	Ques
1.6.5	I mean , could the two issues mentioned above be really due to canned air and dust inside the radiator of my Acer laptop ?	Ques
1.7.1	Strange .	St
1.7.2	While I 've yet to go to Italy , I 've found common stuff like that in all countries .	St
1.7.3	Guess there 's less hot air there ?	Ques
1.7.4	I 'd look at a PC or computer shop for such but at a camera shop I could find this thing : http : //www.amazon.com/Giottos-AA1900-Rocket-Blaster-Large/dp/B00017LSPI As to similar cases ?	Ques
