yes, i refilled the individual color cartridges for several years and had no trouble.
i let the printer set for 6 months(gave to son when bought another) and then it wouldn't print.
canon wanted 3x price of new printer - price had dropped considerably since i bought it - for new print head.
as long as i used it - had no problem and saved a lot of money.
the printer was great 600 dpi but wanted more dpi for photos.
