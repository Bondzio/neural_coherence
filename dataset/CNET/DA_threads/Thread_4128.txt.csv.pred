1.1.1	Hello , I am interesed in attaching small containers/trays ( about 2 - 4 inches in width ) to my flat screen monitor .	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to attach the tray to the monitor without it scratching my monitor .	St
1.1.3	Ideally , I would like the option for the container to be next to the side of the monitor or to be hidden behind the monitor .	St
1.1.4	This would mean that whatever the container is attached to must be flexible enough so that I can slide the tray to the back of the monitor .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	First , you need to create the container .	St
1.2.2	On one side of the object , have two loops extending from the top and bottom .	St
1.2.3	Take a small rod and place over it two rods- each with a swivel joint- at the top and bottom of this rod with rubber washers to stabilize the area and prevent unnecessary moving .	St
1.2.4	Connect the rod through the loops and cap off the top and bottom to prevent slipping .	St
1.2.5	With each rod running perpendicular to your box , make another rod with an arm in the middle and attach the two connecting rods at the top and bottom .	St
1.2.6	Make a small plate with two loops close together and attach the other end of the rod to the plate .	St
1.2.7	From the plate , create a set of legs that wrap around and attach small screws with soft feet at the bottom .	St
1.2.8	You can use suction cups .	St
1.2.9	Use this makeshift vise to attach the plate to the monitor .	St
1.3.1	If I knew what it was for I might be able to help you	St
1.4.1	The container will be similar to a round ashtray .	St
1.4.2	In the container , you can put either paperclips , Ipod , phone or post-it notes .	St
1.4.3	It would contain things you use or reach for everyday in an office setting .	St
1.4.4	I would like to clip this to my flat screen monitor .	St
1.4.5	The container will be at the side of the monitor but should be able to move to the back of the monitor if I want to hide it .	St
1.4.6	What materials do I need to ask for when I go to a local hardware store ?	Ques
1.5.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.5.2	It sounds like a good idea .	Polite
1.5.3	The only problem is that my container will not have a top ( open container ) .	St
1.5.4	It will look similar to a round ashtray and might be angled a little bit so that the person sitting in the chair can see what 's in the container and be able to reach for it .	St
1.5.5	If I were to go to Home Depot , I would ask for 2 loops , 2 rods , 2 swivel joints , 2 rubber washers , and a small plate ( what kind/brand ) ?	Ques
1.5.6	Sorry , I 'm not familiar with all this new terminology .	St
1.5.7	And in case you 're wondering , it 's for a class project .	St
1.5.8	And yes , I am in way over my head .	St
1.6.1	http : //www.fellowes.com/Fellowes/site/products/ProductDetails.aspx ? Id=8036401 Noteholders on the sides of the monitor , plus an adhesive tray below .	St
1.6.2	You can also pick up the tray featured in the above picture : http : //www.fellowes.com/Fellowes/site/products/ProductDetails.aspx ? Id=8031101	Ques
1.7.1	Thanks for sharing the links .	St
1.7.2	It 's useful .	St
1.7.3	But this is a class project and I have to make it .	St
1.8.1	Compare the design given to a human arm .	St
1.8.2	The box can be the hand itself .	St
1.8.3	The rod which connects is the metacarpus .	St
1.8.4	The two rods are the radius and ulna .	St
1.8.5	The second bar- with three rods- can be considered the elbow .	St
1.8.6	The last single rod is the humerus .	St
1.8.7	You 're being given a design that will work .	St
1.8.8	If you make it , you can patent it , and never have to give credit .	St
1.8.9	This will represent the side of the container. -- & gt ; | This will represent a loop on the side -- & gt ; ( .	St
1.8.10	( | & lt ; -- That is the design .	St
1.8.11	or like a letter d. |D Now using symbols here , = for two rods , | for the connecting rod , - for the representation of the humerus .	St
1.8.12	We have =|- as the basic design .	St
1.8.13	I have to use more letter for a representation of the design d as one end , and p as the other .	St
1.8.14	Using this we create what the rod may look like .	St
1.8.15	d -- -- p. This being the two ends of the horizontal rod which will fit over the vertical one and allow motion based on a simple hinge design .	St
1.8.16	Like I said : Put this together , take the credit , patent it , and you wo n't have to give anyone credit .	St
1.8.17	It 's also known as being lazy and not doing things for yourself .	St
1.9.1	In case you did n't notice , this is a forum where people share their knowledge and expertise .	St
1.9.2	I am in this forum to get familiar with something that is unfamiliar to me .	St
1.9.3	I have never built anything .	St
1.9.4	I want to become familiar with different tools and hardware that might be helpful for my project .	St
1.9.5	Again , this is a class project .	St
1.9.6	I plan on doing this myself .	St
1.9.7	To resort to calling people names is uncalled for , undeserved and unnecessary especially when all I simply want to do is to become familiar with materials in a hardware store .	St
1.9.8	Nonetheless , I thank you for your previous help but I wish that you did not give your input in the first place if you were going to write such such a mean-spirited second posting .	St
1.9.9	I can assure you , I will not use your idea or your design .	St
1.10.1	Did n't you learn basic human anatomy and the six simple machines in school ?	Ques
1.10.2	I am going to assume this is a basic engineering project and you are asking people that have little or no expertise in that field .	St
