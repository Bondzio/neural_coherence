<s> It looks like some old stuff alright. </s>
<s> I thought much use can be had unless someone really needs it. </s>
<s> Offhand, use the minimum bid of $1 as any s/h will cost as well. </s>
<s> -OR- sell as a lot for $10 or more, but be practical it is old stuff. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> To get an idea of the value of a piece of hardware, search for it on eBay. </s>
<s> Use the option on the side of the page to view &quot;completed&quot; sales as most stuff like this will not find any buyers. </s>
<s> If you live in a Craig's List area, that's probably a good place to try to move some of your old &quot;goodies&quot; since there is no listing fee or seller's fee on Craig's. </s>
<s> The eBay listing fees on this &quot;yesterday's&quot; equipment list will bleed you dry. </s>
<s> Perhaps a better idea would be to find some place that takes &quot;tax write off&quot; where you MIGHT recover a bit of yesterday's values. </s>

<s> Motherboards that you can't prove working are in the 1 to 10 buck range. </s>

<s> I tested the hardware already. </s>
<s> How else would I know about the low cmos battery on one of the motherboards. </s>
<s> I also loaded an OS and played some Audio CDs on the sound cards. </s>
<s> Spent over a week testing everything and except for the battery it all works. </s>
<s> Best bet is to ebay it and hope you get it gone. </s>
<s> The items you noted are found in dumpsters around my town every week. </s>

<s> Set your opening bid under a buck, 99 cents or a penny. </s>
<s> No pics, buy it know or other enhancements will keep your listing fees down. </s>
<s> Figure accurate shipping to cover yourself. </s>
<s> Be realistic, it's only worth what you can sell it for. </s>
<s> The second highest bidder will determine your selling price. </s>
<s> I'd sell most of it as a &quot;lot&quot;. </s>
<s> Somebody will buy it, but cheap! </s>
<s> I just finished testing a First International Computer Inc. VA-503+ motherboard so that is on the list too. </s>
