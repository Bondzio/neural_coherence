good morning.
thanks for the info.
for now, since i'm 4 years away from college, i'll stick with my list for now.
i'll keep the tablet idea in mind.
i think i might go for the mbp, since from what i've read it sounds the better of the two.
i'll be buying of amazon so they give something like a $150 rebate.
also do you know if apple will be relasing any new hardware besides the iphone this year, like a new mb or mbp.
thanks again
