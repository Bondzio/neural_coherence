Nice when it works but it fails for far too many reasons for me to list here.
No model number, no OS listed so we are still in generic answers.
Oh, here's the 2 buck audio fix I use too often -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-5-1-surround-External-Sound-Card/dp/B000N35A0Y/ That's $1.46 today to my mail box.
I carry one with me if I'm out to troubleshoot/fix an audio issue like the one above.
