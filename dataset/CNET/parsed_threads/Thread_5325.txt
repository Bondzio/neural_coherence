<s> I have never heard of using a vacuum cleaner to blow the dust away would be harmful. </s>
<s> Also I have never seen a case where glue are use for the side panel (some detail is missing here), I probably would go with epoxy. </s>
<s> As for usb 3.0, see what connection is available on the computer then get a usb3 adapter for it. </s>
<s> I would think pcie 4 or 16 or sata connection should do it. </s>
<s> 1.What can i use to clean the dust of the components and the case, i normally used a normal vacuum but now i read it can damage the components. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Use canned air or a some compressor if you like, just don't get wild in its use. </s>
<s> Don't &quot;weeeee&quot; the fans or blow-off the jumpers. </s>
<s> I suspect you use the vacuum cleaner in &quot;blower&quot; mode should be an issue. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> One of the side panels are falling off due to the glue failure, what glue can i use to get it back on, and that will last, the panel is pretty heave since its aluminium. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any decent glue or some expoxy should do, follow it instructions. </s>
<s> there nothing to stop you from &quot;jerry-rigging&quot; a solution. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> How can i upgrade to 3.0 USB from 2.0 USB. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have an empty slot install a USB 3.0 card of good quality, don't be cheap, as they have issues you'll soon find out otherwsie. </s>
