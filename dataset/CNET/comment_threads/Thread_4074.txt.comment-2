All capital letters are too hard to read.
For 3 to 5 year games you best use a machine from that time.
An Intel 2.8GHz dual core should be fine with 1 or 2GB RAM and a newer video card.
I think this Dell has a PCIE slot so let me offer a card I would use -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Zotac-nVidia-Express-Graphic-ZT-20404-20L/dp/B002X7A6N4 This moves the video card up to game play standards without having to replace the computer's power supply.
Be sure to see if the card mechanically fits.
