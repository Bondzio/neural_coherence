She gave me the parts (2 disk drives, floppy, and 1 80gb WD HD). I just built a computer (AMD Athlon x2 3600+, 1gb Wintec Ampo DDR2 800, PNY GeForce 7300GT 256mb, 140gb WD EIDE HD, VISTA Home Basic) and would like to format her old hard drive (which had lots of spyware, etc.) and put XP on it. So I simply want to format the 80gb hard drive (while not getting it's spyware on my PC) and install XP on it, while keeping Vista HB on my current HD. How???

Boot with the XP CD and choose format and install. But remember this. XP will not have any drivers for your PC such as video, audio, etc. Sounds like a project.

I guess I missed what you really want to do. Install XP on another drive or the same as the Vista drive? If the same as Vista, another partition is needed and from what I hear that can be a real challenge.

To install XP after Vista is something we'll have to ask Google. http://www.pro-networks.org/forum/about88231.html looks spot on. But given I don't know what Vista and XP CDs you have I can't tell you if it should work. Bob
