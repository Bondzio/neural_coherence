I am looking at building out a new system and have it narrowed done to a few cases, the first three I would use line four (PS) with and the last line number 5 has a 1000w already in the box. Let me know your thoughts on this or if there are others anyone would suggest. I am looking for a solid case with good cooling and high efficiency rating. The Thermal lake 750w Power supply has an 87% rating. I am not sure on the Cool Master 1000w built in one. If it helps I now have narrowed down the MOB to two. I am looking at the ASUS P5E LGA 775 Intel X38 ATX Intel Motherboard $226 or the ASUS MAXIMUS FORMULA LGA 775 Intel X38 ATX Intel Motherboard $259. Which is the way to go for the MOBs? 1.) COOLER MASTER CM Stacker STC-T01-UWK Black/ Silver Aluminum / Steel ATX - $149 2.) COOLER MASTER Stacker 830 Evolution RC-830-KKN3-GP Black Aluminum ATX - $179 3.) Thermaltake Armor Series VA8003BWS Black Full Tower Case w/ 25CM Fan - $149 4.) Thermaltake W0116RU Complies with ATX 12V 2.2 & EPS 12V version 750W Power Supply - $190 5.) COOLER MASTER Stacker 830 Evolution RC-830-KKR3-GP Black Aluminum ATX Full Tower Computer Case Real Power Pro 1000W Power Supply - $379 Thanks for your time with this.

I'd go with the P5E because of it's extra features the hardware for both is nearly the same. You can compare for yourself: http://usa.asus.com/products_compare.aspx This thread is untracked
