so your saying either the 8800gts or the radeon x1950pro.
but if i want i can get the 7900 gs and still play my games without getting really mad cuz the frame rate sucks?
but when i buy it from gateway.com i have the choice between the 8800gts($299.00) or the ati radeon x1900 crossfire w/ 512 mb($357.00) nothing about 1950 pro it says crossfire and its an added $470.
so idk which one to get since i've actually never used any of them b4.
all i want is to play a few games without getting any lag.
thanks a lot by the way.
really appreciate it.
