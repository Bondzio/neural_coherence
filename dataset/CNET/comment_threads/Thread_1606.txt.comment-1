I had been experiencing problems with my old Western Digital 40 Gig Hard Drive (not sure on RPM).
It made a constant humming sound and occasionally, every 10 minutes or less, it would make an extremely loud whirring-type sound that lasts about 2-3 seconds and stops.
Also, my CPU usage is very high when doing simple tasks such as opening webpages, but the CPU spiking and the hard drive sound is not simultaneous, so I don't know if that has anything to do with the problem.
Anyways, I decided to purchase a new WD 120 gig 7200 RPM hard drive last week and the constant humming sound is not present, but the 2-3 second whirring sound is exactly the same.
I was thinking this may be a problem with my power supply, but I'm not sure.
I have a Intel Pentium 4 Processor 2.79 ghz, 256 MB RAM, Windows XP Professional (2002) Service Pack 2.
