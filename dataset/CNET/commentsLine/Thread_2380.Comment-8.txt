&quot;1680 x 1050 resolutions,&quot; i wonder if ati's 1280x1024 is not exactly kosher.
to recap.
must be 60hz for all settings and watch out on the second number.
-&gt; all this vanished as an issue over hdmi or even dvi to hdmi connections.
ever since i changed that my kid has yet to ask me to set the resolutions.
