I'm not aware of any file on a HD that will block the machine from POST.
If the machine &quot;did&quot; beep after POST and now does not....make it smaller.
Work with the bios....get the machine to beep.
You don't need for a beep.
HD's Floppies Optical Other Unplug that stuff.....get the machine to beep.
