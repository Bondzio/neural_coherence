1.1.20	Thank you for your help !!!	St
1.1.21	!	St
1.2.1	I can't guess why the dated CPU in that.	St
1.2.2	Let's look at a current Haswell for just under 1K -&gt; http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html The 7790 looks to fair well against the 780.	St
1.2.3	I have to step out but will get some benchmarks here later.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I believe the i5-4670K delivers a better gaming performance.	St
1.3.2	A few guys told me that it would be more worth it to get?	St
1.4.1	Here's what I advise.	St
1.4.2	Always copy someone else's design.	St
1.4.3	At least I tried to save you from creating a new combo.	St
1.4.4	Here's what I promised later.	St
1.4.5	http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=Radeon+HD+7790 = 3050 http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce+GTX+780&id=2525 = 7864 Looks like you are going to very high end.	St
1.4.6	Seems you'd want the i7 IMO.	St
1.4.7	Sorry about not having the time to look over the video cards but I had to scoot.	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-6.html I rarely see folk pop for this class card and skimp on the CPU.	St
1.5.2	Strange.	St
1.5.3	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780-performance-review,3516-6.html shows you get the 60+ FPS at 2560x1440 but I find folk rarely have that display.	St
1.5.4	Many are running the usual 1080.	St
1.5.5	Notice the rig they used to get that performance.	St
1.5.6	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780-performance-review,3516-5.html Bob	St
1.6.1	yes, hopefully everything will work well together.	St
1.6.2	Why get 4x4gb ram when you can get 2x8gb?	St
