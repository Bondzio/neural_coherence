I am operating an HP Windows XP system and I use a Bluetooth USB adapter to recieve photos from my phone and transfer files from my Ipaq. The &quot;Bluetooth Icon&quot; used to show up in the Windows System Tray (that part of the toolbar never made much sense to me. . ) Recently, the Icon &quot;dissapeared&quot; from the toolbar. (Yes, I have three teenage children using this computer, how did you know?) Now I can't seem to turn the Bluetooth &quot;ON&quot;. Any Ideas on how to get the icon back? The control panel says the device is working, but I get no connection. I have the bluetooth wizard, bluetooth places folder, and plenty of bluetooth files. . . just can't get connected without the Icon's control. . . Maybe there is an alternate &quot;ON&quot; switch I could use ?

At first glance the topic seems to want a customized icon, but in truth you would use System Restore and if that fails, then you need to test your hardware on another machine. In closing, you didn't reveal the model of the machine, but some are Via chip based and the USB will fail if one accepts a driver from Windows Update. Tip? Don't do that. http://www.usbman.com is great if I need to troubleshoot USB items. Bob
