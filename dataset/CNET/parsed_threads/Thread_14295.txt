<s> Just a quick question. </s>
<s> I just bought a USB PCI 2.0 card with 5 ports. </s>
<s> 4 at the back and 1 for the 2 USB ports on my case at the front. </s>
<s> Im running Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2. </s>
<s> Its connected up ok and it works just fine apart from when I connect another USB device my USB Wireless Lan Stick goes dead and loses the wireless connection. </s>
<s> After juggling the ports around I am able to restore it again. </s>
<s> Any ideas as to why this may happen? </s>
<s> All the ports work fine on their own and its only the wireless USB stick that goes dead. </s>
<s> Connecting other devices all together doesnt pose any problems. </s>
<s> Also on the card itself is a Floppy drive 5v connector. </s>
<s> What is it exactly for? </s>
<s> Chris </s>
<s> ...since juggling them around corrects the problem. </s>
<s> Even though you have 4 external ports, some will share the same power. </s>
<s> You can see what power a device is using by opening Device Manager (right-click My Computer, select &quot;Hardware&quot; tab, click [Device Manager]), opening &quot;USB controllers&quot;, and then checking the &quot;Power&quot; tab of each &quot;USB Root Hub&quot;. </s>
<s> What is the make & model of PCI USB 2.0 card? </s>
<s> forgot to add that the 5v connector is probably to provide additional hub power (in excess of what a pci slot can provide). </s>
<s> if you plug it in to a power supply lead, you should see either some of your hubs becoming self-powered or additional power availble on the hub. </s>
