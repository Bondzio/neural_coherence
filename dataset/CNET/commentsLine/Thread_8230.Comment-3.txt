thanks bob.
glad to see you're still helping in the forums.
been awhile since i was here.
i'm beginning to think there may be an incorrect raid setting, even though i'm not using raid.
the via raid driver is installed, and i can access raid through bios, but for some reason i can't change any settings.
i'll get back to you if i find whats happening with the raid controller.
