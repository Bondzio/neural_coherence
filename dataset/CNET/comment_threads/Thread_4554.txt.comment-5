I some difficulty convincing Microsoft that I didn't have the hotfix they said I had it in SP2 but Belarc advisor didn't show it.
They finally sent it and after unzipping it I tried many combinations of installing and unistalling hotfix, drivers, etc.
it just started working and I don't know why and still is.
Thanks for all your help RLB
