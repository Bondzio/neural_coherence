i am looking for a new monitor, i have searched cnet and other sites looking into whether i should buy a crt or a lcd monitor.
i play alot of gaames i.e.
half life 2, counter strike, and battlefield 2. i also do film editing for my minidv cam.
i know crts are faster brighter and clearer than lcds, but lcds have made big improvements on them.
what i was wondering if you have any suggestions on what to buy.
any input would be very usefull.
