I am new in the market for an external hard drive.
I have a dell computer w/ xp pro operating system.
This is for office use.
My question is if this hard drive is right for me.
Can it copy my entire system (programs, operating system, data) or do I still need to purchase software (Acronis, Norton Ghost)?
My need is for disaster recovery.
Thanks
