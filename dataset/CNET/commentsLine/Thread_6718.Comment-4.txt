dear bob, thank you for your answer, the graphic card that i had mentioned the visiontek x1650pro hdmi has the following description in its spec: &quot;256mb ddr2 memory hdcp eprom onboard.&quot; that is why i interested to do more study about this graphic card.
however, you had mentioned another ineresting point that i did not know before about hdcp on the monitor/tv as well.
did you mean that my widescreen 1080p lcd hdtv need to also support hdcp?.
again, many thanks for your information.
regards, hiep nguyen
