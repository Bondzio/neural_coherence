<s> I got a &quot;Qwerty&quot; keyboard problem that I discovered this morning. </s>
<s> When I attempt to type a capital &quot;O&quot; by holding the left shift key down, nothing happens including typing a &quot;blank&quot; character. </s>
<s> The keyboard in question is a Logitech wireless unit. </s>
<s> The left shift key works for all other keys except the capital O. </s>
<s> However, holding the right shift key down does allow me to type a capital O. </s>
<s> Anyone have an idea as to how to fix this short of getting another keyboard? </s>
<s> (Doctor) Don't do that. </s>
<s> ... </s>
<s> Sorry but try new batteries and another keyboard. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Don't ask me why, but I found the F7 key stuck &quot;down&quot; and for some reason, this stopped the capital O using teh left shift key. </s>
<s> All other keys worked with the left shift key. </s>
<s> GO FIGURE! </s>
<s> PS FWIW, the F7 key on this keyboard has a printer icon on it. </s>
<s> the key in question is &quot;dirty&quot; or the contact membrane under the actual key. </s>
<s> Clean out the keyboard and membrane. </s>
<s> It will work then. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> So, if I spilled alittle wine on the keyboard I guess the answer to that will be a new one? </s>
