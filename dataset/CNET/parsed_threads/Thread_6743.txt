<s> Recommendation on a graphics card I have a Dell Dimension 4700 2.8ghz Pentium 4 1.75gb 305 watts. </s>
<s> As of now I have no graphics card other then the integrated one on the board. </s>
<s> I want to run Adobe CS3 (lightly, sketchup, and watch moives on my Dell Ultra sharp 24 monitor. </s>
<s> Basically I want the most dedicated memory without upping the 305watts power source. </s>
<s> (256mb?) </s>
<s> And get the best resolution out of my monitor and cheap! </s>
<s> I will eventually be retiring this computer for movies and music. </s>
<s> It has a PCI express slot. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your advice. </s>

<s> You either get a larger power supply or run the risk of the current one dying with the larger power drain. </s>
<s> There are no alternatives here. </s>
<s> Brian, You might also see huge increases in performance by upgrading your processor. </s>
<s> The Pentium 4 is an old processor using old architecture. </s>
<s> Current Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad processors not only consume less power but will also give you a significant performance boost. </s>
<s> For example, a Core 2 Quad 8300 can convert 29 Hi-res photos into a video slideshow more than 5X faster than a Pentium 4-630 (a 3.0 GHz processor. </s>
<s> Also, most consumer software suites out there today are optimized to take advantage of multi-core processors. </s>
<s> I realize that you probably cant upgrade your processor with your current MB, perhaps an investment in a new system would be worthwhile. </s>
<s> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Full disclosure: TimWoodChip is an Intel employee and consumer PC expert. </s>
<s> I just want to get it going for cheap. </s>
<s> I plan on getting a laptop. </s>
<s> The processor is fast enough to do what I want it to do: some graphic but mainly music and movies. </s>
<s> With the existing computer I have, what would be the best video card I can put in for cheap that gets me max resolution (1920 x 1200 / 60 Hz)? </s>
<s> Hi Brian I think you could go with a mid range vidieo card and be just fine with you power supply and system. </s>
<s> If you want a quick, cheap upgrade to accomplish your goals it would be a resonable option just to add a PCIE graphics card. </s>
<s> May I suggest a Geforce 8600 based card such as http://www.techforless.com/cgi-bin/tech4less/PVT84JYAJG?mv_pc=google_base&tts=20090507020701 . </s>
<s> It is not a power hog and it is not expensive and yet it delivers outstanding performance. </s>
<s> Just my $.02 zonzin </s>
<s> it'll work fine for you: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131084 </s>
