Thanks for your speedy answer: (1) The hard drive was formated to NTFS - maybe that's why the data was recoverable at all!
(2) I have been to the website of the mainboards manufacturer & downloaded all the drivers/updates for that board.
Unfortunately it still hasn't sorted the problem.
So, if you (or anyone else) can think of anything else I'd be very gratefull!
Thanks, Jeff
