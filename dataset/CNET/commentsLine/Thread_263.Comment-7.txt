no bob, i'm aware that the paperwhite has a backlight, i just haven't found any other devices that really provide the same kind of user experience.
i was hoping, prior to purchasing anything, that i might get a bit of insight from users of other devices.
perhaps there is another device that i'm unfamiliar with, that could satisfy my requirements?
