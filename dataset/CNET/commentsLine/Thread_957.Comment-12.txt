i just have a hard time understanding at times.
i re-read your previous posts and the little light came on regarding internet speeds and connectivity speeds between networked computers.
next time i just need to read a little more slowly.
thank you for the time you spent with me on this issue bob.
you jave no idea how much you helped me.
and you have given me a lot to ponder.
i'll quit bugging you about it.
