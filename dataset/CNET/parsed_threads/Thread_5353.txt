<s> Hi everyone, I need to buy a graphic card for my PC, mainly to play video games. </s>
<s> The problem I have is that the PC only has a PCIe x1 AND the card has to be low profile (I know that sucks ). </s>
<s> I don't have a $$$ limit. </s>
<s> So if you can please advice me on good graphic cards for this configuration, I would appreciate. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The graphics library is more important than the card. </s>
<s> Learn this. </s>
<s> If your system has a high end card and the library is medium grade, you're wasting money. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010380048+1069620108&Subcategory=48 ignore the firemv and quadro cards (all intended cad use), and you've only got the radeon x1300/x1550 to choose from. </s>
<s> those are low-end cards. </s>
<s> the real problem is the price... they're just not giving you $100 worth of performance and they're twice as expensive in the x1 low-profile form factor. </s>
<s> for less than $100 you coud get a 'full size' 8600gt or radeon 2600xt that would be 2-3x faster than the x1300/x1550. </s>
