michael, i had clicked setup first that is how i got the message that it couldn't open the rtf file.
the good news is that we are connection sharing again.
don't know for how long because i went through all the same steps over and over and it just started working.
i did go in and disable the windows zero manager right after you said not to use both.
maybe next time i'll enable it and try just depending on it to fix it.
thank you for your help.
