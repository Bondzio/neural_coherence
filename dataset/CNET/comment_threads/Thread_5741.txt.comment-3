Sorry but I do not have the specifics of this machine at my finger tips.
Please be patient and I will reconnect it to a monitor so I can get the model #.
This machine is 6yrs old and it is a power spec with xp operating system.
It has been a great system up until now.
Everthing else works fine except the usb ports.
I just went and bought another tower its a dell with windows 7 os.
I would still like to be able to transfer files through the usb ports if at all possible.
Is this something I can fix or is this computer junk?
Thanks Troy
