1.1.1	A few weeks ago , while using my beloved desktop , it crashed to & quot ; blue screen error & quot ; .	St
1.1.2	*** STOP : 0x0000007B ( 0x81482E50 , 0xC0000032 , 0x00000000 , 0x00000000 ) INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE I am completely new to the 'seriously crashed machine ' scene .	St
1.1.3	And really shaken-up , I tried a Norton Recovery diskette ( which went and wrote a Windows Millenium & quot ; boot block & quot ; onto my hard drive , by way of & quot ; system recovery & quot ; ) .	St
1.1.4	Then I tried to boot my system : Windows reported an & quot ; invalid disk array & quot ; .	St
1.1.5	Then with my heart in my mouth ( 'cos things seemed to have gotten worse ) I learnt from the internet that Norton ( System ) Recovery Diskettes are made to recover Win9x and WinME systems -- Ouch !	St
1.1.6	So , what could cause Windows to suddenly change its mind about a set of Seagate Barracuda disk running off a HighPoint HPT370A RAID controller ( processor ) , in RAID 0 configuration ?	Ques
1.1.7	Or , more accurately , what is an & quot ; inaccessible boot device & quot ; ?	Ques
1.1.8	My Norton Anti-virus guard had the latest virus definitions and was operational .	St
1.1.9	And one day or so before , I had done a full system virus check which found no viruses .	St
1.1.10	I also have a fully working firewall , which also was operational .	St
1.1.11	And , and I had my Windows service packs installed and up-to-date .	St
1.1.12	The Resulting situation : a ) My desktop could no longer boot-up through to the Windows desktop .	St
1.1.13	b ) BIOS could & quot ; see & quot ; my hard drive and the HighPoint RAID Controller RAID 0 ) .	St
1.1.14	c ) BIOS could boot my system up to : & quot ; invalid disk & quot ; & quot ; please insert disk and press any key & quot ; d ) The & quot ; posting & quot ; process for BIOS boot-up allows boot-up from : i ) floppy , on drive A : ii ) CD , on drive D : I then attempted Windows Recovery from the Windows CD-ROM .	St
1.1.15	The result of this was : i ) Windows Setup kept needing to be supplied with the driver for the HighPoint RAID controller .	St
1.1.16	ii ) Windows Setup could not do an & quot ; emergency & quot ; system repair -- it needs a previously prepared & quot ; Emergency Diskette & quot ; to be able to do that .	St
1.1.17	And I never knew about this .	St
1.1.18	I never made one .	St
1.1.19	iii ) Windows Setup said that it could n't find the & quot ; existing Windows operating system & quot ; iiii ) Windows Setup said that it was unable to format my hard drives ( which have one large partition ( 38MB ) and one small partition ( 4MB ) .	St
1.1.20	[ I never new that my drives were set up this way .	St
1.1.21	My desktop was factory assembled .	St
1.1.22	I bought it complete .	St
1.1.23	That company went bust this January gone ! )	St
1.1.24	Really , I wanted to recover three years worth of my work which I had on my hard drive ( and I still want to ) .	St
1.1.25	When I consulted one of the tech support guys over at a Microsoft technical support center ( 70 per hour ) , the guy there said to me : & quot ; There is no way that the work and information on the hard drive can be saved ( recovered ) & quot ; He then strongly advised that I & quot ; reformatted & quot ; my drives for the purpose of doing a & quot ; fresh install of Windows & quot ; .	St
1.1.26	I asked him again if there was another way to recover my system so that I would not loose my precious work .	St
1.1.27	He repeated : & quot ; No.There isn't. & quot ; As I am new to the innards of a computer -- and frankly , I was panic striken -- I went with his advice .	St
1.1.28	The formatting process proceeded for some minutes ( and , it formatted over 80 % of drive C ) , then Windows 2000 Professional Setup program stopped and reported that : & quot ; Setup was unable to format drive C. The hard disk may be damaged .	St
1.1.29	Make sure the disk is on and properly connected to your computer .	St
1.1.30	If the disk is a SCSI disk , make sure your SCSI devices are PROPERLY TERMINATED .	St
1.1.31	See your computer or SCSI adapter documentation for more information .	St
1.1.32	setup can not continue .	St
1.1.33	To quit Setup , press F3. & quot ; v ) Windows Setup said that it was unable to ( do anything ) and I quit it .	St
1.1.34	Another Questions : Did the format process wipe any of my data ?	Ques
1.1.35	It aborted before completing whatever it was doing .	St
1.1.36	Can I rescue my data ?	Ques
1.1.37	B. I then tried the Windows Console tool : i ) Windows Console 's CHKDSK /R reported that : & quot ; ... unrecoverable errors & quot ; Well , what does that mean ?	Ques
1.1.38	While you are all scratching your heads , here is the current state of play : ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . 1 .	Res
1.1.39	I contacted HighPoint and asked for a bootable diagnostic software tool .	St
1.1.40	I got this , used it and sent the results back to HighPoint Technologies .	St
1.1.41	This is their reply : & quot ; Dear Sir/Madam , Testing UDMA 5 on ST320414A : fail -- - the hard disks ca n't work with ATA100 normally .	St
1.1.42	The verification is OK -- -It means that the hard disks does n't have bad sectors .	St
1.1.43	& quot ; Invalid partition table .	St
1.1.44	Setup can not continue .. Error loading operating system .	St
1.1.45	Setup can not continue ... & quot ; You can ignore the above information .	St
1.1.46	Each logical hard disk will have this information .	St
1.1.47	All ZEROS from word address [ 000 ] through to word address [ 1F0 ] As you create RAID0 with the hard disk .	St
1.1.48	And this hard disk is the second member of the RAID0 .	St
1.1.49	So you ca n't see the & quot ; Invalid partition table .	St
1.1.50	Setup can not continue & quot ; We think your hard disks ca n't work normally .	St
1.1.51	You had better not plug them into the HPT370 controller and create RAID with them .	St
1.1.52	Regards , HighPoint Technologies Inc. & quot ; Now , I nowadays find that I have to ask this question : & quot ; Do these guys know what they are talking about ? & quot ; And : & quot ; What does it mean -- what they have said .	St
1.1.53	What does it mean ? & quot ; Anybody know ?	Ques
1.1.54	and 2 .	St
1.1.55	Take a look at this from Seagate Technologies : & quot ; Mr ( xxxxxxxx ) , The reason Seatools is not seeing the drives is because of the Highpoint RAID controller .	St
1.1.56	Seatools can not test the drives on a RAID controller other than the Generic mode .	St
1.1.57	I would suggest running a Windows 2000 Repair .	St
1.1.58	What are the results .	St
1.1.59	Best Regards , Stefan M. Seagate Technical Support & quot ; Okay guys , what 's he saying ?	Ques
1.1.60	Just so you guys know : only one of the software tools on the SeaTools software package failed .	St
1.1.61	Six other software tools worked .	St
1.1.62	And they correctly identified the HPT370A controller , and the two hard disks .	St
1.1.63	I need and want to restore my system to full workability , just as fast as possible .	St
1.1.64	With my data recovered and a RAID hard drive setup -- I want the speed of RAID .	St
1.1.65	Any ideas -- anybody ?	Ques
1.1.66	Good , workable advice and instruction will be especially welcome .	St

1.2.1	& quot ; There is no way that the work and information on the hard drive can be saved ( recovered ) & quot ; He then strongly advised that I & quot ; reformatted & quot ; my drives for the purpose of doing a & quot ; fresh install of Windows & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	I asked him again if there was another way to recover my system so that I would not loose my precious work .	St
1.2.3	He repeated : & quot ; No.There isn't. & quot ; As I am new to the innards of a computer -- and frankly , I was panic striken -- I went with his advice. & quot ; That in a nutshell is at the heart of this issue plus you were handed a HIGH MAINTENANCE machine with a timebomb till it went pwoof .	St
1.2.4	I can safely bet that no one ever told you that HARD DISKS ARE TEMPORARY STORAGE .	St
1.2.5	With all I 've read in your post , the formattiong , partitioning and more that has been done has moved your data recovery to only where PROFESSIONAL RECOVERY SERVICES and about 4 figures will get this back .	St
1.2.6	Before we go one step further , is there a backup of what you ca n't lose ?	Ques
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	No .	St
1.3.2	There is no back up ( Gulp ! )	St
1.3.3	JayC	St
1.4.1	http : //www.drivesavers.com/ and http : //www.ontrack.com/ Bob	St
1.5.1	I see ... Data recovery firms are my only option now for recovering my data .	St
1.5.2	As for my computer system -- what do you recommend ?	Ques
1.5.3	Do I go buy a whole new computer now ?	Ques
1.5.4	Or do I patch up the one I have which is kaput just now ?	Ques
1.5.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.6	JayC	St
1.6.1	I recall offering advice that what you may have spent on phone support could buy a new 40 to 120GB drive that is likely as fast as that 20GB drive .	St
1.6.2	RAID would be debateable since installation methods are quite diverse so what I know may not apply .	St
1.6.3	In fact , I prefer boring stable and fast setups over faster and unsupportable any day of the week .	St
1.6.4	If this was my machine , I would n't have the dataloss issues , but would move the 20GB drives to normal ATA ports , and just plow ahead .	St
1.6.5	DVD writers fell below 80 dollars and 40+GH of DVD-RW disks were all of 20 bucks .	St
1.6.6	That 's one backup set and if the data was n't worth that much , then what can be written ?	Ques
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	have you tried any third party raid tools ?	Ques
1.7.2	specificly one that would reload the system boot up files ? .	Ques
1.7.3	it would be like sys.exe in the dos days ! .	St
1.7.4	what has happened is the mbr was modified .	St
1.7.5	most likely missing IO.sys and MSDOS.sys you can try buy coping command.com to the root directory of c : \windows .	St
1.8.1	This may sound silly but if you are using a Windows operating system that uses DOS as the underlying software .. as in Win 95 , Win 98 , Win 2000 ..etc.. using the old DOS commands may help you in copying your data to another drive or discs formatted in DOS.. just a suggestion .	St
1.8.2	DOS works very slowly but it does work .	St
1.8.3	For your info DOS is the original Operating software using Command.com that is present in most Windows products..	St
1.8.4	I am not sure whether this is true however for Windows XP .	Res
1.8.5	good luck	Polite
1.9.1	Going to a data recovery firm is a little late , once you have tried to recover and reformatted/partitioned it is extremely unlikely you can get anything back .	St
1.9.2	I have clients that have paid Ontrack and others to get their data back , and it has been successful , but it has cost $ 1500- $ 120000 , and getting back data from a RAID array is in the higher priced range because of the complexity involved .	St
1.9.3	In your case you posted your questions for help too late .	St
1.10.1	your responses to the replies I will simply suggest that you can sit down with the discs and a good sector editor and recover what you can sector by sector .	St
1.10.2	( You have mentioned limited funds so professional recovery is out and RAID 0 recovery is EXPENSIVE ! )	St
1.10.3	Here are a couple and you can use this link to find others : http : //www.google.com/search ? sourceid=navclient & ie=UTF-8 & oe=UTF-8 & q= % 22sector+editor % 22 BreakPoint Software offers the HEX Workshop at http : //www.hexworkshop.com/ X-Ways Software offers several forensic tools including WinHex at http : //www.x-ways.net/index-m.html & quot ; Roadkils & quot ; offers another here http : //www.filehungry.com/index.php ? action=viewitemdetails & id=10047 Another would be DISKEDIT ( find it here http : //www.clinch.ch/CLINCH/DownLoad.htm ) and this site will help with your editing project http : //www.geocities.com/thestarman3/DOS/bd98/bd98NDE.html For getting back up and running the advice to skip the RAID and start with a single good IDE drive to keep things simple is something you should really consider .	St
1.10.4	The alternative is to take your problem to a professional and pay for the fix .	St
1.10.5	Good luck .	Polite
1.11.1	I have the same problem and I 'm currently looking for solution .	St
1.11.2	PLEASE ADVICE THANKS , EUGENE	St
