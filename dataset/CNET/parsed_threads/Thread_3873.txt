<s> Is it OK to leave them black ? </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> You comouter Network adapter will be able to detect available networks. </s>
<s> You just choose which one to access...keyng in the network key if it is a securred network... As for the IP & DNS numbers, these are keyed into the modem/router of the Network your are accessing so there is no need to do that at your network adapter [[TCP/IP proprties]. </s>
<s> However, there is no harm in doing so. </s>
<s> However, if the numbers ar not properly keyed in at the mode/router or are wrong, you do need to, and in this case you may find a slow connection or frequent drop-line. </s>
