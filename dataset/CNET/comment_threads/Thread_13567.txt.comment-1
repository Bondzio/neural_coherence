I'm using direct VGA to VGA from my lenovo laptop to a hannspree 25&quot; lcd 1080p tv.
My laptop is supposed to be able to support a second monitor, and the tv has the vga port with pc input mode.
However the signal doesnt make it to the tv.
When I plug in the cable my laptop recognizes theres a second monitor (I can move things off the screen) and a second monitor appears in the display settings.
How can I troubleshoot the problem?
