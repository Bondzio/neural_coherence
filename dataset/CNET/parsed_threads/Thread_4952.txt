<s> Yes, I do have the antivirus monitoring off for that drive. </s>
<s> That helps somewhat. </s>
<s> But simple things I do keep waking up the hard drive and it is LOUD. </s>
<s> For example, I deleted a .txt file from my desktop, (that I just created now). </s>
<s> Their was a 10 second delay until the external drive woke up, then the file was deleted into the recycle bin. </s>
<s> Now the drive will be loudly humming for the next 20 min until it sleeps again. </s>
<s> drives to make sure they're alive and well. </s>
<s> But why is your drive so noisy? </s>
<s> I've got half a dozen of them from Seagate and WD, and I hardly ever hear them. </s>
<s> For example the age old problem (one of too many so you keep digging) is that if some item in RECENT DOCUMENTS points to that drive then a save to a text or an file updates the RECENT DOCUMENTS and Windows checks that all those RECENT DOCUMENTS entries still exist. </s>
<s> It's burned deep into this OS so to fix this you change OSes. </s>

<s> And my externals are often unplugged and in the safe. </s>
<s> These are backups and no need to be online at all. </s>
<s> Another thing I found is to move to 2.5 inch drives. </s>
<s> Less power and hum. </s>
