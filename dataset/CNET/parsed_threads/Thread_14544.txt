<s> What is the difference between pc3200 and pc3200u (u=unbuffered?) </s>
<s> Shouldn't this be important enough to mention on web sites like www.crucial.com? </s>
<s> (I may know viruses, but memory escapes me - www.schiffkey.com) </s>
<s> Suspect buffered -unbuffered is addressed on mem mfg websites...sure its not there ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You're right--it's not very conspicuous: http://www.crucial.com/kb/KBSearch.asp?SearchTerm=unbuffered&Category=&go=go </s>
<s> Thank you ! </s>
<s> Strange how I would notice - over many years - the 8 larger black chips - but never notice that one, much smaller, tiny black chip. </s>
<s> So &quot;registered&quot; chips are the ones with the &quot;U&quot;. </s>
<s> These chips have a clock cycle delay. </s>
<s> The Unbuffered chips are the one without the &quot;U&quot; (sounds like reverse polish notation). </s>
<s> It also means I can not &quot;mix and match&quot;. </s>
<s> But in this case: I can remove the 256mb unbuffered chip, and replace it with two 256mb registered chips. </s>
<s> Thus putting 512mb safely on the computer - a step up. </s>
<s> Of course, this all assumes the chips &quot;fit&quot; (one versus two notches - and not on a Dell which moved the notches thus making their memory &quot;propriatary&quot;). </s>
<s> instead of about the RAM that doesn't work. </s>
<s> To be honest I doubt the RAM is proprietary unless the original MB is a server board....cause all the PC66, PC100, PC133 that I've seen is on the same PCB design ...168 Pin SDRAM with 2 notches...some single sided, some double sided. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The primary question was general in nature: A customer had given me a few choice sticks of RAM instead of CACH (cache? </s>
<s> bad pun? </s>
<s> )So, when I went to CHEQUE (check) the ram, found it had that U (pc3200u) whereas other sticks were w/o the u (pc3200). </s>
<s> As for the more specific nature of propriatary RAM - check out a DELL motherboard: The notches on most(?) </s>
<s> sticks of RAM are off by a fraction - thus forcing you to buy ram directly from Dell instead of your friendly neighbourhood computer warehouse. </s>
<s> &quot;IBM compatible&quot; could mean compatibility with any number of computers produced over the past quarter century. </s>
<s> Too vague. </s>
<s> If the notches are misaligned, even by a little, you're probably using the wrong type of RAM. </s>
<s> The best way to learn what type of RAM works or is compatible with a computer is to go to the computer model's webpage and look at its specifications. </s>
<s> BTW, WHAT DELL MODEL IS IT? </s>
<s> An alternative is to enter the computer model number at a site like Crucial.com or Kingston.com. </s>
<s> They will display information on what of RAM they sell is guaranteed to be compatible. </s>
<s> You could also download and run CPU-Z ( http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php ) to learn all sorts of information about the RAM modules currently installed in the computer. </s>
<s> It is yet another way of learning what TYPE of RAM is compatible with your computer's motherboard. </s>
<s> It will even give you the manufacturer name and model number of the RAM module. </s>
<s> The 'u' that you see may be part of a model number scheme for a specific manufacturer and not necessarily part of an industry standard designation. </s>
<s> 184 pin, buffered and unbuffered and the DIMM notch is slightly off-center. </s>
<s> If we knew what PC mfg and model number we could probably back into the RAM type. </s>
<s> Your call. </s>
