1.1.1	I just installed my mom 's wireless router for her .	St
1.1.2	Long story short , it took six hours .	St
1.1.3	Who knew that the only WEP key that would work correctly is the first of the four ?	Ques
1.1.4	Why even give me for if three of them do n't work .	St
1.1.5	Anyway , I 'm terribly concerned about this new fangled wireless internet .	St
1.1.6	I have two Bellsouth Fastaccess DSL connections in my house .	St
1.1.7	The one I 'm posting from now is mine and a trip to dslreports.com tells me that I 'm sitting pretty at a 2980kbps download speed .	St
1.1.8	My upload speed is a meager 319kbps , but that 's not what the problem here is .	St
1.1.9	My mom 's DSL , post-wireless connection , is chugging along at about 150kbps down .	St
1.1.10	That 's awful .	Polite
1.1.11	Her upload speed is fine , it 's in the 290 's .	St
1.1.12	I checked her speed before I switched her over to wireless and it was going just fine at about 2900Kbps .	St
1.1.13	I was using her connection for a long time because mine was accidentally cancelled by the geniuses at Bellsouth .	St
1.1.14	And I never experienced terrible connection speeds .	Polite
1.1.15	Wireless is n't suppose to do this to a connection , right ?	Ques
1.1.16	Are there any settings I 'm missing the resolve this issue ?	Ques
1.1.17	The icon in her system tray says that it 's connected at like 54Mbps .	St

1.2.1	What you did to check that the units were not on the same RF channel ( I read your post twice and it appears you have 2 wifi routers . )	St
1.2.2	Or how you tested your site to see which channel is not used as much in your neighborhood .	St
1.2.3	What many forget is that when we go wireless we now SHARE the air around us .	St
1.2.4	Besides the items I noted so far a recurring glitch is out of date firmware and no one reads the manuals or takes a class .	St
1.2.5	But it 's fun to dive in and figure out this stuff .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'll be checking the drivers to make sure they 're up to date the next chance I get .	St
1.3.2	My other router is actually not wired , I 've only got the one wireless router .	St
1.3.3	How would I check to see what channel is not used as much in my neighborhood ?	Ques
1.3.4	I only pick up on one other wireless network in my neighborhood .	St
1.4.1	The FIRMWARE in the router is often out of date and/or buggy .	St
1.4.2	As to the channels , not only could a neighbor be on the same channel but who 's saying it 's WIFI .	St
1.4.3	So we test at channels 1 , 5 ( or 6 ) and 11 to see what works best .	St
