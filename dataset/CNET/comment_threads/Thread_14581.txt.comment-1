Hello, I have a home network with router Linksys WRTU54G-TM.
I have moved my home-office upstairs and would like to use D-Link TM-G5240 as a wireless bridge that would connect 3 wired computers and 1 wired printer to the network.
I have tried configuring the TM-G5240 according to the owners manual, but the manual is decidedly thin on details.
The last thing I did was to give the D-Link TM-G5240 a static ip address on the home network (192.168.
0.140), and to communicate on the same channel (6) to the home network SSID on the Linksys WRTU54G-TM ip address (192.168.0.1) using the correct wpa password.
When I try to renew the ip address of a wired computer I see activity on both the wireless and port lights on the TM-G5240.
The wired computer never gets a good ip address.
Instead it gets a 169.x.x.x address.
Please help
