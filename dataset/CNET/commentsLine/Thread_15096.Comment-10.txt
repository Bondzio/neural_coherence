i have a similar issue with an ibook g3 not connecting or accepting my wpa password for my wireless network.
all other computers in my home accept it but this one and i have other macs.
i am not familiar with vpi & vci could you be a little clearer for me and walk me through what you are suggesting so i can try to fix?
thank you!
