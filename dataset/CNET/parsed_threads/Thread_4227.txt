<s> Specs: 160 GB Maxxtor HD Windows XP Home nforce 2 mobo (with dual channel ram capabilities) nvidia geforce 4 mx 4000+ AMD athlon XP 3000+ Today I purchased 2 PNY sticks of 512MB DDR ram. </s>
<s> I have one already in my computer, but another brand. </s>
<s> I have 2 banks on my motherboard, 3 slots. </s>
<s> I put the new RAM into bank 1, and the older one into the second bank. </s>
<s> i start Windows and after a minute or so or windows being loaded, I get a BSOD. </s>
<s> I got this twice. </s>
<s> (I have the details if needed). </s>
<s> I remove the old ram, and everything works fine, for about an hour. </s>
<s> Then my computer randomly reboots. </s>
<s> i start t back up, and get the same thing. </s>
<s> the only thing I figure culd be wrong is my VDD power voltage. </s>
<s> I set it at 1.6 v, but everytime i start up, stats like the voltage and temps show up, and its red and only showing 1.3-&gt;1.45v. </s>
<s> I dont know what the deal is. </s>
<s> Thinking this problem was with windows and the software, I decide to restore my computer. </s>
<s> After backing up and everything, I put all of the ram in and begin the process. </s>
<s> at 11% formatting, it freezes completely. </s>
<s> So, this must be a hardware problem...ive used each of the ram seperatly so I know none of them is bad. </s>
<s> But I cant get them to work, and I dont know why. </s>
<s> Whats the deal? </s>
<s> I thought this would take about 5 minutes and id be all set...not the whole damn day. </s>
<s> &gt;_&lt; P.S. </s>
<s> Im 100% sure the ram is compatable with my mobo and it can handle that much </s>
<s> 3 memory slots work with Dual Channel??? </s>
<s> That might be part of the problem. </s>
<s> Give the manual a thorough read on how to install memory for dual channel. </s>
<s> I did look in the manual. </s>
<s> It said when Ihave 3 DIMMS, touse all three slots. </s>
<s> IS it not possible to have 2 ram sticks with dual channel memory? </s>
<s> Why would they give me 3 slots? </s>
<s> in the manual they say its possible. </s>
<s> OK...after a fresh install, I put in the 2 new sticks of ram (just 2) the the appropriate slots. </s>
<s> it reboot on me after less than a minute. </s>
<s> Basically, lets be honest. </s>
<s> Did you actually anti static yourself before taking the thing out of its packet and keep yourself grounded with a armband whilst you fitted it? </s>
<s> Because when i put my RAM in i forgot to do these things and it ****** the module! </s>
<s> Sensitivity starts when RAM gets bigger that 256...a 256 module is nearly indestructable but youve gotta be more careful with the bigger sizes. </s>
<s> Secondly, double check that the RAM is right for your comp. </s>
<s> Dual suggests 2 to me personally, and also check its the right speed of memory, this could explain your power issue if it was incorrect. </s>
<s> Hope this helps.. Ozz </s>
<s> number of the mobo? </s>
<s> If it is socket 754 the CPU does not support Dual Channel. </s>
