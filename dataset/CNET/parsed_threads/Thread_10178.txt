<s> If anyone has some suggestions, tips, or info on te hardware I'm choosing please let me know! </s>

<s> Hard Drive: WD Blue 1 TB hard drive Sound Card: Sound Blaster Z RAM: 4-8 GB DDR3 Graphics Card: 3-4 GB GDDR5 Power Source: Need help on this not sure about it. </s>
<s> If I left anything out please tell me! </s>
<s> Antec or Corsair that is 80% efficient at it's continuous rated power level. </s>
<s> Find a website that will add up all the power for each part of the system to find out how much total &quot;continuous&quot; (not just max) power you will need. </s>
<s> Thermal take has a great power calculator. </s>
<s> Do NOT build a gaming rig with a micro mobo. </s>
<s> You want a full size atx mobo. </s>
<s> Do NOT build a gaming rig with a small case. </s>
<s> You want a mid tower or full tower. </s>

<s> Psu? </s>
<s> Quality single rail unit. </s>
<s> Watts? </s>
<s> That will depend on what gpu you pick since you have already picked a 125w cpu. </s>
<s> an aftermarket HS Fan to provide better cooling than the stock unit. </s>
<s> Also didn't see a CD-DVD Burner/Drive....another must for me. </s>
<s> Perhaps most important....I'd be looking at other MBs.....like the GA-970A-D3P it stipulates support for the CPU you listed and rates way better based on buyer feedback. </s>

<s> It used to be true you could get more FPS or sound quality from a card. </s>
<s> This changed and now that many hook up with HDMI (with sound over HDMI) the sound card is just another item that could create problems for the new PC builder. </s>
<s> Let me be very bad here and write that very few can install Windows properly and then they complain about lockups and more. </s>
<s> WHICH IS WHY I like simpler machines for the beginner. </s>
<s> The sound card is not going to add value here. </s>
<s> I see you didn't pick a video card so please pick from THE LIST . </s>
<s> -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html You don't have to go too far up the list for great game play. </s>
