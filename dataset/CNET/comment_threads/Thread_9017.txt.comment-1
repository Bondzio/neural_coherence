Hello cNET, My name's Robert, and I recently got a upgraded video card which has been causing some issues once I installed it.
I was using a Radeon HD 4600 series then upgraded to an ASUS Radeon HD 7770.
Before installing the new card I uninstalled the old driver through Control Panel, then shutdown, installed new card, rebooted and installed the new driver.
During my gaming sessions I would notice random screen tears happening, it would only be for less than a second but it would happen every few hours sometimes back to back when it did occur.
After the tears started to become more frequent then I would be getting blue screens, I was always checking my temps they were fine, my 6pin is connected.
I then read online to install &quot;Driversweeper&quot; to remove all existing drivers that may be causing interference which I did, then after I uninstalled those drivers it had me reboot, now during startup and I can't get to my desktop without getting a bluescreen.
I was just going to whipe my computer with my Vista disk but that is not working.
Any way to resolve this without whiping my computer?
