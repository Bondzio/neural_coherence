I work at a school.
I need to be connected to the instructional network sot fix computers, monitor student usage and all around support.
I also need to be on the administration network for the same reasons.
I currently have two computers to do this.
I would like to have one computer and put my other one out for student use.
I want my Mac on the instructional and my virtual windows on the administration.
One cannot be connected to the other.
