<s> Hi all Just noticed the other day that the 1 gig of RAM in my PC is only being recognized as half a gig. </s>
<s> I'm using an ECS P4VXASD2+ motherboard (via chipset) with 1gb of high density ddr 2100 RAM on a single stick (no idea what brand) and Windows XP home sp2. </s>
<s> I remember the ad for the motherbord claiming it could use high density RAM. </s>
<s> Any ideas how to get the PC to use the full gig? </s>
<s> Maybe it's a bios thang? </s>
<s> Any help appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Why remember? </s>
<s> Be sure, read the specs either through the manual or support website provided. </s>
<s> Then find out further if your brand ram module is acknowledged as being acceptable. </s>
<s> Not all mtrbd. </s>
<s> makers provide that but many do just to prove thier product is capable, which if so is the &quot;solid&quot; basis for the specs provided. </s>
<s> Also, a ram map should explain how ram is installed/order of. </s>
<s> Plus review the bios update see where you stand with your current one, but understand what any bios update does if applicable to your problem. </s>
<s> Check the bios for the memory handling, defaults are common, but if configuable, play with it. </s>
<s> Expect some freeze-up if gotten awry, use the CMOS clearing pins to return to defaults and reset again for what works best. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> A system that only uses PC 2100 RAM is less likely to support a 1GB stick. </s>
<s> Sure there may be some that do, but at the time it was built 1GB on a stick was not a common item. </s>
<s> You might look for a BIOS update for your motherboard that will support the larger memory capacity. </s>
<s> That's is about your only chance to get the memory you bought to work to its full capacity. </s>
