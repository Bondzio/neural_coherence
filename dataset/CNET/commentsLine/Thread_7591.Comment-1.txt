hi, i need to controll 2 computers by one set of keyboard and mouse.
i do not need a kvm switch.
i need a usb switch that will keep the first km connection active even when i am connecting to the second computer so that when i connect back to the first it would not give me the &quot;hud&quot; pop-ups each time.
any idea what i could use?
thanks!
