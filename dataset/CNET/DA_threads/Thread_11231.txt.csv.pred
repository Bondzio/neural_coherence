1.1.1	Okay for the last 2 days I have been trying to switch my primary monitor over to my Radeon X1550 Graphics Card, the problem is in display settings when i click the box for &quot;Make Primary Monitor&quot; and i hit apply the screen flashes and come back with nothing changed the box is no longer checked.	St
1.1.2	This has happened on both Vista and XP.	St
1.1.3	I am currently using vista.	St
1.1.4	Its a brand new hard drive and was just recently formatted to vista/xp/vista again, before on my old harddrive after installing a new graphics card it stopped letting me change the primary driver, i am on a old Dell Optiplex and this is the computer i wish to fix.	St
1.1.5	Okay now for what i have done.	St
1.1.6	&gt;&gt;I have updated all drivers for the graphics card.	St
1.1.7	&gt;&gt;I Have updated Vista to Service pack 2 (before hand it the graphics card wouldn't work properly or install) &gt;&gt;I have disabled the old Intel graphics which did work and switched the radeon to be the primary monitor but it had the old intel on extended and when i tried to removed that option on the intel it all reverted and stayed on the intell port saying the default monitor was on radeon.	St
1.1.8	(the monitor was still plugged into the original monitor plug in) &gt;&gt;Yes the card still works, I am allowed to set it to extended desktop but not switch it to my primary monitor.	St
1.1.9	&gt;&gt;Yes it has the option to be the primary monitor as i have done it before on this very computer and on another computer that has vista installed.	St
1.1.10	&gt;&gt;Yes i have looked through google but cannot find an answer to help me.	St
1.1.11	&gt;&gt;Yes both the card and computer are cleaned out of dust.	St
1.1.12	&gt;&gt;Yes i have switched monitors and the other one didn't change anything.	St
1.1.13	&gt;&gt;No I am not interested in buying a new card/computer upgrading this one as i plan to purchase a new computer as soon as i can and keep this one with the card and all parts intact.	St
1.1.14	Thats all i can currently remember and i can't think of anything else to try aside from calling dell which they rarely can help Thanks in Advance.	Ques
1.2.1	I saw no mention of motherboard drivers or if the BIOS primary display was looked at.	St
1.2.2	Also, don't we use the extend my desktop before we play with primary/secondary?	St
