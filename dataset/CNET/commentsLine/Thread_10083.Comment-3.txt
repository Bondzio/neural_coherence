you didn't indicate where you were looking at the specifications.
looking at hp and compaq official sites (course we know hp purchased compaq some time ago) the the compaq sr1010z only goes as high as amd64 3300, whereas the hp a850e has the amd 64 3400 and can be configured higher, so that is one part of the difference.
overall using your selected components i figure about $80 difference which is worth getting the hp over the compaq.
for compaq sr1010z click  then click customize for hp a850e click  then click customize
