8109	0	52302	623709	NR	dsaranti	12/20/04 2:12 PM	1.10355192E12	XP print crashes	Hello, my PC is Windows XP SP 2 RAM 1024, Pentium 4 @3.0, 120GB disk. I had a Canon S400 printer and very often when using the print command the PC crashed. I now have a HP 1100 printer with exactly the same problem. Any suggestions please? Thank you Dimitri
