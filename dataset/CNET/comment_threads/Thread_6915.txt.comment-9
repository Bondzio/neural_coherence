If you want to get rid of the ptr.
just box it up and give whatever you do have to Goodwill or Sal Army store.
I find many and usually, they're good to go and yes, I don't need the manual, just the drivers.
Of course the ptr.
works, but the cost of ink carts makes it a doubtful deal, but when then the end-users are pretty happy to pay when the cost is nominal and it works, plus usually these prtrs.
I salvage are more than simple bottom-end models if new.
Well, sad to hear the manual would cost too much.
