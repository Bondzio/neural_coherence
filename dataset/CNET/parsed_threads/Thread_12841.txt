<s> hi all, ok, so i have had rcn cable for a few years, and they charge me a $3 a month rental on the data modem. </s>
<s> they just told me they are upping the rental to $5. </s>
<s> So i looked up the modem on ebay-- toshiba pcx2500-- and i can get one for $15-20. </s>
<s> but rcn phone help says I need &quot;docsis 2.0&quot; or higher-- and all the ones for sale are docsis 1.1. any advice? </s>
