1.1.1	I was doing some digging and found that in many instances , the core i750 gets nearly equal performance with the core i7 920 in games for both single card and SLI configurations .	St
1.1.2	the 920 has hyper threading but I am not sure what the significance of this is because the threads are n't actual physical threads I am considering an upgrade and the i5 setup would be much cheaper , but I do n't know if the performance is truly equal could anybody comment on this ?	Ques
1.2.1	My new applications in .NET have more threads than my pillow case .	St
1.2.2	It 's threadtastic !	St
1.2.3	Tossing aside the financial considerations , I 'd get the I7 .	St
1.2.4	If I just needed a nice machine , I 'd get the i5 .	St

1.3.1	920 prices are down considerably altho tri-RAM will still cost you .	St
1.3.2	Since you asked , you must be somewhat price sensitive , in which case 750 will be fine .	St
1.4.1	I actually have 1 of Core i5 750 ... Works perfectly ... Link : centralcomputers.com/commerce/catalog/product.jsp ? product_id=72744	Ques
