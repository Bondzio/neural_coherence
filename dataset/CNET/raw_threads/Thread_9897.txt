Windows BT enumerator I am having no trouble adding an Android device ( HTC Evo ) however, there is no connection held after the successful password matching....... Is there a newer driver that will help this connection error? Thanks.

It does PAIR ok, but after the passphrase exchange is successful, the connection fails. I am assuming this can be fixed with a driver update, which I have had no luck finding after a pretty exhaustive search.

But I found it cheap enough at 5 or so bucks to toss (actually I give the ones I don't like away) it and replace it with units that don't need more than the native Microsoft Bluetooth drivers and stack. Since you have the packaging you stand a better chance of finding the maker's web site than most. Bob
