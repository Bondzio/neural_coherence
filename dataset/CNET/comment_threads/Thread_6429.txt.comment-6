&quot;Lexar did say I should have formatted the card in the camcorder before use.
But I've never had to do that before... card comes formatted so I just thought it was ok to use that way.
Not sure I understand why a card must be formatted in the camera before use.&quot; That advice is well known and accepted as correct.
While using the card without doing so works fine in what must be 99.9% of the time, it's that last 0.1% that can cause folk grief.
To explain why takes me about 5 minutes to cover entirely one on one over coffee so I'm keep it short to &quot;it's good advice.&quot; Bob
