I've put the recovery disk in but it doesn't offer me the choice to fix that drive, it's reformat all or nothing DVD's, the drive doesn't think there's anything in there. CDR/CD-RW when I try to burn (with XP or Drag 'n Drop CD) it appears to start the burn, then craps out at the end, and leaves me with an unreadable disk, a coaster or a Frisbee. If anyone can offer some help please do. I let the drive slide for a while but a month ago, I had a baby girl and it's time to make some CD's for the grandparents. Thanks, Charles

Uninstall and reinstall the CD recording software. 5. Install CDBURNERXP and use that. Hint: google.com 6. Replace the drive. Might be under 99 bucks if you do it yourself. Bob

I have a Toshiba DVD-Rom SD-R2212 that will read and burn CDs and data discs, but will not recognise a DVD. I used to be able to play DVDs on it without any problems. I even switched it from region 1 to 2 when I moved abroad, and had no trouble with it. Then one day, I went to play a DVD, and suddenly I got &quot;Please insert disc into D drive&quot;. HUH!?!? Did I not just play a DVD, like, a week ago? I have no way of reinstalling the DVD software that came on the recovery discs without doing a complete system restore (which, owing to half my doctoral thesis being on my hard drive along with numerous other VIP docs, I'm loath to do); I have used a lens cleaner to no avail; and I'm a wuss when it comes to registry modification. So unless I wipe the hard drive, I have no way of knowing precisely what the problem is, because every time I've done a troubleshooting test, the drive is supposedly fine; the drivers are up to date; and XP recognises the DVD-Rom portion of the combi drive. Anyone have any suggestions? Or should I just ignore it and get back to researching?

I though &quot;great,&quot; and I'll try to see if DVD read functionality has been restored later. Before I tried to see if I could read a DVD(about a week later) my whole drive disappeared! It's not listed in My Computer, I can't find it in the device manager and if I try to type in &quot;D:&quot; to a address field it comes up with [Cannot find 'file:///d:/'. Make sure the path of Internet address is correct.] Any ideas on getting my cd rom drive back?

I have to take out a few screws and then get a pair of pliers to pull on the chassis to pull it out. I was doing this to get some more info on the drive to place an order. It wasnt easy to get it our and it didnt want to come out but I got it eventually. Recorded the info I needed and for the hell of it cleaned the connections and re inserted the drive. (I didnt want to leave a gapping hole in my laptop). When I turned it back on and booted up my D drive was found again?!? (Bad-dirty-connection, I dont know) But it works again. Can read CD and Write CD, havent tried read DVD yet but I will. Thanks for all the help and suggestions.

If you want to reinstall the DVD software that came with the computer(WinDVD)uninstall it first by going to:Start Menu,Control Panel,Add or Remove Programs. Find it on the list and click Remove. To reinstall it go to: C:/, HP,Programs,DVD. Click on the file named Setup. An instilation wizard will come up and install it. If you don't want to wipe the hard drive because you has important things on it, it would probably be best to put it all on CD's so you don't loose it if something happens to the computer. And if you copy everything you need to CD's or DVD's it isn't that hard to wipe the hard drive and reinstall everything. If you decide to wipe the computer and have troble with an error message that says &quot;Wrong Model Notebook&quot; I can tell you how to get around that. If you get it working let me know.

I think the Drive has finally bit the dust it doesnt' recognize any disks in the drive and it doesn't spin. Do you know where I can pick up a new drive? A good store or on-line store? Do I need to go to Toshiba? I live in Asia so; the vendor would have to be able to ship internationally.

It plays audio-CDs but doesnt even recognize DVDs anymore. So has anyone found a solution to this? or, I have to simply junk this and try to get an external DVD player or what?
