1.1.2	I want to buy a new PC that can handle the games bellow at full settings + recording at full size without lag (for me that means steady 60+ FPS).	St
1.1.3	What do you think?	St
1.1.4	My budget is around 1100$ or 800 I live germany but have the option to go to the US from time to time.	St
1.1.5	For the first step it would be good to find the parts that I need even if it goes above my budget.	St
1.1.6	Then we can find sales where I can match my budget.	St
1.1.7	List of games: -Splinter Cell Chaos theory -Splinter Cell Double agent -Splinter Cell Conviction -Call of duty 5 -Call of duty 6 -The elder scorlls 4: Oblivion (Guilds, expansions, Arena and main quest.)	St

1.4.2	I looked and coudn't find forums.	St

1.8.3	I have done that.	St
1.9.1	Sorry but this is where I'd ask such a question.	St

1.10.1	There is only the support there.	St
1.10.2	Any other things I can do?	St
1.11.1	Frankly I think you may want to tell me you didn't buy the software.	St
1.11.2	Maybe that's why all these posts.	St
1.11.3	Here's my thought on this.	St
1.11.4	Get some nice quad core machine, and those higher end GPUs and you're done.	St
1.11.5	If you want NO LAG you'll have to wait another year.	St
1.11.6	Bob	St
1.12.1	Are you saying that I downloaded the software?	St

1.13.2	You may need some on site help or training.	St

1.14.1	I found the members area with ease but I didn't find the forum that F*cking doesn't exist.	St
1.14.2	Sorry, about the parts you suggested a bit more exact would be great with motherboard and case psu etc...	St
