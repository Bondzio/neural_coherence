my xp home system just started telling me that it does not detect the hard drive on boot.
i used revovery from the xp install cd and ran chkdsk /p and chkdsk /f and fixmbr and fixboot.
it found errors with the chkdsk /f, but i thought it fixed them.
still doesn't see drives on boot.
bios setup doesn't see them either.
my question is: do i need a new hard drive to fix this or is it something else?
