i have both of these problems!
flakey ink, on certain metallic papers more than others.. and, the waking itself up all the time is really annoying.
i'm still not certain this printer is the solution to my invitations.
the next step, from what i can see, is a much more expensive printer, as i've had 3 other xerox's that didn't work out, even up to $1400 range.
on top of that, i'm not pleased with the service xerox provides on the phasers.
you get delegated to &quot;the phaser department&quot;, which is not open evenings or weekends (which of course, are the only times the printer has problems!).
they also take a full day to get their local techs to call and schedule an appointment.
so far, the techs out have not solved any problems without creating more.
and when you call and get through to the phaser support people, they run through the simplest and most obvious things that i've usually already done to try and fix the problem myself.
