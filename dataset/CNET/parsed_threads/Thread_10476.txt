<s> I just bought a Maxtor OneTouch 4 Plus (external harddrive) for my iBook G4. </s>
<s> I'm running OSX 10.4.l0, and the drive mounts fine, and I can drag files on to it and everything. </s>
<s> However, the one-touch feature does not seem to work. </s>
<s> Maxtor Manager opens, but when I click &quot;Backup Now&quot;, nothing happens. </s>
<s> How can I fix this? </s>
<s> I don't know if the Backup feature of this drive actually works with OS X, it may do but I did not find anything definitive about it on their website. </s>
<s> As it works with Windows and Mac OS, I have a feeling that this drive is formatted in FAT or FAT32. </s>
<s> This allows it to work, out of the box, on almost any machine. </s>
<s> It is, however, a notoriously fickle and unstable format for your data. </s>
<s> You would be well advised to format this drive in HFS+ (Journaled) for your data's security. </s>
<s> You can do this via Disk Utility. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> ... more stable than HFS in everyday use, but it's not a Mac-friendly format with many restrictions in how big files can be, etc. </s>
<s> Reformatting as HFS makes sense. </s>
<s> It also depends on how complete a backup you want. </s>
<s> If you want to be able to boot off the drive and restore a completely usable backup, I'd suggest going for alternative third party software like Superduper (as opposed to the Retrospect that I believe is shipped with the Maxtor). </s>
<s> http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html It's nowhere near as good as some Windows solutions, but it's probably as good as you're going to get on a Mac. </s>
<s> After some dozens of drives brought in for recovery with said combo I've seen tears over the losses. </s>
<s> There's a free lesson here. </s>
<s> post your problem in a new thread. </s>
<s> Seems like you have more problems going for you than just the hard drive one. </s>
