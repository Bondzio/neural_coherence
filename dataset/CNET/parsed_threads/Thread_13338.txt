<s> I'm considering doing the switch and getting a mac laptop in the near future (after leopard comes out, that is), and I was wondering if there's any reason to get the macbook pro over the regular macbook. </s>
<s> I'm going to be doing mostly regular computer tasks, like word processing, internet browsing, more than a bit of photo editing, and a lot of music playing (not much video/audio editing that i could think of). </s>
<s> Would it be worth it to get the pro just for the discrete graphics card, processor that's a little faster, and a 2 inch larger screen? </s>
<s> Does it make that much of a difference, and is there anything that I'm missing that'd make the pro the (much) better choice? </s>
<s> go for the regular MacBook. </s>
<s> It's perfect for what you need it for. </s>
<s> The pro will be overkill, IMO. </s>
<s> As far as screen real estate, I find the MacBook's 13.3 inches a lot roomier than I had imagined. </s>
<s> Why not go to an Apple store and play around to see which screen you like better? </s>
<s> cool, thanks. </s>
<s> i'll definitely do that. </s>
<s> would i need a discrete graphics card if i want to run boot camp with vista though? </s>
<s> Firstly I don't understand why you want to install Vista. </s>
<s> Why do you want to use a lesser OS when you have a superior OS. </s>
<s> The Macbook, *currently* has an integrated graphic card which take s aaway a bit of your Mac's RAM. </s>
<s> For Vista this MIGHT work. </s>
<s> But I am pretty sure that for Vista premium with the Aero theme and all the fancy stuff, you will need a powerful graphic card, maybe even more powerful than the Pro's card. </s>
<s> Maybe the Macbooks will get updated or maybe they wont come out at all. </s>
<s> If you DO need Windows, then you can install XP which is in some ways better than Vista. </s>
