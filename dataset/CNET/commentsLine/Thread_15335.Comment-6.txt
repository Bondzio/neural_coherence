you may consider a few programs that dell installs to be junk or clutter.
i understand, but i don't think it's as bad as you portray it.
to me, this is like complaining about finding a few cigarette butts on an otherwise pristine beach.
you could hire a cleaning service to remove them, but why not just dispose of them yourself, save some money, and enjoy the beach?
i do see a disconnect between your complaint and the fact that you are considering high-end gaming systems.
if you want to maintain a gaming system and actually play games, you will have to be more of a &quot;techie&quot; than just knowing how to disable or uninstall two or three &quot;junk&quot; programs that dell includes.
as for realplayer and similar programs, go into its preferences and remove the 'x' next to the automatic procedures you don't want.
an alternative is to go to the add/remove programs control panel to completely remove whatever programs you don't want.
