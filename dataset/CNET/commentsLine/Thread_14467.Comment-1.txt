hi, in the very near future, when all the ps3 buzz settles down, i would like to purchase the ps3 unit along with the gran turismo hd (as i've invested in steering wheel/pedal hardware in the past).
and to certainly take advantage of the &quot;high definition&quot; output of the ps3 and gt hd, i would need a 1080i display.
but i don't want to invest a couple of grand in a large 40 or 50-inch family room lcd/plasma display, but instead would like to upgrade my current viewsonic 17&quot; crt monitor and get myself a either a standard or a widescreen lcd computer screen.
if that's the case, would i be able to take the hd (hdmi?)
output of the ps3 and display it on the computer lcd screen?
would there be a conversion with cables/adaptors that i'd have to use?
the ps3 is already a big investment itself, so i'd like to balance it out with a lcd display that would be used for my regular computer games, internet surfing, digital image editing, etc.
appreciate anyone's feedback!
paul
