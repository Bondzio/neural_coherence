thank you for your suggestion.
i continued to play around with this set up and discovered that on the desktop i can access the netbook by accessing the &quot;workgroup&quot;.
on the netbook i can access the desktop with &quot;network places&quot;.
i do not know if that is the best or correct way but i have been able to transfer data and that is what i wanted to do.
when i delete a folder in the &quot;share document&quot; folder it does not delete the original, does it?
