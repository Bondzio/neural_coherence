They have a support website and provide the details you need. They really do, check there. Since laptops vary, I &quot;assume&quot; this maybe one where you lift the kybd. up by unlatching a 2nd set of locks where you lift the lcd up(when latched), check there. That's a guess... Next time, give *FULL* details of what your model is. tada -----Willy
