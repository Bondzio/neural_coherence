To stay within the forum discussion of hardware, you would add more RAM and move to a larger disk.
However in the Computer Help or the OS Forum, they may suggest deleting old files, and streamlining the OS.
But since this is a hardware forum and you didn't tell what OS, I'm left with the hardware suggestions.
