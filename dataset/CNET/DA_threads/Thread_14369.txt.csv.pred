1.1.1	My socket 775 motherboard died about three months ago ( verified by the Geek Squad at Best Buy ) , and my hubby purchased a replacement on Ebay .	St
1.1.2	I was planning to install it myself , but he claims we have to download all sorts of drivers and involves more than either of us can handle .	St
1.1.3	He purchased the board without consulting me , but claims he verified with the seller that everything should match .	St
1.1.4	The computer is custom-built ( from a barebones kit ) , Windows XP Pro , DDR .	St
1.1.5	It was built by an acquaintance , but we live more than two hours away now , and none of the local computer shops have good reputations .	St
1.1.6	Please let me know what 's involved and whether I should try installing the motherboard myself .	Sug
1.1.7	I 've installed and formatted a hard drive , and stuck extra memory chips into the motherboard , but would n't consider myself a computer whiz by any stretch of the imagination .	St
1.1.8	Many thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	But I ca n't comment on the driver issue since the fine details are not available .	St
1.2.2	Also I ca n't comment if you 'll need a new OS .	St
1.2.3	For instance some HP/Compaq/other owners get a rude shock when they replace their boards .	St

1.3.1	Bob , Thank you for your quick reply !	St
1.3.2	Here is the type of MB my hubby purchased : INTEL P4 HT LGA 775 FSB 800 DDR 400 ATX MOTHERBOARD+L+S I asked hubby for more info on the computer ( he bought the kit and helped his friend build it ) , but he said he could n't really provide any more info than I did initially .	St
1.3.3	According to the USPS , it 's now in Maryland ( we live one state over ) .	St
1.3.4	Thanks , Bindarra	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	From that I 'm going to guess it 's your everyday home built PC .	St
1.5.2	The only issues will likely be that XP may not boot .	St
1.5.3	Do n't panic since there are articles aplenty to deal with that .	St
1.5.4	Here they are - & gt ; http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=XP+CHANGE+MOTHERBOARD & btnG=Google+Search Most of them offer advice on drivers as well .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Bob -- Thanks for all your advice .	Polite
1.6.2	Unfortunately , we ran into an unexpected delay -- Best Buy misinformed us about the type of board I have .	St
1.6.3	When they diagnosed it as dead , they told me it was a socket 775 .	St
1.6.4	When we opened it up , however , we discovered the malfunctioning board was a socket A/462 .	St
1.6.5	Thankfully , the gentleman my hubby bought it from consented to a switch , and we 're waiting for the 462 to arrive .	St
1.6.6	I do have one question from reading the links you posted : if I need to reinstall some Windows files , will that erase my hard drive ?	Ques
1.6.7	I have a lot of stuff on there I want to preserve !	St
1.6.8	I 'll post again once we get this done -- I 'm sure I 'll run into problems and will need your expert advice once again .	St
1.6.9	B	St
1.7.1	It will note & quot ; Change motherboard and save OS. & quot ; Also known as the XP REPAIR INSTALL .	St
1.7.2	Of course with any such change there are no guarantees your hard disk will keep your files .	St
1.7.3	That 's why you read so much about backup .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	After all this time , I wanted to let you know what happened .	St
1.8.2	Basically , everything failed .	St
1.8.3	The first Socket 462 motherboard would n't fire up , although the power supply came on .	St
1.8.4	A friend gave us another one , never removed from the box ... and the power supply would n't even come on .	St
1.8.5	So I 'm giving up .	St
1.8.6	Repairing this computer is obviously a money pit , and no one seems to be able to diagnose just what is wrong with it .	St
1.8.7	I 'll probably buy another barebones kit from Tiger Direct , although I 'm so bitter about this , my third consecutive faulty computer , that I may not buy another one .	St
1.8.8	Anyway , thank you for your assistance .	Polite
1.9.1	new hardware on the bench ( outside the case ) before putting in the case .	St
1.9.2	Much easier to figure out what 's wrong and try different parts should the need arise .	St
1.9.3	Better luck on the next one .	St
1.9.4	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
