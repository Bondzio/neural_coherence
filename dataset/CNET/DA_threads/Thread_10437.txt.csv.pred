1.1.1	Hi , Currently I have a 1TB mechanical hard drive on my custom built PC .	St
1.1.2	I want to switch over to a solid state drive .	St
1.1.3	However , I am looking to save some money , so I had an idea to buy the cheapest , and therefore probably the smallest SSD available , probably around 30-60 GB .	St
1.1.4	I wanted to move my operating system and any necessary files to get my computer to run onto the SSD , and then have my extraneous files such as photos , music , documents , and possibly even programs onto the mechanical hard drive .	St
1.1.5	Is there an easy way to accomplish this ?	Ques
1.2.1	There is .	St
1.2.2	Buy a SSD ( 60 GB at least ) and install the OS on it from the Windows disk , the drivers from the driver disk ( s ) and the application from their setup .	St
1.2.3	Then add the original drive again , delete the Windows folder and the folders from Program Files you do n't need any more .	St
1.2.4	That leaves the data .	St
1.2.5	Then move your new Documents folders from the SSD to the hard disk .	St
1.2.6	Done .	St
1.2.7	Kees	St
1.3.1	Ok , that makes sense .	St
1.3.2	However , is there anyway to preserve my existing state of Windows 7 , as my PC being custom built I had to install a buttload of third party drivers which would be a pain to reinstall .	St
1.3.3	Does the Windows Backup feature selective backup where you can choose what to back up ; I 've never used it before .	St
1.3.4	Also , you think I need a 60GB ?	Ques
1.3.5	I figured 30 should be pushing it but it would be fine right ?	Ques
1.4.1	Also , would it just be better to set up RAID 0 with this configuration ?	Ques
