1.1.1	Hi , we 've just got a new MacBook and have been trying for days to get it to connect to our router .	St
1.1.2	Here are the details : It 's a Netgear DG834Gv3 with the latest V4.01.40 firmware .	St
1.1.3	We 've tried ( amongst others ) WPA-PSK with a network key composed of 19 letters/numbers .	St
1.1.4	We 've tried broadcasting it on channels 09 , 11 and 06 .	St
1.1.5	& quot ; Enable Wireless Access Point & quot ; , & quot ; Allow Broadcast of Name ( SSID ) & quot ; are checked and & quot ; Wireless Isolation & quot ; is unchecked .	St
1.1.6	It is set to mode & quot ; g & b & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	The Wireless Station Access list is turned off so anyone can join the network , provided they have the passphrase .	St
1.1.8	The MacBook is the latest 2.1 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo with OS X 10.5.6 .	St
1.1.9	It has been serviced .	St
1.1.10	The MacBook will connect to other wireless networks and our Netgear will connect to all our other devises but not the MacBook .	St
1.1.11	It insists that the password is invalid when we select our network - either that or it just says & quot ; connection timeout & quot ; .	St
1.1.12	We 've tried disabling the Netgear security altogether but the MacBook just asks for a WEP password .	St
1.1.13	Please , can anyone help us ?	Ques
1.1.14	I have no idea why it wo n't connect .	St
1.2.1	Why I ask is someone did that and promptly began asking questions not unlike yours .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	There is no firewall set on the MacBook , that I know of .	St
1.3.2	The security settings preference pane is set to & quot ; Allow all incoming connections & quot ; .	St
1.4.1	http : //docs.info.apple.com/article.html ? path=Mac/10.4/en/mh1042.html Also try our Mac OS Forum since we have someone that is very Apple there .	St
1.4.2	Sadly I 'd call the router maker and lodge your complaint fast .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	but sadly that 's not an option , Netgear have nightmare callcentres - Indian phone operators , premium call costs , long holds , making one set up an account so that they can send you promotional e-mails - the works .	St
1.5.2	I think it would cost more than the price of the Router .	St
1.6.1	My calls have been not so bad .	St
1.6.2	Here , everything works fine but I do n't have that model of router .	St
1.6.3	Shame .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	This is a regular complaint -- but the upside is that their user forum at www.netgear.com has to be pretty good and one of the moderators uses Macs .	St
1.7.2	Incidentally I 've had problems connecting a friend 's Mac laptop and desktop to two different routers ( Zoom 802.11B , D-Link 802.11G ) .	St
1.7.3	The laptop would connect to the Zoom but not the DLink and the Desktop would only connect to the DLink .	St
1.7.4	Maybe something to do with WEP vs WPA -- we spent a week on this and gave up on the laptop .	St
1.7.5	I suspect Apple want you to buy their router .	St
1.8.1	Oh my God , I may actually have the answer to this one ( one of the 7 signs I think ) .	St
1.8.2	I recently set up a Netgear wireless with my MacBook and was having the same issue ...	St
1.8.3	I was told to set the VPI # to 0 ( zero ) VCI # to 32 BAM it was working .	St
1.8.4	Just a thought .	St
1.8.5	Hope this is right .	St
1.8.6	CJG	St
1.9.1	I have n't tried connecting the MacBook to it , but when I applied your settings the computer the Netgear is wired to could not load any Web pages .	St
1.9.2	The original setting are : Multiplexing Method : VC-BASED VPI : 0 VCI : 38 DSL Mode : Auto ( Multi-mode ) Are these alright ?	Ques
1.10.1	I have a similar issue with an ibook g3 not connecting or accepting my wpa password for my wireless network .	St
1.10.2	All other computers in my home accept it but this one and I have other macs .	St
1.10.3	I am not familiar with VPI & VCI could you be a little clearer for me and walk me through what you are suggesting so I can try to fix ?	Ques
1.10.4	Thank you !	St
1.11.1	Like I said , it was kind of a miracle that I had that much of an answer , I think it will take a call to Netgear to get you the rest of the way , sorry .	St
1.11.2	Problem seemed familiar so tossed out what solved it for me .	St
1.11.3	CJG	St
