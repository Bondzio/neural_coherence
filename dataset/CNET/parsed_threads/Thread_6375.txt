<s> I feel so embarassed. </s>
<s> I have searched high and low for a straight answer but I can't seem to work out how to create a home wireless network in my house. </s>
<s> I don't know whether it's so easy it's not published anywhere or whether I'm missing something or what but I can't find what I think I'm looking for and it's so common I feel embarassed. </s>
<s> So I turn to you guys. </s>
<s> Apologies if you think I'm an idiot but please help me out, I am for real. </s>
<s> I have a PC running Windows XP upstairs with a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> If a machine is to act as like a server then this is the one I'd want it to be. </s>
<s> Downstairs I have a Netgear wireless router which is plugged into my DSL line, acting as the modem my crappy ISP gave me for free. </s>
<s> With an ethernet cable I have my Xbox plugged in to this. </s>
<s> Then I also roam the house with a laptop running Windows Vista. </s>
<s> Oh and my flat mate also has a laptop running Windows XP. </s>
<s> All I want to do is set up a home network, wireless of course, that enables me to see all devices (PC, laptop, and Xbox) on the network, from each machine. </s>
<s> I want to be able to transfer files between machines over the network and be able to communicate with my Xbox from my PC or laptop. </s>
<s> I would also like my flat mate to be able to tap into the network when he likes so we can transfer files between our computers. </s>
<s> I plan on hooking up a printer to the router at a later stage for shared printing too. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> That's all I want to do. </s>
<s> Is that so hard? </s>
<s> So what I'm after is a step-by-step guide on configuring this. </s>
<s> If someone could point me in the right direction I would be eternally grateful. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time </s>
<s> The step by step is still only a GUIDE and will never match exactly what you see on the screen. </s>
<s> I hope this explains that issue well enough for you. </s>
<s> As to your issue today, you omitted the part names, models, makes, how it's connected so there is little more I can offer except to note that the usual cause of not seeing file and printer shares are FIREWALL settings. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Could you point me in the direction of them guides then please? </s>
<s> If you look to the top of this forum http://forums.cnet.com/5204-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62 Networking & wireless we have a forum sticky about suggested settings. </s>
<s> Your router maker's web site will have the manuals and more guides. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I use a program called Network Magic that automates many of the functions you are attempting to do. </s>
<s> There is a free version to download and try. </s>
