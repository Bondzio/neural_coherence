hi!
i'm a c-64 nostalgic too, though the first computer i got close to was a swtzc6800 (motorola 6800 based computer) with not built-in tape interface, which had nothing pre-loaded : you had to load basic langage first, from a regular tape recorder (not a special one) plugged into the above mentioned interface which looked like a boeing control board.
once basic was loaded (several minutes), you could begin programming... or load your program from the same tape recorder.
the funniest about it was, guess what, it had no screen!
no kidding, the user interface was...the printer : a telex printer with a keyboard that did the noise of a trash crusher truck : teleprinter ksr430 : look at this  it was the computer's age of bronze (not stone).
later i got a c64 that was customized (a reset button was added close to the joystick port).
at school, they had some apple ii (c and e i think), i still remember the magic of simon's basic!!
i remember stroker 64 too.
lol.
at university, i worked on a vax with vt240 and tektronix terminals, while at home, the pc niagara began : 8088+8087 (math copro), 80286-386-486-pentium i,ii,iii,pro, and on and on....
