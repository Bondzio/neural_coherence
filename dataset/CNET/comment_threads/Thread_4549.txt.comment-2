If you are running Winxp, you might want to go right click on my computer -&gt; properties -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Device manager -&gt; DVD/CD rom column.
Is there a question mark?
Another thing you could do is make sure your IDE cable is connected properly to the motherboard.
Check the pins configuration.
Pin 1 should go to Pin 1 on motherboard and CDROM.
I got that mixed up sometimes.
