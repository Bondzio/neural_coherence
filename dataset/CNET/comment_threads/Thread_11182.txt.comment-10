Control Panel&gt; Add Remove Programs&gt; Uninstall ATI Software Utility.
After I did this, everything was gone.
I have the Gateway 827GM which has the same Mother Board.
I contemplated with installing a NVIDIA card but opted against it and installed the X700 Pro.
No complaints and no headaches so far.
