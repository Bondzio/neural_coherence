hello and thanks for any help.
i have a new desk top, dell 530s, o.s.
vista and a nine year old dell dimension xps--o.s.
windows 98, second edition.
i'm connected to the internet on the new computer with the wired modem i had on the old computer.
i want to connect the old computer, now in another room, to the internet through the new computer's internet connection--is this possible and what do i need to do this?
i have ordered a wireless router, a belkin n+ 802.11 n, but do i also need another wireless card for the old computer --as you can see, i don't understand what i need.
do i need a usb adapter??
(not sure what that is --or an access point?--not sure what that is either.
i appreciate any answers.
thanks again!
