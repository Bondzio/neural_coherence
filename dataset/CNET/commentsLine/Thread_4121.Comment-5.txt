three years ago i assembled a system i thought would be more than adequate for hobbyist video production.
one erroneous idea that led to problems was my naieve assumption that one of the (then) highest rated video+pvr solutions (ati all-in-wonder 9800 pro) and one of the (then) most recommended audio solutions (creative soundblaster audigy 2 ex) would make a superior combination.
the two devices never worked well together.
after my purchases, i discovered that the big pc vendors, including dell's, online pc configuration tools (the ones you use to choose all the options before placing a purchase), would not permit the buyer selecting those two components for the same pc.
since then, i have used dell's (and other companies') online pc selection tools as a first-pass method for research compatibility issues.
each manufacturer should also provide compatibility info on its web site.
i managed to get my system to hobble along, but--in retrospect--should have either done more research or purchased a pre-assembled pc from a mainline vendor.
incidentally, though it is possible to put together a pc that will suffice for hobbiest multimedia production, my next multimedia computer will be a mac (as another writer suggested).
