<s> I had an old Maxtor 160GB one-touch Firewire/USB drive. </s>
<s> The hard drive died so I replaced it with a Seagate 160 and stuck it in the old Maxtor enclosure. </s>
<s> Now the drive will only format to 128GB. </s>
<s> Why should the change of drive brands matter? </s>
<s> Can I get this drive to format to 160? </s>
<s> If I pull the drive and stick it inside my PC to format it to 160 and then stick it back in the Maxtor enclosure, will that work? </s>
<s> And how do you format the drive? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> It's Windows XP SP2, and I partitioned and formatted it using Windows Computer Management. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The enclosure is a Maxtor Personal Storage 5000DV. </s>
<s> Not sure what the drive is without taking it apart to look, I just know it's a Seagate 160GB that is less than a year old. </s>
<s> I tired downloading the Seagate formatting software that says it addresses this issue but it is only for ATA/SCSI devices. </s>
<s> If the original HD in that enclosure was less than 137GB, then the enclosure may have a 48-bit LBA problem. </s>
<s> This is a limitation of the enclosure's circuitry and not the HD. </s>
<s> http://www.48bitlba.com Solution: Purchase an external enclosure that is specified for use with larger HD's. </s>
<s> * * * * * Alternatively, did you try different jumper settings on the HD? </s>
<s> Try MA, and then repartition and format with NTFS in Disk Management while in the enclosure. </s>
<s> Result? </s>
<s> Try CS, and then repartition and format with NTFS in Disk Management while in the enclosure. </s>
<s> Result? </s>
<s> Firewire on Windows for disk drives has been flighty at times. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Jumper is currently set to the CS position (that's what the original dead drive was set to when I removed it). </s>
<s> I tried using MA but the drive wouldn't even mount (the drive light just stayed on solid). </s>
<s> I've also tried using both the FW and USB ports. </s>
<s> The old dead drive was a 160 too, so I can't see why this shouldn't work. </s>
<s> I think I will try formatting it internally, I'm just worried it will cause data loss if I stick it back in the enclosure and it can't access the extra space on the drive. </s>
<s> I'll have to test it out before using it. </s>
<s> The drive does the same thing using USB 2.0 as FW. </s>
<s> Was the old drive a Maxtor? </s>
<s> OK, I took the drive out of the fiewire enclosure and I installed in internally on my IDE controller. </s>
<s> Same problem! </s>
<s> Since I'm already running two Maxtor 250GB drives on my XP SP2 system I know I can handle large drives, so I am stumped. </s>
<s> I tried the LBA registry fix anyway, it told me I didn't need it. </s>
<s> I tried using Seagate's Disc Wizard to format the drive, it won't parition it over 137GB either. </s>
<s> So where is this limitaion coming from? </s>

<s> So where is this limitaion coming from? </s>
<s> My BIOS also sees this drive as 136GB... even though it also sees my other large drives at their full 250GB capacity. </s>
<s> It's a pretty new BIOS (2004), so why does it like one drive but not another? </s>
<s> I just updated the BIOS to the latest version (2005), and also the VIA chipset drivers. </s>
<s> The problem still persists, the BIOS still reports the drive as 136GB instead of 160 but sees my other large drives just fine. </s>
<s> And one more time (sorry I missed it) what is the exact model number so I can see if this drive has a 127GB limit feature. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> it's a Seagate ST3160023A. </s>
<s> Seagate DiscWizard reports it as 137444 MB. </s>
<s> Found the following at: http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/specs/ata/st3160023a.html ''Some systems BIOS have capacity limitations. </s>
<s> Types that have been identified are: a 2.11GB or 4095 cylinder limitation a 3.26GB or 6322 cylinder limitation a 4.22GB or 8192 cylinder limitation a 8.45GB Standard INT13 limitation (CHS[1024x256x63]x512) a 33.8GB or 66,060,287 LBAs limitation a 137.4GB or 268,435,455 LBAs limitation (28-bit limit) and, if exceeded, may cause the system to hang during boot, capacity reduction or it can truncate or wrap the cylinders when auto-detect options set in the CMOS. </s>
<s> New INT13 Extensions and LBA mode in BIOS and FAT32 or NTFS-based file systems are required to acheive full capacity. </s>
<s> FAT32 file system can create single partitions and logical drives up to 2TB. </s>
<s> FULL-CAPACITY solutions include third-party drive preparation software, system BIOS update which supports LBA mode or third party bios driven host adapters.'' </s>
<s> Based on your previous post, it would seem there is some type of incompatibility between your BIOS and this drive. </s>
<s> Yet, your other drives report properly. </s>
<s> Are those drives also Seagate or a different brand? </s>
<s> The issue certainly lies within the BIOS or this drive and based on Seagates own documentation, this has been seen before. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, a solution evades me. </s>
<s> It will be interesting to see what some of the recognized experts here come up with, because as of now, I am completely stumped. </s>
<s> The one thing I would try is to manually enter the hard drive info in the BIOS instead of allowing it to auto-detect. </s>
<s> Other than that, consider me clueless. </s>
<s> The other drives are Maxtors. </s>
<s> It must be something in this drive, because it has the same limitation problem in the firewire enclosure which should be independent of the BIOS. </s>
<s> But still, a modern system less than a year and a half old with the latest BIOS and chipset drivers should certainly be able to handle drives over 137GB under any conditions. </s>
<s> FWIW, my BIOS won't allow manual setting of the heads and cylinders to set the drive size, so I'm stuck. </s>
<s> I can manually set it to LBA but it still makes no difference. </s>
<s> Did you delete all partitions and create one new partition before trying to format the HD while connected as an internal? </s>
<s> yes, I've deleted the partitions many, many times. </s>
<s> you said &quot;The hard drive died so I replaced it with a Seagate 160&quot; was the seagate new/out of the box? </s>
<s> if not, it may have some sort of disk management program blocking access... jonah . </s>
<s> In these cases, I like to start fresh and totally wipeout the drive. </s>
<s> I use KILLDISK of the same website name(get it) and use it. </s>
<s> Once done, the HD has no record of anything to confuse itself. </s>
<s> Further, work using your system with the trouble HD by itself(alone) and unplug all others. </s>
<s> That way you safety deal only with that problem HD. </s>
<s> Here's the Seagate support website, that can further clarify any capacity issues and others. </s>
<s> http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/137/index.html Remove HD from firewire case and connect to your system. </s>
<s> Run Killdisk, once done, reboot and have XP CD(or seagate s/w) in order to format and prepare the HD. </s>
<s> If it still only allows 128gb storage and you have all the OS updates, etc. </s>
<s> to allow full capcity then the HD flat out doesn't like your system. </s>
<s> Find another system(friend's) and try there. </s>
<s> Still fails, you got a physical HD problem(it works) it just won't allow full use of the HD gb's. </s>
<s> However, don't expect the total 160gb be avaialbe as the OS takes some for itself(managaement). </s>
<s> You can try using the latest Seagate HD install s/w one more time. </s>
<s> If none of this works, then the HD. </s>
<s> As I stated above Seagate addresses issues about capacity, its just the way it is. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> It's possible something got written to the drive and started this problem. </s>
<s> http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/specs/ata/st3160023a.html is noteworthy in a few places but since Seatools calls it a 136GB it's hard to argue with that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since the BIOS sees it as a 137GB disk, I don't think it has anything to do with anything ever written to the disk, or with any windows drivers or anything. </s>
<s> This is strictly a harware issue. </s>
<s> And yes, the drive was new out of the box. </s>
<s> That's your choice here. </s>
<s> http://www.48bitlba.com notes the 127GB number many times. </s>
<s> After all this, call it in and get the drive exchanged. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, looks like I'm at the end of the road here on answers. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone who helped out! </s>
<s> i also have this drive and had similar problems. </s>
<s> it works fine when i used it with windows 2000 pro, but not with xp. </s>
<s> the only work around i found was to use windows disk management tool to partition this remaining space. </s>
<s> if the space is too small, you can always create a smaller primary partition, which then increases the space for the 2nd partition Marc </s>
