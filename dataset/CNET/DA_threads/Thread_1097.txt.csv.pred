1.1.1	my external recently died and idk if theres a problem with the wiring or the actual hd and when i plug it into my comp , everything works fine , the usb recognizes that its plugged it , the lights on my external go off , and it makes the same sound it does when running .	St
1.1.2	however , the external hd does not come up under my computer and my computer acts like its not there .	St
1.1.3	i was thinking of buying a new enclosure and transfering the hd to see if that would work , but i wanted to check to make sure the hd is not fried before i did that , so is there anyway i could put the hd from the external into an old computer ( replace the hd , i do n't care for lost data on either hd ) to see if the hd is fried or not ?	Ques
1.1.4	what other choices do i have in terms of saving and being able to use the hd , because its fairly new and i didnt want to have to buy another one : /	St
1.2.1	old external HDD before getting another external case , VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	If you want to test the drive to see if its just the external case that is the problem , take the drive out of the case .	St
1.3.2	The drive shoudl be either IDE or SATA .	St
1.3.3	More likely SATA if it is newer and IDE if it is older .	St
1.3.4	Once you have the drive out of the case , you will be able to slide the contoller off the HDD and see the type of connection the HDD uses .	St
1.3.5	At this point all you need to do is plug the drive into a computer using the IDE or SATA cable and then boot up and see if the drive is recognized .	St
1.3.6	Make sure when you do this you do not disconnect the drive currently in the computer because you will need to boot from it .	St
1.3.7	The drive in question should show up in my computer as a secondary drive if it still works .	St
1.3.8	If you do this and do not see the drive , the drive is bad .	St
