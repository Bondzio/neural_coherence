<s> Here goes: In the boot screen there is that &quot;Memory dual channel interleaved&quot; and bellow that there are 4 channels where some coding is written next to them or simply the word &quot;None&quot;. </s>
<s> Now there is the thing some times when i turn on the pc, one or more of these channels have nothing written next to them, they are completely empty fields and then the booting stucks there until i turn off the pc (force restart button doesn't work either when that happens so i have to keep the power button pressed on until the system passes out). </s>
<s> The restart usually doesn't fix the problem so once while experimenting i tried to unplug and plug again the wires connecting the motherboard with the other parts, or plug them on different slots. </s>
<s> Its a dumb technique i know but it seems to work for some time (god knows why i really can't understand how it works but it does, my friends don't even believe me!!) </s>
<s> but unfortunately the incident happens over and over every 2 weeks or so and i have to go through it again. </s>
<s> Anyway i'm planing to replace my old Ati 5570 with a GTX 660 which i can barely afford and i don't want to risk burning the card if my system is malfunctioning. </s>
<s> Anybody experienced anything similar so far and came up with a solution? </s>
<s> If yes please let me know if there are any parts i should replace and have my system working properly again (low cost solutions please i don't want to buy an entirely new pc). </s>
<s> MY pc specs are: CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 Motherboard: GIGABYTE G41MT-D3V Graphics: Ati Radeon 5570 2 GB RAM:4.00 GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 533MHz (8-8-8-20) PS: Sorry if my english are not good enough i tried my best. </s>
<s> Remove and reinstall each ram stick. </s>
<s> Make sure their nice and firmly seated......test. </s>
<s> Maybe grab a copy of Memtest.......use goggle. </s>
<s> Let it fly for 10/12 hrs. </s>
<s> The odd start issues are traced to the usual items. </s>
<s> I'll let you do more research on the first with google. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> BAD CAPS. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If it worked before (you didn't tell) then my first thought is an old PSU or item 1. </s>
<s> But to fix this we pop in a new motherboard. </s>
<s> There are some owners that want it to be software but at boot time, Windows and drivers are not loaded so it's not software. </s>
<s> If something tinkered with the BIOS that's easy too. </s>
<s> Load the defaults and try again but the age of the board and system tells me it's item 1, PSU or just old gear. </s>
