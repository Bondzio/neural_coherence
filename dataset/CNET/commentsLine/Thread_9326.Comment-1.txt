anyone have good ideas about good reliable medium out there?
other than dvds, is there something convient for easy add and delete feature like how usb drives work?
i tried that feature from burning software that gives your cd- rw the easy add and delete feature like floppy.
but the problem was it seemed that i can only like view, add and delete with the writer i burned with i think.
thats not very practical cuz if that burner ever dies i wont be able to access mediums with floppy feature that is created from that.
