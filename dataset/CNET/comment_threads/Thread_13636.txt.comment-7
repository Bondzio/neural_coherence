Hi, I tried posting a reply twice with no luck so hopefully this one is not duplicating my previous...I have a Netgear at home (with three computers linked to it), but recently I had to hook up a Linksys to a friend computer so their laptop could operate wireless, etc, eytc...I had a similair problem to yours and had to go to my Internet page, type in 192.168.1.1 and access the router home page...From their I had to click on Mac Address Clone (not sure if this would be the same with Netgear or not) and noticed Mac Address was &quot;disabled&quot;...Once I enabled it, all IP Address problems were self corrected within seconds...Not sure if this will be the answer to yours but I certainly would look into it...
