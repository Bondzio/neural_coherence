<s> Hi, i have been having problems with my computer for about a month now. </s>
<s> After endless troubleshooting a have come across this problem. </s>
<s> My system specs are ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe MOBO AMD Anthlon 64x2 3.2ghz 8800 GTS 550W Antec PS 2 WD Caviar 320gb G Skill DDDR2 800 2x2gb Okay. </s>
<s> My problem is i am getting the error 132 in world of warcraft, and my computer keeps blue screening with nv4_disp.dll and IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL and PAGE FAULT IN NON PAGED AREA. </s>
<s> when i go to turn it on after it has been shut off over night, i have to keep turning it off and turning it on until it boots. </s>
<s> All the leds light up on the case, all the fans spin but i get no picture on the monitor. </s>
<s> Sometimes it will boot to the POST screen but freeze there then ill have to reboot it and it will boot all the way into windows. </s>
<s> Last night i was playing wow and kept getting the 132 error. </s>
<s> Also my graphics suddenly got all messed up and i couldn't see Firefox, wow was all black with colors everywhere and the icons in windows were all discolored. </s>
<s> Something that confused me though was the sound was all crackly and messed up when this happened and my sound is on board... </s>
<s> I think im pointing towards the Power supply but idk. </s>
<s> I replaced the RAM and the HD but it still didn't fix my BSOD problem. </s>
<s> The booting problem started just a couple days ago as i have been troubleshooting this computer for about a month now. </s>
<s> The CPU runs idle 50C and under work like 71C. </s>
<s> I did a stress test using HIRENS boot cd and the CPU failed immediately. </s>
<s> The memory and HD both passed without and problems. </s>
<s> I have tried everything from replacing the HD and RAM to flashing the BIOS to reformatting like 5 times. </s>
<s> Please can someone point me into the right direction, i know its a hardware issue but idk what. </s>
<s> I have had this computer and it has worked fine for over a year. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP SP2 Home Edition and also, the computer sometimes restarts itself without warning. </s>
<s> Automatically Restart on system failure is unchecked. </s>
<s> Retest after each idea. </s>
<s> Leave the case cover off throughout. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Remove the case cover. </s>
<s> NO! </s>
<s> It's not what you measured, it's all the other parts that may be a little hot. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Run with less parts. </s>
<s> You can pull 1 stick of ram and unplug one hard disk. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Build ideas. </s>
<s> Let's hope the drives (both DVD and HDs) are not stacked against each other. </s>
<s> Space them out. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The BIOS and memory speed settings. </s>
<s> SLOW as possible until the issue is solved. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> More BIOS settings. </s>
<s> NO OVERCLOCKING! </s>
<s> We want stability. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> And what about the Vram or memory voltage setting? </s>
<s> I can't tell if you got that right. </s>
<s> (no part numbers to look for.) </s>
<s> To help with this I need a link to the exact ram you bought. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231122 all of the BIOS settings are set to automatic and it has been runnig stable like that for over a year. </s>
<s> The system just keeps restarting on me so i moved to a different computer. </s>
<s> im really thinking the power supply is going bad. </s>
<s> nv4_disp.dll is a Nvidia file. </s>
<s> I see you use a 8800. </s>
<s> I do too. </s>
<s> This means the problem resides in your 1)Video system and 2)Video hardware. </s>
<s> You most likely have a life time warranty on that card and will be able to get a direct replacement for free. </s>
<s> I did and I also updated my drivers. </s>
<s> My asus board has the LED panel on back and I noticed when it failed to POST that it stopped on VGAINT. </s>
<s> Which turned out to be the 8800 failing to start. </s>
<s> It's not your WOW, cause I have managed to duplicate the problem in a multitude of other games. </s>
<s> Also let me know if you overclock your system and what you overclock including voltages. </s>
<s> Also let me know the manufacter of your GPU. </s>
<s> My guess if I am right will be BFG? </s>
<s> Tell me what your BIOS set for Cas Latency, Timing, and Voltage (Vram or similar.) </s>
<s> I'm not telling what these should be because I want you to tell me what you see first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> all of those bios setttings are set on automatic. </s>
<s> i do not overclock any of my stuff and my card manufacture is EVGA </s>
<s> the manufacture is EVGA. </s>
<s> i didnt register it beofre 30 days after purchase and the 1 year is already up so i dont have any warrantys on it. </s>
<s> could the card be causing the boot problem and when hte video messed up the sound messed up also which is on board. </s>
<s> could the video card cause the sound to mess up and the booting/restarting problem. </s>
<s> people have said the nv4_disp.dll sometimes isnt caused by the video card but i know its the main driver for it. </s>
<s> unfortunately, it's not that simple of a fix. </s>
<s> read this thread for info: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4665618171&sid=1 there's a bunch of threads on nvidia's forums also. </s>
<s> recommend you uninstall all nvidia drivers and delete all your mobo/chipset devices in device manager. </s>
<s> then reinstall the latest mobo software and the latest stable (non beta) graphics drivers. </s>
<s> i installed that patch and going to see if my computer crashes. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> nope still crashing :\ </s>
<s> At http://www.asus.com/999/download/products/1163/1163_10.pdf I can't find the ram you purchased. </s>
<s> This means we have to manually make sure the settings are spot on. </s>
<s> Go get CPUID from http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/Cpu-Z-Review-38137.shtml Share the screen shot like this one -&gt; http://news.softpedia.com/images/reviews/large/CPU-Z_04large.png and http://news.softpedia.com/images/reviews/large/CPU-Z_05large.png on photobucket. </s>
<s> Supply all if possible. </s>
<s> Your board? </s>
<s> http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?modelmenu=2&model=1160&l1=3&l2=101&l3=301 http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/socketAM2/M2N-SLI%20Deluxe/e2651_m2n-sli_deluxe.pdf That PDF shows that you do have control over the RAM settings. </s>
<s> I see a simple choice here. </s>
<s> Use RAM from the QVL or dive in and ask them for the settings. </s>
<s> I see the settings but don't post them here since I want you to tell. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I would suggest you try some isolation test. </s>
<s> I do not think your mobo comes with integrated graphics, so lets say a cheap $50 ATI card will do or borrow one from a friend. </s>
<s> Swapping out your 8800 this way will pinpoint your issue (hopefully). </s>
<s> My guess is that your system will normalize. </s>
<s> Also it is worthy to note 550w psu actually runs at 85% of that. </s>
<s> I know the 8800 take quite a bit of power. </s>
<s> If you do the swap and your still having issues, let us know. </s>
<s> Also check those other forums and as much as it sucks, attempt to contact tech support at EVGA or Nvidia. </s>
