During reformatting of a desktop PC (Pentium D 3GHz, P5GC-MX ASUS motherboard, 80GB HDD), i noticed that the fixed 8MB unpartitioned space is showing only 2MB.
The PC is working OK but the speed is a little bit slow.
Moreover, it is showing errors during installation of some softwares like Adobe Reader, Nero, etc.
What is the actual problem?
