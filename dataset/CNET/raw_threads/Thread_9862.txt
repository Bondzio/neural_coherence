My ISP DSL provider is Verizon so in their website they recommend a Linksys Wireless Router and a Linksys Wireless USB adapter using 802.11 b wireless technology for your home network. Let say in short that installation was a nightmare with long calls to tech support, but at the end everything was running, I web browsing and checking emails my daughter playing internet base games, then I got bite by the game bug buying Guild Wars a massive multi player online game. Then a month ago my network started crashing first once or twice a week now almost daily made the calls to tech support both the ISP and Linksys they run me like a circus monkey, changing settings, disconnecting both modem and router rebooting my computer to get the network back up. Now I can connect the modem directly to my computer and every thing is working fine connect the network and is unstable at best, I am unhappy with this arrangement so please help.

I did update the firmeware to the BEFW11S4 and it worked great. My dad's router died so I shipped him my BEF and now have some dlink 524 router (which I also got to update the firmware.) Here's the recap: 1. Latest firmware for the BEFW11S4 or don't complain. 2. Consider the WUSB11 may be not that great with your selected OS or system. If latest firmware and drivers don't make it work, then toss it. Remember to get it all working without firewalls or WEP before you turn on the security. Bob

It's newer and better technology--much more reliable in my experience. Hey, if the equipment is still under warranty, try to return it for credit towards a wireless-g model.
