1.1.1	I just finished building a system with an Ultra Tower case , an Intel D975XBX mobo , a Pentium D processor , and an MSI Radeon 1300 video card .	St
1.1.2	Everything works fine , except for the audio .	St
1.1.3	I can not get any sound our of the back panel ports .	St
1.1.4	Aditionally , the Front Panel audio cables that came with the case are seven cables independently labeled Mic Power , Mic In , Ear R , Ear R , Ear L , Ear L , and GND .	St
1.1.5	Because they are inidvidual cables , I do n't know how they would map onto the motherboard 's audio headers , which are label differently : ( Pin 1 ) Port1L , ( 2 ) GND , ( 3 ) Port1R , ( 4 ) Presence # , ( 5 ) Port2R , ( 6 ) Sense1_Ret , ( 7 ) Sense_send , ( 8 ) Key ( no pin ) , ( 9 ) Port2L and ( 10 ) Sense2_ret .	St
1.1.6	No help from either Ultra or Intel , can someone help ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you .	St

1.4.1	Thank you very much .	Polite
1.4.2	This is just the info I was looking for .	St

1.5.1	Does your microphone work OK ?	Ques
1.5.2	Typically I have used a boom mic placed on the desktop .	St
1.5.3	With this mobo I had to hold the boom mic next to my lips to get any pick up at all .	St
1.5.4	Tried switching to headset and attached microphone and still can only just get faint pickup .	St
1.5.5	Same problem with front panel and rear panel connectors .	St
1.5.6	Adjusted everything than I can see and can make it no better .	St
1.5.7	Machines is multi boot with xp pro and xp pro x64 .	St
1.5.8	Same problems on both .	St
1.5.9	Wonder if it is some issue with the Intel supplied audio software but there is no way to uninstall that I can find so short of re-installing whoile OS that ca n't be done - close to doing that as I am a Skype user and this machine can not be used for that the way it is Any ideas ?	Ques
