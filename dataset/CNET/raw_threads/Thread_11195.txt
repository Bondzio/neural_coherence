The problem is whenever I plug the adapter in the rear port usb ports I keep getting an usb device not recognized. I installed the drivers before I plugged it in but that wont work. When I install the drivers, I go to the game controller properties and its not there. I then tried another game adapter and it worked. The adapter keeps making windows xp say usb device not recognized and a window shows something that says unknown device. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that doesnt work. The adapter comes with a driver cd and I used that. I downloaded a driver from the radioshack site and it still doesnt do anything. Sometimes when I plug it in it says found new hardware adn ready to use but nothing shows in the game controller properties. I used it before before I reinstalled xp due to a mobo replacement and it worked before. Any help on this?

I have one for my gamecube and it works when playing PC games like gta or halo. It worked before I reinstalled xp and now when I plug it ,it keeps saying usb device not recognized. I dont have the receipt and the adapter doesnt have a brand name except for radioshack.

Wow, you could have just gone to CompUSA and get a rumbleshock PC gamepad for only 20 bucks after mail-in rebates( depends on where you live, I live in Millbrae, California)

I dont know how It worked before I put a new motherboard in. Its not the usb port because another adapter I have works. I have the original packaging but not the reciept . I need some way for it to get detected. It keeps saying unknown device in device manager and has no !,? or x next to it. It says drivers are not installed when they are.

I bought my xbox-to-PC adapter there for really cheap, and that thing works flawlessly... Happy Hunting!!!
