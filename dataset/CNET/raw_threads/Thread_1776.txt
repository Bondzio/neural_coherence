I'm running a 5 year old Dell that has had no problems other than the time I installed some beta software and had to reinstall Windows. I needed some help with that. Macs aren't a consideration for me but I do appreciate your response.

Does Windows even ask? Something's very wrong with Windows in my opinion. It treats our files with such disrespect and installing does take a guru. Why not switch? Bob
