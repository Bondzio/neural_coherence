it is more likely with the age, you would experience an issue such as this.
if this constantly reboots and fails to post, (before windows) sounds like a hardware issue.
(maybe you proc overheated, something like that).
if it is getting to windows boot screen, then restarts, your windows is bluescreening and the startup and recovery option is to automatically restart on those types of errors.
so let us know, if it only stays on for like 4-6 seconds before it reboots, that would be failing to post and is most likely a hardware issue.
let us know!
