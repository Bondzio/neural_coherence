i now have a basic understanding, but don't understand why i cannot just ignore my c drive-2 gb, fat16, and work from my new d drive- 36 gb, fat32, with nothing on it.i will go thru the tutorial again, but in the mean time, is there a way i can use the hp recovery disk, down load to the d drive and use that platform?
