So, I want to buy a WinTV-pvr-250 MCE so I can record me playing on my Wii. the thing is I want to see the game at the same time on my TV(Samsung LN-T3253H). Can I plug my video card to my TV and my Wii on the capture card so I can play my game normally? Or is there a way I can play my game on my TV and record at the same time? OS: windows XP Video card: 7600 GS Thank you!
