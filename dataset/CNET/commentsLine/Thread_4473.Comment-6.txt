well, my friends are fine xd its my friends of friends that are a little outgoing and brutal =p yeah, she beat the crap out of it then when she started it up she apparently said &quot;i think it got a virus&quot; with all serious-ness too.
i couldn't help but laugh.
anyways, i just received the laptop for free and if i could fix it i still get to keep it.
soooo, lets say that the hard drive is able to work it just isn't.
how would i go about fixing it in its current state.
it is still doing the checking disk thing where it says xxxxxxx free clusters processed.
would this clean up all the bad clusters?
then after this what would i do to continue fixing it to eventually get it in working order?
