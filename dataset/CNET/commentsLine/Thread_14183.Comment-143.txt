i waited almost a year to decide between the apple ii and the atari 800. finally, it was the atari's better graphics that won me over.
i still have that machine and it still works!
talk about reliability!
it came with a fully loaded 48 kb of ram and i bought the atari basic cartridge.
my programs were all stored on tape cassettes and, sadly, most of those are all dead now.
it was a great machine for home use.
it was purchased on a deep discount sale at sears for about $600 (regular price was $999), and this was 1981 dollars.
translated into current money, that $600 is about $1,415 for a machine running a cpu at 1.79 mhz and with a 320x192 maximum graphics resolution.
times have changed, but like i said, that old machine still works like new - though i don't dust it off much.
