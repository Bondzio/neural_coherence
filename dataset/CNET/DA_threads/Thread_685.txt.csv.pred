1.1.1	In configuring a new desktop PC for purchase ; one model by Velocity Micro offers several types of Pentium 4 processors to choose from while another model offers Athlon processors to choose from .	St
1.1.2	Is one type of processor considered to be better than the other ?	Ques
1.1.3	My computer needs are for word processing ; email ; internet use and personal finance ; no gaming or digital photography as of yet .	St
1.1.4	For example Velocity Micro offers the following P4 processor on their SX-V Value Edition : Intel Pentium 4 530 w/HT , 3.0 GHz , 1MB Cache , LGA775 Socket .	St
1.1.5	For an extra $ 75.00 I can have the following : Intel Pentium 4 630 w/HT , 3.0 GHz , 2MB L2 Cache , EM64T , XD , LGA775 Socket .	St
1.1.6	Is this worth the extra $ 75.00 just for basic home office computer needs ?	Ques
1.1.7	My configuration for a Velocity Micro SX-V Value Edition is as follows : SX-silver case-mid tower-silver w/2 front USB 2.0 , removable front door .	St
1.1.8	350 watt power supply with single fan* *Extra cost option is a 500 watt power supply w/dual fans .	St
1.1.9	Should I consider the 500 watt PS w/dual fans or stay with the 350 watt PS with a single fan ?	Ques
1.1.10	Intel 915G based chipset w/dual channel DDR PCI express motherboard ; this is the only one offered .	St
1.1.11	Intel P4 530 with HT , 3.0 GHz , 1MB cache , LGA775 socket .	St

1.2.1	This could be debated for a long time .	St
1.2.2	& quot ; My computer needs are for word processing ; email ; internet use and personal finance ; no gaming or digital photography as of yet. & quot ; With the needs you have stated a $ 500 EMachine would do the job .	St
1.2.3	None of the examples you listed are for an Athlon processor .	St
1.2.4	So if you think you might get into gaming then go with the AMD .	St
1.2.5	Since you did n't give your budget or the total cost of the systems it 's hard to say .	St
1.2.6	John	St
1.3.1	Sorry about leaving out my budget for purchasing a new desktop PC but I am willing to spend up to $ 1,200.00 on a new desktop PC but I also have no intentions of purchasing a new desktop PC from manufacturers such as Dell ; Gateway ; or HP because of issues I have with each company 's tech support which are primarily based in India or the Phillipines ( sp ? ) .	St
1.3.2	I was for a time seriously considering purchasing an EMachine T6212 but in the last month or so I have read many unfavorable posts in this forum by owners of EMachine 's T6212 .	St
1.3.3	Many posts in this forum by owners of the EMachine T6212 indicating problems with things such as the HD ; the DVD drive ; the sound card and such and since I prefer not to go down that road I have shifted my attention to another desktop PC ; one offered by a company by the name of Velocity Micro ; their SX-V Value Edition .	St
1.3.4	I have read many good posts about it in this forum .	St
1.3.5	Velocity Micro also offers another machine which I believe is or was called the Vector PC-X which could be configured with a choice of Athlon processors as well as started out with a smaller HD choice ; an 80GB vs a 120GB HD which is currently the smallest HD offered in the SX-V Value Edition .	St
1.3.6	If an 80GB HD was offered on the SX-V Value Edition ; based upon my present computing needs I probably could get by with an 80GB HD verses a 120GB HD since my current old dinasaur ( SP ? )	Ques
1.3.7	desktop PC has only a 4GB HD .	St
1.3.8	The system which I configured several weeks ago on Velocity Micro 's website and listed in my previous post in this forum came it at just under $ 1,200.00 .	St
1.3.9	Thanks for your post .	St
1.3.10	Big Steve End Of Reply 05/25/05	St
1.4.1	All the problems I 've read about were minor things that did n't affect every T6212 owner out there .	St
1.5.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=103382 & messageID=1185313	St
1.6.1	I have had zero problems with eMachines ' technical service .	St
1.6.2	I had one hard drive and a 17 & quot ; monitor replaced , under warranty , prepaid shipping both ways .	St
1.6.3	They shipped FEDEX , no hassles , and I highly recommend them .	St
1.6.4	In contrast , DELL is H # LL .	St
1.6.5	Real pain-in-the-pocket .	St
1.6.6	I do not recommend them , not only for their warranty policies , but their internal hardware is unique , to say the least .	St
1.6.7	The Dell Dimension 3000 has proprietary metal cages for the hard drive , etc.. What they omit is the proprietary cage to install a floppy disk drive , or a second hard drive , etc. , etc .	St
1.6.8	If you fail to order & quot ; upgrades & quot ; at purchase time , you 're stuck .	St
1.7.1	Why not save a @ # $ % load of $ and build the machine you want , instead of settling for a machine that will fit most of your criteria .	St
1.7.2	You could even start with a bare bones unit and design it for upgradability and expandability based upon your percieved or planned future needs and desires .	Sug
1.7.3	It makes no sense to pay labor $ $ to have some company build a machine you really do n't want	St
1.8.1	Yes this would be the BEST way to go .	St
1.8.2	If your interesed in doing this repost and you will get lots of help .	St
1.8.3	John	St
1.9.1	Pentium processors work a little different than AMD 's Athlon .	St
1.9.2	Both are good , Pentium is a bit more expensive usually and Athlons are supposedly better for heavy gaming and certain digital media editing tasks .	St
1.9.3	For your needs I think going with the basic configurations should absolutely suffice .	St
1.9.4	If you get a better deal for a Pentium system than a Athlon system , go for the Pentium .	St
1.9.5	If you were to be able to chose between a Pentium system and a AMD Athlon system for the same price , go for the AMD Athlon .	St
1.9.6	By the way , the extra $ 75 bucks would get you slightly faster processing because the cache is increased from 1MB to 2MB - which comes in handy if you run several larger applications at the same time .	St
1.10.1	From tha simple needs that you just described , my old Dell P III 700Mhz would probably do you quite well .	St
1.10.2	From what you said , with the budget you have you can easily get a machime that will more than suffice for you immediate desires .	St
1.10.3	The real question is , what will you want to do in the near future ?	Ques
1.10.4	If , in the future , you would maybe go into heavy video applications , or gaming , you would need a high performance computer .	St
1.10.5	It seems that gaming , and its related type of applications , Video and CAD are what drives the building of ever faster systems .	St
1.10.6	From what yu have described , about all that you would need would be a 2.2 Gz+ CPu , 40+g hd , 32 meg video card , 256+ ram .	St
1.10.7	All of which could probably be gotten for about $ 400 to $ 600 , including shipping .	St
1.10.8	Of course if you believe that you will later want to go into gaming or video , you will need to buy accordingly .	St
1.10.9	Large numbers of pictures eat up hard disc space rapidly .	St
1.10.10	Gaming requires fast CPU , Fast Video CArd , and much fast Ram , with a Fast HD ( preferably witha large cache ) Hope this helps a little .	St
1.10.11	As far as the Tech support from Dell , I find that where in the world it comes from seems to depend on the time of the day .	St
1.10.12	During the day it seems to come from the US .	St
1.10.13	Late at night from Asia .	St
1.11.1	First of all ; thank you for your comments .	Polite
1.11.2	At sometime in the future I might consider getting into digital photography ; for example taking photos of Christmas yard light displays including my own and emailing photos to friends and relatives .	St
1.11.3	As for videos ; I do n't expect to get into that ; gaming either .	St
1.11.4	What 's your opinion on desktop PC 's by Velocity Micro ?	Ques
1.11.5	I 've spoken to a sales rep one time and based upon my needs he suggested two different configurations ; one of which I posted in this forum earlier .	St
1.11.6	The two models he suggested that I consider were the Velocity Micro SX-V Value Edition or the Velocity Micro Vector PCX desktop PC .	St
1.11.7	Are you familiar with either model and if so ; is one model considered to be better than the other one ?	Ques
1.11.8	In configuring both models as an option a 350 watt power supply with a single fan was one choice or for an extra $ 30.00 to $ 39.00 depending on which model desktop PC I selected I could choose a 500 watt power supply with dual fans ; or there was another option ; for more money another power supply having some type of quiet fans .	St
1.11.9	Based upon my basic computing needs would the 350 watt power supply with the single fan be fine for me or should I consider the 500 watt power supply with the dual fans as an option choice ?	Ques
1.11.10	Previously I was considering purchasing an EMachine T6212 but as of late I 've read many negative comments from others in this forum about the T6212 so I 've decided to shift my attention to purchasing a desktop PC from Velocity Micro .	St
1.11.11	Again are you familiar with desktop PC 's from Velocity Micro and are they any good ?	Ques
1.11.12	Someone else replied to one of my previous posts and suggested that I build a computer myself ; unfortunately I lack the knowledge to build my own computer but at one time I did consider having a guy here locally who also owned a computer repair shop custom build a desktop PC for me but last month he closed his shop and moved out of town and I 'm certainly glad that I did n't go that route .	St
1.11.13	Big Steve End Of Reply 05/28/05	St
1.12.1	by your posts you are & quot ; stuck & quot ; on Velocity Micro .	St
1.12.2	For what you want to do any of the previous suggestions will do .	St
1.12.3	If you are satisfied you have done the research and are & quot ; OK & quot ; with the company get the computer and be done with it .	St
1.12.4	ps : get a high powered brand reputable PSU	St
1.13.1	To answer your question I am not & quot ; stuck & quot ; on Velocity Micro ; as a matter of fact at one time I was & quot ; stuck & quot ; on Dell then I began reading numerous negative posts in this forum as well as other forums ; including Dell 's own community forum by owners of Dell machines ; most of those negative comments concerned that company 's overseas tech support .	St
1.13.2	I then considered purchasing a PC from HP ; unfortunately the same story .	St
1.13.3	I did n't even consider Gateway since several of my relatives own Gateway machines and all have told me to stay away from Gateway ; the primary reason was their company 's sorry tech support .	St
1.13.4	Soon after I began reading posts on this website 's forum I was noticing many posts about a new desktop PC by EMachine ; a T6212 and I considered buying one and since nobody in my area sold one I drove to a Best Buy 60 miles from my home to take a look at one and began to monitor posts in this forum about that machine but it was n't too long before numerous posts began showing up in this forum ; posts by T6212 owners listing a host of problems which they were experiencing with their machines so I decided to shift my attention elsewhere .	St
1.13.5	I then noticed posts about another PC brand ; Velocity Micro ; a brand I was not familiar with until reading about it in this forum and many posts by others in this forum seemed to say good things about Velocity Micro ; particularly their Vector SX-V Value Edition .	St
1.13.6	Having read all of that the next thing I wanted to know was if any owners of recently purchased computers from Velocity Micro had experienced any issues with VM 's tech support and how were those issues resolved ; to the owner 's satisfaction or not and since VM PC 's are a bit higher priced than many other desktop PC 's I saw no harm in asking .	St
1.13.7	I submitted a question in this forum addressing such yet not one person has responded .	St
1.13.8	I find that strange considering the fact that I read many posts by others saying VM 's PC 's were good but not one owner of a Velocity Micro has chimed in on my post concerning my question of that company 's quality or level of tech support .	St
1.13.9	I am not & quot ; stuck & quot ; on Velocity Micro or any other brand of desktop PC in particular but if I were to submit numerous posts in this forum about an HP1070N then I guess that you would also assume that I was & quot ; stuck & quot ; on HP .	St
1.13.10	Big Steve End Of Reply 06/01/05	St
1.14.1	Most every PC maker has had good times and bad times .	St
1.14.2	Most of the bad times is their own doing , like Dell giving lousy support .	St
1.14.3	Which is why many of us build our own PCs .	St
1.14.4	John	St
1.15.1	Frankly speaking , not all models from one single brand name/OEM are hits or make it to the charts .	St
1.15.2	Just as some songs just prove to be hits and not all .	St
1.15.3	Keeping this in mind , I 'll give you a few things to consider : 1 .	St
1.15.4	First of all , technology which has come a long way till now should n't be having severe tech related issues or reliability problems .	St
1.15.5	A machine may not be able to deliver 100 % on the performance benchmarks but that does not mean it should present the user various bottlenecks or hiccups .	St
1.15.6	2 .	St
1.15.7	If a vendor is CONSTANTLY coming up with poor tech support issues for all or majority of its products then stay away from it .	St
1.15.8	3 .	St
1.15.9	Keeping it short , I think that the amount of effort you have already put in uptil now is enough to make you totally confused .	St
1.15.10	Had you spent this much time researching on individual components for their popularity/performance/reliability , and built a system yourself , right from a scratch , you would have been a very happy and content .	St
1.15.11	4 .	St
1.15.12	If its not too late , consider reading CNET 's DIY desktop challenge and similar articles ... ..and free yourself from all worries and vendors .	St
1.16.1	and I guess Im adding to it so here is a link to give you more to think about ... http : //web.archive.org/web/20041119093232/www.blackviper.com/TheRant/amd.htm Food for thought : All the machines you are looking at have pros & cons .	St
1.16.2	They all tend to be somewhat proprietary in that if hardware goes bad they are more difficult and exspensive to fix and not upgrade friendy .	St
1.16.3	Here is one more link please bear with me ... http : //www.monarchcomputer.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv ? Screen=CTGY & Store_Code=M & Category_Code=CU I live in Atlanta and this store is near me .	St
1.16.4	It is first class .	St
1.16.5	I get almost all my parts for my builds here .	St
1.16.6	They will build and match all components and test each system before its shipped out .	St
1.16.7	You can at least build your machine at their website and price it out with what you want before you buy .	St
1.16.8	Check it out ... TOM	St
