<s> Last I looked i couldn't find one. </s>
<s> And I would like to find one that works with avast AV (64 bit). </s>
<s> Zone alarm does not operate with XP64 and has no code project going that I know of for 64 bit OS. </s>
<s> I already have a router (Gigafast EE420-R build May 2003) with a general firewall &quot;enable&quot; switch and IP, MAC (outgoing) and Domain(incoming) filtering The router does not Log or warn of incoming pings and such - that I might put on a list to obstruct. </s>
<s> It does have an &quot;ignore&quot; ping switch which I have enabled. </s>
<s> But I would like something in place with more, broader, automatic intelligence.. and protect traffic in both directions. </s>
<s> The manual does not explain what the general firewall switch does (or does not do). </s>
<s> The product and the company are defunct. </s>
<s> Does it now have the outgoing monitoring now? </s>
<s> If not, what about Jetico? </s>
<s> Was that free? </s>
<s> I'm using Comodo on 64 bit xp. </s>
<s> Quite satisfactory... http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/ </s>
