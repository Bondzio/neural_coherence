<s> recently switching from a PC to mac, i'm still knew to the computer. </s>
<s> I switched because i thought i wouldnt have to worry bout the mac running slow due to excess software such as virus protection. </s>
<s> My macbook takes a very long time to load ALL internet pages. </s>
<s> I know my connection is fine because my old computer, which is about 6 years old, runs super quick on the internet. </s>
<s> Is there something i dont know. </s>
<s> Are there any certain settings i should be looking at? </s>
<s> i feel like i should save some money and just get dial-up!!!!! </s>
<s> I do have a cable internet connection. </s>
<s> its wired in, not wireless, if that makes a difference. </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> what web browser are you using? </s>
<s> I was also having this problem a while ago. </s>
<s> If you macbook is brand new and you haven't been using it for more than I think thirty days you can call the apple helpline, I can't remember what they did, but it certainly helped. </s>
<s> If you can't find the number for the apple helpline, I can give it too you if you need it. </s>
