1.3.1	My Dell PC only has USB 1.1.	St
1.3.2	The Western Digital USB 80bg drive I'm trying to install is USB 2.0 but is &quot;backwards&quot; compatible.	St
1.3.3	When I first installed out of the box everything worked, drive letter was assigned (I didn't put any data on it).	St
1.3.4	Then I unpluged it without EJECTING HARDWARE (as I should have).	St
1.3.5	Then when I plugged it back in, the plug and play recognized it, added it in device manager but &quot;My Computer&quot; now didNOT recognize it.	St
1.3.6	Since then I've uninstalled all usb hubs/drivers etc in SAFE MODE, restarted Windows XP, plug and play recongnizes all my devices again, but now gives me a message when I attached my USB Drive - &quot;HI SPEED USB Device added to non-hi speed usb&quot; and &quot;Problem with install device may have problems&quot; and now the USB Drive doesNOT show up under Disk Drives in Device Manager and under USB Controllers, there is a yellow exclamation point.	St
1.3.7	I have SP1 and all updates to WindowXP.	St
1.3.8	Enough info?	St
1.3.9	Thanks for any help!	St
1.4.1	You can take my word that this rarely works.	St
1.4.2	I have found no cure for this behaviour besides installing an USB 2.0 PCI card.	St
1.4.3	At least such is cheap now.	St
