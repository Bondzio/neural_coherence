your posts are not pointing to a hardware issue.
there are far too many bugs in most games for me to list here.
however there are usually forums about this game and you find folk reporting those bugs.
and however (again) i am finding folk that think there are no bugs in these games.
it's a big shock to some.
hmm, it looks like folk are talking about it and no absolute cure.
