A Gigabit router would do what you want.
But let me share something about Gigabit LANs.
You will NOT get Gigabit speed.
No hard drive made will read/write at that speed.
My Gigabit network running two IBM ThinkCenter 3 GHz processors with Gigabit and my home built 2 GHz processor with Gigabit runs on average 250-350 Mb/s speed.
Faster than my old 10/100 LAN, but nowhere near 1000 Mb/s speed.
If the above speed meets your needs then just get a Gigabit router.
