ditto on the &quot;2-wire&quot; modem.
it has an option that can be turned off; but until you do, it will intercept your web requests and deliver its own alerts instead no matter what url you type.
this has bad consequences for sites with pop-ups.
another situation is when a worm or virus (or even a poorly constructed program) makes a &quot;blocking call&quot; and nothing else, not even windows itself, can use the ethernet port until there's either a response or a timeout on the blocking call.
i think newer versions of windows (or updates to windows) converts blocking calls to non-blocking calls to avoid this problem.
if it is a laptop computer, sometimes ethernet adapters will be turned off to save power; so if your batteries are a few years old you will experience this phenomenon more aggressively.
dual speed switches/hubs can occasionally cause this problem.
cisco switches, for instance, include features to disable auto-negotiation to prevent problems that sometimes result when the pc is dancing around with a switch; each of them trying to adapt to the other.
you can disable auto negotiation in the pc too by editing the adapter settings in the device manager of &quot;my computer&quot;.
really it would be &quot;your computer&quot; since mine works well enough my laptop, however, was very aggressive about disabling the ethernet interface and turning it off over the slightest glitch.
that's a feature that can be disabled (which i did, since i use it for network troubleshooting and don't need an ethernet interface that turns itself off).
