thank you for your response.
pls elaborate i am not considering this for backup purposes, i just want a centralized location for all my media (have backups on dvd's and cd's).
cnet rates ximeta as having a good transfer speed (the fastest in the list).
nas or ndas i just want a drive from which i will be able to read/write media files (350mb - 8gb)without glitches/interruptions i am also not bothered by the requirement to install driver software for use( the number of computers that would be accessing files stored on the drive is just one) i would also like you to elaborate on the media serving shortcomings of ximeta in some detail(i just dont understand what it means) thankyou
