here's a weird one.
i've had an hp psc 1210 all-in-one printer/copier for about 5 years.
about a week ago, it kept getting jammed everytime i tried to print/copy with it.
i went through hp tech support page, and it told me to uninstall the software and reinstall.
i tried that, but everytime it got to the end of the installation process (the part where you plug in the usb cable) it didn't recognize the printer.
i tried everything to fix this, including: - multiple uninstalls followed by reinstalls - unplugging everything from every port and receptacle and waiting - downloading updated drivers from hp - turning off my antivirus and firewall during installation - running windows update - trying different usb ports and chords - reinstalling the usb drivers to the mobo - following the damn troubleshooting tips on hp - talking to an hp troubleshooter over tech support chat nothing works.
this printer was perfect a few weeks ago, and now its own drivers don't recognize it.
help!
ps - here are my specs: windows xp professional sp3, pentium d 3.24gh, 2 gb of ram, homebuilt pc with a gigabyte 81945gzme-rh mobo
