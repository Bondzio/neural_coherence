Is it OK to leave them black ? [The IP and DNS numbers would have been entered unto the routeers and access points to access the contents provided by the ISP and private Networks. My computer wouod only have to have a radio link to these hotspots and accesspoiunts. corr3ect me, if I am wrong]. Thanks. christy

You just choose which one to access...keyng in the network key if it is a securred network... As for the IP & DNS numbers, these are keyed into the modem/router of the Network your are accessing so there is no need to do that at your network adapter [[TCP/IP proprties]. However, there is no harm in doing so. However, if the numbers ar not properly keyed in at the mode/router or are wrong, you do need to, and in this case you may find a slow connection or frequent drop-line.
