1.3.1	I use 2 Samsung 213T monitors on a Radeon 1600.	St
1.3.2	It really helps to have 2 monitors the same size for applications that spread across the desktop.	St
1.3.3	The dual monitor set-up can be done in a couple ways.	St
1.3.4	I purchased a card that would support 2 monitors (there are several cards that support 2+ monitors).	St
1.3.5	This can also be done with one AGP/PCI express card and a second PCI card.	St
1.3.6	In the case of TV tuner cards, they typically will require a second card for a dual monitor set-up.	St
1.3.7	I use a program call UltraMon.	St

1.3.9	It is a real handy, reliable program.	St
1.3.10	It has a trail version for free and is registered for a price.	St

1.3.15	You can keep the windows separate and readable.	St
1.3.16	I have noticed that with dual monitors I can overload the processor much easier due to the extra tasks.	St
