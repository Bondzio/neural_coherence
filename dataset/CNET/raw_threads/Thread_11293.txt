I left it in my computer when it went to sleep and now all the root directories are there, but there is nothing inside them (it tells me &quot;Folder is Empty&quot; when I hover the mouse over a folder). Yet, the drive has the same amount of free space it did before this happened. I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that I've lost everything. I'm also afraid that I haven't lost everything, but if I remove the drive, it'll lose everything. Please help!
