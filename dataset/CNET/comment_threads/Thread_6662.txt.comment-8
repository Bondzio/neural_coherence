Not a great one but I'll take it.
One of the other moderators was having a similar RAID issue and something they wrote had me remember a rather rare issue with some hard drives.
For them they found the firmware in the drive needed updating.
Remember I don't have the full details to work with here but you are sharing some of the reasons we looked at the HDD firmware.
