I am wondering if someone can &quot;sell&quot; me on a wireless networking system or if I should just stick with good old Ethernet cables. I am only hooking 2 computers to a DSL modem. The modem is between the 2, and the distance between the 2 computers is only about 25 ft. Seems the wireless router and 2 wireless cards I would need cost way more than simply purchasing a wired router and two 25' cords. Is there any real need for me to go wireless with this setup??? Thanks for any help. L.T.

Wireless is good for laptops, or in instances where wiring would be a PITA. I have three PCs wired to my router, and the laptop travels around the house using wireless.

THEY HAD A COUPLE OF GUYS CRUISING A HOUSING ESTATE IN A CAR, AND IT SEEMS THEY COULD PICK UP EVERY WIRLESS CONNECTION ON A LAPTOP. MOST WERE NOT SECURE, AND EVEN THOSE THAT WERE COULD BE HACKED! GLAD I WATCHED IT AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO OVER TO WIRELESS, NOT ANYMORE, IM STICKING TO WIRED CONNECTIONS. HAVE A NICE ONE. PS. SORRY ABOUT CAPITALS, I HAVE AN OPTICAL DISADVANTAGE.
