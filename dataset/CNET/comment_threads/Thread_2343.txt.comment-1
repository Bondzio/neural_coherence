Would anybody out there know if the Gateway E4100 will accept an aftermarket powersupply upgrade?
This unit comes with a 250 watt supply and Gateway only has an upgrade to 350watts.
I have been advised that in order to install a new AGP video card, such as a 7600 or X1650, that I'll need a 450 watt supply.
Gateway won't tell me so I thought one of you might know.
The ccase is a mid-tower ATX style.
Thanks.
