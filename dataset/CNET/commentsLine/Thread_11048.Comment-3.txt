sorry but this issue is one of those repeating ones.
when i find a cranky drive i try the cd/dvd lens cleaner and then retest.
if i don't feel it's a software issue i swap the drive out and that cures it everytime.
what happens a lot today is that many owners don't realize how cheap these drives are.
the makers think nothing of them lasting 24 or so months.
