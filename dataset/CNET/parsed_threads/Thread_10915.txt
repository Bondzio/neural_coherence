<s> Are Pixel Shaders and Vertex Shaders Required For Games? </s>
<s> I want to play Left 4 Dead, but their is one problem. </s>
<s> Vertex Shader Ver. </s>
<s> : Required - 2.0 , I have - 1.1 Pixel Shader Ver. </s>
<s> : Required - 2.0 , I have - 1.3 Can I run that game at all? </s>
<s> I understand the game performance may be bad but I am willing to change some settings. </s>
<s> So my question is, will the game even start up, even if I lower the settings? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I could find the game's specs but I got nothing on the PC you wanted to run it on. </s>
<s> Yes, you told a little about the PC but no make, model and if you replaced the video card, what is it? </s>
<s> My bad, here is a copy of my DxDiag report. </s>

<s> Left4Dead requires a DX 9 card with pixel shader 2.0. </s>
<s> Your Ti-4600 lacks these features and the game will not run on your PC. </s>
<s> You will need a GeForce 6600 series or higher or Radeon 9600 series or higher video card. </s>
