the internet connection is via an agere win modem, internal pci.
so the mdem is always on at startup, and this problem can can occur from a startup or restart.
also, the connection is available through internet explorer and outlook express, and internet optoins can be configured for it through internet optoins, and it also appears in the taskmanager when connected.
but, it is not listed in network connections and connot be connected any other way when this happens.
all other network connections are still present in this event.
