and here's how i pick a psu.
i find a review on the card i want to fit then i look for where they measure the amount of watts it tops out at.
now if i want to have a stable machine for years (some can't do that and will settle for a 1 year lease) i will take the watts and divide by 6. why?
well we want to find the 50% mark for the +12v rail amperage so you could divide by 12 then multiply by 2 or just use 6. now off to find a suitable supply that has that or more amperes on the +12v rail and meets the watts the card calls out.
this is usually all it takes.
not hard at all?
seems to call it out at 255 watts so i see i want 42.5 amperes on the +12 rail to get a nice stable pc.
that's definitely in the 500+ watt range so at  i see the first 500+ watt psu with a single rail is this one.
it has 54 ampere rail and meets the other spec so all that would be left to to look for others and check the fit in the case.
