So, I created another partition on my computer with the basics and it works fine. Trying to access my disk drive and it comes up &quot;Access is denied&quot;Tried to restoring, but, that failed. Any suggestions, thanks?

Over in the Storage Forum at the top post are ways to get your files out. And a last chance. DO NOT PLUG IN ANY USB OR OTHER THING. Try safe mode again. And I know what your question. Can you fix Safe Mode boot failures? I can but on pre-installed Windows I can't since they remove all the tools to fix it. We get the files out safe then reinstall the OS. Bob
