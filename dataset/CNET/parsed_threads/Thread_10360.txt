<s> I am trying to connect my Creative Zen Vision M to my laptop, but it is not working. </s>
<s> I believe the problem may be with the USB ports, but I have tried everything I can think of to fix it. </s>
<s> The only other option I have left is to buy a powered USB hub. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> I am using a Dell Inspiron 8600 and Windows XP. </s>
<s> The USB ports are 2.0. </s>
<s> come with any software or drivers? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> I installed everything that was on the cd. </s>
<s> I have been thinking that the USB ports are underpowered, but I have changed some of their settings and still cannot get the device recognized. </s>
<s> I don't know if you are still having this problem, b/c your post is old, but I had the same problem with my Creative Zen Micro. </s>
<s> I don't think it is your USB ports - I had the problem on my Dell and then on my Toshieba Tecra - where I plug in my device but the Zen software does not see it - but Napster sees it. </s>
<s> With some (or perhaps all and I never noticed) USB drivers, you have to use the same port that you used when you installed the device. </s>
<s> But I think your problem is just a Creative problem. </s>
<s> I don't have the problem with other MP3 players that I have (iRiver) and I dont' have it with other USB devices I use on my laptop. </s>
