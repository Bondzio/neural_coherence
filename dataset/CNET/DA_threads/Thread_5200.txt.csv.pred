1.1.1	I just read this article and I really have to agree .	St
1.1.2	To me , Apple could be signaling the decline of the DVD drive by excluding it with the MacBook Air .	St
1.1.3	This is similar to the original iMac and floppy drives , although I think that the transition to internet-based services and/or other forms of storage while be more subtle than that .	St
1.1.4	The Air did n't bring out anything new ; other notebooks already excluded an optical drive .	St
1.1.5	But aside from burning a few videos , or watching them , most people may not need optical drives in their portables anymore .	St
1.1.6	For Macs , newer abilities like remote install can contribute to this .	St
1.1.7	Use a desktop computer as a base and share the optical drives over a network .	St
1.1.8	In theory , it all sounds great .	St
1.1.9	I can say that when I 'm out and about , I turn to a flash drive for external storage should I need to save some files , etc .	St
1.1.10	I hardly use my MacBook Pro 's disc drive unless I 'm importing audio files , or when I throw a movie in on a long trip .	St
1.1.11	With these thoughts in mind , the MacBook Air would be a great mobile machine , although a somewhat faster processor would be nice .	St
1.1.12	With Leopard , it would be good to have an upgrade path to 4GB of RAM and a 2.1 or 2.4Ghz CPU , now that Apple uses Penryn chips .	St
1.1.13	2.1 would suit it better .	St
1.1.14	Add in a removable battery and the Air would be just about & quot ; perfect & quot ; .	St
1.1.15	That new 256GB SSD would be good , but for now , conventional hard disks are more practical .	St
1.1.16	It 's pretty interesting to see where all of this technology is going , and how it has evolved already .	St
1.1.17	So I 'm wondering how Mac portables are going to change if the market follows a course similar to this .	St
1.1.18	Until Apple issues a complete overhaul of the MacBook and MacBook Pro designs , not much is going to happen anyway .	St
1.1.19	So , what do you think ?	Ques
1.1.20	-BMF	St
1.2.1	In practice it 's not been that great always .	St
1.2.2	I 've always found that it 's better to fish out the Superdrive ( which sucks in all sorts of ways , but we wo n't go there ) .	St
1.2.3	I like having a drive .	St
1.2.4	And on other genuine ultraportables ( not crippled lightweights like the Air ) I have the option without any penalty in terms of weight , runtime or even in many cases genuinely usable power .	St
1.3.1	That gives more reason to improve other components , but with things like the Air , you are trying to get a package that is too small for current technology .	St
1.3.2	And with that , you still make a lot of compromises .	St
1.3.3	Sure 1.6 or 1.8Ghz is pretty good for an ultraportable , but if you 're using Leopard , you may think otherwise .	St
1.3.4	This concept wo n't advance for awhile , unless Intel really does a good job with the new Atom CPUs .	St
1.3.5	Smaller processors will go a long way in ultraportables , no ?	Ques
1.3.6	-BMF	St
1.4.1	The concept wo n't advance for a while and until then , I will need a drive .	St
1.4.2	And it 's not that 1.6 or 1.8 is too slow for Leopard - it is n't , it 's just that the Air has poor cooling of its peripheral components which also affects the CPU 's ability to cool itself .	St
1.4.3	The shell itself does n't get anywhere near as hot as the Crudbooks / Pros , but like almost everything Apple I 've encountered since '06 , it is designers pushing the entire production process and not the engineers .	St
1.4.4	The result is that when I stack up my 1.33ULV Vista-based SSD notebooks against the Air , the Vista notebooks in many situations are faster ( yes , even with Glass on ) .	St
1.4.5	And that 's pathetic , since the Air has none of the versatility of the ULV machines - no docking station , no ports , no crucial wireless connectivity even , and even what 's built in - 802.11 / Bluetooth - sucks in comparison to comparable portables .	St
1.4.6	In case you 're not clear , nothing in the Air is too small for current technology .	St
1.4.7	It may be too small for Apple to accomplish without problems but that 's a different - and typically Apple - matter .	St
1.4.8	although the Air has been purpose-designed it is not an ultraportable in the vein of the Sony TZ or even the X300 .	St
1.4.9	It is more a Macbook that has been stripped of everything in order to make it supposedly compete with the likes of the Sony and Lenovo .	St
1.4.10	The Air may fit into an envelope but in reality it pushes no envelopes apart from that of marketing .	St
1.4.11	In terms of actual build quality - i.e .	St
1.4.12	how it stands up to everyday use , not just fit & finish - it is somewhat worthless unlike the X300 or the TZ for example .	St
1.4.13	Apple knows that a sexy skin will sell whatever crap they 've put inside to the majority of the Great Unwashed who do n't know better .	St
1.4.14	The only reason I still have it , as I might have mentioned before is that I would like to run OS X on something that I can actually carry .	St
1.4.15	However it is a monumentally rubbish - and I will also admit monumentally pretty - lightweight notebook .	St
1.5.1	in the sense that it is lightweight as you say .	St
1.5.2	It 's footprint is n't small , but you can carry it and stick in several places because of its & quot ; thick/thinness & quot ; .	St
1.5.3	It is & quot ; portable & quot ; and more so because it is easier to carry ; that 's the bottom line .	St
1.5.4	However , it is n't small .	St
1.5.5	It 's light , and that 's why it will never be a true replacement for the old 12-inch PowerBook .	St
1.5.6	Personally , I would go with the Air just because I can use the OS on it , but I still think I would get more out of the Lenovo X300 with all of its connectivity options .	St
1.5.7	It 's running Vista on a slower processor , it 's not as & quot ; shiny & quot ; , nor is it as thin .	St
1.5.8	But we all know that Thinkpad will get the job done .	St
1.5.9	I think that the Air concept is a good one , but its designated target is somewhat slim in comparison to other portables .	St
1.5.10	Honestly , for less money , I 'd go with a much more powerful MacBook .	St
1.5.11	The only sacrifices there are the cosmetic features and the weight , but really , you 're only giving up the ambient light sensor and aluminum enclosure .	St
1.5.12	The Air is pretty sweet .	St
1.5.13	Just picking one up and using at the store for a few minutes tells you that .	St
1.5.14	I like how it looks , but that 's not why I try it out .	St
1.5.15	The trackpad and its weight are far more interesting .	St
1.5.16	I watch the screen , and that 's about it .	St
1.5.17	Apple knows what it 's doing with the Air , but until they can get it up to speed , put in more storage and offer removable upgrades ( RAM , batteries ) , there 's no point .	St
1.5.18	Version 2 should be much better .	St
1.5.19	If Apple can bring the Air up to specs and performance comparable to the standard MacBook , then it 's just a matter of how much portability you want and how much you want to spend on it .	St
1.5.20	On a side note , I just got an AirPort Extreme card for me old iMac G4 , and I was more interested in looking at the new iMacs at the store than the Air .	St
1.5.21	Installing the card in the base of the computer was easy ; connecting to the network , not so much .	St
1.5.22	The area between the user-accessible RAM slot and AirPort slot in the base is made of plastic or something like it , so I tried to be careful , but I did n't plug the antenna cable in the card all the way .	St
1.5.23	Big mistake .	St
1.5.24	Course I opened it back up and got it running now .	St
1.5.25	Got ta love this lampshade .	St
1.5.26	What bothers me is that the software install disk for other AirPort utilities installs the now dysfunctional Internet Connect app ( which works in Tiger , but not in Leopard ) and some other AirPort utilities that I will never need .	St
1.5.27	Apple should make those disks more current ... whatever , I just threw the three apps in a folder in my Utilities section .	Sug
1.5.28	I got this thing working now and I do n't feel like deleting anything in case it something happens .	St
1.5.29	Too bad it is only WiFi b/g .	St
1.5.30	But it is plenty fast now .	St
1.5.31	I would much rather get another MBP over the Air .	St
1.5.32	1-inch thick is still amazing to me , and 2.5Ghz is whopping fast in a portable computer these days ...	St
1.5.33	I need my existing one to be looked at anyway .	St
1.5.34	Both the keyboard and aluminum exterior are n't quite perfect ( minor case separation and crooked keys ... ) .	St
1.5.35	But it 's solid and is what I expected out of a Mac , save those cosmetic problems .	St
1.5.36	The Air is all looks and weight I think .	St
1.5.37	Again , it wo n't be worth it till Version 2 or 3 , like the iPhone .	St
1.5.38	I see the 3G iPhone becoming a big seller .	St
1.5.39	Only a few more days till WWDC and then we 'll see .	St
1.5.40	-BMF	St
1.6.1	Are no less compromised , but obviously in different ways .	St
1.6.2	I have several Macbook Pros in both 15 & quot ; and 17 & quot ; sizes - in fact several Macbook Pros for every generation there has been of them - which have similar but not identical heat issues , and there 's the problem of durability and build quality .	St
1.6.3	I really am not used to my supposedly premium notebooks warping for example , and there are several other problems that they still seem not to have addressed fully with even the current incarnations .	St
1.6.4	I also have other premium mainstream-sized notebooks from other manufacturers once again kept current through the generations and there are very good reasons that I call the Apples Crudbook Pros .	St
1.6.5	For me , looking good is n't enough - it has to work right as well .	St
1.6.6	I 've also recently bought my first Macbook since a disastrous encounter with them back in '06 .	St
1.6.7	Better certainly , although with the litany of failures/defects the 06 Macbooks had I would not be surprised .	St
1.6.8	However an XPS M1330 is still so much better in various aspects .	St
1.7.1	for me anyways ... Sure it looks good , but it goes way beyond that .	St
1.7.2	The OS looks good too of course , but again , not my point .	St
1.7.3	My MBP has performed to and exceeded many of my expectations over the period of time that I have been fortunate enough to use one .	St
1.7.4	I must say , I could care less about heat issues ( I use it on a laptop stand to deal with that ) , the graphics and other hardware are superb , and overall it 's been great for me .	St
1.7.5	Now I ca n't say the same for everyone , but for the most part , Apple 's got a good thing going .	St
1.7.6	My only quarrel with Apple has been over build quality ( Ex : AirPort problems , case & quot ; warping & quot ; , etc . )	St
1.7.7	and afterwards , Apple just replaced the thing with a newer one .	St
1.7.8	That one now sits on me desk , and with its newer , though somewhat dated today , Santa Rosa technology , it 's much faster than its predecessor .	St
1.7.9	The only & quot ; problem & quot ; with this model is the build quality , and really , it 's not even very bad on this particular machine , so I 'm grateful for that .	St
1.7.10	But Macs are supposed to be & quot ; premium & quot ; machines , and I have AppleCare , so I expect this issue to be eradicated all together .	St
1.7.11	The keyboard keys should be looked at too , but the main issues lie in the screen bezel , the aluminum above the MagSafe charger port , and the area above the DVD drive .	St
1.7.12	That 's where it is separating , and it would seem that it only gets worse over time , just like my previous MBP .	St
1.7.13	Now that I have my iMac all fixed up and running , I actually have a reliable Mac to turn to while the other is in for repairs .	St
1.7.14	Now that I think about it , it would be a quick repair anyway , since this time around all of the internal components are working perfectly ( or so it would seem , LOL ) .	St
1.7.15	All they would need to do is put in a non-crooked keyboard , and replace the aluminum shells around that , the screen , and on the back of the screen to fix the issue .	St
1.7.16	Still , I think the MacBook Pro is one of the best notebooks out there .	St
1.7.17	Cosmetic issues do n't always affect the computer itself , and it works great as a computer , so I think that 's where it scores big .	St
1.7.18	-BMF	St
1.8.1	I go by machines not going wrong in the first place , or not having obvious faults , as a measure of quality and certainly what is 'best ' .	St
1.8.2	That the hardware is readily replaced by the manufacturer is not a measure of such to me , especially as it means downtime for any reason - diagnostics , visit to the Apple Store , etc .	St
1.8.3	I have spare machines but they are for emergencies ( and for the other non-Apple machines I have as spares , they are ) , and not for what seems like almost routine use ( in the case of Apple hardware ) .	St
1.8.4	I of course acknowledge that people who do nothing particularly critical or worthwhile on their computers might feel otherwise .	St
1.8.5	I suppose this is what Richard Dawkins feels like when he 's talking to a fundamentalist Christian ...	St
1.9.1	I of course acknowledge that people who do nothing particularly critical or worthwhile on their computers might feel otherwise .	St
1.9.2	I suppose this is what Richard Dawkins feels like when he 's talking to a fundamentalist Christian ...	St
1.10.1	I do n't come to argue or flame out at other forum members , and if you thought that was directed at me , be aware that I did not take it that way .	St
1.10.2	Also , I was merely discussing some points of the notebook market within the computer industry with fbbbb .	St
1.10.3	I do n't need to be put in my place , so to speak , and I was not & quot ; out-of-line & quot ; .	St
1.10.4	Do you think there was an actual argument here or a discussion ?	Ques
1.10.5	FYI , I do a lot of & quot ; critical & quot ; work on my Macs and which is why I can not last too long without them , which I believe I have mentioned before in some form or another .	St
1.10.6	To fbbbb : I have decided against bringing in the MacBook just because the problems are so minor and have no impact on the functionality of the machine whatsoever .	St
1.10.7	And correct me if I was wrong in my above response to the & quot ; not so & quot ; innocent_bystander .	St
1.10.8	You know , once I get some more RAM installed in the Macs , I 'll have them really screaming .	St
1.10.9	I 'm currently ordering a 4GB set and a 1GB stick for them .	St
1.10.10	Leopard will work very well with the memory boost .	St
1.10.11	Have you seen those rumors regarding OS 10.6 ?	Ques
1.10.12	No more PowerPC support ?	Ques
1.10.13	I like the idea just because I knew as soon as I saw the Leopard requirements that my G4 is on its last major OS upgrade .	St
1.10.14	With Intel-only support , the next iteration of the OS will work even better on the x86 architecture .	St
1.10.15	The only downside to this addresses the G5 users ...	St
1.10.16	Both those Dual and Quad Power Macs were extremely powerful , and are still useful for the most part .	St
1.10.17	They still fetch large prices when someone is selling them too .	St
1.10.18	Most of the newer Intel Macs can outperform them , but some people still rely on them .	St
1.10.19	They may see that Apple is trying to force them to buy a new Mac , but they should also know that this was coming ever since the transition was announced .	St
1.10.20	-BMF	St
1.11.1	But more a statement of fact .	St
1.12.1	and that 's how I called it .	St
1.12.2	My Mac is very important and I do a lot of work on it .	St
1.12.3	And it 's definitely worthwhile ... *Loads DVD and plugs in headphones .	St
1.12.4	* Lately I 've had a bunch of video work to work on , and only my MacBook Pro can handle it ; the G4 ca n't support iMovie '08 .	St
1.12.5	Once I get some more creative software , and after WWDC , more hardware perhaps , it 'll be even easier , and I can get some websites up and running too .	St
1.12.6	Hopefully we 'll see some Mac updates tomorrow .	St
1.12.7	I 've been eyeing a Mac Mini for a little while , but without a decent graphics chip , provided they do n't just throw in a real card , and yesterday 's processors , it 's a no go .	St
1.12.8	They 're a bit overpriced too , and to get a decent , upgraded model , you could just buy an iMac and have everything you need out-of-the-box .	St
1.12.9	I hope Steve has some good surprises tomorrow .	St
1.12.10	-BMF	St
