Why?
Less dropouts, less lag, more reliable.
And the time has passed where I used to skip USB sticks.
Why not something like I use?
Example at link.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037G2BMY/ It's about 10 bucks and on Windows 7 I don't have to find the drivers.
And even if it notes 54 megabit, the sticks I've received are N compatible.
