i just have a quick question.
does anyone know if these printers that say direct usb photo printing or pc-free photo printing will also print documents?
i've got no experience with this and can't confirm it either way.
i know the more expensive ones will print documents, but i am hoping to find a sub $200 multifunction printer that can print documents via a usb flash drive.
thank you!
