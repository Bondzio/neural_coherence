1.1.1	G'day , so I could really use some help if there 's anyone out there who has an idea .	St
1.1.2	I 've asked around but the jury is still out ... motherboard has been the suggested issue although this is a cheap computer so if I am to spend anymore money on it I would want to know it will fix the issue .	St
1.1.3	Motherboard : ASUS P5K-E Power Supply : Corsair CX430 ( new ) HDD : WD 500Gb ( new ) Graphics : HIS 6450 ( new ) Basically my computer will start up fine 1/300 times .	St
1.1.4	When it does work it works for a random period before freezing in a random screen , sometimes it works great , other times it seems to be running unusually slow .	St
1.1.5	In the other 299/300 times when i turn the computer on all it seems to do is power up .	St
1.1.6	It wo n't connect any monitor , keyboard , ext HDD etc .	St
1.1.7	Recently I have noticed that if I turn my computer off at the powerpoint , or leave it off for a long period I find it will power up for 5 secs until it thinks for the first time - and then it turns itself off for about 3 secs - and then it powers up again has a little think and thats about it - it 'll stay on in this state and just sit there - still not connecting any external stuff .	St
1.1.8	It has a brand new internal HDD , power supply and graphics card ... things people have previously suggested to be the issue .	St
1.1.9	The CMOS battery has been removed and then the computer powered up to the same effect , however a new battery has not been tried .	St
1.1.10	BIOS , drivers etc all up to date .	St
1.1.11	Cheers .	Polite
1.1.12	: )	St
1.2.1	Replace the dang battery , it will always be incorrect with the battery left out even with corrections will be lost upon the next power-ON .	St
1.2.2	The CMOS is a few $ and worth it , if the PC is 2yrs .	St
1.2.3	old or better .	St
1.2.4	Next , after new battery installed , edit the bios that reflects what is proper , review you manual or allow defaults to rule , provided they match what is required .	St
1.2.5	Your video may not be the most powerful , though it maybe taxing the PSU abit .	St
1.2.6	Your PSU is a 430W ?	Ques
1.2.7	If so , it maybe at the lower end of PC needs and offers a borderline operation of the PC .	St
1.2.8	Maybe after some time it finally is starting to falter or it 's & quot ; rail & quot ; is less than capable .	St
1.2.9	These ares of concern .	St
1.2.10	How much ram is installed and what OS ?	Ques
1.2.11	Last , it may need a bios update , see what level yours is at and what 's available .	St
1.2.12	That update may correct for some issues provided they explain them ( not always ) .	St
1.2.13	But , if you have an update that 's several levels above your current one , it maybe good to install .	St
1.2.14	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Replaced the battery today , no improvement .	St
1.3.2	- ca n't get into the bios as I have no visual .	St
1.3.3	The psu has only been installed recently and has been running for about 24hrs , would it start to fail after such a short period ?	Ques
1.3.4	I have 2Gb of ram and windows 7 running - although operating system does n't strike me as the issue seeing as majority of the problems happen before the OS loads .	St
1.3.5	Last time the computer was momentarily working I got a computer literate mate of mine to install all new bios and drivers and that was n't long ago .	St
1.3.6	Thanks , keep the suggestions coming .	St
