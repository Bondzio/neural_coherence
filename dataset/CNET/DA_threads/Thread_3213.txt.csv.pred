1.1.1	Hi , before I start asking questions , here is what I am currently working with : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 800 MHz PowerPC G4 ( Powermac4,5 ) -- -- no Airport or any wireless hardware installed OS : 10.4.5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- However , to make things more complicated , within the next month or so I will also be running a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop ( not exactly sure which model ) .	St
1.1.2	My problem is , I find it almost necessary to upgrade from my current Comcast Cable internet to Wi-Fi .	St
1.1.3	In the fall I will be going away to college and I 'll be going back and forth between campus ( which has Wi-Fi ) and my house .	St
1.1.4	I will be doing all of my work on my laptop since my PowerMac will be staying home with my family while I live on campus , so I need a convenient way to also work online here at home on my laptop .	St
1.1.5	But , I am completely clueless on how to .	St
1.1.6	I 've read the forums and seen a lot of talk about Airport .	St
1.1.7	Do I NEED to buy this ?	Ques
1.1.8	Ca n't I just be like everyone else ( *cough*windowsusers*cough* ) and go to Best Buy and buy a wireless router ?	Ques
1.1.9	( Such as http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp ? skuId=7061751 & type=product & productCategoryId=pcmcat25300050001 & id=1108125361676 ) My point is , I want to make this as easy as possible while still maintaining a decent connection between both computers .	St
1.1.10	I could probably just unhook my Mac from the cable modem and connect my laptop to it , but I do n't feel like doing that everyday , I do n't want to have to go through Comcast tech support and software installation , and I do n't want to be stuck in my home office with no work space .	St
1.1.11	Sorry if I confused anyone , but I really need help before I go out and purchase anything .	St
1.1.12	Any suggestions would be appreciated P.S .	Polite
1.1.13	: Whatever the solution may be , I need to be able to access the internet from at least 1 story above where I am now	St
1.2.1	Yes .	St
1.2.2	I am a bit confused of what do you really want to do with your network .	St
1.2.3	But if I understood it correctly you have a Mac laptop and you are also planning to buy a Lenovo .	St
1.2.4	There are wireless cards that both are compatible with a MAC computer and a computer running through Windows better look for those device .	St
1.2.5	I bet Linksys have one , and it have drives for both mac and windows .	St
1.3.1	802.11G is a standard .	St
1.3.2	IP is also a standard .	St
1.3.3	As long as the MAC and the thinkpad both support IP and 802.11G you should have no problems .	St
1.3.4	SKrall	St
1.4.1	Yes If what we assume is correct and all you want to do is access you modem from either the PC ( MAC ) or new Laptop ... go buy a router ... anything should work since 802.11 G is the standard .	St
1.4.2	Do you have to buy an Access Point for the MAC or is it wireless enable .	St
