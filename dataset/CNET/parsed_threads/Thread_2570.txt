<s> I have a Vista PC and have attached a samsung ML-1740 (USB) laser printer to it. </s>
<s> Vista found the device, and installed drivers for it. </s>
<s> It completed with no errors, and Vista says it is ready for use. </s>
<s> When I try and print to it, it fails to print with no real specific message. </s>
<s> Printing a test page from control panel, simply says &quot;Test page failed to print. </s>
<s> Would you like to view the troubleshooter for assistance&quot;. </s>
<s> I have deleted the printer, downloaded newest samsung drivers and installed again...still no go even though control panel says the printer is &quot;ready&quot;. </s>
<s> any suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I find many PCs with new installs missing drivers and more. </s>
<s> Taking a page from the HP printer fiascoes, the usual is we have a firewall installed or a non-administrator account. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick response. </s>
<s> After I submitted the original post, I tried installing an HP deskjet printer I had lying around. </s>
<s> In response to your question, no I never actually did have a local printer attached to USB. </s>
<s> So I installed the HP and it works perfectly. </s>
<s> I was surprised actually, cause I thought it was a USB issue. </s>
<s> The only thing that I can think of, is that I had this Samsung printer on my old XP laptop and this Vista PC was printing to it via workgroup sharing. </s>
<s> Maybe now that this same printer was moved locally, vista isn't seeing it as local...the only problem with this theory is the printer is detected and showing ready. </s>
<s> If I remove the usb cable it shows offline too. </s>
<s> So there is communications. </s>
<s> Also, I am running as administrator, and no firewalls in place. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Sorry for the prior typo. </s>
<s> As I read your reply it sounds like the old failed printer issue. </s>
<s> Or if a network the old permissions, accounts issues that I think is covered by the IT staff. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am sorry, I don't understand your response. </s>
<s> Who are the &quot;IT staff&quot; in this case? </s>
<s> Is there a posted document or something I can look up, on this forum? </s>
<s> I do believe you are on the right track with the old permissions or accounts ideas, but can you be more specific on where I could look? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Tony </s>
<s> just to clarify, the printer is not networked at all. </s>
<s> it is directly connected to the Vista PC via USB. </s>
<s> It WAS connected to an XP pc and networked and the Vista PC printed to it via network. </s>
<s> But now it is directly connected. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> It could be as simple as. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The port is bad. </s>
<s> On desktops, use the REAR PORTS first. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The USB cable is bad. </s>
<s> Try another. </s>
<s> I was under the impression that the network was in some office. </s>
<s> Offices must have an IT staff. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the cable is fine...as I had mentioned I got another HP printer working fine with both the same cable and the same port (and others as well). </s>
<s> The printer is good too....tested on another pc altogether. </s>
<s> I am sure it is a vista problem, and I have the latest drivers from samsung. </s>
<s> Vista on the support list. </s>
<s> Ouch. </s>
