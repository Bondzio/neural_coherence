I have to admit that I am to some extent accustomed to post here and chatter over trifles when I am free and spend a lot time with my gadgets. But there always comes some boring things, such as the low power of ipads and phones. And sometimes I found the usb connectors on my PC is not enough to support my work as convenient as possible. So I searched on Amazon and found a relatively suitable item maybe I can use to solve the trouble . http://www.amazon.com/product/dp/B00EHCY3AA/ But as I was used to buy peripherals from other sellers, I have no information about this. Could you guys tell me your experience on the products from this seller? Does this item worth being consider as a perfect one?Or some better choice?

If you're looking for convenience, you might find one of the car chargers more suitable. You plug them into the 12 V power outlet in your car, then plug your devices into the car charger to charge. ` Good luck.

As you say &quot;car charger&quot;, I do see it as a thing convenient for charge anytime. But I comparatively need some gadgets to charge at least two at the same time. So is there any kind of car charger with this function?
