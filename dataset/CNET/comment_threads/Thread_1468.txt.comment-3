I see many folk wanting to replace their laptops with these and learning an expensive lesson in the process.
If I were to gather up the current best tablets, I have a list but as it's personal, you pick the best for you.
iPad, Kindle Fire HD, Slate and the many other tablets means a lot of confusing choices for consumers.
