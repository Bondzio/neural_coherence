<s> System Information: ASUS M4A87TD Evo (Motherboard) AMD Phenom II x4 965 Black Edition (CPU) Radeon HD 4890 (Graphics Card) 8 GB Ripjaw Series (Memory) Prepare for an earful. </s>
<s> About 3 months ago my adventures with this computer started. </s>
<s> I had a couple of somewhat seasoned computer builders walking me through buying and putting together a computer. </s>
<s> I put it together and turned it on but the only reward I received for my effort were fans running. </s>
<s> I didn't get any picture on the screen nor any start-up/error beeps from my internal speaker. </s>
<s> I tried: with only one stick of memory, no memory (trying to bait some error beeps), no graphics card, everything unplugged aside from the CPU and motherboard, but to no avail. </s>
<s> I didn't have many extra computer parts lying around to test against it but I was able to test a different graphics card in my motherboard and there was still nothing appearing on the screen or any error beeps. </s>
<s> The graphics card went back to it's owner and he informed me it was still functional in his computer. </s>
<s> My friend and I then decided it was most likely the motherboard that was causing my issues and I RMA'd it to ASUS and had a new one shipped to me. </s>
<s> I got it back and I was faced with the same issues I had been with the last motherboard. </s>
<s> I tried all my old trouble shooting attempts and I still get nothing. </s>
<s> No beeps, nothing but fans. </s>
<s> I do not understand why if everything in the world was broken why I wouldn't be getting error beeps unless the speaker itself was broken. </s>
<s> A few extra notes about the computer: The monitor is a VGA and the graphics card is a DVI so I had to use an adapter between the two which of course it's possible that is the issue as well but it still doesn't explain my lack of beeps. </s>
<s> I have to use an adapter for the power cord going to my graphics card too. </s>
<s> That is about every piece of information I can give you about this computer. </s>
<s> If you have any tips for trouble shooting, or perhaps are a miracle worker and can revive it with voodoo dolls, any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I don't have access to any computer parts to test against it, not even the graphics card any more, so that isn't in my book of options right now. </s>
<s> If you know what the most likely culprit is and know what I should be replacing that would be useful knowledge as well. </s>
<s> Thank you for reading my long post and any information you have to give. </s>
<s> Okay I assemble Computers and I have had my share with hardware configuration problems . </s>
<s> When get my parts from the distributer , I check them . </s>
<s> I start in the following manner . </s>
<s> I install the processor on the motherboard with the heatsink . </s>
<s> Then put the memory in the slots . </s>
<s> Connect it to the monitor and Power Up . </s>
<s> If I get the MoBo logo and BIOS reading on the monitor I proceed further . </s>
<s> If not , I retrace my steps . </s>
<s> In your case , your Graphic card and MoBo came true ( seems to me ) . </s>
<s> Since you tested with both of your RAM sticks , it very unlikely that your both RAM sticks have gone bad at the same time . </s>
<s> It could be your processor , BUT , before your start ripping off your hardware to get to your CPU , I would STRONGLY suggest you to take a look at your Power Supply ( SMPS ) . </s>
<s> Make sure you are using one of a correct Wattage rating and of a reputable brand . </s>
<s> I have found cheap ones saying 650 Watt but they fail to even give 450 WAtt . </s>
<s> Looks to me as if you are having a &quot;Brown Out &quot; condition . </s>
<s> Hope this helps Sam </s>
<s> Following your suggestion, I think I will try buying a new power supply first. </s>
<s> It was given to me by a friend and it isn't new nor have I heard of the brand before so I suppose that could very likely be the issue. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input! </s>
<s> Since, you never got this system to run, then don't trust adapters. </s>
<s> if you can at least test those elsewhere. </s>
<s> I don't see why you need an adapter for the GPU power, most newer PSU have all the connectors needed, so either that's an old PSU or definitively lacking the right connector, I would get a newer more wattage PSU to begin with and not a cheap one either or one you tested or trust. </s>
<s> Sadly, newer mtrbds. </s>
<s> need to be bios updated to improve its overall use. </s>
<s> But, you never got there, so its not booting or at least beeping. </s>
<s> Provided you know the spkr. </s>
<s> or &quot;on-board&quot; spkr. </s>
<s> is working it should have beeped. </s>
<s> All you need to test on a simple level is the mtrbd. </s>
<s> by itself and PSU attached. </s>
<s> Short the ON/OFF connection pins and it should beep away or spin up and then down. </s>
<s> You can remove the bios chip itself if socketed and then beep or at least have the small LED glow. </s>
<s> Also, the fan can be the chassis or CPU fan by itself, no cpu, nothing, no ram, nothing. </s>
<s> What are the results? </s>
<s> If you still get no beeps or fan running, then return for money back no need to fight anymore to make it work. </s>
<s> Make darn sure any jumper or sting are proper if applicable on the mtrbd.. Use the CMOS clearing to return to system defaults and try again. </s>
<s> Having access to another PC as test bed would have helped, but since it never worked and clues are sparse, it gets to be more of guessing. </s>
<s> That's why you need to to test and verify this or that as complete new items aren't always compatible or more is needed. </s>
<s> I certainly get a new capable PSU at least for now. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Your post doesn't tell enough but there are a few clues here. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You might have recycled another power supply and it does not meet the needs of this CPU and board. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I see this has a 4 pin ATXV connection. </s>
<s> The symptoms are what happens with that is not plugged in. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Some boards come jumpered in clear cmos and won't start. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> One board had a typo in the book about the reset connection. </s>
<s> Long story short is the motherboard printing was correct. </s>
