hi guys, i recently got one very old configuration p4 machine.
it contains 512mb ram card, as checked by me.
the problem here is, in system properties it shows only &quot;96mb of ram&quot;.
i didn't find any configuration in bios(although i am weak at checking bios).
according to what i think, ram might be faulty or properly working.
if it is faulty the system wont boot.
but here, i am unable to understand the issue.
pleas guide.
regards, uv
