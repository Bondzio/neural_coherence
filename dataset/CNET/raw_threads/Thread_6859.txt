The vista system can see the xp computer but the xp computer cannot see the vista. The workgroup names are the same, and both computers can ping each other and all files and folders are set to shared. What is going on?

I have shared the C: drive on vista to save time, but do I need to share individual folders? The goal here is to be able to use the easy transfer option between the systems, but until the vista system is shared on the network easy transfer will not work. Any ideas?
