ted: i began work on these instructions: while u have ur am coffee awaiting my re-animation, u have the cd drive working.
put the cd for the dvd drivers in it.
when u close it - the autorun should give u a menu to install the drivers.
if the autorun doesnt run - u can click start/run and enter d: or whatever the cd drive is d:setup or d:install one of these should work.
if not then u will have to look at the file list on the cd to see which program to run.
umm ms messanger - u shud have an icon on the toolbar for ie that looks like two people.
click that and get signed on and enter my email and send me a hello.
i couldn't get any of them to work.
i tried each of them with a forward slash after the d: and that didn't work.
i opened the disc but got no help.
btw, can a member attach a file.
i'd like to show you what i see when i open the disc.
oh, and about the instant messenging from m$, tell me what to do and i'll get rite on it.
i'm better at that despite my stupidity here.
one other thing i found rather a bit alarming.
at some point, i try to open my browser, firefox, it shows up for a nano second and then internet explorer which i never use comes up with a box that says: did you notice the information bar.
it goes on to say that it lets me know each time ie blocks a popup.
actually, the bar at the bottom of the screen that begins with the start button disappears and the only way to restore it is to restart the computer.
what is that???????????????
