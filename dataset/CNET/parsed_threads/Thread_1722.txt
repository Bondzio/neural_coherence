<s> i recently got a Philips SPD3600CC 20x external usb dvd burner. </s>
<s> I enabled nero to show the ACTUAL burn speed instead of the selected burn speed. </s>
<s> the burner will get to 9.5x then it will start slowing down and stay at 7.9x. </s>
<s> I am using tdk 16x dvd-r media. </s>
<s> It takes about 7 minutes for the dvd to burn. </s>
<s> Is it just me or is this product defective? </s>
<s> Any input appreciated. </s>
<s> While the 20X advertising sounds good, all things need to be just right to get it. </s>
<s> You need to have NO other activity going on while you burn for one thing. </s>
<s> No web surfing or any game playing. </s>
<s> Some will say that anti-virus or other memory resident programs can interfere with the burn process also. </s>
<s> If you are real concerned with the burn speed, the only way to see if that is the case is to shut down other programs that may want any resouces. </s>
<s> Then try again. </s>
<s> If you were doing a video, how was it being done? </s>
<s> Were the files already on the harddrive and the write program just putting it on the DVD? </s>
<s> If it was data, then did the writing program have to do anything to the data before it could be written? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You took 7 minutes to burn. </s>
<s> So my calculation is... 120 / 7 = 17.14 times. </s>
<s> Seems like you actually hit the numbers. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Try to curb your posts to 1 or 2 forums and wait a day. </s>
<s> If no answer then try another. </s>
<s> Spamming the forums may be noticed. </s>
<s> This is when I am burning a data DVD from my hard drive to the burner. </s>
<s> no transcoding is being done before burn or anything, just straight to the disc </s>
<s> so, do you think this product is defective? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> so is this just a case of nero reporting the wrong speed? </s>
<s> if i get you right you are saying a 1x burn = 120minutes, correct </s>
<s> I defer to content you find out there. </s>
<s> I offered one explanation and hope you can do a little more reseach. </s>
<s> Try the wikipedia or google and share your findings. </s>

<s> just to let you know, forums are my last resort when looking for information as it is for a lot of people. </s>
<s> i am aware of google and wikipedia so quit insulting my intelligence. </s>
<s> perhaps people shouldn't answer questions if they dont know the answer, this could lead people in the wrong direction </s>
<s> Best of luck, hope my simple answer helped you understand it. </s>

<s> Ok....I finally found a post on the SPD3600 and I expected the same complaint that I have...but 17x??? </s>
<s> That's awesome compared to the 0.70x that I am currently getting from this dvd burner. </s>
<s> DMA is on, I have 2gig of ram and a Pentium M with 160ghz. </s>
<s> Nothing points to an obvious problem (it IS plugged into a USB 2.0 and has the latest firmware). </s>
<s> I've used CloneDVD, Nero, Alcohol, ShrinkDVD....you name it I've tried it. </s>
<s> Slowness comes on a direct backup of a dvd, burning from the hd, data backup, software backup, EVERYTHING! </s>
<s> It's pretty frustrating not even being able to burn at real time!! </s>
<s> 1x would be good for now! </s>
<s> Anyone have any advice? </s>
<s> Am I missing something obvious? </s>
<s> Anything would be great! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
<s> But I'd start a new post since yours is going on page 2 and won't be seen on the first page here. </s>
<s> Makes for too much scrolling. </s>
<s> As to full details you have some of them but not all. </s>
