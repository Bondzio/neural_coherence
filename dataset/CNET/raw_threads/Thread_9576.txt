I have been through the trouble shooter and did everything it told me to do, but it is still not working. It will print a test page, so there is nothing wrong with the printer. I would uninstall and reinstall it, but can't find where to do that. The printers don't come up in the add/remove hardware. Also when I click on &quot;Find Printers&quot; I get an error message (Directory Service is unavailable) I am not savvy enough to know what printer drivers to delete manually. Sigh.... I NEED my printer desperately.

If it's just from your PC it won't work, it could be a driver, faulty port (parallel usually). Give more details about how it's connected. I'm fairly certain these required an enhanced printer port setting in ones BIOS.

If you find it and can remove it (from control panel) try reinstalling the software from the CD. When you said test page, from where did you print the page? If you can run a test print from WORD PAD or NOTE PAD, the printer is functional, that is a very easy test to run. If not, back to square one.
