I have a Nokia cellphone powered by a li-ion battery.
What should I do to prolong the battery's life?
The sales person told me to charge the battery when it has only one bar left.
When I do my research on the internet, it was another story.
The website ( http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo-34.htm ) suggested that I charge the cell phone as often as I can.
Im looking for a third opinion.
Thanks
