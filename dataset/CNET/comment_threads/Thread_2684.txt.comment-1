Recently the DVD/CDRW drive on my Dell laptop went down.
To save money, I bought an internal DVD burner(Yamakawa DVR 7-08 8X DVD+/-RW (R888-1002 )) and a USB 2.0 Enclosurer.
I thought it should plug and play, but after I put everything together, the laptop(XP) did not recognize it as a DVD writer.
The windows explorer did add a label to the DVD driver as &quot;DVD-R&quot;, but after I insert a blank DVD+R disk, the label changed to &quot;CD drive&quot;.
I then tried the software(EZBurning) came with Dell, the software complained that it can not find any DVD writer divice.
Any help will be appreciated.
