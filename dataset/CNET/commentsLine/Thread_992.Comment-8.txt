sorry for the delay.
i got distracted by another answer.
i get a time-out also on  but it also tells me the ip-address that's being pinged: 69.46.230.66. and if i enter that in my browsers address bar i get to an advertisement site directnicparking.com.
however, if i type  i get to the ftc-site.
can you try that?
if it works, it might solve halve of your problem.
authorityresearch.com is 209.216.253.192. it pings ok, but this ip-address in the address bar leads to a general page of a company called plesk (presumably their hosting provider).
the first thing i would do to sort this out is find a laptop where you can view both these sites elsewhere.
then connect it to the same internet-connection (either wired or wireless) as this erroneous pc and see what happens.
if the same error occurs with this laptop at your place, and not elsewhere, it seems an error with your isp (or router).
if the laptop is ok with you, it's a problem in your pc.
you check the hosts file (but that's an unlikely cause) or run it without any internet security program.
the most likely way to solve it is to do a clean install of windows xp and start all over with your machine.
while you install additional software keep checking if things go wrong, and you might find out the cause.
but just as well, everything goes ok up to the end and the problem is solved forever.
be sure to make a system restore point to go back to if it re-appears.
