Yes, there is a sim card installed.
I have not attempted to remove it...not sure where it is.
I looked at it last night and didn't notice a spot for it, but I'm not the brightest bulb in the bunch.
It is a version 1 iPad and I have wireless and ATT for road trips.
It has always worked well.
I have not attempted a restore...how would I do that?
Thank you very much for replying...I really appreciate it.
