i acquired an older dell optiplex gx520 desktop version computer and decided to ramp it up a bit.
i put in a samsung ssd and started to upgrade the ram.
i put 4gb (2gbx2) but the computer started to freeze on boot-up.
i have windows 7 ultimate 64bit.
if i take out one ram and put in a different one 1gb total of 3gb, it starts up no problem.
i have just dealt with the 3gb.
now i wanted to upgrade the video card since the on-board graphics were crappy.
i put in an hix 5450 since it is the best pci only card out there (this motherboard doesn't have a pci express).
now i am encountering the same problem with this as the ram upgrade where it freezes on the windows start-up screen.
any help would be great.
