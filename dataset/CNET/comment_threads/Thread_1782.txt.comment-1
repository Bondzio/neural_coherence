Hey everyone, so I've been looking to purchase a new laptop for a while now, and have decided that a mac would be the best choice.
However, I'm having a problem deciding between the macbook or the macbook pro and what configurations would be best.
Aside from writing essays, spreadsheets and presentations, I'd primarily use my laptop for internet surfing and instant messaging.
I have a ton of music and photos and will be doing light photo editing.
I already have a 200gb external hard drive so I shouldn't be needing any extra space.
I also tend to run a lot of programs at the same time.
Which mac and which configuration makes most sense for me?
Thanks!
!
