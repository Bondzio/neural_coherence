<s> My friend bought an Asus A7n8x DX motherboard and built his computer. </s>
<s> It worked fine until he added this extra heat dissapating thing between the processor and heatsink. </s>
<s> Now it just turns on with a blank screen and 3 beeps. </s>
<s> He removed the heat dissapater and it still wouldnt boot, just the beeps. </s>
<s> He figured it was a Video ram error, so he tried using several different video cards to no avail. </s>
<s> The processor and everything else still works fine. </s>
<s> So he gave the motherboard to me. </s>
<s> I contacted Asus and they told me to 1. </s>
<s> Cut the power supply for your PC and make your PC case open ; 2. </s>
<s> Take out the Cmos battery 3. </s>
<s> Install your battery with &quot;reverse side&quot; that means turn the battery 180 degree and put in into battery socket 4. </s>
<s> Hold about 30 seconds then take out the battery and install it normally 5. </s>
<s> Power on . </s>
<s> Does this sound right? </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> If its a video ram error, why wouldnt a new video card fix that? </s>
<s> Follow ASUS's intructions, but why not just return defective material? </s>
<s> Look how people get upset over defective hardware at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6127-0.html?forumID=9&threadID=4805&start=0 This board is showing up at too many places. </s>
<s> I wouldn't bother with this model. </s>

<s> I am interested in knowing where else the board is showing up, given that I just ordered it as part of a &quot;bare bones&quot; system. </s>
<s> Several people had recommended it. </s>
<s> Thanks, Kamer </s>
<s> The issue changes on a monthly basis as vendor experience heavy returns. </s>
<s> That 6 month ago problem should be solved and you won't see the issue. </s>
