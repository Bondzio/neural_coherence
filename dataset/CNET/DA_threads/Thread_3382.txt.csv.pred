1.1.1	I am building a PC to mainly work with RAW image converters, photoshop and create DVD slideshows, so a bit of graphic work, but not really any 3D stuff.	St
1.1.2	Firstly, can someone suggest a decent motherboard with intel 775 socket and 1066Mhz FSB that would do the job.	St
1.1.3	Looking at around $150 US (&lt;$200 AUS would be good) Secondly, is there any need for a graphics card with the integrated graphics included with the motherboard and what is a good card to go for?	St
1.1.4	Cheers, Alex	St
1.2.1	Sorry I'm not there but if you want top CPU performance and not worried about 3D gaming even the lowest end video card (current models please) will do fine.	St
1.2.2	One of our best video editing machines (stable, fast, etc) had a 4MB video card.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	look for a motherboard based on the intel G33 or P35 chipsets.	St
1.3.2	the G33 has integrated graphics.	St
1.3.3	for your type of work, you don't need a discrete graphics card, but if you stick with integrated graphics you'll be limited to one monitor.	St
1.3.4	(dual monitors are great for the type of work you mentioned.)	St
1.3.5	so, i suggest you get an inexpensive graphics card based on either the nvidia geforce 8400gs or the ati radeon hd 2400pro.	St
1.3.6	motherboards, $90-$115 USD: GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3L MSI P35 Neo2-FR graphics, $40 USD: MSI NX8400GS-TD256EH GeForce 8400GS GIGABYTE GV-NX84G256HE GeForce 8400GS MSI RX2400PRO-TD256EH Radeon HD 2400PRO	St
