8398	0	33268	383539	NR	BeowulfKadmus	8/16/04 12:09 PM	1.09265814E12	Computer Issues :(	Specs A7N8X-E motherboard 512MB CMX3200 Corsair RAM Geforce4 TI 4200 AMD Athlon 2600+ Windows 2000 Pro I hope someone might be able to help me with this. About 4 days ago my computer froze twice, the third time I restarted it would not go pass the POST screen, the one that shows A7N8X-E Deluxe screen. I decided to clean out my computer with compressed air I had. I removed most components to clean them. After putting them back and turning up my computer now I couldn't see the screen or anything and there was no beep. I'm not sure if I damaged something or something else is to blame. I resetted my CMOS and still wasn't able to see anything on screen, the fan from my video card doesnt spin but works fine in this current computer. I don't know what else to try or to have one of the parts be replaced. Please if anyone can help me with this problem.
