1.1.1	I already know it makes it more accurate , but before I blow a hundred dollars on a mouse I want to know if it actually makes the game look smoother .	St
1.1.2	I just bought a new graphics card ( GTX 560 TI ) and could n't help but notice that it looks a little jumpy when I slide the mouse .	St
1.1.3	When I run or aim I can tell that the games actually running a lot smoother than when I turn .	St
1.1.4	It also looks a lot smoother with a controller .	St
1.1.5	So can somebody vouch that their games got smoother looking after buying a higher DPI mouse ... or is it just one of those things people like to brag about but it reality there 's no difference ?	Ques
1.2.1	It should .	St
1.2.2	A mouse uses & quot ; dpi rating & quot ; in that it transverses the display it also counts on dpi to makes it movements .	St
1.2.3	If not capable it will appear jerky or snappy , trying to catch-up .	St
1.2.4	Also , since you have a better video grade you raise the level as all that follows must also be capable and/or measure-up .	St
1.2.5	This is not normally a problem , but if you push the bounds , then expect it to push back because everything is suspect to an upgrade .	St
1.2.6	What makes a $ 100 mouse , now you know and it may not always appear that way .	St
1.2.7	At the same time , if the mouse needs extra attention it may suck some cpu cycles when you may need them for game play , then I 'm not a gamer .	St
1.2.8	Though , I fix many a gamer PC , only because they push them to the limits with a mix-match of PC parts , for what was the deal of the day purchase .	St
1.2.9	No downplay on gamers , but if you want the best from your PC , then install the best into your PC .	St
1.2.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Yeah , it looks like it does .	St
1.3.2	I borrowed a wired optical mouse from a friend that was less than 2000 dpi just to test things out .	St
1.3.3	Before I used a wireless mouse because I 'm using it on a TV and across the room .	St
1.3.4	It improved the performance about a thousand times .	St
1.3.5	I 've already ordered a Logitech G700 ( 5700 dpi ) and hopefully it wo n't fail me because it 's wireless as well ...	St
