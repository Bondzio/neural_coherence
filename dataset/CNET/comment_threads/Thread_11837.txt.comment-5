but I'm trying to work out how I can set permissions on my folders so only certain PC's can access certain folders, is this possible?
I have turned off simple sharing, and I can still access the folders from the PC I don't it to access.... i have been told that MAC address filtering can do what i say above, is it right?
and can u tell me how to make MAC address filtering?
and another alternative way is to use the Windows Firewall to block off the file and print sharing service except from the IP addresses of my machines, is it true?
and how can configure window firewall?
