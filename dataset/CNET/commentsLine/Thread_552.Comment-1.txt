i installed a wireless printserver with my epson printer which connects through my wireless router.
the print server has to be connected via the wireless router and the 10/100 connection.
the pc, wireless router and printer are all located upstairs in my office.
this works fine.
i can print from my wireless laptop downstairs to my printer upstairs.
my question is - can i connect another stand alone wireless printserver to my printer downstairs without connecting via the 10/100(which is upstairs)to access a wireless printer downstairs.
another words a stand alone printer server(802.11g) that will work with the downstairs printer?????
