I don't really need an upgrade but I need something able to run at the same speeds or better than that of the 480. I do game and do some rendering. The catch: I need it for 200 or less. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

From what I gathered there for 200 dollars a HD 7950 ( This coming from a NVIDIA fanboy ) is the best bang for my buck for what I'm doing.
