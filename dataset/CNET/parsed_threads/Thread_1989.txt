<s> My Gateway desktop has a slot on the front labeled &quot;cf/microdrive&quot; Is this slot a pcmcia or Type II connector? </s>
<s> Will a wireless card with a &quot;Type II laptop connector&quot; work in this slot? </s>
<s> Just add in the model number so members can research that if you can't determine such at Gateway.com BTW, my Belkin CF 802.11b wifi card had buggy Windows 2000/XP drivers. </s>
<s> They never issued a fix. </s>
<s> So while it worked, it was not a solution I'd share with the market. </s>

<s> Sorry, the PC is a Gateway GT-4010 Media Center PC (desktop) running Windows XP Media Center 2005 (Rollup 2). </s>
<s> The slot is a separate slot of the multi-format card reader. </s>
<s> http://support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/5891/5891sp3.shtml But given my Belkin CF card drivers were buggy I wouldn't count on it. </s>
<s> Why not use the usual USB WIFI device? </s>
