&quot;technically apple is the legal guardian of this closely protected property, six of the eight key patents issued for firewire technology cite michael d. jonas teener as the chief architect responsible for their advancements.
in fact, when teener left national semiconductor in 1986 to join apple computer, he had already begun early efforts on a low-cost technology to connect hard drives to one another.
teener became the founding chair and editor of the international standard (ieee-1394), a blueprint for the exchange of high-bandwidth digital audio.
he was also instrumental in recruiting ideas from other innovators and in expanding the ambitions of the multimedia technology to include video streaming.&quot; [edited] so, apple gets the money from the major patents and that guy has his name credited with the invention.
also interesting to discover that firwire was initially a system to connect hard drives together ... another case of microsoft really dropping the ball.
