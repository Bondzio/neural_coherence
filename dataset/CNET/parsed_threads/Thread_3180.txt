<s> or at least i think it has raid. </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/chipsets/mainstream-chipsets/p67-express-chipset.html notes this chipset used with Intel's RST does RAD (RAID!) </s>
<s> But I fear that if you didn't figure that out then you are not ready to do this. </s>
<s> I'd re-consider this feature. </s>
