which windows are you talking about?
windows xp and vista support 4 gigabytes of ram, minus any hardware devices that contain their own memory.
more expensive editions of windows server come in 32-bit edition but can use pae to access up to 64 gigabytes of memory.
i believe if a computer comes with 4 gigabytes of ram or more, it will almost certainly have 64-bit windows preinstalled.
or a 64-bit linux distro, which is my preferred option.
at least when you have 4 gigabytes of ram, you'll still be able to access a couple of hundred megs more than if you had 3 gigabytes...
