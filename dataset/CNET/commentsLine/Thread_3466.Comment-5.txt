using a kvm switch you can operate 2 computers using one keyboard,monitor, and mouse(...kvm).
however, i don't believe you can address both units at the same time( at least in my experience).
you use a hot key or manual switch to toggle between desktops.
if the two machines are networked,you can of course move files between them.
