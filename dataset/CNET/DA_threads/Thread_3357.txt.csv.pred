1.2.1	Since the Epson support website and gte the drivers for W2K usage .	St
1.2.2	This should resolve your problem if not W2K , try XP type only if no W2K drivers .	Sug
1.2.3	Post back with results .	St
1.2.4	If the driver is presnt and all goes OK , but it seems still yet have another problem , try resetting the bios to SPP from ECP mode but only after proper driver is installed .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Did a check and found no W2K drivers at Epson 's support website .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp ? BV_UseBVCookie=yes & oid=14388 & prodoid=8255 & infoType=Downloads & platform=Windows There are Windoze NT3.x and NT4 , you can try that to see if it works .	St
1.3.3	But , it appears the 800 model is too old and maybe considered only for win9x system .	St
1.3.4	Its time to move-on , unless someone posts a deeper resolution to your problem .	St
1.3.5	In many cases , no work around .	St
1.3.6	That model printer just is n't supported no more into newer OSes .	St
