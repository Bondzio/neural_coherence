I recently upgraded from an Intel Q6600 to a Q9400.
I reset the bios and originally the core clock started up at 2.66Ghz like its supposed to.
But all of a sudden when i check my temps and clock speeds, it says that its running at 2.0Ghz flat.
But when I go into my BIOS before my PC starts, it goes back to regular 2.66.
I just cant figure out why its underclocking itself.
Also, I know its not a heating problem, it runs at 42C Regularly after being on for a while.
Help me?!
