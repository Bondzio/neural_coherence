1.1.1	Recently i bought q8400 Quad Proceesor and Intel DG43GT Motherboard but its giving CPU fan Error in the startup.If i disable CPU fan warning from the BIOS then it doesnt give the Error .	St
1.1.2	Can anybody help me .	St
1.2.1	If this is the stock cpu fan that came with the cpu kit , then be sure to mount it correctly .	St
1.2.2	Then assure you 're using the proper cpu fan power connection on the mtrbd .	St
1.2.3	and set the bios for such , etc. , as required .	St
1.2.4	Now , verify if any temp setting that too is set to default ( for now ) .	St
1.2.5	Check all bios setting as these bios setting get spread out all over the menu when in bios , check it out anyways .	St
1.2.6	Save any changes , etc .	St
1.2.7	and save upon exit and check results .	St
1.2.8	If not a stock cpu fan , again be sure its mounted correctly .	St
1.2.9	Proper thermo paste , etc .	St
1.2.10	and fan what direction it blows , on or off the cpu .	St
1.2.11	Its important as best operation may dictate that but each vendor may follow their best situation .	St
1.2.12	Of course , the HSF setup is graded for your cpu installed .	St
1.2.13	It actually provides info that Q8400 is listed and not some quad-cpu rated , below that .	St
1.2.14	Take this advice , & quot ; do not take anything for granted & quot ; , check it and verify before damage can result .	St
1.2.15	Also , do n't disable the warning , once properly set it should become stable .	Sug

1.3.1	Are you using the stock Intel HS fan ?	Ques
1.3.2	And you 're sure the fan is connected to 'processor fan header ( 4-pin ) ' ?	Ques

1.4.1	Thanks for the advice , its a stock fan i removed and fixed several times but still i am getting the same warninig error , what should i do now.HELP	St
1.5.1	Since this is a stock fan , then it must be using the same wiring as its mtrbd .	St
1.5.2	connection , thus a 4-pin for 4-wire plug , etc..	St
1.5.3	If not , then that 's not correct .	Res
1.5.4	Also , because you 've mounted this several times , you may have defeated the thermo tape scheme of application ( you did remove the protective cover ? ) .	St
1.5.5	You can simply clean/remove the thermo tape application and use Arctic Silver in its place .	St
1.5.6	Last , you need a bios update as this mtrbd .	St
1.5.7	takes several different cpus , it could have been stocked too long and a bios update correct this glitch , but aware of what if any bios updates does .	St
1.5.8	You problem should be a simple fix or re-running the correct install .	St
1.5.9	Otherwise , it boils down to some outside error you have no knowledge of .	St
1.5.10	Its a manufacturing glitch , mis-wiring , bad cpu or bad mtrbd .	St
1.5.11	in some fashion or even possible weak PSU .	St
1.5.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Sometimes you get an error message if the fan RPM is below a certain ( user designated ) level or because the CPU is running above a default temp .	St
1.6.2	If checking and or changing the settings do n't help ... go direct to Intel for tech support .	St
1.6.3	Let us know the outcome .	St
1.6.4	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	First of all i will thanks to everybody for helping me , I have updated the BIOS of the motherboard and problem got solved but one advice i will give when i started updating bios the display gone blank for 10 mins and after that bios update process got started .	St
