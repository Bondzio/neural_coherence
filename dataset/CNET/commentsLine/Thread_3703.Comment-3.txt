what wifi speeds would you be referring to?
i think that a 80% decrease in download speeds should not be warranted, given i've seen wireless hit almost 30mbps on this laptop on other routers.
i'm not looking for 80-100 mbps, but something over 9 or 10 would be nice.
keep in mind this is an average over 24 hours.
there were times when it was as low as 4 or 5 mbps.
this is my only router at this moment, and if i send it to linksys i go dark for awhile.
this wouldn't be an issue, but me and the wife use the internet for work.
