RAM confusion	I have a Dell Inspiron 2650 previously running on 256MB of memory with two DIMMS 128MB each. After a while, I decided to upgrade my computer to 384MB by combining an old 128MB stick with a 256MB stick. Now a problem arised after about 5 months - my computer would not start. The power light would turn on, but the harddrive access light would not blink as it normally would. I called Dell Tech Support and informed me it must be the issue of combining different sizes of RAM. So, I got another 256MB stick to make a combination of 512MB. Yet again, the computer will start and then just lock up after about 30 or so minutes of usage. After shutting the computer down, my notebook will not boot back up again. I have to reinstall the RAM in order for my computer to boot up. I'd really would like to get the performance boost of 512MB, but something in my computer is not letting me. Please Help!!!

Even laptops need those clean and free from clogs. Here's some articles about this -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=HOW+TO+CLEAN+A+LAPTOP+HEATSINK%3F Bob

The computer simply locked up except much less than 30 minutes. One thing I noticed was that even though Windows was unresponsive - I was still able to change screen brightness by pressing FN and the up button. Does this mean that the motherboard is still functioning despite the crashing?

Your post is light about use of antivirus or antispyware or what browser you use. Here's an online scan. Share what it finds -&gt; http://www.ewido.net/en/onlinescan/ Bob

I believe you have been the only one to reply to my posts - and numerous times as well. I run Ad-Aware and Windows Defender for antispyware. For antivirus I use Norton Systemscan from the Google Pack. I will try to run Ubuntu as soon as possible and report back.

2055	7	256149	2539074	2539037	khicon	7/13/07 4:55 PM	1.1843457E12	Yes	As far as my knowledge goes, the RAM is correct for my notebook. PC2100S-25330-A0. Both my 128 and 256 pairs are made by Samsung.

After another one of my crashes, I inserted my Ubuntu live CD before forcing a shut down. The computer would not access the harddrive and the Dell splash screen announcing hit F2 to enter set up would not show up on the monitor. Although I did hear the CD drive beginning to spin, but eventually just stopped. When running Ubuntu without a prior crash, it will still freeze after a prolonged period. More Information: Only certain combinations of RAM make the computer crash. 256 & 256 - Crash 256 & 128 - Crash 256 - Stable 128 & 128 -Stable At this point, I'm completely perplexed as to what the problem could be. Would CNET users just recommend sticking with the 256 (total) combinations?

This really does not make sense as I have been running 128 and 128 for nearly 4 years. I was trying to think of all possible causes for this problem and came up with a power or driver related issue? I scanned my computer using DriverAgent and according to them, these drivers are out of date: Display adapter IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers 3Com 3C920 Integrated Fast Ethernet Controller (3C905C-TX Compatible) PCMCIA adapters Universal Serial Bus controllers As for the power issue, there are two power adapters for my computer (Inspiron 2650). One is rated at 3.5A and the other 4.5A in terms of output. Input is the same at 1.5A. So, any recommendations at this point?
