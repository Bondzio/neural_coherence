I lived in Vancouver BC for many years and that was another office where we would do on screen pre-press work then a test print off the current ink jets of the day then off to the print shop for a print that we would check before the final run.
Today there are many good shops and it pays to read as much as you can about prepress work.
Here's a tutorial that's less than a sip from the firehose.
