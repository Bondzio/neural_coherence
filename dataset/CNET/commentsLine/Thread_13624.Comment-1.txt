i have problem with my dell inspiron 9200 laptop.i couldn't start it and when i tried harder, pressing the power key a bit longer it started,but after few seconds i saw a smock comming from behind.i tried to start it with and without battery - no result.when i took it for repair they said me the problem most probably was in the moherboard (it is gone and it is no use to do something, too costly).
so i have to buy a new laptop.unfortunately a disk was left inside and i don't know how to take it out when the laptop is not switched on.please give me an advise how to do this.thank you in advance.
