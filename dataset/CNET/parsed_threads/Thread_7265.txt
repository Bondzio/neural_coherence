<s> OK, I recently brought a custom built PC (tower) on EBay with Vista installed and a new monitor separately. </s>
<s> Now Ive run into a problem. </s>
<s> When i first hooked it up, i plugged the cable from the Monitor, into the back of the PC too the Mother board. </s>
<s> When i turned the PC there was no image on the Monitor. </s>
<s> This i later found out, was due to the HIS X1650Pro iSilence Graphics card overriding the GC in the Mother board. </s>
<s> Now from what Ive been told, the HIS X1650Pro iSilence is made for Vista which is why the sockets in the back of it are different. </s>
<s> Thus i cannot connect the Monitor too the card itself, and have to go through the mother board instead. </s>
<s> Thus preventing me from using the card at all, because I have to take out the GC for me too get an image on my Monitor. </s>
<s> As well as that. </s>
<s> With the GC now not inserted, the disc drive will not open, so i cannot even get my Net up on my new PC because i need to do an installation. </s>
<s> So what i was wanting to know was. </s>
<s> Is the any adaptors out there that will let me plug the normal cord that comes off the monitor into the HIS X1650Pro iSilence Graphics Card? </s>
<s> This has been a real head-ache, and am hoping theres a solution to my problem. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> you have in the Hardware forum, and you already have two replys there. </s>
<s> Multiple posting is not a good idea and is highly discouraged. </s>
<s> You have two threads open, and that could get confusing. </s>
<s> Those responding in one thread would not know what had been said in the other. </s>
<s> This is counter-productive and can lead to duplication or oposing solutions. </s>
<s> Also, the responders often feed off of each others ideas, and therefore come up with a better solution than any one would have alone. </s>
<s> If anyone is contemplating a reply here, I suggest going th Coldplayer's post in the Hardware forum where a thread has been established. </s>
