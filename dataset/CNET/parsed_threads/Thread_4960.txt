<s> Hi, I'm interested in buying either the 19&quot; or 17&quot; LG LCD Monitor on page 17, of todays Best Buy circular. </s>
<s> Model #L1933TR-SF or L1733TR-SF. </s>
<s> Prices are $229 and $199 respectfully. </s>
<s> I cannot find a review of these monitors, and they don't seem to be listed on the LG web site. </s>
<s> Are they too old or too new to be listed? </s>
<s> Both monitors have the same specs(only the size differs). </s>
<s> I was once told that 19&quot;s are 'grainy' compared to 17&quot; models. </s>
<s> They both have the same screen resolution also(if that matters). </s>
<s> Any advice as to which one to get, or are they bad monitors. </s>
<s> Thanks, Tom. </s>
<s> While I could not find a review of either display, I did find product page for the 19&quot; model on their Canadian website... click here . </s>
<s> It is also primarily sold in Canadian stores, though Best Buy is debuting it here in the states. </s>
<s> The 17&quot; is from the same product line, so the information likely holds true for it as well. </s>
<s> Aside from that, I can tell you that they are both new models, with product pages being created about a month ago, and both have been certified to handle Windows Vista. </s>
<s> Thus, it may be a little while before full reviews and users opinions are available. </s>
<s> Overall LG tends to hover around a 6/10 when it comes to LCD monitors and televisions reviewed by the Cnet editors. </s>
<s> One thing you may consider doing is visiting a local Best buy or other electronics store and viewing it for yourself...the sales associates usually have display models they can plug in for you to look at. </s>
<s> I haven't noticed a drop in quality with 19&quot; LCDs, but if there is you'll be able to spot it before you buy. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>

<s> Hi, I am writing this note on L1933TR. </s>
<s> I bought it 2 days ago. </s>
<s> So far I like it. </s>
<s> No dead pixels. </s>
<s> Black color is really black!!! </s>
<s> LCD backlight is perfectly even. </s>
<s> After I adjusted color settings, colors are almost perfect. </s>
<s> No ghosting. </s>
<s> At the beginning I was not sure what to buy - L1933TR or L1900R. </s>
<s> However since I do not see difference between specifications and I do not like design of L1900R I decided to buy L1933TR. </s>
<s> And I have no regrets I will also repeat advice from previous reply - go to store and compare quality yourself. </s>
<s> (Only remember that default settings are not necessarily are the best...) Alex </s>
