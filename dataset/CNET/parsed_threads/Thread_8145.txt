<s> HI,I am looking to be pointed in the right direction for a great bang for the buck motherboard for gamers. </s>
<s> I don't have a ton of money to spend on it, around $200.00 neighborhood. </s>
<s> My main concern is that the board be future ready and reliable. </s>
<s> Also, whether I should go PCI express or stick with AGP. </s>
<s> The card I have in my current PC is a Radeon 9800 pro 128mb. </s>
<s> What I'm wondering is should I get an AGP board and cannibalize the old computer, thus saving money or bide my time and get the PCI express. </s>
<s> So confused, lol. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Is this a replacement motherboard for an existing system, or are you building from scratch? </s>
<s> If an upgrade, what CPU (and socket type), memory amount and type, video card model, etc. </s>
<s> do you already have. </s>
<s> The $200 is for just a motherboard, or for a motherboard and new PCI-Express X16 video card? </s>
<s> Gonna be building from scratch. </s>
<s> Have an Antec case SLK3700 BQE, for ATX or BTX, with 350w power supply. </s>
<s> Only parts I will be taking from my old system are a Radeon 9800 Pro 128mb, DVD Rom 16x drive, CD R/RW drive, and WD 80gb - 7200rpm HD. </s>
<s> Depending on whether I decide to get an AGP board, or PCI express board will make or break the Radeon. </s>
<s> The $200 is for the motherboard only. </s>
<s> My main sticking point is AGP or PCI express...do I go for AGP and what are my chances of being obsolete in the near future, or PCI express and build the system slowly, as I can only afford to build it a piece at a time? </s>
<s> Also will be installing new memory, not moving the old cards over. </s>
<s> Your biggest costs will be the new video card and a new processor...unless you're using the old one. </s>
<s> $200 won't hack it. </s>
<s> You'll spend at least that on the CPU. </s>
<s> $130 for the motherboard; $75 - $100 for memory. </s>
<s> A 350w PSU may work initially but you'll need to upgrade to at least 400w..with 450w preferred. </s>
<s> Oh yeh... if you computer came with Windows loaded you'll have to buy a new OS. </s>
<s> OEM supplied OSes won't activiate on the new motherboard. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
