<s> I am looking to add an external drive. </s>
<s> Is it best to or more cost effective to get an internal drive and enclosure set up or a designated external hdd? </s>
<s> I will need to add sata or usb 2.0 to the computer. </s>
<s> The more information I read the more confusing the issue becomes. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help. </s>

<s> If you know how to use a screwdriver you can make your own. </s>
<s> For most, a SATA connection is not viable. </s>
