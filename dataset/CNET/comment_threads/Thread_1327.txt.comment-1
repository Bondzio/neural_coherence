Hello all, I am having some trouble with my computer rebooting when the phone rings, the computer is a compaq with win98 I have changed out the modem and it still does it.
I am not on the internet when this happens and the phone line is in another jack in the other room.
The phone jack i have the computer on is in my room.
I only have one phone line???
I have not had a electrical problem or power surge.....Any Ideas is it win98?
or maybe the motherboard or maybe the actual phone cord??
HELP any advice is well taken.......
Thanks in advance Boomer
