isn't the &quot;cloud&quot; a server or servers somewhere?
is it different from kodakgallery where i have saved the thousands of old slides i scanned?
where are carbonite's servers?
it is not magic; they must be somewhere physical, and probably on the san andreas fault.
i do remember having two weeks of backup tapes at work and rotating one at home at first.
i just had to remember what week i was in.
