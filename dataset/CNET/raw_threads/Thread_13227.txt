I was thinking aboutthe Ati x800xl. But anyways, will I have a problem using this card? The card I believe calls for a 420 watt power supply. Does anyone know the power supply on the t6212 and if this would pose a problem?

I don't think the power supply has anything to do with it. Forget about what it &quot;calls for.&quot; Computers don't use nearly as much power as they claim. a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system. Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent...

SeaninWA in this theard installed a x899xl and didn't mention upgrading the PS: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=104179&messageID=1194079 Someone else in that thread, rickgut2004, installed a 450W power supply with his T6212. If you have problems, then of course increase the PS.

With no moving parts, unlike a harddisk, how much power would it really consume? I've heard of people using larger powersources, but only for these really weird servers with dozens of harddisk arrays connected to one machine. 300W comes standard. How much more do you need?
13978	5	108668	1238046	1237977	John Robie	6/11/05 3:50 PM	1.118505E12	Err....Dagger....	It depends on the power supply. Some are weak (low cost ones) even at 450W and can't supply a continuous amount to handle the additional stuff. When a factory puts out a computer they try to match the power supply for what they have installed at the time of delivery. So, if you start adding stuff like high end video cards and other things then that particular PS may not pass the muster.
