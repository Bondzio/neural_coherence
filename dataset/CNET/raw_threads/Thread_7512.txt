I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for good quality webcams at the above price points? I should say that my priorities are: (1) picture quality and ease of use (2) software (including in the box and connection) I have two girls (3 and 6) who do not see their grandparents nearly enough and I want them to be able to do so. However, I have seen some really poor video from some webcams and want to have as good a quality going out (the system has an AMD 3000+ XP, 512MB, XP Home) as I can get (for the grandparents to view), while having at least better than average coming in (all systems meet the minimum requirements adequate for the purpose, based on specs I have seen for most webcams). I haven't found any very recent threads on this, so I would appreciate your help. Some webcams I have looked at online include the Logitech Ultra and Fusion, the Creative Live! bunch, Microsoft's lifecams (found at BestBuy and others), and some other no-name/lesser brand webcams. I guess this brings up recommended ways to connect the computers. I guess the various IM clients and services, such as Skype, are the obvious choices. Any suggestions for the best/biggest picture? I'm willing to spend some money for a service, if it is worth it, but would prefer cheaper/free. Any help is greatly appreciated! Best regards, Scott

Is there another forum I should be posting this information request on? Too bad C|Net hasn't done a side-by-side comparison. The technology seems to be hitting a price-point, power, connection speed, and need (with all the military families separated for an extended period) &quot;sweet spot&quot; in which this type of connection is both practical/needed. Heck, *I'll* do a comparison if C|Net will pay for the webcams! Any help will be greatly appreciated! Regards, Scott
