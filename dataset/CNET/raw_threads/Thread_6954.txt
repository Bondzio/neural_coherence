2135	0	236600	2419497	NR	fonixzero	3/3/07 9:44 AM	1.17291504E12	My connection randomly stops receiving packets	I am on a Thinkpad running Windows 2000 and over the past several months, I've had a problem with randomly stopping receiving packets. It happens both through the wireless and cabled connections, and there is no specific activity that causes this to occur. The problem corrects itself and the machine starts receiving packets again after a period of time if I just let it sit. I can correct the problem manually by disconnecting and reconnecting the network connection. The problem usually happens after I've been using the connection for 5-10 minutes. I can still send packets, and the connection seems to be perfectly fine - I just can't receive anything. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Any suggestions? At this point, I have scanned for viruses and spyware and installed the latest crappy Microsoft updates but neither fixed the problem. I would really appreciate any help...

Another symptom: when I connect to a VPN, the problem automatically occurs. As soon as I disconnect from the VPN, I am able to receive packets again. It's a cable connection and I'm using an RCA DCM425 cable modem. The wireless router is a Netgear MR814, but as I mentioned before, this happens both on wireless and when I'm physically connected. Please let me know if there is any additional information that would be helpful. I really appreciate it.

Could it be some kind of DNS problem? I know I'm not very knowledgable about these things so I apologize if that is a silly question, but when the connection craps out, it seems like it sees the site (if I'm in a browser) but can't manage to resolve it. It's like it gets tired of doing stuff for me so it takes a break and then it's fine again.
