<s> I have a Western Digital 120 Hard Drive that I put into an external HD case. </s>
<s> Ive been using it for about 3 months. </s>
<s> Just last Wednesday I was in the Editing Lab at School and my Hard Drive, which I connect to a Mac via Firewire, would be recognized but it showed Zero files folders in it. </s>
<s> Earlier that day I was using it like usuall and it worked fine. </s>
<s> I Had about 33GB worth of files on it and now their all gone. </s>
<s> When i check the properties it says that there is still 33GB of space taken up, but there is anything there. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the problem is or how to fix it. </s>
<s> Im thinking of trying some Data Recovery software. </s>
<s> The Files on it are very important and I really need the get them back. </s>
<s> BTW the files system is MS-DOS and I used the HD for both a Mac and My pc laptop at home. </s>
<s> Thankyou. </s>
<s> Check this forum to discover that FAT32 on USB is not to be trusted. </s>
<s> Next time a NTFS for the PC, and native for the MAC. </s>
<s> Don't count on FAT32 volumes to stick around so never store anything you need to keep there. </s>
<s> Look at data recovery software such as Zero Assumption Recovery. </s>

<s> but since you say this is used on a PC as well, have a look at the discussion here; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=220931&messageID=2334934 Similar problems/solution? </s>
