I have bought a new dell computer w/out a wireless card, and am confused as if i should by an external wireless adapter or an internal one. I have asked several people and they seem to have different opinions on what is better (best buy rep, computer store rep, cable guy). What is your guys opinoin? And based on what you guys say, where are some places where i can get a good price on one...or is it just the basics...Best Buy, CompUSA etc. Id appreciate an answer, thanks.

I also still have all my USB ports free. I followed the directions exactly (install drivers from CD before inserting card) and it has worked flawlessly ever since. $30 after rebate at Officemax, and they did send me my check. Good Luck, Eric
