<s> i've left the computer on several times and two times my drive crashed, and or either froze up, now when i am finish i turn my computer off, thats why our operating systems have a turn off program and our hardware as well. </s>
<s> so, turn it off when your done. </s>
<s> as far as i understand (somebody correct me if i'm wrong) the computer needs restarts and shutdowns to &quot;cement&quot; in changes to the system over time. </s>
<s> resarts and shutdowns also clear up alot of wierd problems that occour, so i always reccomend that people shut down once in awhile just so they get in the habit of using that method as a first response to clear up problems. </s>
<s> (this = less headaches for novice users) ;o) </s>
<s> Do you leave your car running or shut it off? </s>
<s> The Worst thing that you can do to your car is Start it! </s>
<s> The worst thing you can do to a diesel engine, is start it. </s>
<s> So, do you leave it running? </s>
<s> Of course not. </s>
<s> How long do you want that hard drive to last? </s>
<s> Do you like the information you now have on that hard drive? </s>
<s> Of course you do. </s>
<s> Shut down when you are not using, it is just wise investment! </s>
<s> Also, shutting down alows your computer to reconfigure when it starts up. </s>
<s> Your computer is not human - it doesn't know whether 24 hours have past or 5 minutes have past by. </s>
<s> Sure the clock knows, but it doesn't tell the rest of the system this knowledge. </s>
<s> The computer is a machine, pure and simple! </s>
<s> The Macintosh computer was made to restart and shut down. </s>
<s> So is the PC. </s>
<s> Have you ever noticed the people who tell you to leave it on are also people who sell computer parts? </s>
<s> humm, wonder if there is any correlation there? </s>
<s> The way I've heard it put is, turning the computer on and off wears out the hard drive. </s>
<s> And keeping it on all the time wears out the hard drive. </s>
<s> So take your pick. </s>
<s> I turn mine off when I'm done. </s>
<s> It saves electricity. </s>
<s> My computers have always lasted for years. </s>
<s> So turn it off, but use the proper shutdown procedure to keep the system happy. </s>
