Only derails the conversation.
I hope you see why that would lead to discussions other than the issue.
My first thought is HMEON noted at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa386383 (VS.85).aspx The problem is real but what to do with folk that want to bash others?
That is, the HEMON may not fix it but lead to a clue why it is so.
If others want to bash a person for making a suggestion that could lead to another clue what's going on then what to do other than ignore that person?
What would you do?
I know this area only lightly but do write Windows apps so it gives me a little edge when looking into this.
If that's not good enough just say so and I'll delete my replies and unsubscribe.
