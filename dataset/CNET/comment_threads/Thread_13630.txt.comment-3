Athlon xp 2800+ doesn't mean 2.8 Ghz,.
That is misleading, it has to do with AMD benchmark testing.
Go to AMD.COM and look up your processor, it will tell you the actual speed of the processor.
Also Windows XP will correct the error in reporting in the processor speed and actually report the corect speed of the cpu.
