I'm on the IT staff at a large school district.
We have a huge number of iBooks that need to have their batteries recalled.
However, one of the instructions is to discharge all of the batteries.
With hundreds of these batteries to send back, it isn't practical to discharge them one by one.
Does anybody know of any battery discharging towers, or other methods to discharge large numbers of Li-Ion batteries?
