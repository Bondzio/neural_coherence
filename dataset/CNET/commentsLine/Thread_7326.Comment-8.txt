here's how i figure that out.
i get the watts off the old supply and if it's the usual under 500 we take that number then add double the watts the new card will draw.
reviews seem to write about 112 watts so we double that and add that to your current psu.
now find a psu with a single 12v rail unless you are adept at figuring out amperes.
