1.1.1	Hi, I am planning on building a gaming PC with Core i7.	St
1.1.2	I have build my system back in the days on Pentium4 but never with current generation processors.	St
1.1.3	I have a basic idea but nervous with some aspects.	St
1.1.4	1.	St
1.1.5	Does a core i7 (940 or 965 extreme) need an aftermarket giant cooler unless I overclock it?	St
1.1.6	2.	St
1.1.7	Do I need to apply a thermal paste for these processors or can it be safe without it as well?	St
1.1.8	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	to fill the microscopic gaps at the surfaces of the processor and the heat sink itself.	St
1.2.2	Some heat sinks come with a thermal pad that softens and flows when heat is first generated.	St
1.2.3	You don't add paste to these.	St
1.2.4	You either trust them to be adequate or remove them and apply your own thermal treatment.	St
1.3.1	especially if you're gaming.	St
1.3.2	And go for one that installs with something other than the standard Intel method ...sometimes they pop loose and you'll never know until your system starts overheating.	Sug
1.3.3	If you want to see the difference in HS Fan cooling ...including the Intel or AMD stock HS Fans...go to http:/www.Frostytech.com.	St
1.3.4	Last, if you go with an aftermarket cooler ...the question about thermal compound is mute.	St
1.3.5	Some come with pre-installed pads and others require you to apply thermal compound separately Let us know which direction you go.	St
1.3.6	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	http://www.frostytech.com VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	I keep reading about liquid cooling.	St
1.5.2	is it necessary for me?	St
1.5.3	I have no intensions of overclocking or atleast not serious overclocking.	St
1.6.1	for that matter.	St
1.6.2	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	that makes me breathe easy!	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	Can you guys help me which ones are the best AIR Cooled cases currently, again my config in mind is Core i7 940 or greater Dual or 3 way SLI GTX 285 I saw an Alienware cabinet and really liked it but it not sure how good it is.	St
1.9.2	Please let me know of something thats sexy and efficient for my setup	Sug
