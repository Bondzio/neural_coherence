All of them will require some sort of way to select which operating system to boot. With a single HD, you'll need to partition it into at least a seperate Server 2003 and a Windows XP partitions. I've used Acronis multiboot manager, is ok. It comes with the disk director suite, which will handle partitioning, too. I haven't done Server 2003, but in principle there's no reason it can't be the same re multibooting as any other OS.

Here is what i did I installed server 2003 32 bit first then installed xp x64 then vista x64. Tested all os systems and it all workd ok.
