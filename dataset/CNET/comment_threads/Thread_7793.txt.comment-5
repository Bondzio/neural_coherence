I haven't used an external drive as i am not having one.
I tried the windows backup and restored it on the virtual machine, but it didn't worked as all the files were not copied by the backup.
Then i manually copied all the files and tried it.
This one also doesn't worked.
When i executed the recovery application it gave error &quot;ACCESS TO FILE DENIED&quot;.
So i edited the permissions and restarted the application and this time it stopped responding.
