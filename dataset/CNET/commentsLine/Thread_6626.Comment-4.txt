the reason your documentation with the external hd did not cover subjects such as &quot;copy, replace, or restore&quot; is because the hd is not involved in the decision of which to do.
it does what it is told to do.
some application on your pc, either at your direction or by its own default, will make that decision.
typical pc copy/paste operations generally give you one opportunity to select replace, replace all, ignore, or ignore all.
if you choose either of the &quot;all&quot; functions, then all files that are on the drive and also being moved will be treated that way, otherwise, you will be given one opportunity per file, to select &quot;replace&quot; or &quot;ignore&quot;.
and, if you are moving lots of files, you will tire quickly of this option.
unix and derivatives like linux generally have utilities (rsync, e.g.)
that can automatically over-write only files that have since been updated, while leaving others untouched.
speeds up archiving dramatically.
however, although it seems likely there would be something similar for windows, i am not aware of it.
