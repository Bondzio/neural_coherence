1.2.1	The 2 page text email is about 60 characters per line of 50 lines , so that 's 3,000 bytes per page or 6K for 2 pages .	St
1.2.2	Now let 's bump that up to 10K to allow for overhead and make the calculation easy .	Sug
1.2.3	16 GB is 16,000,000,000 and 10K is 10,000 , so now we can just knock 4 zeros of that 16 GB and get 1,600,000 emails .	St

1.4.4	E.g .	St
1.4.5	with Windows Live Mail , you click the xxxxxx and click export email .	St
1.4.6	Point it at an empty folder and it 'll put all of them in that folder .	St
1.4.7	Each one is a separate file , but you can put them in a single zipped file and take advantage of compression at the same time .	St
