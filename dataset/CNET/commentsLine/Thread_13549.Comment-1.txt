hi, i have a win xp sp2 with 2 ethernet cards (1 with motherboard and 1 seperately installed).
i have 2 internet connections 256 kbps each connection hooked to the computer via ethernet cards (no router is used).
both connections are from 2 different isp - 1 having dynamic ip while the other having a static ip.
i would like to combine both the connections into 1 (512 kbps conenction -- not balance them) and the output connection should be using the static ip.
how can i go about doing this?
system config: amd 3000+ with 512 mb ram two 100/10 ethernet cards (1 inbuilt in motherboad while other is seperately installed) win xp sp2.
any help provided would be appreciated.
thank you
