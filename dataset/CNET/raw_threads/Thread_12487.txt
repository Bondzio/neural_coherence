If all of this is too much, wait for $ in order to be sure your have a decent PSU capable of handling any power demands. Not just enough but ample and capable. On top of it all, how is your cooling of PC handling all this? You have a 450W rated PSU. Your current video card is what AGP or PCI-x16, your mtrb. specs says??? again compare specs. If you like, try PCWizard 2012 provides details of your current PC make-up. BTW- Your picture is probably the best I've seen posted here where I can actually see w/o zooming in or losing details. a nod to ya tada -----Willy

That will xlate to about 215w. Your cpu and new gpu will want about 135w. That's tight........factor in misc and your headroom has gone to zip. Your mobo has a pcie x16 slot.......the new gpu should fit. Your call.

And dont worry i also using my old psu. I am also using the XFX Radeon HD 6670 1GB DDR5 card in my pc & my screen res. is as same as yours (1366x768). And I am very satisfied. I play most games mostly resent releases(Max Payne 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Serious Sam BFE, Fifa 12, AC Revolutions, Saints Row the third, Skyrim V, Crysis 2 etc. ) and it give me verry good results.
