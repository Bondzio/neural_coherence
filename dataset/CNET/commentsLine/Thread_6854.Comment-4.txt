i change the ssid to something like virusfarm then enable ssid broadcast and use wpa for the security.
no other settings are touched.
if the desktop still disconnects make it a warranty issue.
your post mentioned the wired connection fails so that's a truly bad sign.
i'd use a linux bootable cd to see if that works ok. the reason for the wifi setup is to shut down a possible issue there regarding mac address spoofing.
