I have to go into Task Manager on my Windows XP and find two processes (DLBAJSWX.EXE and DLBAPSWX.exe) and manually end the processes to free up the printer for the next project. Any idea what's up?

Yesterday, I got a message after putting new color cartridge in same printer, that referenced dlbapswx.exe. Did you ever find out what your problem was? In addition to error message,the cartridge is missing blue color. . Wondering if error message is a separate issue. I am relatively new at all this, but have a need to know... even if I don't understand the answers!! Any help would be appreciated

BTW I have a Lexmark X1150 and everything else(scanning...faxing etc) all still work fine just printing is acting up
