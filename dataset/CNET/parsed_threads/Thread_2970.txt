<s> I have a question about where i should buy parts. </s>
<s> I have some frys gift cards so ill buy the main stuff there, the spu, motherboard, harddrive. </s>
<s> But i wanna get the case and psu from somewhere else. </s>
<s> Whats a good site? </s>
<s> ive been given a link to xoxide.com and is that a good one? </s>
<s> Do a search here on newegg and you'll find some threads with other good places mentioned. </s>
<s> newegg sells about 90% of the cases Xoxide does and their usually cheaper i'd go newegg for everything (their definatly cheaper on their larger selection of PSU's) </s>
<s> I agree that newegg is a good site, but also worth a review is www.pricewatch.com It will list common items from many suppliers in price order. </s>
<s> You may find what you want at a cheaper price or on clearance. </s>
<s> Things like memory, drives, CD's video and sound cards are worth shopping especially if you know the specific ones you want. </s>

<s> shipping prices at sites from pricewatch. </s>
<s> Even Pricewatch warns users to be alert to lowball prices and then get burned by shipping [and handling] costs. </s>
<s> Also warranties from some of those places can be rather hiden. </s>
<s> Could not agree more. </s>
<s> Always buy with caution. </s>
