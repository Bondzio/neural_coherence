<s> Hi Everybody, Specs: computer model number: hp pavillion ze4610us OS: Win XP Home Edition Router: Linksys wireless-G 2.4 Ghz Model:WRT54G I purchased Linksys router in order to network my desktop PC and my laptop to be on the internet at the same time using my Dial up ISP. </s>
<s> I didn't realize that my router does not support the server for dial up connection. </s>
<s> Linksys Rep further told me that I still could network both computers at a local level but i wouldn't be able to use the dial up connection as a gateway. </s>
<s> He told me that I could do it through Win XP networking software but he was not allowed to tell me how seeing he works for Linksys etc. </s>
<s> Please help!. </s>
<s> I need to know if there is anything I need to purchase in order to network both computers together to run the same dial up connection? </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help in advance. </s>

<s> will be limited to that of a switch to provide a simple LAN connection between the two PCs. </s>
<s> The routers Gateway abilities need to be turned off and set to router functionality. </s>
<s> In addition DHCP and NAT addressing gets turned off as well. </s>
<s> You would then use the network connection wizard of XP Home on the PC that has the dialup connection. </s>
<s> Choosing to use this PC as a Gateway, Windows will use it's own Internet Sharing Program (ICS) to provide a shared Internet connection. </s>
<s> A broadband connection to the Internet provides a simpler and much faster connection. </s>
<s> If at all possible, this is the way to go. </s>
<s> support dial up, one of them is Apple Extreme base station (not apple express -&gt; this is an accesspoint only). </s>
<s> Have a look and get as many information you can get on how to configure etc. </s>
<s> better yet google it for such device. </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your replies. </s>
<s> The routers gateway abilities should be disabled in my network connections? </s>
<s> I know hardly anything about networking so I wanna make sure that I am doing the steps correctly. </s>
<s> I have been battling with this all weekend. </s>
<s> You said &quot; In addition, DHCP and NAT addressing gets turned off as well. </s>
<s> Does that automatically happen when I turn off the routers gateway? </s>
<s> OR do I have to manually turn that off myself. </s>
<s> I already ran XP home networking but I still dont see how it works, sorry for sounding so clueless but maybe I have the cables in the wrong places. </s>
<s> I dont want to be changing any settings if there is not need because the only problem being I just got it connected wrong. </s>
<s> I need more insight please. </s>
<s> Thank you so much for taking the time to help me. </s>

<s> I must ask again if broadband is in the works. </s>
<s> With high speed Internet this setup becomes almost automatic. </s>
<s> In any event, the settings I speak of are in the routers setup program. </s>
<s> You access that program by typing 192.168.1.1 in your web browsers address bar. </s>
<s> Once in, you type admin into the password box, hit enter and you ahould be in the routers setup page. </s>
<s> Referring to the manual on page 29 you will see the settings from Gateway to Router. </s>
<s> Page 23 shows where to disable DHCP and page 25 shows where Network Address Settings are disabled. </s>
<s> Don't forget to save your settings after each change. </s>
<s> Once this is done, your router should now be acting as a wireless access point with a built in switch. </s>
<s> You can run the Internet Connection wizard on the PC that has the dialup modem and configure it as the server of the dialup connection. </s>
<s> With any luck both PCs will be able to connect to the Internet when the PC hosting the dialup connection is active. </s>
