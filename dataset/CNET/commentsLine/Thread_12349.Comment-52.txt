i shall recomend linksys gear (this is my #1 option for my personal use and my customers,netgear is almost the same, but remember that linksys is the #1).
in the case that you already own a wireless adapter from netgear it doesnt matter since they are based on standards it shall work with all the routers, but if you are trying to take advantage of certain turbo 108 mbps technology you shall better buy the same series router from you wireless adapter.
i'll recommend you to try the wrt54gs (speedbooster)  it's built on a long tradition rock solid router with the enhancement of speedbooster, if you own the same wireless adapter with speedbooster it shall be faster (supposed too) but if not, at least you'll get longer range.
on security you can rest assure that it comes with a nice and secure spi firewall and you're network would protected, and the cherry is that it comes with a cd that makes it as easy as 1 2 3 wizard to setup the hole stuff.
just remember to choose the right wireless standard try this url .
