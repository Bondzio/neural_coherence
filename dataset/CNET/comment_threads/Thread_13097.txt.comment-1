I have a home entertainment system setup with a Toshiba HDTV as a second monitor.
It works fine, except that both monitors keep on resetting their resolutions upon boot-up.
Both monitors would normalized to their original resolutions if I launch Media Center (in full screen) and then close it.
I use a Norwood Micro 15.4&quot; LCD as my primary monitor set to 1024 x 768, and the Toshiba 62HM15A 62&quot; DLP Projection HDTV as my secondary monitor set to 1280 x 720.
Both are maximum settings.
The display is set-up to &quot;extend Windows desktop&quot; onto the Toshiba.
Any advice is greatly appreciated.
