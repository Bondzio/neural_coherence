or is that meant to be pc3200??
they are getting close to 4200 i know, but think that may not happen untill ddr2.
imho, if running an intel cpu use an intel chipset, but not an intel mobo.
intel mobo's offer nothing to help with overclocking or any other of the features that asus, abit, et al offer.
