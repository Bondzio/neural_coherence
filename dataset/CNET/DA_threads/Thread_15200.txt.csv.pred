1.2.1	If setting the network control panel to use only the LAN did n't take , just use the device manager to disable the modem .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	You indicated you used the wizard to configure your home network .	St
1.3.2	So I assume you set up the Internet Connection sharing and etc already .	St
1.3.3	Did you also go into your Internet Explorer & quot ; Options & quot ; and change your & quot ; Connection & quot ; settings on your & quot ; slave & quot ; machine ?	Ques
1.3.4	If not , go into your Internet & quot ; Properties & quot ; and under the & quot ; Connections & quot ; tab there should be some radio buttons .	St
1.3.5	Select the one that says & quot ; Never dial a connection. & quot ; This should disable the modem .	St
1.3.6	If your connection does not work after this , you may want to try to & quot ; Setup & quot ; your connection again .	St
1.3.7	And when you do this choose the option to use your LAN connection .	St
1.3.8	The wizard should walk you through it .	St
