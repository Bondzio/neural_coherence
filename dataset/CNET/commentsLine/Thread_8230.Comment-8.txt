thanks again steven.
everything there compares to my other machine, but i changed the settings around, but to no avail.
however, your post got me to thinking that maybe some other software is messing with things.
i am using &quot;xp smoker&quot;, so i am going to do an uninstall there and see what happens.
have a good one.
