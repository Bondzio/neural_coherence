While we know the Toughbooks (see google) have sunlight readable displays there is no market for the netbook version. Or rather will the market be big enough to support the sunlight readable Toughbook and a netbook version? I'm going with no. Bob

Most netbooks and consumer laptops have glossy displays, which are next to impossible to view outdoors. There are a few netbooks that do have matte displays, however. Namely the Samsung NC10 and the HP Mini 110. I haven't used either of them outdoors, though.

Imagine my surprise when walking through the PX (military everything-type store) here in Afghanistan and seeing it on display right after these posts. It came with an extended battery. I'm happy to have the extra battery life, but mixed on not being able to pack it without taking it off. But if that's the only downside, I'm sitting pretty. Thanks for all of the help. Chad

The HP Mini 110 is much easier to find in retail outlets, so at least you can see what it's like in person. The Samsung NC10 is much more difficult to find in retail brick-and-mortar stores, so you'd have to order one and have it shipped to you. BTW a fair number of netbooks have six-cell batteries that stick out in a rather inelegant manner, e.g. Dell, HP, Acer, and so forth. Although the extended battery life makes up for it, and then some. Be safe!

It's a little odd to hold, it can potentially be a handle. But I hesitate to pack it without taking the batter off. I'll look into an extra smaller battery, that way I can pack it away, and have a few extra hours in the bag.
