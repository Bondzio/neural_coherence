<s> Anyone have an idea of how or where to dispose of old printers with problems, fried cordless phones due to surge after power outage, hard drives, etc? </s>
<s> Did google search &quot;Recycling Electronic Equipment&quot; for my state, but not really satisfied with results. </s>
<s> HELP and thanks in advance. </s>
<s> In my city, once a year a big truck shows up to take monitors, printers and other gear like that. </s>
<s> Disposal is not free. </s>
<s> About 5 bucks for a monitor, less for other things. </s>

<s> You might try a place computer shop that specializes in used and trade in stuff. </s>
<s> These places do such things as strip cases and sell parts or even the cases themselves. </s>
<s> There is a lot of stuff they cannot use but can sell to reclaimation outfits and stuff so they even make a little money from that. </s>
<s> I do some volunteer work at a school where my wife is the technology coodinator and computer teacher. </s>
<s> I have taken some of her old stuff there including a few monitors and they haven't charged a dime yet. </s>
