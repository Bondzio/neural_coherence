hello everybody, this is my first reply here in cnet forums, and i was just interested in the poll.
i preffer to build my own computer, i select the cabin, the motherboard, and such hardware items, as well as sources and stuff, they are customized to my needs.
for me, and i think that for many too, the best thing to do is to build your own computer, if you know what you're doing of course.
thanks for reading!
