The actual recording time should be about the same with your CPU and some 2+ GHz CPU.
What will change is the ENCODING time.
It's very linear to CPU power.
If you had a twice as fast CPU, it would take 1/2 as long.
Any under 1,000 buck desktop will do this much faster but none (at that price) will break it down in less than say, one hour.
