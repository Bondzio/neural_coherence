You don't need to &quot;download the Netgear to your laptop&quot; nor do you need to run the router's setup CD on your computer (if that's what you meant). Your laptop probably has built in wireless. If you make sure this is enabled (usually a switch on side of case) and go into the networking part of Windows you should find that it has detected yor Mum's wireless router and will show which type of security is in use (WEP, WPA). If your mum has activated wireless security in the router you will need to apply the passphrase she used on the router to your own computer's networking interface. See if she has the manual for the router or download a copy from the manufacturer's site because you may need to know how to modify the router's security measures (using her computer).
