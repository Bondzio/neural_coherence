...is when you computer has run out of System RAM and has started using you Hard Drive space for the same task.
Low Virtual Memory warings often indicates your Hard Drive is virtually full, and may appear only when you're using programs like M$ Word and games, which use a huge amount of System RAM / Virtual Memory.
1.
Double click &quot;My Computer&quot; icon on your desktop 2.
Right click Drive C: 3. choose &quot;Properties&quot; (it's at the bottom of the list) 4.
In the General tab (running along the top) click the &quot;Disk Cleanup&quot; button 5. put a Checkmark in all the boxes and click &quot;OK&quot; You can do that on all your drives too, to recover wasted space.
Modern games can easily take a couple of Gigabytes of Hard Drive storage space each, and the system files such as Pagefile, and Virtual Memory are another couple each too.
You didn't detail (anything) but this can easily use up a lot of hard drive space, and then you'll get Virtual memory errors!
Good luck, GeeBee.
