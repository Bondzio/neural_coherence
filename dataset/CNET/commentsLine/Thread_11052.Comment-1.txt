hi all, im near to the end of my a+ course and also research alot about hardware engineering on the web, being quite confident about it and fixing pcs for family and friends to get practical experience, i decided to upgrade my own pc and came to a prob i just cannot sus.
current pc make up: operating system microsoft windows xp home edition os service pack service pack 2 directx 4.09.00.0904 (directx 9.0c) motherboard cpu type via c3, 800 mhz (6 x 133) motherboard name epox ep-3vwm motherboard chipset via vt8601a apollo ple133 system memory 631 mb (sdram) display onboard graphics via tech vt8361/vt8601 graphics controller 8 mb 3d accelerator trident cyberblade-i7 monitor hansol 720e [17'' crt] (0000000000) storage ide controller via bus master ide controller floppy drive floppy disk drive disk drive maxtor 6e040l0 (40 gb, 7200 rpm, ultra-ata/133) optical drive hl-dt-st cd-rw gce-8520b optical drive lite-on dvdrw ldw-851s upgrading to: mercury atx pt800 mainboard pentium 4 - 3ghz radeon 128mb agp x8 card same os same optical drives same hard drive i installed the above by the book and powered up for the first time and had no display on the monitor and no post beeps, everything else appears to have powered up ok. at first i thought, does the new graphic card need configuring through the bios setup utility?
but cant do that if i have no display on monitor after spending a lot of time on this problem with no avail i just reinstalled my old pc.
i could hear the hdd spinning but im not sure if it would load windows xp because its configured to my other mainboard, im not sure if you can take a hdd with os on it to another pc and the os would load as the chipsets are different between boards, as for the graphic card, its a ati radeon 9250 128mb agp x8 with tv out, my old set up has 285w psu and i knew that it wouldnt be enough for the new mainboard etc so i bought a sumvision ky-500atx 400w psu.
i have refitted the new set up about 4 times now without avail, i been looking up other forums and speaking to certified engineers (soon be certified myself) some of them say that the board itself may be at fault so replace it, but i aint got the dosh to go out and buy another one, why should i replace it when the board was bought new in september and i have stuck to all the guidelines regarding electro-statics etc, it should be ok. any ideas why i had the above problems?
advice appreciated cos im sick of working with a 800mhz cpu.............. thanks marc
