there are hardware and software compatibility issues with larger hd's, so you need to: - tell us the make & model of your computer.
- tell us what operating system you are using (example: windows xp with sp2).
* * * * * 1. if your computer has only usb 1.1 ports, install a pci usb 2.0 card.
2. you can keep your os on the 80gb drive and just install the 250gb hd as a secondary drive.
if you want to move everything to the new hd, the hd maker (seagate, western digital, hitachi, maxtor, etc.)
provides a free utility to transfer the image of everything on the 80gb model to the new hd.
note that the utility from a particular maker usually only works if you have one of their hd's installed.
