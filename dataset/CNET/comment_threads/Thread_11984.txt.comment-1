I have a Canon Pixma mp780 all in one, and the scanner is stuck at one end and will not move.
When i try to scan or copy all I hear is loud clicking from the cables that move the scanner, and a message that says &quot;scanner error.&quot; The cable that is hooked to the scanner seems to be plugged in-I took off the right side of the printer where the motherboard is.
I need this to fax and scan docs, so any help would be much appreciated.
