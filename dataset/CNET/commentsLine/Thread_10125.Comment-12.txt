you are right, moving your tower from the floor is the best thing you can do, but about the cooling thing, ok computers are made to support that type of stuff, if you have a computer and it comes with a fan, thats all you need, you dont need to put extra fans or bags of ice on-top of it to funtion properly.
i leave my computer on 27/7/265.25 and never had a problem, i have 2 hard drives-not a problem, an extra 5 2.usbs-not a problem, a better ethernet card-not a problem.
