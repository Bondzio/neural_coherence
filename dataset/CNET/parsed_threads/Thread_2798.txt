<s> I have an older Micron PC mellenia computer. </s>
<s> It has a 751Mhz AMD Duron CPU. </s>
<s> I know that I can upgrade it to a 1000Mhz AMD Thunderbird, cause I asked them a while ago, and I can find one that is not too expensive. </s>
<s> My question is, How hard is this to do? </s>
<s> Is this basically a hardware operation, or is it very complicated? </s>
<s> I wouldn't bother to do it, but some of the programs I want to run could use the little bit of extra speed Thanx kzolady </s>
<s> You generally need to just remove the old heatsink/fan and then the CPU by disengaging a lever device. </s>
<s> The processor lifts out easily. </s>
<s> The new processor will have notched end to tell you how it's oriented. </s>
<s> You insert it and relock the lever. </s>
<s> Then you need to install the heatsink/fan using an application of thermal grease. </s>
<s> Generally the BIOS will properly configure the CPU timing but not always. </s>
<s> Some older boards used jumpers that had to be moved around. </s>
<s> You would need a manual or jumper diagram specific to the MB to figure this out. </s>
<s> Now, the performance increase you will get from a 1ghz CPU compared to yours now is not going to be much. </s>
<s> I have to wonder how much RAM you have and if that might be a better way to go....or do additionally. </s>
<s> If you know your mtrbd. </s>
<s> can support an upgrade cpu, then besides the physical replacement, is the settings. </s>
<s> In older systems, that required resetting &quot;jumpers&quot; and usually your system manual or possible inside case decal -OR- upon the mtrbd. </s>
<s> silk-screened on provided the required info. </s>
<s> If none, then check at the support website for a d/l'able manual and check that. </s>
<s> If you're real lucky the system will &quot;autoset&quot; the required setting or you manually reset via the bios rather than any jumpers. </s>
<s> Once set, the system sees the new cpu and acknowledges it at proper setting. </s>
<s> This will al be seen upon boot-up on the initial dispaly. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The Athlon 1GHz is a pop-it-in job. </s>
<s> The BIG deal is if you have added a second hard disk and what else, the power supply may be nearing its limit. </s>
<s> The Athlon 1GHz will add to the load. </s>
<s> But there are no jumpers to change. </s>
<s> You want the 10 time 100 FSB model since it runs at the FSB speed. </s>
<s> Please don't ask what FSB when we have google.com. </s>
<s> You'll need a new heatsink and cpu fan. </s>
<s> If you don't, the new CPU will be toast. </s>
<s> -&gt; It will do a little better but the big boost for our Micron Millenia was a better video card. </s>
<s> The Nvidia Vanta is a dog compared to the fx5700le we put in. </s>
<s> That upgrade is less work and pays off well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have added a 256? </s>
<s> stick of sdram and a ATI all in wonder 7500 card, but not a new hard drive ( I usually remove all the programs etc. </s>
<s> that I don't use, most of my drive empty). </s>
<s> You lost me after (You want the 10 time 100 FSB model since it runs at the FSB speed. </s>
<s> Please don't ask what FSB when we have google.com. </s>
<s> You'll need a new heatsink and cpu fan. </s>
<s> If you don't, the new CPU will be toast.) </s>
<s> Sorry I don't understand what the 10 times 100 FSB Model means, and what heatsink and cpu fan I need. </s>
<s> I don't know what a heatsink is either. </s>
<s> Sorry Thanx </s>
<s> If you don't know what a heatsink is, and didn't try yahoo.com or google.com to see what it was, PLEASE DON'T UPGRADE this box. </s>
<s> Give yourself time to learn more. </s>
