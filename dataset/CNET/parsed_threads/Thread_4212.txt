<s> Hi there, I have recently bought a Dell Axim 50v pocket pc and I have a desktop running Windows XP with boradband connection. </s>
<s> Both of them got WiFi adapters. </s>
<s> But i do not have any router. </s>
<s> Is it possible to share my internet connection with my Pocket PC (thru my desktop) without installing a wifi router? </s>
<s> Like Ad-hoc networking or something? </s>

<s> Please note that I only offer this link and no support for it. </s>
<s> I've learned it best to ... get a router. </s>
<s> But some want to try it without. </s>
<s> To me, such setups are a tarpit of support. </s>
<s> I refuse to travel into said tarpit. </s>
<s> Best of luck with your adventure, Bob </s>
