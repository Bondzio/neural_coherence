<s> Hello folks, I have been researching SuperDrives for my Jan 2008 A1181 Dual Core. </s>
<s> There seem to be 3 main compatable models; GSAS10N, UJ-857C, and UJ-867A. </s>
<s> I know they must be capped at 8xDVD and I want Dual layer ability. </s>
<s> The UJ867A by Panasonic seems to fit what I want. </s>
<s> Here are my 2 ?s. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Is the Panasonic 867A (Nov 2010) 9.5mm the best choice? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> SATA or PATA? </s>
<s> I know SATA is a bit faster but is that what's in there already? </s>
<s> The 2010 new Super i am looking at is PATA, is the current Optical a SATA? </s>
<s> And should I just try to find a SATA UJ-857C in good shape? </s>
<s> I know somewhere someone has already asked smthg similar but by page 20 and the CNet search yielded no answers. </s>
<s> Thank You for any help! </s>
<s> and be assured that you have the right optical drive for your machine. </s>
<s> SATA or PATA depends entirely on what is already in there. </s>

<s> I have been there. </s>
<s> I have watched about 6 videos and 30 sites including Amazon and EBay to view over 300 different drives dating from mid '07 to current. </s>
<s> There are 3 (so far) types that claim to be OEM replacement Supers for the already installed Optical. </s>
<s> Some claim the replacement is SATA and Some claim PATA all for the exact model I have. </s>
<s> Removing the current drive and looking at what's in there is an option but the SATAs and PATAs both claim to offer the adapting cable to utilize the other format. </s>
<s> I have been building and configuring computers for 22 years. </s>
<s> From the old Pizza box desktops to UU19 racks and this is the craziest thing I've ever run accross. </s>
<s> It's a A1181, Feb 2008, MB402LL/A, MacBook 4.1, Dual Core 2.1, currently running Snow Leopard. </s>
<s> How hard should this be? </s>
<s> All three types listed in my first post claim to be OEM. </s>
<s> This is a crapshoot. </s>
<s> If i can't get specific info to buy the drive (ranging from $25 to $200) I'm just going to throw a dart and see where it lands. </s>
<s> Thanks for the response so far, I do appreciate it. </s>
<s> I'm just frustrated. </s>

<s> Same version, the 10N, as a new EIDE on Amazon for $50 from Panasonic which claims to be OEM brand. </s>
<s> There are 3 model types and two connectivity standards for the exact same model. </s>
<s> I understand OEM can be several different companies due to supply chain issues. </s>
<s> It's the 2 connectivity standards that claim to be original for the exact same model I question. </s>
<s> Any thanks, I know Mercury. </s>
<s> They are quality. </s>
<s> Just twice the price. </s>
<s> Thanks, cheers! </s>
