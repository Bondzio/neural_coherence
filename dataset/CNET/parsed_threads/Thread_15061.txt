<s> I have a pretty good computer right now but I feel that there are some problem spots that need to be looked at. </s>
<s> Specs: ATI 4870hd Intel e6750 2.66Ghz 4mb cashe G.Skill 8g's ram western digital hd's asus p5k-se 600w powersupply I have about 250 dollars to spend right now and I was really looking to upgrade my e6750 because it might be bottlenecking my graphics card. </s>
<s> What im having problems with is what to do with that money. </s>
<s> From what I know most games dont have quad-core support but with technology idk how long that will last. </s>
<s> So my question is what should I do with that money?? </s>
<s> Stick with a good dual core like a e8500 or go to a quad core. </s>
<s> (Im going to have to stick to my LGA 775 socket) </s>
<s> one). </s>
<s> That way you would have a high performance peripheral to carry forward to a new system when the time arises...there's not much gain or future in getting another socket 775. </s>

<s> If that was the case what should I get for a graphics card then. </s>
<s> I was leaning towards nvidea because of the performance in games and ive had problems with my ATI. </s>
<s> Have you been able to overcome the problems ? </s>

<s> Ati just has never been good for me in general its more of a preference to use nvidea. </s>
<s> Ive had many nvidea card and they all functioned perfectly for me. </s>
<s> The 4870 was my first ATI and its just missing something that I like from nvidea. </s>
<s> Ive been looking at the gtx 200 series but I really dont know what the prices will look like in a few months with the 300 series coming out </s>
<s> or the ones from AMD/ATI ? </s>
<s> Another thought . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> skip the L775 CPU and use the $$ for a socket 1366 or 1156 MB which gives you a platform for more CPU power and the option to use Crossfire or SLi plus USB 3.0 and SATA 3. </s>
