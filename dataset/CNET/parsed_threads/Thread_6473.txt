<s> Hi there, recently the video in my computer started freezing. </s>
<s> I did a factory reset and it didn't help the issue either. </s>
<s> It normally gets to the windows loading screen, then goes black after. </s>
<s> I got it to start installing windows but it froze during that too. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if its just video or the whole computer it self. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> You write more. </s>
<s> At least the make, model, age, what Windows and the story. </s>
<s> I got it in 2008, so about 4 years old. </s>
<s> eMachines, has Vista. </s>
<s> It started after a windows update, and now even after a system recovery it still does it. </s>
<s> Happened about three weeks ago. </s>
<s> Video just freezes after the loading bar for windows, or shortly after login. </s>
<s> Its rare to get to login. </s>
<s> Watch and do this -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html </s>
