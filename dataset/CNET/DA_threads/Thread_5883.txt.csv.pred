1.1.1	hi , i 've just encountered this problem with a computer - specs - Asus P5GC-MX , 3.2Ghz P4 775 , 512MB RAM ( x2 ) , 80GB HDD SATA ( x2 ) , 400w X-tec PSU .	St
1.1.2	i switch on this computer , it runs for about 15mins then the monitor displays it 's going to sleep .	St
1.1.3	but the comp continues running , lights are lit , fans are spinning ... im running it WITHOUT hdd 's & dvd-rw connected .	St
1.1.4	i was able to access the bios during that length of time and i noticed temp starts at 30C/86F ... rises to 50C/122F , and then the monitor shuts off .	St
1.1.5	could this be caused by overheating ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	i added more heatsink cream , but the problem still persists .	St
1.1.7	also i can not reset or switch off the comp at the power button ; i have to switch off using the power supply switch .	St
1.1.8	i have encountered overheating before but not with the monitor going off .	St
1.1.9	all help is highly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.10	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Adding more heatsink compound is not a fix .	St
1.2.2	The required amount is need , meaning just a & quot ; dab & quot ; smeared on and spread about , DO N'T over do this .	St
1.2.3	Got to Artic Silver support website for proper application even if not that brand .	St
1.2.4	Next , you should check your OS power management setup , review that and correct or reset .	Sug
1.2.5	You may need to use only that for any power setups , refrain from any true h/w setting if so applicable .	St
1.2.6	If the h/w has a some physical setting , leave those at default or none/no action .	St
1.2.7	Since , you no OS was mentioned , google for your required power mgt .	St
1.2.8	area to review .	St
1.2.9	ie : win7 , click start- & gt ; control panel- & gt ; system & security- & gt ; power options You may need to play with this , but I suggest set to & quot ; none & quot ; or clear all and leave at default , then reboot and check results .	St
1.2.10	If the problem returns at 15min .	St
1.2.11	again , check for any device settings .	St
1.2.12	As for temps rising , that maybe a momently thing as you can observe before it sleeps , as the fans kick-off then the system .	St
1.2.13	You can also clear the bios to help return to defaults , but check the setting needed , like SATA , etc .	St
1.2.14	then save before exiting ( just recheck ) .	St
1.2.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the help and advice , Willy .	St
1.3.2	OK , i took the pc to a computer specialist ... just to confirm .	St
1.3.3	It is the mobo that 's giving problems .	St
1.3.4	it 's the one playing up ... probably a chip or track or something on the board is burnt or damaged .	St
1.3.5	so the best thing to do now is buy a new m/b .	St
1.3.6	So this case is officially closed .	St
1.3.7	anyone else who faces the same problem can learn a thing or two from this thread ... cheers !	St
