are past the point of needing to FDISK.
The Naxtor floppy did essentially the same thing.
You need a boot floppy that includes the option to boot with CD_ROM support.
You can make such a boot floppy using anyone's computer that has Win 98 [or 98 SE] on it.
Simply go to My Computer, Control Panel, Add/Remove programs.
Click the startup disk tab and follow instructions.
Watch the floppy light because MS never bothers to tell when the floppy is complete.
Then on your computer use the floppy to boot and when the option is offered select boot with CD-ROM support.
Don't be surprised if Win 98 doesn't work well on such an old and limited machine.
