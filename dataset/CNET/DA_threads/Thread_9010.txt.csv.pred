1.1.1	Is there any way to clean the heads on a floppy drive ?	Ques

1.2.1	are available for floppy drives in several forms and from several firms such as : http : //www.cir.com/pc/clndisx/clndisx.htm http : //www.interconnect-solutions.com/40411-3k53.html or even this one which also has CD cleaner : http : //www.staples.com/Catalog/Browse/Sku.asp ? PageType=1 & Sku=493806 The last one makes the most sense as if the floppy problem is alignment rather than dirty heads you would still have something of value for keeping your CD drive clean .	St
1.2.2	The cleaning diskettes were much more common back when the drives were much more expensive .	St
1.3.1	I use a Q-Tip taped to a popsicle stick .	St
1.3.2	Dip the Q-Tip in Isopropal Alcohol and insert the Q-Tip between the read heads and gently scrub in a back and forth motion .	St
1.3.3	While you are in a cleaning mode , spray a shot of WD-40 on the two micro switches on the lower right and left of the insert slot .	St
1.3.4	This degunks the plastic fingers of the micro switches that tells your machine what type of media 720/1.44 ( right switch looking in ) , and if it is write protected ( left switch ) .	St
1.4.1	Thanks , N !	St
1.4.2	I 've already replaced the drive .	St
1.4.3	$ 9 for a new Sony ( cheaper than a cleaning disk ) .	St
1.4.4	I 'll definitely use your method from now on to keep this drive clean .	St
