1.1.2	I ca n't print anything off of the Internet .	St
1.1.3	I can print normal email and documents that I 've saved .	St
1.1.4	I tried to print airline confirmation that came with my email message , and all I got was blank pages that rolled through the printer .	St
1.1.5	I just attempted to print some movie theater info off the Internet , and the same thing happened .	St
1.1.6	I ca n't find any information in my Epson booklet about this kind of problem .	St
1.1.7	I just downloaded a new driver , but that did n't help .	St
1.1.8	Can someone please help me ?	Ques
1.2.1	Turns out the problem is n't my printer , it 's my browser .	St
1.2.2	Printer works fine with Internet Explorer but not with Firefox .	St
1.2.3	Is there a forum for browsers ?	Ques
1.3.1	Check the Firefox setting and enable/disable what maybe interfering .	St
1.3.2	You can also look into any & quot ; add-ons & quot ; if you use them as well .	St
1.3.3	If definitely the browser , then delete it and reload it again , but save your favorites for later return .	St
1.3.4	If you like try a & quot ; restore point & quot ; to to a date before the problem .	St
1.3.5	If that works and later it does n't , then some update maybe at work here .	St
1.3.6	I exclude any system issues .	St
1.3.7	FYI- I have Firefox and it works printing whatever I deem necessary .	St
1.3.8	This is going to be one of those problems that someone reports on and us Firefox users point to a fix or you have something unique to you .	St
1.3.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Thank you , Willy .	St
1.4.2	It 's definitely the browser , so I think I 'll uninstall it and try again .	St
1.5.1	After reading all the comments everywhere on the net , uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling , nothing worked .	St
1.5.2	( Like you , it worked on IE ) .	St
1.5.3	Apparently the cause was a MS update .	St
1.5.4	I just right-clicked the printer in the printers and devices folder and removed the printer ( with the printer off ) .	St
1.5.5	Then I turned the printer on .	St
1.5.6	The drivers were automatically installed and voila !	St
1.5.7	Everything worked .	St
