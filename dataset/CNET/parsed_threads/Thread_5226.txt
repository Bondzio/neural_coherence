<s> Hi there, Just wondering if someone can help me please. </s>

<s> Failing that, select your printer and press the Apple Key (Next to spacebar) and the letter I [+] </s>
<s> I believe that's done it. </s>
<s> As I had originally used it Windows I was expected a separate program but hey if it works, it works. </s>
<s> Thanks Hayden </s>
<s> is yours an intel based Mac. </s>
<s> I have loaded the driver and gone through epson's troubleshooting and I cannnot even get it to print. </s>
<s> Funnily enough it did for a while show the ink levels. </s>
<s> My system is Mac OS X with software version 10.6.5. </s>
<s> The machine is standard and there are no additions except for a Bamboo tablet. </s>
