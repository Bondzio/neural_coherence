Hi- I'm running a 2006 HP with XP.
I bought my daughter a game for it called zoo tycoon- the ultimate.
It installs alright, but then claims I need a graphics card.
It's not 3-D or anything fancy.
What kind of card do I need?
The ones at Best Buy are $100 and up.
Can I get something cheaper?
Also, how do I install it?
Any help is so appreciated!
!
