I actually never replaced the original power supply in the GT5032.
Have had no issues with it even under a load.
I have had no problems at all with the BFG 7800 GT OC card out of the box.
When I put in the card I didn't notice the manufacturer's requirements for a 400 watt power supply, but have experienced no issues at all with the stock Gateway 300w PS.
I am using the integrated sound card and I do not use the TV tuner card at all.
Like I said I have had great luck with this system/card set-up.
