<s> Hello everyone, I have a DELL Optiplex GX270 and it's only a few years old. </s>
<s> I recently started getting problems with the Monitor, USB mouse and USB keyboard shutting off after a normal boot up. </s>
<s> It's not always consistant with boot up. </s>
<s> Sometimes it will happen when running a program. </s>
<s> The power light is still on and fan is running when it occurs leaving me to believe it's power supply. </s>
<s> I also replaced the motherboard 3V lithium battery after I got the system voltage battery low warning.I did have the machine on a surge protector and into the wall electrical outlet, hoping that would fix my issue. </s>
<s> I still have the same result. </s>
<s> Please advise if I should replace my power supply or motherboard next. </s>
<s> Or both. </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance Symbolize </s>
<s> Sounds like it may be a problem with the connection between your battery and the laptop. </s>
<s> If the connector to the battery is on the motherboard then yes motherboard should be changed but definitely sounds like a bad connection somewhere. </s>
<s> try to change the power supply with sum1 elses and c if its workin.If not then surely u need to change the motherboard or call a technician. </s>
