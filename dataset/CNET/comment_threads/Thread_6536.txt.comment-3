printed circuit and soldered through holes that would be used for installing an AGP socket??
An expert micro miniature soldering person could solder it in, however the firs thing would be to deteremine if there is actually the proper artwork connected to the solder spots.
Twould take a little deft work with a DVM, and a likely schematic/wiring daigram.
