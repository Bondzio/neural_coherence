<s> This happened before but somehow it actually fixed itself, (how? </s>
<s> i dont know) but now its actually lasting longer than it previously has. </s>
<s> OK, so i turn on my computer and everthing looks as though its going smoothly, then while it is 'Detecting IDE Drives' it takes a little longer than it usually does, then after that, this comes up: 'Primary Master: None Primary Slave: None Secondary Master: Toshiba DVD ROM SD-M1502 1008 Secondary Slave: _NEC NR-7700A' Then it pops up saying 'Verifying DMI Pool Data....Update Success Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM: Failure... </s>
<s> Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM: Failure... </s>
<s> Disk Boot Failure, Insert System Disc...' Recently I installed windows XP, though im pretty sure this has nothing to do with the problem, any info you need i dont mind on telling you. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Either the bios is flaky or the mtrbd. </s>
<s> itself. </s>
<s> I find this happens every now and then and really nothing seems to correct it. </s>
<s> If it happens often enough maybe I could pin-point but usually not. </s>
<s> I make sure the bios is the newest and installed, all cabling is proper or swap out with others. </s>
<s> Reseat any movable chips, etc. </s>
<s> and inspect for contacts on the rear of mtrbd. </s>
<s> that the mounts aren't shorting, usually no matter what it seems to work at least for the time being. </s>
<s> A reboot seems to correct the problem or at least a warm reboot does. </s>
<s> If it happens usually from a cold boot(1st time) it maybe a cold solder joint. </s>
<s> Considering the problems it may cause, I install a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> and proceed on. </s>
<s> The same mtrbd. </s>
<s> installed in another case and the problem doesn't come back, go figure. </s>
<s> Sometimes cleaning the ram slots with alcohol helps or the cable connectors on mtrbd. </s>
<s> Sorry, I've seen this too often, other than above no fix. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> If set to AUTO the system goes through the detection process each boot. </s>
<s> In the BIOS, try to detect each of the drives [no time limit in this detection] and enter those parameters in the BIOS rather than using AUTO. </s>
<s> See if that helps. </s>
<s> Probably use LBA on the right side of the entry. </s>
<s> Some time ago, I thought that I had read a post on on to extend thje toime that the boot allows to detect the drive before bowing out, but can't remember where. </s>
