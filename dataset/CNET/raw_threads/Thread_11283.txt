So it really really depends on which internet site you're looking at .. ergo the reason I asked....what site are you looking at ? Assuming you want an internal hard disk drive ..here's what you should expect to see... http://www.supergooddeal.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ST3320620A&Click=17583
