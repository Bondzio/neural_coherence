In your other thread my colleague Grif suggested loading drivers from another CD.
And you mentioned something about using a Dell disc to load the OS to an HP CD.
So you should mention much more detail on what exactly you did.
Maybe better start a new thread in Computer Help, because clearly this is - as you already stated yourself - a new problem.
