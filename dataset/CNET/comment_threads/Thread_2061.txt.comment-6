best to read the details about the mobos available before you select one.
PC 2700 would now be near the low end, but Most will still support that.
Gives you great headroom to go to more and faster memory later.
I will not make any comment about speed improvements, because I am not a gamer.
This is being typed on a over 6 year old PII 333 with a 66 MHz bus [long before Intel started at 100 MHz to call it the Front Side Bus] LOL].
I never defrag because I tried it once and saw zero improvement in speed after defragging.
[so why wear out the Hard drives LOL] The larger cache and the much faster FSB will certainly give much improvement.
[note that FSB is not specified when the MCH is located on the chip with the rest of the CPU].
The socket 939 will support Dual Channel memory for future considerations, although it doesn't give very much speed improvement [maybe 5 % at best].
