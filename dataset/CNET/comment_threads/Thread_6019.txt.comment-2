I have tried USB and it works good but sticks out the back quite a bit and I only have USB 1.1 so I prefer the pcmcia card for better speed.
I prefer Netgear and if that is the router you have I would match it but not necessary.
I use a D-link router and a Netgear Pcmcia card and they work fine together.
The D-link Pcmcia card I got in my combo kit had driver issues and did not perform well for me.
This is only my opinion so check around.
Good Luck
