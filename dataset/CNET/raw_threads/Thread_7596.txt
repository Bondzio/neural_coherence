7947	0	289154	2737609	NR	bob.ferris	3/25/08 10:02 AM	1.20643932E12	RAID Reconfiguration	I currently have 2 Seagate 500GB SATA II HDDs in a RAID 0 array with 128k stripe. The RAID controller is an Intel Matrix Storage Manager. First question, is that a software implementation? Second, I would like to buy 2-10k raptors and put them into a RAID o for perforance, image the Seagates to a 5th &quot;working drive&quot;, copy that image to the raptors setup in a RAID 0, clean everything but the OS and apps, and then use the Seagates in a RAID 1 array (mirror) for pictures, mp3s, etc. Is this possible? Do I need a hardware controller to do it? Any suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

I can't count how many think it is but when I delete a file from one, it's gone on the second drive too. Also I've see the primary drive corrupt and find the mirror is corrupt as well. A dead end for most in my view. Bob

And then to automatically fix them?

Of course accidental deletions or copying of corrupt data is a pure loss but I've had &quot;hiccups&quot; on one drive in a set that were recoverable and have lost a drive in a set that allowed the other to run ok until I could replace it's dead mate. Another time I had a bad power connector that caused one drive to spin down intermittently causing a data mismatch which was recoverable by booting to the hardware rebuild utility. It took a doggone long time...overnight in fact...for the rebuild...but it did survive. I'd agree it's not a sole basket to keep your eggs in, however as I have lost other data due to human error.
