both!
you can't really choose between ram and a good gfx card for excellent gaming experience.
both of those two work together to deliver great graphics.
for example, i have 1gig of ram and i used to have a geforce 6600 128mb.
playing the sims 2 was sweet, even with the expansions installed.
there was very little lag, and i spent hours in front of the computer.
when i would play counter-strike: source, it looked great.
i even used that hdr (i think, you know that stuff where it was featured in half-life: lost coast) and it was playable with no lag.
so you really can't choose.
:p
