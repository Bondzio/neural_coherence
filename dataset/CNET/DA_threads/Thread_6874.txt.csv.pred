1.1.1	I have an Intel duel core & quot ; extreme & quot ; cpu but when I run video processing programs , Avid , Pinnacle , or Coral , the average cpu usage rate averages just below 50 % .Is there anything I can do to get that to a higher number thus cutting the processing time ?	Ques
1.2.1	But in spite of this you should see your dual core work smoothly compared to a single core .	St
1.2.2	I use Virtual Dub and it taps both cores just fine .	St
1.2.3	DVD FLICK did too .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	It prolly uses 1 core or offloads the work to the GPU	St
