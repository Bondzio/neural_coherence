<s> Also download ccleaner (free) and use that to clean your c-drive. </s>
<s> Or did you do that already (you didn't tell). </s>
<s> Together, this might make a difference, already. </s>
<s> Then there might be other folders on the c-drive you created yourself, that could just as well be on the d-drive. </s>
<s> That's different for everybody, so I can't tell. </s>
<s> You can. </s>
<s> If the e:-drive is still empty, and you don't use it for backup (let's assume that you have another medium to backup to, which is better), you can: a. </s>
<s> Leave it empty as long as the c and the d are big enough. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> Move data to it (like you move data from c to d) c. Find a partition utility to combine d: and e: into one big d: partition. </s>
<s> Totally your choice. </s>

<s> You truly need to review just what is on your C drive. </s>
<s> If you have installed pgms. </s>
<s> to it more than likely any data will also reside there. </s>
<s> Thus, it all adds up over the long run. </s>
<s> At the same time if you save or back-up to it as well to include any restore points. </s>
<s> You can if there are no other problems, simply turn off the restore feature for the time being, save that setting and reboot. </s>
<s> Again, provided there are no problems other than what you mentioned, the restore points and thus all its space used can now be deleted. </s>
<s> Once done, you can then trun back the restore feature and restart the saving points again. </s>
<s> Hopefully, that will use less space. </s>
<s> Using any proper cleaner, like CCleaner or similar run it it and also do the std. </s>
<s> cleaning and return the used space back. </s>
<s> That's one item, you can also once you saved any data to a peculiar pgm. </s>
<s> do a deletion as well. </s>
<s> Re-install on the D drive. </s>
<s> Make sure it stores it data there as well. </s>
<s> Hopefully that returns some space to the C drive. </s>
<s> The saved data can be returned and be used as before. </s>
<s> The real solution provided the C drive was small to begin with, replace it with a larger one, rather used or new. </s>
<s> Since you have 3 partitions, it suggest you really have one physical hard drive. </s>
<s> Alas, since the back-up partition is empty you never actually used it for that purpose -OR- have backed-up to yet another partition, most likely C drive. </s>
<s> You system info is sparse, so do tell exactly what do you have installed. </s>
<s> can't you open the case and check it? </s>
<s> You can use the pgm. </s>
<s> PC Wizard and run it to display the details of your system as well, once space is available to install. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> thanks guys one thing i forgot to state was that when i go to my computer folder the C drive is colured blue the others are black as normal ,when i open it some prgm are blue as well folders are normal i will try what you suggest again thanks </s>
<s> Follow what others have said here about moving any installed programs off of your c:Boot Partition. </s>
<s> Your PC hard drive was partitioned to left a specific portion free for your OS, the c: partition. </s>
<s> Nothing else should be installed there. </s>
<s> What this means is that every time you install a new program, you will have to tell the setup software to choose the d: Data Partition path to install to. </s>
<s> Almost all setup programs will automatically choose c: by default, so you MUST change the path to d: before you install new programs. </s>
<s> Having a full hard drive partition is very bad because nothing new, such as updates to the OS, can be installed. </s>
<s> Too, there is absolutely no room for a defragmenting program to work. </s>
<s> A partition needs at least 10% free space to work properly, and for Windows virtual memory to use. </s>
<s> You should allow more space if you know you will need to install more data in that partition, such as updates. </s>
<s> Your e: Back-UP Partition is just that - space set aside to backup your d: Data Partition. </s>
<s> A good backup software program should be used from time to time to do this, unless you have nothing important on your data partition. </s>
<s> Win7 may come with one built in and might be found somewhere on your c: Boot (OS) Partition. </s>
<s> If you use the current Norton Security Suite, there is such a program built in to it for customer use. </s>
<s> (Comcast ISP customers are able to install this great software for free and use on up to 7 PCs. </s>
<s> It also has tools for cleaning the registry and deleting temp files not needed any longer, as well anti-virus, anti-malware, and anti-spyware functions.) </s>
<s> Second paragraph: ...was partitioned to leave a specific portion free... </s>
<s> You data is all on the boot drive, under &quot;users&quot;. </s>
<s> Your pagefile.sys (hidden) should be moved onto all three partitions. </s>
<s> Boot Partition: 512 MB, Data: 1024 MB, and the backup partition should let Windows decide. </s>
<s> Don't use Windows backup. </s>
<s> I use Cobian (freeware), but might look at others too. </s>
<s> In Window, there is a lot of rubbish. </s>
<s> Get a Linux boot-cd, remove Adobe (use Foxit), games, lanuages you don't use, Norton or whatever other firewalls/ anti-virus you have. </s>
<s> Put your &quot;Program Files&quot; folder onto Drive DATA, use a good registry/ operating system cleaner (&quot;Advanced System Care&quot;). </s>
<s> Get a &quot;chkdsk /f&quot; to remove any partition & disk faults on all your drives. </s>
<s> If you can, use NTFS (not Fat32) on all your drives; self-healing, less waste space. </s>
<s> On my Bott drive, I NTFS-COMPRESS every folder on the drive. </s>
<s> But do not NTFS-compress the files on the boot drive; only the folders. </s>
