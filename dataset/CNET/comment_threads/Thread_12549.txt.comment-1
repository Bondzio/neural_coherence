Hey guys first post and it'd be awesome if I got some help.
I'll try explaining in steps what the problem is.
-Playstation 3 got the yellow light of death(seems to be an overheating issues) -I called Sony and they would send me a box but I need to get all my save files off my hard drive as I have some games with upto 80 hours on there.
(Yes I know I'm an idiot for not backing up recently I already beat myself up for that) -I bought a Usb to Ide/Sata adapter to try and get the data off -To get the drive to recognize I had to partition and format(Really stupid of me I think) -Nothing was on the drive when it finally did get recognized -I used EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard Professional 4.3.6 to try and get the data off but all I got was .gzip(17.5 gigs) files.
-Also, if you're wondering why I didn't just keep the drive and send the ps3 to sony.
Sony would send me a refurb unit and with the ps3 it asks you to reformat once you put a drive into the console that it wasn't originally on(same problem if I just took the hdd and put it into a friends ps3 to get data off) Is there anything at all I can do to try and get my files off that hard drive?
Thank you so much for your help =(
