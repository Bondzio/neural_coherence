with socket 468 that use the nForce chipsets [any of the nForce versions].
Plenty for the LG 775 socket Intel CPU's.
I hope that you are not confusing the nForce chipset [made by NVidia] with the Gforce video chips.
Two totally different animals.
Basically any system with any chipset will run a NVidia chip video card.
