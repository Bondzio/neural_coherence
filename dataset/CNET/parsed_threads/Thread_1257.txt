<s> I recently was upgraded at work to Windows 2000. </s>
<s> I have a Lexmark E238 pinter. </s>
<s> Prior to upgrade, I was able to print documents with no problems. </s>
<s> Since the upgrade, when printing saved documents in Wordperfect 8, I get &quot;gibberish&quot; language - the characters look like playing card suits, and emoticons. </s>
<s> Strangely I have no problems with documents I just type out and have not save. </s>
<s> I downloaded the updated driver for the printer. </s>
<s> This does not happen in any other programs. </s>
<s> Is is possible for a communication problem with Corel and Lexmark? </s>
<s> Or Corel/Lexmark/Windows? </s>
<s> Can any one help? </s>
<s> Thank you for any assistance. </s>
<s> try updating the drivers, and I think you will have to use one of the PS (post script) ones. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;try updating the drivers, and I think you will have to use one of the PS (post script) ones.&lt;&lt; Thanks for suggestion, unfortunately I already tried this. </s>
<s> It is definately the printer and Wordperfect. </s>
<s> I switched with co-worker and her printer (HP) worked fine. </s>
<s> I may have to see if we can make switch permanent or see if boss will spring for new printer. </s>
<s> But will would like to see if I can resolve it first. </s>
<s> Have you get the drivers from Corel or such? </s>
<s> Someone suggested using a universal driver PCL driver for the printer. </s>
<s> I figured it couldn't be any worse than what I had so I found it at Lexmark, downloaded it, clicked on the exe file and let it do its work. </s>
<s> One thing in case anyone has the same problem is it told me to click on &quot;add new printer&quot;, and not to choose a manufacturer but to just click on &quot;have disk&quot;. </s>
<s> (I kept on picking the exact printer name I had). </s>
<s> Went to the folder that was created after I click the exe and follow the path to the inf file. </s>
<s> The system named the printer Lexmark Universal not Lexmark E238 (which is what I kept trying to call it). </s>
<s> In case anyone needs it the name of file would be: Lexmark_UD0_2KXP03_x86_PCL_Emul_sys_en.exe Not sure how to post the link for it but the description under it is &quot;Lexmark Lexmark Universal PCL Emulation system driver&quot;. </s>
<s> Thanks for all help. </s>
<s> BTW, will also keep in mind about the drivers for corel. </s>
<s> I'll track them down in case I need them for the future. </s>
<s> Sorry for length of this post. </s>
<s> I am now going to go off and dance the happy dance. </s>
<s> :-) </s>
