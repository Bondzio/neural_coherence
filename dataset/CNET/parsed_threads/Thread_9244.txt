<s> After a few years most DVDRW drives are garbage. </s>
<s> Sorry if that sounds awful but anything I can do to get people to test out the machine with another drive sooner rather than later is going to save everyone time. </s>

<s> When i first installed the drive it worked, but wasn't RW Now it wont even read the values of the disk.. always reports 0 freespace 0 used... </s>
<s> It not the HW... ubuntu sees it and functions normally.. so i'm assuming microsoft has somehow disabled these drives... help us fix this.. </s>
<s> This drive is not cheap.. back in the day it was over $250 and since sony no longer makes them.. the prices go higher today.. </s>
<s> the first 2 disks i burned, were not muli session so it would not allow an erase.. then 2nd disk was an iso.. so you can't even multi-session those.. once its burned it's burned.. </s>
<s> I tried eraseing them anyway.. so now i hve 2 disks that report 0used space 0 free space.. and are now useless =/ Currently searching for software that will allow multisession burns.. mostly for mp3s.. </s>
<s> I want them to be on a dvd so i can take it with me, but i also want to be able to erase and re-record if errors are present. </s>
