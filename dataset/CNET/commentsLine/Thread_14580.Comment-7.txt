so far this monitor has been great except for one problem.
the 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode.
i cannot get it to work in digital mode.
instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output.
i can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen.
is this expected or should i exchange the monitor?
i was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card.
