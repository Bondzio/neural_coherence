<s> I just replaced my motherboard with a used one of the same make/model/chipset, so bootup was quite easy. </s>
<s> However, there's one problem: my floppy (A) drive isn't recognized. </s>
<s> It doesn't light on startup, and isn't shown in Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> (OS is Win98SE). </s>
<s> I'm sure one possible reason for this is a damaged/defective motherboard, but am hopeful there's another, less drastic, cause. </s>
<s> Can someone please give me some insight as to what's causing this? </s>
<s> Also, am I correct in my understanding that the red stripe on the IDE ribbon cable goes to the outboard side of the floppy drive? </s>
<s> My FD connector has alignment slots on both top and bottom, so I want to verify that I've installed the cable correctly. </s>
<s> If the drive worked before, look at the ribbon cable, the motherboard and the drive itself. </s>
<s> All have Pin 1 configuration marks. </s>
<s> Make sure the red mark on the ribbon (pin 1) goes to pin 1 on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Some floppies do not have the mark - so try the cable both ways. </s>
<s> If this doesn't work try a new cable. </s>
<s> A look in the Bios is called for to see if the drive is set to 31/2 inch/1.44mb capacity. </s>
