yup thats right im done with it but im not really sure if i should be.
See i have a pretty nice nvidia SLI rdy mobo and a EVGA 7800 gtx it justs i have never really been impressed with my graphics.
Like most of the time when i play games i get this kind of graphic ripple on the screen or maybe alittle studdering and thats not even really playing games like fear witch has a kind of slow motion drag of the graphics with it and now im thinking i should have went with a ATI GPU.
But if i did lets says buy a X1900XT CF and new PSU then a new ATI crossfire mobo in the future should i exspect better performance then what i have now or would it all be the same?
Thanks for the help, Nick
