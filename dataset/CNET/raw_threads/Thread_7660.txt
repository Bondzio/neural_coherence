First off i got no sound? i called up the guy who cleaned out my PC and put in new hardware and what not told me that its a Legacy Audio, Search up drivers for it and you will have sound... why did he not do it? i have no idea So i go up on google.ca type it in go to the site and there is no tab about updating drivers. I found one site that did, thing is it wants me to pay? i never had to do this when i had too update my video card driver. But that aint all... just wondering if i type in Audio Codecs and see what pops up. I click on Update driver, once again... need to pay??? Anyways before i get pissed off i have another question. Dumbass didnt put in a new Graphics card instead put in my old X550 256mb which cant play anything. I need one that can properly play Games such as Oblivion, The Witcher, Gothic 3 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R I am a 360 Gamer but sadly some of the games i got arent for the xbox360. Would anyone know a great Graphics card that can handle those games at high quality??? Needs to be under $150CAN. I am still scouting around and cant find anything that will last me more then 6 months... I would really appreciate it if someone can help out becouse sadly the guy who WAS! suppose to update what i asked for cant seem to answer my questions properly, And i am paying this guy almost $900CAN

The guy didnt bother sending it with the Tower... Now as for graphics card, i currently have ATI RADEON X550 256mb. My chipset is PCI-E, Now i am not an extreme gamer so i dont plan on playing games like Crysis but... i want something that will run the current games i have on high settings The Elder Scrolls Four: Oblivion, S.T.A.L.K.E.R and soon its expansion, Company of heroes, Gothic 3, and soon The Witcher. I recently went to systemrequirementslab.com and did a scan. Now i wouldent be typing in this box asking for someones opinion if i knew what the hell to get, hehe... So if you would know what i can get that wont be majorly expensive! I would appreciate it. I also checked at all sites seeing what they recommend, But i never do trust what they have down... After 2 months it goes into the garbage
