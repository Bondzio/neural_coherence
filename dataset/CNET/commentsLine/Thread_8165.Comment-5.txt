if i connect the coax cable from the wall jack directly to my television, i only get analog channels (present world).
if i add a set-top box from my cable company, i get the extra digital channels.
if i connect that same coax to the eyetv, i get the digital channels without the set-top box (?).
will the wintv-hvr-2250 do that for me as well on the pc side?
