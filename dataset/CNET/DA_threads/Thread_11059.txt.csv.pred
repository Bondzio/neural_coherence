1.1.1	Here 's my setup .	St
1.1.2	I have one computer with a Linksys Wireless G PCI Adapter in it .	St
1.1.3	I have it wirelessly connected to my 2wire modem in another room .	St
1.1.4	In the same room as my PC , I have another PC that I would like to get the internet connection shared onto .	St
1.1.5	Now , I have a netgear wireless router with 4 Ethernet ports on it , the WGR614 v6 router .	St
1.1.6	I was thinking I could simply plug both computers into this router , and set up a shared internet connection that way , but everytime I plug in this router it seems to disrupt my wireless internet connection , however then the two PCs are networked fine .	St
1.1.7	Only no internet !	St
1.1.8	Can anything be done about this short of buying a wired-only router ?	Ques
1.2.1	What is the model number of the 2Wire modem ?	Ques
1.2.2	Do you have DSL , cable , other ?	Ques
1.2.3	Did you follow the installation instructions for the Netgear router ?	Ques
1.2.4	Typical setup : Internet -- - modem -- - wireless router -- - computers The connection between the wireless router and the computers may be wired or wireless .	St
1.3.1	The swire is a 1701HG .	St
1.3.2	I 'm familiar with how networks generally work .	St
1.3.3	However , in this case I only have one wireless modem , one wireless router , and one wireless network card .	St
1.3.4	I can only connect to the modem with the wireless card .	St
1.3.5	So my question is is it more worth it to get the two computers networked or to just buy another wireless card for it ?	Ques
1.4.1	There is n't much info on that model at 2Wire.com , but this says that there should be 4 ethernet ports on the 1701HG in addition to the wireless capability : http : //www.2wire.com/ ? p=106 I might be wrong , but it looks like the 2Wire 1701HG is a router that can handle 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time .	St
1.4.2	You would n't need another wireless router .	St
1.4.3	Am I missing something ?	Ques
1.5.1	spend about $ 20 on a hub/switch and sell/giveaway the other wireless router OR castrate the netgear 's routing features .	St
1.5.2	Steps to disable the netgear 's routing features : + get the ip address of a PC connected to the linksys .	St
1.5.3	( in winxp , open a dos box , and ipconfig . )	St
1.5.4	+ plug 1 pc into the netgear but leave the netgear disconnected from the linksys + log in to the netgear 's web interface ( you 'll need to know the IP address of the netgear ; usually its 192.168.0.1 ) + open the wireless section , select disabled and click apply + open the WAN section , choose dynamic IP address and click apply + open the dhcp section , select disabled and click apply + open the LAN section , and enter the ip address of the PC replacing the last digits with 255 ( e.g .	St
1.5.5	: 192.168.0.13 becomes 192.168.0.255 ) ; save this address since you 'll need to use it access the netgear 's admin interface + let the netgear restart then turn it off + plug the netgear into the linksys using a regular ( downlink ) port ( not the netgear 's uplink port ) + turn on the netgear + plug the other pc ( s ) into the netgear the netgear should be acting as a switch now .	St
1.5.6	you 'll only have 3 available port since 1 will be used to connect it to the linksys .	St
