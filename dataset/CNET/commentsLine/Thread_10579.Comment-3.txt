i should have mentioned we've only had these pcs about a month.
i also need to make a correction on the number for the network adapter, the tech put in wmp55ag but it is still supposed to work this router.
i went to linksys and downloaded the driver update utility.
it won't run when i click setup.
error says ''cannot open file .\license.rtf'' there is a file ''license.rtf'' but i don't know where the ''.\'' came from.
and if i click ''license.rtf'' it opens so don't know why set up can't open it.
have found and disabled 'wireless zero configuration'.
will let you know how it goes tomorrow.
thank you so much for responding.
