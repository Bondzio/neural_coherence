<s> I would like to set up a computer in a public area, and I'd like to attach a printer. </s>
<s> However, it would have to be one which was coin-operated, as otherwise it will be impossible to fund, and without the need to pay, it would be taken advantage of. </s>
<s> Is there any printer that could handle the hardware and software aspects of a pay-per-page system? </s>
<s> As it would be in the UK, it would (ideally) need to recognize English currency. </s>
<s> Obviously, the lower maintenance and running cost, the better. </s>
<s> Black and white would be fine. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> They do that all the time. </s>
<s> It's in a store and you pay by the page. </s>
<s> A hardware solution like those self service photo printers may be a nice idea but do you have the near million bucks needed to create such? </s>

<s> The idea was to have in the library at our college a computer hooked up to a HD with 40,000 books, with free access 24/7, so that any time someone is doing research etc., they can use this amazing software. </s>
<s> The problem is, left to their own devices, students would print out whole sections, a hundred pages or more, without a second thought. </s>
<s> Next time they need something, they'll reprint that whole section... As you can imagine, that would use up tons of ink, paper etc. </s>
<s> However, if they need to pay lets say 5p a page, they will be more careful with these things... Any advice? </s>
<s> Set up a web page for the PDF file and for printing, cut a deal with Kinko's. </s>
<s> You need a &quot;coin box&quot; that generally has some control on printer's own frt. </s>
<s> panel or similar. </s>
<s> You must have seen such on devices for whatever but you need to talk to a service provider of such services if they can do this work. </s>
<s> more than likely its already done, I'm sure some copier center has provided such services. </s>
<s> Of course, ones not humanly handled. </s>
<s> As often the case here(USA), some decal/sticker is present for service if such a device falters. </s>
<s> You look in your local telco pages or google for same. </s>
