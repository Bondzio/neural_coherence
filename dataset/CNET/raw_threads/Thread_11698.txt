7804	0	202386	2169051	NR	MithrilSword	8/30/06 4:51 PM	1.15695666E12	Server connection problems	Hello, I've currently moved into a college dorm, and the internet works fine, but I am having trouble connecting to game servers such as Steam and Gamespy. Every time I try and refresh, the servers don't show up, and it is giving me the error of &quot;Cannot connect to master game server&quot;. I know this isn't the most detailed problem, but I thought others might have had this happen, so maybe I'll get some hints at what to do. Thanks in advance for the help.
