Also, are you connected through a hub or directly connected from PC to PC? Can you see if your Local Area Connection is enabled?

In which case I would suggest you review the use of XPs built in Internet Connection Sharing feature: http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/ics

If both computers have Static IPs assigned to their Network Cards, which I assume they do since they are talking to each other, this should also work. Make sure that on the PC that is NOT connected to the ASDL modem, you assign DNS numbers and make the gateway the IP address of the computer that is connected to the internet.
