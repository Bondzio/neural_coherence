Or would it be better for me to just get an external hard drive after all and forget all this nonsense?

The instructions are explicit for adding a RAID HD, so that will be easy. I don't know however, if you can add a HD and not have a raid set-up. Roger

Can someone help with instructions on bios install. I'm looking to add more memory to run excel and word and found a WD 80gb HD that I can install from VPR Matrix. Please Help !!!!!!
