<s> First, I want to say thanks for all the responses to my previous post. </s>
<s> Here's wht I have, and here's what I need: I bought a Belkin wireless g router, have installed the software on my desktop that has Win XP. </s>
<s> That is working fine, as far as I know, I am able to get on internet from desktop with it all hooked up. </s>
<s> Problem is, I'm not sure how to get my notebook to recognize the router. </s>
<s> It is a Toshiba Tec 8200 that has a Wireless 802.11b PCMCIA card. </s>
<s> I've tried Belkin's tech support for an hour online with no human, so I'm turning to the techies here. </s>
<s> I thought maybe I had to install the router software on to my laptop, but it doesn't seem right, it's telling me not to hook up router yet, as if it's the first time. </s>
<s> Anyway, I tried just opening Internet Explorer on my laptop, but no network settings detected. </s>
<s> What am I doing wrong here??? </s>
<s> My network card should be compatible as far as I know. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> a wireless icon on the taskbar? </s>
<s> When right clicked does it offer to View Available Wireless Networks? </s>
<s> The problem is your router is probably set to G only. </s>
<s> What you need to do is go into your router and change the setting from 54g only to 54g auto. </s>
<s> 1. go to router page (default is 192.168.2.1) 2. go to &quot;channel and SSID&quot; on left collum 3. </s>
<s> Under wireless mode, click the arrow and change it to 54G-Auto. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> Forgot to say the default password on the belkin router is nothing....just push submit, and you have to use the WIRED computer. </s>
<s> I read somewhere that I should not use the default SSID, if I change it, how many characters should I use? </s>
<s> and, on my laptop, the tray icon for local area connection is X'd out with my wifi card in. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> I don't understand how to follow your directions. </s>
<s> sorry, can you tell me how to get to the router page again? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Hi, I can't see any icon for wirelss adapter, I do have an icon that says Intel PEOset that gives a choice to select an adapter. </s>
<s> It gives an IP address, network drive status is loaded, etc.... </s>
<s> I checked my device manager and the network card is working. </s>
<s> I have 2 icons in the control panel, one says Wirelss Link, one says Wireless Network. </s>
<s> Under Wiress Network, it ask me to add/edit Configure a profile. </s>
<s> I have no clue what to do here. </s>
<s> This is a second hand computer that was obviusly configured for another network. </s>
<s> Can you help?? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> What is the model name of your Belkin router? </s>
<s> Router manufacturers usually have a quick start instruction manual (usually a couple pages with pictures) that will tell you how to access the router's administration page. </s>
<s> If you don't have this, download it from Belkin.com. </s>
<s> that you are apparently running on your taskbar has the needed tools to connect to your router. </s>
<s> If your IP/subnet/gateway addresses are all proper for your router, you should have no trouble connecting. </s>
<s> Report back on those figures as well as the OS and network adapter being used. </s>
<s> I went to my Win 2000 laptop's &quot;network and dialup connections&quot;, opened up the X'd out &quot;Local Area Connection&quot; (Is that correct? </s>
<s> there was another &quot;home&quot; network icon that when I clicked asked for user name and passwordand wouldn't connect) then highlighted Internet Portocol TCP/IP, clicked on &quot;Properties&quot;, typed in IP address I found on my XP desktop 192.169.2.1, submask 255.255.255.0 DNS server 192.168.254.254. </s>
<s> Still no luck connecting, I'm sure it has something to do with he previous server and it's probably something fairly simple but I can't figure it out. </s>
