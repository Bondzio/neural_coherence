My bet is you'll have to buy a second x540 off ebay. That's not a bad deal since power bricks could run that much! Bob

The critical points are the input fitting (size) and DC voltage, best to take them with if you decide to try this. Oddly enough I had an OLD scanner laying around a while back and the inverter had gone south, went to radio shack, did a match up and it worked. Just a thought. Again, the fitting and voltage (DC) are the critical issues.
