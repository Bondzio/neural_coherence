the x850xt is the faster card but lacks sm3 features (like hdr).
however, those features require quite a bit of graphics horsepower, and they're of little use on mid-range (like the x1600xt) or low-end cards since if you turn on sm3 features, frame rates drop so low as to make the game unplayable.
here are benchmarks for both:  therefore, i suggest the x850xt over the x1600xt.
if you can afford a few dollars more, an nvidia 7600gt is a better choice... comparable speed to x850xt and sm3 features.
