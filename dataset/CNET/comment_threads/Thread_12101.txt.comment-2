From http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=325975 &quot;SYMPTOMS When you connect any of the Microsoft IntelliMouse products listed in the &quot;Applies to&quot; section of this article to your computer through the PS2 port, the light on the mouse stays lit when you turn the computer off.
CAUSE The PS2 port continues to supply power after you turn the computer off.
RESOLUTION To resolve this issue, you can use the USB port to connect your device to the computer.
If all of the available USB ports are in use, you can purchase a USB hub.
A USB hub increases the number of USB devices that you can connect to your computer.
If the continuous mouse light is acceptable to you, you can safely leave the mouse connected to the PS2 port.
