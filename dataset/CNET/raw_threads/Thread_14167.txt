The now common DVDRW media. My photo collection gets put on a set of rotating sets of media. A little more time consuming but worth it. My family gets sent a yearly copy. 3. A network copy to a secure server (I use OpenSSH.) 4. And finally a few items I carry with me on the USB memory key. Bob

There are several companies that offer this facility. Their prices range considerably from free for limited space, to cheap for normal home use, to expensive for business facilities. Search Google for &quot;online backups&quot;. You will also find some comparative reports, though they may be out of date.

It'll be a long time before I go that route. Put the data on DVDs and store and extra set in a locked desk at work. VAPCMD

The key here is to store a backup off-site, away from home, where it might be lost in a fire or burglary. You can keep it at work, rent a safe-deposit box, or (like I do) give it to a relative.
