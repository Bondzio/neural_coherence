the athlon 1ghz is a pop-it-in job.
the big deal is if you have added a second hard disk and what else, the power supply may be nearing its limit.
the athlon 1ghz will add to the load.
but there are no jumpers to change.
you want the 10 time 100 fsb model since it runs at the fsb speed.
please don't ask what fsb when we have google.com.
you'll need a new heatsink and cpu fan.
if you don't, the new cpu will be toast.
-&gt; it will do a little better but the big boost for our micron millenia was a better video card.
the nvidia vanta is a dog compared to the fx5700le we put in.
that upgrade is less work and pays off well.
