Intel offered us Prescott cores (and progeny) with high clock clock speeds, high power consumption, and a lot of heat. AMD pushed forward with alternative engineering and better gaming CPUs. The consumer wins when the big boys have competition. Better quality and prices. Intel Conroe sounds great. Now I want to see how AMD responds. Much more exciting than World Cup futbol. BTW, Dell acquired Alienware, which uses AMD processors.
