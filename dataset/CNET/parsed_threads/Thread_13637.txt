<s> ok so i just bought the asus n56dp-dh11 its advertised and has a sticker on it stating that it has the amd radeon hd7730m gpu, but when I look up the display driver it says it only has a amd radeon 7660G. </s>
<s> I checked the display drivers through device manager and there are two, the 7660G and another that just says 7000m series. </s>
<s> does it switch to the 7730m when gaming? </s>
<s> If the seller and ASUS won't answer this, get your money back. </s>
<s> I can't tell if this is the same issue discussed before but with the ATI series the exact names change with the amount of ram and more. </s>
<s> So the &quot;CORE GPU&quot; may indeed be the 7660G but in a laptop where it is clocked down a little it's marketing name would be the hd7730m. </s>
<s> This could upset a consumer and for a consumer my advice is to return product where support is lacking. </s>
<s> Again, there's a good reason for this. </s>
<s> As to the switch. </s>
<s> It should. </s>
