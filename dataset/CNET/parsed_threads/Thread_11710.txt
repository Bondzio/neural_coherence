<s> In the USA and most countries there are legal limits to how much power your router and devices can emit. </s>
<s> So what you should discover is that there is not perfect router that rules them all. </s>
<s> I have many routers if you count the ones at the office but for home I picked a simple Netgear 3800. </s>
<s> It covers an area half your space with ease and further at lower numbers of bars. </s>
<s> But I wonder why you are asking this question. </s>
<s> That is, you should have seen this question before and know what the answer is. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hello, We do not have any such legal problem in India as of now for the router power etc for home users. </s>
<s> I want the best router so that I can use it at home (in an office environment too). </s>
<s> I have not seen this question before anywhere, As i am the one making it on few more sites, as I have to purchase this today, we have some clients expected in office and have to show them important presentations. </s>
<s> I posted this question on tomshwardware too, if I can get better solution from available choices I have. </s>
<s> I have only following routers I can buy in my city at present (apart from the flipkart link I gave you above), please let me know if you can suggest something. </s>

<s> Most people will have there own opinion of what is the best router so I will give you mine. </s>
<s> I have the Netgear WNDR 4500 router and couldn't ask for more from a router. </s>
<s> My garage is not attached and is about 65 feet from the router located in the house. </s>
<s> That would be thru 4 walls total. </s>
<s> I can take my iPad to the furthermost end of the garage and still have 3 bars and never skips a beat. </s>
<s> I have a smart TV, wireless blu-ray player, iPad, laptop, smartphone, wireless printer and two more laptops plus their smartphones when the Grandkids are here and have never had any problems with connections. </s>
<s> As you can imagine there are many reasons to limit the power of 2.4GHz. </s>
<s> That's the frequency used in your Microwave oven and you don't want too much of that. </s>
