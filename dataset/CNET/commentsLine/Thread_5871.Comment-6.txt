product information for aca ast180-ud400a it is actually my secondary desktop for wife and child.
i have xps 410 with 2gb and was going to maybe just stick the two from the xps into the acer and then buy four matching 1gb memory to put in and max out my xps.
for now just need to know if in the original question if the ocz memory i bought is compatible with the acer and then i will work on what is compatible with my xps next.
