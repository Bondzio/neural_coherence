i'm doing some consulting for such a product.
the ones i deal with are linux based and only a few usb mice are supported.
these are made for price and to get your price points you can't support many mice.
it's also not a pc so anyone that calls it stone age may be out of touch with this market.
ok, there is one idea here.
did you try a wireless remote mouse like  given the nature of these systems that's what i would try.
