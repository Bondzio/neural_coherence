1.1.1	I have an Anthlon XP 1900+ CPU.	St
1.1.2	In my bios, there are three setting.	St
1.1.3	CPU frequency 100mhz/RAM 100mhz, CPU frequency 100/RAM 133mhz, and CPU frequency 133mhz/RAM 133mhz.	St
1.1.4	Which is correct for this CPU?	St
1.1.5	It seems the bios only displays the correct name for the CPU with the 133/133 setting.	St
1.1.6	All else and it says 1200MHZ CPU, which I know is wrong.	St
1.1.7	Still, I'd like to know.	St
1.2.1	The other settings are for instances when you have installed slower memory or are trying to troubleshoot issues.	St
1.2.2	There is a feeling that all such settings may have to vanish because it creates too many support calls.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	But I don't have PC133 RAM.	St
1.3.2	I have PC2100 DDR.	St
1.4.1	&quot;But I don't have PC133 RAM.	St
1.4.2	I have PC2100 DDR.&quot; PC133 was to note the clock rate to the memory.	St
1.4.3	In (most?)	St
1.4.4	DDR RAM, the numer refers to some bytes per second.	St
1.4.5	The math then looks like this: clock rate times byte count on stick x double (data rate) = number OR 133 x 8 x 2 = 2,128 Since no one will note PC2128, they round it off.	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	the fsb needs to be changed to 133mhzit defaults to 100mhz	St
