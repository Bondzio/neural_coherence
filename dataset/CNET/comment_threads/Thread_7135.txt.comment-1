I have an IDE hard drive that I'm trying to convert to SATA.
Here's the adapter I bought: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812206002 I connected the female molex into the HD but the other molex doesnt' connect with the SATA power cable.
It seems as if I need a 4 pin female to 15 pin SATA power adapter but can't seem to find one.
Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
