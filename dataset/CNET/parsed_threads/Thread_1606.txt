<s> I had been experiencing problems with my old Western Digital 40 Gig Hard Drive (not sure on RPM). </s>
<s> It made a constant humming sound and occasionally, every 10 minutes or less, it would make an extremely loud whirring-type sound that lasts about 2-3 seconds and stops. </s>
<s> Also, my CPU usage is very high when doing simple tasks such as opening webpages, but the CPU spiking and the hard drive sound is not simultaneous, so I don't know if that has anything to do with the problem. </s>
<s> Anyways, I decided to purchase a new WD 120 gig 7200 RPM hard drive last week and the constant humming sound is not present, but the 2-3 second whirring sound is exactly the same. </s>
<s> I was thinking this may be a problem with my power supply, but I'm not sure. </s>
<s> I have a Intel Pentium 4 Processor 2.79 ghz, 256 MB RAM, Windows XP Professional (2002) Service Pack 2. </s>
<s> One thing you might consider is adding memory to that machine...at minimum you're 256MBs short on RAM ....and another 512MB wouldn't hurt either. </s>
<s> 1GB is even better if you use the PC much. </s>
<s> Re the 'hum' . </s>

<s> check the other fans...case fans, PSU fans, CPU HS Fan or chipset HS Fan. </s>
<s> While you're checking do yourself a favor an blow out those dust bunnies...they tend to make clog up everything and make the system run hotter. </s>

<s> Yeah, I'll get some more RAM and then get back to you if there are still problems. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
