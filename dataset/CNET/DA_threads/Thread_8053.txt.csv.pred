1.1.1	One of the nVidia 7600GT graphics cards connected to my evga board stopped working.	St
1.1.2	When I pulled it out I noticed 4 of those round capacitors had broken tops.	St
1.1.3	As if something had exploded through it.	St
1.1.4	One capacitor on the other card is the same.	St
1.1.5	Is that supposed to happen, when the card gets old or too hot?	St
1.1.6	Its only 2 years old This is my first time seeing a graphics card and putting a system together can anyone explain this?	St
1.1.7	Thanx for any information.	St
1.2.1	If you type BAD CAPS at google you learn the story.	St
1.2.2	It's not the card maker but bad corporate espionage with a stolen formula that was incomplete.	St
1.2.3	You now see these by the thousands.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Nvidia supposedly had a bad rash of bad video cards that was reported to have bad caps issue.	St
1.3.2	I don't recall all the models but this was 1-2yrs.	St
1.3.3	ago and users had several complaints filed, so google for such to narrow it down.	St
1.3.4	I believe they were 8xxx series, which they fixed by the vendor/maker, thus brands like PNY, XFX, and others got the fix/repair for Nvidia chipsets.	St
1.3.5	In many cases, a s/w fix was to slowdown the video port in order to help cool it.	St
1.3.6	This is NOT the same issue of poorly manufactured caps, but the rather the chipsets.	St
1.3.7	The side effect is blown caps which look just like &quot;bad caps&quot; once googled.	St
1.3.8	http://www.pcworld.com/article/166277/nvidia_overcomes_bad_graphics_chips.html Be aware poor cooling can also result in blown caps, thus be sure whatever cooling is being offered actually does the job.	St
1.3.9	Video cards can get into stressed conditions all too fast.	St
1.3.10	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	Thanks to both of you guys for the knowledge.	St
1.4.2	I did many hours of research on those cards and still picked the wrong ones!	St
1.4.3	Oh well thanks again.	Polite
