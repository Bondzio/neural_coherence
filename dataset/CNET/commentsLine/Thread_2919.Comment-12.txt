paid a lot of money for a raid 1 - if your main drive goes bad slowly you will lose the mirror.
it happened to me twice.
viruses take both out also (i know - duh)but the point is - cannot use either to get the data off.
i lost both to a power surge - lightening strike while the machine was off.
now i have an internal 3rd drive using norton and backing up the raid - also two external drives which i alternate and backup the files.
i used the refrigerator trick and it worked - also sent one out for recovery and $500 later got most of the data back.
the biggest pain - reregistering software bought on line - find the old emails - contacting the companies.
the very worst - ptc engineering software - it took me weeks to get it installed and reconnected back into the server.
some software upgrades require the loading of previous versions - mathcad and pinnacle (have to go back 3 versions).
as much as i hate it - i buy the cd backups or you can spend weeks re-downloading everything.
sure getting the data back is important but having to reload everything to include all the updates - is insane - mirror is the way to go.
if you are using raid 0 - get ready the data is split between the drives - so what you actually retrieve is a crap shoot - unless you really pay attention - so which drive goes out?
you are about to enter the twilite zone.
