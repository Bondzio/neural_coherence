That's proper for HD Audio and I will stop there since the reset of why is on the internet.
As to disabling that, no.
Don't do that.
Read this link and if your driver install order was wrong, sound can go missing.
There is no known quick fix.
I start over.
Maybe the web has better ideas.
And I make a big assumption you got the drivers from the laptop maker too.

Order matters.
