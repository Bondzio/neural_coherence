Their newest router, the westell 7500, and their older one, the westell 327w. I want to setup a home network. I have heard there is a way to have these 2 routers connect wirelessly (one threw the other) so that i can hook up direct tv dvr to the internet w/out running a long cable. PLEASE help quickly!
