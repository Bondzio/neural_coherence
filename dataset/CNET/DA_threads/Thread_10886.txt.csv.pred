1.1.1	Hi.	St
1.1.2	I'm wondering what the difference is between Cat5e cables and the Cat6 variety.	St
1.1.3	Thanks a lot.	St
1.2.1	CAT5e supports signal rates up to 200 MHz, while CAT6 can support signal rates more than 3 times faster.	St
1.2.2	Other than their internal structures, that's about the main difference.	St
1.3.1	Thanks.	St
1.3.2	In terms of mega- and gigabits, how fast are these rates?	St
1.4.1	Mega = million; giga = billion, more or less.	St
