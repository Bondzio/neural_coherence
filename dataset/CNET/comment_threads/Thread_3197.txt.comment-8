and you're maybe blaming the video card because the timing was so close, but this is a simple test to try... Western Digital drives.
If you hear that clicking noise when the drive's flat data cable is disconnected from the drive and the drive is ONLY connected to its power cable, then I'm afraid your drive is unable to put itself &quot;online&quot; and is completely inaccessible from the outside world.
This &quot;power cable only&quot; test is what the Western Digital Technical Support people had us perform in order to diagnose a dead drive ... and it's conclusive.
If, however, this clicking happens later on, after the drive is up and running and you're only trying to read a particular file -- then the great majority of your data probably is recoverable.
