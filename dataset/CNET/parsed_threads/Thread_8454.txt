<s> Hi, recently my friend is looking for a good computer that would be good for gaming, his price range is 350. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> Gaming is a sure thing. </s>
<s> For the computer they could get a free old one from freecycle or the free area of craiglist and that will do the rest. </s>

<s> Typically prices for gamer PC's aren't cheap or within that $350 range. </s>
<s> You can buy a PC in the USA when on sale or &quot;entry level&quot; models that are in $350+ excludes taxes and/or any S/H, but a decent price should start in the $500 or more. </s>
<s> It still depends on what is put into the PC as well, because better named devices or performance to include GPU, PSU and/or extra cooling etc. </s>
<s> not to mention the case as well would push pricing up. </s>
<s> So, let's be realistic in finding a gaming PC would demand better funds to spend. </s>
<s> I exclude the availability of any used parts or carry-over parts to a newer PC that one can build. </s>
<s> Also, the OS for now is generally when a retail versions is in the $100+ range as an added expense if not carried over from old PC in legitimate fashion. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>

<s> Are you willing to build one? </s>
