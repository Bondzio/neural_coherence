i'm looking at replacing an old compaq laptop with a netbook.
i would basically use it when travelling for internet, email & uploading my photos from my camera.
how difficult will it be for a computer illiterate person to install programs onto the netbook.
i've tried using a flash drive or sd card in the past cuz my cd drive on the laptop died but had problems installing the programs (incomplete, missing something).
was thinking of trying to hook it up to my deskptop but still wouldn't know waht to do after that.
is there someplace that can help with this problem & do it in simple layman terms.
still trying to decipher all the terms to understand what is what on the netbooks.
i've been reading the forums but you guys throw around terms that just confuse me.
if it isn't something easily understood to do then maybe i just need to consider getting another laptop.
thanks for any help.
