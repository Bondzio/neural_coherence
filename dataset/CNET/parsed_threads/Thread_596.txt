<s> A work colleague just told me this. </s>
<s> His mother purchased a Dell notebook a few months ago and it would not start this morning. </s>
<s> She rang Dell CS number and was answered by a person with Indian accent. </s>
<s> He was talking fast and hard to understand. </s>
<s> After a few minutes, he told the lady to get a screw driver and open the case and see if we can work things out. </s>
<s> What is Dell thinking? </s>
<s> That's all the tech support does in India &quot;Open the case and we will run through the checklist.&quot; That's why I tell people to stay away from dell products. </s>
<s> (Of course they don't listen and soon regret it.) </s>

<s> When my Acer's LAPTOP CDRW failed, I had the option of replacing it myself. </s>
<s> They overnighted the drive to me and I replaced it the next day. </s>
<s> Imagine how much time if I didn't have the option. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
