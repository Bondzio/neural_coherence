Haven't been able to successfully troubleshoot the issue. I have Norton anti-virus installed and updated and no viruses have been detected after a full scan, so I've ruled viruses out. I'm wondering if it could be my processor, motherboard, OS or video card (or combination). Do you have any suggestions how I could troubleshoot this issue? Having to re-boot is becoming a drag. PC Configuration ================================= Processor = 1ghz Athlon Thunderbird Motherboard = Asus Av7 Hard drive = 40Gb Maxtor (13Gb still available) Ram = 762mb OS = XP SP2 Video Card = Guillemot 4500 64mb KyroII Tower = Antec 350watt

Another area to look at is &quot;bad capacitors&quot; which looked bugled or distorted or even leaky. You need to inspect the mtrbd. for that and these look like little cans on the mtrbd. They should look regular and seem similar even if the size is dissimilar. You can google for an example, try &quot;bad caps&quot; as keywords. On another note, if it stops at the same time or place, see if reseating ram helps or swap them around. Last, if you haven't already opne the case anyways anmd clean the the dust bunnies out with compresed air. The cpu itself is suspectable to heat damage as were AMD cpu of that type. They just can't take for too long with loss cooling or an iffy fan. Inspect for that as well. tada -----Willy
