I'm planning to get a new computer but I'm unsure of what type of hardware (vid. card, mother board, etc.). My budget is $1,500 dollars including the case. Also i want it to be a gaming computer, so good graphics card and good amount of RAM over everything else pretty much. Thanks.

That means, you need the following for a pc case psu os memory motherboard hard drive processor arctic silver optical drive fans That's it. For case, choose what catches your eye. PSU, look at the +12V rail and wattage. OS-Either Windows Home or Pro. Linux maybe? Memory-on a $1500 budget, 1GB at least Motherboard- PCi-express slot is a must Hard Drive-250GB SATA, look for deals on newegg Processor-AMD? Intel? Dual-Cores? Arctic SIlver 5 thermal compound is required imho. optical drive- NEC 3540-A DVD+_RW BUrner-$39 at newegg.com Fans- Most come with case, so may not be necessary. NEWEGG.com is a good website and offers decent prices. ROger

Get at least 1 gig of ddram, or rambus. More than 1 cant hurt and will definitely help. Dont see why you'd need more than 60-80 gig hard drive, really. How many games can you load on already in one shot? If you'll be doing heavy duty gaming you'll want a case with a good power supply and plenty of room for fans. Make sure your motherboard has room to expand. Make sure it has at least 4-6 USB slots. There is nothing more irritating then unplugging something so you'll have room for another USB device. USB and firewire is the future- make sure you have them.
