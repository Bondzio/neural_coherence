I would be most interested in hearing what you recommend to handle an i7 975, nothing extreme on the OC front, 6 GB Corsair DDR3 1600, 2 GTX 295's SLI and will fit in an Antec 902?
Money isn't an issue, but obviously I don't want to blow money on a board that is just as good as a cheaper one but has features I probably won't need (3rd sli slot etc).
