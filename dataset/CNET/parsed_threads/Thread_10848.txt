<s> My home wireless network uses a Netgear DG834G modem/router, and my two desktops and a laptop all plug away on the internet perfectly. </s>
<s> However, they now cannot see each other, or the shared printer. </s>
<s> I have been into the router's properties and setup, but cannot identify a reason for this. </s>
<s> I am thinking there may be a WinXP service turned off on the computer systems. </s>
<s> All drives are set up with the sharing hand icon under them, and the printer is set up to share. </s>
<s> At this stage I would like a definitive list of which of the services need to be running for the XP machines to see each other and trade files, please. </s>
<s> I cant work it out at the moment. </s>
<s> Do you have the XP Firewall on? </s>
<s> If you do, you'll have to allow the computers access each other. </s>
<s> All three computers run XP firewall, and on each one the File and Printer Sharing tickbox is enabled. </s>
<s> I am at a loss as to what to do next. </s>
<s> I am aware that the individual computers need to communicate via the modem/router, and TCP/IP is enabled on each. </s>
<s> Few do. </s>
<s> If you don't allow the traffic you can't share. </s>

<s> I have all the firewall exceptions set to allow file and printer sharing, but still cannot see other computers in this wireless home network of three. </s>
<s> I am convinced that the problem has something to do with which XP services are enabled, although I was advised that NetBios was not required, only TCP/IP. </s>
<s> I have read the comments ridiculing the endeavours of some users in this forum who are attempting to tune a wireless network, and that rather puts me in the same boat, I fear. </s>
<s> In order is they need to unshare the share and reshare. </s>
<s> Someday I hope they fix that issue. </s>
