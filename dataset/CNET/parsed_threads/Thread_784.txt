<s> I just upgraded my graphics card from an old NVidia GeForce4 Ti 4400 128MB, to an ATI Radeon 9550 256 MB, and I'm totally confused (system is an Athlon XP 2100+ with a Gig of RAM by the way). </s>
<s> I was running some framerate tests on Counterstrike Source, and they are shockingly MUCH lower with the new card. </s>
<s> On one test, the old framerate was 61.42, and with the new card 37.55. </s>
<s> In another test with slightly higher settings, the old card 53.51 and the new card 29.93! </s>
<s> Now I know the 9550 isn't a monster of a card, but it should still be faster than that old GeForce4 (probably a 4 year old card). </s>
<s> At the VERY LEAST it shouldn't be drastically slower. </s>
<s> Any answers/opinions/suggestions?!?!?!? </s>
<s> Thanks, - Joe </s>
<s> ANY change will toss the results into question. </s>
<s> There could be other factors such as outdated motherboard/other drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The settings were identical. </s>
<s> The mobo drivers are outdated (I am about to update them), but wouldn't that have affected the old card as well? </s>

<s> a geforce ti-4200 is comparable to radeon 9600pro. </s>
<s> a geforce ti-4400 is a bit faster. </s>
<s> a radeon 9550 is a cut-back radeon 9600 so it will be noticeably slower than a ti-4400. </s>
<s> here are benchmarks which include the geforce ti-4200/4400 and radeon 9500/9600. </s>
<s> you can interpolate to estimate the performance of the ti-4400 and 9550. http://www.tomshardware.com/2004/10/04/vga_charts_iv/page7.html </s>
