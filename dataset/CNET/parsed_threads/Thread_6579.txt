<s> I'm still using a CRT and I don't think a typical LCD would give me a better image. </s>
<s> I'm seeking some expert advice. </s>
<s> (1) I do mechanical CAD, electronic CAD, spreadsheets, etc. </s>
<s> I don't do gaming or videos. </s>
<s> (2) I currently use a Dell M991 19&quot; monitor. </s>
<s> The recommended resolution is 1024x798 (3) I have my video board set for 1600x1200. </s>
<s> (4) I can see and read all the characters. </s>
<s> I cannot detect any &quot;stair stepping&quot; on lines that are nearly horizontal or vertical. </s>
<s> I assume that, with a recommended resolution of 1024x798, the shadow mask is of that resolution as are the color pixels. </s>
<s> But I gather the beam must split or scatter or whatever so that a 1600x1200 image is satisfactorily rendered on the screen. </s>
<s> Please correct me if I am wrong (if it is important to my understanding this). </s>
<s> If I were to connect a 1920x1080 LCD monitor, what would it display with the video set to 1600x1200? </s>
<s> Note, 1600x1200 is the highest resolution mode my board has and it doesn't have a 1080 line mode. </s>
<s> Specifically, (1) Would the monitor try to stretch the horizontal 1600 pixels to 1920 using some kind of digital processing and pixel replication? </s>
<s> (2) Would it shrink the 1200 vertical to fit on the 1080 lines using digital processing to combine or delete some lines? </s>
<s> (3) If either of the above is true, do different manufacturers have better or worse processing? </s>
<s> (4) Would the overall effect be better than what I have now or worse? </s>
<s> Also, regarding screen size. </s>
<s> I can see everything fine at the distance I am at now on my 19&quot; screen. </s>
<s> What good would be a 22&quot; or 24&quot; screen with the same 1920x1080 resolution? </s>
<s> After all if it has the same number of pixels, all that happens is the pixels get larger. </s>
<s> But no more information will be presented is that right? </s>
<s> So the only &quot;gain&quot; will be the ability to view it from further away, right? </s>
<s> Thanks In Advance, Pete </s>
<s> You really didn't say much about the system you are using, OS hardware, etc. </s>
<s> so it is a bit hard to say what would function best. </s>
<s> IF you have a system that supports 1080p graphics then the LCD (with 1080p capability) would likely be a good way to go, hooking up via DVI or HDMI rather than VGA, again it would depend on hardware and system capabilities. </s>
<s> A little more info might help. </s>
<s> Overall, if your CRT broke, you'll be left will little to replace it with. </s>
<s> CRT's are history unless you seek a high-end model. </s>
<s> For those costs, the use of a basic LCD will do fine to include any so-called TV monitors types. </s>
<s> Switching to a decent LCD and having better abilities may seem nothing to gain, but then again once you leave 19in. </s>
<s> monitors, having a larger display may help in CAD setups. </s>
<s> The LCDs provides far greater display and that alone if you decide could be a good decision to go by. </s>
<s> You can review or decide by looking at LCDs on display at better office shops or Fry's, Best Buy, etc., to get an idea what's available. </s>
<s> Reveiew the specs on newer LCDs to see what they offer. </s>
<s> Of course, now would be a good time to have a spare CRT, as those are practically given away, check Craigslist or GWill, Sal.Army sources. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Hi Pete, I, too, was a late convert to LCD. </s>
<s> I couldn't see how a filter/reflective technology like LCD could possibly produce a better image than a light emitter like a CRT. </s>
<s> In the early days of LCD, that was probably right but not now. </s>
<s> It's somewhat unusual to find a 19&quot; CRT with a recommended resolution of 1024x768 (4x3), most non-widescreens above 17&quot; are 5x4 (1280x1024) but there you go. </s>
<s> One attribute of CRTs you have already discovered is that you can change the resolution and still get a good sharp image. </s>
<s> Not so with LCDs - the optimal image is always produced at native resolution. </s>
<s> If you need a different size, bigger text for instance, change the dpi, not the screen resolution. </s>
<s> That has some implications for you, since your current graphics card does not support the typical native resolutions (1920x1080) on a medium size screen. </s>
<s> You should probably consider updating your graphics card to one that supports the native resolution of the screen you choose - always assuming you are using a desktop or workstation - it would be extremely difficult and certainly uneconomic to upgrade a laptop. </s>
<s> There are still a few 4x3 LCDs available, up to about 19&quot; but the native resolution will almost certainly be 1280x1024, which is worse than you are getting with your CRT. </s>
<s> But most LCD screens nowadays are widescreen, either 16x9 or 16x10 format. </s>
<s> An LCD with a resolution less than its native resolution will produce an image that looks somewhat blurry, not ideal for CAD work, I would think. </s>
<s> How an LCD behaves when the resolution of the graphics card is set higher than its native resolution (and with many, this isn't even possible) will depend on the screen/graphics card/driver combination. </s>
<s> Results can vary from no image to scroll bars! </s>
<s> As to size, you are correct, in simple terms, for a given resolution, the bigger the screen, the bigger the pixels will be. </s>
<s> You can easily check this at your local TV store - look at a 60&quot; 1080p TV and a 32&quot; 1080p TV, the difference in pixel size will be obvious close up. </s>
<s> You could say (you did) that the bigger the screen, the further away you sit. </s>
<s> Might work for TVs but on a computer, you actually need to be closer to the screen to use the mouse and keyboard.So I prefer to look at it the other way round, the distance you need to sit away from the screen will dictate the size of the screen you need. </s>
<s> At a rough guess (which could be wildly wrong!) </s>
<s> if you are happy sitting at your current distance from your CRT, then you will probably be happy at the same distance from a 22-24&quot; LCD at a resolution of 1920x1080 but your mileage will vary. </s>
<s> If you like Dell equipment like your current screen, I've seen some stunning images on a 24&quot; Dell Ultrasharp. </s>
<s> Willy hit the nail on the head - you need to go to your local computer store and spend some time looking at various screens. </s>
<s> View them from the distance you have decided you want to sit to determine the screen size you want. </s>
<s> Then compare the screens on offer at that size. </s>
<s> Ask the store rep if you can change the resolution to something else and see whether that is acceptable to you or whether you are happier at native resolution. </s>
<s> If you are then look to get a new graphics card to match, preferably DVI or HDMI. </s>
<s> You don't say whether the screen is for work or a hobby - if work, then you will likely be sitting in front of this thing for up to 8 hours a day, so a few hours checking out possibilities is a great investment. </s>
<s> Screens are just about the most subjective component of any computer system - what I like might make you ill, or vice versa! </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> I suggest that instead of choosing an LCD with 1920 x 1080 resolution, you opt for one with 1920 x 1200 resolution. </s>
<s> Interestingly, the 24&quot; Dell Ultrasharp mentioned above is 1920 x 1200 with a 16:10 aspect ratio. </s>
<s> If it will display 1600 x 1200 without horizontal stretching, it would maintain your perfect 4:3 aspect ratio, still using its native resolution with no ugly interpolated pixels, albeit with black bars on both sides of the image. </s>
<s> As mentioned, you might want to find one (or any other 1920 x 1200 monitor) in a store and play with it to see how it behaves at your desired resolution. </s>
<s> You didn't mention what video card you're using, but is it possible that it maybe it does support 1920 x 1080 and 1920 x 1200 already? </s>
<s> At the risk of stating the obvious, &quot;Windows display properties&quot; will only offer the resolutions that the monitor itself will support. </s>
<s> In any case, as mentioned, if you can upgrade your video card, you might be even happier with the results. </s>
<s> By the way, with a CRT, the shadow mask generally does not correspond to any particular resolution. </s>
<s> The position of each phosphor dot does not correspond to an individual pixel at any resolution. </s>
<s> At useable resolutions, the dot pitch is finer than the resolution. </s>
<s> It's possible that if the recommended resolution is 1024 x 768, that you are approaching or even exceeding the dot pitch at 1600 x 1200. </s>
<s> The image might be a little blurry and not really yielding the resolution that you think you're getting. </s>
<s> Just for fun, try looking at your CRT under some magnification at different resolutions. </s>
