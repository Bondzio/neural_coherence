after rereading my original post, i realize it could seem like i'm stealing someone's wireless connection.
i'm going to be chipping in for whatever fees are involved.
i was simply trying to explain the situation so that anyone who read my question would understand that i'm not directly involved in the set up process and so can't answer any specific questions regarding the setup.
in any case, and whether you believe me or not, thank you for your response.
