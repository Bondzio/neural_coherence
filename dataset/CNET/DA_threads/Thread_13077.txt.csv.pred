1.1.1	I decided to upgrade my ancient dual Pentium Pro 200mhz Socket 8 system to a faster speed.	St
1.1.2	The way I chose to do it was by acquiring two Pentium II Overdrive Processors(PODP66X333 SL2KE).	St
1.1.3	These Overdrive Processors will effectively raise the speed of my system from 200mhz to 333mhz.	St
1.1.4	The problem I'm having is that the Processors did not come with Heatsinks and Fans.	St
1.1.5	I've searched ebay, spoken to a rep from Sanyo-Denki, and Googled till I'm about to Girgle.	St
1.1.6	Can anyone help?	Ques
1.1.7	I'm including the following link which shows a really good image of the Heatsink & Fan attached to the Processor.	St
1.1.8	http://www.cpu-collection.de/?l0=i&i=1814&s=big&tb=1&n=1&sd=0	St
1.2.1	1coolpc.com Didn't you have another post on this that I responded to?	St
1.2.2	Just a little etiquette is to answer your posts rather than create new ones so we don't start over with the same answer.	St
1.2.3	I don't look up if that was you.	St
