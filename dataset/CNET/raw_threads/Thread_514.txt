2084	0	571843	5355202	NR	Ricochet84	9/2/12 1:07 PM	1.34659122E12	Need a new video card?	Hi; I just bought Skyrim for the PC. I fit all of the essential requirements, and the game will play. But for the recommended I need a better video card. I have an ATI Radeon HD 4350. Apparently that's not enough. The game is a pretty laggy (enough for it to be annoying.) Here is the requirements it says I need. Any recommendations on what I should get? I have been thinking about upgrading for a while, so I am willing to spend a fair amount. Nothing outrageous, though. I don't do THAT much gaming. Here is my PC specs.

And unless you are ready to install a new big power supply I can only offer the that 5450 can drop in without another change. And is cheep at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102882 http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/4926494171 covers this again. Once you admit that a new PSU is needed you pick your card from the usual list at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&objectID=c01894996 has ALL the specs on this machine. At least it will accept common power supplies and video cards. Bob

Common video slots at the moment are pci-e (x1) and pci-e x16. Don't buy an x16 card if your motherboard doesn't support it! Less than a month ago they published a new video card review on tomshardware.com: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html This is considered authorative, but it won't harm to look at a few other reviews for the cards that are on your shortlist after studying this.

Here the requirements: http://i50.tinypic.com/14c4scx.jpg &lt;div&gt;Here is the motherboard: http://i47.tinypic.com/s45c1k.jpg &lt;/div&gt; IPIBL-LB, If I am reading it correctly. From what I have learned, the motherboard does indeed support x16.
