<s> I just fixed a PC that belongs to a friend of mine. </s>
<s> Basically, I formatted the hard drive and reinstalled XP. </s>
<s> Though I don't know if the computer was slow before, it's slow now. </s>
<s> Well, it's slow when there are webpages involving flash, and slow when I try to resize any window. </s>
<s> I have narrowed down the problem components to the processor and video. </s>
<s> I wonder if the slowness is due to the Intel Celeron Socket 478 @ 1.73GHz, or could it be the Integrated SIS 650 graphics? </s>
<s> I'm leaning towards the graphics being the culprit. </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> The drivers for the machine were not installed. </s>
<s> These are not on the Microsoft CD. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry, I thought everyone would automatically assume that I've installed the drivers. </s>
<s> Well, I have already installed the drivers and everything in the Device Manager is fine. </s>
<s> I downloaded SIS video, SIS AGP Gart, SIS IDE, and SIS NIC drivers. </s>
<s> That pretty much covers the SIS 650 northbridge/ SIS 962L southbridge chipset drivers. </s>
<s> So what could be the culprit? </s>
<s> While the base machine is no speed demon, check out this common issue -&gt; http://winhlp.com/node/10 I rarely find people to get the drivers proper. </s>
<s> Most stop the moment the XP screens look ok. Bob </s>
<s> have you tried a chkdsk? </s>
<s> if an hdd has even 4kb in bad sectors, it can slow the computer to a crawl start --&gt; run --&gt; &quot;chkdsk /r&quot;, click ok it will ask if you would like to run at next startup, just say yes and reboot, will take a little while but when if finishes should display an output of various info one of which is bad sectors, hope this helps </s>
<s> Before I installed Windows XP, I used Darik's boot and nuke on the hard drive. </s>
<s> That should've told me of any errors, but I received none. </s>
<s> I believe you are totally ignoring the problem. </s>
<s> I have slow flash and slow window resizing and movement, but not a slow computer. </s>
<s> I get no error messages either. </s>
<s> To add to that, I just found out that when I enable Hardware Acceleration in PowerDVD, the playback slows down intermittently. </s>
<s> But when I disable Hardware Acceleration, playback is fine. </s>
<s> Though CPU goes up to 80-90% . </s>
<s> So I am pretty sure that it's the onboard video. </s>
<s> I've disliked SIS video ever since I had an SIS 530. </s>
<s> 3D games that would easily meet the minimum requirements would blank the screen while in play. </s>
<s> Ever since, I've disliked the SIS chipsets for video and the SIS 650 reassures it. </s>
<s> I will probably order the Geforce 5500 AGP card for the PC, since it has a 4X slot. </s>
<s> Thankfully SIS put an AGP slot in there. </s>
