[img] http://www.greenzer.com/blog/blog_image_store/2009/03/natual_soap.jpg [/img] is it true that if we use Soap bar to clean the surface of a disc the chemicals from it can eat away the plastic surface of the disc even after washing, even if it's a pressed silver bottomed disc like audio music cds you buy in retail shop?
thanks a lots!
