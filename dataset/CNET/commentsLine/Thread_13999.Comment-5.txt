anytime i have trouble posting i would try it again but with only 1 stick of ram in it and if it post i would then down load the newest drivers for the mother board and all the chip sets on the board and windows updates and check for a new bios update as this mother board and chips set are new then if everything worked i would install all the memory and then run memtest86 to see if all the sticks were good hope this helps good luck and take care chuck btw are you talking about the giga byte ga-m780gm-sh2 ?
or did you write this down right giga-byte ga-ma78gm-sh2 rev 1 motherboard as the 780 is the new one?
