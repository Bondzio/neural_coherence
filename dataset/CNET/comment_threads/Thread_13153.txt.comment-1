I have a small company which has separate computers for internet use and other computers for work use.
Currently all have access to the internet and the network I would like to limit those computers for internet for internet and the others for network only.
Very occassionally we would need remote access to these networked computers.
Is there some sort of router or device that I can put between our high speed modem and the rest of the network to control which pc get internet and which computer gets network access.
No I don't want seperate networks this would be way to hard to maintain.
Especially for updates etc.
