coryphaeus: thanks for clarifying 5.25&quot; disks for me.
you stated, &quot;you must look at the connecting cables on the existing drive.
flat and about 40 wires, about two inches wide?
or flat and about a half inch wide.
depending on the mother board available ports, this is important.&quot; which wire type is sata, and which is ide?
thanks.
