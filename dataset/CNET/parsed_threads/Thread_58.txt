<s> Thank you so much for your information. </s>
<s> I am a little hesitant to do that because I was told that the Dell power supplies for that model have a flaw. </s>
<s> The flaw is that they run hot and burn up the copper wire. </s>
<s> I was hoping to find a better power supply that does not have that issue. </s>
<s> Thank you again at least the dell power supply is better then none at all right.... </s>
<s> Thank you again and have a great day! </s>
