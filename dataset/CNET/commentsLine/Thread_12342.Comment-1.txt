i'm trying to get a usb mouse to work with a ps/2 to usb adapter, since my usb ports all fail to work, but it wont stay on.
my ps/2 mouse is dead so i've bought a cheap ps/2 to usb adapter off of amazon and plugged my usb mouse into it.
upon system boot, the mouse will turn on and then turn off after about two seconds.
there's nothing i can do to turn it back on and it's being to get me annoyed.
i know the mouse works fine since i just tried it on a netbook and it worked upon plug in.
does anyone have advice to offer?
