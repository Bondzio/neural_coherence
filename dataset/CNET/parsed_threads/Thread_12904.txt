<s> I was browsing at Dells offers and options and came up with this: Intel Core 2 Duo T8300 (2.4GHz/800Mhz FSB/3MB cache) [agregar $240] Intel Core 2 Duo T5750 (2.00GHz/667Mhz FSB/2MB cache) [agregar $40] Procesador Intel Core 2 Duo T5550 (1.83GHz/667Mhz FSB/2MB cache) [Incluido en el precio] Procesador Intel Core 2 Duo T7250 (2.0GHz/800Mhz FSB/2MB cache) [agregar $100] For clockspeed there are two numbers, ex. </s>
<s> 2.0GHz/800Mhz, and the first is more or less three times that of the second. </s>
<s> Now I know these are Duo but it makes no sense to me to pair a fast processor with a slower processor. </s>
<s> So what does the second number mean? </s>

<s> That second number is simply the Front Side Bus. </s>
<s> This determines how fast your processor can 'talk' to your motherboard and the rest of the components. </s>
<s> That first number is the overall speed of the processor which is the product of the FSB and multiplier; that's a little trivia if you're thinking of overclocking. </s>
<s> Basically you bigger the numbers for the both the better. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northbridge_ (computing) Note: CPU Speed is determinant by the North bridge Note: location of Front Side Bus </s>
<s> I lost you with that word. </s>
<s> Why ask here if you can better ask wikipedia? </s>
