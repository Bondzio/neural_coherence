I was ripping CD's yesterday and after a break of a few hours, returned to the computer and had problems opening the drive and when I did, the CD was not being recognized. Is there some solution to this or will it mean buying a new CD drive? I'm not sure I can trust myself fitting a new drive. Any suggestions, greatly appreciated.

Power off the PC and open the case. The drive will be readily accessible. Locate the drive and find the connector cables. Unplug the cables and use a screwdriver to remove the screws holding it in place. Remove the drive. Insert a new drive and do the above in reverse. Done. Take note of the connector cables. You'll get a new drive that matches the cables. Will be a good idea to remove the old drive first and identify the type.
