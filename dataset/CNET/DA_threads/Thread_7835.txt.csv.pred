1.1.1	I hope my question is not seen as too remedial , but I have been using Cable internet access for over a year , and have only just discovered that I can get my wife onto my account for free .	St
1.1.2	She currently struggles with AOL , and I 've been advised that I can get her using my cable connection - without no inconvenience to me ( I work from home ) - if I just network her to my computer , using a wireless router .	St
1.1.3	Could somebody advise ?	Ques
1.1.4	She has 2 USB ports , but no Ethernet port , so I 'm assuming I need to get a USB to ethernet adapter , but then what ?	Ques
1.1.5	What other stuff do I need to buy , and what do you recommend that is inexpensive but works well enough : she just needs to be able to go online to check her emails , and very rarely browse some online store or other !	Sug
1.1.6	Many thanks , in advance , for your feedback and advice .	Polite
1.2.1	This is the USB wireless adapter I use ... http : //d-link.com/products/ ? pid=175 Any simpler to set up a child could do it .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your suggestion , Michael !	St
1.3.2	I hope you wo n't mind a couple of follow-ups : Do I also need a router with this ?	Ques
1.3.3	If so , what router would you recommend I purchase ?	Ques
1.3.4	The site you referenced states it works with Windows 98SE ... does it work with the regular Windows 98 as well ?	Ques
1.3.5	My wife has a Compaq & quot ; Internet Computer & quot ; from 1999 , which works fine , and has 2 USB ports , and runs Windows 98 .	St
1.4.1	Based on the information from D-Links website , I would say Windows 98 first edition may have a problem with this adapter .	St
1.4.2	Workarounds are : 1 ) Upgrade the OS 2 ) Place the wireless router near the 98 machine and use a CAT5 cable to it .	St
1.4.3	Of course some type of ethernet adapter would need to be installed in the machine .	St
1.4.4	A multiported wireless router which feature both wired and wireless capabilities from D-Link or Linksys are among the most popular devices used .	St
1.5.1	I called D-Link , and they said it would handle Windows 98 ( but then again , I was talking to a very aggressive salesperson ! ) .	St
1.5.2	He claims I should get the G-120 , instead of the 122 , as the former goes to 54 Mbps , and the 122 only goes to 11Mbps .	St
1.5.3	I asked him if I even needed more than 11 , given my wife only uses the net for checking email , and the very rare browsing session .	St
1.5.4	He said yes , because it would ensure less dropped connections ... He also strongly recommended the DI-624 router , because they will be apparently shortly discontinuing the DI-514 ... your thoughts ?	Ques
1.5.5	thanks again , in advance , for your advice .	Polite
1.6.1	11 mbps vs 54 mbps , yes it is faster for local file transfers between computers .	St
1.6.2	As far as a faster internet connection , not really since your internet is traveling much slower then 11 mbps .	St
1.6.3	I have no idea what he meant by & quot ; less dropped connections & quot ; , this seems misleading .	St
1.7.1	I know ... 2 years later !	St
1.7.2	I just wanted to thank you for all your advice .	Polite
1.7.3	It helped alot .	Polite
1.7.4	Am now planning on upgrading my home networking ( ie : installing some beyond just simple PC to PC wireless ) .	St
1.7.5	Thanks again , and sorry for delay in expression of gratitude !	St
