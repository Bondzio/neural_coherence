1.1.1	I get an error message saying the power cable is not connected and the card is running on low power as a result .	St
1.1.2	It looks like the card has a 6 pin power cable female connector on it that needs to be supplied with power by a cable which was supposed to come with my card ( which I do n't have because EVGA did n't send me one in the upgrade replacement card they sent me . )	St
1.1.3	If you look at the below image ( the first one ) , you 'll see it 's a 6 pin female connector on the card .	St
1.1.4	There is no such male connector coming out of my computer 's PSU , ( my computer is a Dell Dimension E520 ) .	St
1.1.5	You 'll see in the second picture that there are two Molex connectors that need to plug in somewhere .	St

St
1.1.11	But where do the two molex connectors plug into ?	Ques
1.1.12	The below power supply was the only one I found that provided a six pin connector that looked like it might plug into the Graphics card .	St
1.1.13	There were other 500watt power supplies ( PSUs ) on newegg but none of them had the 6 pin power connector .	St
1.1.14	Am I to believe I have to buy the below power supply in order to use my video card ?	Ques

1.1.16	I 'm rather flummoxed by all this .	St

1.1.18	I do n't see how they answer my question ( which should be clear by now -- which is where do I plug those two giant plugs into . )	St

1.1.21	So that there is no possibility of confusion or misunderstanding , the two large molex connectors I 'm talking about are : [ img ] http : //bp3.blogger.com/_Y8WoJeZ-J4c/R-Auq-TqNTI/AAAAAAAAA4k/LnF6QJNLotk/s400/plugin.jpg [ /img ] It does n't look like my PSU is compatible with this card .	St
1.1.22	There are no free power cables coming out of the PSU , except one Molex which is up by my CD drive .	St
1.2.1	the e520 only has a 305w power supply which is too small for an 8600gts .	St
1.2.2	that 's why it does n't have a pci-e plug .	St
1.2.3	http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dime520/en/SM_EN/specs.htm # wp1052310 most new 400+ watt power supplies will be fine for you and will have the pci-e plug .	St
1.2.4	i 'm wary of thermaltake power supplies , but folks seem to like this 430w for $ 40 .	St
1.2.5	raidmax units are an OK budget alternatives with this 530w unit for $ 60 before $ 20 rebate .	St
1.2.6	do n't expect a full 530w out of it ( it 's really more like a 400w unit ) , but it will handle your 8600gts .	St

1.4.1	consider a more robust , more efficient PSU .	St
1.4.2	It can save you money in the long run as it can often be used in another system requiring more watts and AMPs and greater efficiency generates reduced energy use .	St
1.4.3	Less efficient power supplies simply use more electricity to generate the power required to run the system .	St
1.4.4	By purchasing a higher quality , more powerful , more efficient PSU now ... . the PSU will reliably support the current system , use less electricity and be transferable to a future system requiring more power .	St
