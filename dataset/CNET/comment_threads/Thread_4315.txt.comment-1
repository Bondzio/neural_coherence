All computers at this location access the Internet wirelessly through an 802.1g wireless router, which is cabled directly to a DSL modem.
The wireless network is not encrypted, and frequently interlopers can be found camped-onto my Internet connection.
Usually MAC filtering fixes this, but what I would like to do is to log traffic to and from the Internet.
Can this be done from the router or by bridging the hard-wired connection between the router and the DSL modem?
How difficult can this be?
Thanks!
