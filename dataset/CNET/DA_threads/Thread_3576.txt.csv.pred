1.1.1	Hi , I need to create a network bubble..means..Let say I have 4 machines having IP address 10.1.1.1,10.1.1.2 , 10.1.1.3 and 10.1.1.4 ( these are not actual IP 's , using them just for explaining ) .	St
1.1.2	These machines are connected to public network .	St
1.1.3	At a given point in time , I need to isolate these machines from the public network in a way where - All these 4 machines can talk to each other using the assigned IP 's .	St
1.1.4	- These 4 machines can not talk to any other nodes in the public network .	St
1.1.5	no other machines outside these 4 , will be able to ping these machines .	St
1.1.6	Looking for a generic solution which would work across all Unix , linux , windows platforms .	St
1.1.7	Please help .	St
1.1.8	Regards , Ranjit	St
1.2.1	Mostly it is a router feature and is platform independent .	St
1.2.2	Depend on the exact router model , some routers have this in the base and some you need firewall features .	St
1.2.3	Lets say your 4 example addresses are actually public routable IP The normal way to do this is to put in firewall rules or access lists that says these 4 addresses can only send or receive traffic from each other .	St
1.2.4	Now if you are using private addresses and nating them it is a little different .	St
1.2.5	You of course could just prevent these addresses from being natted .	St
1.2.6	It just makes the firewall rules a little more tricky because you have to worry about both the real and the virtual addresses .	St
1.3.1	Look for these or similar phrases when you shop .	St
1.3.2	& quot ; Client Isolation & quot ; & quot ; Guest WiFi & quot ; There is NO STANDARD here or maybe many .	St
