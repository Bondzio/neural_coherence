<s> I have an HP Pavilion 8750C / upgraded to 512 RAM, just upgraded from Win98SE to Windows XP Home Ed, and have an NEC multisync FE700 monitor. </s>
<s> It started just before upgrading to the extra ram and win xp.......when I turn my system on, what I see on the screen comes up expanded, ie oversized, spread out so to speak, then sometimes normal. </s>
<s> After doing the upgrades, it now comes up expanded all the time. </s>
<s> I have gone into control panel and checked the &quot;sizing&quot; and it is all correct, I can only get the screen to fit my monitor if I go into the monitor controls and shrink it as much as I can there. </s>
<s> I lean towards thinking it is the monitor but could use some advice. </s>
<s> I have alwasy gotten great help here, thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Microsoft doesn't do this for us and I can't know what video card driver you need since such was not revealed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It sounds as if you need to need two things besides the latest video card drivers. </s>
<s> You should see if your monitor is correctly detected by brand/model. </s>
<s> If not, a driver might be available. </s>
<s> This just defines your monitor's capabilities. </s>
<s> Next, you have some display settings including resolution and refresh that are switched to during the process of loading Windows. </s>
<s> These are not valid until this occurs and the signals sent to your monitor. </s>
<s> In the meantime, your monitor is using some internal defaults. </s>
<s> You need to adjust these using the monitor settings and not the display settings within Windows. </s>
<s> You may need to boot to a command prompt for basic settings by displaying a text window. </s>
<s> There may even be an intermediate setting and you may hear clicking within the monitor as settings change. </s>
<s> If you have some sort of a utility that boots from a floppy such as a disk utility, boot that up and adjust your monitor to properly display those as well. </s>
<s> New monitors almost invariably need adjustments for different screens and one adjustment should not mess things up for another. </s>
<s> The monitor remembers these. </s>
<s> hey guys! </s>
<s> i had this same computer and from day one! </s>
<s> i had problems. </s>
<s> the computer FROZE! </s>
<s> and from that day i had problems. </s>
<s> i bought it in 2000 and i had to replace it in 2003. so for 3 years i had a freezing problem. </s>
<s> for no reason the computer froze. </s>
<s> it wasnt until aafter 3 years that i saw an article from another pavilion 8750c user that they had the same problem. </s>
<s> it was a problem with the video card. </s>
<s> and he had changed the video card and had no problem. </s>
<s> i was mad. </s>
<s> i carried the computer to like three places including the store i bought it from, circuit city. </s>
<s> and they could find nothing wrong with it. </s>
<s> i could not believe it. </s>
<s> HP was no help at all. </s>
<s> this computer most likely froze well over 1000 times and up to this day i can not turn on for no reason. </s>
<s> when i mean freeze, i mean the computer is totaly frozen. </s>
<s> nothing responds. </s>
<s> the only way to bring the computer back to normal was to manually turn the computer off. </s>
<s> ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i hated HP for that. </s>
<s> i was mad! </s>
<s> does anybody who has this computer had aor still has a freezing problem. </s>
<s> did HP do a recall of the computer i need to know. </s>
<s> I WANT MY MOMEY BACK!! </s>
<s> PLEASE RESPOND BACK! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Read the above posts^^^. </s>
<s> Probably why or you had spyware/adaware of which hp is not responsible. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> it wasnt spyware. </s>
<s> it was something to do with hardware. </s>
<s> i got the net a little ways after i had the computer. </s>
<s> and before the net the computer froze constantly. </s>
<s> and just returned it for another machine, and if the problem persists, maybe classaction lawsuit if you're smart? </s>
<s> or just get a refund and another machine? </s>
<s> Don't dwell in the past. </s>
<s> Most computers come with outdated drivers, it could've been something like modem drivers, keyboard drivers, bad memory (run memtest), just a defective machine in the batch. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> well when we thought about using the warrenty. </s>
<s> it was kinda laate . </s>
<s> and we had to travel from nassau [bahamas] to florida. </s>
<s> so it was kinda costly. </s>
<s> we already made two trips to get it repaired. </s>
<s> so we kinda made up our mind that we wont get another HP. </s>
<s> we will just stick to HP printers and scanners....[or at least i wanted too]. </s>
