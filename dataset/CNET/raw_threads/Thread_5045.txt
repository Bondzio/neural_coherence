When I want to record something I get a message (E:/ is not accessable) The icon in &quot;my computer shows&quot; it as a CD drive. The enternal DVD/CDR is listed as such in &quot;my Computer&quot; I have recorded on this drive a few months ago. I have had this problem in the past and did something that fixed the problem. I just can not remember what I did. The hardware properties list it as &quot;DVDRW USB16X USB Device&quot;. The make is a Magicspin. The model # is IDVD16DDBE. I am using it on a HP laptop. Any help would be nice. Mark
