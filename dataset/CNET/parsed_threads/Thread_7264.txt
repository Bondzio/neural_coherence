<s> Hi All, I would like to know if it is possible to get this setup to work? </s>
<s> I have a cable modem. </s>
<s> From the cable modem I go to a netgear hub. </s>
<s> From my hub, I connect one port to my router (which has two 2k PC's behind it: works great). </s>
<s> from another port on my hub I connect directly to a test PC I have set up (just a plain XP install with no data on it). </s>
<s> I would like this to be exposed to the internet. </s>
<s> The two PC's behind the router work fine. </s>
<s> It's the exposed PC that can't get an DHCP or DNS address. </s>
<s> Is this config possible or do I need a second ISP account for my XP box? </s>
<s> If push comes to shove I can put the XP box behind my router and add its IP address to the routers DMZ. </s>
<s> To me, this looks like it would accomplish what I'm trying to do. </s>
<s> Correct? </s>
<s> I'd still like to know if the first config is possible. </s>
<s> Thanks, Bruce Thanks, bruce </s>
<s> It's an invalid setup. </s>
<s> While once could buy another IP from the Cableco, no one will help you create invalid configurations. </s>
<s> Why do this since most routers have a DMZ entry? </s>
