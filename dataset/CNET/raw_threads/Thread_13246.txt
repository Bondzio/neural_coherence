I've always read where an upgrade should use the same size chips, but is it written in stone where I have to use 2 more 512s as opposed to dropping in 1 or 2 1GB chips to use with the 512s in there now? Or do I take the current 512s out & drop in 2, 3 or 4 1GB chips?

The things that are important are, to note where the &quot;duel channel&quot; slots are. It is recommended that you use the same speed and size when filling these slots. On the other hand, you do not have to match the RAM in the opposing channel. So Channel 1 could be 2x512 and channel 2 1gx2. But, why take the chance of spotty operation. At current RAM prices, you might as well match all the chips. As with any RAM upgrade, make sure you check the manufacters compatible RAM list. DDR2 is more strict when it comes to speed. For guaranteed reliability, (which is my motto) spend the extra $20. -BR

You need to verify just what the specs are for your system ram needs and if it's DDR2 capable. Once known you can buy similar ram sticks you already have -OR- increase ram amt. per stick to add to system present -OR- replace old ram with new larger ram amt. sticks. The DDR2 mode if used will better handle ram demands, however usually its demands proper ram slot placement. Also, the OS being used will limit the ram amount and/or ideal ram installable(search the forums here for topic). Review the manual or visit the system/mtrbd. support website. Visiting crucial.com or kingston.com should help in ram buying and getting ram info.
