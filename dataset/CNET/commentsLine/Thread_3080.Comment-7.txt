well thanks very much for the free coaching.
it worked.
duh, i forgot the ustair firewall!
now i have to remember to configure the firewall on the other downstaors comp.
well while i read every book i could find on home networking i never found a simple checklist, and i am no expert but this is what i did networking xp and 2k machines: 1) on each machine, create an identical username (that will exist as a username on each machine), with the same name and password.
(give this name admin rights) this user must have a password, but for wake onlan etc i have another username with no password be the default startup user, with no sign-in window.
all that matters is those common names and passwords just exist on all computers, they don;t have to be logged on apparently.
2) in win2k, use the network wizard (sytem/ network id) to create a workgroup name.
have each computer join this network (same name).
3 in windows explorer, under properties allow sharing.
use the window to turn the disk names to plain, not with $ sign as that makes it invisible.
4 allow access to ip addresses in all firewalls on all computers.
may not be totally correct but that's what worked i think.
never saw this simple list anywhere.
