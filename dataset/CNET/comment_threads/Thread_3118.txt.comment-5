That's why most companies have a sales department or a customer relations department in front of the IT/tech department.
So that they can take requirements from those who don't know the lingo (like me) and relay it to those who do.
I think throughout both of my posts, I did a great job explaining what I was trying to accomplish from a non-technical point of view.
If I knew all the terminology, I'd most likely know how to do this, which means I wouldn't be on this forum.
Thanks again bob for taking the time to respond...
I'll keep on searching
