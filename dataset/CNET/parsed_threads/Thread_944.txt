<s> I have just bought an external usb hard drive case that enables me to add in any ide hard drive. </s>
<s> Whenever I put in my 40gb maxtor hard drive it gets recognised instantly on my windows xp service pack 2 system. </s>
<s> However when I swap the drive to my IBM 120gb hard drive it does not even get shown in device manager. </s>
<s> I put the IBM drive in another system but attached directly to the internal ide cable and the drive works fine. </s>
<s> I then reformatted the IBM drive but it is still not recognised when I place it back into the usb case and attach it to my system. </s>
<s> I did try changing around the drive jumpers but nothing seems to work. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> The only cases I see have all but one setting. </s>
<s> It's cable select. </s>
<s> If your documention states otherwise, that would be a first or some very old unit. </s>
<s> The drive may not show in Explorer. </s>
<s> Try the disk management tool (Start, Help & Support if you can't find it.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The jumpers I were referring to were the ones on the hard drive itself. </s>
<s> But whatever setting I think they are ignored. </s>
<s> I can set the jumpers on my Maxtor drive to master, slave or cable select and it is always recognised. </s>
<s> I have tried the IBM drive on more than one computer within the USB case and it never gets recognised. </s>
<s> I can now only guess. </s>
<s> I wonder if its a capacity problem, incompatibility or some other obscure reason? </s>
<s> For instance the DRIVE MANAGEMENT tool? </s>
<s> Stick with cable select. </s>
<s> It's too bad you didn't supply the make and model of the case. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Apologies as I tried to post full details previously but closed my browser down too quickly. </s>
<s> Case is as in the link below: http://www.thetechzone.com/display.php?i=212&p=1 When I look under computer management then device manager and disk drives the IBM drive does not appear there. </s>
<s> However swapping over for the Maxtor drive and it appears under device manager ok. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The cable type appears to be 80 conductor IDE in the drive case. </s>
<s> That means to stick to CABLE SELECT. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You didn't look in the DISK MANAGEMENT you can find with Start, Help and Support. </s>
<s> It's fine you looked in the device manager, but do try the other. </s>
<s> It could be an older design case that didn't support that drive or the drive just doesn't work in that case. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes I did look in disk management it was one of the first things I checked but it does not appear there. </s>
<s> I phoned the tech support place this afternoon from where I purchased this product and the guy at the other said end seemed to think that my drive is not supported by the USB controller in external USB device. </s>
<s> Now if I had bought a car that was not able to drive on fast roads................................ </s>
