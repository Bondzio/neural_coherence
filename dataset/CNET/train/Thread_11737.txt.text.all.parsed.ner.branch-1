10304	3	110526	1256164	1256046	michael geist	6/21/05 6:49 pm	1.11937974e12	choose which router....	will be the access point, hard wire a pc to it and enter it's web based setup program. from here you have to see where the settings are that i referred to. if you mentioned the routers model numbers, further research can be done but until then i would be guessing.
