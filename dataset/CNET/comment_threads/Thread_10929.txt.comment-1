I just purchased a Dell laptop that came with a free 802.11G Netgear Router.
I currently have a Linksys 802.11b router with one wired desktop (windows 2000), 2 wireless desktops (one running xp - one 2000) and three laptops (XP).
My question is .. Do I need to get two netgear usb adapters to replace the linksys adapters or will they work with the new router( at the slower speed).
I figured I would ask before I start ripping everything apart and have no internet in the house.
thanks for any assistance jim
