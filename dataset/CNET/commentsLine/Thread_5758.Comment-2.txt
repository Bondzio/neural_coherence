the wired connection is some 100 megabit and even with every card updated that 108 megabit wireless connection is only theory and must be shared with all other wireless traffic.
some gamers won't do this.
on the other hand no one i know has 100 megabit connections to the internet so all that bandwidth is just buffer from here to there and won't really be felt (except by the most rabid gamers.)
i have no correct answer here but the kid connects over 802.11g (just 54 megabit) to a 20 buck di-524 from dlink.
yes they play online games but they don't complain.
