The Gateway is priced at $1199 w/o monotor. There is a difference in the two which may make a price difference. If the price is not out of line I personally would select the HP as it has the Pent 4 640 (P) HT 3.2GHz with the new 64-bit support (EM64T) with 2MB L2 cache and 300 GB 7200RPM Hard Drive. The Gateway has the Pent 4 550 HT with a slightly larger 3.4GHz, little less 1MB L2 cache and 250 GB 7200 RPM Hard Drive. The 5xx series do not have the 64-bit support. Dell also has a selection of computers with the Media Center system.
