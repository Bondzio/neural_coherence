Even in 0+1 where you have a mirror of RAID 0 (the mirror is the +1), this is ancient technology where it was de rigeur to backup when the Raid 0 failed and the +1 mirrow was still operating.
After that you would swap the drives around then reinitialise the array and restore from backup.
Only with the arrival of higher RAIDS (5 being notable) did we escape the backup, init, restore procedure.
You can research this on your own but I share from the time long ago in hopes to make it easier to swallow.
