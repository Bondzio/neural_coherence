1.1.1	I recently upgraded from 2K to XP Pro and all was well , for awhile .	St
1.1.2	The system started getting slower and slower and would lock up at times .	St
1.1.3	I would have to hit reset to get back up .	St
1.1.4	I ran all the necessary scans on the system and found nothing .	St
1.1.5	After a few more lockups , I took it to my shop thinking I had bad memory .	St
1.1.6	Changed to new memory and no change .	St
1.1.7	When turned on one time , I heard a & quot ; pop & quot ; in the area of the PS .	St
1.1.8	Installed new PS and no change in system performance .	St
1.1.9	Ran the Windows task mgr and under performance saw that CPU usage would spike to 95 % most of the time and I had nothing running .	St
1.1.10	I disconnected the network cbl and the usage dropped to 5 % MAX .	St
1.1.11	Everything worked fast again .	St
1.1.12	Put cbl back in and I was back to the same bad performance with 95 % + CPU usage when nothing was running .	St
1.1.13	I have reinstalled the XP upgrade several times with no change .	St
1.1.14	Thinking it might be the 10/100 adapter on the mobo , I put in a PCI card and disabled all the other adapters .	St
1.1.15	Same problem .	St
1.1.16	I am at a total loss here .	St
