The spec's are: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=us&docname=c00282472&dlc=en&product=446896&printable=yes&encodeUrl=true& I am wondering, is this computer worth being upgraded? Or should I build a new one? I am interested in using it for Gaming, browsing, listening to music, windows live messenger. Should I just buy a whole new PC or just build one. If so can you help me find a cheap setup? Thank you

Simply too small to adequately cool any of the improvements you would want to make. Start with a new case [under $60]. Best to buy one sans Power Supply and buy a separate supply that you verify has all the power needed as well as connectors needed for new mobos, videos etc. Very possible that your Dell doesn't even have a slot for a video card, which right there kills gaming. The FSB shows as 333 MHz which can't be upgraded without getting a new mobo. You don't want to get involved finding out if the Dell mobo is wired for a standard ATX V2 supply or pay an arm and a leg for one from them. Go to newegg and check prices. Yep you will have to buy a new Op Sys [XP Pro with SP2B, OEM CD from Newegg is $139. Home is $89].

About all I plan to salvage from my old Compaq is the case and even that will need some sheet metal work. Ever time I try and start a build (price it out) I find that buying a new OS (must be real and complete) causes the price to go up to the point I can buy for cheaper then I can build it. I usally stop and decide to live with what I have.

By using a top class motherboard and processor these parts will have a 3 year warranty. A 400W-500W power supply in a large ATX case for better airflow is needed to run a good video card. Use either a P4 or Athlon 64 motherboard with the latest socket size. Gaming computers need to be top of the line with at least 1 gig of Ram and a core 2 duo processor or dual core processor. You will not be able to build a cheap system if you want to play the latest games. Brand name computers are built to a price first and foremost,this is why a lot of them give trouble. The moment you cut corners on price you cut quality. If cost is a real problem forget using it for serious gaming and put your present system into a larger case with a 400W power supply and install a DVD R/RW so you can burn DVDs and add 2x512 of ram discarding the 256 stick (you may be able to trade it in if is lifetime warranty Ram). Doing this will be a cheap option that will improve your performance and allow you to play older games. With the adittion of a $300 video card more modern games can be played. Have fun colo39

And you've got that support on their websites, which nowadays is often a live chat. If you build your own, you run the risk of getting jipped and making mistakes that could cost you a lot of money. Computers nowadays aren't at all what they were 10 years ago. I don't mean that in the speed and technology sense, but in the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; sense too. Those complete brand name systems offer consumers a no hassle, no nonsense, high quality alternative to the run around and being shafted by people who just want your money. Compaq may have a faster video card, sound card, more memory, and faster chip for you on their web site that could cost you a lot less than a new computer.

The PCUser magazine, almost monthly set a set of criteria to build a desktop too and the larger computer shop builders always are superior and cheaper. Only occasionally do brand name desktops get anywhere near the selected criterior, that also includes price and performance. PC User magazine is the largest Computer Mag in Australia and is highly regarded within the Industry. Many Local computer shops are crooks here too, so by getting a desktop built to a PC uers specification can be the only safe way to build a system if you are not very computer savy. When you buy a desktop here you get much more detail as to what is inside than USA sites I have looked at. Good computer shops will give you a full 3 year hardware warranty as this is what good manufacturers give. A good shop will just replace any faulty parts and deal with the manufacturer for you. If components are sourced from a Chinese supplier direct, not a local agent this causes all the warranty problems. Our overall pricing is cheaper here than USA Our AU$ is worth 75 cents US. Overall computer salesman here are rated like car salesmen,not reliable and they tell lies. A good honest local techie is hard to find especialy if you know about computer hardware and cannot be bluffed and lied to. colo39
