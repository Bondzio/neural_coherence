Well, I have a Dell Inspiron 530 and I just swapped out a failing 250 gig hard drive with a new 1TB one.
I installed Windows Vista Home that came with my computer and the driver disk that came with my PC, but the Ethernet controller didn't install.
I downloaded a few of the drivers from the Dell website and tried them, and the sign isn't there anymore, BUT I still have the same problem as before, I can't fully connect to the internet.
The computer is connecting to a router via a Wireless-N Linksys adapter.
Perhaps the wrong driver installed?
I'd give you guys the model of the LAN card but I have no idea how to find it.
It's very frustrating and I know this same thing has been asked over and over and I've looked but I can't seem to find help.
