How do I format a SD memory card ( Erase all data) that keeps giving me a &quot;write protected&quot; Message.
This was a blank card to start with onto which I installed maps while in a Garmin GPS ( Not me, the card.).
I would like to change the configuration.
I've erased memory sticks before with no problems.
In other words I need to defeat the write protection.
