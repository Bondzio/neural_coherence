<s> I run both Leopard and Snow Leopard on Macs along with Windows using BootCamp. </s>
<s> I have tried the Magic Mouse, Logitech, and Microsoft mice and they all track slow while using the Mac OS. </s>
<s> The Logitech and Microsoft mice track fine with Windows. </s>
<s> Tracking speed is turned up to the max with the Mac OS. </s>

<s> If not, that could explain the slow tracking. </s>
<s> How is OS X with the mouse that came with the Mac, if there was one? </s>
<s> I wonder what sort of Mac and version of OS X you have. </s>

<s> There are two good driver programs. </s>
