Moved to a new place some weeks ago and didn't bother reconnecting the my home built computer.
Decided to replace my seasonic 550w power supply with a new 750w Antec EA-750 power supply.
I then reconnected my Viewsonic VX2025wm monitor and turned on the computer and got the dreaded &quot;no signal&quot; on the monitor.
Not only that, but my GTX 260 graphics card fan is really loud for some reason.
I tried a different monitor, a VX2433wm, on the computer and still got no signal on either of the DVI ports on the GTX 260.
I connected the VX2025wm monitor on my parents' Dell computer and it worked.
Could the new power supply have damaged my video card?
I have no idea whats going on!
