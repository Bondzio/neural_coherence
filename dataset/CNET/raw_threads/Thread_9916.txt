13756	0	99120	1135937	NR	bently	4/18/05 8:46 PM	1.11385716E12	problem with MS optical wireless mouse	Win XP home, sp2. Using a MS wireless optical mouse 2.0. A while back mouse started acting up like a ball mouse with ball not rolling. New batteries did not help. Suggestion was made to change mouse pad. I did, and mouse started working properly and continued to work properly until now.. NOW, mouse acting up again, and new batteries did not help. (This is a solid black rubber pad) Changed mouse pad again and now mouse working properly. Question... does anyone have any ideas why a mouse without a ball would act up like this? Thanks Ben
