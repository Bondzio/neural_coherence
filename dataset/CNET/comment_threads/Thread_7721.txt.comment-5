are all my backups of my home mpg and avi movies....I was wondering if I have NTSC and am copying the data files to another dvd media to send to my relatives overseas and they use PAL, will they be able to convert my data files to PAL so they can view them in a dvd player there since the two dvd players are from two different regions?
