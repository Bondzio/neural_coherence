First I tried with Windows 7, after the instalation it works but when I restart/shut down, it cant load again. The repair starts but can not find any errors and shuts it down.I thought that it has something to do with my OS, so I format and instaled XP.. Same happened.. It worked after the instalarion but when I shut it down and turn it off - in the begining of Windows loading it says &quot;Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \Windows\System32\Config\System.

Perhaps the circuitry is fried, and that's why it only appears sporadically. You weren't very clear about the error messages that Windows gives you. What exactly did it say? Also, what is X51L? I can't suggest much right now, but, if the drive turns out to be dead, you'll need to call the drive manufacturer (Toshiba, in your case).
