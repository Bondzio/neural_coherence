sometimes i switch my mouse and keyboard ps 2 plugs from one pc to another.
every time i move them from pc 1, when i go back and plug them into the sockets on the back of the pc, i have to uninstall then re install the ps2 drivers in device manager.
then, the mouse and keyboard will work well until the next time i remove them.
i know with the situation as it is, its best not to remove them, and i know there's always the usb option.
i am curious though as to why i have to repeatedly unistall then re install the drivers.
its a bit of a pain to have to do again and again.
any thoughts?
thanks.
