well, i have a wireless 2wire dsl modem and sbc yahoo internet service.
i have a computer wirelessly connected with a wireless card to it.
now, everything was fine for a few weeks of downloading and whatnot.
yet around last week, the broadband link light would start flashing amber for several seconds, then go back to green for several seconds, then go back to flashing amber.
it didn't seem to effect anything, so i ignored it.
yet several days later, i noticed it was doing it again, and that time the internet stopped working until i turned off the wirelessly connected computer.
does anyone know exactly what that flashing amber light signifies?
and how i get it to stop flashing so?
is there possibly a download or upload limit imposed on sbc yahoo service, and if so how can i find out?
any help would be greatly appreciated.
