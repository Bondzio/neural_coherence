i am also experiencing the same prob.
however, i must state my prob is to do with vista as i have another pc on xp sp2.
it is working perfectly.
my prob is that on the vista machine, the driver keepds disappearing.
i have loaded, several times, from the disk that came with the machine.
on some occasions, it will load okay and i can print without a prob.
once i switch the machine off and on again and try printing, the drivers would have disappeared.
on some occassions, the drivers just wont load.
the following error message comes up: &quot;an error has been encountered ......&quot; no specifics, no error codes.
have contacted hp by email, just the auto reply promising that a technician would contact me.
that was 3 mnths back.
please help.
