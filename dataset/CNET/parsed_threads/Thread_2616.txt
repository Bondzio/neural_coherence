<s> Can a bigger size hard drive, e.g.-2tb 16mb cache, & cache make an operating system,e.g.-windows xp, boot-up & multi-task faster? </s>
<s> In-other words, make a system's O.S. </s>
<s> more efficiently faster? </s>
<s> What other specs make a h.d. </s>
<s> faster? </s>
<s> Theoretically, more cache and higher speed of rotation improve HD performance. </s>
<s> SATA 3 is common and SATA 6 is just out. </s>
<s> It should provide some improvements over SATA 3. </s>
<s> SCSI seems to still take the prize with platter type devices. </s>
<s> Solid state HDs didn't offer much (if any) improvement over platter types initially but are gaining ground. </s>
<s> All I know is what I read and all I told is only what I've read so take it with a grain of salt. </s>
<s> SEEK TIME is often in the several MILLISECOND range which is an eternity in computer time. </s>
<s> Compare a 5 millisecond seek to the 6 millisecond seek and you soon discover that buffers pale in comparison to payback. </s>

<s> You might want to scan the drive for errors, defragment it, move most used programs to the inner tracks and see if the manufacturer has any utilities such as ones that lengthen the timeout, etc. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> How the heck do you do that? </s>
<s> I had no idea you can control where a program is placed on the HDD! </s>
<s> In terms of pure speed, it's my belief that a smaller drive, with high rotational speed, a large cache and high seek times would suit your purpose. </s>
<s> Put simply, the less there is to look through the faster you accomplish the find. </s>
<s> With the rotational speed and low seek times once you've looked up what you want the quicker that happens. </s>
<s> Overall though, a small (60GB ish) solid state disk is the speediest option. </s>
<s> Apart from the most specialised HDD none beat them as they operate at almost teh speed of memory. </s>
<s> HTH </s>
<s> sorry, meant to say LOW seek times! </s>
