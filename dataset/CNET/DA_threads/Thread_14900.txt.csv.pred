1.2.1	Windows 2000 rarely can be used with such without motherboard and maybe USB drivers .	St
1.2.2	Said drivers are not on the 2000 CD , any button you push on the OS ( Driver update ) or from Xerox .	St
1.2.3	I 'm seeing far too many posts in which it seems everyone has forgotten how to install Windows .	St
1.2.4	Not meant as an offense , but you did n't reveal much about the OS install .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
