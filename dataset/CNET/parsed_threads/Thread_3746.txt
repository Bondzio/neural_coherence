<s> Hello, I recently changed some user policy options when I was told I didn't have admin rights upon trying to run a game. </s>
<s> I clicked onto user accounts and I am the only user and am a computer administrator. </s>
<s> I changed the policy so I and only I have access to everything. </s>
<s> That created a problem, for the last three years I have only had to press enter or escape at the login screen and therefore have not needed to enter a password. </s>
<s> Now it says the policy of this machine does not allow you to log on interactively. </s>
<s> So I downloaded ophcrack which you boot from CD upon startup to crack your password. </s>
<s> I have changed the BIOS settings accordingly but I get this message when selecting CD at the boot options screens boot device not available. </s>
<s> My DVD drive barely opens, it cannot write just read and makes creaking noises and a LOT of noise like a fan. </s>
<s> I tried the CD in the PC I'm typing from now and it seems to run fine, in the broken PC it does the noise where a CD is being loaded and then slows down a lot like revving a car engine, builds up then down. </s>
<s> I have not tried loading the CD on my other PC as I don't want to change the BIOS settings but I think it may work. </s>
<s> So, is it the DVD ROM drive that is at fault? </s>
<s> Dell precision 470 Windows Pro SP3 5 years old or so, has had parts break before. </s>
<s> If any of you have had boot device not available and fixed it through replacing the DVD drive let me know as I am locked out of my own computer and want this solved quickly but don't want to go buying anything which won't solve the issue! </s>
<s> Lastly, which DVD drive is compatible with my Dell Precision 470? </s>
<s> Dante. </s>
<s> Eliminate the widoze side and just get a &quot;live version of Linux&quot;, like Ubuntu. </s>
<s> You can use any Linux as long as it a live version which runs from the CD alone. </s>
<s> Burn the .ISO image properly to the CD/DVD and be sure the bios has CD drive as 1st boot device and then power-ON or reboot the PC. </s>
<s> That way, you can test the CD drive alone and allow it to complete its boot. </s>
<s> If the CD does boot but is a proper working bootable disc, then the CD drive is bad in some way. </s>
<s> You should try the bootable disc on another PC to verify it works. </s>
<s> If it works, etc., on the problem PC, then the windoze is hosed somehow. </s>
<s> Since, this is XP, you can try the &quot;repair option&quot; from the windoze disc. </s>
<s> Since you mention some &quot;crack&quot; s/w I just hope you don't have other issues at work here. </s>
<s> No matter what you think, you need to verify the PC is clean, so AV scan or any other malware detection pgm. </s>
<s> should be used. </s>
<s> Hopefully, you can boot into &quot;safe mode&quot; and try using networking option as well and then use either CD disc(another test) or USB flash drive with scanning/malware s/w in order to scan your system. </s>
<s> In most cases just to save time and effort, just get a new drive and install. </s>
<s> More often than not, the drive is kaput at 5yrs. </s>
<s> old will often be the case. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted, flaky operation is a sign of old age and/or weak components, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
