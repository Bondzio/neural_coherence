<s> Hi: I've got a friend who wants to set up a wireless network at home, the thing is he is already using a wired modem/router with 4 ports. </s>
<s> so im wondering to set up a wireless network, is the best option just to buy a wireless modem/router and replace the wired one? </s>
<s> or is it possible to get a wireless router only and use that with the wired modem/router? </s>
<s> if it's possible, how would I go about doing that? </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> You could add a Wireless Access Point -- but a used wireless router is a lot cheaper and ex-ISP models turn up all the time due to customer churn. </s>
<s> Obviously to replace the existing router you'll need to apply the right settings to match your ISP's requirements -- see their home site for any help files on how to set up common brands of router. </s>
<s> If you get a used ex-ISP wireless router and find it is locked to an ISP just add it as a WAP to the existing router --- see following link: http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101496.asp </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice </s>
