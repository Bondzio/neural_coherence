It does sound as if the cpu is still overheating.
I would reinstall the cpu, being very careful that the thermal paste is applied properly.
A thin even coat of paste is required.
Some use a single edged razor blade to apply the paste.
The paste should be just thick enough that you can't see through it.
If it is applied too thick or too thin, you can get undesirable results.
Best of Luck
