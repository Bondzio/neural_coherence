<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> I have just bought a SONY VAIO NR38M and as soon as I turn the wireless function switch on the front to 'on' it makes my WRT54GS wireless router restart over and over. </s>
<s> It does this every 20 seconds while the wireless is activated!! </s>
<s> I checked my PS3 (connected via it's wireless function) and my old laptop (that has a Belkin USB wireless adaptor) to see if they were going to affect my router, but they never did before and still don't! </s>
<s> The baffling thing is, that I bought the vaio 3 days ago and it's only just started doing it! </s>
<s> As soon as I got home and started it up it connected fine, but the past 24 hours it has started to have this effect on the wireless router! </s>
<s> I have tried power-cycling, but this had no effect. </s>
<s> Please can anyone help?!? </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> setting up your wireless router like the Forum Sticky suggests? </s>

<s> We've seen that. </s>
<s> The router firmware was too old. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've updated my router's firmware and unfortunately this has made no difference! </s>
<s> The laptop/router works fine if I connect using an ethernet cable, so it's something to do with the vaio's wireless!! </s>
<s> !......I'm clueless! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> If the firmware didn't cure it, try another make router. </s>
<s> For a test, head to a free wifi hot spot. </s>
<s> And yes, it has something to do with the Vaio but as you can guess it's been discussed and no router should crash on such a connection. </s>
<s> If the router crashes then you are proving the bug in the router. </s>

<s> Well, I'm pretty sure you're right with the router bug idea. </s>
<s> My neighbour has a different make router (netgear) and he's given me the pass code to access it, and it connects straight away and there are no problems with router! </s>
<s> I'm able to use his wireless perfectly!! </s>
<s> Well, off to the shop I'll be going for a new router! </s>
<s> Think I'll get a netgear one too as this seems to work ok! </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Sorry for the late idea but not all WRT54GS can run OpenWRT but it does solve the problem. </s>

<s> Hi, thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, as you said, not all WRT54GS can be used and mine is one of them! </s>
<s> As it appears my version (version 6) cannot be used! </s>
<s> Looks like a new router then! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> The routers I installed OpenWrt on are stable, just fade into the closet and never need attention. </s>
<s> These are only slightly harder to configure but so far worth the effort if you have to gumption. </s>
