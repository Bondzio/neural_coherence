1.1.1	It appears the 3Tb HD is here .	St
1.1.2	WD , is offering it as a & quot ; bootable & quot ; one that being the major point .	St
1.1.3	You need to have these requirements in order to use it .	St
1.1.4	1 ) 64-bit OS 2 ) UEFI and GPT partitioning If you system needs it , WD will provide a small PCB card in order to better i/f the HD for compatibility .	St
1.1.5	The 64-bit OS is very important as it addresses the capacity or volume issue , as 2.19Tb is the limit for 32-bit OS , thus the 64-bit OS need .	St
1.1.6	There are other 3Tb out there but it seems the WD offered one is bootable , other will be storage only .	St
1.1.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.2.1	I do n't think there 's much advantage of using a large capacity harddrive like that .	St
1.2.2	Personally , I rather use 6-500G .	St
1.2.3	or 3-1T instead ( especially if the price comparison is about the same or not too much higher ) .	St
1.3.1	To each their own decision .	St
1.3.2	But , let 's be clear here , there are many users of 500gb , and 1Tb now HDs .	St
1.3.3	You 're own answer offered 3x1Tb as a solution , I 'm sure for others it 'll be a 3Tb HD .	St
1.3.4	As time goes by , while fairly common now , 1Tb is already starting to give way to 2Tb and that was n't too long ago , some pie in the sky .	St
1.3.5	While on the subject , persistent releases of SSD 's are qrowing as well .	St
1.3.6	So , a typical current 250gb HD maybe replaced by a 250gb SSD as costs go down .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
