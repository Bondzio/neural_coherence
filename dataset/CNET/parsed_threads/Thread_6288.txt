<s> Hello all, I have recently purchased an enclosure and hard drive. </s>
<s> it was working fine for a good while. </s>
<s> i formatted the drive into a logical FAT32 drive to back up my ps3 files. </s>
<s> i then selected to use &quot;safely remove hardware&quot;. </s>
<s> it said it was ok to remove. </s>
<s> and now my PS3 nor computer recognizes it. </s>
<s> not shown anywhere. </s>
<s> the light comes on on the enclosure and i can hear the disks spinning but nothing. </s>
<s> i replaced the hard drive just in case and still nothing. </s>
<s> can anyone offer any suggestions to fix this? </s>
<s> the I am using Vista 32 SP2. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> i also tested this on different ports and did not work. </s>
<s> this port works since it recognized my external mouse. </s>
<s> i found out my usb cord was bad ! </s>
