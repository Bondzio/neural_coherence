1.1.1	I will be building my first complete system soon and this is what i was looking at...anyone see any problems with this configuration???	St
1.1.2	am i forgetting anything?	St
1.1.3	CPU: Intel Pentium 4/ 3.2E GHz 800MHz FSB, 1MB L2 Cache, Hyper Threading Technology (Item# N82E16819116172)$223.00 MB: ASUS &quot;P4C800-E DELUXE&quot; i875P Chipset (Item# N82E16813131464)$179.00 Case: KINGWIN Black Aluminum 10-Bay Mid-Tower Case with a Large Side Window (Item# N82E16811170012)$91.50 PSU: Aspire 520W 12V Black Triple Fan Aluminum Power Supply (Item# N82E16817148008)$56.00 RAM: Corsair Value Select 184 Pin 512MB DDR PC-3200 (Item# N82E16820145026)$70.27 HD: Western Digital Raptor 74GB 10,000RPM SATA (Item# N82E16822144160)$176.00 CD/DVD: Pioneer Black DVD+RW/-RW Drive (Item# N82E16827129157)$75.99 Floppy: SONY Black 1.44MB 3.5inch Floppy Disk Drive (Item# N82E16821103116)$6.99 Video: still deciding OS: Microsoft Windows XP HOME Edition With Service Pack 2 -OEM $91.00 CPU Paste: Arctic Silver Premium High-Density Thermal Compound *i also have two ide hd's (80g & 120g) which i will be adding at least one of to the new system and a 52X cd-rw that i will add as well... thanks for the help.	St
1.2.1	Keyboard?	St
1.2.2	Mouse?	St
1.2.3	Monitor?	St
1.2.4	Seriously: How about extra cooling fans, at least for the 10K rpm sata Drive?	St
1.3.1	i have the keyboard, mouse, and monitor already from the old system, and that is the 10K SATA hdd... the case comes with 3 80mm fans...not enough?	St
1.3.2	?	Ques
1.4.1	You forgot the Athlon 64 processor.	St
1.4.2	Skip the Pentium 4, and use an Athlon 64 instead.	St
1.5.1	I have 2 raptors and they actually run cooler than my other 7200 rpm drives.	St
1.6.1	I consider getting a +/- dual layer DVD-RW that way you use two sided disk which has 9 gig's of space.	St
1.6.2	With the + only burner you lock into + media only.	St
1.7.1	Pentiums are just fast with crap performance but a Athlon has great performance and is fast.go for the 64 Bit system.	St
1.7.2	as for the video go for one of the 6800 from Nvidia, afterall that will future proof the system.	St
1.8.1	I have been running amd ever since i own my first computer and they are awesome especcially for the price, but the memory i would lookinto dual ddr with 1 gb kit or 2 gb kit, i am running the 512 mb kit, and i wish i have bought more, i have been looking into rebuilding my amd system and going 64 bit with a 3500+ cpu and getting the ASUS A8V board or ASUS A8N-SLI which has the pci express on it, anybody think of anything different let me know Tony	St
1.9.1	I didn't see a sound card on the list	St
1.10.1	I would go with a Antec true power , power supply instead.	St
1.11.1	Firstly, the subject of which processor is a personal one so ignore advice to switch processors to an amd 64 as you will need to change the mainboard also.	St
1.11.2	I am a technician with 20 years experience and swear by Intel processors, ok, Intel are struggling at the moment with the process of the latest chips but they do deliver the goods when it comes down to it.	St
1.11.3	Secondly, the board you list will require a bios upgrade to at least version 1017 available from the Asus website.	St
1.11.4	It's been my experience that sometimes a board will boot up ok before the upgrade but equally you may find that it will not.	St
1.11.5	It is worth bearing in mind that the board you recieve may already have a later bios revision installed and would therefore be ok. Just something to take into account.	St
1.11.6	Best of luck fella	Polite
1.12.1	While a turtle is slow, a Turtle Beach soundcard is not.	St
1.12.2	I do home recording and was astounded at the prices for some of the higher end soundcards.	St
1.12.3	I've been recording professionally since 1968 so I was going to bite the bullet and plunk down $300 plus for a proline soundcard, then I talked to an audio engineer at a radio station where I was working about the sound cards he's used.	St
1.12.4	He never hesitated and said Turtle Beach.	St
1.12.5	First decide on the speaker layout you want.	St
1.12.6	Turtle Beach has cards specially designed for 5.1, 6.1 and 7.1 configurations.	St
1.12.7	I got the 6.1 Catalina card and couldn't be happier.	St
1.12.8	I saved at least $350 over what I was planning to pay.	St
1.12.9	Their support is ok too.	St
1.12.10	The difference between on board/integrated audio and a Turtle Beach sound card was like night and day.	St
1.12.11	Prices vary from 40 to 60 dollars on the Catalina 6.1.	St
1.12.12	I could not be happier!	St
1.12.13	Far cheaper than a Sound Blaster and sounds great, especially for recording!	St
1.12.14	Your prices seemed a little high on some of the items.	St
1.12.15	Check around.	St
1.12.16	I also prefer the Enermax power supplies personally.	St
1.12.17	They are well made, durable and reasonably priced.	St
1.12.18	Don't skimp on power as that is often a weak link!	St
1.12.19	Another thing, especially for a system with a side window, you'll need cable ties.	St
1.12.20	You can get them at radio shack.	St
1.12.21	They help to pretty up the view through case window and they help routing the cables to improve airflow.	St
1.12.22	Regarding airflow, shop around for some of the round drive cables and use them instead of the flat ribbon drive cables.	St
1.12.23	The online auction sites have hundreds listed and they are far cheaper than at a computer store.	St
1.12.24	They also look nice on a case with a side window and some can actually improve performance I am told.	St
1.12.25	If you are using three fans or more, you might want to look into a fan controller like a Thermaltake x-controller.	St
1.12.26	Which runs about 15 to 20 dollars.	St
1.12.27	They also make one like the one I use with a built in temperature display and temperature alarm which is a handy safeguard to have.	St
1.12.28	Good Luck!	St
1.13.1	I personally would prefer a AMD processer and I would make sure the PSU is one of the best today.	St
1.13.2	Also I would use a DVD double sided burner.	St
1.13.3	I prefer Asus motherboard's myself.	St
1.13.4	Looks like a good choice for everything else.	St
1.14.1	If you add an ASUS 'Radeon' Graphics Card (128Mb) and an ATEC 18.1&quot; LCD Monitor you will have exactly the setup which I built a year ago.	St
1.14.2	I would advise that the system is vastly better since I added extra RAM (now up to 1.5Gb).	St
1.14.3	You will be great with what you propose the motherboard flies !	St
1.14.4	!	St
1.15.1	I agree with jr8crew, you should probably get more RAM.	St
1.15.2	And, the AMD 64 bit processor might give better performance than the P4.	St
1.16.1	I'm about to build my 6th computer....and I'll be using the AMD 64 (3800+ or the FX-55* - not sure which yet) as well.	St
1.16.2	I've been using AMD's for the last 3 computers, and LOVE them.	St
1.16.3	I'll probably never use an Intel again.	St
1.16.4	*The FX-55 was released not long ago - most online sites still list the FX-53.	St
1.16.5	Enjoy,	St
1.17.1	I have worked on my own computers since my Apple IIc.	St
1.17.2	I have had Pentiums and Athlons.	St
1.17.3	Both are well done as Karl says, but the AMD 64 with be able to support 64 bit progs TODAY.	St
1.17.4	That means - Build today and NOT have to upgrade the motherboard and proccesser for MANY YEARS.	St
1.17.5	As far as the motherboard, you can often find great boards for EITHER proccesser at the same prices and same configurations.	St
1.17.6	MY OPINION is the AMD, but it IS your choice.	St
1.17.7	Enjoy,	St
1.18.1	One of the first things I ask is what is the purpose of the machine?	St
1.18.2	Media center - audio/video editting or playback.	St
1.18.3	For editting, you may need more/faster memory and more HDD space.	St
1.18.4	For playback, maybe the WinXP Media Center.	St
1.18.5	Numerical processing - large, extensive spreadsheets, more memory.	St
1.18.6	Game machine - AMD 64 bit, for the price.	St
1.18.7	Heat in the case and CPU, try water cooling.	St
1.18.8	Adding an additional IDE controller (for the spare 80GB and 120GB) lets you add 4 additional IDE devices (CD/DVD) of different IDE speeds Also, where are you backing up your files?	St
1.18.9	Tape, HDD, CD/DVD, or online?	St
1.19.1	I think you will get a lot more for your money using a AMD 64 cpu.	St
1.19.2	most computer hobbiest and gamers use them because they preform better and will be compatable with Windows XP 64. for video just get the board that works best with the prime application you will be using.	St
1.20.1	Make sure the card you get has onboard DSP so it can offload effects processing from the cpu.	St
1.21.1	One the most important things in a system, is the operating system, I will put Windows XP Profesional, service pack II.	St
1.22.1	As for your video depending on the type of applications and games I would recommend the All in Womder X800 XT video card.	St
1.22.2	You kill several birds with one stone as they say.Also if your stuck on P4,Try the Gigabyte Motherboard GA-81PE100-G .This is a lot of Bang for the Buck.	St
1.22.3	I am using it now.	St
1.22.4	One more suggestion scrap the pioneer and get a plextor px-716SA.	St
1.22.5	I did .	St
1.22.6	More compatable with other drives and all types of material.Just my 2 cents form my own experience.	St
1.22.7	Matt	St
1.23.1	I just completed building my 3rd computer and I wanted to run two seperate DVD/CD combo Drives,because of compatabilty with the different types of material.	St
1.23.2	I tried the Pioneer 108, NEC 3500,and Plextor PX-712A.	St
1.23.3	The problem was compatability.	St
1.23.4	NEC and Pioneer did not like each other.	St
1.23.5	The Plextor was compatabile with all especially when it came to the material.Now I added the new Px716SA Serial and all I can Say is WOW.	St
1.23.6	The speed is Fantastic.	St
1.23.7	Just My 2 Cents.	St
1.23.8	Matt	St
1.24.1	I have run both and I will say that I find that the Intel based systems seem to be more stable for applications and Video/Audio Production and that the AMD's seem to run Games a bit better.	St
1.24.2	Also the AMD's Run Hotter than the Intel's so there is a trade off there as well.	St
1.24.3	I would at least go with a 1GB of Dual Channel RAM from either OCX or Kingston and if you can afford to spend a little more get the HYPER-X.	St
1.24.4	As far as Video goes you cannot go wrong with either ATI or Nvidia they are both Awsome Cards.	St
1.24.5	What you have to really decided is what you are going to be doing with the system.	St
1.24.6	If you are going to only play games on it then I would consider the AMD.	St
1.24.7	However if you are going to do allot of applicatoions, Audio, Video, and various other thigs besides Games then stick with the Intel Processor.	St
1.24.8	Allot of Software people write special code in the software that only takes advantage of Intel's core processor.	St
1.25.1	Sounds good, as long as everything is compatible.	St
1.25.2	Make sure you have at least 2 or 3 fans to keep the processor from overheating.	St
1.25.3	As long as you have all the external peripheals (i.e.	St
1.25.4	mouse, keyboard, etc.)	St
1.25.5	sounds like your ready to go!	St
1.25.6	Watch out for static electricity!	St
1.26.1	You have most of the the exact components that I put in my new PC earlier this year.	St
1.26.2	After reading through all the respnses, there are three that really need even more emphasis.	St
1.26.3	PLEXTOR for the DVD/RW.	St
1.26.4	Rounded cables for connections.	St
1.26.5	XP Pro for the OS.	St
1.26.6	And one additional suggestion, since you have a good looking case with a window in the side, go for the Corsair Pro series RAM.	St
1.26.7	They have LEDs on the edge that light up as the RAM is being accessed.	St
1.26.8	It doesn't do anything for the performance, but if you are building a macine with a window in the side you care about more than just performance.	St
1.27.1	Don't agree with all the AMD posts.	St
1.27.2	I had a system built with a P4 and the store building it kept trying to talk me into a AMD chip.	St
1.27.3	I stood my ground and they were amazed with the results.	St
1.27.4	I've since built three others myself all with P4 chips and couldn't be more happy.	St
1.28.1	I'd suggest three things, perhaps four.	St
1.28.2	RAM: 512mb is sort of a minimum standard these days.	St
1.28.3	Computer programs are getting longer and longer.	St
1.28.4	If you download music as many do, the download goes into RAM before it is transcribed onto your hard disk and CD/DVD.	St
1.28.5	I'd up it to 1 gigabytes and perhaps more depending upon your planned use and you will never (never say never) get an out of memory or a dumped CD/DVD disk.	St
1.28.6	Hard Disk: Hard disk space is one of the least expensive commodities.	St
1.28.7	Music, video, pictures use a lot of space.	St
1.28.8	My Sony VIAO multimedia machine came with 250 gigabytes of storage.	St
1.28.9	If you are just gaming, 80 is probably enough.	St
1.28.10	DVD/CD drive: I'd add another CD drive so that you can copy from CD's directly rather than having to go through RAM for storage and the recording onto the new disk.	St
1.28.11	Video CARD: If you are gaming, doing a lot of photo's or need a high resolution go for an 8X 256mb card.	St
1.28.12	This is where your video speed and high picture resolution come from.	St
1.28.13	Finally, you monitor: I'd choose a minimum of 1280 x 1056 pixel rating monitorand maybe even a 1600 x 1200 display.	St
1.28.14	You can't use all your computing power if you can't see all of it on a single screen (or have to use the slider bars to move the picture around so that you can see all of the frame).	St
1.28.15	LCD screens are nice but flat glass displays are providing the greatest resolution, especially the industrial strength monitors used for CAD/CAM and medical applications.	St
1.28.16	That said: Good luck, have fun, save a little money from buying a custom build, and do let us know what you do and what the end results are.	St
1.28.17	Paul Rogers, Honolulu	St
1.29.1	Wow you guys have given excellent advise to the subject...all of you have overlooked one major area... the Operating System...Are you sure you want to go with the XP Home...My feeling is that you should opt for the extra expense and go with the XP Pro with the SP1...you may not like all the extra hassles that the SP2 brings with it...if after the build you decide you want to try the SP2 you can get a free upgrade CD from Microsoft then if you decide you don't like the SP2 or you have software that isn't compatable with SP2 you can do a simple System restore and be rid of the SP2...Here is the url... http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/sp2/cdorder/en_us/default.mspx Microsoft says allow 4 to 6 weeks for delivery but i received mine in less than a week... You may have a hard time finding XP Pro SP1 but i found it at SuperDealOnline url... http://atl.aitweb.net/cgi-bin/ait-detail.asp?product_no=646&menu_no=11 for 126.00... Then what about a Firewall and Virus protection...Well good building and enjoy &quot;Cy&quot; in Denver	St
1.30.1	Nope, it looks like you have everything in order, except what you are using for a video card, and a sound card.	St
1.30.2	As far as the OS is concerned, I am a avid Linux user, preferrably Debian, however if your not comfortable going into that arena, may I suggest using XP Professional instead of using the Home edition.	St
1.30.3	Home edition still carries some of the flakiness that ME had about it.	St
1.30.4	It's a good idea to know what you are going to use the machine for, that way you know what type of computer you are going to build.	St
1.31.1	What you are describing is not bad, but you need to remember if you are going to do alot of gaming you may want to boost your ram, also I would but a external Floppy drive with USB.	St
1.31.2	Floppy aren't use that much now a days, and will eventually be fully replaced by USB memory cards.	St
1.31.3	You did't mention your USB functionality.	St
1.31.4	I would make sure you have Four back, two front if you are going to use headphones and mike.	St
1.31.5	I would get a USB hub to plug your printer, scanner, mouse and keyboard in.	St
1.31.6	On the cd rw: if you already have it, good, but if you are going to go out and buy one I would spend a little more and get another Pioneer Black DVD+RW/-RW Drive (Item# N82E16827129157.	St
1.31.7	DVD is going to be your best combatibilty for you symtem in that you won't have to up grade hardware as soon, and have more versitility in burning and copying.	St
1.31.8	The need for speed on burning is not always the way to go, you can get more error burns and wear out your DVD/CD burner faster at the higher speeds.	St
1.31.9	On your video card, don't skimp on that.	St
1.31.10	Your best bet is a Nvidia vedeo card if you are going midrange quality, they have less conflicts with XP Home SP2.	St
1.31.11	Other video cards have conflicts unless you go with their extreme high end video cards.	St
1.31.12	It also depends on if you are going to do a lot of gaming.	St
1.31.13	If so , there are some excellent choices out there in the $200 to $300 range.	St
1.31.14	On your power supply, the triple fans are nice, but gives you more to wear out.	St
1.31.15	Go with a 4&quot; single fan and add one or two cooling fans to your box.	St
1.31.16	Keep the same wattage.	St
1.31.17	I would keep one of your other harddrives out and get a external case for it to make it an external hard drive for backing up your system and keeping it seperate from the PC.	St
1.31.18	You can hook that one up using USB connections.	St
1.31.19	These are some ideas I used on other PC's that I built after my 1st attempt.	St
1.31.20	When you decide to get started make sure you have a static free enviroment.	St
1.31.21	Make sure you discharge any static you built up into a metal desk or table that you have near your work area.	St
1.31.22	Steel rod will also work.	St
1.31.23	Make sure after you have it built that you tweek your settings and go to all your hardware sites and download their most current drivers.	St
1.31.24	Don't rely on windows update to do this because they don't always have the most current drivers.	St
1.31.25	Make sure you have the most current Bios also.	St
1.31.26	If you are going to be internet active, don't forget to get a good anti virus, firewall, antispam, Ad popup blocker.	St
1.31.27	I hope this gives you some different perspective and helps you think of some things you hadn't thought of.	St
1.32.1	I agree with some other posts.	St
1.32.2	If you are using Windows XP, within a range of CPU (rated) speeds, you will always get better performance with more RAM versus faster processor speed.	St
1.32.3	E.g.	St
1.32.4	a 2.8 GHz CPU with 1, 1.5, or 2 GB RAM will outperform a 3.0, 3.2, etc.	St
1.32.5	CPU with .5 GB RAM.	St
1.32.6	Don't know whether it's true with Linux, Unix, Mac OS, etc.	St
1.32.7	- maybe someone has benchmarks - and I assume it's equally true for AMD CPUs which generally kick ass when running in similar systems compared with an Intel CPU.	St
1.33.1	You are getting an 800MHz chip, and the chipset supports this.	St
1.33.2	But the RAM limitation is 400MHz FSB speed on the board.	St
1.33.3	I would look for a board that will be compatible with 800MHz FSB speed for the RAM as well.	St
1.33.4	What this boils down to is that you are limiting your computer to 400MHZ front side bus speed because of the RAM limitation on the board.	St
1.33.5	Your computer is only as fast as your RAM can be.	St
1.33.6	ASUS and MSI boards are among the top choices.	St
1.33.7	Since you have chosen top-of-the-line processor AND motherboard, get top-of-the-line RAM and not &quot;value price&quot;.	St
1.33.8	I have had 2 Western Digital hard drives go out.	St
1.33.9	Now, all 4 of my computers have Maxtor hard drives.	St
1.33.10	My 40 Gb is 5 years old and still running strong!	St
1.33.11	I have used a computer with Home, and my personal computer has the Professional edition.	St
1.33.12	I prefer the Professional edition over the Home edition.	St
1.33.13	There are a lot of reasons behind this, so do some more homework on the differences.	St
1.33.14	Safety reasons are mostly why I went with the XP Pro edition.	St
1.33.15	In a recent article comparison of N-Vidia and ATI video cards, ATI is still top of the line.	St
1.33.16	I am running an ATI 256Mg video card and it kicks as*.	St
1.33.17	My first pick was N-Vidia for price, but had to send it back due to faulty capacitors!	St
1.33.18	Of course, if this computer is for minor things and not gaming, graphics design or movie production, then what you have chosen should be fine.	St
1.33.19	I hope you find this info helpful and enlightening.	St
1.33.20	Joyce P.S.	St
1.33.21	here are the specs on the comp I use most: Athlon XP 1.09 Gig processor (400MHz FSB speed) MSI motherboard with N-Vidia nforce2 chipset (400MHZ FSB speed) ATI 9600 series 256Mb video card Maxtor 120 Gig as master drive Maxtor 40 Gig as slave drive 2 512Mb Kingston DDR400 Ram (400MHz FSB speed) DVD drive CD-RW drive floppy drive zip drive	St
1.34.1	Go for it lad!	St
1.34.2	it looks to me like you've got the right stuff, I can't see anything you've missed!	St
1.35.1	You might consider some supplemental cooling for the CPU be it a fan, case cooler, or what have you.	St
1.35.2	Flatlander7089	St
1.36.1	The 10,000 rpm WD SATA hard drive is nice, but for around $125 from New Egg you can get a 200 gb Seagate SATA 7200 rpm drive that from my experience is as fast as a Western Digital 10,000 rpm drive, with more than double the storage.	St
1.36.2	If you really want more drive performance, get 2 Seagate drives and raid them.	St
1.36.3	But also, XP Pro with 2 gig ram is the way to go.	St
1.37.1	i've heard this before and i really don't play games so i'm fine with intel (it's what i've alway run and i don't see any reason to switch unless there is a major price difference)... as for the memory i will definatly be adding more at some point, but will have to start of with 512 for $ reasons...	St
1.38.1	NIL	St
1.39.1	why do i need to back up my files???	Ques
1.39.2	i'll be using my current HDD's in my new setup...	St
1.40.1	Back up!	St
1.40.2	You need to back-up because you should do a clean install with win XP.	St
1.40.3	Also make sure you have copies of all other apps.	Sug
1.40.4	you want to install as some may need updates with win XP.Make sure you do a complete scan on your system before B-Up to make sure you don't transfer crap to your new sys.	St
1.40.5	Checkout prices on outpost.com for savings or any of the internet shoping sites.	St
1.41.1	just out of curiosity, why?	St
1.41.2	i'll be upgrading from 98se to xp anyway...should i reformat the hdd reinstall 98 and then install the xp upgrade?	St
1.41.3	is there a particular reason for doing this?	St
1.41.4	if this is the case i'll just transfer all my files to my second hdd...	St
1.42.1	well it looks like it's gonna be mid jan. before i'll be starting this and i've made a few changes for financial reasons.	St

1.42.3	tube 4.49 total 752.99 there are a few things i'd like to add (like a dvd burner) that will have to wait for now...my currently pc is showing it age and i am putting this system together so that i can easily upgrade as $ permits...thanks for all the advice.	St
1.42.4	and to those suggesting switching to amd i appreciate the advice but i'm not a gamer and i've always been happy with my intel cpu's so i don't plan to change yet... thanks again	St
1.43.1	The old debate of processors.	St
1.43.2	First and formost the choice is yours and yours alone.	St
1.43.3	What you read here are only SUGGESTIONS!!!	St
1.43.4	Do your homework and choose what processor is right for you.	St
1.43.5	Only you know what applications you'll be running the most and choose which one is best suited for you.	Ques
1.43.6	There's so much resources on the net for you to determine the right one for you.	St
1.44.1	I would go with Windows XP Professional instead of home, as home is an off-shoot of Professional.	St
1.44.2	Next I would consider a minimum of 1 gig RAM especially if you are into music or video, also on the subject of audio and video, since these files eat a lot of disk space I would consider at least two of the Wistern Digital 120 gig hard drives, posibably in a raid configuration.	St
1.44.3	On any hadr drive over 60 gig, I would mount them in a 5 1/4 inch bay with a 5 1/4 bay fan blowing accross each one of them.	St
1.44.4	this is majorly important in a raid configuration unless you want to replace hard drives on a frequent basis.	St
1.44.5	I am running the Asus P4C800 myself and like it very much.	St
1.44.6	Depending on the production model of the board you are going to use, you might check the Asus web site forBIOS ubdate.	St
1.44.7	Also the P4C800 is a jumperless board so strapping is not a problem.	St
1.44.8	One thing you need to remember is that the P4 processor will run HOT.	St
1.44.9	You need to pack as many cooling fans into the case as it will hold.	St
1.44.10	I assume you are going to use the P4C800 built-in sound card.	St
1.44.11	It is comparable to the Sound Blaster Live.	St
1.44.12	If you need somethiung more that this you might consider another sound card.	St
1.44.13	If your budget can afford it I would consider at least 2 gig of RAM.	St
1.44.14	This may seem a lot but one thing you need to remember is that windows XP dosn't return unused ram to the memory pool.	St
1.44.15	You may start your compurer like a jet engin only to have it end up as a skate board in an hour or less depending on what you are using the system for.	St
1.44.16	There is a memory utility I use to help keep memory under control called MemTurbo.	St
1.44.17	Check it out at MemTurbo.com Hope this helps James	St
1.45.1	Correction, I bought the Santa Cruz card.	St
1.46.1	As the DSP issue has arisen, I've consulted the manual for the Santa Cruz from Turtle Beach, &quot;8MB DLS synthesizer with scalable DSP&quot; is listed for this card.	St
1.46.2	Again, couldn't be happier.	St
1.46.3	Great product for less dollars than any other around.	St
1.46.4	I paid about $50 including shipping.	St
1.46.5	Thanks and good luck!	Polite
1.47.1	I considered an Audigy until doing some careful research including talking to the leading studio building engineer in the state.	St
1.47.2	While an Audigy is compatible with my PENTIUM 4, for home recording and playback I'm very pleased with my $50 OEM Turtle Beach card.	St
1.47.3	He also recommended a $600 card as well called a Echo Layla.	St
1.47.4	Turtle Beach has Stereo 18 bit A/D converters for higher resolution recording than Audigy's 16 bit A/D converters.	St
1.47.5	That was important to me because I record things about as much as playback.	St
1.47.6	Check the specs, Turtle Beach specs out better, costs less and is more widely compatible with more systems as it even works in old Pentium 2's and there are no compatibility issues with AMD either.	St
1.47.7	Many people like Turtle Beach's software better that Creative's.	St
1.47.8	Tbeach software made by their parent company Voyetra is extremely stable and easy to use.	St
1.47.9	By the way, there's been some posts about &quot;The Audigy Scream of Death&quot; afflicting some XP system machines after installing the Audigy card, here's one review where the &quot;Audigy Scream Of Death&quot; is discussed, http://www.pcscoop.com/hardware/audio/SoundBlaster/Audigy/page4.asp	St
1.48.1	Backing up your files is always smart, if for no other reason, JUST in case you fry something or a virus gets you, even in a new system build.	St
1.48.2	Format and use your Windows XP upgrade disk without loading Windows 98se first, but keep the Win 98se disk at hand, you will need to put it in during the install to prove you have the right to upgrade.	St
1.48.3	I agree with many of the others, AMD/Intel is a personal choice but I think you have it right with the stuff you have so far.	St
1.48.4	Sound card is only thing I see left off from the start, more RAM is a definate plus but you already have the plan so good on ya!	St
1.48.5	DVD Burners, I recommend using one that handles DVD+R/RW AND DVD-R/RW if not adding the newer Dual (Double)Layer also.	St
1.48.6	Power Supply....get Antec True Power 480 Blue for excellent PSU and the added lighting for your windowed case.	St
1.48.7	Just my humble opinions.	St
1.49.1	I understand that XP Home doesn't support hyper threading.	St
1.49.2	So you would either have to get XP pro or look at changing to an AMD based PC.	St
1.50.1	Many has talked about &quot;you have to&quot; or &quot;you should&quot; update your BIOS... well that's not the entire truth... You DON'T have to update your BIOS if the PC runs fine with all installed hardware without the BIOS update.... and you SHOULD NOT update it if all runs fine.	St
1.50.2	WHY??	St
1.50.3	you may ask... Well simply because there is a GREAT RISK doing so.	St
1.50.4	BIOS upgrades are VERY risky... and if it fails, you WILL end up with a non working motherboard...	St
1.50.5	There goes your $$$ Only update the BIOS if absolute necessary!!!	St
1.50.6	If your PC boot fine and runs fine, then DON'T TOUCH THE BIOS!!!	St
1.50.7	There is no need and NO gain in doing so!!!	St
1.50.8	IF you are not absolutly 100% sure about what you'r doing... then u should consider to let a technician do it.	St
1.50.9	A interupted/faulty BIOS-update WILL damage your motherboard!	St
1.51.1	In my opionion the only way to &quot;future proof&quot; a system is to not build it in the first place.	St
1.51.2	A 3.2 gig P4 with those components will do just fine except for and AMD user.	St
1.51.3	some peeps just do not like to hear it when they are told to switch for no reason other that what the the advisor has read.	St
1.51.4	I run a p4 2.6 which will run with or ahead of any athlon in the same price range.	St
1.52.1	I do not feel that money spent on RAM is wasted, Put as much RAM in the machine as you can afford!	St
1.53.1	512 is fine for simple ONE application stuff.	St
1.53.2	Most games are not really happy without 1gb and if you do more than one thing at once, 1gb is a necessity.	St
1.53.3	Especially for the low low price of only another $70, you will definately notice an increase in speed.	St
1.54.1	Just checking, you have no monitor listed, so I assume you have one already?	St
1.55.1	i do but i will be replacing that too asap...	St
1.56.1	as i said before, i definatly will be adding more ram (and several other upgrades) as $ permits...this configuration is a starting point, it consists of only those components that will allow me to use it right away but easily upgrade in the months to come.	St
1.57.1	yes what about sound, heatsink and fan.	St
1.57.2	heatsink compound would help as well between chip and fan unless the pentium has it all inbuilt.	St
1.57.3	i only ever use amd.	St
1.57.4	good luck	Polite
1.58.1	the processor does come with heatsink and fan...as for a thermal compound, i will be using this: Arctic Silver Premium High-Density Thermal Compound, Model &quot;Ceramique&quot;, 2.5-gram( ~0.8 cc. )	St
1.58.2	tube 4.49	St
1.59.1	Have you decided on a sound card yet?	St
1.59.2	Also, u might want to consider getting a 16X DVD+RW/-RW.	St
1.59.3	I am building my first one two.	St
1.59.4	It is taking awhile, since I am doing it custom.	St
1.59.5	I would also thing about putting a gig of memory instead of 512, that way you will have one to last for years and years.	St
1.59.6	Hopes this helps David G. Shriver Fellow builder	St
1.60.1	Hey buddy!	St
1.60.2	Congrats on building a computer!	St
1.60.3	I have built two and have had mixed success, and I do have some suggestions.	St
1.60.4	First of all, I noticed that your price quoted for your cpu for example, was quite high.	St
1.60.5	I would check www.newegg.com for quotes.	St
1.60.6	I have bought through them many times, and they are extremely reliable, have great prices, great customer service and their shipping is outstanding...give it a shot!	St
1.60.7	Also, i have worked with amd extensively, and while their clock speed is not as high as pentium, their frontside bus is much faster, allowing the motherboard to handle more data at the same time than the p4.	St
1.60.8	Also, amd's are cheaper, I would recommend an xp.	St
1.60.9	You also mentioned that you would be adding a floppy drive.	St
1.60.10	I would go away from this.	St
1.60.11	I never use floppys anymore.	St
1.60.12	I purchased a 256MB jump drive and am very pleased with how it has handled my data needs.	St
1.60.13	A few reasons: 1) floppys are unreliable 2) floppys have a small amount of space available.	St
1.60.14	3) floppys are extremely slow My jump drive was $30 and makes data transfer between computers very easy, and with a usb 2.0 connection, you can transfer 256mb of data or more in less time than it takes a floppy to slide its door open.	St
1.60.15	Current needs of a computer necessitate more RAM-the more the better (within reason of course).	St
1.60.16	I would suggest no less than a gigabyte of RAM.	St
1.60.17	You would be fine by buying another stick of the same kind (2x512).	St
1.60.18	I mulitask, and for an experienced, power user, the RAM can be used up pretty quick (especially keeping in mind the proggies that run in the background.)	St
1.60.19	Good mobo choice!	St
1.60.20	Asus rocks.	St
1.60.21	Gigabyte also.	St
1.60.22	Go with windows xp pro.	St
1.60.23	i dont have a reason other than the crap that comes bundled with it is pretty much useless, and pro is more streamlined.	St
1.60.24	make sure sp2 works also, it's been known to crash some computers.	Sug
1.60.25	make sure to get spybot s&d (a free spyware utility) and antivirus (nod 32 is the best, it finds things norton doesnt find!)	Sug
1.60.26	run both programs in safe mode (sometimes the virus and spyware dont boot up in this case).	St
1.60.27	most importantly, get the most updated parts you can!	St
1.60.28	the faster the better!	St
1.60.29	newegg runs specials everyday and you can find some great deals.	St
1.60.30	finally, good luck on building your computer.	Polite
1.60.31	I hope my little post helped you out!	St
1.61.1	congrats for the courage to make ur first PC.	St
1.61.2	You will be glad u did.	St
1.61.3	First - all looks good.	St
1.61.4	Noise is an issue.	St
1.61.5	The raptor 10000 rpm is noisy, the supplied pentium fan is noisy and the video card fan will also probably be noisy.	St
1.61.6	I made a similar system and had to go back to make modifications for noise reduction .	St
1.61.7	Consider an aftermarket (Zalman?)	St
1.61.8	fan for the CPU.	St
1.61.9	Consider a fanless heatpipe (Zalman) for the video card.	St
1.61.10	The Raptor whines like a jet and the speed increase is not noticible except for bragging rights!	St
1.61.11	I would recommend 7400 rpm drives.	Sug
1.61.12	I used 2 SATA drives in a Raid 0 configuration.	St
1.61.13	That is good for bragging rights!	Polite
1.61.14	and it is fast.	St
1.61.15	I would suggest going for 1 Gig of memory if your budget allows.	Sug
1.61.16	and an audio card can be added later if u want.	St
1.62.1	Cooling put some dollars into CPU and Case cooling	St
1.63.1	heya... this may come late and you've probably got your new system running already - congrats and enjoy!	St
1.63.2	nonetheless, there are some things which i would like to contribute... perhaps to the benefit of future system builders.	St
1.63.3	firstly, lets start with the fundamental that the overall power of a computer is determined by its lowest performing component.	St
1.63.4	this presents a bottleneck and will ultimately be responsible for the computer's performance in noticeable terms.	St
1.63.5	various posts have indicated that the amount of ram should be increased to at least 1gb.	St
1.63.6	I agree entirely.	St
1.63.7	no matter what application you run, the specs of individual components should match those in other categories in terms of performance.	St
1.63.8	for example, if you get an enthusiast class video card, such as a Radeon X800XL, the performance will undoubtedly be superb... but only if you have the CPU power to match it.	St
1.63.9	Therefore, i wish to stress the point that 10,000rpm drives are not worth the cash unless you're running a server.	St
1.63.10	These drives are faster than 7,200rpm drives by merely milliseconds and yet cost 3 times as much.	St
1.63.11	Instead, the money should be spent on buying a new monitor with faster refresh rates, changing to an AMD Athlon64 3500+/3800+/4000+ processor or buying a higher end graphics card.	St
1.63.12	Thx for reading.	St
1.64.1	get AT LEAST 1Gig of RAM.	St
1.64.2	512 is a crappy amount i have 512 right now and my comp is slow.	St
1.64.3	get AT LEAST a GIG.	St
