<s> Does anyone know a good wireless-g router (MIMO would be nice) that also serves a printer? </s>
<s> I've seen a bunch with USB ports in the rear, does this enable storage/printserve capability? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But I have setup a few of those linksys print servers. </s>
<s> Why must it be in the router? </s>

<s> My main goal is simplicity for the network. </s>
<s> I know for a fact that routers with print serve functionality exist...there's an ASUS joint that has NAS built in, print server and a host of other goodies, but it didn't get a very good review. </s>
<s> I've found all in ones to be more problematic. </s>
<s> Maybe this has changed but I like repeating what works. </s>
