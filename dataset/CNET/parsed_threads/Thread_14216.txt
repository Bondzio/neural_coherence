<s> I have a virgin superhub downstairs with my TV and Xbox attached. </s>
<s> I also have a DG834G router upstairs with a bt connection with two pcs and connected. </s>
<s> I want to use the netgear router to extend the reange of the super hub so that I only have 1 network in the house as the range of the superhub is not good enough. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I have tried to set the netgear as an extender but cannot get it to work. </s>
<s> Sorry but no step by step is available. </s>
<s> Only guides. </s>
<s> Many over at https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=how+to+use+a+router+as+an+access+point This will make it look as if there is one network. </s>

<s> I don't want to connect a cable between the routers as its not an easy route. </s>
<s> Can they be connected wirelessly? </s>
<s> I often use a powerline bridge to make that last link. </s>
<s> Most routers are capable of configuring WDS. </s>
<s> This allows the two routers to communicate with each other and still support your wireless devices. </s>
<s> You should refer to your owner manuals to see if you have this option. </s>
<s> WDS has it's downsides though. </s>
<s> You cut your throughput in half and the connection is not always the most stable. </s>
<s> Keep this in mind. </s>
<s> I recently bought a Netgear WN2000RPT unit http://www.amazon.co.uk/Netgear-Universal-WiFi-Range-Extender/dp/B003LAD8BY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1352280572&sr=8-2 Within 5 minutes the extender was up and running and a strong-excellent signal across the first floor of our house. </s>
<s> If you want to use an old Netgear router, I have also tried this in the past and took it wired into another part of the house; not as flexible though as the above wireless unit. </s>
