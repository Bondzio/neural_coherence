1.1.1	Hi everyone , I have two questions but I will post them seperately as they 'll both have different answers !	St
1.1.2	A friend called me up as she purchased a Mac laptop in the States ( we are in the UK ) , she wanted to know about the best ISP for her , so I 've left her to think about her online usage for me to find a good deal but she also asked about having the laptop wireless , so she can be in her bedroom , living room etc and still get online - without having wires trailing around the house .	St
1.1.3	As I 've never owned a Mac before and also not having anything wireless in my own house I 'm a bit stumped !	St
1.1.4	Does anyone have any suggestions or even some websites for me to read up on ?	Ques
1.1.5	I am also looking on this website for some clues and that 's how I found this forum !	St
1.1.6	Any help would be much appreciated Thanks in advance Lee	Polite
1.2.1	The Mac is n't too different , but for ease of the setup go get the Apple airport and card from ... Apple .	St

1.3.1	Hi Bob , Thanks for your quick reply !	St
1.3.2	My friend has just phoned me ( which was rather handy ) and told me that her Mac has on it 'Airport Extreme Ready ' , she 's not sure if that means a card is inside the computer or she has to buy one ?	Ques
1.3.3	I 'm browsing Apple 's website now to find out - do you know ?	Ques
1.3.4	The computer she bought is called the IBook G4 with Mac OS X .	St
1.3.5	Again I 'm going to have to look it up on their site being a Windows PC gal She still fancies the idea of being wireless but she 's not sure of what bits and bobs she will need , in the meantime I 'm going to check out some ISP 's for her .	St
1.3.6	I appreciate your help Bob , thanks again for anything further you can add Lee -X-	Polite
1.4.1	The usual will be some DSL or Cable modem to the Airport ( you pick which one ) and the laptop has all it needs .	St

1.5.1	Hi Bob , So her new Mac has the bits inside , it 's just the ISP I will need to sort for her then ?	Ques
1.5.2	Most of them now give you the modem for free but she still needs a router - is that right ?	Ques
1.5.3	I know nothing about wireless so I 'm hitting in the dark here , lets say she got an ISP and they send her the modem , phone to modem wire , modem to PC ( or in her case Mac ) wire , but she wants it to be wireless , so does she need to get a router then plug the bits the ISP send her into the router ?	Ques
1.5.4	What would then plug into her Mac ?	Ques
1.5.5	Or would that be self explanatory once she got the router ?	Ques
1.5.6	I just thought I 'd look on PC Worlds site for a router to see if it said what is in the box , it does n't but if she bought this one : BELKIN 54G WIRELESS CABLE / DSL GATEWAY ROUTER is that the same as the modem that an ISP would give her ?	Ques
1.5.7	Or does she still need the ISP 's modem & software on top of something like the above ?	Ques
1.5.8	Sorry Bob , I know your not getting paid for your help and I do appreciate picking your brain .	St
1.5.9	I also help for free so I really do appreciate your time .	St
1.5.10	Lee -X-	St
1.6.1	The sites of Apple.com , linksys.com and more do cover such details , but it looks like this would all that you need .	St
1.6.2	The one thing that seems to be a constant is that it seems best to keep all the wifi gear by the same maker .	St
1.6.3	This is why , in this case I 'd get the airport .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
