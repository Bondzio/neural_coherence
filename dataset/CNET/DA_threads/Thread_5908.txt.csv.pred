1.1.1	No need to describe the specific layout or application in this situation , just a quick question that requires a simple answer .	St
1.1.2	Background : In my hardward configuratoin for a certain computer setup , a drive must be taken out and put back into a bay daily .	St
1.1.3	The bay is conected by an ide/eide connector .	St
1.1.4	Because of the unintended use of this cable , it will creep out of place in a week or so .	St
1.1.5	Question : Where can I get a cable or a connector that will snap , screw , or otherwise secure the cable/connector in place .	St
1.1.6	Does such a component exist ?	Ques
1.2.1	Example at http : //multimedia.3m.com/mws/mediawebserver ? 66666UuZjcFSLXTt58Ty5Xs6EVuQEcuZgVs6EVs6E666666 -- I rarely deploy something so heavy duty but these are out there if you search for them .	St

1.3.2	I am thinking of painting a small amount of glue across the top ( the Keyed part and the hole that the key fits into ) similar to glue that is used to lock screws in place , but with a little force will let go .	St
1.3.3	Does anyone know of a glue/pint that will bond non-permanently in this way ?	Ques
1.4.1	We used tie wraps and hot glue to hold it together .	St
1.4.2	I did n't mention such because I got the impression you wanted something commercially made .	St
1.4.3	bob	St
1.5.1	the connector is mounted to a circuit board .	St
1.5.2	Describe how you used zip ties ... ?	Ques
1.5.3	The hot glue makes sence though ; hot glue could be used all around it , and it 's certainly not permanent .	St
1.5.4	That might be my solution .	St
1.6.1	This is where you use your imagination .	St
1.6.2	If you ca n't use tie wraps , then do n't use them .	St
1.6.3	Here 's what I think a tie wrap is - & gt ; http : //www.tiewraps.com/tiewrappage.html	St
