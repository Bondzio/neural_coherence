For instance the Wizard can't handle making the connection if we add or enable a firewall.
So it's my view we best do without such wizards and set these things up the old fashioned way.
There is a Magic Network software out there but I've never found it reliable enough to sort out networks for those that wanted an easy button.
I'm still pretty stumped since I know so little about your network.
Sometimes it's out of date firmware in the router, firewall settings or other oddities.
How do I setup a network?
I follow the directions on the router and know when and where to setup the firewall to allow what I want.
