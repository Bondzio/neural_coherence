This is why I wrote I don't have a do this cure.
The site and what it does and the player it uses can thwart common cures.
CNET TV has been a source of player trouble for some time.
It's likely to be a NIH ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here ) syndrome as there are many that love to create new ways of doing the same old thing.
Good luck and I hope you find a cure.
Is it possible to swap which display is &quot;primary&quot;?
I can do that on desktops.
