<s> I am looking into a new computer around Christmas time. </s>
<s> One is an Emachines while the other is an HP. </s>
<s> If I get the E-machines, I will upgrade the video card from a Radeon X200 to a 9600. </s>
<s> I am having doubts because some of my classmates say I am better off building one than work with an Emachines. </s>
<s> But I did my homework and found out they are really good computers. </s>
<s> I was wondering I should even bother upgrading it or give it a shot and see what I come up with. </s>
<s> A very humble PC by today's standards. </s>
<s> I guarantee that if I knew then what I know now, I'd definitely build one. </s>
<s> When I bought the Emachines I knew nothing about PC tech. </s>
<s> It got me started, though. </s>
<s> You could build a nice little PC for about the same cost as buying a fully assembled PC and still have a better and more powerful system. </s>
<s> My advice would be to build one. </s>
<s> Rely on this forum for help. </s>
<s> This is one of the best, if not the best, forums on the World Wide Web. </s>
<s> If you do build a PC, make certain you stick to basics and buy the least expensive parts you can. </s>
<s> Once you get past this, you'll be building screaming demons. </s>
<s> For the most part, you can always upgrade, why the rush. </s>
<s> At least see what the eMachine is putting out before getting into a upgrade mode. </s>
<s> Just get a feel for it, if an upgrade is needed then by all means upgrade. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> new comps. </s>
<s> come with pci-express x16 since all new cards are made for pci-express x16 only </s>
<s> It all depends on how much you want to spend. </s>
<s> If you want a lower cost system, go with the eMachines. </s>
<s> If you want to get better quality, build your own ... if you have lots of self-control. </s>
<s> I thought I'd build my own, then started planning the system out. </s>
<s> It only costs a few dollars more to get this better motherboard, and the better case, and the better video card, and the better ... get the idea? </s>
<s> All those just a few dollars more add up ... and fast. </s>
<s> Before I knew it, I was spending double what the eMachines cost me. </s>
<s> Sure it was a better system ... had what I wanted in it, and would have cost even more to buy it completed if I could find one like it. </s>
<s> If money was no question, I'd have built my own ... money was tight, I bought eMachines and am upgrading at my pace .. well ... as money allows. </s>
<s> As for the video card, you'd want PCI-e over AGP anyway ... twice the data bus, over twice the speed. </s>
<s> Take a piece of advice...Emachines and HP's are VERY proprietary (also Dell, Gateway, etc). </s>
<s> Here's some things to think about: Standard (built) computers have at least a 300 W power supply. </s>
<s> These (emachines and HP) have about 200 or LESS in general. </s>
<s> Put a high end video card in there and the power supply may pop like a fire cracker. </s>
<s> These manufactures usually use the cheapest, sorriest, most proprietary junk they can find. </s>
<s> They also load the hard drives up with so much junk that you have about 1% of system memory usable after loading all the garbage. </s>
<s> Example... My Fiance has a Dell with 2.5 GHz Intel, 1GB ram, Gforce video card. </s>
<s> I built mine with an Athlon 3200 (1.8GHz), 1GB ram, ATI Radeon 9600. </s>
<s> Well....My computer runs about 30% faster than hers. </s>
<s> The first thing to learn about computers is the &quot;store bought ones&quot; are absolute garbage. </s>
<s> I'm not sure where you did your homework that told you that the emachines are good. </s>
<s> Maybe they're good compared to HP or other store bought or Dell machines. </s>
<s> However, that would be like comparing a pinto with a duster. </s>
<s> Comparing store bought with one you build is like comparing a pinto with a ferrari Testarosa. </s>
<s> Most manufactuers arre going away from proprietary parts. </s>
<s> Except dell, with their stupid btx cases/psu/etc... Emachines are very upgradeable and hardly has any spyware or adware when out of th ebox. </s>
<s> As for hP/compaq, definitely opposite. </s>
<s> Sonys are okay. </s>
<s> Gateways are good. </s>
<s> DELLs, nope, i wouldn't buy if possible. </s>
<s> BTW oems use pretty good parts that are off-the-shelf, but usually modified in that certain features are disabled. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The eMachines T6524 came with a 300W power supply. </s>
<s> Of course, that is still not enough to run the new high end video cards. </s>
<s> I had to upgrade the psu for the ATI Radeon X800XL I added to my system. </s>
<s> Proprietary? </s>
<s> Not any longer. </s>
<s> The MB is an OEM version made by MSI, granted a low end version, but used by at least eMachines, HP, and Compaq (yeah, same as HP, I know) in their systems. </s>
<s> But it is still a 939 Socket MB and includes a PCI-e slot, 4 RAM slots, an open drive bay, 3 open pci slots ... very upgradable, a good starting point. </s>
<s> As for junk on the hard drive ... nothing Add/Remove Programs couldn't resolve. </s>
<s> i got a t6212 in may from emachines....upgraded the ram to 1.5 gb, disabled the onboard video and added a geforce 6600(its all i need for the games i play), cleaned out the &quot;crap&quot; i dont need from the hard drive, bought anti-virus, d/l spybot, adaware and spywareblaster, and my machine flies without problems. </s>
<s> and emachines does use decent, not great, hardware. </s>
<s> but for the money and self-upgrading, i would not recommend anything else. </s>
<s> also, i have never had a problem burning cd's, dvd's. </s>
