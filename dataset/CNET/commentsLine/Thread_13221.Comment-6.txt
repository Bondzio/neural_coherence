well, i don't have one of these... it was a friend of mine who bought his 3 years ago (dell precision workstation 220 with dual 933 mhz processors).
he now upgraded his ram and states that his ram is faster than those used by computers with pc3200 ddr400 since the ram he just got is running at 800mhz and the ddr at 400 if i'm not too wrong... i don't know.
you may have an explanation for me.
thanks in advance!
