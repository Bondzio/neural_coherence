beleieve me, i understand the dail-up issue for large files.
when i need such large files, i use a friend's or co. system to d/l and burn to cd or flash drive and take home.
its frustating, but i found no other way.
as for the required vista drivers or s/w, then only the maker/vendor can supply that.
pinnacle is definetly your only source, so query them or see what they have.
since, you've been there you know what's &quot;currently&quot; available.
again, query them, but the box/manual should explain what the product does and i'm sure it didn't have &quot;vista&quot; logo supported as well.
if you can, return the item asap for full refund before that causes a problem if nothing works.
