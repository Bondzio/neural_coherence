I've owned the Dell Dimension 4100 I am typing on since 2000 and had very few problems with it.
I also understand the last few years have been a downward spiral for quality and customer service, which used to be their strong suites.
I need a new desktop and wondered if Dell has pulled their heads out of their butts yet to keep other makers like HP from taking away their market share further.
I'm trying to take some of the current bad stuff written about Dell with a grain of salt.
I realize they sell a lot of computers, so they're going to get a larger number of complaints, but percentage of machines sold that are problems are more important than sheer numbers.
Besides, unhappy people are more likely to post than satisfied ones.
Given the state of things here in June 2008, would anyone recommend an XPS 420?
I understand they are supposed to have their own support division.
