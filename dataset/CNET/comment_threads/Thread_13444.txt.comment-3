That link told me a lot before I actually pick one up and play around with it.
I am not trying to substitute a tablet for a laptop.
I have a very nice laptop which I plan on keeping.
My main reason for the Tablet is because I will be doing a lot of traveling starting this summer and really don't want to haul my laptop around.
It will give me something to do on those long flights other than reading all those magazines the airlines stuff in the seat in front of you.
Another reason for the Toshiba is I still get a discount through my old company on Toshiba products.
