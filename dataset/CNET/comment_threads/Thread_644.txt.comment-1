Hello, I just bought an external hard and plan to reformat it to NTFS.
I have a PC with Windows 2000 and a laptop with XP Pro that I will use it with.
I will also take it over to a friend's house to transfer some music from his collection.
I believe that his external hard drive is formatted to FAT32.
Might be an ignorant question, but will I be able to take files off of his FAT32 formatted external hard drive and transfer them to my NTFS formatted drive?
In addition, if he has data stored on his Windows ME pc that I want, I am assuming that I cannot take it since my drive is NTFS?
Is that correct?
Thanks in advance for any help.
