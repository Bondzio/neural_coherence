1.1.1	Hey everyone: My cooling fan is starting to die.	St
1.1.2	On starting the computer the fan vibrates hard (up & down grinding tone (as in a bearing going out)) for 2 to 3 minutes.	St
1.1.3	The 875P chip is on a gigabyte GA-81875 with a 478 socket.	St
1.1.4	After the initial warm up time the sound goes away and it runs smooth from then on.	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know where to purchase just a replacement fan?	Ques
1.1.6	It seems if you want the fan you have to buy the mother board but then it's older so a new board then a new CPU $$$$$.	St
1.1.7	Thanks Craig	St
1.2.1	http://www.1coolpc.com/ has many small fans.	St
1.2.2	Click on the chipset link.	St
1.2.3	Bob PS.	St
1.2.4	Yes, I've bought from them.	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob, I 'll go see what they have.	St
1.3.2	Craig	St
1.4.1	I confess ...I've bought there too.	St
1.5.1	Looked around and then looked some more, hoping for the right fan.	St
1.5.2	The have them for everything else, just not for the 875P chip itself.	St
1.5.3	Thanks, I need to keep digging, any other thoughts?	St
1.5.4	Can the fan even be replaced?	St
1.5.5	Thanks again Craig	St
1.6.1	a specific heatsink fan solution for the i875 but you should be able to find a replacement fan that's dying.	Sug
1.6.2	In some cases folks are buying and installing better bigger, better heatsinks .. made by Zalman, and using no fans.	St
1.7.1	I've had to use close enough then use epoxy or other means to replace a few.	St
1.7.2	But the link I supplied sufficed for them all.	St
1.7.3	jameco.com has some fans too, but it will take awhile to dig there.	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Ya know, it finally hit me that the cooling fan is NOT an exotic piece of precision equipment inside the PC but just cooling that can be adapted to ones needs.	St
1.8.2	Thank You All...	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
