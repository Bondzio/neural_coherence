i really don't have an answer to this problem.
my interest is that i have the same problem.
with the minor exception that two of my computers are wired to the router.
they can see the connection but can't connect until i reboot the router.
my router is a belkin n+ etc.
all of my computers are w7, my iphone(s) are the 3g, my wireless printer is an epson.
need i go on?
i think not.
as you stated, the only solution is a reboot.
that was the case with my last router and i suspect it will be the case with my next router.
it seems the industry doesn't care beyond the purchase.
i've contacted belkin; their only suggestion was a firmware update.
while there was an update available, it didn't solve the problem.
i make it a point to check the networking icon before i do anything and i have the router easily accessible.
