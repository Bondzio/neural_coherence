<s> Wanted to see if one could virtualize a small email server to a USB drive of sufficient capacity. </s>
<s> Looking for powered USB drive [if one exists] and perhaps someone who has actually done this. </s>
<s> Much thanks in advance for an informed opinion. </s>
<s> I missed it. </s>
<s> What did you want to do exactly? </s>
<s> Linux and mail servers running happily off those spiffy 20 buck 8GB USB drives on some old PC but maybe you want a PC on an USB STICK? </s>

<s> Much thanks for your timely reply. </s>
<s> With the advance of virtualization I just thought it might be possible to virtualize applications to a USB drive. </s>
<s> The two obvious barriers would be power and a physical connection to a router. </s>
<s> Just wondering if there is anything like this in existence or being ontemplated. </s>
<s> Ideally, I would would like to access some things without having a desktop on 24/7. </s>
<s> Let's just say that virtualization still requires a CPU and all the rest of the system. </s>
<s> Maybe you were asking for a full computer on some USB stick but I couldn't tell. </s>
