<s> Firstly, I apologize if this is the wrong place. </s>
<s> My question is what is the equivalent of Motherboard in the older generation computers (like the 1st Gen computers) ??? </s>
<s> I heard it was vacuum tubes. </s>
<s> If so, I would like to know how they performed the function of a motherboard. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> If you looked at very early computers that used tubes, they often had a rudimentary backplane. </s>
<s> Later these advanced to such as the VMEBUS http://duckduckgo.com/?q=vmebus+backplane and for the personal computers the S-100 was very common. </s>
<s> With the Apple 1 you see the beginnings of the motherboard where the computer was small enough to be put directly on the backplane. </s>

<s> in the tube era. </s>
<s> If anything these were dedicated devices, etc. </s>
<s> that did a task in/out or to process. </s>
<s> Those computers that were mechanical and/or before anything transistors were mostly in the 50-60's era. </s>
<s> There were modules at best or wirewrap to include backplanes, black boxes or PCB's mounted on busses which are concidered backplanes. </s>
<s> Also, tubes found on older computers may have been power related rather than logic. </s>
<s> Google for computer museums, even WWII era ultra enigma decoders. </s>
<s> However, don't confuse analog computers to what was the 1st electrical or non-mechanical type computers. </s>
