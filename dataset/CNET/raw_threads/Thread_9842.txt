14785	0	166600	1843830	NR	Mr.Snrub	3/29/06 3:13 PM	1.14364518E12	Can someone help me choose a video card?	I am looking to purchase Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and it is time to upgrade my ATI Radeon 9200 128 MB to something a little more powerful. My motherboard only has an AGP slot and I have somewhat narrowed it down to these video cards: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1782292&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1240195&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1460940&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1240060&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 All of these ones are 256 MB NVIDIAs. I am leaning towards the first one from PNY the 6800 GS. I also found some 128 MB ones for a similar price: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1182887&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1121824&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 I'm thinking that 256 MB is gonna be better than 128 MB or is that not always true. Anyway if anyone can help me choose a good one (either from these or another one) it would be much appreciated

14785	7	166600	1849020	1843830	Mr.Snrub	3/31/06 10:30 PM	1.1438442E12	More choices	Well I think I might end up going with the PNY geforce 6800 gs 256 MB one found here: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1782292&CatId=0 The only other ones I can find that are similar to what people have mentioned are these: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2111221&CatId=0 (this one is large but I could probably fit it in my case if I took out my useless dial-up modem card) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1904065&Tab=11&NoMapp=0 (a little more expensice than the others, also for the x-series of ATI cards, is a lower number a better card, as opposed to how it was with the 9000 series where a larger number was better) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1892411&CatId=0 (Again a little more expensive, but is it any better?) Also being in Canada I can't order anything from newegg or zipzoomfly because they don't ship to Canada. So I am pretty much stuck with Tigerdirect.ca, thought they do seem to have pretty reasonable prices) Any further help is appreciated.
