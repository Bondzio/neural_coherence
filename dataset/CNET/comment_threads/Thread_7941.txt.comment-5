Quick followup.
Some friends told me to open the case and plug hd inside the computer as a slave.
I'm not really sure what that means, or how to do it.
I open the case and unplug the hd.
Then I open the tower and plug in the hd?
Where?
Will it be obvious?
Do I have to plug in a power supply for the hd, too?
