hi...im new to raid arrays.
i currently have a 1.5tb hdd.
i recently purchase another 1.5tb drive and i'd like to setup an array using the two disks.
foremost i want to implement a RAID 1 to achieve mirroring for data security.
however would also like to have the speed increase of stripping.
im considering using a OS based RAID 10, partitioning 4x 750gb partitions.
howver my mobo does support RAID arrays...and i curious about the differences between os based and hardware based raid systems..thnx.
