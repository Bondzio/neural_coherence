i'm a teacher and need to be able to use a keyboard while presenting information on the projector.
sitting at a desk is stupid and impractical for me (i've got middle schoolers, folks!
), and i was wondering what the effective range for wireless keyboards are.
more than likely i would go for a usb, but if a bluetooth has better range (which common sense is telling it would), i could go that route.
thank you for any and all input!
regards, darren aho
