However when I click on it it still shows as connected to to local and internet and Windows does not find any problems with it when I check it. I can receive and send email and even my VPN works, but I can't browse the web and cannot use Skype. Is this a problem with my computer or with the ISP? I have a Vista machine with Windows defender sometimes on and the bulky,clumsy McAffee antivirus that came with the computer. I have adsl with a wifi set up in my house. Does anyone know what could be going on?
