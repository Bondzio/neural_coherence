I've got 4 MB of RAM on my Vista 32-bit Home Premium setup (a friend had 2 MB left over after a rebuild of his machine, so I figured there's nothing to lose by adding them to the 2 MB that came with the HP Pavilion m8100y).
The system recognizes 3.25 MB of that 4 MB, so that means 0.75 MB is not being used for anything that I can tell.
If it weren't free, I wouldn't have added the last MB.
Does the extra 1.25 MB make a difference?
YES!!
I run MS Flight Simulator X on this machine, which is well-documented memory hog.
The extra RAM allows me to turn up many of the reality settings, which make the simulation much more realistic.
I don't know what else the extra RAM can do, but it helps this game a great deal.
