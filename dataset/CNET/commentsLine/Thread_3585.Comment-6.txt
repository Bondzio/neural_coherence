i had a fathom external drive that got the &quot;click of death&quot; and i lost all my data.
so when i replaced it, i bought the much more highly rated western digital my book.
two months ago i heard the horrible &quot;click of death&quot; sound as it tried and tried to search for files and then failed.
i finally got it to be recognized (sort of) by the computer.
it assigned it a drive letter, but indicated that the drive was completely unformatted.
about one terebyte of data now gone!
but there's an interesting end to this hard drive story.
i didn't throw it away like i did the fathom.
and the other day i gave it a try again, but this time plugging it into a different circuit -- not the powerstrip where all my other components were plugged into.
apparently the power converter (this is just a guess of course) was not pulling quite enough power from the shared power strip to power the drive.
once it was on a seperate outlet, it did just fine and i was able to access my data.
i'm not fully convinced something isn't wrong with the drive, but i was able to salvage and tranfer the data to another external drive.
kinda wierd!
because i have several other hard drives all plugged into power strips, and they all do just fine.
