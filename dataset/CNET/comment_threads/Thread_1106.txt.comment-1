Hi, I want to buy 2 of these computers: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dell-Optiplex-GX270-Professional-pre-installed/dp/B001O018Y2/ref=sr_1_6?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1291734289&sr=1-6 and was wondering if it is possible to link the 2 together so it is one computer?
If so could tell me what I have to do to link them.
Thanks.
