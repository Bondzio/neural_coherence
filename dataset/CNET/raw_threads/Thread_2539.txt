When this is done even the data recovery software that will allow you to recover data on a formatted HDD cannot pick up any data on the HDD. I was wondering if there is a high-level format tool like that? and if there is what is that tools name? I have searched on google and yahoo for it, but i still have yet to find what i am really looking for.
