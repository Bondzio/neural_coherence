Don't tell a solder to put on a AGP slot on your AGP-less motherboard cause it will screw up big time!
I tried it once 2 years ago with my old motherboard and the slot fried right on the moment of when I turned on the PC( hecka pissed me off), so I recommend you to get a motherboard with AGP 8X instead( they're pretty cheap these days)
