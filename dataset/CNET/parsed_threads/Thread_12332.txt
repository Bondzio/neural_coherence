<s> Hi Can anyone help me with a problem I cant seem to over come. </s>
<s> My current set up is Connected to my master telephone socket (upstairs) is a Fibre Optic Broadband modem which then goes into a Huawei HG533 (talktalk) Wifi router, giving me WIFI in the home (connected to multiple Win7 PCs/Sky Box/iPhones/Android Tablets etc) I have an office out-building which I have a cat5 cable running from the office into my home downstairs. </s>
<s> (previously my broadband worked off the telephone slave socket and I could directly connect) now I am using a Belkin HD powerline connected to the WIFI router upstairs and then plugged in downstairs with the cat5 office cable inserted. </s>
<s> In the office I have Netgear RangeMax WNR854T which when the cat5 from the house is connected to the DSL socket which gives me wifi and allows me to direct connect my Win 7PC/IPTelephone/Network Printer/Win7 Laptop. </s>
<s> However this creates its own little network and whilst I can get internet ok. </s>
<s> I can not see the home PCs and vis-a-versa. </s>
<s> I want to be able to transfer files across the full network (currently using a USB stick) and print from any machine to the office printer. </s>
<s> If I connect the cat5 from the house to a LAN port I can see the full network but have now internet (or wifi) in the office.I thought by doing it this way my office router would act as a network hub and allow internet through but it doesnt. </s>
<s> I thought I had a pretty good understanding of these things but this problem has broken me!!! </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance </s>
<s> If we want to see the LAN. </s>
<s> If you used the WAN port then you are creating another LAN (sorry if I don't expand the common acronyms) on the other side of that router. </s>
<s> This is why I use routers for such things but GOOGLE THIS PHRASE -&gt; How do I use a router as a WAP? </s>
<s> That's all I ever needed. </s>
