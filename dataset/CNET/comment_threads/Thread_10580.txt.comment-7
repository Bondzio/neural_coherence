Had the same problem with mine.
Having done a bit of research it seems the eSATA connection on the drive is a bit problematic.
I found that if I push the eSATA cable firmly into the socket it will work, but as soon as I let go it does not.
Unfortunately I haven't found a solution yet, I will be trying a new cable soon.
Other users have trimmed the plastic on the cable connector so it will go further into the socket, I may try that as well.
