actually seeing the burner device correctly?
I would go to Nero's website to see if there are any device updates for your burner program......EZCD Creator, which is what I use, has downloads available at their site that actually adds newer cdrw/dvdrw devices to the program's database so it will see the newer devices correctly.
I check that site like a second religion when I replace my burner device as they die.
There should be a setting somewhere within the Nero program where you choose the SOURCE OR DESTINATION DRIVE (source is where the file is located that you want to burn.....destination is the drive device itself that will be doing the burning and that's what you want to check to make sure Nero sees it right).
