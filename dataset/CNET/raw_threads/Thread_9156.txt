Internet is working fine in both computers, as well as file sharing, but I have problems with printer sharing: I can print from XP to the HP deskjet printer hooked at LPT1 port of ME, but failed at adding the Lexmark printer hooked at USB port of XP as a network printer for ME. After using the ''Add Printer Wizard'' in ME, and installing the proper drivers, I get this message from Lexmark Wizard Installer saying installation failed because the printer is not correctly connected (''check all the printer cables''). This Lexmark works fine as a local printer for XP, so cables cannot be the real problem. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that this Lexmark uses an USB port? I'd would be grateful if I can get some help from more knowledgeable people. Thanks in advance. Jeyce

Today I phoned Lexmark Technical Service and was told that the problem is sharing between 2 different OS. It looked like a quick answer; the guy wasn't interested in digging any further. On my part, I do think that sharing between different computers (and consequently different OS) is of the essence of networking, and optimistically guess there should be a way. Jeyce

If it was going to share, you would share it and then try to find it with the add new printer tool on the client. But this one looks DOA. Try http://www.networkmagic.com/ and best of luck, Bob

It was hard to believe you couldn't share a printer on a network using TCP/IP, because the very reason to be of this protocol is the possibility of sharing resources between different computers and platforms. That's why Internet exists as we know it today. I finally was able to print to Lexmark hooked at XP from my old PC using WInME after some rather primitive procedure. I physically disconnected this Lexmark printer from XP and hooked it up to an USB port at ME, installing it like a local printer. I was able then to successfully finish with the Lexmark Wizard, install drivers and all. After removing this connection and hooking this printer back to XP, where it belongs, I opened this printer Properties at ME, and in Details added a new port, located at \\xp\lexmark (\\server\printer), and that made it! Moral of this case: sometimes trust your instinct over Technical Support. Thanks for your interest, Jeyce
