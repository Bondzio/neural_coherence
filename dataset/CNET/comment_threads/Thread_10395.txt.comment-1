Good day, my friends.
I'm having a Samsung Galaxy Note II, more commonly knows as the 'Phablet&quot;.
Initially I was happy that I needn't invest in a tablet as this is combination of both the interfaces.
Well, later I was really fascinated by the Windows 8 Pro Tablet that had come up in the market, and I had wished I had one.
So basically my question is like, will buying a Windows 8 Pro Tablet render my 'Phablet' useless?
Or is there anyone out there, who inspite of having a Phablet owns Tablet?
Please provide me with some details!
Thank you very much for the help in advance!
