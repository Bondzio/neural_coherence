<s> I am a graphic artist/web designer looking for a new computer. </s>
<s> I have always used PCs until I recently started a new job where macs are used. </s>
<s> I like the simple design of the iMac but don't want to give up a lot of power and options that the PC seems to offer. </s>
<s> How fast is the G5 1.8Ghz compared to the Pentium 4 with 3.0Ghz? </s>
<s> I am still far more comfortable using the PC, but if the iMac is the better system adusting will only be a minor problem. </s>
<s> If you could give me the pros and cons of each I would greatly appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thanks...Nicole </s>
<s> Surely you jest! </s>
<s> The OS and PC/Mac wars are over. </s>
<s> You can find all the old writings out on the web... </s>
<s> But if you have nothing but Mac at work, then that will be your new world. </s>
<s> It's not that hard to adjust to since the latest MacOS is very nice. </s>
<s> The one thing I suggest is to not overexpend on any machine. </s>
<s> You'll do fine. </s>
<s> And if you have all those Mac owners they usually help on any support issue. </s>
<s> If you get the PC, then you get to waste time defending your choice. </s>
<s> Since it's &quot;a job&quot;, look at it that way. </s>

<s> Bob I wasn't aware the Mac / PC wars were over. </s>
<s> Who won and why? </s>
