I read a thread from 2005 about custom built PCs for graphic designers and thought the data might be a bit outdated.
Can someone tell me if the following is above adequate for a graphic design computer - parts quoted by a local computer shop?
{I love using 2 monitors and need that capability in a new system} T 2.33 GHz Core 2 Duo 965 System includes 2.33 GHx Core2Duo, 975 m'bd w/X3000 graphics card 1 GB RAM DDR2 667 Fast Memory 250 GB SATA hard drive 7200RPM 1 DVD+RW burner 1 DVD drive 16x reader XP Pro OS [my request] XFX GeForce 7600GT 250MB 570MHz DDR3 Dual DVI 3 port fire wire pci card adapter [my request] I don't want the cheapest or most expensive available.
Just something reliable and fast fast fast.
I use Adobe InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.
Also occasional use of QuarkXpress.
Thanks anyone for your advice.
