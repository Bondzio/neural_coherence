i left the notebook turned on for the night, so and when i have woken up i noticed that it is just was hanged.
anytime i tried to reboot it - it always stayed in the moment of staring up progress running and running for ages.
i tried all variants of win7 booting up - results are the same, the only thing i could admit was the last string in &quot;start with command string support&quot; mode, and it was: &quot;loading classpnp.sys&quot;.
this info doesn't give me anytinhg.
i've tried to start from live cd, half of programs don't boot at all, mini windows xp, mini windows 7, acronis, smth else don't want to start.
mhdd says that disk is very well, memory test likes whole 2gb.. well, it's strange, but live linux isn't capricious, well.. ubuntu set up fine without any problems at all.. i could save all info from installed ubuntu (funny..).
finally, i wiped all hdd, guessing that maybe there were some errors in partitions or elsewhere, but... nope.. in search of truth i started pc check, and checked video memory, ram, and.. it hangs between memory test where there is system mem, cache mem, i don't undestand where exactly!
so, mb, cpu or bios?
i'll appreciate any of your answer, except &quot;warranty&quot;, &quot;guarantee&quot;, &quot;service center&quot;... thanks.
