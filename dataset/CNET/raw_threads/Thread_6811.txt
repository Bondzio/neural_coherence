I also purchased a TRENDnet 652 Wireless N router, for my home network. When I look at my Wireless Connection Status, it has always shown my Speed as 54.0 Mbps. I thought this was the speed of Wireless G? Does anyone know how I may troubleshoot the network adapter or router to figure out why I am not connecting at Wireless N speeds? I have ruled at range as an issue, and I believe my drivers are the most current. I don't know what to check from here. Any ideas?
