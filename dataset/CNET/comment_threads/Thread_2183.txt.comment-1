hey guys i just wanted to see if anyone could help me make a new computer config using newegg.com or tigerdirect.com.
I was just going to get one off of a website or something but i really think building one would be fun and make the system hold a sense of ownership.
All i really need is a setup that would work with the CPU and GPUs i want i just dont know what else i would need like right size case, cables, and or other stuff like that.
pretty much i need everthing else to house a AMD 4000+ CPU and two OCed nvidia 7800 GT graphic cards and a 600watt SLI rdy power supply.
This is what i got so far off tigerdirect for bout a grand &gt;AMD Athlon 64 4000+ / 1MB Cache / 2000MHz FSB / Socket 939 / San Diego Core / Processor with Fan &gt;Two (2) XFX GeForce 7800 GT Overclocked 256MB DDR3 PCI Express Video Cards and an Ultra X-Finity 600 Watt Power Supply (comes with 600 power supply) I havnt done this before and im only looking to spend about 1600+ but if there is a way to keep the price down i would like to have a FX53 cpu:) and no dual core stuff plz i know it rocks and i will upgrade later when every game is dual cored thanks
