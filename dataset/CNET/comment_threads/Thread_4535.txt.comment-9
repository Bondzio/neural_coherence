other than you not actually sharing your internet connection correctly.
I'm a little confused that you are asking these questions but ignoring the answers.
&lt;div&gt; Turn OFF the Personal Web Sharing, since this is not what your are trying to do.
Personal Web Sharing configures your Mac to essentially be a Web Server and gives you the ability to share files with anyone out there and is NOT associated with the sharing of your internet connection.
&lt;div&gt; Let's leave the Firewall off, for the time being and move to System Preferences &gt; Sharing and choose &quot;Internet Sharing&quot; Follow the instructions.
If chosen from here, the Firewall will be configured correctly when, or if, you decide to turn it back on.
P &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
