the eject issue is well known with that version.
cured in an update, if you didn't get the update you may have missed the opportunity.
i can not find it either.
workaround?
don't install directcd.
in fact, why bother with this old software when cdburnerxp (works on 98/me/nt/2000/xp) is free and does 99% of what i use a cdrw drive for.
