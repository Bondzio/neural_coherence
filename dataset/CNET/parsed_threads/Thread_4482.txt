<s> First of all I have an Hp S3200N Slimline model and I am looking to downgrade to XP Pro but I need to know if some of the drivers listed on the S3200N's download site at http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=2093&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=3548658&lang=en will work on XP Pro. </s>
<s> The drivers I'm concerned with are the DVD Drive, the Realtek Audio and the Lite-On Wireless USB Lan driver. </s>
<s> Anything you can offer will be helpful. </s>
<s> Specs of the S3200N include AMD 4000 at 2.1GHz and 1GB of RAM with an upgraded nVidia 8400GS low profile (I added that). </s>
<s> The rest of the specs can be found at the hp site. </s>
<s> Downgrading from Vista to XP on a machine that has never had XP installed on it is full of difficulties. </s>
<s> If you look in CNET's Windows Vista or Windows XP forums you will find many similar requests for help, eg here; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-12546_102-0.html?forumID=133&threadID=243153&messageID=2460401 Mark </s>
<s> You have to be aware of what drivers to get and usually the support website is helpful, but NOT in the case of Vista to XP. </s>
<s> Basically, if you know exactly what chipset of main chip is installed you can try to load drivers from the vendors, makers or generic type support websites. </s>
<s> So, if your chipset XYZ-5 and find drivers that suggest they support XYZ-5 even if Vista or XP, good, but usually that's an open question to resolve. </s>
<s> Vista is far more picky or stricter to standards and may not allow thier use within XP or simply state for Vista use only, but you can always try. </s>
<s> Your best bet is to *not* use the install pgm. </s>
<s> for such drivers but rather point to the dir. </s>
<s> such drivers are located to see if they take. </s>
<s> The results vary, so beware of that. </s>
<s> The more popular, the better the chances of acceptance or greater support. </s>
