i have 2.8 ghz computer using windows xp with a 80gb hard drive partioned into 15gb and 65gb.
my hard drive &quot;c&quot;(15 gb drive) is full and i have multiple error messages.
what would be the best way to restore the computer to it's original state(like out the box).
would you recommend a system restore or would you recommend reformatting and reloading the disc.
can you give me detailed instructions on reformatting and reloading the os.
thanks for your help.
