<s> I am considering purchasing a Dell 9100 with the specs shown below. </s>
<s> I primarily use this as a home office machine, but also do some multimedia encoding and burning. </s>
<s> I play games occasionally, but not often, but might play more in the future. </s>
<s> I can get this for around $1500. </s>
<s> Any thoughts or advice? </s>
<s> I know from reading the board some hate Dell, but I have used them for work and they seem to be fairly reliable. </s>
<s> Lastly, this is probably more machine then I need at the time, but I want this sucker to last at least 3-4 years without having to replace it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> If you are buying from the home division of Dell, I wouldn't recommend it. </s>
<s> Dell Consumer Ratings: http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1867.html But if is is the Small Business division, then I would recommend it, as I had no problems with systems at work or in school. </s>
<s> computer company comparisons. </s>
<s> It may be good for rating individual items or stores, but not comparing Dell against others companies. </s>
<s> For instance who is the best pick if ResellerRating is used...appears to be Dell: Dell 3.83 http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1867.html Gateway 2.25 http://www.resellerratings.com/seller2053.html Emachine 2.59 http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1195.html Sony 3.35 http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1640.html HP and Pavilion could not be rated as Reseller Ratings gives ratings of 233 individual stores for HP, and 595 stores for Pavilion. </s>
<s> I usually don't have confidence in these type comparisons, because most people who are satisfied do not write in. </s>
<s> The ones that appear in a actual company review appear to be sorted by the company to show their good side or best foot forward. </s>
<s> Dell is the largest producer of computers in the world and would naturally have a lot of complaints, but percentage wise is no different than any other company. </s>
<s> The off shore support is a big current complaint against Dell. </s>
<s> JR I do not own a Dell and have no stock/connections what-so-ever with any computer company. </s>

<s> Dell is no worst than any other company. </s>
<s> They are the largest producers of computers in the world, so naturally percentage wise will get more complainers. </s>
<s> Their off-shore support leaves something to be desired, but there can be a workaround. </s>
<s> Dell will change their online prices and supposedly 'free' give-aways every week, usually or Wednesdays and Thursdays. </s>
<s> The shuffle goes on that I have observed for several years, and if you miss a good deal this week, like a 'free' 17&quot; or 19&quot; LCD, or DVD upgrade or RAM upgrade, or Hard Drive upgrade, or free shipping, just wait awhile, some several weeks and the deal you wanted will come by again. </s>
<s> The 9100 series are Dell's latest Dual Core w/64-bit and can be configured (customized) quite well. </s>
<s> You may want to also look at both Gateway and HP/Pavilion new dual core (EM64T) offerings with comparable prices. </s>
<s> Local weekly sales (Sunday Flyers) at Best Buy, Circuity City, and CompUSA usually have some very good buys at reasonable prices with combinations of LCD or CRT Monitors and color Printers. </s>
<s> Everyone thanks for your input. </s>
<s> I agree that some of these ratings cannot be trusted in that typically the folks that post to these boards are the ones that are dissatisfied and not the ones that are happy. </s>
<s> I am not an expert, but from what I have read the 9100 seems like a decent machine and the price seems reasonable for this configuration. </s>
<s> I just wanted to get some expert advice from board members before making the purchase. </s>
<s> of negative press one way or the other, I would also look at the HP Pavilion line. </s>
<s> I have had prettty good luck with HP and their offshore support. </s>
<s> The other machine I had my eyes on was the HP d4100y which received good reviews on Cnet and PCmagazine. </s>
<s> The reason I am strongly considering the Dell is I think the price is good for the configuration I stated. </s>
<s> I also get besides the usual Dell discount a small discount because the company I work for has an employee discount program with Dell which saves me about an additional $100. </s>
<s> m02499 I've previously owned two Dells and have never had a problem with them. </s>
<s> I'm about to order a Dell 9111 configured very closely to what you described. </s>
<s> If you buy retail you get the configuration they have on shelf. </s>
