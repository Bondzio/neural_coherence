i did a full restore of my ibm thinkpad laptop.
everything went fine with this, but when windows boots up my mouse does not work.
i have tried plugging in an external mouse, but this does not seem to work either.
when you first boot up the computer you can got into a program called &quot;access ibm&quot; (basically a pre-installed computer diagnostic program).
in this program that mouse works fine, however as soon as windows boots up the mouse does not respond to anything can anyone please help?
?
