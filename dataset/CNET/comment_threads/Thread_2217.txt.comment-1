Hi, Need some help here.
I can't seem to turn on the computer sometimes, although I keep pressing the power on button.
Sometimes, it works, and the computer works fine.
What do you guys think is the problem?
Im a newbie at this, so I 'd like to know what is the likely cause before I take the thing to pieces.
Thanks for replying!!
