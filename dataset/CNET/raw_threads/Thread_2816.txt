I am going to use Arconis True Image to clone the disk and I was wondering if anyone had any issues cloning a partition from a larger disk to a smaller disk? Would any data be potentially lost even though the PATA drive is only about 20-25GB full right now?

You shouldn't have too any trouble. My best advise would be to just take your time and double check your setting before you execute the job. BWG MS-IT
