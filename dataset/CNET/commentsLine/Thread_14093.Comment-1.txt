what is the main difference in performance between ata hdds and sata hdds?
do you notice the difference?
i know there is some difference in speed, but i wonder if the common user has any need for the sata drives.
the difference in price isn't a lot, but if the difference in speed isn't to be noticed, i don't find a reason to get a sata drive as of now.
tnak you all in advance.
