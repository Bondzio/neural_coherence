<s> I just purchased a new Dell PC which runs Windows Vista. </s>
<s> I would like to connect the harddrive from my previous PC (running XP) to the harddrive for my new PC (running Vista). </s>
<s> After connecting the harddrives, how would I go about formatting the secondary harddrive? </s>
<s> Do I simply right-click the drives that appear and click format? </s>
<s> After formatting, how do I partition new drives for the harddrive? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Start Settings Control Panel Administrative Tools Computer Management Disk Management Right click on the newly added drive....select Delete Partitions or FORMAT depending on what you want to do. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>

<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I'll let you know once I connect them. </s>
<s> By the way, if I don't format the secondary harddrive can I use it to multi-boot to Vista or XP? </s>
<s> thru the BIOS. </s>
<s> I'm sure there's multi-boot SW you could use to do it too VAPCMD </s>
