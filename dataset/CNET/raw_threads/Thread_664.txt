The right hand hinge has broken and I have dismantled the machine,successfully removed the bezel from the screen and removed the offending bit of hinge. All has gone very well. However, I have discovered a small hexagonal &quot;pillar&quot; with a magnet fixed inside the top and a screw thread on the opposing side. The magnet is the same size as the four that sit inside the plastic frame, which in turn sits inside the case. I don't recall unscrewing this - I noted that a number of screws were a little loose, so in moving the innards I may have disturbed it. Anyway - anyone have any idea where it goes? Thanks

Have had a good look and it does not show up on there - however, it just might be possible it is the part which connects with the hexagonal nut removed when taking off the airport cage - it refers to the nut, but not what is on the other side. Thanks.

Hi - yes I came across the site as I was looking for instructions for dismantling - I was led to it by another one by this guy : http://mywebpages.comcast.net/macdan/tibook_display.html His advice on how to remove the display bezel was spot on and I managed to get mine of without any damage at all. I have to say I was originally intending to send just the screen off, but thought I could save a bit by trying to do it myself. Am waiting for a new stainless steel hinge from the powerbookguy - then all I have to do is source suitable glues. In the meantine I have managed to identify the part - it isn't actually referred to in the ifixit guide, but through a process of elimination I have determined where it goes, partly supported by the ifixit picture of the modem board..... Thanks again!!

That nut, fills in the gap between the bevel, and the screen . Hard to explain. It goes in the middle. If it's not there, and screw it back too tight, you will bend the frame...it's to provide resistance, and stop it from caving in when you screw it down. Doe.. not making any sense. I tried.
