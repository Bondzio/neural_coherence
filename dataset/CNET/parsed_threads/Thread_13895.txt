<s> You could have a weak or failing PSU(power supply) or the infamous bad caps on mtrbd.. Google(for example) for bad caps, but inspect the mtrbd. </s>
<s> for leaking, distorted or bulging caps(capacitors). </s>
<s> Since, you have a 1.8Mhz system that suggests you had it for awhile as that's dated and/or been around. </s>
<s> In that time the PSU has aged and possibly on its last legs. </s>
<s> The bad caps is known problem from bad manufacture of caps. </s>
<s> In either case, replace, I suggest the PSU, first unless you see bad caps. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> hopefully i wud b able to use the information....i changed my psu 6 months bak...do u think changing it again wud help?? </s>
<s> can u plz provide me some more info on bad caps (y do this happen n wut r the remedies)...do i needta chnge my mtrbrd? </s>

<s> Take out that new PSU and put back in the old one. </s>
<s> Does the same thing happen? </s>
<s> my old psu gt completely busted...it gt burnt quite bad 6 months ago..i dnt thnk i can get tht bak. </s>
<s> Sine you mentioned you replaced the old PSU 6mos. </s>
<s> ago you maybe experiencing a 2ndary problem. </s>
<s> The final act of a dying system. </s>
<s> I can't guarantee the new PSU will fix it, it's just a course of action to take when the system won't power-ON. </s>
<s> All too often when a burnt PSU as you say, it could very well weaken or stress or outright take another compoment or device with it, if not now, later. </s>
<s> try: www.badcaps.com for examples. </s>
<s> YES, a bad caps situation can be corrected, but only if you're capable and/or allow a local source to fix it. </s>
<s> If outside repair, it maybe more practical to just buy another mtrbd.. for money better spend. </s>
