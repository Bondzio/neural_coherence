the ibm boxes you refer to are now lenovo - or china's best kept secret!
or are you referring to older ibm machines prior to the sale; with that i agree with everything you say -- i have 3 older laptops - they just work and i have never had a problem; plus i like the &quot;tracking&quot; device in the middle of the keyboard.
