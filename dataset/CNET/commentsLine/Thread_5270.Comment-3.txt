looks like this discussion has been dormant since 2004. my hd has worked well, with some minor os tweaks on a toshiba 1905 satellite for several years using the firewire port with xp sp2 os.
now trying to get a new gateway laptop to recognize (running vista os)on gateway firewire port with no luck.
have read the referenced link but does not appear to apply.
open to suggestions.
thanks!
