1.1.1	I bought a Canon MP530 and I hate it .	St
1.1.2	I 'm a female and I do n't know much about computers and printers but I had a Canon Multipass that lasted me 10 years and I loved it so I figured I would buy another .	St
1.1.3	I refilled those cartridges on the old multipass to death and they worked fine .	St
1.1.4	Now I find out that Canon has installed a & quot ; smart chip & quot ; in their printers and you can not refill a cartridge .	St
1.1.5	I can not afford these cartridges each time I am out of ink , I will go broke .	St
1.1.6	I tried all the tricks to reset the printer that are suggested on blogs on the internet and nothing works .	St
1.1.7	The printer will no longer print at all because it thinks the cartridge is out of ink even though I refilled it .	St
1.1.8	I 'm pissed at the company that sold me $ 50+ worth of refill kits as they knew these could not be refilled .	St
1.1.9	I have to buy another inexpensive all in one printer that works well and I know for sure you can refill the cartridges .	Sug
1.1.10	Can anyone please make a suggestion ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thank so much , Rosey	St
1.2.1	For instance at home , office and labs we use the HP k550 and its successors and for scanning we use those freely gifted scanners that people ca n't seen to get working ( freecycle on google . )	St
1.2.2	Those under 99 buck printers are shortlived affairs so I never note any of them and about refilling .	St
1.2.3	That had to end since people would refill then call in for support .	St
1.2.4	Sadly the fallout was the chip .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the suggestion Bob but yes , I really do need an all in one for home use .	St
1.4.1	Go to the store , see what 's offered then back to the internet for reviews .	St
1.4.2	Keep in mind that refills are rare now .	St
1.5.1	Bob do you know if these chip resetters really work ?	Ques
1.5.2	Looking on line and they run about $ 70 .	St
1.5.3	Read in a few blogs that people bought them and they worked but they are not available here in the USA .	St
1.5.4	Have to buy from ebay seller in Germany .	St
1.5.5	A little apprehensive about that but it would certainly solve my problem with the Canon .	St
1.6.1	All the clients I have do n't have time to fiddle with those things .	St
1.6.2	They may work but when it does n't the time lost makes any savings vanish .	St
1.6.3	The lessons in the field have me using cartridges from Amazon for the price and never bothering with refill kits .	St
1.6.4	My costs are not very high at all .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	If you do a lot of printing , say 500 or so a month , you would be better off going to a Laser printer instead of an inkjet .	St
1.7.2	The most ink forgiving inkjet printers are probably the HP units that use the 02 series cartridges ( more for home use ) or the 88 series ( geared more toward light office use ) Kodak has a couple of all in ones that are claimed to be much cheaper to run but there have been some software issues with them , supposedly the glitches have been worked out .	St
1.7.3	But again , for quantity a Laser is more efficient but way more expensive ( especially color all in ones } and the cartridges are pricey .	St
1.8.1	With Epson they are necessary and , for the most part , work very well .	St
1.8.2	Just note there are several versions out there as Epson continually updates their smart chips , so be sure you get the right one .	St
1.8.3	( Personally , I 've never been a fan of Epson printer quality , though . )	St
1.8.4	For HP , Cannon , and Lexmark , though , such devices or software packages are often difficult to find and , in truth , frequently scams .	St
1.8.5	The little 'tricks ' of covering specific contacts on the ink cartridge before reinserting in a certain pattern have n't failed me yet .	St
1.8.6	However , the 'tricks ' still do not enable you to use a cartridge past its expiration date .	St
