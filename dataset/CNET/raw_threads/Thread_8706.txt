I can play a CD and hear it but as far as listening to i tunes or a web based video no sound comes across. I have looked under control panel and everything seems OK except in the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties, no Audio device is found. There are no conflicts under System Properties. I have not added any no hardware or software. Does anybody know what could be up? Has anyone seen an algorithmic/flow chart approach to debugging problems like this? Any easy way to test a sound card?

But read my cheap fix at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6121_102-0.html?messageID=3229136&tag=forums06;search-results#3229136 Given how cheap these are, no one tests them. Bob
