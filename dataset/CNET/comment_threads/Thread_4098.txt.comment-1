Hi, I just finished building my first operational PC.
Here are the specs: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ XFX nForce 750a SLI Patriot DDR2 PC6400 800 Mhz 2x2048 1 250g WD HDD 1 320g WD HDD Windows Vista Ultimate x86 Everything is going fine withe exception of configuring the eSATA port to work with an external hard drive that I have.
I installed a sata cable and connected it to one of the available sata ports on the mobo and the other end to the port just behing the esata port.
No joy.
PC doesn't recognize it.
I'm thinking that there may be something that I need to do in BIOS but have no idea what it is.
Any suggestions?
Thanks
