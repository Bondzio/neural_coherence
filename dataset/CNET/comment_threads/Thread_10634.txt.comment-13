We went to T-Mobile store and told them we were disgusted that we bought these phones for the wi-fi at home and it didn't work... and they gave us 2 routers (NO CHARGE) - one for home and one for our daughter to take back to college (where hers didn't work either) and...
ta-da!!!
Wi-fi at home...SUCCESS!!!!
