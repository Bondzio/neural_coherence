i've never received anything above 8mbps and that is tops.
i just had a conversation with comcast this morning to vent a little.
it's frustrating that no matter where i've lived, i've never gotten what i pay for.
and of course, they have no problem taking payment for no or lack of service.
i guess i can't complain to much, at least it's fast enough to stream hd movies to my tv.
that's the big deal.
then again, if rush hour traffic hits in my building then i'll end up with a butt load of buffers.
