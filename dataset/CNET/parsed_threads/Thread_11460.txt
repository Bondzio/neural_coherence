<s> I'm upgrading my failing, but still operational, 40GB Maxtor HD to a 120GB Samsung Spinpoint. </s>
<s> I've hooked both hard drives up inside my computer and loaded the new one with Windows XP. </s>
<s> I wan't to transfer all the data, programs, files and settings, from the old hard drive to the new one. </s>
<s> I'm not completely computer illeterate but this is the first time I'm trying something like this and would like to know the easiest way to accomplish it. </s>
<s> I used the Windows backup utility to make a backup of all the old HD's data to the new hard drive's desktop but I&quot;m sure if that does any good. </s>
<s> In short, I use NORTON'S GHOST to do such a transfer. </s>
<s> I've yet to see such a feat accomplished with XP's backup. </s>
