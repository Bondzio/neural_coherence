Well, I dont have the computer with me since I need to do an RMA for the mobo, however I believe the temps were always acceptable and pretty decent with only the two 120mm fans...
I just thought if I could improve them any more, why not go the extra step sort of thing.
Also, there is a bunch of small punch outs at the top for the fans to pull air/exaust out of... Would it be wise to completely block those off?
I read somewhere that having those holes punched at the top can screw with the way the air circulates.
Im trying to get any tips or suggestions now so when I re-assemble the computer I wont have to go back in and potentially have something else break unexpectedly on me
