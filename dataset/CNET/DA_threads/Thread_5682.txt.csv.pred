1.1.1	Bought a Sony VAIO VGN-BZ12VN 2 months ago from http://www.okobe.co.uk The backlight has packed up.	St
1.1.2	I read some reviews last week on the Sony VAIO VGN-BZ12VN and other people have reported an issue with the backlight.	St
1.1.3	Is there anyone else who has had a similar issue or knows if this is a common problem or fault with this model of the Sony Vaio?	Ques
1.1.4	The Vaio's are expensive so am disappointed that the backlight went wrong so quickly.	St
1.1.5	I purchased a much cheaper Acer from Okobe at the same time as the Sony and the Acer still works perfectly.	St
1.2.1	This happened to me too!	St
1.2.2	I bought a Sony Vaio laptop and the backlight went after 5 months.	St
1.2.3	I contacted the company I bought it from and they said that it had to go to the manufacturer.	St
1.2.4	I contacted Sony and was asked to send it back to them.	St
1.2.5	They repaired it and so far so good (its been 6 months since then).	St
1.2.6	I was upset though as it cost so much more.	St
