I'm trying to connect to a router that i didnt set up. Its a vigor2820 I have the ip address (192.168.0.1). I have confirmed this as the default gateway by running ipconfig/all from the command prompt. It pings fine. However, when i type the ip address into my browser it pauses for a while but doesn't load the login screen. It just searches for a while and comes up with nothing. I know I am typing the ip address in correctly as i am connecting to other routers fine. I believe I am on the same subnet also. As a disclaimer I am bit of a noob so apologies in advance if this is a common issue to which solutions are widely available. Thanks Jon

Some folk change the setup page to be at a different port. Some change it so you can't set it up via WiFi. Fix? I reset the router to it's factory defaults then start over. Bob
