1.1.1	continuation of : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html ? forumID=26 & threadID=92877 & start=0 re : computer shuts down ( apparently due to overheating ) while idle .	St
1.1.2	I installed a new power supply today -- and watched the cpu temp climb from 97.7 to 122F in one minute while the computer was idle .	St
1.1.3	CPU fan is working and was rated for this cpu .	St
1.1.4	I would really prefer to have this computer to work without a babysitter .	St
1.1.5	Thanks for the great ideas , but what to do now ?	Ques
1.1.6	The new power supply seems more robust than the old one so that 's something at least ... . System : Abit Kv7-v mobo AMD 2900 cpu 450 watt power supply ( newly replaced . )	St
1.1.7	512 mb ddr 400/pc3200 ram Radeon 7000 series video card/64mb ddr onboard AGP sound card & lan card are on the motherboard .	St
1.1.8	Running xp pro sp2	St
1.2.1	power supply does not control the temp of the cpu ! .	St
1.2.2	you can buy a shim for the processor and use thermal grease to help the cpu heatsink and fan you currently if this does not help you can upgrade the heatsink and fan to a better and faster version .	St
1.2.3	then there is the noise level you must contend with .	St
1.2.4	reaserch the fans for noise and fan size and speed before you buy .	St
1.2.5	whats quite for me maybe unacceptable for you ! .	St
1.3.1	why not upgrade the CPU cooler ?	Ques
1.3.2	most are rated to a certain point , but end up running the CPU at high temps can you give us temp readings in C also , in F it really does n't help i 'd suggest the Thermalright SI-97 and a 92MM Panaflo High Speed ( i bought the U .	St
1.3.3	High Speed , because it was the same cost but the noise is a bit louder ) i 'd also consider the motherboard as the source of the problem the PSU does n't affect temps you need better cooling i 'd suggest this : http : //www.sidewindercomputers.com/thsiforamdat.html and either the Panaflo 92MM High Speed or 92MM Ultra High Speed ( Their the same price last i checked , so it 's really how much noise u wan na deal with ) http : //www.sidewindercomputers.com/arcemosi.html also get that yeah , it 's a lot of TIM more than you 'll probably ever use but the price is good , and you NEED A TIM do n't not get it GET THAT the SI-97 comes w/o a thermal pad as for a motherboard http : //www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp ? description=13-170-113 & depa=1 that should work great	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	One feature about an AMD processor is that it sits low in the Ziff socket .	St
1.5.2	The edge of the Ziff socket is slightly higher than the CPU chip surface .	St
1.5.3	The AMD Fan/Heatsink combo has a indented cut edge that allows the surface of the heatsink to touch the CPU surface .	St
1.5.4	If you reverse this heatsink , then the surfaces do not mate .	St
1.5.5	I have seen a half dozen motherboards that had the heatsink reversed and powered down because of inadequate cooling .	St
1.5.6	( The CPU Heat Diode worked ) .	St
1.5.7	Reversing the heatsink so that the cut edge fits over the Ziff socket raised edge solved the problem in every case .	St
1.5.8	Also you can not use a Pentium Fan/heatsink on an AMD because it has no cut edge .	St
1.5.9	Norm	St
1.6.1	mounting a Socket A HSF correctly takes a bit of force , i think it 'd crack the die before it 'd mount	St
1.7.1	First of all , thank you for all the time you put into your reply -- I appreciated having a specific example .	Polite
1.7.2	After reading your advice I went down to the computer store and bought the biggest monster fan with heatsink that would fit .	St
1.7.3	It looks like there is a jet engine on it !	St
1.7.4	But after I installed it -- I had new problems .	St
1.7.5	The computer now powers on but does not boot .	St
1.7.6	Everything lights up , it makes happy noises but nothing -- no beeps , no video , nothing .	St
1.7.7	I changed out video card , reset the mobo , checked the fitting on everything -- I even disconnected the extra drives thinking that maybe this new heatsink uses too much power .	St
1.7.8	Nothing changes .	St
1.7.9	The new fan has 2 plugs , one that goes to the mobo and another 4 pin that I plugged in to power it .	St
1.7.10	It does light up and spin .	St
1.7.11	I have not tried reinstalling the old fan yet -- working with those stupid clips makes me crazy .	St
1.7.12	I will tackle that tomorrow .	St
1.7.13	I will be ordering a new mobo on Monday .	St
1.7.14	I think by the time I 'm done I will have bought enough parts for 2 computers ... .	St
1.8.1	I 've done it once before -- but not this time .	St
1.8.2	I 'm very careful to check now .	St
1.8.3	I hate those stupid clips -- they have got to come up with a better method .	St
1.8.4	Thanks for the input .	St
