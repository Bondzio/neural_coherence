Recommendation still same..SFF is a poor choice for system longevity and reliability.
Too much heat in too small a space and not many ways to efficiently eliminate it.
SFF severely limits HW options ...HS Fans, GPUs, PSUs, etc., in the event of component failure beyond warranty.
VAPCMD PS...I'm not far behind you age wise but wouldn't consider SFF unless I needed portability.
The smallest I buy for anything is a mid tower with plenty of drives bays for drive spacing/separation, cooling and ease of access in the event I need to repair or replace a component.
