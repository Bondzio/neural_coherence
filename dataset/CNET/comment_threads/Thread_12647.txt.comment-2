I am in the same market, but my own experience can tell you one thing.
*** DO NOT BUY LEXMARK PRINTERS ***.
The color quality is sub-par at best, the inkjet cartridges are tiny (300 prints max per cartridge) and most printouts have a faded appearance, no matter how hard you &quot;tweak&quot; the printer settings.
That's why they literally THROW these printers at your when you buy PC's from any BigBox store.
So, anyone else got advice??
?
