My question is, does someone have a configuration of all the parts that would make a good PC for gaming and media use? Thanks. I'm looking to buy all the parts off of newegg.com. Thanks!

The case: Are you going to upgrade: More CD/DVD drives? More HDs? If so I would go for the full. If your fine with your current rig, then a mid is fine. Also I think that a Full-Tower case would have better cooling. Also the AIW cards by ATI have some TV Tuner capabilites. -Ibrahim

I'm surprised, as most people despise IDE, but there isn't anything wrong with IDE or Ultra-ATA IMO. Also, I would note that people have had software problems with Windows Media Center and ATI All-In-Wonder cards. I personally would just buy a TV tuner card and graphics card seperately. Or maybe it's just becuz I don't like ATI, lol. It is also possible to buy just the ATI card and XP Home . Windows Media Center is ''over-hyped'' and has some issues like everything else from Microsoft lol. With the ATI software you will have the same capabilities as Media Center. Plus you will save $$$. Since you desire dual-core, with your socket 939 MOBO you can eventually upgrade to an AMD Athlon X2 cpu when the prices go down. So building your PC with an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ socket 939 is a good idea . It is a lower-end cpu and you do not need to spend $$$ on a 3500+ when your going to upgrade to dual-core. Good RAM and PS supply choice

That gives you the option of having a SATA Harddrive. SATA refers to how the hardware communicates or is connected to your Motherboard. SATA is supposed to be ''faster'' but its not really significantly. For more info google Serial-ATA or read this article at Tom's Hardware . Serial-ATA harddrives are alittle more expensive than IDE drives. The Western Digital Caviar SE 300GB 3.5'' IDE Ultra ATA100 Hard Drive you picked out is an Ultra ATA or IDE drive . So you could buy a SATA drive if you make that choice, but the one you picked out would work fine. Your choice! Also the SATA interface for CD and DVD drives is still IDE but you will find SATA is starting to emerge in some drives. Plextor makes some, they are $$$$. Hope that helps.

If you plan on upgrading to dual-core in the future, spending the extra on the 3500+ would be a waste, buy the 3000+. Theres a very nice BFG board w/ a 3000+ for $278.99 . If you want to buy a bundle. The Tech Report Theres a good review on your TV tuner card, looks like you picked the right 1, very nice. ''The eVGA NVTV, which also has low CPU utilization and great image quality, runs only $62 online and comes bundled with the NVDVD decoder, making it perfect for Media Center Edition and thus our Editor's Choice...'' You may also want to buy The Remote for MCE for $38.25 You could say money buy going with a smaller harddrive, lower wattage powersupply, or video card. The ATI Radeon X850XL is a good pick. Although, serious gamers will note that ATI's cards lack some technologies found in nVidia's stuff, it's your choice. Check out Tom's Hardware Graphics Benchmarks for comparisons. Other little things, you may also want a Ethernet card($20 bucks)for dsl/cable internet or a 56k modem for dial-up. If you want to keep your PC cool buy some extra fans and a CPU cooling fan. You could also get some Neon lights in there lol. Media-card reader? Overall, you have a nice computer here. Good job. Have fun putting it together.

I ended up with some issues that took awhile to figure out. I had a lot of fun getting my TV tuner, firewire card, 3D glasses, and RAID configured. I now know the biggest problem was Windows 98. XP makes all those things easier. Just remember you can always wipe and reinstall 'til you get it right. It just takes time and patience. Get in a hurry, you're doomed. On another note, I keep seeing Tiger Direct as a recommendation. Stick with Newegg, you don't want the hassles. Newegg, Zip Zoom Fly, and a new Chief Value will cover your needs with fast service and great prices. They don't rely on rebate lies for profit.

Make sure to get a cabinet type that will fit the mother board type such as an XT type ,micro ATX or AT ...It was a good thing I had the motherboard book, told me what type and size, I felt I was restricted to that, but the Computer cabinet I have could have taken the largest mobo without a problem - even the different mountings were marked for both mobo types!, but to me this was the key issue - to be able to drop in a motherboard replacement (4 studs and 3 re-uasable plastic support tabs)-that done I was up and running after processor with heatsink and fan, and RAM installation,......NEWEGG is positively great, delivery always on the money thru Fed-Ex, wait for the month end sales - very good deals, you can also read reviews on each product, most customers write about other components they matched stuff up with and how those work , this will give you plenty of ideas of what to buy and what will work together as soon as you plug it in. Beware, some components do not work well together in many cases that have been documented, there have been motherboard chipset issues with Hard Disk drives and bios setups that you can read about on websites such as techreport.com/reviews and techspot.com as well as informit.

DVD Burner = AOPEN 16X DVD Dual Layer Write with Nero & WINDVD Software However I'm thinking about the NEC from New Egg. OS= Win XP PRO (Thinking about Vista (Longhorn)). If you already have your own burning software then get Neweggs NEC DVD burner for $45 (or less). It's a bargin! BTW the MB comes with Norton Anti-Virus packaged in it. The ATI RADEON X800XL is capable of displaying true HD and comes with HD Cable and is compatible with ATI's Crossfire (ATI's version of SLI (Serial Link Interface)). The ATI HD All in Wonder allows S-Video/Cable and Antenna Input and acts as a PVR (TIVO without a charge!) With this MB you need 2 sticks of RAM PC3200 to make it work right (I chose 2 GB Kingston 1GB / Stick) The ANTEC Case comes with a 550 12V ATX Power Supply (has 24 pins to power PCI Express on Mother Board and it is Required). This is a Gaming machine, Audio/Video machine and Server (the MotherBoard has 2 Gb LANs)! New egg is the place to go!

I agree with the components, but, your estimated prices are a little high. I completed mine for under $700.00. Your much better off buying a case with the power supply you want included. My case and a 485 watt power supply at Tiger Direct cost $49.95. Also, it had a 100% rebate. I know that that is not always available. I've found from experience that Tiger Direct and New Egg are about the best sources on line. Tiger seems to have the best sales. Also, Computer Geeks are pretty good. You know the old saying: It pays to shop a round. Goodluck with your build. If you have an older computer, you'll be amazed with the speed. Jack (bad penny)

It just started beating itself to death from the inside. Since it was only about 1 1/2 years old they replaced it with a remanufactured unit. They certainly couldn't do anything about the 80 gigs of files I lost. I didn't do much backup thinking everything was fine, now I'll suffer for quite awhile. I'm still in shock at all I've lost. Now I just replaced a bad motherboard in a Presario 6000 to find the Maxtor HD is also trash. So far I've seen 2 out of 5 Maxtors go bad. I don't want to bash them, but all I've read recently coincides with my experience, and recommends Seagate for the best reliability and 5 year warranty. PEOPLE! BACK UP YOUR DATA!

However, many brick-and-mortar stores have REBATES that beat anything that online retailers can offer. Many times you can get a rebate on a retail version of a component cheaper than the OEM version offered online. Check online at places like CompUSA, Circuit City, Staples, etc. They usually update their offers every Sunday. You may not get the great rebate offer on the part when you want it, but you can save BIGTIME on a part or two. Only drawback is that you have to wait a few weeks for your savings to come in. Also, don't forget comparison shopping sites like PriceGrabber.com.
