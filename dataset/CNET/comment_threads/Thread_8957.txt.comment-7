I installed VIAUSB 2 drivers, (could not find any at ECS).Uninstalled USB in safe mode, they reinstalled etc.
still no change.
Any more ideas?
The computer knows it is a USB 2 device when I plug it into the hub so even if port was Usb 1 it should still find it and give same message, right?
Why would port find hub and not the enclosure??
I do not understand.
