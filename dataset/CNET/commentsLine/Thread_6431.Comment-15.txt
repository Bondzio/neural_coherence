you should know that if router is not set up to allow wireless login then it will deny you.
try to login to the router by directly connecting your computer (preferably the one you used on initial setup)to it.
normally, as others have pointed out, you just type in 192.168.1.1 to connect to the router via a web browser.
if this fails then you may have to reset the router so that you can login using the default username & password.
