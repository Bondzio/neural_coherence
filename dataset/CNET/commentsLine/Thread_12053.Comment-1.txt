i really dont know much about computers, i would definitely build my own gaming rig if i did.
if i had tons to spend i would go with something a site like falconnw or something, but im looking to spend around $850.
im looking at cyberpower, im thinking an amd phenomii x4 cpu with a radeon 5760 gpu.
1)is this pretty good for gaming?
if so, how long will it be sufficient for running most games?
2)what should i know about matching the mobo with the cpu, if the mb says amd...is that all i really need to worry about?
3)case size...i dont ever think i will need to run a setup with more than one gpu, i dont play high end fps titles.
can i just go with the default case?
4) what is an internal usb extension module?
what is a motherboard expansion card?
do i need these?
any help would really be appreciated, im in over my head a little
