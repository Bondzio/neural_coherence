<s> Sorry thats a pun...my query is about memory, i currently have 1 stick of memory in my machine - Kingston 256mb 333Mhz DDR PC2700 - What i'm confused about is the 333mnz and the PC2700 parts, i'm looking for more memory but i'm not sure if i need to buy the same i.e PC2700 and 333mhz, can i mix and match? </s>
<s> for instance the one i'm looking at is 512mb 400Mhz PC3200, will this have any effect. </s>
<s> Rnning: P4 2.4Gb and XP Pro. </s>
<s> Thanks Goofs </s>
<s> Well the answer is yes and know If you do indeed get different memory they might play together and they might not. </s>
<s> Through past experience this is the case. </s>
<s> If they do they will run at the slower of the two speeds, if they don't you have spent $ for just the 512 which should run ok on your machine, maybe . </s>
<s> I hope this helps and I don't seem like an idiot but this is just the way it works with memory. </s>
<s> SO for my $ I would match the memory. </s>
<s> The easy answer is there is no easy answer to your question. </s>
<s> Your best bet is to match what you have now but you can always refer to your mainboad specs for a better answer. </s>
<s> If your computer didn't come with a mainboard manual it's usally possible to look up the manual on-line. </s>
<s> Simply open up your computer and scan the motherboard for a manufaturer name and model number then do a google search or visit the manufacturers website. </s>
<s> If there doesn't appear to be a manufacturer name or model number look instead for an FCC ID number and go to the FCC ID website and type in the ID numbers for your mainboard. </s>
<s> You should be able to figure out who made your board and where their website is located from such a search. </s>
<s> I can tell you from experience that most newer mainboards require matched memory in banks. </s>
<s> For instance if you have 4 memory slots slots 1 and 3 must be a matched pair while slots 2 and 4 must be a pair also. </s>
<s> Though this varies from one manufacturer to another. </s>
<s> My current Asus A8N-Sli mainboard is really picky and not only requires matched pairs but only seems to work with certain brands of higher end memory. </s>
<s> The Asus website has a list of all the memory that is known to work with my board so I try to stick to that list. </s>
<s> I should probably mention that just because a computer came from Dell or Gateway or whoever that doesn't mean it's mainboard was manufactured by them. </s>
<s> In fact I don't think any major computer retailer makes their own mainboards. </s>
<s> They usually buy them in bulk from companies such as gigabyte or soyo. </s>
<s> Most decent mainboards will be marked with a manufaturer name and model number or FCC-ID. </s>
<s> I have run across a few mainboards without any identifying marks at all, not even an FCC-ID. </s>
<s> In this case you'll have to contact the system builder to ask them for specs on the mainboard. </s>
