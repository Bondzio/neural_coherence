glad to hear that she is still pounding the keyboard and breaking things.
I did a quick Google and found This place which not only sells replacement keyboards but replacement keys as well.
The price of a replacement, used, keyboard is not too high and individual keys are around $5 each.
Installation instructions are available there too.
