<s> I am trying to decide which video card is the best for overall gaming. </s>
<s> I have read reviews online but they all seem very biased to the card they are reviewing. </s>
<s> Any suggestions??? </s>
<s> My current pc specs are: Athlon XP 3000+ 1.3GB Ram nvidia 5900 250GB Hardrive </s>
<s> is more powerful and has sm 3.0. also, make sure you have a good psu. </s>
<s> you will most likely have to upgrade that first. </s>
<s> what is your psu? </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> thank you for the advise my current power supply is a 400watt, is that enough? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> can't afford a motherboard, cpu, and memory upgrade right now with a video card. </s>
<s> Need the AGP 8x until I can upgrade computer. </s>
<s> i didnt read ur specs so i didnt realize u were talking about AGP </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> after looking at the psu it is actually a 450watt. </s>
<s> The brand is a L&C. </s>
<s> It came with with my X-Blade Case. </s>
<s> but when u get more money then u should really upgrade the psu as most psus that come with the case suk </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The performance of the cards are very close and I think the X850 XT has a narrow lead over the 6800. </s>
<s> I would get the 6800 ultra because it supports shader model 3.0. </s>
<s> Just make sure you have TWO power connectors handy. </s>
<s> If you don't then the 6800 GT would be my next choice, which only needs one. </s>
<s> The card takes up 2 slots in the case. </s>
<s> Thank you to everyone that helped me make my decision. </s>
<s> I am going to purchase the 6800 Ultra. </s>
<s> I found a MSI 6800Ultra at newegg that came with 3games and a bunch of software for $416.00. </s>
<s> I also purchased a 550watt PSU just in case. </s>
<s> Again Thank you all... </s>
