&quot;the following symptoms apply to pavilion dv2000 and presario v3000 notebooks: * the notebook does not detect wireless networks and the wireless adapter is not detected in the device manager.
&quot; if hp will not correct this and their new bios does not help, go get an usb or wifi card and use that instead.
