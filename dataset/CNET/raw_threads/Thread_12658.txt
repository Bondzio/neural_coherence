However, all of them seem to require paper, which is something I definately don't want. Some E-readers like the iLiad have got a similar function, but they are expensive, and I don't need the E-reader functions. A PC-tablet is not an option, because I want it to function independantly from my laptop while still being able to see what I'm writing/doodling. Any suggestions?
