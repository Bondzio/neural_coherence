thank you kees for your advice.
i checked out crucial.com .
great site for these kind of things.
i am already deciding about two types of memory.
they are prety the same but they differ with &quot;speed&quot; [first one pc3-8500 ; second one pc3-1060] and in frequency [first one 1066 and second one 1333].
does these parameters matter a lot?
can i say, higher the better?
the price si same to the last cent.
thanks for your help.
oh btw, my os is win 7, 64bit
