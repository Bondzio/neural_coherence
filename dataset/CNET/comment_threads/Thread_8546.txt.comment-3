Sorry to confuse you, thanks for replying to my post!
My mac is connected to the modem, then connected to the router.
then I a cat5 cable is connected going from the router, to the pc.
I only have one router, everything is daisy chained to each other.
The pc has cat5 cable that goes from the to the router to the pc's port.
When I had the cable installed it was installed on my computer.
All did to get the pc online was plugin a cat5 cable.
I had to reset my router, and I think thats when the connection got lost on the pc.
I tried a repair option in windows, is there a way I can tell is what its ip address should be?
