<s> I just installed the above mentioned router/modem Model GT704WG and I have it connected to my laptop via ethernet cable. </s>
<s> It is working fine. </s>
<s> I don't have a wireless card in my laptop Gateway 600YGR. </s>
<s> What wireless card do I need? </s>

<s> It might give you the best range, and you wouldn't have an external device that you can lose. </s>
<s> Check with gateway to see if there is a recommended card: https://support.gateway.com/support/copilot/chat_sales.shtml?id=400010 There are many wireless-g PC Card/PCMCIA adapters and USB adapters in the stores. </s>
<s> You may want to avoid USB adapters if you need to use the ports for other things. </s>
<s> Also note that you have USB 1.1 ports (not 2.0), and some wireless adapters work best on USB 2.0 ports. </s>
