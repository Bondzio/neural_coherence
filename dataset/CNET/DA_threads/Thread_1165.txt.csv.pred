1.1.3	I have an intel network card , a GTX 460 graphics card .	St
1.1.4	I plan on adding a sound card sometime in the future , as well as a possible TV capture card .	St
1.1.5	Have had no problems with Gigabyte in past .	St
1.1.6	I am weary of Asus quality control but the extra features of their board are tempting including the 2 extra Sata3 ports , and the UEFI Bios .	St
1.1.7	Not sure if I need it so I would prefer to go with the board that is going to be more stable in the long run .	St
1.2.1	Are you going to play with the BIOS a lot ?	Ques
1.2.2	For simple oc , Giga is sufficient .	St
1.2.3	Asus tends to stuff a lot of extra features into their BIOS I have never found to be really useful and their downloads are damn annoying .	St
