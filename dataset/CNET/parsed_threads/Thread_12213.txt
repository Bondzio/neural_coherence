<s> ok I have 2 problems here I have a quantum bigfoot TX it is a huge harddrive. </s>
<s> I placed this into my old computer without any tab on the jumper settings and on the space farthest from the mother board on the ide cable when I go to boot the computer it says detting hdd primary slave QUANTUM Bigfoot TX4.BAT but says nothing about detecting the master then it says Primary master hard disk fail I have added the pin to the jumper settings in the back and set it to master but when I do this it says detecting primary master none detecting primary slave none then when I let it boot through it gives me a Disk I/O error Replace the disk and press any key the harddrive im putting in has no operating system on it </s>
<s> Try just one drive at a time. </s>
<s> Test as Master on the end black connector and the blue connector to the motherboard. </s>
<s> What happens? </s>

<s> what do you mean by the end black and blue conectors to the mother board and I am only using 1 drive. </s>
<s> &quot; what do you mean by the end black and blue conectors to the mother board and I am only using 1 drive. </s>
<s> &quot; I always use a shiny new 80 conductor IDE cable to make sure its not part of the issue. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
<s> Said cables are color coded so I noted which to use by color. </s>
<s> Best of luck, </s>
<s> The ide cables conected are new and conected properly but im still having this problem </s>
<s> it wont stop vewing my big foot hard drive as a slave drive evin when its the only hard drive hooked up to the system </s>
<s> You seem unsure what IDE cable type you have. </s>
<s> I know not everyone will be experts under the hood of the PC, but shrug that off and let's go to work. </s>
<s> You questioned me on the color of the IDE connections and that was my test and my clue that you likely have the older IDE cables. </s>
<s> If so, the setup can torture some owners. </s>
<s> Why not get a shiny new 80 conductor IDE cable with the black, blue and gray connectors and set the drive to CS (cable select) so we know where we are? </s>

<s> This computer is an old q systems. </s>
<s> When I plug in its old harddrive it boots just fine but its old hard drive was beat up and just stoped working so I tried my other working hard drive and it keeps thinking its a slave drive. </s>
<s> It only has this problem when I dont use its origional hard drive. </s>
<s> I'm still at the beginning with wondering what cable type and jumpers you use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Now im having other isues. </s>
<s> The ide cables are standered ide cables and I just use a little black pin that came with the hd. </s>
<s> Tell me what you set the drive to. </s>
