1.1.1	I just aquired an HP 7100 notebook and want to send printing wirelessly .	St
1.1.2	I have an Imac desktop which is connected to a wireless router from Roadrunner and I can not get the HP to tranfer what I want printed from a remote location .	St
1.1.3	The printer is an HP Photosmart model # 7960 which is connected by USB to the Imac which is running OX 10 .	St
1.1.4	The note book is running XP	St
1.2.1	I will not help on this one .	St
1.2.2	It 's too far out to help remotely since not only must you deal with cross-OS issues but the Wifi as well .	St
1.2.3	Unless you get lucky , you 'll either pay to have it setup or install a wifi USB printer server that supports your selected machines .	St
