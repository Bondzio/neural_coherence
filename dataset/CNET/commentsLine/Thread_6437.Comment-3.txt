my brother set up his house using a 4-way splitter and buying some coaxial cable, ran his cable from the lead cable in his living room to the computers in his house, using tv tuner cards, and everyone can watch what they want on their own computer (dont know how he did it or what hardware/software he used, but he can browse what channels he wants, depending on what his cable provider offers him).
it's really cool, but i don't know if it is legal to split it like that and without buying seperate cable boxes, but hey, pirated cable aint much worse than bearshare lol
