<s> Hi, I recently purchased a new graphics card and belatedly realized my PSU wasn't rated high enough. </s>
<s> Seeing that most decent new cards won't jive with my 300W PSU, I think I should upgrade, but haven't replaced PSUs before. </s>
<s> Who are the good manufacturers? </s>
<s> Any technical snafus I might run into? </s>
<s> What about fitting it into my case? </s>
<s> I know my old card is an ATX type. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Power supplies are however in the ATX form factor. </s>
<s> My advice to post the make, model of the PC. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
