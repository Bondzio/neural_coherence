<s> The unfortunate happended to me over the weekend. </s>
<s> I believe either my motherboard (Asus P4T533-C) or CPU chip (Pentium 4 2.8) died since my PC won't boot/POST. </s>
<s> My hard drives (2 Western Digital 120GB 7200RPM Hard Drives; 8MB Cache) are raid configured (no array; the drives act as a single drive) using a HighPoint RAID Controller Card (Rocketraid 133; a 2-channel ATA133 RAID adapter). </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions about whether I can put the two drives in an external enclosure and still access them using another PC (or an IMAC)? </s>
<s> I see a number of external enclosures that appear to be designed to accomidate raid drives but it is unclear with me if these will work. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> &quot;Will they show my existing data files?&quot; The answer from my experience is no. </s>
<s> I've yet to see many RAID arrays survive even when we move the drives to the same chipset and controllers. </s>
<s> This is a testament to the addage &quot;we only lose what we don't backup.&quot; But those external RAID capable NAS boxes do work. </s>

<s> That is what I fear. </s>
<s> Luckly I backed up about 80% of the data on an external hard drive about 7 months ago. </s>
<s> Of course, it was a one time thing so everything for the last 7 months has not been backed up. </s>
<s> What is an external RAID capable NAS? </s>
<s> Is it worth giving this option a shot? </s>
<s> If so, what are my options? </s>
<s> Any particular brand/model that is reasonably priced. </s>
<s> This is a world wide forum. </s>
<s> What I can get here in the USA may not be found in Australia. </s>
<s> You can use the usual search engines to find these products and then toss them up for comment by members. </s>
<s> To recover your lost files, the only method I find to work well is to repair the failed machine. </s>
<s> Could be cheap. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> you can probably recover your array. </s>
<s> put the card and drives in another pc and check if the controller card can still 'see' the raid volume. </s>
<s> if the card can't recognize it, neither will any other setup. </s>
<s> replacing the power supply. </s>
<s> Get a Power Supply Tester for $12-$15...like the one by CoolMax or UltraX. </s>
<s> I just helped replace the power supply in my daughter's PC....it started acting up and then just died. </s>
<s> Replaced the PS and all was well. </s>
<s> Hoping same for you...let us know. </s>
