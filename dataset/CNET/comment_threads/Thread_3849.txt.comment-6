&quot;I'm seeing entire drive contents vanish.
(Not mine, just people bring me these things.
)&quot; All the drive files vanish.
&quot;Always properly eject.
Please.&quot; Please shutdown properly.
&quot;Next look into some sync program like SYNCBACK.&quot; If you are using a drag and drop method like Explorer, look up SYNCBACK on google.com It may help you get what you wanted done.
&quot;In closing since the filesystems may differ, byte counts can differ.&quot; Here's a Wikipedia on filesystems since it's too big for me to put here and I can't condense it to one line.
