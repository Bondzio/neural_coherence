But they say I can buy one from a third party, & they'll hook it up for $25. I'd like to be able to buy & intall one myself, but I'm not sure which type I'll need, which manufacturer is best. Gateway, 2 Wire, or whichever company can provide the cheapest that will do the job. I am a senior citizen, running MAC OSX10.4.11. Can anyone advise me? Every penny counts. THANX

So while hookup is a breeze sometimes they must do that step if a wiring change is required in some external box. But you should be able to install the thing. But back to setup. I can't count how many know knowthing about PPPoE. If you don't you may not be ready to install. Bob

I want to try it myself on this phone line from Mickey Mouse telecom, but I need to know what type wireless DSL modem works best with my MAC OS. This phone company charges $19.99 per month for dial-up so slow that the connection times out before pages load. Its cost for the &quot;light&quot; (cheapest) DSL is $29.99, + $3.99 for modem rental. I'll only use it for 6 mos of my one year mandated contract, so instead of paying $33.98 a month for 12 months, I'll effectively be paying $67.96 per month actual usage. Mickey Mouse telecom has no provision for temporarily suspending service, as other companies do. I don't want to pay them 1 cent more than necessary!!
