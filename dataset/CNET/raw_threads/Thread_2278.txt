I am planning on building a cheap budget gaming computer. This computer is not intended for extreme gaming like far Cry or Call of Duty 2, just games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and other basic games. I already have the follow: eVGA Geforce 6200 AGP 8x Reusing a 40GB HDD Windows XP Home DVD ROM Aspire X-Alien Case (Not the $135 one, the steel one.) All products above and below will be purchased from Newegg.com , the best site on the net for computer parts!!!! Anyways.................. My question is will this motherboard and CPU work together; also, will this memory be compatible with the mb and CPU? Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131549 and Processor (CPU): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819104249 Memory: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?item=N82E16820141433 Thank You very much CLuchetti Any recommendations are welcome. Thanks again
