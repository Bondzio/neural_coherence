You're on the right track I think.
Your broadband modem should connect to a standard wireless router, your choice of brand (I have a Buffalo for that too...).
The router, though labeled &quot;wireless&quot;, will have 4 switched wired ports on the back too.
I don't know if the router mass market has rolled over to gigabit yet, but for incoming internet, that's not gigabit speed anyway.
Uplink the router to one port of a healthy-sized gigabit switch (i.e., enough ports to cover all the wired needs plus more for the future inevitable expansion) and then let'er rip.
