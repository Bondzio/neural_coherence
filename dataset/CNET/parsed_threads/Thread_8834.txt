<s> My daughter has a desktop system that's several years old and is now relatively slow. </s>
<s> It's got a 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 CPU and 512 MB memory. </s>
<s> I could replace the CPU with a 3 GHz for about $100 but would that alone be enough? </s>
<s> More memory may or may not help. </s>
<s> I'm willing to spend several hundred dollars, but how can I get the most bang for my buck? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If you're willing to spend that much, your best bet may be to simply buy a new computer. </s>
<s> For $300-$400 after rebates you can have a new system with a 64-bit AMD 3400 or better processor, 160GB hard drive, and occasionally even 1GB of RAM. </s>
<s> You could give the new one to her and then clean out the old one and use it as a secondary computer. </s>
<s> Other thoughts include: 1.) </s>
<s> What tasks is she performing? </s>
<s> That computer may just need a tuneup depending on the task at hand. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> Are you sure that computer can even be upgraded to a 3.0GHz Pentium 4? </s>
<s> Name the make and model to be sure. </s>
