i can't stand decaf.
i am a huge coffee fan and prefer only caffinated.
i drink a fair share of it in a day but still have patients for a 16x among many other things.
if anyone has seen that guy from mad tv(i think), the caffine junky with the bulging eyes, yeah that's me.
of course i am not one of those sit in my chair and watch the progress bar(no offense to those who do).
the old saying, a watched pot never boils.
decaf?
yuck!
do they still use embalming fluid in that stuff?
