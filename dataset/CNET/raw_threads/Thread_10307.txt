Today I have suddenly ran into one. After restarting my computer the drive no longer shows up in Windows Explorer. Device manager shows the drive as connected and working properly. The problem is not just with windows explorer. For example, if I try to play a song on iTunes (all of my music is stored on that drive), iTunes can no longer find the song file. I have restarted my computer and switched usb ports but neither step helped. I am running XP SP2. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Dan
