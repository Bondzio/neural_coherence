i reread your post, looked at the picture and can't see why i'd repair this.
-&gt; let's be clear about what you want to do here.
if it's working, why fix this?
if you want to add that 5.12gb to the &quot;winblows&quot; partition, i think only a few simple steps might be needed.
now i have to repeat the &quot;backup first&quot; everytime we write about such things but my thoughts are this.
1. in disk management, delete the 5.12gb parition.
(maybe the other one too?)
2. we want to have unallocated space.
i can't explain why so many times people can't or won't do this step.
they continually make a partition rather than leaving it unallocated.
now we might be ready for gparted to grow the winblows partition.
you would also be ready for a nearly painless install of most linux distros.
