<s> I snapped the tab off my network cable today. </s>
<s> Just caught it on something the wrong way I guess and POP it came right off. </s>
<s> I guess it doesn't happen all the time, but i feel like it happens more than it should. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a good sturdy cable that maybe doesn't have a tab to lock it in? </s>
<s> I had the same problem, although it happened to me more often. </s>
<s> I was pretty rough with my cables and the tabs always popped off in my bag on the way to class. </s>
<s> Now I get my network cables from www.tendonusa.com They have a tab protector thing that works really well. </s>
<s> They were inexpensive too. </s>
<s> Try them out, you won't be sorry. </s>
<s> if you goto a big electronics store like bestbuy circut city and maybe fry's electronics, if you live near one, if you look at the network cables they are either bare or have a little rubber shield over the end. </s>
<s> there are many out there and just as cheap as bare ones. </s>
<s> other solution: tape that suckuh into the socket! </s>
<s> good luck </s>
