it's about half way down the page but you can google the setting i'm changing to get vista to connect.
here's the words -&gt; vista broadcast flag.
sure you can argue that it connects at home.
all that will do is have me tell you to replace your wifi router, wap or upgrade the firmware on the waps.
btdt, hope you fix it fast now.
