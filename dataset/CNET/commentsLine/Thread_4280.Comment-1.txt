so after 6 years of ownership of a now sluggish and ancient dell dimension e520, i've decided it's easier to run a clean install of vista to boost performance rather than bother with uninstalling programs, etc.
my question is, should i still use the 250 gb seagate barracuda 7200.10 hard drive that came with the system?
or am i rolling the dice by doing a fresh install on a drive that old?
i bought a new wd 1tb 7200 caviar blue to add as a 2nd drive for storage, but now i'm wondering if i should use it instead as my primary drive and use the 6-year-old drive for extra storage.
what do you all think?
