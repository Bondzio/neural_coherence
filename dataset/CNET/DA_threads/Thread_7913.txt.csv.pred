1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimm 4700 Windows7 P4 2.8 4GB Bios A06 Believe it has a AGP Radeon X300/X550/X1050 in it Don't want to spend alot, fry anything, nor do any big time gaming.	St
1.1.2	My question is; What is a decent cheap low power option, and will I see any difference (will it help at all) Thanks!	St
1.2.1	300 watts	St
1.3.1	Not much choices at such a low PSU.	St
1.3.2	We can't be sure how many spare Watts are available for the new card.	St
1.3.3	Yes the old card is sadly unknown so we have to guess a little and hope that the usual PCIe GT220 1GB card will do fine.	St
1.3.4	Here the total power draw from my kid's HP d5000t is at 100 Watts when gaming so it should be fine.	St
1.3.5	Look for them on amazon, newegg and such sites.	St
1.3.6	Example at http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-nVidia-GeForce-PCI-Exp There are far too many dimension models so be sure yours has a full height PCIe slot.	St

1.4.1	My video card is the old AGP style (not pci) I don't believe I am pulling to many watts, although I may repalce the PSU in the future, maybe at the same time I have been looking for an AGP that can do windows 7 Anyway, my main question is will I see any big difference for everyday computing (surfing / email) or is the video card really just for gaming?	St
1.4.2	I may do some basic video rediting (cam corder family movies), does it help this?	St
1.5.1	For video editing, playback even the old fx6200 is OK.	St
1.5.2	I won't write again about what a video card does but today we have GAMING and we have AERO and then the rest.	St
1.5.3	Since you just need the basics without gaming let's find some AGP card that's not bottom of the barrel without a big power draw.	St
1.5.4	How about http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187122 Read the comments and you find folk do use this on Windows 7.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	AGP and windows 7 is the tough part I found ATi Radeon HD3450 512mb gddr2 AGP 8x Windows 7 capatible, does say 64 bit mem bus, my sys is 32 bit Does that matter?	St
1.6.2	only calls for a 250 PSU but, it's $65, about 20 more than I wanted (beggars can't be choosy!)	St
1.6.3	Thanks all, will I see a big diffrence visually?	St
1.6.4	Or is it more the abuility to do things faster etc Just tryiong to upgrade a dinosaur for under a hundred and fifty bucks maxed out ram and bigger HD for $90, and wanted a card for about 40 Is upgrading the power supply only for the vid card, is there any other reason to?	St
1.6.5	?	Ques
1.7.1	The 3450 ain't bad but you are pushing your luck on power.	St
1.7.2	I know that card and it's more juice than the 6200.	St
1.7.3	And no to the AGP or GPU data bus width.	St
1.7.4	That has nothing to do with the OS.	St
1.7.5	As to the visual question I can bet no.	St
1.7.6	But then again some may pick out this or that to be a flaw.	St
1.7.7	I can't tell.	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
