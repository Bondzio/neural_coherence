I once heard that the Pockets are designed to be sturdier, since they are intended to be carried around, hence the &quot;pocket&quot; term, whereas the externals are a bit more fragile, and not really designed for portability.However, I only saw that comment one time so I am not very confident about its legitimacy. Any confirmation or clarification will be appreciated.
