1.1.1	Hello , Can someone say something about AMD Athlon 64 ( not FX or X2 ) ?	Ques
1.1.2	Bad/good ?	Ques
1.1.3	Is an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ enough to play new games with ( with 1gb ram , 128mb rather good graph card ) ?	Ques
1.1.4	Should I buy a AMD Athlon 64 FX instead ?	Ques
1.1.5	Why ?	Ques
1.1.6	Is it worth it ( I 'm a bit short of money ) ?	Ques
1.1.7	MVH Oskar R	St
1.2.1	Are you building anew or upgrading an existing system ?	Ques
1.3.1	How much money are you willing to spend on a new processor ?	Ques
1.4.1	and a & quot ; 128mb rather good card & quot ; , i dont see how it wont be able to play new games .	St
1.4.2	probably better than me setup .	St
1.4.3	512mb of ram , fx5200 .	St
1.4.4	p4 no ht .	St
1.4.5	and it can play nfsmw at the very lowest settings .	St
1.4.6	but it can handle flight sim 2004 , warcraft III pretty good , doom 3 at 800x600 on medium settings no aa , pretty much everything on low settings .	St
1.4.7	i would say get an amd 3800+ dual core .	St
1.4.8	not that expensive , not that cheap .	St
1.4.9	and it would be worth it .	St
1.5.1	that can justify the FX price .	St
1.5.2	There 's a lot of the standard AMD 64 's that are just fine for you .	St
