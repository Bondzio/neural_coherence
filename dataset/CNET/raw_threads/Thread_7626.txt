When I reconnect I have to repair because trying to type in my network password doesn't work.I'm using it upstairs and i'm in a Townhome. What is it is it what channel I have it on or what?Please help. Tan

Microsoft has this Update Driver button that would report such but it fails to check the maker's web site. If that is all they give you, I'd ask for a refund. Bob
