the article about removing the registry entries should allow the drives to work as cd/dvd drives but not as &quot;recorders.&quot; that's another issue.
to use said drives as recorders we have to use additional software such as roxio or nero.
so far your posts have neglected which title you use.
it is worth noting that windows xp native cd recording is not reliable.
i can offer links about it but if you expect for that to work i must unsubscribe if you feel it should work.
there is no known fix!
however current versions of roxio and nero seem fine.
you also need to know that drag and drop to the cd/dvd recordable media is also unreliable.
again there is no known cure for that.
but we can always format a fresh disk and use that again till it fails.
and again i must unsubscribe if you feel it should work 100% of the time.
here's what i find works 99.9999% of the time.
software that we run to record to media like cdburnerxp.
that software is free, easy to use and doesn't suffer the issues of drag and drop recording.
i hope i've made my position clear and hope you can start executing some repairs.
