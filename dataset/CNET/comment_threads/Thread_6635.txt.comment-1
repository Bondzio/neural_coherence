I have an issue with my motherboard.
If I install any new RAM other than what I used when I built my computer I can't use sleep mode.
The reason why, is that when I try waking my computer up, my processor idles at 50% and windows becomes EXTREMELY unstable and I have to shut down.
I have none of these issues when I boot up and my computer passes all stability tests.
So there is something wrong with the motherboard somewhere.
So my question is, should I install the new RAM and never use sleep mode, or keep my current RAM and be able to use sleep mode?
And I don't want to rma the motherboard because if I am going to go through that hassle I will just buy a new, better motherboard.
