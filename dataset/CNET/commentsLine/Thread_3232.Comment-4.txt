well silly me, i lied, turns out the floppy drive was unplugged.
was able to boot with it.
so i think what happened was when i plugged in this old drive, it was jumpered as master and took over as c drive, probably wrote somehing into the os on the main hd in the comp, corrupting it, giving the error.
thisd is all win98-- --fj
