hey my first computer was a vic20 i bought at a montgomery wards store.
i had a cassette player i hooked up to it and loaded software from cassettes.
i had a 13 inch black and white tv i connected to it for the monitor.
i remembered ordering software collections on cassettes from ads that were in some of the early magazines.
one of the most frustrating things i remember was trying to figure out where a program would start on the cassettes.
you would fast forward or rewind to get close and then you had to hit play and it would load when it found it.
kept that computer for a while and then got a compuadd 4.77 mhz pc-xt clone with a 20mb hard drive.
that was a great improvement for the time.
bought a 300 baud modem for it and could dial into the bbs's.
that was pretty cool back then.
could download some things but you had be sure and matchup the protocols (remember zmodem).
next pc was a gateway 486dx2..... great memories.
