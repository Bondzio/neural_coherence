I recently tried to upgrade my Dell C521 4GB 32-bit, Radeon x1300/1550 graphics card with this: SPARKLE SX98GT512D3L-NM GeForce 9800 GT 512MB 256-bit GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready Low Profile Ready Video Card - Retail from Newegg It was a bit difficult to insatll but i pluged it in and turned on the pc....the button usually green is yellow and only the the fan and dvd drive come on..the pc dosent boot up. I was thinking i need to replace the power supply which was 280Watt. My warranty recently expired and I'd like to avoid paying $50 only to be told to order a power supply. Thanks -T

But about the power supply..do you think I need to replace it...is there a &quot;reset&quot; button? All my product doc is on the hard drive, so I cant look anything up.

No, there's no reset button. You may not have zapped the PS but it's a good bet it's under powered for your system now.

I don't want to sound rude but, if the answer is &quot;No&quot;, the answer to your question should be obvious. If it does have the connector and you haven't plugged it in, the next step to take is also obvious. That's all I can offer. Best of luck.

Seconds later i kind of smell a burning smell and tuned it off. the smell was comming from the power supply. I tried to turn it on and and then the fan would only start, and dvd drive. So this is why I'm thinking the power supply?
