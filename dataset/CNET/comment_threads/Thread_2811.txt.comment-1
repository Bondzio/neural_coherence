I was wondering how much effect raises your ram does for your pc.
Right now i have a 1 gb of PC2100 DDR.
My question is if i bought 2 sticks of dual channel ram at PC3200 DDR.
would it increase my speed by a large amount.
My Specs 2.53 pentuim 1 gb ram 80 gb hard drive 480 power supply radeon 9800 pro
