Reinstalled XP and it doesn't detect the onboard (VGA compatible) video. I know have 640X480 and Color quality is 4bit. Woohooo!! In device manager as &quot;other device&quot; with yellow question mark. It's a *Legend Computer* &gt; nothing on their website! Winbond Motherboard &gt; no luck here either. At this point i'd be happy with any driver that would work. M VGA Compatible driver. Shouldn't be this hard to find?? Anyone know of a driver that is most likely to work? A &quot;M VGA Compatible driver&quot;!! Thanks G

You didn't give your model number or any other identifiers so hard to say if yours is there... Also I did find downloads on the Winbond site (once I switched it to english.) but it was not clear to me of these were what you were looking for... Hope this helps -- good hunting.
