I sent them an email and got the correct version of the software.
Just a version of UPSMON which I already had from one of my old UPSs.
Still did not interface with my main PC as it would not connect using com1,2,3,4.
Had to go in the BIOS and switch the addresses to AUTO for COM1 & 2.
Connects now and everything to work.
Man what a headache all that was.
