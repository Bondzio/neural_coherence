<s> I just did some research on the Intel website regarding my Intel Pentium 4 Processor number 519 which comes with the Emachines T5026. </s>
<s> It said that Hyper-Threading was turned off for this processor. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can turn the Hyper-Threading on or do I need a new motherboard? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> &quot;Intel Pentium 4 processor 519 with 533MHz frontside bus, 1MB L2 cache and 3.06GHz processor speed&quot; in the T5026. </s>
<s> That's not the HT CPU. </s>
<s> The HT CPUs have the 800MHz bus from what I see at Intel.com Bob </s>
<s> Bob is right on about this. </s>
<s> 800 is the min FSB for intel to put on HT. </s>
<s> Check it out here http://www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium4/index.htm z </s>
<s> This is were I got my information from http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/details.asp?sspec=sl87l . </s>
<s> If you read in the notes section it says Hyper-Threading is turned off, I thought it could be turned on. </s>
<s> But it is probably turned off due to the 533MHz fsb. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway. </s>
<s> I have the Intel Desktop Board D915GVWB, would this board support a pentium 4 hyper-threading cpu or better yet maybe one of intels new 6xx cpu for 64bit compatibility. </s>
<s> Maybe I should just swap out the motherboard for a aftermarket motherboard with a new cpu. </s>
<s> What 3rd party motherboard would fit inside my emachines T5026 case? </s>
<s> Thanks again for all the help. </s>
<s> The CPU you have is not the HT variety. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/wb/ shows this board to have the needed CPU support, but this move is going to be expensive as you'll need new RAM as well as the CPU. </s>
<s> I wouldn't do this with the 64-bit wave approaching. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can see where you may have thought your PC could have HT by looking at this link indicating HT tech suported the 533MHz system bus: 3.06MHz. </s>
<s> However, scrolling down, your 915GV chipset is not listed as one of those with HT. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/products/ht/hyperthreading_more.htm They list these Intel desktop chipsets with 533/400 MHz as having HT: 910GL, 865P, 850E, 845PE, 845GE, 845GV, 845E, 845G I also note your Pent 4 processor number 519 is not listed with those that have HT support. </s>
<s> My brother has this computer, which basically makes it half-mine as its in my house. </s>
<s> I plan to upgrade the motherboard, processor and ram when the dual-core Pentium D comes out. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> It looks like to me either this CPU number 519 is no longer in production right now or is a special cpu made just for Emachines with a lower FSB. </s>
<s> It seems as all the socket LGA775 are 800fsb when mine is only 533MHz. </s>
<s> And the lowest CPU number I can see is 520. </s>
<s> Looks like I'll need a new CPU,motherboard, and ram by 2006. </s>
