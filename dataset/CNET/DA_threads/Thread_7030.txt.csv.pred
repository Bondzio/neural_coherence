1.4.1	Basically I need it for documenting patient history and physical exams The template would be something like this : chief complaint : ( a few words ) History of present illness : ( a few sentences ) Past medical History : ( words ) Etc Some portions would look like this with checkboxes : ( ) hyperthyroidism ( ) hypertension ( ) diabetes ( ) cancer ( ) CHF ( ) pneumonia ( ) etc ( ) etc ( ) etc I was hoping to find a program for a tablet so its less & quot ; cold or rude & quot ; when doing patient interviews to be typing while interviewing and yet still be able to write it out while I 'm actually talking to the patient otherwise I can be left with several patient notes to write several hours later that will take several hours to do versus getting them done on the spot but I am starting to think what I 'm looking for does n't exist yet , or that it wo n't work as well as I need it to .
