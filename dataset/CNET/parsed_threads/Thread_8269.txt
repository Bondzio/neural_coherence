<s> I'm just curious as to why Sony or Microsoft haven't done a thing to market their own version of an iPad? </s>
<s> I'm not anti-Apple but I have either Sony computers/TV's or Microsoft's Zune and their Zune Pass. </s>
<s> I don't want to reinvent my own personal wheel by dumping all my music and Sony cards just to buy an iPad. </s>
<s> Yeah, I checked the web and all I got was chatter on how &quot;companies are looking into it&quot;. </s>
<s> I don't want to be on Social Security before this happens. </s>
<s> Has been the problem. </s>
<s> HP was going to release a very nice 11&quot; tablet with lots of USB ports + more that would run on Window7 Pro but after testing they found out that Win7 was just not 100% ready to run a tablet & they are now looking into Android O/S, so that has been push back to late Fall of this year, that is if testing goes good. </s>
<s> No one is going to make a dent into iPad sales until someone can make a tablet that runs on Windows 7 Pro or Ultiment with out problems, with good battery life & a competitive price to the iPad but by then the iPad gen 2 will be out, maybe even iPad gen 3. </s>
<s> It is going to be sometime. </s>
<s> Dell has their little 5&quot; Andrioid thing, I do not consider it a tablet... just too small, more for a phone size then tablet. </s>
<s> Thank you for taking the time to answer my honest question. </s>
<s> I am NOT anti-Apple, I simply have a vast and expen$ive support system of Sony items and love the Microsoft programs. </s>
<s> Every time that I see the iPad on TV, I covet it. </s>
<s> But I know that as soon as it's out of the box, I will regret the limiting nature for myself. </s>
<s> Being a Zune Pass holder, I've become used to the luxury of downloading 100's and 100's of songs for a flat monthly fee. </s>
<s> I'm fickle, musically, so I have NO desire to OWN the latest *pop* and hip-hop music that I exercise with; I want NEW each month to hold my interest and motivate me to keep fit. </s>
<s> I also have the original Sony e-Reader with 235 books that I paid for and don't want to lose; if Sony came out with an &quot;i-Tab&quot; (&lt;what the iPad SHOULD have been called), I could transfer all my books to that device plus use my Memory Sticks. </s>
<s> Well, I thank you for taking your time to answer me and not dismiss my curiosity. </s>
<s> Have a great, glitch-free day! </s>
<s> the iPad is selling because of the marketing, not because of the product. </s>
<s> it's little more than an overgrown iPod Touch. </s>
<s> it's a toy and people will buy it because Steve Jobs comes out and hypnotizes them with a black turtleneck. </s>
<s> saying, &quot;oooh look, we are going to sell you a technology that we came up with 4 years ago. </s>
<s> it doesn't do anything too useful, but you WILL buy it my zombies, yes you will..&quot; </s>
<s> Windows, Icons, Mouse, Pointer or WIMP is their choice of interfaces. </s>
<s> As we move to tablets you may have to change. </s>
<s> Change is hard for big companies. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There is competition out there. </s>
<s> It's just not marketed as well. </s>
<s> the answer is really that there's not enough of a demand for such devices. </s>
<s> the real question is why is there an iPad to begin with? </s>
<s> It doesn't have enough functionality and it doesn't fit a need. </s>
<s> it may as well be called the iFad. </s>
<s> So, are netbooks and their cheapness and tiny size stealing the potential tablet audience? </s>
<s> I have a netbook but the keyboard is SO small that I keep making typing mistakes all the time. </s>
<s> I love the fact that you can get apps for tablets and their large screen which is also a keyboard. </s>
<s> ~sigh~ I guess in a years time, if there's no competition, I'll break down and buy an iPad. </s>
<s> I agreed to begin with about the non-functionality of the iPad, but now that I've had time use my iPad, I have a different opinion. </s>
<s> The functionality of a Netbook or Laptop is based on using Office and programs like that. </s>
<s> But there are many people use their Netbooks to get email, surf the web, do some basic productivity work, etc, but may not use the device for hard-core productivity and office-related duties. </s>
<s> Of course there are many people who do use their Laptops for hard-core purposes too, but many people simply use the devices for casual use. </s>
<s> At work, many people are using iPads, and with the Wi-Fi and using programs like EverNote, we can send eachother updates on meeting notes, updated To-Do lists, etc. </s>
<s> It's a great way to connect with other people here at work when everyone is in different areas, and it beats a pager or trying to call everyone on their cell phone inside our building. </s>
<s> The iPad is a great device for the casual user but it does have productivity apps too. </s>
<s> It's a fun, easy device that has more entertainment value than anything else, but it does have enough productivity apps that do make it useful. </s>
<s> Of course, the iPad is based primarily on receivng and sending via wireless. </s>
<s> No DVD drive, no USB connections unless you get adapters. </s>
<s> Look at it this way: There are millions of people using their Smart Phones for web surfing, watching movies, downloading music, etc. </s>
<s> Should we complain about phones because they aren't productive devices? </s>
<s> Until you spend time with an iPad, I don't think the true value becomes evident. </s>
<s> Nice post,Dan. </s>
<s> See, I would use an iPad-like device BECAUSE of the &quot;Fun Factor&quot;. </s>
<s> I do my &quot;serious&quot; work on my 17&quot; laptop. </s>
<s> Only reason I'm not buying an iPad is I don't have any Apple products and don't want to convert from Sony and Microsoft, which is what I've got a boatload of items invested in. </s>
<s> But, I love your positive post. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> there is actually a lot of devices that has been made to compete with Ipad. </s>
<s> One of this is the known Witstech AI8E . </s>
<s> This device has a lot of things to offer with full specification which Ipad doesn't have. </s>
<s> There is a lot of Android Tablet as well that are trying to compete with Ipad. </s>
<s> Its just that Apple has the best marketing exposure compared to them, which no one can beat. </s>
<s> Well, I guess waiting has paid off. </s>
<s> I just read at cnet about the Samsung Galaxy that is coming out ? </s>
<s> and priced ? </s>
<s> I like the Flash capabilities, the camera and also the smaller size. </s>
<s> My e-reader is the same profile and it's super lightweight and easy-peasy to carry around. </s>
<s> I'll check out the other two manufacturers that you suggested, too. </s>
<s> In my opinion, since the NVIDIA has released tegra2 processor after, tablet pc will enter a new era. </s>
<s> Zpad used Tegra2 processors , 1GHz speed, 1GB memory, android2.2 system. </s>
<s> wifi, 3G, 130 million pixel camera. </s>
<s> This configuration may be able to compete with the ipad. </s>
<s> At least, you can share. </s>
