i just took a look at the specs, and it's hardly strong.
first of all, 512mb of ram is hardly enough for modern systems.
secondly, ati x200 isn't exactly top of the line.
a lot of agp cards with better performance are available for cheaper.
3rd, what kind of monitor is included in the $629.99 package?
the reviews even listed &quot;mediocre&quot; gaming performance as a low.
i build my current machine for around $600.
that's including a $250 17&quot; lcd monitor, and a year ago.
things are just a bit more expensive back then.
and i'm pretty sure it can outperform that thing.
