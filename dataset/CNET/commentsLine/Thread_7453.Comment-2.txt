notes this has the x16 pci express slot so you can't go get some agp card.
you'll have to pick an pci express card based on how far out you want to go.
ati has a dual gpu video card with 1 gigabyte of video ram but that is on the extreme side of upgrades.
your choice is usually determined by a budget.
