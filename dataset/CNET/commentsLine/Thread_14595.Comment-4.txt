plug n play, this means that the mb bios will auto assign the irq and dma settings.
a plug n play os like xp will try to find the drivers, if it can then your ok. if it can't it may put in it's closest guess, which will probably not work.
so for video and sound cards you allwise have to install the correct drivers.
