i have the same doubt as you as to why some monitors are made wide screened.
a normal person angle of vision is 120 degrees and unless the wide screen monitor is placed farther away from the eyes, i find it rather streneous as the eyes have to move from left to right.
personally, i find that it is only good for viewing multi pages and spreadsheets.
perhaps, the reason for manufacturers to produce wide screen monitor is to follow the trend of wide screen tvs.
but again, wide screen tv is viewed at a further distance as compared to a wide screen computer monitor.
