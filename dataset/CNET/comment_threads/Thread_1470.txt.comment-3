Thank you for your quick response.
I will try setting this all up and let you know how it worked.
I do not have a laptop or other computer that needs to access these printers and scanner.
I have an Epson printer hooked up to my desktop computer (the one I just installed the adapter in) I just need to be able to access the HP photo printer across the room and wishfully the scanner too.
I have no room on or near to my desk for the second printer and scanner.
I can't tell if I needed the router at all or just the printer server and adapter.
I guess I'll just have to try them both ways.
Thanks again.
