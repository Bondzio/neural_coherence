i am planning on a home wireless network for the first time and wondering about purchasing b or g devices.
it would be for two desktop computers (and maybe a laptop) sharing a dsl connection.
some of the b stuff i have found is quite cheap and i don't think i need the faster speeds of g. are there other benefits to a g network that i should consider?
thanks!
