i'm new to these fora although i used the zdnet communities many times, so : what is an interview?
what is a usb hard disk what is acronis?
and how do you mean for me to use pc relocator?
i'm sorry to be so dense, but it's been a long time since i've needed help and never with this computer, so i'm really in the dark here.
i talked to the guys from dell last night and i asked if i could install windows on a scsi drive, but i just realized i don't know how to do that.
he said that would work, i.e., installing windows on the external drive, copying the computer drive using pc relocater, format the drive and then using pcr again from the external drive to the computer.
