St
1.1.3	i basicly got a core 2 duo 6700, 2 gb 667 ram, 7900 gtx and 250, 160 gb hdd... looking on hypersonic pc it would go for about 5 grand so ur saving alot of money if u buy it like this.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Nicely done!	St
1.3.2	Besides XP, I'd just add one more thing--a floppy drive for the BIOS updates and to install the SATA/RAID driver.	St
1.3.3	My favorite is the combination media card reader + floppy drive in one unit.	St
1.3.4	Makes great use of one 3.5&quot; external bay space.	St
1.4.1	I always liked my trusty wired one more.	St
1.4.2	My battery always seemed to go low during a game of source so I threw it away.	St
1.4.3	I got my keyboard from a goodwill equivalent for $4 and couldn't be happier.	St
1.4.4	I have yet to see a KB under $70 that is as nice to type on as this baby.	St
1.4.5	You can save a lot of money by going to good will for crap like that.	St
1.4.6	The DVD burner... if you go to newegg they sell 20x drives for under $50.	St
1.4.7	And spend $10 at xiode.com to get some thumb screws.	St
1.4.8	Lots of em.	St
1.4.9	They just make everything look so much cleaner (When they all match, inside and out).	St
1.5.1	it would b $ 2,988.88 wif the new vista ultimate ^_^ so its still under 3 grand	St
1.6.1	if you want absolute savings then yes... u could use a flash drive instead of a loppy so im not worried.	Sug
1.6.2	the card reader you can get from microcenter for 12 bucks if you wana use an sd card instead for updating bios.. i did forget OS but updated so wif vista ultimate its 2988.88 bucks my wireless mouse lasts about a mounth in battery life.	St
1.6.3	the unique scrolling mechinism would help too.	St
1.6.4	ur right about the keyboard being expencive(i use a 30$ microsoft media keyboard that types just as nicely), but for gaming the other keyboard has amo count, and some usefull keys lieing around.	St
1.6.5	have fun....	St
