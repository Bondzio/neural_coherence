I'm not sure what kind of games your son wants to play, but I play online games like Age of Mythology on an emachines refurb with a plain 17&quot; crt monitor.
The emachines AMD 3000 cost $500 at http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=934502&CatId=118 I bought another emachines for my relatives in the Philippines on tigerdirect and it is doing just fine for graphic design.
I'm not sure why I'd pay $1000 for a desktop computer.
I'd be curious to hear from others what performance differences are really noticable on a higher end computer than P4/AMD Athalon 512 DDR RAM, 128 MB video card and 160 MB Hard Drive.
