1.1.1	I have two computers .	St
1.1.2	One is on the East Coast of the US , the other is on the West Coast .	St
1.1.3	I need to be able to & quot ; connect & quot ; these two computers for the purpose of sharing drives .	St
1.1.4	I know all about Remote Desktop .	St
1.1.5	This is not what I 'm looking for .	St
1.1.6	If I 'm logged onto Computer A , I need for Computer B 's disk resources to be viewable and accessible through the standard Windows Explorer as remote drives .	St
1.1.7	I 've already : 1. unblocked TCP and UDP ports 135 through 139 , and 445 in the firewall on both computers .	St
1.1.8	2. completely disabled the router 's firewall ( one of the computers is hooked into a router ; firewall has been disabled ) 3. forwarded the relevant ports ( noted above ) in the router 's config to the computer I would like to access .	St
1.1.9	... no joy .	Res
1.1.10	When I try to connect to the remote PC , it comes up not found .	St
1.1.11	I can ping it , and I can connect via remote desktop ( so I also know port forwarding on the router is working ) .	St
1.1.12	But the standard & quot ; net use & quot ; and & quot ; net view & quot ; stuff is not working .	St
1.1.13	I am suspecting my ISPs ( on either the east coast or west coast ) are filtering the & quot ; file and print sharing & quot ; ports ( i.e .	St
1.1.14	TCP + UDP 135 through 139 and 445 ) , but trying to get a hold of someone at either ISP who knows about this stuff is impossible .	St
1.1.15	Does anyone have any experience with Comcast ( West Coast ) and Cablevision ( East Coast ) , in terms of whether or not they filter traffic through these ports ?	Ques
1.1.16	... or , does anyone have any other solutions ?	Ques
1.1.17	Again , I do n't want to use remote desktop .	St
1.1.18	It 's not practical for this purpose , and I do n't want to set up an FTP server .	St
1.1.19	It needs to be a clean , simple solution that allows me ( and my family ) to see and access each computer 's drives just as the local ones .	St
1.1.20	I really appreciate any assistance , but PLEASE do n't offer advice about the inherent security risks of trying to do what it is I 'm trying to do .	St
1.1.21	I am well aware of the risks and would prefer to keep this to a technical discussion rather than an advice post on the risks of file and print sharing over the internet .	St
1.1.22	Many thanks	Polite
