Keep in mind that the drive is 80 billion bytes and not 80 gigabytes.
Let's convert that 74 GB to billions and see what we get?
1 GB = 1,073,741,824 so 74 time 1,073,741,824 is... 79,456,894,976 bytes or very close to the drives capacity.
The remaining &quot;loss&quot; could be some fraction you didn't note or space consumed by the format which is correct.
There.
We've reclaimed the missing space.
