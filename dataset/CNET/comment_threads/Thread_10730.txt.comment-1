I have no local C: or D: drives visible in Disk Management, nor Nero BackitUp 3 nor Ghost 14.
But I boot okay and they are visible in Windows Explorer.
I have an XP SP3 HP MediaCenter 3.2 Ghz, 2 GB RAM, Raid 1 230 GB hard drives.
Interestingly enough, when I boot up in Safe Mode Diskmanager shows C: & D:!
Thank you.
