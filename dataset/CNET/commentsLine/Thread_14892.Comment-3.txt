the process is a time-consuming task.
i wouldn't think you want to wait.
however, i suggest you do this before going to bed or after/before your work day.
drink you soda or coffee and do something else.
and beware it may not seem like it's doing anything but provided you launched the process, check the &quot;progress gauge&quot; to be sure it shows 1%(after some time) before walking away.
