I'd like to get a good reliable board. Socket 775 or the older 478. Pci express or 8x AGP. Any advice from you who have built would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. westfield,ma

Spend sometime reading by typing in gaming PC in the search space above. There have been a lot of posts on this in the last couple of weeks, you can get some good ideas there. John

8362	4	113329	1288333	1288332	ozos	7/9/05 9:00 AM	1.1208996E12	oh	it's Socket T, not Socket 775, it's not even a socket actually, it's an LGA (Land Grid ARray) it's inverse a normal CPU has pins on it's bottom, which plug into the motherboard LGA 775 is the inverse, the CPU has 775 pads on it, and the board has 775 pins that connect to the CPU (never installed one/seen one up close in person (i've used LGA 775 equipped machines) but I hear it's not the easiest thing in the world to do) Socket 939 would be adviseable however

It may work. I don't Know how much your willing to spend so its just a thought.

Did a little research on some of the reccomendations let me know what you think. Asus A8V socket 939 VIAK8T800 Pro ATX AGP 8x 1000mhz Hyper transport w/up to 4gigs of DDR400. AMD Atholon 64 3200+ winchester integrated into chip FSB 512 kb L2 cache. Thermaltake CL-P0075 to cool it down and 1 Gig of corsair XMS Twinx1024-3200C2Pt memory. I do have a slight budget so this would be for starters. Could you reccomend a quality 500watt power supply and a good video card.
8362	7	113329	1290524	1288741	ozos	7/10/05 9:21 PM	1.12103046E12	um...	not sure what that Thermaltake thing is, but aside i'd suggest a GeForce 6800 AGP 8x or a 6600GT and a Fortron Blue Storm 500W
