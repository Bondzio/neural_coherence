(By freezing, I mean the screen freezes, the mouse will not move on the screen, and the keyboard does not work (ctrl-alt-del does nothing). This happens no matter how I boot the computer (safe mode or normal mode). Sometimes it even freezes before the Windows XP login screen appears. Usually, it does not run for more than about 10 minutes before freezing. The Hardware Profile looks normal (nothing has x-ed out on its own). Sometimes, after it freezes, the computer restarts itself, just to have the same problem again. Do you know how I should proceed to troubleshoot this problem? Might this be an issue with the power supply? Thanks for any thoughts...

Sorry for the short reply but given the story and how this works over half the time I gotta take the chance it's this. -&gt; Depending on where the PC is, this is about a yearly task. Bonus information: Applies to laptops too! Many think laptops are no-maintenance bricks. Still need a yearly blast of air on the vents. Thanks for the report. Bob
