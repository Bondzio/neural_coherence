true it's expensive and for today's standards, it is viewed as under-powered.
but, i am beginning to like this idea.
it isn't supposed to powerful, it's supposed to be mobile.
throw that together with one of the best operating systems and all the necessary applications for editing and whatnot, and it's a great tool to have.
the market the air is aimed at is relatively small, but that hasn't affected the strong sales.
today, most people see any computer with under 2.0ghz as a terrible machine, but the clock speed does not completely define the computer.
compared to its competition, the air is more powerful even if it only has &quot;1.6 or 1.8ghz&quot;.
if unsupported power macs clocking in at around 400mhz can run leopard at a somewhat normal speed, than this thing is even more powerful.
i think you have to give apple some credit for putting this together.
the air isn't supposed to have all of the other features that the rest of the mac family has.
and, it's not supposed to be a primary machine for most people, but i'm sure that you could make it one .
