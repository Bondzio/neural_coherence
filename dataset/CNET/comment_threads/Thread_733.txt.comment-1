I need some tips on picking out an external hard drive.
I will be using it to do backups on my 5 year old computer.
Right now I'm looking at a: Seagate Freeagent go 120gb http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FreeAgent-External-Drive-ST901203FGA1E1-RK/dp/B000ND93ES and a simpletech signature mini 160gb http://www.amazon.com/SimpleTech-Signature-FS-U25-160BB-Blueberry/dp/B0012RCKOE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1217181517&sr=1-1 I need a good quality hard drive with good backup software.
I don't want something thats going to crash next year.
Any tips are appreciated
