I didn't know where the parallel port was but a long time ago I remember having to set the mode and on a few LAVA EPP PCI boards you had to set the I/O Address as well.
As you know, the addresses for LPT 1, 2 and 3 are carved in silicon but as time went on, they could move.
However I found old software hardcoded rather than picking up the address from a BIOS API call.
Good to read.
