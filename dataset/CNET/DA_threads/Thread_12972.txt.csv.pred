1.1.1	Hi , I have a a Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 keyboard and mouse which connect to the PC through one USB port .	St
1.1.2	My problem is that sometimes everything works fine , and then other times I switch on the PC and there are no lights on the receiver and I can not use the mouse or keyboard .	St
1.1.3	I have tested both a different mouse/keyboard on this PC and also tried the wireless keyboard and mouse on a seperate machine and both seem to work ok. Do I need to completely remove the drivers ?	Ques
1.1.4	If so , how ?	Ques
1.1.5	Any other ideas ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for any help	St
1.2.1	Sounds defective to me .	St
1.3.1	BEfore you send it back , you should check to see if maybe the reciever is planted too far from the keyboard , or if there 's anything that may interfere with the usage/signal of the two .	St
1.3.2	Also , the batteries may need changing .	St
1.3.3	If you use rechargables , they have less voltage than regular alakline batteries .	St
1.3.4	Just chipping in my 2 cents .	St
1.4.1	Thanks	Polite
