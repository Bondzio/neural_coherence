did you run just chkdsk, or did you use chkdsk /f/r?
chkdsk by itself will only check the disk, with /f or /r, or both will move the info to good sectors.
depending on the size of disk it may take awhile.
also it may only happen on a reboot cause it needs exclusive rights to the drive.
sfc command will take you to original values, you will need to go to microsoft update after the sfc was run.
hope this helps.
