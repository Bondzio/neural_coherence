interesting ideas.
I tried updating the bios.
Didn't help, but probably good thing to have done anyway.
The card wants 3.3V, but I can't find a spec on what voltage the PCI bus is trying to source.
How can I tell?
I went through Intel's web site and literature with no luck ... can you tell by looking at the board???
?
