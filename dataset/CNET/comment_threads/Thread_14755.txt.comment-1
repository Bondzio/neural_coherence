I'm planning on building a gaming PC within the next two weeks.
I don't want to spend too much money ($1000 limit).
I configured one on newegg with Socket 939 and it came to about $900.
I configured another with Socket AM2 for about $1000.
Is it worth $100 more to go with AM2?
I heard it's only 1% faster.
