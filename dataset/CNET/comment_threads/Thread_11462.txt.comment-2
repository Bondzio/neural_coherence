Everything we add generates heat.
You can get 20 Watts less for each hard disk and CD drive you remove from your design.
You can drop 10 or so Watts by cutting back to 512MB and today's OS and games may run with a percentage point on the 1GB setup.
The dual display cards add too.
The lowest Wattage I see is about 35 Watts and you may have a 200 Watt CRT on that as well.
I see three to four hundred Watts you might be able to drop out of this system (including CRT) and still play the game.
