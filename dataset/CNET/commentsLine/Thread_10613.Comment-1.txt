i have a 64mb sdram pc100 100mghz on my win98 pc and i tried to replace it with 256mb sdram pc133 168pin.
the problem is when i boot up my pc the screen starts to count up to 256mb then the screen becomes filled with coloured squares that are continuously flashing.
the brand of memory i purchased was azenram.
does anyone know the possible problem and how to solve it?
