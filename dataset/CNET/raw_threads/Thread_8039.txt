My cable provider has installed a separate RCA DHG536 modem for my VoIP phone service alongside my SB5120 modem, and charges me $7 a month modem rental. I am upgrading the SB5120 to a DOC 3.0 modem and wonder if I can abandon the DHG536 modem?

That doesn't seem right. It would seem that your provider should have replaced the SB5120 with the DHG536. In any case, the SB6121 is not a VoIP modem. You would need something like the SBV6220. You should first check with your ISP on which VoIP modems are compatible with your service.

Installer used a splitter ahead of the SB5120 to do the phone set up, and the outputs from the DHG536 are phone only; basically leaving the 5120 to function as internet only. I will look into the SBV6220 as a way to shave costs. Many thanks!
