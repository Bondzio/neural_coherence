Hi thank you for your great info I think that will work great, but I need some thing that fit in to the living room.
this is a problem for me since I was told to go with Apple/Mac Airport router.
I have all Macs-- I did not get it becuse I think it's too big and won't look good in the room some of my family member has problem with large computer stuff in the room.
this is why I bought a small gateway router.
My hope is to get one that I can use at 40'/ 360 around with great power and speed.
I use my laptop all around my house.
man I might need to go wire I am new to this wifi thing and it's hard to get it just right!!!
Again thank you for all your help.
