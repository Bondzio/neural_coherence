<s> I just installed the d link 624 router airlink plus, and the wireless dwl 550 network card ( for a desktop )on my computer. </s>
<s> The signal stregnth is poor, about 35% usually, and the computer will stutter from time to time, but its the entire computer. </s>
<s> The mouse will stop moving and nothing can be done for about 2 seconds. </s>
<s> If you're playing music for instance the music will play like a broken record, and whatever you're typing will not be seen on screen, just what you type after the stutter is done. </s>
<s> Any thoughts solutions? </s>
<s> any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I have windows XP pro. </s>
<s> 1.6hz 256 ram. </s>
<s> You've got something major running in the background. </s>
<s> Do the three finger click, ctrl-alt-del and see what's running. </s>
<s> Look at the Applications and the Processes tab. </s>
<s> Applications are what are running that you specifically start like IE or email. </s>
<s> Processes are started at boot up. </s>
<s> If you find something that looks suspicious, go to Start, Run, and type msconfig and look at the Startup tab. </s>
<s> Start unchecking unfamiliar items and reboot. </s>
<s> Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained. </s>
<s> See the CNet faces behind the posts. </s>
<s> I think computer viruses should count as life. </s>
<s> I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. </s>
