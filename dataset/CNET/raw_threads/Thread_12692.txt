I am installing a Inno3d geforce 6600 on an old p4 pc with 400watts power supply. the machine has 1 cdrom, 1 80 gig hdd and 1gig and 512 ddr 400 ram. when i havent installed the driver for the video card windows will start normally(with sucky display because driver isnt installed yet). but after i install the driver, windows wont start, it will only load up to the windows xp screen with loading bar on the low middle. could it be that the power supply isnt enough or could it be that the video card is broken?

Could be some chipset updating needed. If you installed your drivers and card correctly and you still have your ONBOARD video enabled, this can cause a reboot. However, if you disable the onboard and have issues, you may lose your video altogether and your option would be to pull the cmos batter for a reset or fumble around in the dark hoping you remember how to reset the settings without screen.

Your manual\cd manual should tell you in what order the card\drivers go for your card and what to clean up or disable. While most I have installed come drivers first, it's not always the case. After re-reading your post again, something was bugging me, when you install the drivers, everything goes funny so this tells me you need to check a a few things.. Disable onboard graphics in bios &lt;but not before your drivers are installed, this would be bad&gt; clean up any graphics drivers that were installed prior, it may be a conflict or both of the above.
