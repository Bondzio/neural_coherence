I've set the faxing up 3 times, but whenver I try to send a fax it will ring the receiver until it &quot;times out&quot; and gives a progress report that says, &quot;No Answer.&quot; When I go to the office supply store to send the fax, the &quot;No Answer&quot; fax # works fine.

I know there is a fix out there, but I can't find it. Also, I recently switched to optimum voice (VOIP) and since then, my fax will not send, or receive. Thom
