1.1.1	Well , I just had an interesting experience this evening .	St
1.1.2	So my friend had been itching for a graphics card for his 4 year old Dell ( bad idea ) .	St
1.1.3	The first he bought was BFG FX5500 OC for AGP , did n't care for it for some reason .	St
1.1.4	Then a few days later he buys an ATI X1300 Pro 256MB for AGP for $ 180 .	St
1.1.5	Now I knew that it would be trouble , his 250watt powersupply will not handle it .	St
1.1.6	And I was right , it didnt work .	St
1.1.7	So then he tried to buy a new power supply after I told him that the connection is proprietary and he would have to buy it online .	St
1.1.8	The Antec did n't fit , big surprise .	St
1.1.9	So he goes to return the card at Bestbuy and they would n't take it because the serial numbers didnt match on the box .	St
1.1.10	But somehow I ended up with the card .	St
1.1.11	I would give him my FX5700LE and pay the difference which would only be $ 80 .	St
1.1.12	Sounded like a deal .	St
1.1.13	My gut feeling said it would n't work because I have a cheap OEM Emachine psu that was never making 300watts .	St
1.1.14	But I tried it anyway .	St
1.1.15	I popped it in , hooked up the molex connecter to the psu ( I should have turned around there ) .	St
1.1.16	Well , the machine did n't start up .	St
1.1.17	Big surprise .	St
1.1.18	Now , I was n't about to go out and buy a $ 60 psu at work so I decided to disconnect 1 of my drives and the useless dial-up modem from my pc .	St
1.1.19	And it actually booted up .	St
1.1.20	But it was n't very stable .	St
1.1.21	Quite ugly .	Polite
1.1.22	So , I disconnected everything and put back in my original card .	St
1.1.23	So now I 'm wasting my time installing drivers and putting my PC back to the way it was before all this .	St
1.1.24	All in the name for a card that underperforms a 6600 !	St
1.1.25	It will never happen again .	St
1.1.26	Lessons learned : 1.Upgrade ur PSU when buying a $ 100+ card 2.Do n't try upgrading your 4-year old Dell 3.Make sure you are wayyy over the minimum requirements for a graphics card 4.Buy components online so you do n't get ripped off .	St
1.1.27	5.Avoid temptation .	St
1.1.28	It will only back to where you started .	St
1.2.1	sells power supplies specifically for Dell 's as a separate line .	St
1.3.1	1-Drive the user crazy .	St
1.3.2	2-Empty the user 's wallet .	St
1.3.3	It seems like both machines have met specs .	St
1.3.4	Trying to upgrade a machine can open a can of worms .	St
1.3.5	But their GREAT TOYS .	St
