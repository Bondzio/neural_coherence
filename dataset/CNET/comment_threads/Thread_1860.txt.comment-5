No offense, but I clicked on &quot;Best Answer&quot; when I meant to hit &quot;Reply&quot; to your post.
Is there a way to UNmark a response as Best Answer?
I'd prefer not to close off discussion, and folks might think there's no use in posting in a thread that has already been marked as answered.
Thanks.
