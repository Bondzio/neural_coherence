1.1.1	Since there seems to be at least 2-3 posts a week about folks looking for a good mid range priced PC , I saw this deal in the Compusa that looked good .	St
1.1.2	I do n't spend TONS of hours shopping around since I am only starting to look for possibly buying a PC ( translation = I want one , wife says lets hold off for now ... ) BUT ANYWAY : http : //www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp ? product_code=22347 & pfp=5105sale For $ 649.99 HP Pavilion AMD Athlon 64 3400 512 MB Ram 200GB HD Lightscribe Double Layer DVD +R/RW Drive 2nd 16X dvd drive 17 & quot ; CRT Monitor PLUS $ 0.01 shipping ( penny shipping ) PLUS you get the following with any purchase $ 799 or over ( which this is BEFORE the mail in rebates , so I think it counts ) Epson Printer/Scanner Netgerar wireless G router Norton System works & * Anti Spam McAfee Internet Security Based on a lot of folks saying the emachine 6212 ( Athlon 64 3200 , 512 mb , 160gb hd ) $ 550 deal was good a few weeks ago , this seemed like it was at least in the ballpark of that since you get the 3400 and 200 gb hd instead .	St
1.1.3	Note - if you order online you may not have to pay sales tax either , so that could be factored in .	St
1.1.4	OR this is one you could pick up in a store as well .	St
1.1.5	I will say I do not know how & quot ; upgradable & quot ; the mobo is , but I think the site says it has two memory slots with one used ( not quite as flexible as 4 slots , but one is open I guess ) and has agp video slot I think I do n't know how good HP is ( that statement ought to start a few comments alone ... ) but this might be a good one .	St
1.1.6	But Anyway - good deal or not ?	Ques
1.1.7	As I said , I am both passing this on to folks that are looking , as well as trying to get a sense for me if I do get teh green light to pull the trigger sooner or later .	St
1.2.1	the hp is not a good deal as the processor is specially made for hp and not upradeable .	St
1.2.2	also will 40gb really make a big difference for u ?	Ques
1.2.3	also the hp only come with agp slot and no pci express slot .	St
1.3.1	No PCI-Express ( x16 ) slot .	St
1.3.2	ROger	St
1.4.1	Hi Chip , Yes , I saw that in todays specials that will last until 7 May and it may fit a nitch for some people .	St
1.4.2	The HP a1022n was just introduced March 31st and appears to be a update of the HP a810n with both having the same motherboard , the only differance being the a810n has a 3300 processor and 160GB HDD .	St
1.4.3	Comparing the difference of emachine T6212 with the HP a1022n : The HP a1022n : Athlon 64 3400 processor , Socket 754 Integrated graphics , can upgrade to AGP Video Cards .	St
1.4.4	Has 200GB HDD Price : $ 649.98 w/17 & quot ; CRT monitor after rebates .	St
1.4.5	Maybe printer ?	Ques
1.4.6	The emachine T6212 : Athlon 64 3200 processor , Socket 939 Integrated graphics , can upgrade to PCI-Express x16 Video cards .	St
1.4.7	Has 160GB HDD Price : When on sale $ 550 w/17 & quot ; CRT monitor & printer after rebates .	St
1.4.8	It may not make a difference to some people not having the latest features for the future like Socket 939 and the PCI-Express video cards , so paying aprx $ 100 more for the future obsolete Socket 754 , AGP Tech , but larger processor and hard drive may be OK for them .	St
1.4.9	Another that may be of interest ( near the price range ) that I would consider is the Gateway 827GM Media Center Edition 2005 with TV Tuner : Athlon 64 3500 Processor , Socket 939 Integrated Graphics , can be upgraded to PCI-Express x16 video cards .	St
1.4.10	Has 200GB HDD Price : At Circuit City , $ 724.99 after rebates or ... $ 989,97 with 17 & quot ; LCD Flat-Panel Nonitor and Printer after rebates .	St
1.5.1	Err ... .. the 3400 processor is a regular AMD Athlon 64 3400 processor .	St
1.5.2	The only weird ( ******* ) processor made for HP by AMD is the 3300 which is not listed at AMD .	St
