Which is best and most reliable - not necessarily the fastest ( I rarely if ever play games etc ), but use the PC for general home use and surfing the internet. Any advice much appreciated.

I think the performance is so much better than the Pentium D's. And it seems I am not alone in this opinion, virtually every opinion, review, or site says the same thing. Even if you aren't a gamer, fast is good, right? And dual is the way to go nowadays, especially with Vista coming. You will benefit from dual core no matter what. The X2 3800+ is a great value-to-performance ratio at $300 from Monarch. Don't worry about comparing clock speeds, Intel and AMD rate them differently (as you prolly know). If you want more opinions, you can search my profile/posts for more info. Good luck, cheers.

I added a video card and another gig of ram and the computer is amazingly fast. A friend bought a computer with the Intel duel core processor and has had a lot of heating problems with it. He has the same model computer as mine but with the Intel processor and mine runs circles around his speed wise. I don't do gaming but I do a lot of grapics and the speed is very much welcomed.

You can get a 3GHz P4 to 4GHz with relative ease on stock cooling. However, they get owned by AMD's in every benchmark, and the Intels have to be clocked very high to beat the AMD's.
