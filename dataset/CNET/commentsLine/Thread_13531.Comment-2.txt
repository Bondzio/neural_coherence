i won't repeat prior discussions about wifi security where i dismember one protection after another but if you purchase the usual wifi router you see from linksys, dlink, netgear or other then enable wep, wpa (your choice) as well as enable mac filtering then that's the state of today's best protection.
i see no need to describe mac filtering since it will be in the product manual or you can ask any search engine.
if you want absolute security then wifi is never an option.
part of this has to do with governmental restrictions on encryption so don't blame the vendors.
