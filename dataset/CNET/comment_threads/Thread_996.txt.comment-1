Connect A Lt To Dsl With A Pc WINME DSL LINKSYS-Wireless G-214 I have a PC connected to the Internet with DSL which works fine.
For Father's day my son bought me a Laptop which I also want to connect to the internet along with my PC.
I tried to connect my LT to the Internet using my LIINKSYS, but I just can't do it using my DSL Modem and my LINKSYS.
Please explain to me in simple language how I can connect my LT to the Internet along with my PC?
Thanks
