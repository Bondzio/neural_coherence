<s> My computer died. </s>
<s> Some odd reson the board died. </s>
<s> But the power supply ram and everything else still works. </s>
<s> I know it's weird only the board. </s>
<s> We're talking socket 775 celeron D. The only thing I can't be certain about is the CPU. </s>
<s> I'm getting a new board tomorrow or day after. </s>
<s> What I'm wondering is a would a dead CPU hurt the board. </s>
<s> If I use onboard video, 1 ram stick, plug in power to motherboard. </s>
<s> Nothing else. </s>
<s> No hd or cd. </s>
<s> Just enough to power the board. </s>
<s> Will a dead cpu fry the board. </s>
<s> Or will it just not turn on. </s>
<s> In other words will testing my cpu to see if it is dead or not fry the board. </s>
<s> Or is it safer not to test it and just get a new CPU. </s>
<s> thanks, confusimo </s>
<s> if kyou spent more then $60 for the board i would try a new cpu or get a cheap board to test with on a bench. </s>
<s> I dont know if the dead processor would hurt it or not, but if you find a local computer shop, preferably one family owned and operated rather than best buy or circuit city, they will test the processor for you for about $10 and they will do a full inspection to insure its in perfect condition. </s>
<s> Its a shame to have to spend the money but then at least you will know black and white if its good or not. </s>
<s> Once you test it...you can decide to keep or get something more consistent with the intended use. </s>
