<s> I've done three builds in my life...all of them have eventually ended with a fried motherboard. </s>
<s> Am I doing something wrong? </s>
<s> Should there be some kind insulator between the metal standoffs/board/screws? </s>
<s> okay ? </s>
<s> Are you using a UPS ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> no. </s>
<s> just a surge protector. </s>
<s> and i've never had a problem with the prebuilt systems i've had....just the ones i've built. </s>
<s> maybe a string of bad luck </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> On the last one I used an Antec Truepower 2.0 550 Watt. </s>
<s> I checked the voltages on the p1 & p4 connectors...it still seems to be providing good power. </s>
<s> I'm not completely sure the board is what's bad on this one(i don't see any blown caps)...i'm leaning that way though. </s>
<s> I get nothing on the screen when I boot but all the fans come on & the soft power led on the board lights up. </s>
<s> I've tried a different cpu. </s>
<s> Put a multimeter to the psu...it checks out. </s>
<s> I tried an old PCI graphics card to no avail. </s>
<s> I'm not sure this board supports pci graphics...i don't see why it wouldn't. </s>
<s> I have two sticks of 1gb ddr2 i was running in it. </s>
<s> I swapped both of those in & out, so it's not the ram unless both sticks died at the same time. </s>
<s> system, I always pull the MB and place it on a piece of cardboard for trouble shooting. </s>
<s> Then clear the BIOS and check/replace the CMOS battery. </s>
<s> (I start with cardboard for all PCs I build). </s>
<s> Re the PCI graphics ... give it a try. </s>
<s> Re standoffs....I use only 2 or 3 brass standoffs and for the rest I use the old plastic standoffs with the bottoms cut off. </s>
<s> Haven't used the paper washers for years. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Any chance we can have the make/ model number of the motherboard, so we can possibly dig a little deeper into this puzzle? </s>
<s> The board is an Asus A8N-E. </s>
<s> I've since moved to an i860 and Win 7. </s>
<s> Might see what the ASUS forum has for the A8N-E MB ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> What about ESD? </s>
<s> Do you use anything else besides the cardboard? </s>
<s> Sometimes I'll use a wriststrap, sometimes I just try to touch the case. </s>
<s> I wonder if this could be the root of all my problems. </s>
<s> I've never been exactly sure how sensitive the components are. </s>
<s> I've heard some say they never worry about and others say you have to be extremely careful. </s>
<s> cause for component failure after extended use. </s>
<s> Right wrong or otherwise I think of ESD as killing something immediately vice days, weeks or months later. </s>
<s> Advice re handling ... never touch components parts .. like RAM, CPUs, MBs, GPUs, etc., ... except by the edges. </s>
<s> Thus far...20 plus years, that's served me well. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> In regards to your last 3 BYOPC's: 1) Was it the same make and model of motherboard? </s>
<s> 2) How long before the system went belly-up? </s>
<s> 3) Can I post your original message on the ASUS forums ( with the addition of of the make/ model #'s included)? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> They were not the same boards. </s>
<s> My first build was a an Athlon Thunderbird...I can't remember the make & model of the first board that fried but I want to say it was Asus. </s>
<s> I had a tech replace that for me with a Jetway V266B which also fried. </s>
<s> The Jetway has some pretty obvious blown caps. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It was probably more than a year before it bit the dust. </s>
<s> It's been sitting in my closet for a few months. </s>
<s> I'm just now getting around to resurrecting it. </s>
<s> 3.Please do. </s>
<s> you know how it is. </s>
<s> Anyway, have been checking through the ASUS forums (so many questions, so many problems, sooo many pages)and have still a few more questions. </s>
<s> Can you recall (before you put this mobo in the closet) what symtoms it had before the computer died? </s>
<s> -BSOD -constant or random crashing -PSU working, mobo power light on but no power to rest of the computer -system stops before getting to POST screen -fan warning at startup, &quot;Chip fan speed too low&quot; -smoke, flames ? </s>
<s> The one problem I did see noted quite often was the failure of the chipset fan. </s>
<s> But aside from this, if you could answer these quesitons, I might be able to dig deeper in to ASUS </s>
<s> Not a problem. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> It's been a while since it crashed. </s>
<s> But here's what i can remember: -Don't recall any BSODs -there was some random crashing growing more frequent towards then end -the psu seems to be working. </s>
<s> the light comes on all fans spin. </s>
<s> the voltages check out on a multimeter -nothing displays on the screen at all. </s>
<s> like the monitor isn't plugged in. </s>
<s> no beep codes either -no fan warnings -no smoke or fire The chipset fan does turn. </s>
<s> http://www.badcaps.net/pages.php?vid=5 </s>
<s> is it new or older? </s>
