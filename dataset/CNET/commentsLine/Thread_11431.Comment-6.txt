the green wire test is ok. the fan turned on.
i am not that into electronics to try it without a switch.
wouldn't a bad switch make it not power up at all?
how would a bad power switch make the system freeze up?
at first i thought the hard shutdown by holding the button caused the issue but now i think the freezeup was a failure and i didn't cause anymore damage than what was there already.
