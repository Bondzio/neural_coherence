I know i can play it with the supplied software and i got sonys $200 blu-ray drive. but i wanted to use vistas. Im using a barebones shuttle pc with vista home prem, core quad, radion 2600hd with hdmi and i know every complies with hdcp.

If you've done your research you'll find &quot;It's up to these developers to determine whether the environment they have set up will meet the environment criteria the &quot;content owners&quot; impose on manufacturers. So that probably no next-gen playback for Vista out of the box. Jason Chen&quot;

It is like being between a rock and a hardplace, HD, then BLU RAY, what to do. Geez, look at the price of BLU RAY disks!
