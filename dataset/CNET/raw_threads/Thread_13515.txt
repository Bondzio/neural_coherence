It was purchased with two other notebooks of the same. His is the only one where the fan will almost continually run, and when it does the computer slows down to a crawl. We had a tech in a few days ago for something else and she agreed to look at this computer, but only had a few moments. She said there is interference from a wireless network somewhere else in the office park we are in. We are not set up for wireless - our internet access is through a dialup LAN, which 4 of us share. None of us are familiar with wireless at all. What can be done to check if this is the problem and how do we stop this? Could someone be piggybacking onto our antique connection? We don't have a firewall (yes I know!), and I don't think the XP firewall is in active status. I've never used a firewall either, so don't know much about them. One of the other laptops says that the internet is already being used when we go online. Both computers have Norton AV & internet protection, Spybot, & Spyware Blaster installed with definitions up to date and no infections showing. I'm a rank amateur so please try to explain what to check or do as simply as possible. Thank you!
