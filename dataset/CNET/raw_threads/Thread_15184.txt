Ideally it would have good sound, USB ports and large memory (and able to handle being connected to a 1tb external HDD) I was swaying towards the Lenovo IdeaTab Lynx, but this is not out in the UK yet and wont be for some time yet and I'm not quite sure it would do all I need. Does anyone have any advice or recommendations? Thanks, Steven.

HOWEVER, because of what Microsoft did with the slate other makers decided to not roll out their designs. Given the high price of that with the usual keyboard I don't see the attraction. Bob
