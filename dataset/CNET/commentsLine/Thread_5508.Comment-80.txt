check the system profile (apple &gt; about this mac &gt; more info).
see if the enclosure shows up in the appropriate port (firewire or usb).
then check the drive section if it shows up there.
if does not show 1 or other, drive is not working, get a new hdd, and hook it up.
firewire only (usb is poor).
gl!
