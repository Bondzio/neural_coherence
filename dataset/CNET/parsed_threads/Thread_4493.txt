<s> Once again I am back asking for advise. </s>
<s> I built my computer from scratch. </s>
<s> First problem if I even enter my Bios then exit my computer will not boot up again if I turn it off. </s>
<s> I have to reset my bios to be able to do anything again. </s>
<s> Second problem I tried to install windows using Windows xp OEM Preinstallation kit. </s>
<s> It installed untill it got a command prompt screen then it just stoped now when I restart my computer it won't boot past the verfying DMI pool data stage. </s>
<s> What is going on. </s>
<s> You didn't include any information about your hardware, making it almost impossible to really supply a good answer. </s>
<s> Not the TIP about supplying all &quot;Necessary information&quot; For a test you can unplug all hardware but the video card, motherboard, memory, hard drive and CPU to see if it will work with that. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work then pull the motherboard out of the case and set it up on a table with just the minimal hardware and see if that works. </s>
<s> If you create many discussions, the information gets lost. </s>
<s> Just reply in your old discussion with new information. </s>
