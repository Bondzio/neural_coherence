the old drive (toshiba 80g) works just fine if i reinstall it in my laptop.using usb box as in original post &quot;my computer&quot; does not see it but device manager does says it works fine.
tried my new 100g seagate in box same result.
tring to find way to use both drives already formated on my laptop without having to remove one to use the other.i guess what i am saying isthat i would like to use the drives by selecting which one is the boot on start up but my bios does not seem to do that.if i take the one out of my computer,just get error message it does not see the one connected to the usb as bootable.
