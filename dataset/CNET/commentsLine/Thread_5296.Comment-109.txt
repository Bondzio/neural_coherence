i said it does not matter cause it is something of a silly question for the vast majority of cases.
for all practical purposes they all come with integrated cards.
if you buy an upgraded computer with a dedicated card from most of the &quot;big boys&quot; they stick a card in an available slot, disable the integrated one, and if you are lucky they put caps over the integrated connectors so you dont plug the monitor in the wrong hole.
if you did not upgrade or buy a higher end model the integrated card stays enabled, you paid less money, and later you can stick the card of your choice in an available slot and if you are good will cap off the not used holes.
try and order a custom upgraded computer from hp or dell etc.
and see if you can get them to remove the integrated one!
