iMovie 11 is capable of stabilizing a shaky picture on its own.
All the warning is saying is that any camera that uses the CMOS image sensors often use a technology called a &quot;rolling shutter&quot; and that, if you use iMovie 11 Video Stabilization when you are editing the raw footage, you will likely have a result that looks distorted.
A workaround is to either use a tripod while filming your event, which will give you a stable picture to begin with OR Do not use iMovie 11's built in Video Stabilization feature.
