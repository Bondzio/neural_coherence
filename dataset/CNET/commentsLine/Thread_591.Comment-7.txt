if there is atx12v, i dont know where it is, but i will check the manual.
the power supply is plugged in properly, i have cleared the cmos, but it still doesnt have video.
i have tried with different ram, one in each slot... etc... but i still get the same beeps.
i doubt that the prior user has tried updating the bios.
they werent that technologically advanced.
