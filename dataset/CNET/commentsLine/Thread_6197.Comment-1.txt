hi, i want to buy a external hard drive, but i have 1 question i am buying the external hard drive for the gameplay video's i make.
i use a notebook, and a notebook doesn't have a big hard drive.
so i want to save the movies directly on my external hard drive.
for a fast transfer i will buy a external hard drive with usb 3.0 now i want to know if more rpm makes a faster transfer from pc to external hard drive?
makes 7200 rpm a faster transfer then 5400 rpm?
greetings, noobie ^^
