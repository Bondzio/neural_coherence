I think wireless will be better, but no other functions are required. Any suggestions?

I'd start with that if you want a netbook. Bear in mind that netbooks have no DVD/CD drives, so you might want to invest around $30 for an external ones. Good luck.

At the office we have about half a dozen netbooks and all have been reliable. The last one was from Walmart and they work too. About the ecards on the machine. Not one laptop/netboook comes with ecards so you would install some email app. Let's hope you are not thinking about Incrediamail since that's not reliable. Bob
