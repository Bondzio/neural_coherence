to access your network adapter's porperties in windows xp, open your control panel, select network connections, find your active local area network connection and open it.
in the window that comes up click the properties button and you will be in the place described earlier.
to add the ipx/spx protocol, just click the button that says install, choose protocol and click ok, then choose the netbeui ipx/xpx protocol and click install.
