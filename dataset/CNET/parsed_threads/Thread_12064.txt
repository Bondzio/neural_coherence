<s> I have been using a wg111 wireless usb adapter for some number of years. </s>
<s> My previous configuration (WinXP Pro SP2, home-brew Athlon XP system) worked fine for 2-3 years. </s>
<s> I recently &quot;upgraded&quot; to a Dell Dimension 9200 (WinXP Pro SP2, Core2 Duo, etc.) </s>
<s> and periodically get BSOD at boot time due to driver crashes. </s>
<s> I have not (yet) lost data. </s>
<s> In trying to track down this problem, I have seen much scathing commentary. </s>
<s> I guess I just lucked out --- until now. </s>
<s> I am using the latest drivers... </s>
<s> So, is there a stable Wireless G USB adapter out there? </s>
<s> Should I switch to PCI? </s>
<s> My network is stable, as there are 3-4 laptops having no problems. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for the quick reply. </s>
<s> the download states that I will get driver version 5.1254.1120.2006. </s>
<s> When I check in device manager, I still get 3.0.18.201. </s>
<s> The driver dir of the update did not seem to have an INF file for the wg111v2, just a .sys file. </s>
<s> The inf file is net111v2. </s>
<s> Also, when I try to run the installed &quot;Netgear wg111v2 smart wizard&quot; I get the hourglass for 1/2 second. </s>
<s> BTW - did you got to Penn St? </s>
<s> Sorry the driver didn't contain any update. </s>
<s> OK there are other reasons for this to crash. </s>
<s> Let's try a few tools and scans. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Run WINSOCKFIX. </s>

<s> Scan with this tool, tell me if it found anything other than cookies. </s>

<s> I wasn't sure if it crashed everytime, but if so what else is in the Event Viewer? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Event log has this: A duplicate name has been detected on the TCP network. </s>
<s> The IP address of the machine that sent the message is in the data. </s>
<s> Use nbtstat -n in a command window to see which name is in the Conflict state. </s>

<s> Thanks for all of your help! </s>

<s> Just take the router's defaults, rename the SSID, enable WPA, let SSID broadcast and it should knock the attacker offline. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks again for the worthwhile information! </s>

<s> Thanks again... </s>
<s> It's Windows... </s>
<s> Sorry but I've yet to see this platform to be perfected yet. </s>

<s> You say, &quot;If it doesn't do this in a day you have to consider other issues.&quot; Do you man &quot;does&quot;? </s>
