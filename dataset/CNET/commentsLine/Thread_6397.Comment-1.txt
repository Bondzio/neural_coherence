ok everyone im looking to purchase the q6600 processor, an evga 8800gt, 4gb of ram, and a p35 chipset motherboard right after thanksgiving... would this comp be future proof and be able to handle games in future (2-3+ years?)
i want to buy this but im afraid that it will be trash here in a few months.. what do you guys think?
if i should change anything what should i change?
thanks -josh
