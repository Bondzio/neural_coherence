you can do it that way or as the other posters mentioned.
the main reason ide 1=port is still available is that most cd drives are still eide.
you probably have a sata port just waiting for the hd.
if you did a new build using the old eide hd then the sata installed(if you had one), you swap data over to it, then release old hd off and then use the ide port for cd alone.
still is the norm for newer mtrbds.
unitl *only* sata ports are available and that's coming.
of course you can get eide adapter card fro full eide usage.
