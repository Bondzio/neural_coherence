Also on FB it is suggesting to update to IE 8. The last time I update IE it messed up my HP Printing the Photo Director/Imaging program. IT Wouldn't scan. I don't know whether to update to this browser or not.

You would be better off installing another browser (ie: Firefox, Chrome, or Safari), as they all support the latest flash player (unless you're running with a 64 bit browser, Adobe Flash Player doesn't yet support 64 bit versions of any browser).
