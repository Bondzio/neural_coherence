i'm not a gamer and i don't even usually watch videos on my multimedia pc, so video performance is good to have but hardly essential for me.
it's a lot more important on my notebook, on which i do occasionally watch dvds when traveling.
but, even then, it's a lot less important than cpu speed, ram, and hdd capacity.
