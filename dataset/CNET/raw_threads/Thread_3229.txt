I plug it into my PCI-E slot and everything is fine, the fan spins and it seems alright. However, I un-installed and disabled the onboard drivers and plugged my monitor into the card. I get nothing, my monitor doesn't even recognize a new device in the system. I went into the BIOS and made sure it was set on 'AUTO' to read new devices, and it was set. This is the first time I am using the PCI-E slot, is there anything I have to do to activate the slot? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You

Also try setting the &quot;Init display&quot; to PCIe or others. Sorry if that isn't the right words for your BIOS but there is no standard so I just look to see if it's an option. Also, some of these boards need a power supply connection. I note this in case yours did and you forgot. Bob

I know that card (as I have the same card) is a x16 and I don't know what putting it in the x1 slot would do. It also takes a minimum 300 watt power supply and I couldn't find what the 4700 comes with. It also mentions that you have to tell what slot you are putting the card into for it to work. Hope that helps. Wayne
