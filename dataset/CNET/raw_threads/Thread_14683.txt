My question is can I install both the second hard drive and firewire card at the same time? Or do I have to install and configure each of them separately?

Microsoft's Windows seems to trip over itself as we do this so I found it best to add one item at a time. In closing, not all versions of Windows supports firewire and some versions of Windows needs patches for big drives. The configuration of such is automatic except the hard disk partitioning and format. Bob
