I am running a new computer using the MSI MS-7325 motherboard. For the stats I have looked up it always says the MB supports AMD 64 X2 up to 5200+. I am currently running a 5400 processor... so I am wondering, is it safe to assume that the MB can handle any AM2 64 X2. Possibly the 6400? Also. I saw one website selling this MB bundled with the new Phenom X4 processor.... is it even compatible? Would this MB be able to run even the Phenom processors?

Since, you gave no mention of the system model#, if OEM then that maker is the 1st place to visit fo such an update, otherwise the mtrbd. support website if a generic system or DIY. Its important to note the &quot;rev. level and EXACT mtrbd. model#&quot; when doing any bios update should you go that direction. You said, &quot;MB supports AMD 64 X2 up to 5200+. I am currently running a 5400&quot; thus the answer is already YES. You are currently running 1 cpu above the listed level. Wherever you got your system has already provided a bios update/status that supports newer cpus. BUT, beware it does stop at some point. Just be sure to check the specs and go from there. This is why, I can't answer the remaining Phenom cpu side of the ?, as the real model# for the mtrbd. if different from waht you have, you didn't state what that other website bundled pkg. was in specs., must compare!!! then decide. tada -----Willy
