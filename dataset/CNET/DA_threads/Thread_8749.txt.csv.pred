1.1.1	i just bought a asus a8n-sli motherboard for a fresh build .	St
1.1.2	i have a few very knowlageable friends when it comes to computers but cant seem to get a straight answer as to which ram configuration is better- 4x512MB or 2x1GB .	St
1.1.3	one friend says i should go for the 4x512 because its faster that way because of duel-channel processing .	St
1.1.4	my other friend says go with the 2x1G because with 4 sticks my mem gets clocked down from 400 to 333 .	St
1.1.5	Can anyone shed some more light on this subject ?	Ques
1.1.6	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	What happens sometimes is the CPU memory bus with all those parts on it has to take a small speed reduction due to & quot ; bus loading & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	I 'll let you google.com about bus loading , but you get dual channel with 2 sticks .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	your ddr-400 will run at ddr-400 regardless of capacity .	St
1.3.2	most mobo 's have to run 4 sticks *slightly* slower ( 2T command rate ) than 2 sticks ( 1T command ) .	St
1.3.3	however , two fast 1gb sticks may be more expensive than four equally fast 512mb sticks .	St
1.3.4	unless you plan on doing some *extreme* OC'ing , i 'd go with 2 good quality 1gb sticks and tweaking them to lower the CAS and/or boost the speed .	St
1.3.5	here 's a review of your board 's memory handling : http : //www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx ? i=2589 & p=6	Ques
1.4.1	Actually , they both ARE right .	St
1.4.2	2 x 1GB should run faster than 4 x 512MB in theory .	St
1.4.3	In reality , cycles on RAM make VERY little difference to the average user .	St
1.4.4	The largest ( and ONLY reason IMHO ) to buy performance RAM is to overclock it .	St
1.4.5	I 'm running DDR500 ram at 1:1 3-3-2-7 at 2.6v and can run it up to 270MHz , could n't even THINK of that with standard RAM at 200MHz .	St
1.4.6	If you are OC'ing a lot , then u need hi-perf mem sticks and want 2 x 1GB .	St
1.4.7	If u just want fast and maybe a little OC ( like 10 % of cpu clock speed ) then 4 x 512 saves u money and should work great .	St
1.4.8	Personally , one of my reasons for spending nearly twice as much on my 2 x 1GB OCZ Platinum sticks of DDR500 was to OC them .	St
1.4.9	My AMD X2 3800+ cost me 380 , the 4400+ cost 960 .	St
1.4.10	I 've got my little 2.0GHz running up to 2.68 stable .	St
1.4.11	That is a 11 % OC OVER the base 2.4GHz of the 4400 at a total cost of maybe 240 extra for me .	St
1.4.12	Plus , DDR500 should have a longer life for me , as RAM speeds always go up , u are not likely to buy another puter that uses 200MHz RAM , but 250MHz would n't disappear as quickly .	St
1.4.13	Things to consider .	St
1.4.14	Cheers .	Polite
1.5.1	Based on the info ( below ) ... 2 @ 1024MBs a looks like the the better , safer bet .	St
1.5.2	If you find other wise , let us know .	St
1.5.3	Seem to recall something about this in conjunction with earlier versions of the memory controllers in the Athlon64s .	St
1.5.4	BTW , did n't have any luck on bus loading ... you ?	Ques
