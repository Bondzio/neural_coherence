according to a conversation with epson, the epson workforce pro 4540 do not have memory like other printers.
they also didn't want to comment on how it works either.
about comparing the two epson workforce pro 4540 vs hp officejet pro 8600 premium, which one would you lean towards and why?
my findings so far: according to just specs sheets the hp 8600 looks good but according to videos the epson 4540 looks pretty good =\
