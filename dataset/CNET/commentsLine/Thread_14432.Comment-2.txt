1. does your desktop already have a network card (ethernet card) 2. make sure your powerbook g4, already have a wireless capability (have a wireless card.. read the manual) 3. you need a accesspoint router (the most common is an access point with 4 port router) --- many brand you can choose from, i.e.
apple, linksys, d-link, netgear, belkin, 3com, just to name a few... 4. you may need a repeater or range expander to cover the house.
(accesspoint can be use as a repeater, look while you are looking for the accesspoint above) 5. of course you will need a network cable basic setting or connection is: cable modem -&gt;&gt; accesspoint/router --&gt; pc (and wireless laptop) place that accesspoint/router as close as possible to the center area, where you will be using your laptop (remember, you need to connect the accesspoint/router and your desktop, to the cable modem using a cable (hardwired) if you still have not enough range coverage, then you need a repeater/range expander, which should be placed somewhere in the middle (in between) your accesspoint and the outer range of your area.
accesspoint ---- repeater/range expander ---- farthest distance you need.
(accesspoint -- not here ----------- not here -- farthest distance you need.)
after that, you need to configure and update your accesspoint/router firmware.
don't forget to secure your wireless, by enabling the wep/wpa or wpa2 (which ever available) and use mac filtering.
for detail configuration, you would be better to search google for it.. or maybe ask this forum later on when you are ready.
