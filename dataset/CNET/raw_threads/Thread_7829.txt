2582	0	46037	545081	NR	Unknown	11/16/04 6:45 AM	1.1005875E12	BIOS	I have a Gateway Select 1000, WindowsXP, with the SP2. The Motherboard BIOS are OAASNP05. The sound does not work at all, how (in details) can I reflash the BIOS to make the sound work? Please e-mail me at reassg@earthlink.net Thanks, George

Many onboard sound systems have a simple disable/enable in the BIOS, but drivers can be elusive. For your machine, if they are not at Gateway.com then you can install a sound card and resolve the issue. Bob

Installing the card can stress many owners since they may not install sound drivers and ... XP and Microsoft does not do this for us. Bob

If you want your post removed because of your publicly posted email address, just click the button &quot;report offensive message&quot; and ask for it's removal. 2. To correct the missing drivers for a sound card, I read and follow the directions that came with the sound card. Almost no cards today will just &quot;work&quot; without the owner installing the driver. To make matters worse, its rare to see the same instructions. Bob
