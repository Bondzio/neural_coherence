<s> I uninstalled this machine so I could fix my daughters X73, and when I clean uninstalled the X73 program and reinstalled the X1150 the scanner part refused to budge. </s>
<s> I have unplugged, replugged, uninstalled and reinstalled. </s>
<s> I have this problem into Lexmark, but they have loads of problems before mine, so if anyone can help me, I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> windows me 128 mgs ram Thank you Flora </s>
<s> Uninstalled or unplugged? </s>
<s> You don't uninstall the program to unplug the scanner. </s>
<s> I assume you meant that you plugged it back into your PC, re-installed the software, and now it doesn't work? </s>
<s> You assume correctly. </s>
<s> I'm sorry I confused you. </s>
<s> I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it. </s>
<s> I unplugged from the electrical outlet and then plugged it back in. </s>
<s> I have tried everything that I have found when I searched &quot;Google&quot; and the Lexmark troubleshooting web site. </s>
<s> Thanks again Flora </s>
<s> Assumptions: Trio= printer, copier, flatbed scanner. </s>
<s> What OS? </s>
<s> XP? </s>
<s> USB connection w/2.0 specifications. </s>
<s> USB cable secure in Trio and PC? </s>
<s> Lexmark program used to scan, control program to test scan? </s>
<s> No yellow question marks in &quot;Device Manager&quot;? </s>
<s> Printer works ok? </s>
<s> No error messages on program re-install? </s>
<s> No double listing of Trio in printers and &quot;add/remove programs&quot;? </s>
<s> no error messages when scan of document attempted? </s>
<s> Power light ON on Trio? </s>
