ok so i've pretty much decided what i'm going to get thought i'd give it one last think through before buying it all... case: rosewill r114a case; $57 psu: antec sl450 $68 (buy.com) motherboard: msi neo2 platnium nforce4 ultra $163 (or $152 @ buy.com if in stock) cpu: amd 64 3500+ $269 ram: 1 gig corsair dual-channel pc3200(2x 512mb)$155 sound card: audigy 2 zs gamer $112(buy.com) cd drive: plextor sata dvd+-rw 8mb cache $106 video card: asus eax700-pro $250 monitor: ctx 19&quot; crt $159 os: xp pro sp2 $146 hd: seagate sata 160gb 7200rpm $135 modem, mouse, keyboard: $45 or so.
so buying splits... $332 @ buy.com if they have the msi board.
-$152 without... $162 @ tigerdirect.com ram and anti-static wristband $1162 @ newegg.com minus board.
+$170 with it.
------ $1656 anything else i need to look into before i start buying things?
was planning on buying stuff this weekend... have floppy drive waiting to go in too and extra what i assume are ide cables that i can use to hook it up.
