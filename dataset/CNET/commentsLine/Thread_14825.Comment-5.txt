i fully agree with you.
this is dell's fault!
they should pay for the replacement.
the problem is contacting dell's tech service and dealing with the hours of waiting and language barrier to likely have to fight repeatedly with them over this issue.
outsourcing is done for one reason...to save money and that isn't only related to cheaper labor, it's related to poorer service.
i've, this time, chosen to bypass the dell tech service nightmare and pay the price for a replacement card.
they absolutely, however, need to take the harddrive bios flash solution off of their website!
thanks for the comment.
