hi everyone i need help choosing an antenna, im looking a directional antenna for a project.
so far i found an antenna:  but im not sure about the quality of the antenna so im asking you guys.
also i would like to know how much range i can look at with a 20dbm transmitter and a 36dbm/4w amplifier.
(transmitter -&gt; amplifier -&gt; antenna).
also if someone knows a better alternative it would be great.
thank you in advance.
