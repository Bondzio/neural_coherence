<s> I have a 500 GB Maxtor OneTouch 4 USB desktop drive that I use for archival stuff, formatted into a 400 GiB HFS+ and a 64 GB FAT partition. </s>
<s> Except when I was upgrading my HD and upgrading to Snow Leopard, I used it as a temporary Time Machine drive in case of drive failure during the transfer process. </s>
<s> All of a sudden, I get this message: &quot;Mac OS X can't repair the disk &quot;Maxtor 400 GB.&quot; You can still open or copy files on the disk, but you can't save changes to files on the disk. </s>
<s> Back up the disk and reformat it as soon as you can.&quot; The FAT partition appears to be fine. </s>
<s> So my questions are- what may have caused this, and how stable can I expect the drive to be in the near future? </s>
<s> I've already started transferring data off the drive, but I was really hoping to wait until Black Friday to get a new drive. </s>
<s> Will information on the damaged partition be &quot;safe&quot; for the time being? </s>
<s> Equally interesting to me is what could have caused this. </s>
<s> I haven't run Time Machine backups to the drive for at least a week, and have done no other major file operations besides reading movie files. </s>
<s> The drive isn't making any sounds that would indicate drive failure, and it seems to read just fine- was this just the result of a random software glitch that corrupted the data structure somehow? </s>
<s> Interestingly, I was checking the size of various folders, and I noticed that the Backups.backupdb folder, which should be around 65 GB last I checked, reported as taking up over 230 GB of space (when I started the backups a few weeks ago, there was only 80 GB of space to begin with.) </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> buy your new one on Black Friday, move all the data onto the new one reformat the old one. </s>
<s> The warning did not have any specific time frame. </s>
<s> The drive could be kaput even as I type this. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Sounds like a plan- I'll just backup the stuff I really don't want to lose and cross my fingers. </s>
<s> What do you think can cause something like this? </s>
<s> just a random software error corrupted something? </s>
<s> Or do you think the drive itself may be suspect? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If it reformats nicely, it may well be fine but I would be wary of it in the future. </s>
