past few months my computer has been freezing and honestly i dont know why.
at first i thought it was a virus or malware, scanned and scanned again.
nothing came up, so i tried to reinstall windows.
that didnt work still froze.
then my psu went, thought maybe thats why it was freezing because it was old.then i thought maybe there is a virus but i need to really clean it out, so i got a hd scrubber, that didnt work.
this machine is old, could this be because of its age?could the motherboard be shorting out?
or the processor?
its about 5 years id say.
its a : amd athlon 2700 processor 120 gb hdd 2gb ram win xp pro 400w psu
