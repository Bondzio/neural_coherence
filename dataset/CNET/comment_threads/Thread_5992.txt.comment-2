Envision monitors are &quot;low-ends&quot; offering even if a big monitor, you get what you pay for.
At $100, if it lasts 3yrs.
you got your money's worth, but generally you may or may not have a problem under typical use.
If you can afford more, get a better monitor, even a LCD is better if a cheap one than a CRT type.
Check Wal-Mart as a source or online from them to get an idea of pricing.
You can visit other office outlet stores or wait for a sale as this is the time for sales or close outs.
