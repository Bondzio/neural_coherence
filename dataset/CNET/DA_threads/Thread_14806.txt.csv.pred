1.1.1	Recently both my iPod 5th gen video and my laptop a 7 year old Hp dv4150us died .	St
1.1.2	now i am facing a problem because after my iPod died i would listen to my iTunes collection on my laptop/desktop computer .	St
1.1.3	i mostly use iTunes for its DRMd HD Tv shows and movies and a little bit of music ( a combo of Pandora and my riped cds ) so it would only make sense to buy a product that runs iTunes so i can do both .	St
1.1.4	so i was thinking of buying the Hp Mini 311 sense it has the Nvidia ion graphics processor and a 720p screen , but that left me thinking mabey i need something smaller like an iPod touch .	St
1.1.5	from a price standpoint to buy a 32 gig ipod touch would set me back $ 300 for $ 99 more i could have a fully functioning computer , HD hardware support+ and HD screen , and not to mention flash support .	St
1.1.6	i would n't mind having an ipod but i dont really want to carry around a giant netbook if i feel like listening to music .	St
1.1.7	i really dont know which to pick .	St
1.1.8	But i can tell you this i do n't want an iPad because i need something cheep that is n't useless .	St
1.1.9	Thanks for the help .	St
1.2.1	I can only warn you that the usual netbooks do not play HD .	St
1.2.2	You have to look at the better netbooks that have the HDMI connection and the Nvidia ION or better display chipset .	St
