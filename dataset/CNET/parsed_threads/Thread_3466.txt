<s> Is it possible to have 1 wireless keyboard control 2 PCs at the same time? </s>
<s> Say i type on the keyboard and the things I type come out as tect on both PCs. </s>
<s> If this is possible, how would I go about setting it up? </s>
<s> I would buy 2 wireless keyboards, and set up the 2 recievers, but is there a way to set them to the same frequency? </s>
<s> I have never owned a wireless keyboard so im not sure if this is possible or not. </s>
<s> Wireless keyboard only works for one pc at a time. </s>
<s> You can however move the usb thing that comes with the keyboard to another pc and use the keyboard from there. </s>
<s> You can't operate 2 pcs simultaneously but you can install a KVM switch and use 1 mouse and keyboard with multiple monitors and pcs. </s>
<s> check with your local Micro Center or Comp USA or Best Buy or Radio Shack. </s>
<s> I was wondering about KVM switches and had a few questions about them. </s>
<s> I was told I could only have my monitor, keyboard and mouse all hooked up at once. </s>
<s> From what you were saying I could only have my mouse and keyboard hooked up and keep my 2 monitors. </s>
<s> Can I just only hook up my mouse and keyboard? </s>
<s> If I can just hook up the mouse and keyboard, what is the delay between switching from one PC to the other? </s>
<s> Using a KVM switch you can operate 2 computers using one keyboard,monitor, and mouse(...KVM). </s>
<s> However, I don't believe you can address both units at the same time( at least in my experience). </s>
<s> You use a hot key or manual switch to toggle between desktops. </s>
<s> If the two machines are networked,you can of course move files between them. </s>
<s> You can have 2 PC's with 2 monitors controlled by one keyboard and 1 mouse. </s>
<s> The speed of switching depends on what kind of KVM you get. </s>
<s> There are KVM switches that can work with PS/2 or USB keyboards and mice. </s>
<s> The PS/2 KVM switch switches between PC's faster than the USB version (1 second vs. 3-4 seconds) because with the USB version, the PC you switch to has to re-recognize the device vis usb. </s>
