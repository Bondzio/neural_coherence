<s> I have a 2010 MacBook Pro computer that wirelessly connects to the internet via an Apple Time Machine. </s>
<s> I currently have an HP Photosmart C7200 printer that I could never get to function wirelessly. </s>
<s> Is there any e-printers (multi function) Scan and print that I could get to work wirelessly for all functions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> One of the things I like to do is just walk through The Apple Store. </s>
<s> Often I see a printer there and it's not wired in but on wifi. </s>
<s> I bet you would want that printer. </s>
