yes, that is exactly what i want to do.
my wifes home networking system will only connect to one isp.
i was hoping to use the much faster fiber optics connection for my pc instead of the slower wireless that i'm using now.
so, i guess you are saying there is no way to connect to two different isp's using the same fiber optics connection, right?
ok,thank you for your input.
i appreciate it.
