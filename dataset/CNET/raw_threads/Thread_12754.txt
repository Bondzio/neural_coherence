That beep sequence helps ID what is at fault. If need be, reduce system to bare minimum, you don't need any drives for then. Plus, verify any or all jumpers from whatever location. Recheck your work, don't take anything for granted. Be sure pin-1 to pin cables, etc. and fully seated . tada ------Willy
