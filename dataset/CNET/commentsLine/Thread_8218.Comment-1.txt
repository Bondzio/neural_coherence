recently, i bought a few upgrades for my desktop.
after a few hours of troubleshooting, i still can't get the thing to boot up.
the only thing that i can think of at this point is that maybe the power supply isn't strong enough to handle everything.
here is a list of the upgraded parts:     any help resolving the issue woul dbe greatly appreciated.
