My current graphics card is an S3 Trident onboard VGA. I've attempted to include the onboad output with a PCI card for the setup and also 2 PCI cards. Each card when individually in use works fine, but when i attempt to use them in a multiple monitor setup, the computer says one is a [Code 10: The device does not work.] My only explanation is that the bios wont let me have the setup cause the second card does not show up when i boot it. The bios dates to 2001. Any help would be GREAT. thanx

Have you tried a dual output PCI card like a Matrox or a pair of things that others have seen working? It's not a BIOS issue. Bob

I did have a few dual PCI card setups. All were combos like a pair of ATI cards that had the needed dual display capable drivers or a pair of Matrox Millenium cards. Been there, done that. It's all in the cards and drivers. Bob
