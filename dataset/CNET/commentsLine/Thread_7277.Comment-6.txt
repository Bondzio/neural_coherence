i didn't read the test result so i can't tell if it's the old issue.
as to replacing many drives that's pretty common in some machines as the drive is in some hot area of the case.
the drives last a year or 2. at least drives are cheap.
as to installing windows, i used dell's install notes for that machine.
i rarely have to dream up another method.
