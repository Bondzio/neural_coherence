Estimating 2500 b&W, 1000 color copies/day. We don't need alot of whistles just volumn. Any suggestions. Also where can I find cost/page info for comparisons?

Too often the output can easily outstrip the basic makeup of anything in the $1000 range. You're going to be working this to death. Visit any copier/m-f printer and check the lifecycle specs or similar. Further, if you do buy, that you seriously consider a &quot;service contract&quot; to be beyond any warranty period. In fact, it maybe better to have double the devices in order not to overwork any one device. Otherwise, expect to replace such in short period to be rid of persistant problems and/or carry &quot;maintenance kits&quot; to have on-hand for x-number(usage) periods to lessen typical problems. Heaven forbid, you get into &quot;duplex&quot; demands. tada -----Willy

We were using a Laserjet 4100 that fit well in the area available, but it simply wasn't capable of the amount of output we need. For me, price is less of an obstacle than size and reliability are. Any suggestions?

Either you buy or lease something that actually is robust and can handle heavy output. Otherwise, expect to replace the new printer because you exceeded its std. output and on a constant basis, lets not fool ourselves. If you get beyond typical usage, you gotta have the stuff that can take it. I found HP, Minotla(sp), and Okidata printers robust overall, but again find a match you need. If copying is more in demand, then Xerox and its offering are still up choice. Good officesupliers/vendors or similar will consel you on your needs and try to make a match. Your duplexing needs will on its own cause grief. Too often once you reverse the paper path to complish duplexing, it gets involved. In other words it a mechanical nightmare, so again having a robust printer/copier helps alot. As for size, it becomes too big an issue, then relocate if possible, generally speaking, the bigger it is or the more you want out of it, tends to be larger units. However, newer models are smaller for just that reason to fit customer needs. I can only say further, if you find something that does everything you want but its big, live with it(if possible);). tada -----Willy

My late husband had one that was quite good. Here is Lexmark's website for you to look around in: http://www.lexmark.com/lexmark/site/home/0,3634,204816596_0_0_en,00.html Hope this helps.

I personally like HP above all others for Small Office use.
