<s> I ran chkdsk /r on a Windows drive that detected a couple bad sectors. </s>
<s> (Windows was freezing) It notified that it found and fixed all errors successfully. </s>
<s> My question is, how long could this fix work for? </s>
<s> What are people's success rates with this when ALL bad sectors ARE fixed? </s>
<s> Because my understanding is that bad sectors could spread causing even more drive failure. </s>
<s> Alternatively could a bad shutdown or power outage cause bad sectors, therefor causing the drive to still be good in all other areas? </s>
<s> In which case a chkdsk /r would be a permanent fix. </s>
<s> We can't know the future for this drive. </s>
<s> Today's drives are made to have zero bad sectors as the drives map in spares and more. </s>
<s> I must avoid a deeper discussion about how that works but when a drive fails to the point it is showing bad sectors to the OS then you know to not trust it. </s>
<s> That is, backup now or don't complain later. </s>

<s> you might consider downloading and running the HD manufacturer's diagnostics utility and do a thorough read/write analysis. </s>
<s> If the utility finds errors in media integrity, it may be able to remap the bad allocation units to spares. </s>
<s> If any such repairs are needed, it's time to get a replacement HD on hand ASAP. </s>
<s> Backup or, better yet, create a full image of the drive on another one while waiting for arrival of the new drive. </s>
