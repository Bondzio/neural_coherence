I have exactly the same problem with a Maxtor 250 Gb HD in an ICY BOX enclosure, XP, firewire-access and motherboard doesn't support USB2 either.
The disc is still an active disc in my system managment and disc managment but I had no access to it.
But NTSF/FAT32 isn't recognised ... A quick format solves the problem temporary.
But the problem will occur again soon.
I guess the problem is on a driver-level or BIOS-level, recognising the disc.
If you find a solution u can mail me .. christianblock01@yahoo.com.
