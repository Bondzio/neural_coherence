hi, i'm new to this forum, but i really need to find out how important the gpu clock speed is regarding graphics cards.
i'm probably either gonna get a bfg nvidia 7600 gs oc 512mb card which has 420mhz clock speed or an xfx geforce 7600 gt xxx edition 256mb card which has 590mhz clock speed.
both cards have a memory clock speed of 800mhz.
can anyone help me with deciding which one would be better?
i think the one with 512mb would be better but i honestly have no idea how important the gpu clock speed is.
any help is much appreciated.
