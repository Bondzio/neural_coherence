Your suggested reference seems to cover hard drives, not flash drives.
I also experienced a sudden &quot;USB Drive not recognized&quot; on my Lenovo ThinkPad laptop with Win XP on a Philips 4Gb pen drive that had been working flawlessly for a year or two, losing access to the 3.75 Gb of data stored on it :-(( Tried on one other PC with same result.
Any suggestions for a possible recovery?
