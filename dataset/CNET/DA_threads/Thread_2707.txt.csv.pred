1.1.1	The last week or so , our internet connection has been off and on .	St
1.1.2	The lights on the modem report no internet connection -- then sometimes 10 , sometimes 30 minutes later , all is well .	St
1.1.3	I do n't know if this is Charter cable , or my modem .	St
1.1.4	We do not have tv , or a second hookup , so I ca n't just unplug the modem and then try another hookup .	St
1.1.5	The modem is 5 years old ( Motorola Surfboard 5100 ) .	St
1.1.6	Unfortunately , we have VOIP phone service so I ca n't call Charter when this is down .	St
1.1.7	I have called them before and I 've always gotten the & quot ; there 's nothing wrong with our connection & quot ; answer -- again , when the internet connection is running , of course its working properly .	St
1.1.8	Is there any diagnostic I can run , to determine if the problem is an old modem or my ISP ?	Ques
1.1.9	I can always get another modem and plug it in , then re-sell it on amazon if the new modem is n't any better off , but I 'd lose 20-30 bucks in the exchange .	St
1.1.10	I 'd like to try something else first .	St
1.1.11	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	I learned this long ago .	St
1.2.2	Use their cable modem even if it 's 1.50 a month .	St
1.2.3	Their unit is their problem and the unit my cableco works for over 8 hours after the power goes out .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	if its too much trouble for even you ... yeah Charter told me it would cost an extra 2 bucks/mo , and I 've more than made up for the price of the modem ( $ 80 or so IIRC ) by avoiding that fee over the 5 years of service .	St
1.3.2	Of course I 'm experiencing the drawbacks of my strategy now ... Anyways , hopefully someone can come up with some magical way/software utility that can help me see if my modem is working right..	St
1.4.1	I just got an idea -- perhaps the issue is my modem overheating -- that might explain why the outages are intermittent -- and this is the end of July ( live in desert region ) .	St
1.4.2	Is there any way to detect the temperature of my modem ( apart from dunking it into a bucket of water then sticking a thermometer in the water ) ?	Ques
1.4.3	If in fact this is being caused by overheating , this problem would not be solved by getting a new modem -- at least , not solved over the long run .	St
1.4.4	I have SIW ( system information for windows ) , a nice utility that gives a ton of system information ( even keys for MS products ) , but it did n't have this information .	St
1.4.5	I 've had my modem in an enclosed space , standing right next to the back of the desktop unit , which would be providing a rather warm environment .	St
1.4.6	Anyways I 'll put it in an open space tonight and then see if these problems continue over the next few days .	St
1.5.1	Here local thrift shops have used broadband modems of all kinds .	St
1.5.2	If your local area it should be also , depending on town/city .	St
1.5.3	Its worth the try .	Sug
1.5.4	Since , you mentioned thi is a 5yr .	St
1.5.5	old box , yeah maybe its suffering the effects of wear & tear , so a used modem is worth the swap , we 're talking well under $ 10 .	St
1.5.6	Also , a friend with a cell phone certainly would be a friend if borrowed to call during an outage .	St
1.5.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	want to check for oxidiazation of the cable pins at both ends or else , the loose-ness of the fittings .	St
1.6.2	How old is the cable line itself ?	Ques
1.6.3	How about the adapter point ?	Ques
1.6.4	Is it still the same or has been upgraded by the provider ?	Ques
1.6.5	If you have a spare cable lying around , you could try swapping it .	St
1.7.1	Its been a day and a half since I shifted the modem to a more ventilated place , and it has n't gone offline yet .	St
1.7.2	I 'll have to give it a few more days to be sure , but if this remains the case , I wo n't need to worry about any other troubleshooting .	St
1.8.1	After three full days of no outages ( after moving it to a ventilated location ) , yesterday afternoon three times it went out briefly -- about 10 minutes at a time .	St
1.8.2	I was just about thinking that this was taken care of ... . OK I 'll just see how this goes for another few days .	St
1.8.3	Like I said , I have little faith in Charter 's tech support telling me anything but & quot ; the line is clear from our end. & quot ; That 's all I 've ever heard from them in the past , as well as AOL in the early years of internet ... .	St
1.8.4	If I can live with a short spell of outages I 'll just bite the bullet ... if it gets too annoying I 'll get a replacement model and see if that wo n't do the trick .	St
