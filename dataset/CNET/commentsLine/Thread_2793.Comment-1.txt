i need a desk-top but i need no bells and whistles.
speed is not terribly important nor is memory.
100g hd and a dozen or so ram is all i'll need.
i do not game nor will i ever.
i need xp office and powerpoint.
other than that only a 17'' flat-screen monitor and a cd-burner completes my package.
i don't need any technical support either.
i really don't need a warranty.
i've used a presario 700 laptop for the last four years and had no problems.
thus, should i purchase a new budget desktop or go to ebay and buy the separate components?
tnanks in advance... cavaleer
