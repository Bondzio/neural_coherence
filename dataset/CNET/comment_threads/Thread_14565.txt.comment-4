With the next upgrade I would lose the TV card.
Since picking up the ATI and Hauppauge cards I haven't had to replace them.
The cards also tended to be larger and hotter.
And there is so little difference in SD TV card image quality that it's not worth changing.
You can read and see this issue as you tune a HDTV to SD programming.
All the warts show up.
