I've noticed that some external hard drives have a port to connect AC power and then a seperate port for the USB.
Does anyone know what the power slot is for?
I know that it's meant for an adaptor to be pluged into, but I though USB ports can provide power as well as transfer data.
Just curious.
I've had a drive for some time that has both and I've always just pluged the USB cable into the laptop.
Thanks for any information you guys can give.
