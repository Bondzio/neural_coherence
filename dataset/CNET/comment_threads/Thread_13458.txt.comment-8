Yes he is correct you do not need to contact microsoft to finish the instalation but there is a problem with the HDD the size is not any concern here however the speed might be causing the problem standard HDD's run at 7200 RPM's and older ones run at 5600 (i belive) if the hard drive is running slower than this there might be some communication issues while trying to write to the HDD at the very least it will take a long time to install and will cause bottlenecking durring bootup and many other critical times also with that small of a HDD it has got to be reaching about 7-10 years old (roughly) which exeeds the expected lifetime of a HDD from that era even if it was not a faulty HDD i would highly reccomend replacing it let us know how things turn out
