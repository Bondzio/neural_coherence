if in fact lightening has done damage, you can't discount any possible damage on anything.
basically, you really can't fix it and/or a simple solution.
you swap and/or replace parts until it works.
i suggest you remove the current hd as a safeguard.
mount a spare or borrow hd and be sure it works.
then do an install of the os and be sure all is well.
if the usb ports don't work then, bad mtrbd., etc.. if not and it seems to work as in everything does what it supposedly does, then mount the old hd and swap data over.
hopefully, you can continue from there if a new hd.
if borrowed, get a new hd and repeat process.
otherwise, think new system or another pc, because by the time you fix it, it maybe another new system anyways.
i suggest the above as possible attempts at fixing the hd or in that direction may corrupt the data and you lose it.
you can also mount the old hd in a ext.
usb enclosure and using another pc, get data and burn to discs.
