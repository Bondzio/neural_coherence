I am a medical transcriptionist and work via my company's platform over the internet, so I am constantly online (high speed). I want to buy a laptop to work off of when I am away from home. I also want to be able to burn DVDs and CDs off of it. I'm looking to get something with at least 2GB RAM and 100 GB HD. My question is about the processor for this computer. I am so confused about what to look for and what would be best for what I am needing to do. Pentium 4 with hyper-threading, Pentium M, or Duo Core? I want whatever if the fastest, and I can't make heads nor tails of anything about these processors. It looks like greek to me. Please give me some advice! Thank you.

They're not really intended for laptops and run hot and are at the end of their product lifecycle. Pentium M: These are the mainstream notebook processors. They have very good performance and battery life. Celeron M: These are castrated (yes I said it) Pentium M processors. Only consider them if you're trying to economize (which you don't seem to be) Core Duo: A Pentium M with 2 CPU cores. The &quot;Core&quot; moniker is Intel's new marketing strategy and the label for all new processors. In June/July Intel should be releasing new Core Duo processors based on new CPU architecture. Core Solo: The new name for Pentium M. One the AMD side of the fence: Turion 64: AMD's notebook processor. Good performance but the Pentium M/Centrino/Core Duo is (imho) a better package. Mobile Athlon 64: This is really a desktop chip with advanced power saving. Since Athlons run cooler than Pentium 4s they are somewhat OK for a laptop but not if you really want cool running and long battery life. Mobile Athlon Sempron: A castrated (yes I said it again!) Mobile Athlon 64. For the economy minded.

Understand that the term Centrino includes 3 factors, the M CPU, a faster chipset, and a wireless capabiolity built in. The faster chipset is why they perform, in a lap top, at the level of a P4 in a laptop with a considerably higher clock rate.

Okay, I have checked out computers, and I am down to choosing between a notebook with 100GB HD, 2GB RAM, and either a 2GHz Duo Core processor or a 2.26 GHz Pentium M processor. The duo core is a little more expensive, and I am willing to pay it if it is worth the money. Any suggestions?

Core Duo is more efficient than pentium M processor. By paying a bit more you'll get a better processor and better performance. The one thing to do after purchasing is removing all the bundle softwares and do a quick turn up. All manufactures of laptop load alot of unecessary software.

I'm such a minion when it comes to this stuff, and on top of that, I'm a girl! Sorry. If you explain how to do whatever it is you are talking about, I will try to do it. Thanks. H.

This software is called bloatware because it takes up hard drive space, runs in the background, and slows the computer down. The best way to eliminate bloatware is to get a Windows XP CD, format the hard drive, and reinstall Windows.
