The HD has crashed, you need a recovery service if you deem the data that priceless. You can try what the link Robert offered as well. But, you description is good. Next time get you hands on Velcro fasteners/strips, stick to HD case and desk area to prevent future mishaps. tada -----Willy tada -----Willy
