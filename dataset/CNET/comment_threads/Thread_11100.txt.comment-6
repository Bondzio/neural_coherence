Since i dont know the exact model that you have, i'll have to assume a few facts here.
Base on your information, you can use 2 access points as bridge (assuming the belkin 54g ap and the motorola 54g ap are the model i saw on the web).
And from there, you can setup the remaining 802.11 routers as the wirless ap for your laptop computer(s) (one on each side of the bridge).
Make sure you use different SSID and channel for the bridges and Access Points.
For example: Belkin 54g access point, SSID=bridge_ID, channel=11 Motorola 54g access point, SSID=bridge_ID, channel=11 Belkin 802.11, SSID=client_ID, channel=6 netgear 802.11, SSID=client_ID, channel=6 the belkin 54g will connect with the belkin 802.11 via wire and the same goes for the Motorola 54g and netgear.
Now you have 2 network that bridge together and still able to roam your laptop between 2 networks.
Here is a PDF file so you can see how it work.
