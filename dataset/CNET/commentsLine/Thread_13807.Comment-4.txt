i'll keep this contained to my personal experiences.
i have more than one 1.5tb usb drive as i maintain backups and beyond those i have other backups on dvd, usb memory sticks and more.
the machines the 1.5tb usb drives are used on are a collection of machines at the office with vista, 7 with amd dual core, core duo, core 2 duo and i5 cpus.
it all works so i'd wonder why anyone would write it doesn't.
