Hello, thanks for the help.
At the moment it is just one continuous alarm beep type sound-have also read elsewhere that other people have experienced this and did what you said-hopefully will resolve the issue, i hope so because I don't really have the money to upgrade at the moment and i remember my system running games like far cry, half life 2, doom 3 and call of duty all very well, so gonna plug in the molex and pray for the best!
Thanks again.
