okay, so i think i disabled the onboard graphics in bios.
still not sure.
i went to get cleaner pro.
however.
the publisher asked the guru site to remove it.
guru offered an alternative.
which i just downloaded, installed, and ran.
seems to have worked.
i'm going to boot up now and take a look see.
