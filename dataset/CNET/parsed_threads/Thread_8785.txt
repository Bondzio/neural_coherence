<s> I'm having some problems with my system that I suspect may be related to my power supply. </s>
<s> The power supply itself seems to be in its last days. </s>
<s> When I start the PC up an electrical noise is noticeable coming from the supply. </s>
<s> Plus the computer is increasingly witnessing a repeated problem. </s>
<s> What happens is, the screen will suddenly turn off and go into the power saving state (because the graphics card stops sending a signal to the monitor), then immediately comes back on and the picture is all scrambled and the computer becomes unresponsive all together. </s>
<s> I don't believe it is the card itself because if music or such is playing when it happens the sound will also cut off, so I think the entire system freezes. </s>
<s> I also am unable to overclock the motherboard (even a little bit) since the system locks up after a minute or two after it boots. </s>
<s> This also points to a power problem. </s>
<s> So is it actually a power problem or is it sometime else I may be overlooking? </s>

<s> the oc'ing limit is probably the biggest indication. </s>
<s> ummm yeah, i'd say it's your psu. </s>
<s> what brand is it? </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> Since this seems to be a newer PC, at least from the processor stand point( AMD64) How old is the PSU??? </s>
<s> With your symptoms the first thing I would do is swap out the PSU. </s>
<s> A GOOD 450w supply should handle your PC. </s>
<s> But $35 450w PSU may not. </s>
