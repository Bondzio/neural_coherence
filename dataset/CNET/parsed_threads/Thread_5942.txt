<s> I have had a mac book for about a year now. </s>
<s> My husband and I are expecting a little girl in about 2 weeks and are looking to purchase our first camcorder. </s>
<s> I know that with a mac and wanting to use imovie and idvd you cant just go out and get any ole camera I am not really computer savvy and we are really just looking for something to capture the birth and special moments nothing professional. </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong I want the best quality that I can get... just cant pay an arm and a leg. </s>
<s> I really want something user friendly that is very compatible with imovie and idvd where I can just plug it in and it works... you know I dont want to have to do anything complicated to make it work!! </s>
<s> I have been researching and it is so confusing b/c the list that apple gives you apparently does not hold much weight seeing as though there are cameras on there that DONT work with macs. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP!!!!!!! </s>
<s> our price point is under 400$ hope someone can help oh and do you know if being an HD camera, if you have to film in either all SD or all HD to transfer the footage? </s>
<s> and What is the point in having a HD camera if after u transfer the footage and edit it then burn it to a DVD and it will be in SD. </s>
<s> THIS IS ALL SO CONFUSING FOR ME </s>
<s> at www.macworld.com You will find a whole section of reviews about this very subject. </s>
<s> I do know that the SONY video cameras, the ones with a hard drive, will work with iMovie09 AVOID any camera that records directly onto a DVD mini disk. </s>
<s> Two reasons; 1. </s>
<s> It is virtually impossible to edit the video as it must be converted from DVD format back to something that can be edited. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You cannot play the mini disk in your computer if it has a Slot Loading DVD drive, most new Apple machines do. </s>
<s> Good luck P </s>
<s> This camera is in your price range. </s>
