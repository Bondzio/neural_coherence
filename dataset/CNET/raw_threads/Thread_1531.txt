The below macro worked in 2003, but does not work in 2007, its a simple fit to page function: ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange.ScaleWidth 1, msoFalse, msoScaleFromBottomRight ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange.ScaleHeight 1, msoFalse, msoScaleFromBottomRight ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange.ScaleWidth 1, msoFalse, msoScaleFromTopLeft ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange.ScaleHeight 1, msoFalse, msoScaleFromTopLeft End Sub
