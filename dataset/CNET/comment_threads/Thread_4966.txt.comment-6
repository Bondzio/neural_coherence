Make sure you have them plugged in the green jack in the back.
I have seen many people pull out their hair and the jack order was different.
they did not look at the colors.
Try removing and reinstalling the driver again.
Did you get the driver from the CD that came with the board or was it something you downloaded?
(Try the CD to be safe) After that, go pip up a Sound Blaster Live or Audigy.
You will be much happier anyway.
