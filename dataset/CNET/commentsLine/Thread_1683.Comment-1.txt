hi everybody!!!!!!!
i have intel 946gzis original mobo with p4 at 3.4ghz dual core, gma3000, dual 512 mb ddr2 ram (667mhz),and 17&quot; lcd moniter .problem is that when i play games like nfs mostwanted ,i got good performance at 640*480 resolution but on lcd moniter it doesnt looks good (means good graphics),now when i change resolution t0 1024*768 it looks great on moniter but game speed goes slow.in my opinion it is due to high resolution of lcd because clarity comes on higher resolutions in lcd as compared to crt moniters.can you give me your opinion as well as solution .
