I've only experienced this with San Andreas. I've tried turning the settings down and the jerkiness still happens. Is it an overheating problem with my CPU or RAM or HDD??? I've been monitoring my video card temps with ATi Tool and it doesn't get past 45 degrees C with my ATI silencer cooler. Just to let you know, my rig is: -Athlon X2 4200+ -Radeon X850XT -1 GB RAM -80GB 7200 RPM It's really annoying and I can't play San Andreas. I'll try out some other games and let you know what happens. Thanks for any help in advance.

It's a little bit troublesome to set this each time I want to play my older games. Will the next generation PC games support dual core? (such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion???) Thanks again!

Everything worked without a hitch. I do have a problem with ATi's Driver. It will never update (and I've tried many times). I download them from ATi's Website ( https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&task=knowledge&folderID=27 ) I uninstall the previous drivers and CCC, restart, use Driver Cleaner Pro to remove all previous files, and restart again. I then install the stuff from the above website. The driver REMAINS the SAME, while the CCC is updated. Just to clarify, the latest driver version is NOT 8.231.0.0, right??? Any suggestions? The BIOS seems to be working fine, though. Thanks ahead of time!
