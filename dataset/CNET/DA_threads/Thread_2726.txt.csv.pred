1.1.1	can you suggest a decent 48 port unmanaged switch ?	Ques
1.1.2	Rupesh Narvekar	St
1.2.1	or required speed .	St
1.2.2	Personally , I always liked 3Com but they got bought by HP .	St
1.2.3	We picked up a 48 port baseline model for our school .	St
1.2.4	Its auto-sensing , 10/100 with a gigabit uplink and has worked fine .	St
1.2.5	We 've a couple of 24 port 3Coms and one POE used for the wireless system .	St
1.2.6	None have ever had a problem .	St
1.2.7	These are all their & quot ; baseline & quot ; models which are unmanaged , rack mountable and moderately priced .	St
1.2.8	I 'll recommend 3Com any day if you can still find their products but more about your needs would be helpful .	St
1.3.1	We have 2MBPS Direct Internet Line ( so 2 UP and 2 Down ) .	St
1.3.2	I am looking for a unmanaged switch nothing too complicated	St
1.4.1	has anybody had any issues with 3548XL-EN ?	Ques
1.4.2	I am planning to use Cisco 3745-HSEC-VPN/K9-ADSL-VOIP-6FE Modular Access Router Security Bundle with the swicth .	St
1.4.3	Rupesh Narvekar	St
1.5.1	Since you are considering Cisco for part of your system , you might want to stick with the brand .	St
1.5.2	Here 's a 48 port POE switch they offer .	St
1.5.3	I do n't know the price and suspect it might make me drop over .	St
1.5.4	http : //www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps5718/ps9967/ps9985/data_sheet_c78-502075.html	St
1.6.1	Like most cisco gear it will run forever .	St
1.6.2	This device is end of life and end of support so do n't pay a lot for it maybe $ 100 All depends what you want to do with it , if you just want to hook a bunch of stuff to your router it will do fine even if you run vlans and such .	St
1.6.3	Note this is a managed switch , you may have to do some basic config .	St
1.7.1	Will review that .	St
1.7.2	I am not married to Cisco , I am also looking at HP Procurve unmanaged switch .	St
1.7.3	I really do n't want any managed or smart Switches Rupesh	St
1.8.1	and since you mentioned VOIP , it sounds more like a business application for telephone use .	St
1.8.2	Digital phones need power and this is why I wondered if POE would be a better choice .	St
1.8.3	I think you 've not given enough details as to exactly what you want to accomplish but if all you want is a 48 port un-managed switch , you are can pick any name brand that offers such and consider it to be expendable .	St
1.9.1	This is about $ 1900..WOW	St
1.10.1	You did say you wanted VOIP and 48 ports but what I see is a business use system .	St
1.10.2	If you 're using VOIP type phones such as I 've seen in some environments , they need to be powered by something .	St
1.10.3	I ca n't imagine 48 wall outlets so suggested the POE switch .	St
1.10.4	These will power phones but not all of the ports will necessarily have that power on by default .	St
1.10.5	You turn power on only to the ports that need to power devices and you have a maximum amount of current to work with .	St
1.10.6	There is some management involved with POE switches but it 's not all that technical if it 's just power management .	St
1.10.7	But , if you 've already got power to all of your phones via some other method , you can still use a baseline switch .	St
1.10.8	I just thought this would eliminate a lot of extra wiring by getting it from the switch .	St
1.10.9	It 's up to you since we really can not envision the scope of the entire project .	St
