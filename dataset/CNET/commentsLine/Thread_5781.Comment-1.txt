for my graduation project as a senior next year for high school, i decided to build a computer.
normally i would wait until the end of august to construct it (price drops) but i want to build it sometime in july (that way i have time to make sure nothing goes wrong and i can enjoy it during the summer).
the one thing i'm having difficulty deciding on is picking the cpu.
because this system is more on the budget side, i'll be using cheaper processors.
i narrowed it down to the pentium 4 524 (3.06ghz 1mb l2 cache w/ ht), pentium d 805 (2.66ghz 2x!mb l2), or athlon 64 3500+ (2.2ghx 512kb l2).
i play games, but not at high resolutions and this is my first build so i'm not sure if i should handle an lga775 cpu.
any suggesstions?
