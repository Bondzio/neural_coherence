thanks for the advice.
i wasn't going to go into the store and just pick up one, and the advice of the so called tech people in the stores near is horrible.
i installed a geforce 9400 gt 1 gb ddr2.
it was reletively inexpensive (about $75 w/tax).
on google earth ad the flight simulator the performace was much better.
i haven't tried the golf game yet, but i'm well pleased.
i was ready to pay much more.
thanks agian, jerry
