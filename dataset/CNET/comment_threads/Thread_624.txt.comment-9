says the graphics on that one is EVGA nForce 650i Ultra is that as good as an 8800gt or so?
also 400 bucks is alot better than what i was going to spend at ibuypower.com It was going to come with speakers, mouse, and a keyboard.
All that with what i listed in my first post came to a bit over 800, with shipping 900.
But I suppose if money is the problem here, I could just buy the pc and use the speakers/mouse/keyboard i have now and gradually upgrade.
