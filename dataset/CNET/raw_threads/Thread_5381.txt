5971	0	331676	2986549	NR	MrKing.net	2/23/09 5:55 AM	1.2353685E12	help me find a replacement lcd monitor for my NEC Multisync	http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport...ctID=c00572527 It has a ATI Radeon Xpress 200 video card. and the only thing I have done since I bought it was to add a bunch of RAM to it. It has XP Home. I am wanting a new lcd monitor maybe 19&quot;, but no more than 22&quot;. I would like integrated speakers and a 5mm response rate or better. I also want a Swivel/Tilt base.) I know that integrated speakers arent usually very good, but I seldom use them.) I now have a NEC Multisync LCD1700M+ (The MultiSync LCD1700M+ 17&quot; TFT active matrix display has a 1280 x 1024@ 60Hz resolution with .264mm dot pitch. It has a horizontal frequency range of 30 - 81 kHz, vertical frequency range of 56 - 75 Hz, 160 degrees viewing angle, and built-in speakers. It supports analog inputs and uses 15-pin mini D-Sub. Black and white are colors available for this model. ) that I bought new quite a few years ago when they first came out, but it's starting to show its age. Will I need to get a new video card for a bigger Monitor? (Im thinking wide screen) I have been looking at some Samsung Monitors, but I honestly havent had much of a problem with my NEC after all these years. But I am open to suggestons. I also don't want to spend more than $200 for a new monitor. I have no problem with a refurbished monitor. I don't know if all the newer LCD Monitors allow me to use a VGA cord or not, but I need that also I think. Links to things would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance!!

I would suggest you double-check, but 22&quot; level resolutions of 1680 x 1050 - ish should not be a problem. Not sure how the bigger picture will look or how it will perform though. (BTW your HP link is dead) At $200, you're in 22&quot; territory. Samsung make some decent budget 22-inchers - shop around on Newegg, etc. I'm not an enormous fan of large cheap monitors (since they tend to be based around TN panels, which results in noticeable colour changes at the edges of a &gt;20&quot; monitor when sitting in front of it), but a 22&quot; is bearable for me for the most part and I'm sure for most, the colour shift wouldn't even register most of the time. I've used the '08 predecessor of this monitor in quad-monitor configurations and I felt it was as good as any 22&quot; monitor I've tried.

Basically, What I would like to have is a little bit bigger screen, but it doesnt necessarly have to be a 22&quot; screen, a 19&quot; wide screen could be just fine. So far, I have been looking at Dell, Samsung, and HP Monitors. I know there is a blue billion generic brand monitors, and while I have nothing against them, I question their reliability as well as quality. I wont be doing anything but surfing the net, watching DVD's (Not worried about High Definition for the most part) and running Online Poker Programs such as PokerStars ( www.pokerstars.com ) as well as the various other Online Poker Sites. I would either like built in speakers or some USB on the monitor itself, it does not have to have both. (If it did that would be great, just not required.) If I need to sacrafice a little smaller screen to have a better picture (resolution etc) then so be it. I really don't want a monitor that makes it hard to read text. (yes, I use Clear Type) The NEC Multisync 1700M+ that I've had for about 8 years has been outstandingly reliable, but was made in 2001, and im sure there are some new monitors out there that would just blow my mind when comparing this NEC to whatever is so many years newer. I have looked at Ebay, at pacificgeek, Ecost, and a few other sites and have been trying to look at the innumerous lcd monitor reviews, and keeping them all straight has become quite a challenge. I have hoped to come across a review site that had a dropdown of features so I could compare easier, but I have yet to find such a site. again, thank you for any input you may have, I am not as technologically (is that a word? heh) smart as many are. Thanks again. All Links to monitors that might fit what I am asking for would be GREATLY Appreciated.
