<s> Hey all, I have a question (obviously). </s>
<s> Ok, I'm planning on buying a new computer to set up as my main base station (yes, I use all the technical words), and placing my older computer in my room. </s>
<s> It's a custom built job, so if you need any specifications just let me know. </s>
<s> But the problem is, that it is quite loud, and also the fan on the side has a nice flashing blue light. </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to keep it on while I sleep, so I'd like it to be a lot less noisy. </s>
<s> Would buying a new tower shell solve this problem? </s>
<s> And are there certain towers known as more quiet as others? </s>
<s> Or could this have nothing to do with the tower, and if so, what could the cause of the noise be? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
