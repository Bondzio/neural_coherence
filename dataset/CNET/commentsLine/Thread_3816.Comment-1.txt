hi, i have 2 toshiba laptops both operating on xp and have wireless network setup.
i am able to get on the internet with both but i can only check email on one of them.
i am using hotmail as email account and when i log in and wait for it to open my mailbox, i get a page cannot be displayed error.
anyone have any trouble shooting ideas.
i have tried my gmail account also to no avail on the one machine so i don't think it is the email provider something with my settings on the one laptop.
any ideas greatly appreciated.
thanks, doug
