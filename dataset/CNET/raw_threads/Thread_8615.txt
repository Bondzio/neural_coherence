First off in my 1st rig using a Gigabyte Nvidia 670 4gb version, 2nd rig using Nvidia 560ti. In all games, I primarily use 1st rig for gaming, I'm getting a screen tear like a horizontal line one third of the way down my monitor. It's not actually tearing it seems the upper third of the screen is slightly behind being drawn than the rest of the screen. I enable vsync in all my games not point having the card pump out 200+ frames. Strnagely when I turn OFF vsync the tearing goes away but obviously my gpu gets hotter and fans speed up. I don't get it, vsync is supposed to eliminate tearing not cause it. Advice please?

And with games having bugs you're never sure that setting it to on will cure it. So start with the Nvidia controls then for each game look around for more settings in the game. Bob
