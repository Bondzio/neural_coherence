While trying to find and install a working driver for a DVD Drive on Windows 98 (if that's even possible), one program I tried screwed me over on both of my drives so now the computer will not detect either.
I need firmware for both.
The info I gathered on each: Ricoh Company RW5125A DVD/CDRW and... HP CD-WRITER PLUS 8000 Series 4x2x20x IDE HP C4465-56000 Please help, two drives down the drain really stinks I'll get more information or pictures if need be.
