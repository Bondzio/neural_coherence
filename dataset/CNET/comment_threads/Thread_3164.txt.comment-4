Does the connection icon happen to say something about &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; if you hover your mouse above it?
In that case, it looks different from how it normally looks when there is a full connection?
Two related things to check: 1.
Does the router management page show it as connected?
What IP-address?
2.
What does ipconfig (run it from the command prompt) exactly say about the IP-address of the PC, the gateway and the DNS?
