<s> I have a Canon Pixma mp780 all in one, and the scanner is stuck at one end and will not move. </s>
<s> When i try to scan or copy all I hear is loud clicking from the cables that move the scanner, and a message that says &quot;scanner error.&quot; The cable that is hooked to the scanner seems to be plugged in-I took off the right side of the printer where the motherboard is. </s>
<s> I need this to fax and scan docs, so any help would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> http://www.nifty-stuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4881 I couldn't find any discussion specifically about this failure but hope this helps you in disassembly and reassembly if you want to look inside. </s>

<s> Is this something that just started? </s>
<s> You didn't mention OS or computer hdwe being used. </s>
<s> Did you try uninstalling and reinstalling the software? </s>
<s> That would be the FIRST thing to try, assuming that nothing has been changed, hdwe, software or operating system. </s>
