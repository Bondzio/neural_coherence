I can only guess you know why you can't replace the internal radio (wifi/bluetooth/gps/cellular) cards yourself. Do you remember why? I don't want to upset you. Bob

But it appears you are not aware why these can run from cheap to not cheap or why you usual can't retrofit unless you void the maker's warranty. There are only a few GPS chip makers so that can't be your real question. I'm fine if you just come out and ask but writing a tutorial about product testing, passing FCC certifications and more must be limited to one short paragraph. Bob

3030	7	576139	5376938	5376778	R. Proffitt	10/25/12 8:06 AM	1.35115236E12	I'm going with...	You'll want to use a BlueTooth GPS unit for this. I didn't reveal all but I am on a team that developed some GPS feature for a product I won't reveal. As to what the FCC has to do with this is everything in this country. You pass or you can't sell it. Your question is one that would happen from folk that didn't know that. I must keep all that testing and such stuff short so I'll stop again on that here. So no, there is no chip for this. If there was you would have found it. But I have used those Bluetooth GPS units for setups that involve laptops. Bob

3030	9	576139	5377084	5376978	R. Proffitt	10/25/12 2:39 PM	1.35117594E12	Odd to call bluetooth in a laptop an &quot;unifier&quot;.	But your everyday bluetooth in a laptop can talk to mouse, keyboard, headset and a BT GPS without any big issues. So if someone wants to call that a unifier, let's let them. BT GPS units are what we call FUNGIBLE. When I need one I go to amazon.com and get another one. We can get some militarized units for many thousand bucks but sales didn't happen so we just use the ones you find at amazon. Plentiful, all seem to work fine so I don't supply exact models. Bob

3030	11	576139	5377345	5377097	R. Proffitt	10/26/12 9:46 AM	1.35124476E12	So far.	We rarely use an outside the cab solution as that would have the installer drill holes and more. The simple bluetooth gps units we used are on amazon.com and sit somewhere inside the cab and get power from almost anywhere. The power draw is very low. Are you writing you use your laptop outside the cab area? Isn't that a bit hard to drive in Winter? Bob

My old delorme works fine with such devices. -&gt; Yes there are some magnet mount and cable solutions but we deal with transit and have to install them a little more permanently but without incurring a lot of install time.
