1.1.1	I 've had my current desktop for about 2 years now .	St
1.1.2	Back in its day it used to be a BEAST but I 'm finding it lagging behind a little .	St
1.1.3	I 'm just going to post a list of my hardware and have you guys point out what you would think would be the highest priority upgrade .	St
1.1.4	Thanks for all the help !	St
1.1.5	( Sidenote : My HDD is running out of space , would you recommend just buying an external or getting a new internal and making it a slave drive ? )	Ques
1.1.6	Mobo : GIGABYTE GA-MA790X-UD4P Processor : AMD Phenom II x4 925 ~2.8GHz ( O/C 'd to 3.0 GHz ) RAM : 4GB GPU : Nvidia GTX 550 ti 1024mb GDDR5 HDD : Hitachi HDP725050GLA360 500GB PSU : ( unnamed ) 750watt Primary use for this is gaming .	St
1.2.1	What OS ?	Ques
1.2.2	You say it 's only 2 years old but is lagging .	St
1.2.3	Personally I would n't have thought it was a hardware problem on a quad-core after only 2 years .	St
1.2.4	Although I see it 's overclocked so no doubt you have improved the fans and venting to allow for increased heat .	St
1.2.5	Other than dust around the fans and vents , I would then look at software itself .	St
1.2.6	Even after 2 years a system gets clogged up with software installs affecting startup and load on the CPU and RAM with running Processes and Services , so may be you can trim those down .	St
1.2.7	As to hard drives , I do n't think it really matters if it is for storage only .	St
1.2.8	An internal will increase the load on the PSU but 750s watt should be fine .	St
1.2.9	However I understand that PSU wattage drops over time , so you could check that .	St
1.2.10	It 's just as easy to copy off personal files onto an external , ( and do n't forget your backup copies on additional external media ) , as it is to an internal .	St
1.2.11	I 'm no technician , but I 'm guessing that cleaning the inside of the case and housekeeping the install itself would help a lot .	St

1.3.1	Only an answer to your side note : NEVER use an external hard disk for storage .	St
1.3.2	It 's slow and error-prone .	St
1.3.3	And most likely you have a SATA drive .	St
1.3.4	Then the best choice for your new drive is another SATA drive , and those are n't master/slave .	St
1.3.5	The main reason for performance slowing down gradually is software running .	St
1.3.6	So the priority upgrade is a simple reinstall of your OS and the applications you need .	St
1.3.7	Upgrading CPU , RAM or video only is indicated if that particular component is the cause of the machine being too slow .	St
1.3.8	That depends on what it 's being used for and what is slow in particular .	St
1.3.9	The best remedy for a long boot time , by the way , is installing the OS on a SSD in stead of a HD .	St
1.3.10	My colleague Bob Proffitt probably would advice you to buy a & quot ; hybrid & quot ; hard disk and use that to install Windows and programs on , while using your current one only for storage .	St
1.3.11	But it hardly helps for faster video rendering .	St
1.3.12	Kees	St
1.4.1	See what you find on http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fastest-graphics-card-radeon-geforce,3067.html Bob	Ques
