<s> How much confidence do you have in your surge protector to protect your electronics? </s>
<s> -- I'm very confident. </s>
<s> (What kind do you have?) </s>
<s> -- Somewhat confident. </s>
<s> (Why the so, so answer?) </s>
<s> -- No confidence whatsoever. </s>
<s> (Why not?) </s>
<s> -- I only use the surge protector to give me more outlets. </s>
<s> -- Not confident at after reading this topic. </s>
<s> (Please explain.) </s>
<s> -- I don't use surge protectors. </s>
<s> (Why not?) </s>
<s> 25 years ago I worked in a small computer store while back in school as a non traditional student. </s>
<s> We sold some what then seemed rather expensive surge protectors. </s>
<s> The proof to me that they were worth the money was when one customers home was hit by lightening. </s>
<s> The only thing damaged in their computer was the modem, the surege managed to come in through the phone line. </s>
<s> They lost all the TVs, their microwave, their fridge and freezer plus a few radios to the hit but like I said the modem was the only part of their computer that received any damage. </s>
<s> One of the radios that died was in the other half the same duplex wall plug the surge protector was plugged into. </s>
<s> Everyone's been saying power surge but surge protectors actually protect against voltage spikes. </s>
<s> A thousand volts without much amperage won't burn up much, but the voltage itself can punch through the insulation of the power supply transformer windings, or get through to the electronics. </s>
<s> I usually use a middle-of-the-road (in terms of cost) surge protector but, as the survey asked, I'm one of those who uses a surge protector for the extra outlets (note that there is a difference between a power strip and a real surge protector). </s>
<s> For protection, all sensitive equipment here has a UPS. </s>
<s> I might take more precautions if I lived in an area that had a lot of lightning strikes, like Florida). </s>
<s> But, like Lee, I live in an area (Southern California) that only has lightning once or twice per year. </s>
<s> So, let's see, I have three UPSes and a bunch of surge protectors for the outlets. </s>
<s> But, you know what? </s>
<s> If there is some kind of storm we shut off power to the computers and/or pull the power cord out and maybe even shut off the UPSes altogether. </s>
<s> The downside: UPS systems cost a lot of money and you frequently (every three years or so) have to replace the batteries. </s>
<s> Also, you will use a lot more electricity with a UPS even when not using your computer. </s>
<s> So, what it boils down to is the universal engineering symbol: &quot;$&quot;. </s>
<s> What is more costly, running UPS systems or replacing your computer? </s>
<s> If you throw in the &quot;odds&quot; of having a direct power lightning hit, the decision can be something you can estimate. </s>
<s> Assuming you have a backup, how much would it cost to replace your whole computer system if it gets hit? </s>
<s> How much would it cost to buy, maintain and &quot;feed&quot; (with electricity) a UPS? </s>
<s> Now, what about surge protectors? </s>
<s> First of all, there is a big difference between a surge protector and a power strip (power strips just add outlets and maybe an &quot;extension cord&quot; but really don't offer any protection). </s>
<s> Next, consider how $Cheap$&quot; the surge protector is. </s>
<s> What is it rated at. </s>
<s> Most really can't handle a direct lightning strike but they can handle it if someone turns off then on your circuit breaker or there is some other abnormality on the power line. </s>
<s> Some companies offer a guarantee on your equipment but make sure you know what is actually covered. </s>
<s> They may exclude lightning or anything over a certain size spike. </s>
<s> Also remember that your telephone line, DSL line, cable line can also be subject to a lightning strike. </s>
<s> Some protectors may have telephone line and network line protection. </s>
<s> My suggestion is to not use any of this equipment during a storm. </s>
<s> Most of us can wait until later. </s>
<s> Also, if you are in a place prone to lightning strikes, move, uhhh, I mean, get a UPS. </s>
<s> Most all the equipment you buy today has been tested for surge protection but is integral to that system. </s>
<s> Surge protectors and a good grounding system that includes ground fault interupters on the distribution (fuse/breaker) panel. </s>
<s> A UPS will provide good protection but the source of ground is the most important as surges will breakdown internally if a proper ground is not found. </s>
<s> Lightning protection will stop surges before they can get to surge protectors but need to be installed on every line that comes into the home. </s>
<s> All these devices are designed to be a one shot deal, once struck or surged, they will destroy themsleves to provide the protection. </s>
<s> My entire network and all of the equipment is behind a master UPS system that I set up. </s>
<s> Somewhat confident? </s>
<s> ...because a direct hit could still damage the system. </s>
<s> I have a friend who works for a business program company and a few years back when the whole country was having lots of grid problems found that the spikes were taking power backup systems but those with just surge protectors were surviving. </s>
<s> Bottom line I believe the power backup protected by the surge protector should make the operator from knowing a surge ever happened. </s>
<s> Well... looks good on paper. </s>
<s> The most significant and beneficial thing that a surge protected can provide is the connected equipment replacement guarantee. </s>
<s> I have had personal experience with this and can attest to modems and hard drives replaced at no cost and with very little hassle. </s>
<s> You can receive damage from lightning in many different ways. </s>
<s> The likelihood of an actual lightning strike is very narrow. </s>
<s> More likely lightning will strike a power pole with a transformer on it. </s>
<s> The powerline itself has some safeguards against lightning strikes. </s>
<s> The mains will probably blow in such a case. </s>
<s> Of course if lightning strikes the house anything could happen. </s>
<s> If you have an actual lightning rod that is grounded that might help divert the lightning. </s>
<s> Ben Franklin invented the lightning rod. </s>
<s> However, besides the power you can get damage through cable lines and phone lines also. </s>
<s> It is the networking equipment that is most likely to be damaged. </s>
<s> I have seen this in my own house. </s>
<s> I hope this helps someone. </s>
<s> Even if you disconnect the power, did you disconnect the networking or is the networking power surge protected? </s>
