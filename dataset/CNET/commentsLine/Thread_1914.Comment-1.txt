ok, i'm going in the opposite direction as most people here.
i have a cable modem which is connected directly to a dlink wireless router.
every pc in my house has wireless cards, so i have had no real use for network cable in a long time... however, what i'd like to do is add a wired hub/switch to my existing wireless network, but i'd like to do it in an area that is nowhere near my wireless access point.
how can i go about doing that?
i do have lan cards in the pcs in the area i want to add this wired switch if there's the possibility of connecting one of the pcs to the switch in order to join it to the network.
otherwise, do i have other options, or is that even an option itself?
so to recap: cable modem - dlink wiress router on main floor of my house.
multiple pcs with wireless cards, all with good connectivity to my network.
i would like to add a 4 port wired switch to my ''office'' area in the basement so i can network other devices without continually buying usb network adapters (for instance, my dvr or a printer) or by figuring out some other workaround.
this switch would then handle traffic from my existing wireless network just as if my network were entirely wired.
thanks for any input.
