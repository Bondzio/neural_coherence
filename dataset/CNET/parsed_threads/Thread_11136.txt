<s> Hi, I was hoping if someone could tell me how to booktype my Sony DRX840U 20x External Dual-Layer DVD Burner. </s>
<s> Thanks Alot </s>
<s> What software are you using to write your DVD's? </s>
<s> ImgBurn will booktype if your drive supports it. </s>
<s> If you do not know if your drive supports it, try DVDInfo or Nero's Drivespeed to check. </s>
<s> Your software does that and your drive supports it. </s>
<s> BUT!!! </s>
<s> This has NEVER been the reason why your DVDs created in said drives don't play on DVD players. </s>
<s> Don't waste people's time chasing down that dead end. </s>

<s> Hi, The programs I use are clone dvd and 1 Click Dvd Copy Pro. </s>
<s> I like them because they rip and burn. </s>
<s> Does IMG Burn do the same?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Hi Absoluttely, I have a very old NEC dvd burner single layer. </s>
<s> I downloaded firmware and flashed the drive. </s>
<s> Now it Burns +R to DVD-ROM. </s>
<s> Also it know supports double layer recording. </s>
<s> How do you explain that ?? </s>
<s> The reason for my post is because I did it such a long time ago that I have forgotten how to do it and do not want to brick my drive. </s>
<s> I just want to play videos for family who still own old dvd players that do not support +R or -R. </s>
<s> I decline to duplicate web content about firmware updates that add capability. </s>
<s> If you want to discuss it, supply links to the firmware and the drive so I don't have to dig it up. </s>
<s> The booktype and it's relationship to DVD(+/-R) media not playing is well discussed. </s>
<s> It's not the solution and as such I will not discuss it. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> It's a deadend. </s>
