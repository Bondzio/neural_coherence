cpu: architecture and name have nothing in common.
amd64 is the same- x86_64- no matter who makes it.
ram: this depends on the board manufacturer and bios.
again, name doesn't matter.
graphics card support is also dependent upon the library being used.
i am a user of computers and of multiple operating systems.
glorified specs and the hype behind them are useless to me.
really, you should learn about computers.
it would be very easy for someone to screw you in a way you won't enjoy.
fast?
wow!
you need experience with other operating systems and variating configurations for each before you make this statement.
