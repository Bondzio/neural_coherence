<s> So this started happening recently my computer keeps shutting down on its own. </s>
<s> I have to turn the power button on the back off and wait a few minutes before turning it back on. </s>
<s> I assumed at first it was the power supply. </s>
<s> However i remembered to turn my temp and fan speed monitor back on to find that it is overheating which could be turning my computer off as well. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Assuming you have checked your power settings in control panel, sounds like a hardware issue. </s>
<s> First guess would be power supply is on the way out, could be other things that were mentioned in prior post, heat can also create the issue. </s>
<s> The processor fan is a fairly common culprit for that scenario if it is on the way out, slowing down or stopping can send system in to shutdown. </s>
<s> Boot to safe mode and check out device manager. </s>
<s> Probably a blown driver. </s>
<s> Usually fried CPU won't allow your system to boot. </s>
<s> I think your system has overheat issue. </s>
<s> You need to check your CPU temperature. </s>
<s> One useful software is called RMCLOCK, it is free for download. </s>
<s> It will tell you your CPU work load, and temperature. </s>
<s> If CPU is overheat, you might need a better CPU fan. </s>
