you say your main uses on this machine are web browsing and digital photography.
with that in mind you must seriously consider how much time you spend on the machine performing these tasks when you consider an upgrade.
as we near 2006 you also may want to consider the looming release of windows vista, with extremely high hardware requirements your current rig will not touch upon being able to run it well.
with that bit of information touched upon you might now look at how much you want to spend on such an old machine.
with newer machines using sata drives any drive you buy to upgrade this old machine will be totally obsolete as soon as you open the box.
i could go into depth on these topics and i just may on another day but for now i leave you with this suggestion.
if you aren't very tech literate and rely on hiring others for help then you should choose a new system because not only does it provide you with more hard drive space but you also get a warranty to help support you if a problem arrives.
