1.5.1	If I understand you correctly , you want to a ) hook an external drive to each of your windows machines , and copy files to the external drive b ) move those files from the external drive to your new iMac c ) use the drive as the backup drive for Time Machine The mac can read FAT32 formatted drives , but not NTFS formatted drives .	St
1.5.2	In order to read an NTFS drive , I 'm pretty sure you 'll need to install MacFUSE on the iMac as Robert suggested : & lt ; http : //code.google.com/p/macfuse/ & gt ; But before you do that , have you tried networking the iMac with the windows machines ?	Ques
1.5.3	Your iMac can participate in windows-based networks very easily , and there 's no extra hardware or software to install .	St
1.5.4	Just network them together ( using an existing network , or just by running an ethernet cable between your iMac and the target PC ) , then copy the files you need over your network .	St
1.5.5	Then , for Time Machine , you will have to first re-format the drive as HFS+ ( the default for the Mac OS ) .	St
1.5.6	Formatting it for HFS+ will obliterate any windows files or file systems you may have on the drive .	St
1.5.7	HTH -- Scott	St
