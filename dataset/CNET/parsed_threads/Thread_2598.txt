<s> Was using a Linksys router running on a G network for almost 8 months now. </s>
<s> My PC and laptop use this router. </s>
<s> I've had a load of problems with the router and have decided to move on to an N network router from D Link. </s>
<s> My question is, do I need to do anything in terms of &quot;ridding&quot; the PC and laptop of the previous network they were running on before I create a new connection to the new router? </s>
<s> I don't want any signs of the Linksys router around when I attempt to hook up the D Link one. </s>
<s> &quot;discovery&quot; software to help you connect to the other router. </s>
<s> Otherwise, just yank the old and install the new. </s>
<s> You'll need get into its web interface to do a little configuring so knowing it's IP address would help. </s>
<s> The defaults will be somewhere in the instructions. </s>
<s> You should change the username/password for the router while you're in there, decide whether you want to do static addressing or use DHCP or maybe a mix of both. </s>
<s> But this doesn't find it's way to your PC unless you plug the gateway address into your network settings manually. </s>
