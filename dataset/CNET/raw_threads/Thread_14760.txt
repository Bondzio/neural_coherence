I've always had HP printers until last week, and those HP printers had a setting to block junk faxes ... if there was a number shown on the incoming fax. I cannot find any info re doing this with the Canon ... either in the User's Guide or in their online Help. Does anyone with a Canon know if this is possible? Thanks.

You'll have to consider add on devices you find with http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Blocking+junk+faxes Bob

Mine is free but requires me to block all phone and fax of members of the Do Not Contact list and of course does not cover companies that are not members.
