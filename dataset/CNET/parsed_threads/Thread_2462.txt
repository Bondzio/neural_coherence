<s> I am a hospice chaplain and I am looking for a program and hardware to use to track my mileage and visitations. </s>
<s> It needs to tell me where I've been, for how long and how many miles it took to get me there. </s>
<s> I also want to be able to get directions to the addresses that I have to visit. </s>
<s> i also want to be able to submit reports (mileage and visitation notes) to the home office via a laptop in my car (or from my house office). </s>
<s> I also plan to use my computer to edit video and audio for worship services. </s>
<s> I am curently usinf Primere Pro and Sonar but could be convinced to make changes. </s>
<s> Can you help me decide what software and hardware to purchase? </s>

<s> I waited for a while to see if anyone else would respond to your question, but I guess you will have to put up with me. </s>
<s> So, a MacPro laptop would suit your needs but if you need to do all that stuff in the vehicle you will need some sort of Broadband wireless coverage. </s>
<s> Something like the service that Cingular or Verizon offers. </s>
<s> Tracking visits, mileage and times could easily be recorded on a spreadsheet. </s>
<s> Appleworks includes one but this is no longer bundled with a new Mac. </s>
<s> It is available as a separate purchase though. </s>
<s> $75 (ish)Excel is also a possibility, part of Office 2004 for Mac. </s>
<s> (Expensive) Driving directions can be had at places like MapQuest, on the internet, via your Wireless Broadband access and the Safari web browser. </s>
<s> For Video and Audio, the Mac comes with iLife. </s>
<s> A suite of integrated programs, iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie(HD) and iDVD that should suit your purpose. </s>
<s> Hope this helps P </s>
<s> I would think that some sort of GPS hardware/software combo would cover most of it. </s>
<s> I have a hand-held Garmin e-trex that does amazing things, and I've seen Mac software for linking it to a computer in the ways you describe, but I've never tried it. </s>
<s> On it's own, it will track 12 Sats, is accurate to 7' on a good day, and 20' on a bad one. </s>
<s> It has roadmaps of the USA, detailed enough that the cul de sac I live on is in it. </s>
<s> It will store 250 waypoints (remember this spot) Thousands of miles of tracks (how I got there) Of course, it has a track back function. </s>
<s> As a trip computer it will give constantly updated numbers for Speed Trip time Moving time Stopped time Ave. Moving Speed Overall average Speed Top Speed ETA ATA Distance made good Distance to destination Closing speed Trip odometer Altitude Vertical speed Time (accurate to 1/60th of a second, self setting) Sunrise Sunset Gas stations etc etc etc. </s>
<s> It runs on 2 AA batteries, or a cigarette plug. </s>
<s> It's the size of an average cell phone. </s>
<s> Mine does not do addresses. </s>
<s> Others do. </s>
<s> Mine is 3 years old. </s>
<s> the new ones have more features & better price, as you would expect. </s>
<s> If it did addresses and the paperwork, it would be perfect for you, all by itself. </s>
<s> I guess what I'm trying to say is that you need a GPS that plugs into your laptop with some logging software. </s>
<s> There are lot's of options & price points setting it up, but that's where my knowledge runs out. </s>
<s> I can tell you that Garmin makes good stuff (I've had three), and you can buy them at Fry's, Circuit City, Best Buy, etc. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Lampie the Clown </s>
