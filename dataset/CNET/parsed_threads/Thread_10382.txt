<s> I have about 5 computers throughout the house and is all hooked up to my router through cat5 cables or wireless. </s>
<s> How do i setup so I can share a folder through my LAN? </s>
<s> Turn off any firewalls on all PCs for the local network. </s>
<s> Make sure printer and file sharing for MS networks is enabled in your network device settings. </s>
<s> Decide on what you want to share or create a share on each PC. </s>
<s> Generally this will be a folder or other folders with or without subfolders. </s>
<s> Turn sharing on for these. </s>
<s> Make sure each user that will have access to the shares has an account defined on each PC. </s>
<s> Give that account the same username/password on each. </s>
<s> These steps will get you started but I can't guarantee more tweaking won't be needed. </s>
<s> You didn't provide the OS and version. </s>
<s> XP Pro and Home will have some differences that could cause connection issues but these can be worked out. </s>
<s> Start here and post back with progress if you need more help. </s>
<s> Okay. </s>
<s> im using windows Xp home. </s>
<s> I got all the shared stuff done so im okay. </s>
<s> Im wondering if under the my network. </s>
<s> Is the shared folder suppose to be under internet or local network? </s>
<s> Mine is under internet. </s>
<s> And whats the dealie with teh username and password? </s>
<s> It should show under My Network Places/Entire Network/Microsoft Windows Network. </s>
<s> I believe the default name is &quot;Home&quot; but you can change that. </s>
<s> I did forget to mention that each PC needs to have a unique name to identify it on the network. </s>
<s> When XP is installed, if you don't give it a name, it generates a nonsense one. </s>
<s> Anyway, give each PC a name you will recognize. </s>
<s> Then, when you click on the local network name, all the PCs should appear. </s>
<s> I'll also recommend that drag the local network icon to your desktop to save a couple of steps each time you access it. </s>
<s> As for username/password, authentication works better if all PCs have a common user. </s>
<s> This doesn't mean other users need to be defined on all but XP. </s>
<s> Often &quot;access denied&quot; messages are traceable to authentication issues. </s>
<s> Much is determined by how permissions are set up. </s>
<s> I must admit to being more familiar with Pro than Home. </s>
<s> Home might be less restrictive in its default settings. </s>
<s> I'd suggest you first work on getting the entire network to present itself on all PCs and have the shares visible. </s>
<s> Other details can be worked out after you get to that point. </s>
<s> Okay now I have a laptop but take it to my dorm and at home. </s>
<s> When im at home I want the sharing but when Im at the dorms I dont want to share. </s>
<s> Im using vista premium. </s>
<s> Am I able to make it share only when it connects to a certain network...For example my network is called guard(its private). </s>
<s> Am I able to have it only enable when it connect to guard? </s>
<s> so Vista will add a new twist. </s>
<s> Sorry but don't know Vista myself but this shouldn't be too difficult. </s>
<s> The first thing I would do is run this by your college help desk folks. </s>
<s> It should be their job to control network traffic on that system. </s>
<s> Secondly, you need to set up permissions anyway. </s>
<s> Just don't set them up to allow everyone full access. </s>
<s> Use defined users that require a password for access. </s>
<s> It's also possible to set up different user profiles for the home and away. </s>
<s> While you cannot eliminate hacking attempts, you can make it not worth the effort. </s>
