<s> OK, I feel really stupid but how do I open the case to my new Dell Dimension 1100? </s>
<s> I want to instal a wireless PCI adaptor. </s>
<s> It appears that the case is riveted shut. </s>
<s> There must be a simple way to open it that is eluding me but idont see the usual screws or anything.... </s>
<s> go to the Dell WEB Site and download it. </s>
<s> I'm not overly familiar with Dells, but the ones that I've had some hands-on time with opened like clam shells - there should be large, recessed, oval-shaped buttons on the top and bottom of the case. </s>
<s> With the case laying on it's side and facing away from you, push in those buttons and open - it opens towards you (the back), the hinges are in the front. </s>
<s> If your case design is different from what I've described, I'm just as lost... Good luck! </s>
<s> I have seen 7 different kinds of Dells each with a different stupid way of opening it. </s>
<s> I would say Gateways have the nicest cases to open, that I have seen. </s>
<s> Here is a linky to the directions for opening the little guy. </s>
<s> good luck. </s>

<s> ...I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to open the case of the family Dimension 4400. </s>
<s> I've worked on many Dells, and really enjoy how easily they open. </s>
<s> I wish all cases were screwless. </s>
<s> I've even added RAM from underneath the desk, while the operator takes a two minute break. </s>
<s> The only tool needed is a flashlight. </s>
<s> No unplugging, no screws to lose, just push the button and pop the side cover off. </s>
<s> I don't even lay them on their sides. </s>
