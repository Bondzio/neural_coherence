Have now install matching sticks of 1gb pc 6400 ddr2 800 now showing a total of 1024 mb per slot.
There is a performance increase over the 2-512 mb sticks.
Found 1-512 mb ddr2 5300u and 1-512 mb ddr2 4400u installed in 1,3 slots.
Completely removed and installed 6400 in the 1,3 slots.
Not sure if this was done by Dell or the tech who reinstalled windows Xp Regardless I was wanting to upgrade ram and the 6400 has given me what i wanted Thanks for the help
