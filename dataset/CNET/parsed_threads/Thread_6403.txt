<s> &lt;div&gt;Product in question: Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0/2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive&lt;/div&gt; I have a WD external hard drive that recently started making these clicky noises that, after extensive research, I've discovered means that my hard drive is on the way out. </s>
<s> I can't access ANY of my files (and there's about 300-600 GB in this thing) and the cheapest place I found to recover would cost me about 1000 smackaroos. </s>
<s> I'm a college student and CANNOT afford that. </s>
<s> I also don't have any amazingly geeky friends to save me. </s>
<s> So. </s>
<s> I've found a &quot;risky&quot; solution that a guy told me about at one of those places that charge for file recovery. </s>
<s> He suggested that I format my hard drive (a quick format, not a deep one) and use a program to rescue these files, putting them safely in other locations until I can get the replacement in the mail. </s>
<s> My question is what are the best programs? </s>
<s> I would really prefer free ones although if those ones aren't up to snuff I am desperate enough that I would probably pay a little bit of money (twenty dollars, maybe). </s>
<s> If anyone could recommend a good program I'd greatly appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for the help. </s>
<s> However I have found the drive to recover when I put it into a desktop PC or a new enclosure with it's new power supply. </s>
<s> Thanks for telling the story. </s>
<s> Folk often won't backup because it's too expensive. </s>
<s> At 1,000 bucks, backup seems cheap. </s>

<s> Clicking noises could be a power issue. </s>
<s> Try an Y-cable (to connect it with 2 slots), or a powered hub, or run your laptop from an adapter. </s>
<s> Or, as Bob suggested, another enclosure or directly in the case. </s>
<s> Luckily, as long as it makes these sounds, most likely you can't even format it. </s>
<s> So you won't lose your files. </s>
<s> But better make a copy to another disk as soon as possible. </s>
