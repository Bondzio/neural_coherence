I've heard 45 deg C when not being used and 65 deg C when heavily active. I've been annoyed with my fan running at 80% all the time to ensure that my CPU stays cool. So I just lowered it to around 65% and now my temperature hovers around 65% when I'm gaming. I want to make sure I'm not going to blow the darn thing up. Thanks ahead of time.

My P4 has gone up to over 100 degrees celcius, w/ no fan because for some reason, the automatic shutdown failed on me , and nothing happened to the processor...I'm using that computer right now to type out this response. Highly not recommended to try at home.

Core 2 Duo 2 Ghz. Nmedia 200A case. Install went pretty well, I even got the Viiv software installed and working correctly. My issue is the CPU temp. The nmedia case has two temperature sensors that display CPU and Case temp on the VFD.The CPU temp starts around 75 F and within 30 minutes heads up to about 93F. It will then stay at 93 F for as long as I have it on. ___________________________________________________ Find a florist in Phoenix cheapest loans casas vilafranca ringtone downloads

I have an Athlon 64 3200+ Venice on socket 754 (its ancient but it works for me along with Vista) connected to a Thermaltake Golden Orb II with no fan control but running at 2200RPM tops and Arctic Silver 5 grease. It is very good if it runs 20^C but anything under probably may be sensors incorrection up to what you said. Anything higher, you should probably turn off the machine and check if the heatsink is properly attached or if the Thermal grease needs to be wiped and freshly applied. If there is no grease but a tape, buy a small pack of Arctic Silver 5 which is usually around 5 bucks and apply a bead size or a specific amount that Intel/AMD recommends. Whoever told you 45^C needs to do some more research...

I'm just guessing these conversions but I assure you if those are fahrenheit and not celcius then it is fine
