You really need to open case and check those fans.
Any fan when it fails cause less &quot;ait circualation&quot; and thus more heat build-up.
If allowed to continue whatever it was trying to cool will become stressed and at least become flaky or start to fail itself.
Thus, a case fan cause &quot;a;;&quot; componets to be stressed and a cpu fan a more direct reslut for cpu shutdown or similar as the system bios will kick-in its safety temp feature(hi-temp) and sgutdown or reboot.
Seriously, check the fans.
An &quot;iffy&quot; fan is stop&go or not fully free to move isn't worth saving, just replace, ASAP.
Rememeber, that a case fan if not working 100% may cause the HD to be over heated and sooner or later will fail or become corrupted.
