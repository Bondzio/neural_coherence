Most games barely use 2 cores if they do. The Future of games well take advantage of more cores (more the better). From what it sounds like Crysis (a new big game coming out) well use all the Cores a computer has, but that has yet to be tested. Games well depend more on your video card. (And in the coming years you well have Dual Core Processors on gaming cards) With the Drop in price of the Q6600 I can't see how it would not be worth it? The second computer is all better. I would choose the second one!

If I were to build such I'd be looking at the Quad Core, 2GB RAM, SATA RAID and what card I can afford from http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/07/03/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ For the power supply the C2D wouldn't need much over the 400Watt mark (depends on the video card) and the Core Quad would have me look for the 500 and up units.
