i have a new pc, with adequate dram and a great chip to run vista ultimate, and a laptop, running vista home premium.
since i have used wired networks before with dsl service, i am guessing using a cable modem won't cause any problems.
first, since i have to push the 60 feet of cat5e wire through existing 2x6 walls, and con't know exactly where the 110v wires are located, is it essential to use a wire locator to keep the cat5e wire far enough away from the electrical circuit so as not to compromise the signal so it drops?
second, i have purchased a linksys befsr41 cable/dsl router with a 4-port switch for my network, because i used the same router 8 years ago for my dsl modem and had no problems with speed or setup.
is there a better wired router i should consider befoe i unwrap my befsr41?
third, once i have the laptop connected to the router, should i buy a printer hub to connect my hp laserjet 1300 and my officejet 6210 to the router, or should i connect both printers to my pc and use printer and file sharing to enable my laptop to connect to both printers?
fourth, i have a termaltake housing for a 500mb western digital external hardrive that has both a esata and a usb2.0 port.
i also have a linksys network storage link with two usb2.0 ports and an rj45 ethernet port.
should i connect the external hard drive directly to the pc, using the esata port, and then access the external hard drive using printer/files sharing with my laptop?
or, should i connect my linksys network storage link to one of the ports of the befsr41, and keep my external hard drive connected to the network storage link so i can backup my files and folders on the external hard drive?
thanks for reading this long message, and for any advice you can send my way.
