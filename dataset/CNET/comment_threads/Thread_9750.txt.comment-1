I just loaded on Vista RC2, and was all excited to try out the new Vista Media Center with it, since I have never used Media Center before.
Vista automatically installed some drivers that were dated and signed as of 6/21 which is newer than the drivers on this page http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/support/vista.html When it loads up, the screen is all snowy, I can hear some audio from the station, and only barely make out anything.
I tried to fore it and load the older drivers from the Hauppauge page on, but then it said after when I got into Media Center that my TV tuner wasn't supported.
I was pretty sure there was support for my Hauppauge 500 in Vista 64 anyone have any idea to help me get it working?
Thanks, ~J
