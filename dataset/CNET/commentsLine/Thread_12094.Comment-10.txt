usb drivers would be proper (or should be) so let's leave those as-is, whereis.
as to drive management, it's the tool that comes with xp to look at and manage drives.
it's one of my first stops when i go looking for a missing drive.
i don't write about it in any detail since if not in start, help and support we have google to read up about this tool.
