1.1.1	Computer Info : p4 3.2ghz 800mhz fsb 512kb l2 cache .	St
1.1.2	winxp pro sp2 2 74gb raptors on raid 0 Asus p4c800 e-delux mobo 2x512mb Corsair Dual Channel Ram Problem : A while back , i had a power surge which cause my motherboard and cpu to stop working and i had to rma it .	St
1.1.3	i was also unable to boot up my comp because the bios was NOT detecting the old harddrives that i had before ( 2x120gb western digital 7200rpm , no raid ) .	St
1.1.4	i finally figured out my harddrives were finally dead after 3 years ( that gave me an excuse to buy a pair of raptors ) .	St
1.1.5	now everything is working properly .	St
1.1.6	i just remembered that i had about 400 pictures from a vacation to china i went on last year ( on the 2 dead harddrives ) and ... .I FORGOT TO BACK THEM UP .	St
1.1.7	usually when a harddrive & quot ; clicks & quot ; at you ... .its a lot harder to recover the data .	St
1.1.8	but these 2 dead drives do not make a noise which leads me to think it should be a fixable problem .	St
1.1.9	it just seems like there is no power going to them .	St
1.1.10	and since there is no noise , i 'm hoping the data on it should still be in tact .	St
1.1.11	how would i go about recovering the data i had on the harddrives ?	Ques
1.2.1	I try the following software but wo n't dive into details of jumpers or proper IDE cables , power connections ( some need a manual for that ) then it 's likely to be beyond a home based retrieval so the next stop is DriveSavers.com http : //www.pcinspector.de/file_recovery/UK/welcome.htm Bob	St
