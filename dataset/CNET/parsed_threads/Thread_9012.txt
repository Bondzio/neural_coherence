<s> I have host pc xp and laptop IBM T22 xp. </s>
<s> I successfully made a wirless network that was up and running fine until two days ago. </s>
<s> I havent had it long. </s>
<s> I then decided to fix up some security in the router - a dlink G604T. </s>
<s> Fine! </s>
<s> Went to log on my laptop and found crosses on my voyager usb adapter...no network connection present and media is disconnected in ipconfig. </s>
<s> I seem to have tried everyhting. </s>
<s> Even starting from scratch by setting router back to default and starting all over again. </s>
<s> All to no avail. </s>
<s> My laptop will simply not recognise that the adapter is plugged in and the lights are on! </s>
<s> All lights on router fine and pc running well but I've definately drawn a blank on the laptop. </s>
<s> tried system restore to see if I corrupted something during config of laptop after security set up. </s>
<s> Uninstalled reinstalled adapter. </s>
<s> This is AOL too but it was working firne for a few days. </s>
<s> Can anyone shed any light on this please in good old simple jargon as I am a bit of a novice! </s>
<s> thanks threepence </s>
<s> I have the same problem. </s>
<s> I'm using a D-Link router with an Orinoco network card. </s>
<s> I've tried disabling WEP security, as well as MAC filtering. </s>
<s> I've also tried ipconfig /release and /renew. </s>
<s> Windows wireless client detects my network, with an excellent signal strength, but fails to connect to the network. </s>
<s> I'm getting the same &quot;Media disconnected&quot; message. </s>
<s> Help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I had two adapters (external and internal), which may have conflicted with each other; disabling one didn't work. </s>
<s> I opted to using the internal adapter only; threw the external card into my laptop bag. </s>
<s> I had to uninstall, then reinstall client and drivers. </s>
<s> The installation process is automatic if you're using XP. </s>
<s> After reboot, everything was fine. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
