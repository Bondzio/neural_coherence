Thanks, im having problems flashing my BIOS, its yet another story, ROMID errors and all that, list goes on.
Anyway, is there a way I can test to see if it is insufficient power before I go buying another PSU?
..can I just disconnect some IDE devises for example and try and boot?
And I also though it might be something about installing RAM in pairs, but there are only 3 black RAM slots, and it says nothing in the manual about pairing memory.
Thanks for replying
