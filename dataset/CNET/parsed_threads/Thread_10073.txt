<s> I have a tiny PIII 55o MHz,256 SDRam (100 MHz)running win98SE.I need to replace the motherboard and would like to upgrade to a socket 478 with a 2.4 P4 CPU.I have already replaced the CD,CD/RW on this system and would like to use as much of it as possible.I have been looking at several motherboards. </s>
<s> Some support my SDRAM and some support DDR.My question is , in order to use my existing ram, do I have to buy a motherboard that supports only SDRAM/100MHz or can I get one that supports SDRAM and DDR both including SDRAM/133? </s>
<s> I am not sure exactly what specs I should look for in order to use as much of my old system as possible. </s>
<s> I have a P4 1.9 GHz Socket 423 with i845 chipset which I put together because I wanted to recycle some 512 SDRAM I had. </s>
<s> What a mistake. </s>
<s> It runs at about the speed of a 900MHz P3. </s>
<s> You may as well just find some 1GHz P3 and get that speed? </s>
<s> OTHER ISSUES! </s>
<s> Your Power Supply Unit (PSU) to run this new dragon should be abotu 400 or more Watts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Increasing your processing speed while using PC100, is like buying a Ferrari and using regular unleaded. </s>
<s> Your performance will suffer. </s>
<s> If you are going the upgrade route, consider adding new DDR compatible with your new board. </s>
<s> Between a new P4 2.4(533mhz? </s>
<s> ), new board and new DDR(at least 256mb) you will greatly increase performance. </s>
<s> If you can splurg for a SATA hard drive that wouldn't hurt either. </s>
<s> Optical drives, floppy, sound and video can be recycled (for gaming you might want to upgrade the vid) but that's another story. </s>
