this issue is well discussed.
for gamers the hardware has yet to be created to say, run crysis at it's top settings.
so to get that you'll have to wait.
why not pick a &quot;nice&quot; machine that is 1/2 the price, use it and come back again in a few years?
and about the 4gb.
did you research this?
many are not happy about windows and what it does to limit applications to 2gb... bob
