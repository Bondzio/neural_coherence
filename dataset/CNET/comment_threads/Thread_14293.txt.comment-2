No.
But let's define &quot;logging on.&quot; If you mean &quot;must the Windows GUI be logged in?&quot; That is, the name and password on the HOST be entered where you see the start button then the answer changes to &quot;yes.&quot; But under the hood there is a login occurring when a CLIENT connects and asks for connection to a share.
How deep must we go here?
