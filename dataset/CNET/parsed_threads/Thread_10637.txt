<s> I am looking for a work horse printer that can handle a large monthly volume that prints full sheets of labels. </s>
<s> When doing a search online for best label printers all the come up are specialty printers that only print single labels. </s>
<s> I need a standard laser printer that will print 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheet labels. </s>
<s> Most office printers and all in ones claim that labels sheets do not work well, so I guess I need a specialized printer but can not find any. </s>
<s> Any suggestions and recommendations would be greatly appreciated, THANK YOU! </s>
<s> Example at http://www.primeralabel.com/lx810_features.html </s>
<s> No, not exactly. </s>
<s> We need a heavy duty type industrial printer, but to be able to print out on full 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets that contain 6 labels per sheet. </s>
<s> Basically just a good laser printer that can handle labels so we don't have to worry about labels peeling off inside the machine. </s>
<s> B&W is fine as well, we don't need to print color. </s>
<s> For very little you can get the usual HP and use Avery laser labels. </s>
<s> I guess many will not do that because they &quot;fret&quot; too much. </s>
<s> Here we'll go cheap because we know we'll replace the cheap HP yearly. </s>
<s> The ones that fret or don't plan on wearout may have to go with industrial models. </s>

<s> Thanks, any model suggestions? </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/laser-printers/hp-laserjet-pro-p1102w/4505-3159_7-33986223.html Feed it Laser Labels like http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Products/Labels/Shipping-Labels/White-Shipping-Labels_05168.htm and you are on your way without a big outlay. </s>
<s> But what I find are folk that can't accept &quot;wearing out&quot; these printers. </s>
<s> It's a simple choice. </s>
<s> Higher costs for industrial printers or simpler printers but count on failure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think there are quite a few models which can solve your problem, there is hp also zebra are good label printers. </s>
<s> http://labelnet.co.uk/label-manufacturers/sheet-labels/ </s>
<s> You need to get into the commercial or industrial models as explained already. </s>
<s> One poster mentioned the Zebra printer and that's a good maker to look into. </s>
<s> The only caveat is that the media is on rolls, but it will print all day. </s>
<s> If you stick with the label sheets, then look at Konica brand as they too will do a good job. </s>
<s> As already explained, HP models will do fine depending on the severity of use. </s>
<s> It wouldn't hurt to have more than one as well as the cost isn't going to break ya and the &quot;uptime&quot; that maybe required. </s>
<s> Further, HP is common and if it breaks the &quot;repair kits&quot; are common as well, if you go that route. </s>
<s> You should contact a local copier service source that supplies both copiers and printers and allow them to demo or explain in details of what's available. </s>
<s> I should mention that Okidata printers have typically been workhorse ptinters, IMO, but alot depends on the nature or amt. </s>
<s> of printing plus the environment as well for any printer. </s>
<s> I mention that as printers used in concrete production may fail often or similar service. </s>
