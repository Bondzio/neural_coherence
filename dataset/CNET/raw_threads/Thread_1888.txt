So i have a wireless network connection and a LAN connection and they are both displayed under the network bridge section in the Network Connections window, however, there is no bridge icon so i cant disable the &quot;bridge&quot; or configure my network adapters by themselves. Is there another way to disable the bridge that doesn't seem to exist? Ive tried a method that dealt with the registry and it removed the bridge but screwed up the adapters so i had to run a system restore and so im back to where i started. what it looks like... http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/5017/89979969fl3.jpg thanks

I am trying to disable the bridge but as shown in the pictures there is no bridge icon. That prevents me from disabling the &quot;bridge&quot; or seperately modifying the adapters to turn off the ICS option. I would like to stop this bridge so i can configure my netowrk adapters.
