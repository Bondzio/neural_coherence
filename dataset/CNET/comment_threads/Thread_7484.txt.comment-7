N to G vice versa won't cut it.
Dual band N (if wireless) gigabit hardware (if hardwired) cat 6 cable in lieu of cat 5 and a fast server hook up, fiber if possible.
Could get a little pricey since hardwired systems will need gigabit NIC capability and wireless require N. Sounds like a fun project, good luck!
