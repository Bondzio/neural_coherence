i have a laptop with a mobile intel(r) 915gm/gms embedded graphics card, and i just installed more ram to the system, so i'd like to allocate more memory to the graphics card.
i read the specs from intel so i know its possible, but they failed to explain how one goes about doing it.
anyone have some ideas?
(i checked the bios too... no luck there)
