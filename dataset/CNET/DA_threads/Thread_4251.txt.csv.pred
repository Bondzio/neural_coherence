1.1.1	I just bought a D Link DI-634M router to set up a wireless network in my apartment .	St
1.1.2	The apartment that I live in provides internet access from a local ISP through ethernet connections in each apartment .	St
1.1.3	Currently i sign in through a PPPOE connection to my ISP .	St
1.1.4	The router that I bought seems to be configured to be set up using a dsl or cable modem .	St
1.1.5	I was wondering if there is a way to set it up directly to the ethernet port .	St
1.1.6	So far I have n't been able to get my computer to recognize the router , and the tech support from D-Link seems stumped that I connect without using a modem .	St
1.1.7	After hours on the phone with them they think that the router that I bought is malfunctioning .	St
1.1.8	I 'm not sure if it 's this , or if it 's just not possible to connect it directly to the ethernet port .	St
1.1.9	I called my ISP , and they told me that it was possible , but that they did n't provide tech support for such issues .	St
1.1.10	Can anyone help me ?	Ques
1.1.11	Sorry , I 'm new at all of this .	St
1.1.12	Thanks , Josh	St
1.2.1	computer , using a network cable ( RJ45 ) ... configured the router ... try to disable the dhcp on the router or try to configured and change the IP range and gateway etc .	St
1.2.2	and dhcp enabled ... the manual will have many informatino for this .	St
1.2.3	then disconnet the computer and plug the cable to the apartment connection .	St
1.2.4	Try to connect the network cable to the LAN port ( usually that ethernet wall plug in your apartment , is already running from a router )	St
