St

1.4.1	Good list of parts!	St

1.4.4	John http://www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html http://newegg.com/ http://outpost.com/ http://www.tigerdirect.com/?sourceid=qIZcQRkDgwMEAkgbvUrJ&siteid=0038280125&CMP=AFC-AFFIL	St
1.5.1	thx alot for all the help, greatly appreciate it, i've got everything decided but the RAM and HDD, what u guys think i should be looking at?	St
1.6.1	I'm assuming that you got the AMD64 processor.	St
1.6.2	The Ram and HB in the previous post is a good choice, if you want a bigger HD you could get a 160bg.	St
1.6.3	In order to keep up with the CPU DRR 3200 is the minium speed.	St
1.6.4	John	St
1.7.1	You will want to get a hard drive with the longest warranty possible.	St
1.7.2	I try to aim for 3 years.	St
1.7.3	Though last time I checked most have dropped their warranty support to one year.	St
1.7.4	And to get a &quot;serial&quot; hdd and cable.	St
1.7.5	Though that won't be hard since &quot;serial&quot; has taken over the market.	St
1.7.6	You could try to get a hdd with 10,000 rpm, though I'm not sure if such extra speed is necessary.	Sug
1.7.7	The 8mb buffer is nice.	St
1.7.8	Two other considerations.	St
1.7.9	SCSI/raid.	St
1.7.10	Both promise faster performance and both add considerable cost to your PC(especially scsi)	St
1.8.1	if u still wanna get really good stuff, go with the: RAM- Kingston HyperX PC3200 400MHz (4x512MB) Harddrive- Seagate 160GB 7,200RPM 8MB cache the HyperX is the best RAM that the best RAM company offers.	St
1.8.2	I have also heard lots of really good things about seagate harddrives.	St
