1.1.1	Hi, my wife and I would like to set up a wireless network in our house, I'm not sure if what we want to do is possible or not?	St
1.1.2	I appreciate any help.	Polite
1.1.3	We have two laptops with built in wireless one running xp and the other vista, one desktop running xp with no wireless and it uses a sprint air card for internet connection, and I have one wired printer going to the desktop and we just bought one wireless printer.	St
1.1.4	My question is what do I need to connect the two laptops to both the wireless printer and the other printer connected to the desktop, and is it possible to keep the air card plugged into the desktop and have the two laptops somehow pick up this connection in the house?	Ques
1.1.5	I know on the printer for the desktop it's an HP office jet and has the cat 5 connection in back available, I just have no clue on what to buy or if this would even be possible?	St
1.1.6	Thank you very much.	St
1.2.1	A router that accepts that air card might be found at http://www.3gstore.com	St
