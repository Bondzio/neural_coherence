1.1.1	I am hoping someone can help me out with this : I had a bunch of old stuff ( and some spyware I think ) on my computer , so I decided to a complete format and reinstall XP .	St
1.1.2	I went through the installation and then updated my device drivers from the CD 's .	St
1.1.3	Everything seemed fine ... Then I plugged in the ethernet cable .	St
1.1.4	It was fine until it started downloading the windows updates .	St
1.1.5	It had n't actually got to the real updates , just the initial update software it has to install .	St
1.1.6	I think it was on # 2 of 3 when it froze .	St
1.1.7	The mouse would still move , but I could n't click anything or bring up the task manager with ctrl+alt+delete .	St
1.1.8	I was thinking it could be the hard drive , but then I imagine it would n't boot at all .	St
1.1.9	Before the spyware got on the computer , everything was running fine , so I would n't think that any of the components just & quot ; went bad. & quot ; Any suggestions are much appreciated !	St
1.1.10	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	System specs : AMD64 cpu nvidia geforce 6600 video card 1gb ram	St
1.3.1	I think heat .	St
1.3.2	So I pull a side cover and blow out the dust , Make sure the fans are all turning , especially the heat Sink .	St
1.3.3	Then try it again .	Sug
1.4.1	I pulled the side cover off and left it off .	St
1.4.2	The fans/heatsinks are all fine .	St
1.4.3	I turned it on and did n't even run any programs .	St
1.4.4	I figure with the cover off and no programs running heat should n't be a problem .	St
1.4.5	The computer still froze after a couple minutes .	St
1.4.6	I think I 'm going to try reformatting again and turning off the automatic updates to see what happens .	St
1.4.7	I 've heard of people having some issues with those before .	St
1.4.8	And here I was trying to pin all my problems on itunes !	St
1.4.9	I think my next computer will be a mac .	St
