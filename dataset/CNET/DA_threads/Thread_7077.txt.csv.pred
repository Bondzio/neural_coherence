1.1.1	Hi - I 've done some research on this but nothing seems to be working .	St
1.1.2	I have a wireless home network set up with one desktop and a few laptops connecting to the wireless router .	St
1.1.3	I 'm having internet connection problems with one of the laptops - all the rest work just fine .	St
1.1.4	I 've connected to the wireless network , however ca n't connect to the internet .	St
1.1.5	I manually added the ip address and dns server to the network connection to access the network , but it still wo n't connect to the internet ( although it says I 'm connected to the network , supposedly ) .	St
1.1.6	I 'm running XP on the laptop which can not connect ( the other computers are either XP or Vista ) .	St
1.1.7	The wireless router I use is DLink DI-524 .	St
1.1.8	I ran an ipconfig /all on the affected computer : DHCP is enabled IP Address is 192.168.0.1 , with the Default gateway and DNS server the same as the IP address .	St
1.1.9	I got the numbers to manually add from other computers connected to the network .	St
1.1.10	I 've tried pinging , too .	St
1.1.11	I 've gotten IP addresses to work , but not url 's .	St
1.1.12	I 'm not sure what other information is needed , but let me know .	St
1.1.13	The laptop has previously been connected to this network , so I 'm not sure why now it is not connecting to the internet and I have to manually add everything .	St
1.1.14	I 've checked hosts file , too .	St
1.1.15	Thanks for any help you can give , as I 'm at a loss for what to do next .	St
1.2.1	your gateway and DNS server should not be the same address .	St
1.2.2	The router LAN IP is the gateway .	St
1.2.3	The DNS server comes from the WAN side .	St
1.2.4	It would be your ISP server address but you do n't generally need to plug that in .	St
1.2.5	I would start by trying to connect the wired port and get it working first .	St
1.2.6	This can help rule out some issues with the laptop .	St
1.3.1	For wifi I rarely find that to work .	St
1.3.2	Go back to DHCP now .	St
1.3.3	Also let 's say this is a cable modem .	St
1.3.4	Be sure when switching to the router from a direct connection to power down the cable modem , move the ethernet to the router then power up the cable modem .	St
1.3.5	Why this is needed is written about widely .	St
1.3.6	I 'll stop here with one more admonishment .	St
1.3.7	Use our forum sticky for setup of the router .	St
1.3.8	Bob	St
1.4.1	I had the same problem occur before Christmas where my wireless laptop was connected to my home network but not connecting to the internet .	St
1.4.2	I had to do the following : 1 ) Open Network Connections 2 ) Right click on 'Local Area Connection ' and choose 'Properties ' 3 ) Click on 'Advanced ' tab 4 ) Uncheck box under 'Internet Connection Sharing ' next to 'Allow other network users to connect through this computer 's Internet connection ' This resolved the problem since I was able to successfully ping everything .
