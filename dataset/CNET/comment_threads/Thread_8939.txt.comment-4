Another driver.
Many think they can use a PC as delivered without worry about drivers.
This is sadly not true.
Since you revealed the make and model, here are the 2 drivers I would install.
But first, if you used your service like this... http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=gen&ServiceTag=9BWV351&SystemID=DIM_PNT_P4_CEL_2400&os=WW1&osl=en&catid=&impid= You would see what they offer.
Notice how some items are in the year 2007?
Are you keeping up?
See item 1 at http://downloadcenter.intel.com/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=816&OSFullName=Windows*+XP+Home+Edition&lang=eng&strOSs=45&submit=Go%21 Since the Dimension 2400 offered three different audio cards I can't offer which driver I'd use until you tell me a bit more.
