<s> I have two old Gateway PC's that I have cobbled together with spare parts. </s>
<s> One has all of the OEM software with keycodes. </s>
<s> I have installed Ubuntu on both of them. </s>
<s> One of them is a P3 700, with 192 mb of Ram and a 20 GB hard drive. </s>
<s> The other is a P3 550 with 320 MB of Ram, and 2 hard drives. </s>
<s> OS on a 10 GB and the data drive is a 20 GB. </s>
<s> Along with CRT monitors, keyboards and mice and speakers, I plan on taking the machines to Goodwill. </s>
<s> Unless I can find someone in need of a PC, I will take them tomorrow. </s>
<s> Any idea on value of them? </s>
<s> They both work. </s>
<s> The one with the least memory has a NIC card, I was just surfing the internet with it a few minutes ago. </s>
<s> The other PC only has a modem installed. </s>
<s> But for example, a new laptop starts at 299 so at best 1/2 that and only if there are legitimate CDs for the OS and what's loaded. </s>

<s> I have the Gateway software package that came new with one of the machines. </s>
<s> Along with it (98se) the keycodes and gateway recovery disk. </s>
<s> I had to put a NIC card in it, clean the lint and dirt, installed a new CMOS battery. </s>
<s> I installed UBUNTU on both machines. </s>
<s> I was going to offer them to someone for $50 apiece (includes CRT monitor, Mouse and keyboard, speakers.) </s>
<s> I just wondered if that was too much. </s>
<s> My nephew is able to ply a similar P3 1GHz etc. </s>
<s> no display at 100 bucks so the market is out there. </s>
<s> Again, compare with ebay, craigslist, etc. </s>
