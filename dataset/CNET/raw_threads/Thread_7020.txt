I have a single hard drive (250GB) that I have plugged into the SATA1 connector. I have 2 IDE Channels (one primary and one secondary). I currently have my DVD RW drive plugged into the secondard IDE channel. Is that correct? I was reading on a post that I need to buy an IDE card for the DVD but I don't see the sense in that if I have 2 IDE's available. Thank you for your thoughts. Tim

And to get the best effect I would use both channels. -&gt; Yes SATA can be faster but most DVD drives have read limits well below the SATA speeds and even IDE rates. Let me comment that for XP, installing to a SATA drive (XP retail versions) can be troublesome for some. If I wanted to make it harder to install I'd give my tech all SATA components. This changes in Vista but that's another can of worms. Bob
