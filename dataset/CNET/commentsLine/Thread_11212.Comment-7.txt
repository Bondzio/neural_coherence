hi bob, this is not really new ground for me, i have some experience on it.
dhcp server is 192.168.1.1 and ap2 cannot reach it so it has problem obtaining adresses automatically.
gateway is 192.168.1.1/24.
any information you request will be added to diagram, i would really appreciate help on this one
