This happens regardless of how large the park is or how much activity is going on, whether it's 100 customers or 1000 customers in the park moving. I'm thinking it's because of my graphics card, and I've considered upgrading it. Windows Vista says it's because of the MJPEG codec, which apparently is the audio and video content. I have a Dell Dimension E521 with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+ 2.00 GHz, 2GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 6150 LE. Is it because of the graphics card that is causing the problem? Around how much and how difficult would it be to upgrade it? Thanks in advance.

Vista says the MJPEG codec is the reason for the crash. I'll try to download the codec package to see if it might work, otherwise I'll consider upgrading my graphics card. Will all graphics cards work on my computer or can I only buy a select few that are compatible? Thanks in advance.
