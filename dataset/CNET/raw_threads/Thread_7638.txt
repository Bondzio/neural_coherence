6409	2	593658	5460362	5460380	Cooforcer	5/24/13 2:57 PM	1.36940742E12	.,	by custom i mean i bought it by pieces and build it myself.

You do take a bit of risk about such building your own machine but all the parts should be in warranty so it's a pain but you are now in the RMA and swap parts till it works again phase. Bob
6409	4	593658	5460385	5460373	Cooforcer	5/24/13 3:18 PM	1.36940868E12	no warranty for me	the problem is most of the parts form my &quot;new&quot; pc are used including the motherboard and psu... So if it comes to that i will have a harder time trying to get my money back. just my luck...
6409	5	593658	5460376	5460385	R. Proffitt	5/24/13 3:22 PM	1.36940892E12	As you change your questions, the answers change.	Your top post lead with it being new. Now it's not new but something else. It's pretty hard to diagnose as it is but when dealing with dead computers the common advice remains the same. If in warranty, use the warranty. If out of warranty you have to decide if you are going to be a PC repair tech. There are millions of posts about fixing a dead PC. Basically you swap out the most suspect part. If you can't tell which part then you use the old advice of &quot;replace the cheapest part first.&quot; Bob

If so, take out the motherboard and remove all and I do mean ALL STANDOFFS that we use to mount the motherboard. Now only install the ones that are needed. But first, build the PC on a chunk of cardboard. If it works there it could be that old issue with an extra standoff. I've lost count of folk that tell me it can't be this because it worked. Hopefully you've been around long enough to guess why this matters. Bob

As stated to you, its best to remove and build on some cardboard and check operations that way. Use a household fan to cool it as added cooling. If it works for some extended period, like in hrs. then you then need to check/inspect the case as mentioned. Note where standoffs are, etc. and return mtbd. alone to case. Tighten screws but don't over do it and make some are grounded if plastic standoffs are used as well. Understand what PSU you have, is it single or dual rail type. If dual, balance the load requirements better or replace entirely. Build the PC as basic as possibel and check results to see how it operates. Also, just where did it fail after 1hr. how did it fail, shutdown, froze, didn't respond, still loading s/w, maybe the last action is the culprit. Don't do any OC'ing if so done, return to defaults. Have you updated the bios yet before any major installs, etc.? Was the parts tested elsewhere or do you know its history, etc.. If you got a good deal at the time, you may now know why, it was an iffy part. In other words don't take things for granted, you now have to sort things out and test results. Last, did you apply heatsink paste correctly on cpu as that can be a sign it failed when it got to be too much heat or pushed into a upper heat range. Further, do all fans or cooling work as intended? You need to know your &quot;airflow&quot; as some operations may conflict. It may already bee too late if due to heat stress the weakest link finally gave in and failed. One thing I have the habit of doing is swapping the PSU out, if during power-ON the cpu fan just twitches or spins for a moment, then nothing. If it isn't the PSU then that leaves the mtrbd., and any issues arising from operation, NOT good. So recheck your work as best as possible. tada -----Willy

I contacted the seller and he said he would refund.
6409	9	593658	5460757	5460464	Cooforcer	5/25/13 2:33 PM	1.36949238E12	Nop	when i was testing the compouter i wasnt even using a case, the mobo was on top of a anti static bag on top of a box, so that was not the issue.
