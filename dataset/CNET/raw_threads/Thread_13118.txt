Proffitt	8/22/13 11:35 AM	1.3771713E12	Looks average for used, etc.	For me it's a no sale because of folk that complain in these forums about random reboots and that setup is listed too often. The 160GB drive looks small today and well, as to the virus scan why is that needed as we can slip in the OS DVD, reload and then all the drivers to be sure it doesn't have a rootkit or worse? Bob

However, I do see this as a dated PC when compared to gaming usage. if this PC was in fact used as a gaming platform, it got used under stressful conditions and you're left with what available provided it still works well. It's used, you take it all with a grain of salt. If you plan to re-use as a gaming platform, then you must before you actually do, tweek it up or assure that what you can is at a level to do all it can do as a &quot;stable PC&quot; platform. I would see this PC at the $250-300 range and prove what is new is new if not, reduce the cost more. That's IMHO. tada -----Willy

A friend of mine purchased a Lenovo desktop, intel, i-3 6gb of ram 1tb HDD for 429.00 at Office depot.

Everyone else is right, you can get a new, faster PC for just around $100 more, that will out perform this one on craigslist. There are lots and lots of people on Craigslist who fancy themselves as PC salesmen. They will paint a big picture of this great machine they have for only $xxx. It is better to not put out this kind of money for any used PC, unless they can demonstrate to you in person that it will indeed live up to the hype they are talking.

There is no game in the market this PC can't play on high resolution!&quot; , then why is he selling it? As others have said, it's long in the tooth, not particularly well configured and not particularly cheap. At $200-250, maybe but personally, I'd look elsewhere. YMMV!
