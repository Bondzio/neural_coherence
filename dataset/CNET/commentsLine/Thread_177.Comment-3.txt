much thanks for your timely reply.
with the advance of virtualization i just thought it might be possible to virtualize applications to a usb drive.
the two obvious barriers would be power and a physical connection to a router.
just wondering if there is anything like this in existence or being ontemplated.
ideally, i would would like to access some things without having a desktop on 24/7.
