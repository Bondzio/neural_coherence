<s> What do I do if the silver part of the processor comes off of the green part of the processor?? </s>
<s> It is attached only by a grounding wire. </s>
<s> What kind of extra hard drives does it take? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> what model of G3 Mac do you have? </s>
<s> iMac G3 (tray Loading) iMac G3 (Slot Loading) iMac G3 (Slot Loading with Firewire) Mac G3 B/W PowerBook G3 (and all its different models) Please read the red type, above your post, and then ask the question again. </s>
<s> Thanks P </s>
<s> It is an apple blue and white power macintosh g3 desktop, family number M5183. </s>
<s> came with an ATA drive (regular IDE drive) and will support two of them. </s>
<s> Each one should not exceed 120GB because the LBA used on this series will not support anything higher than 127GB. </s>
<s> As for the first part of the question, put it back where it was and leave it alone. </s>
<s> If the machine is still running correctly, great. </s>
<s> As a matter of curiosity, how did the two pieces become separated? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I got it on ebay. </s>
<s> It was once a school computer. </s>
<s> It is still running just fine. </s>
<s> It's my first mac. </s>
<s> I haven't used them in years so I am slightly rusty. </s>
<s> What is the name of the expansion slots on the logic board?? </s>
<s> I want to look for USB port expansion cards. </s>
<s> and the addition of USB 2.0, and a few extra firewire ports on the same card, is always a good idea. </s>
<s> They are readily available. </s>
<s> Bear in mind that this machine will not be able to run the latest version of OS X and, if it is running OS X at all, probably has 10.3.9 or 10.4.x on it. </s>
<s> Good Luck P </s>
<s> It has 9.2 and I might upgrade to a more recent version someday, or perhaps I will get an additional machine, probably a notebook because too many desktops take up more space, and install OS X on something whenever needed....because like I said I haven't used a mac for years and even on an older OS I am still having lots of fun on it!! </s>
<s> Just wondering how does the Heatsink stay on anyways?? </s>
<s> Is it electromagnetic?? </s>
<s> Because if there is supposed to be that slimey cooling gel or whatever that stuff is between a processor and heatsink, that stuff is not present. </s>
<s> The heat sink is, or is supposed to be, attached to the processor with a clip. </s>
<s> The clip is shaped so that it exerts downward pressure on the heatsink. </s>
<s> It has a slot in both ends which attach to a plastic hook on the processor seat. </s>
<s> This is the same as many PC heat sinks are attached. </s>
<s> There should be some thermal paste between the heat sink and the processor. </s>
<s> YOU SHOULD NOT OPERATE YOUR COMPUTER UNTIL THE HEAT SINK IS CORRECTLY ATTACHED. </s>
<s> You WILL fry the processor if the heat sink is not attached correctly. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> ...That I am not planning to use it immediately anyways... </s>
<s> Since it only has ethernet connection on it and since I have more than one computer now, I will just get high speed interent before I finish setting it up... </s>
<s> Right now I am searching for websites for heatsink repair that has clips and thermal paste...do you know of any to recommend? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> You already have the heat sink, you just need the clip and some thermal paste. </s>
<s> The paste you can get from Radio Shack and you may be able to get a clip from your local computer repair shop. </s>
<s> They are pretty generic. </s>
<s> After you get the High Speed internet, don't forget the router P </s>
