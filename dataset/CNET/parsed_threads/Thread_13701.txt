<s> ok, hang with me here... 1. </s>
<s> I get MetroFi here in Portland, OR. </s>
<s> A free city-wide wifi service, which is actually pretty good, I live 2 houses away from a hub. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I also have a Playstation 3, which recognizes the &quot;MetroFi&quot; signal but cannot connect b/c there is a login page when you first access the internet on a computer. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I was told by a MetroFi volunteer that I have to pull in the free Metro-Fi signal, through a wireless router (I have a Linksys Wireless Router that wifi'ed my old Comcast connection). </s>
<s> Then the PS3 will be able to read it. </s>
<s> How can I accomplish this?! </s>
<s> I have a Mac, fwiw. </s>
<s> please let me know if I can explain further. </s>
<s> metrofi wifi modem -&gt; (ethernet) -&gt; WAN PORT of your router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> sorry Bob, I dont understand. </s>
<s> there is no MetroFi modem. </s>
<s> It's a wireless signal that Im able to get in my house. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Thank you for helping Bob, but I just dont understand what you're trying to say. </s>
<s> You write in a cryptic manner. </s>
<s> Everything is wifi ready...my router, Mac and PS3. </s>
<s> It was all working fine when I had Comcast High-Speed, but obviously it came into my house as ethernet, then I routed it to the Linksys Wireless Router, which my PS3 was able to pick up. </s>
<s> It's a http://www.netgear.com/Products/PrintServers/WirelessPrintServers/WGPS606.aspx This device connects to some wifi WAP and then it's clients don't have to do anything as to logins. </s>
<s> I can also connect one of those ports to the wan port of a router and viola, I have something just like your normal wifi router connected to broadband. </s>
<s> I know what you want to do but I don't know if you have the hardware. </s>
<s> Maybe you wanted to use a PC but didn't tell. </s>
<s> I could note &quot;ICS&quot; but with all the web docs about that I won't copy those here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks Bob, but I would like to use my current hardware. </s>
<s> I was told it could be done. </s>
<s> can anyone else help? </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx Then you use that ethernet off to the wan port of the router... Definitely a way to learn TCPIP! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It would help to learn the model number of the Linksys Wireless Router you have -- maybe that model has an ethernet bridge mode. </s>
<s> Also, please confirm that you can connect to MetroFi with your existing Mac. </s>
<s> Generally, what is needed to connect a wireless network to your home network is an Ethernet Bridge MetroFi wireless cloud &lt;-wireless-&gt; Wireless Ethernet Bridge &lt;-ethernet-&gt; home LAN router with Ethernet ports and/or wireless WANport If the home LAN router has both both wireless capability and ethernet LAN ports, you can connect to that router with _either_ wireless _or_ ethernet cable on both* your PS3 and your Mac. </s>
<s> *Wireless LAN connections assumes that your PS3 and Mac have wireless capability built in (or added as an option.) </s>
<s> One _example_ of a wireless ethernet bridge is Buffalo Technology AirStation Turbo G High Power Wireless Ethernet Converter (WLI-TX4-G54HP) But for the same cost, I would just buy the Ruckus Wireless solution that MetroFi features. </s>
<s> Ruckus MM2211 </s>
<s> I went to Frys in Wilsonville for an external antenna that had been advertised in a MetroFi Internet ad several months ago. </s>
<s> A helpful clerk convinced me to buy a different external antenna and two 15-foot booster cables. </s>
<s> I plugged the booster cable from the antenna into my laptops USB port. </s>
<s> I disabled my laptops internal modem so I could use the IEEE wireless USB utility. </s>
<s> Now, I open the double-pane window and set the antenna outside to receive a strong signal (85-95%) inside my apartment. </s>
<s> I leave the window open just enough for the cable, and I can have the laptop on a desk across the room. </s>
<s> Not very wireless, but it is free. </s>
<s> Otherwise, I have to sit outside on my balcony to get MetroFi. </s>
