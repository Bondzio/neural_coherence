1.1.1	Hi all , think this is probably my first ever post here .	St
1.1.2	Anyways , my matter is as follows : I do a lot of scientific computing on my desktop , runing R or occasionally MatLab codes .	St
1.1.3	The programmes run for several hours typically .	St
1.1.4	The calculation is mostly simple +-*/^ , just that the number of iterations is usually very very large .	St
1.1.5	And quite often , I work with high dimension matrices .	St
1.1.6	As my old Dell desktop is dying , I am starting to plan next work station and I would love to build one by myself .	St
1.1.7	My key question is which specification should I be after ?	Ques
1.1.8	Is it a fast CPU ?	Ques
1.1.9	Lots of memory ?	Ques
1.1.10	L2 cache ?	Ques
1.1.11	I do n't really have a clue .	St
1.1.12	Do n't know if this is feasible at all , but I have a budge round 500 ( or $ 800 ) for mobo/cpu/memory/case/psu .	St
1.1.13	Thanks a lot !	St
1.2.1	What I 'd do is copy someone 's working machine .	St
1.2.2	Also , your OS and software will eat up most of the budget so you may have to consider the Intel i3 CPU .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the quick response !	St
1.3.2	My budget is only for the listed hardware .	St
1.3.3	All the software and OS is either free or transferable from my old PC so not a problem .	St
1.3.4	I have a worry that most branded work stations are for rather & quot ; general & quot ; purposes whereas I am hoping to make a well tailored one specifically for my needs .	St
1.3.5	Also I have asked around my friends who work on similar things , they all seem to be happy with their current settings ( mostly core2duo , a few i3 i5 ) .	St
1.3.6	Maybe I am a bit impatient , but at least I 'd like to try and see if I can make a change	St
1.4.1	& quot ; I have a worry that most branded work stations are for rather & quot ; general & quot ; purposes & quot ; If it is that special purpose then why would we consider a general purpose computer ?	Ques
1.4.2	Sorry but let me introduce myself .	St
1.4.3	I 'm one of those folk that designs embedded computers and other solutions .	St
1.4.4	The reason we use general purpose computers on Intel and such CPUs is they deliver a big bang for the buck .	St
1.4.5	These are not considered & quot ; specific purpose & quot ; like a recent design had with a rack of DSP ( digital signal processing ) CPUs .	St
1.4.6	I 'd reconsider a nice ready to use Intel i7 machine .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	So back to my original question , if you do n't mind , with a constrained budget as mine , should I invest in cpu , memory , mobo or a bit of everything ?	Ques
1.5.2	Could you recommend some ready to use machines ?	Ques
1.5.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.1	The usual 4GB Intel i7 powered machine .	St
1.6.2	Even a dell might be found for that if you do n't go with GAMER video cards .	St
1.6.3	Too bad the machine you use today was not revealed .	St
1.6.4	It could serve as a point of reference .	St
1.6.5	Such as it 's 2GB versus 4GB .	St
1.6.6	Why it matters is that 4GB is not double 2GB .	St
1.6.7	It 's much more than that since the OS ate a little ( ? )	Ques
1.6.8	of that 2GB .	St
1.6.9	I see folk going overboard on such things .	St
1.6.10	Bob	St
1.7.1	Your budget limits you IMO .	St
1.7.2	You maybe better to get the absolute best cpu you can afford with SOME ram .	St
1.7.3	The ram you can add more later .	St
1.7.4	Your s/w MUST BE capable of using whatever it has available so if the cpu being muliple core gets full usage under demand , etc..	St
1.7.5	The ram alone is highly desirable as it needs that to breathe sorta speak and flex its muscles .	St
1.7.6	While the i5 class of cpu maybe costly compared to i3 , you would be better served and the cpu cache should be at least 4M , better if possible .	St
1.7.7	The i3 is more of entry level or offering on a budget .	St
1.7.8	besides Intel , AMD offers good cpus too , but IMHO sticking with Intel would be a better choice .	St
1.7.9	Check the Intel support website and locate the specs of i3 and i5 and compare , AMD too if you like .	St
1.7.10	A work station is more of a workhorse rather than a home desktop and speed is n't usually the main factor , its what it can do for long periods and/or tasks .	St
1.7.11	As Robert pointed out , see what a workstation consists of and see if you build similar .	St
1.7.12	I definitely would look for many ram slots and the mtrbd .	St
1.7.13	chipset and in many cases video is build-in and should n't be a big factor in your final system .	St
1.7.14	Effectively you want raw power rather than speed .	St
1.7.15	Cooling should be a must too and darn good big case to house it all .	St
1.7.16	Help ? ? ?	Ques
1.7.17	http : //www.firingsquad.com/hardware/workstation/default.asp tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktops/ is a start .	St
1.8.2	I see a Dell with the i7 at 899 which is n't bad for a ready to use machine considering the i7 alone is a big chunk of the outlay .	St
1.8.3	http : //www.amazon.com/Intel-Processor-2-80GHz-LGA1366-BX80601930/dp/B0038JE9MU http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-studio-xps-9100/4505-3118_7-34291827.html ? tag= [ object NodeList ] ; resultsShell Bob	St
1.9.1	I learnt a lot from reading your posts .	St
1.9.2	Thanks Robert .	St
1.9.3	My current PC is a Dell Dimension 5100 with Core2Duo E6400 and 2G memory , which I purchased years ago .	St
1.9.4	I doubt if there 's anything in there valuable for my new PC , so I am planning to convert it into a media PC to use with my TV .	St
1.9.5	I guess I will play with an i7 setting for a bit and see how the price come together .	St
1.9.6	Cheers .	Polite
1.10.1	Thanks Willy for the details .	St
1.10.2	That link seems interesting - I guess the mindset for building workstations has n't changed so much as the actual hardware .	St
1.10.3	I am a little confused by your post 's title though , because I monitor the memory usage when my programme runs and I have never run out of memory .	St
1.10.4	So will more RAM still be helpful in that situation ?	Ques
1.11.1	My work , works well on laptops .	St
1.11.2	Over the past decade I 've moved from Compaq R3000 with AMD 64 2GHz single core to HP AMD dv6000 x2 Turion to HP dv6 core2duo to what I use today which is a Dell i15r 2646MRB with Intel 's i5 6GB RAM and more .	St
1.11.3	Each has been a nice step up .	St
1.11.4	I knew not to go to the i7 for a laptop so I wait for the next advance before I consider anything more powerful .	St
1.11.5	The Dell was only 749 and my only quibble is the LCD is barely acceptable but for the price it 's quite a deal .	St
1.11.6	- & gt ; I have this computationally intensive app I wrote that sifts through some 4 billion number sets and it completes in 10 or so minutes .	St
1.11.7	For me , this is fast enough .	St
1.11.8	If the i7 is out of the budget , the i5 is quite nice .	St
1.11.9	My core2duo took about twice as long .	St
1.11.10	Bob	St
1.12.1	The statement RAM adds speed is disproved many times .	St
1.12.2	Mind you that those with scientific or math routines to run are the ones that can dish it out on that statement .	St
1.12.3	On my Dell I can unplug 2GB and my 4 billion sifting app completes in exactly the amount of time it did with 2GB more .	St
1.12.4	For me this is proof the RAM does not add speed .	St
1.12.5	Also , if HIBERNATE my 4GB setup , hibernation completes many seconds sooner and it wakes up faster with less RAM .	St
1.12.6	Wow , what goes here ?	Ques
1.12.7	Less RAM is faster ?	Ques
1.12.8	Bob	St
1.13.1	A system will fall back on & quot ; virtual memory & quot ; using the HD as if ram .	St
1.13.2	So , you may not see this as a factor or more so .	St
1.13.3	I suggeted getting the best cpu NOW rather than later as that 's a major cost of a new system .	St
1.13.4	The ram usually is capable , say you get 4gb for starters , you can add later if the need arises .	St
1.13.5	I 'm sure that 's more than your current old PC .	St
1.13.6	I would also like to add the benefits of X86-64bit OS , which leads me to think you 're using a 32-bit version of OS .	St
1.13.7	The 64-bit version will better handle mutiple core cpus and/or make use of it , BUT the s/w should be ready for such , is it ?	Ques
1.13.8	If your s/w is 64-bit capable even though though 32-bit will run it may find a better world with 64-bit , however I do n't get into s/w matters that much any more , other than reading the details of it .	St
1.13.9	Further as I already stated check with vendors what they offer in details/specs and you can upgrade abit when you build and get better system as that 's open to you .	St
1.13.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.14.1	I appreciate all your replies .	Polite
1.14.2	The points are clear .	St
1.14.3	I 'll start looking around and checking with the big vendors ( lots of work to do ) .	St
