<s> Just recently, my laptop is unable to connect to our home router. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Inspiron e1505 and the wireless card came installed. </s>
<s> When I try to manually connect to the profile, I receive the error &quot;Problem applying profile&quot;. </s>
<s> To my knowledge, nothing has changed with the set up on either end. </s>
<s> It connects fine to my neighbor's system. </s>
<s> Intel said they cannot help since it came installed on my laptop. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on what to check to troubleshoot this? </s>
<s> I'd be looking at your router and not the laptop device for an answer. </s>
<s> If you've not cycled it off and back on, that's the first thing to do. </s>
<s> You must have been able to set it up via its web interface. </s>
<s> Can you access that? </s>
<s> Sounds like the laptop is fine though. </s>
