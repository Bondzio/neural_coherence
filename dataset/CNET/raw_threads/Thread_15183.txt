I've been to the HP website, chatted with the tech on-line and I refuse to send it in for servicing. Not worth the money. The bottom line is I'm looking for a reliable printer. I don't want an HP. I no longer need the scan or fax capability. Color or just B&W would be fine. Suggestions welcomed....

There are other makes out there and just about all basic laser printers do fine. If you still need color and an inkjet, then look at Canon models. I would not recommend Epson or Lexmark as they're expensive to operate and when an Epson pukes, it does so expensively. HP still makes a good printer look at other simpler models, maybe one that accepts similar ink carts. As for a true reliable printer then also look into Okidata, more expensive but real workhorses. tada -----Willy
