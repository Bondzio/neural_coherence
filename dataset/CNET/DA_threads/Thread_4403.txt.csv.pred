1.1.1	Bought mom an ipad and have been playing at home for two weeks on the device .	St
1.1.2	I 'm ready to get mom an ISP set up at her home .	St
1.1.3	Since the ipad is the only device she will have , my thoughts were to get the cheapest service ( DSL ) a wireless modem and be done with it .	St
1.1.4	Because she only has an ipad device and no computer , I am limited to the most basic of connectivity devices .	St
1.1.5	I was looking at the Cisco Valet ... .but frankly ... not sure from the website if the usb doodad has to dangle from the ipad .	St
1.1.6	That would be a non-starter .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions for a single device connectivity set up ?	Ques
1.1.8	Also , I have left a more technical request under the wireless forum related to wifi signals and hearing aid interference .	St
1.1.9	I have a horrible feeling I may have jumped the gun buying the basic device and not waiting for 3G .	St
1.1.10	I have my own issues with my iphone service and AT & T ... so felt it best to get DSL separately .	St
1.1.11	Any thoughts , suggestions and feedback are welcome !	Polite
1.1.12	Thanks in advance !	St
1.1.13	GG	St
1.2.1	Hi GG .	St
1.2.2	Being into tech myself and a girl i really appreciated your post .	St
1.2.3	The simplest way to connect would be to get her a wireless router type system from a landline for connectivity without having the ISP connector dangling .	St
1.2.4	Once you are up and going , i would suggest DISH Network service for her as well .	St
1.2.5	I work at DISH Network and they have live-streaming content that she can choose to watch wherever she goes .	St
1.2.6	Your mom would also be able to be part of DISH Network 's lowest digital pricing .	St
1.2.7	Let me know if you have questions about DISH Network .	St
1.2.8	There are a lot of TV providers like Comcast attempting to catch up to DISH 's TV EVERYWHERE .	St
1.2.9	Nancy	St
1.3.1	Dish network ! ? ! ? !	Ques
1.3.2	And yes I have been with Dish for about 10-12 years , happy with them , there are good for tv but not broadband .	Res
1.4.1	1st have you done the 4.2 update for the iPad ?	Ques
1.4.2	You do not need a dongle , it has built-in WiFi ! ! !	St
1.4.3	One you need a modem 1st , it is different then a router , I use a SpeedStream 5360 , then you need a router ; phone line too modem too ( using cat5/6 cable ) router .	St
1.4.4	d-link & Linksys/Cisco are the top routers .	St
1.4.5	You will also need a in-line filter for each phone in the house , about $ 5 each .	St
1.4.6	How big is her place ?	Ques
1.4.7	That will determine what router you get , some have short range some much more .	Sug
1.4.8	Like mine I have extending 12 & quot ; dual antennas on my Linksys/Cisco router ( few have that option ) because I have 1/3 acre & also sometimes have to take me computer or iPad to the next-door neighbors , I have about a 500ft+ range with my router ( WRT54GL ) & run it open WiFi with no security set up like WEP/WPA on the router , it is useless to someone that knows how to crack them , safest to change the ADMI password something weird .	St
1.4.9	OK for DLS , I have the mid range AT & T package but because of how DLS works I only get .5mbps , when I first got it , no one on the street had DLS so I was getting the full 1.5mbps .	St
1.4.10	If you can , ask her neighbors that have DSL , find out their real speeds are ; run a speed test if they do not know if they will let you ( C/net.com has a speed test , there is also the FCC app & Speed test app , both are free , made for the iPhone/iTouch but work on the iPad ) & find out what package they have .	St
1.4.11	Also what will she be needing the Internet for ?	Ques
1.4.12	Video like YouTube or the ABC app which works very good on & quot ; slow speeds & quot ; , YouTube is slow on the my iPad but on my Panasonic tv or PC YouTube streaming is fine , not great .	St
1.4.13	.5mbps is fine for X-box live gaming .	St
1.4.14	If just web surfing with little videos watching & email the slowest package should be fine .	St
1.4.15	If she starts watching more & more videos she will not be happy with bottom end package & she be wanting to throw the iPad out the window then .	St
1.4.16	For Satellite broadband , get that only if you have too , only ! ! !	St
1.4.17	like if she lived outside of DLS coverage .	St
1.4.18	My uncle had to have satellite broadband ( HughesNet ) & I could never send him more then 2 photos because it is slow ... upload speeds & download speeds , it was not much faster then dial-up & he had the mid range package , $ 68 ( or so ) a month , for the near DLS speeds your talking $ 160 a month about & still have a good lag .	St
1.4.19	So you need : A Modem A Router In-line filter for each phone An ISP provider Note AT & T has a 2in1 modem & router & quot ; 2wire & quot ; they may force you to buy for an over charged price , they did that to me so that I could get special monthly rate of $ 18 & a 1 year contract ( 6 years later it is $ 28 a month , same package & slower real speed ) , I do not know if they changed that .	St
1.4.20	It is not very well built , kept falling over all the time , short range & it died 2 weeks after the warranty expired , $ 60 gone there .	St
