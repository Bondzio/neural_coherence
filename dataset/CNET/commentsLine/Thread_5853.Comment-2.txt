i do not know much about video cards but i do know that their both different connection..the aiw 9800 pro is agp and the other is pci...i don't know but does your motherboard both have agp and pci connections...but other than that i do not know which one will run better..however...you should read the specs on both video card and see which one has higher performance at certain values.
