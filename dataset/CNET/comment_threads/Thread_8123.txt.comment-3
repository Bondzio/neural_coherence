Shuttle AV30 socket 370 board that's showing rust stains on the caps.
Only recently it has been reported that the board undergoes spontaneous reboot or multiple reboot tries before getting into Windows.
Unfortunately Shuttle has not stepped up to the plate in dealing with this issue.
I would like to get them to deal with it.
