<s> I'm looking at purchasing an external hard drive that connects via firewire(IEEE 1394). </s>
<s> It seems there are two kinds, 4 and 6 wire. </s>
<s> I have a PCI firewire card that I know accepts the 4 wire variety . </s>
<s> What is the 6 wire used for? </s>
<s> and will my card accept both? </s>
<s> In short, the 6 wire can carry power to the device. </s>
<s> In a nutshell, a 4 wire device can be wired to a 6 wire port but not always the opposite. </s>
