after using select all, copy, paste to create larger .mov files from 2 smaller ones: the movies do not contain the resource files - qt reports &quot;cannot find file &quot;name of file.&quot; same happens after using &quot;add audio file&quot; via the edit menu.
previous: these operations worked 100s of times.
is this due to corrupt prefs?
if so, which one?
using a mac pro, 10.6.7 w/ 8 gb ram.
no other problems.
tia for any help.
