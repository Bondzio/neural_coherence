i upgraded from xp to windows 7 and was thrilled.
the os actually worked, and all my printers, scanners and everything worked as soon as i plugged it in.
even my old canon bjc 85 portable printer.
worked perfect without downloading drivers or programming(which by the way was not available with vista.)
