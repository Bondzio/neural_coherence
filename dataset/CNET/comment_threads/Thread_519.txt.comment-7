Zone alarm firewall zones include one for 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and a firewall zone network range of 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.254.
That I have had during the times that the network was functional.
I have also tried temp killing zone alarm, also my av.
To be internet safe, I did this with the satellite server de-powered.
Thanks for the suggestion, though.
One thing that I forgot to mention to Bob was this problem first showed up after Sony had me reatore the sony XP to its factory state.
When I broached this subject to a Sony 2nd tier rep, he gave up and said that networking was not their expertise and that I sould hire a local &quot;networking specialist&quot; to aid me.
Frankly the last 2 &quot;specialists&quot; created more problems that they solved.
Well, I shall keep my fingers crossed and keep trying.
Thanks again..Charles
