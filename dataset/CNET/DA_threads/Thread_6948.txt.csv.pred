1.1.1	Fellow members , I recently installed a new hard drive .	St
1.1.2	In my efforts to get the thing working I must have changed some setting in BIOS , which I had to fool with , because now the system is doing a tedious RAM check routine on the black screen with each boot .	St
1.1.3	It takes a couple of precious minutes to count up to 512. fyi it is Ami BIOS .	St
1.1.4	I can not discover any changes to make in BIOS setup to disable it .	St
1.1.5	2 .	St
1.1.6	The setup shows the SMART drive feature is disabled .	St
1.1.7	I would like it running .	St
1.2.1	also post the mobo type to give a clue lots of ami bios ' .	St
1.2.2	Check the mobo manual which usually describes which bios features are in your bios and what they do .	St
1.2.3	Make sure that in adding the drive you did not unseat the memory or that you have not created a heat situation .	St
1.2.4	It also sounds as if you may have added a bios add-on with the drive .	St
1.2.5	Knowing your O/S will also give a better clue .	St
1.3.1	You need to enable quick post ( power on self test ) .	St
1.3.2	I think it 's in advanced bios setup .	St
1.3.3	May depend on your bios version .	St
1.3.4	OS Does n't matter .	St
1.4.1	Save and exit .	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the info .	St
1.5.2	It has stopped doing that foolishness .	St
1.5.3	Anyway it was saying & quot ; testing NV RAM & quot ; - which means Non-Volatile RAM -- which makes no sense .	St
