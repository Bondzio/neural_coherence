5847	0	295077	2774949	NR	doowopper	5/17/08 5:28 AM	1.21100208E12	Wireless mouse - cursor jumps around	I am using a Windows XP Professional computer. I just bought the Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 to replace the same set. The set contains a wireless mouse and a wireless keyboard. When I move the cursor to the right edge of the screen with the mouse, the cursor will often will move on its own to a different place on the screen. I tried adjusting some of the settings in the Mouse Properties screen but that didn't seem to help. What could be causing this problem and how do I fix it? Thanks. Richard

Its because of 3 reasons. The first one is the mouse pad on which you move the mouse. Some colors doesn't reflect the rays from the mouse. so if you move the mouse to the color where it can reflect it the mouse pointer jumps to it. second thing the mouse battery as well as the tracking of wireless receiver and your mouse. Don't take the mouse to near the receiver and press the button to identify it. put the mouse in a place where you are going to use it and press the buttons at the bottom of the mouse and the receiver. third one is the driver. check the driver is correct.
