i am running windows xp with service pack 2 , and i am installing ati catalyst 5.3(the latest version) , my card is &quot;ati radeon 9000&quot; , recently , in the middle of the games , the system reboots , i tried more than ane game but all are the same , after 15 to 30 mins of the game the machine reboots , and my processor's fan is working fine , this issue doesn't happen at all at applications except games , that's why i believe it's a driver issue ,the games i tried are c&c generals , nhl 2005 and fifa 2005 .
any suggestions?
thanx in advance
