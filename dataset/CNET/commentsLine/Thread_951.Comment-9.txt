i can understand why you don't use fat32 at files as large as 4gb.
most home users don't have files that large.
i have a folder with other folders in it as large as 14gb on both fat32 and ntfs.
my xp disk doesn't give me a choice of fat32 with partitions larger than 32gb.
does yours?
the links you sent still doesn't prove witch is faster.
i'm not trying to argue a point.
just trying to gain knowledge.
