<s> Hey Im relatively new to this website and to the advanced computer society. </s>
<s> So please use simple wording for me. </s>
<s> Id hate to make an entire new thread just to figure out what u were saying. </s>
<s> Anyways Ive been trying to format my Dell Inspiron 8400 Desktop, but everytime i try to install windows on my computer it says my hard drive isnt installed. </s>
<s> But if i just let the computer start up Windows runs, poorly, so i know there's a operational hard drive. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> The older versions of Windows (XP is now old?) </s>
<s> don't see SATA hard disks under some conditions. </s>
<s> You'll use the F6 key while the XP install CD is running and offer that diskette with the drivers specific to your PC. </s>
<s> No offense but if you can't find this you may not know all the other drivers you'll need. </s>
<s> I suggest you run a simple free online spyware scan such as http://www.ewido.net/en/onlinescan/ then disk cleanup and see if that helps. </s>
<s> Installing Windows is not trivial and while I'd love to read everyone knows how to install it, this is not the case today. </s>
<s> Let's try something simple. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Id try to run a spyware test but my hdd is already wiped. </s>
<s> Gonna go try the f6 method and with any luck itll be running better than R2D2. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help </s>
