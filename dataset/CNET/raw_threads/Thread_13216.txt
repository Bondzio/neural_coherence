4982	0	596268	5472974	NR	kimbodo	7/1/13 9:29 AM	1.37267094E12	Can I upgrade my Inspiron 546?	Im trying to upgrade my dell inspiron 546 due to lack of funds to build a new rig. I have bought graphics cards in past, but ive never bought a PSU or put in a PSU before, but I am sure, with guidance I could certainly do it. I want to make sure these parts will actually work with my inspiron before i buy them so thats why I am posting here today. PSU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139026 Vid Card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130839 I know that the current graphics card i have in now is a 220 GT and its worth about 30 dollars and its pretty old along with my computer. So I dont know if this new card would even work with my mobo or anything and i also dont know if the PSU would fit in my tower ( Its not a slim so it should? )

I didn't find your model so you should link to your exact model. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html on the page http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-3.html shows a few 650 video cards so a good choice. That PSU looks to be the MINIMUM asked for (I read 450 Watt minimum on the pages so far) and the full review at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-boost-gk106-benchmark,3463.html has me worried about longevity of the PSU. I see about 200 Watts alone for the Video card so if we want a 5 year machine we double the Watt capability of the PSU. That's a bit high at 900 so the PSU is an iffy choice here. If you can get another 100 Watts and keep the single rail +12V then you should be fine for years. Bob

This is my computer, im not sure if this is what you wanted or not. http://www.dell.com/support/troubleshooting/us/en/19/Servicetag/B508GK1 Instead of the 430 maybe a 600W? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139028 Im just worried about the card not being compatible with my motherboard.

Proffitt	7/1/13 10:05 AM	1.3726731E12	I see a PCIe X16 slot.	&quot;PCI Express x16 one slot supporting full-height cards&quot; So can you share what made you think it was incompatible? Once in a while you see a question about PCIe 1.x 2.x etc but the answer can un-nerve those that asked. Bob

4982	5	596268	5472983	5473005	kimbodo	7/1/13 10:25 AM	1.3726743E12	Okay.	Ive had a few bad experiences upgrading video cards on a computer of mine when i was a kid, and I didnt know for sure if my motherboard had a PCI Express 3.0 x16 slot or if that card would fit, but thank you for your help. So in conclusion I could upgrade my inspiron successfully with these parts? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130910 and http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139028

As I don't own this machine all I can write is that it looks OK. If you want, wait for someone that will assure you further. Good luck! Bob
4982	7	596268	5472986	5473012	kimbodo	7/1/13 11:05 AM	1.3726767E12	It looks alright	I measured and it seems the boost wont fit, but the previous one i mentioned will definitely fit in my case. Thanks for all your help!
