If all you want to do is upgrade graphics card...AGP is the only real choice.
It looks to me like your system has an built-in/onboard GPU.
How much system RAM do you have ?
If the door is open to other options....like a new MB and CPU to go along with the video.... the options expand dramatically.
For example ASRock has the 775Dual-VSTA which accepts DDR or DDR2, AGP or PCIe video and a multitude of Intel CPUs.
The question is what are you using the PC for mostly and how fast do you want to go ?
