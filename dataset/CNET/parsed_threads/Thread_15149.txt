<s> I am trying to find the drivers and the users manual for the Asus A8R MX/DP motherboard but cannot find it anywhere. </s>
<s> It is an OEM . </s>
<s> I desparetly need the manual to build the pc. </s>
<s> as these were provided to builders. </s>
<s> You might consider that basic drivers will be for the A8R series such as chipset, etc. </s>
<s> Other features, sound, network, etc. </s>
<s> should be available from that manufacturer. </s>
<s> You might be able to piece it together that way but a manual isn't something ASUS makes for the retail market in these cases. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> One of those that may never see a manual. </s>
<s> I don't see you give a link to this board at Asus but that's where we go first. </s>
<s> You say, &quot;OEM&quot;, just what is that? </s>
<s> Is this a Gateway, Dell system, etc.. -OR- Asus build system? </s>
<s> Either way, the vendor should provide some support in your query if it isn't that old. </s>
<s> I suggest you be 100% sure of the model# as well in order to get the right data. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> A8R MX/DP motherboard drivers and manual can be found on Asus web site under Support, Downloads, Barebones--Vintage--Vintage AH-1 </s>
<s> Thank you for the response. </s>
<s> maybe this can help you. </s>
