<s> Hi, I have upgraded the firmware for netgear-WG302 (wg302_V4_1_6.rmt),After installing the wg302_V4_1_6.rmt i am not able to browse the default page.I have tried by resetting the netgear to default by holding down the reset button for 30 seconds and also restarted the system (WINDOWS XP-SP2) in which netgear is connected by twisted-pair cable. </s>
<s> I have also configured the default static ip address as 192.168.0.210 and tried http://192.168.0.228 to browse. </s>
<s> I have tried all the way to access the netgear to set the ipaddress but the default page is not opening. </s>
