after upgrading ram to 512 from 224 on a p3 450 dell and installing xp on it the pc is slow to post, before upgrading the ram it would post within secs of turning it on, now it takes about 10 secs.
i have installed 256 of pc133(crucial) memory and 128 (unsure of the speed, doesnt say on stick), from my p3 1gig dell.
there was already a 128 pc133 (crucial) stick in the pc.
the bios shows 512 installed, is there any settings that could be changed in the bios or any other ideas?
?
