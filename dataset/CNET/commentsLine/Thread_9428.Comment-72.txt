so noisy that people on the phone believed i was drying my hair at the same time!
that fan kept my machine ice cold whatever i threw at it.
the noise didn't bother me as long as i was just using it for work (it actually helped me to concentrate by blocking all other noises of the house and outdoors!)
but when i started to use it for other things, i ended up putting the base unit into the attic next door.
sadly, my new mobo cannot take the ''jet engine'' any more and i have a stock fan that came with my amd processor (it's still noisy).
not everyone has an attic only a few feet from the computer but maybe you'll find a large cupboard (need space around for ventilation!)
will do, just drill holes at the back for cables - or you could put the base unit outside the room while recording.
not an ideal solution, i know, but it's cheap way of doing it untill you can afford the more expenive hardware solution.
maybe you have a creative streak and mod your pc into an cool looking case that keeps the components cool and blocks out noise while allowing easy access to the drives and ports.
i saw a picture of a certain famous space ship shaped computer, all included but i don't know how practical it was - certainly the radio controlled car and pc combo i saw on one website (or was it on even telly?)
didn't seem a good idea.
