i just managed to get my pc to turn on after i got thing wrong with the risers.
however, i still have problems.
when the pc switches on, the fans go on and light up, but i get no monitor output.
oddly my hdd doesent work, but if you take the ide ribbon out of the hdd, it works ??
?, i tried a really old hdd and it worked with the ide ribbon in but still no monitor output, no beeps to say anything is wrong, what going on?
