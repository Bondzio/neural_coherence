The monitor only has those two hookups and my computer only has DVI-D. I bought a DVI-D to HDMI converter and it doesn't really work sometimes. When I start the computer, the signal is inactive. I turn off my computer and try connecting to my previous monitor that had a DVI-D hookup. The signal is there. Then I hookup the conveter to the HP, and the signal is there. What's up with this?

My configuration is this: Computer(GFX card w/ dual DVI-D ports) &gt; DVI-D to HDMI converter &gt; HDMI cable to monitor Please help me solve this problem, thanks! I'm thinking this could be a driver issue, or the hardware isn't right. Is there anything I could buy (&lt;$50 if possible) other than a new graphics card or motherboard that can give my computer a VGA or HDMI input?

Proffitt	9/11/08 5:39 AM	1.22111154E12	Since	You don't want to replace any component or card let's look at the failure mode. &quot;Basically when I restart my computer or stand by for long periods, the monitor fails to communicate with my computer.&quot; For now, don't restart or stand by until you get a proper card. Maybe its a driver but nothing suggests this is anything more than wishful thinking. Sometimes you find owners that insist &quot;this should work&quot; but there is no support to be found and the choices are clear. Bob
