<s> I just got a new computer and my roommate has another computer. </s>
<s> I had to set the new computer up last night when I go to my network to manage it the network is in my roommates name now and it says I have not been invited to manage the network. </s>
<s> How does he do that? </s>
<s> I have HP Vista, he has a Dell XP. </s>
<s> We both are using McAfee and that program is telling me I have to get his permission. </s>
<s> I do not know how the network is in his name now and why I have to be invited to manage it. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> If all you have are two PCs connected, it's likely just peer-to-peer and there is no network manager. </s>
<s> You will have administrative and possibly limited accounts on the individual computers and, perhaps, some sharing of folder and/or printers between the two. </s>
<s> If you set up your own computer, you likely used an administrator account. </s>
<s> But, you cannot access your roommate's PC without some additional configuration. </s>
<s> I can only imagine the McAfee message might be from trying to do a network scan rather than files/folders on your own PC. </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
<s> It is really confusing because my HP network sharing center has the network in my name and the McAfee has it in his name. </s>
<s> I also wanted to ask this, The network is stating it is public. </s>
<s> Should I make it private or keep it public? </s>
<s> It is only me and his laptop a desktop and the printer we share and a Roku device. </s>
<s> And I am not going to Starbucks any time soon to use my computer. </s>
<s> The network will be the collection of attached hardware (wired or wireless) and &quot;the McAfee&quot; will be a piece of software that resides on one or more PCs. </s>
<s> If your roommate installed a piece of software such as a McAfee product on your PC using an account other than yours and didn't make it accessible by all users, this could be your problem. </s>
<s> Is this what you are seeing? </s>
<s> Actually the McAfee comes with my ATT DSL so I really am trying to figure out how it is showing it is his network if the McAfee was downloaded under my account. </s>
<s> He is a sub account. </s>
<s> Then whoever pays the bill for the DSL owns that account. </s>
<s> If your roommates username/password was used to access the download site, that could be related to the problem. </s>
<s> If you pay the bill, that's a different matter. </s>
<s> This is beginning to sound like an issue you'll need to take up with your ISP if it's just related to software they offer with a subscription to their service. </s>
<s> Sorry...can't help in that regard. </s>
<s> It sounds as if your problem is with the McAfee program that's offered with an AT&T account. </s>
<s> I can't know but perhaps it's an add in to their own browser. </s>
<s> If it's causing you more problems than it's value to you, I'd suggest removing it and getting another free AV program. </s>
<s> Some AV and internet security software, if installed using its defaults, is quite intrusive. </s>
<s> There should be no reason it should interfere with local network management by PC owners. </s>
<s> Perhaps you're just dealing with a firewall that you don't have adequate privileges to take down. </s>
<s> You need a firewall and an AV program. </s>
<s> I presume you have a router. </s>
<s> That offers some protection from peering eyes. </s>
<s> You might do well to consider using Avast or free AVG instead of McAfee. </s>
<s> I pay the bill and it is in my name. </s>
<s> I am going to call them tomorrow and ask what the heck is going on. </s>
<s> I have a feeling though that AT&T is going to send me the 2nd level internet support that I have to pay for, which I refuse to do. </s>
<s> They send me there just to configure my email for my browser. </s>
<s> Thanks for your responses. </s>
<s> Oh another thing should I have my network set at Public or Private. </s>
<s> the Vista help files on the subject to see what scenario fits your needs. </s>
<s> From the little I know, the terms seem to be backwards. </s>
<s> If you want to share on the local network, it's private. </s>
<s> If no sharing, it's public....at least that's what I've read. </s>
<s> It makes no sense to me either. </s>
<s> I want to thanks everyone for helping. </s>
<s> I think we are going to both uninstall the McAfee. </s>
<s> It really is very intrusive. </s>
<s> It looks like every time one of us gets a update we lose the internet connection. </s>
<s> The network is fine though. </s>
<s> Very strange. </s>
