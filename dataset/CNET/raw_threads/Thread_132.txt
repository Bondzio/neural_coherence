I am planing to buy an external hard disk of 500 GB. I am from India and my budget is at most Rupees 4000. I am not inclined towards any brands. I've heard the pioneers in this segment are Seagate, Western Digital, Transcend and Buffalo and these are usually common here. I've heard there are subtypes like portable, go-flex, backup plus and maybe more. I can understand portable but don't know what the latter ones mean. Please give and insight on that. I own a Dell XPS 15 with configuration as follows : Intel Core i3 2.2 GHz processor 500 GB Hard Drive 4 GB RAM I need to keep moving most of the time so I would prefer a portable external hard disk with great transfer speed. And I prefer USB 3.0 compatible drives only. Is that a right thing to do ? Keeping above mentioned aspects in mind suggest me some good external hard drives. I am not a frequent buyer so I would like it to last for some couple of years. Thank you for helping in advance

Otherwise external usb3 Hdd. won't give you much advantages. But if the price were the same then usb3 is the one to get. I have just picked up a 750G tanscend (Storejet 25M3) for $70 U.S. on sale. I am pretty sure you might be able to get a 500G at that price that's not on sale. Good luck.
