You probably have this covered, but just to make sure: Latest router firmware Latest network adapter driver (reinstall if latest) Latest network adapter adapter firmware (if upgradeable, usually pc card adapters)?
Adapter sleep/power save mode is disabled?
DHCP client lease time set in router or none?
What network adapter model?
