Recently I've noticed that I would get no sound out of the right speaker when using headphones. To solve this I would have to pull out one of the audio plugs connecting the desktop speakers to the back of the motherboard and plug it back in for it to work. Is this the beginning of th end of the on board sound? Should I start looking for a sound card? Or can I fix this? Thanks
