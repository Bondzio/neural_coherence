1.1.1	What I would like to know is what Mac users and PC users alike belive is going to happen if Apple retakes the entire , or a good percentage of the PC market .	St
1.1.2	Let 's face it in these troubled times that Microsoft is having Apple is branching out and it 's market share , and user popularity is increasing .	St
1.1.3	Let 's assume that this momentum will continue , but let 's also add that the sale of Apple 's market will increase expedentually every year , to the equation .	St
1.1.4	Essentially what I am doing is speeding up a process that may take years , for this hypothetical situation .	St
1.1.5	So with Apple shares increasing so much every year , let 's assume they retake control of the PC market .	St
1.1.6	My question is what happens to the devoted geeks like myself who build their hardware .	St
1.1.7	Their desktops , and laptops ( which will continue to become more open in coming years ) and who take pride in what they built .	St
1.1.8	Who take pride in knowing every in and out of their system if something were to go wrong .	St
1.1.9	And for the fun of it let 's assume that these users do not want to use a distro of Linux .	St
1.1.10	What Happens ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	On the Apple I have a full command line and it 's more powerful than the Windows command console .	St
1.2.2	Is this a step backwards ?	Ques
1.2.3	( no . )	Res
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Pardon me but I do n't see your point , excatly .	St
1.3.2	What does your statement have to do with the future of computer enthusiasts who build their system if Apple was to retake the market ?	Ques
1.4.1	Look at the SBC market .	St
1.4.2	Even I have a few of those .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I am talking about a normal construct , ATX motherboard , ATX chassis , etc.. What operating system would it utilize ?	Ques
1.6.1	Microsoft did n't obliterate Apple , Linux or vice versa .	St
1.6.2	Even SUN is still out there and runs on your setup .	St
1.6.3	I 'm sure there is some doom sayer that says the end of the ( PC ) world is neigh .	St
1.6.4	Your choice to buy into that .	St
1.6.5	I do n't .	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	Would n't users want to run the most widely used OS , which would be Mac OS .	St
1.8.1	Lots of people build kit cars - and they continue to do so .	St
1.8.2	Just because auto manufacturers out there dominate that industry does not mean the car-geeks go away .	St
1.8.3	Lots of people make musical instruments - and they can continue to do so .	St
1.8.4	Just because electronically produced music is out there does not mean the musician-geeks go away .	St
1.8.5	Lots of people have home gardens - and they can continue to do so .	St
1.8.6	Just because big agribusiness is out there does not mean home-grown fruits and vegetables and herbs and spices go away .	St
1.8.7	Why is it that it has to be an & quot ; all or nothing & quot ; ?	Ques
1.8.8	Why ca n't the folks you labeled as the geeks learn something new ?	Ques
1.8.9	Actually , it is much more fun and productive to support useful applications ...	St
1.8.10	I spent many years supporting Mac OS and Windows and the applications that run on them ...	St
1.8.11	I actually advocate a multi-OS , diverse , ecosystem in the enterprise ( and at home ) because of inherent survivability ( one is attacked - the other keeps working until the first is repaired and back running ) .	St
1.9.1	I agree with you 100 percent about having a multi OS enviroment , something that is hard to invision .	St
1.9.2	Personally I feel that in a Multi OS competetive world the users win .	St
1.9.3	Because the companys are rolling out ground breaking technologies and they are doing it quickly , bringing the overall technological level of society up .	St
1.9.4	As for this posting I was trying to set up a hypethetical situation in which an Apple ruled market existed .	St
1.9.5	This is primarily for common knowledge .	St
1.9.6	I wanted to just see what others thought the outcome or the course of action would be for people like myself who build systems .	St
1.9.7	What OS would they use ?	Ques
1.9.8	My last point is that you seemed to be angry about the comment about geeks .	St
1.9.9	Please I meant nothing by that , after years of being called a geek I am proud to be called that .	St
1.10.1	a group of self-professed geeks , I am certainly not going to be angry about being called a geek ... though biting the heads off chickens tends to get feathers stuck in my teeth .	St
1.10.2	If I came off sounding irritated , that was certainly not my goal .	St
1.10.3	I , like you , am rather proud of the label .	St
1.10.4	It came with many years of training and learning .	St
1.10.5	+++++++++++++++++ So you build systems ... Why ca n't you continue to build systems ?	Ques
1.10.6	If it happens to be a traditional Windows OS based machine , then build it like you have always doe ...	St
1.10.7	If , however , a client decides they want MacOS ...	St
1.10.8	So ... build the system ... Buy the Mac , and take all the parts out , have a really cool custom case and put the Apple parts in there ... add RAM , add hard drives , add optical drives , add FireWire ports ... build the system .	St
1.10.9	Lots of people trick their Macs out by replacing cases , doing vehicle installations ... there 's lots to do with customizing Macs - contrary to popular belief ... http : //www.theapplecollection.com/iMac/Pika.html http : //www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/MacAquarium/index.shtml http : //www.prweb.com/releases/2005/1/prweb197110.htm http : //www.macvroom.com/Macd-Ride-Jeepintosh-2005-Jeep-Grand-Cherokee There 's lots more out there - but you get the idea ... And of course , since Mac OSX is based on UNIX , you *could* go THAT route ... so hardware and software opportunities abound .	St
1.11.1	This is a good question for discussion but I do n't see that it will ever happen .	St
1.11.2	Today in an article about Windows Vista it stated that Windows was the OS in 93 % of PCs today .	St
1.11.3	That leaves 7 % for Apple , Unix and Linux to share .	St
1.11.4	I ca n't see that any of them have a chance of gaining any kind of dominance over Windows .	St
1.11.5	I 'm not exactly a friend of Microsoft but considering their overwhelming lead and the way they play hard ball to squash any competition I ca n't see any change in the near future .	St
1.11.6	I suspect that the only reason they allow all the others to exist as a deterance to regulation as a monopoly .	St
1.11.7	Anyway , back to the original question .	St
1.11.8	It would be a bad day for geeks as Apple has a history of being very closed to external add-ons and internal upgrades .	St
1.11.9	Their software may be user-friendly but their systems are n't .	St
1.11.10	As a couple of examples - have you ever tried to add memory to an Apple IIc ?	Ques
1.11.11	Or look at the new iPhone - soldered in battery !	St
1.11.12	My preference would be Linux - or at least the ideals it is based on but there is no way that will ever happen .	St
1.12.1	The problem with reading articles is that the writer does not usually take the time to do any meaningful research when it comes to writing about the & quot ; numbers & quot ; .	St
1.12.2	While Windows may be the most popular platform out there , the 93 % number has been drawn from a hat , or some other place .	St
1.12.3	Usually this statement , & quot ; Windows is the OS in 93 % of PC 's & quot ; is a mixture of data and not a true representation.. For instance , Windows runs a variety of Cash Registers , ATM 's , Cell Phones , Traffic Signals and a bunch of other things and ALL of those are counted as being on the Windows platform .	St
1.12.4	They also form part of the percentage number .	St
1.12.5	Strictly speaking though , those ATM 's , etc. , are not what the general public would regard as a PC .	St
1.12.6	That makes the statement , inaccurate .	St
1.12.7	The other number you see a lot is the & quot ; market share & quot ; figure .	St
1.12.8	Apple is currently around 6 % ( ish ) of the market share but this number is based on units sold during the reporting period .	St
1.12.9	It has nothing to do with the existing machines out there .	St
1.12.10	I note that you only mention Apple , Unix and Linux as operating systems that run on what we understand as a PC .	St
1.12.11	There are many more than this so , if the 6 % figure is to be believed , the remainder of the OS 's only have 4 % to share .	St
1.12.12	Does n't seem quite right .	St
1.12.13	Speaking of counting , as the iPhone is powered by OS X , will you be counting all those iPhones that have been sold since the release , as part of the Apple market share ?	Ques
1.12.14	If the rumored OS X powered iPod ever arrives and iPods continue to sell at the rate they are , the & quot ; numbers & quot ; could swing very close to the original question .	St
1.12.15	Maybe the iPhone batteries will be User replaceable in the next series .	St
1.12.16	I do n't recall Apple ever being & quot ; closed & quot ; to external add-ons .	St
1.12.17	I have had external devices hooked to my Mac 's since the Apple ] [ .	St
1.12.18	You may be attributing manufactures unwillingness to produce peripherals for more than one platform to that statement .	St
1.12.19	As for the IIc , yep .	Res
1.12.20	Been there , done that .	St
1.12.21	But why bother bringing up at 20+ year old machine as part of a post dealing with this millennium ?	Ques
1.12.22	I 've no doubt that Apple 's OS will continue to make strides and gain a larger percentage of installed bases , but I do n't think I would want to see Apple as being the majority platform .	St
1.12.23	You only have to look at MS to see what happens to a company that reaches that point .	St
1.12.24	P	St
1.13.1	& quot ; Apple has a history of being very closed to external add-ons and internal upgrades. & quot ; Let 's go back in time .	St
1.13.2	External add-ons ...	St
1.13.3	I suppose this needs a bit of definition , but I 'll give it a try ... Networking ?	Ques
1.13.4	Got it ... LocalTalk ( from the old days ) and ethernet and bluetooth and USB and FireWire and TCP/IP and AppleTalk ... and serial and parallel ( long ago ) .	St
1.13.5	External drives ?	Ques
1.13.6	Got it .	St
1.13.7	Parallel , SCSI ( also from the old days ) , USB and FireWire .	St
1.13.8	From Western Digital , Maxtor , Seagate ... SATA ... whatever ... LaCie , Iomega , optical drives , hard drives , tape ... Peripherals from third parties : Got it .	St
1.13.9	Printers and scanners and monitors and graphics tablets and mice and keyboards and wireless stuff ... HP , Canon , Kensington , the list is endless ... For a little over year or so ( only because the camera was manufactured in 2005 ) , I have been able to capture 1080i video on my Sony HDR-HC1 ( at the time the & quot ; world 's first consumer high-definition CMOS camcorder http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_HDR-HC1 ) , import high-definition video to a ( now ) 3 year old G4 laptop ( using FireWire ) , edit that footage and playback ( using the laptop ) to a Panasonic HDTV via the TVs computer port ... Before that , as standard definition was all that was available , I was able to connect a Canon camcorder in place of the HC1 ... 15 years ago I thought it would be funny to use a Compaq CRT to a PowerMac ... & quot ; How come your Compaq monitor has MacOS ? & quot ; & quot ; ... uh ... because it is connected to a PowerMac. & quot ; & quot ; How did you do that ?	Ques
1.13.10	Macs ca n't connect to anything else. & quot ; & quot ; With a $ 7 video adapter ... & quot ; 15 years ago , we used networked HP laser printers ; Fiery front-end print servers to Kodak color copier/printers and serial-connected external modems for dial-up connectivity , Shiva LANRover remote access , and Wacom graphics tablets that use the AppleDesktop bus ... and shared all the infrastructure of connecting my company 's 13 office network into a global telecom manufacturer 's enterprise network through hubs and routers and switches ... and Novell and Windows NT file servers among other shared-environment items ... From my experience , Apple Macintoshes have been just as & quot ; closed to external add-ons and internal upgrades & quot ; as traditional Windows machines .	St
1.13.11	Were there - and are there - occasions when Macs could/can not do things the Windows machines *could* do ?	Ques
1.13.12	Yes .	St
1.13.13	Just as there were/are occasions that Windows machines could/can not do some things Macs can do .	St
1.13.14	More recently , we can boot a Mac with MacOS or Windows ... but I can not do that with a traditional Windows machine ... so ... which one is & quot ; not open & quot ; ?	Ques
1.13.15	Are there MORE add-ons for the traditional Windows environment ?	Ques
1.13.16	Sure - but they are not necessarily all good to do ... As with cars , just because there is an add-on does not mean it is a good thing to do ... and , as with cars or any other environment where there are multiple competitive manufacturers making the same thing , many parts are not interchangable - but that does not make a Cadillac a bad car because I ca n't use many of its parts on a Scion ( or vice-versa ) ...	St
1.13.17	When I look at the list of & quot ; options & quot ; on higher-end autos , it 's typically pretty short - but that does not make them bad cars ...	St
1.14.1	& quot ; When I look at the list of & quot ; options & quot ; on higher-end autos , it 's typically pretty short - but that does not make them bad cars ... & quot ; You 're quite right , it usually means that all those add-ons are already installed as standard .	St
1.14.2	Hey , it 's raining down here again .	St
1.14.3	P	St
1.15.1	Yes I agree with that as well .	Res
1.15.2	But I am not concerned with Apple taking over the market , this is not going to happen , Windows will remain the majority OS .	St
1.15.3	The question was just a what if .	St
1.15.4	Personally I think the real problem is that Microsoft has to begin moving again on the PC .	St
1.15.5	They are churning out products and advancements all over the place and most of them are on the server/enterprise side , they need to get their PC team working again , they are getting lazy .	St
1.16.1	... MS needs to get all the bugs worked out of Vista first .	St
1.16.2	Then they can worry about adding to the windows application world .	St
1.16.3	I myself , hope that apple never becomes the dominant OS in the market place .	St
1.16.4	Being hungry leads to a desire to innovate and let 's face it , apple may not always hit a home run every time but they tend to keep everyone else 's imagination fired up .	St
1.17.1	First , Apple will never take over the business world , where up to 75 % of computers are used , because businesses need more choice than one vendor of hardware .	St
1.17.2	It 'd be like Mercedes becoming the standard for commuters all over the world ; great cars but people would want more variety .	St
1.17.3	Says nothing bad about the maker , just that choice is what drives purchases in people .	St
1.17.4	Second , Apple ( and other makers ) are selling far more laptops than desktops now , and that is where their sales growth comes from .	St
1.17.5	Desktop sales are flat or declining and have been for more than 3 years now .	St
1.17.6	And as you know , laptops are hardly customizable outside of the factory order .	St
1.17.7	Aside from that , the one thing geeks wo n't be able to tweak to their hearts ' content in Apple systems is the CPU/motherboard , because Apple buys/makes custom hardware for their machines .	St
1.17.8	Most everything else is configurable , from RAM to drives to video/sound processors .	St
1.17.9	Needless to say , the dearth of Apple-compatible high-end video cards is due to their small market share ; if your prediction came true , there 'd be top-end gaming cards from all the makers -- the lack of which seems to be the # 1 gripe from the PC geek crowd .	St
1.17.10	So I 'd say that if Apple became dominent in desktop sales -- Woot !	St
1.17.11	Go Apple !	St
1.17.12	-- you 'd be able to go your merry geek way just as you do now .	St
1.17.13	Customize any Mac machine with faster GPU , more RAM , audio in/out , video co-processors , RAID , optical and hard drives , fans , utilities , tweak fan speeds , buy better speakers , add peripherals ... you name it .	St
1.17.14	Oh , and run OS-X ( or whatever it is by then ... ) .	St
1.17.15	And if their market share improved that much , perhaps they 'd license to AMD as well as Intel and you could replace CPUs too ... who knows ?	Ques
1.18.1	I should have mentioned that you can already upgrade from the dual-core Xeon processors in current Apple Macs to faster quad-cores , as has been reported earlier this year when the faster Intel variants were released .	St
1.18.2	So you can upgrade to faster CPUs right now !	St
1.19.1	I like a good debate and nothing beats a great debate in my passion , computers .	St
1.19.2	I mean most of us spend most of our online CNET time helping other 's find computers and answering tech service questions .	St
1.19.3	I feel that sometimes it 's good when we go at it like in this post .	St
1.19.4	I like it because I can play devil 's advocate , even though I am a Microsoft apologist ( probably a bad idea saying that in the Mac forum ) that does n't crowd my opinion , and I learn something .	St
1.19.5	Anyway the fact is that the Apple market share is never going to surpass the Windows market share .	St
1.19.6	That stands for Linux as well , Linux has been around since the early 90 's and from that point has stood as the Microsoft Windows killer .	St
1.19.7	Last time I checked Windows still runs on 95 % of the worlds computer .	St
1.19.8	And everytime a new release of Windows is launched we always experiance this turmopil time period were everyone is in between OSes which usually lasts between launch and SP1 , and the Linux foundation beigns to start their & quot ; we are going to do it this time , we are going to beat MS crap. & quot ; The difference this time is we have experianced a 6 year gap since the installment of XP .	St
1.19.9	Now Microsoft is not at total fault , yes they pushed Vista out the door not quite ready .	St
1.19.10	But I have been running Vista because to me XP was getting stale , for the last month and a half .	St
1.19.11	As an IT guy I know that , that is not good practice and that you should wait until the SP , but I was involved with the beta testing and figured I could compensate for any problems .	St
1.19.12	I so far have had no problems with Vista .	St
1.19.13	My software ran with no problem , I 'll give the benefit of the doubt and say that some programs required a little tweaking to work , but nothing major .	St
1.19.14	All my hardware minus my onboard sound card works ( company refuses to release Vista compatible drivers ) .	St
1.19.15	The sound card is supported by one of the Universal drivers MS writes in their framework , but because it is a proprietary device it refuses some of the Vista commands , in which case I have to manually terminate the commands being sent to the device and restart the device , but not Vista 's fault it 's the hardware vendor .	St
1.19.16	And that is the major two problems Vista needs some patch work which can easily be fixed with a serivce pack .	St
1.19.17	Developers need to get on the ball whether they write code for their devices or they write software .	St
1.19.18	Meaning they need to get in there and start using the new API 's like DirectX 10 .	St
1.19.19	Most importantly they need to not be stuborn and neglect those running 64-bit OSes , Microsoft and Apple both said it was time for a transistion .	St
1.19.20	When strictly comparing MS and Apple , MS said it first with XP 64 bit and now Vista , and Apple said it with OS X Leopard .	St
1.19.21	I have much more to say on the subject but I will wait for a another person to respond .	St
1.20.1	OK , I 'm glad you like playing devil 's advocate , and you are happy with Vista despite your audio problems ( due mainly to Microsoft 's digital rights management programming , by the way , not your sound card vendor ) .	St
1.20.2	Developer drivers and Vista aside , what 's this got to do with the OP 's query ?	Ques
1.20.3	I do n't see any comment about geeking on Apple hardware here .	St
1.21.1	The sound card problem I am experiancing does not have to do with the Win DRM Code .	St
1.21.2	It is strictly that the device 's firmware ie : driver was not built ot handle the Win Vista Driver Framework .	St
1.21.3	The easy solution is for the vendor to develope a Vista compatible driver .	St
1.21.4	The original post was what happens to geeks but throughout the entire post it has become a hybird question .	St
1.21.5	This is what usually happens when you deal with Microsoft and Apple .	St
1.21.6	It is both about what would happen to geeks and why it will not happen .	St
1.21.7	I was answering the latter in my response .	St
1.21.8	As far as messing around with the Apple hardware let 's look at it this way .	St
1.21.9	Let 's say in the next year or so Apple has the majority share , something I very disagree is ever going to happen .	St
1.21.10	Now what some people have suggested is that you can mess around with the Mac , you can change the case , add/remove memory , buy different Video Cards , and what not , but as you said you ca n't touch the motherboard or the Processor .	St
1.21.11	So I go to Apple and I buy an extremely overely priced overely rated Mac Pro for an easy $ 5,000 .	St
1.21.12	What the hell am I going to want to buy now to make changes to this system .	St
1.21.13	The point is that buying a system and making changes is different , then buying all your own components , and building from scratch .	St
1.21.14	And that is where Apple holds there so called stability in Mac OS .	St
1.21.15	They only need to build their software on a platform they can control , meaning there is no guessing of the hardware and it 's device controllers , it is programmed directly into a framework contained inside the Mach Kernel , because they use their own propietary hardware .	St
1.21.16	Any other hard ware you buy , comes with a sticker that says Mac edition , why ?	Ques
1.21.17	Because Apple has coded for that specific device , so the Mac OS is designed , builit , and ran on controlled hardware , that the OS has been coded to run on .	St
1.21.18	Where as in windows MS has to make their OS readily available to run on anything that any user has in that machine .	St
1.21.19	And like I said I have had no problems with Vista .	St
1.21.20	The point here is both the Apple versus Microsoft battle , and if apple takes over , why computer design and construct will never be the same .	St
1.21.21	Because apple will never release the ROM chip that sits on the motherboard that the Mach Kernerl cross checks with to make sure it is running on a Macintosh .	St
1.21.22	They will never open of their platform .	St
1.22.1	& quot ; because they use their own propietary hardware. & quot ; As far as I recall , the only hardware that is proprietary on a Mac is the Logic Board .	St
1.22.2	I would speculate that an ASUS/Megatrends/ProTech/Eagle/Insert the name of your favorite Logic board manufacturer , logic board is a proprietary piece of hardware , as is just about any other logic board out there .	St
1.22.3	Everything else that goes on that Mac board is standard equipment .	St
1.22.4	It is possible to change processors on some Mac boards , not encouraged , but possible .	St
1.22.5	It is not always possible to change processors on a PC board .	St
1.22.6	It depends on what the board was designed to support .	St
1.22.7	BTW , Apple does not code for the devices that & quot ; might & quot ; be added to one of their computers .	St
1.22.8	That is the job of the manufacturer of the device .	St
1.22.9	Obvious exceptions are USB flash drives , ZIP drives and a bunch of USB devices .	St
1.22.10	Support for these are built into the OS , as they are with XP and Vista .	St
1.22.11	Video cards need drivers on both platforms , the manufacturer produces them .	St
1.22.12	If the manufacturer has decided not to produced Mac drivers for the device , there will be no Mac logo on the box .	St
1.22.13	Likewise , if a device is only produced for the Mac , there will be no WIndows logo on the box .	St
1.22.14	The Mac logo indicates that the manufacturer has produced drives that meet the specifications laid down by Apple .	St
1.22.15	There is nothing at all to stop MS from requiring the same thing .	St
1.22.16	Apple does not restrict what you add to your computer , and if you purchase something that has the Mac logo on it , you know it is going to work .	St
1.22.17	The same can not be said for the Windows logo .	St
1.22.18	As a final aside , MS does not have & quot ; to make their OS readily available to run on anything that any user has in that machine & quot ; , they choose to do so .	St
1.22.19	They could just as easily demand that manufacturers follow a strict set of guidelines , without which the piece of equipment would not be capable of running Windows .	St
1.22.20	P	St
1.23.1	And you are saying things that are n't true besides .	St
1.23.2	First , peripheral drivers , especially sound and video card drivers , are n't Vista compatible primarily because of more restrictive DRM in Vista , and many vendors chose not to rewrite their drivers to comply , opting to sell new hardware instead than supporting older tech .	St
1.23.3	Thant 's because DRM challenges all applications and hardware to detect and deny & quot ; stolen & quot ; digital content , and if one component is n't playing along it shuts down all subsequent communication between the offending software and the system .	St
1.23.4	Second , computers from Apple 's most popular desktop segment sells for around $ 2,000 , not $ 5,000 , and are hardly overrated ; instead they are praised as being some of the most capable and bulletproof equipment available on any platform .	St
1.23.5	You can not buy anything off-the-shelf from Apple for over $ 3,500 in any case .	St
1.23.6	Only build-to-order Macs have higher price tags .	St
1.23.7	Third , once you pay $ 2,000 for your maximum-capability Mac , what do you have an itch to replace ?	Ques
1.23.8	That 's like saying & quot ; I just bought this amazing $ 4,000 Alienware PC with all the bells and whistles , but now I want to spend another $ 1,000 upgrading parts. & quot ; And $ 4,000 is pretty much the base for a high-end Alienware , Falcon Northwest , etc ; with similar components -- OK , these PCs usually have $ 200 more in RAM and a $ 500 video card , but not worth double the price of a Mac .	St
1.23.9	As is well established , even a bargain-basement Dell with similar insides costs hundreds more than a factory Apple .	St
1.23.10	Finally , aside from the video cards ( which I mentioned previously as being withheld because of market size ) and motherboard , everything you can access in the Mac can be swapped Mac-label free , from Intel CPUs to Crucial RAM , from Sony DVD-burners to Seagate drives .	St
1.23.11	You can add more USB , Firewire , IDE or SATA port cards , replace video fans , you name it .	St
1.23.12	Buy 'em anywhere , from PC stores or whatever .	St
1.23.13	Of course many of the internal components are better than 3rd-party makers can come up with ( pro-quality internal sound in/out , bluetooth and WiFi components ) so there 's no market for replacing these parts .	St
1.23.14	But if you need $ 1,000+ video processors or outboard audio processing cards , they 're available .	St
1.23.15	If your Mac still is n't junky enough to just replace after three or four years , you can upgrade nearly everything .	St
1.23.16	And while PC owners replace their machines far sooner ( in part because many non-technical owners throw up their hands and buy new PCs rather than pay to get the spyware off their old ones ) , Macs ' lifespans are far longer , which means many parts do n't NEED immediate replacement .	St
1.23.17	The discussion here mainly tracked what would happen if Apple increased its market share and whether hardware makers would increase availability of upgrade parts .	St
1.23.18	Of course they would ; vendors follow the money .	St
1.23.19	So logically , geeky home-builders would have things to play with even if they started from a pre-built framework , just as if you went to a local Frys or MicroCenter and bought a bare-bones PC then added your own upgrades .	St
1.23.20	But the dollars equation puts it more into the custom high-end factory modders ballpark where it 's tougher to justify spending the money with all you already get with your purchase .	St
1.23.21	I 'm not picking on you , if you post , have a reason and be factual .	St
1.24.1	What would it take to make a truly competitive multiplatform PC market ?	Ques
1.24.2	If people are waiting for MS to self-destruct with each release of an updated OS , they 're going to be disappointed .	St
1.24.3	MS has had their share of debacles , but they do seem to learn their lessons .	St
1.24.4	Do n't look for a repeat of the mistakes they made with Win95 or WinME .	St
1.24.5	Vista 's not as much of an improvement as it might have been , but it 's hardly the stinking turd that some had hoped it would be .	St
1.24.6	Much is made of MS 's anti-competitive behavior , but there seems to be plenty of blame to go around .	St
1.24.7	The marginal position of their competitors is as much due to their limitations as MS 's actions .	St
1.24.8	Since the Intel switch , the divide between Mac and PC is artificial .	St
1.24.9	The Hackintoshers have proved that .	St
1.24.10	What 's to prevent Apple from releasing an unrestricted version of their OS ?	Ques
1.24.11	My guess is that it would be something people would be willing to pay a little extra for , especially with Vista 's pricing scheme .	St
1.24.12	It would also require a change in the philosophy that 's been manifest at Apple ever since they pulled the PowerPC license .	St
1.24.13	But it seems the growth potential of such a move would eclipse that which exists under the closed platform approach that dominates their thinking .	St
1.24.14	Can the open source model develop a system that truly challenges the commercial OSs in the consumer market ?	Ques
1.24.15	There 's been some fine work done developing Linux desktops , but there 's still some evolution that needs to occur .	St
1.24.16	What does the Linux community need to do to finish the job and deliver the quality control , support , and applications that can break through to common users ?	Ques
1.24.17	And is the Linux community ready to confront the political decisions that are inherent in these tasks ?	Ques
1.24.18	Interesting to watch the sparring over the GPL .	St
1.25.1	The original question : & quot ; Opinion Post : What Happens to The Geeks If Apple Conquers ? & quot ; My opinion : Nothing .	St
1.25.2	They continue to do whatever they want to do .	St
1.25.3	Frankly , there are geeks that work in the the Macintosh world ... Unix world ... VMS , whatever ...	St
1.25.4	They will always be there .	St
1.25.5	Employment follows the money .	St
1.25.6	In the PC support world , the workers also follow the money .	St
1.25.7	Whether PC support , network admin , security , coding , technical writing , circuit design , whatever ... people will follow the money .	St
1.25.8	Smart people will be & quot ; there & quot ; first , but there will always be room for more geeks .	St
1.25.9	Always .	St
1.26.1	NIL	St
1.27.1	Like Vista 's DRM , which some hardware wo n't work with .	St
1.28.1	The PC Geeks will become Mac Geeks ...	St
1.29.1	ummmm ... learn to spell ?	Ques
1.30.1	Please , I spelled two words incorrectly , first off the word believe , I was typing fast and missed one key .	St
1.30.2	And secondly exponentially , well to be truthful I ca n't explain what happened there .	St
1.31.1	The thing is with Windows I am guranteed a serious geeky , technical computer experiance , if I so want .	St
1.31.2	But from the establishment of the Apple Computer , Apple has boasted at the ease of use of it 's machine .	St
1.31.3	And this is one of the biggest problems I have with Apple .	St
1.31.4	Because I do find the machines , and their technology interesting .	St
1.31.5	But I ca n't stand the closed hardware architecture , and the ammount of technical ops .	St
1.31.6	Would getting a Mac hinder my ability to do the technical operations I am so used to doing on my Windows based PC ?	Ques
1.31.7	Can I do the technical things I do with Windows on the Macintosh Platform ?	Ques
1.31.8	And I know that this question is a broad view question , but let 's consider technical in the general .	St
