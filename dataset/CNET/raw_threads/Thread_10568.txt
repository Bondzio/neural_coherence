I have goggled it and come to a conclusion NO as they have serious setbacks related to speed security etc. Whats your opinion???

That's like asking if a 5 year old is capable (enough) NOW to become president of the usa IN THE FUTURE. And why did you have to find out? Kees

And without going into the physics or designs why wouldn't I use the right tool for the job? For example I would not put the video file I need to edit on a wireless NAS. I could guess the unseasoned beginner might do that. Bob
