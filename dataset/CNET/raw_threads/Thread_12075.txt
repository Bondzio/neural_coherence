Lately I notice more and more difficulty with my own network dropping me, reducing range, etc. I already have an external omnidirectional antenna added onto my Linksys. Is there a brand of router that could be recommended with more power or a way to boost the power of my existing network? It could be my apartment building at fault but I doubt it only as things worked fine for the first few months we were here. Day by day I've seen more networks spring up. Thanks in advance - Matt

Sometimes that can help. You can also get interference from other things, cordless phones, microwaves, etc. A lot of things use the same frequency range. One way around that, is to change over to the wireless A standard (instead of the b/g). This runs on higher and less used frequencies. Of course you would have to buy a new router/wireless cards that support this standard. I have heard of people creating &quot;shields&quot; and what not, but I don't know how practical or useful that is. Perhaps some other folks will have better ideas for you.

At least not in the under 6 figure price ranges. So put your thinking cap on and make a map of your campus then put the WAPs on the map. Identify which is at what channel and then just like you do with CELLULAR TOWERS try to keep WAPs off the same channels when they are next to each other. If you planning is good you can keep it to channels 1, 5 and 11 (some use the 1, 6 and 11 combo) to help with overlaps. Bob

I've tried multiple channels to no avail. Can I assume if I'm the strongest signal on a channel occupied with other people that I'll have the least problem? Compared to being on a channel with someone else who has an equally strong signal?

There is splatter from channel 1 to 2 and so on. You'll see responses to try 1, 5 and 11. Or 1, 6 and 11. Why this is so is because it moves you far away from traffic on the other 2 channels. Bob
