i turned the machine back on this morning and it won't even boot now.
it asks me to either start windows normally or restore.
when i choose start windows normally, the window logos shows up and then it freezes.
when i choose restore, it loads the file and when it's completed, it freezes.
my guess is that it's probably a driver issue with the new drive updates that i recently installed.
am i correct?
