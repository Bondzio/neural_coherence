1.1.2	( my ipad2 with play them seemlessly ! )	St
1.1.3	that is really the reason i want to upgrade .	St
1.1.4	is a Athlon II x2 with 2 or 3gb ram going to cover my needs ?	Ques
1.1.5	what else might I want to do that this level of PC wo n't handle ?	Ques
1.1.6	a lenovo with the Athlon II x2 ( only a 180w power supply ? ? )	Ques
1.1.7	mini tower is only $ 350- from newegg it has onboard ati radeon 3000 graphics as well .	St
1.1.8	really need help !	St
1.1.9	thanks ...	Polite
1.2.1	Any of the latest offering are going to fit the bill .	St
1.2.2	They are leaps and bounds better than your current system .	St
1.2.3	But , since you seem to be budgeted , be sure you have room to grow on .	St
1.2.4	That means that any additional needs like more ram and/or drives , or pgms .	St
1.2.5	demands , etc .	St
1.2.6	will be meant by the PSU .	St
1.2.7	Those systems sold by OEM 's tend to fit only what was sold as , they fail under added stress to the PSU .	St
1.2.8	But , often work quite well with some TLC during use as is .	St
1.2.9	Continue to check several vendors as well as hi-end systems just to see what differences are present if anything else .	St
1.2.10	Remember , cheap is cheap .	St
1.2.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	i havent bought a machine for 5years so i really appreciate any advice !	St

1.3.3	or the Ati 3000 onboard video ?	Ques
1.3.4	I really like this machine but do n't want to find out it cant display my .mkv or .mp4 videos smoothly .	St
1.3.5	also is there something else out there that I might be overlooking ?	Ques
1.3.6	some things that I do n't know anything about would be : HD , blue ray , USB 3.0 , new PCI standards ... & lt ; div & gt ; thanks again !	St
1.3.7	& lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.4.1	a modest video card ?	Ques
1.4.2	How much free disk space do you have ?	Ques
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	my video card is a nvidia gforce 6200 AGP with 256mb my primary hard disk has 10-15gb free	St
1.6.1	you have but adding 1GB or 2GB of RAM might really help .	St
1.6.2	That along with enough free disk space is really important for efficient PC operation .	St
1.6.3	What 's the total disk capacity ?	Ques
1.6.4	10-15 GB free space probably is n't enough either Might check over at Crucial.com to see what additional RAM might cost .	St
1.6.5	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Sorry for late reply .	St
1.7.2	Too much has changed since your last PC purchase .	St
1.7.3	IMO , there will be no swapping over of anything worthwhile , because nothing would be compilable .	St
1.7.4	Maybe , the HD could be re-used but just about everthig eklelse is dead on an newer system because there is NO AGP , ram is DDR3 ( very common ) and faster is better as that 's the common install , it just is .	St
1.7.5	The HDs are far larger and is SATA not IDE as was in the olden days .	St
1.7.6	That 's why I mentioned , newer would fit the bill for what you seem to want to do .	St
1.7.7	I would n't hesitate in stepping-up from basic or entry level offering though but get a better PC with a little more $ .	St
1.7.8	I do suggest to check the requirements of any s/w ( pgms ) demands be meant by the new PC or h/w .	Sug
1.7.9	I think you 'll find it will do , excluding some extremes .	St
1.7.10	Be warned , basic & quot ; on-board & quot ; video is just basic but even that is better than what was available 5yrs .	St
1.7.11	ago .	St
1.7.12	If you need better , the PCI-Ex16 is the way to go .	St
1.7.13	Next , the HD is likely to be SATA , 500gb is a real sweet spot but 1Tb is n't uncommon .	St
1.7.14	The better RAM to have is DDR3 , and in use by Win 7 based OS , likely needs 4gb and having more is good , but 4gb will do fine as a starter .	St
1.7.15	As for the cpu , the AMD II class of multi-core of 2 cores will do fine but more is better .	St
1.7.16	http : //www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/processors/athlon-ii-x2/Pages/amd-athlon-ii-x2-dual-core-processors-desktop.aspx ( compare all the various AMD cpus ) tada -- -- -Willy	St
