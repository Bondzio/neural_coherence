i should have said 256kb instead of 256mb.
my error entirely.
back then i thought i was in hog heaven with that much.
the machine came with 64k and since i was programming in cobol back then i felt i needed 256k for the compiler.
i did.
but it still took 30 min.
to compile a few hundred lines of code.
thanks for the correction... 256mb.... geeeeez what was i thinking?
and life goes on... jack
