in my experience, cases that come with power supplies often times like to rip you off and give you crap.
antec i would trust, and lite-on, yeah maybe i'd trust them too.
but an alternate solution would be to buy a case without a psu, take the money you save on that, and buy a psu of your choice.
that's how i always do it.
and the 350 watts is kinda low for your hardware.
definetly go higher, it never hurts.
hehe, if you can get an xp 3000 i dont think an extra 50-60 will hurt?
then again maybe im wrong.
