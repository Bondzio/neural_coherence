<s> Just the other day I had to restart my computer after a crash while watching a movie. </s>
<s> I had to use the power button, since ctrl-alt-del didn't work. </s>
<s> When the computer booted up again, strange noises came from the harddrive, almost sounded like some sort of sci-fi raygun. </s>
<s> I've never encountered that one before, so I was wondering if anyone had any advise for me on what to do? </s>
<s> Send it for repairs, hum along with the noise, or ignore it? </s>
<s> Or something? </s>

<s> As long as there are no files you can't lose, then I'd ignore it, then replace the drive when it fails. </s>

<s> The real question is, where is the problem. </s>
<s> I constantly hear people referring to their computer as their &quot;hard drive&quot; when the hard drive is just one small thing inside a computer. </s>
<s> Is the problem actually coming from the hard drive, did you open up the case and see if the noise still happens if you unplug the power from the hard drive. </s>
<s> Usually you hear a noise from a Fan in a system, not the drive, when a hard drive starts making a lot of noise it is almost always already toast, due to a head crash, and damage to the platters. </s>
<s> When is the last time you backed up your system's data? </s>
<s> Any noice noticable coming from the HD isn't good but there's the outside chance it was trying to access a pgm/file that maybe corrupted or fragmented and doing alot more work to do so. </s>
<s> Regardless, do a backup ASAP just to be safe. </s>
<s> Goto the HD makers support website and get thier diags as that is the required process in order to proceed with any &quot;warranty&quot; returns provided you're still covered. </s>
<s> Even so, the diags themselves will readily check the HD. </s>
<s> if a problems exists, use warranty or open wallet. </s>
<s> If the problem seems to be a pgm/file(s), reload them but a good HD defrag seems to be in order anyways, just get that backup done as well. </s>
