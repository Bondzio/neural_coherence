i have been reading many pages of the forum and it seems like everyone is having problems with the usb ext hard drives.
i have a dell desktop, 512mb mem, 40 gb hard drive that is full, and win xp pro.
just wondering if anyone has had any luck buying and using a usb ext hard drive on a system similar to mine.
any answers appreciated.
