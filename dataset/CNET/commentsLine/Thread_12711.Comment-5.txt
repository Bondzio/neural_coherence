unplug it then plug it into the motherboard again.
check those jumper settings.
if there not right it wont go.
it should boot from the c: drive first not the floppy.
might need a new drive.
do the above first then find a spare and test to see if it's shot.
if it beeps see the beep codes at the manufactures web site.
these will tell you where the trouble is, maybe.
