<s> I have a lot of old vinyl and cassettes that I want to transfer to digital format on my computer. </s>
<s> Since the source of these formats are analog, and the typical line-in on a sound card is analog, I am wondering how I can best tranfer the audio data to digital. </s>
<s> My stereo receiver does not have a digital output, only inputs. </s>
<s> I guess what I am asking is for the &quot;best&quot; means to convert old format audio to digital and what hardware/software should I be looking at? </s>
<s> Particularly the sound card and the proper input to the PC for capturing the digital conversion. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> There is no quick and easy transfer. </s>
<s> It take 60 minutes to capture 60 minutes of LP or tape music. </s>
<s> You connect the source, via cable, to the &quot;Line In&quot; connector on the sound card. </s>
<s> Cable available at Radio Shack. </s>
<s> You play the LP or tape and use recording sofware on the computer to capture the music. </s>
<s> Here are two sets of instructions I found on the CNET site: http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5020869.html http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7899_7-5116211.html ... .. . </s>
<s> In addition to that simple wiring set up there is some very good software by Steinberg called &quot;Clean Up&quot; I think which is specifically designed to digitally remove the hiss and crackle associated with vinyl and tape. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> I am doing exactly what you are trying to do. </s>
<s> Transfer old LPs to my hard-drive and to CDs (I assume). </s>
<s> I guess ignorance is bliss, because I installed RealPlayer (after many annoying pop-ups, etc.) </s>
<s> and found that for $19.95 I could have (among other things) the option of recording from &quot;line-in&quot; or &quot;mic&quot; jacks on my sound card. </s>
<s> All I did then was run a cable from the &quot;phones&quot; jack on my old turntable to the &quot;line-in&quot; jack on my sound card. </s>
<s> After opening RealPlayer, I chose &quot;record from line-in or mic&quot; and followed the step-by-step procedure which was kind of intuitive. </s>
<s> With a few trial & error guesses, you will be off and running! </s>
<s> I have not found this option with Windows Media Player, and queries to MS produced no satisfactory replys except for computer generated &quot;FAQ&quot; answers. </s>
<s> If they can't be bothered, neither can I. </s>
<s> I am also recording over to cd. </s>
<s> All i did was run a cable from my stereo to my computers line in...i use the program called Sound Capture. </s>
<s> Only bad part is 60min of music takes 60min to record as said earlier. </s>
<s> www.magicsofts.com has the program and its free just like all things that are wonderful. </s>
