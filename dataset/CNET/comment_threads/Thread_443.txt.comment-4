For the price, form factor, etc... the best I could find was the UltraBlock USB write blocker... this is a USB device you plug &quot;in-line&quot; and it will write protect what ever is connected to it.
It is a Hardware Write protect, so it isn't prone to failure.
They aren't cheap...to the tune of $300 each, but being a simple &quot;in-line&quot; USB device that cannot be accidentally &quot;unwrite protected&quot;, it is worth it.
Yes, it does NOT have a switch on it... it is always in READ ONLY mode.
A big plus if your security officers are paranoid.
