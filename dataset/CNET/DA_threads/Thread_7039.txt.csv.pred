1.1.1	Would I be able to use an ATI Radeon X1300 512mb AGP graphics card with an ABIT AV8 motherboard and an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core Processor ?	Ques
1.1.2	If not , what cards would work ?	Ques
1.1.3	( I 'd mainly be using my computer for digital photography , microsoft office , and a few games )	St
1.2.1	i believe the av8 motheroard has agp slot .	St
1.3.1	... and just a search away too .	St
1.3.2	Search : abit av8 http : //www.abit-usa.com/products/mb/techspec.php ? categories=1 & model=175 Listed specification shows support for an AGP 4x/8x complaint graphics card , and Athlon 64 X2 CPU .	St
1.3.3	X1300 comparison : http : //www.tomshardware.co.uk/graphics/charts.html Places it right at the bottom in almost every game , but as long as the & quot ; few & quot ; games & quot ; are at low res , low AA/AF , and a few years old..it might ( just ) scrape through .	St
1.3.4	ATI X1600/ nV 6600GT offer far more power ( and longer game lifespan ) for a little extra outlay .	St
1.3.5	Good luck , GeeBee .	Polite
1.4.1	do n't be fooled by the 512mb into thinking this card is more than it is .	St
1.4.2	it 's an entry level card and more ram wo n't help it perform better in anything .	St
1.4.3	an x1600pro w/256mb is a better choice .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814102666 $ 120 inc. shipping	Ques
1.5.1	Thank you for your input .	St
1.5.2	I am not positive if I want to purchase that card now .	St
1.5.3	I guess I will rethink it .	St
1.5.4	Thanks again .	St
