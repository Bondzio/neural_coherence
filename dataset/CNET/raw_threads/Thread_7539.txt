OptiPlex 755 2.4 gigahertz Intel Core2 Duo 64 kilotbyte primary mem cache 80 gig hard drive 39 free MB Dell Inc. 0GM819 BIOS Dell Inc A09 03/11/2008 TSSTcorp DVD-ROM TS-H353B Optical Drive Memorx External DVD/CD (ArcSoft) burner Any other info that is helpful I can provide. OK, computer does not recognize the CD Burner on either drive. It will read from but no write to. I have used device manager to no avail. I uninstalled the DVD player twice an it did install the main driver. Still same problem. In other words, using Windows Media Player, when I add tracks to my burn bucket if you will or place where you would put in your tracks to burn them to a CD/DVD doesnt work. So how do I get my machine to recognize the burner part of the attatched drives, both internal and extenal??

Windows XP didn't have burning capability onboard, you'd have to use an aftermarket burning software to accomplish the task, Roxio, Nero and others. The external drive DVD/CDRW is going to pose the same issue, it needs software to run against. Even is the system recognizes it as a USB device it will not likely burn anything without software installed in the system.

7043	9	580026	5397182	5397160	Jetblst	12/14/12 12:10 AM	1.3554438E12	ok	Is there any diagnostic to run to see? However I am thinking its ok. As above I have a brand new Memorex external DVD burner that I think is working. It appears that the computer somehow is not recognizing either drives as burner drives.

7043	11	580026	5397519	5397182	VAPCMD	12/14/12 4:45 PM	1.3555035E12	First..the PC must recognize the CD_DVD drive(s)	no matter whether internal /external and thereafter, the system must have CD-DVD burning software to create/copy CD-DVDs. As operating systems go, XP does NOT have built in CD_DVD burning such so you must supply it. VAPCMD

I did a Pre Boot test in BIOS (Diagnostics) When the CD ROM was tested it returned a &quot;Spindle Test Failed&quot; result. Error Code: 2000-0147 So looks like it IS in fact time for new drive unless someone has a tip on how to fix that. Thanks!

Re the external...like someone else suggested might try that on another PC. R. Proffitt often mentions a registry problem referring to 'upper limits' that might be worth looking at too....there are some of those posts on CNET about that. Keep us posted how it works out. VAPCMD

At least that gives you some perspective on how actual buyers rate CD-DVD drives they bought that should be currently available. VAPCMD
