1.1.1	I had an old Maxtor 160GB one-touch Firewire/USB drive.	St
1.1.2	The hard drive died so I replaced it with a Seagate 160 and stuck it in the old Maxtor enclosure.	St
1.1.3	Now the drive will only format to 128GB.	St
1.1.4	Why should the change of drive brands matter?	St
1.1.5	Can I get this drive to format to 160?	St
1.1.6	If I pull the drive and stick it inside my PC to format it to 160 and then stick it back in the Maxtor enclosure, will that work?	St
1.2.1	And how do you format the drive?	Ques
1.2.2	Kees	St
1.3.1	It's Windows XP SP2, and I partitioned and formatted it using Windows Computer Management.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	The enclosure is a Maxtor Personal Storage 5000DV.	St
1.5.2	Not sure what the drive is without taking it apart to look, I just know it's a Seagate 160GB that is less than a year old.	St
1.5.3	I tired downloading the Seagate formatting software that says it addresses this issue but it is only for ATA/SCSI devices.	St
1.6.1	If the original HD in that enclosure was less than 137GB, then the enclosure may have a 48-bit LBA problem.	St
1.6.2	This is a limitation of the enclosure's circuitry and not the HD.	St
1.6.3	http://www.48bitlba.com Solution: Purchase an external enclosure that is specified for use with larger HD's.	St
1.6.4	* * * * * Alternatively, did you try different jumper settings on the HD?	St
1.7.1	Try MA, and then repartition and format with NTFS in Disk Management while in the enclosure.	St
1.7.2	Result?	St
1.7.3	Try CS, and then repartition and format with NTFS in Disk Management while in the enclosure.	St
1.7.4	Result?	St
1.8.1	Firewire on Windows for disk drives has been flighty at times.	St
1.8.2	Bob	St
1.9.1	Jumper is currently set to the CS position (that's what the original dead drive was set to when I removed it).	St
1.9.2	I tried using MA but the drive wouldn't even mount (the drive light just stayed on solid).	St
1.9.3	I've also tried using both the FW and USB ports.	St
1.9.4	The old dead drive was a 160 too, so I can't see why this shouldn't work.	St
1.9.5	I think I will try formatting it internally, I'm just worried it will cause data loss if I stick it back in the enclosure and it can't access the extra space on the drive.	St
1.9.6	I'll have to test it out before using it.	St
1.10.1	The drive does the same thing using USB 2.0 as FW.	St
1.11.1	Was the old drive a Maxtor?	St
1.12.1	OK, I took the drive out of the fiewire enclosure and I installed in internally on my IDE controller.	St
1.12.2	Same problem!	St
1.12.3	Since I'm already running two Maxtor 250GB drives on my XP SP2 system I know I can handle large drives, so I am stumped.	St
1.12.4	I tried the LBA registry fix anyway, it told me I didn't need it.	St
1.12.5	I tried using Seagate's Disc Wizard to format the drive, it won't parition it over 137GB either.	St
1.12.6	So where is this limitaion coming from?	St
1.13.1	OK, I took the drive out of the fiewire enclosure and I installed in internally on my IDE controller.	St
1.13.2	Same problem!	St
1.13.3	Since I'm already running two Maxtor 250GB drives on my XP SP2 system I know I can handle large drives, so I am stumped.	St
1.13.4	I tried the LBA registry fix anyway, it told me I didn't need it.	St
1.13.5	I tried using Seagate's Disc Wizard to format the drive, it won't parition it over 137GB either.	St
1.13.6	So where is this limitaion coming from?	St
1.14.1	My BIOS also sees this drive as 136GB... even though it also sees my other large drives at their full 250GB capacity.	St
1.14.2	It's a pretty new BIOS (2004), so why does it like one drive but not another?	St
1.15.1	I just updated the BIOS to the latest version (2005), and also the VIA chipset drivers.	St
1.15.2	The problem still persists, the BIOS still reports the drive as 136GB instead of 160 but sees my other large drives just fine.	St
1.16.1	And one more time (sorry I missed it) what is the exact model number so I can see if this drive has a 127GB limit feature.	St
1.16.2	Bob	St
1.17.1	it's a Seagate ST3160023A.	St
1.17.2	Seagate DiscWizard reports it as 137444 MB.	St
1.18.1	Found the following at: http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/specs/ata/st3160023a.html ''Some systems BIOS have capacity limitations.	St
1.18.2	Types that have been identified are: a 2.11GB or 4095 cylinder limitation a 3.26GB or 6322 cylinder limitation a 4.22GB or 8192 cylinder limitation a 8.45GB Standard INT13 limitation (CHS[1024x256x63]x512) a 33.8GB or 66,060,287 LBAs limitation a 137.4GB or 268,435,455 LBAs limitation (28-bit limit) and, if exceeded, may cause the system to hang during boot, capacity reduction or it can truncate or wrap the cylinders when auto-detect options set in the CMOS.	St
1.18.3	New INT13 Extensions and LBA mode in BIOS and FAT32 or NTFS-based file systems are required to acheive full capacity.	St
1.18.4	FAT32 file system can create single partitions and logical drives up to 2TB.	St
1.18.5	FULL-CAPACITY solutions include third-party drive preparation software, system BIOS update which supports LBA mode or third party bios driven host adapters.''	St
1.18.6	Based on your previous post, it would seem there is some type of incompatibility between your BIOS and this drive.	St
1.18.7	Yet, your other drives report properly.	St
1.18.8	Are those drives also Seagate or a different brand?	St
1.18.9	The issue certainly lies within the BIOS or this drive and based on Seagates own documentation, this has been seen before.	St
1.18.10	Unfortunately, a solution evades me.	St
1.18.11	It will be interesting to see what some of the recognized experts here come up with, because as of now, I am completely stumped.	St
1.18.12	The one thing I would try is to manually enter the hard drive info in the BIOS instead of allowing it to auto-detect.	St
1.18.13	Other than that, consider me clueless.	St
1.19.1	The other drives are Maxtors.	St
1.19.2	It must be something in this drive, because it has the same limitation problem in the firewire enclosure which should be independent of the BIOS.	St
1.19.3	But still, a modern system less than a year and a half old with the latest BIOS and chipset drivers should certainly be able to handle drives over 137GB under any conditions.	St
1.19.4	FWIW, my BIOS won't allow manual setting of the heads and cylinders to set the drive size, so I'm stuck.	St
1.19.5	I can manually set it to LBA but it still makes no difference.	St
1.20.1	Did you delete all partitions and create one new partition before trying to format the HD while connected as an internal?	St
1.21.1	yes, I've deleted the partitions many, many times.	St
1.22.1	you said &quot;The hard drive died so I replaced it with a Seagate 160&quot; was the seagate new/out of the box?	St
1.22.2	if not, it may have some sort of disk management program blocking access... jonah .	St
1.23.1	In these cases, I like to start fresh and totally wipeout the drive.	St
1.23.2	I use KILLDISK of the same website name(get it) and use it.	St
1.23.3	Once done, the HD has no record of anything to confuse itself.	St
1.23.4	Further, work using your system with the trouble HD by itself(alone) and unplug all others.	St
1.23.5	That way you safety deal only with that problem HD.	St
1.23.6	Here's the Seagate support website, that can further clarify any capacity issues and others.	St
1.23.7	http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/137/index.html Remove HD from firewire case and connect to your system.	St
1.23.8	Run Killdisk, once done, reboot and have XP CD(or seagate s/w) in order to format and prepare the HD.	St
1.23.9	If it still only allows 128gb storage and you have all the OS updates, etc.	St
1.23.10	to allow full capcity then the HD flat out doesn't like your system.	St
1.23.11	Find another system(friend's) and try there.	St
1.23.12	Still fails, you got a physical HD problem(it works) it just won't allow full use of the HD gb's.	St
1.23.13	However, don't expect the total 160gb be avaialbe as the OS takes some for itself(managaement).	St
1.23.14	You can try using the latest Seagate HD install s/w one more time.	St
1.23.15	If none of this works, then the HD.	St
1.23.16	As I stated above Seagate addresses issues about capacity, its just the way it is.	St
1.23.17	tada -----Willy	St
1.24.1	It's possible something got written to the drive and started this problem.	St
1.24.2	http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/specs/ata/st3160023a.html is noteworthy in a few places but since Seatools calls it a 136GB it's hard to argue with that.	St
1.24.3	Bob	St
1.25.1	Since the BIOS sees it as a 137GB disk, I don't think it has anything to do with anything ever written to the disk, or with any windows drivers or anything.	St
1.25.2	This is strictly a harware issue.	St
1.25.3	And yes, the drive was new out of the box.	St
1.26.1	That's your choice here.	St
1.26.2	http://www.48bitlba.com notes the 127GB number many times.	St
1.26.3	After all this, call it in and get the drive exchanged.	St
1.26.4	Bob	St
1.27.1	Well, looks like I'm at the end of the road here on answers.	St
1.27.2	Thanks everyone who helped out!	Polite
1.28.1	i also have this drive and had similar problems.	St
1.28.2	it works fine when i used it with windows 2000 pro, but not with xp.	St
1.28.3	the only work around i found was to use windows disk management tool to partition this remaining space.	St
1.28.4	if the space is too small, you can always create a smaller primary partition, which then increases the space for the 2nd partition Marc	St
