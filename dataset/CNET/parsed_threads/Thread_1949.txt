<s> I just recently installed the Dell 1905fp LCD monitor, and after using it for about 30 minutes or so at the 60-hertz refresh rate there is flicker. </s>
<s> At the 75-hertz refresh rate, this does not happen. </s>
<s> Dell recommended 60-hertz as &quot;optimal&quot;. </s>
<s> I tried disabling some nearby electronic devices, but that didn't work. </s>
<s> How do I correct this problem? </s>
<s> There are issues with what Windows will note as optimal, but 60 Hz is not &quot;optimal&quot;. </s>
<s> Use 75Hz. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 60-hertz and 75-hertz are the only settings this LCD supports. </s>
<s> Besides correcting flicker, what are the differences? </s>
<s> I've yet to see this as &quot;optimal&quot;. </s>
<s> You first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...that the LCD be at the native resolution and refresh rate at 60 hertz, when I press the button on the monitor that lets you change brightness, etc. </s>
<s> I see that whenever I restart my computer, I see &quot;Auto Adjust in Progress&quot;; then I see it again at the log-on screen. </s>
<s> If I don't reset the settings to factory default after the log-on screen appears, text is coarse and blurry. </s>
<s> But I don't want to have to reset all settings to factory default after every restart to get a clear picture. </s>
<s> Is there some way I can do this? </s>
<s> It's very odd and contradictary to what I've read and experienced. </s>
<s> Very strange. </s>
<s> About messages during boot and shutdown. </s>
<s> This is an area that has bothered new to PC people for over a decade. </s>
<s> Let me share that such displays were never standardised and you will indeed see such informational messages during the transitions. </s>
<s> The Apple Macintosh is better at this and some will take comfort there. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Will changing the monitor back to all factory default settings after every restart harm the monitor in any way? </s>
<s> The flicker problem on my monitor can only be resolved by increasing the refresh rate, and I've done that. </s>
<s> I'll ignore what Dell recommended as optimal. </s>
<s> The issue there was the circuity that drove the electron deflection coils could overheat and fail if you were pushing them. </s>
<s> This is not true for LCD displays. </s>
<s> This post will be my last about this issue since there is not much of an issue to chew on here. </s>
<s> Its sad that someone has misled you a little here. </s>
<s> You seem to be seeking some assurance I can't give you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hmm, well it seems that my LCD is now rid of all the problems I mentioned in the post. </s>
<s> Thank you, Bob. </s>
