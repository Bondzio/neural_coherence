Wireless Networking appears to be an access to the internet/ISP, without wires. It sounds as if rather than having an dial-up access to the internet or a DSL/Cable connection you have a reauter. I am not so sure about my above interpetation though. Because It's called wireless networking so I suppose you must have more than one computer operating off of this reuter; but dont you have to have the reuter near or in the computer (whatever a reuter is)? I guess my main question is not so much what wireless networking is...I guess I want to know how does it affect the Family PC? Is Wireless Networking replacing DSL and Cable ISP's in the home? Or is it just a business thing. Second is wireless networking just a connection to the Internet; do you still need to have an Internet Service Provider? O.K. I know you can tell that I am very knew to using computers and internet service providers. As I type I'm just switching from dial-up to cable. So please be gentle towards me &quot;A NOVICE&quot; in your answers. Thank You!

Install a wireless NIC into the desktop or laptop. You can now access the Internet via the modem using RF (Radio Frequency in the GHz bandwidth). My home network has a wireless router, D-link DI-614+. I have three desktops wired to three ports and the laptop has a wireless NIC. I can use it all over the house. I could install a wireless NIC into one of the desktops and use it in another room without running Cat-5 wire. That's it.

From your response I understand that you still need a cable or Dsl ISP. But this way you don't have to have a seperate dsl or cable modem for each computer.

Hence the name router, it routes the data to each PC. And with a router you get a pretty good firewall to block unwanted junk from hitting your PC. And with a router and more PCs you can build a little home network.
