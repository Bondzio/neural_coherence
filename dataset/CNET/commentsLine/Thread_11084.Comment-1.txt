having problems with both cdrw and dvd.
windows sees the drives in &quot;my computer&quot; but is having problem reading data or even recognizing that a cd is in the drive.
was trying to burn a cd today and got a message that an error was received from the &quot;output device&quot; (the cdrw) with the suggestion to check that the drive is installed.
does this mean to check the cables like i saw recommended in another post?
i would think that if a cable is loose or disconnected that the drive wouldn't even be recognized.
i was able to reboot once and the drive recognized data on a cd but would not burn a cd.
will also do some housecleaning inside .
thanks patti
