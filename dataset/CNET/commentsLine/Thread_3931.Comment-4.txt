i think those cards use edge cellular service.
you might want to ask your edge service provider (cingular?)
if they recommend a router for those cards.
option 1: the ''junxion box'' should get you there, but it is expensive:   option 2 (not sure about this one): you are saying that the desktop uses an edge card?
if so, i don't know if you can bridge the desktop's edge card to its wired network adapter.
if this can be done, you should be able to use windows xp's internet connection sharing (ics).
internet ~ ~ ~ (edge card) desktop (network adapter) ----- wireless router ~ ~ ~ laptop this option just requires the purchasing of an inexpensive wireless router.
again, i'm not sure about the bridging part.
