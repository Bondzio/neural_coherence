<s> Hello, hope someone can help with this My computer (Asus A7N266 VM motherboard) has worked for a year or more. </s>
<s> I installed some new software and connectd a new device to the serial port (to update the GPS database of an Origin B2). </s>
<s> The computer froze up, and all attempts at restarting freeze at the Windows 2000 logo screen, with the progress bar at zero. </s>
<s> I have tried safe mode, last good configuration and booting from floppy disc set (the 2000 CD appears to be non bootable). </s>
<s> All freeze at 'starting windows 2000'. </s>
<s> So I swapped the hard disc for one from an old computer, with windows 98. </s>
<s> This booted up, though there are some compatibility problems with the motherboard. </s>
<s> I then attempted to upgrade this old disc from 98 to 2000. </s>
<s> This appeared to be working, until it restarted and froze at the 'setup is starting windows 2000' point. </s>
<s> This disc now gives the choice of starting either 98 or 2000, but only 98 actually boots up. </s>
<s> So both hard discs stop a exactly the same point. </s>
<s> I suspect a component failure on the motherboard, but cannot think why this would only affect the 2000 boot up. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Richard </s>
<s> I found the 2000 CD non bootable as well. </s>
<s> Did you ever find an alternative? </s>
