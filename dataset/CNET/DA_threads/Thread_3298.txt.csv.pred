1.1.1	Hi, I built this machine with all new components last Semptember and it ran fine until March when the original power supply (Be Quiet Dark Matter Pro 750w) died.	St
1.1.2	A direct replacement was unavailable from the retailer so after a considerable wait they supplied a Corsair Professional HX750W instead.	St
1.1.3	When I re-assembled the machine Windows 7 would not boot or repair and after running a Seatools diagnostic found that the Barracuda 500gb 7200.11 drive had sustained some disc damage.	St
1.1.4	Fortunately I had a smaller 160gb Hitachi Deskstar in the machine so I formatted that and installed 7 to get me up and and running while I decided which drive to buy next and save up the cash.	St
1.1.5	A new WD Caviar Black 500GB WD5001AALS finally arrived and went straight in no problem, 7 installed fine and all seemed ok. After a day or so I discovered that there was some data on the old Seagate drive I hadn't backed up so hooked it up on the ESATA connection and tried to retrieve it.	St
1.1.6	I could see the files fine but every time I tried to copy them off the drive the machine switched straight off as if the power was turned off.	St
1.1.7	After a few more attempts it reached the point where it would not even make it to Windows boot before the power would cut off.	St
1.1.8	Disconnected the drive and everything returned to normal.	St
1.1.9	Tried different PSU cables and SATA cables/slots but the same results every time.	St
1.1.10	Not wanting to give that easily I tried the drive in my older machine running XP and to my surprise it worked fine, pulled off the data I needed, formatted and disc checked the drive and it's been fine in there for a few weeks now.	St
1.1.11	The new machine worked fine for a few days but then started to suffer random power offs.	St
1.1.12	I've noted a few instances that would cause power offs repeatedly; trying to install itunes it occurred 5 times during extraction of the downloaded files but then worked on the 6th attempt, connecting my mobile phone caused it numerous times using two different cables on 5 different USB ports one evening and again it would eventually power off before Windows boot until it was disconnected, I tried it the next evening and it connected fine this time but then caused power offs several times when trying to move files onto the microSD card.	St
1.1.13	I'm struggling to work out how to troubleshoot from here, I've tried all the basics; Rewired and checked all cabling, removed & inspected the RAM, updated the MB BIOS (and installed all the latest device drivers for good measure), all temperatures are good - MB & CPU 34C-36C at idle and 42C-44C at high load, GPU 50C at idle and 58C-61C at high load.	St
1.1.14	Oddly it will still run C&C 3 and Dawn of War 2 with all graphics/detail settings at full without causing a problem.	St
1.1.15	The machine currently consists of; Gigabyte GA-MA790FXT-AD5P AMD Phenom II X4 955 3.2ghz Black Edition Corsair H50 Water CPU cooler 2x Corsair CM3X2G1600C9DHX 2048mb RAM Corsair Professional HX750W modular PSU Sapphire VaporX HD4890 1024mb DDR5 RAM Antec 300 Gamer Case with top mounted Antec 3 140mm exhaust fan, side mounted Antec 3 120mm exhaust fan and two front mounted AKASA Amber 120mm inlet fans.	St
1.1.16	Sorry if I've rambled on and gone into too much detail but I'm really hoping one of you can point me in the right direction from here.	St
1.1.17	Regards Mike	St
1.2.1	as I see it.	St
1.2.2	1) If you're using a surge protection bar (power strip); there might be a problem with the power bar, causing it to trip.	St
1.2.3	If you're not using a surge protector, why not?	St
1.2.4	2) Check the motherboard for Bad Caps; even new boards suffer from this fate http://www.badcaps.net/ 3) Last possible reason for shutdowns; bad CPU, might be that you have to RMA this to see if this is the culprit.	St
