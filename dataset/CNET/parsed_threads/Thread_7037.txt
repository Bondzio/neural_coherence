<s> I am interested in subscribing to a for-hire VPN service that allows me to safely surf the net at HotSpots. </s>
<s> I've looked into the services offered by WiTopia.net and HotSpotVPN.com. </s>
<s> Does anyone have opinions about either of these services, or suggestions about one that works for them? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> That's not right. </s>
<s> How could this be? </s>
<s> Have them explain it. </s>
<s> I'm not buying this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 30 day moneyback guarantee and under a current promo it's only $39.50 a year. </s>
<s> Witopia and the others only offer 128bit encryption. </s>
<s> HotSpotVPN offers up to 256bit AES encryption. </s>
<s> HotSpotVPN works with Macs, the others do not. </s>
<s> HotSpotVPN's is also easier to install (30 seconds, max). </s>
<s> There areno forms to fill out and no certificates requests to exchange after the purchase. </s>
<s> HotSpotVPN is also much more flexible with email. </s>
<s> You are painted into a corner with the others. </s>
<s> witopia's personalVPN works great with Macs. </s>
<s> My setup experience with hotspotvpn wasn't that smooth. </s>
<s> perhaps they've changed things or you're talking about their old pptp service?? </s>
<s> certificates are a GOOD thing and hotspotvpn uses them..just incorrectly..they load both the public and private key on your machine together instead of keeping one secured... YIKES. </s>
<s> not sure what you mean about email..personalVPN works with any and all applications and mail packages as far as I know. </s>
<s> actually..they both are based on openVPN, so ultimately, it's the same service, but hotspotvpn is about 3 times the price! </s>
<s> and even more expensive if you want the 256bit encryption that you don't really need. </s>
<s> also, why do they charge more for higher encryption..how does that cost them more or is it a sales gimmick? </s>
