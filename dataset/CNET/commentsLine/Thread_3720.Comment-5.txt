if this is a new laptop, use the warranty.
however, you may have voided the warranty, depends.
if this is used and can return it as it wasn't stated having that problem, if possible.
because, this is a laptop, a repair from a proper shop maybe the only cure.
other than a hd swap, could you begin suspect something else.
your options become very limited as user repair.
i have laptop adapter/kit to see if the hd works elsewhere.
you can use usb ext.
case as well to check out hd.
