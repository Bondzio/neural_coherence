1.1.1	I have just bought an external hard disk (Philips 250GB SPD5110CC) ostensibly for backups.	St
1.1.2	But I'm wondering if there's any reason I can't use it as a 'main' disk (not for Windows itself, of course).	St
1.1.3	Any thoughts?	St
1.1.4	Thanks, Chalkbel.	St
1.2.1	The drive even on USB 2.0 is 1/2 to less the speed of internal drives and prone to vanishing.	St
1.2.2	Read http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=28919&messageID=328179 It is a fine copy, but fails on too many points for real backup.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Once the ext.	St
1.3.2	HD is attached, its resources are available.	St
1.3.3	However continued use in such a matter defeats the purpose of a &quot;back-up HD&quot; since it no longer is as safe as it can be.	St
1.3.4	You expose it to any malware threat and possibility power problems or any other system problem.	St
1.3.5	In its simplest terms a back-up HD stores related data to be used later if and when needed.	St
1.3.6	You can partition the ext.	St
1.3.7	HD and place important data in a partition, then use the other partion as necessary, but again you comprise it should anything happen to the ext.	St
1.3.8	HD itself.	St
1.3.9	If you read the threads here, problems crop-up to ext.	St
1.3.10	attached devices, HDs or not, so its not an invalid caution to safeguard as best as possible.	St
1.3.11	Of course do what you need to do.	St
1.3.12	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	Thanks, Bob & Willy, I think the answer is No!	St
1.4.2	It's OK - I was just wondering, but that's a clear indication from you both as to the way I should go.	St
1.4.3	I have plenty of HDD space, so no problem.	St
1.4.4	Thanks, Chalkbel.	St
