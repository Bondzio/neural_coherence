<s> I just bought a Seagate 750GB Freeagent External HD, w/USB, Firewire, and most importantly eSata connections. </s>
<s> (Model # ST307504FPA1E3-RK) I wanted to get it going immediately, and living in NYC I also bought the only PCI-X card I could find from Tekserve, a Lacie Sata II 3Gb/s PCI-X Card 4E I installed the card and driver on my Powermac G5 Dual 2.0, (10.4.10), and although System Profiler recognizes the card on the PCI bus, it will not recognize the drive through the Esata connection. </s>
<s> I tried all four of the ports, and nothing. </s>
<s> Disk utility shows nothing there. </s>
<s> The G5 does recognize the drive through the USB 2.0 connection. </s>
<s> I don't know whether this card is compatible or not, and I can't find any information on what would be online. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can get the eSata to work? </s>
<s> Much obliged. </s>
<s> Assuming that you have the required eSATA cable and that the PCI-X card is installed correctly, and you have tried another PCI-X slot, my next move would be to call La Cie Tech Support to find out why this did not work for you. </s>
<s> A Google of the PCI-X card turns up a number of hits but all are related to a La Cie RAID system and not about the card itself. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> And that is exactly what I did. </s>
<s> I called Lacie tech support, and they had me install the latest driver from their site, (as opposed to the driver that came on the disc with the card), and Voila, the Seagate appeared on my desktop! </s>
<s> So, I am good to go. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your reply. </s>
<s> Sincerely, Richard </s>

<s> I also called LaCie and they don't give drivers for Mac. </s>
<s> So... please clarify. </s>
<s> Do you have a Mac or a PC? </s>
<s> If you have the solution, a lot of people out there would love to get the solution. </s>
<s> The original poster had purchased a Lacie Sata II 3Gb/s PCI-X Card 4E for his PowerMac G5. </s>
<s> On their products page, for this card, it states that Mac drivers are not required for this device, which is a little confusing. </s>
<s> LaCie have posted drivers for OS X on their download page Here and these may be the drivers that the poster was referring to. </s>
<s> If you called LaCie with the same problem, on the same card, after January 07, then LaCie was not altogether truthful with you. </s>
<s> They updated the driver for OS X (10.4) so that it would load on Intel or PPC Macs. </s>
<s> Hope this helps P </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> However, I have the LaCie PCI eSATA card. </s>
<s> I am going to just return it. </s>
<s> I down graded back to Tiger and its not even showing up on the System Profiler anymore. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help though. </s>
