hi all.
i built my pc a few year or so ago, and i'm considering putting some more ram in.
i already have 2x2gb of 1600 ddr3 in my foxconn x48 motherboard, buut i'm not sure if i should be worried about compatibility issues between the new sticks and the existing ones.
i've read mixed answers from &quot;throw any type in, as long as it fits in your mobo&quot; to &quot;if they have different timings your mobo could get fried.&quot; so i figured i'd ask around.
ram:  motherboard:  thank a bunch.
