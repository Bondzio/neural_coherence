there's no need or significant benefit to reversing the hs fan airflow in most cases.
think i said that about 10 posts back but who's counting.
and since you brought up opinions of 'experts', someone needed to address the misinformation that as fortune would have it, the original poster tested and proved wrong.
regarding 'damage the processor or the whole cpu if he tries to change his fan's position when the motherboard doesn't allow it' ....there's not many cases where changing the fan position or direction would damage either the processor or the cpu.. it just isn't a pass - fail, run - not run, difference.
no need to cause undo alarm or more confusion here.
