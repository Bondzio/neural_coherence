hi, i picked up this monitor from a local goodwill for about $20.
it didn't have a power supply, so i ordered a replacement (not from hp, from another vendor).
the one i got is rated at 12v, 5a, and it worked fine.
but after a day, i discovered the backlight power failure issue that apparently plagues these monitors.
discovered the thread here, and though most of the solutions pointed to problems in hp's power supply, i wanted to see if anyone has a suggestion if i'm using a new, non-hp power supply.
thanks!
