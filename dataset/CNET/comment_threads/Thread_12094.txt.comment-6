I only used google to see what ports your machine has and wasn't happy with the sites I read so I couldn't tell if it was USB 2.0 or not.
-&gt; I may have missed what OS you have on there, but there are USB 2.0 issues in XP SP1 or less.
Also, for XP we use a Drive or Disk Management tool noted in Start Help and Support to prepare the drive for use.
Try that and see if the drive is listed there.
If you are trying to save files from the drive, try another machine.
