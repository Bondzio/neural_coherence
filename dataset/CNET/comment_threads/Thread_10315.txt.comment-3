flashing the BIOS from Windows.
Does yours???
Different subject.
Why do you NEED to flash the BIOS.
All MFR's say to NOT flash the BIOS unless you need the later version BIOS to correct a problem that the earlier BIOS had as a fault.
With a system that can't even read a floppy correctly you may be skating on thin ice.
