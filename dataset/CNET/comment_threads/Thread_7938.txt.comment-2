I would expect such an overtaxed power supply to show many such issues.
That alone may or may not be your issue.
Other issues are: 1.
BIOS.
Latest only or suffer.
2.
Some other item in the brew.
I once found a bad USB device that stopped the reboot.
Hitting reset was the final workaround since a) it worked, b) cheap fix.
