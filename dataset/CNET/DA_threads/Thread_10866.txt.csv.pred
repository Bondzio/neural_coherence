1.1.1	I have created a workgroup for my two laptops which run Windows XP Home .	St
1.1.2	I can see whatever it is I want to share on each of the computers .	St

1.2.1	unsaid and can not be fully answered until the details or your two node network are revealed .	St
1.2.2	Router/wired/wireless/security enabled are all needed info .	St
1.3.1	I am using a wireless router for my interenet connection to both computers which is unsecured .	St
1.4.1	In which case your workgroup will be exposed when not protected by WEP/WPA and or MAC filtering .	St
1.4.2	You may wish to disable SSID broadcasting and change the default name and password of the router .	St
1.5.1	My router is password protected but the ssid is not & quot ; protected & quot ; is that ok ?	Ques
1.6.1	turned on or off .	St
1.6.2	I 've found that MAC filtering is usually enough in most home environments since many will trip over WEP/WPA encryption .	St
1.7.1	it is enabled WEP is an Open system and it says WEP is disabled .	St
1.8.1	to what has been suggested .	St
1.8.2	Have you enabled MAC filtering , this is the easiest and least troublesome of the security options in a router .	St
1.9.1	Enable MAC Filtering now and see what happens .	St
1.9.2	I am checking the button only allow computers with MAC addresses listed below to access the network .	St
1.9.3	It then lists my computers in the DHCP Client drop down list so I 'll see what happens .	St
1.9.4	thank you .	Polite
