of my two laptops and three desktops.
the cloned drives sit in an anti-static bag in an old vhs tape box.
once a month or so i reclone them.
but the os is flawless and error free.
and that's the key words here.
if you clone, any errors will be moved to the new hard drive.
start from scratch and get a purring system, then clone the drive.
