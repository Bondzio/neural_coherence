With no other criteria other than home user which means &quot;ease of use&quot; the cost factor can be ignored. I'd say Apple's biggest and fastest Intel based machine with Final Cut HD. Bob

I have added 512 ram (total 1 gz ram) and an ATI-Radeon All In Wonder 9600 video card which comes with an analog connector for inputing analog sources (VHS video player). It has worked flawlessly while editing avi files over 8gb. A cheap system that has been very reliable.
