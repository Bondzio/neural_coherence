Sparks that you gotten would probably be and unwanted plugging in of a line to the plug which is actually not meant for power (but rather a peripheral).
Any new board will have a manual to guide you on which plug really needs to be plugged, especially, ensuring the main 16/20 pin is completely plugged.
