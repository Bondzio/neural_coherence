1.1.1	So i have every part other then the video card or card 's .	St
1.1.2	I put together this assembly - E6600 , P5W DH deluxe , 400 sata2 7200 hdd , Dvd burner , card reader , 900 case , raidmax 580 psu , 2 gb corsair ram at 800 mhz dual channel , all in all a good setup .	St
1.1.3	But now me and my bro where thinking of 2 x1950 pro 's , 200 dollars each .	St
1.1.4	I need a second third opinion , i think it will be alright ?	Ques
1.2.1	I have 3 led 120 mm fans , and 1 200 mm fan for cooling , my psu has an led fan blowing towards the mobo , and of course cpu fan	St
1.3.1	will be fast as or faster than x1950s in crossfire for less cash .	St
1.4.1	for your opinion	St
1.5.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814102096 Which will provide the dual solution on a single PCB .	St
1.5.2	As far as I know you can not dual up the 2-way cards , but the other poster was correct that the 8800GTS will provide more rendering power ( ATI 's CrossFire does n't give a speed advantage ( per se ) , it gives image quality advantages ) .	St
1.6.1	the x1950 's have an internal bridge connector so they both can be installed on a crossfire board , as for the 8800 gts i will do some research on that card .	St
1.6.2	thank you	Polite
