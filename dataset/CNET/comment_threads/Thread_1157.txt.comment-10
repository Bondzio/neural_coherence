which I don't know the answer to, having not been there or done that myself.
Is USA wifi technical spec for radio channels, etc.
(which are subject to U.S. FCC requirements) the same as in France (subject to their sovreign governmental regulations).
In other words, will a wifi card in a laptop purchased in the USA connect successfully to an EU hotspot?
Or will it be like FM radio where US stations are on the odd numbered decimals of the frequecy while EU (or is it UK) stations are on the even numbered decimals, so our &quot;standard&quot; radios don't work over there.
One thing I've noticed when downloading firmware and drivers for wireless stuff is that some of it is region-specific.
I guess, in the worst case, you'd have to buy a new PCCard wifi adapter that conforms to the local radio requirements when you get there.
But it would be so much more convenient if US and EU radio specs were the same so the equipment would work on both sides of the big pond.
