<s> I now have a Dell monitor which is actually a Sony Trinitron monitor (17&quot; but not a flat panel) The picture is excellent but I really would like to have a 19&quot; flat panel monitor. </s>
<s> I am looking at a Dell UltraSharp 1905FP monitor or maybe a Sony. </s>
<s> I have a 32MB NVIDIA GeForce2 MX 400 AGP Graphics Card with tv-ou video card. </s>
<s> I don't play games just want a monitor that I may occassionally watch dvd's on. </s>
<s> Is my video card ok for the above monitors or will I not see an appreciable difference in what I already have. </s>
<s> I have seen several Sony monitors and they look great. </s>
<s> CNET gave the Dell a very good rating but I can't just go somewhere and see it in a store. </s>
<s> Any suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Since flat panels tend to be fixed as far as refresh rates are concerned, they do not comprimise resolution and color depth when increasing them with CRTs. </s>
<s> However, I would be concerned that your 32 megs of memory might be a bit weak. </s>
<s> Flat panels also have an optimum resolution (usually termed &quot;native&quot; resolution) and 19 inch screens display a lot of pixels. </s>
<s> You certainly don't need a high end gaming card but something a bit quicker with more memory might help reduce pauses and frame drops when running DVDs. </s>
<s> I also like Sony monitors but the LCD I covet now is a Viewsonic VX910. </s>
<s> This is a 19&quot; with a thin bezel and has about the best image quality of any I have seen in this size. </s>
<s> Since the 17&quot; and 19&quot; both seem to have the same native resolutions, the 19&quot; fits my eyesight better. </s>
<s> I also have a Princeton 19&quot; which is decent. </s>
<s> These will use both D-sub and DVI connectors. </s>
<s> If you go with a new video card, and I think you would be wise to do so, get one with DVI. </s>
