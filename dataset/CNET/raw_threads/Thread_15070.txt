The drive is an unknown brand, but for a few years it has worked with no problems. I took the drive round to my girlfriends house to transfer some pictures and I lost my cable somewhere between my house and hers. The cable supplied with the drive was a USB 2.0, and went from USB A male one end to 2x USB A male on the other end. One of which I would use to transfer files over. The other just seemed useless and I never plugged it in to any USB port. I replaced the cable with a single USB 2.0 cable and the drive powered up, all lights flashing, but nothing appeared on screen. I tried it on my housemates laptop, and my brothers laptop, both running Windows Vista. The laptops both installed drivers, and told me that everything was OK - good to go - but then nothing appeared on those either. Does anyone have any idea what is wrong with the hard drive? I assume it is the type of cable that I have bought, as it was working fine before I lost the cable and replaced it with a single USB lead? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks to anyone who can help out!!
