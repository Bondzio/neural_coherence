I found this for $13.99 shipping included.
I am guessing this will do the job.
Just needed an audio input and hardware that can create decent MP3's and maybe improve the listening quality and enjoyment as well.
I am sure I am loosing a little going from expresscard to USB but hopefully it will do the trick.
Now I just need Creative Wave Studio for XP which I like better then using the free audacity software.
