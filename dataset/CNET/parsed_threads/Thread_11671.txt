<s> I have two pc's in two seperate locations of the same town, (one pc in my office and the other pc at my home). </s>
<s> I want to be able to connect to my office printer from my home pc, both machines use WinXP and have broadband internet connections. </s>
<s> I DO NOT have any servers (ie print servers or software for such services). </s>
<s> The printer is an EPSON Stylus Photo R300. </s>
<s> Is it possible to connect my home pc to my office printer without a print server over the internet, whilst the office is closed & unmanned I realise I would have to leave the office computer & printer in a powered 'ON' state? </s>
<s> If it is possible how would I do this? </s>
<s> Windows only offers support for printers in a local area network, not between peers across the Internet, I'm afraid. </s>
<s> Even if there was, you wouldn't be able to get the results (the prints) without visiting the office, of course, so - realistically speaking - only the next day. </s>
<s> And if you run out of paper, it stops printing. </s>
<s> I think it's best to buy a second printer for home use. </s>
<s> The main cost of printing is the ink, and for that it makes no difference where you print. </s>
