i'm looking for a nas server (with 2 sata bays or more) that, besides its ethernet connection, may also connect to the pc via usb (as a mass storage device).
most nas servers have usb connection but only to add more devices to its storage capacity.
why you may ask... i want to use it as a nas server, connected to my house network, but also directly to my led tv (which has media player software and a usb port for mass storage devices such as pen drives or ext.drives and, hopefully, this nas server).
can you help me?
thanks in advance
