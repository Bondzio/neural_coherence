Went to turn on computer the power supply briefly flashes then nothing happens. I am not sure what is wrong whether it is the Motherboard, PSU, or something else. I bought an Aspire 500W PSU. I tried the case PSU same type of thing happened except no LED lights to tell if it turned on. Any help would be greatly appreciated

Now it's time to look for what is shorted out. The best way is to remove the MB from the case and assemble it on a non-metalic surface and see if you can get fans and such to start. One common problem is extra metal mounting posts that short out something on the rear of the MB. Another can be poorly seated boards or memory modules.
