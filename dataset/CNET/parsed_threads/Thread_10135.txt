<s> For the past couple of weeks I've been playing Xbox Live and getting disconnected every 5-20 minutes or so. </s>
<s> I have it port forwarded properly and everything is configured right...DMZ, etc. </s>
<s> I've checked modem signals and stuff and posted that on dslreports.com and they claimed my signals were fine. </s>
<s> The disconnection lasts literally only a few seconds but its a major annoyance and critical to certain points when I'm playing on Xbox Live. </s>
<s> Another note is that this mainly happens when playing online games but also does happen when not playing just very less frequently. </s>
<s> Most of this time although the connection doesn't literally disconnect but drops to where there will be no upload or download speed. </s>
<s> As if I'm connected but I can't do anything. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I've power cycled my modem and reset my router multiple times but this does nothing. </s>
<s> Modem - Motorola SVB5220 Router - Belkin Wireless N+ Comcast - 16/2 tier </s>
<s> Find the forum sticky and it's settings to help. </s>
<s> Read that first. </s>
<s> Now is it setup that way? </s>
<s> Next we find members posting about going all the way with N routers only to discover that it works better when you set the router to 802.11g mode. </s>
