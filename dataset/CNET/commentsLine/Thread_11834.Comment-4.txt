since you didn't list the price for this pc, i'm guessing that you could build one for the same money or less.
now keep in mind that hp will not give you the xp cd only a recovery partion on the hard drive.
they use a non standard mb so you will not be able to upgrade that.
i think of hp as a low cost alternitive to dell.
