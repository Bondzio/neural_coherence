<s> I have recently switched my old components into a new case that I purchased from Newegg.com, and I have encountered serious problems now. </s>
<s> First of all, when I put everything back in the new case and connected all the cables, everything else was working (PCI, drives...etc) except my PS2. </s>
<s> Secondly, after messing around with the motherboard for a while, my HD turned out not so good either. </s>
<s> I kept receiving a message of &quot;CMOS error - Defaults loaded&quot; then it stoped at that point. </s>
<s> I figure that I can get the PS2 connection back on by re-installing the motherboard's driver, but can anyone help me recove my HD? </s>
<s> I believe I have made all the right connections, any kind of help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Sincerely, Joe </s>
<s> maybe explain what &quot;messing around&quot; with the mobo means in a little detail. </s>
<s> How is the hard drive and the CMOS error related? </s>
<s> What makes you say that the hard drive has problems. </s>
<s> Can you boot up and get into the BIOS, or does the CMOS error come up first? </s>
<s> Might try a new CMOS battery, just to eliminate it. </s>
<s> No chance that the mobo got mounted such that it is shoting to the mounting plate?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> By messing around the mobo, I meant by switching around (add/remove) the drives the PCI cards. </s>
<s> And I did get the BIOS when I booted it up, it has found the CPU, the DVD+/-RW, the DVD ROM, the HD and everything else. </s>
<s> But after detecting the IDEs, a message showed up by saying that &quot;No keyboard detected&quot; then &quot;CMOS checksum error - Defaults loaded,&quot; and it forze up. </s>
<s> I thought it was HD related, apparently it's not. </s>
<s> Sorry if I can't get everything straight, I'm still a newb when it comes down to the hardwares. </s>
<s> But any more detailed help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Sincerely, Joe </s>
<s> And by PS/2 I meant where you can connect the keyboard and the mouse without using the USB port. </s>
<s> back on this thread. </s>
<s> I would guess that you have continued trying things. </s>
<s> The no keyboard MAY be that you haved a USB keyboard. </s>
<s> Earlier systems would not detect a USB device until the Op Sys was up. </s>
<s> Have you tried a new CMOS battery?? </s>
<s> They are only a couple of bucks. </s>
<s> The loss of the PS2 ports, both of them worry me because of the amount of handling the moving of the mobo caused. </s>
<s> But is you can use USB keyboard and mouse, no big loss. </s>
<s> Can you get into the BIOS or does it freeze before you can hit whatever key it takes to get in. </s>
<s> Of course with no keyboard you can't push a key. </s>
<s> Quite a quandry. </s>
<s> I do not intend to mess with that board nor the battery anymore. </s>
<s> I am simply going to get another mobo regarding this problem, since this mobo is around 4 yrs old anyway. </s>
<s> I saw one mobo that is suitable for AMD athlon XP made by PC Chips on Newegg.com. </s>
<s> Can anyone verify for me if that board is considerable? </s>
<s> B/c budget is a factor, and that board only cost around 24 bucks w/o shipping. </s>
<s> Sincerely, Joe </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> in the last year. </s>
<s> No real problems but it is NOT an overclockers mobo which is fine for normal use. </s>
<s> [for their price , one wouldn't expect anything but a basic mobo]. </s>
<s> They all came with the CMOS jumpers on the pins that keep the CMOS disabled. </s>
<s> The manual is correct as far as the pin functions, just that they ship with the jumper in the wrong position. </s>
<s> With the jumper in the wrong position, the power supply won't even turn on. </s>
<s> Thanks for the heads up. </s>
<s> I have read all the reviews regarding this particular MB on Newegg.com, there were a lot of positive feedbacks but there were definitely some people just absolutely hated it. </s>
<s> Well, it's too late for me to cancel the order now, since they have already shipped it out. </s>
<s> And Newegg is known for their restocking fees. </s>
<s> Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted when I get that new MB. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the info by the way. </s>
<s> Sincerely, Joe </s>
