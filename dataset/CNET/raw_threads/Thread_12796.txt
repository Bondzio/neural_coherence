I have a Hitachi external hard disk, I have tons of extremely important files inside. It was still working fine last night until this morning. This is what happened: I plugged in the hard disk, than it is seen as Local Disk (h:). It prompts me to format the disk once I double clicked it. Please help me!! I have really important files in it! Thanks lots in advance! I've tried reading this External WD not being identified - Local Disk (h:) : Hard Disk Drives: data recovery and repairbut I couldnt understand, can someone tell me if it works and how to do it? Im not good in this kind of things.Please help, thanks!

You can try attaching the drive to another system Try other USB Cables Try the drive in another enclosure Try the bare drive inside the inside the system case. (laptops excluded) If those don't work....there's data recovery services that will be glad to take your hard earned $$ in hopes of recovering your priceless data.. Only then will you realize a single data source with no backup is really a bad data management model. VAPCMD
