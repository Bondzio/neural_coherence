1.4.5	You ca n't defeat this or just overlook anything you do may in fact cause problems .	St
1.4.6	The ext .	St
1.4.7	HD should n't have an OS installed it will only confuse or refuse to work properly in a windoze setting .	St
1.4.8	FYI- If the whole idea was to installed a newer drive to replace your current one , then wait until you have it .	St
1.4.9	Once in hand , follow whatever instructions to copy or image copy your old to new drive , thus replacing it .	St
1.4.10	Most HD makers provide the needed s/w and/or gotten from the support website .	St

1.5.1	Thanks willy , this is what I thought .	St
1.5.2	Just to clarify anyway , I 'm running xp sp3 , on a dell dimension 5190 .	St
1.5.3	An old machine but its suits my needs .	St
1.5.4	There are two hdds.both 149gb .	St
1.5.5	I 'm a hobbist using daz3d , and over time , its grown to 100gb , so I currently have 8g free , and thats after deleting a load of stuff I use rarely I 'm getting a Seagate 2TB SATA-600 7200rpm 64MB Barracuda .	St
1.5.6	I had thought that maybe I could go into the bios , make it my master , install the os , then change back to the original set up , and continue to install onto the new drive at my leisure .	St
1.5.7	A shot in the dark , but worth asking , I suppose	St
1.6.1	Seagate will provide the needed s/w I mentioned if you buy the retail & quot ; HD kit & quot ; , if not again they have it at their support website , probably Adonis based .	St
1.6.2	Also , if current setup is 2 HDs mounted , you maybe better off having & quot ; two only & quot ; one being the new HD and the old & quot ; C & quot ; primary drive .	St
1.6.3	Using the s/w will provide all you need to get things going .	St
1.6.4	I mention 2 drives only so disconnect ( or remove for the time being the old 2nd HD ) .	St
1.6.5	Once that 's all done , remove old & quot ; C & quot ; drive and then mount new & quot ; C & quot ; as primary drive as well as the old 2nd drive .	St
1.6.6	If all is done properly it should boot as if nothing happened , but with a new spacious HD .	St
1.6.7	Seagate has instruction , FAQ or guide for all this , just be sure to back-up critical or all data for safekeeping beforehand .	St
1.6.8	Take your time and enjoy your coffee of soda as well .	Polite
