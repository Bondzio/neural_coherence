Hi, first of all let my list my specs: AMD Phenom 9750 MSI K9A2 Platinum Motherboard 4GB DDR2 RAM 512MB nVidia 8800 GT Pro 160GB SATA HDD 300GB IDE HDD Sony SATA II DVD +/- RW Omega 550w Power Supply Achilles Gaming Case Logitech Wireless Keyboard & Mouse AOC 19&quot; Monitor Now the problem: My computer is not booting, when i plug in the keyboard mouse into the PS/2 ports i get power if i play with it, if not it does not work, if i plug it into the usb port it will not work, and when i turn on the machine and the keyboard not working i get 1 semi-long beep followed by 6 quick beeps, but nothing appears on the screen....help!!!!
what can i do, by the way i didn't get a brace for the motherboard to the case, can that be a factor?
