<s> I formerly had an HP PSC 1300 series printer on my home network. </s>
<s> It has since been removed, but I can't seem to delete it from my computer. </s>
<s> It has one pending print job that can't be deleted. </s>
<s> Additionally, whenever I change the default printer, it will soon revert back to the HP PSC 1300. </s>
<s> Also, it whenever I restart the computer, add any other printer, turn any printer on, or insert a cd or flash drive, the printer reinstalls on the computer. </s>
<s> I've done multiple virus and spyware scans, so that shouldn't be the issue. </s>
<s> I would guess if I could delete the print job, then I could delete the printer, and the problem would cease. </s>
<s> However, I can't seem to do that. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
