I was just given an F1703... read all about the blackout problem, pulled the power board and reflowed all of the relevant points despite them all looking good. No difference... ... but my problem isn't that it turns off. My problem is that all I get is a solid white (well lit) screen. No OSD, no signal, no boot logo or anything. Signal source is confirmed good with a working CRT. I've ordered a new power supply module to see if that is the issue, having read that these modules are a bit flaky too. Is there anything else I could try? Does anyone have the service manual they could email me? Thanks for any advice!

Were you able to get your 1703 to work? I'm pretty sure the white-out problem is caused by a faulty video board in the monitor. It's the other board which sits next to and is joined to the backlight board.Right now I'm using my F1703, but on cold start-up it takes 10 minutes or so to come good. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Cheers Rob
