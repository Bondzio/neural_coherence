i've had five drive failures so far, one being maxtor internal, three la cie drives, and one oem (unknown manufacture) internal.
the la cie drives were fine after puting the internal ide drive into new enclosures (avastor) and throwing out the la cie enclosures (never will buy that brand again), the maxtor drive was ok after freezing it overnight, letting it warm up slightly and then puting that into an enternal avastor enlosure.
the unknown oem drive became food for worms.
nothing i could do for it.
luckily i always back up my entire internal on an external once a week.
there are places that can gather data off of ruined drives, even fire victims, but it's extremely expensive.
these drives of mine were all backed up.
this is a lesson actually: back it up just in case.
almost everyone will eventually have a total or partial failure.
