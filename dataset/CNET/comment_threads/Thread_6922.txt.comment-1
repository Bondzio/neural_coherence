Hi; Got a 3-4 yr. old Acer Aspire 4738Z that does the following sporatically: * refreshes web pages * changes default browser * reinstalls Windows updates that it's already installed * external keyboard (internal no longer works) suddenly won't type certain keys * opens MS Outlook all_the_time (close it, reopens) Once (wrote about this earlier) it shut the whole computer down and wouldn't even let me into BIOS, let alone boot Windows.
Where do I begin trouble-shooting this?
TIA, John
