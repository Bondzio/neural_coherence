Adding a dedicated sound card should give you more FPS in gaming and possibly better sound than the motherboard's integrated sound.
&quot;Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic&quot; PCI card has the X-Fi 24-bit Crystallizer and X-Fi CMSS-3D that the $53.99 Xmod adapter has.
You can find it right now for $72.99 after rebate.
