<s> i have installed an internal dvd rw drive externally using an ide-usb2 adaptor into my pcs' usb1.1 socket. </s>
<s> I get a message saying it wont work due to an I/O problem.Will this be cured by replacing my usb1.1 card with usb2.0 </s>
<s> My thought on this is..if you have a usb 2 device then by all mean get an usb 2 adapter card. </s>
<s> If the usb card can't handle the power that is require by the device then you will also need a hub with external supply also (I think that maybe your problem right now; just guessing). </s>
<s> The data rate of USB 1.1 is too low for DVD recording. </s>
<s> Let's attempt a DVD write at about 600 kbps? </s>
<s> That's about 4 hours. </s>
<s> A CD-R at 4x is some 700 MB that at top speed completes in about 25 minutes. </s>
<s> I actually see 30 minutes. </s>
<s> So at USB 1.1 and 4,700 MB to a DVD that would be 4,700 / 700 or 3.3 hours. </s>
<s> And this is if all went well... You'll want an USB 2.0 card since for a PCI card it's the cheap solution. </s>
<s> Here's one I used -&gt; http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=A-6202-4 Be sure to read more at http://www.usbman.com about USB 2.0 on the OS in question. </s>
