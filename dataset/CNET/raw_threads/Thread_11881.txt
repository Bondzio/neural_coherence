If no obvious cause from that, start experimenting: - remove all non-essential components (sound card, printer, any USB device, mouse) and try again - does it boot from CD or floppy if you disconnect the hard disk also? Depending on the results of these tests it's time to start thinking about replacing the PSU or the motherboard. Kees
