The problematic machines are using Windows 98.
Those machines which are successfully connected to the net employ windows 98 and XP.
Thje router used is an Origo ADSL router connected to a simple 8 prt switch.
Each machine is fitted with a standard 10/100 network card, which is fully installed and connected to the LAN.
The problem occurrs when connecting via MS IE5.
Hope this helps.
