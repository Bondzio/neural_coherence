I just completed installing an sata drive using a host card.
I cloned my old hard drive to the new hard drive.
I disconnected the old drive and booted the computer.
The new drive was labeled C:.
I then re connected the old drive and it automatically took the C: and made the new drive F:.
How can I still keep my old drive connected but use the new drive as the bootable drive.
I am using Windows XP Pro.
