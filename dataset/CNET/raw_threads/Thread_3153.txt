I have been using a 1 T.B Buffalo HD-CE1.0TU2 for over 8 months now for my videos, pics, music etc with no problems at all. However recently its started acting up by not being recognised by any of the hardware i used it on previously (laptop,p.c and xbox 360). It seems to get power to it as the green light comes on and you can hear the normal spinning noise for a few secs before there is a few clicking sounds. It then repeats the spinning and clicking a few times before stopping all together but stil has the green light on. When you go into the files menu it is not recognised nor does it automatically start the open folder menu as it normally would, however, the safely remove hardware icon stil appears at the bottom toolbar and the laptop states that the component is working correctly with no fault codes. I've not to my knowledge dropped or kicked the hard drive nor unplugged it improperly. Hope someone can help as some things on it are not backed up as this was the back up to my laptop which recently got all the software changed and everything was lost on it.(though stil worked perfectly fine on new software prior) thanks in advance.
