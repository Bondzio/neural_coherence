I won't duplicate web content as to why but don't count on this to work as you expected. Next, use NET USE at a command prompt instead. &quot;also i cannot connect internet&quot; Well that's another issue on it's own. Your TOPIC is the NN so I'll stop here since you left out any details that I could use to help with the internet issue. Bob
