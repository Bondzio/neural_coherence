When they did our wireless has been much stronger however the Ethernet cable I use for the upstairs computer no longer works. Its not the cable itself but the way the Router is configured I am assuming. When I plug in the Ethernet cable into the router you can notice right away there are no lights showing that the Cable is being detected. Any Ideas how I can get this working?

They should light up on the router and the PC as soon as the PC has power, and that's long before Windows is up and running. So either the router is defective, or the cable, or the Ethernet connection on the PC, or the cable is loose. I'd check the connection on both ends first. Then try a laptop in stead of the desktop. Then try that same laptop downstairs with another cable. Be sure it's a patch cable, not a crossed cable. Then take the desktop downstairs with that same short cable. Taken together this should give a clear indication of the error. If a tech did this, as you write, he did a bad job. And - if I may say so - so did you by accepting it (and probably signing for it) before checking that everything still worked as it used to. Kees
