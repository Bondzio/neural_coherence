i am not sure exactly what would be the problem here.
i can connect to an open wireless network, with a perfect signal and no encryption of any type.
however, when i try to access the internet, using either firefox or ie, it acts as if there is no connection.
this makes no sense to me.
why, with a perfect connection, do i not have internet access?
is there anything that could be happening on my end to cause this problem?
