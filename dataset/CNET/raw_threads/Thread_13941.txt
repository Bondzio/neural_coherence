Their rebate vendor, and Alienware, are scammers. I filed with the FTC and attorney general Florida. DONT buy from ALIENWARE, THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF !!!!!

10356	4	99921	1148759	1148418	ozos	4/23/05 9:31 PM	1.11429186E12	i'd take an Indigo2 over an Alienware	and i don't do server/professional, nor do I know where to obtain a decent MIPS ISA OS, nor do I care to find out I wouldn't like an Alienware, or any Botique computer for that matter also to Alienwaresucks...um, is it possible that it got lost in the mail?
10356	5	99921	1273040	1146962	fightback	6/30/05 11:08 AM	1.12012968E12	We were scammed too	Purchased 11/04, received 12/04. Mailed Rebate form & original receipt via certified mail in Dec. According to the rebate form &quot;please wait 12-24 weeks while we process your rebate&quot;. Waited...no check. Called and was told the rebate form was rec'd 1/3/05, but no &quot;receipt&quot; was enclosed. I've read of several others with this same story. We are considering a class action lawsuit (any lawyers interested?). The system may be good, but when a company advertises a price *post* rebate, it really puts a bad taste in my mouth to have to turn on the PC every day and look at it every day knowing that Alienware has my $500 and the $500 of many others...
