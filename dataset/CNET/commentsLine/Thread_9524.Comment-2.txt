what changed from when this worked?
i do see &quot;issues&quot; that at 240mhz, you can't play a dvd without a hardware card and you certainly can't burn an audio cd at top speed of the machine create wav files on the fly.
you'll have to find the settings to try 1x or 2x record speeds and see if you can have the nero software create the cd image before burning rather than try to do more than one thing at a time.
while your machine meets the specs, you won't be told (except by others) that you can't do all the nifty stuff.
