<s> Ho shall I know if a hard drive is compatible with my computer? </s>
<s> that generally narrows it down, it depends on what controllers you have on your motherboard. </s>
<s> ide controller, ide compatable hard drive. </s>
<s> i might be generalizing, but that should get you started in the right direction </s>
<s> Is there an online tutorial with all the info i need to know about replacing a hard drive? </s>
<s> it's IDE, is that all i need to know? </s>
<s> For larger HDs, your system BIOS and operating system need to support the largeer size. </s>
<s> References: http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/index.html http://www.48bitlba.com </s>
<s> Well, how do I know? </s>
<s> There are tutorials everywhere. </s>
<s> Hard drive mfgs. </s>
<s> and system makers usually have nice tutorials with pictures. </s>
<s> New HD's in retail packages also have quick installation guide. </s>
<s> Check first with on the computer mfg's website to see how to change the drive for your particular computer model. </s>
<s> What is the mfg and model number of the computer? </s>
<s> Read the description of the hard drive. </s>
<s> Read its specifications. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Alot of them don't specify </s>
<s> I meant one that had all of the info about compatibility What's an MFG? </s>
<s> My Computer: IBM XP Model E4N </s>
<s> Hard drives (HD) have been around for decades, and there is a long history of development and compatibility. </s>
<s> Therefore, you aren't going to find a concise tutorial on all the different HD technologies. </s>
<s> You would be reading a good sized technical manual. </s>
<s> Circusjojo gave you a good start on the 3 main technologies of the past decade--SCSI, IDE, and SATA. </s>
<s> SCSI historically has been the HD for servers and Macintosh computers. </s>
<s> Macs switched over to IDE drives on many of their machines in the mid 1990's. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scsi IDE drives historically have been in MS Windows machines. </s>
<s> The term ''IDE'' is often misused because it encompases a large area of technology (not just one type of hard drive and not just hard drives). </s>
<s> Many use the term ''IDE'' to mean any Parallel ATA (PATA) HD and not SATA and not SCSI. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Technology_Attachment SATA or Serial ATA is a newer technology that would not be found in a computer as old as yours. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sata A good way to approach it is to find out what type of HD is currently in the computer and then get one of those. </s>
<s> Your computer seems to be a Windows machine from 1999. </s>
<s> AMD processor 350MHz? </s>
<s> Anyway, it would have a PATA HD. </s>
<s> Maybe it is an early EIDE drive or possibly an ATA/33 or ATA/66 drive at the fastest. </s>
<s> TO GET ANSWERS HERE, YOU NEED TO PROVIDE MORE INFO: Download and run Belarc Advisor and tell us what the full name of your IBM E4N is. </s>
<s> Tell us the motherboard (system board) model mumber. </s>
<s> Tell us the make and model of your current HD. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The specifications for the HD on the retail box or online will tell you enough information. </s>
<s> If you are looking at your old hard drive, the model number on the drive is enough to do a search online. </s>
<s> You can also get the name and model number from Windows utilities like Belarc Advisor, Everest Home Edition, and the built-in System Information utility in Windows XP. </s>
<s> Do you have a link to an example? </s>
<s> Can you provide the model number of the current HD? </s>
<s> I have IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers and the hard drive I have now is a Maxtor 90840D5 I am also considering building a computer from scratch, but I need a way to know if everything is compatible. </s>
<s> Are there some guides where it tells you what kind of video cards work on what kind of motherboard, what kind of ram works, etc.. </s>
<s> Quick search on the internet for Maxtor 90840D5: 8.4GB 33.3MB/s = ATA/33 (Ultra ATA 33MB/s) Buffer (cache) Size: 256KB Rotational Speed: 5400rpm This means that it is extremely likely that you will have a BIOS problem with upgrading the current machine with a larger HD. </s>
<s> You will be limited to an 8.4GB or 32GB maximum HD with the motherboard. </s>
<s> http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/index.html Today's mainstream PC drives are: Much larger (typically 80GB to 400GB) ATA/100, ATA/133, SATA 150, SATA 300/II 8MB cache or larger 7200rpm or faster I think you are wise not to upgrade, but start anew. </s>
<s> Either buy new or build. </s>
<s> Everyone I know who builds one finds it to be quite rewarding (myself included). </s>
<s> For the most part, they don't want to buy a prebuilt machine ever again, unless it is a fantastic deal. </s>
<s> google: ''build your own pc'' Search CNet forums: ''build your own'' The first thing you need to ask yourself is how you will use the computer. </s>
<s> Gaming, high-end gaming, video editing, graphic design, programming, word processing browsing and email, general use, accounting, CAD, etc. </s>
<s> That will lead you to a CPU choice. </s>
<s> Everything will start to fall into place when you search for a motherboard that is compatible with your CPU. </s>
<s> If you have never even upgraded a PC before, you need to do a little reading. </s>
<s> You can do this online or get a book like this one: http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesTitle/productCd-0471767727.html (No insult intended with the ''Dummies'' book. </s>
<s> They are fantastic resources.) </s>
<s> If you want recommendations for websites that have good step-by-step instructions on what to do, I strongly suggest creating a new discussion (the green button), rather than burying that request in this discussion about hard drives. </s>
<s> You will get a lot of suggestions. </s>
<s> Make sure you post what you want to be able to do with your new computer. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> I ahve googled and searched cnet, but Google gives me a bunch of sites from 98 and they don't talk about compatibility. </s>
<s> Cnet's build your own computer didn't talk about a motherboard. </s>
<s> Found this discussion interesting, and may someday soon be faced with the same situation. </s>
<s> My Dell is on its last year renewable warranty and about to expire, and my HD is going to be 4 yrs old. </s>
<s> I would like to also put in a bigger and faster HD before the oem drive starts to act up. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimension 8200 with a 40gb drive and a little interest adding another drive and also maybe building my own system some day. </s>

<s> I'm old school in that I'm used to seeing the multiple pin (39 pins) connection on hard drives. </s>
<s> I recently bought a new Dell and thought I would take a 160GB drive I had in a drawer and upgrade the machine but when I opened it up it was clear from the size of the cable and the plug that there are far fewer pins required for the hard drive on this machine. </s>
<s> What's the story on this????? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I may of not have been clear so I will try again. </s>
<s> What I was asking was, if &quot;monkeysateme&quot; decided to start a new discussion as you recommended to him, to inquire about building a new system how could this new discussion be discovered or followed? </s>
