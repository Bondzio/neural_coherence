I bought a barebone kit( ecs motherboard, duron 1.3). When i first tried to load windows 2k it finished but had missing files(IE and others). Since i cannot get the setup to finish. Always get message #### file missing cannot complete setup.(ex. inf file txtsetup.sif corrupt or missing) sometimes i get an I/O error 0010101. Anyway, I have tried diff. os's and boot disk etc. but linux loads and runs fine. My main question is how can i check the hardware compatibility with windows? Any other suggestions are welcome as i have been trying to get this machine working for over a month. Thanks for any help

All dance around CD copies, dodgey CDROM drives, overtaxed power supplies and more. You must have up to date BIOS and such to load Windows 2000. Linux is a sign the hardware is ready for Linux and means that you are close, but not ready for 2000. Bob
