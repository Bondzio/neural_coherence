1.1.1	I would like to protect all of the records I have stored on my flash drive .	St
1.1.2	Is there a simple way of doing this ?	Ques
1.1.3	Please tell me how one can keep files private on a flash drive .	Sug
1.1.4	Thanks , Ken	St
1.2.1	http : //www.everythingusb.com/u3.html	St
1.3.1	I purchased a 2 Gig U3 flash drive for practically nothing at STAPLES .	St
1.3.2	It does have a password protect feature .	St
1.3.3	However , it also has a feature for surfing the web anonymously .	St
1.3.4	It does not work .	St
1.3.5	It only hides your cookies from a site .	St
1.3.6	There are sites that will report to you what they can see from your computer .	St
1.3.7	I tried that when using the U3 anonymous feature .	St
1.3.8	The test site could still see everything , and could tell me where I had been surfing before coming to them .	St
1.3.9	I then tested the history feature in my IE7 , and it recorded all the sites I had visited while using the U3 .	St
1.3.10	So , yes , you can password protect , but the anonymous surfing feature is not functional .	St
1.4.1	The only & quot ; anonymous surfing & quot ; I found is to use the public library or wifi hotspot .	St

1.5.1	The simplest thing is probably to buy the Lexar JumpDrive Secure , which has an encrypted , password-protected , subdirectory built in .	St
1.5.2	Another possibility is to buy software at : http : //www.folder-password-expert.com/ Maybe there is freeware that will do the same thing , but I have n't looked into this .	St
1.6.1	I had a lexar secure flash drive and the password feature failed .	St
1.6.2	I found very poor support from lexar in trying to recover my data .	St
1.6.3	They acted as though as they care less .	St
1.6.4	The tech support person acted as though I disturbed either his sleep or his lunch .	St
1.6.5	I do n't know which .	St
1.6.6	I hung up and called again and got the same response .	St
1.6.7	I never recovered my data .	St
1.6.8	I have not bought any lexar product since that incident .	St
1.6.9	I take my chances in not having a secure flash but at least I feel that I wo n't loss my data to a failed password feature .	St
1.6.10	Good luck .	Polite
1.7.1	I have got a few old pen drives and I was thinking if there is a software which can be installed in a pendrive , so everytime pendrive is inserted that software will ask for password .	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	What I meant to ask was that whether I can use my old pendrives for storing data securely .	St
1.9.2	I am sure newer pendrives like you mentioned U3 and others can do this as they have some inbuilt feature , but can this capability be added by use of a software preferably a freeware .	St
1.10.1	A download is over at the noted link .	St
1.11.1	I tried opening this link http : //www.folder-password-expert.com/ , but its not opening , guess its down .	St
1.12.1	For plain ol ' pen drives you can try USB Vault from ZDNET - http : //downloads.zdnet.com/download.aspx ? docid=224888 You do need to be a registered user ( it 's free ) .	St
1.12.2	Or try Rohos Mini Drive - http : //www.rohos.com/free-encryption/ also available from CNET downloads at http : //www.download.com/Rohos-Mini-Drive/3000-2092_4-10729531.html ? tag=lst-0-1 hth	Ques
