I have had the same problem you have described on my dv800 HP laptop for about 8 months and no one seems to know anything about how to fix it.
I have a legitimate copy of XP pro that came loaded with my laptop new and have since had to reformat my hard drive due to virus that destroyed my back up partition as well as main drive.
I went to the hp site to get all the drivers and everything now works with the exception of the memory issue.
Have you had any luck with solving this?
Dave
