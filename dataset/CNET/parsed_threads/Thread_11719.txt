<s> I have an Dimension 5000 and have a dvd/ dc-rw drive. </s>
<s> I've added a dvd+/- rw drive but the second drive is not shown on &lt;my computer&gt; or on the &lt;control panel&gt;. </s>
<s> The drive powers up and the light comes on, the disk spins when I put it in the drive but it does not actually work. </s>
<s> I've connected it as the primary drive and as the slave but with no difference. </s>
<s> The Toshiba drive that came with the unit continues to function, even when connected as the slave drive. </s>
<s> On bootup, if I set the slave as active, I get an error saying that it has not been found (pata error is drive is not recoginised - is this a software thing, or a time to boot up for the drive? </s>
<s> ), even though there is power running through the second drive. </s>
<s> Searches with the new hardware wizard do nothing. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
