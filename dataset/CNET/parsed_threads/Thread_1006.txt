<s> After just over a year my Epson Stylus C84 just died-I decided to go for an all-in-one, and am trying to decide between the Canon Pixma mp450 and mp500. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> If you purchased the mp500 did you consider the mp450, and if so what made you choose the mp500? </s>
<s> Same question for those who purchased the mp450. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> The MP500 seems like a bumped-up version of the MP450: Screen: 2.1 vs. 1.9 inches Accuracy: Small as 1 picoliter vs. 2 picoliters Time to print photo-quality 4X6: 51 seconds vs. 55 seconds I would choose the MP450 for $50 more dollars and it has Bluetooth, infrared, and PictBridge. </s>
<s> Just my $.02 ~Ibrahim~ P.S.I would go to a store that retails both, try them out, ask the salesman/saleswoman if they'd let you test print one of your pictures. </s>
