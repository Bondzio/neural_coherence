yeah my friend's machine would not renew the ip stating that it was unable to contact the dhcp server.
(this was over a wireless network card).
i tried the same thing on the internal network card and it gave me an ip of 0.0.0.0 and would not renew the ip for the same reason as stated above.
i think she has big problems...any advice?
