<s> Installed new drive, Now neither drive shows. </s>
<s> Unhook one and the other shows. </s>
<s> Tried both ways and same. </s>
<s> What could be wrong? </s>
<s> they should both be set to Cable Select (&quot;CS&quot;) or one set to to 'Master' and the other to 'Slave'. </s>
<s> If you use CS....whichever drive is at the 'end of the cable' is treated as 'Master'. </s>
<s> How are they setup now ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Set both to select and they work. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
