hi i have a toshiba tablet laptop and lost my software modem (agere).
it intially had com3 but wasn't working working after loading (i think) bluetooth stacking software so i thought i would just uninstall and delete the modem for it to auto find itself again.
no such luck.
i downloaded the modem software with drivers from toshiba-used their delete program and reinstalled.
still no modem.
i tried to add 56k standard modem but there were no com ports in the dialog box.
i have a usb printer on com4 that works fine.
any help is greatly appreciated.
