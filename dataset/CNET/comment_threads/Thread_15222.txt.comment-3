By 2 ways.
After the game notified me i did not have a powerful enough processor..
I opened the properties to &quot;My computer&quot; It told me My processor was registering at 1002.2 Mhz, then I ran a benchmark Perform test and same thing, it registered as 1002.2.
I do not have power save turned on.
