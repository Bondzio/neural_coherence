if i have only this much to work with i'll note recurring issues.
1. the router firmware is out of date.
2. someone disabled ssid broadcasts.
actually there are a number of settings in that area but for most we go with stock settings first to get it working and then test to see what works and not.
3. some routers let you limit the number of connections.
i set mine to 2x the possible number if it's not a network i have daily contact with.
