<s> Hi all, I have changed my ISP from ISP1 to ISP2.I had a Belkin wireless router configured with ISP1 modem for wi-fi use at home.I want to know whether I have to reconfigure my wireless router with the new ISP2 modem or will it work without any changes? </s>
<s> Thanks.. </s>
<s> but then you just mentioned a modem name. </s>
<s> What exactly changed? </s>
<s> Usually, however, your router and modem will operate independently. </s>
<s> If you get a new modem, it just needs to recognize the router so you can't change them without powering them on in the proper sequence. </s>
<s> See the forum sticky for that sort of information. </s>
<s> I'd start with just turning off and on again. </s>
<s> That should be it. </s>
<s> I don't assume you configured the router for the old modem, so there shouldn't be a need to configure it now. </s>
<s> Anyway, just try. </s>
<s> That's the fastest and surest way to know. </s>
<s> And come back if it doesn't work. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Only if it's a manual change etc </s>
