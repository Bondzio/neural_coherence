i would only recommending building your computer if you have a friend who can supervise.
i tried building my own computer, and honestly the building part was easy, it was just the troubleshooting afterwards if something goes wrong, that makes it hard.
if you're looking for a good company to build your computer, you might want to try ironside, ironsidecomputers.com.
they just started selling online earlier this year, but they do a fantastic job at building computers, and their customer service is great.
at least from my own experience.
