1.1.1	Can I use a micro USB-to-USB adapter to play content on my flash drive on a Nexus 7?	St
1.2.1	Just a little bit and I'll try it.	St
1.2.2	Be aware I don't do this because I can dropbox stuff over to it but I think I have the right cable and adapter.	St

1.4.1	As long as the proper seup is present it should exclduing any power need consideration.	St
1.4.2	Once you get injhto adapter and unique arrangements you've left to wonder as you posted.	St
1.4.3	The main idea is what does the specs offer, review it.	St
1.4.4	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	Looked at the specs, tried it and would have to root it to enable it.	St

1.8.1	I'm finding out only by physically looking(hard way) at USB what &quot;they&quot; mean by USB.	St
1.8.2	In some cases it's not the generic USB port as found on a PC.	St
1.8.3	The mini-USB or somehow differently *shaped* USB port takes only what the maker supplied or specific to that brand.	St
1.8.4	While the other end that connects to PC for sync is OK, it's the tablet port that causes all the fun.	St
1.8.5	I've started not to like tablets since you can't crack them open anyways(easily) or is it worth it.	St

1.9.1	It's not the tablet port at all on this one.	St
1.9.2	I did get the Asus Transformer with the keyboard dock.	St
1.9.3	Besides the ports it has a full size SD card slot, micro SD slot and more.	St
1.9.4	What is this cracking open you speak of?	St
1.9.5	Bob	St
1.10.1	Just seeing what's inside, not hacking per se.	St
1.10.2	It's more about what makes it tick, I'm thinking we've come to point of true toss-away devices.	St
1.10.3	I understand phones get reworked in order to resell, but as for tablets, not netbooks or dinky laptops where some upgrades/repairs can be done up to a point.	St
1.10.4	ekkkkk!	St
1.10.5	it's just me -----Willy	St
1.11.1	When a nice web article showed how to shoehorn in a bluetooth adapter connected to an unused internal USB header.	St
1.11.2	That was a cool addition for cheap.	Polite
1.11.3	Thanks for the post Willy and let's hope the office keeps me floating in tablets.	St
1.11.4	I have a few but for reasons given we don't have the Apple ones.	St
