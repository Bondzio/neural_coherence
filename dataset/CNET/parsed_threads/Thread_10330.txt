<s> I ahve two computers that I leave on continuously. </s>
<s> a 667 MHZ HP and a 2300 MHZ emachine I also have two printers and a scanner Anyone know approx. </s>
<s> how much energy in kilowatts this would be per month? </s>
<s> Figure 100 Watts for under 1GHz machines, 200 for above 2GHz. </s>
<s> Printers vary widely with my old Laserjet II sucking up 1,000 Watts when the heater element kicks in to today's laser that sips 4 or less Watts when just sitting there. </s>
<s> If the printers/scanners are newer, guesstimate 10 Watts each. </s>
<s> If you feel you don't want to guess, go to Radio Shack and buy the wall mount AC Watt Meter. </s>

<s> Let's assume that your computer has a 250 watt power supply and your monitor runs at 100 watts. </s>
<s> For a 24 hour period the energy consumption for just these two items is 8400 watt-hours or 8.4 KWhs. </s>
<s> If these items are on for 30 days each month - you are using 252 KWattHours per month. </s>
<s> If we assume a conservative estimate of $0.10 per KWh from your electric company, then you are spending $25 per month by leaving your computer running 24 hours each day. </s>
<s> http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ noted that 6 out of 21 supplies were not able to deliver on their ratings. </s>
<s> As such, the rule of thumb for a reliable PC is to fit a power supply that your machine will draw about 1/2 the rated Watts. </s>
<s> I'd peg the 250 Watt supply to, on average consume about 100 Watts on a pre-built machine. </s>
<s> And about 150 Watts if the user upgraded the machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Most of the electricity used becomes heat. </s>
<s> In the winter, this actually means reduces the amount of heat your furnace needs to produce. </s>
<s> In the summer, if you have an air conditioner, it works a little harder. </s>
