Please dont ask me how I managed it, but with a combination of the XP service, Wireless Zero Configuration, and manually entering my IP address and DNS address etc.
in the adapter connection TCP/IP properties fields, I am accessing the net through my wireless modem/router, and all seems well.
Now I am reluctant to shut down this desktop, for fear of losing the settings when rebooting, which happened twice before.
So, how would you lock in this combination of hardware and firmware configuration, so that it will be retained next time I start up, please?
