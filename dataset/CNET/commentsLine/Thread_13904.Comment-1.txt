i have been looking into moving my hard drive from my computer to my network.
i am also in the market to purchase a new router.
i am trying to decide if i should purchase a router with a usb port or a separate storage device for my network.
i don't want to spend too much since all the nas devices i have found are at least $200, but i have read bad reviews about accessing data through a routers usb port.
thoughts?
