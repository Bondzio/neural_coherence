Hi, I've been looking to get myself a convertible Windows 8 Tablet, but struggling to settle on one.
Ideally it would have good sound, USB ports and large memory (and able to handle being connected to a 1tb external HDD) I was swaying towards the Lenovo IdeaTab Lynx, but this is not out in the UK yet and wont be for some time yet and I'm not quite sure it would do all I need.
Does anyone have any advice or recommendations?
Thanks, Steven.
