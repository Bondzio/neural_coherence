i am running xp professional on my dell pc.
it's only a year old, and have recently downloaded the netscape 8 browser.
every time i turn my pc on, i get lot's of pop-ups, and have been told by many friends to turn off internet explorer, because it does not have the pop up blockers built in like netscape 8 , and the firefox browsers.
please help!!
