1.1.1	I am seriously thinking of getting this Gateway .	St
1.1.2	It seems to have a lot more for the money than other manufacturers .	St
1.1.3	However , Gateway has had so many ups and downs , I am hesitant .	St
1.1.4	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St

1.4.1	You should google for any negative comments to include the Gateway support forums if anything is amiss .	St
1.4.2	If you read these forums and others , just about any PC makers will have problems .	St
1.4.3	PCs are so pushed out the door , anything can happen .	St
1.4.4	If your comfort level suggests everything is OK in that model # , get one .	St
1.4.5	IMO , Gateway is just another builder and overall is n't that bad .	St
1.4.6	I would put it above HP and Compaq for instance but less than Dell .	St
1.4.7	yet , you 'll hear alot of bad press on Dell , yet the numbers suggest they too provide for the most part a decent system .	St
1.4.8	Sorry , that 's about as much bravo I can say about any PC out there .	St
1.4.9	You should review the return policy and/or warranty to see what you 're getting into .	St
1.4.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	The most comprehensive comparison of brand reliability I have seen is done by PC Magazine .	St
1.5.2	Here are links to the article and the chart on the ratings : http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2368154,00.asp http : //www.pcmag.com/image_popup/0,1871 , iid=267317,00.asp You have not stated how you will use the computer or what price range .	Ques
1.5.3	If you are looking for a low end model , then one of the large manufacturers options will provide the most bang for the buck .	St
1.5.4	However , you also generally get low grade components , a small PSU which limits upgrades , oftern not being able to add a decent graphics card , and bloatware .	St
1.5.5	If you want an intermediate level to above machine and/or want to avoid the above limitations , then I strongly recommend a custom build from CyberPower .	St
1.5.6	Note that they evaluated on the reliability list linked above and rank higher than all other prebuilt systems except Apple .	St
1.5.7	If interested in this option , you go to there site and select the components .	St
1.5.8	This will take a little more work since you have to pick the components , but that can be a fun process too .	St
1.5.9	For help , take a look at this link I just posted to earlier : http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-7586_102-517823.html ? tag=threadListing ; forum-threads If you want to add or upgrate the graphics card for any of these systems , you can find helpful guidance and other resources at this site : http : //www.upgradevideocards.com/index.html	St
