Ok excuse my stupidity, I'm not very computer literate.
My computer runs slow and I assumed it was connected to the ram but if I am wrong could you please suggest what I would do to enable it to run faster.
I gather that I must but more disk space?
If so how do I know which disk space I am to buy.
Again, sorry for my stupidity
