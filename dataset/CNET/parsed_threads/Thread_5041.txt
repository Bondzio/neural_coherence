<s> I have a combo DVD read/writer: SAMSUNG DVD +-R/RW which was installed new in my PC just over 1 year ago. </s>
<s> I have burnt many CD's and DVD's without any problems. </s>
<s> Recently, most of the DVD's I burn, although they still play OK in my PC, they keep freezing when playing them in DVD machines, even in different machines. </s>
<s> No problems with music CD's, only DVD's, regardless if + or -. </s>
<s> Can this be due to wearing of the DVD writer? </s>
<s> I have used CD/DVD lens cleaning kits but doesn't help. </s>
<s> Can't be software related, as the DVD's play OK in the PC. </s>
<s> Help / suggestions would be much appreciated. </s>
