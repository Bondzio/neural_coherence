please ignore my other 2nd post.
It didn't read my network connection, it read my modem, my bad.
Ok the old desktop is getting the correct address from the Router.
The AMD has 2 network connection ports.
Neither of them can renew their IP address from the &quot;Repair&quot; button.
I cannot ping the older computer.
Could you please be more descriptive on how to get into the screen to assign my computer an IP address.
Thank you
