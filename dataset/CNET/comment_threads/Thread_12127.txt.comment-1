This usually doesnt happen with computers but i am stumped.
Last night my PC died on me, no lock up or warning, just turned off.
When I went to turn it back on, and in every attempt there after, I get power for all of 1 second.
The fans fire up, disk drives light, and thats it.
I replaced the power supply not too long ago but it has been working fine for about 3 months.
The mother board is getting power, when switched &quot;off.&quot; So im guessing it is not that.
Any help would be appreciated.
XP P4 200mHz 512 self built power supply is 550W did not smell any burn up.
