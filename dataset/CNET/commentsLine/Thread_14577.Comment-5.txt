do you have any leads on this iwave media player?
i think tried searching for that too, to no avail.
it seems like a lot of hits on google lead to nonexistant websites or have changed since the introduction of the inet wave player.
however, someone, somewhere should have an archive of such things i would think they we we use data storage and archives.
thanks again for your interest.
if you come accross anything that will help, please keep me in mind.
p.s.
i think it was suggested to try a google's virtual machine ( or virtual box??)
or something to that effect.
is this something you'd agree could work?
