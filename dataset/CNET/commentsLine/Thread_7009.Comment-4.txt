are all the units the same?
- of course not.
but for your first question in your original post the differences are less than 1% so i'll stop writing here.
do you or any one else can share their results with their router?
- unlikely.
if you would publish some web site with &quot;can you do this benchmark for me and share the make, models and (all) your settings?&quot; then maybe you'll get a load of data but for the setup i shared we are still in the sub percent difference when we copy files to/from machines, change the switch and re-test.
this is why i don't bother sharing make and models.
these are fungigle.
