i have an hp pavilion 7840 30gb ultra dma hd, 48x cd-rom, hp cd writer plus.
micro atx power supply(90watt).
the case has 4 expansion slots, 1 front usb and 1 front 9 pin serial port.
i want to get a new motherboard and processer and power supply.
i want to keep the case and everything else.
i'm not sure if i could use the same hard drive.
i'd like to get a power supply with at least 300w.
can i get a mico atx power supply with that kind of wattage or more.
i want a motherboard with agp 8x and i want a pentium 4. right now i'm running me but i do have windows 98 brand new in the package.
any suggestions?
