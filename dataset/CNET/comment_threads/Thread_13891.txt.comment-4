If that option was checked, then SD would have booted from the external after having finished cloning.
This would mean that the drive is in fact bootable and some glitch in the startup disk pane on the main computer just precludes its selection as a boot drive.
I would repeat the cloning (or if you remember what happened, don't do it) and see that the external is booted into indeed.
If this is the case, I would create another account with admin preferences and see if you can select the boot drive from its preference pane (I am not sure there is a pref file for this pane to trash).
If it works OK, then you have a problem with the main account and you might like first to apply another combo update (not from software update) or run TechTool Pro or DiskWarrior.
If nothing works, I would then exchange or return the external drive.
