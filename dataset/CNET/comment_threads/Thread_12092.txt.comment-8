You don't have to install Linux.
Just boot one of the many LiveCDs.
I suggest the latest Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS 2007.
NO LINUX KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED!!!
Also possible fix would be to buy a new 300 or so GB USB drive, partition and format on your XP machine then take both to a Vista machine to copy the files from the Vista drive to the XP drive.
