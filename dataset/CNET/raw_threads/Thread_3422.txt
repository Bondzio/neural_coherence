The only business use I've seen: colleagues using their iPad to read their mail and make short notes during meetings. They like that it is lighter than a laptop. Kees

The two different operating systems both have their pros and their cons, so really neither is a better choice, other than which one you prefer. Those three should give you a very good starting point.
