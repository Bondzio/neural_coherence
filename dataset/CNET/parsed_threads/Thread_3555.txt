<s> I have a problem with my pc. </s>
<s> PC specs, AMD 1.90ghz, 248mb RAM, 32 mb PCI video card. </s>
<s> When I transfer the PC to the other room and connected back all the cables, I turn on the PC and the screen is blank. </s>
<s> I check the PC to the other monitor, but nothing happens. </s>
<s> I tried to disconnect the monitor to the video card and tried it on the top (stock one) and still the screen is blank. </s>
<s> The PC runs fine. </s>
<s> Fans are working well. </s>
<s> Can someone have an idea how to solve this? </s>
<s> thanks.. </s>
<s> Probably your video card has become loose in its socket. </s>
<s> You can remove the case cover, loosen the screw and reseat it. </s>
<s> Power off! </s>
<s> Check the video cable connector pins. </s>
<s> Be sure they aren't bent or broken off. </s>
<s> Unplug at each end to do a visual inspection of the connectors. </s>
