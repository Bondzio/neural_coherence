It's not overkill and the remote access is all internal.
I don't need to remote access my network or any machine outside my house.
The closest thing I can come to is a router thats like $1200-$1400 when I know there has to be some home networking models that can be just as good.
Even a switch will be suitable and I'll just uplink it to a regular router for firewall capabilities and internet access.
The longest fiber wire I have would probably be 100ft maximum since that's more than enough to reach a computer that's the furthest away from the point where my other machines are.
I tried Cat6 but had some connectivity issues with it through my router so I decided to stick with Cat6 for everthing else except 2 machines hooked up through fiber through a switch for blazing internal speeds and uplink to a Cat5 router for internet access.
