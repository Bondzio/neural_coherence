Enter BIOS before windows starts. Make sure the original HP Pavilion HD is primary boot drive. Exit BIOS. Let Windows start normally. Secondary 60GB drive should show in My Computer. GOOD IDEA: Move all important personal files (docs, pics, music, etc.) to HP hard drive, and then format old 60GB drive from DISK MANAGEMENT. That will give you a clean 60 GB HD for storage.
