<s> I am trying to build a computer for the first time and I am confused about the jumper config on my Intel D865PERL mobo. </s>
<s> In order to route speaker to back panel the manual says to place jumpers in 3 locations. </s>
<s> I also need to place jumpers on 2 locations for my BIOS. </s>
<s> My board came with 3 little blue plastic things already placed on some of these locations (not the correct ones according to the manual). </s>
<s> My problem is that I have removed them and I forgot how they were installed. </s>
<s> On one side of the plastic thing is 2 holes and on the other is 3 holes. </s>
<s> It seems to fit both ways. </s>
<s> Which way is correct? </s>
<s> Also, the board only came with 3 and according to the manual I need 5. </s>
<s> Can someone please tell me if I am missing something here or where I can obtain more of these little plastic things. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>

<s> Ok, after reviewing the manual for my mobo and looking at the Intel web site, I am even more confused. </s>
<s> The site says that I only need to set 3 jumpers while the manual says 5. </s>
<s> Ive double checked and the manual I have is correct, D865PERL. </s>
<s> The website makes more sense as my mobo only came with 3 jumper blocks or whatever they are called. </s>
<s> Please help clarify. </s>
<s> The manual should explain what you need to know. </s>
<s> The blue thingees are the &quot;jumpers&quot; just configure to the way you want the audio connected or setup. </s>
<s> Look at the picture/graphic in manual and &quot;usually&quot; the way they show it is the default setting. </s>
<s> Why you moved other jumpers for the audio portion doesn't make sense. </s>
<s> In other words, &quot;just what are you trying to do&quot;? </s>
<s> for what you want. </s>
<s> My experience has shown the latest info is gotten from the website, so d/l the new manual or help guide and use that. </s>
<s> Just be sure you're reading the guide for the proper mtrbd. </s>
<s> model. </s>
<s> The jumper itself, connects two pins, use the side that has two holes. </s>
<s> Unlss Intel is using some new jumper I suggest to proceed with common sense. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
