I am trying to find a DVD Recorder for a Dell 4500S. The height in this is about 1 1/8 inches outside the box measurement. Thanks for any and all help Gordon

The fastest speed I see today on internals is 2X. This means that a full DVD recording session will be on the order of about 40 minutes. If you get an external 8X drive, it could cost much less and bring that time down to under 20 minutes. In fact, my external USB 2.0 and Fireware case was 35 dollars. The 8X I picked up was 99 bucks on sale and it's been great. Bob

I tried 2 e-mails to Dell Sales and got nothing!Thus my use of the Storage Forum, I have 6 USB ports on my Dell Dim. 4500s and all are used. I know I can purchase a USB hub that will add many more ports. But I have been told that the more USB devices that are added, the slower the computer will be. I am trying to use an internal drive that Dell calls &quot;Slim&quot;. The height may be 12.7 mm. As you suggest I may just go with an extenal drive. Again, thanks, Gordon

There is an issue that is not a big deal is that your USB Hub must share the bandwidth, but if I add a PC-Card USB 2.0, then I see full speed from those ports (as fast as PC-Card can go.) And the USB 2.0 hub is a good idea since I use one like a dock. Makes for fast getaways. Bob
