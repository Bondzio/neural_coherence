I've created a policy that I want to enforce on a user that will change the work station for that individual. I created a work station policy but want different user's to have different rights. When I attach the server policy it does'nt restrict the work station as it should. I must be missing something ?

I currently run a VT program in a Federal Prison. So I have certain inmates I wanna restrict from certain things. I also have tutors which are inmates and want them to have more flexability. When I create a user and attach the group policy to them. When they log in to the work station they are'nt restricted. I can put a work station policy and restict everyone. But I thought a group policy would follow with the inmates account to any computer he would log in on. Hope this helps you understand better.

In that way, when they close the current window they are working in, the computer will be automatically returned to the locked down state.
