Until this day I have bought 3 (three) installation disks (2 x OEM and 1 retail) to no avail. The items appearing under Other peripherals are simply not available ! I have managed to find an ethernet adapter file in order to access Internet for a possible help: consequently I have no audio or video nor multimedia peripherals and no indication WHY and where to possibly download them. Why this phenomenon ? The rest of the installation shows no problems at all ! Many thanks !

Microsoft doesn't find them (again proper!) and nothing has changed in decades about this installation. Let me be blunt. No drivers = no access. Bob PS. Your post doesn't tell of make or models so it appears you are not asking for help finding the drivers but just wanted to know why this is.

When you install the OS, it installs drivers that are on the CD for the hardware it knows about. As XP was written some years ago, there is a good chance that your hardware is newer and hence there is no way that Microsoft could put the drivers on the CD. What you need to do is to install the drivers from CD for the hardware that you have. You do this after installing Windows. I assume that you got the driver CDs when you bought the hardware.
