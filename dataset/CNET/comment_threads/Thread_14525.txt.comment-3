I've got a copy of Norton Ghost 8.0.
I just tried using it, and while it could 'see' the D: drive, but it is greyed out in th menu, unlike the C: drive.
It can't make an image of it, or copy it...it says the drive is not partitioned, and so cannot be accessed.
Just formatted the new 300 gig seagate.
So I just need to find a copy program that can access the problematic maxtor...
