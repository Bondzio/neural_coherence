my alienware use to go to sleep if it was on for an extended amount of time with no problem, but now it will not sleep on it's own and when i try to manually make it sleep, it will turn the monitor off, and then immediately turn the entire system back on.
i tried to power down using the power button when this kept happening, which also wouldn't work so i then pulled out the power cord.
i waited about ten seconds and put the cord back in.
i did not press any buttons and my alienware turned it's self on right as the power was restored and 'came out of sleep' skipping the loading screen and going directly to my desktop reviewing my notepad documents that i had open before previously taking the power cord out.
seems like alienware has some sleep issues, or the systems are possessed.
