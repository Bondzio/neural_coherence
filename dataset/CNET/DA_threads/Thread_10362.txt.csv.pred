1.1.1	I have a server MB Asus DSEB-DG .	St
1.1.2	It has two PCI-Express slots , and other slots also .	St
1.1.3	It comes with two marvell 88se6145 raid controllers built on the motherboard .	St
1.1.4	The issue is that when I use a PCI-express Video card .	St
1.1.5	I can not get in the Marvell raid controller BIOS during startup ( CTRL-M ) to set up the raid .	St
1.1.6	I have also tried using many different PCI-Express video cards but same results .	St
1.1.7	When I use a video card in any regular PCI slot or use the one built on motherboard the BIOS option for marvell to set up the raid works fine .	St
1.1.8	I am just guessing that there must be something in the main BIOS that I can tune so that I get the option during startup for Raid setup when using PCI-Express slot in my case for Graphics card .	St
1.1.9	Any tip would be nice .	Polite
1.2.1	We left a spare PCI card in the machine for that setup .	St
1.2.2	You have a good issue to call the maker to fix the BIOS .	St
1.2.3	Bob PS .	St
1.2.4	The company that called me on that one and I do not alter , write the BIOS so it was a simple matter that the customer demanded that board and we provided a way to get to that screen just like you did .	St
