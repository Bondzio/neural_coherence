1.1.1	Hi , I am trying to decide between 2 PSU 's .	St
1.1.2	I do n't want to have to pay more than $ 200 for it .	St
1.1.3	I have found these two PSU 's .	St
1.1.4	The PC C & C Silencer 750 Quad ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817703009 ) and the Rosewill RX950-S-B ATX ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817182096 ) I can get the Rosewill for a deal with the processor I am getting ( the Intel Quad Core Q6600 ) for $ 120 where as the PC C & C PSU will be $ 170 .	St
1.1.5	I want to be able to use it with my Quad core and two Nvidia 8800 GT video cards using and XFX nforce 680i motherboard ( http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp ? skuId=8434385 & type=product & id=1182557691186 & ref=09 & loc=01 & srccode=cii_5766179 & cpncode=09-44158805-2 ) which one is better in the end and will meet my requirements and I would prefer that no one just tell me that the Rosewill is better since the wattage is higher on it .	St
1.1.6	I also should say that I noticed that the efficiency on the PC C & C is 83 % and on the Rosewill it is 75 % .	St
1.1.7	If you could reply ASAP that would be great since I am pressed for time .	St
1.1.8	Thanks , Chris	St
1.2.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139006 about $ 150 after $ 25 rebate ... 5 year warranty too .	St
1.2.2	Already got the MB ?	Ques
1.2.3	Heard there we some issues with the 680i chipset MBs with the Q6600 .	St
1.2.4	Maybe it 's only the eVGA MB For more ref on PSU ... ..go to http : //www.jonnyguru.com VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Thank you very much !	St
1.3.2	That PSU looks amazing !	St
1.3.3	I think i will get that considering it has such high ratings .	St
1.3.4	Also , I looked online for conflicts between the motherboard and the processor and I could only find issues with and older version of this motherboard by the looks of it .	St
1.3.5	Am I incorrect ?	Ques
1.3.6	Can you find me something on this if possible ?	Ques
1.3.7	Thanks , Chris	St
1.4.1	not sure about the Q4 and the 680 MBs ... .	Res
1.4.2	I just heard/read mention of it ... I 'm thinking it was the eVGA version .	St
1.4.3	If it were me ... I 'd try the MB mfgs site and see if they have a forum on MBs and specifically a forum on the MB you want .	St
1.4.4	Usually lots of good info re user problems with their boards .	St
1.4.5	Another MB option worth looking at is the Abit IP35 Pro ... .I 've read some good tech eval ratings and 245 buyer reviews on Newegg where 83 % were 5 's and 11 % were 4 's .	St
1.4.6	Let us know .	St
1.4.7	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	That motherboard looks good but I am wondering if I could SLI 2 Nvidia Video Cards using it ?	Ques
1.5.2	Also , if possible I would like to add a physics accelerator .	St
1.5.3	Lastly , what does & quot ; MB mfgs & quot ; mean , and where is there site ?	Ques
1.5.4	Thanks , Chris	St
1.6.1	or Crossfire support .	St
1.6.2	MB mfgs = motherboard manufacturers ...	St
1.6.3	I looked but did not see a user forum on the Abit site ... bummer .	St
1.6.4	Asus has good user forum for posting questions about Asus products by type ... .such as by motherboard and model number .	St
1.6.5	Very good for pre purchase product review or troubleshooting .	St
1.6.6	VAPCMD PS .	St
1.6.7	.	St
1.6.8	.	St
1.6.9	Just double check re the Quad Core and the 680 chipset MBs .	St
1.6.10	Good support for Dual Core .	St
1.7.1	I think I will just stick with the Nvidia 680i .	St
1.7.2	It seems to have some pretty good review and should do just fine .	St
1.7.3	Thanks for the help and the PSU looks great !	St
1.7.4	-Chris	St
