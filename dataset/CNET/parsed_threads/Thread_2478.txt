<s> In december I bought a 7310 to replace another HP all in one. </s>
<s> Out of the box it should work even without a computer hookup. </s>
<s> It prints from the computer perfectly. </s>
<s> The fault occours when you try to make a color copy! </s>
<s> The color in the copy is 50-60% of the original. </s>
<s> This also happens when you scxan a color sheet. </s>
<s> I called the company to get a fix and after hours on hold and then led through the manual for trouble shooting to no avail. </s>
<s> SO they sent me a new one, three days great service except the new printer did or did not do the same thing! </s>
<s> So back to the phone same thing . </s>
<s> New printer, refurbished. </s>
<s> 5 days Same thing So called HP CORP. CASE MANAGER SAYS IT MUST BE HARDWARE GETTING BUMPED New one 3 days same thing 50% color on copy or scan Does anyone have any ideas to help me solve this problem other than sending this back to HP and getting what money back i can. </s>
<s> my wife likes the card slots and print choices. </s>
<s> Call back and insist on a senior tech. </s>
<s> The Case Manager may just be damage control/PR. </s>
<s> Copy it at the store and see if the store model does ok or not. </s>
<s> Remember that color copiers do not make color accurate copies. </s>
<s> I will not embark on the lessons about color copiers, color calibration (look up Pantone Spyders), paper and even why this is so. </s>
<s> But expectations of a color accurate copy are usually dashed. </s>
