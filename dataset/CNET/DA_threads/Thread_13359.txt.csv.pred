1.2.1	its not worth upgrading too ... my oldest computer had a p3 1ghz and it suks so much more compared to my pentium 4 ... i would suggest investing a new pc already upgrade to 800mhz from 566mhz , u wont see much of a difference	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	First , I agree with NerdyBoy and Konny ... it 's not worth upgrading .	St
1.4.2	( Not to mention it ca n't handle anything above 800MHz ! )	St
1.4.3	I have a four-year-old HP Pavilion 6736 ( see my profile ) which wo n't cut mustard anymore .	St
1.4.4	I bumped it up to 512MB RAM , a 60GB HD , and a CD burner so that I can use it as a test machine .	St
1.4.5	I rarely use it , and only to test programs or go to websites which I know will screw up my computer .	St
1.4.6	However , there are so many programs that it wo n't handle , I created a second partition on my primary system for testing as well .	St
1.4.7	Thus , I 'm now looking for another use for my old 6736 , most likely as a hardware firewall .	St
1.4.8	Since yours is even older yet , you only have a few options , and upgrading it so that it can remain your primary computer should n't be one of them .	St
1.4.9	Second , since you are new to the forums , I would like to point out that typing in all CAPS is considered shouting , and thus fairly rude .	St
1.4.10	In the future , please keep this in mind .	St
1.4.11	Hope this helps , John	St
1.5.1	That 's a 50 % boost , the mobo ca n't handle it .	St
1.5.2	However , it may handle this one : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819112141	Ques
