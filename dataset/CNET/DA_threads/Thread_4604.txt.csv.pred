1.1.1	I recently bought a PS3, and it has the option to search for a media server.	St
1.1.2	It doesn't find media on my network attach computer hard drive.	St
1.1.3	Is it looking for a networked hard drive like the HP Media Vault MV2120 or D-Link DNS-323 2-Bay Network Storage Enclosure with media on it?	St
1.1.4	Do I have to get a &quot;media server computer&quot;?	St
1.1.5	Can I use my computer and run some program to make it recognizable as a media server to the PS3?	St
1.1.6	Can someone help?	St
1.2.1	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=PS3+MEDIA+SERVER&btnG=Google+Search	St
1.3.1	Thanks!	St
1.3.2	I should have done that.	St
1.3.3	I didn't see a way to do it with NAS.	St
1.3.4	Does the PS3 need a computer running one of those programs on the network or can online storage be accessed by a PS3?	St
1.4.1	As the links suggest we can't just pop a share or NAS out and have it use it.	Sug
