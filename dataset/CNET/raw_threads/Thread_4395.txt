Microsoft will not be issuing a fix. While Word 97 does run, it has this and at least two other bugs. Again, no patch will be arriving for these issues. Ever. Forget about it. What to do? - Endtask Word when it hangs like that. - Try the usual Word cureall. Delete all NORMAL.DOT files. - Go get Open Office from http://www.openoffice.org and use it instead. Sorry about that, but I have to be direct and brutal about this issue since I found if just be subtle, people miss the message. Bob
