Preferably if you own the One-Touch mini- http://tinyurl.com/2empge Tried contacting Seagate, but of course, they're closed on weekends & their hours'll be spotty for the holidays. Few things: I'm a little lost on how to use to &quot;Sync&quot; & Back-Up features. What're the main differences between them? Also, I'm getting the red 'M' icon on my toolbar. (the Maxtor isn't &quot;found&quot; on the laptop) There's no easy to find Help area for this thing & I'm a novice to it all. Damn. All I really wanna do is store stuff (esp. music) from my laptop to the Maxtor. Thanks in advance.
