The case that I used supplied a little device that was the speaker. It had the four pin connectors with two wires. The mobo shows a function for three of the four mobo pins [Vcc, common, and signal] I tried all combinations with two wires. Wasn't smart enough to try it without video to see if it beeped then. Seems that the Beep would be a BIOS function. So pull your video card out and see if you get lots of beeps [and let us know. LOL]

It all happens from the old board a GA-8SR533P no beep but the fan is turning no POST just a blank screen butit also beep without the memory, after checking I found that the board is toast so I replace it with this ECS-648FX-A board, does it got to do with the processor? Cheers!!!
