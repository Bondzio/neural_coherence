your cpu temp is high, those intel prescott cpu's run hot.
replace the cpu cooler unit with a higher quality one.
read here: cpu coolers .
don't buy a cheap one, expect to pay 3$30 - $45,also use a good thermal compound such as arctic silver 5. the folks that make the cpu coolers also make vga coolers.
check for one that will be compatible with your graphics card.
