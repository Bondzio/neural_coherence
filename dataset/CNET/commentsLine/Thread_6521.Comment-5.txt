i don't have a dell, but i would still question the possibility it could be the bluetooth server (the laptop) is the culprit here.
especially if something else works.
then it's the mouse.
i'm having the same issue, only mine only came back to life once.
yesterday.
and now today it hasn't worked at all.
*shrug* i hope it's nothing that would require me to send in the laptop to toshiba.
i thought bluetooth worked by a 'pairing' of devices... that it would pair up with another device (get in sync).
and windows 7 has hardly anything that is of use, there's a control panel that lets me add com ports.
like there's a slew of com ports open right now.
i've tried removing and reinstalling com ports, but nothing.
so i'm hoping he gets a suggestion that i could try.
thnx -leq
