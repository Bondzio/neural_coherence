<s> I have an HP 6635 Pavilion running Win 98 and Linux I want to upgrade it to XP. </s>
<s> I formatted the drive. </s>
<s> But Linux still comes up when the machine boots up. </s>
<s> The linux has errors and that does not boot up properly Help </s>
<s> You just need to rewrite the boot loader. </s>
<s> If you find your way to the XP RECOVERY CONSOLE, then FIXMBR will overwrite it. </s>
<s> In closing, a proper XP install does NOT use the old DOS format command. </s>
<s> Those who don't learn the new ways tend to suffer a little. </s>

<s> How did you format the drive? </s>
<s> If it was truly formatted, Linux should not be able to &quot;come back&quot;. </s>
<s> So the Xp installation disk doesn't actually reformat when you tell it to? </s>
<s> Thats odd...but not surprising. </s>
<s> Is there an easy way to zero a drive using the XP disk? </s>
<s> I've never found a format that did. </s>
<s> Programs like FDISK (from DOS/ME days) and FIXMBR diddle with that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was wondering about this. </s>
<s> I tried to install XP after formatting the drive (via XP cd) and...low and behold...all of the old user files were still there. </s>
<s> What I am used to.... With the OX install CD you have the option for 3 levels of erasing: quick, zero, zero then write random. </s>
<s> I assumed this was standard. </s>
