no no hp/compaq is a good brand.
You just can't get the budget machine using intel chips.
All the AMD-based have AGP slots.
(another reason to buy AMD chips) Just get a mobo that is the same with your current CPU.
You can easily pull the CPU out, get some thermal paste, and put it in the new mobo.
However, I think they use m-ATX mobos.
