i assume you just cannot run ethernet cable which is the best and most reliable.
there are 2 popular options.
the ethernet over powerline and a ethernet to wireless bridge.
the wireless bridge method tends to be a little cheaper and simpler to setup.
the system that carry the data over your electrical lines once they are setup are much less susceptible to random loss than wireless.
