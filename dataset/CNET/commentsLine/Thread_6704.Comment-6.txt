with case open, find the usb wire harness that connects the usb frt.
panel to mtrbd.
and reseat it a few times(power-off).
now retry using the frt.
usb again.
if it doesn't work, even though the device mgr.
says, it's ok, it really can't test the full usb port status(complete circuit).
if you have anything else connected to that usb frt.
panel, disconnect use only 1 device to check.
no need to check the usb frt.
pcb, unless it shows a broken wire or shorted.
if you have access to other usb panels, try using that.
a used usb panel from a broken pc can be swapped(hanging out) just connect the wire harness to that mtrbd.
connection.
this not test the usb header but the panel itself.
i offer that as a possible test.
otherwise, you can buy a pci or pci-e card and mount it to serve extra usb ports if nothing seems to correct the frt.
panel connection.
if you check your mtrbd.
manual you *may* have an extra un-used usb header, swap wire harness to that location.
look closely at mtrbd.
and find usb locations, they maybe labeled as usb1, usb2, etc.. if in doubt check the manual.
