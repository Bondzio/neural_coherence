well, we are not sure what you need this pc for.
if it's basic tasks like email and using the internet, that isn't a bad pc.
but since you come here asking for upgrades, maybe you are gaming or just want a faster pc.
what i would do is just buy a whole new pc.
trust me, it won't be worth it to upgrade that pc (depending on what you use it for).
everything is near out of date.
i would buy a new mobo (socket 939) 1gb of ddr400 memory &lt;200gb hard drive a nvidia 6600 graphics card (pcie) an amd 64 3200+ cpu (s939) new case psu antec, ocz, enermax make great psus, &lt;400w the rest is up to you.
i can't really recomend upgrades since i don't know what you are looking forward to.
i just named parts that would bring you into the current generation of pc components.
