Just weeks after the United States launched a cruise-missile strike against bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, Prince Turki bin Faisal asked Mullah Mohammed Omar to end his protection for bin Laden and hand him over.
If Afghanistan does turn over bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, it is possible that bin Laden might be tried there, rather than in the United States.
Arab officials say that Prince Turki presented evidence to the Taliban of bin Laden's involvement in terrorism, but it made no difference.
Bin Laden has worked in Afghanistan and Pakistan during the war years distributing official Saudi aid money for the mujahedeen.
