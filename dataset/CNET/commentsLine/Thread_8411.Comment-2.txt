that there is nothing new to doing this.
you get your internet to some internet sharing box.
while you could start with a router i suggest something better like sonicwall or untangle.
with the internet done you put your next effort into your &quot;cable plant.&quot; this one can be easy with a pair of 24 to 48 port switched hubs.
these are cheap and then you run your cables.
as to wifi, you can try off the shelf routers configured as waps if your it is savvy but keep the security sky high such as wpa2 and nothing less.
