1.1.1	I'm looking at buying my new computer, since my Duron 1ghz of 3-4 years doesnt quite cut it for me anymore.	St
1.1.2	Choosing most of the specs have been very simple for me: Here's what I've lined up so far CPU: AMD64 Venice 3200+ Mobo: Gigabyte K8N Pro-SLI Mem: 1G Kingston DDR2 HDD: Maxtor 16M SATA 250G Drive1: Benq DW-1640 Gigabyte 16x DVD-RW Drive2: CD-RW/DVD Combo At the moment my system totals around $900+ Australian including setup My current dilemma is what Graphics card to put with it.	St
1.1.3	I had initially settled for a 256mb Gigabyte 9550 for $80 or so dollars to put into AGP, but as I've read more and more into it I've found that AGP is being rendered Obsolete by PCI-E. My question is, is there any sense shelling out $200-300 for a PCI-E card with the same RAM as opposed to sticking with AGP?	St
1.1.4	And with the aforementioned specs, are there any graphics cards that you could recommend that are within the low to medium budget range?	St
1.1.5	Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.	Polite
1.1.6	Thanks!	St
1.1.7	If it helps I am interested in using the PC/Graphics card for gaming, 3D rendering on the side and also photoshop work.	St
1.2.1	If you are going to use the Gigabyte K8N Pro-SLI motherboard you have no option other than to use a PCIE videocard, there is no AGP slot on that board.	St
1.2.2	If you don't want to spend alot on a video card go with a 6600 series card minimum, and check out the 6800GS too.	St
1.2.3	Either of those would handle what you want to do fairly well.	St
1.3.1	Thanks, you saved me some considerable embarassment!	Polite
1.3.2	I didn't realise that it was without an AGP slot.	St
1.3.3	Thank you for your card recommendations.	St
1.3.4	Now I have to determine whether to go ATI or Radeon.	St
1.4.1	&quot;Now I have to determine whether to go ATI or Radeon.''	St
1.4.2	Whoops--Radeon is an ATI product line.	St
1.4.3	I think you meant you have to determine whether to go with an ATI Radeon or an nVidia GeForce video card.	St
1.4.4	The gamers will tell you to go with nVidia cards.	St
1.5.1	Since you are going to buy an SLI motherboard your best choice would probably be an SLI capable Video card.	St
1.5.2	So you could get almost any of the nVidia based graphics cards from the 6600 LE and up, depending on how much money you want to spend.	St
1.6.1	nVidia SLI Zone: http://www.slizone.com/page/home.html nVidia certified SLI hardware: http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone2_build.html	St
1.7.1	Whoopsadaisy indeed.	St
1.7.2	I realised in hindsight and I had meant ATI or Nvidia, but sometimes the fingers type faster than the mind works, haha.	St
1.7.3	Thank you for your input	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	Nvidia is the way to go.	St
1.9.2	Many of nvidia's graphics cards are now SLI ready.	St
1.9.3	Besides, nVidia currently has the best graphics card in the market, the 7800gtx.	St
1.9.4	In my opinion get the nVidia 7800gt, which isn't as good as the 7800gtx, but is close and you save alot more $$$ going with the 7800gt.	St
1.9.5	Also if you want, you can put the 7800gt in an SLI configuration later; to help with your photoshop, your 3-d gaming, etc.	St
