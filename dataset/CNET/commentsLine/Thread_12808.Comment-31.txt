the hp machines are more friendly with restore cds and waranty.
i like the amd hp machines.
support ok. dell is easy to back winxp because delloem cd with xp can be installed instead vista without activation.
-believe me, too much ask by downgrade- the cons of dell is some tower/desktop models are ugly design.
but support ok. emachines is nice and good style.
price is better.
at this time i never needed support.
