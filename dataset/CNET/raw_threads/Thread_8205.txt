The ink cartridges and electroconnection points are clean and dry. Shall I conclude that the souls of the ink cartridges have flown the bodies after having been unattended and unused for such a length of time? Haven't tried new cartridges yet. Or is there something else I should be attending to? Thanks / appreciated.
