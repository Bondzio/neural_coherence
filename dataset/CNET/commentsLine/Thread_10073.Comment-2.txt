i have a p4 1.9 ghz socket 423 with i845 chipset which i put together because i wanted to recycle some 512 sdram i had.
what a mistake.
it runs at about the speed of a 900mhz p3.
you may as well just find some 1ghz p3 and get that speed?
other issues!
your power supply unit (psu) to run this new dragon should be abotu 400 or more watts.
