<s> Hi all, So is it possible for a range expander to cause weaker signal in other parts of the main router's range? </s>
<s> Here's the situation: I live in a double brownstone, 4 floors. </s>
<s> I'll call one side &quot;1&quot; and one side &quot;2&quot; since there's a serious masonry wall and several fire doors in between. </s>
<s> Big house. </s>
<s> The main wireless router (linksys wrt54g) is on the 2nd floor, side 1. </s>
<s> The signal generally covers most of the house, but was having issues with signal strength up on the 4th floor, side 2, so I installed a Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander on the 3rd floor, side 2. </s>
<s> Worked beautifully. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> except that there are now serious signal strength issues (i.e. </s>
<s> can sometimes connect for a minute with very low signal strength) on the ground floor, side 1. </s>
<s> When I turn off the range expander, the issues on the ground floor disappear and the signal strength is wonderful. </s>
<s> Any info on why the range expander appears to affect the main router's range? </s>
<s> I wasn't aware that that could happen, and couldn't find similar situations in my internet hunting. </s>
<s> Would appreciate any advice on how to resolve, esp. </s>
<s> since I can't think of many other places to put the booster that would resolve both issues (maybe 3rd floor, side 2). </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I've no practical experience with range extenders so forgive, but it occurs to me that the symptoms you describe are wireless interference. </s>
<s> I think it might be worth re-reading the manual on which channels the extender is best set to in relation to the router. </s>
<s> Bear in mind that the frequencies represented by channels can interfere with each other unless separated by 5 channels. </s>
<s> In other words 1, 6, 11 don't interfere. </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> I realize this post is nearly 1 year after the original, but I was wondering if you ever were able to resolve the issue using the same hardware? </s>
<s> I recently purchased the same expander and have the same issue. </s>
<s> In fact, at times it seems to suck the life out of the entire network. </s>
<s> There are times I can be 10 feet away from the expander and I won't be able to get a strong enough signal to access the internet. </s>
<s> I have a neighbor with a Hawking range expander. </s>
<s> That may be my next attempt. </s>
