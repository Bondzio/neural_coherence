I haven't updated my computers in close to 5 years so it's time. I want to update each computer 1 at a time as funds allow. All 3 computers within rack system, I use mostly for multimedia application from video and graphic editing to music production along with gaming and general everyday office use. I would like upgrade all my components starting with my first computer including motherboard, graphics cards, sound card, processor, etc. Based on today's technology, what would you recommend as the ideal components if this computer is going to be used for doing video and graphics editing? Should I wait until next January when the next generation of processors come out? Should I opt for for dual processors? The second rack mounted computer is going to be used for music production. HOw should I upgrade this computer to get the most bang for the buck? My third computer is where I dump everything for entertainment and general use including music files, games along with my regular everyday softare like MS Office and email programs which don't take up much space. I don't want to bog down the other computers with additional software that may drain resources for when I'm working on them. So what components should I use to upgrade these to. Each rack mounted computer contains 2-3 hard drives. Thank you in advance.

AMD's Athlon64 X2 4800 is the fastest one out there now. Graphics is now in the PCIe x16 era and you can use two on same mobo. Go with 256mb overclocked. Memory: OCZ seems to top the list here. SoundBlaster Audigy for sound. Two SATA drives striped (WD Raptor 74s). SATA large capacities for music and game and videos and photos and... 21&quot; 1600X1200 high contrast ratio LCD or Flat screen monitor. Flat screen still give best graphics if you have the room. Buckle-up and let 'er rip! I did. and life goes on... Jack
