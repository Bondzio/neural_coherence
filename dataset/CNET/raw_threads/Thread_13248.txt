I know there is a cure for this, i'm not bothered about losing data. I just want to access it to re-format it and make it usefull!

How big is the hard drive. How large a hard drive worked before? Many older systems are unable to see drives that are over 8GB or 32GB or somewhere larger or smaller, depends on the age of the system. Give us facts!!!
