thanks for your suggestion...and it worked...to a point.
i got cakewalk creator 2003 to load onto my hp m7060n system, however, the recording function does not work.
when i try to record with a microphone - no sound is measured on the volume meter.
i get a message that my computer's realtek sound card is not compatible with cakewalk creator 2003 drivers.
am i sol?
is there a driver i can download from hp or cakewalk?
very frustrating.
