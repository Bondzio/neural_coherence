1.1.1	I 'm building a new computer and am not sure which motherboard to get .	St
1.1.2	I 'm going to be getting an AMD X2 4200 or 4400 ( not sure yet on AM2 or socket 939 any suggestions on that ? )	Ques
1.1.3	I assume the AM2 is newer , so if the opportunity is there to get one for AM2 should I jump on it ?	Ques
1.1.4	Anyway , I know this would have to be 2 different reccomendations since I 'm not sure on the socket .	St
1.1.5	I will also be purchasing an ATI X1900 graphics card and a Hauppauge 500 dualtv tuner .	St
1.1.6	I saw a couple Asus motherboards that received very high reviews , but I saw it talk about SLI , which I figure I would not use since I have an ATI graphics card and wo n't be putting 2 in my machine .	St
1.1.7	One of the cards I was looking at was the A8N SLI Deluxe which received very good reviews .	St
1.1.8	Another was the ASUS A8R32-MVP Deluxe but I know someone that has had a lot of problems with it .	St
1.1.9	Any reccomendations would be great , Thanks , ~J	Polite
1.2.1	I 'm not really compelled to jump on the AM2 bandwagon ...	St
1.2.2	It 's not a giant leap over 939 , it 's a babystep to DDR2 .	St
1.2.3	The next big thing for AMD will be K8L in 2007 , which is n't too far away .	St
1.2.4	As far as a 939 board , the DFI LanParty nF4 UltraD overclocks exceptionally well , but only if you have a good idea of what you 're doing , or if you get good advice from someone that knows what they 're doing .	St
1.2.5	If you want to overclock , but you 're not too familiar with how to go about doing it , Abit has some really good boards that you should look in to ( I have an AT8 ) .	St
1.2.6	They feature the uGuru overclocking utility - it 's an easy way to get a good OC .	St
1.2.7	One of the GREAT things about Abit is the support that you get at their forums from other Abit users .	St
1.2.8	Re : processor - if you 're waiting for the price drop in a week or two , go for it .	St
1.2.9	If you were planning on spending somewhere around 400 , do yourself a favor and get an Opteron 165 or 170 instead .	St
1.2.10	They work with any board that supports dual-core 939s .	St
1.3.1	i 'm just looking into this stuff , what new chip is coming out in a few weeks causing the price drop ?	Ques
1.3.2	End of July we talkin ?	Ques
1.3.3	Ok I just got back into looking at things and thought that AM2 was going to be the new standard , either way I thought it was better than 939 .	St
1.3.4	I 'm not interested in overclocking right away atleast , possibly down the road .	St
1.3.5	Ill check with Abit , as well as Asus .	St
1.3.6	I really want a highly rated board .	St
1.3.7	What is the difference between an Opteron and the other chip I was looking at like the 4200 Manchester or Windsor .	St
1.3.8	A lot better chip ?	Ques
1.3.9	Will I notice a performance difference ?	Ques
1.3.10	I do n't know anything about them compared to the ones I was looking at .	St
1.3.11	I see price wise it 's just about the same .	St
1.3.12	I appreciate the help , thanks , ~J	Polite
1.4.1	Is the new chip , code named Conroe I believe .	St
1.4.2	Woodcrest is the server version that competes with Opteron if you are curious .	St
1.4.3	Woodcrest is the new Intel Xeon processors .	St
1.4.4	Regards , JB	St
1.5.1	Based on early benchmarks , AM2 offers 3-4 % performance increase over 939 , I believe .	St
1.5.2	I was in the same position as you - looking at a 4200 or 4400 X2 , but ended up going with a 170 based on the user reviews .	St
1.5.3	The main difference ?	Ques
1.5.4	Most chips are produced with a certain ( high ) level of performance in mind .	St
1.5.5	Towards the end of production , they 're 'binned ' - they test each one , knowing that there will be variances in performance - out of the same batch of CPUs , some will end up being $ 300 CPUs , some will end up 1000 CPUs .	St
1.5.6	Opterons are some of the better performing and most sturdy - server-class .	St
1.5.7	They 're selected with the premise that they 'll be on , running 100 % load , 24/7/365 for years and it 's possibly because of this that they OC so incredibly well .	St
1.5.8	Okay , 4200 , 4400 , Opty 170 - difference between the 4200 and the 4400 is the L2 cache - twice the size in the 4400 .	St
1.5.9	The Optys all have that larger L2 cache , but the clock multiplier is lower .	St
1.5.10	Both the 4200 & 4400 have an 11X multi ( core clock X multi = CPU speed , in this case , 200mhz x 11 = 2200mhz = 2.2ghz ) the 170 has a 10X multi , the 165 a 9X multi with the same stock 200mhz core clock speed ... but they OC well - you can increase that significantly .	St
1.5.11	I normally run my 170 24/7 at 260 X 10 = 2.6ghz or FX60 speed , although I can run it a little higher .	St
1.5.12	Some people run'em at 280*10 , some 300*10 , some higher ... let 's put it this way - if you DO N'T get it to run 260*10 , something 's not right !	St
1.6.1	So how long will it be for these chips to fall in price ?	Ques
1.6.2	Id figure the drop would be substantial , is there a new chip coming out at the end of the month ?	Ques
1.6.3	So I assume you are saying that this trip would run better than the 4200 or 4000 X2 .	St
1.6.4	If I do get it , is there a motherboard I should look for that would work well with it ?	Ques
1.6.5	Also , any reccomendations on memory ?	Ques
1.6.6	I wanted to get 2GB .	St
1.6.7	Thanks , ~J	St
1.7.1	That 's the dilemma for you - it 's not likely that the Opterons will drop in price - they 're not technically consumer chips , and the Opteron division is healthy - no reason for them to cut prices .	St
1.7.2	The X2s will be dropping by up to 50 % in the next couple of weeks in anticipation of competition with Intel 's Conroes .	St
1.7.3	They next motherboard that I will buy for a 939 will be the DFI LanParty nF4 Ultra .	St
1.7.4	Pair that with an Opteron 165 or 170 with 2gigs OCZ PC4000 ram , and you 'll likely hit 300+ X 9 or 10 = 2.7 - 3.0 ghz + with the proper settings .	St
1.7.5	So , you have to decide - go with an X2 in the $ 200 region , or spend another $ 150-200 on a chip that has the potential for 3.0 ghz .	St
1.8.1	I 'm new to overclocking .	St
1.8.2	If I do decide to go that route and get the Opteron and that board to overclock it , is it easy to do ?	Ques
1.8.3	Is there somewhere I can go that would guide me through it ?	Ques
1.8.4	It 'd definitely something I would do assuming I would n't be damaging any of my new parts , or decreasing their longevity .	St
1.8.5	I would assume I would need to buy new fans in order to overclock it is that right ?	Ques
1.8.6	Intel Conroe will come out very high in price I would assume , so it 's probably not something I 'd be interested in looking for , I might just go this route .	St
1.8.7	I appreciate all of your help so far , thank you very much , ~J	Polite
1.9.1	It 's not too tough , it just takes patience ... and having someone very knowledgeable goes a long way !	St
1.9.2	I got some good advice from the guys at the Abit forums , but what really opened it up was the advice I got after joining the Abit Wolves Fold @ Home Team .	St
1.9.3	You do n't necessarily need to have an Abit board to join , we have our own forums with restricted sections for members .	St
1.9.4	There are several VERY knowledgeable guys that you can ask any number of questions , from selecting components to RAM settings to voltages .	St
1.9.5	There 's always a risk with overclocking , but the more you know , the more you can manage it .	St
1.9.6	Temps and voltage are the things that you really want to keep an eye on - if they get out of hand , it 'll shorten the lifespan of your equipment - That 's why I usually run at 260*10 , because it 's the highest I cane run without bumping the voltage from the stock range .	St
1.9.7	It can certainly be run higher with a little more voltage and still be in the low-risk range , but my CPU is ALWAYS at 100 % load and I never turn my rig off ... As far as CPU cooling - the stock coolers with the Opterons are actually pretty good - it 's a 4 heat-pipe design .	St
1.9.8	If you want to cool things down a little more , there 's the Zalman CPNS 9500 - it 's one of the better aircoolers out there .	St
