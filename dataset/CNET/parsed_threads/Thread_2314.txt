<s> Please help me out. </s>
<s> I have two hard disks on my PC. </s>
<s> Each having Win98SE OS installed on it. </s>
<s> By changing boot sequence in my BIOS I boot any one of my OS installation. </s>
<s> The 2nd Hard Disk suddenly developed bad sector of 16kb due to which hard disk could not recognize &quot;windows&quot; folders located on it. </s>
<s> Hence this hard disk would not boot. </s>
<s> So, then I booted my 1st Hard Disk, and formatted that partition of 2nd Hard Disk which developed bad sectors & then scanned the latter. </s>
<s> Bad sectors of 16kb still remain. </s>
<s> Now I started installing Win98SE OS on formatted partition. </s>
<s> The 2nd hard disk was rebooted which is a usual process while installing the OS. </s>
<s> On rebooting, the 2nd hard disk did not boot normally & I received an error &quot;Invalid System Disk. </s>
<s> Press any key to continue&quot;. </s>
<s> Then I assume that it continued the remaining installation on 1st Hard Disk. </s>
<s> I inserted the serial key & installation completed. </s>
<s> The 2nd hard disk never booted with Win98SE OS though it shows &quot;Windows&quot; & &quot;Program Files&quot; which have come due to installation I had started. </s>
<s> Also the OS in my 1st Hard Disk shows as if it has been reinstalled. </s>
<s> I assume that till the reboot, installation took place in 2nd hard disk & after reboot the rest of installation continued on 1st hard disk. </s>
<s> Is my assumption true? </s>
<s> Has that partition of 2nd hard disk developed permanent bad sectors? </s>
<s> What is its remedy? </s>
<s> Can I install OS on it & use it as I used it before? </s>
<s> Should I replace hard disk with new one?? </s>
<s> Please help me out urgently I am in a real fix. </s>
<s> drive with the bad sectors. </s>
<s> They may get repaired, but mostly marked so that the drive [system] does not try to use those sectors. </s>
<s> Then reinstall SE over itself. </s>
<s> Right now a program called SpinRite is checking out the HD from my Win98 machine. </s>
<s> It started developing bad sectors. </s>
<s> The program's price is steep ($89)compare to replacing the drive. </s>
<s> The reviews were good and stated they had been able to recover data. </s>
<s> I don't completely understand but it does things scan disk don't do. </s>
<s> One thing is it isn't dependent on the operating system and will work on PC that have DOS, Win95, Win98, Win XP, OS2 and Linux. </s>
<s> mean that the drive can't be accessed, and require buying a recovery program [there are many free ones, and there is Knoppix. </s>
<s> But scan disk should simply mark the bad areas so that they are no longer used. </s>
<s> If the drive continues to develop bad sectors time for a new one. </s>
<s> Get the diagnostic program to run from a floppy, from the drive mfr to see if the drive is on its last legs. </s>
<s> If it is bad, let's hope that it is still under warranty. </s>
<s> Drive mfrs are very good about honoring warranties. </s>
<s> Don't wait to transfer the data till it's too late. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
