I know, those FPS are THW figures, and I was replying to his initial post and giving what Tom's hardware shows for those initial cards.
He later brought up the FX 5700 vs 5600 and nerdyboy answered.
I agree with you and nerdyboy that the FX5700 is the better.
Saitokokeimei now says, &quot;....the card i mentioned doesn't cost much at all.
i've already ordered it and a logitech mx700 mouse.&quot; I assume he is talking about the FX 5700, but now think it may be the Radeon 9600, 256MB 128 bit DDR for $78 which Tom's Hardware game tests just slightly above the FX5200 on Call of Duty, and Doom3.
