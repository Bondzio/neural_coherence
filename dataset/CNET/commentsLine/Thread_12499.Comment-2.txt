my experience would tend to suggest that 2-3 years would be typical for a pc.
even if the machine is still working at the end of 3 years, the software and os upgrades?
will have slowed it down to a crawl.
in a networked environment, you could consider vdi or terminal services/citrix etc and using thin clients.
the thin clients will outlast the pcs and your hardware refresh will be limited to the server.
some of our thin clients use as little as 7 watts, so you could be helping your fuel bills and the environment too.
