i want to add an old ultra ata 20.4gb internal hd from a previous pc (win 98se) to my newer dell (winxp media center 2005) which uses a 320gb performance raid 0 hd (2x160gb sata hdds w/native command queuing).
the old ultraata drive has some files on it i'd like to save (jpgs & mp3s), but mostly i want it for file storage, and would erase most of what's on the drive (old programs that pre-date winxp).
questions i have are: if it's compatible, would i set the old drive's jumpers to slave mode?
(i wasn't sure if the two 160 satas are set up as master-slave, or both considered part of the same master hd.)
would the win 98se os on the old drive try to kick in automatically for some reason before i could erase it?
or, on the other hand, would there be any reason to leave win 98se on the drive (eg to run the old programs, like some games that don't work on xp)?
i don't have a discwizard diskette to go with the old drive for partitioning and formatting, so is that a problem?
or will the winxp system automatically detect the old hd, or be able to use one of the cds that came with the dell to detect the old hd?
