9910	0	204623	2188203	NR	mjlinhart	9/8/06 7:29 PM	1.15774374E12	connecting to a hotspot	I live across the street from an internt cafe. I can pick up the signal but it is very weak, i lose connection every few minutes. The distance from my apartmet to the cafe is about 400 feet. Is there a wireless card that would pick up the signal or am i too far away.
