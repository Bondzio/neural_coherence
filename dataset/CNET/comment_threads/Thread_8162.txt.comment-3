If it works well I would not bother upgrading.
Even a B wireless is faster than most people have for internet.
You will just get the data to the router faster and then it goes over your same slow internet.
The newest technology does have a little better coverage but if you are not having issues you basically can only make it worse.
If you are going to replace your stuff you might as well buy N stuff.
This will run B and G also but most models you must pick one you cannot run all at the same time.
You need to replace all your equipment at the same time.
So its not just as simple as buying a $20 USB adapter.
Now if you just want new toys for christmas thats a good reason too
