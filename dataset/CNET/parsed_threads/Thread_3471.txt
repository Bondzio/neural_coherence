<s> I have three computers connected to a DSL/Router. </s>
<s> Two connect to the Internet OK. </s>
<s> The one I am having trouble with is running Win98 SE and I am using a Belkin F5D7050 USB wireless connection. </s>
<s> It can connect to the router, and I can 'see' files on the win98 computer from the other computers. </s>
<s> There is no way however that I can connect to the internet with it - even though the other two computers can. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I have checked that the computer name is unique and that the workgroup is the same. </s>
<s> The router assigns it a DHCP IP address, but I cannot get onto the internet. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>

<s> What are those IP and default gateway numbers? </s>
<s> Nothing is amiss in the device manager (no exclamation points). </s>
<s> The IP address is 192.168.2.6 and the DNS address is 192.168.2.1 This is the DNS address that is entered into the DNS tab. </s>
<s> There is no DNS reported when I do an IPCONFIG. </s>
<s> Is this normal with Win 98? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>

<s> points to the router's IP address instead of the IP address of your ISP's server. </s>
<s> Make sure your are set to &quot;Obtain your IP and DNS automatically&quot; on your TCP/IP properties page. </s>
<s> Then try a release and renewing of those numbers using winipcfg from a command prompt. </s>
<s> They hand out the DNS as 192.168.0.1 for example and proxy the DNS lookup duty. </s>
