the core 2 quad runs 4 actual threads and the i3 runs 2 with hyperthreading.
the i3 also has graphics on the cpu.
while i don't have personal experience with either of these as mine are different, i think you'd want to look at your personal needs.
if you want to game, you want your own graphics card and not the i3.
if you like to open multiple programs, you want more actual threads.
