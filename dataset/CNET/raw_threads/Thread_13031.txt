I want an e-reader like a kindle, also I want something I can put my music on and never do it again, like a Zune with a hard drive. So, this will cost me about $500 and I have two devices to carry around. Is there something out there that will do both? I already have a laptop and a desktop so I don't need to have internet on this new device, I just want to download books and music on this new device and be done with it.
