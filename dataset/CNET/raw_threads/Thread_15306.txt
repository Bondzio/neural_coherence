Suddenly that Hard Drive now shows size of 111GB only. It used to save recording for 15 days it comes only to 5 days. Any Help or Suggestion to get my lost bytes back. I have Windows XP installed.

For example if someone plugged it into Windows XP (notice no SP?) then that's what XP would report. In fact it could corrupt the drive. Fix? Plug into a system with an OS that supports over 127GB drives and start over. Bob
