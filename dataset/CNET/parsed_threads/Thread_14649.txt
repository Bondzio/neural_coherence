<s> Hi all, I was going through these LAN hard disk available nowadays. </s>
<s> Seems pretty usefull to have it on the network and then anyone can access it from their own PC. </s>
<s> But the problem is of access control. </s>
<s> What can we do if we do not want everyone to access every folder. </s>
<s> Is there any way to do the access control based on users ? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help AQ </s>
<s> What OS. </s>
<s> For example if the OS was Windows NT or later and the external drive was NTFS then NTFS permissions is sufficient. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply, If you are asking for the PC on the network, we have 7-8 PC on the network with most of them running windows XP and one or two on Windows 7. </s>
<s> The machine that &quot;serves&quot; up the files would have to have accounts maintained and then we use NTFS permissions to grant or deny each account access to what we see fit. </s>
<s> As there are plenty of web pages on NTFS permissions I must stop at that point. </s>
<s> Many go nuts over all the maintenance, the tedius account and if you had XP Home the 5 user limit. </s>
<s> That's why businesses usually end up on a server. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But there is no dedicated machine on the network which is always on. </s>
<s> All machine are personal systems and they are normally turned off. </s>
<s> So if it requires a PC which can be used to set the user profiles, and it can be turned on and off then it should be ok. </s>
<s> But if it requires a PC which should be always on then we would have a problem. </s>
<s> Can you help me clarify this doubt. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Given no two are alike we would have to download the manual for each one and see what user access controls each one offers. </s>
<s> Remember there is no standard here for this product type. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks all for the reply. </s>
<s> Yups it was right that different HDD have different options. </s>
<s> So I searched for the manuals of Western Digital. </s>
<s> Finally I bought the western digital book world which offers me the needed functionality. </s>
<s> Thanks all for the time. </s>
