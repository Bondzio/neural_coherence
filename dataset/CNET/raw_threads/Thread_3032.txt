One (ethernet connected to the router) has a printer and I want to share it with the other pc. I set up the printer as shared Then I went to the other pc (wireless connection to the router) and tried to define a remote printer. The printer add wizard cannot find the printer: I tried browsing and it found nothing; I tried telling it the printer was \\pcname\printername and it couldn't find it either What am I missing? Both machines are running WinXP Home John

It should if the sharing was set up properly. Do a right click and select &quot;Connect&quot;. I remember years ago older NT systems had an &quot;Install&quot; option from this point but not sure if this works the same. The ideal way is to use a print server but this costs a bit and not all printers and print servers work happily together.

The issue was not with the physical set-up but with the firewall software (e.g., Norton Security, Black Ice, etc.) I had installed on the machines. If you're running one of these programs, you should go into the scren that allows you to allow or add &quot;friendly&quot; IP addresses. Just type in the IP address of your printer (e.g., 192.168.1.100) and hopefully you'll set up program will now be able to &quot;see&quot; the networked printer. Good luck...

I don't know how many network problems I've pulled hair out trying to solve, only to track it back to a simple firewall block. Enough at least that now, the firewall is the FRIST place I look when a network problem rears it's ugly head.
