1.1.1	i 'm not sure if this is the right forum , but bear with me , i 'm new here .	St
1.1.2	that said , here is my problem : i want to find a wiring diagram for a laptop lcd/tft screen so i can make an adapter to plug it into my graphics card and have a secondary monitor .	St
1.1.3	where would i find info on this ?	Ques
1.1.4	thanks for any help in advance !	Polite
1.2.1	See if http : //www.eserviceinfo.com/equipment_type/Notebooks_43.html helps , but its been over a decade and I 've yet to see anyone do this .	St
1.2.2	best of luck !	Polite
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	no luck on the previous post , but i do thank you for your input !	St
1.3.2	anyone have any more suggestions ?	Ques
1.4.1	I 'm sure you have checked but most laptops I have seen lately have a VGA output built in and a connector for the cable in the back .	St
1.4.2	This does not necessarily add the ability to run two monitors at a time .	St
1.4.3	This takes special circuitry and not just parallel wiring .	St
1.5.1	Quote from Steven Haninger & quot ; I 'm sure you have checked but most laptops I have seen lately have a VGA output built in ... & quot ; this is true , but i am looking for an input .	St
1.5.2	i do n't need to display from the lcd , but to it .	St
1.5.3	i have been searching endlessly and found that at least two people have used the Vesa connector on their graphics cards to connect a laptop lcd to their desktops .	St
1.5.4	but the best quality of color they have gotten is 16 colors .	St
1.5.5	i am looking for at least 16 bit and a resolution of at least 1024x768 .	St
1.5.6	this is why i thought that maybe with the pinouts of my graphics card , and the pinout of an lcd , i would be able to have a primary ( or secondary ) monitor .	St
1.5.7	thank you for the input Steven , but i 'm afraid i sitll have n't gotten the answer i 'm looking for .	Polite
1.5.8	i 'm still open for suggestions for anyone that has them !	St
1.5.9	thanks again !	Polite
1.6.1	It 's like we watch you struggle at the end of a rope .	St
1.6.2	Someday it will dawn on you that such a & quot ; adapter & quot ; or & quot ; rewiring & quot ; does n't work .	St
1.6.3	How can I shorten the time it takes you to realize that Laptop LCD 's are not VGA Displays in disguise ?	Ques
1.6.4	You do n't want to know the truth so you may struggle trying to do this for weeks and months .	St
1.6.5	Here 's hoping you will realize that this may never work .	St
1.6.6	If it did , you 'd find articles aplenty on the web .	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	Would a shared desktop suit your purposes ?	Ques
1.7.2	This is easy with a network connection and MS NetMeeting .	St
1.8.1	ok , here 's what is happening : VGA is analog - I KNOW .	St
1.8.2	i said DVI or Vesa , both of which are digital .	St
1.8.3	now , maybe it is you & quot ; struggling at the end of your rope & quot ; ... .i do n't know , nor do i care .	St
1.8.4	but this HAS been done .	St
1.8.5	there is a website ( http : //www.tft2pc.maltepoeggel.de/ ) but is in german .	St
1.8.6	use babelfish to translate the site , you should n't have to & quot ; struggle & quot ; too much with it .	St
1.8.7	now , before anyone else tells me it has n't or ca n't be done , take a look at that site to be proven WRONG !	St
1.8.8	it is possible , and it is somewhat what i 'm looking for , but the person on that site has only been able to get a max resolution of 640x480 and 16 colors .	St
1.8.9	i want a minimum resloution of 1024x768 and at least 16 bit color .	St
1.8.10	but thank you for letting me see that you do n't know what you 're talking about ... .made me laugh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.8.11	!	St
1.9.1	nope , i 'm going to fiberglass a bezel and a wall mount for an lcd , or 2 ( minus the rest of the laptop ) and i want it connected to my desktop .	St
1.10.1	As an electronics design engineer , I know it is possible but it 's not a simple wiring issue and your laptop does n't have to use VGA signals to the display .	St
1.10.2	Since you were so nice , I leave to learn about all this .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	To make a long story short , contact the supplier or vendor of the laptop .	St
1.11.2	-OR- have a friend in the business get the manuals for the product in question .	St
1.11.3	The repair maunals have the specs and such , but prepare to pay .	St
1.11.4	If you find some SAMS listing on just laptops , do n't expect to match entirely the end product just a generalization at best or get lucky .	St
1.11.5	In the longrun , you maybe making an & quot ; interface & quot ; adapter not just a wiring adapter for a simple pin1-2 whcih should be part of the overall solution .	St
1.11.6	Put it this way , its a long way until completed and yes you 'll need the specs .	St
1.11.7	manual and of course understand the engineering involved as you 've seen the basic output was n't what you desired , you duplicating the laptop interface for a more hands-on connection .	St
1.11.8	FYI - Laptops are such a PITA , I readily pass it on to the authorized centers if a quick fix ca n't be made .	St
1.11.9	good luck -- -- -Willy 2-cents spent	Polite
