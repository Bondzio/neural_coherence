i'm just moved into a condo and brought my dell axim home to check if there are available wireless networks...and there are a ton.
i was able to connect to the net through my pda.
so, i set up my d-link usb adapter, can see the networks' signals within the software, but i am still unable to connect to any of them (and yes, the security is disabled on the networks i'm trying to connect to.)
i have winxp sp2 - perhaps there is a setting i need to change?
