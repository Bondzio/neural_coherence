1.1.1	Hello , I just wired each room with 3 cat5e cables ( 2 for internet and the other cat5e cable to wire 2 telephone lines ) , 2 rg6 cables .	St
1.1.2	all this wire terminates in one location in the basement where I am going to make all my connections .	St
1.1.3	I thought I would wire all my cat5e connections to a patch panel , but that does not seems to be all that I need to make all the connections work .	St
1.1.4	Do I need a switch ?	Ques
1.1.5	I take my connection out of the modem an run it into the switch ?	Ques
1.1.6	Managed/unmanaged switch ... I assume unmannaged .	St
1.1.7	I will be connection to Comcast internet ... something else I need ?	Ques
1.1.8	For Cable , I just run my source signal into a splitter and then make all my connections to the other end of the splitter ?	Ques
1.1.9	Something else I should consider ?	Ques
1.2.1	a router and maybe a switch .	St
1.2.2	Your modem connects to a router .	St
1.2.3	The router has two basic functions .	St
1.2.4	One is that it acts as a hardware firewall and the other is that it can pass out IP addresses to connected devices .	St
1.2.5	If you have more devices than your router has ports , you connect a switch to the router .	St
1.2.6	The switch can usually be of the un-managed type unless you have a special need such as to dedicate a certain amount of bandwidth to some device Each device must connect to it 's own port .	St
1.2.7	You can not wire any of them together if that 's what you mean by a splitter .	St
1.2.8	No splitting allowed .	St
1.2.9	You did say something about telephone lines .	St
1.2.10	Are these standard telephones or do you have bundled phone service on your cable ?	Ques
1.2.11	Otherwise , these have nothing to do with your network .	St
1.2.12	As for a patch panel , you really do n't need one unless you 're using the stiffer interior wall type Ethernet cable for the house wiring .	St
1.2.13	Hope this helps but feel free to post more about your objective .	St
1.3.1	Hey thanks ... OK If I connect a switch to a router , is that connected with a crossover cable or just a standard cable ?	Ques
1.3.2	Same with the Punch Panel to the switch ... standard or crossover cable ?	Ques
1.3.3	The splitters will be used for RG6 cable splitting and I was asking is this the way to route the cable the signal .	St
1.3.4	I have no telephone service yet , and not sure I will , but I was going to use 4 wires of one cat5 cable to wire one phone connection and the other 4 wires of the cat5 cable for the other phone line .	St
1.3.5	similarly I was going to use a 66 panel to wire all the phone lines .	St
1.4.1	Since most gear today is AUTO-MDX I rarely use a cross over .	St
1.4.2	Get straight cables for now .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 'm thinking that Cat5 is n't going to fit your 66 panel as the wire may be too thin .	St
1.5.2	It may be to small a gauge .	St
1.5.3	I 'd think you 'd need a 110 punch block or will need to use proper phone cable .	St
1.5.4	I 've never mixed them .	St
1.5.5	I did my own home with 66 block but I have POTS service .	St
1.5.6	As for your cable splitter , I presume you 're considering voice , data and TV signals .	St
1.5.7	I 'll leave this question to the cable company .	St
1.5.8	Bob gave the answer about crossover cables .	St
1.5.9	If your stuff is fairly new , it will detect and configure the up/down link .	St
1.5.10	You 'll know fairly quickly if something is n't right .	St
1.5.11	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	Well , I read that you could use cat5 cable for phone wire , but I guess that maybe there are complications with using , I guess I will have to find out .	St
1.6.2	One last question .	St
1.6.3	I wanted to place the router ( wireless ) between the upstairs and the downstairs .	St
1.6.4	This is before I learned that I needed a router and a switch .	St
1.6.5	Can I connect a wireless router somewhere in the house in addition to the router that I would have with my switch down in the basement ?	Ques
1.6.6	Seems that the basement is not the best of places to have the wireless positioned .	St
1.6.7	Or maybe I should run a wire from from the wireless router to the basement to connect to the switch and all my other connections .	Sug
1.6.8	Some other options ?	Ques
1.7.1	Put the router upstairs and just run a wire to it from the modem .	St
1.7.2	Do n't put a switch between the modem and router .	St
1.7.3	The switch is only to add additional ports beyond what the router provides .	St
1.7.4	If you need more wireless signal coverage you ad an additional access point ( AP ) which can actually be a router with the DHCP disabled .	St
1.7.5	You do n't want two routers trying to hand out addresses .	St
1.7.6	There is information about that in the forum sticky thread .	St
1.8.1	Just a small comment , Unless you really need all those jacks active in each room you can use a data jack as a phone jack .	St
1.8.2	The phone cables which use a small 6 pin connector will work just fine in the 8 pin data jacks .	St
1.8.3	You of course must connect the other end to a phone cable also .	St
1.8.4	Only the center 4 pin line up 3,4,5,6 line up with 2,3,4,5 .	St
1.8.5	This is the standard phone cable where the outer 2 pins are not used .	St
