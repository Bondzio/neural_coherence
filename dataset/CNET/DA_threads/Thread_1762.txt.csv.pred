1.1.2	It says it supports Pixel Shaders 2.0, but when I try to run my 7 year old's &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot; it won't run and gives me a mesage that it requires Pixel Shaders 1.1.	St

1.1.4	I have installed the latest drivers...	St

1.2.2	This is not unusual.	St
1.2.3	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.3.1	&lt;&lt;It's telling you to fade back to 1.1.	St
