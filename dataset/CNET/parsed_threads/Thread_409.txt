<s> It was working before about a couple of years ago. </s>
<s> But when I inserted a DVD yesterday, my computer would just not play it . </s>
<s> Why ? </s>
<s> a couple of reasons. </s>
<s> Not being used in a couple of years tells me the laser head is probably dirty. </s>
<s> Clean it. </s>
<s> Also, the formatting on today's DVDs may not be compatible with the player. </s>
<s> Check the doco and compare. </s>
<s> But my guess is it's just dirty. </s>
<s> Don't watch many movies?? </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> I was able to play CDs even yesterday. </s>
<s> If the laser is gone then it would not have played CDs' also right. </s>
<s> It also displays the DVD menu for some DVDs' its only that when I click the PLAY button nothing happens. </s>
<s> Also when I open the Sony provided DVD Player software &quot;Media bar&quot; I hear the DVD spinning and then the DVD spinning stops and the play button on the software gets disabled. </s>
<s> Does this suggest any other type of problem like software on my computer etc ? </s>
<s> an audio signal is not as complicated and playing an audio and video signal at the same time. </s>
<s> Have you tried cleaning the DVDs? </s>
<s> Use a soft all cotton cloth if you do, or a recommended cleaning kit. </s>
<s> You said that the player will bring up menus on some DVDs. </s>
<s> This still tells me that your player may not be able to play all the different DVD formats out there. </s>
<s> Please check this. </s>
<s> I am talking DVD+R, DVD-R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW. </s>
<s> Also, very carefully check the surfaces for scratches. </s>
<s> Have you tried playing the DVDs on a different player? </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Hi, Sorry for the late response. </s>
<s> The DVD I am trying to play is regular Hollywood DVD in DVD-video format (not +RW/-RW/+R/-R). </s>
<s> If it had been DVD-RW +RW etc I would have been doubtful if it would ever play on my SONY VIAO notebook computer (I donot think those formats do). </s>
<s> But since its a regular Hollywood DVD video, and my note book has a DVD-ROM drive and I have played DVD-videos a couple of years ago, it should very well play on my drive. </s>
<s> Since these videos play perfectly on my JVC DVD player, I dont think its an issue with the DVDs'. </s>
<s> I tried installing my DVD/CD driver by removing it in safe mode and letting the OS (Window 98) re-install by rebooting the computer. </s>
<s> It still does not work. </s>
<s> The DVD disc just spins initially when inserted and then stops and does nothing. </s>
<s> Even if I open the SONY provided media bar software to play the DVD, the PLAY button is disabled. </s>
<s> Does this give you any clues as to what could be the way to fix this problem and be able to enjoy the DVDs' on my laptop computer when I am travelling around rather than just sit at home and watch the DVDs' on the DVD-player. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> You have not mentioned what software you are using to view dvds, or os. </s>
<s> try reinstalling the software (power dvd etc) then give it another try, after that length of time any program can get corrupted. </s>
<s> I uninstalled the old &quot;media bar&quot; software and resintalled the media bar software yesterday from the SONY application recovery CD I have. </s>
<s> Even then , the DVD would not play. </s>
<s> The play button is always disabled. </s>
<s> Any more suggestions would help. </s>
<s> The recovery cd probably has an older version on it. </s>
<s> Go to Sony's website and download the updated version and install it. </s>
<s> Hang in there. </s>
<s> The fact that the play button is deactivated tells me the software is not recognizing that particular dvd as playable. </s>
<s> This could be either a hardware or software issue. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> My wife's Dell laptop uses an older DVD-rom and can only read &quot;DVD- &quot;, not the &quot;DVD +&quot;. </s>
<s> Check all of your documentation the came with you unit and it should say specifically what formats it will read. </s>
<s> When my friend and I purchased a 100 pack of the &quot;DVD -&quot; disks to archive a set of various data and entertainment files, we found that they would't play on her laptop or our bargain DVD player. </s>
<s> Had to go back and get some &quot;DVD -&quot; media and all now play on all the afore-mentioned players. </s>
<s> Try you docs first and then check for the format on the disks you want to plsy. </s>
<s> Your only so;ution may to upgrase to new player on your unit ...(if it is possible). </s>
<s> Notebooks and laptops are notoriusly un-upgradable. </s>
<s> Even after uninstalling and reinstalling SONY Media bar software from the recovery CD it didnot work. </s>
<s> So I searched around and found Power DVD is one of the best universal DVD players that usually works for most people with DVD play problems on computers. </s>
<s> So I installed Power DVD Version 6.0 and Microsoft DirectX 9.0 C. Both installations went fine. </s>
<s> But now what happens is Power DVD can recognize that I inserted a DVD video disc (I am not meaning any of the recordable DVD formats. </s>
<s> Just the plain old DVD videos). </s>
<s> Power dvd starts up and starts playing automatically unlike how my SONY Media bar software was behaving before. </s>
<s> So far so good. </s>
<s> However the problem is, I can see only symmetric rainbow colors playing over and over on the screen. </s>
<s> I can hear the DVD audio in the background. </s>
<s> But the video is just some symmetric random hazy array of shapes that repeat over and over again and again. </s>
<s> I donot see even a bit of the actual movie video. </s>
<s> I tried different movie DVDs'. </s>
<s> I get different patterns of symmetric shapes with different DVDs'. </s>
<s> Nothing more. </s>
<s> Does this suggest where the problem could be ? </s>
<s> Appreciate your help in advance. </s>
<s> u just clear the lens of the dvd drive and restart the desktop/laptop wat u have then u can play dvd on ur dvd drive. </s>
<s> good bye! </s>
<s> respond me if any further problems. </s>
