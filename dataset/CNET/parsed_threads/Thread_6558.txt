<s> If you followed the news, you knew the WEP, MAC address filters were ineffective and that hiding the network name or SSID only caused pain to you and your network. </s>
<s> Now with this news the question changes to if you really need to change from WPA. </s>
<s> My thought is the answer is &quot;Depends.&quot; Read the articles carefully and you discover that they can only crack WPA if the password is in the dictionary. </s>
<s> Your better passwords with leading and trailing numbers appear to fail to be cracked. </s>
<s> -&gt; The winners this round appear to be those that collect the 17 to 34 dollar fee. </s>
<s> This forum's sticky and advice here still looks good. </s>
<s> Remember that some can't make the leap to WPA2 yet. </s>
<s> If your WIFI is on WPA2 today and all is well you can take a nap for another year and check monthly for any news. </s>

<s> I have a new Compaq CQ61-313US Notebook with Windows 7 and a 2005 Netgear router that works fine. </s>
<s> I have the router set for WPA-PSK and a long passphrase with a combination of 10 letters and numbers. </s>
<s> I have my computer wireless network properties set for WPA-personal and encryption type TKIP. </s>
<s> When I changed the encryption to AES I lost my wireless connection so I changed it back to TKIP and got my connection back. </s>
<s> Should I change the WPA-personal to WPA 2-personal? </s>
<s> If so should I change the TKIP to AES or leave it on TKIP? </s>
<s> Would my router support this change? </s>
<s> Read the article again and decide. </s>
<s> I can't tell if your hardware supports it but it seems easy enough to try it and change back. </s>
