no her is the low down... i've got a main office using an netgear fvs114 router (which supports up to 8 vpn tunnels) i have another fvs114 router at a satellite office which is using a vpn tunnel to the &quot;main&quot; i am trying ad another vpn tunnel to the main office using either another fvs114 router or the netgear vpn client software.... now the satellite office and the main office vpn connection works fine... but when i try to add a new tunnel to the main office it will connect but will not be able to access any resources at the main office.
