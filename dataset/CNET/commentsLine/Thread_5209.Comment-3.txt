any new system smell should &quot;dissipate&quot; after a short time, within 1-2 days.
however, you never know it could take a week.
the very reason you smell anything suggest the case cooling it pushing out inside heat to include any smell.
the cpu itself does get warm, hot to some but that should all settle down.
if after a week it continues to smell or get worse, then just open case to increase venting and observe operation.
chemicals are very much the way of our life so don't discount it but keep an eye on it but imho i wouldn't worry about it unless it worsens or seems truly abnormal.
