My cousin just graduated with her nursing degree and wanted to clean up her computer. She backed up all of her pictures and handed over the laptop with all the discs that came with it. I formatted and installed a fresh new version of Windows XP on it. It is a Dell Inspiron 600m. I am at work with it open on my desk here. I have my own laptop and 2 monitors and one of the network switches is right under my desk. We also have 2 different wireless signals for just my company alone. I still cannot get internet. The laptop worked fine before I re-installed. I have gone to dell.com and downloaded the drivers, put them on my memory stick, moved them to her laptop and installed them. The wireless shows the networks available. I have put in my passwords and it says connected and signal strength excellent. i clicked on the internet explorer icon and it gave me the connections wizard. I chose to set up my connection manually and then connect to a network that is always connected or always on. Still nothing. No matter what page I get [Internet Explorer could not open the search page] Please help if you have any idea what I can do. I promised this back by Thanksgiving. Best, CV

The symbol changes also. That has nothing to do with the signal strength, but everything with not being given an IP-address by the wireless DHCP-server. You can check that with IPCONFIG or, usually, on the router management page. The usual cause is a non-matching encryption mode or encryption key or the MAC-address not passing the MAC-filtering on the router. Hope this helps. Kees

I've seen the &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; before on another computer, but I'm not getting that. It has also said wireless connection unavailable, but only for a few seconds and then it went back. I cannot get IPCONFIG to work. I must be doing it wrong, I'm hitting start&gt;run&gt; then typing IPCONFIG. I think that I may have the wrong Ethernet Driver. I am 100% certain that the cable I have hooked up to it is working (it was before.) There are so many network drivers on the support page for this laptop that I don't know what is right. Maybe if someone could look at that for me and make suggestions as far as the driver. I should at least be getting a wired signal.

If you are testing inside a company, chances are they have MAC filtering or some other wireless security implemented. Take the laptop to a coffee shop with Wifi or some other hotspot and check there. You won't get to surf until you have a password but if you reach their login page, you know you have good WLAN connection.

If that doesn't work it's most likely a driver problem. Given what you did, that could be motherboard drivers. Didn't there come something like a &quot;driver and utilities CD&quot; with the laptop? I'm afraid your on your own with regard to selecting the right drivers from the manufacturers site. I once managed it for a Lenovo T30 rather satisfactorily, because everything seems to work except the 'help'-key. Kees
