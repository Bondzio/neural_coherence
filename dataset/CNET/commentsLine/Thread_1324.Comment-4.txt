like i said, i wouldn't buy either because they are 'slimline' form factor and while reduced footprint has it's initial appeal ... it later means problems adding internal drives or higher performance peripherals (video comes to mind) not to mention the reduced form factor, reduced output psus.
cooling is another problems users often face using slim lines.
recognizing those limitations and forgoing hope of adding internals or gpus ... a slimline might work for you.
not me.
you can buy which ever you prefer however intel is clearly the better choice from a performance, energy use and heat generation.
good luck!
