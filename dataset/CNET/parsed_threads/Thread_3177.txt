<s> Hi, Don`t know if I can ask this here but maybe someone can help me. </s>
<s> I'f have a home sterio with nice 10&quot; speakers witch I connected to my pc for better sound with DVD's. </s>
<s> Problem is I can't come close to my screen, the magnets &quot;colorize&quot; my screen. </s>
<s> I would like to know if anyone know how I can try to Shield that speaker/box so I can get it closer to my screen? </s>
<s> Surely there must be some way to weeken the magnet's flied..Or am I haeding to a deadend?? </s>
<s> If someone can help, please let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks OOPS </s>
<s> thats is pretty bad if it discolors your monitor lol. </s>
<s> the speakers you bought, almost ALL new ones, should already be shielded. </s>
<s> personally, i would take back the speakers, if they're new, and buy shielded ones, ask the employees or read the box, or check the man. </s>

<s> that can sell you some sheets of MuMetal. </s>
<s> Surround the speaker boxes, maybe get away with putting it only on the side nearest the Monitor. </s>
<s> MuMetal is a metal that has a low Mu [greek letter, look it up]. </s>
<s> It has a very low impedance to the magnetic field and thus, in effect shorts out the magnetic field so that it doesn't spread far outside of the shield. </s>
<s> shield inside the speaker box to use less material and make a much more effective shield. </s>
<s> Plenty available in various shapes and articles about how to use it. </s>
<s> Go for it, become the CNET expert on the subject. </s>
