It is connected to my computer through USB 2.0. Because my internal hard diak already runs-out of disk space, I plan to install programs, applications and games to it. Is it possible or it's the same in terms of performance as an internal drive? Because I think external hard disk is only used for saving files (documents, pictures, music and videos) or for back-up purposes. Thanks in advance!

And it's less reliable. Your choice. Alternatives: - clean unnecessary files from your internal hard disk - install a second internal disk (not possible with a laptop, alas) - install a bigger internal disk than you have now - store other files on your external (but DON'T FORGET THE BACKUP!) in stead of these programs Kees
