<s> i am running windows xp with service pack 2 , and i am installing ATI Catalyst 5.3(the latest version) , My Card is &quot;ATI Radeon 9000&quot; , recently , In the middle of the games , the system reboots , i tried more than ane game but all are the same , after 15 to 30 mins of the game the machine reboots , and my processor's fan is working fine , this issue doesn't happen at all at applications except games , that's why i believe it's a driver issue ,the games i tried are C&C Generals , NHL 2005 and FIFA 2005 . </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> thanx in Advance </s>
<s> but it sounds a lot like an overheat issue. </s>
<s> Did you install the graphics card recently, or just update the drivers? </s>
<s> Even if the fan works, It could still be heating up from the increased load. </s>
<s> i guess so , but this is a new issue , if it was heating , it would have occured long time ago , i bought this card 2 years ago , and it worked fine until now </s>
<s> I would suggest reinstalling the drivers, just in case something went wrong on the install. </s>
<s> Also, if it works, install an older version of the driver. </s>
<s> Thats probably not the best solution, but it's a workaround at least. </s>
<s> Trust me, it's not a driver issue. </s>
<s> The problem lies somewhere else in the computer, not your graphics card. </s>
<s> Games and other very large applications tend to use a lot of memory, and will crush if you don't have enough ram. </s>
<s> When a GPU overheats, you start seeing artifacts. </s>
<s> It won't prompt the computer to restart immediately. </s>
