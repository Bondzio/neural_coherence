1.1.1	hi, I was looking at getting the Western digital raptor, but I was told for how much it is, it really not worth it.	St
1.1.2	I'm doing gaming on my PC, and I don't need more than 150 GB space.	St
1.1.3	so, I geuss what I'm asking is it better to buy the raptor, or get a 7200 RPM, hard drive?	St
1.1.4	My specs, Asus M2N-E SLI, AMD 64 X2 3800+ thermaltake PurePower 430 watts Xion 4 case, EVGA 8600 GTS	St
1.2.1	that's 90% as fast as a raptor.	St
1.2.2	and your cpu and video card are holding back your gaming performance, not the hard drive.	St
1.3.1	alright thanks, I know I need to upgrade my CPU, but whats wrong with the graphic card?	St
1.4.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/2008/03/05/the_best_gaming_graphics/	St
1.5.1	a 9600gt will double your framerates in unreal tourney 3, cod4, bioshock, and of course, crysis.	St
1.6.1	thats proably true, but I can't afford the 8800 series, and I play Battle for middle earth2 and it can run it maxed settings.	St
1.6.2	No lag	St
1.7.1	when you talk about bang for buck,I payed $90 fro the EVGA 8600 GTS.	St
1.7.2	so its still a good deal for that.	St
