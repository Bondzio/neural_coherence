1.1.1	I have an older 74gb 10,000rpm Raptor drive with a 1.5gb SATA connection and a 2tb 7200rpm with a 6gb SATA connection.	St
1.1.2	The Raptor has much faster read and seek times, but a smaller cache and smaller bandwidth to the mobo.	St
1.1.3	What to to??	St
1.1.4	?	Ques
1.2.1	The usual result is seek times trump the faster transfer rates.	St
1.3.1	I can install on both and compare the boot times...	St
1.3.2	I've spent wnough on this project as it is, but the other option is to bye a solid state drive for the sole purpose of hosting Win 7	St
1.4.1	I've seen some users go the SSD route and are happy as long as everything is working.	St
1.4.2	That's not a given, as the SSD drive can crap-out with no clue that it would.	St
1.4.3	The usual cure is to replace the drive.	St
1.4.4	Overall, IMO it works well other than what I stated.	St
1.4.5	Recovery of any data is on par for any device like a flash drive.	St
1.4.6	For now though, I would recommend continued use of a SATA type HD.	St
1.4.7	They're at the top of they're form and seem to be just as good as SSD minus the speed.	St
1.4.8	However, that speed difference isn't going to really be noticed until intensive tasks like audio&video editing may come into it.	St
1.4.9	As for game play, that too isn't all that impressive.	St
1.4.10	Game forums/websites aren't really pushing SSD other than bragging rights.	St
1.4.11	However, for OS usage, it works well.	St
1.4.12	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	I appreciate that info Willie, I'll probably stick with one of the SATA drives for now if not only for $$$ purposes... Did you have any opinion or technical reasons for me to decide on the Raptor drive or the 6bg SATA drive?	St
1.6.1	6Gb i/f is the highest level and if your PC supports it why not use it.	St
1.6.2	Until the corrected Sandy Bridge and complete chipsets arrive, other mtrbd.	St
1.6.3	chipsets will do and they do good.	St
1.6.4	Since, you have 6Gb ability and if HD is capable, use it.	St
1.6.5	I see no reason, not to at least I don't.	St
1.6.6	If you do some reviewing and checking, IMO most users just don't see great improvements, however it is there.	St
1.6.7	If it was my system I tend to lean towards stability/reliability issues.	St
1.6.8	My tasks are simple or relatively so, so I'm easily pleased.	St
1.6.9	But, if some spec means more to you, then get it.	St
1.6.10	I don't think I can expand anymore on the topic.	St
1.6.11	good luck -----Willy	Polite
1.7.1	Thanks very much	Polite
