I have a &quot;D-LINK&quot; cable router with 4 port.
I have 2 PC's, both XP-home and an Xbox.
I've had no problems for about 2 years until yesterday when an error message said &quot;Cable not connected&quot;.
Same message on all 3.
I checked all the cables and they worked fine when not using the router.
I saw a reset button on the router, nothing.
What should I look at now?
A new router?
I'm hoping someone has an idea.
Thanks
