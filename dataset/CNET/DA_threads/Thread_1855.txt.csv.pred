1.1.1	Here 's a little mystery for anyone interested .	St
1.1.2	Built a desktop a year ago ( AMD athlon duo core 5200+ ) .	St
1.1.3	Came with a motherboard disk full of drivers .	St
1.1.4	These all worked perfectly with a new speaker set I had ( central subwoofer that plugs into the back of the computer with two tweeters that are plugged into the subwoof ) .	St
1.1.5	Perfect sound .	St
1.1.6	1 year later I have a hard drive crash and have to reinstall everything including the audio driver ( Realtek HD audio driver 5.10.0.5443 ) .	St
1.1.7	I do n't remember the desktop icon or application ever being on my xp activity bar ( whatever you call the list of active program icons at the bottom right of the screen ) , but it 's now there .	St
1.1.8	Coincidentally , the exact same speaker setup no longer works .	St
1.1.9	I 've fiddled with every possible configuration of settings and plug-ins , but the best I can do is to get the subwoofer to work by itself , and only if the tweeters are not plugged into it .	St
1.1.10	The audio driver app is set to line-out ( not subwoofer ) when this works .	St
1.1.11	No other combination of plugging in the tweeters by themselves , use of different back panel plugs , settings for different speaker channel number , output sampling rate or output source settings will work .	St
1.1.12	So , it worked before , but does n't work now .	St
1.1.13	I 've uninstalled , reinstalled , checked for different ways it could be installed , driver updates , different motherboard disk audio options , etc ... .but nothing helps .	St
1.1.14	Other possibly relevant evidence : Some types of internet videos apps do n't seem to play audio .	St
1.1.15	Earphones work perfectly ( when plugged into the earphone jack on the subwoof -- actually a little hub halfway up the cord ) The realtek audio diver does n't actually seem to have a channel setup ( subwoof + two tweets ) that correspond my ( extremely common ) setup ... .only options are 2,4,6 channels and headphones .	St
1.1.16	Anyone who solves this problem will get my eternal thanks and a check in the mail for services rendered .	St
1.1.17	Real-tek hater , Ph.D	St
1.2.1	In order to assist you with your situation ; we need a bit more information ( ie : mobo make/ model , videocard , RAM ... that sort of thing ) , thinking it might still be a driver issue , but will know more after some research .	St
