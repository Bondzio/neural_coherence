If the old hard drive is reasonably sound and you have an external case, you can buy a new drive and clone the notebooks HD to a new drive in the external case.
You may have to deal with partition resizing but you just replace the newly cloned drive with the failing one.
The method I've used is to create an image of the old drive onto a USB external drive.
I then put a bare drive in PC and restore the image to that drive.
In either case you need such as a CD/DVD ROM drive to boot the cloning software.
I use Acronis True Image but there are others out there.
