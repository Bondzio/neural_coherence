thru many posts and you have yet to give me a straight answer to my problem.
you promise to take off the gloves and the sugar coating, but that's all you do is promise.
where is the solution?
please, where is the solution to my original question.
stop telling me how much you know and others know and answer my question.
what is the best way to back up my hard drive without losing my software and data files since my cd drives don't work?
i have used pc relocator and i am looking for a way to do the same job as it does without having to buy a new computer.
i can't make it any clearer.
i give up.
