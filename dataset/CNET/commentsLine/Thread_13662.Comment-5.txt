put the driver files in a folder of your choice.
call it &quot;modem&quot; if you wish.
go to add/remove hardware but don't let windows search for new devices but use the &quot;have disk&quot; option.
point to the driver in the folder you used.
it should display the modem.
sometimes driver utils cover several models so you need to have an idea of what it is.
select the right model.
windows will alert you if it doesn't match any of your hardware.
if it's a match, install it and see what happens.
