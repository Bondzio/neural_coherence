1.2.1	& quot ; One of the computers has the printer shared to the laptop when i go to print and i am not sure why since I did not share it. & quot ; See if you can explain this sentence a little clearer .	St

1.6.1	First a word from Microsoft about the & quot ; Network Neighborhood & quot ; or NN for short .	St
1.6.2	& quot ; Note If a computer is removed from the network before the computer is logged off the network , it may take up to 45 minutes for that computer to be removed from the browse list. & quot ; http : //msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp ? url=/archive/en-us/dnarwnet/html/msdn_browse3.asp This annoys many in that the NN is not realtime .	St
1.6.3	Even if you had shared this printer for just a split second , it could have been picked up by another machine .	St
1.6.4	Further documents show that the NN may hold such for days or weeks .	St
