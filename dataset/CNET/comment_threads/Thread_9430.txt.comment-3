Bill, thanks for your explanation.
It taught me enough that I was able to do a helpful search.
mDNSResponder provides Bonjour service usnig UDP Port 53.
When that doesn't answer, it uses a random port to offer the service.
Since that application is reading port 53, it is safe to open it.
Now I've done that and the message is gone.
