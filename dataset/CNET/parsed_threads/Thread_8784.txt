<s> Hi, I'm getting a new computer and was wondering if there was a easy way to transfer all the programs and files from my old computer to my new one. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> Happy Holidays, </s>
<s> You'll need to install any programs or applications. </s>
<s> Data files can be transferred several different ways depending on the total disk space they occupy now. </s>
<s> CDs, DVDs, flash/jump/thumb/pen drives, external HDDs, etc., Believe this has been well covered numerous time here on CNET ...let us know if you can't find it. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> what OS, or even if these are MACs, all I can think of is the &quot;Files and Settings Transfer Wizard&quot;. </s>
