It came installed with a x1900 card. This was 2 months ago and I am STILL fighting with them to get the right card. The card they sent in my system is worth 1/2 the card I paid for. If you purchased from Gateway you better open your case and see what they gave you!!!!!! I hope you got what you paid for. I did not!!

I contacted the BBB about it and Gateway responded to BBB that I ordered a x1900. The X1900 was not even an option on the system.( I have my order form) I explained that to the BBB. Waiting for final response. Anyway beware!!!!!
