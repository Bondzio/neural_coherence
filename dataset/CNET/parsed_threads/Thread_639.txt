<s> 200 MHz P55C Intel Pentium MMX CPU, 64Mb SIMM 72pin EDO RAM, Asus SP97-V motherboard,Win98se OS, 245watt AT power supply, 2 Western Digital 2.5Gb & 8Gb(8Gb partitioned into 4 logic drives) hard drives, Sony CDROM drive, AT mini-tower case, 5.25 & 3.5 floppy drives, ISA modem, PCI S3 Stealth V64 video card, and a ISA SB16 sound card. </s>
<s> Put this system together by parting out of 3 win95 based computers. </s>
<s> System will be used for retro games, Office 97 applications, out-going email, and faxing. </s>
<s> I have the system running stable, that means restarts from win98 shut down menu cause freeze on shut down screen and soft boot during startup(pre windows loading) cause freeze. </s>
<s> I configured the hard drives to be on the same primary IDE cable, 0 as master, 1 as slave, and put the CDROM on its own secondary cable as a slave. </s>
<s> The system would boot showing the drives as present and working on the next boot the slave drive failed to be recognized. </s>
<s> The pattern was hard drives okay, good boot, and the next boot, bad boot, un-recognized slave drive with reduced computer speed. </s>
<s> I re-configured the CDROM to be on the same primary IDE cable as the master hard drive, and put the slave drive on its own secondary cable. </s>
<s> The boot with un-recognized slave hard drive went away and the system is stable. </s>
<s> What is going on here? </s>
<s> Why cant I get a stable system with the hard drives located on the same IDE cable? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> This was a known issue with some older systems. </s>
<s> The cause was most commonly tracked down to a BIOS issue. </s>
<s> See if you can find if it has been updated. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Another trick I use is to use 80 conductor cables and follow the jumper rules to the letter. </s>
<s> There are some that will try non-standard jumpering ideas but I leave them to experiment. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I will check on the BIOS version and update if I need to. </s>
<s> I will try the 80 wire cable. </s>
<s> Is this a fix? </s>
<s> On top of the WD 8Gb drive (jumpered as slave) there is a note about if used with a 2Gb drive a special jumper settings maybe needed and the diagram shows an additional jumper placed on the pins beside the slave pins. </s>
<s> Ill get the drive model numbers and see if WD has any info on this. </s>
<s> Get rid of Windows 98 - unless your that nostalgic. </s>
<s> Worn-out W98 installation CDs will cause this because you never get a clean reinstall. </s>
<s> The exact same thing happened to me. </s>
<s> Also, reconfigure your jumpers to original setups. </s>
<s> Just how old is that CPU? </s>
<s> I have resolved the problem,thanks to you. </s>
<s> I decided to use an 80 wire cable instead of the 40 wire IDE cable, as you indicated. </s>
<s> When I pulled the drives out I found a black jumper (not visible while drive was in computer) as well as the white jumper I installed to set the drive to master. </s>
<s> The additional jumper must have been from previous installation of the drive in another computer where the alternate jumper setting was needed. </s>
<s> I pulled the jumper off and re-installed the drives using the 80 wire IDE cable. </s>
<s> The drives are working fine now and seem quieter. </s>
<s> You gotta say it or the magic won't stick. </s>
<s> Thanks for the report back and best of continued self made luck. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well it shipped with Win95 & Win3.1 drivers. </s>
<s> My guess is 1997 date of manufacture. </s>
<s> It was a Win95 system when I got it(donated as a pen2, later learned it was a pen MMX). </s>
<s> I put in a used drive, just to see if the system worked at all. </s>
<s> 5 years later, fix or part out time. </s>
<s> So Im rebuilding it as Retro System. </s>
<s> I couldnt get a stable system with the additional drive in the location I wanted. </s>
<s> I pulled the drives out I found a black jumper (not visible while drive was in computer) as well as the white jumper I installed to set the drive to master. </s>
<s> I decided to use the 80 wire cable because I wanted to see if it would work. </s>
<s> I pulled the jumper off and re-installed the drives using the 80 wire IDE cable. </s>
<s> The drives are working fine now and seem quieter. </s>
<s> The system is stable. </s>
<s> As to the use of win98se, I cant install ME because the CPU is below 250 MHz. </s>
<s> I have a Linux live CD I will try, but if you can think of another OS please feel free to post. </s>
