i just loaded on vista rc2, and was all excited to try out the new vista media center with it, since i have never used media center before.
vista automatically installed some drivers that were dated and signed as of 6/21 which is newer than the drivers on this page  when it loads up, the screen is all snowy, i can hear some audio from the station, and only barely make out anything.
i tried to fore it and load the older drivers from the hauppauge page on, but then it said after when i got into media center that my tv tuner wasn't supported.
i was pretty sure there was support for my hauppauge 500 in vista 64 anyone have any idea to help me get it working?
thanks, ~j
