<s> I have two PC's, one desktop and one laptop, they work fine together when they are using the Internet, but when I go online with my PS3, and the laptop connects, the PS3 disconnects, I'm thinking about the Port Forwarding feature, but I don't know how to use it, I connect to the router wired with the PS3 and wirelessly with the laptop, so why. </s>
<s> I use the Netgear WGR614 v6 Router, updated to the latest firmware. </s>
<s> I just can't think of anyway around this other than Port Forwarding, someone help. </s>
<s> the router back to factory defaults. </s>
<s> Then explore the Netgear documentation about setting up the PS3. </s>
<s> Port Forwarding should not be a default setting. </s>
<s> I think it has to do with IP Address errors, is there a way to change and keep the same IP with the computer so I don't get a conflict with logging in with the same account. </s>
<s> each device's MAC address to a specific IP address. </s>
<s> I don't know how Linksys does it, but look at the configuration setup. </s>
<s> My main PC and my web server have their addresses locked in my D-link router. </s>
<s> It's under DHCP reservations. </s>
