you have what is a rather large budget for a video updgrade - much more than you need to &quot;something nice, not state of the art but id like to be able to run newer games with out a problem&quot;.

this site has good information about defining wants, system requirements, non-gaming and gaming cards, reviews, and installing video cards at:  it will give you a good general information on upgrading your video card and a link to excellent sources.
one top link is to the list of the best video cards at each budget level at thg - it includes a brief but very helpful description of which each will buy you:  based on what little info you have provided, i think you are in the range of the gtx 560 - which is on the above list at the $190 level.
i recommend this evga (excellent brand) card at $175 after rebate:  you might also be interested in reading a reviews about the gtx 560 card and about mid-level cards in general:   as you can see in the article about the gtx 560 - at load the total system usage was 150w - 200w at factory settings.

this also assumes you have a good psu.
what brand and model do you have?
