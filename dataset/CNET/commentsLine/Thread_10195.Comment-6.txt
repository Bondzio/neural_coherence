laser printers are workhorses and sometimes they're &quot;whipped pretty bad&quot;.
they are though entirely rebuildable and unlike many other devices a &quot;repair kit&quot; usually are available and yes it has to be done on some maintenance cycle.
afterall, you got your money's worth, imho.
i have a 4p model that just chugs along and i got it used.
excluding a real dumpster of a laser like one used in a steel mill, factory floor most desk(office) lasers can be rejuvenated and continue to work.
however, there are some basic new lasers for small cost and with reasonable use can last 2-3yrs.
no problem, but then a new replacement will be the pipeline rather than a repair vs. new cost.
good luck tada -----willy
