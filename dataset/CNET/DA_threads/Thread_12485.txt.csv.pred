1.1.3	full while the single black is full.	St
1.1.4	Replacement of the cyan and black tanks cost $31.11 for just one month of light use and no intentional color printing.	St
1.1.5	This would mean more than $300 for one year, more than the printer cost!	St
1.1.6	You do the math for the life of the printer!	St
1.1.7	Contact with Canon technical support confirms my set up was in accordance with their recommended for black and white text.	St

1.2.1	The 1/2 did not get printed for some reason lack of font I guess.	St
1.2.2	Above should be changed to read xxxxxxx &quot;M and Y tanks 1/2 full while the single black is full.&quot;xxxxxx.	St
1.2.3	Sorry	St
1.3.1	While my Canon mx870 doesn't do that the recurring lesson is if you want cheap BW printing you get a laser.	St
1.3.2	I didn't read if you had set it to Grayscale Printing.	St
1.3.3	If not you may find the printer using color ink to create what looks like black from the color tank.	St
