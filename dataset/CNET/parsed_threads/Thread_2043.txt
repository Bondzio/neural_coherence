<s> I have a small network. </s>
<s> Main PC with XP Home acts as server to Dell Laptop with XP Pro and a second PC with XP Home. </s>
<s> These were all linked with a Cable connected BT wireless router into Ethernet mini switch which was then connected to Laptop, Server PC and second PC with ethernet cables. </s>
<s> All were able to see each other and all were able to access internet and mail individually. </s>
<s> I now have the router wirelessly connected to the server which links to other PC's via ethernet cables to mini switch. </s>
<s> All units can see each other and Server can access mail and internet. </s>
<s> But second PC and laptop are now unable to connect to internet or mail. </s>
<s> The server is now and has always been protected with Zone Alarm. </s>
<s> Sorry for length of this but needed you to understand the connections. </s>
<s> Am I now missing something? </s>
<s> Grateful for advice, Peter </s>
<s> My first question is what do you mean by one computer being your &quot;server?&quot; This machine was giving your other computers internet access? </s>
<s> If you are using a router of some kind, that should be giving all of your systems access to the internet. </s>
<s> I guess I am just a little confused on exactly how you have your systems configured. </s>
<s> Were you using internet connection sharing or something? </s>
