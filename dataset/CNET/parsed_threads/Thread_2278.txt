<s> Hello and thank you for taking a look at this. </s>
<s> I am planning on building a cheap budget gaming computer. </s>
<s> This computer is not intended for extreme gaming like far Cry or Call of Duty 2, just games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and other basic games. </s>
<s> I already have the follow: eVGA Geforce 6200 AGP 8x Reusing a 40GB HDD Windows XP Home DVD ROM Aspire X-Alien Case (Not the $135 one, the steel one.) </s>
<s> All products above and below will be purchased from Newegg.com , the best site on the net for computer parts!!!! </s>
<s> Anyways.................. My question is will this motherboard and CPU work together; also, will this memory be compatible with the mb and CPU? </s>
