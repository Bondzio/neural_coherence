The PC is bought from Mesh Computers (online) it said when I purchased it that it had Intergrated 7.1 surround sound, I'm not sure if this is suitable or not... And is there any images of the types of connection I would need for both screen and Headphones?
It would be a little difficult to get a decent image of the back of my PC atm... thanks for the quick reply by the way
