hi folks- duo pro drive 2tb drive will not mount.
got disk warrior to rebuild the desktop once, but disk utility can't mount or repair now and techtool pro 4 tells me &quot;failed.
bitmap mismatch.
(-90) mac ox leopard intel any work around?
suggestions?
feedback?
what may have caused this?
i thought it might be an overheating problem so i have an ice pack on it!
(it actually mounted this way once!)
lol
