I pulled the HDD from my MP3 player and connected it to my laptop via USB IDE.
The wizard connects and informs me that my new hardwear is ready.
But i can not find the HDD in MY Computer.
But i can find the HDD in the device manager.
Can anyone help me reformat it so i can use it as a external memory device.
