1.1.1	The HP seems to have a better processor and much larger hard drive.	St
1.1.2	I plan on playing some games such as CoD4 and using Photoshop CS3.	St
1.1.3	I would also like to have the option to have the tv tuner thing which the hp has and the dell charges extra for.	St
1.1.4	Seem like a better buy with the HP but the dell may let me expand more down the road easily.	St
1.1.5	Any experience or ideas are appreciated?	Ques

1.3.1	The HP has a faster and cooler runnign processor, a faster hard drive with more than twice the capacity, a better sound card, built-in HDTV tuner and record, but a weaker video card.	St
1.3.2	The 8600GT can struggle in games unless you're willing to turn down the resolution and the effects/detail level.	St
1.3.3	To make the HP a good gamer, you'd need to upgrade to at least a 9600GT and replace its 350W power supply with a 450+W unit.	St
1.3.4	Palit 9600gt, $150 before $30 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814261002 OCZ Stealth 500W, $60 before $20 rebate: http://www.buy.com/prod/ocz-500w-stealthxstream-power-supply/q/loc/101/206526699.html	St
1.4.1	Which means SLI compatibility.	St
1.4.2	The PSU has more leeway as well.	St
1.4.3	It is the better gaming PC, especially if you think a couple of years ahead.	St
1.4.4	You'll be able to drop a price-dropped faster 1333Mhz FSB chip in there, and also slap in a second 8800GT (or a single power-hungry card) in there to keep your gaming current.	St
1.4.5	As far as the gaming experience right now is concerned, the Q6600+8800GT combo will also slay a Q9300+8600GT.	St
