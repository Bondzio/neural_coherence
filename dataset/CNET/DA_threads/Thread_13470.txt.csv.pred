1.1.1	this is a noob question , but what power supply is needed for Athlon 64 ?	Ques
1.2.1	The ATXV12 of the latest spec 2.01 or later is used by all CPUI 's , However , there is a new kicker , which depends on the mobo , the normall connector PS to mobo was 20 Pins , now the newer mobos use 24 pins .	St
1.2.2	Thus you should now what the mobo takes and then buy a power supply that has the correct connector .	St
1.2.3	Most PS 's with a 24 pin connector provide a 24 to 20 adapter cable with them .	St
1.2.4	Re power rating of the supply go 450 watts or better , this is nad business on my part , you really should tell us what the system will have on it .	St
1.2.5	It is possible that you might more than 450 watts to give the supply some operating margin .	St
1.3.1	Ok i also was looking to upgrade my PSU .	St
1.3.2	After checking Newegg i seen the 24 pin one but they also list a 20+4 pin .	St
1.3.3	Are they the same or will we burn our Mobo up if we get the wrong one ? ?	Ques
1.3.4	?	Ques
1.4.1	NIL	St
