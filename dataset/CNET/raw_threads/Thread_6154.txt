I upgraded my computer about an hour ago, by installing a Zotac gtx 650 Ti (drivers were installed correctly) and a a Rosewill RD600 Stallion Series psu. computer worked as it is supposed to for a good 30 minutes. However, when I entered a second game to test settings, my computer completely crashed. No bluescreen or anything, it just instantly shut off. Now when I simply turn the psu on my system makes the first sound it normally does when it boots, but then the cpu fan turns on to full blast. No follow-on beeps, just the cpu fan running full speed. I have never heard it this loud before. I do not get any video output to my monitor, and the led on the power button of my case doesn't even light up, as if the computer isn't even turned on. I upgraded this factory model from gateway DX4840-03e The specs for this system are -1 TB HDD -Intel i3 540 cpu running at ~3.1 Ghz -8 GB RAM Thanks in advance for the help.

That way I can see if the original gear is still OK. Also, you can get out your Volt meter and check the CMOS Battery. You want to read 3 or a little more Volts. Bob

If that works, replace the P/S first and I suspect it won't work. The fan on the CPU comes on fast at first but should be reduced quickly when the BIOS loads, otherwise it will run at full speed. This tells me the 5 volts has failed but the 12 volts is okay.

9711	5	598364	5483189	5483185	shavener	8/1/13 3:58 PM	1.37537268E12	Found the source.	The problem was the power supply as mjd420nova suggested. I'm not sure why. I did find this http://www.cputopia.com/psu-replacement-gate-gateway-dx4840.html psu that is meant specifically for my model computer. Would you recommend buying this? The only reason I'm asking is because I'm skeptical about any other psu working with my mobo. Was the one I just bought an isolated case?

9711	7	598364	5483211	5483183	shavener	8/1/13 4:00 PM	1.3753728E12	That was it.	That was right. So was that an isolated incident with only that psu or will my computer reject every new one I try to install, for instance this http://www.cputopia.com/psu-replacement-gate-gateway-dx4840.html

9711	9	598364	5483213	5483220	R. Proffitt	8/1/13 4:05 PM	1.3753731E12	It's on the web so a short answer.	A single +12V RAIL means you don't need to check into if one or more rails could be overtaxed by your GPU or other choices. You also don't have to take care for run the one rail to your GPU then the others to drives and such. That's called balancing the rails, well discussed and most folk burst into flames when they find out about this. Bob
