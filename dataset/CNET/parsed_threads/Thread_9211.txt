<s> Hello, I have a computer from about 97 and then a brand new one I purchased this year. </s>
<s> I installed XP on the old one recently and all it did was install over all my old files which is not what I wanted. </s>
<s> So now I want to format it because is beginning to run slowly. </s>
<s> I have about 400-500 mp3's that I do not want to lose. </s>
<s> I have a cd burner on the old pc but it can not burn in dvd format like my new pc. </s>
<s> So I'm trying to figure out some way I can do this. </s>
<s> (the cheapest way) Both computers have ethernet cards so I could connect them together. </s>
<s> What cords would i need and could someone explain the process. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> i did this about a week ago...get yourself a crossover cable ($10)and connect the two pcs via the ethernet ports... if you don't have a more detailed response tonight i'll post again later with specifics when i get home... </s>
<s> check your network setting on both systems...the ip's need to be the same up until the last set of numbers which should be one off... for example: new pc: xxx.xxx.xxx.100 old pc: xxx.xxx.xxx.101 then make sure the subnet mask is the same on both. </s>
<s> use your winxp cd to setup a home office network on both machines...while doing this you need to name both machines (ex. </s>
<s> oldpc and newpc)and name your workgroup, this must be the same on both machines, (ex. </s>
<s> home). </s>
<s> now go to the folder(s) on the old machine and right click on the folder you want to share...then click on the option for sharin and allow sharing. </s>
<s> reboot and go to your network on the new machine. </s>
<s> you should see oldpc on your network. </s>
<s> you can now access the files on the shared folder and cut/copy them to your new machine... i did this from memory but i'm pretty sure these are the steps i took last week... hth. </s>
<s> where should i get the cable? </s>
<s> We have a store around here called NF computers or something but they wanted 15 dollars and they are closed already. </s>
<s> (im in central time, tennessee) Any big name stores carry it? </s>
<s> (walmart, bestbuy, circuit city, etc) Thanks a lot for the reply! </s>
<s> will have the cable. </s>
