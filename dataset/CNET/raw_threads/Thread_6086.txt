All you need is the display port adapter, from the Apple store, with the correct connection for your LED monitors. The extension cables that you need are then just ordinary, very long, video cables with the correct connections at each end. For example: Display port adapter to DVI, then long DVI to DVI extension cables, then DVI to monitor. Did you get the NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 with 512MB of GDDR3 memory with Mini DisplayPort and dual-link DVI video output option? That has two DVI ouputs. If so, then all you need is the long DVI cable.
