i don't know about having to add an adapter to most of the new laptops now a days, unless i have been confused about this as well.
for most of the new laptops if it says they have wireless airport technology(apple) or wireless centrino built in, doesn't this mean that the notebooks are ready to go?
for instance, i know my powerbook has an 802.11 g and b capability built in.
i don't need to buy a receiver along with the router and plug that into the notebook do i?
thanks.
