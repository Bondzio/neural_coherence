my buisness has 8 hardwired computers, 2 wireless computers and a server to connect together.
currently we have an 8 port switch: netgear g5608 and a wireless access point: netgear wg602 v3, to connect all together.
does anyone have any suggestions for an update to these two?
i'm trying to combine it all into one, making it easier to maintain.
