<s> This past Monday, my house suffered severe smoke damage from a fire, with the third floor getting most of the damage. </s>
<s> My Sony Vaio, which is my main computer and was bought 3 months ago, was on the first floor and I need to access it for information. </s>
<s> In addition, I had to two other usable computers on the third floor. </s>
<s> What do I need to do in order to clean all 3 PCs up so that they can be accessed and/or used again? </s>
<s> I know soot is a conductor for electricity and I don't want to short any of them out. </s>
<s> In addition, I do not have the money to take them anywhere to get any diagnostics done, either. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP! </s>
<s> Same thing here in 2001. </s>
<s> Smoke is very acidic besides the carbon being a conductor. </s>
<s> I lost a PC, scanner, monitor, and printer to smoke and heat, no direct fire. </s>
<s> The acidic nature of the smoke will cause extreme corrosion on all connections. </s>
<s> But I was able to salvage my HD. </s>
<s> HDs are sealed against most problems. </s>
<s> You may be able to salvage the HD if you can put it into another PC as a slave drive and recover data. </s>
<s> But the other parts will be lost. </s>
<s> My insurance replaced the PC and peripherals and I was able to put the old HD into the new one and recover my important stuff. </s>
<s> Good luck, Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks. </s>
<s> Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections and data, and download free software. </s>
<s> If the systems have only soot or smoke damage, the HDs themselves are pretty robust as they're sealed against the outside world. </s>
<s> Get a working system with some type of back-up, install the HDs as a 2nd HD. </s>
<s> The working system should contain the same OS for ease of use and retrieve the data that way. </s>
<s> However, extreme heat is a bad thing is so found, you have slim chance on your own, decide on a professional service or not. </s>
<s> To clean the system themselves to need to blow them out &quot;easily&quot; not a super charged blower as that can cause ionized charge to develope. </s>
<s> Use a hand blower like those found at camera shops. </s>
<s> With disassembled system, immerse the mtrbd. </s>
<s> with any removable chips(ram, cpu, and bios, use ESD care), and wash in denatured alcohol or 90% rubbing alcohol. </s>
<s> DO NOT use a true solvent for cleaning. </s>
<s> Blow dry abit and allow to air dry. </s>
<s> Pitch the power supply unless you want to take a chance. </s>
<s> The FD should be pitched as well. </s>
<s> The kybd, monitor, etc. </s>
<s> is an eyeball thing, check but if in thought, pitch them. </s>
<s> A short or something along those lines will be more costly than a simple replacement. </s>
<s> I repeat take the HDs out and use a known good system to retrieve data to back-up that data. </s>
<s> Once data is safe, you can then rebuild the old systems. </s>
<s> If this is too much to do, then what is your data worth??? </s>
<s> No short cuts... tada -----Willy </s>
