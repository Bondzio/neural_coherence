hi, i ran chkdsk (checkdisk) on my hd and it came out clean.
then after my computer restarted, i checked the event viewer and this time, the error didn't come up when the computer started.
i restarted again and still no error.
at first i thought that chkdsk fixed it but then i remembered that right before i ran chkdsk, i uninstalled a program called msi live update.
it is a program that was on my graphics card utility cd that is supposed to update the vga drivers with one click.
the program has been nothing but trouble to me on my computer.
i have had previous experiences where the program causes (different) warnings in event viewer related to security threats and stuff.
the program sometimes causes missing dll error messages too, so i got tired of it and completely uninstalled it.
anyway, if i need new drivers, i'd much rather use msi live update online (its the same as live update except you run it on the web so no modifications to your computer are made.
anyway, i don't know what fixed it (for now), checkdisk or uninstalling msi live update.
i'm still not 100% sure the problem's gone though.
i'll post back if it comes back.
thanks for all the help
