<s> My 3-year old motherboard (Soyo K7VTAPro with an AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1.33ghz processor) recently died. </s>
<s> I have purchased an ASUS MB P5P800 865PE and a P4/2.8 GHz LGA775 processor to replace the old system. </s>
<s> I would like to re-use my old HD (running XP Home)which is fairly new. </s>
<s> What is the best way to get the HD to work in the new system? </s>
<s> Should I reformat and start all over again? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> Saves some work. </s>
<s> Here's how -&gt; http://www.jsifaq.com/SUBM/tip6300/rh6326.htm Bob </s>
<s> R. Proffitt, So i would have the old install on one partition and the new install on a 2nd partition? </s>
<s> After the parallel install I could then go back and reformat the partition which has the old XP to bring it up to date? </s>
<s> Just trying to get a handle on what a parallel install does for me. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> In fact, if you stick with the same partition, you can at your leisure delete the old OS and keep going. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You should in fact be able to just run the new pc on the old os, you just need to install all of the drivers for the new system. </s>
<s> at least that will get the machine going so that you can have time to backup and look at formating the drive at a later date. </s>
<s> I agree. </s>
<s> Install the old drive as Master, switch the new one to slave, get to your old Windows XP and format the new drive. </s>
<s> Why do you need to install windows again? </s>
<s> I thought the point of keeping the old drive is both getting extra storage and have your old settings completely intact. </s>
<s> When you boot up XP will not want to book. </s>
<s> You can use your install CD and the repair option to fix XP. </s>
<s> then install the new MB drivers. </s>
<s> Here is a link with info. </s>
