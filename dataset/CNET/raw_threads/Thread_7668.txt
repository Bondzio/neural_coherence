I found this website (www.pendrivelinux.com) which shows how to install linux on a pen drive. I downloaded the linux version and followed the instructions to install it. Trust me I need the instructions!! Anyway, when I tried to boot from the pen drive I got an error and it booted into windows instead. I decided to give up on it and just reformat the pen drive but when I went to reformat it, it said that my drives capacity was 400mb!! Please help me get back the rest of my memory!! Just ask if you need to know anything else!! Thanks!!!

There I'll remove all the partitions from that USB stick, create a new FAT or FAT32 partition and use the quick format option. Bob
