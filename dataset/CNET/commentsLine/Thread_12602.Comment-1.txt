i am posting a new question to the mac hardware forum concerning a new replacement for my original usb1.1 apple card for my mac g4 quicksilver server to a new card for the usb2 standard.
my g4 has a single port for the usb.
is the usb and the firewire port next to it connected to the same card?
opened up to take a look at what is involved to replace the card unit and quickly closed the mac door.
i am not an it person.
way over my head!
what should i do???
also ,what usb2 hub should i purchase?
4-ports are not enough.
i am interested in the belkin 7-port maybe.
your thoughts?
mr. macfixit, do you do house calls?
:) thanks, kevin smith
