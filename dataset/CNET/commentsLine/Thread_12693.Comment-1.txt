i have windows xp with ie6 sp2 installed.
every once in awhile, while trying to access abc.com, while the site page is still loading, for some reason, it completely shuts down my ie page.
after a few attempts, the page will load and i am good to go.
this morning after 10 times of this happening, i thought i would try to get an answer in this forum as to why this is happening.
this is the only site that does this.
i know i know, as the doctor would say, then don't do that anymore lol....i would appreciate any help, thanks, sitnpritee
