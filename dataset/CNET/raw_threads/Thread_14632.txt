I have a PCI-E 16 slot and 650PSU. My pc is a dell xps gen 5 with XP and directx9. My budget is $200. I'm confused as to which nvidia or ATI card I should get and which manufacturer of the cards I should get (EVGA, Sapphire, HIS...etc). The only preference I havens that the card isn't as loud as the last one.
