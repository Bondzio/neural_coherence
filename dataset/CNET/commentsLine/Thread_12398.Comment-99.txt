i am in the process of trying out the phaser 6360 and so far i am not pleased.
it is very large, it is loud, and the paper path is in no way straight through.
it actually goes in an upward direction and does curl the card stock.
the quality of text and graphics is no comparison to the 8560. the 6360 text looks grainy and large areas of solid color have a line pattern through them.
i am torn as i love the 8560's printout, but since it doesn't adhere to the metallic stock very well, i certainly can't use that for final product pieces.
anyways, the 6360 is going back next week.
(good thing because it is pretty expensive...) however note that the 6360 is a great printer for a small to medium size office with a number of employees, it is just not what we all need for an invitation business.
i guess we'll keep looking...
