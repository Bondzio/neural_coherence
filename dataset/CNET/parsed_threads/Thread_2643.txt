<s> Buying a new Mid-range desktop later this week. </s>
<s> Haven't decided on whether to buy one off Gateway's web site, Velocity Micro's site, or just go to Best Buy and make the purchase. </s>
<s> I chose Gateway and Velocity for there customer service and quality of systems. </s>
<s> Most reviews on them seem to be good. </s>
<s> I know you can customize if you buy from thier web sites, but that is the only advantage I see so far. </s>
<s> Gateway, Velocity, or Best Buy store? </s>
<s> Your opinions please. </s>
<s> After many looksee's I wonder if they have nothing but older models or units they bought a boatload of. </s>
<s> If you go that route, get the make/model and go back home to research that model and see if it's been superseded or you can beat it by going direct. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the retail versions of gateways are technically not as good as those offered direct from gateway. </s>
<s> the retail pcs use more low-end components (lower rated power supplies, ddr2-533 vs ddr2-667 ram, i945 instead of i965 chipset, etc.) </s>
<s> but the prices of the retail units are hard-to-beat: $749 for a core2duo, 2gb ram, and 320gb hd. </s>
<s> I ordered one from VM last week after doing much research. </s>
<s> I had originally ordered one to be customized from HP. </s>
<s> I also ordered a monitor from them. </s>
<s> I got the monitor (actually 2), and since both were defective, I cancelled my order after spending about 4 hours on the phone with their &quot;tech support&quot;. </s>
<s> ARRGH! </s>
<s> I think the deciding factor for buying a VM was this article. </s>
<s> I thought it was very helpful: http://consumer.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTIxNSwxLCxoY29uc3VtZXI= Good luck! </s>
