<s> i have a Yamaha CRW3200E CDRW...until about a month ago it worked great. </s>
<s> decided to use it today and nothing..dead. </s>
<s> i have it set as the slave and my dvdrom as the master. </s>
<s> when i open 'my computer' it is detected and i can even click on it and open it when there is a CD in the drive, and it opens to a blank screen. </s>
<s> i can even go as far as ejecting the tray from Nero,the unit is detected in device manager with no conflicts, i updated the firmware of the drive. </s>
<s> i have also uninstalled/reinstalled the drive, used multiple IDE cables, and nothing. </s>
<s> i tried my winxp CD in the drive to see if i could boot from it, and it couldn't, but the drive is detected in the BIOS. </s>
<s> HELP ME PLEASE, my computer is filling up fast... </s>
<s> Try another drive if this drive is more than a year old. </s>
<s> You may save yourself a lot of work. </s>
<s> I've seen people reload the OS, fidget with a dead CDRW drive for months before they give up. </s>
<s> My lesson is to swap early. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i will have to go purchase one, don't really have a spare CDRW kickin around, but whatever...if $35 from futureshop cures it, i'll be thankful </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=BLK-DUW161-BULK-N&cat=DVD this AM is a AOpen Double Layer 16x16x4 DVDRW IDE Drive (Black) for 34.99 bucks. </s>
<s> Why go less than this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i'd be lost without ya....just ordered it, thanks for the info </s>
<s> if anyone has priced dual layer media lately? </s>
<s> I had heart failure when I did. </s>
<s> I can buy another drive for the price of four disks, or a hell'of'a large HD for a few more disks. </s>
<s> Didn't want to get into the middle of this conversation, but DL-DVD disks are just too pricy for me. </s>
<s> Then again you can still use single layer disk in a dual layer drive like I do. </s>
<s> I bought the drive before I priced the disks. </s>
<s> And they are slooooow to burn. </s>
<s> yeah i had a heart attack when i seen the price too, but i will mostly be using it for backing up, and the odd movie/game...but it is nice to have that dual layer option, for those 'larger programs'... </s>
<s> DVD media rolled out at over 10 bucks a pop and stayed there for a few years till just recently. </s>
<s> I reserve dual layer for the few instances its needed. </s>
<s> -&gt; I'm found of a program called Alcohol 120% which can emulate a dual layer dvd media and drive so we can test burn and play a dual layer dvd without actually recording it onto real media. </s>
<s> A real time and money saver. </s>

<s> Before spending money on a new burner, there is one possible solution you should have tried. </s>
<s> Most burners, whether they be CD or DVD or CD/DVD Combos, need to be set as master and any CD-ROM, or in your case, DVD-ROM drives set as slave. </s>
<s> The fact that it worked awhile back means nothing in this case. </s>
<s> When first installed, they can do that but very soon will stop operating properly. </s>
<s> I am willing to bet that if you were to go inside your computer and switch them, both drives would work properly. </s>
<s> When you turn on your computer, it will automatically make the changes in your setup. </s>
<s> If you install your new burner in the same setup you have now, with it as slave, and it doesn't work, try the solution above. </s>
