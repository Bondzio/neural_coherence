Here's the rub, if your PSU failed or is weak and starting to fail, it may take other componets with it.
-OR- in the same vein degrade so much that when the PSU is replaced, its too late, the other componets are weak and probably fall down.
In your case, the unplugging of the AC cord, allows the start ckt.
to de-energize and makes relays truly turn OFF, thus then power is applied and power-ON started it energizes and system starts a boot-up, however, those same relays are weak, and won't work properly when restarted unless repeated attempts or NOT.
The logic ckt.
that applies here has failed.
You replaced the primary fault(PSU) but secondary problems arise and in some may cause the new PSU to fail as well, its a domino effect at times.
