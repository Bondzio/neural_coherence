I just hooked up my Acer Netbook and I'm only going to use this to play and store MP3's.
Is it ok to uninstall the following: 1.
Microsoft Works (that's 567.00MB) 2.
Adobe Reader (that's 204.00MB) 3.
Windows Live Essentials (that's 120.00MB) 4.
How do I disable the warning that comes up when the computer is turned on saying my computer is not protected.
THANKS!!!
!
