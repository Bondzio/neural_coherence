i tried to upgrade my rt314 to the -22 firmware using the ethernet connect per netgear's posted instructions for that upgrade.
it crashed and no longer communicates via ethernet.
netgear's indian tech support said the serial port would still work.
i tried to follow their instructions but do not see the same screens when i use hyperterminal and xmodem protocol.
netgear support (get the women, they speak english better with less sing-song), could not tell me how to configure xmodem.
it has been a long time since i used serial communication.
if you have the time, please post a process for communicating with the rt314.
i am running win2k with all the latest upgrades, amd athelon, lots of memory and a 22&quot; mitsubishi diamond scan monitor at 1600 x 1200. i mention this since i can see several windows open at the same time.
sincerely, david parker ps i agree that d-link does not work well.
