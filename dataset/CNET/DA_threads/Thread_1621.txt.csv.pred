1.1.1	Hello Everyone !	St
1.1.2	First of all , thanks for taking the time to read my question .	Polite
1.1.3	Pretty soon , I 'll be buying a tablet .	St
1.1.4	I know this tablet will be my media/entertainment machine ( ie .	St
1.1.5	Books , movies , TV shows , music to some extent ) .	St
1.1.6	I 'm having trouble picking a tablet , however , I have it narrowed down to two which I 'll get to because I have an even bigger question .	St
1.1.7	That question is about ecosystems .	St
1.1.8	I 've been reading all about the Apple/Amazon/Google/Microsoft ecosystems and how they work and each strength/weakness each have .	St
1.1.9	Before I ask the question , let me give an attempt at a short back story .	St
1.1.10	I was an Apple fan ( and still am in many respects ) for a few years .	St
1.1.11	I owned 3 different iPhones , an iPad and a Macbook Pro , and for the past two years I 've been telling myself & quot ; I 'm ready to start collecting digital media , I want to build a digital music/movie/tvshow/book collection. & quot ; I never really started that collection , which is weird , because Apple offers so much and it was all in one place which is exactly what I prefer , everything in one place .	St
1.1.12	Well , in the last year , I grew out of Apple personally .	St
1.1.13	Nothing against Apple or its fans , its a fantastic platform , but I never really messed with Android , but once I did , I was sold .	St
1.1.14	So I thought , & quot ; with my documents , pictures and all personal files on Google , and my new love of Android , I 'm going to buy into this because I like what I see and like what Google has to offer. & quot ; So now I am a proud owner of a Nexus 4 and a Chromebook .	St
1.1.15	And just recently my son wanted to watch a movie on our Google TV but it was n't on Netflix so I went to purchase it digitally .	St
1.1.16	But then I thought & quot ; from where ?	Ques
1.1.17	Amazon ?	Ques
1.1.18	I have a lot of TV shows there , maybe I should start my collection there. & quot ; And then I thought & quot ; but I have Google products , maybe its best to stick with the Play Store so I have consistent access. & quot ; I know the Google Play store is behind the curve a bit ( but I assume they 'll catch up , right ?	Ques
1.1.19	) , and I know Amazon has a massive selection , but Amazon Instant Video is n't available for the Android phones/tablets , and I do n't know if Amazon is going to limit their apps for the Google devices in the future .	St
1.1.20	So this brings me to my question , I am currently deciding between a Nexus tablet or a Kindle Fire HD solely based on the ecosystem that I buy into in regards to movies , music , TV shows , books etc ...	St
1.1.21	I want to buy into the Google Play store , but should I be worried about its lack of content ?	Ques
1.1.22	Or should I live without the Amazon Instant Video app and the blurry future of Amazon and its compatibility with Google products and buy into Amazon ?	Ques
1.1.23	Is Google Play worth starting my collection in ?	Ques
1.1.24	Thanks for any and all input !	St
1.1.25	- michael	St
1.2.1	I am lucky as the office is porting apps to Android so I have access to the Kindle Fire HD 7 and a Nexus 7 .	St
1.2.2	Both play Amazon Instant Video just fine and I can get apps from both stores in the Nexus .	St
1.2.3	As to the blurry Amazon future the advice to developers is to go all in on the Kindle .	St
1.2.4	I 'm unsure what is bothering you here .	St
1.2.5	We are not talking about deep investments .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	As of today , the kindle fire hd is a better content streamer , the nexus 7 is more open operating system .	St
1.3.2	The kindle fire hd will allow micro hdmi , if that is all in play .	St
1.3.3	However , without all that MUCH trouble , the kindle fire hd CAN access pretty much anything you need , it will take some sideloading to do this , if you do NOT want to deal with this , get the Nexus , the kindle may be superior in terms of sound and screen , but if you personally will find it annoying that you have spend 20 -30 minutes to figure out how to access something outside of the Amazon world , dont bother .	St
1.3.4	Nexus allows you to enter both ecosystems , as does the majority of andriod tabs out there .	St
1.3.5	( BTW , I have the vast majority of items on my kindle that Amazon doesnt want you to play with , so in terms of functionality , you pretty much can do anything on either , it just takes more work to do it on the Kindle ) Right now on my kindle.. Chrome and Dolphin for browsing Flash 11.1 player Wondershare for open access to free hulu service Google Sky You Tube Nook ( for when I only can get the epub version of books ) Or you could probably just stay in Amazon 's world , with thier prime and have enough stuff to keep you entertained , I just dont like paying access for stuff I can get for free otherwise .	St
1.3.6	Wondershare has been a revelation to me as well.. what a wonderful app..	St
