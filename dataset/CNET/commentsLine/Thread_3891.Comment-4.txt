i want to disagree, reason i feel that i have no internet or can't go online with my ps3 is that for some reason, the modem seems to shut down after i reconfigure.
now: cpu---cable (cox) modem---phone----with cable cord going into modem from wall.
after: cpu---router----cable (cox) modem----phone----with cable cord going into modem from wall before, after the reconfigure the link light on modem went out.
so after a week and being frustrated from not being able to play socom for ps3 (online only game wtf) i just added a usb from modem to cpu (so i have two connections to cpu--modem) i will just try usb after work....but the ps3 shows the netgear router at 47% to 55% signal strenghtjust can't get internet light to light up on router....i change ip address from another thread i seen on cnet and still nothing.... you call cox and get &quot;we don't support netgear&quot; and you call netgear and you can here local tv stations saying it's 80 degrees here in mumbai, india today...
