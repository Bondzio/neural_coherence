<s> I have moved into a retirement village - private homes as well as aggregate ones - where there is very little communication amongst residents other than neighbor-to-neighbor and a weekly calendar put out by the central administration. </s>
<s> I'm told that about 50% of the residents have email and some do get a blast from the admin in emergencies, or of course exchange email amongst themselves. </s>
<s> I would like to instigate a move to get people using a localized &quot;bulletin board&quot; - facebook or google plus - and a calendar, probably the google one. </s>
<s> Not everyone can afford an iPad, but I'm sure many have kindles and the like and/or smartphones. </s>
<s> My experience is with iPads/iphone. </s>
<s> How good are the non-iPad tablets at doing internet stuff? </s>
<s> Can you recommend what *I* should recommend to them? </s>
<s> Has anyone had experience implementing this in a community like this? </s>
<s> I'd like advice! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> But wouldn't you test drive those before recommending? </s>
<s> Did you try the new Kindle Fire HD? </s>
<s> It's email is very good. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But I couldn't possibly BUY them all, and I want to know if, say, the cheaper Kindles really work with web apps like Facebook and Google. </s>
<s> You don't upset me in the least. </s>
<s> Maybe in this election season, I'm more leery of advertisements that promise more than they deliver, which is why I want real-life experiences with the different tablets. </s>
<s> The KF HD is what I'd try first. </s>
<s> It's email is surprisingly good. </s>
<s> The other apps are all-in. </s>
<s> I'm only a software developer but if I was asked this question, the KF HD gets first place. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Chrome book Microsoft tablet surface. </s>
<s> Chrome book is very good in internet app, surface is powerful as a laptop. </s>
<s> No Visual Studio so how to match what I do on a laptop today? </s>
<s> I have a Nook Color which is very easy to use and I can surf the web and watch Netflix movies as well as read books. </s>
<s> The new ones have excellent displays and will cost much less than the iPad. </s>
<s> If you want a camera for Skyping, you will need to look elsewhere as Nook has no camera. </s>
<s> since i have an Android phone and tablet. </s>
<s> Basically all Androids will have the same options for email. </s>
<s> One disadvantage of the Kindle is it's a modified version of Android and not all android apps with run on it. </s>
<s> I myself love my Samsung. </s>
<s> I'm a senior, retired, but very atypical, in that I'm a long time computer & smart phone guy. </s>
<s> I also provide IT support for my church and I get this kind of question pretty often. </s>
<s> Like Bob, I have a preference for Windows and Android over Apple. </s>
<s> But if you surveyed the population you're talking about it's probably more iPhones & iPads than anything else. </s>
<s> If that is the case, then I'd say go with Apple and let them help each other. </s>
<s> iPhone, iPad, iPad Mini, iPod touch offer a consistent experience. </s>
<s> Refurbs, iPad Mini, previous generation iPads are all ways to get in at a lower cost. </s>
<s> On the other hand, Kindle and Nook are both good tablets, too. </s>
<s> Both offer a curated App store so there are fewer choices, and that's important for people in a retirement village. </s>
<s> Both do Wifi and email very competently. </s>
<s> I prefer the Nook line (Nook Color, Nook Tablet and the new Nook HD and HD+) because they are more open. </s>
<s> Kindle has a strong preference for the Amazon ecosystem for books, movies and TV. </s>
<s> Nook relies more on commercial apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc. </s>
<s> Significant differences in the latest offerings are: - Kindle has a front facing camera; Nook has no camera - Kindle's low priced tablets are ad supported, Nooks are ad free - Nook tablets have a micro SD card slot for added storage, Kindles don't have a way to add storage - Both Nook and Kindle highlight their email and calendar apps For what it's worth, The Other Bob </s>
<s> You can order it without that as well. </s>
<s> For me it was worth the (current) 15 bucks. </s>
<s> I have the Nook and as the office placed orders for the Kindles we'll have them next week so we can see if we can get our apps on them. </s>
<s> -&gt; Email support looks great on the KF HD so far. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's probabably best not to try to &quot;replace&quot; a laptop with a tablet, just compliment it. </s>
<s> We are porting apps to Android among other things. </s>
<s> But I continue to find people thinking that today's tablets and apps are ready to replace the Apple or Windows laptop. </s>
<s> Not yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Your rationale behind Apple is sound, and I hadn't really thought of it. </s>
<s> I have been investigating, and most people around here who have Kindles read books, period. </s>
<s> I don't think the camera is TOO big a deal but maybe it is. </s>
<s> I did find one woman who uses a Kindle FIre for all sorts of things, which means that if I do a presentation I should invite her to join me. </s>
<s> So thanks, for understanding exactly what I was looking for. </s>
<s> A few years back everyone here was saying everyone (even grandma) should get Linux computers. </s>
<s> I don't hear that often any more. </s>
<s> The ability to understand that what YOU may want or enjoy isn't necessarily what EVERYONE should get perhaps come with maturity and experience. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab2 .. mini tablet .. LOVE IT .. and I'm 71 3/4s! </s>
<s> It is Android OS, can get Kindle app as well as Nook app, many many apps, as well as email, internet, etc .. and it fits easily into a purse/messanger bag-type to carry with you. </s>
<s> Of course the best thing is the cost .. </s>
<s> I had originally purchased the Kindle Fire HD to replace my several years old Kindle keyboard .. then started looking at the difference in price between it ($199) and having a 'real' computer - the Samsung was $249 .. so for $50 more I received MUCH more and I love it! </s>
<s> But I find many people - young and old, who really don't even know what Visual Studio IS, much less want to use it, or many other standard PC apps, on ANYTHING. </s>
<s> They are quite content to do the web, email, simple editing of photos, Skype maybe, watch movies and tv and play a few or many games. </s>
<s> There are reasonably bearable office programs if need be and I've found I can also use Salesforce and Wordpress on my iPad, the main limitation being the keyboard (which I could correct if need be). </s>
<s> However, obviously, there are a great many IT apps that are not and will not be ported to tablets. </s>
<s> I'm retired - no longer interested in the corporate world's needs, and if there is ONE app to make a power-point presentation, that's one app too many! </s>
<s> ! </s>
