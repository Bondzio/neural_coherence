Anyway, I was able to start up in Safe Mode, and I had something like 5.8 GB of space on that computer's hard drive. I decided to re-install. I made a boot disk, and typed FDISK to re-partion my hard drive. I deleted by old partitions, and made a new one. When it asked if I wanted to use the maximum space for my partion, I hit yes. It said 508 MB. I figured something was wrong, so I restarted, and did the process of FDISK over. This time, instead of clicking yes to the maximum, I just set the value of space to be used on the partion I wanted (in percent) to 99%. It came out as like 500 MB. What happened!? It's like my hard drive was randomly reduced to 1/10 the size! Any ideas? My first thought was that the hard drive was shot, but I later proceeded to install Windows 98 on it, so I fail to see how only 90% of it was ruined... Any suggestions as to where to go would be helpful. Thanks, GarciaOwens By the way, I'm 100% sure that my hard drive -was- very near 6 GB, so it's not just be seeing things or something.

Why don't you download a disk utility from your drive's manufacturer and use that instead? They work much better than old FDISK and FORMAT, much quicker and are more updated, give more accurate info.
