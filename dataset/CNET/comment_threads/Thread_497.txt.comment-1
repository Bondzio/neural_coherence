Hey ppl, I need help setting up a network printer between my desktop which is running windows xp and my laptop which is running windows vista.
Do I to download a printer driver on my laptop or is there an easy way in the settings somewhere.
Please ppl, help me out and also the printer I want to put on a network is an older one (so it's not a USB printer, its that older bigger, clunkier kind of ports into the desktop PC).
Please help, ppl.
