I am also building a computer as we speak as well and I was just wondering if you know to the power supply will supply enough power to all your components?
Im building a gaming rig and am going with a 1000watt power supply because it provides the power needed and a good base for upgrading the whole system in the future.
Plus if you put in a power supply and it doesnt provide enough power to your system it will crash, fry and have a possibility of taking down other components in your computer with it.
