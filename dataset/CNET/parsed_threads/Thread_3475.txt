<s> Can I put 667 Mhz memory cards with 533 Mhz or do they all have to have the samebus width? </s>
<s> Memory should all be the same speed and if possible same size, make and model. </s>
<s> Put the fastest you can in. </s>
<s> But 667 may not work correctly or cause errors in a 533 motherboard. </s>
<s> It might &quot;underclock&quot;. </s>
<s> I know memory will lower the clock of the fastest cards to the lowest. </s>
<s> For example, if you put in a 512 of 533 and a 512 of 667, the 667 will clock itself down to 533, making the extra few bucks getting 667 spent gone. </s>
<s> I may be confusing myself, are you talking about Memory and FSB? </s>
<s> Don't think so, but making sure. </s>
