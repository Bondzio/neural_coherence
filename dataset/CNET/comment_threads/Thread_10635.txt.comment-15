standard for DDR2 is PC 5400 which is DDR2 667 (it's seeming to be the PC 3200 of DDR2) 6:5 is a ratio it's the FSB/DRAM ratio the motherboard set a ratio to keep the RAM running at stock speeds and the CPU at stock speeds it shouldn't be doing 1.2GHZ though... 200 for the CPU's clock factor, or bus, or whatever you'd like to call it would in turn result in an 800MHZ FSB (due to the way Pentium 4's are designed) i'm guessing however that it's not running 200/166 but instead 166/133 or 166/100 (PC 2100 - 133MHZ/ 266 DDR) see if you can raise the CPU's FSB/frequency and set that ratio to auto so the ratio that says 6:5 see if you can change that setting to &quot;Auto&quot; and then see if you can change CPU's clock factor (not sure what it's labeling it, but it's the CPU bus speed) to the correct setting (depending on what your chip's correct setting is, if the chip was bought retail boxed it should include documentation to show what is correct)
