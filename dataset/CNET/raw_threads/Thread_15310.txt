P3's can do that, but the BIOS must have been updated. But a BIOS is not a P3. A &quot;P3&quot; is just the CPU of the machine and this CPU is not limited in this respect. There is an end run around a BIOS with a limited support and that is to put the drive in an USB 2.0 enclosure and use a compatible OS. Also, the OS is an issue... Bob
