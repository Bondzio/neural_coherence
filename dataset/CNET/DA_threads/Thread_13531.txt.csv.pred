1.1.1	This discussion is due to a complete lack of understanding exactly how wireless anything works, so please excuse my ignorance.	St
1.1.2	Our office is running XP Pro with DSL to a netgear router then to a 24 port netgear hub, that everything is hardwired to.	St
1.1.3	We have recently undergone a medical software change from a server to a web based program.	St
1.1.4	In order to maximize utilization of our new software, a wireless connection has become necessary.	St
1.1.5	The office is hardwired to all computer stations, but we are trying to implement tablet PC's (Toshiba Tecra with wifi), which will be carried into the patient exam rooms by the physician, where a patient charge slip will be created.	St
1.1.6	I need for the tablet to be able to communicate with the network so that it will not only create the &quot;Super bill&quot; on line, but also communicate with the print router to print out patient receipts.	St
1.1.7	My question is what kind of equipment do I need to achieve this?	St
1.1.8	I want the best, most secure, and fastest system for my money, and really don't know where to start.	St
1.1.9	Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated, as I am trying to save as much money as possible.	St
1.1.10	Dr's don't make what they used to.	St
1.2.1	I won't repeat prior discussions about wifi security where I dismember one protection after another but if you purchase the usual wifi router you see from Linksys, Dlink, Netgear or other then enable WEP, WPA (your choice) as well as enable MAC FILTERING then that's the state of today's best protection.	St
1.2.2	I see no need to describe MAC FILTERING since it will be in the product manual or you can ask any search engine.	St
1.2.3	If you want absolute security then wifi is never an option.	St
1.2.4	Part of this has to do with governmental restrictions on encryption so don't blame the vendors.	St

1.3.1	frist off i would make sure the frist router has BUILT in hardware firewall if not GET one ASAP then i would use one of the ports from the hub to branch off to a computer that was running LINUX software and use router software on that machine then hook the wireless router to the computer and branch that way cause then the hackers have to switch on the fly between the os's and this is not a feat that most noobs hackers know how to do and you can also install a linux firewall on that pc as well i use 2 software firewalls behind a linksys befsx41 hardware firewall but if you can afford it there are way higher priced routers that do a way better job of protecting the network if all that seems over your head i can help you with the installation as you have to know how to route everything so that it works if you have jsut a standard router that has no hardware firewall this is no protection and i could break into your network in under 10 seconds steal all your files in under 20 seconds and leave 1000 backdoors in under 30 seconds running one program using only one command where as you use a linux box as a router i would have to frist break into your router then into the OS then thru the linux box then thru the wireless router and to a hacker that is way to much time to be messing with you see to be a good hacker you need to get in and get out in as less time as possiable so you arent detected and i could go on for days and days at how i could hide my main pc thru a series of other stolen PC's were the it would spend all day chasing his tail between his legs coming up with dead ends at every ping you can ask any good IT and they will tell you that when a hacker has to switch OSes to to hack some one most hackers will run like you have the plague but if all this seems over your head then at least make sure you have hardware firewall on frist router to the dsl and then run wireless off the hub but with DSL you are kinda safer then say using cable modem because everytime you use the network to access the internet the dsl router has to dail into dsl network that is when you are most unsecure is when the actual connection is made and the very frist thing i would find out is what topology your network is (star, etc) but from what you describe it sounds to be a STAR topology which is the best one for networking i think and i would use at least a 15 letter symbol signs uppercase lowercase password as a minimum (i my self set the password on my router with special characters from the character map tool (what this will do is lock everyone including your self out of the router as most routers will except the password but you wont be able to type it which means that after u set the router password and settings you LOCK it up like fort KNOX the bad side to this is if you need to get back into the router (which you really shouldnt have to)you will have to use the rest button to reset the defualt password back up the upside is if you use the right characters if some one was using a password cracker on the router you can make it so when they discover the password you can cause some of the letters to show up as a block instead of showing the actual letter and they will scratch there heads for years trying to figure out what is behind the block here is a example &#292;&#265;&#311;&#279;&#343;&#351;&#2652;&#266;&#261;&#315;&#315;M33&#2614;&#2587; now as you can see in this form all the symbols and stuff show up cause the way the form works but what you see is not so because some of thses are being shown as something else when they are infact different symbols hiding behind the x's and the u's are differnet if you were to veiw this from any windows OS or any other os you would see square boxes where the x's and u's are and the ravai(characters &#2652;&#2614;&#2587;) would also show up as square boxes you can experment on the os your self to see what i have showed you and i dont recommend you use this tech for any os passwords as it will cause problems that can only be fixed with a reinstall of the OS but on routers and such this works great only do this after you have set the router up and a password of this kind will deter the UBEREST hackers there are and they will scratch there heads for years trying to figure out what is behind the square boxes that there password cracker shows up the reason they show as square boxes is because OS are not allowed to show special characters that the os uses for code this is an old school ACSii trick	St
1.4.1	after i sent it to the server so you can not see what the password is supposed to look like but you can play with this on the os to see what i am trying to explain	St
1.5.1	It might be best if I hire someone to come out and do all this.	St
1.5.2	The last thing I need to do is spend an enourmous amount of time trying to learn all this.	St
1.5.3	I hate to hire anyone to do anything around here, because it's not a matter of &quot;if you will get screwed&quot; just to what degree.	St
1.5.4	I did buy a new router today though, a Cisco 1721.	St
1.5.5	A couple of questions.	St
1.5.6	Since our program is web based does it increase or decrease security risks like the ones you mentioned in the discussion?	St
1.5.7	How secure does a pediatric clinic really need to be anyway?	St
1.5.8	Who would want to hack into that?	St
1.5.9	Or am I way to careless with regards to security?	St
1.5.10	Thanks for taking time explaining everything, I really appreciate it.	St
1.5.11	Jim	St
1.6.1	If you live close enough to Dallas TX, I'll hire you to do the install.	St
1.7.1	Jim, First let me agree with Bob, there is no such thing as secure Wireless Access.	St
1.7.2	Second, it also isn't near as difficult as the previous poster makes it.	St
1.7.3	Here in the Atlanta area, almost every doctor I or my family have had to visit in the last year or so have WiFi and are using it successfully.	St
1.7.4	Let me make this suggestion, contact some other doctor's offices in your area and ask their office manager if they use WiFi and who they recommend.	Sug
1.7.5	I think you will be pleasantly surprised by their responses and help.	St
1.7.6	As to the &quot;getting ripped off&quot; problem, while that may be a legitimate issue, the Dallas area has a great PC Users Group.	St
1.7.7	You might want to also contact them and see what type of expertise they have and can recommend.	Sug
1.7.8	The biggest issue is don't get frustrated or overwhelmed by the problem.	St
1.7.9	It has been solved and does work, so you just need to concentrate on making the right choices for your business.	St
1.7.10	And also, thanks for taking care of the kids out in the Dallas area.	Polite
1.7.11	These days, being a doctor, means a lot more than people give credit for.	St
1.7.12	Good Luck and please let us know how you make out or if you have any other questions.	Sug
