That card plugs into a normal PCI Express slot on the motherboard.
I don't think the power supply has anything to do with it.
Forget about what it &quot;calls for.&quot; Computers don't use nearly as much power as they claim.
a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system.
Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent...
