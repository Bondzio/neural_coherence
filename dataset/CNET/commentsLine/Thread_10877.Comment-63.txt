ajtrek - thanks for your many thoughtful contributions to this conversation.
i appreciate the time you give to us.
a lot of discussion in this thread has to do with heavy writing to ssds hastening the arrival of their inevitable end of life.
wouldn't using ssds as cache do just that and thus cause an otherwise still functional conventional hd to cease to function?
