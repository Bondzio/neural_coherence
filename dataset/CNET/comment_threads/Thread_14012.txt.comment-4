The author indicates &quot;below-average performance&quot; of the T6212.
It indicates to me that the ATI Radeon XPress 200 INTEGRATED graphics on the T6212 performs less than the Intel INTEGRATED graphics on the T5026, Dell 4700C and Dell 3000.
The author did state: &quot;Add a graphics card to the T6212--even a cheap budget card--and you can expect the T6212's application performance to climb to at least the Gamer Ultra's level, if not a bit higher.&quot; IMO add a GeForce 6600GT PCI-Express X16 video card and it will fly past all these tested by a huge margin.
The T5026 cannot be upgraded to an AGP or PCI-Express x16 video card.
