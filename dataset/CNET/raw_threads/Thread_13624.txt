So I have to buy a new laptop.Unfortunately a disk was left inside and I don't know how to take it out when the laptop is not switched on.Please give me an advise how to do this.Thank you in advance.

Now you have the removal instructions and we find out it's an bog standard IDE 2.5 inch drive. Look at newegg.com, geeks.com, amazon.com and you'll find some 20 buck case with power supply to convert it into an external drive. Parting tip. Type XP TAKE OWNERSHIP into google.com and keep that handy too. Bob

That releases the lock and you can pull it open and retrieve the disk. If however you mean the hard drive disk, then the previous instructions are dead on.
