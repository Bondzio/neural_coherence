<s> MY computer just have a USB port, but I'm intested to buy a DVD-R USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Can I use a DVD-R USB 2.0 in a USB port? </s>
<s> Tanks </s>
<s> It more than likely is backward compatable, but will only work at USB 1.1 speed, which is very slow. </s>
<s> You can buy an USB 2.0 add-in card for less than $20 that should solve the speed problem. </s>
<s> The DVD playback will never happen. </s>
<s> You need to move some 4.7GB in 60 Minutes. </s>
<s> USB 1.1 is lucky to hit 11Megabits per second or about 1 megabyte per second so it's too slow 60 MB per minute or 3,600 MB per hour. </s>
<s> You can't hit the 1X speed of DVD so playback and recording will not function. </s>

<s> How will a usb 2.o hard drive work with usb 1.1 connection? </s>
<s> How much will hard drive speed matter? </s>
<s> The drive makers rarely tell you if it will work. </s>
<s> But the same time issue kicks in. </s>
<s> Since, at best you can transfer 3 odd GB in an hour that 700MB of MP3 will take about 15 to 20 minutes. </s>
<s> It's really useful, but slow. </s>
<s> Answer? </s>
<s> Only if its supported. </s>
