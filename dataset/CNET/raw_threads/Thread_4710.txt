After I reinstalled the OS, I realized that I could no longer record system audio with any program like I could originally. I guarantee this computer must have an audio card, other-wise how'd I record the audio before? So, can anyone help me with this issue?

But head to dell.com and &quot;Use your service tag for all the drivers and apps for your machine. No need for anyone here to list those drivers since dell gets them for you with your service tag.
