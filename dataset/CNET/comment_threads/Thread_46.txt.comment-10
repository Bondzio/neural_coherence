especially Norton (Symantec).
Of course you've made certain that the workgroup name is the same and that each PC has a unique name.
You will need to set up a &quot;share&quot; in each machine and allow file sharing.
You can try to take down any firewalls just as a test and see if that works.
If so, you can re-enable the firewall but make the local network an exception.
Good luck.
