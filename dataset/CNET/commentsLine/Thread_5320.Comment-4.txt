hi all jim here.
just spent a month trying to resolve problems with my netgear router (624 model).
this is the second netgear router gone bad in less than a year.
i have spent about $75.00 in service calls (1 for each router) and a month of emailing to have netgear tell me the router is bad.
their warranty replacement solution is to mail back the defective router and then they will send a replacement...a 2 week time frame and i have to pay shipping; or i can pay about $20.00 to have them ship a new router before shipping mine...or pay above that to have next day shipping.
i told them this was unacceptable...needless to say i will be going out this week and purchasing a link sys router.
