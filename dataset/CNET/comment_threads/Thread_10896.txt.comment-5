I'd just get a decent socket 939...preferably one that gives you the option for the Athlon 4800 X2 or Opteron 175.
That will make this change low cost AND give you at a CPU upgrade option later that should be a nice boost over the current processor without tossing any of the existing equipment.
By then ...it'll all be cheaper.
