Congratulations on diving into your first build!
Gaming computers need good airflow to dissipate heat, so the really small cases aren't recommended.
You could get away with a standard ATX mini-tower, but you probably will be happiest with the room provided by a standard ATX mid-tower case.
Look at the system requirements for the particular make and model of video card that you intend to install in the computer.
The general idea is to surpass the minimum PSU requirements listed for that video card.
The manual for the motherboard states that it takes a standard ATX12V PSU.
Get a 20+4pin PSU from a good manufacturer with a maximum Wattage rating that surpasses the video card's requirements.
Also pay attention to what Amp rating the video card requires on the PSU's +12V rail.
A high-end video card can require over 30A.
