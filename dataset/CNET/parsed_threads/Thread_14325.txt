<s> as I ponder buying a printer (for printing sheet msuic and pdf's thereof), i am wondering if I am going to see any real benefit from a 1200 as opposed to a 600 dpi printer. </s>
<s> any insights folks? </s>
<s> -- fj </s>
<s> I'll say &quot;yes.&quot; It was readily apparent as we moved from 300 DPI lasers to 600 and finally to 1200 DPI laser printers. </s>
<s> In that case we could put the mug shots on the warrants and the clarity was needed. </s>
<s> In &quot;color&quot; work, you don't need as much dots, but more colors. </s>
<s> But for B/W such as music sheets, DOTS RULE. </s>
<s> And what really can make/break all those dots is the PAPER. </s>
<s> I can make 1200 DPI output look bad and 300 DPI look great by selecting which paper goes to which machine. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> 600dpi fill about any need you should get into. </s>
<s> Of course if your picky or get into specific needs like CAD or such, then 1200 is better, but some printers use a &quot;rastering&quot; to smooth the jaggies into better output. </s>
<s> The scheme like from HP is firmware driven, maybe s/w too, but Canon better models offer the same to get 1200dpi effects as well as others, so *read* the specs to find out how they arrive at dpi rating, but most modern printers are 600dpi capable at least. </s>
<s> Your old HPIII was default at 300dpi. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> hey robert- interesting. </s>
<s> I got an HP 1012. has 600 dpi with some sort of simulated 1200 which i do not understand. </s>
<s> anyway, can you give some guidance about what paper to buy for printing sheet music that will look better than this not-so-hot copy paper i got at staples? </s>
<s> hopefully not photo paper? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>

<s> There are papers specifically optimized for laser printing and some for ink jet. </s>
<s> Others are just generic copy machine paper. </s>
<s> If you are interested in producing a quality product yourself, you will need to use quality materials. </s>
<s> Both HP an HammerMill make papers which specify their intent to be used on laser printers. </s>
<s> I prefer 24lb as a minimum. </s>
<s> If you examine the surface of laser papers versus others, you can see something about the sheen and lack of visible texture in them. </s>
<s> This must enhance their apparent sharpness compared to inkjets which rely somewhat on absorbsion characteristics. </s>
<s> Laser toners are fused with heat on top of the paper rather than be absorbed into the paper fibers as are inks. </s>
<s> It makes sense when you think about it. </s>
<s> Watch for the sale prices and promos and stock up when you can. </s>
