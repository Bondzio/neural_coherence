<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> thanks for taking the trouble to read this. </s>
<s> I have a dell desktop and my secondary hard disk is failing. </s>
<s> i have partitioned the hard disk into two but i already have a primary disk. </s>
<s> the primary disk seems to work fine. </s>
<s> but the secondary disk asks me to format it anytime i try to access any of the two partitions. </s>
<s> i cant afford to format it because i have a lot of important data on it. </s>
<s> I run chkdsk, it only recovered one partition. </s>
<s> but the other where the most important stuffs are, it says it couldn't read some of the sectors. </s>
<s> Someone asked me to downloaded Aacronis Disk Director. </s>
<s> I installed acronis disk director and it saw the disk, the capacity, the free space as well as the used space. </s>
<s> But it couldn't access the content of the disk. </s>
<s> windows sees it alright but when i try to access the files, it says the drive is not formatted so i should format it. </s>
<s> I tried scandisk a lot of times, in dos. </s>
<s> it saw a lot of bad sectors it couldnt read, about 15 of them. </s>
<s> is it that seriouse? </s>
<s> i know that once there are bad sectors i may not be able to access some files but what about the places without the bad sectors. </s>
<s> cant i access the files on the sectors that are not bad. </s>
<s> a friend says i should put it in a freezer overnight but he didnt tell me how to do it. </s>
<s> is it ok to try that? </s>
<s> I need some help here. </s>
<s> I gotta get these pictures from the hard drive. </s>
<s> they are very important to me. </s>
<s> or can anyone give me any software that i can use to retrieve ma files back? </s>
<s> I need your help urgently. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> thank you. </s>
<s> please help. </s>
<s> You might be at a point where you need to consider professional data recovery services if the data is that important. </s>
<s> It will cost you plenty but you don't have all the time in the world to make your decision. </s>
