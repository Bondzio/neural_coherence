My old laptop caught on fire and I purchased a HD enclosure to move the documents/files from the old HD to my new computer.
When I click on the files it says I don't have permission to access them.
I've tried to understand how to change permissions over to the new computer, but it's not working.
I'm using Windows 7 on the new computer and Windows XP on the old one.
Can someone guide me through the process??
