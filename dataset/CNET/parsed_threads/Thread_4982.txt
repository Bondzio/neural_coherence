<s> Ok I whent out and got a 512MB chip for my computer (Compaq 4410us SDRAM 168 pin), First I thought the chip was bad because after instaling it, the computer only read 64mb and was slow as all hell. </s>
<s> Turns out each of the two slots in my computer can only support up to 256mb... </s>
<s> So I still only got 265mb in there and a 512MB chip I can use or return. </s>
<s> My question is could placing this 512 chip in my computer have damaged it? </s>
<s> if so where could I get it tested? </s>
<s> I ment 512mb chip that I can't use... </s>
<s> The chances it was damaged are probably very small. </s>
<s> I don't know if there is any place that would test it for you. </s>
<s> If you know someone with a PC that can use the memory willing to let you borrow the PC for a few hours to test the RAM, you could do it that way. </s>
<s> To test RAM, get a program called memtest86. </s>
<s> Available at www.memtest86.org I believe. </s>
<s> It is free, and you put it on a CD or floppy and the system boots directly into it and begins testing your RAM. </s>
<s> Leave it running for at least a couple passes, and a full pass might take awhile depending on the speed of the PC. </s>
<s> If there are errors, memtest86 will find them. </s>
<s> You less than likely damaged your 512mb stick. </s>
<s> Usually with HP and Compaq products their motherboards are made for a certain load of RAM, the older the computer, the less upgradeable it is. </s>
<s> In your case, HP could have the motherboard in such a way that it can only use a maximum of say 512mb = 2x256mb instead of 512mb+256mb, therefore with a lot of the machines if you add RAM above what the motherboard can handle, only so much more will be taken advantage of. </s>
<s> Consequently, it becomes a disfactor as it will slow down the machine. </s>
<s> If you have 2 memory slots you could try 2x256mb and see how that works. </s>
<s> If that doesnt work either, you could always return the extra stick too. </s>
<s> Another thing you could do is call HP (if you still have coverage) and tell them you want to upgrade your RAM. </s>
<s> They will ask for your model # etc and will tell you what the maximum RAM is. </s>
<s> Cool, I'm going to end up selling it and buying a 256 chip. </s>
<s> Thats why I ask </s>
<s> Ya, my little rig is maxed at 512 (2x256) but bc I got it from ubid.com and it was my fault for getting the wrong one Ill just keep it for now and sell it on ebay after I do what that one guy said, test it in a friends computer. </s>
<s> I was just a little freaked out bc with just the 512 chip in, it ran show and only at 64mb </s>
<s> In my computer that is a 7 yr old Gateway, MAX SDRAM is 768 MB DIMM. </s>
<s> I checked it with this: http://www.crucial.com/promo/index.asp?prog=uslp_clickscansnap It shows I have 3 slots and Non-parity SDRAM, PC133, in each one 256MB, 128MB & 128MB. </s>
<s> That means I can replace the 2 (128) with 2 (256MB). </s>
<s> the math checks for 256 times 3= 768MB. </s>
<s> It will tell you how much RAM your computer supports & what you have in there now. </s>
<s> It also can be PC100 but they are outdated. </s>
