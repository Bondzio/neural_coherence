1.1.1	So the Acer Aspire AO751h can be had for as little as $ 280 these days .	St
1.1.2	This is with Win XP and the 3-cell battery .	St
1.1.3	The version with the six-cell battery runs for $ 300 .	St
1.1.4	I 'm seriously tempted ...	St
1.1.5	I actually played around with the Acer Aspire 751 at Office Max , although they had the version with Vista on it .	St
1.1.6	I also looked at the Gateway LT31 series at Best Buy , which is quite similar in form factor , although the internals are different .	St
1.1.7	In any case , I 'm a fan of the 11.6 & quot ; screen and full-size keyboard .	St
1.1.8	But that Atom Z-series processor is holding me back ... even if I uninstall all the bloatware , add another gig of RAM , how well would this thing perform ?	Ques
1.1.9	I would n't use it to watch full-screen video , although regular YouTube or Hulu viewing would be nice ... although even that is not essential to me .	St
1.1.10	Browsing and office apps , perhaps with playing MP3s simultaneously , is as demanding as it would get .	St
1.1.11	I know that the Acer Aspire 1410 can be had for $ 450 , but that 's still significantly more expensive than $ 280-300 .	St
1.1.12	I would n't use it all that often anyway .	St
1.1.13	So , do any of you have the AO751h with XP ?	Ques
1.1.14	Would you recommend it ?	Ques
1.1.15	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	What bloatware ?	Ques
1.2.2	I own the Aspire One atom powered unit and did n't find such .	St
1.2.3	What did you consider bloatware ?	Ques
1.2.4	And I see no reason to bump the RAM .	St
1.2.5	I only use it for running out of the office for demos , patching up our applications so my view is that it is no laptop replacement .	St
1.2.6	It 's a fine get out there for cheap spare laptop ( but it 's no laptop ! )	St
1.2.7	bob	St
1.3.1	You posted you bought the Dell unit so by now you know more than you let on in this post .	St
1.4.1	I 've read several user reviews stating that the Aspire 751 comes installed with a fair amount of bloatware .	St
1.4.2	Some have said that uninstalling these free and trial apps helped speed up the computer somewhat .	St
1.4.3	I do n't have time to find the URLs to these reviews ( go to CNet , Amazon , etc . )	St
1.4.4	but they 're not difficult to find .	St
1.5.1	I 'm not sure what you are insinuating here , I certainly do not & quot ; know more than ( I ) let on in this post. & quot ; I did buy the Dell Mini 10v a couple of months ago , but I returned it a week later .	St
1.5.2	I did n't care for its keyboard .	St
1.5.3	The Mini 10v had the Atom N270 CPU with the 1024x576 screen .	St
1.5.4	The Aspire 751 has a slower Atom Z520 CPU that must drive a higher resolution 1366x768 display , which has nearly 50 % more pixels .	St
1.5.5	I think it 's perfectly fair for me to ask whether there 's a significant performance hit between these two machines .	St
1.6.1	Ok , I have the Acer Aspire One here and no sign of such .	St
1.6.2	Can you give me one example ?	Ques
1.6.3	Many you are talking about the eStuff ?	Ques
1.6.4	But that 's not bloat .	St
1.6.5	That 's the software to create restore media and more .	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	Now tell why you are considering Atom netbooks since you can find dual core machines with all the trimmings for nearly the same price .	St
1.7.2	Tell all .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	I was considering a netbook primarily because of the size and weight advantages .	St
1.8.2	My desktop is my primary machine , so I do n't necessarily need a laptop to replace or substitute it with .	St
1.8.3	As they say , the netbook would complement my desktop .	St
1.8.4	I 'd rather not lug around a six-pound laptop with a 15.6 & quot ; screen .	St
1.8.5	You 'd also have to carry around the power supply with one of those as well , whereas you would n't necessarily have to do that with a netbook that has a six-cell battery , making it an even more lightweight and compact solution .	St
1.9.1	It 's quite the little performer as I demo our company applications .	St
1.9.2	It 's running Office 2003 , Visual Studio , our apps and so much more .	St
1.9.3	I can say I wo n't be upgrading its RAM or anything else .	St
1.9.4	Our application is Bluetooth centric so I did add the small Bluetooth adapter .	St
1.9.5	It 's the same size as the Logitech v450 Nano Mouse 's adapter .	St
1.9.6	There are zero performance issues to date .	St
1.9.7	And the 6 cell version is hovering at 300 bucks so not a budget buster .	St
1.9.8	Bob	St
1.10.1	Out of curiosity , what anti-virus or security app do you run on it ?	Ques
1.10.2	If you run one at all , that is .	St
1.10.3	Understandably , it would make sense to install one which has a small footprint per se .	St
1.11.1	I installed the same thing I use on my other machine .	St
