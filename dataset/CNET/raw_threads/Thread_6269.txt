I have 2 computers set up on a Linksys wireless router(befw11s4) with DSL. The second computer is continually losing DSL. My question is this: can we keep the main computer on the router as it is now and then run a cable from the router to the second computer, instead of using the wireless or do I need to buy a wired router to do this?? I see the router has a few plug in's, so I'm thinking this can be done?? But I want to make sure. Thanks!
