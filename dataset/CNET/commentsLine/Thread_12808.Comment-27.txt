i have had had packard bell, a clone and a gateway prior to my hp.
the hp is lightyears better.
knock on wood!
i have had little to no &quot;issues&quot; since getting it about a year ago.
i got it from a third party vendor [make it work], that was my only giant mistake!
i got screwed bad!
and did not get kissed!
i am not computer literate so i hire people to do things to and for my computer.
miw was and has been a nightmare!
avoid them like the plague!
major overpriced and real morons as techies!
i have managed to get the hp almost the way i want it, except my email configuration is not what i would like it to be, but will get it the way i want it soon.
all of my email accounts, sans one, is working the the way i want it to work.
now i am shopping for a laptop, and will go with hp, dell or acer i guess.
any great advice would be appreciated.
