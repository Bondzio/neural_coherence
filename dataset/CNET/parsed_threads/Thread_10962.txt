<s> Hi all, My boys are interested in getting XBox live (Internet gaming like Halo) access. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience with Netgear's WGE111 gaming adapter? </s>
<s> Its configured for 802.11g at up to 54 Mps. </s>
<s> I am looking at this one because of our current network setup. </s>
<s> Dell computers (one withXP Home and the other with XP Media for OS) Comcast broadband Netgear wireless router, WPN 824 (802.11g/MIMO). </s>
<s> Main computer is hardwired to the network while the other has WPN111 USB wireless compatible to WPN824. </s>
<s> Currently network is configured with WPA encryption. </s>
<s> The wireless computer is often used to play WOW and will compete with other computer and XBox for bandwidth. </s>
<s> My concerns are: Compatability of gaming adapter. </s>
<s> (I expect staying with Netgear should cover that even though the adapter is strictly 802.11g - Yes?) </s>
<s> Bandwidth sufficiency. </s>
<s> Netgear works well with XBox? </s>
<s> Any comments would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Jim </s>
<s> I assume this is first generation xbox you're talking about. </s>
<s> That particular adapter is not listed as compatible with the xbox, however, any ethernet bridge will &quot;work&quot;. </s>
<s> By work I mean it will connect you to the live service. </s>
<s> However, depending on range and environmental factors, you may notice some lag. </s>
<s> There are adapters that are specifically adjusted to reduce lag time on the service. </s>
<s> I can tell you from experience that people who lag on Live are picked off and hated for &quot;teleporting&quot;. </s>
<s> The best solution is, of course to run the system wired, but if that is not possible make sure you get an adapter that is Live compatible. </s>
<s> With an MIMO router, bandwidth and sharing with the other wireless computer shouldn't be an issue. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> I hate the thought of wired (another network outlet to put in and wire) although it does have the advantage of avoiding interference. </s>
<s> Boys do get lag playing WOW now but that may because they have too many programs running simultaneously on their PC. </s>
<s> Today I get to clean their startup menu to see if that helps. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> It sounds like you have a relatively nice setup already, but as far as routers go, there are routers that are designed for gaming as well, d-link makes one of them and linksys another, and they are supposed to improve online gameplay by reducing lag time. </s>
<s> Most computers should be able to handle WOW without too much trouble with anotehr program running in the background as long as you have good quality memory and a good quality graphics/sound card. </s>
<s> The bottleneck may either be your service (Cable slows down with increased traffic in the area) or your router. </s>
<s> going on with my sons' computer that may cause some lag. </s>
<s> Today I cut down on the startup programs through msconfig. </s>
<s> I'll see how that works and cut more if it helps. </s>
<s> They won't like it but the parental controls (MacAfee) stays on. </s>
<s> I don't think the lag should be the router/wireless USB as they are capable of 108 Mbps which is almost twenty times the broadband connection rate (6 Mbps) which should cover the bandwidth consumption between multiple computers in-house, encryption, etc. </s>
<s> Computer memory may make some difference as their computer has 784 MB of RAM along with a GeForce 5500 with 256 MB onboard. </s>
<s> CPU is 1.4 GHz which should be fine for WOW. </s>
<s> I'll see how the startup config works before looking at more memory. </s>
<s> By the way, I decided to go hardwire on the XBox setup. </s>
<s> For about $10 bucks I picked up two Cat5e female connectors, cable, wall outlet boxes and faceplates. </s>
<s> I am simply going to wire from the office through the wall to the game room and connect via cable. </s>
<s> Already have the junction cable put together and tested. </s>
<s> Tomorrow I'll install the outlets in the wall for the cable hookup. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
