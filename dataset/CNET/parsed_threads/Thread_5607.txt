<s> My HP hard drive just went splat (i'm at the library now). </s>
<s> The hard drive I have is an IDE drive, but the PC I am about to buy has an SATA drive. </s>
<s> I'm told I can not put the IDE drive in the new PC with the SATA drive, as my current PC wont even boot up how can I get the info on the IDE hard drive off & somehow on to the new PC with SATA drive? </s>
<s> PLEASE PLEASE HELP Thanks </s>
<s> This can be done as the MB will have 2 IDE channels. </s>
<s> Depending on how the new system is configured you should have one IDE port open. </s>
<s> Attach the IDE drive to the open IDE port, on boot access the BIOS primary boot device setting. </s>
<s> Make sure that the SATA HDD is the primary boot drive. </s>
<s> The issue may be XP not recognizing the drive and its data properly. </s>
<s> You say the drive went splat .... meaning? </s>

<s> The PC shut down & tried to reboot but seems to be stuck in a re-boot loop. </s>
<s> I was told by a computer savvy friend that the HD has sort of crashed or the operating system part of it anyway. </s>
<s> So now it wont load up anything. </s>
<s> It gets to the windows loading screen, flicks then reboots again but very very slowly the does that same thing. </s>
<s> It is a 4 year old HP which up until now no similar problems. </s>
<s> If it'll boot in SM, the problem is probably fixable. </s>
<s> Boot with a bootable floppy or cd and try using windows to access the drive. </s>
<s> There may be a way to put the IDE drive into your new computer with a connector card. </s>
<s> Take a look at CompUSA or Best Buy stores in your area for such devices. </s>
<s> I have tried in safe mode but still does the same thing </s>
<s> I dont have a bootable disk, is there a website or link where I can get it from on another computer then put this disk in mine & try that. </s>
<s> I tried asking at the store and they looked at me kind of funny & said I could not put the IDE drive in the PC with the SATA drive then tried to see me a new SATA drive. </s>
<s> Hp's have a recovery partition that gives you the option to re-pair or re-install Windows. </s>
<s> Generally using the F10 or 12 key allows access. </s>
<s> Also some Hp's have the Recovery Consul installed. </s>
<s> On boot watch for boot optioin menu. </s>
<s> If it is their select Recovery Consul via arrow keys and press enter. </s>
<s> At prompt to select OS #1 (not the correct wording, but you will understand when you see the prompt), press enter. </s>
<s> At the next prompt for admin password press enter. </s>
<s> At the prompt type chkdsk /p /r . </s>
<s> Generally this fixes Windows kernal files allowing system to boot to Windows. </s>
<s> And last, using the F8 key to access the boot option menu, select turn off auto re-start, press entry. </s>
<s> This will stop the loop giving the BSOD error message. </s>
<s> Luck Bill Last thoughts never end ..... </s>
<s> If you have a dial-up account remove modem. </s>
<s> I've seen damaged modems create some wierd issues .... </s>
<s> I would like to know what Windows Operating System you are using. </s>
<s> If it is windows XP then you can use your XP CD to boot up with. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> When I boot up I see the blue screen with the F1 & F10 options but when I hit F10 it does nothing at all. </s>
<s> I am using XP but it came pre-insatalled & I have no disk </s>
<s> HP and others will ship you CDs for some small fee. </s>
<s> Much cheaper than buying another copy of XP. </s>
<s> Typical is 35 buck (or less) which beats the 199 buck retail price of XP. </s>
