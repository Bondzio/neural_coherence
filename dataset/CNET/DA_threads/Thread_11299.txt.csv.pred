1.1.1	Hello people of CNET , This is my first post , so I do n't know if it 's placed in the correct forum , but here goes I 'm currently assigned the task of purchasing new wireless access points , for our offices , at my workplace .	St
1.1.2	We 've previously been using & quot ; HP V-M200 & quot ; access points , but we encoutered heavy throughput problems with these .	St
1.1.3	During my tests of the network , I 've seen these APs decrease their tranfer-rate to 30Mb , during file-transfer and ping-test .	St
1.1.4	The issue here is concerning the transfer-rate from the Network Interface Card of my laptop to the wireless AP ( did an iptraf while testing , and then noticed the 30Mb ) .	St
1.1.5	Suffice to say , we 're after the best of the best in wireless technology , but our realistic demands are as follows : - Supports 802.11n , a-b and g. - Supports up to 2 ESSIDS .	St
1.1.6	- Supports VLAN .	St
1.1.7	- Supports WPA2 and RADIUS .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.9	Or is there somebody with some good experience , with certain APs that fulfills these criteria ?	Ques
1.2.1	For example your new IT person might use Windows Explorer for that .	St
1.2.2	Your seasoned IT person uses FTP or a test tool .	St
1.2.3	Since WiFi is a shared access system , it 's proper for the speed to drop off so that others can get access .	St
1.2.4	I wonder if folk in this industry talk to buyers about all this .	St
1.2.5	It 's been a few years but the last we used Cisco .	St
1.2.6	The models have changed so I wo n't tell what we used back then .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
