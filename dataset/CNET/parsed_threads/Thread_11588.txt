<s> I am thinking about buying a Pentium 4 3.0 800mhz and a AIW radeon 9800,for my shuttle sb65g2, but i am unsure if it will handle the heat output. </s>
<s> Could anyone please tell me if the SB65G2 will handle the heat or will it overheat? </s>
<s> Thanks Chris </s>
<s> When installing a hi-end video card which will generate heat plus any from system itself will tend to stress the innards. </s>
<s> You need to be sure you can exhaust any heat build-up. </s>
<s> Plus, depending on case size added attention for exhaust is a must and/or air circulation of intake to outtake. </s>
<s> If possible install more vents or forced air exhaust(s). </s>
<s> hope this helps... good luck -----Willy </s>
