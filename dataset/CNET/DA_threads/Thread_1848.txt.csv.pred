1.1.1	Hello, I have my home PC using Windows ME, and my works laptop using Windows 2000 on my wireless network at home (linksys).	St
1.1.2	I'm trying to get these systems to file share between them.	St
1.1.3	Problem is I need to keep my laptop on my works domain; I can't swtich my network ID to &quot;workgroup.&quot; I tried searching at linksys, but no luck.	St
1.1.4	Is there any other way to get this to work?	Ques
1.1.5	Any help is appreciated.	St
1.1.6	-Thnx	St
1.2.1	Make sure you ME machine uses the same network client.	St
1.2.2	Set up the shares/permissions normally.	St
1.2.3	You should also require a username/password for your ME machine.	St
1.2.4	The workgroup name should not matter.	St
1.2.5	When you attempt to access the laptop, you should be presented with an interactive login box.	St
1.2.6	You will need to enter a valid user and password.	St
1.2.7	To see how you are logged on, press CTRL-Alt-Del and the box will say how you are logged on.	St
1.2.8	Use that full login name as the user and the password will be the one you log on to the laptop with.	St
1.2.9	You are logging onto the laptop and not your work domain.	St
1.2.10	I have a similar situation and my work laptop is part of a domain as well.	St
1.2.11	I need to be able to transfer and share data from my home PC and this is how I set mine up.	St
1.2.12	I was able to do this with Win98 but now have XP-Pro.	St
1.2.13	It should work with ME.	St
1.2.14	Good luck.	St
1.3.1	Both are setup on Client for microsoft networks.	St
1.3.2	Share/permissions are setup, and I have a username/password setup for my ME machine.	St
1.3.3	However, I can't access the laptop.	St
1.3.4	I've tried going to start &gt; run and using every combination of user name, password, machine name I could think of, but no go.	St
1.3.5	Am I trying to access the laptop incorrectly?	St
1.3.6	I can't see it on my network at all.	St
1.3.7	Maybe it's a ME thing, which wouldn't surprize me.	St
1.3.8	Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it.	Polite
