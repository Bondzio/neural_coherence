define quirky.
although not a great ms fan, i have to say that the office for mac has always been better than office for windows.
the mbu have touted that for a number of years.
personally, i find that keynote is head and shoulders above powerpoint and i take it that you have never used iwork09.
there are also many alternatives to ms office and all compatible with it.
as an &quot;avid mac user&quot; you should know that mac stands for media access control, while mac stands for macintosh.
