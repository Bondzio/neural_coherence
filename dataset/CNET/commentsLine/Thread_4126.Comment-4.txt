and 4 years is a very long time for an external.
sounds like it did well.
by the way, if it's like all other externals it's a drive in a case and a cable.
three parts.
you can replace the part that failed.
for me i carry a cable in my recovery kit that i can test the drive with.
here it is.
i do that so often i don't give it much thought.
why would you consider ssd for an external?
sounds pricey and for now, still don't trust that media.
