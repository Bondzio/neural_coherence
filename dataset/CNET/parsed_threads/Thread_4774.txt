<s> please help </s>
<s> Hi: I just joined this forum but like to think I have helped out on others. </s>
<s> It seems that your drivers are incorrect and/or the hardware is not compatible with your OS. </s>
<s> What OS are you using? </s>
<s> Have you tried to update the driver directly from Device Manager? </s>
<s> If you bought the modem new it should have come with a driver disk. </s>
<s> hi, i have win98 yes the modem did come with the drivers on cd but i have gone crazy trying to fu=igure out why i have this missinf file after installing them. </s>
<s> I have tryed to update the driver in device manager but still receive the error when the computer boots up to the desktop. </s>
<s> the error that i am getting is the msvcp60.dll file is linked to missing export msvcrt.dll_ic_collate_cp the modem never shows up in the device manager only the pci enumerator problem. </s>
<s> It's either http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=240032 or something like it. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone, i have tryed everything and it still has problems so i went and bought a different modem and that one installed no problem. </s>
<s> Not sure what was wrong with the drivers for the first one. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help on it </s>
