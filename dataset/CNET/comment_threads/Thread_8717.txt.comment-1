Hi, Trying to print a stack of &quot;no.
6 3/4&quot; envelopes with my business return address.
It works great feeding them one at a time through the MP tray, but when I put a stack in the regulat tray, 75% come out printed crooked.
I have the side guides snugged down.
The nice guy at Canon hemmed and hawed and basically said my machine may have a problem, then said that model wasn't really designed for that...what the?
Anyone have luck printing more than one envelope at a time on a Canon multi functon laser D480?
