a 9550 dose not go near thee performace of a 5950 a 9550 is more like a fx 5600 maybe 5600 ultra ozos always being very intelegent i would go with the 5500 yet hat is still considered budget so a 5600 may be more suitable so u get the cinefx2.0 (thats what it is right) and other junk.
a safe older performace card is 5700 yet dont worry i played battlefield 2 on a 5200 (64meg) useing 4x agp in a notebook on low settings no lag.
this is just a few notes.
