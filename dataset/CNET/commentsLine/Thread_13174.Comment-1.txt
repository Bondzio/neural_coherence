hi there i was wondering if anyone could help me i'm completely useless with computers but i recently bought my daughter a 1tb western digital ext hdd 1021 to use while she attended university.
last night we had a power cut and after the power came back on both of our laptops refused to show the hard drive.
her laptop uses windows vista and mine has windows 7 and neither work.
it doesn't come up under my computer but it does come up in safely remove hardware and disk management but under disc management it says the hard drive is on disc 1, not initialised and unallocated.
and then when i try to initialise the device it comes up with an i/o device error.
as i said i'm completely useless with computers and this hard drive has all of my daughters university work on, so i was wondering if anyone could help me.
thank you
