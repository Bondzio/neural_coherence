Is this a peer-to-peer network and you cannot see this one in &quot;Network Places&quot;? is it a mapped drive that doesn't show up each time? Is this the only one of several with which this happens? If so, I'd look at that computer and your own.

It's a peer to peer and yes I keep losing it from my Network Places whenever I have to restart my computer for any reason. We also have a mapped netork drive that keeps dropping from some of our other computers as well whenever they have to restart byut thats a whole other issue =) Thanks!

So, when you go to view your network places, it's through that one device....or so I understand. There is some sort of &quot;pecking order&quot; that can determine which PC is most fit to be the &quot;master browser&quot;. PCs that drop off and come back on (are reset) or are added later, trigger some sort of polling activity to rebuild the list of network shares. Of course if the master browser is reset, the whole voting process needs to be repeated. This will probably account for temporary absences or devices that are slow to show up. I don't understand this process very well and I'm sure someone here can explain it better. You can google &quot;master browser&quot; for more reading. But, one thing that will affect this and might have something to do with your problem is which network services are running on each PC. Of course firewalls are a factor. I'm assuming you've already made your local network and exception in any firewall settings.
