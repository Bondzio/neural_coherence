I've asked around but the jury is still out...motherboard has been the suggested issue although this is a cheap computer so if I am to spend anymore money on it I would want to know it will fix the issue. Motherboard: ASUS P5K-E Power Supply: Corsair CX430 (new) HDD: WD 500Gb (new) Graphics: HIS 6450 (new) Basically my computer will start up fine 1/300 times. When it does work it works for a random period before freezing in a random screen, sometimes it works great, other times it seems to be running unusually slow. In the other 299/300 times when i turn the computer on all it seems to do is power up. It won't connect any monitor, keyboard, ext HDD etc. Recently I have noticed that if I turn my computer off at the powerpoint, or leave it off for a long period I find it will power up for 5 secs until it thinks for the first time - and then it turns itself off for about 3 secs - and then it powers up again has a little think and thats about it - it'll stay on in this state and just sit there - still not connecting any external stuff. It has a brand new internal HDD, power supply and graphics card...things people have previously suggested to be the issue. The CMOS battery has been removed and then the computer powered up to the same effect, however a new battery has not been tried. BIOS, drivers etc all up to date. Cheers. :)

Replace the dang battery, it will always be incorrect with the battery left out even with corrections will be lost upon the next power-ON. The CMOS is a few $ and worth it, if the PC is 2yrs. old or better. Next, after new battery installed, edit the bios that reflects what is proper, review you manual or allow defaults to rule, provided they match what is required. Your video may not be the most powerful, though it maybe taxing the PSU abit. Your PSU is a 430W? If so, it maybe at the lower end of PC needs and offers a borderline operation of the PC. Maybe after some time it finally is starting to falter or it's &quot;rail&quot; is less than capable. These ares of concern. How much ram is installed and what OS? Last, it may need a bios update, see what level yours is at and what's available. That update may correct for some issues provided they explain them(not always). But, if you have an update that's several levels above your current one, it maybe good to install. tada -----Willy

The psu has only been installed recently and has been running for about 24hrs, would it start to fail after such a short period? I have 2Gb of ram and windows 7 running - although operating system doesn't strike me as the issue seeing as majority of the problems happen before the OS loads. Last time the computer was momentarily working I got a computer literate mate of mine to install all new bios and drivers and that wasn't long ago. Thanks, keep the suggestions coming.
