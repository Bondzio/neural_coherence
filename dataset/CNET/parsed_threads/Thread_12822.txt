<s> Hi everybody, My cousin is having problems with his Gateway laptop running vista (yeah i know it sucks) anyways it shows that he is connected to the internet but when he goes to a website his browser gives him the &quot;page cannot be displayed&quot; page. </s>
<s> I had him connect the laptop directly to his belkin or linksys router (sorry for lack on information) and it was the same problem. </s>
<s> I have not yet went over and looked at the problem, i was kind of hopping someone on here has had a simular problem. </s>
<s> (went through basic steps by unplugging router and modem) still no results.... </s>

<s> Make sure network discovery is enabled and set to a Home network. </s>
<s> Can he get to the internet directly through the modem? </s>
<s> Can he get to the internet with no other computers on this router? </s>
<s> If you connect another computer tot he router does this one lose its ability to connect to the internet? </s>
<s> Have you tryed: ipconfig /flushdns & ipconfig /registerdns? </s>
<s> What does it say when you go to RUN &gt; CMD and type ipconfig /all (This is when you connected to the router) </s>
<s> When i connected the lap top to the modem i still could not access the internet, and at the time his computer was the only computer on the network, i did try flushing the dns but it gave me a message, i will try it and write everything down and post it for ya later on. </s>
<s> It doesn't seem to be if a computer connects he cannot connect, he just cannot connect at all. </s>
