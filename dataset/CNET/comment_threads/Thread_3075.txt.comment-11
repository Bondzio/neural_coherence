Just got a 1GB Corsair flash drive from New Egg for $24.99 which included free 3 day shipping.
I ordered it Tuesday and already have it.
There were many good reviews for this particular flash drive so I thought I would mention it.
It comes with a lanyard, CD for Win98 (should anyone have that), and an extension.
Seemed like a good deal.
