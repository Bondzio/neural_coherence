When I look in the printers folder I see a &quot;copy 1 hp1020&quot; along with the hp1020 printer. When I try to print to the &quot;copy 1 HP1020&quot; I'm then able to print. I'm not sure how or why &quot;copy 1 hp1020&quot; is installing or why I'm not able to print to the original &quot;hp1020&quot; It usually happens after I reconnect my laptop when returning home from work. I've had this happen with my HP 1100 printer also. I'm using XP pro. Thanks Bruce
