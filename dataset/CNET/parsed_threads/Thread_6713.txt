<s> I need to flush my print head. </s>
<s> Magenta - no printing and no nozzle pattern. </s>
<s> Black - a few spots of nozzle pattern after cleaning the print head plate but still no printing. </s>
<s> These two carts are new vendor other carts work OK. </s>
<s> Already tried to no effect: Twice (once has worked for years, not this time): 1 Isopropyl drops on ink spikes (1 hour to overnight) 2 One normal cleaning cycle. </s>
<s> Once: warm d-water/isopropyl/detergent solution in place of alcohol above. </s>
<s> Once: Paper towel soak of print head plate in 50/50 d-water and Windex overnight. </s>
<s> This helped the black print head go from zero nozzle pattern to a few spots on the pattern. </s>
<s> Still no printing. </s>
<s> Cleaning solutions I have: 70% isopropyl (effective under normal circumstances) 50/50 d-water/Windex d-water/isopropyl/detergent I have acquired a 10 ml syringe and tubing and want to flush the heads. </s>
<s> Question is how to do this safely without damage. </s>
<s> I know I am supposed to do it slowly with minimum pressure but how slow is slow. </s>
<s> What is the rate of flow? </s>
<s> 1 ml per 10 seconds, 1 ml per 30 seconds? </s>
<s> Can any of these solutions be used HOT and which would be most effective and safe for this purpose? </s>
<s> The printer also had weird carriage sounds/behavior. </s>
<s> It kept moving slowly, quietly and continuously even after shut off and shutdown. </s>
<s> Only ended after I turned off power strip overnight. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> And some might get upset on what's next (new print head or printer.) </s>
