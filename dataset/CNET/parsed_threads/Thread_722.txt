<s> I currently have a 250 watt power supply, and i want to upgrade it to a 400 watt so I can get a new graphics card. </s>
<s> My question is, do I have to get a make and model specific power supply, or can I buy a generic one in the store and put it into my computer? </s>
<s> I have a hp pavilion a520n 3200+ 512 mb pc2700 ddr sdram 160gb 7200RPM UDMA HD DVD+RW/CD-RW CD-ROM 48x </s>
<s> Because you have an HP model, you need to verify that whatvere you get fits. </s>
<s> The p/s unit itself is ATX12V class but it is physically different from typical generic p/s. </s>
<s> You can check this website for truly hi-quality unit and one that can fit: http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and yes they're expensive but worth it. </s>
<s> Of course, google for any HP ready p/s units or check HP parts surfer website for a better replacement beyond 250W, I believe 320W can be found or better. </s>

<s> http://www.power-on.com/hp.html </s>
<s> The only one that has a520n in it is the standard 250w supply. </s>
<s> Does that mean that it's not replaceable? </s>
<s> I checked HP replacement parts and that's the only one for that model. </s>
<s> The chancy part is using another model's part# that better wattage to fit, but you're on your own. </s>
<s> I checked in http://www.sparklepower.com that shows various p/s uits, I correct myself as yours is a ATX-SFX which means a fan blowing across the cpu or air channel to direct air directly on the cpu, besides any cpu fan itself. </s>
<s> Thewy try to better the system. </s>
<s> The important thing is the measurements they give for the p/s unit. </s>
<s> using that find a replacement which maybe an ATX type w/o a fan, but many are dual fan models, its the size that hurts, it bigger that the HP model, but I didn't do alot of checking. </s>
<s> Of course if you &quot;jerry-rig&quot; it, that an option. </s>
