I've included the MAC address into the router so by right everytime i turn on my laptop it should be able to connect to the router straight away right? I need to manually connect to the router by typing the SSID and the Passphrase everytime i want to connect to the router..Can anybody help me with this? By the way I'm using WPA-PSK security and my SSID is set to be hidden so that is why i have to include my MAC address..Thanx=)

Since there is no added security by doing that and it breaks some drivers why do that? Here's The Real Deal podcast and they give the SSID a failing grade as a security measure. http://digg.com/podcasts/The_Real_Deal_from_CNET/208840 If you insist on that setting you'll have to contact the makers to see if they'll fix it so that works.

Recently we got a spat of compromised and failing networks which I got real lucky to find out the cause. It's a new version of a WEP crack tool.
