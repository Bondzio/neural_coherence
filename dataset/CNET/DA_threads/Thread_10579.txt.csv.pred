1.1.1	Hi, We can't keep the wireless connection working on this PC: HP m1270n Windows XP Sp2 IE6 sp2 LAN - Linksys Wireless-B PCI Adapter WMP11 ISP - Grapevine Connection status shows limited or no connectivity.	St
1.1.2	This is the main PC: HP m11297c Windows XP Sp2 IE6 sp2 LAN - Linksys Router 802.11b SBC DSL - SpeedStream 5360 ISP - SBC Yahoo I went to Linksys' site and used their quick connect program and got it working but it loses it again.	St
1.1.3	Have done this several times.	St
1.1.4	If I use Linksys program should I disable the Windows wireless program?	St
1.1.5	There seems to be a conflict between them, maybe?	St
1.1.6	Or is it better to use one over the other?	St
1.1.7	Please keep in mind that I'm a novice at this but will follow instructions.	Sug
1.1.8	If I left anything out let me know.	St
1.1.9	Ernestine in southern California	St
1.2.1	but your lost connections can be due to outdated firmware for your various devices.	St
1.2.2	Hop on over to Linksys for the latest.	St
1.3.1	I should have mentioned we've only had these PCs about a month.	St
1.3.2	I also need to make a correction on the number for the network adapter, the tech put in WMP55AG but it is still supposed to work this router.	St
1.3.3	I went to Linksys and downloaded the driver update utility.	St
1.3.4	It won't run when I click setup.	St
1.3.5	Error says ''Cannot open file .\License.rtf'' There is a file ''License.rtf'' but I don't know where the ''.\'' came from.	St
1.3.6	And if I click ''License.rtf'' it opens so don't know why set up can't open it.	St
1.3.7	Have found and disabled 'Wireless Zero Configuration'.	St
1.3.8	Will let you know how it goes tomorrow.	St
1.3.9	Thank you so much for responding.	St
1.3.10	Ernestine in southern California	St
1.4.1	for the product.	St
1.4.2	Try clicking on the Setup icon.	St
1.5.1	Michael, I had clicked Setup first that is how I got the message that it couldn't open the RTF file.	St
1.5.2	The good news is that we are connection sharing again.	Polite
1.5.3	Don't know for how long because I went through all the same steps over and over and it just started working.	St
1.5.4	I did go in and disable the Windows Zero manager right after you said not to use both.	St
1.5.5	Maybe next time I'll enable it and try just depending on it to fix it.	St
1.5.6	Thank you for your help.	St
