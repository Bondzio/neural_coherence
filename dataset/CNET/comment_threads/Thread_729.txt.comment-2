thus you got the NT [no text], went back and added text but failed to remove the NT.
So then it looks as if your message has a subject line only.
The subject line is so vague that many won't bother.
Possibly make the post again without the NT, and then send a mod alert from this post of yours and ask them to remove it.
They can then also remove my reply.
Most times the Mods will comply.
