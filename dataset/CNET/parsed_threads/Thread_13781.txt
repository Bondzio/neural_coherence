<s> Processor fan and processor on my PC burnt up. </s>
<s> I want to extract data from it to a rental I have until I decide what I will buy. </s>
<s> I cant OPEN the rental to add the Hard Drives. </s>
<s> I CAN open my original. </s>
<s> I have a 120G WD and a 40G WD. </s>
<s> Is it possible to connect the two PCs and transfer the data? </s>
<s> My burnt one starts and runs XP for about 1-2 min then freezes. </s>
<s> The rental is XP and has all windows updates. </s>
<s> If I boot mine with MadBoot disk I can locate the files and it will stay operating. </s>
<s> When I load windows and boot normally it freezes. </s>
<s> You can smell it and the fan doesn't turn. </s>
<s> Is there a jumper cable I can buy that will let me access my harddrives without booting windows in the source? </s>
<s> If I extract the harddrives, is there a jumper that will connect them to the rental? </s>
<s> The power source on the original still works. </s>
<s> I have a WesternDigital Data Lifeguard Tools Disk. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> No I don't want to fix my dinosaur. </s>
<s> when the system boots up??. </s>
<s> Maybe you should do some troubleshooting. </s>
<s> Maybe simply CPU overheating due to clogged fan/heat sink, or loss of other fans. </s>
<s> There are so many causes of freezing, and the least likely is a bad CPU. </s>
<s> IMHO you are simply ignoring what seems to be the real indications of what is wrong with your PC. </s>
<s> your CPU must pass the POST [Power On Self Test] which among many other things proves that the CPU if functional. </s>
<s> If it fails later it is either temperature or non CPU issues. </s>
<s> You may have two options. </s>
<s> If you can borrow another PC which will allow you to connect your drives and network it to the rental, this might work. </s>
<s> Another idea, assuming the rental has USB available might be to get an external drive case and try that with the rental. </s>
<s> This might or might not work. </s>
<s> I have had decent luck putting drives in these cases with data already on them and having them recognized just fine. </s>
<s> Some folks haven't been so lucky, however. </s>
<s> It might be worth a try. </s>
<s> You can get these cases in the $30 to $50 dollar range and you can always keep it for later use. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Get a fan for your cpu before you do burn it up. </s>
<s> It won't cost much. </s>
