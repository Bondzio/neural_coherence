1.1.1	New Gateway FX6801-01; primary hard drive working normally, two additional hard drives installed, and at least once a day, one of the two secondary hard drives 'disappears'!	St
1.1.2	Reboot, and it's back.	St
1.1.3	If I have only two drives, the primary drive is OK, and the other drive 'disappears'!	St
1.1.4	Why am I 'losing' a hard drive from the system, 'sometimes'?	St
1.2.1	Failing drives or a power supply that dipped out at the right time.	St
1.2.2	With 3 drives and what else, is that the stock power supply?	St
1.2.3	And are you ready for the drives to vanish?	St
1.2.4	Backups all done?	St
1.3.1	NIL	St

1.5.1	These two additional hard drives are installed in the system's 'removable' slots...with one hard drive in place, it sometimes disappears; with two installed, one of them sometimes disappears.	St
1.5.2	Reboot returns system.	St
1.5.3	Power supply should not be considered a culprit, as it works with one or two removable drives.	St
1.5.4	Does anyone have any idea about how this may happen??	Ques
1.5.5	John	St
1.6.1	Removable bays especially IDE are well known to flake out over time.	St
1.6.2	I won't go into details but it is all about age, electrical noise increases due to capacitor aging and more.	St
1.6.3	Here's the problem.	St
1.6.4	The owner will likely tell you &quot;It worked before&quot; or &quot;It's worked for years.&quot; But don't let that bother you because that's the normal response to this and other age related issues.	St
1.6.5	Press on with updating 40 conductor cables to 80 conductor as well as outright moves to a bigger single drive.	St
1.6.6	Those that must have removeables usually are trouble at the shop counter.	St
1.6.7	Be sure to put on your best smile and help them save their files first and then let them figure it out that such may not be a supportable configuration.	St
1.6.8	Help them toss the drive trays and connect it up directly.	St
1.6.9	The moment the owner declares it can't be something, then the likelyhood increased it is that!	St
1.6.10	Hope this helps, Bob	St

1.8.1	No IDE...all SATA, and system is new	St
1.9.1	It worked before means little and if it's that new, make it the maker's problem.	St
1.9.2	Get your files out before the dropout wipes out the file system.	St
1.9.3	And removable drives are always trouble.	St
1.9.4	Just look in the storage forum for proof.	St

1.10.2	I thought it was the hard drive.	St
1.10.3	I put another SATA cable in it's place the problem disappeared completely never to be seen since.	St
