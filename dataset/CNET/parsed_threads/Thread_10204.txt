<s> Ok im trying to decide , should i get the bb playbook or Toshiba Thrive ? </s>
<s> I am just so conflicted because i like the bbpb os but there is just not that much support and i dont know if i could even count on it getting like flash updates and os updates. </s>
<s> But on the other hand there is the Thrive which i like and is the safe choice but is kinda bulky and i hear its kinda lagy with flash, but idk what do u think? </s>
<s> Look at the Apple/Microsoft eco-system and you have your answer. </s>
<s> Some can't see it, some won't accept it. </s>
<s> For now it appears to be 2 choices and the BB is a nice try but RIM upset the developers so for third and maybe fourth place they really needed to try harder. </s>
<s> But something in their DNA or culture interfered. </s>
<s> Unless the BB is 99 bucks, I'd ignore it. </s>

<s> We own three tablets. </s>
<s> They are three different os' (Android/iOS/webOS) If you want Android take a look at the Asus Transformer or Samsung Galaxy 10.1 (or their other sizes) I am not even sure if RIM is going to continue on with the playbook, and the thrive is a little too unpolished. </s>
<s> Hi, Both the Laptops you have mentioned are not up to the market. </s>
<s> The One leading in the market is Apple iPad 2. </s>
<s> Then next comes the Samsung Galaxy Tab. </s>
<s> Good to know how did you narrow choice to these two particular tablets. </s>
<s> I guess it was form factor, many people think that 10 inches too big for tablet purpose. </s>
<s> And I have to agree here. </s>
<s> However 7 inches tablet niche is wide, you can check also Amazon fire and sumsung galaxy 7.7. </s>
<s> But returning back to your question Playbook is currently $300, but it doesn't have external SD slot Thrive will be available in December most likely for $450 and hard to buy, however I would strongly consider it, because better screen and SD card slot. </s>
<s> You should pick the unit that you are most comfortable with. </s>
<s> Though if you want a device that can play flash, don't get an Ipad. </s>
<s> Flash won't work on the Ipad. </s>
<s> I also heard the Android OS is pretty efficient, you could check out those Android ones. </s>
