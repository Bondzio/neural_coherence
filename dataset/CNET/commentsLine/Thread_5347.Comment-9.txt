if you have very weak wireless signal (using the onboard adapter with the antenna) then, as i suggested, if the router is near enough to the desktop, hook it up hardwire, this is a far better way to go.
you could buy a usb input wireless adapter, that might help but again, impediments (things in the way) can block the signal to your unit from the router.
hardwire hook ups are always superior to wireless, especially in a desktop application.
