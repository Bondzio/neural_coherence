if you don't now then you truly need to know what specs your old system was.
visit  and using your known model# or mtrbd.
info verify what you have.
i'm sure that ddr is the end result.
you can not swap ddr and ddr2 ram into each other slots, beleieve it, there is a physical limitation of the actual ram module, google for pics.
if you find another p4 mtrbd.
then again verify if you can re-use ddr into its ram slots.
this is all explained clearly by the specs of that system/mtrbd., so be sure what you have.
as for your actual ram 512mb and 1gb both being ddr aren't going to be installed in any ddr2 slot, period.
though, if you find a new p4 mtrbd.
and ddr ram capable, yes the ram can be re-used.
as for handling any ram, re-use the anti-static bags or material.
if none is present, the best available substitute, use plain copy/office paper, just keep handling to a minimum and de-static(esd) yourself before handling, by grounding to some metal.
google for esd characteristics.
i hope, i made myself clear.
