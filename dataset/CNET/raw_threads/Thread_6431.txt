I have tried logging on to the router to check the wireless settings but cannot access it, i have also tried connecting directly via LAN but cannot get this to work either although i am not sure if i have connected it correctly? Any ideas/comments/advice is very much appreciated!! Thanks in advance, BigG2.

Use a working Internet connection to download and install ALL the latest drivers from the PC maker's website. If you purchased the wireless adapter separately, download and install the wireless adapter drivers from the adapter maker's website. Make a wired connection to a numbered port on the back of the router. Can you log in to the routers admin page now? * * * * * Ultimately, you need to follow the procedure to install the latest firmware on the router: http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/WGT624v3.asp The REFERENCE MANUAL is there, too.

Before this however, I will try to login using a different Ip address; 192.168.0.1 as opposed to the 192.168.0.2 as it says in the manual. If anyone else had this problem can you tell me what you did to resolve it?? Jon

Then i connected a LAN cable to the modem and logged in to it that way, then i ran the wizard and hey presto it works!! Maybe this will work for you as well! Regards, BigG.....

Probably the last one will work. Rick

Netgear indicated that the installation guide and software can be downloaded from their website, but I could only find firmware. Anyone know where I can find installation software?

All computers connected to the router still have internet, but I can't log into the router at all with routerlogin or IP Addresses. And I can't connect to the router wirelessly at all. Any suggestions?

Start, run or hit the Windows Key and the R key at the same time. typr cmd hit enter type ipconfig /all (space between the g and /) hit enter look for the default gateway. Might look something like 192.168.1.1 What ever the default gateway is, Open your browser and type the default gateway in the browser. It will then prompt you for your username and password. Hope this helps. Rick

Try to login to the router by directly connecting your computer (preferably the one you used on initial setup)to it. Normally, as others have pointed out, you just type in 192.168.1.1 to connect to the router via a web browser. If this fails then you may have to reset the router so that you can login using the default username & password. Netgear's official support page: http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/WGT624v3.asp

Setting the laptop to DHCP it got the same Ip !92.168.1.2 from the netgear switch but the page loaded. what a wonderful way to kill a day so much fun. I consider this a bug as the ipconfig /all returned the same thing for my setting whether I hard set the IP mask and gateway or I let DHCP do it. Yet one works and one doesn't.
