<s> Hi, I hope you can help. </s>
<s> I am trying to help out a friend with XP. </s>
<s> He has 2 external hard drives on is a 500 GB Western Digital the other is a 1.5 GB Solo External Hard Drive Fireproof and Waterproof...yeh a little over kill! </s>
<s> His computer is about 8 year old Dell...it even has a floppy drive. </s>
<s> He saves everything! </s>
<s> His hard drive has almost no free space. </s>
<s> What I would love to do is set up his computer to save all his files directly to the 500 GB hard drive. </s>
<s> Not on his computers hard drive! </s>
<s> I was going to partition the 1.5 GB hard drive so there is a complete back up of his computer hard drive on the first partiion. </s>
<s> Also, I would love to sync his 1.5 GB second partition to his 500 GB hard drive (which is actually saving all his files? </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions? </s>
<s> I have figured out how to assign dirve letters. </s>
<s> I know how to partition. </s>
<s> I don't know how to sync one hard drive to the other or automatically save files directly to the 500GB. </s>
<s> Note: I have backed up his hard drive right now to the 500GB. </s>
<s> Using windows back up. </s>
<s> He deleted the WD software of the 500GB! </s>
<s> Thanks for your time...ynotbme &lt;div class=&quot;inter-pagination collapsable&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postActions collapsable clearfix clearboth&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> isn't an external drive just another drive. </s>
<s> Why can't you do thing with it just like an internal one (except maybe putting an OS there). </s>
<s> you can move the My Documents folder to the other drive. </s>
<s> There is also the MS &quot;tweakui&quot; powertool that can help. </s>
<s> It has an option regarding special folders of which My Documents is one of these. </s>
<s> It will help redirect the default locations where such files tend to land. </s>
<s> Personally I prefer using the &quot;save as&quot; option and don't find it that inconvenient. </s>
<s> But, if that's what your friend wants, it can be done. </s>
