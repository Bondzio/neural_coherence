Sorry, thanks for the attempt to help.
But - QT &quot;7&quot; is installed in the Utilities Folder &quot;under&quot; Snow Leopard.
I have been using QT Pro - (that extra cost feature carries forward so that registered ,paid, users can continue to use QT Pro for basic movie editing) - since I upgraded to 10.6 about 6 months ago.
Unless what you say is a more recent development, users should still be able to use QT 7 - Pro for basic editing.
Apple did this split-off because they have a large number of customers who paid for the QT 7 Pro app and need it for actual movie editing tasks (which are not available in iMovie, for example).
It gets a little complicated because iMovie has a different way of doing the voice overs and it (to my knowledge) cannot join short clips into a single larger clip.
So - if you have specific information about using iMovie (or any Mac app) for these tasks, I'd appreciate knowing about it.
