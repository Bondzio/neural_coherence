1.1.1	I am an owner of an Apple Titanium Powerbook (15in 867MHZ).	St
1.1.2	It is almost 2 years old, I believe it was the last 15in TI model they made before the new design.	St
1.1.3	I love the laptop and it still serves me well.	St
1.1.4	I recently upgraded to 10.4 Tiger and love it, the problem is I never purchased an original Apple Airport card and the Airport Extreme cards are not compatable.	St
1.1.5	I don't want to overpay for an original slower AirPort card.	St
1.1.6	I bought the D-Link DWL-G650X AirPlus G because the options that I have found are pretty limited and I trusted D-link.	St
1.1.7	It said on their site it was compatable with 10.3 or higher, but then I got it and now they tell me it is not yet compatable with 10.4 Tiger and they don't know when it will be.	St
1.1.8	The customer service has been a joke and I will most likely never buy a D-Link product again.	St
1.1.9	I have seen a few other 3rd party apple wireless cards, but mainly from companies I have not heard of.	St
1.1.10	I am about ready to give up and sell my powerbook and just get a new one with AirPort Extreme already installed.	St
1.1.11	I don't really want to do that, I like the design the Powerbook I have and want to keep it, but wireless technology has come so far in 2 years when I bought it, I did not even think that much of needing wireless, now its almost a must for a laptop owner.	St
1.1.12	Are there other cards out there that are compatable but they just don't mention it on the box?	St
1.1.13	Or is there any other solutions I am not thinking of?	Ques
1.1.14	Again, I am running OS 10.4.1 Tiger and that is the reason the D-Link card is not working, but I have heard some bad things about that card since I bought it anyway.	St
1.1.15	I need some help!	St
1.2.1	Macfixit knows this area well.	St
1.2.2	Post in the forums they patrol.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
