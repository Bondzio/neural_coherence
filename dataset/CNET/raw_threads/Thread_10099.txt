I built the desktops and configured them. All share two networked printers and the network performance has been good. I've got one nagging problem between my desktop and the wifes T40 Thinkpad. I don't have similar users defined on each. I do have simple file sharing off and have shares on both systems. Each does at least one share allowing &quot;Everyone&quot; at least read access. All PCs are part of the same network. Here's the issue. When I attempt to access the laptop from my desktop, I am presented with a login screen and can enter my wife's username/password. But, If I attempt to access my PC from her laptop, I get the message that I don't have proper permissions. Actually, this is what I'd expect from both as neither the administrator or user accounts share the same password. I know I could just duplicate an account to make this go away but something is different between the two. I'm not understanding why I get the login screen accessing the laptop from my desktop and not visa versa. Is this a service or local policy issue I'm missing on one these? BTW, hers is generally connected wirelessly but using the wired connection makes no difference.

The other desktop PCs have similar user accounts/passwords on them so connecting and sharing is a no-brainer. Interestingly, I can connect to my company provided laptop which is in a domain. I am presented with a login screen and must provide the necessary domain information. I don't have a similar account on this laptop as my desktop either. Still, I can connect to a share I created to move files back and forth. As for understanding the difference between &quot;everyone&quot; and &quot;anyone&quot;, yes, I certainly am aware of that. The puzzle to me is why, without similar accounts on these two devices, I can connect from one but not the other. The other desktops have an account with her username/password and so they connect readily. Certainly I can create an account on either my desktop or her laptop that matches an existing one and it will work as expected.

It shares the same workgroup name as the other PCs. Curiously I am currently setting up another Lenovo laptop to replace her aging one and I am encountering the same issue with this one. Attempted access from my desktop (wired or wireless) is greeted with a logon window. Attempted access from the laptop to my desktop gets the (station name) not accessible message. &quot;You might not have permission...etc.&quot; I will figure this out. Thanks for the reply.

A mismatch or missing account on the machine you are on and the machine you are trying to connect to. d. The permissions on the share do not include the account you are using. Item d can confound most. Tip: Create the share AFTER you create accounts. Windows may not always add that new user to the share. Bob
