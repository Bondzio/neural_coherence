<s> This is message I sent to the head of marketing at Motorola. </s>
<s> This sums it up: I am every consumer tech companies dream customer. </s>
<s> I'm the early adapter who pays top dollar in order to get the newest tech as soon as it comes out. </s>
<s> I also used to be a Motorola customer, however, Motorola has done everything in its power to alienate customers like me. </s>
<s> I was one of the Droid Bionic customers Motorola purposely screwed over. </s>
<s> First they delayed the launch for months. </s>
<s> Then they launched it knowing they were going to launch the Razr, a superior product, in two months for the same price. </s>
<s> I paid a premium price to get a premium product and ended up with lower end tech. </s>
<s> Now, I have to wait for the Ice Cream Sandwich update because, of course, the Razr is getting it first . </s>
<s> I don't need to hear about how quickly things become obsolete in the tech world. </s>
<s> I've been an early adapter since the they came out with the Commodore 64. </s>
<s> I accept how quickly the tech product life cycle runs. </s>
<s> Two months had nothing to do with life cycle, this was Motorola screwing customers to make up for poor product planning. </s>
<s> I was in product marketing, development and management for twenty years. </s>
<s> This was just short sighted and stupid on Motorolas part. </s>
<s> I know a number of Bionic owners that have sworn off Motorola because of this stunt. </s>
<s> Even with the Bionic debacle, however, I was willing to give Motorola a break. </s>
<s> That is until I went to upgrade my Xoom tablet to 4G. </s>
<s> When Verizon came out with their Data Share Plan a couple weeks ago, I decided to upgrade my Xoom and connect it to Verizons 4G LTE service. </s>
<s> Prevously, Verizons data plans didn't make this cost effective and I wasn't going to be without my Xoom for a week in order to upgrade it when I wasn't using the service. </s>
<s> Besides, there was nothing said about a deadline for upgrading the device when I bought it. </s>
<s> Imagine my surprise when I went to upgrade my Xoom and was told Motorola decided they were no longer doing upgrades! </s>
<s> And of course in another example of Motorola's brilliant product planning, they do this just as Verizon comes out with a plan that makes upgrading the device worthwhile. </s>
<s> Here's the long and short of it. </s>
<s> I paid a premium for a device that was 4G upgradable so I had this option when I needed it. </s>
<s> Now I want the upgrade I paid for. </s>
<s> I have bought a lot of tech and have never been this angry at a manufacturer or service provider. </s>
<s> Phones and tablets are not upgradeable today when compared to our PCs. </s>
<s> Also, the plan is for the life span of the phone or tablet to be 2 or less years. </s>
<s> There. </s>
<s> I've written the dirty secret in plain words for folk to read. </s>
