<s> I'd stick with the iPad 2 or later. </s>
<s> what is a good company that makes the IPad 2? </s>
<s> &quot;Which company made the iPad 2&quot;? </s>
<s> That's Apple. </s>
<s> You can see the current models at Apple.com I noted to stick with the 2 or later since some seem to not want the older model. </s>

<s> A sparrow is a bird, but not all birds are sparrows; there are other kinds of birds, like swallows and starlings. </s>
<s> The question &quot;are sparrows and birds the same thing&quot; is a rather strange question. </s>
<s> And just like that there are other kinds of tablets than iPads. </s>
