willy, yes that is the card.
as i said, there is an unused 4 pronged inline plug available but that would not fit the card nor even reach it.
i am hoping rs has the plug available when i go back.
thanks for the help.
as for the internal dvd vs external, i wrestled with that but went with an external ( even though they are more expensive) because i have 2 other computers ( a laptop and another desk top) neither of which has a dvd burner, so i figured i would be able to use the 1 burner for 3 computers.
plus my main pc s almost 4 yrs old so i might soon need to buy a new one anyway.
thanks for the replies.
