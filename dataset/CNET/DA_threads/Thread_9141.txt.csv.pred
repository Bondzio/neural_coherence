1.1.2	i am looking for an internally installed All in One Media Card Reader with a method of connection for a PC without an internal USB Header.	St
1.1.3	Does anyone know if such a device is made or any work arounds?	Ques
1.2.1	Maybe your common external can be mounted internally then run the USB cord through the machine and out the back to a port.	St

1.3.1	they're usually called X+1 cards where X is the number of external usb ports and the +1 is an internal port.	St
1.3.2	you can pop the internal usb connector off to access the header.	St
