<s> I am working to set up a home business, I am developing a web site to sell albums, I have a linux and an xp pro system that I want to network together. </s>
<s> I also want to burn most of my albums to cd after first converting them to mpegs. </s>
<s> One of my concerns is security on a wireless network, but more than that, I have a neighbor that has put a radio antenna up on his roof and its not so bad anymore, but when he gets on his cb and cranks up his amplifier, I get him coning over my computer speakers and Ive even heard him over my tv set which is satellite. </s>
<s> I know that amplifing is illegal, but trying to get any action out of the fcc is next to impossible. </s>
<s> Thats why I am thinking of going a physical ethernet network. </s>
<s> Any comments would be appreacated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Its secured and you don't have to worry about radio interference... its negligible if any... As for your TV and PC Speaker... ask your radio shack people for a device that can reduce such interference. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> Hey thanks Melati, thats what I thought too. </s>
