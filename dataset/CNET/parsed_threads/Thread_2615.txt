<s> In my event viewer, there are numerous entries for a 'bad block' on my hard drive. </s>
<s> A friend of mine suggested that I do not need a new hard drive, but to merely mark that spot as unusable with some third-party software (Norton?). </s>
<s> My question is two fold: 1.) </s>
<s> Should I be concerned with the bad block to the point of buying a new drive? </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> If #1 is not necessary, can I use a tool to make the bad block disappear/hidden? </s>
<s> If so, what tool would be a good one to try? </s>
<s> Also, I have backed up all of my important data, so that part is taken care of. </s>
<s> I am running an AMD Athlon 2700+ with 1GB RAM and Maxtor 160GB hard drive on WinXP Pro (SP1). </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help in advance! </s>
<s> You may get a report and a replacement drive. </s>
<s> However, if you connected said drive with a 40 conductor IDE cable, errors are common. </s>
<s> Also, errors are common in overheated cases or stressed power supplies. </s>

<s> Thansk Bob. </s>
<s> The drive is connected via IDE and my temp monitoring software has not alerted me of any problems, so I don't suspect that. </s>
<s> The power supply shouldn't be suspect either. </s>
<s> The only extra perifs are DVD-R (no FDD, 2nd CD, etc.) </s>
<s> I'll try the Maxtor software. </s>
<s> Didn't think of that... </s>
