I'd be using two different laptops, both of which are wireless enabled. The main requirement is security. I've read a number of posts in this forum. It appears that the most popular router brands are more or less equal, and that the purchaser should take the time to update them and set them up properly. Beyond that, if security overrides all other considerations, what steps should I take to maximize security?

Since you want &quot;maximum&quot; security you will have to look into more expensive solutions. Sorry but that requirement means the supplied means are not going to work for you. Bob

WPA2 encryption is still considered good and secure, this is the encryption you should use for improving your wireless security. Most of the time you can determine how secure is your wireless network by setting up the network properly. Have a quick look on this link on how to secure wireless network: http://www.home-network-help.com/wireless-network-security.html Here is detailed explanation on how to set up wireless network: http://www.home-network-help.com/wireless-network.html Hope this helps..

I'll start. It all has to do with federal export restrictions on encryption. For instance no one dare implement a secure public key method like PGP. -&gt; Tell me more. Bob
