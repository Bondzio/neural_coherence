<s> I just bought a new PC with a SATA Hard Drive, fine. </s>
<s> I have an IDE Hard Drive that I wanted to put in to in as a second drive from my old PC. </s>
<s> Is there compatibility issues that I don't of? </s>
<s> I tried for a good while to get it to see it but it won't. </s>
<s> Anyone have a idea. </s>
<s> The SATA drive doesn't connect to the traditional IDE port, obviously, so I'm thinking that has something to do with it. </s>
<s> I don't know. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Rich </s>
<s> for the ribbon cable for your old PATA drive?? </s>
<s> Nowadays we must use PATA and SATA because both are actuall IDE drives as well as ATA drives. </s>
<s> The data cable for PATA drives are the 40 pin ribbons. </s>
<s> SATA data cable is much smaller. </s>
<s> The sytem should see the older drive IF you have it jumpered properly for how it is plugged into the new computer. </s>
<s> {Probably need to jumper the drive as Cable Select (CS)]. </s>
<s> Some PCs don't come with all the interfaces/ports enabled in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Check your PC/mobo manual. </s>
<s> Also, is it plugged into the power and spinning up? </s>
<s> (I've made that simple mistake more than I'd care to admit.) </s>
<s> The only place it says disabled is in the RAID configuration, but I'm not trying to set up a raid configuration. </s>
<s> As far as power, I don't hear it spinning, but the power connector appears to come directly from the power supply. </s>
<s> usually, you can feel a drive spin up. </s>
<s> put your finger on the top (smooth) side of the drive and cold boot your pc -- you should feel a difference. </s>
<s> if this came from an old pc, put it back in that pc and see if it still works. </s>
<s> if so, network the two and copy the data. </s>
<s> i'm sorry, but i can't think of anything else that might help figuring out why it won't work in your new one. </s>
