I have never done this before so I thought I might contact HP and ask if it was possible to do this. They asured me that it was possible as long as the new hard drive ran the same rmps as the old one. They told me if the rpms were not the same I would not be able to use my system recovery disks that I created from the computer. They then tried to sell me a external hard drive which I was really not interested in. I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive but I want an internal one. I just wanted to ask if any one knows that this might be true and what has the rpms got to do with my system disks. The hard drive I now have is an 5400 rpm and I did look at the new one I wanted to buy and it said it was 7200 rpm..Would it be better for me to buy an external hard drive. I don't want to go into the expense of a new hard drive and then not be able to use my system disks..Thank you, Wright5972

The easiest thing to do would be to clone the drive you have now and copy that image to the new drive.

You can download the free HD cloning utility from the HD maker if the utility isn't included with the new dreve. The cloning utility copies the image of the old HD to the new HD.

If you are using any of the OS that needs Microsoft activation, moving the OS to a new hard drive may cause the OS not to work (MS think that you are installing the OS to another PC). This may be the reason why HP is giving you the warning of RPM different. You need to call MS to reactivate the system for you. For simpilcity, I'll just add a new internal or external (USB) HD.

You can do both you know. The 80gb would be your c: and the additional Drive would be a storage D: Installation is easy and you can even format the new drive using your existing C: windows drive. Also, you should note on your HP, there is a sticker with the license number. If you had to install your OS again. This number would be what you use. In the rare case Microsoft gives you a hard time. A phone call to their customer support will take care of it. Not sure if you wanted to replace the drive. In that case you will want to back up the information you want. Obtain an OS disk(that matches your current version) and do a fresh install. That is the easiest sure fire method. Cloning a drive as stated earlier, can cause license issues. Hope this helps.

Plus when I do install some of the games the files or part of them go to the C drive which eats up more space. That is the reason why I want to go to a bigger drive. I haven't attempted the clone because I still haven't had my ? answered about the partition. The C drive is partitioned into a D drive. I am trying to find out what to do in this and whether I will need to partition the new drive or not. This part of puters I am still new at.
