but that's not feasible.
the whole point of the wireless network in the first place was to avoid running cat5 through my house, which this would obviously entail.
i just need a switch downstairs, where there's a concentration of equipment, some with wifi capability and some without.
and also, just for the record, it's also not feasible to move the cable modem and wireless router downstairs.
thanks for the response though
