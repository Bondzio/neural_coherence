I've not tried this but it's possible to boot up XP in safe mode with networking.
You restart each PC and press F8 just before Windows loads.
You'll be presented with a menu of boot options.
Select safe mode with networking.
Do this for both machines and try the ping command from there.
If it works, we have something loading that's blocking the connection.
If not, we get to look elsewhere.
