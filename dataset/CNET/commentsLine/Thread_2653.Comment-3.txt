hi bob, thanks for your quick response.
the laptop is a dell 9400 inspiron (i believe express).
returning the parallel dongle for a usb is going to be an expensive proposition - hence am looking for alternatives.
i heard that the targus replicator may address the issue.
would you be able to shed some light on it?
