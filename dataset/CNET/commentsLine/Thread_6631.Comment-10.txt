i have nothing against low-profile pcs; many people like the much smaller footprint.
but, you need to be aware that your video card upgrade options are more limited because you need a low-profile card.
that said, i think the intel core 2 duo version - s3200t - offers more flexibility in configuration than the amd version.
you can configure one starting at about $450.
btw: i own an hp media center pc and it's the best designed and most reliable pc i've ever owned.
in my experience, hp is a good choice for pcs.
