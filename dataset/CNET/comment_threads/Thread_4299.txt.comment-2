The power supply was only sized to power what HP/Compaq provided.
i.e.
If you upsize to some over 1 GHz CPU and such, then you have to upsize the power supply to match.
http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/02q4/021021/ is a starting point to see that you want to avoid the 350 Watt power units and skip right to 450 to just remove this from your issue list.
Another issue is heat.
The HP/Compaq case was again for a 700 or so MHz CPU with so many Watts to let so much heat out.
You'll likely to have to rework the metal to fit another case fan too.
Power tools and tin snips are handy for this work.
