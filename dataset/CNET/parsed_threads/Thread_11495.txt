<s> My friend built my computer with windows me when I go to system information it tells me that my drives have been partitioned into 3drives Disk#0 partion#0, Disk#0 Partion#1(which is my c-drive) and Disk#0 partition#2. </s>
<s> Somebody tell me how I can fix this problem as whenever I load anything it tells me I have no space but yet I have a 40gb hard drive. </s>
<s> My computer is a 900 amd athlon with a chaintech socket a nvidia nforce2 motherborad. </s>
<s> If the installer of the OS didn't answer the Large Disk Support question with Yes, you get 2GB on C: and run out of space. </s>
<s> Fixing this is easy with Partition Magic, but since it's new, just start over. </s>

<s> Bob, The partition is in Linux form that makes it harder to get rid and reloading my windows disk doesnt resolve the problem. </s>
<s> They had a thing on c-net called partition magic which was a free version but because it was Linux it wouldnt do anything about it. </s>
<s> Seems quite the experts only setup. </s>
<s> You may need the full version of Partition Magic or research http://librenix.com/?inode=3503 Sorry to read the initial setup was flubbed. </s>
