1.1.1	I have a Iomega 1TB Storcenter 4HD x 250 MB Network Har Drive formatted in a Striped 0+1 configuration and have experienced two instances of data losses due to power issues with the unit and am currently struggling to retrieve my data from it without having to spend some big bucks at a data recovery service.	St
1.1.2	The first was before placing it on a UPS Unit, but the 2nd happened when it's $30 external power supply faulted.	St
1.1.3	Seems if you spike the drive controller card it will loose communication with the drive and show them as Off Line - and there is now way to get them back On Line without going through a Re-Format of the drive (thereby losing all data on the drive) that I've found or Iomega can provide.	St
1.1.4	Their solution would be to replace the drive if it were in warranty?	St
1.1.5	There is a repair utility on the Discovery software utility, but no one at Iomega can tell me what will happen if you use this and a couple of their Tech's even suggested it may just start a Re-Format on it's own?	St
1.1.6	Anyone out there ever experienced this or have a solution?	St
1.2.1	You see a recurring refrain which is &quot;where is the backup?&quot; -&gt; But let me share that I saw those units fail but learned to remove the case cover to let the heat get out and then we were able to use them for hours.	St
1.2.2	Good luck, Bob	St
