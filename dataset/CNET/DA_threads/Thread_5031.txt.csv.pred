1.1.1	I have two LAN connections from two different service providers, and obviously with different conncetivity settings.	St
1.1.2	The PC is currently having one ethernet connector.	St
1.1.3	How can I configure my PC to run both LANs at the same time but with different settings?	St
1.2.1	it sounds like you have 2 ISP's, in which case you need to just take the faster of the two if you have a in-house/in-office LAN + your internet and want to connect to the web + have the LAN you need to get a router, and feed it into the switch or hub that your using for the office so it can provide the internet to everybody/thing configuration of 2 LAN's on a single PC is possible if you have 2 NIC's	St
1.3.1	We do have an in-house LAN sort of a thing but recently our boss decided to get another ISP running in case te first one bogs down.	St
1.3.2	I did installed another NIC in addition to the Built-In Ethernet connector.	St
1.3.3	But how will I configure IE6 with two opposite settings?	St
