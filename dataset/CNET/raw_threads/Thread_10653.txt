Server. It tells me I need to enter the password. After I enter the password it takes forever &quot;verifying&quot; then tells me &quot;The IMAP server &quot;apple.imap.mail.yahoo.com&quot; is not responding. Check your network connection and that you entered the correct information in the &quot;incoming Mail Server&quot; field.&quot; I cannot find any &quot;incoming Mail Server&quot; field and the outgoing mail server fields are grayed out so I cannot make changes. I can still get the mail when I go to the Yahoo! Web site using Safari. Does anyone know what the problem is or have suggestions? I didn't have any problem getting the mail prior to my software upgrade.

Make sure it is connected I have been having problems now connecting to WiFi w/ O/S 4.2 even though the icon shows 100% contacted, once I get a page too load it is fine.

I deleted the account that I made at home and redid it when I was on another wifi network at work. It worked ever since. However when I go home it won't update. I deleted the account again and tried to rejoin but it does the same thing it did before. I will redo the account t work again on Monday. This tells me the issue is with my cable router (motorola sbg900). Perhaps a port or something.
