I would like a card reader like 8-in-1 or so..inexpensive. Also a modem and NIC. Plan on other small costs. On the video card...go with the Gigabyte you listed as the Fujiplus doesn't list 'Core Clock' or 'Memory Clock' neither at their home site. Note absence of 'reviews'. Processor OK, I would go with the Platinum Ultra on the mobo. Case power supply may be a cheapo, but can change out later if not good enough.

With that should i go for the cheaper mobo? also I'll get the gigabyte videocard. Anyone post links for a seperate power supply, should i find a cheaper case then that doesnt include a power supply? As for an OS i have already one here and I don't need one of those 8 in 1 readers since i can just hook up my camera via usb and shouldnt onboard NIC be good enough? I plan on using cable internet so i don't to waste $$ on a modem.

With that should i go for the cheaper mobo? also I'll get the gigabyte videocard. Anyone post links for a seperate power supply, should i find a cheaper case then that doesnt include a power supply?

I plan on using cable internet so i don't to waste $$ on a modem.&quot; um, i would keep the mobo for future sli, as you might change your mind. power supply, show around newegg for antec or ocz, get at least 480 watts. onboard sound uses the cpu, aka adds more usage to it which lowers gaming performance. for me, i do fine with integrated sound, but i do plan on getting a soundcard in the future when i have enough money. i use a logitech headset as my speakers i think you will be happy with your build. konny

Thanks for the info AKonny, i got another question, is there any difference if i get a refruibished items like a graphic cards then retail verison? I am going to stick with this mobo http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813130491 I truely beilve that I'm not going to play extreme games, i stated i was going to play BF2, as in maybe a hour a week or even a month, most of my friends don't play it. Another question is I am thinking about buying this case http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144001 instead of the this one http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144026 I dont see a difference in the 2 cases. Final question, will i need to buy a 20pin to 24pin converter mobo to psu?
