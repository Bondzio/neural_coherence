To it I have connected my Dell Windows XP Pro desktop and Canon printer (both with Ethernet cables). Wirelessly connected, I have a Belkin Skype phone, a Dell Vista Ultimate laptop, and I used to have an HP Ipaq 4350. My wireless network successfully recognized all of the above devices until about 2 weeks ago and then it seemingly cannot see the HP Ipaq, even though the Ipaq says it has successfully connected to the network. (I have listed all of the wireless devices Mac addresses in the network so that they alone have access to the wireless network.) I have tried many things. I did a network reset but that did not resolve the problem. I renamed the network to see if there was something lingering in memory someplace that was causing the problem. Is there anything that I can do to rectify the situation? The settings for the Ipaq Network Authentication are: Checked Data encryption (WEP enabled) Unchecked Network authentication (shared mode) Checked The Key is provided for me automatically. There is a Network Key (represented by stars) Key index is listed as 1 Checked Enable network access using IEEE 802.1x EAP Type is listed as TLS but additional options are PEAP Under properties there is a warning message: Cannot log on to the wireless network. This network requires a personal certificate to positively identify you. This must be the problem, but if I have put in my MAC address for this device, what more is wanted. How do I provide this personal certificate? Any help greatly appreciated. Mary

Thate is no security at all today with WEP+MAC addresses so why not move to WPA? Bob
