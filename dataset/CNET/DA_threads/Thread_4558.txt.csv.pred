1.1.1	I want to get my nephew a tablet for his 13th birthday, but do not want to spend $300.00 for one.	St
1.1.2	I know this limits my choice a lot, but I think it is the best way to go.	St
1.1.3	I have been looking at the Kindle Fire, Nook Tablet, Blackberry Playbook and the Acer Iconia Tablet A100-07U08U.	St
1.1.4	This bring me between $200 and $250 which is a good price.	St
1.1.5	It does not need to be an extensive tablet just something he can facebook, games and surf the net on.	St
1.1.6	Any suggestions would be great, I am flexible with the OS and am not a hater of other stuff.	St
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	It's 199 and if you get lucky Amazon has refurbished units once in awhile.	St
1.2.2	http://www.phonearena.com/news/Refurbished-Kindle-Fire-goes-on-sale-for-139_id28563 Frankly I think you should not invest too much on these.	St
1.2.3	Yes, we have them but we don't use them much.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I would go with either the Kindle Fire, the Acer, or the Lenovo IdeaPad.	St
1.3.2	However, if the 13 year old would like a camera on the tablet, then don't get the Kindle Fire since it has no cameras.	St
1.3.3	I know the Lenovo has both a front and rear camera and is the same price as the Kindle Fire.	St
1.3.4	Unless one roots the Kindle or the Nook, I think, they only have access to either Amazon's or B&N&quot;s app stores.	St
1.3.5	The Acer and Lenovo have access to the Android Market.	St
1.3.6	One can also install the Kindle and Nook readers on these to read their books and such.	St
1.4.1	If not for the rather bad screen quality, Lenovo IdeaPad would be my fave for sure, as it has excellent specs.	St
