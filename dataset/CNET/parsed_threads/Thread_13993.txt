<s> I need to replace my power supply. </s>
<s> Thing is, I'm pretty sure the model I have isn't made anymore. </s>
<s> My question is - can I go with different specs? </s>
<s> i.e., can I go with a higher wattage? </s>
<s> Does the input voltage/ampage need to match? </s>
<s> Basically, what do I have to look for in the specs of a purchase so it's compatible with my tower. </s>
<s> I'm powering 1 hard drive, 2 rom's, audio, video card, and a floppy drive. </s>
<s> I've found some really good deals online but I dont want to buy something I cant use. </s>
<s> Here's my current specs -- INPUT RATING: 115V-6A 230V-3A 50/60Hz OUTPUT RATING: 235W (MAX) RED +5V 23A YELLOW: +12V 9A WHITE: -5V 0.5A BLUE: -12V 0.5A ORANGE: +3.3V 15A PURPLE: +5VSB 1A BLACK: GND GRAY: POWER GOOD +3.3V & +5V 115W MAX </s>
<s> If you use a generic system or plain build using a generic power supply based on the ATX12V model, you can use any wattage. </s>
<s> The higher the better as it uses &quot;what it needs&quot;. </s>
<s> Make sure the p/s unit mentions its for Intel or and/or AMD rated for a better fit on your system. </s>
<s> Look should look at the physical size of things, but usually your basic replacement is very swappable, though a &quot;mini&quot; size is present. </s>
<s> Also, expect some extra cables to daggle as you may not use all of them. </s>
<s> Look here for some clues: http://www.sparklepower.com If you have a local shop, take in hand your old p/s and then ask for a replacement, even if it costs more, its a done deal. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if you have a OEM or big vendor build system like Dell, Gateway, etc., make sure any replacament is rated for its use and/or model installation, but a higher wattage is still installable. </s>
<s> Here sizing, wiring and/or special connects will come into play, so verify that. </s>

<s> There is someexcellent infor at Tom's hardware guide specifically an article: Inadequate and Deceptive Product Labeling: Comparison of 21 Power Supplies Created: October 21, 2002 </s>
<s> You supplied a lot of info about the PSU, But you didn't say the make of the PC or the PSU type AT or ATX. </s>
<s> Yes, if you have a DELL they use a modified ATX PSU. </s>

<s> sorry guys, i didnt know i needed to supply that info. </s>
<s> my cpu is a built system from a little local company, not a big vendor system. </s>
<s> its pentium 3. </s>
<s> I was going to go with a 300 watt pu from sparkle, i think. </s>
<s> In many cases 300W p/s maybe enough if only the it is a decently made one. </s>
<s> These cheap units you see now just don't cut it. </s>
<s> Understand also, that the wattage rating is for the &quot;peak output&quot; it can support but not on a *CONSTANT level*, so buy a larger p/s unit you can afford. </s>
<s> I should have mentioned 350W is a good start, but 400W is better, if you buy cheap then get the highest wattage you can find. </s>
<s> It wouldn't hurt your system to have extra wattage, it's just &quot;available on demand&quot;. </s>
<s> Try http://www.newegg.com or http://www.geeks.com for a good source of p/s units and selection. </s>
<s> You'll see the varying price range. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
