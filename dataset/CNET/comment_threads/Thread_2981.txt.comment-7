ok, so you've got this huge log file, now what?
you need something specific to search for in the file.
for me it was a key that kept changing on it's own (apparently).
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WheelScrollLines was my problem.
i'd set it in regedit, then reboot and it wouldn't be the value that i had just set it to before the reboot.
if this is your problem, the search that log file for HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WheelScrollLines.
you might even try just WheelScrollLines, as there shouldn't be too many registry keys with that name.
best of luck.
dog.
