11952	0	285026	2711236	NR	Flavaflex	2/22/08 4:41 AM	1.20365526E12	Need Help!!!...	Ok I am a novice when it comes to computers so i need some advice on building my first pc. So Let me get straight to nitty..... I decided to build a pc because i was told (and i heard) that it would be cheaper than buying a Mac (the industry type). I want to build a computer which will be great for multitasking in graphic design, Music Production, Music Recording, Mixing, Editing and Etc. (I wont be playing any games on it). Now the question at hand is, which Intel or Amd Processor is the best Price to performance ratio for this kind of make? As for a budget...not more than $2000. And Secondly Can anyone recommend a case and a motherboard to go along with that specific processor?

So thats why i want to continue sticking to the pc. As for the applications, i'll be using, protools, reason, fruity loops, Photoshop cs2, illustrator, corel, and etc. The cases you guys shown me i wasnt thinking along that line of cases. more like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811133056 I thought maybe seeing that i am going to be using more than one hard drive (4 or more), couple adio cards, and couple drives... why not get one with a air vent or couple fans. Now with that type of case in mind, and the intel quad core 6600 or 6700.. which one of those proccessors whould be the best match for the above applications?

11952	7	285026	2713839	2713360	ramarc	2/24/08 3:17 PM	1.20386622E12	quad cores only faster in some software	photoshop is optimized for quad cores, but other apps (like illustrator) don't show much benefit going from 2 to 4 cores because of thread synchronization issues. that's also especially true of most music software. they optimize for 2 threads but not 4. so a fast dual core (3ghz e8400) will outperform a slower quad core (2.4ghz q6600/2.66ghz q6700) in all of your apps except photoshop.
