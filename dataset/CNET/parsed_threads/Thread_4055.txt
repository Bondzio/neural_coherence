<s> I have the belkin 802.11g wireless router downstairs and want to set up my xbox live upstairs in my room. </s>
<s> Would the best way to do this be to use a wireless bridge? </s>
<s> Would it have to be a Belkin? </s>
<s> I heard that I can use another router as a bridge. </s>
<s> Let me know. </s>
<s> I am new to all of this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> You can mix brands as long as you have the same letter as i say like. </s>
<s> if you have a b/g router by D link. </s>
<s> You can get a b/g Wireless pc card from netgear and they work together. </s>
<s> As for the router as a bridge i dont know if that will work i would get some thing like this... http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&pid=241 i think that sould work. </s>
<s> Just check to see if its Xbox Live rated make sure ur wireless router is too. </s>
