Recently purchased new LCD flat panel and needed digital connection so purchased new graphics card - NVidia MX4400 by Asus.
Installed card fine, no problems.
In last two weeks have had crashes.
First one said drivers bad for card and not acceptable to windows, so went to NVidia site and installed new drivers, had problems but finally got all working again.
Crashed again tonight with following windows error &quot;STOP 0X000000EA THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVISE_DRIVER (Q293078).
Finally got computer back up after three false starts of quitting in mid load and shutting down by itself.
Choose go to last known good settings and finally got back up again.
Do I have a defective card?
