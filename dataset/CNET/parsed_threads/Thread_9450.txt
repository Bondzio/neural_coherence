<s> hi here is my current setup. </s>
<s> Motherboard Gigabyte 990fxa-d3 CPU AMD Phenom x6 1045t Graphics HIS Radeon HD 6790 x2 in crossfirex RAM 16gb Gskill cheap value ram. </s>
<s> PSU Coolermaster 550w OS Win 7 Ultimate So i baught a new motherboard the other day along with another 6790 at a really good price. </s>
<s> and for the last couple of days all sorts of strange things are happening. </s>
<s> Sometimes the computer will freeze while windows is loading, at times the keyboard will turn off, when i put my computer to sleep it will take itself out of sleep straight away and other times it will just not turn back on at all. </s>
<s> and to top it off i turned it on earlier today and it wouldnt even post. </s>
<s> So only after taking one graphics card and all but one ram stick it decides to work again. </s>
<s> im really confused on what it could be. </s>
<s> I was thinking it may be the PSU but it is reasonably new and it seems to work again after re inserting the extra RAM and PSU. </s>
<s> can anyone please shed some light on what they think the problem could be. </s>
<s> http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/amd-radeon-hd-6000/hd-6790/pages/amd-radeon-hd-6790-overview.aspx#2 says you need 600 watts if you now have two display cards. </s>
<s> There's also amperes to measure. </s>
<s> I'd also wonder if you overclock. </s>
<s> If so, run it stock and see what happens...but after you correct the PSU issue. </s>
<s> Who sets it up and fixes this one? </s>
<s> I wonder if there is something basically wrong with the machine. </s>
<s> That is, all nice parts but I could not figure out if said Windows was a fresh install or some TRANSPLANT. </s>
<s> Transplants usually go horribly wrong. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> My thought on the power supply is, seems small. </s>
<s> Hope it's a single rail model. </s>
<s> yeah i bult the system myself. </s>
<s> i was thinking the same thing although the sysytem seems to be running smoothly over the past couple of days. </s>
<s> all i have been really doing is basic websurfing and watching movies which doesnt really put much load on the PSU. </s>
<s> I might add that it is not overclocked at all. </s>
<s> everything is running on factory settings. </s>
<s> Windows was a fresh install. </s>
<s> so the problem doesnt lie there. </s>
<s> I think Stephen is right about the PSU. </s>
<s> so i guess ill just get a new one and then put it through its paces and see how i go. </s>
<s> I was thinking of a 750w Antec-Earth they are supose to be real good on power consumption. </s>
<s> When you installed the drivers, let's hope you installed the right variety for the Win7 you did install as 32 or 64-bit type. </s>
<s> While some 32-bit maybe accepted or seem so, these in turn cause issues when they're pushed or possibility the drivers aren't too keen as really ready. </s>
<s> So review all that, don't fall what was available on the OS install alone, the drivers for the mtrbd. </s>
<s> maybe lacking for your needs, so a visit to the mtrbd. </s>
<s> website for what you need. </s>
<s> also, in some cases if you're dragging some old part into the mix, install the drivers from windows driver website, when prompted allow it to install from the WWW. </s>
<s> That one area I would check into as it maybe part of the overall siuues besides aPSU one tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have just joined CNET trying to get some clarity on similar weird things happening to now 6 computers bought new all set up and two second hand. </s>
<s> My technical understanding is very limited. </s>
<s> I have given up on getting techs help though. </s>
<s> They usually can't understand what is happening with my gear, and my internet connections, and online services. </s>
<s> For example computers often wont start, pressing the button does nothing. </s>
<s> I took one to a tech and he handed it back a few days later said there was nothing wrong with it, started straight away for him. </s>
<s> He checked it thoroughly and could find nothing wrong and it kept starting for me after that, but other things then happened to that one. </s>
<s> Three others have done the same not starting thing, two intermittently. </s>
<s> There may be a simple explanation for your problems, but my conclusion with mine is that the computers are being sabotaged remotely. </s>
<s> I could give many more examples and reasons I have come to this conclusion and also the conclusion that some protection against EM beams and pulses is required. </s>
<s> I have had similar experiences with TVs and radios. </s>
<s> Only one such device has not had weird things happening with it and that is a small Sony radio and guess what it was specifically built by a public speaker who had such a protective device put in it as he was having problems of interference with its use providing translations to members of his audience. </s>
