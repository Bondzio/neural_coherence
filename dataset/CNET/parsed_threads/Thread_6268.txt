<s> I got an external hard disk WD scorpion blue 500 gb from a friend and it usually make a click sound and restart when i'm sending files on it or taking them out of it and i get Windows Delayed Write Failed can anyone help me with this ? </s>
<s> I've had this happen with a Seagate external and had to figure out how to keep from going to power save mode by shutting down the motor. </s>
<s> Thanks I tried to use NosleepHD v2.0 and i still got same problem, can you tell me what you did and if it worked for you ? </s>

<s> And for clarification what do you mean by spinning down ? </s>
<s> And call it in to ask for a warranty exchange. </s>

<s> Hopefully that there's a solution for this. </s>
<s> I can't ask for warranty exchange since as i said it isn't me that bought it but i got it from a friend. </s>
<s> If not, try starting over on the drive. </s>
<s> Delete the partition, create a new partition, format it using the quick method and when you have time, run some HDD test app on it. </s>

<s> It was a new drive that came with software and some autorun function to configure the drive. </s>
<s> I wanted no part of that so I wiped, repartitioned and formatted the drive. </s>
<s> After that I was experiencing symptoms similar to what you write. </s>
<s> I used google to research this and found that I needed something from that original software to prevent the timeout and spin down of the drive. </s>
<s> I went to the Seagate site and downloaded the latest offering for this drive type. </s>
<s> I had to install and run it. </s>
<s> I believe something embedded in the drive's hardware was preventing other methods from deactivating the power save function. </s>
<s> Anyway, while I cannot recall the exact steps used, I was able to accomplish what I wanted. </s>
<s> Once done, I uninstalled the software and the drive behaves as I wish. </s>
<s> By &quot;spinning down&quot;, I just mean it enters a power save mode by parking the heads and shutting down the motor. </s>
<s> It will restart the motor when called upon but the delay seems to make Windows unhappy. </s>
<s> Windows seems to want to periodically access all drives and perhaps grows impatient waiting for one to return to a ready state. </s>
<s> That's about all I can do to offer help. </s>
