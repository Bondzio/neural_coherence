i was looking at a hec x-power pro 650 650w continuous psu.
it costs only $55 off new egg and it seems perfect for a gaming rig i want to build.
i've read the reviews but came across no horror stories, yet.
has anyone had experience with this psu or others like it?
i'm on a tight budget and that's why it seems to perfect for me also, does anyone know of a device that will ensure that if my psu fails, the rest of my hardware will be ok?
