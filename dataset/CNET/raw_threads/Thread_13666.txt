I want to connect an ethernet device (not wireless but IP addressing fully configurable) to my laptop so that i can then see the device elsewhere in my office. Is this possible? I have been playing with IP addresses with no luck so far.

You can certainly connect an Ethernet cable to your NIC jack and to another device. To get them working together, they both need IP addresses which you will probably need to do statically.

However from other stations on my network it is not accessible. If I bridge(using XP) my wireless and local are connection (broadcom) then the device is pingable, but not accessible by my laptop or the broader network.

I would think it could be wirelessly bridged directly to the network. If your network's router has some addresses reserved for static assignment, I'd think you could configure it that way and create a link to it in your browser.

If i crack this we can implement the concept more broadly on our systems. Bridging seems like a route to take but when i do this it my wireless indicates it is connected, but is unable to connect(to the other network computers and the internet). Is this an ip addressing issue of the bridge that I have now created?

I'm not sure that bridging through your laptop can be easily done. Frankly, I've never tried that other than to create an AP from another PC. It would seem best to connect it directly to the whole network than require a dependency on another machine. Bridging to router should not be that hard. You need two capable devices and create an association between them. You can set up your DHCP server (generally your router) to provide some addresses dynamically but reserve a range for those that need fixed addresses. I'll be limited in what I can offer in the way of specifics as I've only done this (minimally) with printers as single devices. It works with these.
