<s> Hi, Since i updated my DIVX Codecs recently i have noticed when playing movies via Power DVD 5 that the Screen sticks for about a second and then carries on prefectly for a while and then does it again. </s>
<s> This happens 2 or 3 times through the whole movie (this is DVD format and other movie formats as well like WMV and Mpeg) When i play the same movie via my Windows Media player i never have this problem. </s>
<s> Any help why this happens and how i can fix this? </s>
<s> Your post contained notes about software. </s>
<s> What hardware issue is here? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll post it in the right forum, sorry </s>
