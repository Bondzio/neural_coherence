<s> I have a Linksys WRT54GS Router that connects from the internet. </s>
<s> Then I have a Gateway Desktop running Windows XP Pro and a Toshiba Laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium connected to the Linksys router. </s>
<s> I just recently bought the new Linksys router that I'm using now, before with my previous Linksys router I had no problems accessing the shared files on my desktop from my laptop, but now the only way I can access them is when my laptop is connected to the network wirelessly. </s>
<s> If I plug in the laptop directly to the router I can no longer access those files. </s>
<s> Keep in mind I'm fairly new to networking issues so you might have to hold my hand through this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Nevermind, I got it working. </s>
