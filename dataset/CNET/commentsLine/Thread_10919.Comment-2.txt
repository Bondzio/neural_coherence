by nothing you mean no power from the power supply, no fans spinning, no beeps from the internal speaker?
check the power supply voltage switch is set to the correct line voltage.
test the outlet the power cord is plugged into.
check the power switch header on the motherboard for the correct orientation of the connector to the switch.
to test the power switch on the box, remove the connector from the header and short the header pins with a small screwdriver.
if the case switch is bad this should start the machine.
