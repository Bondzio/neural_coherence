Where do I begin trouble-shooting this? TIA, John

But it works fine in another computer, and goes back to working fine in this one as well when I reboot. Like I said originally in the first post where I enumerated all sorts of strange problems, that's just one of many. No stuck keys. John

You said nothing about A/V security software, scans etc. Mr. Proffitt suggested a reload (Windows)..IMOP likely the easiest way out.
