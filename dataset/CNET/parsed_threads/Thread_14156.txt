<s> You STILL didn't mention your operating system, I am assuming it is an older system (since your hook ups are ps-2) and likely running perhaps Win Xp. </s>
<s> If it has the capability have you tried using USB KYBD/MOUSE? </s>
<s> This issue could also be created by a malware infection(s) there are several possibilities especially since it sounds as if you may be using this unit on a public network. </s>
<s> Since this keyboard does not work with the bios I would think you have a hardware problem. </s>
<s> Have you tried another keyboard? </s>
<s> Just for yuks. </s>
<s> Disconnect the mouse.....speakers...usb devices......so that all you have left is the keyboard and monitor. </s>
<s> I'm assuming this is a desktop. </s>
<s> Any difference when using the bios with the keyboard? </s>
