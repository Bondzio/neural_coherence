<s> I had 2x512 mb of RAM and I added a 1gb RAM bar...Windows is recognizing new memory, but I can't notice any improvement The new RAM is from the same manufacturer and only difference is between new and old are CL's what to do, people? </s>
<s> So what improvement from 1 to 2 would be even less. </s>
<s> I'm sure someone will write about dual channel operation but your post didn't tell any machine details to write about that. </s>
<s> Not even the OS. </s>
<s> Do you see those words in red when you post? </s>
<s> Windows XP professional SP2 motherboard MSI K8N Neo4 Athlon 64 3500+ ATI radeon x800xl 256mb 80gb SATA hard disk (dont know the manufacturer) The memory sticks are Super Talent 184-pin DDR DIMM Capacity: 1 GB Frequency: 400 MHz Data Rate: PC-3200 CL: 3 and 2x 512 mb 184-pin DDR DIMM Kapacitet: 512 MB Frekvencija: 400 MHz Data Rate: PC-3200 CL: 2.5 hopefully, this will help I also have some problems with one of the fans, it keeps on making noises...could this be the solution, a fixed fan? </s>
<s> If I got that wrong, please correct me. </s>
<s> But we are looking at where XP gives little payback past 512MB. </s>
<s> It would be marginally faster in this case. </s>
<s> Also the Athlon 64 3500+ socket 754 does not use the dual channel setup so we don't need to worry about that. </s>

<s> but socket 939 </s>
<s> Otherwise you lose the dual channel speed. </s>
<s> so I threw away 70$ just like that? </s>
<s> I see it as you got some benefit but don't expect anything huge here. </s>
<s> You are past the point where you get big payoff. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> away more money on another stick, consider upgrading mobo/CPU/memory combo to a dual core and DDR2. </s>
<s> If you live anywhere near a Fry's, they run combo deals every week that almost beats any DDR upgrades to single core systems. </s>
<s> recommended RAM combinations. </s>
<s> I wenth wit 2-1GB DIMMs (OCZ4002048ELDCPE-K) vs 4-512MB DIMMs and it worked well. </s>
