<s> Hi, My current system comprises of the following, of which I am looking to upgrade the motherboard: Processor: 6.00 AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Motherboard: ASUS M2A-VM1.XX Hard drive: Hitachi HDT 500Gig SATA 2 x 1G Ram NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT IEEE 1394 Firewire card I have 3 main uses for this PC, which are: 1. </s>
<s> Why would the motherboard be an issue here? </s>
<s> That is, isn't wiring something any skilled technician be able to handle and wouldn't have to find a motherboard with the exact pin for pin connections? </s>
<s> Hint: There is no standard for the onboard audio connections. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just assumed that because the motherboard in my pc does not have the pin for pin connectivity that I require that there would motherboards on the market that do. </s>

<s> are you 'planning' to reuse the CPU and the RAM or not. </s>
<s> If yes... is your MB a socket 939 and what RAM are you using DDR, DDR2 and what speed ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You will never find such a board besides the make or model you have now. </s>
<s> The internal connections for audio and a few others are not standardized so your skill at rewiring will come into play. </s>

<s> Yes I am planning to reuse the CPU & the RAM. </s>
<s> The MB is socket AM2 & the ram is unbranded DDR2 & the only other numbers on each stick is 667. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I can not find the invoice which lists the specific details of the pc's components. </s>
<s> Hope this is helpful. </s>

<s> As Bob said no need for new motherboard to add a capture or sound card. </s>
<s> For info on your mobo download Belarc Advisor http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html Find what free pci slots are available and buy the appropriate cards. </s>
<s> Choose a capture card that does not require a seperate audio connection, and problem solved. </s>
<s> My Compro Digital/Anolouge TV tuner capture card requires no connection to the sound card. </s>
<s> No doubt there others. </s>
<s> it's up-to-date. </s>
<s> here's the link for your motherboard (mobo): http://usa.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&l2=101&l3=496 your mobo uses standardized usb pinouts. </s>
<s> if your firewire card has an internal port, it will be standardized also. </s>
<s> your mobo has front-panel audio port (page 1-30) and an s/pdif port (page 1-28) with simple and fully documented pinouts. </s>
<s> if you're still having problems connecting your multifunction panel, you should replace it, and not the motherboard. </s>
<s> My apologies for not repling sooner, but I have been away this week. </s>
<s> Just like to say thanks to everyone for their replies. </s>
<s> I have taken on board all your comments and suggestions. </s>
<s> I can now plan what hardware I must have and find a way to achieving the connectivity that I require. </s>
<s> Regards Ian </s>
