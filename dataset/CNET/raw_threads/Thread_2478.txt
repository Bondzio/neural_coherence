Out of the box it should work even without a computer hookup. It prints from the computer perfectly. The fault occours when you try to make a color copy! The color in the copy is 50-60% of the original. This also happens when you scxan a color sheet. I called the company to get a fix and after hours on hold and then led through the manual for trouble shooting to no avail. SO they sent me a new one, three days great service except the new printer did or did not do the same thing! So back to the phone same thing . New printer, refurbished. 5 days Same thing So called HP CORP. CASE MANAGER SAYS IT MUST BE HARDWARE GETTING BUMPED New one 3 days same thing 50% color on copy or scan Does anyone have any ideas to help me solve this problem other than sending this back to HP and getting what money back i can. my wife likes the card slots and print choices.

Remember that color copiers do not make color accurate copies. I will not embark on the lessons about color copiers, color calibration (look up Pantone Spyders), paper and even why this is so. But expectations of a color accurate copy are usually dashed. Bob
