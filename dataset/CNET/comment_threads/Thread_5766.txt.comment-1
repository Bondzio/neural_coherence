I have a HP a6330f Desktop AMD Athlon 64 X 2 Dual Core 5600+ 2.8 GHz, 3.0 GB RAM, 32 Bit OS, Vista Home Prem Serv Pack 1, Verizon DSL for internet.
Randomly a little box pops up in the lower right side of the screen stating &quot;ANALOG&quot;, the the screen flashes on and off.
I try to reboot most of the time it continues to flash on and off but does reboot.
It does eventually stop but then starts up again at any random moment.
I have a NVIDIA GeoForce 6150SE nforce 430 video card.
I bought this system 1 yr ago Jan.
Does the Video card need replacing already?
