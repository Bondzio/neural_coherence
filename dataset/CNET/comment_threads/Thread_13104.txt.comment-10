I know that is is advertised as supporting duel band, but when I look at te specs for it vs. some other router (like the Linksys E3000) it says that the Netgear WNR 3700 only supports, &quot;IEEE 802.11n (draft 2)&quot;.
I'm just wondering if the WNR 3700, is old enough that it predates the 802.11n standard?
And maybe it has been superseded either by an updated version of the WNR 3700 which supports the standard, rather than a draft, or if there's a newer Netgear model to the WNR 3700 that supports the standard?
