<s> I have a Lacie d2 Quadra hard-drive that I've been using on a Mac computer for several years. </s>
<s> The Mac computer that the drive was connected to is pretty much dead (Held out for 8 years though!) </s>
<s> and I need to transfer the files from the hard drive to a PC computer. </s>
<s> I can plug the drive into a Mac and it just mounts on its own, but nothing happens when I plug it into a PC. </s>
<s> I read the manual and it says to format the drive as NTFS and it will appear in my Computer folder. </s>
<s> However, I am worried that formatting the drive will erase everything on it and I will loose all my data. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience with this? </s>
<s> I've formatting smaller things like flash drives etc and I know that always erases the data, so I'd rather be sure about this before I do something stupid and erase every song and media file I've ever owned... Any input would be great </s>
<s> Copy your stuff out before formatting. </s>
<s> And to share a little more, I found booting a LiveCD (no install!) </s>
<s> called UBUNTU (no learning linux!) </s>
<s> let me access such drives and copy content out. </s>

<s> Glad I asked! </s>
<s> So is there no way to use my drive on a Mac and PC without erasing everything? </s>
<s> My sister has a Mac and I have a PC (not for long hopefully...) </s>
<s> In my opinion, too unreliable. </s>
<s> Today's Apples can use NTFS. </s>
<s> So when you get your files safe, try NTFS next time. </s>
<s> Be safe! </s>
