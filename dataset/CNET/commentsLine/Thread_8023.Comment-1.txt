i am a dedicated mac user.
however, i am also a data analyst.
sometimes the programs i need to run analysis only comes in a windows version.
i deal with stats, data mining, a little sql type stuff.
i even need the windows excel due to add-ins, etc.
my data is rarely over 10gb.
most is far less than that.
here is my question- i am better off running a virtualization side on my mac (ie parellels) or to buy a windows desktop/server, load the windows programs into it and then remote desktop in from my mac.
thus i am running the analysis process on the windows machine.
upsides and downsides?
comments?
thanks
