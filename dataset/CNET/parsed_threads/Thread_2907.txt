<s> We just bought new computers equipped with the new Vista OS (home premium) and are trying to run a program over a network. </s>
<s> (One computer acts as a server, and three other computers are workstations.) </s>
<s> We've been able to map the drive to the server from the workstations. </s>
<s> However, we can't seem to execute a program because the program, according a pop-up dialogue box, &quot;cannot run via a UNC filename.&quot; The question: How do I map a drive from the workstation to the server without using a UNC filename. </s>
<s> I followed as close as possible the mapping procedures we used in Windows XP. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help you can offer. </s>
<s> - What program is this? </s>
<s> A Microsoft one or another? </s>
<s> - Can you run other programs this way or does the message apply to all programs? </s>
