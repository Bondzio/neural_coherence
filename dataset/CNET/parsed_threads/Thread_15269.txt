<s> I'm having a problem burning CDs for my Windows Vista computer. </s>
<s> Namely, the files do not show up in Vista. </s>
<s> Here's a breakdown... </s>
<s> I insert a blank CD-R into the DVD/CD writable drive on my Dell desktop computer. </s>
<s> I have XP on my desktop. </s>
<s> I format the blank CD-R and, using Windows Explorer, I drag files on to the CD. </s>
<s> Computer spends several minutes 'burning' the CD. </s>
<s> Before ejecting the CD, I right-click on it in Explorer and select &quot;Make Compatible.&quot; It spends a minute or so doing this and then ejects the CD. </s>
<s> I take the CD to my notebook computer, which has Vista on it. </s>
<s> I insert it and a Windows box pops-up which shows the CD, but says that there are no files on it. </s>
<s> I've taken the CD back to my desktop computer and opened it on both of my CD drives with no problem. </s>
<s> The files are visible and they open just fine with no errors. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I decline to write why but share that if you didn't bother with the format, drag, make compatible and used most CD recording software such as CDBURNERXP it would work fine. </s>
<s> Your method is known to fail. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So what would you recommend, then? </s>
<s> I supplied a solution and suggestion in my first reply. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> While you've explained that my process is &quot;known to fail,&quot; you did not provide an alternative solution. </s>
<s> What step(s) of my process are contributing to the issues I'm experience? </s>
<s> So I ask again... What do you (or anyone else reading this thread) recommend? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I noted the software and method in my reply. </s>
<s> I don't offer step by step replies. </s>
<s> Those are for our newbies forum. </s>
<s> Sorry but if you didn't catch my fix in my first reply it would be unlikely you would find it in further replies. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Whatever. </s>
<s> Save the snide remarks for someone who cares. </s>
<s> I'll seek assistance elsewhere. </s>
<s> &quot;CD recording software such as CDBURNERXP it would work fine.&quot; Sorry you feel slighted. </s>
<s> But in my first reply is the software (free even) that could get this job done. </s>
<s> Again, I feel if you don't read the replies what good will it do to repeat the answer? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for finally offering some clarification. </s>
<s> That wasn't so hard, was it? </s>
<s> And no... this was not an issue of me not reading your reply. </s>
<s> If you look at the way you phrased your initial response (grammatical errors aside), perhaps you could understand why ANYONE would have difficulty following. </s>
<s> I'll try the solution you've suggested and report back w/results. </s>
