<s> Hi guys, At first, I'm new to this forum so excuse me if I put this discussion in the wrong area First the story: I bought a Netgear WN3000RP Extender for better wifi range, because on my room upstairs I have no signal at all (so called dead spots) So, I installed it a few months ago and all was working fine, untill we had to leave the house for vancation. </s>
<s> Someone in the house pulled the extender out of the electric outlet. </s>
<s> A few weeks later we pulled it back in it, but here started the problem: I installed the extender again, but now without any succes. </s>
<s> (Just incase you want take a look: http://www.netgear.nl/home/products/wireless-range-extenders/WN3000RP.aspx# ) There are 4 LED lights attached to this extender. </s>
<s> 3 of them are lighting, but the 4th won't light at all. </s>
<s> LED's: http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/knelly74/2012-01-27_181403_reset.png I did the exact same procedures as exampled in the installation manual, but nothing worked. </s>
<s> I always got this error on the end of the unsuccesful installation: Move the extender closer to the existing router or gateway. </s>
<s> Im really sure the extender is in the range of my actual router! </s>
<s> I've tried everything from restoring to factory defaults to WPS, DPS, disabling security, Nothing works.. </s>
<s> I always get stuck on the error. </s>
<s> (With WPS I press both the buttons on the extender and the router, but they cant find each other.) </s>
<s> I hope someone can help me. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I read all this and bottom line this didn't work and as such you pack it up and return it. </s>
<s> Since it worked at one time, it's possible the replacement will work. </s>

<s> So you mean return the extender and get a new one? </s>
<s> I always hate these boxes that say just push a button and it works. </s>
<s> If you can't make it work using WPS then you do it the old school way and configure it with ethernet cable like any other extender. </s>
<s> If it still does not work then you need to consider it is broken. </s>
<s> It could be as simple as WPS is disabled on your router..... </s>
<s> Note it is strongly recommended you leave WPS disabled and only enable for a tiny period of time when you need it. </s>
<s> There is a fundamental design flaw that allows a hacker to get access to any router with this enabled. </s>
<s> It's possible someone forgot to turn WPS on again. </s>
<s> But given the story, it seems this unit has indeed failed. </s>
<s> As there is no user diagnostics to be found and testing such as a shop is cost prohibitive then you hope it's under warranty. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> turn the router security off and then follow the set up for the extender </s>
