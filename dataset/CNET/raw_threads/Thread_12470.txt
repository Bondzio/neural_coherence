Today, I downloaded Avast, but after doing so, remembered why I hated it before. I also had downloaded Firefox, but couldn't get the favorites to import from IE. Then things started freezing up. So, I had a bright idea: Do a system restore to yesterday, thus getting rid of the two programs. OMG, what a mess! When the cptr started up, first told me the Avast couldn't be installed. I thought, right, since it is no longer officially there. So, I did a search and sent the file to the recycle bin. Then I ran my registry repair scan, which picked up five errors and I clicked the little &quot;fix&quot; button. Then I tried to open Outlook and get the following message: extension failed to initialize. Can't open file: extend.dat File may not exist, you may not have permission to open it, or it may be open in another program. Right-click the folder that contains the file, and then click properties to check your permission for the folder. Had to do another search for the extend.dat file. Found THREE &quot;extend&quot; files, but none with the &quot;.dat&quot; tacked onto the end. However, right-clicking did show it was a data file. There was no &quot;permission&quot; thing when right-clicking - and I'm the only user of this computer. However, when I moved it to &quot;Outlook&quot; (copy #3), it still didn't fix my error message. The result in Outlook, as far as I can tell, is that I cannot initialize send/receive by hitting that on the toolbar or through using F9. I have been able to create new messages and the send/receive works then. I can also receive messages through the normally scheduled send/receive times. Argh! What should I do? katiebug

It will only restore system settings and system files necessary for XP to work properly. This is a very common mistake so don't feel bad. and life goes on... Jack

9333	5	155662	1732684	1732255	katiebug57	2/9/06 5:01 PM	1.13950446E12	Yeah, and one more thing	What I found out was that deleting the AV program (sending it to trash) without deleting it from the system from the control panel was that it took a .dat file with it. What I ended up doing was reinstalling the AV program, then deleting it properly through the control panel. When I reinstalled it, it gave me back the file I needed for Outlook to work right. Crazy thing. But, I sweat a few bullets until I figured out what to do. After that was done, I went back and recleaned the registry. Thanks all! Katiebug
