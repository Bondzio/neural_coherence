yep, pulled the cpu and checked to be absolutely sure it was in correctly which with the guides is sort of hard to miss.
i've tried it with no memory, 1 stick, 2 stick.
i've tried it with cpu fan unplugged just to see if it would give a beep error since many mobos do now for that.
seems controller chips work on the mobo, but nothing from bios is, like the bios is dead.
i sent in another rma request with mention of the earlier filing for one.
