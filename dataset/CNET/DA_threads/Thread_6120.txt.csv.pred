1.1.1	A bizarre situation that I just do n't understand - help really appreciated .	St
1.1.2	I 'm running a home wireless network : cable modem to Dell Truemobile 2300 router .	St
1.1.3	I have a Mac wired to the router , and until last week 1 Dell desktop and another Dell laptop - both running XP - connected via wireless .	St
1.1.4	No problems - everything running fine .	St
1.1.5	Last week we moved the Dell desktop to another room ( closer to the router as it happens ) but managed to damage the ( Belkin G+ ) PCI wireless card in the process .	St
1.1.6	I have replaced the PCI card with the exact same model ( another Belkin G+ ) but now I ca n't connect to the router .	St
1.1.7	The best I am getting is & quot ; limited Network & quot ; connectivity I am trying to bypass the Belkin wireless utility and get Windows to manage the connectivity , but can not get the & quot ; Wireless Zero Configuration & quot ; service to remain & quot ; started & quot ; ( it stops every time I reboot ) or indeed the option & quot ; Use Windows to manage my network connection & quot ; selected in the Windows Network Connection properties .	St
1.1.8	Belkin tech support are advising me to change the SSID & channel settings on the router , and that this will & quot ; refresh & quot ; the connection and & quot ; definitely & quot ; get the problem fixed .	St
1.1.9	The first problem I have is that the configuration utility is on the ddesktop that now ca n't connect to the router ! !	St
1.1.10	Beyond that I just do n't understand 1/ why resetting the SSID & channel would fix this without potentially screwing up the ( perfect ) wireless connectivity with the laptop 2/ why I need to do this at all - ALL that has changed from the previous scenario is the actual PCI card in the desktop ( but have swapped for EXACTLY the same type ) and the physical location of the desktop .	St
1.1.11	The laptop gets excellent reception in exactly the same spot .	St
1.1.12	My main question is : should I trust the Belkin advice ( reset the router SSID / channel - bearing in mind this means I have to try and install the config software on the laptop ... for which I do n't actually have a CD drive ... and I 'm concerned about creating further network problems ... . ) or is there anything else I should try within Windows beforehand ?	Ques
1.1.13	And if anyone could explain WHY this is happening I 'd also be eternally grateful ! !	St
1.1.14	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	I think they gave great advice .	Polite
1.2.2	I have ZERO ISSUE with reseting wifi routers and starting over .	St
1.2.3	I decline to discuss why such fails .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob Forgive me if I misunderstand you but I am totally taken aback at a reply like this from a moderator .	St
1.3.2	This is a support forum .	St
1.3.3	I 'm a non-tecchie looking for some expert help .	St
1.3.4	What 's the point in posting to inform me that you decline to discuss the problem I 'm having because it 's never been an issue for you ? !	St
1.3.5	If you do n't want to give people like me advice what on earth are you doing moderating a support forum ? !	Ques
1.3.6	Here 's a great reply I got on www.hothardware.com - this may help you understand what forum users like me are looking for .	St
1.3.7	Be advised that you must be wired to the router to change any settings .	St
1.3.8	DO NOT attempt to change router settings wirelessly !	St
1.3.9	Any of your computers should be able to access the router while they are wired to it using the correct IP address typed into your web browser .	St
1.3.10	I believe the IP address for the Truemobile 2300 router is http : //192.168.2.1 and the default USER NAME and PASSWORD is admin .	St
1.3.11	I would not change any settings in the router at this point since both your wireless laptop and wired MAC still have internet connectivity .	St
1.3.12	It has been my own personal experience that a wireless connection that connects with a message of limited or no network connectivity indicates a problem with the security .	St
1.3.13	Try deleting your Dell desktop 's connection to your network ( and any other networks in the vicinity ) , and then reconnect to your network .	St
1.3.14	When you attempt to reconnect it will ask you to type-in your security key .	St
1.3.15	If you have forgotten your security key , or just need to verify it , you will need to access your router 's settings as I previously described ... & quot ; I have now fixed my issue , in part thanks to this feedback .	St
1.3.16	I now look forward to this thread being deleted or locked .	St
1.3.17	Thanks for all your help	St
