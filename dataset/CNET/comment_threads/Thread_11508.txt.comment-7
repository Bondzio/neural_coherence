My experiences was just the opposite of yours.
I went though 3 Linksys wireless N routers in two weeks and had to reset them every couple days to keep them working.
Took those back and picked up the Netgear WNDR3700 router, hooked it up and never looked back.
Best router I have owned.
There are lemons in about everything you buy now, you just have to be lucky and not get one of them and be forced to call their tech support.
