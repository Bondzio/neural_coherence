<s> I have a problem with my emachines T5026. </s>
<s> From the day that I buy it, sometimes it shut down itself without previous warning or just because it want to. </s>
<s> For instance, today I was listening to music and in the internet when suddenly it shut down and reboot, and after reboot no window with a warning or to send a feed back to microsoft appeared. </s>
<s> Yesterday happen too, I was downloading a program when the computer shut down. </s>
<s> This happens to me with my other emachine but in the other computer it was a problem of overheat because of the fan, but now I touch the fan in the back and they are working also there is no smel of like something on fire that happen to me with the other computer. </s>
<s> Please somebody help me with a solution or some good software that can tell me what is happening in my computer. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> contact emachine. </s>
<s> if its under warranty, send it in konny </s>
<s> Sagouts? </s>
<s> When the eMachine came out with this and other models it was documented that there was a power supply issue that caused this kind of problem... </s>
<s> If your machine is not covered by warranty then you will have to buy a replacement ... should only cost between $30 and $50. </s>
<s> I just replaced a friends eMachine power supply for the same reason. </s>
<s> Thank You jackintucson, I will try changing the power supply. </s>
<s> I hope is only that, because if not I don't know what I'm going to do. </s>
<s> If you see this I'm trying you help you (DO NOT BUY ANY eMACHINE PC), they are junk! </s>
<s> There junk right out of the box I have never had more problems with a computer and its service if you have one or just got one take it and get your money back. </s>
<s> I've had it for three months now and have not been able to use it yet I have a small home business and thought getting a faster pc would help but buying this pace of sh_t was a bad idea. </s>
<s> And the customer service is a joke (No idea what there talking about). </s>
<s> Like others my PC just reboots at any given time and customer service has no clue. </s>
<s> Ive tried reinstalling, replacing the power supply and noting works. </s>
<s> They try to sell me the extended service pack but why buy that when the thing isnt working now? </s>
<s> I will do all I can to tell every one I can not to buy an Emachine. </s>
<s> yeah i wouldn't expect anything, but if you get their $599 and up comps, users don't usually encounter problems. </s>
<s> Stuff like that happens when you either get a virus, trojan, or in some cases spyware. </s>
<s> Do you have: A Anti-Virus program? </s>
<s> A Firewall? </s>
<s> Spyware programs like both: AdAware and Spybot and MS Anti-Spyware All above can be obtained FREE. </s>
<s> PS...hope you are not listening to music from some of those p2p sites that can cause that kind of problem. </s>
<s> I don't think that's the problem because I am using: Antivirus: McAfee VirusScan Professional 9.0 McAfee Personal Firewall Spyware: Ad-Aware Professional 1.6 SpySweeper 4.0 CounterSpy MS AntiSpyware Also I'am up-to-date with Microsoft Updates on Windows Update site. </s>
<s> Definitively is a problem of the computer, but it was the more expensive and the best of eMachines computer's serie at that time, because now I know that there are some new models with AMD processors. </s>
<s> suggest sending it back to emachines cuz it has 1 year warranty thing. </s>
<s> Send it back! </s>
<s> HAHAHAH Been there done that, the Tech. </s>
<s> service there is a joke. </s>
<s> I'm glad yours is working ok; I just hope nothing goes wrong with it. </s>
<s> AAAAgggggggttttt, Wrong, I have tried all of that, uninstalled all that junk, and reboot and reboot and reinstall. </s>
<s> Ive done every thing that the tech service told me to do. </s>
<s> The T5026 is junk. </s>
<s> If you luked out and got a good one, good for you. </s>
<s> But next time I will send the extra 3 or 4 hundred dollars and get something good. </s>
<s> Yeah, I guess I had to find that out the hard way. </s>
<s> (I'll know better next time). </s>
<s> Emachines have been producing pretty good computers in the last couple years with no more maintenance, problems, or lemons than any other computer factory % wise. </s>
<s> You have posted just 4 times since coming to CNet apparently just to rage/rant against Emachine. </s>
<s> What kind of computer do you now have, and why don't you put the stats in your 'profile' (click on your name). </s>
<s> My wife has had a emachine for the past 3 years without a hint of trouble. </s>
<s> Nice for you and your wife. </s>
<s> The E junk that I have now is not a three year old out of date PC it's suppose to be one of the best that they have and it didn't work right in the three months since I got it. </s>
<s> I don't know what your WIFE dues with HER computer, but I need one that works. </s>
<s> Yeah I got a lemon thats not the point. </s>
<s> The Point is that they will not stand behind there product. </s>
<s> What good is a PC that you cant do any thing with? </s>
<s> You tell me that? </s>
<s> You didn't have any problems with your PC so I don't think your qualified you say any thing. </s>
<s> Now when is time for you to buy your WIFE a new PC, You just go right on and buy another E junk and I hope it works for you, But if you luck out like a lot of other people Ive talked to, good luck trying to get it fixed. </s>
<s> This entire problem would be fixed if you just asked emachines for a new psu. </s>
<s> Either a direct replacement, or the better 350watt psu that costs $50. </s>
<s> Not sure, but believe that any psu would fit in that emachines (motherboard-wise), but not exactly case. </s>
<s> will not be replaced with another emachine as she will get one of my other two (non-emachine) desktops when and if her current emachine starts to malfunction causing some $'s. </s>
<s> She uses her ($450) emachine every day for web surfing, printing, producing photo's with a scanner, and has even made CD's with it. </s>
<s> She also plays her type games on it, but will use my more powerful desktop for later high end games. </s>
<s> I am able to fix just about anything that may go wrong with my computers. </s>
<s> Have noticed through the years that the root of the majority of computer problems started with the operator. </s>
<s> Sorry to hear about your problems. </s>
