And through no fault of your own.
If you are using anything less than WPA security then I see many rogue users (see SMAC and other tools like it) can hijack what an admin may think was a reserved IP.
After the IT staff gets a little more seasoned they return to DHCP and WPA to avoid all the lost hours.
