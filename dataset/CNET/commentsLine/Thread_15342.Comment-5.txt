my &quot;computer&quot; room is at one end of the house and the dsl and router is there.
to get good coverage at the other end i put an access point on the other end of the house on a closet shelf with an ethernet cable from router to access point.
now i have great coverage everywhere.
this is just older 802.11g with different wireless channels on the router and separate access point.
