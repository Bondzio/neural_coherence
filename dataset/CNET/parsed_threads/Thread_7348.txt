<s> Hey, I'm doing some light upgrading. </s>
<s> Do you guys know which one of these is better? </s>
<s> (Kingston SSDNow V+200 or A-Data S510) Both are 60GB. </s>
<s> I will be plugging them into my Gigabyte 990FXA UD3. </s>
<s> Since you only asked which is better that could mean by price or small file performance, big file performance, small or big file read write times or something else entirely. </s>
<s> I suggest you find some storage site review and maybe it's just the price. </s>
<s> HOWEVER if this is on an older than Windows 7 OS I'd not do this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a Kingston V+200 240 gig SSd on a Windows 7 computer and it is crazy fast and stable. </s>
<s> A friend tried that same model SSD on a Windows Vista machine and it was a total disaster, nothing but trouble. </s>
<s> He did a clean install of Windows 7 on that same computer, reinstalled the SSD and cloned the harddrive to the SSD and it works great. </s>
