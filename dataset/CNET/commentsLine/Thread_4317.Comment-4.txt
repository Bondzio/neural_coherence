if you are not aware what ide is or will know to look in the bios settings, then i will not be able to help you.
you need some basic knowledge and take no offense that this small space can't tell you all that you need to know.
however, the place that sold you these goods should be called and they should, as part of the sale support you installing the items.
you are not dumb, just have not been into what a pc is made of and have dived into the shallow end of the pool and are a little dazed over all that one may need to know to build or upgrade their pc.
here's a thought.
maybe you should return the serial ata cards and drives and get good old ide drives since nothing heroic is needed to make it work.
