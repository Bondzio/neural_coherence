1.1.1	I installed a Brother MFC 420CN successfully on my Netgear wireless router that both my iBook and Windows ME PC can see .	St
1.1.2	But after installation , a Brother HL-1435 laser printer and an HP Photoprinter 1100+ & quot ; stopped & quot ; according to Printer setup utility in OS X Panther .	St
1.1.3	I tried reinstalling the Brother laser driver but the iBook does n't see it under USB in Printer setup utility .	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions would be appreciated !	St
1.1.5	( iBook G4 running OS X 10.3.9 , Netgear wireless G router , Brother MFC 420CN networked printer , local Brother HL-1435 laser printer and HP Photopriner 1100+ using USB )	St
1.2.1	when the print queue is & quot ; stopped & quot ; all that needs to be done is to & quot ; start & quot ; it again .	St
1.2.2	On the menubar or the icon bar of the printer window .	St
1.2.3	Occasionally , you will find a document that the printer just gives up on .	St
1.2.4	At that point it stops the queue .	St
1.2.5	Deleting the offending document and restarting the queue usually works .	St
1.2.6	This is probably not the problem in your case .	St
1.2.7	P	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.3.2	Both local USB printers show & quot ; stopped & quot ; even though I was only trying to print to one when this started .	St
1.3.3	Restarting the document just seemed to put it back in the queue but it would eventually stop as before .	St
1.3.4	( Also tried restarting computer . )	St
1.3.5	Deleting both printers and trying to reinstall one does n't work , as Printer Setup Utility no longer sees ANY USB drivers .	St
1.4.1	Interesting .	St
1.4.2	Even after running the installer for a printer , it no longer sees that printer ?	Ques
1.4.3	Do a search for ALL files that contain the name of the offending printer , even a partial name , and delete everything found .	St
1.4.4	Reinstall .	St
1.4.5	You say that after & quot ; starting & quot ; again , the document just goes back in the queue and the queue stops .	St
1.4.6	Did you try deleting the document and starting with a an empty print spooler ?	Ques
1.4.7	P	St
1.5.1	I tried every combination of deleting document and deleting printer and reinstalling driver , restarting print document .	St
1.5.2	What 's most interesting is that not one , but TWO local USB printers were & quot ; stopped & quot ; after installation of network printer .	St
1.5.3	No document was being printed to one of those USB printers , only the laser .	St
1.5.4	Yet Printer Setup Utility shows both & quot ; stopped. & quot ; Are you suggesting I search for files with names of either USB printer and delete them ?	Ques
1.6.1	That & quot ; should & quot ; ensure that a fresh installation will actually put the drivers onto the disk instead of just checking to see if the drivers have the same date .	St
1.6.2	Worth a try It is curious that both USB printers should stop though P	St
