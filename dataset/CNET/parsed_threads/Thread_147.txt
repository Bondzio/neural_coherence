<s> I don't understand the first sentence of your message. </s>
<s> (NT) Remark out turbovcd. </s>
<s> Further explaination would be helpfull. </s>
<s> Don't want to do a major screw up. </s>
<s> Thanks for the response </s>
<s> You've used this old OS for years so I offered the simplest steps. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Boot SAFE MODE. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Run MSCONFIG. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Uncheck the turbovcd. </s>
<s> Try again. </s>
<s> If MSCONFIG doesn't offer it, then find the .VXD in the C:\windows\system.ini and insert the semicolon in the line that notes turbovcd. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> OK. did what you suggested. </s>
<s> With CDRW drive connected, system locked up at prompt prior to the one I removed. </s>
<s> msmouse.vxd (locked up) with turbovcd.vxd unchecked. </s>
<s> Previously would lock up at turbovcd.vxd which comes directly after the msmouse.vxd. </s>
<s> I rebooted with the CDRW unhooked and without fixing the turbovcd.vxd, system booted correctly. </s>
<s> Just following the msmouse.vxd is the windows screen. </s>
<s> I would assume the CDRW problem conflicts with the opening of windows. </s>
<s> I'm not sure where to look from here as the step by step mode ends and the system boots. </s>
<s> Your thoughts would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I would uninstall everything associated with the CDRW and start over. </s>
<s> That means the hardware in Manager and software, first from the Programs list, then Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel. </s>
<s> Even check My Computer-Find. </s>
<s> Then reboot. </s>
<s> I found I have less problems installing hardware if I leave the OS disc in a drive(in case it needs a file)till it installs successfully. </s>
<s> But thats just me. </s>
<s> DO NOT put the deck software in till Windows installs the basic CD drive on first boot. </s>
<s> Till it does that, you got nothing. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> http://computercops.biz/postp90589.html also notes what turbovcd is as well as what other turbomodem drivers might be at play. </s>
<s> My &quot;guess&quot; is the motherboard drivers are out of date or never installed. </s>
<s> I don't remember you posting the make/model of machine or motherboard so I have to wait for more information before I can comment further. </s>
<s> The forum tip does ask for such so you can get speedy resolutions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The system at this point doesn't see the CDRW drive. </s>
<s> If I try and start the system with only the CDRW drive installed (I have removed the DVD drive and have cleared the Device Manager of the DVD drive) the system will lockup at the above mentioned location. </s>
<s> This is consistant. </s>
<s> I haven't tryed the other things you have suggested and will do this later this evening. </s>
<s> I have been at this on and off for about three months. </s>
<s> I have tryed two different drive manufacturers and have replaced the existing drive three times. </s>
<s> IDE cable as well. </s>
<s> Tryed the drive and combinations with DVD drive in all comfigurations. </s>
<s> (locked up when ever CDRW was installed) Even tested the CDRW drive in a different computer. </s>
<s> It worked. </s>
<s> The drive is an IOMagic 52x24x52 internal CD-RW. </s>
<s> Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> The system is a Gateway Model obs g6-333c. </s>
<s> the motherboard is a Anigma Pentium II Motherboard w/ Integrated AGP/Audio/DVD (part number 4000274) Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> I re-read the first post and I indeed missed that info. </s>
<s> http://members.driverguide.com/driver/detail.php?driverid=154086 only listed a 2001 BIOS and some other drivers I would PASS UP. </s>
<s> I'd review your choice of cable and JUMPERS on the new CDRW drive since having it incorrect will cause a hang. </s>
<s> http://downloads.guru3d.com/download.php?id=17 however finds the INTEL .INF motherboard package that could be needed, but let us file that for later. </s>
<s> FOR NOW, just tell what the old drive jumper was and what the new drive jumper is. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The origional drive is a DVD. </s>
<s> This drive is hooked to the secondary IDE and is set to master. </s>
<s> The system works fine with only this drive connected. </s>
<s> (Origionally when I started this process, months ago, my Hard drive was hooked to the secondary IDE. </s>
<s> I switched it to the Primary.) </s>
<s> If I remove the DVD drive and install only the CDrw drive it locks the system. </s>
<s> Set as a Master on the secondary IDE. </s>
<s> I have tried installing both drives in all combinations of master or slave and I get the same results. </s>
<s> If both drives are connected and both are set to cable select the system will boot, but it only recognizes the DVD drvie in device manager. </s>
<s> I have tried the CDRW, installed alone, in both Slave and Master positions won't boot. </s>
<s> I also have tried two different IDE cables. </s>
<s> I started this process with a drive distributed by Mad Dog. </s>
<s> Two different drives from them. </s>
<s> This is the third IO magic drive I have had. </s>
<s> This drive also operated in a different computer. </s>
<s> I did have a computer tech come over and he upgraded the bios off the gateway web site. </s>
<s> I have talked to Gateway and am told this drive should work in my system. </s>
<s> IO magic says the problem has to be in my computer, however, they did exchange the drive. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to think I have a compatability issue. </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> I'd have to try it in another machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Boot with the working DVD or such drive. </s>
<s> Find your way to the device manager and change the IDE Secondary channel to PIO or DMA DISABLED. </s>
<s> Then shut down and try it again. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> Sorry I don't understand what you want me to try. </s>
<s> PIO or DMA Disable? </s>
<s> I find the line in device manager, but how do I disable? </s>
<s> YOur information would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I will try the drive again in another computer. </s>
<s> For your information I have an IDE cable and the CDRW drive calls for an EIDE cable. </s>
<s> Could this be the problem? </s>
<s> Thanks Again Petter </s>
<s> PIO is the same as DMA DISABLE or even DISABLE DMA. </s>
<s> The naming of whatever setting that doesn't use DMA changes with the OS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the update. </s>
<s> I have some work to do on testing the drive etc. </s>
<s> Will lwt you know what I find out. </s>
<s> Thanks Petter </s>
<s> I had the CR/RW drive checked. </s>
<s> It was detected in the computer stores system, but would burn a cd. </s>
<s> I'm sending the drive back again. </s>
<s> Could it be I need to go with a slower drive? </s>
<s> I'm not sure in the detection process how the drive is detected. </s>
<s> Maybe you could walk me through how the drive is detected. </s>
<s> Petter </s>
<s> Is far beyond what I'm willing to type into any web page. </s>
<s> Since all this and more is on MSDN (the Microsoft site), you can digest it there. </s>
<s> I'm unsure how such information will help you since what would you do with it? </s>
<s> Good CDRW drives work fine on 98 if the machine is not &quot;broken&quot; and if the machine has motherboard drivers if such are needed. </s>
<s> I've never had to dive much deeper than this. </s>
<s> But there are a few that can't accept that CDRW (or other) drives fail and spend months with &quot;it can't be the drive&quot;. </s>
<s> I've learned over the years to swap in a new drive earlier than later and to do simple tests such as trying to boot for said drives. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> Back to the very first post. </s>
<s> Something I just ran into. </s>
<s> New optical and hard drives are SUPPOSED to run as cable-select. </s>
<s> Not all do. </s>
<s> I had to change my new drives back to Master and Slave for them to work. </s>
<s> Second point, also ran into a different problem when I got my new DVDRW and it wasn't recognized. </s>
<s> It would only run as Master and DVDrom as slave, not the other way around like I wanted. </s>
<s> Gave away a perfectly good CDRW for the same reason, thinking it was bad. </s>
<s> Wanted the DVDRW anyway. </s>
<s> Experiment a little, it might help to figure out the problem. </s>
