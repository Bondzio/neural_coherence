I know those that promote or love it will disagree but due to built-in limitations on playing of certain content, which changed a while ago with WiDi 2.1. http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/intel-widi-2-1-adds-hdcp-and-blu-ray-streaming-2011056/ So that left all those early adopters with broke systems.
The result of all this is low sales and low interest over all.
To solve the HD wireless connection I use one of those wireless HDMI solutions.
Good luck on your search.
