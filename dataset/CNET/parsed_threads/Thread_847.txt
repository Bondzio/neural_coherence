<s> Hi, I am using an educational computer program called Kurzweil 3000. </s>
<s> This program has its own image file called a .kes file. </s>
<s> I am trying to print a .kes file from a HP Deskjet 990 Cxi printer but it won't print accurately. </s>
<s> What I get is a sheet of 9 dark alternating columns of 2 different widths. </s>
<s> I am using a Windows XP O.S. </s>
<s> I tried to print a .tiff file and got the same result. </s>
<s> The funny thing is that I can print text files and clip art from Word. </s>
<s> Any idea what's happening? </s>
<s> Thanks, Ruth </s>
<s> What's changed since then. </s>
<s> to print the .tiff file? </s>
<s> In other words: is only the Kurzweil program in error or are other programs also affected? </s>
<s> Did you install the latest driver for your printer? </s>
<s> What happens if you install a .pdf-printer (like cutepdf) and use it to make a .pdf-file? </s>
<s> How does that look on the screen? </s>
<s> How does it print? </s>
<s> Just experiments to narrow down the possible cause of this problem. </s>

<s> No,it never worked. </s>
<s> I'm puzzled why it's not working. </s>
<s> I can print these image files on other printers. </s>
<s> Why not this one??? </s>
<s> Ruth </s>
<s> I am only having problems printing with the Kurzweil program. </s>
<s> I did install the latest driver but will try your pdf suggestion and get back to you. </s>
<s> thx, ruth </s>
