That the FCC limits power emissions in any one direction so all makers are playing from the same rule book.
Good routers tend to all blur into a group of good routers with bad routers finding bad comments so no one router stands out.
This is hard for most to accept.
That is, some think there is a router that will outperform all other routers by say 2 times.
That's untrue yet you find people researching this.
Here I use post 18 of this forum sticky if I need better coverage and it costs so little that maybe that's why many won't do that.
