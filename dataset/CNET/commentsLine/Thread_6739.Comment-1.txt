i am considering two, preowned netbooks: acer aspire one, 1.6 ghz, 8.9&quot;, 1 gb ram, 120 g hardrive or the asus eee pc 900a netbook with an 8.9 inch with 4gb hardrive main question...there is a big difference between a 120 hard drive and 4 gb.
also it seems that one has a ssd drive instead of a hard drive.
advantages/disadvantages?
