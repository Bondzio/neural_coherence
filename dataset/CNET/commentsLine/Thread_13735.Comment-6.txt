sorry for delay in responding but was out of town.i used the wd smartware prog.
loaded on the wd my passport.i did some additional searching and for the benefit of others i'll note how you can do &quot;deletions&quot; without formating the drive.with your my passport drive connected go to ....computer\external drive(my passport)\smartware.swstor folder and you can delete any file you select in there.why this isn't detailed in the &quot;user manual&quot; is beyond me.
