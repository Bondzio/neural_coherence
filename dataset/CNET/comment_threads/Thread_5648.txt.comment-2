Mike, I recently ran into the same problem here at my company.
We use Cisco Systems VPN Client.
Logon to the computer and open up the VPN.
Go to options and then click on &quot;Windows Logon Properties&quot;.
A new box will open...select &quot;Enable Start Before Logon&quot;.
Essentially this will cause the VPN to start right when the user hits Ctrl+Alt+Del.
This should resolve the drive mapping issue.
Hope this helps!
Eric.
