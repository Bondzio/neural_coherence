<s> Right now, I have a 40GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I also have a floppy disk drive. </s>
<s> If I take out the floppy disk drive, can I put a hard drive in its place or are they two different slots? </s>
<s> If I can't, should I just get an external hard drive? </s>
<s> And are external hard drives slower than internal ones? </s>
<s> Yes, two different sizes, two different cables. </s>
<s> Internal will be faster overall even though USB-2 is pretty fast. </s>
<s> Less clutter on the desk, nothing to plug and unplug if you go with an internal. </s>
<s> Since you didn't tell us anything about your system, OS and such, all I can say is internal. </s>
