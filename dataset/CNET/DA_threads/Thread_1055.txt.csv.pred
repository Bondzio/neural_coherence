1.1.1	For about two years now , I have been struggling with NAT and DSL problems with my AT & T service .	St
1.1.2	Some issues have been more or less resolved or dealt with , but nevertheless , some have persisted despite all of my working against them .	St
1.1.3	For the longest time , I can recall having severe NAT problems with devices such as my pair of Xbox 360 consoles when connecting to online services such as Xbox Live .	St
1.1.4	Ever since I replaced both my modem and my router a year ago , I assumed that all the networking gear was fully functional and that the DSL line was the cause of any problems , but if my technician is correct , this is now no longer the case .	St
1.1.5	Yesterday , he confirmed that after all of the work he did the last time he visited , the line is supposedly clean and up to speed .	St
1.1.6	But , my gaming devices continued to report strict NATs across the board .	St
1.1.7	A week or two ago , in order to accommodate some new speakers I had , I spent an entire night rearranging my computer desk .	St
1.1.8	I had to move all of my hard drives and both my 2Wire gateway and my Belkin N Wireless Router , requiring me to disconnect all of my cables and power adapters .	St
1.1.9	Clearly , everything had to be powered off in order to be moved about .	St
1.1.10	This took place after all repairs had been made to my internet service .	St
1.1.11	Alright ?	Ques
1.1.12	Everything had been rebooted , or power-cycled .	St
1.1.13	After reconnecting and setting up everything , I still noticed no change in NAT settings , not that I was looking for any problems specifically , but rather , because I was used to their presence .	St
1.1.14	My router has UPnP enabled , NAT enabled , and the proper trio of ports opened for Xbox Live , etc. , so there is no apparent reason as to why the NAT readings did not register as open to begin with .	St
1.1.15	This happened with the D-Link router I used to use many moons ago as well ( it no longer works , so I ca n't test it ) .	St
1.1.16	This past week , I noticed that my wired Xbox was having more trouble connecting to parties , games , and the Live service entirely .	St
1.1.17	I know Live was taken down completely on Tuesday for maintenance , but that did little to help me at all .	St
1.1.18	Yesterday , the Xbox I have connected to my HDTV in a separate media room began to disconnect frequently from the internet , but not from my wireless network .	St
1.1.19	The Live profile we use on it failed to sign in online , an then both consoles repeatedly reported a strict NAT setting .	St
1.1.20	The wired Xbox continued to function throughout all of this .	St
1.1.21	Since I ran out of options long ago , I decided to just try what the machine told me to do ( although I know I have tried some of the steps before with no luck ) .	St
1.1.22	The first step on Microsoft 's suggested path was to restart either your modem or router .	St
1.1.23	I did both , powering off my router and then the modem a few seconds after .	St
1.1.24	I waited around 30 seconds or so before reconnecting the power on the router first , and the modem last just as before .	St
1.1.25	I ran the NAT test on both machines , once they were fully functional , and lo and behold ! , they reported no errors .	St
1.1.26	Open NAT .	St
1.1.27	I was a bit surprised , but excited nonetheless .	St
1.1.28	Knowing that the test has ignored the strict NAT in the past , I retested the connections several times .	St
1.1.29	No problems .	St
1.1.30	I signed in on both machines , and no problems .	St
1.1.31	I watched the online performance and I saw no NAT problems .	St
1.1.32	All day , no problems .	St
1.1.33	If I popped in Halo 3 , no longer did I get a message in the game about a closed NAT .	St
1.1.34	I was thrilled .	St
1.1.35	I will still check my results in order to further validate them in the meantime , of course .	St
1.1.36	So that was mostly the story for now , and I am hoping I relayed it clearly .	St
1.1.37	But , I am still having some issues in which I could really use any help at all , so I hope I am able to explain myself well enough .	St
1.1.38	Now for some questions : 1 .	St
1.1.39	I do n't truly understand why this power-cycling worked .	St
1.1.40	Maybe the Xbox NAT test somehow configured the router for it ?	Ques
1.1.41	I ca n't tell how/if that 's what transpired .	St
1.1.42	The networking gear was off for a longer period of time when I rearranged the room , and as I mentioned , was still after the repairs made to my line some time ago .	St
1.1.43	Unless AT & T did something to my line since then or when I called my technician , I do n't see how this simple power-cycling alleviated my long standing NAT/firewall problem .	St
1.1.44	I had not modified any modem or router settings .	St
1.1.45	What could have happened ?	Ques
1.1.46	Now on a more general , less related note : 2 .	St
1.1.47	Lately my router 's coverage and signal strength has been noticeably diminishing .	St
1.1.48	My MacBook Pro can establish a connection of 130 megabits per second while in the same room as the router .	St
1.1.49	I have a Sony VAIO FW Vista notebook in the kitchen on the opposite of the house , no more than a couple of dozen feet .	St
1.1.50	It reports a 36 megabits per second link .	St
1.1.51	Both read a strong signal and are using 802.11n .	St
1.1.52	In contrast , the HP , quad-core Elite desktop I have in the media room down the hall ( same room as the wireless Xbox ) , registers a 135 megabits per second link with an excellent signal .	St
1.1.53	There are more walls between the media room and my so called office than between the kitchen with the VAIO , and yet the desktop is getting the quickest link .	St
1.1.54	Some specs : These three computers are using 802.11n and report excellent signals .	St
1.1.55	The MacBook Pro is a 2007 model with a 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo processor while the Sony VAIO is a model from last year and features a slower , 2.0Ghz chip .	St
1.1.56	Both have 4GB of RAM .	St
1.1.57	The Mac has the latest version of OS X Leopard ( 10.5.7 ) , the VAIO has Vista Home Premium SP2 .	St
1.1.58	The quad-core HP runs at 2.66Ghz , has 6GB of RAM , and runs Vista Ultimate .	St
1.1.59	It is getting the fastest connection while being the farthest away from the router .	St
1.1.60	This could either be because of different wireless card manufacturers , but I think not .	St
1.1.61	Every mobile , handheld device I own reports WEAK signals in the same room as the router .	St
1.1.62	My iPhone 3G ca n't pick up the network if I ventured outside , next to my kitchen and my first-generation iPod Touch registers a single bar in the same room as the router .	St
1.1.63	The iPhone is on OS 3.0 as of this week , but I have yet to upgrade the Touch from OS 2.2.1 .	St
1.1.64	I recently tried scanning for networks on my old Sony PSP device , using its latest firmware , and in the same room as the router ( this does get repetitive ) , it registered a signal strength of 14 % while the neighbors across the streets had a signal of over 50 % entering my home .	St
1.1.65	Now I think that portable gaming device only uses 802.11b , but my router is set up to allow b , g , and n traffic .	St
1.1.66	What other tests can I run or perform in order to correct this poor signal and coverage problem ?	Ques
1.1.67	I tried using AP Grapher on my Mac , but it has been crashing continuously and has n't provided me with any useful information yet .	St
1.1.68	This is very bothersome .	St
1.1.69	I think these observations , at the very least , do show how poor the coverage of my Belkin router is .	St
1.1.70	This appears to be the official product page for it .	St
1.1.71	I think it should have better penetration around the house .	St
1.1.72	My neighbors have an older Netgear or Linksys router that may only run up to 802.11g , and yet it spreads out much further .	St
1.1.73	I know that some routers are just better overall when handling coverage and throughput , but this looks abnormal .	St
1.1.74	I have already thought of using a range booster , but considering that I am getting very mixed results in the same room as the router , that may not help me so much .	St
1.1.75	Thoughts on that ?	Ques
1.1.76	3 .	St
1.1.77	I know this is very long , but please , bear with me .	St
1.1.78	As I have posted in previous threads before in the Macintosh-related forums , my MacBook Pro has reported errors in regards to WPA encryption on my wireless network .	St
1.1.79	It only occurs with my MacBook in my house .	St
1.1.80	When I have taken it with me to visit others , their WPA networks operated absolutely fine .	St
1.1.81	According to this Apple Discussion thread you can see that some others have seen similar problems , but have believed that these errors in OS X 's Network Utility are merely showing that some packets are being retransmitted and lost .	St
1.1.82	I mean , the network can operate on WPA of course , but give it a little bit , and the errors both sent and received by the MacBook increase more than exponentially .	St
1.1.83	Even if this is harmless as I have been told before here , on this link I have , and from some observations , I would like it to stop .	St
1.1.84	Considering that my NAT problem is absent for the moment , I want to knock all of these issues out of the park for good .	St
1.1.85	How can I go about fixing this ?	Ques
1.1.86	-- - Now , I am considering replacing the Belkin router with a new AirPort Extreme Base Station and possibly adding in an AirPort Express unit for good measure this weekend .	St
1.1.87	I also intend to replace all of my networking cables , for new gigabit ethernet wires just to be safe .	St
1.1.88	If I see no major improvements , there 's a good chance I 'll return the Apple networking gear ( if I can make it to an Apple Store with all of this iPhone madness going around ) .	St
1.1.89	If that fails , I will once again investigate settings on my 2Wire gateway , which is one thing that is a very time consuming task over here .	St
1.1.90	It is currently bridged to disable its routing functions since the Belkin should be faster with is 802.11n capabilities .	St
1.1.91	So its firewall should be off and should have no effect on anything , but you never know ...	St
1.1.92	I hate working with it as it has two separate interfaces , one only accessible when it 's functioning as a router .	St
1.1.93	To get out of bridge mode , I have to reset the entire thing and set it up as if I just got it out of the box .	St
1.1.94	Getting into bridge mode , according to a DSLReports guide , is much easier for me .	St
1.1.95	I think I 've done that properly .	St
1.1.96	But since I have had so many NAT problems , I wonder : if I restored my 2Wire 's routing capabilities , disabled its WiFi , and connected the Belkin , what results would I get ?	Ques
1.1.97	I did this before long ago , but I was getting double NAT interference .	St
1.1.98	My Mac noticed this and did n't agree with it at all .	St
1.1.99	But , if I disable the firewall on the Belkin while still using it as an external router , will my network still function ?	Ques
1.1.100	More importantly , is this safe ?	Ques
1.1.101	The Belkin would then broadcast a signal , but it would not provide any protection save that from the firewall on the 2Wire , the separate device .	St
1.1.102	This could work , but I have yet to try it out .	St
1.1.103	I think I already tried the reverse at one point , but decided it was not working any better than bride mode .	St
1.1.104	I 'll have to see .	St
1.1.105	Sounds simple enough , but I never seem to have enough time to dedicate to work on any of this thoroughly .	St
1.1.106	Plus , I always worry about breaking something in the 2Wire 's functionality .	St
1.1.107	It 's not easy to work with .	St
1.1.108	Please , any suggestions or feedback would really help me .	Polite
1.1.109	Again , if anyone could provide some counsel or references that I could work with , I would really appreciate it .	St
1.1.110	I 'm making this my weekend project , and I intend to succeed .	St
1.1.111	I am prepared to either troubleshoot or replace the entire modem and/or router .	St
1.1.112	If I need to clarify any other details , I can and I will if asked .	St
1.1.113	Many , many thanks .	Polite
1.1.114	-BMF	St
1.2.1	I tested it again this morning and the strict NAT/firewall setting is back .	St
1.2.2	Did n't think the open setting would last .	St
1.2.3	Again , any help would be appreciated .	St
1.2.4	-BMF	St
1.3.1	and it works very well .	St
1.3.2	Firewall problems appear to be nonexistent , speed is good , and now the only thing bothering me is that I have realized I may need a new range booster .	St
1.3.3	It appears the Belkin and the Apple router are not able to boost each other on a single network .	St
1.3.4	Still , if anyone has any knowledge regarding some of the things I mentioned before , I 'd be happy to hear them .	St
1.3.5	-BMF	St
1.4.1	You could just get a better antenna and place it on the router .	St
1.4.2	Keep antenna away from any magnetic devices .	St
1.5.1	The Belkin uses 2 antennas while the Apple has no external ones .	St
1.5.2	If I could link them together , then getting new ones would make sense , but that does n't look like it 's going to happen .	St
1.5.3	-BMF	St
1.6.1	You usually only need one router in a residential lan .	St
1.6.2	You should not have to daisy chain routers to get the configuration you want .	St
1.6.3	Can all your devices connect to one router ?	Ques
1.6.4	Deal with one problem at a time .	St
1.7.1	I 'm trying to get high coverage all over the house .	St
1.7.2	After many observations , I 'm thinking the walls around the house are too thick for the coverage I could normally get with either router .	St
1.7.3	Plus , I 've got wireless phones and satellite equipment for my TVs all around the place .	St
1.7.4	Generally speaking , all of my devices can connect to just one router , but say I want to hop on the WiFi with my iPhone or iPod when I 'm out by the pool or when I 'm just beginning to pull in the driveway .	St
1.7.5	The network does n't extend over there , although that may be a result of the new satellite dish I had installed for my DirecTV service .	St
1.7.6	Could n't get HD channels without it .	St
1.7.7	I checked over at the Apple Discussion Boards , and they confirmed that I could only extend a network with the Apple router so long as the other hardware was Apple-based as well .	St
1.7.8	It wo n't work with third-party devices , unfortunately .	St
1.7.9	So I 'd have to either get a range booster such as an AirPort Express or try something else entirely .	St
1.7.10	My neighbors across the street , who as I mentioned in my original post , have a very strong network signal in my area , actually use two different routers .	St
1.7.11	My neighbor works in networking/telecommunications , so when told me last night he ca n't get full coverage around his house without using a pair of Linksys routers , I took his word for it .	St
1.7.12	He knows what he 's talking about .	St
1.7.13	I 've seen some of the computers he has built recently , and I 've been a beta tester for his iPhone programs , one of which has yet to be completed and utilizes a new method of push technology .	St
1.7.14	I 've seen his work in action , and it 's amazing .	St
1.7.15	He 's definitely qualified in this area .	St
1.7.16	Now , he runs ethernet cables over and through some walls to connect his routers , as I recall , but that 's not really an option for me .	St
1.7.17	Plus , his house is a bit smaller than mine .	St
1.7.18	I could use the extra range and coverage .	St
1.7.19	Either way , none of these ideas seem too complicated .	St
1.7.20	All I need is a large , unified network .	St
1.7.21	Since I ca n't reuse my older Belkin , I 'll have to get something else .	St
1.7.22	-BMF	St
1.8.1	Can you draw a diagram that shows the layout of your LAN .	St
1.8.2	Just a simple lan diagram .	St
1.8.3	Use mspaint to draw it in .	St
1.8.4	What 's the square footage of your house ?	Ques
1.8.5	Is it a single or two floors ?	Ques
1.8.6	How many walls between the router and the farthest wireless you will be using ?	Ques
1.8.7	Do a second diagram with floor plan so I have a good understanding of your layout .	St
1.8.8	Just a quick drawing , nothing fancy .	St
1.8.9	Email it to me at philbernie @ yahoo.com .	St
1.8.10	I would love to help you out .	St
1.9.1	You are using 2 routers either to isolate 2 networks or to extend the reach of your wireless network .	St
1.9.2	Which one is true for you ?	Ques
1.9.3	Here are two sites you may want to read : http : //vonage.nmhoy.net/tworouters.html http : //compnetworking.about.com/od/routers/f/two_routers.htm	St
1.10.1	The problem is , the ( dual-band ) AirPort Extreme Base Station is only capable of extending wireless network managed by other Apple Base Stations .	St
1.10.2	I 've tried to connect it to the Belkin over WiFi , and it fails .	St
1.10.3	The Belkin N Router that I have is a decent router , but it does not have a & quot ; client mode & quot ; , according to the second link you have there .	St
1.10.4	With these software limitations , I ca n't do anything without using Ethernet , which is not a practical solution for me .	St
1.10.5	Literally , I would have to run at least 50 feet of cable through some walls , if I planned to place the second router down the hall opposite from the first .	St
1.10.6	Ideally , to completely saturate the house , I would want to put the second router in the kitchen , which is opposite diagonally from my office room , but then running cable would not be possible at all .	St
1.10.7	Ca n't run that through the living room , the largest room in the house .	St
1.10.8	So basically , I ca n't seem to do what I 'd like to with my current crop of hardware .	St
1.10.9	If I got an AirPort Express , I could use that and my problem would be solved .	St
1.10.10	The two routers I have now just wo n't talk to each other without using cables , which is something I ca n't do .	St
1.10.11	That 's where I am right now , since my firewall problems and my WPA problems are less severe for the time being .	St
1.10.12	Where are you going with this ?	Ques
1.10.13	I have a decent understanding of what I need to do , I just do n't have the range booster to do it .	St
1.10.14	I appreciate the help that you 're offering though .	Polite
1.10.15	Let me know what else I should clarify .	St
1.10.16	-BMF	St
1.11.1	You ca n't have two routers talk to each other wirelessly , unless one of them becomes a client acting as an access point .	St
1.11.2	You can have a router wired to another router in a daisy chain which is probably what your neighbor has set up .	St
1.11.3	However , you have to get off the idea that you need two routers to make your lan work effectively .	St
1.11.4	If the apple stuff works and does what you want , then stick with it .	St
1.11.5	If you want to set up a non-apple router , get at least a Wireless-g or -n and a signal boaster or a range extender which basically boast the signal so that it can reach your wireless devices .	St
1.11.6	Wireless router -- & gt ; Boaster/Extender -- & gt ; Wireless device .	St
1.11.7	Check out Fry 's Signal Boasters and Extenders .	St
1.11.8	It 's best if you stick with the same brand for these devices .	St
1.11.9	You can also boost your signal by using a high-gain antenna .	St
1.11.10	Two routers are n't necessarily the answer to your dilemma .	St
1.11.11	Good Luck .	St
1.12.1	On some routers , you can enable the & quot ; extended range mode & quot ; .	St
1.12.2	That will help some .	St
1.13.1	I had the Belkin router for almost a year and half , since the router I had before it broke when I tried to upgrade its firmware .	St
1.13.2	Since I 've had so many problems with my AT & T DSL service , I also got a new modem around the same time as the Belkin .	St
1.13.3	Now , I configured the 2WIRE gateway in its bridge mode as its routing capabilities were limited to what they like to call & quot ; Hyper G & quot ; .	St
1.13.4	The Belkin that I already was using had 802.11n , so I used the 2WIRE solely as a modem .	St
1.13.5	More recently , the NAT and firewall problems I 've always had were becoming more problematic and were completely blocking out different services that I use online , such as Xbox Live .	St
1.13.6	I got the new Apple router as a temporary replacement , and I planned on returning it if it did n't do the job any better .	St
1.13.7	The Apple router does n't seem to pan out as much as the Belkin , but it 's noticeably faster from the looks of it .	St
1.13.8	After I restarted my routing gear , before I got the new router this past weekend , the firewall problem appeared to disappear almost entirely , a good sign indeed .	St
1.13.9	Now with the faster router in place , I have a network that 's been practically rebuilt , and it seems to show .	St
1.13.10	I had the Belkin router left over .	St
1.13.11	It 's still functional and offers decent speeds considering it 's last year 's technology .	St
1.13.12	I wanted to try to repurpose it and extend the range of the network with it , if possible .	St
1.13.13	I have tried a couple of methods , and as I 've said before , with no luck .	St
1.13.14	I will have to get a dedicated range booster instead .	St
1.13.15	I already know using two routers together would create a problem ; as you wrote , I would have had to turn it into an access point , which was basically the plan .	St
1.13.16	Problem was the Belkin does n't seem to support bridging between routers .	St
1.13.17	If I could n't do it wirelessly , then it was a lost cause .	St
1.13.18	That 's it .	St
1.13.19	Thanks for the help though .	St
1.13.20	I appreciate that you took the time to try to work this through with me , as I 've had a plethora of network problems that are now in the past .	St
1.13.21	Hopefully , the new gear will work well for a very , very long time .	St
1.13.22	I do n't want to or plan on having to buy a new router any time in the foreseeable future .	St
1.13.23	Thanks .	Polite
1.13.24	-BMF	St
1.14.1	There 's nothing wrong with experimenting with your local network .	St
1.14.2	Wireless networking offers a special challenge because two wireless devices have to be able to sucessfully communicate .	St
1.14.3	If you want to experiment with network layouts and network devices such as routers , switches , hubs , repeaters , etc. , then it 's best to work with hardwire between those devices .	St
1.14.4	Wireless networking follow the same rules of topology and layout with the added difficulty of trying to get two devices to talk wirelessly .	St
1.14.5	If you ca n't connect two devices wired , then you probably ca n't do it wirelessly .	St
1.14.6	Keep on experimenting with your network layout .	St
1.14.7	Do n't be afraid to use wires 'cuz they still offer a better method for two nodes to communicate .	St
1.14.8	You can hide the wires up in the attic .	St
1.14.9	Keep your network simple enough as long as it does what you want it to do -- http : //www.microsoft.com/athome/setup/wirelesstips.aspx Good Luck to you	St
