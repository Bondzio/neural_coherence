i can't interact with the external hdd at all when it's plugged into my xp pc.
the &quot;delete partition&quot; option and all others are greyed out in disk management when i right click on it.
but, unlike my two internal hard drives, this one has little diagonal grey lines through it's section of the lower right pane, and it reads &quot;healthy (gpt protective partition)&quot; instead of &quot;healthy (active).&quot;
