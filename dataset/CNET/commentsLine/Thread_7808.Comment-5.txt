well, i read it in some articles, here are the ones i have the adress on:   -the source to my consearns is actually from the supportpage on the x58 extreme6, the modules arent in the supported list!!
how important is it to follow these guidances??
i have wrote to asrock, and am in the process of contacting kingston.
just thought, maybe someone knew how 'hard' one should follow that ddr-compatibility list.
(thanks for answering guys) dc
