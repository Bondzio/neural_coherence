1.5.1	The error explains upon getting the error , open cover and remove the *right* inkcart then close cover and open again .	St
1.5.2	If the light remains lit ( non-blinking ) ink cart you removed is the a problem .	St
1.5.3	If the led continues to blink , then the remaining ink cart still mounted is the problem one , buy a replacement for the one that it refers to .	St
