<s> I just bought a Geforce 8600GT graphics card so that I can play some games, as my current graphics card was too bad to support the games I wanted to play, and someone recommended the 8600GT to me as a graphics card. </s>
<s> Can somebody please tell me how to connect graphic card to my PC ? </s>
<s> And whether or not I will need to get some other things to connect it, like a cable or something ? </s>
<s> ...you remove the cover and plug in the card into the PCIe x16 slot, which presumably your computer has. </s>
<s> I would hope this card comes with an installation booklet, but two things you'll need to do are to disable any built-in graphics on your mobo or CPU and install the driver that comes with the card. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> If you research the 8600 DEFECTIVE posts on google you would only use this model if it was free. </s>
<s> There is no way to &quot;connect&quot; such a card. </s>
<s> We do open the case to plug them into the card slot but such install instructions are all over the web so I'm guessing you really are asking how to connect it. </s>
<s> Sorry, there is no such system in today's PCs. </s>
