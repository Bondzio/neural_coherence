<s> Well, about ten minutes ago, I thought my rig was finished. </s>
<s> The CPU and soundcard came in today, and I was so excited. </s>
<s> To my shock, I found out that my mobo sports an older 9-pin analog video connector, called a DE-9. </s>
<s> My flatscreen uses DE-15 pin. </s>
<s> My motherboard is an AM2 socket one with no integrated video. </s>
<s> I have a BioStar nVidia 8600 installed right now. </s>
<s> It has the traditional VGA 15 pin and DVI connections. </s>
<s> But when I plug my video cable from my monitor into the card, I get a &quot;No Signal Found&quot; error. </s>
<s> I KNOW the card is operating, because the fans are on. </s>
<s> I REALLY want to get this hooked up so I can install my OS. </s>
<s> Which leads me to my second problem, my disc drive won't open. </s>
<s> I have a traditional Molex power cable connected, and it's receiving power from the PSU. </s>
<s> The ATA ribbon cable is connected to both the drive and the mobo, yet IT WONT OPEN THE DISC TRAY. </s>
<s> I really need help here. </s>
<s> I'm panicking. </s>
<s> Have I done something wrong??? </s>

<s> I have a correction to make, my disc drive is working now, as long as the ATA ribbon isn't plugged in. </s>
<s> As soon as I plug it in, it stops working. </s>
<s> I MUST be the mobo, or something related. </s>
<s> Aren't drives supposed to open as long as they have power? </s>
<s> It sounds like no MB activity. </s>
<s> BTW, your 9 pin connector is likely comm port and not a video port. </s>
<s> Can you remove the MB from the case and put it on a tabletop? </s>
<s> Connect the minimum components needed to attempt POST. </s>
<s> You'll need RAM, the CPU and video card. </s>
<s> Make sure all power is connected including any additional connectors that might be needed for the video card and CPU. </s>
<s> Common causes of problems are pulled pins from connectors and unneeded standoffs on the MB panel that short out something on the back of it. </s>
<s> This is why we try it outside of the case first. </s>
<s> I've done the POST multiple times, and I still get no beep codes. </s>
<s> Everything seems to be working fine. </s>
<s> Should I get another mobo? </s>
<s> Pull it out hook it up as has been stated here in these forums many times...with minimum hardware attachment and outside of the box. </s>
<s> It's easy to make mistakes and, if you're lucky, they won't be fatal. </s>
<s> Beep codes indicate an attempt to POST but errors were detected. </s>
<s> No beeps can mean POST didn't even start. </s>
<s> This could be a missing voltage level. </s>
<s> A simple DVM would be helpful if you have access to one. </s>
<s> Check and recheck your work. </s>
<s> Look for pins in the PS connector to the MB that pushed out of their socket. </s>
<s> Pull the CPU and see if any pins have been distorted. </s>
<s> changing the connection on your monitor settings, i bought two brand new hd3870's running two monitors and there was no signal i then changed the signal on my monitor settings and got the picture back. </s>
