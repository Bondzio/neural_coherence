<s> I have some mobility problems and I can buy the necessary items only on the Web. </s>
<s> I use a nice Teac OX1200 mouse on my office computer and I tried to find similar mouse for my house computer but I cannot find the same model. </s>
<s> Several online shops offer Teac mouse of different models but without enough data to decide if they are what I need. </s>
<s> Is there any Teac catalog with data on the various models of Teac mice? </s>
<s> I could not find such on the Web. </s>
<s> Please advise Thanks </s>
<s> but I'm not sure it's going to be suitable for you. </s>
<s> It is a &quot;Non-English&quot; web site. </s>
<s> When I Googled Teac OX1200 mouse I found a lot of non-english web sites, mainly Russian, but also some Israeli. </s>
<s> I also found a lot of other sites which my browser security add-on WOT, (Web of Trust), told me were suspect. </s>
<s> I used Google {Translate} to translate an Israeli web site and found this; http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.zap.co.il/model.aspx%3Fmodelid%3D690744&amp;ei=rbLDTennC-TV4wba8_2kBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ7gEwAw&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DTeac%2BOX1200%2Bmouse%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1087%26bih%3D845%26prmd%3Divns Shorter version of that link, Zap.co.il . </s>
<s> That site seems to have these mouses for sale. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> thanks Mark yes, I know this site and i use them often, but they have not enough details on the various mouse models. </s>
<s> I am lookin for a catalog from Teac with details of the various models. </s>
<s> For the time being - to no avail. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway Yochanan </s>
