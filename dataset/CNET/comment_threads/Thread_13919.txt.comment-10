If after reading the posts there you still want an external HDD ... then go for it.
Otherwise...you're far far better off with an internal drive for reliable disk space.
Externals are ok if what you really need is portability of data between PCs.
Otherwise they're more prone to failure and susceptible to damage or even loss.
PS...all external HDDs come with one year warranty...most internals HDDs have 3 or 5 year warranty.
