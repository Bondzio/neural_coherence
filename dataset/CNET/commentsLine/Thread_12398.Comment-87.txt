this has been a very informative forum.
i'm also in the stationery biz.
although, i haven't noticed any comments about hp color laser printers.
does anyone love their hp color lasers that they would recommend?
i'm in the market again after owning my hp2550l for the past 4 years.
i'd like to upgrade.
here's what i need my perfect printer to do: 1. print on stardream papers (110# +) 2. feed 3x5 size as well as 8.5x11 3. no smearing.
is color laser better than inkjet?
i don't think i'm asking for much, but i'm having a heck of a time finding my perfect printer.
ps stupid question: is the xerox 8560 inkjet?
solid ink technology confused me.
thanks!
