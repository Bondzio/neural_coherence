The high then low thing rings a bell.
I have a Alienware R4 and had somewhat that same noise.
The tech came and could not find a thing, but he had the side panel and locking latch off when he was testing.
After a couple months of that I started pushing things on the outside of the case to see if I could get any change in the noise... once I pulled up the case locking bracket halfway in the back the noise stopped.
All along I thought for sure it was a fan.
I made a little cardboard shim and stuck it between the two metal parts.
No more noise.
This may not be your problem, but you can never tell on these things.
