1.1.1	So my Gateway desktop ( as well as my notebook ) have both recently died about the same time after 5 years ... strange , but anyway , I 'm looking at Dell desktop to replace the home system .	St
1.1.2	I do n't want to spend more than 500-600 .	St
1.1.3	There are many options , but some general questions : Can I use my Gateway monitor with a Dell ?	Ques
1.1.4	( I suppose not , but why not ? )	Ques
1.1.5	Can I use the Office and/or Works installation CDs to install those programs on the new Dell ?	Ques
1.1.6	These came with the Gateway systems .	St
1.1.7	I have heard that I ca n't use the XP installation CD either , but has Vista worked out all the bugs for a home user who is not using his system for gaming ?	Ques
1.1.8	Is it worth buying the option to keep XP OS on the new Dell ?	Ques
1.1.9	What will I need to ensure I can enable wireless networking at home ?	Ques
1.1.10	Lastly , I am interested in the Optiplex because I have read ( do n't recall where ) that the tech support for business machines is US based and not via India and an overall quicker and better experience .	St
1.1.11	Is this true ?	Ques
1.1.12	I am considering the Optiplex and if the tech support is not as described above , I may go with the Inspiron .	St
1.1.13	Thoughts ?	Ques
1.1.14	Thanks !	St

1.2.1	Use can use the monitor from Gateway on a Dell system .	St
1.2.2	You will need to tune it in if outside of its & quot ; native resolution & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	Any s/w that came with the Gateway in all likelihood may not work in a Dell as it verifies if the OEM EULA applies .	St
1.2.4	However , excluding the OS it may work , but it varies .	St
1.2.5	The OS itself definitely needs to be run under a Gateway system as the EULA rules applies here too .	St
1.2.6	Your new system will have an OS if Dell to be Vista .	St
1.2.7	Vista , has worked out some kinks but fixes come out regularly , it teething pain is behind it .	St
1.2.8	If you can hold out Win7 is supposed to be better .	St
1.2.9	Dell support if you need is there but as you stated , you really do n't have a choice , you go with the plan .	St
1.2.10	If you want so-called US support , then get a business system or from the business website , but read the & quot ; fine print & quot ; .	St
1.2.11	You may to query in the Dell forum for a better answer as Dell people are there .	St
1.2.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
