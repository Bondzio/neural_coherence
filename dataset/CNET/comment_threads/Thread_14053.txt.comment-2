My brother's emachines t5026 dvd burner died in like two weeks.
Emachines had good support though.
And as i mentioned, i'm still satisfied with my compaq sa4000t, the mothebroard has dropped a lot in price over the last 8 months around.
SO should the motherboard die, i won't think twice buying the replacement part.
The only thing i'm worried about is data loss, but i make backups, so not much of a hassle.
