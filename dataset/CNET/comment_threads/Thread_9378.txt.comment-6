I had a Dell laptop and I bought one of these universal PS, but guess what?
It did not work.
I checked the voltage output of the connector and check the connection and everything appears to LOOK ok...but yet, it won't work.
I end up getting a Dell replacement PS and it works like a charm.
So you might have the same situation.
Get a same replacement.
Good luck.
