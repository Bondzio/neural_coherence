Hi all, I just moved house and re-setup my computer (a Dell XPS T600r PIII, 512MB RAM, 50GB HD, 19in Dell Trinitron, NVidia TNT2 64MB video card.)
It works fine except for one annoying new problem: the screen now flickers and jumps 75% of the time.
Periodically it will stop for maybe a minute and then it resumes hopping.
I never had this problem prior to moving.
What might be causing this?
