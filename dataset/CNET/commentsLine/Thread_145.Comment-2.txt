&quot;the msi states that it must be a 1.5v card are all agp 4x cards 1.5 volt?&quot; no.
when i read this it states that for 4x the card must support 1.5 volt.
it's very confusing to most that the agp voltage is not set by the motherboard but by the card you put in.
and there are keys in the slots to stop you from plugging in an incompatible card.
sorry but i decline to re-explain this further.
