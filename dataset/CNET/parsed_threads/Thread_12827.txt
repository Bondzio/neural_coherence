<s> I have a western digital &quot;my book essential edition&quot; external hard drive. </s>
<s> When i plug it into a USB 2.0 port (i've tried it on numerous computers that have USB 2.0 ports), I get a message that says the drive will run faster if connected to a USB 2.0 port. </s>
<s> If you use the hard drive, I have determined that it is operating rather slowly, as if its a 1.0 drive. </s>
<s> Its as if the USB port is not recognizing the drive as a USB 2.0 device. </s>
<s> Not sure what to do next as it does not appear that there is a new firmware download available and the unit is out of warranty. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>

<s> Bob, thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> Both computers I have used do have USB 2.0 cards. </s>
<s> I installed one of them (the device manager shows an enhanced controller for USB), and the other is a new computer that a friend of mine has and does operate as a 2.0 for other devices that he uses. </s>
<s> I am using the cable that was sent with the hard drive so I'm still puzzled about this problem. </s>
<s> larry </s>
<s> I'd ask them to replace this unit. </s>
