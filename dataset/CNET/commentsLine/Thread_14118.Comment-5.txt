i ran into this last week.
the machine had onboard graphics as well as the vga card.
i had to move the cable to the onboard to change the bios setting and then back to the card for the next boot.
without make and model i can't tell if this applies or if that information would have me think of something else.
bob ps.
test the monitor on another pc.
pps.
check both ends of the vga cable.
