<s> Reread your post. </s>
<s> What is missing? </s>
<s> Did you read the red note below where you posted this question? </s>
<s> Since there are a gazillion Compaq towers, what do you think we may need? </s>
<s> You offered no details. </s>
<s> WAG here, but goto the Compaq support website and locate your model#. </s>
<s> There find the details for HD replacement( I assume new HD), that's the same info as adding 2nd or swapping out old HD. </s>
<s> In most cases, if no screws are present o open case, locate a &quot;latch&quot;, depress and slide side cover back or up to remove. </s>
<s> If you have a model that's a &quot;clam type&quot; you need to open as if like a book, spread the case open. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> Once again, it always helps if you provide details of your PC as much as possible. </s>
