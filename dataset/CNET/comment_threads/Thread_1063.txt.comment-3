You also need to install drivers for the video card.
If you don't have a CD with drivers, you can download them from the website of the card's manufacturer.
IE: If it's an ATI card, download drivers from the ATI website .
If it's an nVidia card, download drivers from the [url=http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html]nVidia website[/url.
