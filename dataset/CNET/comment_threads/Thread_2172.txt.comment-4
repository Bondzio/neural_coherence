I opened up the case and looked for anything obvious that was possibly interferring with the fan and didn't see anything.
Blew out a good amount of dust from the heat sink fan.
Both that and the fan in the power supply rotated from the canned air, but I will have my brother inspect them as he knows more about this than I do.
I am going to assume you are meaning to check them while the computer is running, So I will crack her open again to see how both of them look.
I know that some air was coming from the fan in the power supply when it was on, but perhaps it's not up at the correct speed.
