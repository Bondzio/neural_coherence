<s> I'm a webmaster currently running a PowerBook G4 (1.67GHz with 2GB RAM). </s>
<s> I'm going to upgrade very soon, but need the best for all the applications I'm running. </s>
<s> I use CS3, usually with at least 4 of the apps running simultaneously, plus Firefox, Entourage, and iChat. </s>
<s> I will also be adding Final Cut Studio to the mix. </s>
<s> Will the MBP with 4GB RAM be enough or should I go for the Mac Pro where upgrades and more RAM are possible? </s>
<s> Also, is anyone running those same programs on a MBP? </s>
<s> Any issues? </s>
<s> Thanx! </s>
<s> 1GB does most of what anyone does well. </s>
<s> 2GB is heavy users. </s>
<s> Beyond that is bragging rights. </s>
<s> That's TODAY!!! </s>
<s> Yes, I did some benchmarks on video rendering with 512M, 1GB, 2GB and the payoff beyond 1GB was all of 5 minutes on a 6 hour job. </s>
<s> So don't look to big gains past 2GB. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> for video editing the biggest thing the Mac Pro has over the MBP is additional internal hard drives. </s>
<s> Read from one, write to the other is more than 2X as fast as both operations to the same HD. </s>
<s> Then again, you could add a FireWire 800 external HD to the MBP. </s>
<s> Unless you do 3-D rendering, MBP. </s>
