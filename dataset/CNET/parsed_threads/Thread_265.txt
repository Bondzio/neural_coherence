<s> Can anyone tell me the difference between CPU cores? </s>
<s> I'm shopping around for a new AMD 64 3500+ on newegg and all the products have different cores like newcastle and sledgehammer. </s>
<s> What is the difference? </s>
<s> Does it make a difference? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Socket 939 please. </s>

<s> Just me talking here. </s>
<s> If this was me, I'd wait for a DUAL CORE Athlon 64 soon to appear. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Can you tell me the difference between the dual core amd 64s and the regular 64 939 socket amds? </s>
<s> Also will they be tailored more for the high end users, ie: price? </s>
<s> When will they be available? </s>
<s> The dual-core Athlon 64 as displayed was on a socket 939 board. </s>
<s> If you are looking at 64-bit, you are classed as a high end user. </s>
<s> You'll find that video editing, games and more on Windows 2000/XP/Linux/other OSes will perform better on dual CPUs. </s>
<s> Putting two CPUs in one socket is cheaper than DUAL CPU boards. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I understand the processing power will be greater but how about the price range? </s>
<s> (price maximum of $300) What speeds do they operate at? </s>
<s> Do you know where I can find information on this product? </s>
<s> Also what kind of motherboards will support this dual core? </s>
<s> Another question unrelated to CPUs, do you suggest that I buy a PCI express motherboard and gcard? </s>
<s> I'm leaning toward agp 8x because of its value but I'm not sure of the agps longevity. </s>
<s> Early 2005 from what I read. </s>
<s> Remember that Dual Core Athlon 64 was demonstrated on a 939 board. </s>
<s> If you are not interested in this, then go with what's available now. </s>
<s> Prices will be what they are in the future. </s>
<s> Such have not been published. </s>
<s> As to AGP, that is your choice. </s>
<s> It seems odd to entertain Athlon 64 socket 939 and not look at what the boards offer. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Asus' A8V Deluxe currently supports AGP 8X but they are planning to release a PCI Express capable motherboard in the upcoming months. </s>
<s> I would like to stay with AGP but I am worried about the longevity of this interface since I'm looking to use this comp for college and beyond. </s>
<s> You have at least 3 or so years till AGP vanishes. </s>
<s> The signs are all around you with newer machines having PCI Express. </s>
<s> When you see 1/2 the cards on display are PCI Express then the change over has begun. </s>
<s> No machine lasts on the leading edge more than a few months. </s>
<s> But you know that. </s>
