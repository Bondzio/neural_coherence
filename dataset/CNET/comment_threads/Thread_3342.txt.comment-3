Bob, Thanks for your response.
Can you please elaborate more on this.
What do you mean by common IP setting?
The two VLAN are different subnets and their internet traffic is routed through different WAN networks (ISP).
What hardware/software/TCP-IP configurations does this require?
How can we configure the proxy server to route traffic from different VLAN to different gateways?
