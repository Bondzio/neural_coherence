Is there any other way to find out the fault or to check the networking at the time of fault.Thanks in advance.

There are network monitor tools we find on google, so I won't write about that. However what I find in the field is that when a person finds a failed hub they cycle the power and the hub starts working. They miss the clue that the hub/switch is defective and end up doing a lot more support than needed. Maybe it's their choice since replacing the bad hardware would mean less work for them. Bob
