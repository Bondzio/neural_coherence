Welcome to the PC world.
It's a place where hardware and data just vanish.
It drives people crazy...now you see it/now you don't.
#1 rule.....backup/backup/backup.
Did you violate the rule?
As far as I know HD's don't go click-click-click.
So unless someone has a better thought, I would install that new HD, load windows, install the old HD as a slave and see if I could salvage any of MY STUFF.
