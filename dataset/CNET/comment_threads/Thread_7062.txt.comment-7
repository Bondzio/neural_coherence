It's a bit late for me to want to pull the fan and CPU apart right now, but I can only figure there's probably something wrong with the DIMM under the V8, since I pulled the other piece out, but the usual start-up beeps that occur on a normally-functioning system are missing.
If I can't troubleshoot tomorrow evening I'm going to have to take it in to a shop.
