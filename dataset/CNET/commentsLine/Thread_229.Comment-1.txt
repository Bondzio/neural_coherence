as it gets ready to feed a new piece of paper, hp photosmart 8250 makes horrid grinding noise.
it makes normal clicking noises, then very fast thack-thack-thack-thack, more normal clicking and then another set of grinding.
there are no error messages and it prints just fine (when there's ink).
it's been doing this for a while and we've been ignoring it.
what could cause it?
i posted this question in hp's forum in january and got no replies.
we don't print enough to use the ink up before it expires.
we ignore the warnings about using expired ink.
that wouldn't cause this, would it?
(those expiration messages are just so annoying.)
now it won't print black & white because it says we are out of yellow ink.
what does yellow ink have to do with printing black & white?
we don't know whether to throw this piece of cr*p away or buy more ink and put up with grinding noise.
this is windows 7 home 64-bit.
any advice would be most welcome!
