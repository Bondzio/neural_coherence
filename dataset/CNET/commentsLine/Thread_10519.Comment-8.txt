i think your 'mini' is nothing more then a microatx.
in that case any powersupply will do.
since it's a micro go for something modular (meaning you choose the cables you need while the others stay in the box and collect dust) to increase airflow.
here i'll even recommend one, somehow i have a feeling you're going to ask if any of them are amd compatible... actually never mind newegg only has one psu for a microatx...and it's only 200w build a new computer and make it a full tower
