<s> I'm planning on purchasing a black macbook. </s>
<s> I'm on a tight scheldule so i decided to get the 512mb ram one with a 80gb hard drive. </s>
<s> The only problem is that the apple website doesnt show it. </s>
<s> Amazon before had it for sale and now it went missing. </s>
<s> So my question is if apple actually sell a black macbook with 512mb of ram with a 80gb and if not, where is a legit place with the best price? </s>
<s> Thanks Candice </s>
<s> 1 gig memory and double layer super drive is worth the investment... and I would never recommend getting the non-super drive units... All the &quot;legit&quot; places will typically have the same price - if you do find it. </s>
<s> If the price looks too good to be true, it is probably a scam. </s>
<s> You've seen them update the macbook and the old units fade away. </s>
<s> There is often NO price increase but you get more for the same buck. </s>
<s> The current offering is what you really want for RAM and the other items. </s>
