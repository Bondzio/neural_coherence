is a rather obscure German clone, that's sold at shops like Aldi and Lidl here in Holland.
Nothing wrong with it, I assume, cheap and no doubt built from very standard components.
The first post about the model I find google isn't negative at all: &quot;I have a Medion 1467 Desktop PC, built like a rock and stable to boot.&quot; But I fear they don't publish detailed specs.
The best thing to do: go to a computer shop, take the case with you and let them advise you about a compatible PSU.
