1.1.1	I own a Cavalry 500 GB external HDD which I purchased on August 22 , 2007 .	St
1.1.2	It has worked great and I have not had any problems with it until today .	St
1.1.3	I took my external HDD to my friends house , so we could watch a movie on his TV .	St
1.1.4	My HDD was hooked up to his laptop which was connected to his TV .	St
1.1.5	The laptop was sitting on top of his TV cabinet and was pretty well supported and the HDD was resting vertically on the floor .	St
1.1.6	It was really really odd , but during the movie the laptop flipped off the cabinet and fell on my HDD .	St
1.1.7	My HDD then fell from the vertical position to the horizontal position , and momentarily after it started to make a weird noise - like it was trying to spin , but it could not .	St
1.1.8	Then the movie froze and the computer did not find the drive .	St
1.1.9	The HDD turns on and it starts to spin , and it sounds like it tries to spin several times , but it does not seem to spin all the way .	St
1.1.10	I am not sure if maybe some part became loose inside , or if there is damage to the magnetic drive itself .	St
1.1.11	I opened it up , and took the external case off , but I could not figure out how to take the actual drive apart .	St
1.1.12	I did not know what tool to use , I can send pictures to anyone if they would like to look .	St
1.1.13	I was just hoping maybe something got knocked loose inside .	St
1.1.14	So , my real questions are the following : 1 ) Is there anyway for me to tell what is wrong with my drive ?	Ques
1.1.15	2 ) If my drive is not fixable , is there any cheap way to get the contents off the drive ?	Ques
1.2.1	When I came back home and plugged it into my laptop , it started to whir except the noise was different and it was louder .	St
1.2.2	Then my laptop detected a USB mass storage device and said new hardware found , and the HDD tried to spin several times but then it just stops and becomes silent .	St
1.3.1	Sometimes you get lucky and it 's just the case .	St
1.4.1	A new external case ?	Ques
1.4.2	I would like to see if there is anything I could do first without spending money .	St
1.5.1	I usually just wait till the owner gives up and tries the drive in some desktop or a new case .	St
1.5.2	Sorry if this seems cruel .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Well , I guess I am going to try to open it up all the way - even the internal part .	St
1.6.2	Is there anything in particular that I should look for on the inside that might be out of place ?	Ques
1.7.1	I try the new case since it 's usually that .	St
1.7.2	That is , the power failed in said case .	St
1.7.3	Good luck .	Polite
1.8.1	I am not really sure .	St
1.8.2	The HDD is detected by Windows , but the HDD just does n't seem to load all the way .	St
1.8.3	Oh well , if I ca n't get it then whatever .	St
1.8.4	I appreciate all of your responses and help .	Polite
1.8.5	I will let you know how everything turns out .	St
1.9.1	If you put it in some desktop , case , etc .	St
1.9.2	I do n't know if it 's time to mention data recovery software such as RECUVA , GETDATABACK or ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY .	St
