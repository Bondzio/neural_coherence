Before i bought the computer, he had hard drive problems so he had given it in and got a new hard drive for it. It's definitely not a hard drive problem. I think its most definitely a driver problem because i had the same problem with the modem yesterday, i just needed to get on another computer, and download the drivers for it. But that was a different story because i knew what type of modem i have. This time, i can go to device manager, and it will be under &quot;other devices&quot; named Video Controller(VGA Compatible). Along with it in the &quot;other devices column, is Multimedia Audio Controller and Ethernet Controller. I can type in &quot;dxdiag&quot; into Run and go to display, and beside name and chip type and all of that are just &quot;n/a&quot;. I have no idea what's going on here at all? Do i really have no video card?

(Sorry that i didn't include it before) Operating System: Windows XP: Home Edition RAM: 2542 MB Processor: Intel(R)Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz (w CPUs) System Model: D65GBH (it's a custom computer put together at the store) Also just discovered it can't detect the sound card either. or the ethernet controller so it's most definitely a driver problem
