okay, my new xerox phaser 8560 is wonderful!
the waxy images look very &quot;professional&quot; and it's so easy to load the ink that any preschooler who's figured out how to put those shapes through the lid of the box can do it.
so far i've run 5 large jobs on it using 80lb cardstock, vellum, labels, and envelopes.
everything goes through easily, though the envelopes do mis-feed occasionally.
things to think about, however: * this printer does not do borderless!!!
the print quality is so good that you'll be tempted to want to do full color invites, especially since the ink will not curl the paper...just be prepared to trim off the edges.
* it is very loud when running so you think about it's location.
* i've been having to do a lot of research about color matching because for browns & pinks, what i see on my screen is not what comes out.
the blues and greens seem to be fine, though.
(anyone who knows what settings to change are welcome to chime in here!!)
i've been working around that with trial and error, but hoping to find the correct settings to get them to match more closely so i don't have to waste paper.
other than that, i am a happy camper.
good luck with your printer searches!
