you've misread all the articles.
let me toss them all away with this statement.
-&gt; laptops are not desktops.
laptops are finely engineered units which you will not overclock or fiddle with.
as to the 64-bit question, i've witnessed the transition in the &quot;workstation&quot; aka sun computers and others from 32 to 64-bit and the changeover was much faster than anyone expected.
if you go with the athlon 64, you can run xp 64 now, and the xp 32-bit sp2 will use its externsions as well.
if you stick with 32-bit, my best advice is to not overinvest and to think that you are buying a two year machine.
