maybe 256kb memory in 1969??
my first ibm pc didn't even have a hard disc and the next one, an ibm pc xt had a whopping 10mb/mb?
hard drive but still a pittance of ram in the very low kb range which was awesome for then.
i did have an ibm at and put an expanded memory card which got to 512 kb.
oh well, most of the phone and cable vendors will argue that their service is 6 mb/s downstream when it's really 6 mb/s.
let's don't get sticky, it's only 8x's different!
who cares, it's only performance!
let me know if i am wrong...i gotsta know!
