Thanks - I am looking at putting a computer together.
It will only be relatively low-power, but different cases come with different PSU's supplied.
I didn't want to get one with a higher capacity one if all it was going to do was chew up electricity for no reason, but if it doesn't actually use more then it doesn't matter so much which case I get.
