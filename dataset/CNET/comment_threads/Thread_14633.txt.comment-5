Well in that aspect, I guess it would be a better choice to use DVD-RW media.
Fortunately I have Dual Layer discs, so that gives me some extra storage space per-disc.
I was hoping to use USB for an easier storage method, but not at the cost of potentially losing data.
That would basically defeat the whole purpose of backing it up.
