Wifi adhoc networks and what channel is allocated depends on a humans choice.
Since most humans don't change the settings the channel allocation is &quot;none.&quot; There are proposals and studies that parallel what is done in all radio or cellular systems where you sniff the airwaves for the open channel or less cluttered but I'll stop here since I would be duplicating all prior documents.
Back to wifi adhoc today.
There is no channel allocation I can see in the 802.11 spec on that.
You just choose and use the channel.
-&gt; So from a paper standpoint you just go get the 802.11 papers (costs a few bucks if your schools didn't have them in the library) and read it over to fill in your paper on this.
Now if you were going to paper design something better then all that is moot since you just plow ahead with your new idea.
