this is typical, but yiu should have noted how *your fans* were ordinated.
front chassis fans, blow-in, rear fans, blow-out.
hsf, usually blow-on or down onto the cpu.
however, if you have no directly mounted cpu fan, and is off or mounted elsewhere, usually that implies its trying to blow-out the chassis when connectewd to some sort of wind tunnel.
when you look at fan blades themselves directly, they are usually blowing towards you.
in better fans, a decal or embossed air shows the direction of flow.
