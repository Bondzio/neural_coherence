<s> Hey, I do not know a lot about computer networking. </s>
<s> I was looking to get internet for my laptop. </s>
<s> I have a wireless connection at home, but I wanted to use internet on the go. </s>
<s> Do I have to purchase like a monthly plan or could I purchase some hours as I go? </s>
<s> Could someone help me with this, please? </s>

<s> You buy their Wi-Fi card and connect to their 3G network. </s>
<s> Be prepared for a hefty setup charge and a monthly bill, probably with a one or two year contract. </s>
<s> Call'em. </s>
<s> Don't expect home connection speed. </s>
<s> Bring money. </s>
<s> Many cafes now have cheap or free wireless internet -- you just need a regular (not cellphone) wireless adapter such as is built into most current laptop models or can be added for less than $40. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
