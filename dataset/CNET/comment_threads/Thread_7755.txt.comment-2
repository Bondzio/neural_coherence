Just read about it the other day, it's easily the best pci graphics card out there.
Good luck finding one, though.
Supposedly costs about $130, but there's probably limited availability, if you can find one at all, so prices might be a bit steeper.
Look at CC and BB, Newegg's supposed to carry, but isn't available yet.
