Is this what you are looking for? http://osdn.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=400637/ut=45223de36eeb57ca

And a video card with both DVI and VGA connectors on same card. DVI to one monitor and VGA to other monitor. Hook um up.

Not sure if your video card supports this dual monitor option however.

I bought one years ago this way. Just put DVI to PCI Adapter in your search engine and you will find many to pick from. I have a GeForce 4 ti4200 with the same config.
