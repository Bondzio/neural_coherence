<s> I have a wired network using a Linksys hub a P4 with XP pro and a P2 (laptop) with win98. </s>
<s> The internet access is through the P4. </s>
<s> Messenger will sign on using the P4 but will not sign on using the P2. </s>
<s> I can access all other MSN pages. </s>
<s> Also, on the P2, eBay will let me sign on but will not allow me to d/l the items for sale just the categories. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>

<s> It's unclear how your network is configured. </s>
<s> But worth noting is that many put in firewalls and can't configure them. </s>
<s> I can't offer ANY support for a firewall since Zonelabs has their own support. </s>
<s> Your setup is unclear, the firewall effect seems to be indicated and I wonder what changed since it worked. </s>

<s> The only firewall I am using is the one with XP pro. </s>
<s> The high speed modem connects to my P4 via USB. </s>
<s> The P4 connects to the hub via ethernet as does the P2. </s>
<s> I used XP pro to set up the home network. </s>
<s> I can access messenger on the P4, no problem, but when I sign in on the P2 it just sits there. </s>
<s> I have tried to connect on the P2 after turning off the XP firewall (on the P4) but that doesn't work either. </s>
<s> The hub doesn't have a firewall. </s>
<s> Yahoo messenger works fine on the P2 & P4. </s>

<s> ICS may or may not work in it's default setup, but to use MSN messenger networks, you can try using GAIM instead from http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ http://www.cyberwalker.net/columns/mar04/msn-messenger-audio.html gives us clues that MSN Messenger is not going to work all over. </s>
