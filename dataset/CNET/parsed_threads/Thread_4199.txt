<s> Help me anyone, I recently had to reformat my computer due to a serious virus and in the process of re-installing my systems I put my HP printer disc into the system. </s>
<s> It used to work, or should I say, respond as soon as you wanted anything to print.But since I`ve got things back and running ok the printer takes about 20 mins to print anything off. </s>
<s> It says it`s printing when I check the status but I can`t wait that long for stuff, seeing as it WAS ok before hand. </s>
<s> I have downloaded Hp software, drivers and stuff to make it as it was but still no luck.. ANY IDEAS??? </s>
<s> I`m desperate.. </s>
<s> The disc I have with the software doesn`t make any difference. </s>
<s> Both inks are LOW and in need of refilling, will that make it slow down? </s>
<s> Or is it another issue? </s>
<s> Please help Wolfey </s>
<s> Detach ptr. </s>
<s> from system and do a &quot;self-test&quot;, is it OK? </s>
<s> Also, when on the system, do its own test pattern output, is it OK? </s>
<s> Besides the reloading of the OS, etc, plus all drivers, have you updated the OS as well to include DX, etc., any updates fromt he MS update service? </s>
<s> Of course the printer should be at its best, if under its test pattern it mentiones, low ink, replace. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> what causes the printer to try to print and feed paper after you print only one page?i tried hp support and followed all the steps,without any success. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help,Edward </s>
<s> Please explain under what conditions the extra paper feed, etc. </s>
<s> causes the ptr. </s>
<s> to behave this way. </s>
<s> I do suggest make a simple text test page using notepad and then print it out, if it prints OK but feeds more than required, then you may have a problem with the system rather the printer. </s>
<s> What are the results? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> what does OS and DX mean???? </s>
<s> I have tried to update with MS but to no avail.I`m in need of some major help. </s>
<s> When I installed it the process said I should use the LTP1 port is that right? </s>
<s> or should I have it set for something else.I`ve never rebooted a system before and didn`t look at all the settings for stuff before we cleaned everything off.I`m at a loss as to why it was ok and now it`s a slow as the preverbial SNAIL! </s>
<s> Gooner </s>
<s> i went into notepad and typed a line and whent to file print.it printed fine but tried to feed more paper and tried to print. </s>
<s> edward </s>
<s> I suggest you check the setting to see if the &quot;media&quot; is the type you're printing to. </s>
<s> If not, change it and save it before exiting. </s>
<s> Plus, you should at least redo the setting to &quot;defaults&quot;, try a print, if its OK, great if not then verify what the changes should be made. </s>
<s> Very possible the print area of the media is smaller than it should be and/or an &quot;autofeed&quot; is proper for to be ready for next print job. </s>
<s> The reason I mentioned a simple print test for output. </s>
<s> Also, if you have footer cmds. </s>
<s> remove them, these are the items &quot;page 1&quot; or &quot;file123.txt&quot; that get printed out along with the next, default them or blank(no cmd.). </s>
