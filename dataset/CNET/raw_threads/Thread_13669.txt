Most of our printers use HP Jetdirect cards. We cannot ping any of them, but we can ping computers just fine. We have a Windows based workgroup. All printers have static IPs. We have a DHCP server, and it looks fine, too. I'm sorry if this is not enough info, but I am not sure what info would be useful.
