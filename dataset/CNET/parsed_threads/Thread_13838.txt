<s> I need a monitor that can stand up to the rigors of gaming but I will also be using it for everyday computer use as well. </s>
<s> I would like an LCD but I am open to a CRT. </s>
<s> I have around $300 - $400 to spend. </s>
<s> Somewhat flexible but that is my preferred range. </s>
<s> I am going to buy in the next couple of days and am not very knowledgeable monitor wise. </s>
<s> The card I have is the Nvidia 6800GT. </s>
<s> Was thinking 17 inch would be the best size option when considering price and quality. </s>
<s> Please, let me know your opinions. </s>
<s> i'd get a new CRT they'll perform better for gaming eye strain isn't an issue with a high refresh rate it'll also save money ocmpared to an LCD that potentially has dead pixels, or will have issues with games not to mention LCD's cant change resolution (their not supposed to) what i mean by that is that they are designed to run native, and nothing else with a 15&quot; LCD vs one of my 17&quot; CRT's (I use two) I would be limited to 1024x768 or am ax of 2048x768 (dual monitor is nice) with my monitors I can go from a puny 640x480 (or less) to a whopping 2496x1024 (not for gaming, 1600x1200 is the max, but neither monitor can handle that (not many 17&quot; CRT's can)) i'd suggest a 19&quot; CRT such as one from Viewsonic thus allowing 1600x1200 to be playable (and since the 6800GT is easily capable of that, i'd buy a monitor to support it) it'll cost around $200 </s>
<s> I'd say get a 17 inch LCD monitor. </s>
<s> LCD tends to be more reliable, and easier on the eyes. </s>
<s> You can usually get a generic 17 inch LCD for $200 to $300. </s>
<s> The problem with larger CRTs is they have huge pixle size, it's like looking at a TV up close... </s>
<s> If you have limited space, go with the LCD If thats not a problem, go with a CRT as they tend to perform better for games. </s>
<s> Have you gone to a store and looked at monitors? </s>
<s> Since CRT monitors are desinged for close viewing they have a small picth .026 or less. </s>
<s> much much smaller than a TV. </s>
<s> Of all the display types CRTs are the oldest amd most reliable. </s>
<s> LCDs can have bad pixils, the back lamps can fade/get dim, or just burn out. </s>
<s> Also there is the speed of LCD or how fast it will respond to changes, this is measured in milli-seconds, the faster the better, this is important for games. </s>
<s> They can be fragle, something can puncture the front of the screen and the liquid will leak out. </s>
<s> You do have to carefull cleaning them. </s>
<s> The big advanage of LCDs is in size and weight, they clearly win here. </s>
<s> Yes get 19&quot;, good for watching DVDs. </s>

<s> if you were to take a 19&quot; CRT and set a resolution of something like...hmmm, oh let's say 640x480 it'd be torture on your eyes (make it extra fun and drop the refresh to 60hz) but at a high resolution, 1280x1024 or higher, those pixels are invisible large CRT's are designed for large resolutions large LCD's are supposed to do the same yet they cannot change their resolutions as freely, and your stuck with it's response time, it's not variable with a CRT you can pick the lowest refresh rate at which you do not notice flicker (for me that is around 72hz, so I round up to 75hz) and then select the abosolute highest resolution that the monitor can do that refresh rate at (for mine it's 1152x864, which they run 24/7, gaming or not) and it works fine on a good 19&quot; CRT however 1280x1024 should be possible at 75hz or even 80hz and 1600x1200 should be possible at 65hz to 75hz for example this NEC: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824002247 1600x1200 would probably look fine on that this ViewSonic is a little better, and a little more expensive http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116302 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116201 ^yet better and also, run the recomended resolution for desktop (i'd suggest doing that at least, which is 1280x1024, and then if you wanna push your video card to run 1600x1200 you could have a VERY nice experience with gaming (but please do note, 1600x1200 will not remove aliasing, while higher resolution makes edges look less noticeable, to have a chance at removing aliasing (jaggies) a resolution of 4000x4000 is the minimum, and it's commonly seen that resolutions as high as 16000x16000 or even 18000x18000 would be needed to make aliasing un-noticeable, so it's just easier to anti-alias the image) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824001166 ^ that Samsung is very nice http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116282 ^ a comparable viewsonic these haven't even broken $250 and your budget is $300-$400 if you'd like a higher grade mointor consider a professional grade CRT such as the Electron Blue by LaCie, which is around $350~ or one of these ViewSonic G series displays http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116228 </s>
<s> My main reason for using LCD's was that I heard it doesn't strain the eyes as much, but if the refresh rate is good on a CRT, it won't strain the eyes either, so I am looking for good CRT's now. </s>
<s> what is a good dot pitch for a CRT? </s>
<s> the dot pitch affects the flat-ness, not the refresh you can have a rounded CRT and have a good refresh rate but i'd suggest around .24MM (0.024MM would be sick, and cost like millions, if it were even possible) </s>
<s> LCD is better in just about every way, that is, other than cost. </s>
<s> But still, at around $250 for 17 inches, it's somewhat affordable... A lot of people suggest that LCD is less reliable, which is not true. </s>
<s> You just won't notice a few pixles go black, which amost never happen. </s>
<s> CRT monitors, on the other hand, can break down completely. </s>
<s> Have you ever had a CRT montior suddenly changing color tone, because one of the 3 color scanners stop functioning? </s>
<s> I have, and it's to be expected. </s>
<s> LCD creates less heat, uses less power, and has no moving parts (so to speak). </s>
<s> It's only natural that it's more reliable. </s>
<s> LCD is also a lot easier on the eyes. </s>
<s> Besides creating much more UV, CRT monitors flicker. </s>
<s> Just because you set the refresh rate higher than your eyes can follow, doesn't mean it stops flickering. </s>
<s> The flicker is still there, and it hurts your eyes without you knowing it. </s>
<s> a cheap CRT from 1985 would fit that i'm talking about $300+ professional design grade CRT's designed for graphics animation LCD's are only for home users and companies who are trying to save space a CRT rarley breaks down their nearly indestructable and they have no moving parts either an LCD can be damaged just by poking it i can tap, poke, run my hands across, and lightly stab my CRT and rounded face ones can sustain more impacts LCD's have the issue of verious angles at which you can't see them the UV thing is rather stupid, as all monitors have to pass a low radiation emmisions test. </s>
<s> you can scream and moan about how an LCD is easier on the eyes all you want but a few things remain true A) CRT's don't ghost B) CRT's don't have dead pixels C) CRT's will go for 15 yrs w/o issues if you buy a half-way decent one D) i'm suggesting the best CRT's on the market E) LCD's hold no inherent advantage, they can ghost, dead pixels happen, their only positive is that they fit into small spaces if you want to get into specs, the CRT can change resolutions an LCD has issues even doing that aside the fact that every CRT i've owned has never just broken down (with the excepion of one, but it was frozen at -15* C for about 19 hours, and it still worked, full color definition, no issues, just smaller image than the screen could see (it shurnk the image) and it had to be replaced, with a second CRT which survived the same freezing, and LCD wouldn't work after -15* C) LCD's are a horrible invention they claim to be easier on the eyes and your going to sit and tell me that a refresh rate of 75hz is going to anhilate my eyes i bet your also going to tell me flourescent lighting is easier on the human mind/psyche/eyes than incandescant? </s>
<s> all artificial light flickers LCD flickers just not noticble (it's in response time) i'd prefer a CRT over an LCD, just because it'll provide better color definition and better image quality i mean you can't blame your one bad experience to out weigh the positive experience/known knoeldge of a few million people that isn't fair </s>
<s> People are switching from CRT to LCD, not the other way around, and there are good reasons behind it. </s>
<s> CRT definately emitt more UV, and UV definately hurt your eyes. </s>
<s> Flicker, at any refresh rate, hurt your eyes. </s>
<s> CRT always flicker. </s>
<s> You don't punch your monitor for no reason, and saying LCD can be broken easier that way just doesn't make sense! </s>
<s> o_O And finally, who would pay $300 for a CRT? </s>
<s> Jeez! </s>
<s> -_- </s>
<s> uhmm who says ppl r switchin to lcd. </s>
<s> computer manufacturers provide it only cuz ppl like to save space. </s>
<s> lcd's picture qualtity suks more than crts. </s>
<s> not unless you're gonna buy like those 500+dollars lcd. </s>
<s> also how r u even noticing a fliker unless u have a junk crt or a junk video card. </s>
<s> it can also be cuz u r staring at the screent oo closely. </s>
<s> also on uv, find me proof where it affects ur eyes. </s>
<s> staring at a crt or lcd screen for hours at a time every day can harm ur eyes/ also pretty good crts cost only 200 bucks not 300 and who would buy them? </s>
<s> gamers of course! </s>
<s> Why do you need proof that UV hurts your eyes? </s>
<s> I thought that was obvious... CRT does produce more UV than LCD, and UV does hurt your eye, so what's wrong with that? </s>
<s> As for CRT looks better, that's just individual opinion. </s>
<s> They just look a bit different. </s>
<s> Some people are used to CRT, and don't like change. </s>
<s> In any case, CRT flicker, no matter you notice it or not. </s>
<s> Even flickers that you don't notice still hurt your eyes. </s>
<s> So I guess that you stopped watching TV years ago? </s>
<s> what does it mean by diagonal or horizontal refresh rates? </s>
<s> It has to do with how fast the screen refreshes vertically and horizontally. </s>
<s> For CRT, it's mainly about horizontal. </s>
<s> btw, I have a 21 inch LCD TV, and it looked far better than any old vaccum tube, thank you very much. </s>
<s> if UV truly hurt the eyes as much as you say it does...a few things: a lot of people in australia would be blind a lot of coders and gamers would be blind a lot of graphics designers would be blind and so on CRT's aren't designed for extreme close viewing there is supposed to be some distance between them and you... UV hurts your eyes, but your eyes heal aside the fact that professional graphics design is still done on CRT (ever see a &quot;Professional Color System LCD&quot; ??? </s>
<s> no, want to know what all the high end graphics desingers use? </s>
<s> CRT's costing between $250-$1700 (yes, there are $1700 CRT's, it's a Sony, it's one of the top 5 best monitors in the WORLD)) LCD's are only good as a gimmick and as a &quot;i'm so advanced I have everything LCD, aren't I cool&quot; statment LCD's are excellent in smaller devices, such as mp3 players, portable TV's, watches and PDA's but for computing the CRT is the only way to go also, i'm not saying that you should punch your monitor i'm saying if your a gamer, there is a good chance you'll goto a lan party thank you i'd prefer a monitor i can wipe off with a paper towel when something gets spileld on it, or a monitor that doesn't go down when bumped with an LCD, you spill something on the screen, it's basically done i'm not saying people aren't switching from LCD to CRT but you want to know why your statistics work? </s>
<s> what monitor does Dell give away for free with the purchase of a computer? </s>
<s> their 14&quot; LCD yes, Dell affects statistics that much (in graphics, Intel is actually the market leader, by volume, and Dell has stated many times that they cannot use AMD due to AMD's lower capacity (2 fabs vs Intel's 20+)) CRT is the choice for a serious gamer LCD's are fine if your needing a space saving solution/like blatantly wasting money but let's consider my pair of 17&quot; Flat CRT monitors cost in total $450 for the pair (one was $300, but it's not worth near that, so call it $140, along with the other one (Which is nearly identical) so let's say $280 for the pair that'd get you 1 comparable LCD or 2 lesser LCD's that still couldn't support the resolution that these things are using...all for what? </s>
<s> a saved 6&quot; of desk space? </s>
<s> well, considering that most desks have a keyboard tray most of those trays can take a mouse and most desks that don't are often deep (and most people don't use 2 monitors like me :D) you aren't really giong to benefit having an LCD your just gonna have this huge void where clutter will build...and it's going to be a lesser monitor...unless you spend $250 for it...which is outrageous and lots of people buy $200-$400 CRT's people like: gamers graphic artists web designers home users business workers coders and many many more people the higher image quality is more of a common view, than an opinion the CRT is the superior gaming monitor LCD's are more of a space saving system for example, in an RV or boat an LCD TV would be excellent, as it saves space in a cramped enviroment yet in a house/apartment it's not going to matter much, as the desk is taking the same ammount of space either way... </s>
<s> You countered the arguement that CRT produces more UV by saying it won't be enough to give peopel eye cancer... O_o I don't know why, but that's really funny... ^_____^ </s>
<s> What is the best LCD there is out right now? </s>
<s> and does it even come close to the quality of CRT's? </s>
<s> I have a 19'' and two 17'' CRT monitors that are 'Flat Screen'. </s>
<s> None have given me any trouble even in high end games like Doom3, Half-Life2, Far Cry, Riddick, Medal of Honor & Call of Duty series, etc..... From everything I have read in other game orientated sites and forums, gamers have traditionally favored CRT montors over LCD, many claiming that unless a LCD is a high dollor one, it just cannot keep up with the fast action of some games. </s>
<s> If you do gaming along with everyday computer use and desire an LCD I would suggest you get one with a low ''ms'' (Response Time) at around 8ms (don't think anyone has mentioned that in this thread). </s>
<s> Samsung has a nice 19'' model 715n with 8ms & 700:1 Contrast Ratio at Newegg for $312.99 Retail after a $20 mail-in rebate. </s>
<s> http://tinyurl.com/8zrc3 The ViewSonic 19'' VX924 has a 4ms for $469: http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/Category.asp?Category=19 Check around other stores locally also for low 'ms' LCD's and low prices. </s>

<s> Alright, these gamers are nuts... </s>
<s> I'm telling you... </s>
<s> There is just no way you can tell any kind of lag in monitor refresh rate. </s>
<s> Graphics heavy games usually run at 30-40 fps on average systems. </s>
<s> Compare that with monitor refresh rate. </s>
<s> As the colors... You've got to be kidding me! </s>
<s> These people are nuts! </s>
<s> How can you tell the subtle difference between a few million colors!? </s>
<s> -_- </s>
<s> on my 25ms LCD, I noticed some ghosting when I ran this screensaver I got off of BenQ's website... </s>
<s> LCD don't produce ghosts and need degaussing. </s>
<s> That's only for CRT. </s>
<s> the problem that is most reported as why not to use LCDs. </s>
<s> Yes the newer ones are not as bad, but if you read some of the details at toms and anand's the faster use 6 bit rather than 8 bit and are not as good on color as the the slower ones. </s>
<s> I'm colorblind but I ca read. </s>
<s> In all honesty you seem to have never read anything at the gamers sites. </s>
<s> That's because gamers are nuts! </s>

<s> yeah, i'm sure its not my eyes, cause I also tried it on a CRT. </s>
<s> its really not that noticeable, but i'm just trying to say that LCD's DO ghost. </s>

<s> it uses a 8 bit panel. </s>
<s> most gamers are on tight budgets and don't spend their parents' money the spend their own i know, i'm one of these nuts aside the fact, that thing about CRT's ghosting CRT's don't ghost and only require a deguass, when you've been an idiot and put a magnet near them secondariy, LCD's ghost with games, as stated here and it's very noticeable i think we've found the supierior monitor in terms of gaming and it would be (As i stated in about post 3) the CRT as it doesn't ghost ever has no dead pixels and supports more resolutions, and better color definition </s>
<s> Well there are a lot of ineresting posts going on this, some with good info and some with a lot F.U.D. </s>
<s> Now as for CRTs the first computer I worked on with a CRT was in the early 1970's so they have been used as monitors for a long, long time. </s>
<s> The one thing about CRTs is X-rays if the high voltage on the CRT is over 25,000 volts it can generate X-rays. </s>
<s> Now most computer CRT onlt are in the 12,000 range so you safe. </s>
<s> And they use leaded glass on some to be safe. </s>
<s> Since you keep talking about UV, lets see now LCD monitors are lighted by cold cathode floresent lamps and floresent lamps DO PRODUCE UV rays. </s>
