hi, i am not very tech savy but i have a cell card for my dell 610 laptop that gets almost broadband speed and my company pays for unlimited use.
i was wondering if i could use this as a connection for my home pc (both windows xp) so that i can cancel my cable modem and if so what equipment do i need to buy and how would i need to connect it?
thanks in advance for your help.
