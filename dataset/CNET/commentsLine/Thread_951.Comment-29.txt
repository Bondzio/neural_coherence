the answer to your question depends on how big the partitions are on your existing system that you intend to back up.
if there is only one drive letter, then you should partition the new drive about 20% larger than that drive.
this will allow for expansion with the existing computer's drive capacity as you use it and back up the system in the future.
the partition the rest of the drive as you see fit.
then, you can decide which file format to use on the new partitions, either fat32, ntfs, or linux (just a plug for alternative oss on a dual boot).
if there is more that one partition on your existing system, then you will need to create similar sized partitions on the new drive.
then, you will be able to back up the partitions to the new drive, and repartition the balance of the drive into whatever sizes that you would like.
i found norton ghost very capable to back up to specific partitions and maintain file integrity.
the one caveat is that if your existing hard drive is partitioned as fat32, you will need to partition the new drive partitions the same.
ntfs will try to change your existing system's file format if it is not ntfs.
this could render your system unusable, and require a new installation of the os and its associated applications.
