if you haven't heard, there's been some more rumors about apple reentering the sub-notebook market.
though they've been around for some time, people are starting to think that apple will introduce new 13-inch mbps without optical drives and a bunch of battery saving and better performance stuff.
it's all over the place.
i think that this was a smart move.
you could get an external dvd drive anyway with better quality burning and reading than a regular laptop drive, not to mention hd dvd and blu-ray.
more power on hand, more portability, and perhaps better performance?
one big problem is large installs/downloads, disc booting and stuff, upgrades, etc.
you'd definitely need an external or another mac with target firewire mood to accomplish most of those.
still, this is a smart move for apple.
a better alternative for the macbook for those who need better power/performance.
anyone disagree?
