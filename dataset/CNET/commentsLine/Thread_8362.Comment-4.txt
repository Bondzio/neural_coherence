on the processor?
that fan is the loudest on a pc.
50 degress celcius during gaming.
with 3 fans, i can do that without a btx case.
i only have 1 out fan 80mm (unlike your 120mm) and 1 pci exhaust fan.
no psu fan.
total 3 fans, and 1 smaller than 2 of yours, runs at 46-49 idle,but processor fan the loudest is spinning at 100%.
if i had another fan, which my oem case cant accomodate without a mod, and a $10 tube of ac5, i could probably get the same thing.
