<s> I have a Intel Processor running on Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> I have bought two Kingston 512 MB of RAM and I have propely put it in the soket. </s>
<s> The problem is that on Windows, it says that I have 896 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Did you check to make sure this RAM was compatible with the motherboard you installed it in? </s>
<s> If not this could be the issue. </s>
<s> That is why many mamory manufacturer sites have a configuration tool. </s>
<s> This will allow you to put the make and model of you board in there and it will tell you the part numbers that you should purchase. </s>
<s> This is really a big factor. </s>
<s> Does not matter if you set the memory in there correctly or not. </s>
<s> For example on SOYO board only takes dual sided RAM in slots 1 and 3 and in slots 2 and 4 it must be single sided. </s>
<s> Which leads me to another factor. </s>
<s> You could try moving your RAM into differnt slot combinations because you may have the same issue. </s>
<s> The final thought would be that you have a bad stick. </s>
<s> Right click My Computer and click the properties button. </s>
<s> I did not find anything like the sort. </s>
<s> ...where you get this number. </s>
<s> Also, is it listed as total RAM, free RAM, used RAM? </s>
<s> What is the computer model? </s>
<s> Does your computer use integrated video or a video card that has shares system memory? </s>
<s> If so, some places will display the total system memory minus that which is being used for video display. </s>
<s> What does PC Wizard ( http://www.cpuid.org/pcwizard ) say about your installed memory? </s>
<s> ...that you got it from the System Properties window. </s>
<s> Sorry about that. </s>
<s> Still, try a system utility program like the one I previously mentioned. </s>
<s> If you subtract 896MBs RAM from 1024MBs RAM you get 128MBs. </s>
<s> Since you've added RAM, maybe plug and play and the OS sets aside more RAM ... maybe 64MBs, for the onboard video. </s>
<s> I also have to inform you that I made this custom. </s>
<s> It has an ATI Express 200 and I think that it takes 128 MB of my RAM. </s>
<s> Thanx! </s>
<s> a separate video card ?? </s>
<s> Or one of the new video cards that has some RAM on the card but can use some of the system memory too ? </s>
<s> problem solved. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
