How fast would 2 dual Nvidia gt 640 vs 1 Nvidia gtx 660 ti be? I run a ok 250fps on my 1 gt 640 now but with a super low config file and rez set to 1440.

Or rather the problems often mean we have to re-vamp the machine to get it to work as well as they expected. A single card is the easy path. Your choice but if you go with dual cards, be sure you have support on hand and a thick wallet. Bob

To me, dual worked well only during the demo days (at a computer show in my land). Thereafter, it was one problem after another. Had to go back to single card coz support for dual wasn't free a-tall. Suit yourself.
