Alright so I tried installing a new sound card on my custom built machine. when I went to turn it on and install the new drivers, when it wouldn't boot. nothing! I hit the power and the LED lights come on fans kick in but no video signal is sent and the monitor just goes into stand-by. What could be my problem here? I am thinking mobo, but hoping maybe just the RAM. How to I check before buying all new??

Power supply fan and CPU fan both start,again no beeps from the memory, Monitor LED doesn't change from amber to green. Tried pressing reset button but nothing happens, pressed power button again nothing, only way to turn off is to disconnect from mains power supply. Wondered if there may have ben a power surge overnight? Anybody got any ideas? otherwise it's going to be case of swapping each componant into another machine one at a time to find the fault. Regards Mike

Look on your mobo for the jumper to clear your CMOS and short it out. If there isn't a jumper to short remove the battery for a short time whilst disconnected from the mains. this will restore CMOS to default settings. It has worked for me so give it a try! Regards Mike

I pulled out the lithium battery to clear the CMOS. when I put it back in and restarted my PC I was still in the same boat as where I started. Any other ideas? I'm about ready to just give it up.

The power comes on, the hard drive light is on (constantly) the cd rom light comes on briefly and then that's it. I tried clearing the cmos but no joy I don't care about tha data...it's my kids PC, but I don't want to throw it away. Bit of a bugger really Richard

THE LIST: 1. Motherboard. 2. CPU (with heatsink/fan.) 3. Power supply. (Yup, you need the AC cord.) 4. The speaker (connected to the motherboard...) When I find a dead dead unit I strip it down to these 4 pieces. If it powers up and beeps I start adding parts. If it doesn't power up I'm looking at 4 possibly bad parts. Bob
