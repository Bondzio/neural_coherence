It sounds like no MB activity.
BTW, your 9 pin connector is likely comm port and not a video port.
Can you remove the MB from the case and put it on a tabletop?
Connect the minimum components needed to attempt POST.
You'll need RAM, the CPU and video card.
Make sure all power is connected including any additional connectors that might be needed for the video card and CPU.
Common causes of problems are pulled pins from connectors and unneeded standoffs on the MB panel that short out something on the back of it.
This is why we try it outside of the case first.
