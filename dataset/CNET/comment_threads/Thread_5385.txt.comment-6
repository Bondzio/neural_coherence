If it's an Internet connection then you are sharing that connection with others (contrary to whatever any company tells you).
This is true for cable, DSL, Fios, satellite.
The more people in the pool that you share are on, the slower your connection.
As people disconnect or their activity ceases your bandwidth increases again.
DSLreports.com has a nice speed measuring tool which works not only for DSL.
It is quite reliable.
Use that during different hours of the day.
