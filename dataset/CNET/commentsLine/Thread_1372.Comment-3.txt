the e310 is an entry level type pc.
definitely not a gamer.
too little amount of ram (only 512mb....xp needs that much, the integrated video is 128 shared memory), a midrange speed cpu and &quot;no&quot; agp or pci express 16x slot for a better graphics card.
you'll have to find a pci or an even more rare pcie 1x graphics card for the system.
you are restricted to the integrated ( intel gma 950 graphics of the 915g chipset) to the chip on the mobo.
see the reviews:     the only thing i see to help your system (inexpensively) very much would be to upgrade to at least 1g of ram........sorry....................
