i recently received a compaq 6010 with the same problem.
after some trial and error, i ordered a new asrock mainboard from newegg for about $45.
it fit right in, runs great, and has a lot of upgradable features that the original didn't include.
the only issue was needing a longer internal usb cable.
found it on ebay at $5 total.
