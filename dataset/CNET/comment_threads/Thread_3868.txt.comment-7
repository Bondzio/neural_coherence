&quot;If original holographed Windows XP CD won't install, it's a hardware issue.&quot; Yep, that's true.
Nothing in your post reveals what could be busted here.
It could be bad anything to issues like someone trying to format a drive ahead of time to too much RAM for the XP in question.
Or simply trying to use a Dell, HP, Gateway XP CD.
