<s> I want some opinions out there. </s>
<s> If saving money and getting more for your money was your main concerns, what would be better, building your own PC from the ground up or buying a pre-configured one??? </s>
<s> I have a good source to build one, but I don't know if I want all the hassle that goes along with that. </s>
<s> I've had a PC built for me before by a family friend and it was just too much hassle to take it over and see if he had the time to fix it etc. </s>
<s> But I don't want to pay huge inflated prices for a pre-config'd system either, but have any repairs be easier. </s>
<s> The one I'm considering has a few extended warranties built into the price already. </s>
<s> I'm not a gamer, video editor-type, just a basic surfer, who does a little business on my system. </s>
<s> I'm not a gamer. </s>
<s> If I price out the parts for a PC and a monitor and software I can't come close to what I can buy a package deal for. </s>
<s> But that assumes that all the parts of a pkg deal are of any value to you. </s>
<s> I'm not looking to buy a new machine but every so often I visit Dell's bargain shop.....nice stuff....yesterdays model....cheap. </s>
<s> There is a benefit to building your own. </s>
<s> You gain a certain amount of knowledge about how the parts fit together and when it does not work quite right 'you' just go in an fix it. </s>
<s> low-end pcs ($500 or so) can't be beaten price-wise, but they are usually either bottom barrel components or have little, if any, expanision capabilities. </s>
<s> once you move up to a mid-range pc ($1000), building your own becomes more competitive. </s>
<s> when you build your own, you can choose where you want to put your money (ram vs. cpu for example) and tailor it far better than any custom configurator. </s>
