To verify this find another monitor and hook it up. If the other monitor Does the same thing you might try updating your video drivers or getting a new video subsystem altogether, but I've never heard of a video card getting blurry, not to say it CAN'T happen.

It is a signal that you may have to replace your monitor, blurry screens signal defective flyback or other monitor parts. A monitor or CRT (if yours is not an LCD type) may get busted after a long term use like light bulbs. Try using your monitor to some other computers for you to check. If the same problem occurs, then spare some money to buy a new monitor. If the monitor runs okay with other computers check your video card if you are using one, an on-board video adapter is more difficult to deal with.
