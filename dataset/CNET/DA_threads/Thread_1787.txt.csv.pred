1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	I hope someone will be able to help me here and that I might actually learn something at the same time !	St
1.1.3	I work off a couple of Lacie drives but for some or other reason I am unable to delete anything off these drives and restore the memory that was taken up before i deleted an item/project.. Therefor up until now I have always just finished a project on a certain drive and then formatted the whole drive to clean it up .	St
1.1.4	This means that I can not choose what I want to delete , because even if I delete it off the drive ( stash it into the trash ) , the memory is still in use and the drive still fills up .	St
1.1.5	This is starting to become a problem because I have quite a few projects running at the moment and am running out of space !	St
1.1.6	If anyone can maybe help me and explain to me if there is a different way in which I can clean the drives without losing specific folders or projects I would really appreciate it !	Ques
1.1.7	It is quite hard to explain but I hope what Im asking makes sense !	St
1.1.8	Thank you !	St

1.2.1	Moving something to the recycle bin does n't make the space available .	St
1.2.2	It just stays on the disk in case you want to restore it again .	St
1.2.3	That 's the purpose of the recycle bin .	St
1.2.4	Do n't complain about that .	St
1.2.5	The answer : 1 .	St
1.2.6	Either delete it by pressing shift-delete in stead of delete .	St
1.2.7	2 .	St
1.2.8	Or go into the recycle bin and delete it from there .	Sug
1.2.9	It 's the same on any hard disk , internal or external .	St
1.2.10	Nothing wrong here for the moment .	St
1.2.11	By the way , do you realize that external drives are n't really reliable ?	Ques
1.2.12	This forum is filled with 'Help me ' messages from people that loose all their data on it .	St
1.2.13	Better have a good backup scheme !	St

1.3.1	Hmmm I might have explained myself wrongly !	St
1.3.2	K so this is it , I work off an Apple Power Mac as a video editor so I can not really afford to clog up my Apples Hard drive as it will slow it down to such an extent that I can not edit anymore , this is why I am working off the Lacie 's - no other choice really !	St
1.3.3	I will also add that I have tried cleaning the trash after I moved a specific file from the Lacie to the trash and in the process did lose that file but its size in megs is still on the Lacie ( the file is gone but I cant seem to recover the megs that this file took when it was on the drive ) I hope this is more clear ? !	Ques
1.3.4	It surely is a strange situation and any help would be greatly appreciated !	St
1.3.5	Thank you !	St
1.3.6	Kneukels	St
1.4.1	I 've never had such problems with a removable hard disk in Windows .	St
1.4.2	It ca n't be a hard drive problem , I 'd say , so it 's an OS issue .	St
1.4.3	A possible work around .	St
1.4.4	Partition the Lacie in , say , three partitions , each 200 MB , one for each project .	St
1.4.5	Then you can format that partition only at the end of the project .	St
1.4.6	Kees	St
