Okay, so nothing will be Blu-Ray quality, I can do with DVD then.
Not a problem there.
And I looked at the Wi-Drive, but if I place movies on it, and want to watch them while on a flight, then I would think that there would be a problem with the Wi-Fi on a plane, even if it is only localized.
or is it okay, because it would be so localized?
