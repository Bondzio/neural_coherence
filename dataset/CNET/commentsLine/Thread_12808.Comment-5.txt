everyone likes their breakfast, lunch, dinner, clothing, music, etc.
a certain way.
why shouldn't our computer system be made the way we want???
from the case on, there are choices, choices, choices.
yet, my wife gets frustrated in the &quot;cereal&quot; aisle, because......&quot;too many choices&quot;!!!
i want to know each and every component in my system, (i have someone build it for me), but i choose (or have suggested) what drive, ram, videro card, how many fans, drives, etc.
i want, then, when i'm done (and my wallet is crying for mercy, i choosw what case i want.
see-through, lit?
?, am i going to carry it?
(oh no, it stays put) but my biggest factor is &quot;expandibility&quot;!!!!!!
my system has some components 9including the case), that going on ten years old now.
it has four fans, a upgraded 500gb hd, wonderful new flat screen monitor, have gone through keyboards like my wife goes through pantyhose (anyone else now despise wireless keyboards)??
when it comes time to &quot;start over&quot;, i am confident that much of what i am using now will be utilized, and as far as... ahem, uh, tech support....., well, the guy or gal, who built the system for me, has all of the component criteria at their fingertips, no &quot;mystery&quot; gear that's &quot;sorry, you can only use our parts with our components&quot; runaround.
now, if there is need for multiple systems say as for a office app, then, i would have to say &quot;dell&quot;, because as a &quot;temp&quot;, i am in many many many offices, and the vast majority is dell.
now, if i can only convince my wife that &quot;alienware&quot; really will make the internet a &quot;smoother, faster, cheaper&quot; place to be......
