<s> My mother wants a tablet for Christmas and is leaning towards the Ipad. </s>
<s> But I am not really sure if the Ipad is the right one for her (aka it's kind of expensive). </s>
<s> The main reason she wants it is to play 'Words With Friends' when she is waiting at the doctors' office. </s>
<s> At the moment, she plans on relying on wi-fi and not getting a cellular plan for it. </s>
<s> Also, she would properly like to play her pogo.com games and read her kindle books on it. </s>
<s> Her eyes are not the greatest so it needs to be at least the size of the kindle. </s>
<s> So, what do you'll think is the Ipad the right one for her? </s>
<s> When you went with Pogo my mind said no go. </s>
<s> I doubt the iPad would work with that site. </s>
<s> To get that working you are looking at the old Windows 7 tablets. </s>
<s> I pulled up my Kindle Fire HD (starts at 199 bucks) and Words With Friends is available from the Amazon store so that's a go go. </s>
<s> If we dismiss the mess of Pogo I think we get a two out of three with the KF HD. </s>
