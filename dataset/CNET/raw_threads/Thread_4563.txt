I'm using DVDFab 6 to burn movies, the drive reads the movie just fine but when it gets to the stage of burning the temp file the drive won't recognize the blank media. It's a Dual Layer and I've tried Ridata and Maxell discs but still no recognition. Can anyone shed some light on this. I'm using AMD Athlon 3000, 2.1 GHz, Windows XP.

There's some other reason the NEC Drive isn't reading the discs. I went to the NEC website to check for compatibility and they gave two other brands, Fuji and Phillips. I guess I'll try those and if they don't work either I'll need more feedback on this issue.
