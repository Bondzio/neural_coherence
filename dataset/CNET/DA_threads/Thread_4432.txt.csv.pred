1.1.1	what do you think which one is better the canon pixma MP500 or the hp C6180 i dont really need the fax but i want the one that has a better quality in the photo printing and has a better cd/dvd printing ability what do you think i need to buy?	St
1.2.1	Okay, first the MP500 is not available from Canon as a new printer any more.	St
1.2.2	It has been replaced by the MP 510 and MP 530 (with fax).	St
1.2.3	Now owning the the MP 530, and knowing what I do about the ink cartridges, the Canon is a better value than the HP.	St
1.2.4	However, the HP will do a good job on photos.	St
1.2.5	If cash is not a problem, and you want the best AIO without a fax look at the Canon Pixma MP960.	St
1.2.6	Look at what you really want to do, neither of the ones you want will print directly on photos, only Epson's will that I know of.	St
1.2.7	The HP isn't bad, but the cartridges will end up costing you more in the long run.	St
