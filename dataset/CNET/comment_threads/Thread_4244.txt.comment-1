My hard drive recently stopped working after my laptop took a fall.
I replaced the hd with a new one and re-installed the os (win7) So my laptop is up and running again.
Here's the hard part, I used a usb to sata converter for my old hard drive to pull the data off, I've recovered a good portion of the files now how do I put them to use on my laptop with the new hd?
I've copied the files from the old hd and saved them in a folder already.
It's mostly pics, music, and documents.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
