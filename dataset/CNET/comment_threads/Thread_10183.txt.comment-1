I just got an 80GB Hitachi external hard drive in an Ultra enclosure, and I can't seem to access it with Win XP using firewire.
My Inspiron 8200 laptop is a few years old, so no USB 2.0.
Instead, I use a PC card with firewire ports to connect to the HD.
The computer recognizes the device and it pops up as a drive in the device manager, but it doesn't display an accessible icon in My Computer.
Does someone know a way that I can get into this thing?
Thanks, Bryant
