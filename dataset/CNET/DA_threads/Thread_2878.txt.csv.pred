1.1.1	I'm building my first gaming desktop.	St
1.1.2	Here's what I've got so far... i5-2500k sandy bridge Nvidia geforce 660 500gb hdd 8gb RAM (depending on mobo) Cooler Master HAF 922 pretty much everything except a good motherboard.	St
1.1.3	$200-$300 price range.	St
1.1.4	Not looking at SLI.	St
1.1.5	Needs HDMI.	St
1.1.6	Ideas?	St
1.2.1	Take a look at what Gigabyte has to offer, check on New Egg and other sites for costs and specs...you should be able to find something in that price range that will do the job.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	(stupid phone) I've done my homework but all the different terms and features confuse me.	St
1.4.2	I know for sure I need HDMI (tv will serve as monitor for now) and two front usb 3.0 connectors.	St
1.4.3	When it comes to pci, pcie, sata, raid, etc...	St
1.4.4	I don't know what I'm looking at and the difference between a $150 or $250 mobo.	St
1.5.1	Most folk don't need 250 buck boards.	St
1.5.2	HDMI is usually on your video card so just make sure it has that.	St
1.5.3	Also, for video cards I like this link.	St
1.5.4	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Bob	St
1.6.1	Take a look at HDMI capable PCie(video) slot cards, there are a bunch out there....there will be a PCie slot on the vast majority of Motherboards and that would/will be your HDMI hook up...some Motherboards already have HDMI capability onboard, if not you would use a slot card to acheive the capability.	St
1.6.2	Your basic drive hook ups are going to be SATA, HDD, DVDRW....etc., that has become fairly standard.	St
1.7.1	Thanks for clearing up the HDMI confusion.	St
1.7.2	I'm looking at the MSI Z77 G45 Thunderbolt.	St
1.7.3	Does anyone have any opinions on that board or others?	Ques
1.8.1	C'mon guys.	St
1.8.2	I know someone here has some hands on experience with the G45.	St
1.8.3	Would it be a good choice for a first timer?	St
