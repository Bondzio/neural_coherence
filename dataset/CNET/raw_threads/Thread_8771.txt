What I'd like to know is: Is there a Micro SD slot in the N-7?. What kind of Music Formats will it play? What kind of Video Formats will it play? If I plug in a Device into the Micro USB will it recognize a Device? Such as a OTG Cable with a Ext-HDD,or a Mini/Micro SD Card Reader with card plugged in? If not,is there a similar sized tablet I should be looking at? Thanks in advance.
