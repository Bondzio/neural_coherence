1.1.2	Does anyone know how to do the BIOS update ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	Given your story and we have no reason to update the BIOS , why do this ?	Ques
1.3.1	RESOLUTION : If the battery discharges below a certain charge level , it may not be able to be recharged unless the System BIOS is flashed to revision 3102 or later .	St
1.3.2	http : //support.gateway.com/s/issues/220124590.shtml Only problem is that Gateway does n't tell you how to do it .	St
1.4.1	I always leave it to the makers to tell how .	St
1.4.2	If they do n't we have to ask them .	St
1.4.3	You do n't want to have a forum tell you how without referring back to the maker 's site .	St
