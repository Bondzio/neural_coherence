I did use an Android smartphone for a while but have since discontinued it. I would like to go with a tablet that has most of the features as a smartphone. I'm assuming, like a smartphone, one can download apps such as weather aps and the like? Which operating system is the best? Can tablets be used like desktop computers, like, being able to wipe all data and reinstall the OS? Any help will be appreciated, James

As to the last question, so far yes. But look before you leap. An android tablet won't be something you'll find a lot of other OSes for. Bob
