7971	0	355700	3109883	NR	DR_COOL	8/23/09 12:20 PM	1.25103E12	Hard drive rpm	I'm looking to buy a hp laptop, for use mainly in school, and maybe some gaming here and there (Warcraft 3, civ 4, oblivion if I'm lucky, but probably not). Anyway, I was wondering if there's a huge difference between have a hard drive with 5400 rpm, and a hard drive with 7200 rpm. Considering what I'd be doing, would it have a huge effect? I was also wondering if you could tell me if my other specs look good. They look fine to me, but I'd like a second opinion. - Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo Processor T6500 (2.1GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 800MHz FSB) - 3GB DDR2 System Memory (2 Dimm) - 32-bit vista (will upgrade to win 7) - Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 4500MHD (I'm unsure about this card, I know it couldn't run Oblivion, but could it run Civ 4 an Warcraft 3) Thank you

For all intends and purposes only under intense work cycles will it be noted and even then it depends on the task. Actually, for laptop usage, slower speed is desirable as a safety measure of sorts. The choice is yours. tada ------Willy

If you have to get a value machine, I'm giving this chipset the nod. About drive RPM. The balance in laptops would be the 5400 RPM. I won't write any long dialog about this but it's where I like to be. Bob

The other thing you may want to consider is whether you get a matte finish (anti-glare) or gloss (highly reflective) screen with the laptop. I strongly recommend the matte finish as it eliminates glare and reflection coming from anywhere and everywhere. If you're getting Vista...I recommend getting the 64 bit version and that you should get a free upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. Let us know how it turns out. VAPCMD While I'm not 100% sure it has a matte (anti-glare) screen, this HP laptop looked pretty interesting to me. Downside it is what it is.... no options although you could change/replace the drive. http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/222148/HP-G70-460US-17-Widescreen-Notebook/
