In general, you can put faster DDR memory modules into motherboards that have RAM slots running at slower speeds.
The faster memory will run at the slower speed.
There are some other things to watch for, such as compatible voltages, and maximum size (density) of each module.
I just put a 512MB PC3200 module into a Dell motherboard that specified PC2100 as its fastest speed.
Works great!
