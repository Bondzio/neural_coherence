well, i guess waiting has paid off.
i just read at cnet about the samsung galaxy that is coming out ?
and priced ?
i like the flash capabilities, the camera and also the smaller size.
my e-reader is the same profile and it's super lightweight and easy-peasy to carry around.
i'll check out the other two manufacturers that you suggested, too.
