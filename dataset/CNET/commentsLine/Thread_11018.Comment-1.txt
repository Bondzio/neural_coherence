i own a cavalry 500 gb external hdd which i purchased on august 22, 2007. it has worked great and i have not had any problems with it until today.
i took my external hdd to my friends house, so we could watch a movie on his tv.
my hdd was hooked up to his laptop which was connected to his tv.
the laptop was sitting on top of his tv cabinet and was pretty well supported and the hdd was resting vertically on the floor.
it was really really odd, but during the movie the laptop flipped off the cabinet and fell on my hdd.
my hdd then fell from the vertical position to the horizontal position, and momentarily after it started to make a weird noise - like it was trying to spin, but it could not.
then the movie froze and the computer did not find the drive.
the hdd turns on and it starts to spin, and it sounds like it tries to spin several times, but it does not seem to spin all the way.
i am not sure if maybe some part became loose inside, or if there is damage to the magnetic drive itself.
i opened it up, and took the external case off, but i could not figure out how to take the actual drive apart.
i did not know what tool to use, i can send pictures to anyone if they would like to look.
i was just hoping maybe something got knocked loose inside.
so, my real questions are the following: 1) is there anyway for me to tell what is wrong with my drive?
2) if my drive is not fixable, is there any cheap way to get the contents off the drive?
