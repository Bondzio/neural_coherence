i found that when an iphone or other things are in the brew, the shared airspace may pull back to 802.11b speeds.
to fix this i move the router to 802.11g only mode and if i need a wifi link to a hdtv set i may even use a second dedicated wifi router as a wap.
we discuss that in the top posts of this forum.
new idea.
set the router to 802.11g only.
