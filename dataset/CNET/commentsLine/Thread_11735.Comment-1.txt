my barton 3000+ with 1gb ram will not play mp4 or mkv videos without lag getting out of sync.
(my ipad2 with play them seemlessly!)
that is really the reason i want to upgrade.
is a athlon ii x2 with 2 or 3gb ram going to cover my needs?
what else might i want to do that this level of pc won't handle?
a lenovo with the athlon ii x2 (only a 180w power supply??)
mini tower is only $350- from newegg it has onboard ati radeon 3000 graphics as well.
really need help!
thanks...
