I have it connected to my HP Media Center m7360n via the VGA connection and it works perfectly well. On Black Friday I decided to get a bigger monitor/TV but I am cheap, so I bought the Emerson 32 inch that Wal-Mart had on sale for $388, and then gave my old TV to my roommate. I thought I was getting a good deal, however, now, maybe not. The problem is my PC has no HDMI port and the new TV has no VGA port. I tried connecting them using RCA cables with no luck. I think that problem lies with the PC as the DVD player connected to the new TV with no problem. My question is, do I have to buy a new computer with an HDMI slot, or is it possible to upgrade my existing computer? I would appreciate any help. Thanks.

I've never done this with VGA to HDMI to a TV, but I did this with a DVI to VGA to a regular monitor.

If video card, you need to disable the on-board video, install new card with required ports and s/w to finish install. Being a media center system may complicate things, IMHO. Of course you can google away for others that may have fixed a similar issue. Believe me, this HD TV stuff is getting popular BUT attaching to old systems can be a NO GO w/o added attention or expense. http://www.google.com/search?q=HDMI+to+VGA tada -----Willy
