I've tried looking for myself, but it's imposible to find anything in the jungle of close to similar names. I liked the P5KPL, but there are about 20.000 of them and I alwasy end up with a micro atx or 4 gig max or no cf option. All in all I hope to take advantage of all the ppl in here that know these boards and hopefully you can help.
