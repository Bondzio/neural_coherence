<s> This probably is a dummy question, but I'm very new to wireless usage, so maybe someone can provide the info I need. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any information. </s>
<s> I live in the south. </s>
<s> There is a church near my house which has a school as a part of its operation. </s>
<s> Last year I bought a laptop equipped with the hardware necessary for wireless connections. </s>
<s> For a few months I got a message on firing up the laptop that a wireless connection had been detected. </s>
<s> I don't know if it was the church's connection or not, although I suspected it was because it was the largest quasi-business use nearby. </s>
<s> I figured it probably was and didn't try connecting, and several months ago, I stopped getting the message. </s>
<s> Early this year the local mullet wrapper printed a story about the county's looking into providing a county-wide wireless system for the general public. </s>
<s> In the meantime, the local library system has established wireless servers (? </s>
<s> )at each of its branches; yesterday I went to one of the branches and finally learned how to actually use a wireless connection. </s>
<s> This morning, before I left for the library branch that I used yesterday, I decided to use my dialup connection at home. </s>
<s> After the laptop warmed up, I got the &quot;wireless connection detected&quot; message. </s>
<s> So, I connected and am nowing using it; it is about as fast as a DSL connection. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the connection I'm using is, in fact, the county library's system and that the coverage of the system is a lot wider than they've let on publicly? </s>
<s> In other words that I don't need to go to the branches? </s>
<s> The only thing that makes me think this isn't correct is that a lady at the library who was also using her laptop said that a certain spot in that branch did not have as good a connection as where we were. </s>
<s> Bump </s>
<s> A typical wireless connection is good for approx. </s>
<s> 100 ft. indoors and 300 ft. outdoors, depending on the location of the router. </s>
<s> There are ways of course to boost this, but to the best of my knowledge, 1000 ft. would be the best you could ever achieve in a &quot;perfect&quot; world. </s>
<s> So, not knowing how close you are/were to each of the wireless signals you describe, it is difficult to answer your question completely. </s>
<s> There are several cities in the US that have &quot;city-wide&quot; coverage of a broadband connection, but even there, certain areas cannot connect, and these use a totally different transmission than your typical wireless router. </s>
<s> The wireless connection disappeared around noon yesterday, so I thought I'd go to one of the library branches to use their wireless. </s>
<s> Five hair-pulling hours later, I still could not connect to it, even though there were people with laptops all around me connecting without a problem. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the library workers cannot help, even though they offer wireless use to the public. </s>
<s> They claim they cannot afford the bucks to hire help people who are comptetent to help people use technology they provide!! </s>
<s> I suppose they're telling the truth but it is infuriating, to say the least... </s>
<s> Another thing: I was able to connect to the county's wireless on Monday afternoon with only one minor glitch. </s>
<s> That glitch was that my machine didn't automatically detect the wireless system when I fired it up, but I soon found it by hitting the &quot;Connect to:&quot; button on the Start button. </s>
<s> It then performed a search for wireless connections and found the library system. </s>
<s> So why in hell couldn't it find it yesterday when I was trying from the same exact spot in the library I used on Monday? </s>
