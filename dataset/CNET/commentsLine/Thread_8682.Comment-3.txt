thanks - do you mean that i should purchase the pc w/o the drives?
and then what - add them myself?
i may be mistaken - but doesn't that void the warranty?
and though i used to try and do this stuff myself, these days i'd rather not - too busy.
so i'd still have to carry it off somewhere.
so given my preferences...would it still be better to add the drives later?
and can you explain what a &quot;all format dvd+/- r/w&quot; is actually?
i had read that eventually cd-specific drives are going to go away and the dvd drives will handle both applications.
is this what you are referring to?
