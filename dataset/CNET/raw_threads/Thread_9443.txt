My home ADSL+ is connected via a Thomson Gateway TG782T router/modem, and our wireless laptops access the 'net through this. I have a Netgear DG834G wireless router/modem in another room that has an XBox 360 connected to it via a network cable. My problem is that I want the 2 modems to be able to talk to eachother, so I can access the 'net on the XBox 360, like this: XB0x 360 - DG834G - TG782T - Net I've added the TG782T's MAC address to the Netgear's 'allowed devices' list, but don't know if I need to do add the Netgear MAC address to the Thomson modem's list of devices. Both are using the same kind of encryption. If anyone can throw some light on this thread, feel free!! Cheers, all!

To get a 2 routers to talk to each other you must set one to client mode or bridge mode. Although more routers are starting to have this feature it is not common. Check your router to see if it has this feature but they still tend to be tricky to setup because of the security. There are devices made to do this called wireless adapters or wireless extenders but those terms are used fairly loosely.
