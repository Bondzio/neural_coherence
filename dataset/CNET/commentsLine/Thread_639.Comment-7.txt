well it shipped with win95 & win3.1 drivers.
my guess is 1997 date of manufacture.
it was a win95 system when i got it(donated as a pen2, later learned it was a pen mmx).
i put in a used drive, just to see if the system worked at all.
5 years later, fix or part out time.
so im rebuilding it as retro system.
i couldnt get a stable system with the additional drive in the location i wanted.
i pulled the drives out i found a black jumper (not visible while drive was in computer) as well as the white jumper i installed to set the drive to master.
i decided to use the 80 wire cable because i wanted to see if it would work.
i pulled the jumper off and re-installed the drives using the 80 wire ide cable.
the drives are working fine now and seem quieter.
the system is stable.
as to the use of win98se, i cant install me because the cpu is below 250 mhz.
i have a linux live cd i will try, but if you can think of another os please feel free to post.
