i have a samsung 24&quot; widescreen monitor and i know the native resolution is 1920x1080.
i also am aware that this equates to a 16x9.
i want to change the resolution because i cant see 1920x1080 that well.
out of all the optional resolutions, the only other one that equates to a 16x9 is 1360x768.
when i change the display to that resolution everything on the screen gets fuzzy.
it doesn't happen with any other resolution.
any ideas?
