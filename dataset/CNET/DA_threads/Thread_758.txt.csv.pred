1.1.1	I'm currently looking for a lasting budget computer with the power and video card that has the capability to play most games without major graphics/fps problems.	St
1.1.2	Currently, the best choices I have seen were the Dell Dimension E530 and the Pavilion a1130e.	St
1.1.3	Here are the main specs for customized versions of both: Pavilion a1130e Processor: Athlon 64 3400+ (2.2GHz) Memory: 1GB DDR-400MHz SDRAM (2x512) Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce 6200SE w/TurboCache 256MB support Price: $579 Dimension E530 Processor: Intel Pentium 4 630 w/HT Technology (3.0GHz) Memory: 1GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 400MHz (4x256M) Graphics Card: 256MB PCI Express x16 (DVI/VGA/TV-out) ATI Radeon X600 SE HyperMemory Price: $671 I set other specs such as starter software and HD space/speed to the same on both systems, and I already have a moniter to use with whatever I choose, so the listed specs seem most relevant.	St
1.1.4	Does anyone have an opinion as to which system is better, or have another option in the same price range (other than building a computer)?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	but upgrade to the 3500+ as the other 2 are socket 754 chips and outdated.	St
1.3.2	ROger	St
