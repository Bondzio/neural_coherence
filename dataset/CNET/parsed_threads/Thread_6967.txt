<s> I have an old AMD processor PC, and 3 days bfore i formatted the HDD and (Tried to)reinstalled windows XP pro. </s>
<s> I set the boot sequence in the Bios setting and started installing windows. </s>
<s> After the first restart, i noticed I cannot enter the serial number coz my keyboard is not working. </s>
<s> I restarted the computer and i saw the keyboard works in the bios settings. </s>
<s> But when windows start loading the keyboard works. </s>
<s> I tried chaging the keyboard and reseting the bios settings. </s>
<s> Didnt work. </s>
<s> This system was working on WIn xP with no trouble. </s>
<s> How could this suddenly happen. </s>
<s> Am using a USB mouse and a PS2 keyboard. </s>
<s> Do u think its a hardware conflict. </s>
<s> Does anyone knows how to fix it? </s>
<s> Apreciate the help </s>
<s> Sorry nobody has helped you yet, and I don't know enough about how XP intalls to be able to help: but I suspect the problem is that the Dos bit of Windows (which will have been deleted when you formatted the HDD) means your computer has forgotten all about keyboards. </s>
<s> If you posted your query in a Windows XP bit of the forum I expect you would get a quick fix reply. </s>
