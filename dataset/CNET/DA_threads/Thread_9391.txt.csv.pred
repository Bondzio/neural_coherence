1.1.1	I think my mom's monitor is about to die, as it randomly changes colors now and then.	St
1.1.2	A white screen will take on a purple tint, then green, then white, then off-white, ec.	St
1.1.3	I've been looking on newegg for a new monitor, and I'm wondering if maybe I should give her my monitor (ViewSonic E70 - LOVE it), and get the new one for myself.	St
1.1.4	I was originally thinking flat screen CRT: ViewSonic E70F+SB Metallic on Black 17&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116254 But then, I thought about some LCDs, and thought maybe I could get one of them.	St
1.1.5	Acer AL1511 Black 15&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824009047 HP L1506 Black 15&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824176040 I know they're not the speedy-est monitors, but I don't do much gaming.	St
1.1.6	However, I do watch my DVDs on my PC.	St
1.1.7	Is 25ms too slow for watching movies?	St
1.1.8	If so, how about 16ms?	St
1.1.9	I've never owned an LCD display (unless you count my Pocket PC).	St
1.1.10	I suppose I don't really /need/ the LCD, but it would be nice.	St
1.1.11	Thoughts/comments/suggestions?	St
1.1.12	Thanks... Or even better yet, any suggestions on a different monitor that's better than the three listed above?	St
1.1.13	If it's CRT, I want flat screen if possible.	St
1.1.14	Thanks again!	St
