that some systems force us to supply the sata drivers on diskette.
next year microsoft promises to fix that but only in vista.
as to the issue of moving the os or such, that's another lacking area.
you can attempt a repair install and follow the usual steps needed to make the os install proper.
microsoft has shown no mercy in that &quot;keep my old programs&quot; issue.
there appears to be no plans for that in vista as well.
i think it's an antipiracy ploy.
