I too faced this issue and discovered that the Seagate Barracuda drives offer a 5 year warranty (parts/labor) whereas all others only offered 3 years max.
This becomes a great indictor of dependability for the drives.
At less than $100.00 for a 500GB drive, add another $30.00 for a USB external case and your problem is solved.
