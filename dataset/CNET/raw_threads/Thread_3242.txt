In any case, why not simply delete the programs on your flash if you don't want to use them? Last year I bought one of those Cruze Micro flash drives with the U3 software. Simply reformatted it to wipe out the US software which was a waste of time. All flash drives can be reformatted to be &quot;plain jane.&quot;
