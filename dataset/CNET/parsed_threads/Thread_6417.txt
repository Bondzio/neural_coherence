<s> This morning my monitor just switched off, couldn't get it back on - unplugged from AC unplugged from PC - back and forth - changing cable nothing. </s>
<s> Finally I found out that if I press in the adjacent button to the TURN ON button on the panel - then both - the screen would come on. </s>
<s> I kept doing that for about 15 very long minutes. </s>
<s> It would first stay on - then it just would turn off. </s>
<s> Then I started getting weird PC problems. </s>
<s> It would go into sleep mode, couldn't turn it on, then couldn't turn it off. </s>
<s> Then it started REALLY slowing down. </s>
<s> I said that's it, I probably have either a faulty video card/controller or I've got some kind of virus. </s>
<s> I cleaned the machine 2x with AV's - one avast the other with F-Secure. </s>
<s> Both times clean. </s>
<s> Same with Malwarebytes. </s>
<s> Then I took out all the plugs and just started cleaning the whole inside - thinking maybe there's a faulty connection or a dirty socket or something. </s>
<s> Turned it on - same thing. </s>
<s> Went into MSCONFIG and had a look around - took off some services not belonging to MS or anything important. </s>
<s> Then cleaned out the systems file with Disk Clean. </s>
<s> Then cleaned out the registry with a few programs. </s>
<s> The PC is now on with the monitor - but because this is so out of the norm I want to know how I can pinpoint the problem if it's connected to the video card/controller etc. </s>
<s> I ran a diagnostics with Everest but couldn't make much of what I read there. </s>
<s> Any help - sure would be very much appreciated indeed. </s>

<s> getting the picture? </s>
