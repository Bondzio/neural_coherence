1.1.1	hello , i have a dell budget computer- dell dimension 2400 , p4 processor 2.8ghz , 256mbddr ram , 64mb intel extreme integrated graphics ( boo-hoo ! )	St
1.1.2	and 40gig HD .	St
1.1.3	Now obviously this comp can not play any good games but i really want to play hl2 plus i 've already bought it so my question is ; how would i upgrade my current pc to get it up to scratch to play hl2 ?	Ques
1.1.4	i 'm currently averaging 26FPS on CS : source and the graphics look terrible !	St
1.1.5	Considering i do n't have an agp slot it looks like it will have to be a pci graphics card .	St
1.1.6	i was thinking of perhaps getting this one : http : //www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E2Y7E/kelkoo-2004-ce-21/ref % 3Dnosim/202-5714631-6101410 Would this card give me much of a performancew boost ?	Ques
1.1.7	is it worth it ?	Ques
1.1.8	thanks for the help guys .	Polite
1.2.1	The FX5200 is a good step up from your onboard video , but the reality is that it 's the lowest entry point ( or the MX400/4000 ) and you may still be unhappy .	St
1.2.2	I lucked out and found a 99USD FX5700 256MB card and from what I see here , that may be the bottom of what you 'll want for Half-Life 2 , Doom 3 and such .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
