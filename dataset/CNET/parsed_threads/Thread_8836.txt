<s> ok i want to build a new puter but dont know everything i need to do it. </s>
<s> can someone give me a list of parts and software for a good media center and gaming pc with tv tuner. </s>
<s> for parts totalling 1000-1500 dollars -blazerdude20@yahoo.com </s>
<s> If you want to build a computer you better take the time and effort to learn what is needed to accomplish the task. </s>
<s> The research is part of the process. </s>
<s> A couple of very good magazines to buy are MaximumPC & CPU. </s>
<s> Here are the basic parts you are going to need: Case Motherboard CPU GPU (optional, but highly recommended) Sound Card (optional) HDD Optical Drives PSU And the peripherals including mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, etc. </s>
<s> Much can be bought for that much. </s>
<s> Ok, to explaining. </s>
<s> Case is simple: It is what your PC is inside. </s>
<s> Gamers want flashy, MC's want simple, yet elegant. </s>
<s> Look toward Thermaltake.Motherboard is what I like to call the skeleton of the computer. </s>
<s> Everything is connected to it: CD, HDD, PSU, GPU, CPU, Sound, everything. </s>
<s> Look for ASUS. </s>
<s> CPU is what I call the brains. </s>
<s> A long myth of computers was the the higher the &quot;clock&quot; speed of a CPU the faster. </s>
<s> Clock is how many cycles it can perform. </s>
<s> For example, a 2.8Ghz can perform 2,800 cycles. </s>
<s> There are two companies that are worth a look, and in total accumlate about 90% of all comptuters in the world, minus Macs. </s>
<s> (But not for long! </s>
<s> http://news.cbsi.com/Apple+to+ditch+IBM,+switch+to+Intel+chips/2100-1006_3-5731398.html ) The two companies are: The world famous and major CPU maker: Intel and a newer company AMD. </s>
<s> Intel is a majority, but IMHO is going to lose the overall fight. </s>
<s> Intel has faster clock speeds, but AMD is just better. </s>
<s> AMD can do more with less. </s>
<s> Go with AMD! </s>
<s> Recently, there has been much talk of Dual Core. </s>
<s> Two cpus. </s>
<s> Wait in Januray, then look for some measures of speed (benchmarks). </s>
<s> Get the AMD X2 series. </s>
<s> Literally beats Intel, kind of caught Intel with their pants down. </s>
<s> Now to may favorite part. </s>
<s> You got your GPUS! </s>
<s> Two companies, again, Nvidia and ATI. </s>
<s> Nvidia, right now, is faster. </s>
<s> This GPU thing is a cat and mouse game. </s>
<s> One is faster today, tommorow is the other, so on and so on. </s>
<s> Right now its Nvidia's Turn. </s>
<s> Go with SLi of two 7800 GTs. </s>
<s> Getting tired, so my explaintations may get weaker. </s>
<s> Sound card: Simple. </s>
<s> For sound. </s>
<s> Get X-Fi. </s>
<s> Cheapest will be fine.HDD: Big: 300GB minimum.Optical: DL DVD Burner.PSU: Antec minimum 550W. </s>
<s> I going to assume you understood very little of this if your new, but then again I may underestimate you. </s>
<s> Respond back for questions. </s>

<s> whats a psu? </s>
<s> Its the main power house for the PC... </s>
<s> im gonna go to fry's and get pricing </s>
<s> media center pc...for around $1000 then upgrade the psu and add in a good card. </s>
<s> hp and gateway both got dual core computers, with tv tuner for around $1000. </s>
<s> suggest upgrading to 6600 after that for $100. </s>
<s> go higher if u want. </s>
<s> 6800gs....7800gtx.... </s>
<s> contact a local system builder and work with them because you will get a much better computer system and best of all it will be more upgradable and expandable for future growth unlike the big name computers and ones you buy in stores. </s>
<s> For 1000-1500 you can get an awesome system.. i just priced a system for a customer with an AMD 64 4000+, 1gig ram, 80 gigHD(he didn't want anything bigger), DVD burner,Geforce 7800GTX video with 256 meg, all built on an ASUS motherboard and it came to $1399. </s>
<s> That's with Windows XP Pro w/service pack 2 installed.. so for 1000-1500 you can get a nice system. </s>

<s> I had a guy to go to for a local machine. </s>
<s> All i get is this one guy, and is a complete rip off. </s>
<s> Before I knew alot about computers, I paid a very very large sum of $300 for some Corsair Value 1GB Ram. </s>
