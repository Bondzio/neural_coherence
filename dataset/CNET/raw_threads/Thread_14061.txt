I'm trying to build a different sub network using an adsl router/modem left from my old ISP. (a Sagem F@st 2604 ) I first connected the old adsl router with my new ISP gateway (a Thomson TG784n) on the same net 192.168.1.0/24 with a ethernet cable (NOT cross-over) connecting numbered Ethernet ports, (DHCP and wi-fi off) and all went ok (1). Now I'm trying to put my PC and the old sagem F@st 2604 on the 192.168.10.0/24 network , but I really don't know how to configure the different Ethernet ports in the sagem modem/router, I fear that I wont be able to configure the Sagem to behave as a switch(2). (1) I don't know how this worked, but it did. Can you give any light on this subject? (2) Is it possible to configure the sagem F@st 2604 to behave as a switch?

Remember that I tend to use the networking lingo so when you ask me about a switch, I'll include the non-switched hub as well unless you write more. When we use these DSL modems for the switch, we would never use the WAN port. That's a given. Bob

The only way that can access the internet is keeping my PC Ethernet port in the 192.168.1.0/24 sub-net. I don't know if this is a windows miss configuration or a bad router configuration. My words and explanations, sometimes, may be lacking precision, that is because I'm just starting in the network field (studying) . For example, I'm having a hard time to understand was does the option &quot;Enable Ethernet M2U &quot; Best regards Vasco
