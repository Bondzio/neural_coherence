1.1.1	Hello , I have a Linksys WRT54GL v. 1.1 that has been dropping connection speed ( starts at 54mb , then drops to 48mbs , 36mbs , 28mbs , down to 1mbs ) then disconnects , then reconnects at 54 mbs .	St
1.1.2	After a short while , it will drop the speed again until it disconnects and reconnects again .	St
1.1.3	This is the third Linksys WRT54GL that has done this .	St
1.1.4	The first one was 5 years old before it started doing this in February , the second was 3 months old , and now the replacement Linksys sent to me is doing this ?	Ques
1.1.5	Does anyone know what is going on with my router ?	Ques
1.1.6	I am able to connect fine with the Cat5 cable , but wireless seems to be the problem .	St
1.1.7	Even my phone ( s ) get disconnected from the wireless router .	St
1.1.8	This problem just recently started and I do n't know why , no settings had been changed on any of the routers until after the problem had already ocurred , then the Linksys phone tech support had me make multiple changes .	St
1.2.1	That is how wireless works .	St
1.2.2	If it gets too many errors at a certain speed it will continue to reduce the speed until it gets one that works .	St
1.2.3	Errors are generally caused by interference .	St
1.2.4	You many times will still see good signal strength since that does not measure the quality .	St
1.2.5	You best option is to change the channel until you find one that is more stable .	St
1.2.6	Finding the source of the interference is tough .	St
1.2.7	It ranges from microwave ovens to the neighbors routers .	St
1.2.8	I would next try a different nic on your PC since it might be that end causing the issue .	St
1.2.9	Last you could try to replace all your equipment ( router and nics ) with stuff that supports 802.11n .	Sug
1.2.10	N is more tolerant of interference than G. Your other option is to buy dual band equipment and move to the 5G band .	St
1.3.1	While changing the channel is a great idea , if WEP is noted or if someone is trying MAC filters , those old security are now ineffective .	St
1.3.2	Time to move up to WPA2 if possible .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	What is & quot ; nic & quot ; in reference to my PC and your post ?	Ques
1.4.2	I know that when I search for wireless connections around my house , I pick up approximately 5 different ones !	St
1.4.3	I 'll try switching channels to see if this helps .	St
1.5.1	network interface controller .	St
1.5.2	For laptop the wireless nic is built in for desktops it is mostly a USB device .	St
1.5.3	The USB wireless nic work on both laptop and desktop .	St
1.5.4	Since you have already replaced the router it is unlikely a hardware issue .	St
1.5.5	It is also very unlikely it is a hardware issue with your nic card but it is the cheapest thing to try next .	St
1.5.6	When you start replacing hardware it generally means you have tried everything else .	St
1.6.1	If it 's an Internet connection then you are sharing that connection with others ( contrary to whatever any company tells you ) .	St
1.6.2	This is true for cable , DSL , Fios , satellite .	St
1.6.3	The more people in the pool that you share are on , the slower your connection .	St
1.6.4	As people disconnect or their activity ceases your bandwidth increases again .	St
1.6.5	DSLreports.com has a nice speed measuring tool which works not only for DSL .	St
1.6.6	It is quite reliable .	St
1.6.7	Use that during different hours of the day .	St
