Sorry but I have to disagree with you about the wallpaper covering the icons. I think the machine has the usual malware damage. Repairs vary with the user's skill level. I see you posted in the Newbie forum so I'm guessing you don't do a lot of PC repairs. Here's an article so you can get your files out of the machine then restore the PC to its factory issued OS &quot;load&quot;. -&gt; Read http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/ This article works for XP, Vista, 7 and 8.
