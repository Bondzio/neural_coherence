Since it's new, give the maker a call to have it fixed. I wish the user profiles were working but they don't all the time so try to put details in your posts. Bob

You may need to increase the voltage in the Bios. It did the trick for me. Just make sure you are following the RAM specs and increase it slowly. Hope this helps.
