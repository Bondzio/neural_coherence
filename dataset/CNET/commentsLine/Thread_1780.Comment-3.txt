...somewhere, and indicated by when the computer did work.
a rule of thumb is : if the computer works in &quot;safe mode&quot; and not in &quot;normal&quot;, you have corrupted drivers, or missing files.
&quot;safe mode&quot; loads a minimum of these to get basic functionality going, to help you return the system to working order.
if &quot;normal&quot; mode fails when you've had a power cut, your pc has almost certainly lost a driver.
why?
well powering off, whether by accident or otherwise isn't an instant usually an instant death to hardware.
computers reset and operating systems crash all the time, without worry, so a power outage isn't any more dangerous.
however, an immediate power loss can corrupt a system file or driver.
because these are loaded and in use, they are sometimes in a continual state of flux, and shutting down unduly springs a special surprise on them!
they are then effectively corrupted as they weren't returned to a default ready status by a correct shut down sequence.
this is a simplistic explanation, and it doesn't happen, but when it does...safe mode's always the first route to recovery.
