The Compaq drive came with the PC.
It was a slow drive like the HP.
Sony 52-24-52 relpaced the Compaq drive.
Too confusing for me, but I've labeled the boxes with what drive is inside.
And now Device Manager in both laptops recognizes the HP drive, and the HP burning software works.
Cold beer time.
