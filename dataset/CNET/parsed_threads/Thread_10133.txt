<s> Hello everyone, happy new year to all... Well, not so happy to me, I lost my most important hard drive a few days ago and I need to replace the logic board. </s>
<s> These are the characteristics of the drive I need: * Hitachi Deskstar * Capacity: 80.4GB (80.0 nor 82.3 would work, it HAS to be 80.4) * Model Number: IC35L090AVV207-0 * ATA/IDE * P/N: 07N9685 * LBA: 160.836.480 sectors * RPM: 7200RPM * MLC: H69205 * CHS: 16383/16/63 * Date: FEB2003 - N155 * S/N: G3C57XKD I've looked on eBay too but it's impossible to find this type of drive there. </s>
<s> I'm really desperate and need your help. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> Yes, I saw that one but seems like although is 80.4GB the Part Number is not correct, the one I need is 07N9685 and that disk's Part Number is 08K2525. </s>
<s> This is so frustrating... </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>

<s> to do the backups ...right ? </s>

<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Yes, the P/N is the same, no doubt about that. </s>
<s> However, the capacity stated is 80GB... </s>
<s> I attribute this to the fact that they just round up the capacity for advertising purposes and don't put the EXACT capacity (80.4GB or 82.3GB) as they should. </s>
<s> So I called, talk to this guy and asked him if he could send me a picture of the product to which he said he can't because the drive is at their warehouse (somewhere). </s>
<s> Nonetheless he's going to find out the Model Number and the EXACT Capacity of the drive and send me an e-mail once he has that information... hopefully he wasn't playing with me. </s>
<s> Sigh... </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your help. </s>
<s> I fixed my drive, I replaced the PCB and it worked perfectly So the things I learned that needed to be considered when finding this new drive I were: * Brand (duh) * MLC: H69205 * P/N: 07N9685 * Model Number: IC35L090AVV207-0 * EXACT Capacity: 80.4GB (80.0 nor 82.3 would work, it HAS to be 80.4) These 5 characteristics need to match, otherwise the PCBs you use won't work. </s>
<s> Thanks to all, Zuertex </s>
<s> Would have been a whole lot easier, less stressful and saved the many many hours you spent at your labor rate had you done the BACKUPs. </s>
<s> Hoping those who read will realize you were very lucky and take action to minimize the risk of data loss or start saving to pay for expensive data recovery. </s>

<s> This forum is not about backups, is about replacing a PCB in a hard drive. </s>
<s> I did have backup but my situation was very particular and it's not relevant to the forum, so you have no idea what you are talking about. </s>
<s> If you know what to look for when you need to replace the PCB of a hard drive, you won't be lucky, you will be smart because it will always work. </s>
<s> Sigh... thanks to everyone who tried to help me </s>
<s> problem won't help one iota. </s>
<s> If you'd been so smart you'd have been able to replace the drive (from any mfg), restored an image to it and been done with it. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS .. </s>
<s> If you take a moment to look around, you'll note the FORUM is about anything folks post here . </s>

<s> not just (PC) hardware. </s>
<s> i'm probably like you vap. </s>
<s> i would have used this failure as an excuse to get a new drive (320gb for $80 with a 3 year warranty) and restored my backups to it. </s>
<s> downtime would have been maybe 2 days. </s>
<s> i hope the original poster realizes that even though the logic board's been replaced, the mtbf clock on the internal components was not reset and is still ticking. </s>
