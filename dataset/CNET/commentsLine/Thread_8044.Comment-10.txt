the original disk did not work for me.but i did get my bwa711 router to work with windows xp-pro i hard wired it to the xp system and ran a windows vista system off of it wireless.
here's how, first turn every thing off even your pc's then run a ethernet cable from your modem to the wan port on your router and if you are going to hard wire a system then run a ethernet cable from your router to that system.
then turn on your modem first and let it boot all the way up,then and only then turn on your router and let it do the same, and then turn on all the system's wireless are not on and let them recognize the router.
ps.
i had to take a tooth pick and punch the reset button on the router before it would work then every thing worked just fine.
