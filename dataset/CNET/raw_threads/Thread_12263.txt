I have a 1st generation Macbook. Every so often, usually after first turning the system on, waking from sleep, or high CPU loads; the screen brightness flickers. The screen doesn't go completely blank, it goes from bright to dim back to normal brightness over the course of 3 to 5 seconds. Unfortunately, even though this problem is widely reported on Apple's support forums, Apple does not acknowledge that this is an issue. I am on the fence as to whether or not I should call AppleCare. I don't know if this will be covered by my warranty and if not I cannot afford to have it repaired. It is becoming rather annoying. If anyone out there has had this problem, do you have any workarounds for this? Or should I call AppleCare?
