simple someone else is using the same address as you and all you know is that it is another person who is also using the same unsecured connection.
part of the reason you do not use unsecured stuff.
there is no way to really tell where the machine is your friend might be able to but you won't.
get your friend to change his dhcp server to give you a different address but someone maybe duplicating your address on purpose to steal something or maybe just to mess with you.
best solution is to have your freind turn on security and provide you with a userid and password.
