<s> Hey there I recently contracted a virus to my computer. </s>
<s> Thinking that I had managed to clean it up succesfully, I switched off the computer and went to bed, big mistake as it would seem. </s>
<s> When I came to restart the machine, an error message appeared saying: &quot;Windows could not start because of the following file is missing or corrupt: \windows\system32\config\system&quot; I tried repairing this through the windows XP cd but the cd could not find the OS to repair it. </s>
<s> I have another computer that I thought I could install the hard drive to, clean it up and use it as a slave HD. </s>
<s> When I connected it, the computer recognised that there was another HD connected but in My computer I could not open the drive, but instead I would receive a message for me to format the drive. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a soloution to this? </s>
<s> If possible I don't want to format this HD as I have some very important stuff on there. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that maybe I have done something wrong when I plugged in the HD in to the other computer, maybe I have to do something else?? </s>
<s> Any advice is will be very helpful. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> This might help determine it was a boot sector or file infection type. </s>
<s> You might want to get the driver manufacturer's utility program and do a diagnostic and full erase proceedure with that before formatting. </s>
<s> As such you might be able to rule out possible problems with the magnetic media on the platters. </s>

<s> Unfortunatly I didn't catch the name. </s>
<s> I will try finding the driver manufacturer's utility program. </s>
<s> I take it that will most probably be found on their website? </s>
<s> something like that happened to me before. </s>
<s> It wasnt nearly as serious though. </s>
<s> I just restarted my computer and it ended up working fine again. </s>
<s> But it wasn't nearly as bad. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
