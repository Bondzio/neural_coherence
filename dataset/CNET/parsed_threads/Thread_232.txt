<s> I am trying to come up with a linux machine config for data crunching purposes using C. This is my first time in building a machine. </s>
<s> I'd like to know the following: 1. </s>
<s> I dont intend to overclock the processor which is an Intel Core 2 Duo E6550 Conroe 2.33GHz 4M shared L2 Cache LGA 775 Processor. </s>
<s> It comes with a heat sink and a fan. </s>
<s> Do I still need to buy an additional processor fan for $25 (see http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16835103016 ) 2. </s>
<s> For the motherboard I am considering Intel BOXDP965LTCK LGA 775 Intel P965 Express ATX (click on the &quot;Spec&quot; tab in http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813121035 ). </s>
<s> There is a note in the spec section stating &quot;Only DDR2-800 memory supporting JEDEC approved 1.8V operation with timings of 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 is supported on Intel Desktop Boards based on Intel 965 Express Chipsets.&quot; Does this mean it will not be compatible with a 1 GB DDR2-800MHz RAM using 2.2V with 4-4-4-12 timing? </s>
<s> If not, please specify a motherboard with LGA775 socket/Intel Core 2 Duo support/4MB L2 cache/FSB=&gt;1066MHz configuration. </s>
<s> The other parts of the machine are: 1. </s>
<s> ATX tower 2. </s>
<s> PSU: 550W, and three 12 V rails. </s>
<s> Is this an overkill for my config? </s>
<s> ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16817371002 ) 3. </s>
<s> 250G SATA hard drive 4. </s>
<s> SATA DVD burner 5. </s>
<s> Additional 1 GB RAM (cumulative RAM = 2GB) Apart from the peripheral components (monitor, keyboard, mouse), am I missing anything? </s>
<s> (Don't require video/sound cards). </s>
<s> The total cost for the machine is roughly $700. </s>
<s> Please suggest. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The memory sockets support a range of voltages but let's knock it down to a few sentences. </s>
<s> Many pages note the 1.8v because it's the latest and greatest but support for the older 2.x volt sticks is still on the board. </s>
<s> What this means however is you can't mix and match memory sticks. </s>
<s> Use the same technology in all sockets unless your motherboard manual states you can mix. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm using the stock Intel HSF and it seems quite nice. </s>
<s> Thanks for the response on HSF and RAM. </s>
<s> Since I am not using any video cards, is the PSU (550W, three 12 V rails) an overkill for the configuration? </s>
<s> If yes, is there a way to determine the minimum power supply required to support the machine? </s>
<s> (Assume no external devices attached to the tower except keyboard, mouse) </s>
