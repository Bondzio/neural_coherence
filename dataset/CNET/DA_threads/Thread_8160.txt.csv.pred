1.4.1	When you install programs most offer a choice of where to install.	St
1.4.2	But USB drives are not too quick compared to internals.	St
1.4.3	Nice place for a backup copy but not a true backup.	St
1.4.4	Think of USB drives as extended but a little slower storage space.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	How difficult is it to install an internal drive?	St
1.5.2	Would this solve my problem?	St
1.6.1	The owner may not want to investigate this.	St
1.6.2	I can't because you are not following the guidelines in our forum note.	St
1.6.3	Those words in red are there so I don't have to ask for that detail.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	I don't understand?	St
1.8.1	Much about the USB or the host machine.	St
1.8.2	Given only the details you elected to share so far all I can note is that you can't be given more than a generic answer because the details are not in your posts.	St
1.8.3	I don't ask for such since that is asked for every time you make a post.	St
1.8.4	That is, &quot;the words in red.&quot;	St

1.9.5	What other info do you need?	Sug
1.9.6	The external hard drive is WD passport 250 kb, usb 2.	St
1.10.1	Such decals like Dell, Compaq, etc and a model number.	St
1.10.2	Same for the drive.	St
1.10.3	Those came with either sata or ide drives so the exact model number is called for.	St
1.10.4	If these can't be found then it's a trip to a service counter to get it done.	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
