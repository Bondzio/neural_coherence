After researching I found on this site, a link I followed that I think (I can't really remember) I downloaded something wich located this new drive. I just moved my room around, unplugging everything, and now I again, can't locate my drive. I don't want to reformat it b/c I have everything saved on it. Can anyone help me locate it again? Thanks - Al

I hooked the Maxtor up to my Dell laptop, copied that archive, then hooked it up to my Desktop. I am running XP-Pro on a Pentium with C: drive and 2 DVD drives (D: and E:). The system found it and labelled it as F: ..so far, so good... Created an archive directory, copied 4 folders, then had to wander off. When restarted, the desktop can no longer find Drive F:, the Maxtor. ..bummer!... Oh yeah, if I power up with the Maxtor attached to a USB port, the system hangs in POST..double bummer!!... Have you TOO been thinking about getting an archival portable drive..?

In the Universal Serial Bus connection section, look for the Intel 82801 chipset. If you have this chipset, you will have communication issues with the PS 3100. There is a hardware conflict with this particular chipset and the PS 3100. There are two possible solutions to this problem. You may purchase a USB cardbus adapter card, install it and connect the drive through that USB connection and the drive will work fine. The alternative would be to replace the drive with any other Maxtor drive model other than the PS 3100.
