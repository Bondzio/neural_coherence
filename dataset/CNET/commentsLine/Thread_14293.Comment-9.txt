and not just a network attached storage drive?
why waste an xp license and a good piece of hardware if you just want access to files in shares.
a nas that supports windows smb will do that quite well.
remote administration is a minimal chore.
you need to turn it on/off, create/delete shares, add/remove users and do backups...not much more.
they don't need much in the way of resources and can be quite small.
