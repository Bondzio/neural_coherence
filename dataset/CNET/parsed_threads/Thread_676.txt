<s> How do you back up your personal data? </s>
<s> -- Additional internal hard drive -- External hard drive -- Memory card -- Network-attached storage device -- Online backup service -- Optical disc -- Tape -- USB thumb drive -- Others (What is it?) </s>
<s> -- What backup? </s>
<s> (Oh boy!) </s>
<s> We use have our information backed up three ways- Internel Storage A NAS External HDD (Some is also on DVD which would mean we use four, but since not all of it is on DVD I did not include it.) </s>
<s> Preference will be as follows, - Online Backup - Remote Backup - Network-attached storage device - External hard drive - Additional internal hard drive </s>
<s> All super critical data is saved on discs, like CD/DVD and flash drives. </s>
<s> No other method is used for my needs. </s>
<s> There are multiple copies and usually the amount of data is greatly reduced to the current needs, rather than a prolonged storage overs yrs. </s>
<s> as example. </s>
<s> I do however, like the fact, that once I upgrade to a new HD, I keep the old HD &quot;as is&quot; for several months not only as a safe return if something happens on new HD install but as a back-up version as well. </s>
<s> Once safe and sound, that old HD gets re-used. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Use Acronis - Home Backup - Scheduled Daily to backup personal stuff (incremental) to a local 2nd drive. </s>
<s> - Every week or two I do a full Image Backup, using same software Acronis. </s>
<s> Very easy to use. </s>
<s> Never done a restore, but there is a restore dvd that I created and should work fine :-/ Restoring a file from backups is just toooo easy. </s>
<s> Just dive into the backup file, and browse round to the dated version that you want. </s>
<s> I use SyncBack frequently to backup my data to an external HD and also to transfer my work between computers. </s>
<s> But I am told I should also make a system image so I just bought some DVDs to record one on. </s>
<s> Might also try a data backup to CD or DVD. </s>
<s> I found out my complete image backup would take up 15 DVDs or 700 floppies, so an external HD is more practical. </s>
