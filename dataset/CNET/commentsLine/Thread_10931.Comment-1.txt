on an old computer of mine the c:drive is only around 13 gb and i'm running low on storage space, so i was trying to free up some space.
that's when i noticed a big difference in the size and size on disk of a few major folders.
windows: size - 4.89 gb , size on disk - 3.64 gb program files: size - 2.12 gb, size on disk - 1.83 gb is there anyway i can play around with this and free up some space by defragmenting the drive or something along that line, or is this simply the way file storage works?
(in the windows folder alone, there's a 1.25 gig difference between the two; and before anyone brings it up, yes i'll eventually replace it with a much bigger hard drive)
