HI, I;m looking at building my own system.
this is the question i had.
is the XFX GeForce 8400 GS (with 512 ram) good?
I would be using this with a Asus M2N-E SLI.
here's a link to where I was going to buy it.
thanks, http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3324267&CatId=1826
