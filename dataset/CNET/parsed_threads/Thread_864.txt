<s> I am looking at E-Readers, for my mother for mother's day. </s>
<s> Price is not an issue. </s>
<s> What E-Reader would you recomend and why? </s>
<s> Quite simply Amazon's ebook pricing is quite the saver. </s>
<s> I have the Nook Color and prices are quite a lot higher. </s>
<s> After playing with the Nook Color I decided as a BN Nook I wasn't going to get much use from it. </s>
<s> I went to http://mrm3.net/nook-color-how-to-gingerbread-guide/ and turned it into an Android tablet. </s>
<s> I installed Amazon's Kindle reader than thought &quot;This Nook Color is a very nice Kindle Reader.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Look into the Kindle Fire as a possible choice. </s>
<s> $200 bucks to get her a e-reader (in color) that also can also play movies, games, etc. </s>
<s> Kindle Fire is the next best thing to the iPad and it brings the price down $299. </s>
<s> But, just read your &quot;price is not an issue&quot; again.... so you may want to just up for the iPad if you got the cash. </s>
