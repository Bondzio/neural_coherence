i'd like to upgrade my sony pcv-rx650, which currently has the original 80gb ata/100 hd and 512mb ram(though i'm upgrading memory as well).
i'd like to add a second internal hard drive of 200-250 gb capacity, if possible.
what, if any issues might i have?
from what i understand, ata/100 or ata/133 doesn't really matter.
i see some of the drives (maxtor ultra 7200 series) require and additional pci card slot.
what are the benefits/negatives versus a drive that doesn't require an additional card slot?
all slots are currently occupied, unless i remove the fax/telephony card which isn't used anyway.
any suggestions on drives/brands?
thanks!
