Recently my monitor started to get blurry adjusted the setting but nothing seems to help. Is there anyway to get it back to the default setting, thinking that it may be the setting that are wrong? Does anybody have an idea of what it might be? Or is it just a bad monitor? Thanks for any help I get!!!

If the other moinitor is still fuzzy than it's either your motherboard or a video card (if it has one). Good Luck! and life goes on... Jack

Maybe degausing it will work, Need a shop for that. They are pretty cheap (of the CRT type). Flat panels now close to $150. Good Luck. and life goes on... Jack
