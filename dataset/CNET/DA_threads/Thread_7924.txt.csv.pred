1.1.1	I am going to be building/buying a USB external hard drive .	St
1.1.2	I have read reviews online that were full of horror stories of such drives failing after 2 weeks on intermittent use , and other equally disturbing problems .	St
1.1.3	My question is what brands of USB HDDs or USB HDD enclosures are the most reliable ?	Ques
1.1.4	I dont really care if I build it myself or buy it pre-made ; I just want the thing to be as reliable as possible .	St
1.1.5	Thank you for any help you can provide .	St
1.2.1	These are external and portable .	St
1.2.2	But , you should not move them while in operation .	St
1.2.3	I must suspect lots of failures are due to folks handling the drive and moving it around while it 's spinning .	St
1.2.4	That being said , if you put together your own , the drive should be as reliable as is you put it in your case .	St
1.2.5	My drives are all Western Digital and Seagate models currently .	St
1.2.6	My external enclosures are branded bytech or something similar .	St
1.2.7	They are basic aluminum with external power supplies and worked right out of the box .	St
1.3.1	Thats good advice .	Polite
1.3.2	Youre probably right about most problems being caused by moving it while in operation .	St
1.3.3	When I was reading reviews , some people mentioned that their units were quite hot .	St
1.3.4	Could the heat also be part of the problem ?	Ques
1.3.5	In your experience , does the drive get too hot ?	Ques
1.3.6	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	I have three of them .	St
1.4.2	These are slightly warm to the touch .	St
1.4.3	Because the cases are aluminum and not plastic , they should conduct heat better .	St
1.4.4	They are not vented or have a fan .	St
1.4.5	Some feature cooling fins or a fan .	St
1.4.6	My reading is that these fans are often a weakness ... .cheaply made ... and I can believe it .	St
1.4.7	My drives feel no warmer than the ones in my case and maybe a bit cooler .	St
1.4.8	The only problem I needed to deal with is that one drive is a little slower to spin up than the rest .	St
1.4.9	It would not always show up in Windows when starting the PC .	St
1.4.10	This was corrected by a BIOS setting which allowed some extra detection time .	St
1.4.11	Hope that helps .	St
1.5.1	This helps a lot .	St
1.5.2	Thank you again .	St
1.6.1	Hi , I , too , read many horror stories about external USB hard drives .	St
1.6.2	I also agree with Steve that many of the issues were probably user-created , like treating a drive that is n't intended for portability as a portable drive .	St
1.6.3	For the last 6 months or so , I 've used a 120GB & quot ; Diskgo & quot ; HDD manufactured by Edge Tech Corporation ( http : //www.edgetechcorp.com/ ) .	St
1.6.4	I 've got almost 50GB of MP3 files stored on the drive .	St
1.6.5	To this point ( knocking on wood here ) I 've had no issues with the drive and find myself very happy with it .	St
1.6.6	Read/write speed is good and the drive has exhibited great reliability to this point .	St
1.6.7	The cost of the drive , especially when coupled with a manufacturer 's rebate , was quite reasonable .	St
1.6.8	Hope this helps !	St
1.7.1	I have been using a Maxtor for about a year .	St
1.7.2	The prices have continued to drop , and the units are very durable .	St
1.7.3	I store video and pictures on the unit that are either being work on or being preped for more permanent storage .	St
1.7.4	The unit has been outstanding .	St
1.7.5	Write speeds are reasonable , and extra storage is great .	St
1.7.6	One important issue is stop the drive before you turn it off .	St
1.7.7	Easy to remember on a notebook , but you need to remember to do it also with a desktop .	St
1.8.1	I 've been using the 300GB Maxtor One Touch II and , so far , I 've had no problems with it .	St
1.8.2	There were some detection problems in the beginning , but I now turn it on while the computer is booting and turn it off after computer shut down .	St
1.8.3	The aluminum case does feel warm to the touch .	St
1.8.4	I keep it stationary while it is in use .	St
1.8.5	I am planning on getting a new computer soon , and I think this will be a great way to move my files onto the new computer .	St
1.8.6	With all this space , I no longer have any excuse to not backup my computer .	St
1.8.7	I 've read some of the horror reviews about this drive , but I just have n't had any problems yet .	St
1.8.8	I hope I did n't just jinx myself ...	St
1.9.1	I also have the Maxtor One Touch in the aluminum case ( 120 GB I think , I forget which specific model ) and so far ( ~9 months ) I 've had no problems .	St
1.9.2	It definitely does not run hot , but I only use it for backing up my laptop .	St
1.9.3	I also have an older Maxtor 40 GB ( one of the translucent red & white plastic models ) on an old desktop machine and it too works fine ( I forget how long , but at least two years ) .	St
1.9.4	Now I 'm thinking of getting an Iomega Silver Edition , 80GB for my daughter to use to back up her laptop at college .	St
1.9.5	Has anyone had experience with this drive ?	Ques
1.9.6	Since this is the storage forum , let me put my .02 in by saying I was really disappointed when Imation discontinued the LS120 Superdrive .	St
1.9.7	If anyone has an external LS120 drive they are not using , please let me know .	St
1.10.1	Does anyone know what chipsets to look for that allow for a bootable USB drive ?	Ques
1.10.2	My understanding is there are USB drives that show up as a removable drive and can also be used as a boot drive .	St
1.10.3	Just because it 's a USB drive does n't mean it can do both ?	Ques
1.10.4	Am I correct ?	Ques
1.10.5	Thanks !	St
1.10.6	Thought this would fit in this topic as well ?	Ques
1.11.1	I run multiple usb hdd on my system i have 3 units pluged in as we do a lot of mpg files and find this to be a good backup system i have 1x 160gb and 2x 200 gb units on one machine all assigned as drives then when needed i just reassign the appropriate drive to the letter that the software is looking for it	St
1.12.1	i have been using a maxtor external hdd ( 80Gig ) on usb/firewire for a number of years now and it has yet to let me down .	St
1.12.2	performance is solid and reliable .	St
1.12.3	I also use a lesser known brand which DID fail after about 2 years .	St
1.13.1	QUESTION ON ext hd care , u should n't move it while it 's transferring data ... . the ext hd should also be set as flat as possible right , or does that not really play a big of a role in operation failures ( e.g .	St
1.13.2	parot of it is lying ontop of a coaster or small book so it 's angled ) As far as reliability , there 's some faith in addition to a good brand .	St
1.13.3	Maxtor IDE hds are supposed to be among the top .	St
1.13.4	My roomate installed a new one , moved ( not copied ) some stuff over .	St
1.13.5	It crashed shortly ! !	St
1.13.6	and this was a brand new hd ! !	St
1.13.7	He lost all the stuff he moved , luckily none of which was important .	St
1.13.8	He called Maxtor , they sent him a free replacement , and it 's been working fine for years now .	St
1.14.1	I hope this wo n't jinx me too !	St
1.14.2	I have only been using mine for about 6 weeks to back up my new Dell having passed on my 5 year old Dell to my husband ( so girls that is the way to do it !	St
1.14.3	Mine was a special present . )	St
1.14.4	My Maxtor came with Dantz Retrospect Express software for backups .	St
1.14.5	So far everything is working fine here in the UK , but I would like a bit more flexibility than I am getting with Dantz .	St
1.14.6	Can someone tell me it it is o.k .	St
1.14.7	to use one of the other BackUp software programmes around , and if so I would be grateful to know which ones work best with Maxtor One Touch which I find is a neat way to have an external hard drive .	St
1.14.8	I woud not dream of moving it around while it is working ... no wonder people have problems .	St
1.15.1	I have tried a few backup programs and have a strong preference for Genie Backup Manager by Genie-Soft ... You will not find a program with more features and flexibility and wonderful scheduled backup features and it is so easy to use ... I backup to my external USB 250 GB Western Digital HD weekly while I sleep ... I sometimes forget that the backups are even being performed but it is there just in case ... .	St
1.16.1	I have a Buslink USB 2.0 40 gig drive that has been running continuously for about 2 years with no problems .	St
1.16.2	It 's even fast enough to run applicatations .	St
1.16.3	I also have a Maxtor OneTouch 160 gig USB 2.0 drive that has been flawless , and is fast and reliable .	St
1.16.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.16.5	Dave Moffatt	St
1.17.1	You should avoid moving a hard drive while spinning whether transferring data or not .	St
1.17.2	Think of the drive as a gyroscope .	St
1.17.3	It resists certain movements not within the plane of the spinning platters .	St
1.17.4	This force can cause some physical distortion or increased bearing load .	St
1.17.5	How much the drive can tolerate is probably nothing you want to test if you are interested in preserving data on it or keeping it a long time .	St
1.18.1	I see the Genie software getting a recommendation .	St
1.18.2	Has anybody tried AIS backup ?	Ques
1.18.3	I and friends have been using this for a long time before external hard drives took off .	St
1.18.4	AIS can cope with internal , external and CD backups .	St
1.18.5	In Setup you can nominate any type of backup .	St
1.19.1	The rule of thumb with all HDD is to make sure they remain in the same orientation ( e.g .	St
1.19.2	vertical , horizontal ) as the drive was when first formatted .	St
1.20.1	Ive never heard that before .	St
1.20.2	Do you know why this is the case ?	Ques
1.21.1	The story I heard was more about older style 5 1/4 drives .	St
1.21.2	We called them ''Winchesters '' .	St
1.21.3	With these you did low and high level formatting during which you adjusted the & quot ; interleave & quot ; factor which was the number of disk rotations between read/write operations which allowed time for the heads to move into proper position .	St
1.21.4	1 to 3 interleaving was common with early drives .	St
1.21.5	These were heavier units and the logic was that gravity had an affect on components ... especially the heads .	St
1.21.6	It was said that these could sag and tracking could change when turned 90 degrees .	St
1.21.7	Thus , with these drives , you compensated by performing low and high level formatting in the position the drive would be running .	St
1.21.8	With IDE drives , you no longer low level format at end user level and I have heard/read that changing the orientation of the drive is not the issue it once was .	St
1.21.9	However , I still format a drive after installing it permanently just as a habit .	St
1.22.1	Another good manufacturer is LaCie .	Polite
1.22.2	They make complete units from 74GB up to 2TB .	St
1.22.3	I 've been using the 74GB d2 at work for storage and imaging iMacs and Mac Minis .	St
1.22.4	This drive has been under heavy use and stress for the past 2 years without any problems .	St
