help!
suddenly, for some reason, my two lenovo laptops last week (one is windows xp and one is windows 7) couldn't find any wireless networks.
when i click on &quot;view wireless networks&quot; all that comes up is the iban computer to computer network.
i know the wireless network router is working as i can connect to it with my non 3g ipad.
i also took both computers to work and couldn't connect to an open wireless router there.
i am puzzled as to how to even begin troubleshooting.
