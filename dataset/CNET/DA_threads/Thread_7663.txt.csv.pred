1.1.1	I have had a Dell Inspiron 1300 notebook for almost a year which I primarily use to surf the web and send and receive emails .	St
1.1.2	A few days ago I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and installed it on the notebook .	St
1.1.3	At the end of the day when I close out my Quicken I 'm prompted to back up my data .	St
1.1.4	I have n't backed it up yet but would like to do so .	St
1.1.5	On an old desktop PC I used floppies to back up my Quicken data .	St
1.1.6	This Dell notebook does n't have a floppy drive but I could buy an external floppy drive to use to back up the Quicken data but are there other ways available to back up the data ?	Ques
1.1.7	Easier ; less expensive ways to back up the data ?	Ques

1.5.1	Hi -searched the forum and found your old question regarding Quicken 2007 !	St
1.5.2	How did you make out with that ?	Ques
1.5.3	I have XP so needless to say , I have learned the hard way , that simply backing up on a CD like we did in the 'old ' days , by selecting A Drive and backing up on a floppy just is n't possible !	St
1.5.4	According to Microsoft , in order for Quicken to write a back up file directly to the CD-R or CD-RW , the compact disc must first be formatted and support 'packet writing ' .	St
1.5.5	The Windows XP CD recording program does not support packet writing and does not contain a feature to format a recordable CD .	St
1.5.6	So , I have an external hard drive backing it up but I still long for a way to format the re-writable CD 's .	St
1.5.7	I know some people are using a staging area saving method which , again , is just too complicated .	St
1.5.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.5.9	Thanks , Archer ... ..	St
