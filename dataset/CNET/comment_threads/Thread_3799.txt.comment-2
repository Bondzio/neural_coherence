your power supply is more than adequate.
a good 500w unit would be fine.
be aware that the p182 uses an inverted design (power supply is on the bottom) and some power supplies don't have cables long enough to reach some components.
toolwise, you shouldn't need anything other than a screwdriver.
the zalman cooler's a bit overpriced.
you can find a heat pipe cooler that's as effective and cheaper: http://www.anandtech.com/casecoolingpsus/showdoc.aspx?i=3022&p=4 unless you really want to pay full price, a q6600 ($300) can easily be overclocked to 2.8ghz or more (faster than the qx6700) especially when paired with a p35 based mobo.
(most will OC to 3ghz by simply selecting a 1333mhz fsb.)
the evga isn't a bad mobo, but if you don't expect to use sli, you can certainly get a mobo that matches or exceeds its features and performance for about $150: http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3042&p=1 msi p35 platinum: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130097 asus p5k: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131180 ocz platinum ddr2-800 has the same timings as the hyperx but has a $40 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227179 western digital's new 500gb drive is only $10 more and matches or beats the seagate 7200.10 in most benchmarks.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136073 as for raid, that's basically up to you.
i prefer intel's matrix raid (available on some of the p35 boards) since it allows you to create a mirror (raid-1, data redundancy) and a stripeset (raid-0, fast read/write speed) on just two drives.
apps that use a lot of scratch space (like cs3, maya, etc.)
can benefit from stripeset.
unless you're overclocking, i don't think any type of burn-in is necessary nowadays so long as you stick to good quality components like the one's you've spec'd.
even if overclocking, an hour or so of super pi and a dvd rip to mpeg-4 will ferret out almost any problem.
