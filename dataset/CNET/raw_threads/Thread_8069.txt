I've tried latest version of dd-wrt and tomato. Both are working well. 240MHz Broadcom CPU which is great. The board appears to be a pretty basic Broadcom reference design. Removable antennas are a big plus. Unlike the WRT54GL, can be easily wall mounted without any adapter plates or ugly cable ties. All ports are color coded which helps figuring.
