My daughters laptop (Fujitsu Siemens Amili Pi 1505) suddenly stopped working while she was busy with Internet and MS Word. Reboot says Operating system not found. BIOS recognises Fujitsu MHV2080BH SATA1 drive, shown as IDE (80 Gb). Things I tried: - Reboot from original recovery disk (Windows XP SP2). Loads all drivers. After that there's only a black screen with with a cursor in the upper left corner. Disc access LED loops: 7 seconds burning, 1 second off. - Locate a Fujitsu hard drive diagnostic on http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/storage/hdd/support/utilities.html . They only have one for IDE. However, it needs to be run from a DOS bootable device and the laptop has no diskette drive. I wonder if it's worth the trouble to make a bootable CD or a bootable USB. - Download a general hard disk diagnostic (mhdd - comes with iso for a bootable cd). That finds only the DVD/RW and no trace of the hard disk. Any other option than going to the repair shop and ask them to check the cables and then put a new hard disk in (and check it by installing Windows XP)? It's not something I'd like to do myself. And yes, I happened to make a backup last week. And explained about the need to store files on a USB-stick or in her gmail. Kees

You can still see your hard drive of 80GB in your partition.. It just won't be mounted. I doubt you'll need help doing that (live-usb) but if you do I suggest Debian Live... That's where I do my partition work. &quot;unetbootin&quot; is a very useful program to push .ISO images to your USB to make it bootable. p.s. At my old school, when we had those &quot;OS not found&quot; errors.. we had to refresh the RAM by taking the sticks out then putting it back in.. sometimes it would work. So... Make sure your RAM is properly connected and the hinges are properly securing it so it's not shaky. Hope that helped.

Laptops tend to get hot and when run in such a condition sooner or later they poop-out. To test the HD, I've used ADA-2020 adapter to a desktop and access the HD that way. You can then run whatever HD tests, etc. to help eliminate the HD as a problem. If no problem, return it to the laptop and try again. You can get your hands on the UBCD, Ultimate Boot Disk and get the .ISO file and make a bootable CD disk. That way you can test other componets, etc. w/o the HD or FD. http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ If you can inspect&verify any laptop fans are working to include the cpu one(if applicable). I found some laptops so hot, they burp the heatsink compound(expelled) to the sides yet work until it eventually dries out. In these cases, the cpu has fried or become too unstable to re-use. tada -----Willy
