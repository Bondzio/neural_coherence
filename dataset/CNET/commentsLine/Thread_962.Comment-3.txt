i'm presuming it's 10 base2 and still in good shape.
i believe this cable allows something like 185 meters but, if it's old, that might be a stretch.
if that's the case, one option might be to find an old nic with a coax jack.
you'd also need a t connector and a terminator, of course.
is that an option?
