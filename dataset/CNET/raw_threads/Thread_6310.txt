I'm currently using the VGA with my desktop, but would like to also connect my laptop, which has VGA and HDMI outputs. Which combination would be the most simple and inexpensive? I've already tried VGA to DVI-D adapters, but quickly learned that I need a converter, which is too expensive. Looking forward to your suggestions.

Don't use it for K (keyboard). Your choice to use it for M (mouse). I've never compared the price of a KVM-switch to a VGA-DVD-converter. So I don't know if that isn't too expensive for you also.

I was guessing it would be best to get an adapter for VGA to S-video, or VGA to component, or something similar, and just wanted to make certain that adapters such as these are analog, and efficient for this application. I'll look into the KVM. Thanks Kees.
