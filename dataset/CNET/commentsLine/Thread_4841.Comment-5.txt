thank you very much!
i'll see if i can find the temperature in bios.
i guess this is my project for the today if i can find some arctic silver5 locally.
from what i'm reading it looks like i need to start by blowing dust off the cpu and fan.
i've never done this before.
i see there is a heat dissipation structure that appears to mounted above the processor.
it is a stack of thin square silver-colored metal plates with spacers between each plate.
the stack is about 6 inches high.
it looks like it is held down by four philips screws, one on each corner.
it looks like the structure will come off if i remove the 4 screws.
(i assume this structure will lift off the fan or cpu and leave the cpu in the mother board?)
each of the 4 screws goes through a spring.
when i replace this device will there be a torque issue with remounting the heat dissapater or can i just use my judgement when i tighten them?
i can't tell for sure if there is a fan between that and the cpu.
if there is, should i replace it while i'm there?
assuming there's a fan on the cpu, i'm wondering if that might be going out.
i noticed during trouble-shooting the last couple of days that when i power the system on the fan kind of makes a revving noise for a few seconds - kind of like starting an old car in sub-zero temperatures.
