Apparently this hotel doesn't have wireless available, though in my travels around the US I find wireless is the standard rather than the exception.
Regardless, a very low tech, simple solution I use when confronted with this situation is a 25ft extension cable with an inline coupling.
Both can be purchased at Walmart for around 20 bucks.
25 ft. cable will reach anywhere in the room and even allow you to sit outside and get some fresh air while computing.
It isn't elegant, but it is guaranteed to work 100% of the time.
Of course I don't have the option of taking my wireless router either.
