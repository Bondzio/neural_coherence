my specs: 2.6ghz celeron 1gb ram, pc3200 128mb radeon 9600 2 hds, 40gb 5900rpm, 160gb 7200rpm 2 cdroms, 52x cdrw, 8x dvdrw 17&quot; lg lcd monitor the old 300watts power supply and 40gb harddrive are salvaged from my last computer, and don't cost extra.
but still, you have to remember, this was build a year ago.
maybe things are just a bit more expensive then?
