1.1.1	Hi everybody, Is an OCZ PC-3200 DDR400 Value Series 2GB (2x1024MB) Dual Channel Kit (OCZ4002048V3DC-K), with 3-3-3 timing, fast enough for running modern games such as FEAR?	St
1.1.2	If I choose to use this ram, will I experience any lags, assuming I have an AMD 4400 x2, and a 7800 gt oc.	St
1.1.3	Thanks in advance for trying to help	St
1.2.1	So I'll just tell you what I see.	St
1.2.2	If I auto config this mem it sets up to 3,3,3.	St
1.2.3	Using a mem tester I find that I can config this mem to 2,2,3 and it runs fine.	St
1.2.4	I've run mem benchmarks both ways and darned if I can see a diff.	St
1.3.1	Has to do with latency, the first three does any way.	Ques
1.3.2	The difference between 2 and 3 latency is 10 nano seconds.	St
1.3.3	Nano means One-billionth.	St
1.3.4	Bottom line, 3-3-3 is fine.	St
1.4.1	Cheers Thanks for your input guys!!	Polite
1.4.2	!	St
1.5.1	as there are faster ones that are cheaper than that or at least 2x512 sticks.	St
1.6.1	never the mfr's fastest memory.	St
1.6.2	But a good performamnce to price ratio.	Polite
1.7.1	But I think only benchmarks and maybe a gain of 5-10FPS maximum is the difference you might get from the bottom of the barrell to the top.	St
1.7.2	~Ibrahim~	St
