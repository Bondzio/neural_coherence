I'm going to visit my daughter.
I have an Apple Ibook using a Netgear router.
She is using a Belkin router with A Windows XP pc and a Windows XP laptop.
Should my Ibook be able to pick up her signal?
If so, any help you can give me to use her Inter net while visiting would be helpful.
Obviously, I am new to wirless networking and Ibooks.
Thanks.
