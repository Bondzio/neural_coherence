1.1.1	I can not figure out , for the life of me , how to get the WEP encryption to work with windows XP .	St
1.1.2	I 'm using a Thinkpad T42 .	St
1.1.3	I type in the password , and it generates the numbers , but when I plug them into the notebook , it does n't seem to work .	St
1.1.4	I do n't know a lot about wireless .	St
1.1.5	What am I doing wrong ?	Ques
1.1.6	If I have not given enough info , please let me know .	St
1.2.1	Lots of links here : http : //www.google.com/search ? sourceid=navclient & ie=UTF-8 & q=enable+WEP+linksys for what you ask .	St
1.2.2	Myself I just enable MAC filtering to keep out any onlookers .	St
1.2.3	It 's enough for me .	St
1.3.1	Here 's my checklist ... 1 .	St
1.3.2	Firmware is latest in all devices .	St
1.3.3	2 .	St
1.3.4	The WAP make is the same as the Client device .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	The firmware is all updated , but I 'm not quite sure what your second statement means , as I am quite new to all this .	St
1.4.2	Is enabling the MAC stuff , like the previous poster good enough ?	Ques
1.4.3	Or should I definitely use some sort of WAP settings .	St
1.4.4	Thanks again , and sorry for my newbieness .	Polite
1.4.5	-Plink-	St
1.5.1	Oh , also , I do n't see anything called WAP , just WEP .	St
1.5.2	Again , I have no idea what I 'm talking about , so any help at all is useful .	St
1.5.3	Thanks again .	St
1.6.1	WAP= wireless access point , aka your router WEP= wireless encryption protocol , it scrambles your wireless transmissions A WAP can be set to use WEP .	St
1.6.2	Are n't acronyms fun .	Polite
1.6.3	I would start slow with MAC filtering until you get used to the routers security features .	St
1.7.1	Okay .	St
1.7.2	I figured out how to enable the MAC filtering .	St
1.7.3	Thanks a lot guys .	St
1.7.4	That should be just fine for now .	St
1.8.1	Okay , one last thing .	St
1.8.2	On Windows XP Pro , it still says that this connection is not secure .	St
1.8.3	Is it ?	Ques
1.8.4	Should it still say that ?	Ques
1.8.5	I went and did an automatic MAC address update in the MAC filter .	St
1.8.6	It found the connection on it 's own , and added it .	St
1.8.7	Is that how it should have been done ?	Ques
1.8.8	Thanks again .	St
1.8.9	Sorry for all the questions .	St
1.9.1	In MAC filtering you can enable the feature to only allow the wireless devices you want .	St
1.9.2	Although this does not close the door completely on would be snoopers it is a good start .	St
1.10.1	Okay .	St
1.10.2	I seriously doubt there is anyone who is computer savvy around here .	St
1.10.3	This is n't exactly the best neighborhood .	St
1.10.4	I 'm not too worried that it is n't secure enough , I was just curious if it was actually working or not , since XP still says that it 's not a protected connection .	St
1.10.5	Thanks again .	St
1.11.1	The issue that XP boots and declares the connection unsafe is noted as a bug .	St
1.11.2	It 's been discussed .	St
1.11.3	To be safe , enable the firewall and add another firewall .	St
1.11.4	Read ... http : //reviews.cnet.com/4520-10166_7-5507759-1.html Bob	St
1.12.1	Will I have to purchase something to get the security I need ?	Ques
1.12.2	I 'm a poor college student !	St
1.12.3	Seriously !	St
1.12.4	I would use the XP SP2 , but am a little wary about installing the SP2 .	St
1.12.5	I have a Thinkpad T42 , and I have heard that it is not quite supported yet .	St
1.12.6	Is there another free firewall that would be useful for me ?	Ques
1.12.7	Thanks for that link .	St
1.12.8	I 'll try to look around some more , so I can finally stop bothering you .	St
1.12.9	Thanks again .	St
1.13.1	Zonealarm has a free version and so there 's no need to part with the cash today ... Bob	St
1.14.1	Your security questions have 2 facets - secure transmissions from PC to Access Point ( WEP or the newer , more secure WPA ) and MAC address filtering to prevent someone from picking up your access point 's signal and & quot ; tapping & quot ; into your AP to surf the Net or your PC 's files .	St
1.14.2	If you have WEP enabled , but do n't turn on MAC filering someone can hack your PC or use your AP to surf .	St
1.14.3	If you have MAC filtering enabled , but do n't have WEP someone ( I do n't know what equipment would be needed ) could & quot ; read & quot ; the radio signal from your PC to AccessPoint .	Ques
1.14.4	Ideally you should have both security systems in place .	St
1.14.5	However , I do n't think too many could intercept and decipher the radio signal .	St
1.14.6	But many more could simply tap into your access point without the MAC address filtering .	St
1.14.7	Sounds like you successfully have turned this on .	St
1.14.8	( Linksys makes this easy . )	St
1.14.9	You should also turn off your router broadcasting your SSID - it makes it easier for a someone looking for an open access point to hijack a ride on .	Sug
1.14.10	You simply have to program your PCs , but you know what your SSID is so no problem .	St
1.14.11	Firewalls - Zone Alarm and Sysgate Personal Firewall are both free and both work well .	St
1.14.12	WinXP SP2 - I have upgraded 5 PCs with no adverse reactions .	St
1.14.13	I think some of the negative press comes from users not understanding the need to reconfig the new Windows Firewall ( which is by default turned on ) to allow certain applications to pass through .	St
1.14.14	You have to do this with every firewall .	St
1.14.15	ZA and SPF just make this easier by popping up messages with every attempt by programs to access the internet .	St
1.14.16	Windows Firewall just prevents access and you have to know enough to reconfig access .	St
1.14.17	Hope all this helps .	St
1.15.1	When talking security WAP= WiFi Protocol Access ( WPA ) encryption .	St
1.15.2	The latest firmware for the Linksys G Router lets you choose this protocl instead of WEP	St
