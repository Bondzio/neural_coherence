1.1.1	Allright ... something is wrong with my display - whenever I boot up my comp now , its checkerboard colors ...	St
1.1.2	I can tell that it is changing and loading , but something is wrong .	St
1.1.3	I sent my videocard back to ATI , and got a new one back but it didnt help any .	St
1.1.4	Ive got an AMD 2500+ OC'ed to a 3000+ I have - ATI Radeon AIW 9800 Pro 512 MB Ram Basically , I need a mobo that is AGP compatible and a decent CPU to go with it ; and also it needs to have decent onboard audio because I have a 4.1 logitech system .	St
1.1.5	I have AMD now , but would not care really if it was AMD or Intel , whatever is better for the money .	St
1.1.6	I plan on ditching the mobo/cpu i have now bvecause i feel like it would be too much of a hastle to swap CPUs with a new mobo ... not to mention the CPU might be the prob anyway .	St
1.1.7	I spent around $ 200 when I built the comp 3 years ago ...	St
1.1.8	I would prefer to spend about that or less if I could .	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance for any help !	St
1.2.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813127201 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819116001 And that pretty much brings you up to dual core land for under $ 200 and you wo n't need to add any new upgrades like ddr2 or PCI-express .	Ques
1.3.1	Awesome , thanks for the recommendation ... the reason I dont care about pci-express as much is because i think that the card I have still sells for a couple hundred and it would not be worth upgrading it ... but i may be wrong on that part ... ?	Ques
1.3.2	anything anyone can recommend for under $ 150 ?	Ques
1.3.3	Im not sure if 64 bit or dual core is better ?	Ques
1.3.4	And would it be worth it to wait till next month or anything ?	Ques
1.3.5	Thanks again !	St
1.4.1	I realize you are probably trying to build the cheapest upgrade possible , but shaving $ 50 dollars off of the price means degrading pretty severely in performance .	St
1.4.2	I do n't know what you use your computer for ( gaming , office , Home theater , etc . )	Ques
1.4.3	so it 's kind of hard to make a solid recommendation .	St
1.4.4	The CPU/mobo combo I listed above is what I would call a budget , best-bang-for-the-buck , upgrade .	St
1.4.5	If you want nothing to do with gaming or multimedia then you could easily get a celeron D and save another $ 50 or so .	St
1.4.6	The PCI-express thing is more about & quot ; room to grow & quot ; , AGP is an EOL ( end of life ) technology , which means that at some point graphics card vendors are going to stop producing cards that use the AGP bus .	St
1.4.7	If you at some point to want to upgrade your video card , you could end up having to do a complete system upgrade .	St
1.4.8	As a stop-gap , inexpensive upgrade however an AGP motherboard is fine .	St
1.4.9	as for dual core ( 64bit extensions are not as important for your needs I would think ) ; it 's pretty much the industry standard now and for $ 120 is a helluva deal .	St
1.5.1	hrmmm ... well this gets me thinking if you would recommend to get a mobo with both pci-e and AGP ?	Ques
1.5.2	I searched newegg and found some for AMD chips ... any with comperable prices with the pentium and have both ?	Ques
