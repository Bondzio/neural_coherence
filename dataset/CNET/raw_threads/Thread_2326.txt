I'm running two laptops on it and would like to run my printer through the router. The printer is hooked up and the router recognizes that something is plugged into the ethernet port, but the ping test always fails. I've tried adding the printer as a standard TC/IP setting, but the computer can't find the printer (I suppose because it's not communicating with the router properly). Printer: HP Laserjet 2840 Laptop: Windows Vista Any help would be appreciated. Networking this printer would be a great help. Thank you

Does the printer's subnet mask match your network's mask? Usually these are set from the printer's front panel, but you'll need to refer to the manual for actual adjustment.

I have setup HP2840 printer with IP address and subnet mask as per my router configuration but I can't ping it. I am using XP.
