<s> I just put my system together with an ASUS MA3790T-Deluxe MB and an AMD Phenom 9950 (125 watt). </s>
<s> I thought I could get by with an older ATX power supply and was just using a 4 pin input on the 8 pin socket and my CPU fan is not running. </s>
<s> I can get into the bios and such but do not want to run the machine for long because I can see the CPU temp rising in the Hardware monitor. </s>
<s> I tried plugging in two 4-pin ATX jacks to the socket but they did not fit cleanly and the concept made me queasy to begin with (is this something to avoid?) </s>
<s> I'm guessing/hoping that this is due to the lack of an 8 pin ATX input on that socket (documentation does specifically note that this should be used). </s>
<s> I have a new ATX 12 V v2 power supply coming in two days but want to be sure I have a backup plan if that is not the case. </s>
<s> My question is whether it is reasonable to assume that the power supply is the reason the CPU fan is not working. </s>
<s> Is is possible that the CPU fan power jack has a problem (MB was an open box item on Newegg...)? </s>
<s> Is it an issue with the heat sink, perhaps (and can I swap out my heat sink for my AMD 2 to check)? </s>
<s> Further, if the new power supply does not resolve the problem, is there an alternate CPU heat sink that would run off of a 4 pin ATX connector? </s>
<s> This would seem like a reasonable workaround. </s>
<s> Open box from NewEgg, you take your chances and must be aware of correction based on your knowledge. </s>
<s> It could already be damaged when you received it or simply not having all the goodies that came in the box, like CD, or cables, etc.. </s>
<s> If it fails after all is said and done, return it??? </s>
<s> if possible. </s>
<s> As for connections, they are not a mystery. </s>
<s> if you have to force or somehow guess, then either you lack the proper connections due to an old psu or too old period. </s>
<s> WAIT, until the new psu comes, you may cause damage and become clueless or few options to recover. </s>
<s> Yes, newer psu have various connections and some &quot;don't get used&quot; as they are for Intel type or multiple similar connects like for video power. </s>
<s> You have to be sure. </s>
<s> When you get new psu, come back with results. </s>
<s> If no manual, get one form the mtrbd. </s>
<s> support website and d/l it for that model#. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Well, I got another tip to plug the CPU fan into the power fan connector on the motherboard to test if it was the heat sink unit. </s>
<s> This powers the fan and lets me run the box. </s>
<s> I'm still curious if the 8 pin connector will resolve the issue with the proper connector and will post an update on that. </s>
<s> If it does not (which would mean the CPU fan connector is defective), I can live without the fan speed throttling that the cpu fan connector would enable. </s>
<s> I would like to invest in more exotic cooling mechanisms down the line anyhow. </s>
<s> I'm curious though, currently I get a warning on bootup &quot;CPU fan error!&quot; Not having clean boots could get annoying. </s>
<s> How do other CPU cooling devices (like water or oil immersion) work? </s>
<s> Would they plug into the CPU fan connector to resolve this? </s>
<s> There may also be a bios setting that I can change to fix this. </s>
<s> I'll update this thread with the 8-pin connector results. </s>
<s> Thanks to Willy for the advice! </s>
