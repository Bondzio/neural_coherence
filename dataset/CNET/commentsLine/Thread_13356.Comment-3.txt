i think you'll need to bridge the two nic's in the network connections page so that your pc knows to route traffice between the two connections.
could be a number of reasons why the original server pc stopped working but you should check the internet sharing is turned on and look at the xp firewall settings on both (sp2 made these much tighter).
have you tried a system restore on the original server back to when it was working??
good luck
