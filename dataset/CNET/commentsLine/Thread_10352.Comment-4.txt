the idea behind the high performance gaming pc builder is to lure newbies away from mainstream builders, convince them that they need the high end pc, that building it yourself is evil, and that this is the best option alienware though the years has to adapt, with compaines like ibuypower offering low cost desktops that at least appear high power, and companies like dell, compaq and hp responding with high performance gaming models of their own that use the latest and greatest of hardware, at a low cost (dimension xps, compaq's x gaming systme, and hp used to have a special retail agreement with systemax/tigerdirect to sell lightly modified workstations with geforce fx 5700 level cards (back when those were good) and good pentium 4 cpu's with nice upgradeability and good ram at a low cost)
