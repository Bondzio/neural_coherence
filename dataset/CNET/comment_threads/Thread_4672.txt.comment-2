I don't think you have a System&quot; problem based on your ability to display video on an external monitor.
Your laptop uses the same components/firmware/software to produce the video and is then directed to ALL the outputs on your laptop.
ie.
LCD screen and VGA/DVI connection.
I suggest you call Apple in whatever country you are in and go from there.
