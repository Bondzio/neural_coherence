This would be the third one. Original Sony dw-q28a just ran out of gas. The second a pioneer 118 (was looking for the 112 version that was mentioned on some forum but that was the older model and out) but that actually ended up putting the drive to sleep and not respond at all after 15 min. and also after loading a dvd it spun so fast, or maybe I put the disc in improperly, it flew off inside destroying the dvd and ruining the drive. The latest one is an LG LG GH22NP20 but it only recognizes a 4.7 dvd(and works successfully) using i-dvd, dvd studio and even just using finder to cut/copy and paste and burn. I've tried a TDK, Optical Quantum, Phillips, and a Verbatim DVD +RDL's and they all come up as DL discs for size in the &quot;get info&quot; but nothing will burn because it says the disc doesn't have enough capacity. Speed is not really an issue because I always burn slower than top speed anyways. Thanks.

I have three from them, all Pioneer drives, and been happy with them. Each one is slightly better than the last but the prices tends to remain around the same. They also stand by the stuff they sell.
