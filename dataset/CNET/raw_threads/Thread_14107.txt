Data is characters...A&gt;Z...0&gt;9...etc. Movies are data. Does an unformatted 200GB hdd weight less than the same drive filled with movies? ======== Think about it like this. A new unformatted HD is filled with something...let's call it blanks. If you send a movie/data to the HD you 'change' the blanks to data. Blanks and data weigh the same.
