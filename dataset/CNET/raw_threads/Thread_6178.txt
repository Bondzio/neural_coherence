So I may not notice crossposting and without a Search in the forums, I can't test for such duplicated posts. Let's see if you posted that it didn't help in the Windows ME forum?.... It appears you didn't. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6141-0.html?forumID=8&threadID=6034&start=0 That's very odd you wouldn't want to reveal the suggestions didn't help. Such information is part of the clues to solving your issue. Let's move forward with this Tip that is supplied with every post: &quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; You revealed you have Windows ME, but not much else. In short, you are part of the process to find the problem. If you don't want to reveal more, then you may want to call the camera's support line and see what they say. Bob
