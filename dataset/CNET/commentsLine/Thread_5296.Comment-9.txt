i bought a new hp computer with the latest integrated graphics card a couple of years ago.
it worked great until the graphic demands for the new games got bigger.
i had a very fast cpu chip, but the new grapics were beyond the capacity of the integrated graphics card.
no problem, i thought... i will just buy a new graphics card and turn off the integrated chip.
no dice!!!!
there was no slot on the mother-board to fit a new grapics card inside the computer!
i had no option other than buying a brand new computer.
a computer i was sure could be expanded for future demands.
