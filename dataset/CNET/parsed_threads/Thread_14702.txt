<s> I have a Dell Dimension 8100 desktop running with XP SP2 with all the new updates and drivers. </s>
<s> My USB printers are constantly going offline. </s>
<s> I've updated the drivers, bios, checked cables and uninstalled and reinstalled the usb card and deleted and reinstalled the printers and even moved the card to different slots. </s>
<s> Occasionally I can not see any jump drives when plugged into the 2.0 card. </s>
<s> Is it the card or is it windows? </s>
<s> I am hearing alot of bad things about windows xp compatability and usb 2.0 cards. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/cs-009238.htm sees a date of 6/6/2006 &quot; </s>
<s> I don't know enough about my motherboard to even answer that question accurately. </s>
<s> The board is the original to the dimension 8100 which I purchased in 8/01. </s>
