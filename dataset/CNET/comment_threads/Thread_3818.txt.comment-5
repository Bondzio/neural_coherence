The office has supplied me with a few models.
The Asus x202e looks nicely built but just like all the models except for those Toshiba toughbooks I have to be gentle.
And let's call out the battery with it's 300 cycle rating.
Let's say an owner charged it daily to use it on battery power every day.
The battery would be worn out in one year (almost all laptops have this type battery) so durable is not a word I'd use here.
