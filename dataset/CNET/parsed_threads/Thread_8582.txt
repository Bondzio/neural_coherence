<s> I need to transfer docs from my ancient, but reliable Quadra 700 to a new G5 imac. </s>
<s> I've been told to use an ethernet transceiver cable. </s>
<s> Anything else I need to do to make this work? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Does the 700 get on the internet? </s>
<s> You could use GMAIL to make a draft email then attach files. </s>
<s> Just don't send it. </s>
<s> Then on the new machine look at your gmail and copy out the attachments. </s>
<s> Quadra has an internet connection but crashes continually -- can't seem to handle the data download. </s>
<s> And, many of the files I need to transfer are large (graphic designer here.) </s>
<s> I was wondering if there were any software settings I'd need to change if I went via cable. </s>
<s> Either way the machine would crash. </s>
<s> Ok, the old fashioned way. </s>
<s> Go get a FTP SERVER on your new mac. </s>
<s> Now FTP the files over fast. </s>
<s> This is not to offer a course on IP addresses and networking or FTP use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> that you get an ethernet crossover cable and use it to connect the two macs together. </s>
<s> On the Quadra, turn on File Sharing and share the quadra hard drive, allowing access to everyone, including guests. </s>
<s> Connect to that HD from the iMac and suck the files off of the quadra. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Many thanks to both of you for the suggestions. </s>
<s> Now I have a better idea of how to go about this. </s>
<s> Most appreciated. </s>
