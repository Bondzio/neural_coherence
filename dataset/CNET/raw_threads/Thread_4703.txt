This is an explanation of a computer: 1) If the circuit is closed the current will continue until the circuit is open. The reverse is also true. Running a set of parallel wires will produce a constant brightness in lights, a standard in sound, amd the same effect in machine performance. Items run in a series lose the quality of performance. Let it be given that all the parts are the same. The microprocessor, sound card, monitor, speakers, etc- everything- on the computer must apply to these simple rules of electronics. The computer is a machine, and it is a machine which performs mathmatical equations. Every item has a value. The hard drive store items in a matrix pattern. The operating system is a set of instructions for the machine. This concept has been emphasized many times; and it has been ignored even more. Using the operating system is no different than using a spoken language. You must first learn the language and practice if you want to improve. If you want to do more, learn more.

Once people realize this and treat it as such then they can learn to use it better. Macintosh, Windows, Linux-kernel, BSD, UNIX, Solaris, Minix, etc are operating systems. Any machine can use any of them interchangably. Ther are bo holes in my dissertation, I'm sorry that you see it as such. The chip is a microprocessor, the original ones worked on vacuum tubes and switches which were on or off. It's that simple. This is not magic and it should not be appraoched as an unsolvable problem. People should be steered in the direction of being able to help themselves, not being given half-ass advice from faceless individuals that have less skill than a twelve year old hacker. Instead of continuously asking what this post is about, or, like the one before yours, flaunting the amount of stupidity one has, you can start helping people learn thier machine. Another explanation: you're selling a product. &quot;I like Dell.&quot; &quot;I like Compaq.&quot; &quot;Apple is better.&quot; Face it, that's crap. Showing the person- or, in this case, telling the person- how to use whatever machine would be more beneficial.

Your wiring description is in error. Do some reading on electricity, Ohms laws, and Kirchof's laws. You must be a newbie as I've been here since the '90s, build computers, and have over four thousand posts with correct answers. Faceless?

Now, I am curious as to which forum post stimulated your initial posting. While I don't doubt that you had good intentions with the original post in this discusstion, it reads like you are trying to regurgitate a condensed version of the first chapter in a Computers 101 textbook. (I have read and used many of them in classroom settings.) BTW, I agree with Coryphaeus on the holes in your statements about electrical circuits.

I am answering your question as such because you did not act like a self righteous ass. I do believe that it should be emphasized that people need to learn computer fundamentals. They would avoid the spyware and malware. people could find ways around faulty systems until a patch was released. Random posts stimulated this. I see answers that are advertisements and solutions for programs that only further clog up the Windows registries. I do not see a forum which reads &quot;Please go here for the manufacturer's site of whatever hardware you are having trouble with. They should be able to help you.&quot; I have done wiring in houses. I know the basics of electricity.

My initial reply in this discussion was not an attempt to berate you or ''act as a self righteous ass.'' I was simply using a common English metaphor to respond to a set of statements that seemed either to be an orphaned reply or a frustrated rant. I have no problems with either, especially since I have done both in one forum or another. I thank you for clarifying the nature of your post.
