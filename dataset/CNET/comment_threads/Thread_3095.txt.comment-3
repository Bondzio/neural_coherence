Well, I can't disable the onboard card because I cant see on the monitor to do it.
I did change the cmos battery and still nothing.
I also connected the hard drive to a different machine and it boots and the monitor displays compaq.
I also tried another hard drive in the machine that is having the issue and nothing happens.
