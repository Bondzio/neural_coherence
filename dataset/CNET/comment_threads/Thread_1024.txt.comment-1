I bought a Sony Vaio about 2 weeks ago and yesterday the wireless card randomly died.
The tech people at Sony said the only option was to send it in for repair (or return it to the store if possible.)
My question is what could have caused this to happen?
I ask because 1) I don't want it to happen on my next one and 2) my dad, of course, blames it on something that I must've done on the internet.
He thinks that the fact that I watch streaming videos somehow killed my wireless card, never mind the fact that I am typing on a 4 year old laptop on which I have streamed videos for 4 years and never had a problem.
What are some real reasons why this may occur?
Does it have anything to do with Vista?
