I just bought Battlefield 2, and found out I really need to. Normally, i'm diehard ATI, but i've been looking at Nvidia's latest stuff and it doesn't look half bad. So, basically, i'm looking for the best card for $100-200, ATI or Nvidia. I will be using it just about exclusivley for gaming (see Battlefield 2 for screenshots). Now, I don't have PCI express, but if there's a great card that has to have it, my motherboard's getting old and could be replaced too. Thanks in advance guys. P.S. Motherboard can support AGP 4X/8X and regular PCI. Also, sorry if this has been asked before, I really didn't want to search the whole forum.

(i have the game) well for ati, at LEAST a 9600 or 9800 PRO. nvidia, the requirements are steep, ea recomends at least a 5700 or greater so i would go at least a 6600gt or 6800 you might have to upgrade your power supply if you choose the 6800 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130202 thats the 6800 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121195 6600gt http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102290 9800 pro those are all great cards. konny
