It has a AMD Duron processor at 900mhz.. it came with a ATI 3D Rage2+DVD video card it has 20mb memory on it and it recently konked out.... i think..well anyway.. i was screwin aroundwith it one day and i installed XP on it. i decided to take out the ATI card and try to install windows XP then(the computer came with windows ME)anyway. the install decided to work except now the comp runs fine except when i play videos.. extremely slow.. the computer has 8mb for the video card built in. so i think its the memory. wat could happen to the comp if i tried to plug in my old video card again?.. would it crash windows or something?

A machine from 1998 might have 64MB RAM which means that you need to increase that to 256 or 512 M. 2. The person installing XP forgot that Microsoft does not install the best drivers. Update drivers from the hardware makers, not Microsoft. 3. The usual virus, worm or more invades Windows XP on a first install and connect to the internet. Antivirus and firewalls must be installed before connecting to the internet. Best of luck in recovery. Bob

Double check heatsinks are in place, not covered in dust and the fans are spinning like they were when new. Also, try a bigger power supply if you can. -&gt; It's odd you didn't address the items I noted in my first reply. If you do that again I'll consider that you are not reading my replies. Bob

The Duron is now fairly cheap compared to scrapping the machine. Also, you did not tell if you are relying on Microsoft for motherboard drivers. I can assure you that what's on the XP CD or at Microsoft is not proper. Try a scan with EWIDO and HOUSECALL. Leave nothing they find on the machine. Best of luck, Bob
