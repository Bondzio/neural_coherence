to try the restore options after you made your first backup.
It would be a real pity if you needed data from that backup and found out that you don't know how to do it.
So if you want to use that Lacie drive as a backup drive, see what software comes with it, or use Apple's Timemachine.
But whatever you use, be sure you can get that data back if you need it!
