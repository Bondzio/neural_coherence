1.1.1	Hello to anyone reading this ... about two days ago i came back home and found my cousin using my computer , i automatically told her to get off of it , so when i tried to use it , everything was ****ed up , nothing would open or close or anything , so i had to restart ( i had to do that by force too since it wouldnt shut down either ) after restarting it just wouldnt load up , i tried safe mode , didnt work either , it automatically restarted so i tried doing the repair with the windows cd ... but that didnt work either .	St
1.1.2	so i got kinda impatient and went for windows reinstallation but after i started the reinstall , it started giving me some errors , like some files wouldnt copy .	St
1.1.3	i had an extra windows copy , so i did the swapping cd 's thing when the error came up , but it didnt work either , same problem happened with both cds .	St
1.1.4	i figured either my harddrive or cdrom was ****ed up , or both cd 's were .	St
1.1.5	i did something stupid and bought a new harddrive , borrowed a new windows cd , and changed my cdrom for an extra one i had ... nothing worked .	St
1.1.6	forgot to mention ... i have two RAM i tried with both , one of them is kinda new so it cant be that ... i have no clue whats wrong , and i dont really know what my cousin did ... so i dont have a ****ing clue whats wrong with my pc but it just wont install windows or load or anything !	St

1.1.8	do i need to buy a new motherboard ? ?	Ques
