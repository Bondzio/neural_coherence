I've wasted money on two PCI controllers, the whole night looking up FAQs, knowledge databases, bios and driver upgrades from WD, Silicon Image and Vantec... and I was one stop short of RMA-ing my external HDD.... Thankfully I found this forum!
just a 60-second trick to shave the end off the header and it works!
the thing is... why can't they even get the specifications right in these sort of stuff?
