<s> I have been considering an external drive for all of my video and audio files so as to not overload my system and I want to know what all I would need to do or have to complete this? </s>

<s> I already have an external DVD burner. </s>
<s> I asked GATEWAY about this and all they replied with was a sales pitch for a 250G hard drive. </s>
<s> I have a GATEWAY e2300 w/ WINXP HOME w/SP2 and a 2.66GHz processor. </s>
<s> Can anyone enlighten me as to what I need to do? </s>
<s> Plug the drive into the external case, two connections. </s>
<s> Plug the case into the USB port on the PC. </s>
<s> Let XP find it. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> In XP open Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Computer Management, on the left click Disk Management, on the right, activate the drive if necessary, format the drive. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> It's really that simple. </s>
<s> Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't. </s>
<s> Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. </s>
<s> Man do I feel kinda stupid about now. </s>
<s> I guessed it would have been a little more complicated than that. </s>
<s> I do appreciate the post though. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Maybe next time I will look into it a little more before I put my foot in my mouth. </s>
