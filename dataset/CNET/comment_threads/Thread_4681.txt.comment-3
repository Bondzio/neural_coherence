at 800x600 the video processor must process 480,000 separate pixels.
At 1024x768 you get 786,432 pixels.
That is almost double the number of pixels.
But the only thing I couldn't figure out was why the performance wasn't along the same lines as the number of pixels.. How can my friend run at 1600x1200 with only a 20FPS difference?
The effect is negated by the number of textures, the number of objects and the number of polygons in the game.
Since these are a constant that take up a majority of the processing power, the number of pixels has a smaller but still noticeable effect.
