<s> think i found a replacement psu for my emachine. </s>
<s> i notice in its picture, though, that it has a fan on top. </s>
<s> never installed a psu before. </s>
<s> wouldn't that fan be blocked by the roof of the computer case when the psu is installed? </s>

<s> so far as installation goes. </s>
<s> Fortron been around for a long time ....I have several of their PSUs ...including one of these. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104954 Just makes sure it fits physically VAPCMD </s>

<s> installed. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...Might be better to keep a thread going than posting separate messages relating to same subject. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> i think i decided on an ultra v series 500 watts. </s>
<s> includes all cables. </s>
<s> i noticed some power supplies did not come with pci-x connectors. </s>
<s> some were too big. </s>
<s> some did not function at high enough volts or amps. </s>
<s> this one looks good from tigerdirect. </s>
<s> ive had good success with tigerdirect recently. </s>
<s> dont know the dimensions, but the guy at emachines support told me a standard atx psu should fit. </s>
<s> he warned me not to overbuy wattage unless my machine was going to use it. </s>
<s> otherwise, id burn out the motherboard. </s>
<s> so, all in all, buying a psu looks like it can be a pretty dicecy, vegas like adventure. </s>
<s> i'll see what happens next. </s>
<s> i had a sapphire radeon x550 which im using now. </s>
<s> great card. </s>
<s> then i saw an opportunity to get a sapphire radeon x700 pci-x for a very cheap price. </s>
<s> an even better great card. </s>
<s> then the x700 card ran, but very hot (80c ish). </s>
<s> assume it was because of my stock, bestec 300 watt psu. </s>
<s> fan seemed to be working. </s>
<s> it would just heat up fast especially with gaming. </s>
<s> so here i am wanting to use the x700 and not being able to avoid the new psu, which is what i originally did using the x550. </s>
<s> oy! </s>
<s> the eyes of a man are never satisfied. </s>
<s> so the proverb says. </s>
<s> You mean this one ? </s>
<s> http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=373044 . </s>
<s> Too many better brands. </s>
<s> Wouldn't put one of those in my PC. </s>
<s> Re the TECH and overbuying wattage.......clear he doesn't know what he's talking about. </s>
<s> Sure your X700 even has an PCIe power connector on it ? </s>
<s> Last ATI X700 Pro I saw didn't. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> in addition to the question of the psu fitting into the computer, sapphire says that they recommend at least 12v@25a for a mid level card. </s>
<s> i think i have almost to much information for my own good. </s>
<s> at this point, i'll spend what i need to for a psu that fits the bill. </s>
<s> i know you gave me a recommendation for the FSP brand. </s>
<s> are there others you would recommend as well? </s>
<s> ones with steady voltage. </s>
<s> or is that FSP sufficent for me? </s>
<s> havent done volts and amps since jr. high. </s>
<s> i would love for my search to finally end. </s>
<s> thanks so much for all your help so far. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817103937 </s>
<s> No, don't do it. </s>
<s> Go with as FSP or OCZ - you should be able to find a decent one in your price range. </s>
<s> If you're going to go with an Antec, I would go with a TruePower instead. </s>
<s> That being said, I would still go with FSP/OCZ. </s>
<s> No PSU's to my knowledge have fans on the top (as you mention, this would place it right against the top plate of a case, and utterly useless). </s>
<s> The picture shows the PSU's bottom because it has the fan, as the top of the unit is a blank plate, and is of no interest. </s>
<s> I bet we're all glad they don't take pictures of PSU's standing on their end's and sides now! </s>
<s> GB. </s>
<s> but, okay, okay, i'll probably go with the FSP. </s>
<s> but, i am curious though. </s>
<s> tigerdirect sells a lot of ultra power supplies. </s>
<s> they offer 16 different models and appear to be betting the farm on ultra psu s. ultra offers a lifetime warranty. </s>
<s> the x-finity has dual rails. </s>
<s> the tech support appears responsive. </s>
<s> just for instructional purposes, what's wrong with an ultra psu? </s>
<s> i really want to get a good psu. </s>
<s> have read many psu horror stories in my research. </s>
<s> looks like the FSP is the one. </s>
<s> soon if i dont get this right. </s>
<s> one guy i read said that the psu is one of the most elemental parts of a computer. </s>
<s> that was an understatement. </s>
<s> i think i'm really getting a good sense of that now. </s>
<s> fortunately, i don't believe we'll need to think about a psu in heaven </s>
<s> This is totally unscientific, but my cohorts and I have seen an abnormally high number of failures with Ultra PSUs, some of them catastrophic, ie- taking the whole rig down with them when they blow. </s>
<s> In addition, many demanding systems just haven't been able to boot with Ultras, 'specially the V-series ( V alue?) </s>
<s> Yeah, TigerDirect sells a lot of Ultra stuff - cases, power supplies, RAM, HSFs - but that doesn't mean that it's top-notch gear. </s>
<s> The RAM - sucks. </s>
<s> I got suckered in to it by a ton of rebates. </s>
<s> Latencies are horrible and they don't overclock for squat. </s>
<s> Only worth it if you get the huge rebates AND you don't have a demanding rig or plan on OCing. </s>
<s> both 500 watts. </s>
<s> both dual rails. </s>
<s> former: $64. </s>
<s> latter: $90. </s>
<s> former: 5 star user reviews. </s>
<s> latter: great internet reviews. </s>
<s> no user reviews as yet. </s>
<s> which of the two would do? </s>
<s> this looks like my last question... i truly hope. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
