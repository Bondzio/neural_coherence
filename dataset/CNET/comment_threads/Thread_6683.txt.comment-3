FIRMWARE= any chip(s) that can be &quot;reprogramed&quot; thus updated As for theCD drives, de-install your current one and then reboot, when down shutdown.
Now remove old drive and install new one.
If new drive has an install guide or similar follow it or get one from its own support website(do that before install and print it).
About the only cavet is use the 80-connector cable for best performance, re-using the old CD cable may(not) be OK, in most it is but again the help guide should point that out, also it does matter if it is the same type of cable.
