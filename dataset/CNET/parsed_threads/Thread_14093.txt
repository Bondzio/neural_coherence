<s> What is the main difference in performance between ATA HDDs and SATA HDDs? </s>
<s> Do you notice the difference? </s>
<s> I know there is some difference in speed, but I wonder if the common user has any need for the SATA drives. </s>
<s> The difference in price isn't a lot, but if the difference in speed isn't to be noticed, I don't find a reason to get a SATA drive as of now. </s>
<s> Tnak you all in advance. </s>
<s> There is no performance gain with SATA in the real world. </s>
<s> It is easier to set up. </s>
<s> &quot;What is the main difference in performance between ATA HDDs and SATA HDDs?&quot; Intel was lamenting on the cost of the cables and wanted something with less connections, less PCB space and to lower costs. </s>
<s> They knew it would not go well unless the speed could go up as well. </s>
<s> Since the differences are documented all over the web, I offer the prior sentences to throw a little light that SATA wasn't about speeding up the drive. </s>

<s> The difference in price isn't a lot, but if the difference in speed isn't to be noticed, I don't find a reason to get a SATA drive as of now.&quot; You should find benchmarks on the usual places. </s>
<s> www.tomshardware.com and such. </s>
<s> For today, for the machines I've seen, little difference. </s>
<s> The machine produced SETI packets at the same rate, booted in about the same time and the web pages appeared at the same speed. </s>
<s> I wouldn't see this as a make or break item on a new machine, but will continue to write that over-investing in 32-bit machines is to be avoided. </s>

<s> Here it is in a nutshell... ATA isn't going to be around after maybe 2-3 yrs, well until the stocks dry up. </s>
<s> SATA is here to stay and most newer systems support it and will become the defacto std. </s>
<s> to have. </s>
<s> As for speed a more notable difference can be had once everything falls into place, when? </s>
<s> well that's coming, but yes the speed difference is there already just isn't so obivious. </s>
<s> 1-2 yrs. </s>
<s> is a long time in the computer world so unless you need ATA get SATA and as you've noticed pricing isn't a great wall to overcome, if you're planning to buy now, many a mtrbd. </s>
<s> has either connecters or an adapter can be had, so even that isn't a stopper. </s>
<s> In real terms, provided no great hang-up when the last great push of ATA is done, roughly 5yrs pasts before you wonder what ever happened to them and they're history. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I have a couple of WD Raptor drives and can say that these &quot;seem&quot; to be quicker than even my IBM Deskstars (some call them &quot;Deathstars&quot;) which were said to be the IDE champions before the WD upped theirs to 8 megs of cache. </s>
<s> I notice the difference, however, only when performing specific tasks which clock time such as backup events. </s>
<s> What I think we need to remember is that IDE /ATA drives underwent a metamorphasis over it's life and got faster and faster as the technology improved with competition for sales. </s>
<s> SATA should do the same but is in it's infancy now. </s>
<s> As your ATA drives die out, the SATAs do offer some small benefits now so I would not avoid them if your MB supports them natively. </s>
<s> I would not go out and by a PCI add in card just to accommodate the new drives because these will probably never be impressive and are not inexpensive. </s>
<s> ` </s>
<s> I mena, you push quite a bit for not overinvesting in stuff that is 32bit due to the increasing 64bit. </s>
<s> Will the HDD's be different with 64bit? </s>
<s> Which is about right when you think that the read/write recording head is not reading off multiple tracks... Bob </s>
