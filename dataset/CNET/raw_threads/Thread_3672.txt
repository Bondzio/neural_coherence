My computer was bought in about 2004 and only has 512MB of RAM. it has 2 ports for RAM sticks, but im not sure what size to put in to make it faster. It's a HP725n with a 80GB HDD, and 2 256MB RAM sticks. Also, its running XP home. I'm not sure on the motherboard type, but can anyone make a suggestion based on the age and type of cpu?
