<s> I have a Dell E521 that runs vista. </s>
<s> When i go to restart the computer, the dell loading bar at startup crashes about half way up. </s>
<s> Why does this happen and what can i do to fix it. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Be sure to ask Dell.com Be ready to hear people ask for more clues such as what you installed from stock, if a reload of the OS fixes it, the contents of the Event Viewer, System Restore effects, etc. </s>

<s> I have had exactly the same problem since I acquired my E521 in February. </s>
<s> Dell even replaced the entire system, but the same has happened. </s>
<s> I'm sure it's the combination of software that they bundled in with the PC, but I don't yet know what I should be removing. </s>
<s> My view, however, is that Dell must surely be responsible for the s/w they package with the PC. </s>
<s> It hasn't worked since out of the box and it's extremely frustrating. </s>
<s> with connected usb devices booting at start-up. </s>
<s> Only have your mouse and keyboard connected(in the back, not the front or in the monitor. </s>
<s> Printer is ok, I don't have it on unless I'm using it anyway. </s>
<s> I use a usb flash-drive for readyboost but don't connect it until my system gets past the bios screen, then is ok to put in. </s>
<s> Lastest bios update still causing problems and was pulled. </s>
<s> Here are some things you can try to find the root cause (based on my past experience with Dell PCs and what I see here in the forums): 1. </s>
<s> Unplug or turn off all USB devices except the keyboard (KB) and mouse. </s>
<s> Restart and see if it happens again. </s>
<s> If so, continue on. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Try swapping the USB ports the KB and mouse are plugged into. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Did you (or they) install software you don't need? </s>
<s> if so, turn off the power, turn it back on and try to remove software you don't use. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Does the computer start feeling warm to the touch when you reboot it? </s>
<s> if so, there may be an issue with the cooling fans, power supply, processor or the BIOS. </s>
<s> Try flashing the BIOS, and if that doesn't solve the problem, contact Dell to have the desktop looked at by a technician. </s>
<s> Also, check the ventilation around the computer- make sure it has a couple inches of &quot;breathing room&quot; so the desktop can be cooled properly, and that the area has little or no dust. </s>
<s> It seems there may be a glitch in the BIOS or that it's having a problem recognizing something you have plugged in. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> i have had the same problem w/ my E521 ever since i got it. </s>
<s> however, when i got mine, i immediately did a clean install of XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> so it has none of dell's preinstalled software or vista. </s>
<s> there is a link on dell's support site that makes reference to a BIOS issue w/ the E521. </s>
<s> that may be helpful. </s>

<s> Heres my experience with my Dell Dimension E521. </s>
<s> I bought it about a year and a half ago, Athlon 64 2.4GHz (+3800), 2GB DDR2 667 MHZ RAM, Windows Vista Home Basic, DVD +/-RW CD-RW drive, 160GB SATA HDD. </s>
<s> The computer it was intended to replace was a Compaq Presario with an Athlon 64 2.0GHz, 2GB PC-3200 DDR1-400MHz RAM, Win XPPro. </s>
<s> I replaced the motherboard on this beast twice before giving up all hope of repairing it. </s>
<s> It had been configured with a wireless adapter (Netgear MA101), and using Comcast High-speed Internet. </s>
<s> I also use Comcasts free download of McAfee Security Suite, and Webroot Spy Sweeper anti-spyware. </s>
<s> Im also using a Logitech wireless trackball and keyboard. </s>
<s> When I first set it up, I had never used Vista before, but Im usually undaunted by new software. </s>
<s> Very soon I found out that Vista didnt recognize the wireless adapter, so I couldnt connect to the Internet. </s>
<s> Strike one! </s>
<s> Since I couldnt connect, I couldnt download McAfee. </s>
<s> Strike two! </s>
<s> So I decided to load Spy Sweeper from a flash drive. </s>
<s> The version I had wasnt Vista-compatible and I needed to download a new version. </s>
<s> (See Strike two) Strike three! </s>
<s> At this point I was so frustrated that I took out my license of WIN XPPro and loaded that after formatting the hard drive. </s>
<s> This made Vista completely unable to be restored. </s>
<s> That done, I upgraded the RAM to 4GB with two more 667MHz modules. </s>
<s> Everything went swimmingly until I started having to learn Vista for work and decided to reinstall it at home once I got all the new drivers and a new wireless adapter (Netgear Wg311T Vista compatible). </s>
<s> At first, I realized I didnt have all the original distro disks for the Dimension. </s>
<s> I contacted Dell and they agreed to send me a new set of four disks, Vista Home Basic (this time with SP1! </s>
<s> ), the Dell Applications disk, WinDVD, and Roxio Creator 10 disks. </s>
<s> Points for Dell Customer Support. </s>
<s> Upon trying to install Vista from these new disks, the installation kept freezing the system. </s>
<s> The display would break up into little vertical bars, about high by a few pixels wide, in rainbow colors. </s>
<s> The only way out was to hard reset by holding the power button in until it shut off. </s>
<s> I spent a TON of hours trying to troubleshoot the software I was using to figure out what was interfering with the system and causing the system freeze, with no luck. </s>
<s> I first removed all non-original hardware keyboard, trackball, previously-added RAM, to bring it back to original hardware configuration as closely as I could, all with no luck. </s>
<s> It would still freeze at random intervals. </s>
<s> If I booted it and just left it alone, it would often run for hours. </s>
<s> As soon as I started DOING anything with it, like web surfing, or downloading software, it would freeze. </s>
<s> I tried removing Spy Sweeper and replacing it with AdAware, and used AVG Free for anti-virus, figuring they night have smaller signatures than the others. </s>
<s> (I couldnt even download McAfee without a freeze within the first few seconds of the download). </s>
<s> I next accessed the Dell website on a laptop and went through the troubleshooting tree, performing every test and diagnostic they suggested and giving a reply at each test completion. </s>
<s> All tests passed, but the problem persisted. </s>
<s> I Googled for potential solutions, but I saw that many others were having similar problems with the E521 and Vista with no real solutions. </s>
<s> (Sorry, guys, GET LINUX!!! </s>
<s> is NOT a solution.) </s>
<s> One poster did, however, mention memory timing as a possible solution. </s>
<s> I looked into the BIOS setup, but there was no provision for changing memory timing. </s>
<s> This made sense to me, though. </s>
<s> When the system is idle, there is no aggressive memory usage. </s>
<s> Web surfing or downloading is very memory-intensive, so I looked at the system specs and saw that the E521 motherboard accepts three memory types, DDR2 at three speeds, 533, 667, and 800MHz. </s>
<s> I tossed a coin and decided to try a slower memory module. </s>
<s> I bought two 1GB sticks of 533MHz DDR2 at my favorite online surplus computer supplier and after wasting a full day with troubleshooting, I replaced the 667 sticks with the 533. </s>
<s> I restarted and have not seen the problem reoccur in about 48 hours of continuous operation. </s>
<s> &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was my experience and your mileage may vary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, but I would definitely suggest that you consider changing your memory timing, either by a physical change as I did, or if your system supports it, to tweak the BIOS to effect the same change. </s>
<s> Needless to say, I feel I have my computer back after a hugely frustrating time trying to debug software only to find out that it was a hardware incompatibility. </s>
<s> I hope this helps anyone who may be experiencing the same or similar symptoms with their E521 with an Athlon 64 2.4GHz. </s>
<s> Thanks, M. </s>
