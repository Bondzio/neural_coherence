<s> Want some ways to test this pc So far i want to test and run a full virus scan Here is the sellers description Gaming Desktop, custom built, extra parts available! </s>
<s> - $350 &lt;div&gt; Plays all games at high settings, great working/looking machine! </s>
<s> There is no game in the market this PC can't play on high resolution!&lt;/div&gt; Quad Core AMD Athlon 640 X4 processor 3.0Ghz with Cooler Master tower cooler &lt;div&gt; Gigabyte motherboard 780G &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; 4GB ram &lt;/div&gt; EVGA Nvidia GTX460 graphics card with 1GB DDR5 &lt;div&gt; 700W Kingwin MODULAR Power supply (brand new) &lt;/div&gt; Powerspec gaming case with two 120mm fans (brand new) &lt;div&gt; DVDRW drive Samsung &lt;/div&gt; 160GB 7200rpm hard drive Windows 7 operating system And is this a good setup for the price? </s>
<s> For me it's a no sale because of folk that complain in these forums about random reboots and that setup is listed too often. </s>
<s> The 160GB drive looks small today and well, as to the virus scan why is that needed as we can slip in the OS DVD, reload and then all the drivers to be sure it doesn't have a rootkit or worse? </s>

<s> I don't see this PC as the greatest out there but it is respectable. </s>
<s> However, I do see this as a dated PC when compared to gaming usage. </s>
<s> if this PC was in fact used as a gaming platform, it got used under stressful conditions and you're left with what available provided it still works well. </s>
<s> It's used, you take it all with a grain of salt. </s>
<s> If you plan to re-use as a gaming platform, then you must before you actually do, tweek it up or assure that what you can is at a level to do all it can do as a &quot;stable PC&quot; platform. </s>
<s> I would see this PC at the $250-300 range and prove what is new is new if not, reduce the cost more. </s>
<s> That's IMHO. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I wouldn't do it, you could buy a new tower from a box store for 100.00 or so more that would out perform this rig and you'd have a warranty. </s>
<s> A friend of mine purchased a Lenovo desktop, intel, i-3 6gb of ram 1tb HDD for 429.00 at Office depot. </s>
<s> I agree with pgc3, I wouldn't do it either...there are numerous retailers out there, where you can buy a decent (new) system: Best Buy, Office Depot, Frys Electronics, and tons of online retailers like Newegg.com </s>
<s> $350 is too much for this PC. </s>
<s> Everyone else is right, you can get a new, faster PC for just around $100 more, that will out perform this one on craigslist. </s>
<s> There are lots and lots of people on Craigslist who fancy themselves as PC salesmen. </s>
<s> They will paint a big picture of this great machine they have for only $xxx. </s>
<s> It is better to not put out this kind of money for any used PC, unless they can demonstrate to you in person that it will indeed live up to the hype they are talking. </s>
<s> If, as the seller says, &quot;Plays all games at high settings, great working/looking machine! </s>
<s> There is no game in the market this PC can't play on high resolution!&quot; , then why is he selling it? </s>
<s> As others have said, it's long in the tooth, not particularly well configured and not particularly cheap. </s>
<s> At $200-250, maybe but personally, I'd look elsewhere. </s>
<s> YMMV! </s>
