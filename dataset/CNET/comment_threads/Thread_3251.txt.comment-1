Hi, I have a e-machines T5016 Desktop which just died recently.
It is less than a year and a half old.
I had it checked and it was not the power system or switch.
It was suggested it might be the motherboard.
Does this sound right and how do I make sure?
Should I use e-machines replacement parts or something else?
I have installed extra memory before so would I be able to replace the motherboard myself or is it a technical job?
Don
