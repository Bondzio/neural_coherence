Good range, my router will be in the basement and my gaming computer is 2 floors up from here. 2. Much better speed, 300+ would be good. I have been looking at the Netgear wndr3700 is there a better one out there? Thank you

You ask NEW QUESTIONS so let's tackle those head on. &quot; What do people do who work in large office buildings or apartment buildings regarding wireless routers. Most likely they cannort have a router on each floor. If I cannot relocate from the basement where it is now what would you recommend? Maybe a bridge using 2 routers or what? &quot; A bridge might have wifi on the other end. I've noted AC POWERLINE BRIDGES that have wifi at one end which is a really nice and easy to setup solution. And you could use 2 routers with some bridge but some folk are challenged by the configuration (which is noted in this forum's sticky post about post 18 or 19.) The wndr3700 is a great choice but when we don't follow the maker's recommendations we often are disappointed. Example at http://forum1.netgear.com/showthread.php?p=235362 Post 3 notes more. You can try just one wndr3700 in the basement and have a backup plan if you are disappointed. Bob
