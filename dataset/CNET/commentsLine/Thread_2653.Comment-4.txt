our exchange cost was only 200 bucks.
cheaper than the time we would have lost futzing and fuming over this.
even at a new license of 1,200 bucks we would have done this since it's livelihood.
i guess you have to answer this yourself.
some discussions go like this -&gt;  you haven't told much about what you have so i can't guess what would work.
maybe it's one i've run into (i do embedded work and have used too many dongled softwares.)
you can also flip back to a desktop to fix this.
