I have a Compaq Presario 5000 with a Phillips CDD4801 CD-R/RW.
The drive is not recognizing the Verbatim CD-RW whether it is a new blank or one that contains data.
The device manager indicates that &quot;This device is working properly.&quot; The cd drives reads the data on the Verbatim Disc.
I have down loaded new updates, however the problem persists.
