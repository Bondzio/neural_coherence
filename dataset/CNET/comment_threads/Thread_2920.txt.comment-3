What a bummer So you are saying it is just hit and miss?
I will tell you what I am using it for, I have to enter disc info on my mega DVD player and it requires that type of keyboard I already have one for my computer and it doesn't work.
Let me ask you would the ones without all of the multimedia buttons be a good start to check?
