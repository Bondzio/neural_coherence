i first started using computers in the 1970's.
they were dos systems, had 5inch floppy disks, then one of the early macs, then onto mainframes and pc's.
when windows 95 came, it was like being in another world!
i used a wide range of applications, studied programs like cobol, fortran and basic and of course the windows stuff.
when using macs for the first time i liked to write progrms in basic for jokes.
for example, i created one that when booted, the attached printer, which was an old teletype machine, would start printing some kind of countdown saying this machine will self destruct in 10 seconds and then start a series of moving the platen up and down until switched off.
now that i have &quot;grown up&quot; (my humour is the same) i have just switched over to macintosh again and am giving bill gates the flick.
i am retaining one pc only.
the difference is amazing and in my experience makes windows look silly!
what next?
