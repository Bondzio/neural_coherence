1.1.1	I am installing a Inno3d geforce 6600 on an old p4 pc with 400watts power supply .	St
1.1.2	the machine has 1 cdrom , 1 80 gig hdd and 1gig and 512 ddr 400 ram .	St
1.1.3	when i havent installed the driver for the video card windows will start normally ( with sucky display because driver isnt installed yet ) .	St
1.1.4	but after i install the driver , windows wont start , it will only load up to the windows xp screen with loading bar on the low middle .	St
1.1.5	could it be that the power supply isnt enough or could it be that the video card is broken ?	Ques
1.2.1	it reboots after the windows xp with loading bar screen is done .	St
1.3.1	Seems it may be the card and\or did n't install correctly.Typically you install the driver FIRST before the card goes in .	St
1.3.2	Could be some chipset updating needed .	St
1.3.3	If you installed your drivers and card correctly and you still have your ONBOARD video enabled , this can cause a reboot .	St
1.3.4	However , if you disable the onboard and have issues , you may lose your video altogether and your option would be to pull the cmos batter for a reset or fumble around in the dark hoping you remember how to reset the settings without screen .	Sug
1.3.5	Cheers , Paul	St
1.4.1	did you clean up any previous drivers ?	Ques
1.4.2	Your manual\cd manual should tell you in what order the card\drivers go for your card and what to clean up or disable .	Sug
1.4.3	While most I have installed come drivers first , it 's not always the case .	St
1.4.4	After re-reading your post again , something was bugging me , when you install the drivers , everything goes funny so this tells me you need to check a a few things..	St
1.4.5	Disable onboard graphics in bios & lt ; but not before your drivers are installed , this would be bad & gt ; clean up any graphics drivers that were installed prior , it may be a conflict or both of the above .	St
1.4.6	Paul	St
