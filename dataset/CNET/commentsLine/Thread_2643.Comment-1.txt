buying a new mid-range desktop later this week.
haven't decided on whether to buy one off gateway's web site, velocity micro's site, or just go to best buy and make the purchase.
i chose gateway and velocity for there customer service and quality of systems.
most reviews on them seem to be good.
i know you can customize if you buy from thier web sites, but that is the only advantage i see so far.
gateway, velocity, or best buy store?
your opinions please.
