have an automatic shut down to protect the cpu if it's not seated properly or the HSF isn't protecting it enough and it overheats (usually due to the thermal paste or sticky thing isn't enough, too much, forgotten about or if the fan wasn't mounted properly on top of the cpu).
I would check there before anywhere else.
