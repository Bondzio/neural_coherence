Intel Core 2 Duo Extreme X6800 2.93GHz 4MB Cache 1066MHz FSB I just made another topic like this about graphics cards, and I have the same question about these processors. I have always been an Intel guy, but I wanted to make sure I wasnt making the wrong decision here. I know that like video game consoles people argue over which is better, but can anyone tell me if they will run about the same or which will be better. I diddnt even think about it until I saw &quot;save 300&quot; on an athlon system at alienware, now I am trying to decide if its worth it... Thanks guys I really appreciate it.
