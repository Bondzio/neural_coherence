Maybe he wants to order something from the menu. For the question, I don't think so. Each Wi-Fi location has a different home page. And some require a subscription like Barnes & Noble. When you log onto their wireless network, the first thing you get is a page telling you how to BUY minutes.

The basic concept works like this. I boot my PC and I get a DHCP assigned address. If I try to ping anything on the internet I am blocked. If I try to browse the internet my browser is hijacked or redirected to the &quot;Captive Portal&quot; web page. This page may live on the router or may be a separate web server. At this point I need to login or click some usage agreement to get the portal to release the hijack. Once I login, I can surf normally. Here is a link to some Linux based captive portals. http://www.answers.com/topic/captive-portal I believe this router from SonicWall will do the job. http://www.sonicwall.com/products/tz170_wireless_features.html They call the feature &quot;Wireless Guest Services&quot;.
