It should have a sticker on the piece of RAM, indicating it's clock speed (3-3-3 or some other timing), and the fact that it is a 400MHz RAM.
If you have an ASUS dual channel mobo, then chances are, it needs to be set up like this: A1--&gt; 512mb A2--&gt; 256mb B1--&gt; 512mb B2--&gt; 256mb Keep in mind that all the pieces has to be 400MHz and has to have the same clock speed, if there's no sticker on your piece of RAM, try asking the person you bought it from, but make sure he actually knows what he's talking about, if there's any &quot;umm&quot;s, or if he shows any signs of unsureness, then make sure you ask a couple other people, before setting up the clock speed in the BIOS, because setting the clock speeds wrong can and may result into damaging the memory.
If you have to, post the model number and the brand name, and ask a couple of cnet members, they can probably give you a more precise answer.
You can also search the model number on google, maybe you will find some info on your perticular memory.
Good luck Cheers
