Hello, I want to build a nice gaming computer, and I have slightly over a grand to spend on parts (not including monitor and operating system, those are covered already).
I have some general computer knowledge, what parts handle what and I have a pretty good idea of where to plug them in.
That being said, when buying parts I'm at a bit of a loss.
I'm not sure when looking at a motherboard for instance, what I need to be looking for.
I think I might could find some high performance parts, but I'm really worried about them being compatible If anyone has ideas on some good compatible parts or possibly tips as to what I could run into as far is incompatibility issues, that would be great.
Thanks, Nicholas
