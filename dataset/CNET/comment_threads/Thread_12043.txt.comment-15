an RMA???
Theyt'll ask you to run a diagnostic that you can download.
it won't run and then you get to return the drive and get it replaced.
The replacement may be yours repaired or someone elses repaired.
I noted that most of the &quot;drive locked&quot; threads here were related to Maxtor drives.
