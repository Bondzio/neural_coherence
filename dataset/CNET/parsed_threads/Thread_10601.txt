<s> i have a gateway sx2802-03 with a nvidia gt610 installed. </s>
<s> the PSU is 220w but the graphics card says it needs a minimum of 300w. </s>
<s> ive been using it for a few months now with the 220w. </s>
<s> I wanted to know if running it underpower was alright and if i upgraded the psu to a 400w or so if that would improve my GPU preformance. </s>
<s> here is a link to the PSU from what i found </s>
<s> Example at http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/367004-33-gt610-graphics-card But the answer is no. </s>
<s> Changing the power supply will not improve the GPU. </s>
<s> Just wondering, why not the slightly better GPU I recommend for such machines? </s>
<s> That's the ATI 5450 1GB card. </s>

<s> Unfortunately I didn't purchase it, it was a gift. </s>
<s> But hey it was free. </s>
<s> anyways I would have probably gone with a better upgrade if I bought it myself. </s>
<s> The manufacturer has mentioned to use &quot;x-wattage&quot; they know what they're doing. </s>
<s> They have superior knowledge and pass it on. </s>
<s> Even though it works for now, sooner or later it will bite you. </s>
<s> Should the PSU fail, you will have problems, so best to follow what's recommended. </s>
<s> Recommended PSU is best for continued operation of the PC. </s>
<s> NO, it won't make the PC run better but it will run which is the point for the recommendation for GPU operation. </s>
<s> More demanding GPU tend to tax the PSU once its gets into more extreme setting or prolonged usage. </s>
