my old ibm used to and still does reboot/restart atleast 4 or 5 times when i use it.
i finally got a new computer and its so much better.
i didnt know what was wrong with the other one.
maybe it had alot f viruses on it or spyware even though virus checker says there are no viruses.
i dont know but it freezes up alot and i do mean alot when i use ot.
i end up having to unplug it and plug it back in.
i searched for a remedy on windows website.
it said something about shutting down protects it from something harmful.
no real solutions here, just letting you know that i have the same problem with my ibm
