I need to transfer dvds to digital so i can edit.
I have a bunch of footage on dvds and I am trying to figure how how to hook everything up to make it work.
Anyone know how to do it.
I Also have a hdv player.
If I cold even transfer the dvd footage to a dv tape that would work for me also.
HELP!!
!
