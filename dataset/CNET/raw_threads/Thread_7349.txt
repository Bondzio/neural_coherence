My loop is working fine and I am using a T-line to fill it. It is full and almost bubble free however when I turn the pump off the water level rises a little bit in the filling tube. Does anyone know why the water level might rise when I turn the pump off?

Water is not compressible (let's accept that for a moment) but there is some note from you that it's almost bubble free so any bubble can be compressed. Are you fretting over this a bit too much? I mean, does it work? Bob

The water coming out of the radiator feels just as hot as the water going in. Might this be due to air bubbles?

Remember there are no part numbers, pictures or numbers here. One member had a CPU at 30C and was concerned when a new cooler didn't make it cooler. Hard to tell them it was fine. Bob

I am using an OCZ Hydroflow CPUblock, a Swiftech 120mm fan, and my pump is a DangerDen CPX Pro. My old air cooler was a Coolermaster Hyper 212 Plus. I don't think it is the connection to the waterblock because it feels hot which would imply that heat is being transferred.

Basic understanding of heat transfer is needed. But no pictures means folk can only guess the water is hot but the cooler is not where air can flow. Bob
