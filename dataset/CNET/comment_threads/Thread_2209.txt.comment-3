Hello Bob, Thanx for your humorous but nonetheless serious reply.
I found a site that helps which I share with you (and all who migh come across this issue): http://www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/ Now, I have another question: Bearing in mind that i am nill in physics, let's say my PC power consumption is 300 watts and it runs for 12 hours daily; What formula do I use to get the 12hrs power consumption?
Thank you
