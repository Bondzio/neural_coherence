One computer has 2 network cards, the other has one. I have the DSL modem going into one of the network cards on computer A. The 2nd card on computer A is hooked up to a 5 port switch. Computer B is also hooked up to the switch. Before I had broadband i used dialup. This set up worked fine for dial up, but for some reason the internet wont work at all if i try to network the 2 computers using this method. Please help me! Thanks

For as little as $20, you get a device which will service the Internet connection as well as provide the infrastructure for a local area network. ICS works fine until some software incapatibility wrecks the networking ability of XP. A hardware solution is best.

If is it then you won't have to buy a round and you would disregard the second nic card and connect the dsl directly to the switch and run ur network and share the internet thru that if now,then I would suggest buying a rounter to make things simple. You can also set the net on PC A then run the XP network wizard on PC a with internet sharing then run the network wizard on PC B telling it to get NET access from PC A. *** Do not foget on to distinguish the NIC cards on PC A properly 1 would be for the net and the other for the network with internet sharing enabled. Good luck
