1.1.1	Hey guys, So i recently aquired a new Mobo, CPU, and some RAM.	St
1.1.2	So basically a whole new setup.	St
1.1.3	I installed all these new parts with my old Video Card and harddrive and booted up.	St
1.1.4	First problem i ran into was with the OS.	St
1.1.5	( Running old Windows Xp) So i used the repair and after a while got everything running.	St
1.1.6	Did windows update for everything it would give me.	St
1.1.7	But my sound is not playing at all.	St
1.1.8	No sound from anything.	St
1.1.9	I went on the MoBo site and tried to get the audio driver but whenever i install it and restart it doesnt show up in Device Managers.	St
1.1.10	*** Think this is the step i need to do, and not 100% on if i did it right I did update my video card drivers fromt the website as well and the only yellow exclamation marks i have left in Device Managers is unknown devices in the other category.	St
1.1.11	( 3 of them.)	St
1.1.12	Specs.	St
1.1.13	Asus P8P57 Deluxe - Mobo Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 - CPU ATI Radeon HD 4600 Series - Graphics Card 4gbs Ram	St
1.2.1	It's the yellow exclamation marks.	St
1.2.2	These are devices Windows does not recognize and have drivers for.	St
1.2.3	They are likely on your new motherboard and the old copy of XP cannot fix that for you.	St
1.2.4	The motherboard should have come with a driver disk.	St
1.2.5	You need to run that and install the drivers beginning with the chipset drivers.	St
1.2.6	After that, you can try the sound card and other devices until all the yellow goes away.	St
1.2.7	Good luck.	St
1.3.1	EXAMPLE (!!!)	St
1.3.2	at http://www.fastfs.com/help_pages/hp%20downgrade.htm Notice how hard it is to install Sound on XP?	St
1.3.3	I find this to be true for most of today's hardware.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
