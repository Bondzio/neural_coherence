like most cisco gear it will run forever.
this device is end of life and end of support so don't pay a lot for it maybe $100 all depends what you want to do with it, if you just want to hook a bunch of stuff to your router it will do fine even if you run vlans and such.
note this is a managed switch, you may have to do some basic config.
