1.1.1	I dug my HP Laserjet 4 Plus out of the closet the other day , and hooked it up to see if it would work .	St
1.1.2	After dusting it off , I hit the magic button , and it turned on .	St
1.1.3	It warmed up and went to the & quot ; Ready & quot ; screen .	St
1.1.4	Then , I noticed a burning smell coming from the fan on top .	St
1.1.5	I immediately turned it off and unplugged it .	St
1.1.6	Is there any idea what this could be caused by ?	Ques
1.2.1	Dust can make a smell provided it gets near any hot surface , open up the printer and & quot ; blow it out & quot ; well and retry again .	St
1.2.2	Alas , there is also the & quot ; ionic & quot ; smell from the filter which can if dusty as well produce a smell .	St
1.2.3	Any of the above smells should go away after time , like a day or two due to non-use of the printer .	St
1.2.4	I suggest you plug-in at an outlet away from other conbustables and retry again and just leave it on , using common sense to take any action , but if dust is the problem allow it to be on longer .	St
1.2.5	The last item , if in closet , little critters can make a home of it and/or leave little bits of thier passing , these too can provide a smell .	St
1.2.6	Check it out and get back to us .	St
1.2.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	This model ( and others ) laser printer heats up a fuser ( bonds the toner to the paper ) which could have some dust or other material on it .	St
1.3.2	I agree with the other member that it 's likely dust or other .	St
1.3.3	Just dust it out one more time and do n't leave it unattended at first to be safe .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Alright , I 'm just going to leave it plugged in and on for a day or 2 and see what happens .	St
1.4.2	FYI , I printed a test page through the menus , and it came up fine .	St
1.4.3	It just smelled even worse because the fan goes into high gear when it is printing .	St
1.4.4	I ran a couple more to be sure , and it prints fine .	St
