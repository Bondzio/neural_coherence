Desktop (Windows 2000) which uses ethernet connection through router for internet access. This works flawlessly. However the wireless connection on my Laptop (Windows XP) cannot get to the internet. I cannot ping the router, I'm using static IP addressing and all subnets match. The confusing thing is that I get a connection to my network but because I get a consistent message on the bottom of the screem saving connected to my SSID with Excellent signal strength. But no internet. Please any help is gratefully welcomed
