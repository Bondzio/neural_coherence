you have pushed the pc util it broke.
when you oc, you stress and shorten the life cycles of all the devices and components, etc, in other words it can get weird until failure.
you may have decent build but once pushed and it seems you had for some time it finally reached a point of no return.
you really can't trust anything unless it remains at stable default conditions and since it can't do that, it's broke.
heat stress and over-voltage can do that and basically you have to start from scratch to see what it takes to fix.
you can doubt all you want but until you test each item &quot;alone&quot; will you find out and no shortcuts.
it's a time consuming process and you may need new parts anyways besides.
go back to basics and check results, if it can't do that you need a new mtrbd.
and what else???
as always, i replace the psu with a better one just to keep it stable and don't forget to balance the load if it needs that.
