My computer is running slow and I assume that that is what I need to do to make it pick up. My internet is slow (I have shaw Highspeed), programs start slowly, and my computer just doesn't respond as well anymore. Thanks

It is easy and does no harm. If you don't want that - CC Cleaner is another that does no harm and is good, easy to use.

I like Registry Fix (which is not free, but worth the money)--it has a super simple interface, you can customize it, and I have never felt uncomfortable using it. It tells you what it did, asks you if you want to save or repair, and that's it. no scary stuff.

I have been using &quot;RegCure&quot; by Paretologic Technologies for several years without major problems. Also I use in conjuction with it: &quot;System Mechanic Pro 8&quot; by iolo Technologies, CCleaner and a new one I stumbled upon: &quot;NetCom3&quot; which will optimize your registry, search for parasites, and can be used side-by-side with your current Antivirus program. It includes Pop-up Blockers, site guards, system back-up and More !!! The two I like most are System Mechanic (which I've use around 5 years now) It will speed up your internet connection you speak of as well as many other individual utilities within it to keep your computer running in top shape. My Second favorite I used in the last six months or so: NetCom3. A Good Defragmentation program such as &quot;Diskeeper&quot; will help if you do a lot of uninstalling/downloading, ect., like I do. Good Luck....check them out!!!

6351	11	301350	2820081	2820041	mittens	7/26/08 1:54 PM	1.21708044E12	depends	if you tend to download and uninstall a number of programs, apps, and games, uninstall does NOT clean out everything. example: if you have yahoo messenger installed and then 'uninstall&quot; it the right way, and then check in the registry, you will find the entire installation still sitting there, right down to the executable bits. The only way to remove them without a registry cleaner is one at a time, hundreds and hundreds of bits. Every time you download ANYTHING on your computer, when you delete it, it leaves a fingerprint behind in the registry. A cleaner will go after those fingerprints, cleaning out all the loose flappy things that don't belong to anything anymore; dll files, missing files, bits of games and apps you thought you had deleted years ago. They dont do any harm, perhaps, but over time they build up. When I installed RegistryFix, i had about 200 of those things in the registry. Now I get maybe two or three a week, and can manage them nicely.

6351	13	301350	2820636	2812493	i_made_this	7/27/08 1:09 PM	1.21716414E12	There Aren't Any &quot;Good&quot; Registry Cleaners...	...unless you're seriously expert in your technical understanding of the Windows Registry - say, one in one hundred Windows users sort of *expert*. I would not recommend messing with your Windows Registry at all, unless you're *expert*. Items like CCleaner, Registry Cleaner and similar have caused more Blue Screens Of Death (*BSOD*) for Windows users than any other product class that I know of. If you want to get rid of the *gunk* from your system that Windows builds in the temp files / folders, browser caches, etc, try *ATF Cleaner* from http://www.atribune.org But because your system is running noticeably slow, it probably has little to do with some accumulated junk that needs cleaning. The problem - short of a system infection, which others have addressed here - might probably be a hardware-related one. Contact your manufacturer (HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc) with the problem or go to their website. Most of the big manufacturers have system / hardware diagnostics programs and driver update programs for each machine they built. Run these diagnostics programs and make the needed updates recommended on their site. If the machine's still running far too slow after getting your needed and recommended OEM updates, you have to decide whether it's smarter to send it in for repair for whatever they'll charge or whether it's smarter to put it off to the side and invest in a new system.

I believe in registry cleaners. I think you should use them. First, read them carefully and work with settings. second, you should check start menu. maybe there are few softs that start together with the sistem. advanced windows care v2 personal is very good at this. if there are few softs to start with the sistem, they will slow the sistem, of course. good luck!

There are scams out there, sure. But most of it is common sense. My husband, who has never used one, was having a problem with something on the computer that he couldnt resolve. He got CCleaner and cleaned it right out. I am familiar with the registry enough to know how to deal with it, how to stop processes from working, how to clean it by hand. Now and then it's necessary. Too many people, yes, can muck up what they have by seeing funny names in there, and deleting everything in sight. It also helps to understand its purpose, which is to be a repository for every bloody thing that ever crosses your computer window. You have to do your homework. I like mine, my husband likes his. We're comfortable with them both. Frankly NAV caused me more headaches than a Registry Cleaner every has.

My opinion is:before you spend any money on shareware TRY FREEWARE. 1.-Run antivirus:Avast4.8,AVGfree,McAfeeFree,etc. 2.-Defrag.your HD:IOBit smartDefrag 3.-CM DiskCleaner v2.1.7(I've been using it about 4 years)It makes -for you-a restore point of your system before anything.Also has *Disk Cleaner&gt;clean garbage on disks *Applications cleaner&gt;old entries not removed *Optimize RAM *File Eraser&gt;Prevent recovery tools to find delete files *One Clip Clean Up&gt;Clean PC fast & easy Bob:good luck!---By the way:YES!Registry is a delicate issue and I'm not an expert neither but we try to help each other.
6351	17	301350	2822807	2822797	mittens	7/30/08 2:20 PM	1.2174276E12	In a Way..	what you are saying about Registry Cleaners being 'all bad' is probably a holdover from the days when they were new and a bit shaky around the edges. It's also like saying, &quot;my dad had a Chevy truck and it was a lemon' and refuse to even consider another Chevy anything, ever, because someone else had a bad experience. learn from the bad experiences, but don't let it color your own attitudes about stuff to the point where you lose more than you gain by avoidance. And yes, try a freebie that will give you a demo first, look at what they find, do your homework by finding forums for that cleaner, online, and what problems they're having. Dont listen to the hype in the ads. Listen to users.

I recommend that soft but use what you think is the best for you.
