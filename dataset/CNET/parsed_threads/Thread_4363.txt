<s> Built my first computer yesterday, everything was plugged in correctly. </s>
<s> Went to turn on computer the power supply briefly flashes then nothing happens. </s>
<s> I am not sure what is wrong whether it is the Motherboard, PSU, or something else. </s>
<s> I bought an Aspire 500W PSU. </s>
<s> I tried the case PSU same type of thing happened except no LED lights to tell if it turned on. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> Do they sort of &quot;twitch&quot; and stop? </s>
<s> If so, the PS has shut down sensing an overload. </s>
<s> Now it's time to look for what is shorted out. </s>
<s> The best way is to remove the MB from the case and assemble it on a non-metalic surface and see if you can get fans and such to start. </s>
<s> One common problem is extra metal mounting posts that short out something on the rear of the MB. </s>
<s> Another can be poorly seated boards or memory modules. </s>
