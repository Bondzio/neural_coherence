I couldn't hit CTRL-ALT-DEL to restart it so I had to turn it off from the PC. When I turned it back on, my monitor just said &quot;No Signal&quot; I checked the wires to the video card and they were firmly connected. What could the problem be? Please tell me its not the monitor I just bought it a month ago. It's a Hanns-I-Inc by Hanns G, 19 inch. If you need more info. let me know Thanks!
