I am running a Dell Dimension DIM4600 with an Intel Pentium 4 CPU (2.66GHz), 512MB of RAM, and Windows XP Home Edition SP2.
I am looking into upgrading my RAM, so the system will run a bit faster, and for gaming purposes, but I don't know what RAM is compatible and what RAM isn't.
I want to upgrade to either 2GB or 4GB of RAM.
I was wondering if there is a website I can look at that will tell me what is compatible, and what isn't?
Thanks, Arcelios P.S.
: It would be very ideal if I could find something...less than expensive.
