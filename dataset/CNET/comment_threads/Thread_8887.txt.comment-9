Does the file sharing work?
I have never personally done a direct connection thing, but kind of know about it.
If the network is set up then go to My Network Places and the other computer should be there.
Also both domains have to be the same(I think, Again I don't know if you have to on a direct connection) but on a wireless network they have to be the same, to check, right click My Computer and then click computer name, it will say Domain: then whatever is here has to be the same on both comps.
Tell me if that helps!
