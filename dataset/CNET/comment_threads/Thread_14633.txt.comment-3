Okay, so you're saying that the USB hardware was fine, it was just the data that got zapped?
I see your point.
Now, I do know there are some flash drives that have a read only switch, similar to how old floppies worked.
I assume there is no way to make a HDD read-only however?
In that case, it seems that for a safer backup method, flash drive wins in that respect.
