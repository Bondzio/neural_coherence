I have a HP Pavilion 8505, year 1999 model.
It's having a Pentium III 450 Mhz clock and 100 Mhz FSB cpu.
It's a Katmai Slot 1 SECC2 processor.
I want to upgrade the cpu to 800 Mhz.
But i think katmai CPUs have max 600 Mhz clock rate.
Will 800 Mhz Coppermine be compatible with my ASUS P2B-VT Motherboard having Intel 440BX Chipset ?
If no, then would upgrading the RAM from 192 mb to 384 mb (max possible) improve the system performance instead of the above mentioned cpu upgrade ?
