there are a number of things that could be causing your problem it's really a matter of trouble shooting.
here are two painless solutions you can try if you haven't already done so: #1 -download and install vista sp1 (highly recommended) #2 -right click on your network icon in the systray.
-left click on network and sharing center&quot; or -click &quot;start&quot; &gt; control panel &gt; network & internet &gt; network & sharing center -under &quot;sharing and discovery&quot; make sure that &quot;network discovery&quot; is turned &quot;on&quot; if the above don't solve your problem (or you've already done them) we can look at other options.
