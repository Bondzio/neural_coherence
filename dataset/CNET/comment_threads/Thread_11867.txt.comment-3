unless you're willing to upgrade the PSU too.
Some indicate PSUs deteriorate over time so if your PSU is not new, it may be further below the spec than 50 watts.
Make sure to note what connectors the GPU requires so you have the right PSU support.
Mfg specs state &quot;450Watt or greater power supply with 30Amps on 12 volt with 2x4 power connector recommended&quot; http://www1.sapphiretech.com/us/products/products_overview.php?gpid=227&grp=2 VAPCMD
