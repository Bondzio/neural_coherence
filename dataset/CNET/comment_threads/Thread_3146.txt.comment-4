Our research has shown that the less popular brands like Acer, Emachines, etc do have less crapware than Dell, Gateway, etc.
We are testing Toshiba right now.
The downfall we have found is that software that we need like Microsoft Office is not being put on systems (aside from trial versions).
We need the production software but assume this is one way for the distributors to keep the cost down.
The problems with vista we have found are that some software and hardware do not have the correct drivers as of yet.
