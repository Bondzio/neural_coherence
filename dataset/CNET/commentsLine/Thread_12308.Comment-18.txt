in a few more that 20 years, i have experienced two harddrive failures.
both of these were western digital caviar drives.
one drive was on a new computer still under warranty and was replaced by the manufacturer.
the other was an older drive, of unknown history, salvaged from a discarded computer.
that ran for several months after being installed in a pieced together computer before failing.
i have heard similar storied from friends concerning wd drives and have not heard such stories concerning seagate drives.
it is for these reasons that i prefer seagate if that option is available.
