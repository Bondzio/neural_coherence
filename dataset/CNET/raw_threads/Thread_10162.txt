Since then i have not been able to connect to the internet through my router, there are several other machines on the network which dont have a problem connecting. It seems to be nothing to do with the router as i plugged my cable into the back of another pc and the internet ran fine. My TCP/IP settings are such that it obtains an IP adress automatically, but the IP adress it is getting i think is wrong. the other pc's get IP addresses starting 192.168.xx.xx, however mine gets something completely different, in device manager my network card says it is working fine. Please Help Phucbv

Have you tried ipconfig/release, then ipconfig/renew from a command prompt? Alternative is to repair the network connection in Network Properties.

Everytime i've re-formatted i have installed audio and video drivers. I have tried to repair the connection in network properties and it fails to renew the ip address. I didnt know about the ipconfig/release and ipconfig/renew commands, i will try that and see what happens. I have also tried copying the settings from one of the other pc's on the network which can connect to the internet, setting my own ip and gateway and dns etc, with a different ip. When i do this and start up windows explorer to see if it is going to connect it tries for longer before timing out and failing, than when it obtains the ip automatically. Could there be a problem with the network card, even though in device manage it says it is working properly Thanks for helping i've run out of ideas Jules

Or maybe not? Be careful with what you write... As to drivers, many don't understand the driver issues. In short, Microsoft doesn't do them all. We get to do all the drivers when it doesn't work. Seek out those motherboard drivers and when networking, don't install that firewall until you get the network up and working, then flip it on. Bob

3880	7	21993	239495	239431	R. Proffitt	5/7/04 11:40 AM	1.08393E12	Now XP SP1 and if OK with all those lovely patches. A firewall.	The order is important so you know what breaks it again, but with all the pests out there (for XP), you get to download the patches and finally a firewall. Best of continued luck, Bob
