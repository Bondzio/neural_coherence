anytime you have a problem with an external device (printer, memory stick, whatever), first try it in another computer.
if it works there, not only will you have a clue as to where the problem is (probably in a driver), but in the case of storage devices you will have the opportunity to retrieve your data or to copy it to another device that your computer still works with.
