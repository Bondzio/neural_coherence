1.1.1	Hello all , I have a ZData Diamond Digital USB2.0 160GB External Hard Drive .	St
1.1.2	When I check it with Device Manager it tells me & quot ; Maxtor 6 L160P0 USB Device & quot ; so I am assuming that this HDD is manufactured by Maxtor .	St
1.1.3	I have had this for about 9 months and it did its job , with some glitches of its own .	St
1.1.4	But I 've always been able to figure out what was wrong .	St
1.1.5	Now the problem is , as the title suggests , the & quot ; Delayed Write Failed & quot ; message that constantly pops up whenever I try to update my hard drive .	St
1.1.6	It all started today ( although I have experienced this error many times in the past , although a simple system restart of unplug & plug solved the errors ) and it wo n't go away .	St
1.1.7	I 've tried system restarts ( 2X ) , and also tried plugging my cable into alternative USB port ( 4X ) .	St
1.1.8	None of it works .	St
1.1.9	I use SyncToy to update my files .	St
1.1.10	When SyncToy checks for updated files to be copied over it is quick and easy .	St
1.1.11	However when I hit & quot ; Run & quot ; to actually copy the files over then the entire process slows down .	St
1.1.12	Every time the transfer would come to a stalemate at one point or another .	St
1.1.13	Manually copying files also do n't work , as Windows returns me with an error each time .	St
1.1.14	Accessing files in the hard drive is extremely slow .	St
1.1.15	It took the computer about 3 minutes to load a 800X500px PNG image .	St
1.1.16	After the & quot ; Delayed Write Failed & quot ; error pops up the hard drive becomes unusable with all folders gone .	St
1.1.17	My computer is virus-and-spyware-free .	St
1.1.18	I also have USB 2.0 .	St
1.1.19	Processor is Pentium 4 2.8GHz .	St
1.1.20	Can anyone help me or suggest some ways to fix this problem ?	Ques
1.1.21	Thanks in advance .	St
1.1.22	Edwin	St
1.2.1	I opened the command window and since my drive was letter G : I typed this .	St
1.2.2	chkdsk G : /x If it asks & quot ; Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts ?	Ques
1.2.3	( Y/N ) & quot ; I answer yes and then do an orderly reboot .	St
1.2.4	Be sure such drives are NTFS for best results .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks , Edwin	St
