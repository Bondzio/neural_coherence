1.1.1	I just built a custom PC, but have yet to get it to start properly.	St
1.1.2	I have an Intel Core 2 Duo E6400(not positive at the moment if this is the right one)processor, MSI 945GT speedster A4R motherboard, dual slot patriot 2GB memory, and a new power supply and harddrive.	St
1.1.3	I made sure the memory and motherboard were all compatible with the CPU, and the power supply has ample power.	St
1.1.4	When I turn on the computer, an error/ progress screen pops up for a split second and goes away, and does it again every 20 seconds or so.	St
1.1.5	It doesn't stay on long enough to see what it says or get a picture.	St
1.1.6	I tried pressing F1 repeatedly to get to the system setup, but it doesn't respond.	St
1.1.7	I've tried 3 different harddrives, unplugged everything but neccessary components, checked all power and reset plug-ins and nothing has worked.	St
1.1.8	I did notice that I don't have a reset button to hook up, but I don't want to buy one to attach unless it makes a difference.	St
1.1.9	As far as I can tell, it seems like the computer keeps resetting on it's own (not turning off, but recycling to the same screen continuously).	St
1.1.10	I also noticed that the screen is fuzzy when it pops up.	St
1.1.11	Any suggestions would be helpful.	St
1.1.12	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	You've got the wrong motherboard.	St
