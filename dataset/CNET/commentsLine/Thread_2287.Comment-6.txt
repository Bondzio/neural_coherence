go to google and type in belarc, download and run that.
it will tell you what make your motherboard is and if you have any vacant ram slots.if none are vacant go to the maker of the motherboards site and see how much it will take.
the startup programs can be checked by clicking run, type msconfig,click startup and see what programs are running at startup.
if you don't know what they are, write them all down and then go to google and see if they can be removed without causing other problems.
