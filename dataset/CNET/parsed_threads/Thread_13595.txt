<s> ok so I think I REALLY messed up. </s>
<s> I installed a mobo and everything exept for processor, first without spacers and it did nothing. </s>
<s> I noticed and I removed it, put spacers and now all the fans turn on. </s>
<s> But no video or beeping. </s>
<s> Mobo is supposed to recognize when there is or isnt processor. </s>
<s> Did I fry the mobo? </s>
<s> What are tell tale signs of a burnt mobo? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Systems usually don't beep or anything without a processor in it. </s>
<s> Put it all together and test it before half-a$$ing it and complaining about it. </s>
<s> hey flame on... im sure you never worried about a project... </s>
<s> I havent received the processor yet it is being shipped and the reason I put it together with what I had was because I got a really good deal on the mobo and wanted to see if there was some reason for it being so cheap before the return deadline got here. </s>
<s> Just for FYI this link has the mininum componets that are NECESSARY to even apply power to a MB. </s>
<s> The will NOT work without a processor. </s>
<s> &quot; Did I fry the mobo?&quot; Only time will tell!!! </s>
<s> When you get your processor, make sure that you MB is CORRECTLY insatlled and only putin the componets that arer listed in the link and see waht happens. </s>
