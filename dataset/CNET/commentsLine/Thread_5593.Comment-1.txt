i had no problems with the wd drive until this morning.
it is connected to the computer via a usb2 cable.
i turned on the computer.
as the booting was taking place the wd drive powered up but then produced three clicking sounds then a pause then another set of three clicking sounds.
then the power stayed on but it was not attached as a drive (i.e.
it does not appear as a drive and i have no access to the data stored on it).
has anyone run into this problem (and what was the solution then)?
thanks
