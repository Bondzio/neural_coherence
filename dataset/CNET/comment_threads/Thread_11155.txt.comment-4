Since you move it around a lot from machine to machine sometimes you find a busted cable.
DO NOT REPAIR THIS PRINTER!!!
Repair costs will exceed the 65 bucks this printer might be found for.
YES!!!
These printers last about 2 years.
If it fails at or after 2 years what many do is curse HP buy another brand, then that breaks in 2 years they curse that brand and try another.
In about 10 years they'll get it.
