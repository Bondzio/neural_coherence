<s> So, in my pursuit to make myself a &quot;rig&quot;, I've been looking for a way to get 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium for a cheaper price than $200. </s>
<s> That is when I came across OEM software. </s>
<s> On Newegg currently, I can preorder Windows 7 Home Premium OEM for $100 less than retail. </s>
<s> Now, this sounds good and fine and all, but I was under the impression that OEM usually has a catch, like getting another piece of hard/software with it. </s>
<s> But this has no apparent &quot;chain&quot; that comes along with it... could someone clear this up for me? </s>
<s> so I have locked this and the other PC Hardware post, to prevent duplication and confusion. </s>
