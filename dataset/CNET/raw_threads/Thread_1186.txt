Before you even install the new card, get better cooling, this will prevent cooling issues. If possible add extra in any empty fan holes or make them, if capable. There are websites that users also called modders that modify their cases, etc. to get better cooling. Google for modding websites. Here is a website for fan selection and other items: http://www.frozencpu.com Though you didn't mention what psu you have, its VERY IMPORTANT to get a psu that's capable of supporting a hot video card and is able to better cool itself as well with dual fans. This not something to consider but something you need to do, IMHO. tada -----Willy
