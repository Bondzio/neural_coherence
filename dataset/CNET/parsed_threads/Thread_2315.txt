<s> I am trying to decide on a desktop. </s>
<s> Before even picking out the model, I was wondering what your rankings of the companies are. </s>
<s> By choosing a company, I can go from there and buy a specific type. </s>
<s> Please, anyone, make a top list of the best companies out there. </s>
<s> (in your personal opinion of course) Thanks -J </s>
<s> IBM (oops, no more) then Dell, HP etc. </s>
<s> The big problem is that while most makers have fine hardware you might be installing Windows and have issues with Windows, or other software issue. </s>
<s> This is where it all breaks down and you find little support. </s>
<s> If you look at Apple you find a lot less in the virus, trojan, etc so that issue is not a big deal. </s>
<s> Support is better since you deal with just one company for the OS and hardware. </s>
<s> And you pay for what you get... Bob </s>
<s> Really? </s>
<s> May I ask why? </s>
<s> My six have performed flawlessly. </s>
<s> And they've all been refurbed from IBM. </s>
<s> Thankfully they had a great start in life with great products. </s>
<s> Let's hope it continues on. </s>
<s> But they still fail in meeting owner's support needs (Windows.) </s>
