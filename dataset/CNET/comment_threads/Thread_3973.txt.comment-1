AMD K6 450 MHz 160 Gb Maxtor Hard drive 180 Mb SDRAM (PC-100) Plextor (Plex Writer 24/10/40A) CDROM 48X MAX Sapphire Radeon 7000 Video Card With ATI Graphics Creative Soundblaster Sound Card Logitech Digital Cam 3000 Compaq 17&quot; Monitor Running Windows XP Pro with SPI and all Hotfixes to date.
My Windows XP Pro shuts down fine...but instead of the computer shutting off it reboots from the initial black screen we all see at start which give you your primary master/slave and secondary master/slave read outs and tells you to &quot;delete&quot; in order to enter the Bios.
Also my power button does not work.
How can I correct this ?
