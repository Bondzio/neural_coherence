<s> Then 10 screen of the MSI Wind Netbook is an immediate starting point for a number of the users and offers an advantage over many of the other netbooks available. </s>
<s> This size is great as it allows the portability of the product to remain but also ensures the screen is big enough to handle websites comfortably. </s>
<s> As one of the key points of netbooks is to allow internet usage on the go, being able to handle cutting edge web sites is an important factor for any netbook to take care of. </s>
<s> Another important asset is portability and clocking in at 1kg will see the netbook fit into the bag of any user with no great difficulty or weight. </s>
<s> The slightly larger size which facilitates the larger screen also allows for a lager sized keyboard when compared to many other netbooks available on the market which makes it more comfortable for a great number of users. </s>
<s> People who regularly use a PC or full size laptop may find it difficult to switch between their standard keyboard and the netbook option but the MSI Wind Netbook provides a great middle ground for users. </s>
<s> This is indicative of the merging between different computer sizes and soon it will be difficult to tell the difference between a notebook and a netbook but for now, this product is one of the best available. </s>
<s> Good review, Nile. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Quick question: are there different kinds of U135 models out there in regard to batteries? </s>
<s> I'm looking for a netbook and the U135 was rated as one of the higher overall, so when I saw one on &quot;sale&quot; yesterday, I was considering getting it. </s>
<s> Then I checked here on the U135 and found it was priced about $75 cheaper online. </s>
<s> When I looked at the specs on it, I found that it has a 3-cell battery. </s>
<s> But the guy at the store (who seemed to know a bit about it, but of course appearances can be deceiving) told me it was a 6-cell. </s>
<s> I would've thought that a factory model of a computer/laptop/netbook would be been fixed: an MSI Wind U135 has this, and this, and this, period. </s>
<s> But are there different sub-categories within that model? </s>
<s> In short, IS there a U135 with a 6-cell battery, or are they all 3-cell and did I dodge a bullet by passing on the inflated &quot;sale&quot; yesterday? </s>
<s> http://www.msimobile.com/level2_productlist.aspx?search=U135 U135 just indicates what line of netbooks it is. </s>
<s> The numbers following that specify what particular model of netbook is from that line. </s>
<s> So it's possible that two U*** netbooks could have different batteries. </s>
<s> This actually does happen in other series, such as the U123 series. </s>
