You can boot from a Ubuntu disc or flash drive even when you can't boot from your hard drive.
And you can use Ubuntu to examine your hard drive too.
You probably just need to refresh the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the hard drive unless the drive has totally crapped out.
Ubuntu will tell you whether that's the case.
Good luck.
