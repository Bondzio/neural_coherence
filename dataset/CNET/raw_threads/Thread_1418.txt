11314	1	269198	2614051	2614003	Willy	10/24/07 11:18 AM	1.19322468E12	neg volts	saying thats sixty voltages six volts swapped psu problem reduce system bare minimum remove devices etc bare system removeuplug drives least way return devices voltage become stable before doing device seems bring down thats iffy part psu problem blowsup system take down componentsdevices cables etc firmly attachedseated ill check wiring crimps tada willy
11314	2	269198	2614044	2614051	seedpws	10/24/07 11:35 AM	1.1932257E12	yes	yes sixty already swapped psu voltage fine could done damage processor mainboard pc takes forever boot once boots wont play mp without skipping pc locks mp playing until done skip record
11314	3	269198	2614139	2614044	Willy	10/24/07 1:56 PM	1.19323416E12	else	reduce system find bad componentdevice bad voltage damage yoy need troubleshoot tada willy
