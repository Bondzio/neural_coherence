<s> I was shopping around for a new 19&quot; LCD and wanted a decent resopnse time for gaming. </s>
<s> I hit Best Buy to touch/feel and saw the ViewSonic VX910 for 449.00 and thought hmmm, but a 25ms response time would not cut it in CounterStike Source, so I went online and saw on the ViewSonic web site the VX910 has a 16 ms response time...hmm. </s>
<s> I went back to BB and called ViewSonic from there...any LCD made AFTER December is 16 ms. </s>
<s> I gave them the Serial Number of the model on display it was 25 and then the one from the box I was to buy and YIPPIE it was 16!!!!! </s>
<s> So, for that price I am happy . </s>
<s> Any - just an FYI for any gamers looking for a good LCD 19&quot;...it is SO SWEET. </s>
<s> see the Samsung 915N 8 ms and great price!!!!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I was personally gonna say, 16ms is still pretty high.. </s>
