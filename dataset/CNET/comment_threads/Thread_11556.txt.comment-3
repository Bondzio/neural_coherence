obviously i have no idea i guess.
my aircard is a verizon wireless usb internet card.
Which means it is basically a cell phone that dials into the verizon network and then connects to the internet.
I have found a wifi max that says it connects to the usb port and acts as a wifi hub without the need for a router... which is what i was hoping the CNET CNTCUA-854 Wireless USB 802.11-G UBS Dongle was going to do.
but maybe not....
