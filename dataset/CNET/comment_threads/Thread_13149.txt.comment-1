I was looking at the Lite On SOHW-1633S and the Plextor 712A/SA.
The Lite On is $40 cheaper and I wanted to know which one was better.
Both got good reviews on Newegg.
Oh and I was planning on purchasing a Lite On LTR-52327S as a cheap CD-R writer as well.
It also got good reviews so I figured the DVD writer should be good too.
Please help.
Thanks.
