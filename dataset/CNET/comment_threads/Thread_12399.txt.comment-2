OK I can't find the make, model of the laptop so I'll give the short version.
1.
Sony made blu ray.
*hint* 2. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827118046 3.
But to play blu ray we need player software as there is no open source or free version.
Try this -&gt; http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdvd/overview_en_US.html Many laptops use SATA for that drive but with only what I read in this post I can't offer much else.
