they're built like a tank.
i currently have four (two desktops and two laptops), and three others have been given to kids, and all are still working.
ibm has the best on line update service anywhere.
one click and ibm looks at the machine, and recommends updates all the way down to bios updates.
i did have one problem with a laptop (turned out it was my problem), but when i called support the guy was located in atlanta, ga. and he spoke english.
to me, this is worth more than money.
how many threads are started with an ibm problem?
