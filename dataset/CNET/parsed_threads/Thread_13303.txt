<s> Ok so I'm no expert with gaming and computers but I heard that single core chips are good for handling GPUs. </s>
<s> My PC is a 5 year old Dimension with a pentium4 @ 1.47Ghz. </s>
<s> If I added the appropriate GPU, sound card, etc. </s>
<s> could I keep the chip that I have and just overclock it? </s>
<s> This is getting too far down on the pole for me to write it will be fine. </s>
<s> You also have the limited speed AGP slot so I'm going to write &quot;don't bother&quot; on this one. </s>

<s> ...you mean that my pentium4 dell dimension 4500s has no chance. </s>
<s> Therefore, I should get a new desktop or replace the parts inside. </s>
<s> Specs at http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4500S/specs.htm#1101572 But I see the killer issue here. </s>
<s> It's running on the i845 chipset and SDRAM. </s>
<s> While that was a fine value solution back then, this is a DRAG CHUTE on performance of the CPU. </s>
<s> Do not invest more than a &quot;value meal&quot; into this box. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm sure it was around that number. </s>
<s> Anyways, it seems the consensus is to not waste my time which is fine. </s>
<s> I think I'll just get an Xbox 360 instead. </s>
<s> Compared to new video, motherboard, ram, cpu, power supply I bet you'll spend less. </s>
<s> -&gt; From what research I've done be sure your 360 has the HDMI port so you get the latest model. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks I'll make sure...I plan to get the Pro model with the 20 gb harddrive. </s>
<s> The arcade model and elite are too little and too much for my gaming needs. </s>
