Wow, everything you all have said has really given me some things to think about.
.
.maybe making it harder to choose.
That being said, if you took away how &quot;pretty&quot; the Macs are, dollar for dollar, which one is better and gives you more value for your money?
Also, if I did go with a Mac, how easy is it to move information and files from a PC to a Mac?
For those who asked what games I play: Sims2 and soon to play Spore.
Thanks to all who have answered so far
