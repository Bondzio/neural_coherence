1.1.1	I want to upgrade my 1ghz processor .	St
1.1.2	Any recommendations ?	Ques
1.1.3	Soemthing around $ 100 , maybe a Pentium 4 , between 2 and 3 ghz .	St
1.1.4	Also need to know how difficult/simple this is ?	Ques
1.1.5	I 've done quite a few upgrades that were all easy plug and play .	St
1.1.6	Is this the same ?	Ques
1.2.1	That means you likely have a P3 .	St
1.2.2	To upgrade to a P4 , you need a motherboard or hold the P4 , new power supply since it 's quite hungry and the RAM changes too .	St
1.2.3	With all the heat , a new case is fitted .	St
1.2.4	If you were to stick with the P3 , it 's unlikely any real gain of moving to the 1.2GHz would be worth it even if your old machine could support it .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	So is it worth the trouble of going P4 ?	Ques
1.3.2	I do n't have the money to get a new PC .	St
1.3.3	I 've already upgraded to 512 RAM , bought a new DVD burner , 160MB external HD , and 2.0 USB PCI card .	St
1.3.4	So I 'm pretty much at a point of no turning back to buy a new PC .	St
1.3.5	If I could upgrade my processor I 'd be good for a long time and have saved some cash .	St
1.3.6	So mother board , power supply and the processor I understand , but you say I need a new tower case ?	Ques
1.3.7	That 's sound like some work transfering everything over , or did I misunderstand .	St
1.4.1	Information needed to create an informed recommendation : CPU socket type -- & gt ; memory type -- & gt ; Motherboard Mnf .	St
1.4.2	-- & gt ; vendor or custom case -- .	St
1.4.3	P/S wattage .	St
1.4.4	Upgrading the CPU does not automatically increase the speed of the system .	St
1.4.5	The Clock Rate , Data Buss , Address Buss , Memory Type are all factors in overall system speed .	St
1.4.6	Bill	St
1.5.1	neither of them told you the cost of what your talking about a 3.2GHZ Pentium 4 is $ 220 w/o mobo or anything	St
1.6.1	Well , I think most of the items you mentioned you will be able to use them in your mobo , except a few .	St
