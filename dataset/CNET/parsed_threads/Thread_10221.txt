<s> Hello, I have a Dell Latitude D810 laptop with the expansion station. </s>
<s> I am running XP pro with the latest bios which was made in 2006. </s>
<s> In the station there is a PCI slot which i have a PCI-SATA controller card(made by Silicon Image). </s>
<s> I am trying to connect an esata drive to the controller card. </s>
<s> The card is recognized fine by the computer and is running normally. </s>
<s> When i connect the eSATA hard drive, nothing happens. </s>
<s> The computer does not recognize the drive in computer management. </s>
<s> There seems to be NO setting for SATA in the bios. </s>
<s> Nothing in posts or bootup. </s>
<s> What can i do to get this external drive to work? </s>
<s> Like i said, the controller card works, but when the drive is turned on, nothing happens on the computer(blue light comes on the enclosure). </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> The driver for the external case need to be installed then partition and format the harddrive. </s>
<s> Can you see the drive under 'disk management' ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I am connecting VIA eSATA to a PCI-eSATA/SATA card. </s>
<s> I cannot see the drive in disk management. </s>
<s> I am using an internal drive in an enclosure, so i don't think there are drivers for it? </s>
<s> drivers to load ? </s>
<s> Got a link to the product ? </s>
<s> Did you buy from Dell ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> So turns out it is either the Esata port or cord that is not working. </s>
<s> I connected the computer directly to the hard drive with a SATA cable to the SATA port on the card and it worked. </s>
<s> BIOS recognizes the drive as a &quot;modular bay HDD&quot; Weird, but its working. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> is is plugged in and cabled to the PC during bootup ? </s>
