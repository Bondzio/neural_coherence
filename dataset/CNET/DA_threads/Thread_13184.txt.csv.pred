1.1.1	I currently have 3 USB 2.0 hard drives 2x fantom 500gb and a 200gb Seagate in a vantec nexus enclosure .	St
1.1.2	The hard drives all work fine when plugged directly into the computer but i recently purchased a VANTEC UGT-MH401 usb hub and when all the drives are plugged in they are painfully slow .	St
1.1.3	for instance extracting a file with 7zip tops out at 400KB /s .	St
1.1.4	Is this the case with every hub i could purchase or is it a problem with this particular hub .	St
1.1.5	it advertises that it has & quot ; Downstream ports have automatic connect and speed detection function plus over-current protection with auto-recovery & quot ; which i am not sure if that would be a problem this is the product page http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817392005 on newegg .	St
1.1.6	any help is appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Seen that .	St
1.2.2	Little to do but try another make and model .	St
1.2.3	My fix at home was to add a 4 port USB 2.0 PCI card .	St
1.2.4	That was same or as much money as your hub .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	thats what i was thinking i bought the hub to souley to clean up the appearance of the front of my case .	St
1.3.2	also i got the hub because it is externally powered and does n't suck power from my PSU i am not sure if it matters since the hardrives are externally powered themselves though .	St
