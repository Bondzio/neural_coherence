Hi there everyone, this is my first post, so bear with me if I mess up (I'm sure many of you have heard that plenty of times before lol...) Anyways, I'm planning on building a new computer, and I want to get a Nvidia GeForce 9800 GTX graphics card.
I know it's a two slot card, and I know that I only need 1 PCI-Express 2.0 slot to use it, but I don't know whether or not there needs to be a second PCI slot next to it for it to rest on.
If it does, will the motherboard I'm getting work?
I want to get an Asus P5QL-EM Intel G43 Socket 775 Motherboard (from TigerDirect.com).
If you need any more info, just ask.
Thank you!
