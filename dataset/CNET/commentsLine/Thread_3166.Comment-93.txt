this formula never fails; the life of a hard drive is directly proportional to the amount of really important stuff you have on it and inversely proportional to the length of time since you've last backed it up.
therefore, if you have every family photo you've ever taken, every song in your collection (many only available on that drive) and all of your important personal business documents on the drive and you haven't backed up, raided, or immaged it off in, say, about a year....stand back!
that sucker's toast!
