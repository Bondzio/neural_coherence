i always ask first, &quot;what's your budget?&quot; that way, i can give a more reasonable response.
anyway, you can find lots of microatx boards with 10/100 ethernet and 5.1 sound onboard that just may support what you want ('cept for digital out.)
my daughter's system has it.
jmho, but i'd get a dvd burner to ensure compatibility with the various types of media you want read- most cd-rom/dvd players wont guarantee playback of so many different types of media, and dvd-burners are so cheap now, i think it'd be worth the extra $20.
circuit city is forever running sales on large capacity hardrives- i think i got my 250 gig western digital for about $80 after rebate, and for $15, i purchased an extened 3 yr. warranty from wd.
i think you should go for at least 512 megs of ram if you're running xp-if you want to go cheap, you'll find it at newegg.
however, when it comes to ram, i'd rather go with a name brand like crucial or samsung; 512 goes for around $90.
i had a g-force 4 with 64 megs of memory that had excellent output for vids...think it was made by chaintech.
if you're not going to be rendering video or anything, i think you'd do fine with a 1.5 ghz.
personally, if i were to go small form factor, i'd go with a shuttle type case instead of the flat case.
i'd want just that little bit of air-flow.
if your intent is to have a simple media box, i think it's doable for around $500- or possibly less; newegg sells refurb parts.
just my 3 cents.
