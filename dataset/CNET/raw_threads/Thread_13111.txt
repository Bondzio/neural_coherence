I have a Mac OS X computer that I need to get online with for a specific task. The Mac doesn't have a wireless card. If I run an ethernet cord connecting the Mac to the router, will I be able to get online? Also will this mess up my Vista machine getting online at all(not sure if the WRT310N can simultaneously allow Macs and Windows machines to be online at the same time). Thanks for your help.
