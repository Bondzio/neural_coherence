<s> When I upgraded my RAM to 3 Gig yesterday, I took notice of the specs of the PSU (Bestec ATX 300 12E REV DR). </s>
<s> From reading various posts on this site as well as the PC mag &quot;Games for Windows&quot; (12/06), I saw many reccomendations calling for upgraded PSUs in light of higher spec requirements with Vista and Directx 10 in the near future. </s>
<s> I was not even considering the possibility of upgrading the PSU until this AM when my computer went to &quot;stand by&quot; mode while playing GTA SA 2nd edition (which is full of bugs to begin with). </s>
<s> My computer has sometimes crashed to the windows screen before, but never to stand by mode. </s>
<s> So, I am guessing I may need a new PSU. </s>
<s> But I do not have the first clue on how to choose one that matches my system. </s>
<s> There was a very informative article, http://www.firingsquad.com/guides/power_supply/page3.asp that I read, but I am now more confused than ever. </s>
<s> I guess I assumed that more watts would be better. </s>
<s> I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me first of all is a new PSU needed? </s>
<s> And if so, which one would be right for my system? </s>
<s> I really hate Gateway and I am scared that a PSU bought online won't fit their case or match their motherboard etc. </s>
<s> It would help too if you can explain it to me in really simple terms too. </s>
<s> I really don't want to take to a dealer. </s>
<s> I was hoping to make a high end gaming machine out of my PC while I take a break from console gaming (plan to re-visit the PS3 vs Xbox360 war again in a year or 2.) </s>
<s> Thanks again for any help/info you can provide. </s>

<s> Thanks again...James </s>
<s> My guess without looking is you're way underpowered. </s>
<s> The question is whether you can use a generic PSU or something proprietary to GATEWAY. </s>
<s> Here's one of the BEST PSU mfgs made...it doesn't list GATEWAY as a mfg but I'm sure they can tell you if they make a unit that works with your PC as configured. </s>
<s> It's definitely worth a call. </s>

<s> Thanks, I'll give that a try </s>
<s> I did go the ATI site. </s>
<s> It said that particular card requires &quot; a 400 Watt power supply or greater, 25 AMPs, 12 volt rail reccomended (assumes fully loaded system); For CrossfireTM 550 watt power supply or greater, 38 AMPS, 12 volt rail&quot; I don't know if I should be feeling really angry or really stupid. </s>
<s> I mean when I bought the system at Best Buy last summer, the BB employee and I must have talked for an hour or so about getting a &quot;high end gaming machine&quot; and it was he who suggested that card be bought with the system. </s>
<s> And it alone is 100 volts over the Gateway PSU's 300 watt supply?! </s>
<s> I will admit I do not know much about technology/electronics, but how have I been using the PC all this time with relatively few problems? </s>
<s> I don't know if I should blame Best Buy or Gateway. </s>
<s> I feel like I would have never known to even ask about the PC's internal power supply specs and whether or not it would be compatible with the system they sold to me. </s>
<s> It just makes me mad. </s>
<s> I think you should get what you are told you are buying. </s>
<s> But at least I have learned a little more and know what to ask in future. </s>
<s> I will call PC Power & Cooling tomorrow abnd see what can be done. </s>
<s> I hope they will have good news as I have invested so much $$$$ already. </s>
<s> Thanks again...James </s>
<s> and sold the system that way. </s>
<s> If anyone is to blame . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> I'd say it's the salesperson at BB. </s>
<s> Not so much for suggesting the upgrade card but for not telling you about the additional power requirement and affect if any on the system warranty. </s>
<s> If it's any comfort ...you're not alone. </s>
<s> This happens often as people buy PCs off the shelf and afterwards start adding stuff. </s>
<s> At some point the system starts showing signs of instability or spontaneous reboots, etc., Let us know how it works out. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Hey VAPCMD, I did contact PC Power and Cooling as you suggested. </s>
<s> Unfortunatley, they did not have a model for my Gateway PC. </s>
<s> I did contat Gateway who sell a series of Startech PSUs ranging from about 300 to 550 watts. </s>
<s> If I remember right the 550w startech was about 68-69$ (seems kinda of budget/low end to me). </s>
<s> The tech at gateway assures me that these PSUs will work with the PC I got. </s>
<s> But I thought I would try to enlist some help before I buy. </s>
<s> So far I have not found any pages to find a review of startech although I am still looking. </s>
<s> If you need to see the specs, this is the link to the PSUs that gateway sells/reccomends: http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/PC+Components_316805/Power+Supplies_316811/Default.htm Thanks for any help you can give...James </s>
<s> James... Based on the info from GATEWAY, here's what I located on the 550 PRO and before I forget .. the GATEWAY price is as good as any I've seen. </s>
<s> Looks like this is the Startech SKU ATX2PW550PRO and here's the web site. </s>
<s> Not sure what the warranty is from GATEWAY but warranty thru retail chains is 3 years. </s>
<s> Given the price and the GATEWAY recommendation . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> I'd go for it. </s>
