i'm just looking into this stuff, what new chip is coming out in a few weeks causing the price drop?
end of july we talkin?
ok i just got back into looking at things and thought that am2 was going to be the new standard, either way i thought it was better than 939. i'm not interested in overclocking right away atleast, possibly down the road.
ill check with abit, as well as asus.
i really want a highly rated board.
what is the difference between an opteron and the other chip i was looking at like the 4200 manchester or windsor.
a lot better chip?
will i notice a performance difference?
i don't know anything about them compared to the ones i was looking at.
i see price wise it's just about the same.
i appreciate the help, thanks, ~j
