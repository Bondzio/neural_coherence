Has anyone on the forum bought or used the Toshiba Thrive?
I have been waiting for a tablet that has USB2, HDMI and a SD slot and it appears the Thrive has them all plus a replaceable battery.
Before I retired I worked for a Toshiba dealer, but that was Key Telephones and PBX systems and those systems were excellent... That is the reason my laptop is a Toshiba, just because of the name.
I plan on going to Bestbuy tomorrow as they now have them in stock and I can get a hands on one, but would like to get some thoughts if anyone has used one.
Thanks Wayne
