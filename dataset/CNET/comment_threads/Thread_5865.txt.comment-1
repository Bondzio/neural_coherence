Ok here is my question.
I have an Emachiene T5212 ( http://reviews.cnet.com/eMachines_T5212/4507-3118_7-32085027.html?tag=sub ) and the specs say it has a max Video RAM of 128MB.
I was hoping to put in a direct x10 video card, but now it doesnt seam to be possiable.
My question is, can I add 2 video cards each having 128MB or can my computer only handle a total od 128MB, and does anyone have any suggestions on a good card.
Thanks!!!!!
!
