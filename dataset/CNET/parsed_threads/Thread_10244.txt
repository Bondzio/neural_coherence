<s> PLEASE HELP. </s>
<s> I have a desktop with the following configurations: AMD Sempron 2500A CPU, ECS KT600A motherboard, and Antec 1650B Case. </s>
<s> I have used my old PC 2100 256 Meg SRAM, and 160 Gig Wester HD, plus my old CD-RW. </s>
<s> Everything is working OK....BUT when I burn anything onto a CD, half way into it, the &quot;NERO OEM EXPRESS 6.0&quot; says the &quot;burn&quot; has failed. </s>
<s> YET, the blank CD is half way done. </s>
<s> I ignored the problem becuase I wanted to buy a DVD+RW and so I bot &quot;Microadvantage DVD+-RW (16X, 4X, 48X DUAL)&quot; and installed it as master with my CD burner as slave. </s>
<s> However, as I was buring my data onto a DVD+RW disc, again it failed. </s>
<s> Now it doesn't even recognize that the disc is in it. </s>
<s> And my CD doesn't even recognize any of my discs and data on them. </s>
<s> I played around with all that I know, but no luck. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP, Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I'm assuming that your using XP. </s>
<s> Did Nero give you any error msg? </s>
