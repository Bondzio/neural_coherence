Let me explain: I can log only one MAC address at time. So I changed my MAC address of the router to match that of the computer so that the ISP connection would be 'fooled' into thinking it was the same machine. However, after I use the internet through the router for a few minutes, my connection is terminating because my 'port has multiple MAC addresses.' I can try using it as an access point, but i have trouble establishing an IP. (the ISP already has DCHP) Help!! This is weird....
