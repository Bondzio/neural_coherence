well, you pulled the battery should have reset the bios to defaults.
leave it out for 10-15 minutes cnext time to absoluty sure and unplug the system too.
find the cmos clearing pins/pads in order to use them as a last resort.
if the problem persists, yeah it maybe your mtrbd.
but the cpu could have fried.
this is the result of oc'ing as may have noticed.
try the above and see if it can come alive, another cpu or test it elsewhere.
you can also check the mtbd.
for blown caps or bludging ones as that can happen from a known problem 18-24mos.
ago of weak caps.
good luck -----willy
