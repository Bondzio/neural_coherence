<s> I bought a Sony Vaio about 2 weeks ago and yesterday the wireless card randomly died. </s>
<s> The tech people at Sony said the only option was to send it in for repair (or return it to the store if possible.) </s>
<s> My question is what could have caused this to happen? </s>
<s> I ask because 1) I don't want it to happen on my next one and 2) my dad, of course, blames it on something that I must've done on the internet. </s>
<s> He thinks that the fact that I watch streaming videos somehow killed my wireless card, never mind the fact that I am typing on a 4 year old laptop on which I have streamed videos for 4 years and never had a problem. </s>
<s> What are some real reasons why this may occur? </s>
<s> Does it have anything to do with Vista? </s>
<s> Bad from the factory. </s>
<s> Wrong drivers. </s>
<s> Computer NOT updated. </s>
<s> Wireless router NOT setup correctly. </s>
<s> Using peer to peer programs, like Limewire, Bearshare, etc. </s>
<s> Firewall settings. </s>
<s> In some cases, the problem can be fixed by asking in the forums. </s>
<s> People here have great knowledge and are very helpful. </s>
<s> The only thing the people ask for at CNET is that you read the words that were in red before you posted that said... </s>
<s> Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended. </s>
<s> That;s NOT asking a lot for some help. </s>

<s> it likely there's no way to find out and no cause to think it had anything to do with your using it. </s>
<s> The device has a lot of very small electronic components and the tiniest undetected defect can be a fatal flaw. </s>
<s> Many will tell you that a lot of electronic parts failures will occur early on and that, if this doesn't happen, you can expect a reasonable life from them. </s>
<s> With age, the failures pick up again. </s>
<s> So, the failure rate is high with new and old components with a long plateau of good service in between. </s>
<s> It just happens....not a thing to worry about. </s>
<s> It's why there are warranties. </s>
