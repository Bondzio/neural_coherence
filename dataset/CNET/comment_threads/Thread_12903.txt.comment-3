You are not alone with this problem, it happens in a variety of systems.
Unfortunately there seem to be no real fix for this problem other than rebuilding windows from scratch.
There is however a simple work around to it, you just need to run Windows Explorer or double cilck my computer and then the CD drive and double click the setup file.
The file that does the setup can vary from Autorun.EXE to Setup.exe or possibly some other file, you just search the main folder of the CD for a .EXE file that you can double click on to run the setup.
