I only have a recovery for my Compaq and the Windows XP Home is before SP2.
And before all the updates that I did.
What I'd like to do is to put the windows folder and system files on the CD and be able to boot from it if I wanted to.
I would to have the latest updated XP as my backup.
I'd really like to avoid going back to XP Home before SP1 with absolutely no upgrades or updates at all if I had some problem to face in the future.
I appreciate your reply.
I'm sorry I didn't clarify my reasons clearly.
with appreciation ron
