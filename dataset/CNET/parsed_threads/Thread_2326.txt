<s> I just had verizon come in and set up my wireless network at home. </s>
<s> I'm running two laptops on it and would like to run my printer through the router. </s>
<s> The printer is hooked up and the router recognizes that something is plugged into the ethernet port, but the ping test always fails. </s>
<s> I've tried adding the printer as a standard TC/IP setting, but the computer can't find the printer (I suppose because it's not communicating with the router properly). </s>
<s> Printer: HP Laserjet 2840 Laptop: Windows Vista Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Networking this printer would be a great help. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Have you set your printer's IP to be in the same range as your network IPs? </s>
<s> Does the printer's subnet mask match your network's mask? </s>
<s> Usually these are set from the printer's front panel, but you'll need to refer to the manual for actual adjustment. </s>
<s> Thanks, Sunwatcher, I set the printer's IP & Subnet mask to the one's assigned by the router, but still can't get the printer to ping. </s>
<s> response. </s>
<s> Have you been able to setup your HP 2840 after you got the IP address issue? </s>
<s> I have similar problem. </s>
<s> I have setup HP2840 printer with IP address and subnet mask as per my router configuration but I can't ping it. </s>
<s> I am using XP. </s>
