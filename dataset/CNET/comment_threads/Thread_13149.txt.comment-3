I bought a Lite On 1633S because it was cheaper and I stupidly forgot that one gets what they pay for.
I bought it on a Thursady; it was dead by Sunday morning.
Aside from quality issues, the Plextor comes with Roxio, while the Lite On comes with Nero.
Nero is not an acceptable substitute for Roxio, so - case closed!
Plextor!
