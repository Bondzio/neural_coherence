<s> ok, i know someone else has two things just like this, but i read them and they are not the same situations. </s>
<s> I did NOTHING to my computer, i merely opened it up to clean some dust off of it and that is all. </s>
<s> Then when i went to plug the cable in and press the button, nothing happened. </s>
<s> Nothing happened AT ALL, no start up, nothing on the monitor. </s>
<s> The only thing i heard was an ear-piercing kinda of beep coming from the power supply. </s>
<s> Does this mean i need to get a new power supply or something? </s>
<s> or what should i do? </s>
<s> I already checked all opf the connections and everything was connected fine and no problems with it at all, so i dont know what to do. </s>
<s> Usually I unplug a few items and give it another try, but if it shows no lights, fans, beeps, I strip it down to motherboard and the power supply. </s>
<s> I don't remove the CPU if it's an Athlon for this test. </s>
<s> If no power then I'm looking at the possible 2 to 3 bad parts. </s>
<s> If it's an Athlon and there is no power up, its time to remove the CPU. </s>
<s> If it powers up without the CPU, then it's another melted CPU... Bob </s>
