I have 2 separate dsl lines the original phone line is capable of dsl and phone usage, the second is a dedicated dsl line.
Both lines are connected to two seperate 2 wires...
I have 2 computers connected to the first line and a Wii, Xbox 360 connected to the 2nd line.. My question is every since I got the second line I have drops in connection ALOT, are these two lines interfering with each other?
I can only access one of the routers configuration page, if I try to access the other from another computer I have to shut the other 2 wire off... any insight into this matter would be greatly appreciated...
Thank you
