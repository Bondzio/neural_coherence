<s> I have Creative 5200 5.1 speakers connected to a Creative Audigy 1 sound card. </s>
<s> I'm running Windows XP Pro and use Windows Media Player. </s>
<s> I've noticed that my subwoofer doesn't sound so good when playing some Hip-Hop mp3s. </s>
<s> So I tried unplugging the Center/LFE connector and I noticed that my subwoofer was still working! </s>
<s> I unplugged the rear speakers connection and still, the subwoofer was working. </s>
<s> I realized that I get subwoofer sounds from each connector, each connector would make the subwoofer more powerful. </s>
<s> The speakers sound fine though. </s>
<s> So my question is if this is normal or could there be something wrong? </s>
<s> Could someone please confirm if the subwoofer is supposed to react to all three connections or just the center/LFE connector? </s>
<s> Most MP3s are stereo and will be 2.0 (stereo) or 2.1 (adds bass center?) </s>
<s> capable. </s>
<s> Owners of 5.1 systems will have complaints like yours. </s>
<s> There is no easy fix here since even a AudioCD may not sound as good as real 5.1 content. </s>

<s> That makes sense, never thought about the state of mp3s. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I guess the only way to make mp3s sound better is if I had a player capable of up-converting 2.0 sound into 5.1 sound, but even that's not guaranteed to fix the problem. </s>
<s> http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/mad-plugin/ While it didn't enable 5.1 output it seems to sound better at times. </s>
<s> Your ears may want to try it out. </s>

<s> I don't mean to be picky, but is there such a plugin for windows media player? </s>
<s> I don't use Windows Media Player. </s>
<s> Various reasons. </s>
