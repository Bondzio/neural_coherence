1.1.1	I recently purchased a new computer and I 'm curious as to how good/bad it is ?	Ques
1.1.2	How long before I will have to replace it ?	Ques
1.1.3	The websites I viewed gave me mixed answers .	St
1.1.4	CPU - AMD Athlon 64 3400+ Motherboard - GA-K8NS Pro nForce3 250 Video Card - Geforce FX 5700 LE ( 256MB DDR ) Harddrive - 80 gbs Memory - 512 mbs pc3200 400mhz ( Planning to upgrade soon ) Those are the basics .	St
1.1.5	I did n't include the DVD/CD-RW drive cause I 'm lazy .	St
1.1.6	But that is much easier to upgrade than a processor and motherboard .	St
1.2.1	Opinions are based on judgements , judgements are based on values , no two people share exactly the same values , therefore the opinion of others can only be useful if you know the values upon which they based their opinions .	St
1.2.2	IF it does what you want it to do , and you are happy with it , it is good , and may remain that way for many years .	St
1.2.3	Do n't fall into the trap of & quot ; mine is bigger than yours & quot ; .	St
1.2.4	OTOH , if it does n't make you happy , and you genuinely need more power , then , and only then , consider an upgrade .	St
1.3.1	Sorry .	St
1.3.2	Let me be more clear .	St
1.3.3	How long before my computer will not meet the min requirements for games ?	Ques
1.4.1	Doom 3 for example if all the features are turned on , already outstrips any machine made today .	St
1.4.2	So this is a never ending quest .	St
1.4.3	You may have to be happy with your selection .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	First thing I did when I got this computer was installing Doom 3 .	St
1.5.2	The recomended graphics level for the game was high , but if I increased my ram it would have been ultra .	St
1.5.3	Anyway , my revised question is how long will it be before my computer is just as useless ( gamewise ) as a 1gh processor today ?	Ques
