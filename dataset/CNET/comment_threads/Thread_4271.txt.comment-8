thanks for the info Bob, i've orsered one of these, but still don't understand how it can help with a audio and video problem while playing a cd or dvd from either player.
One is a Pioneer dvd rw and the other is a samsung cdrw drive.
But like i said i can put these in another computer and they work fine--thanks
