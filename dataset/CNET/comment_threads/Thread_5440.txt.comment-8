I will probably just get a new motherboard.
This is what I came up with to upgrade: Processer: AMD phenom x4 quad core, Motherboard: MSI k9A2 platinum, Power supply: corsair Model:wpsu-75otx I am going to get a new power supply because the one I have isn't powerful enough, and new memory ocZ platinum DDR2 1066.
I will reuse my graphics card the radion 9800.
Will this setup be compatible and be stable?
