1.1.1	I was all set on getting the 6250 emachine when i called dell to see what they would do .	St
1.1.2	They claim they can give me a similarly configured 4700 ( i know they say its not sold anymore and they did not mentioned it was refurbished ) for $ 100 more than the emachine .	St
1.1.3	The only real difference is the Hard drive 160 dell vs. 200 emachine .	St
1.1.4	Anyone have any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	If it 's not sold any more and they have one ?	Ques
1.3.2	Sounds like it 's a refurb to me .	St
