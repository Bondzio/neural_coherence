bob; i wasn't aware of any win xp home limitation on hard drive size (my win xp-equipped laptops' drives have all been less than 120gb.)
for my last desktop, a win98se machine, i purposely stayed at 120mb for a replacement drive but i had thought that the windows xp service packs 1 & 2 took care of that.
(  seems to imply that.)
or are you saying that geehon1999 has a pre-service pack edition of xp?
- 'appreciate all your help in answering all these posts - i learn a lot.
