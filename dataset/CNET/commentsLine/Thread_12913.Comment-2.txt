esd precautions i don't see much need to try to engage people you don't know in this type of discussion when you can get this much information with a few keystrokes and mouse clicks.
the idea here, imo, should be to become resourceful on one's own in small matters such as these.
these forums are great when it comes to sharing problems and solutions from one's own personal experiences but, if i were you, i'd not try to use them as a training ground.
you'll retain more of what you learn when it comes from personal discovery than by being tutored.
