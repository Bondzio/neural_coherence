would love to find a laser printer that works with refilled cartridges (trying to be green) or at least has cartridges with such high yield that you don't mind paying for them every once in a while.
it's a small office, we probably print less than 50 sheets a day and do not require color printing.
we are switching to laser due to running through our print cartridges so quickly with the inkjet and being fed up with printers not working with refilled or refurbished cartridges.
if you have a suggestion for or against any laser, we would appreciate it!
