Not sure if this matters but maybe I should mention that there won't be a router in the house.
We're moving to a new house and won't be setting up our own wireless network for a while.
It'll just be our laptops.
We need for our laptops to pick up a broader range of signals than they usually do (rural area).
So a repeater should do the trick?
