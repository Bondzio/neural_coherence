<s> I own an external hard drive, its a Toshiba. </s>
<s> I don't remember the exact model, but its the one that has a solid background and 5 two toned &quot;curves&quot; on the top of the drive. </s>
<s> Here: http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&q=toshiba+500gb+external+hard+drive&biw=1503&bih=562&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=15968665362581317533&ei=Dz4DTcvcHMb_lges4onVCQ&sa=X&oi=product_catalog_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CIgBEPMCMAk# Anyway, this is a two part question for all you pro's out there. </s>
<s> First off, Ive had this for quite awhile and I have, well, my entire life on it. </s>
<s> I know. </s>
<s> Its not the best thing in the world to depend on something that COULD potentially break but thus far it has been fine. </s>
<s> Recently, however, it stopped getting &quot;read&quot; on my laptop. </s>
<s> The little notification still comes up that I &quot;attached&quot; something to the USB. </s>
<s> And I can still see (and use) what's on the External, BUT only if I directly go to start/computer/E drive. </s>
<s> I used to be able to listen to my music on WMP when my settings were attached to my E/my music drive. </s>
<s> Not anymore. </s>
<s> It wont even recognize it. </s>
<s> I had attached some program icon short cuts to my taskbar, and even those are &quot;invalid&quot;. </s>
<s> I click on them and it tells me that the disk cannot open because its write protected. </s>
<s> No its not. </s>
<s> Unless somehow it went protected! </s>
<s> How do I check for this and has anyone else had anything like this happen? </s>
<s> How do I fix it? </s>
<s> Can I fix it? </s>
<s> Second part of the question: If I bought a new external hard drive, can I um, transfer everything from the old external to the new one? </s>
<s> Is it a pain in the butt? </s>
<s> I cant see how I would go about this, but I am sure there is some way around it. </s>
<s> Hopefully you lovely ladies and gents can help me out, because as you can imagine, this is starting to worry me. </s>
<s> All my business stuff is on that drive so if it breaks... *gulp*. </s>
<s> BTW I just saw the other post on being able to transfer from and to a new and old drive. </s>
<s> So, dont answer that. </s>
<s> But, it did bring up another thought, for the past month or so, every time I even remotely BUMP my external, the &quot;ding&quot; noise happens and the notification pops up that the drive has been re-attached or whatever it says. </s>
<s> I wonder if all these problems are simply being caused by the wire?!? </s>
<s> That would be crazy! </s>
<s> Can I buy JUST the wire? </s>
<s> Shop for a new cable. </s>
<s> Don't bump it and get your files safe again! </s>
<s> Okay, does anyone know the name of the cable or any links to the cable or anything like that? </s>
<s> Mine is super short. </s>
<s> It looks like this one http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/adet.to?poid=450276 but its not 4 foot. </s>
<s> Is it essential to buy Toshiba? </s>
