<s> I took a glance at my old motherboard, and I noticed that it has some DDR RAM in it. </s>
<s> The pink sticker (this was a built computer, so the various parts have pink stickers labeling them) says it's PC266 32x64 256MB DDR RAM. </s>
<s> I was wondering... could I possibly use this in conjunction with my PC3200 512MB DDR RAM? </s>
<s> I checked out the slot with the 256 stick, and it'd fit in there if I put it in, but I don't know if it's compatible with the motherboard, or maybe with the other RAM. </s>
<s> Two other things about the 512 stick - it's Kingston, and it's 184 pin (the 256 probably is 184, too, because it fits). </s>
<s> My new motherboard is an ASUS K8N motherboard, AMD processor, etc. </s>
<s> More info needed, please ask. </s>
<s> Thanks, -Christopher </s>
<s> bus will now only run at the speed of the slower memory [133/266 rather than 200/400. </s>
<s> Possibly the 255 stick could be overclocked, but only by a skosh. </s>
<s> Just my two cents, but I'd ditch the 266 in favor of the 512 mb of pc 3200. </s>
<s> 512 mb is enough memory for almost any operation in xp. </s>
<s> You'll get better overall performance. </s>
<s> If your a gamer, you can add more ram later. </s>
<s> Okay, thank you both much... </s>
<s> I know that 512's enough, I was just wondering if it was worth it to use the extra stick of RAM, but I kind of figured that the overall performance would be better without the slower stick, as Stan said, though I knew there'd be no harm in asking. </s>
<s> Thanks again, good day to you all. </s>
