When you say screen looked like safe mode do you just mean that that the resolution got very small, making icons big or were there other indications you were in safe mode such as some devices not working or did it say safe mode?
If the former, it might be just the screen resolution setting.
Did you try to change the screen resolution using the controls for the graphics card?
Was the ASUS X850 Extreme an AGP card?
