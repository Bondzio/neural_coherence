The problem is I lost the installation CD. I've tried to find a similar driver in the internet but failed. So I was wondering if u guys know where to download a universal USB to IrDA driver because I do not know the manufacturer of the device. I'm using Win XP SP2 and a Nokia 6610i phone. Thanx.

I would try BELARC ADVISOR (google please) and EVEREST at http://www.lavalys.com/news.php?article=31&selcat=PR&lang=en to sniff out what it is. I have seen USB to IrDA devices at geeks.com as well as other places so finding a new one could be under 20 bucks. If it's not worth 20 bucks to fix? Bob
