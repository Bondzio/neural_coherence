I already have the wireless router set up (it's a cheap but still useful eHome 802.11 b/g router). Both the host (desktop) computer and the intended laptop that's trying to connect are running Windows XP Pro. Unfortunately, I only have admin privileges on the host computer, on the laptop I'm not sure what I am. When I go to the control panel the all I can access is: Accessibility Options, Display, Keyboard, and Mouse. I also don't have the run option in the start menu so I can't go check the user settings that way either. Anyways, I set up a home network using the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard. It made me make a floppy disk at the end so that I could run the same thing on the laptop. But, when I try to run it the laptop says, that the laptop belongs to a domain and thus the wizard cannot setup a network. I now believe that the laptop is just connecting to the internet through the host computer as I set up a shared folder but the laptop cannot see it. Thus, any advice as to how to get the laptop to either see the shared folder, or even better, how to add the printer (which is connected to the host computer) to tghe laptop would be appreciated. It should be noted that when I go to the &quot;Add Printer Wizard&quot; on the laptop I can go through all of that stuff but I cannot find the URL of the printer to add directly nor can the laptop browse to find the printer. Thanks for the help, I know that this is complicated.

I find most don't complete the wizard or don't know about firewalls or that the printer driver may have to be installed before the share is connected to. Sometimes I have to install the printer per the maker's instructions and connect the USB port directly before I go across the network. XP has added obstacles regarding accounts and more. In this discussion http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=198031&messageID=2129068 we cover all this and more. As this has almost every aspect covered I'll leave it to you to go over the networking, shares and firewalls we discussed before. Bob
