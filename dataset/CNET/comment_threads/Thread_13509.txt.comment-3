If you are referring to whether or not I took the cover off to let more air in, well not exactly.
I did take my cover off becuase I was looking for a noising fan (what I thought was the problem), and even with the cover off and a new fan, the computer was still shuting down.

I do not have a spare video card 3.
While I know how to plug my parts in, I guess I don't know what it means to balance the rails or how to balance the rails.
Can you provide more information?
