I have looked at some of the larger commercial companies as well as smaller ones like Velocity Micro. I would like the following in my PC:&lt;div&gt;i7 processor Blu-Ray drive (dont need to write Blu-Ray, combo with DVD-R preferred) Decent 1-2 GB video card that supports HDMI Upmarket sound card (3 mm OK, RCA preferred) TV Tuner (not as familiar with these, but HDMI compatibility is a must) 1 TB HD or better Bluetooth compatibility on the wireless card My budget is between $1000-1500. I am a bit overwhelmed by the options available these days not to mention the company websites are so-so at describing the options available on customization. I primarily want to hook this PC up to my LCD tv and use it as a conduit for TV, music and streaming media. Also, reliability of the product is important. I was interested in VM initially but some of the reviews I had read were not so supportive. I like the smaller brands due to the lack of BS software that comes pre-loaded with them. Thanks in advance for the advice! &lt;/div&gt;

I have been using a desktop from 2004 until recently because I got it with, at the time, overkill ram and video. I also do game from time to time, especially the Total War series with large unit numbers, which eats up memory.

For example, no more cable cards and cable companies moving to all digital encrypted content. At least these cards are $$ and not $$$. In your case, you lead off with a post that gives all the signs you should build it yourself. Bob
