i would go with either the kindle fire, the acer, or the lenovo ideapad.
however, if the 13 year old would like a camera on the tablet, then don't get the kindle fire since it has no cameras.
i know the lenovo has both a front and rear camera and is the same price as the kindle fire.
unless one roots the kindle or the nook, i think, they only have access to either amazon's or b&n&quot;s app stores.
the acer and lenovo have access to the android market.
one can also install the kindle and nook readers on these to read their books and such.
