<s> Greetings. </s>
<s> For over a year, I have been using dual EVGA 9800GTS's in SLI mode. </s>
<s> Even tried 3 at one time, did not do much to improve anything. </s>
<s> I just removed the 9800's and installed daul EVGA 250GT's with 1gig ram each. </s>
<s> In BoarderLands now running the 250's, I am seeing some latency that was not there with the 9800's! </s>
<s> I was under the assumption that the 250's were a step up from the 9800's which only have 512m each. </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> But the performance overall could be less as more QUALITY in the rendering could eat up any gain in the GPUs. </s>
<s> In otherwords, 2 steps forward and 2 steps back. </s>
<s> I'd expect a better looking display but no gains. </s>

<s> 250GTS is the same CPU as a 9800GTX. </s>
<s> the extra ram is not enough to make a diff. </s>
