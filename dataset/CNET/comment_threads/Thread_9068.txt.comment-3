i know it's factory OC'd to 730mhz, but it's still not worth $230 considering most 8600GTS's will easily OC to 710mhz.
here's one for $165 with a $15 rebate.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130084 the 8600GTS won't play most dx10 titles at acceptable framerates.

$165 will get better performance in the games you mentioned.
