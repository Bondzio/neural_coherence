I know very little about this area and think my questions are stupid, but I don't want to mess anything up so I have to ask them.
My 5 year old Linksys router (WRT54G) is dying a slow death (regarding laptops picking up the wireless connection) and I'm replacing it with a new router (WRT54G2).
My desktop computer (Dell Inspiron 1720) is running Windows Vista Home Premium (32 bit) and I have a DSL modem.
My question concerns unhooking the old router and hooking up the new router.
What are the steps?
Should the computer be on or off when unhooking and re-hooking?
Is it advisable to turn off the firewall during this process (I'm using the latest version of Comodo's firewall)?
Any help would be appreciated.
