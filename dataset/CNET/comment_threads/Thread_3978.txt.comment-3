Steven, Thank you for the reply.
I have tested it on another computer and it shows the same distorted picture.
Also, I tried another monitor on my computer and it is totally fine.
Any suggestions from here?
I just wish that I could just press a button and reset the damn thing.
Thanks for the input...
