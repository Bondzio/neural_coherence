hi guys/gals: don't ask me why, but what i am trying to do is have two network connections on my pc - one wired and one wireless - balance internet requests based on type.
they each have local static ip addesses.
for example, my wireless connection 192.168.1.11 is my default - it goes to the web as my default connection.
what i would like to do is use this in most cases, but say when i am attempting to get an mp3 file (for example), the wired connection is used.
environment - windows xp pro i know this may seem silly to do, but i was hoping there were some great minds out there that might have some ideas on how this could work.
also - the ability to do this at the application layer would be ideal.
changing a bunch of windows settings can be tedious and would need repeated on each different machine.
either way, i am open to any ideas or suggestions.
thanks!
nick
