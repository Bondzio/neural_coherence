I ended up calling the Dell tech.
line to see if someone could help me there.
I have had less than stellar tech.
service from them over the years, but my call today was fantastic.
I spoke with someone who actually spoke proper English, and he knew what he was doing.
He walked me through about 4 steps which he said would reset my keyboard in the bios.
That worked, and I am up and running again.
I am so glad that I didn't have to spend hours and $$$ trying to solve this issue.
Thanks for the help and suggestions!
