Once configured, you can use your wireless network adapters. Just follow the router instructions. If you don't have a computer with a wired network adapter, you can pop a PCI wired network adapter into a desktop. Pretty inexpensive and easy. The router should come with a network cable. You don't need to have Internet service connected to configure a router. Internet ---- broadband modem ---- router ~-~-~ computers ~-~-~ wireless or wired ---- wired
