<s> I have 4 PCs at home and they are as follows: Larry -- XP Pro SP2; main system (used most often); located in basement; Moe -- XP Pro SP2; secondary system (has Outlook on it for my email); located in basement; Curly -- XP Pro SP2; 3rd system (used sporadically during the day); located upstairs; Shemp -- Win2K build 2195 (unsure which SP it has); laptop used by my wife everyday; located upstairs; I have Comcast HSI w/external modem, and D-Link DI-604 Broadband Router w/built-in 4-port switch, setup to use Static DHCP. </s>
<s> Larry gets on the internet just fine, as well as Shemp (Win2K laptop). </s>
<s> However, Curly and Moe have problems staying on the internet - they will lose connectivity after not being used for a while. </s>
<s> On the LAN side, Larry can get to Moe's and Shemp's shared drives, but not Curly's. </s>
<s> Moe can get to the shared printer on Larry, but it can't ACCESS Larry's shared drives (but it CAN see them). </s>
<s> Curly can't even get onto the workgroup. </s>
<s> Shemp can see all systems on workgroup (HOME), and get to printer on Larry, but gets &quot;not accessible&quot; error, along with &quot;not enough server storage to process command&quot;. </s>
<s> I thought I had all but Curly working before after installing XP on Larry and Moe (I know they were all working with Win2K). </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be great. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I already checked that file sharing is on, I made sure my username is setup on each system with the same password, and that ZoneAlarm allows connections from the IP range given by the router. </s>
<s> setup. </s>
<s> Then turn off ZA temporarily, reboot everything and see if those missing shares show up. </s>
<s> As far as dropped Internet connections, I just ran resolved this on my PC by putting a check mark in: Internet Properties/Connections tab/LAN Settings/Automatically detect settings. </s>
<s> Apply and OK </s>
