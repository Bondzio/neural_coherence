1.1.1	Hi, I'm extremely terrible with setting up a wireless network, and was hopin to get some help from someone... here are my specs windows xp SP2 Home P4 3.00GHz 512mb Linksys WMP11 network card D-Link DI-624 router All i want is to have this network secured so that no one except for me and my roomate can have internet access.	St
1.1.2	I have tried time after time after time to go thru the setups, and customer support calls/emails, and am losing my mind over a fairly simple task here.	St
1.1.3	any help is greeatly appreciated!	Ques
1.2.1	I would use to achieve your goal is: 1) change the default password of the router (so trespassers cannot gain entrance to the router's settings).	St
1.2.2	2) change the default SSID of the router (so trespassers do not what type of router you have).	St
1.2.3	3) enable MAC filtering and allow only those MAC addresses for your wireless devices.	St
1.2.4	WEP/WPA is another layer I have yet to find necessary in most home environs.	St
1.3.1	While WEP and WPA encryption are not impenetrable with time, proper motivation, and expertise, I think the fact that users &quot;see&quot; the wireless network as being &quot;secured&quot; in the list of detected networks does help.	St
1.3.2	WEP and WPA do require a user to enter a password, so I think that parasite wireless users will try the many &quot;unsecured&quot; networks first.	St
1.3.3	I recommend using at least one of them for homes that are in close proximity to other homes, condos, apartments, high traffic areas, etc.	St
1.4.1	you can go for mac address filtering and provide the mac adderess of your and your room mate machines in the mac address filtering table	St
