Old is right as they're using a laptop type PMCIA type slot.
In that vein you can then find that adapter and then use the more common &quot;flash memory&quot; you like and as flash memory varies maybe multiple kinds.
It would have better if Roland settled on a USB port which far more generic.
Maybe, it was intended for a &quot;ethernet&quot; connection via the PMCIA slot to dump data(music), etc.
to a PC/laptop.
I would think that the manual offers suggestions or details on that port use.
