<s> Hi all, I am a student who has just started Year 11, and I am taking graphic design. </s>
<s> I really enjoy the class, and I am looking to see if I could/should/would buy a graphics tablet. </s>
<s> I want to buy one, but I am wondering if they are really worth it. </s>
<s> I have a pretty low-ish budget (I don't really want to go over the $250 mark if I dont ABSOLUTELY have to), and I have been looking at: - Wacom Bamboo's (the ones with touch capability, preferably medium sized - 27cmx14cm active area, programmable buttons) priced from $120 (for a small bamboo create) all the way up to $240 (for a medium bamboo create) -Wacom Intuos5's - $240 for a small, $350 for a medium First off, my parents dont really want me spending as much as $350 for something that I am not positive I will continually use (I myself dont know if I will get used to it/enjoy using it). </s>
<s> I dont have much money that I have available to spend, as I am saving for a car. </s>
<s> I plan on using it sometimes (not every day), for graphic design class, and just having fun drawing my own creations. </s>
<s> I do have graphic design class 4 out of 5 days of college, but I may only bring it if I bring my laptop; I cant install the drivers on school computers. </s>
<s> If I can bring my computer to college, then I will be using the tablet 4 out of 5 days, maybe more over the weekend for homework/leisure. </s>
<s> So here's my question(s) (FINALLY): Is it worth spending the extra money for a medium sized tablet? </s>
<s> Should I try with a bamboo (small or medium?) </s>
<s> first, and see if I like it, and I do like it, go for an intuos? </s>
<s> Or should I go straight for an intuos5? </s>
<s> If I do, would the small be big enough for me? </s>
<s> Would I need to invest in a medium for it to be worth it? </s>
<s> Is it worth getting a graphics tablet at ALL? </s>
<s> Please, please, PLEASE be honest; I dont want to waste my hard earned money! </s>
<s> Thanks SO much for your opinions, HELLZ_ANGEL </s>
<s> For the Wacom Intuos5's, I want touch capability too! </s>
<s> Its in my essentials list! </s>
<s> The artists I've worked with were more concerned about pressure sense levels and accuracy than touch. </s>
<s> It's your money, buy what you want. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, I realise the &quot;importance&quot; of pressure sentivity, but I want to have the touch capability. </s>
<s> Between a medium and a small, what would you recommend? </s>
<s> Should I get an intuos5? </s>
<s> The artists I have run into want and get the Cintiq but in that class device it depends on what you want. </s>
<s> What I think rarely matters but touch is there because of that current technology which I won't mention. </s>
<s> For example if you want to draw a longer line, you'd want the bigger painting pad. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, I didnt really understand what youre trying to say in your first point, and for the thought that for bigger lines a bigger tablet is needed, that is not true. </s>
<s> Wacom tablets (most graphics tablets for that matter) run in 'absolute' mode, meaning the active area of the tablet represents the whole screen. </s>
<s> This means that I can draw the same size line whether or not I have a small, medium or large tablet. </s>
<s> I can't afford the cintiq with the massive price tag just yet, and I don't know if I will enjoy using the tablet anyways, so Im not spending over 1,000 for a tablet that I might use for 2 months, and then leave it alone. </s>
<s> Sorry to be difficult, - HELLZ </s>
<s> You find the larger tablet can give you more control over where the line ends. </s>
<s> However I find folk struggle over zooming in/out and well, it takes time to master the tools. </s>
<s> My first comment is that the artists I run into don't use the model you noted. </s>
<s> They head up to the Cintiq. </s>
<s> But a pad is just that. </s>
<s> I can only guess how long you've been using one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, That seems fair enough that you say Ill have more control with the medium, although for the amount I will be using it, is it really worth it? </s>
<s> I have never used a graphics tablet before; this would be my first. </s>
<s> So again, here is my question: Will a small be big enough for my needs? </s>
<s> Thanks so much Bob, - HELLZ </s>
<s> Hey again, PLEASE NOTE: The Wacom Bamboo Create ( http://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Bamboo-Create-Tablet-CTH670/dp/B005HGBF9W/ref=pd_cp_pc_2 ) is the equivalent of the medium intuos5, but for around $150. </s>
<s> Would this be a better idea for my first tablet? </s>
<s> Thanks again, - HELLZ </s>
<s> I was thinking you were a current user and apologize for that. </s>
<s> By all means go cheap. </s>
<s> I thought you were using such a thing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hey Bob, So from that I understand that youre suggesting I go with a bamboo first? </s>
<s> Or should I still go with a small intuos5? </s>
<s> Thanks, - HELLZ </s>
<s> I don't want to dissuade about drawing tablets so get your first one and see how you like it. </s>
<s> And find someone with the Cintiq to see why I wrote about that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi again, I know Im really horrible with thinking of everything to put in my message.. </s>
<s> Anyway, here are some points I was considering: - I intend to carry the tablet to college every day, so an intuos5 small would be more portable than a medium bamboo create. </s>
<s> - The intuos5 small has about the same ratio for corner-to-corner sweeping as my mouse - Having a small intuos5 will help me determine if I want to go for a medium or a large later on - The bamboo create has much less pressure levels, less nibs, less buttons, but a MUCH lower price than the intuos5 small Right now, I just need to know if a I should get a medium bamboo create, or a small intuos5. </s>
<s> Thanks, - HELLZ </s>
<s> What type of paint should I use? </s>
<s> Which brush is best? </s>
<s> Nod to price and more levels of pressure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Ben, So I gather from your reply that your advice would be to go for an intuos5 small, since it has a much higher range of pressure sensitivity? </s>
<s> Thanks, Ronan </s>
<s> It's partly why folk go to art school. </s>
<s> Sure you could pick up a brush and paint but there's nothing like diving in and doing. </s>
<s> Also with a little helpful advice. </s>
<s> Since you have never used such before you can't know if this tool is going to be what you like. </s>
<s> So price is the best decision maker here. </s>
<s> That way you can see if it's the tool you dreamed of and as far as size or other features go, it won't matter when you select your next device. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, Finally decided on a puchase: I got the Wacom Bamboo Create Pen and Touch. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help, Ronan </s>
