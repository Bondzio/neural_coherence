bob, thanks for your response.
i tried 2 e-mails to dell sales and got nothing!thus my use of the storage forum, i have 6 usb ports on my dell dim.
4500s and all are used.
i know i can purchase a usb hub that will add many more ports.
but i have been told that the more usb devices that are added, the slower the computer will be.
i am trying to use an internal drive that dell calls &quot;slim&quot;.
the height may be 12.7 mm.
as you suggest i may just go with an extenal drive.
again, thanks, gordon
