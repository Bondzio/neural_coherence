Now will drivers that came with your scanner work in XP since they were written for Win98??? I'm going to find out since I have a old UMAX scsi scanner and my 98se machine is realy old. The only reason I'm going try is my scanner is a highend model and cost a lot of $$$$$ and has a transparency adapter. I'll repost with results. John

I just thought the new systems came with an SCSI port. Guess I was wrong. When we updated the old computer from Win98se to ME I had to go to UMAX and order a new version of their software. At that time they said they would not be updating to XP compatable. I looked again the other day and found that they did update to XP and they have new software that should work with the scanner. I hate to get rid of it. It has such a high resolution (9800 x 9800) and it copies legal size documents.
