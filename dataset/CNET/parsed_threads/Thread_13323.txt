<s> i have an old motherboard its has three traditional pci slots i have ordered a 8400gs( my budget aint high) it does not have any pci x16 slots, but through videos and other images i got to see that the card goes in x16 slot. </s>
<s> wat shud i do, can i put the card in the pci slots that have been provided or i wud have to buy a new motherboard </s>
<s> Sorry, but PCI-E x16 doesn't fit in a pci-slot. </s>
<s> So you need to buy either another video card (the 8400 is cheap because it isn't so good) or another motherboard. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I'm not sure of your skill...but you should have a brown 3&quot; slot next to the PCI slots.That's a respectable card in AGP form(im on a 7600GS 512,lol),but if you have the PCI-X model,DEFINITELY get a new board.PC hardware is getting REAL cheap. </s>
<s> You can get a decent board for 50 bucks or less...problem is,you'll need new RAM (cheapest is $50 for 4 gigs),and a new CPU,...at least. </s>
