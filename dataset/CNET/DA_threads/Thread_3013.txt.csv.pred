1.1.1	I currently have a Compaq Presario 6420nx - specs: OP Sys - Win XP; processor - AMD Athlon XP2200+ 1.8 GHz; Memory - 256 MB DDR SDRAM; Hard drive 80gb + 120gb (added).	St
1.1.2	I would like to add another 256 mem stick.	St
1.1.3	Does the new stick have to match the current system (2100) or can it be a 2700?	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	the pc will always work at the lowest speed compatible with the memory you have.	St
1.2.2	so if you have 2100 and 2700, it will work at 2100 speed.	St
1.2.3	I am not sure what the price difference is between those two.	St
1.2.4	but I would recommend spending a little more for higher speed, so you can use that for the future as well.	St
1.2.5	in two years, you probably dump that 2100 bcus it would be so outdated.	St
1.2.6	you will still be able to keep the 2700 in two years though.	St
1.2.7	you can check out WhoSave.com, maybe they list some 2700 on sale.	Sug
1.3.1	Actually the 2700 is significantly cheaper somewhere in the range of $40 and the 2100 was $60.	St
1.3.2	That is what spurred the question.	Ques
1.3.3	So if I hear you right I could dump my 2100 and just get two new 2700 256 sticks.	St
1.4.1	You might want to visit www.crucial.com It seems your 2100 is in the 40 buck range.	St
1.4.2	You could do the mix+match thing and see what happens.	Sug
