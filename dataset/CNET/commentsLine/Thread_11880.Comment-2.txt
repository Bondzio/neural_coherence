little more info.
what o/s?
how do you know it booted without a screen?
do you mean it went through post and then lost the screen going into the operating system?
which drive is now slave and which is primary - is there a conflict there?
if the boot you are going through is because you copied the o/s, including boot sector to your secondary there very well could be.
