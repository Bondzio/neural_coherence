Hi, I am new to skype and looking for a cordless phone with a range over 10m to use dedicated for skype.
I want to keep my current landline phone as is for the moment.
I am also looking at buying for my mother a skype phone where no PC is required so she can talk to her sister in UK anytime if she gets a similar set up.
Not sure how these work but assume you only need a phone line socket.
Does anyone have any good recommendations for phones I could buy within a budget as I have seen some VERY expensive ones and I'm a bit nervous about the cheaper ones and their quality.
Thanks for your help Kelly
