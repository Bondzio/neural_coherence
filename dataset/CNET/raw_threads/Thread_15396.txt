I have no idea which processor would be better either the P4 Processor 541 with 3.2ghz or the P4 630 with 3.0ghz or should i go with the more expensive Pentium D Processor 820 with Dual Core Technology (2.8GHz, 800FSB). With any of these choices I will have 1gb ram and a 256mb pci(e) card. Basically all I want to do is play Battlefield 2 and burn cd's. thanks for the help.

Since they're both Prescotts, the P4 will be faster now. In the future, games will be more than likely made for 2 cores, so the Pentium D will be faster. Go with the Pent.D However, if you game, go with an Athlon 64, which will slaughter both chips. AMD is making a budget X2 in the future($300-ish) and is quire faster than the Pentium D.
