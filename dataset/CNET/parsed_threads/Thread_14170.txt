<s> Did advanced search on Canon and info that came up was 1 to 2 years old I have had it with HP. </s>
<s> After buying over a dozen HP printers over past 20 years, seeing HP quality steadly go down hill, I am looking to buy a CANON ALL-IN-ONE printer. </s>
<s> I am looking at various Canon printers (prefer under $150) and would appreciate input on opinions of which is best for ink usage, decent draft printing and reliability. </s>
<s> (My current HP AIO locks up after about every 3 use) I don't print photos, so photo print quality not important. </s>
<s> Thanks Ben </s>
<s> Why buy cheap printers? </s>
<s> I picked up the HP k550 and it's not your typical consumer fair. </s>
<s> As long as you get those consumer printers you might find they expire in 1 to 2 years. </s>
<s> Same issue exists for all the makers. </s>

<s> HP is an ink hog, and I am individual user not needing high powered printer anymore. </s>

<s> Where did you read that it was? </s>
<s> And it was not that expensive. </s>
<s> The speed of the printing and the fine paper handling is great. </s>
<s> Again, why not move out of the consumer printing group of printers? </s>
<s> might be a driver issue. </s>
<s> Did you look here for updated drivers, utilities and firmware? </s>
