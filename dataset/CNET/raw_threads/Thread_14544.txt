Shouldn't this be important enough to mention on web sites like www.crucial.com? (I may know viruses, but memory escapes me - www.schiffkey.com)

Strange how I would notice - over many years - the 8 larger black chips - but never notice that one, much smaller, tiny black chip. So &quot;registered&quot; chips are the ones with the &quot;U&quot;. These chips have a clock cycle delay. The Unbuffered chips are the one without the &quot;U&quot; (sounds like reverse polish notation). It also means I can not &quot;mix and match&quot;. But in this case: I can remove the 256mb unbuffered chip, and replace it with two 256mb registered chips. Thus putting 512mb safely on the computer - a step up. Of course, this all assumes the chips &quot;fit&quot; (one versus two notches - and not on a Dell which moved the notches thus making their memory &quot;propriatary&quot;).

To be honest I doubt the RAM is proprietary unless the original MB is a server board....cause all the PC66, PC100, PC133 that I've seen is on the same PCB design ...168 Pin SDRAM with 2 notches...some single sided, some double sided.

As for the more specific nature of propriatary RAM - check out a DELL motherboard: The notches on most(?) sticks of RAM are off by a fraction - thus forcing you to buy ram directly from Dell instead of your friendly neighbourhood computer warehouse.

Entirely too expensive.	&quot;IBM compatible&quot; could mean compatibility with any number of computers produced over the past quarter century. Too vague. If the notches are misaligned, even by a little, you're probably using the wrong type of RAM. The best way to learn what type of RAM works or is compatible with a computer is to go to the computer model's webpage and look at its specifications. BTW, WHAT DELL MODEL IS IT? An alternative is to enter the computer model number at a site like Crucial.com or Kingston.com. They will display information on what of RAM they sell is guaranteed to be compatible. You could also download and run CPU-Z ( http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php ) to learn all sorts of information about the RAM modules currently installed in the computer. It is yet another way of learning what TYPE of RAM is compatible with your computer's motherboard. It will even give you the manufacturer name and model number of the RAM module.
