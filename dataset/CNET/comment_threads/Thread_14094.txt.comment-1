I have been stuck at a blue screen on my 2004 Dell Inspiron 600m for quite some time..
The exact error message is: Stop: 0x0000000A(0xFF1711F2, 0x0000000Z, 0x00000000, 0x804D9B64) I took the computer to Best Buy geek squad and it works fine there but when I come home this blue screen appears..can anyone help me?
