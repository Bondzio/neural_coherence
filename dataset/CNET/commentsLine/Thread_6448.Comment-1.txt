i have a desktop with 2 drives a c which shows up as windows and is 50gb and a d which shows up as data and is 1.8tb.
i was told that everything would automatically go where it was supposed to go.
however when i tried to save a programme - it defaulted to c drive - the computer said i did not have enough space on the drive.
it said i needed 15gb and i only had 13 gb.
when i go to my menu i see that just about everything is on c drive and my d drive is just about empty.
can i just decide to save everything to d, or can i rename d to c and what do i do when things automatically want to go to c. can i just change this to d. if necessary will have to get a technician in, but i'm hoping someone can give me hints.
i back up both drives on an external drive.
thank you - june
