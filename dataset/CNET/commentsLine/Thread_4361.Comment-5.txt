going to a gigabit switch which is 10/100/1000 will not help your internet gameplay.
you connection from your isp doesnt even come close to maxing out the 10/100 card your using.
at the most your isp is likely putting out 10mbps, and your ethernet card can handle 100mbps.
going to a gigabit switch will only help transfering files from pc to pc, not the internet speeds.
hope this helps.
