but I'm not sure it's going to be suitable for you.
It is a &quot;Non-English&quot; web site.
When I Googled Teac OX1200 mouse I found a lot of non-english web sites, mainly Russian, but also some Israeli.
I also found a lot of other sites which my browser security add-on WOT, (Web of Trust), told me were suspect.
I used Google {Translate} to translate an Israeli web site and found this; http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.zap.co.il/model.aspx%3Fmodelid%3D690744&amp;ei=rbLDTennC-TV4wba8_2kBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ7gEwAw&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DTeac%2BOX1200%2Bmouse%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1087%26bih%3D845%26prmd%3Divns Shorter version of that link, Zap.co.il .
That site seems to have these mouses for sale.
