i have a netgear mr814 v2 router.
i have dsl.
i am connecting at around 200kbs with my router and around 500kbs with just my modem.
i have tried everything i know of to get it to be as fast as the modem alone but can't.
also sometimes it is even below 100 kbs.
it is not connected to another computer right now.
trying to get it to work correctly before adding the other comp.
