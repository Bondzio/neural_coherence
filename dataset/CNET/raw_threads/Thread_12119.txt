My old dell had no problems connecting wirelessly to my router. The new one connects then a few minutes later locks up the router. I have to reboot the router for it to start working again. Its using windows xp professionl service pack 2. If I plug into the wired connection it works fine. It also connects fine wirelessly at work. Any Ideas?

If not there are some machines that won't stay connected due to drivers. But I've seen owners that can't work the issue and won't go with what works and lose many months trying to get it fixed. Let's share those router settings and try it per our forum sticky. Bob

I can connect to my network at home but when I try to connect here at work the Laptop sees the network, says I have excellent signal strength but limited or no connectivity. When I try to repair the connection the laptop is unable to acquire a new IP. The router is a linxsys WAP54g. Can anyone help?
