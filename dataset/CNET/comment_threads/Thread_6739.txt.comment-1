I am considering two, preowned netbooks: Acer Aspire One, 1.6 GHz, 8.9&quot;, 1 GB RAM, 120 G Hardrive or the Asus EEE pc 900a netbook with an 8.9 inch with 4gb Hardrive Main question...there is a big difference between a 120 hard drive and 4 gb.
Also it seems that one has a ssd drive instead of a hard drive.
Advantages/disadvantages?
