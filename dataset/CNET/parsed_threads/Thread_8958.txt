<s> I plan to retire and travel extensively. </s>
<s> I notice that many RV parks have wireless network connections. </s>
<s> I have very little knowledge of this technology. </s>
<s> What hardware will I need to convert from dial-up to wireless? </s>
<s> Will this probably enable me to connect to the Internet in the average RV park? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> All you'll need is a computer with a wireless network card. </s>
<s> It will connect to the wireless network, then you'll open Intenet Explorer, or Mozilla Firefox (whatever browser you use), and you'll be on the Internet. </s>
<s> You may have to 'tweak' some settings if your browser is set to always dial your ISP (dial-up connection) when opened. </s>
