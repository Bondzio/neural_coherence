I'm thinking of building of a new pc and I have looked at some components that I think are good and will work together and I was curious if they really will work together, and if there are similar components for a better price.
Finally should I just by a version of windows xp, or vista?
The parts are as follows: XFX nForce 680i LT SLI Motherboard, Diablotek CPA-901 Black ATX Mid-Tower Case with Ultra LS600 600-Watt Power Supply, Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Quad-Core Processor, 2.40 GHz, 8M L2 Cache, LGA 775, Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 250GB Hard Drive - 7200, 8MB, Serial ATA-300, OEM, Sony DRU-V200S/BR DVD Rewritable Drive SATA, Corsair XMS2 2 GB (2 X 1 GB 240-pin DDR2 800Mhz Dual Channel Memory Kit,EVGA GeForce 9600 GSO - 384MB GDDR3, PCI-Express 2.0, Dual DVI, HDCP, DX10.
Thanks in advance for any help.
