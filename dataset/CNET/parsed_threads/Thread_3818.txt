<s> I am a student who uses a laptop heavily - I use it for heavy internet browsing and research and hard core programming. </s>
<s> As a student, I also appreciate being able to easily transport the laptop to and from school every day - I also really need the laptop to be durable! </s>
<s> On that note, I have narrowed down two laptops that I particularly liked: the Asus UX32A and the Asus S400CA. </s>
<s> Both have i3 processors and 500GB of storage (more than enough) as well as 4GB of storage? </s>
<s> Which laptop would be better for my usage, considering the requirements I listed above? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Laptops don't stand up to what durable is defined as. </s>
<s> Here's the dictionary. </s>
<s> &quot;able to withstand wear, pressure, or damage; hard-wearing.&quot; I would not subject today's laptops to pressure or damage. </s>
<s> If this is indeed a criteria you have to move to laptops such as the Panasonic Toughbooks. </s>
<s> Why not treat it gently? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Based on your requirements, I'd buy the lightest and/or smallest. </s>
<s> But you might have other requirements you didn't state. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Do you think that the Asus UX32A might be damaged easily? </s>
<s> As a clarification, I am not going to &quot;throw it around&quot; and be rough with it. </s>
<s> I just want to know if it is able to last as long - I am asking because it seems really thin and might be a tad flimsy. </s>
<s> In general, are Ultrabooks good enough to program with and research with? </s>
<s> Thank you all for your excellent advice! </s>
<s> The office has supplied me with a few models. </s>
<s> The Asus x202e looks nicely built but just like all the models except for those Toshiba toughbooks I have to be gentle. </s>
<s> And let's call out the battery with it's 300 cycle rating. </s>
<s> Let's say an owner charged it daily to use it on battery power every day. </s>
<s> The battery would be worn out in one year (almost all laptops have this type battery) so durable is not a word I'd use here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am not referring to the Asus X202E model but rather the Asus UX32A and S400CA models. </s>
<s> But thank you Bob, for your input on battery. </s>
<s> I am going to assume therefore that all batteries with most laptops function this way... Is there anyone who can answer three simple questions - 1) Might the UX32A be damaged easily? </s>
<s> 2) Which is better for power - the UX32A or the S400CA? </s>
<s> 3) Which is better for programming - the UX32A or the S400CA? </s>
<s> Again, laptops are well known to fail from drops and spills. </s>
<s> Today a member is sharing a story about a drop from 1.5 feet and the HDD and other parts have failed. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The i5 wins the CPU benchmark round. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The 14 inch screen for me. </s>
<s> Looking at these closely, they are similar in many ways to the x202e I have from the office. </s>
<s> The x202e looks great for hitting the round to do support for our apps. </s>
<s> But for programming I'm back to some 15.6 inch laptop with the usual 16GB RAM, big HDD, etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Point taken. </s>
<s> However, both laptops have an i3 and a 13.3 inch screen is just as good as one with an 14 inch screen. </s>
<s> Keeping this in mind, which is more suitable for programming and which might be faster? </s>
<s> http://www.cnet.com/laptops/asus-vivobook-s400ca/4505-3121_7-35547535.html notes an i5 and 15 inch screen. </s>
<s> Sadly it appears you have left out the EXACT model so I took a chance and used the first CNET review I found on each model. </s>
<s> I would find a 13 inch screen too small. </s>
<s> Here's a setup I used before and similar today. </s>
<s> Link follows. </s>
