8852	0	553833	5263645	NR	womki	1/21/12 7:08 PM	1.32717288E12	Weird beep code in Gigabyte mobo	I have a GA-P67A-UD3-B3 + Intel i5 2500k + ATI Saphire 6950 1GB + 2x4gb G.Skill RipJaws Series + PSU CoolerMaster GX650w. The computer boots just fine, I get the &quot;one beep&quot; on post, and I can get into the OS (w7 or ubuntu 11.04 with dual boot). But after a while of using it I get a strange beep code, I couldn't identify what kind of beep code is it, and couldn't find any info online or even asking gigabyte support, I uploaded the beep code here so you can listen to it: http://kiwi6.com/file/mx750tt335 or here http://www.zshare.net/audio/98880046f982b8e4/ I tough it may be a temp or fan failure alarm, since it appears inside the OS and not on boot like normal beep codes, but I tried disabling all the alarms on the bios and the beep still appears, also I monitored the temperature while the beep code appears and it doesn't look too hot: Hardware sensors Monitor 4.5 shows: Mainboard: 25c CPU1: 44c CPU0: 46c HDD: 37c Chassis Fan Speed: 1950RPM Voltages: +12v : +12.04v +5v: +5.07v +3.3v: +3.38V Core: 1.33v Aux: 1.02v SpeedFan show temps: Core0 : 44c Core1: 45c Core1: 42c Core3: 46c HD0: 39C Temp1:42c Temp2: 25c Temp3: 36c Fan speed: 1929rpm And from the bios (pc health status section) just after the beeps: System Temp: 45c CPU Temp: 48c CPU Fan Speed: 2327RPM VCore: 1.212v DDR15V: 1.536v +12v: 12.073v Vcc3: 3.383v Vcc: 5.083v Vtt: 1.088v Does someone knows what could be causing this beep code?

(AMI BIOS) That said if you've run memtest or something like it without error, then I'd eliminate that as a possible cause. It's disappointing to hear that GigaByte has not been more helpful. Keep us posted VAPCMD

With 8GB of ram that can take some time to test. I hope you let it run for 10/12 hrs. Maybe try it one stick of ram at a time. See if the symptoms change.
