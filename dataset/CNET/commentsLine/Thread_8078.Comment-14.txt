&gt; i cannot understand the wide-screen mindset for computers or for &gt; tv.
people are taller than they are wide (most are anyway).
but your field of vision is wider than it is high.
you see wide, even without periferal vision.
you also naturaly look to your left and right, but not your up.
nor your down, unless you're moving, which i raely do when i'm sitting.
