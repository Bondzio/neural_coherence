if you get a different brand of motherboard, your current windows won't load, so re-intalling windows is a must.
i have tried to use the xp installation that comes with dell on my other pc, but the cd's protection didn't allow me to do it.
on another note, keep in mind that a lot of these installation disks that come with dell, sony, or toshiba computers are not actual windows instalation disks; they are image disks.
so, they probably (almost certain) won't work on your new mobo.
the kind of control that you want to have over the different parts in your pc is not easy to accomplish when you are working with a &quot;package&quot; pc built by dell or any other manufacturer.
