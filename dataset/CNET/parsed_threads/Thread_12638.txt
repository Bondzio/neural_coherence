<s> I have a generic graphics card with the SiS 300/305 chipset ( 32 MB RAM ) . </s>
<s> Recently I upgraded to windows XP and had to download new drivers for the card ( from the SiS website ) . </s>
<s> The problem is that whenever I run a game in openGL , it is way too dark . </s>
<s> With Windows 98/Me , there was full set of utilities with the driver software that allowed me to adjust the brightness levels . </s>
<s> However there is no such feature with the present drivers . </s>
<s> As a result , i cannot play any game in open Gl , because it is too dark to view . </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions to correct this problem ? </s>
<s> I can only note http://xabregamers.dgwh.com/modules/news/index.php?storytopic=2 but will not be able to tell you which driver may solve your issue. </s>

<s> I had this problem on my Compaq. </s>
<s> I go to active desktop, customize, settings advanced and there you will find a correction in my case it is called gamma correction but it may be called something else just turn it up. </s>
<s> This may be what you're looking for. </s>
