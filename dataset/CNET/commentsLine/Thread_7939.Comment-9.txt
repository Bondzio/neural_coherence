i tried what you suggested and that still didn't fix the issue.
so i ran disk cleanup and sr now show the calendar but now it won't allow me to chose a date.
my only option is restore today.
i went into device manager and there is a yellow question mark beside multimedia audio controller.
i did right click on it, disabled and enabled and check properties.
it appears their is no audio controller or driver...i'm not sure which of those is the issue and how to fix it.
thanks
