i have seen these little portable hard drives that are usb 2 and 3. what is the story on those?
my son is a contractor and uses a laptop, he is looking for something for backup that is portable and reliable.
he ask me about them and i really don't know anyone who has used them.
mine has a outside power source, but that wouldn't fit with what he does.
he asked around at best buy, staple and places like that, but those guys tell you anything to get a sale.
any idea on those?
