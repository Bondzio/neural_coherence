<s> Slightly modded. </s>
<s> http://www.wayne2.net/modded.jpg I extended the power from inside the case and connected the eSATA drive to one of the SATA ports on the mother board. </s>
<s> Not pretty but it's major fast. </s>
<s> 3 Gb/s transfer speed. </s>
<s> Seagate 450 Gig PMR drive used as storage for &quot;stuff&quot;. </s>
<s> I can save a 1 Gig movie in about 20 seconds. </s>
<s> Fan and fan mount from spare junk. </s>

<s> the following enclosure: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153061 It come with everything you need including the internal SATA to bracket with eSATA connector and eSATA cable to eSATA enclosure Looks like a decent unit from Thermaltake with active cooling for those that leave their externals HDDs on. </s>
<s> I only use mine for backup and afterwards remove the cables and turn 'em off. </s>
<s> The nice thing about the Adaptec units was they could handle HDDs up to 1TB for the last 3-4 years whereas other USB-eSATA enclosures were capacity limited to smaller drives. </s>

<s> Definitely an option at a good price. </s>
<s> http://www.vantecusa.com/demo/front/product/view_detail/212 No fan reqd unless used in an oven at Death Valley, CA on a summer day. </s>
<s> Alum case is heatsink. </s>
<s> Froogle it and pick your color. </s>
<s> it's the one I was going to mod. </s>
<s> I've never been a fan of the heat sink cases. </s>
<s> I really don't like the one I have for that reason. </s>
<s> I gotta have a fan, if for nothing more than that warm and fuzzy feeling. </s>
<s> I do remember this. </s>
<s> When that drive was in that case, Everest reported the temp as around 137 F. Now, with my new non-case and fan, the temp runs about 120 F. </s>
