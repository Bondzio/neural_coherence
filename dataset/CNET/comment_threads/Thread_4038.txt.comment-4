Out of the box, I've rarely found routers usable.
It seems I have to update firmware, reset to factory settings and move on.
I watch others pull it out of the box and flail about for months.
&quot; also tried to download updated firmware but it didn't help - and rendered the router unusable.
&quot; Sorry to read that.
At least it's returnable as a DOA.
Hope you can recover.
Bob
