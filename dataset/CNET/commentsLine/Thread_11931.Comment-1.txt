g4 15&quot; alum.
pb, 1.5 ghz, 512 mb ddr sdram, os 10.3.9, i've always left the computer on overnight, lid closed, sleep light on, but the past few days it has shut itself off and gotten very hot, even though it's off.
i have to force quit to restart.
i don't have a clue about this.
any ideas about why it's doing it and what problems are coming my way and how i can resolve the issue?
