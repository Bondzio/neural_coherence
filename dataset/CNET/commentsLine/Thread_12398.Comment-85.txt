i'm looking at this printer.
plain paper output is nice - fast too (although the mechanism makes a lot of clunks, etc.
seems like there's a lot going on under the hood).
can i get photo quality output?
i use a epson r800 but i'm sick and tired of clogged inkjet heads... i made a test print of a photo onto plain paper - it obviously wasn't as good as an epson print that was made on photo glossy paper stock.
does xerox make or recommend a photo paper stock for the 8560?
thanks!
