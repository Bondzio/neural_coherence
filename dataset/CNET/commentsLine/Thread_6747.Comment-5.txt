depends on what the &quot;modem&quot; device is.
if it is truly just a modem then the isp equipment on the far end will give out the ip's many only allow one per connection and will restrict them via mac address for a period of time.
you may be able to turn off/on the modem and see if it allows your laptop to work.
you can also manually set the mac address under the advanced tab of the nic device on your laptop to the same as your desktop.
there are many detailed guide you can search for so i will not repeat it here.
changing the mac should only be considered a test tool not a solution.
this is the main reason people buy a router, it allows you to have multiple machine on the same connection.
if the &quot;modem&quot; is actually a router then it is that device you need to check
