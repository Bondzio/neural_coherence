It seems that my files aren't gone because the amount of free space in my hard drive remained the same but nothing is showing when i search for it. I was wondering how to recover or show these hidden files. I've even added up all the files in my hard drive that i could access and it doesn't go over 150 gig. when the properties tell me that it is using 250 gigs, the same space before i rebooted the computer.

I was wondering if the files i previously had is somehow &quot;hidden&quot; but still on my hard drive. And can someone confirm that all the files erase when one system restores the computer, I was wondering because all the files in the program files remained but the file i left in the desktop, which was almost everything, didn't

What does DISK MANAGEMENT say about your hard drive(s)?
