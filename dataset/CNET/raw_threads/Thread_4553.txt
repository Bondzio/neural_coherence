I've come a long way in the past 2 weeks thanks to you guys. Although i still have fears about security i'm sure they will subside as i become more knowlegdable. When i set up my wireless router i had belkin walk me through it without using the setup disk so i probably didn't learn anything. Put my trust in them. So i honestly don't know where to begin to check my router settings although i was told, by belkin, that they set my security to the highest level. O.k,so i just bought the canon pixma mx860 and set it up myself with the setup disk and manual. Everything went smoothly, plugged in the usb just in time, and install went fine. Learning. My question is when i came to the part about wpa or wpa2. I chose wpa. Should i worry? TIA

Should i research on how they deal with wpa2 level of encryption? Tired tonight, will spend some time in the next few days on how, where, and which device to change this setting if neccessary for better security. Live in a condo development and i see several users some secure, some not. No expert at this stuff. Thanks for your help. Mike
