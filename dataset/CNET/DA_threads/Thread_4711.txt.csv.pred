1.1.1	How much confidence do you have in your surge protector to protect your electronics ?	Ques
1.1.2	-- I 'm very confident .	St
1.1.3	( What kind do you have ? )	Ques
1.1.4	-- Somewhat confident .	St
1.1.5	( Why the so , so answer ? )	Ques
1.1.6	-- No confidence whatsoever .	St
1.1.7	( Why not ? )	Ques
1.1.8	-- I only use the surge protector to give me more outlets .	St
1.1.9	-- Not confident at after reading this topic .	St
1.1.10	( Please explain . )	Sug
1.1.11	-- I do n't use surge protectors .	St
1.1.12	( Why not ? )	Ques
1.2.1	25 years ago I worked in a small computer store while back in school as a non traditional student .	St
1.2.2	We sold some what then seemed rather expensive surge protectors .	St
1.2.3	The proof to me that they were worth the money was when one customers home was hit by lightening .	St
1.2.4	The only thing damaged in their computer was the modem , the surege managed to come in through the phone line .	St
1.2.5	They lost all the TVs , their microwave , their fridge and freezer plus a few radios to the hit but like I said the modem was the only part of their computer that received any damage .	St
1.2.6	One of the radios that died was in the other half the same duplex wall plug the surge protector was plugged into .	St
1.3.1	Everyone 's been saying power surge but surge protectors actually protect against voltage spikes .	St
1.3.2	A thousand volts without much amperage wo n't burn up much , but the voltage itself can punch through the insulation of the power supply transformer windings , or get through to the electronics .	St
1.4.1	I usually use a middle-of-the-road ( in terms of cost ) surge protector but , as the survey asked , I 'm one of those who uses a surge protector for the extra outlets ( note that there is a difference between a power strip and a real surge protector ) .	St
1.4.2	For protection , all sensitive equipment here has a UPS .	St
1.4.3	I might take more precautions if I lived in an area that had a lot of lightning strikes , like Florida ) .	St
1.4.4	But , like Lee , I live in an area ( Southern California ) that only has lightning once or twice per year .	St
1.4.5	So , let 's see , I have three UPSes and a bunch of surge protectors for the outlets .	St
1.4.6	But , you know what ?	Ques
1.4.7	If there is some kind of storm we shut off power to the computers and/or pull the power cord out and maybe even shut off the UPSes altogether .	St
1.4.8	The downside : UPS systems cost a lot of money and you frequently ( every three years or so ) have to replace the batteries .	St
1.4.9	Also , you will use a lot more electricity with a UPS even when not using your computer .	St
1.4.10	So , what it boils down to is the universal engineering symbol : & quot ; $ & quot ; .	St
1.4.11	What is more costly , running UPS systems or replacing your computer ?	Ques
1.4.12	If you throw in the & quot ; odds & quot ; of having a direct power lightning hit , the decision can be something you can estimate .	St
1.4.13	Assuming you have a backup , how much would it cost to replace your whole computer system if it gets hit ?	Ques
1.4.14	How much would it cost to buy , maintain and & quot ; feed & quot ; ( with electricity ) a UPS ?	Ques
1.4.15	Now , what about surge protectors ?	Ques
1.4.16	First of all , there is a big difference between a surge protector and a power strip ( power strips just add outlets and maybe an & quot ; extension cord & quot ; but really do n't offer any protection ) .	St
1.4.17	Next , consider how $ Cheap $ & quot ; the surge protector is .	St
1.4.18	What is it rated at .	St
1.4.19	Most really ca n't handle a direct lightning strike but they can handle it if someone turns off then on your circuit breaker or there is some other abnormality on the power line .	St
1.4.20	Some companies offer a guarantee on your equipment but make sure you know what is actually covered .	Sug
1.4.21	They may exclude lightning or anything over a certain size spike .	St
1.4.22	Also remember that your telephone line , DSL line , cable line can also be subject to a lightning strike .	St
1.4.23	Some protectors may have telephone line and network line protection .	St
1.4.24	My suggestion is to not use any of this equipment during a storm .	St
1.4.25	Most of us can wait until later .	Sug
1.4.26	Also , if you are in a place prone to lightning strikes , move , uhhh , I mean , get a UPS .	St
1.5.1	Most all the equipment you buy today has been tested for surge protection but is integral to that system .	St
1.5.2	Surge protectors and a good grounding system that includes ground fault interupters on the distribution ( fuse/breaker ) panel .	St
1.5.3	A UPS will provide good protection but the source of ground is the most important as surges will breakdown internally if a proper ground is not found .	St
1.5.4	Lightning protection will stop surges before they can get to surge protectors but need to be installed on every line that comes into the home .	St
1.5.5	All these devices are designed to be a one shot deal , once struck or surged , they will destroy themsleves to provide the protection .	St
1.6.1	My entire network and all of the equipment is behind a master UPS system that I set up .	St
1.6.2	Somewhat confident ?	Ques
1.6.3	... because a direct hit could still damage the system .	St
1.7.1	I have a friend who works for a business program company and a few years back when the whole country was having lots of grid problems found that the spikes were taking power backup systems but those with just surge protectors were surviving .	St
1.7.2	Bottom line I believe the power backup protected by the surge protector should make the operator from knowing a surge ever happened .	St
1.7.3	Well ... looks good on paper .	St
1.8.1	The most significant and beneficial thing that a surge protected can provide is the connected equipment replacement guarantee .	St
1.8.2	I have had personal experience with this and can attest to modems and hard drives replaced at no cost and with very little hassle .	St
1.9.1	You can receive damage from lightning in many different ways .	St
1.9.2	The likelihood of an actual lightning strike is very narrow .	St
1.9.3	More likely lightning will strike a power pole with a transformer on it .	St
1.9.4	The powerline itself has some safeguards against lightning strikes .	St
1.9.5	The mains will probably blow in such a case .	St
1.9.6	Of course if lightning strikes the house anything could happen .	St
1.9.7	If you have an actual lightning rod that is grounded that might help divert the lightning .	St
1.9.8	Ben Franklin invented the lightning rod .	St
1.9.9	However , besides the power you can get damage through cable lines and phone lines also .	St
1.9.10	It is the networking equipment that is most likely to be damaged .	St
1.9.11	I have seen this in my own house .	St
1.9.12	I hope this helps someone .	Polite
1.9.13	Even if you disconnect the power , did you disconnect the networking or is the networking power surge protected ?	Ques
