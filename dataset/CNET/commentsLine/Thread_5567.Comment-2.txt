i am guessing you have flash on your website?
just change the flash to html 5 or h.264.
it many take sometime depending on the website, since i have never worked with h.264 i can not say how fast that programing goes, but i have worked with html 5 & it would not be that hard, you do all the work behide the scenes then late one night which over.
look at it this way, you have a website that can not be accessed by about 2 million people & growing everyday, changing it to one of the above ( html5 or h.264 ) will open up your company to a larger market without messing with those who right now can access it.
for me since i gotten my ipad about a month ago, i hardly turn on my 17&quot; pc laptop anymore & the few times i have it's just for photoshop 90% of the time; only this past week i have used my pc to access the internet & that is just to view the bp rover cams because all websites are running that in flash.
