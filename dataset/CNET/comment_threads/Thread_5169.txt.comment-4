I don't really know how it got set that way, I couldn't even find how to change it directly in Bios - ended up changing general settings to low-safe (can't remember what it called it).
This changed it to 1333, haven't had a chance to see if it did any good.
Did notice that a hardware monitor program showed something in red zone heat right after re-booting (after one of these crashes), unfortunately I'm not sure exactly what it's telling me is the particular heat problem...
It lists Mainboard (ok), CPU (ok), temp 3 (which has no sensor), and CPU0 Core (which is where the red showed up).
why it shows CPU ok, and CPU0 Core as a problem, I don't know what it's listing as this CPU0 Core that i need to address....
