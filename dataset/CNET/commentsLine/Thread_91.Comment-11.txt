a failing laptop drive.
they thought that spinrite could bring it back but the drive wouldn't stay good long enough to try it.
so the put the entire laptop in the garage that was just above freezing (40f or so).
that did the trick.
remember we are dealing with abnormal hardware with issues.
all bets are off.
