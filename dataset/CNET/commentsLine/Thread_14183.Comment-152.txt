my first computer was a sony vaio v505.
xp home.
that has been my system through most of college.
now a college graduate i still use that computer for everyday use although i am thinking of switching oss into linux.
interestingly enough, i knew nothing about computers when i first bought my computer and now close to 4 years later i'm an it person.
who would have known?
certainly not i.
