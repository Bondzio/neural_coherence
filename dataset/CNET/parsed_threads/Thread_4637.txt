<s> I have a HP computer and lately I've been having trouble getting the computer to come on. </s>
<s> I've checked the outlet and made sure all the connections were tight. </s>
<s> The green light on the monitor is on so I know it's receiving power but nothing happens when I try to turn it on. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Even without the make/model/year I can offer the generic advice. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The fans come on. </s>
<s> Power off, remove the case and reseat all the cards and cables. </s>
<s> Try again. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The fans don't come on. </s>
<s> Depending on your expertise, downsize the machine all the way to just motherboard and power supply. </s>
<s> If no power up (the monitor is not an indication here), then you are looking at the 2 possible bad parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the advice. </s>
<s> I'll give it a try. </s>
<s> I was afraid I might have gotten a virus. </s>
<s> The Hewlett Packard model is about 3 years old with Windows XP operating system. </s>
