6852	0	131158	1479780	NR	HKPK_2005	10/16/05 8:43 PM	1.12949538E12	IS MY COMPUTER GOOD?	I have these specs: AMD Anthlon XP 2400+ 640 Mb. PC-2100 RAM 160 Gb. Maxtor Diamondmax 9 Hard Drive Nvidia Geforce FX 5700VE 256 Video Mb. 250 Watt Power Supply MSI MS-2003 Motherboard I'm pretty much a gaming enthusiast, but I been experiencing laqs and crashes with the most recent PC games like BF2 and Doom 3. Can anyone tell me if my PC can still hold itself for gaming. Anyone can tell me what to upgrade for better performance without breaking the bank?

Imagine my work desktop with 680 Watt noname PSU, Athlon 64, 1G RAM, dual hard disks, dvd recory and the geforce video card. It's yet to misbehave. Bob

Upgrading will cost as much as a new emachines t6524 or hp a1130n, or any other good cheap gaming pcs with a pci-express slot and lots of upgradeability that usually run about $600 with or without monitor when on sale and after rebates.
