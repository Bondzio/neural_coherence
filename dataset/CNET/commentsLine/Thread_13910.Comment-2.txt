they have a hard enough time with just xp in the brew.
for years we had nt, 2000, then xp in the brew of clients.
we did however have to ditch dos/98/me systems due to too unstable and stealing it staff time helping those that clung to the old systems.
good riddance to that.
however the it staffer would be in their rights to demand 7 pro since that's what's needed in an domain or active server setting.
don't battle too hard with them.
i find they eventually explode or catch up.
