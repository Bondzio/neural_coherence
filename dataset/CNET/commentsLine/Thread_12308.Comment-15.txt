hands down my answer is hitachi.
i spend the bit higher amount, but in all my computers and all the operatings systems, the ones that live on are hitachi.
wd and all the others die on me in around 1 year or just past it.
in fact the last brand new computer i had built one year ago had a wd and in one day it gave me a failure notice!
i had the builder purchase a hitachi and it is still going!
