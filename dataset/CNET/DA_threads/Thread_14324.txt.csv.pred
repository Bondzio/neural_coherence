1.8.2	&quot;White Box&quot;) parts.	St
1.8.3	For those of you who don't already know--white box parts are what large producers use.	St
1.8.4	They usually come without any cables or manuals, and have a 3 month guarantee at best.	St
1.8.5	For me, the prices are great--so I don't really mind scrounging up a few cables and downloading the necessary info/software from the web.	St

1.11.2	JDM	St
