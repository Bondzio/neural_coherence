19&quot; lcds although not samsung but equal in the specs.
two are wide screen, the other is standard.
you'll love yours.
one thing you didn't mention is your video card.
will it support the native resolution of the proposed lcd?
the reason i ask is i recently purchased a 22&quot; and was excited to hook it up.
although my high end nvidia 256 meg video card supported a gazillion resolutions, the specific native of the 22&quot; was not listed.
in tears i returned it.
