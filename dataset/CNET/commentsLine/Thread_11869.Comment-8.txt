do not buy a 4gb ram upgrade from apple if you are intending to run it with that much.
they charge a whole lot more for ram than what it's worth.
you can the same apple/samsung ram sticks for much less all over the place.
a 4gb set of those can cost from $80 to $150, i believe.
like bob says, go for the processor upgrade.
otherwise, you can't upgrade or replace the soldered cpu in the future.
really, the only significant differences between the 2.2ghz model and the macbook is the screen and the graphics card.
the pros to having the 2.4ghz model are probably worth paying more for: a faster 2.4ghz cpu (or an even faster 2.6ghz cpu for $250) a better nvidia graphics card with twice the memory as the 2.2ghz model, like bob mentioned the base hard drive is 160gb, which gives you about 40gb more to work with i have the regular 2.4ghz model running with the base specs for it, and it is definitely an improvement over the 2.16ghz model i had, which was replaced by the 2.2ghz model.
if you can go for it, shoot for the 2.4, or whatever the middle configuration will be when they are updated.
might as well.
