since you have a sata hd be sure you have a good seat on the sata cable.
older mtrbds.
did an issue on this matter.
newer sata cables are better seating and/or lock-in better.
even so, just check it as some builders even silicone them into place.
as for 750gb hd is a tad large, if your mtrbd.
needs any bios updates, see what they're for, it may address such issues.
