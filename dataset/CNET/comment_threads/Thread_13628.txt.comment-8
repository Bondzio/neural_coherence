To make HD data unrecoverable, first delete it.
Then over-write where it was (and where rit can be recovered from) by filling the free space with garbage files.
Fill a folder with pictures, for instance, then makes endless copies of the folder until the HD runs out of space.
This'll make the data unrecoverable to anyone other than the CIA.
