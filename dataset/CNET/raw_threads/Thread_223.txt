I just bought a Western Digital 250 gig EIDE HD that has an 8mb cache, and 7200 rpm. I currently have a 40 gig HD, 7200 rpm, 2 mb cache, which is pretty much full. My system is 1.7 ghz Celeron, 1150 mb memory, running Win XP.

Mounr t the new drive in hardware as a slave. Cables do automatic selection. Move some of the files here. A more efficient use would be to install FreeBSD and set up RAID on both drives. Then you would edit services during install and use /sbin/sysinstall to encrypt the disk.
