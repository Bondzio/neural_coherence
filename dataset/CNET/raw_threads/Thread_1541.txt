I have spent the past several days trying to get everything working properly and quickly. I have two computers that I want to connect wirelessly to the router. When I connect using WiFi, I can generally maintain connection speeds of 54mbps. However, when I run speed tests (and I have run many, many of them) I only get between 1 and 2 mbps using wireless. When I plug my laptop directly into the router, I can get anywhere from 5-7 or so mbps. Wireless transfers are even relatively slow when transfering files between my two computers. I have tried several different types and brands of routers and I have changed all of the settings that I know about. I've messed around with changing encryption levels and nothing really changes. I have also tried changing channels, but nothing seems to really speed things up. The fastest transfers I can ever get between my two systems run a little over 1 mb per sec, but it is usually around 300 k/sec or so, which is way too slow. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I'll leave you to learn why a switched hub matters. Wifi might be 54 megabit HALF DUPLEX and is on a SHARED AIRSPACE which can easily be interfered with. Your numbers are quite normal and you need to learn about the technology you are using. I can't educate you about all this in this small space, but there are fine web contents that you can keep reading till it sinks in. Bob
