<s> Ok pretty much all i need to know, we have no idea honestly. </s>
<s> Not really that good with some hardware. </s>
<s> So far we have a Canon 712 cartridge but no idea what to use before we break the seal on the box </s>
<s> I did not find such a model at Canon.com There was a UFR but does not matter. </s>
<s> I find we must have the exact model to avoid wasted searches. </s>

<s> Locate the decal/sticker that denotes your model# and then visit the Canon support website and locate that info. </s>
<s> Many refill ink vendors offer &quot;replacements(refills) or new OEM&quot; ink carts as well. </s>
<s> That info is on the ink cart itself or packaging. </s>
<s> There should be no mystery in finding those details to proceed forth. </s>
