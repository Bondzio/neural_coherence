If your new card is working, then enjoy it.
If you must have a &quot;clean&quot; device manager, I'd have to visit the machine.
By forum its tough since some will do odd things that I don't know about.
I did write that I don't uninstall the old drivers, but some try anyway and that's where the items will show on i810 based systems.
ATI makes instructions that work for 98% or better of the machines out there.
For you, you need better.
Hope this helps, Bob
