<s> Forgive me, I tried to search for a solution for this issue, but it's really hard to nail down the search parameters. </s>
<s> I'll explain the situation and maybe you can appreciate my difficulty. </s>
<s> I have a Thermaltake Matrix tower which houses a PC that I built 100%. </s>
<s> My issue is that often when I push the case's power button (power on) I get the power LED for a split second, then it goes dark and the PC will not power-up. </s>
<s> No matter how many times I push the button the machine is utterly dead with no lights, no fans, no power. </s>
<s> I have to flip the power supply's &quot;rocker&quot; power switch off for 5-10 seconds. </s>
<s> That usually allows the PC to power-up normally. </s>
<s> Sometimes it does not. </s>
<s> I end up killing the rocker switch and pulling the power cord for 10 seconds in that case. </s>
<s> I have never failed to get the system to boot, but it is a hassle and I'll gladly replace whatever hardware is causing this. </s>
<s> There's more to the story... </s>
<s> This has gone on since very early on. </s>
<s> Since I noticed this issue I have gradually replaced the hard drive, Motherboard and CPU. </s>
<s> I have swapped out the IDE DVD drive for a SATA DVD drive. </s>
<s> I have had various different OS (XP, Vista, W7) during the time I have had this ongoing issue. </s>
<s> (Note: I did not replace any of those items due to the power-up issue, simply as performance upgrades). </s>
<s> The only thing that hasn't changed is the case, RAM and power supply. </s>
<s> So it's gotta be one of the three. </s>
<s> I already have a brand new case and want to transfer the existing MOBO and hardware into it. </s>
<s> But I'll still have the same old RAM and Power supply. </s>
<s> What are the odds that this issue is with the case? </s>
<s> I know 100% for a fact that it isn't my BIOS. </s>
<s> I've easily had more than 4 different BIOS with this recurring issue. </s>
<s> I'm a bit reluctant to go through the transfer to a new case if this issue is with one of the other 2 items. </s>
<s> I rather like my PSU and it has truly powered my system flawless (unless it's the culprit of this current mess). </s>
<s> RAM could be easily and gladly replaced, but I don't actually need different RAM. </s>
<s> To make clear - I'm having ZERO other issues. </s>
<s> Just this one nagging thing! </s>
<s> And it seems to be getting progressively worse. </s>
<s> I've seen something like this once before, but it wasn't nearly as chronic. </s>
<s> A PC where I worked would need it's cord pulled about once every 6 months in order for it to power-up. </s>
<s> So, guys, what do ya think? </s>
<s> Is it the power supply? </s>
<s> The RAM? </s>
<s> Or the case? </s>
<s> I used to have issues with the PC suddenly shutting off completely with no warning, but I replaced the UPS and that has never happened again since. </s>
<s> Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that. </s>
<s> I've replaced the UPS, too. </s>
<s> So, surely someone out there has heard of this? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You didn't supply full details of your system. </s>
<s> What wattage PSU, amount of ram, etc. </s>
<s> age of mtrbd. </s>
<s> the whole 9 yds., we can only guess and even then it could be anything when it comes to such issues. </s>
<s> My preference has always been to swap out the PSU for a higher wattage unit. </s>
<s> On top of that, since its a reoccurring problem you need to recheck your work from day 1. </s>
<s> I'll say it in simple terms, &quot;don't take anything for granted&quot;. </s>
<s> Use ram tester, MEMTEST86, google for it. </s>
<s> Next, sometimes reducing the system to the simplest it can be may help. </s>
<s> If you doubt the case, then a teardown and check all cables, etc., and see if that's an issue to include mounting brackets, posts, proper grounding, you name it has to be checked. </s>
<s> There's also the chance of a bad mtrbd. </s>
<s> to include the infamous &quot;bad caps&quot; issue, google for it. </s>
<s> Then there's the outyside chance there was damage due to heat stress. </s>
<s> The damage is already done but it works now and then until final failure. </s>
<s> A power leg of the PSU could be lacking, better PSU or less power demands. </s>
<s> Cheap or old components that finally start to show why they're cheap, it happens. </s>
<s> A mismatch of components dragging out ram into new system where its being pushed or if you've OC'ed , it reaches a breaking point. </s>
<s> I'll leave it at that...come back with results. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> It's the first thing I thought when you described your symptoms. </s>
<s> It's probably being overloaded. </s>
<s> If you watch the fans, you'll probably see them twitch a bit and stop when you press the power button. </s>
<s> You could try disconnecting hard drives, CD ROMs, etc. </s>
<s> to see if it will try to boot up as far as the BIOS. </s>
<s> If it does, it's too weak for the load it's connected to. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> BAD CAPS (google to learn how to inspect for that.) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> BIOS CMOS BATTERY. </s>
<s> Use a VOLT METER to see if it's good. </s>
<s> Having said that, I had a cranky machine for years and in the end we found out it was the motherboard. </s>
<s> We lucked into a clone/exact machine match that had the same motherboard. </s>
<s> Swapped motherboards and the new(?) </s>
<s> machine started everytime. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Wow. </s>
<s> You guys didn't read my post. </s>
<s> This happened with two completely different motherboards. </s>
<s> I stated this clearly. </s>
<s> So &quot;bad caps&quot; is out. </s>
<s> Since there has been no other power related issues, I do not believe it is the PSU. </s>
<s> Since there are no other issues whatsoever, I doubt it's the RAM. </s>
<s> I regularly put my machine under heavy use (modern video gaming and HD audio/video rendering. </s>
<s> I never (never) have any problems outside of normal expected software quirks. </s>
<s> I'm going to go ahead and transfer my rig into the new case. </s>
<s> I'm guessing the issue is with the power switch on the case. </s>
<s> I talked with a buddy since posting this. </s>
<s> He's heard of such. </s>
<s> (bad switch on chassis) </s>
<s> Will send people away from you. </s>
<s> Try to remember these are member to member discussions. </s>
<s> Let's say it is the switch. </s>
<s> That's easy to swap. </s>
<s> The most common is to use the reset button for the power button as a test. </s>
<s> And no case swapping required. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I read it thoroughly and never would have tried such as a motherboard first. </s>
<s> In fact, I'd have done other troubleshooting than just swapping parts or &quot;shotgunning&quot;. </s>
<s> Look up something called the &quot;half split&quot; method if that's still taught. </s>
<s> You'd be well off not to reply back with such insults. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> and reading other responses (including yours); if you have a new case, then why not try that first (what can it hurt, and it won't cost you anything). </s>
<s> Second; I tend to lean towards the PSU &quot;This has gone on since very early on&quot;; a PSU can crap out at anytime, try unplugging all the components except the mobo (see if the mobo/heatsink boots, should hear error beeps), then plug in components one at a time (booting between each component). </s>
<s> It may be your 'favourite' PSU; but it sounds like it has been causing problems from the start. </s>
<s> You don't have to spend a fortune on a new PSU, just get one from a reliable manufacturer (Thermaltake, Corsair, Antec, Silverstone). </s>
