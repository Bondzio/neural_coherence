I have a cheapo 425 watt supply right now that came with case.
It does seem that its just not switching on video and maybe the processor isnt &quot;waking up&quot; either.
And yes I have tried what those minimum boot specs.
suggest.
Maybe when I added my new fans and kept the chassis fan and another blower intact I fried some inner workings that make some power available yet will not let me boot properly.
Guess Ill take back the Sempron 3000 I bought last night to trouble shoot and get a decent PS.
Ill let you guys know tomorrow how its goes.
