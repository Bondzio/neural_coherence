1.1.1	I need a camera that is small and compact .	St
1.1.2	I am hoping for something that is less than $ 100 but definatly no more than $ 120 .	St
1.1.3	I was looking at the linksys WVC54GC but i hear bad things about it .	St
1.1.4	Does anyone else have any recomandations for me ?	Ques
1.2.1	Get one of these instead : http : //www.wilife.com/ The Lukwerks camera is simple to setup and the software is excellent .	St
1.2.2	It 's a little more than you want to spend , but you will want to smash the wireless ones against the wall after hours of fiddling with them and still not getting them to work right .	St
1.2.3	Many Radio Shack stores are starting to carry this Lukwerks camera , so you might want to check it our there and see if it fits your needs .	St
1.3.1	THe company I work for installs secuirty cameras and we have tested just about all the lower end cameras .	St
1.3.2	We found D-lInks ( depending on the model ) to be ok but not impressive .	St
1.3.3	Most of ours now use AXIS cameras .	St
1.3.4	THe 206W can be bought for under $ 190 if you shop around .	St
1.3.5	The new 207w ( has audio ) can be found for as low as $ 260 .	St
1.3.6	These cameras have excellent picture quality up to 30fps at 640x480 and good color quality .	St
1.3.7	I 've never tried the Wilife ones but their obvious lack of specs makes me wonder just how good of cameras they are.Keep in mind that you will want a camera that can handle low lux levels like 4 and under .	St
1.3.8	Otherwise video will get grainy in lower light levels .	St
1.4.1	From the system requirements page on the WiLife web page : http : //www.wilife.com/About/Requirements.aspx Resolution Selectable : 320 X 240 or 640 X 480 pixels Frame Rate & Bit Rate : Selectable Illumination : 2 lux minimum	St
1.5.1	Im not found of the Wilife cameras .	St
1.5.2	I have seen them on engadget before ( http : //www.engadget.com/2006/01/15/lukwerks-video-surveillance-in-a-box/ ) and that says that i can only see my video feeds for 10 mins a day online .	St
1.5.3	And to get more , i would need to pay a fee .	St
1.5.4	Now i think that is just rediculous .	St
1.5.5	That is why i am more towards a wireless camera .	St
1.6.1	I work at WiLife .	St
1.6.2	Viewing of your cameras over the Internet is a free service offered by WiLife for LukWerks users .	St
1.6.3	The subscription services referred to in the Engadget article reference some initial plans regarding the Internet service and are no longer correct .	St
1.6.4	The service is free .	St
