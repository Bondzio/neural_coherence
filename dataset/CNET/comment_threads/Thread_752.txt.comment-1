hello all, lately i have been encountering a lot of internet problems regarding the range of wifi throughout my house.
i am unable to get wifi in one side on my basement as well as very spotty connections on the third floor.
i am also have a lot of dropped connections throughout the house.
i tried building a parabolic reflector, as well as placing the router in different locations with no improvements in wifi range or stability.
my question is should i wire my house for ethernet.
i use my laptop throughout the house.
all in all there are 5 laptops, an xbox 360, ps3, as well as a few portable devices (cell phones, ipod, etc).
all the laptops are predominantly used without batteries/they are plugged into the wall.
my tenant plays a lot of online games on the his ps3 but has issues with the wifi dropping out.
i know wiring a completed house is a lot of work but i dont have a problem doing some labor if its worth it.
i also want to be cost efficient.
in an ideal world basically i would want to be able to connect anywhere in the house, have reliable connections, and have good speeds to stream movies and download content.
current router is dlink dir-625.
any help or advice would be much appreciated.thanks in advance.
