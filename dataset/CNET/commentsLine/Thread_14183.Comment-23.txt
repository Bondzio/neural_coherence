although not a &quot;personal&quot; computer, the ibm magtape word processor we used at work was a far cry from the normal ibm selectrics of that day.
this monster whirred, snorted, ground gears, and maybe tooted as it wrote typed words onto reels of tape.
it was great as long as nothing had to be edited.
if so, one broke sweat trying to find the beginning frame of the document, then the beginning of the part that had to be edited, ad infinitum.
we hired one person to work the thing, and 6 months later she began to get proficient.
my first strictly personal machine was a ti 99/4a bought in i think 1982.
