but my board # is aac27646-206 which seems to rule out the top 8 processors on the list or am i missing something?
it seems i can only use a cpu with 512 l2 cache or again do i not understand?
and after googling the only cpu i could find like that over 3 gb was that board.
and its too expensive i can almost get a new board and cpu for that price.
does that board require the northwood cpu?
thanks again
