vista has been shoved down our throats after the appetizers of crapware and everything else.
first thing i would do is complete format and clean install of xp on my system or just build my own.
gateway wanted to charge an additional $49 to &quot;upgrade&quot; from vista to windows xp on a new system.
the customer service rep became extremely confused when i asked him why anyone would pay for, and how xp magically became an &quot;upgrade&quot; from vista as opposed to a down-grade.
it's to the point that it's just almost funny that the pc user and consumer are now considered the lower 1 percent on the intellectual scale!
