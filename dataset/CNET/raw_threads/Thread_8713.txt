Pinkerton	3/14/08 8:05 PM	1.2055251E12	dust bunnies	I don't buy the idea that dust bunnies (or even the cat hair that's everywhere else in my office) can get inside my intel iMac. All the vents are on the bottom, which is several inches above the desktop. Does my computer suck it in like plankton? Or is this just another reason to be glad I don't have a PC?

I do not leave my computer on 24/7, so I find that once a year is plenty. I also have two 80mm exhaust fans and one 80mm intake fan that do a great jub of cooling down inside of my 30 inch tall tower. I have serviced computer in houses of smokers and advise them to open their case and clean out dust at least once every two months. Your environment is probably the most important factor in the frequency of cleaning. Fireplaces, coal or wood stoves, forced hot air heat, living in a dusty neighborhood, smoking, or just an old dirty house will increase the amount of airborn dust and therefore the need to clean your computer more frequently. Some heatsinks are more prone to hold dust than others so you have to look closely at that factor also. Air intake filters help to reduce the dust that gets inside your computer but they also reduce the the cool air that passes through your computer the three case fans in my tower assure that dust does not move slowly through my tower. HEAT IS YOUR COMPUTERS WORST ENEMY so keep the air moving through and make sure that it is cooling your processor and your video processor. plugged heatsinks just don't cool as well.

The grates on my Dell Tower catch a lot of the hair--BUT--it mats in there, and is not all that visible. I use those rollers that use sticky masking tape as lint pickup vehicles. I use these first--and often. If your fan seems to run faster--this is a clue to blocked grates (vents?). If I do this...both front AND back...the inside seems to stay pretty clean. Using something sticky to grab the dust boogers avoids the horror of using a blast of anything that can mean disaster!

The more people in your household the more dust--and real sizeable dust. It is worth consideration...especially with a number of small folks who they say shed more quickly. Old folks like me...I don't even leave fingerprints anymore!

The quantities of the materials I find are usually low but enough to effect the operation of the PC. In the Summer we might do it a bit more. I also filter the air flowing into the PC to keep dust out as long as possible. Furnace filter works well and can simply be cut and taped to the inlet openings. Brief momentary stalls, hangs or crashes usually are indications of over heating. These occur most often after long term system operation or under demanding uses like gaming, scans, and I/O indexing of the hard drive. Check if dust is the problem first before moving on to more drastic and costly measures. Major crashes can occur with major dust clogging. If this is the trouble then the user is to blame and needs to do a better job of routine cleaning. How's your maintenance? Warning: opening the tower/laptop during the term of the warranty can void it. See the documentation that came with your computer for details or contact the machine's manufacture.

I learned to do this many years ago when a PC I then owned kept overheating causing it to freak out and freeze up. The dust acts as insulation, not allowing heat to dissipate from the components properly. The fans get all dust covered and do not move enough air over heat sinks that are covered with dust and so forth. Chasing out the dust bunnies simply prolongs computer life.

But I have two cats and they shed more than the vet tells me they should. If you are a smoker, have little kids, or any pets, I would reccomend a monthly cleaning cycle. I have heard that vacumes are bad, I've been working with PC's for years and I haven't had any problems. If you are worried about static, they sell cans of compressed air at most electronics stores (Wal-Mart also carries the cans) Take the PC into the garage, take the covers off, and give it a good blow down. I personally use an air compressor (handy in the garage) and use a shop vac to get the trouble stuff off of the case. I wouldn't reccomend using a vacume with a brush inside the case on the electronics. I haven't had any trouble, but there is a lot of static associated with vacumes.

The computer was sitting on carpet. I received a call from the service tech saying that when he opened the computer feathers which had filled up the inside came flying out all over the store. He quickly went outside and finished emptying the case. Now I have an air purifier within 3 feet of the computer which is up off the floor in a room without carpet or birds. Recently I volunteered to do some upgrades on a neighbor's computer. When I opened her computer there was a mouse nest complete with plastic toys and food inside it (but no dust bunnies or mouse). My neighbor agreed that it was time to buy a new computer.

But - just in there today after 3 months - zip when I built this current pc - I went with a full tower. added 4 120mm fans AND put filters over all the vents in the case and over the fans. today I vacuumed off the filters. not even a trace of dust inside. wonderfull!! :-))) they make filters for house forced air vents about 4 inches wide and 12 or so long and about 1/2 inch thich - easy to cut and I just taped them every where air would get into the case.

Besides all the hardware I added, I needed extra fans to keep it cool. I now have 6 fans total (3 intake, 3 exhaust) and all intakes have filters. My computer sits 12&quot; off the floor in a &quot;rack.&quot; The fans are all controllable with 4 temp monitors inside the case. When I change the filters, the inside of the PC gets a cleaning. I find very little dust.

In reality, I never clean the inside of my computers and have never experienced any problems whatsoever that relate to dust. My prior unit was an early edition Gateway that I used for 5 years without any problems. Currently I have a Dell Dimension that is about 4-5 years old and has never been opened up. A lot of folks do more damage than good when they attempt to clean the innards in an improper way.

I had my last computer for 10 years (running win'98), and only a few months ago did I finally break down & buy an new one (and only because the other one was soooooo slow!). Anyway, during the 10 years, I only cleaned it out ONCE; when I added memory. I was reading this weeks current c-net question of the week (concerning a noisy computer) and it FINALLY occurred to me that's probably why my last computer was SOOOOO LOUD! So, that leads me to my question. HOW do I clean out the inside? Simply take off the cover and blow (I'd feel better about canned air; I'm afraid I'd suck out something I wasn't supposed to if I used a vaccume)? Another post warned about possibly voiding your warranty if opening the cover during the warranty period. Problem is, this is a smoking house on a dirt road with 2 dogs a few blocks from the beach (lots of sand). SO...I don't want to void my warranty, but waithing a couple of years before cleaning doesn't sound like such a great idea either. What would you do? Thanks! Bridget

I am in a newly constructed house, and I am still collecting quite a bit of construction dust in my furnace filters. If I don't use a vacuum, how can I remove this? If I use canned air, it will blow it inside the case.

I have seen people blow with their breath which contains a great deal of moisture and other contaminants; that is not a good thing. Just be careful and be gentle and don't be too fussy. Get out any heavy accumulation of dust.

I don't know ho many computer manufacturers still void the warranty if you open the case, But if it is under warranty and it starts to run at all slower, use the warranty and let them clean out the dust. After the warranty expires, you will have nothing to loose.

If iot is loud or if you happen to break a blade while cleaning it is not a serious problem if you replace the fan. Case fans are very standard 60mm, 80mm, and 120mm with standard bolting paterns. They are very inexpensive and very easy to replace. Some come with an extra lead for speed monitoring, but unless your computer is equiped for that don't bother. You can install lighted fans to jazz up your computer, but the lights are not vey bright. Fans come in ball bearing, double ball bearing , and sleave bearing models. I have never sen any real data to proove to me that any one type is better. A more expensive fan might last a bit longer than a cheap one. $8 to $18 should buy you a good fan. $15 to $25 will get you one at your local parts store.

After a year, in my computer environment, the insides look &quot;pretty good&quot; but I usually blow fan blades and general interior areas clear of dust because there might be a harmful accumulation before I have occasion to open the case again. Sometimes, I have a tight build-up right on the leading edges of the fan blades which I scrape loose with a toothpick prior to blowing out. I do not use unrestricted typical &quot;air compressor pressures&quot; (125 to 175 PSI). Something like about 35 PSI nozzle pressure is a good pressure. You do want to do this outdoors, too. I see a lot of people recommend vacuum cleaners for this cleaning operation, but I have not found them to be effective in removing the caked on dirt. One note to those who have never seen a fan blade separate from excessive speed: DO NOT........I repeat DO NOT place an air nozzle real close to a fan blade and try to see how fast you can make it spin. Hold the fan blade from spinning with a Popsicle stick or similar item while blowing compressed air on it.

I like to play with it, so that seems to average once every 4 or five months, and that is more than enough. Our house seems to be dustier than average, but I keep the area around the computer clean. You can purchase vacuums and compressors made specifically for electronics, but for occasional use the cans of 'compressed air' are a lot cheaper and work just fine. If you have some especially tenacious dust, try loosening it gently with a soft paintbrush. Using household or shop vacuums is hazardous because of static and also the physical hazard of using the large/awkward hoses and attachments that come with them. Using a compressor that was designed for shop/industrial use is also quite dangerous for electronics. These compressors can spit quite a lot of water, and rust and debris from the tank and hose come out at very high speed. Even at 30 psi, you are applying more force-per-area than if you were standing on your motherboard on one foot. $8.00 for a can of air seems like a lot, but it's a lot cheaper than a broken computer. If you don't have, or can't get the right tools to do the job, you should probably either leave it or else hire a professional to do it for you.

I do a detail check of the innards once a year, but dust accumulation hasn't been an issue with this case. I have serviced other machines including laptops that have been a very different story. I use canned air and a basting tool and occasionally plastic tweezers on those ones to get them clean. Keep it clean and cool and keep it alive.

Screw the box to a two or three inch tall wood frame the same size as case. Add casters, the biggest auto air filter you can fit on the underside of the frame, and up-firing fans. Had to spot cool the northbridge and memory. Block exhaust except where it can help cool something, like front panel holes around DVD drives, etc. With no exhaust fan running, a positive pressure of cool, filtered air will fill the box as long as the system fan lead is hot. By the way, I use duct tape and weatherstrip foam to mount fans, no reason to obcess when tape works great.

If you have opened the computer, then instead of squeezing into all the corners with the Kenny Everedge Krevice Nozzle, use a small clean/new paint brush to delicately flick the dust in the direction of the vacuum hose. Dust is usually not a problem for me because I'm switching boxes and boards so often, the dust has no chance to settle. One thing that should be maintained for cleanliness is any keyboard that rates in quality higher than &quot;disposable&quot;. If you're getting by with a 101 keyboard that doesn't have those pesky windows keys and is made with REAL switches (as opposed to a $6 dish sponge that doesn't let anyone build up a decent typing speed), you have a duty to keep it clean. If your computer is in a smoking household--no cigarette within 10 feet of the computer! I can make a small fortune recovering typist quality keyboards that have been filled with cigarette ash. Don't be afraid to run the normal vacuum over the top (not one of those USB things). If that suction is enough to lift keytops off your keyboard either it's clinically dead, or you're using a Karcher.

If you can remove 99% of the dust in a half hour, don't spend an additional 7, 8, or 12 hours trying to get out the last 1%. I had one friend who had his computer shut down for a couple of days while he attempted to get out every little particle of dust. I had to come and reassemble his computer for him because he thought that any dust was a problem. I was sure that within a few weeks it would accumulate more dust than was left after the first half hour of cleaning.

This problem also leads to extra fan noise. For some time I was &quot;Three-In-One (TM)&quot; oiling them. Currently I use a combination of 50% Vaseline (TM), 50% graphite this seams to be working well and has reduced the frequency of this additional maintenance task and the noise. The graphite &quot;might&quot; keep the bearing cooler. A cooler bearing will last longer. If you consider adding this task to your routine maintenance these bearings can be accessed by removing the label or rubber/plastic plug on the back of your fans. Make sure you put the fan back on the way it came off. If the label can not be reapplied use tape to cover the bearing. Duct tape works well.

Cleaned it out with vacuum cleaner (DustBuster) and compressed air. Be careful, if you aim the air can downwards, water may come out. Not nice for your electronics. I used an old toothbrush and flicked the dust out where the vacuum could grab it. While apart I powered it up just long enough to verify that both the rear fan and the processor fan were running up to speed.The fins between the fan and processor were really clogged up and was probably the cause of my problem. No problems since!
