lost the hard drive in a not quite 3 yr old hp.
luckily had the extended warranty with geek squad.
they replaced the hard drive but due to gs first telling me it was a software problem--i took the cpu to another company (firedog).
the 2nd company was able to recover my hard drive and then i took the cpu back to gs to have it replaced.
then back to firedog to have them reinstall the information they burned to a cd.
luckily i'm not into downloading music or storing photos so much of my material was text.
