from my experience (though note i'm not a serious gamer), the integrated graphics have proven sufficient, and are continually improving.
256mb is quite a jump up from most of the systems i have owned.
my current compaq laptop (by hp) has 256mb integrated, and handles dvd and itunes movie playback in hi-def with no problems.
and of course, as many have said already, switching to a dedicated graphics card later is quite easy - and can be fairly inexpensive.
i have seen 1gb graphics cards as low as the $20 bracket.
if you have the model number of the computer you're looking at, you can go to the support section at hp.com and pull up virtually anything you want to know about it.
the pci slot you'd need is pretty much 'standard equipment' on their desktops.
everybody has their favorite brands - and you've heard from a few here.
for my 'two cents worth' on that, across several computers (desktops and laptops) over the past 15 years, i have owned more hp's than anything else.
they have proven more durable than anything else - and their customer support, when i have needed it, has been excellent.
i highly recommend the hp brand (including compaq).
over the years, i've owned three hp desktops, and did one custom homebuilt - all excellent for their day.
being a career truck driver, i was happy to see the 'desktop replacement' class of laptops come along - much better suited to my travelling lifestyle.
am now on my second hp compaq laptop (a year old - the first one survived four years of 'hard and heavy' road use, and was still going when i sold it).
in between those two, i used an acer for three years (and still have it as a backup).
also went through three toshiba's - which started out mediocre, and got progressively worse.......
