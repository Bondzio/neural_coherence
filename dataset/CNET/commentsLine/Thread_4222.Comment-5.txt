i had a lot of fun reading your post.
well, the feedback i read was from cnet's users opinion on the new imac g5.
i want to make something clear too.
out of the 450 something... opinions about the product, maybe only 10% or 15% were bad.
but it happens that almost all the bad opinions were noisy-fan related and that makes you wonder if there could be a problem with an overheating system in the future since the desing is up to such a thing to happen.
and about the frying thing, yes, there was some user that affirmed that his system fried due to overheating.
but my concern about all of this is that it happens that i can be a person that can face the same situation and since i live in central america my invesment adquires a higher risk.
i hope you guys can understand my concern.
i'm not saying exactly that this will happen to me nor do i want you guys to think that i'm overreacting.
i just wanna be sure before i make the decision.
i will catch up my reading also.
have a nice weekend.
