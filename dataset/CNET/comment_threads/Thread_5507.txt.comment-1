The seagate Hard Drive in my Dell dimension 4400 is starting to die, I run winxp, and I'm getting alot of errors on the drive, and scandisk wont complete because it says it encountered an unsepcified error.
I then downloaded HDD Heath amd Hard Drive inspectior, both told me that my HD was at crtical temperatures (around 127*F or 52*C) I'm looking to replace the hard drive, but because I've never done it before I am clueless.
I would lke to be able to transfer all my data and programs from this drive to the new one, but I dont know if its possible or even if I should considering the errors.
If I cant tranfer, does that mean I must buy a full copy of winxp also?
If anyone can help explain how I could got about this, I would appreciate it greatly.
