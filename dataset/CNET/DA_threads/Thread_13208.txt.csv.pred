1.1.1	I have a TW Roadrunner cable internet connection and average about 5000 kbps speeds (When the Computer is wired directly to the Modem).	St
1.1.2	I add a Netgear WGT624 router to connect a PS3 & Xbox and average about 2000 KBPS at my computer.	St
1.1.3	I took these speeds when the game systems were turned off.	St
1.1.4	I do not use the wireless option on this router.	St
1.1.5	This is more of a drop than expected.	St
1.1.6	What type of Ethernet cables should I use?	St
1.1.7	Will cat6 cables help?	St
1.1.8	Should I upgrade my router?	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advanced	St
1.2.1	While I will comment you have a bargain or cheap router that takes a bite out of the speed you might boost it if you can install Openwrt in that router.	St
1.2.2	Sadly it's not the cables.	St
1.2.3	Then again I wonder if you tried it with the WIFI disabled.	St
1.2.4	I can't count the time I found moochers on the wifi.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob is pretty much right about your hardware but you could use CAT 6 cable, instead of CAT 5 and it might help a bit.	St
1.4.1	Crase & Proffit, thanks for the help.	Polite
1.4.2	Do you have any good router suggestions?	St
1.4.3	I need a Microsoft Xbox approved router.	St
1.4.4	I have found (from experience) that the Xbox is picky and needs a compatible router or it will not work.	St
1.4.5	http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/connecttolive/xbox360/homenetworking/equipment.htm	St
1.5.1	&quot;WGT624 (v2)	St
1.6.1	Yes, I have the (v2) with the newest firmware...I purchased this model because it was on the Xbox list.	St
1.6.2	I never use my wireless, so I took the advice and disabled it.	St
1.6.3	Looks like I am getting better speeds (high 3000-low 4000 KBPS).	St
1.6.4	My home backs up to a school parking lot, maybe I did have some moochers.	St
1.6.5	Still curious on what routers are recommended.	St
1.6.6	My router is about 4 years old.	St
1.7.1	If you look into this a bit deeper you find the newer revs of that router use a higher speed cpu.	St
1.7.2	Not long ago they were not using the faster chips.	St
1.7.3	Borrow anyone's router?	St
