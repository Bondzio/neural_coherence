Hi, yes, that's what I had found on the net and what I had done, but it didn't work.
I don't know if it is because the OS are not the same, or because the laptop (and the network card in it) are a bit old (about 5 years).
If you connect the two computers with the crossover cable and then try ipconfig /all (I think that's what it was, I found this info on the net too) you will find out the automatic IP address assigned by the crossover cable.
(It won't appear if you just try ncpa.cpl, but it is there...) I also tried those IP addresses you mention + the subnet masks, but the only thing that worked was adding the IP address of the other computer in the default gateway...
I found this solution &quot;hidden&quot; in a thread, so obviously not a well-known solution, but it worked!
