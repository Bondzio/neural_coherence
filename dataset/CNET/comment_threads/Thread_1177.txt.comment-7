because thinking about it there house deisgn is different.
I suppose I could get a router and give it ago.
Then if it's a bust, then look into adding wired wap.
Excuse the basic ?
's If I have very good cordless phone reception from reciever base to other rooms (where I would need wifi access) - would this not suggest that the wifi router might work?
If I had to go wired.
I would need to buy a couple of extra routers + cable and then configure these as access points - is this simple to do?
cheers
