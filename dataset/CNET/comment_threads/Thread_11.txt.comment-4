Let's take my netbook which has 1024 x 600 pixels.
That's nothing my HDTV will display so cloning that display should result in a dead end.
It makes sense to me.
As to those other folk they may not have your netbook.
On top of that you elected to not share make and model.
The extended display does work here as long as I set it to something compatible.
-&gt; I don't want to upset you but why the lack of make, models, cables used, settings and what that USB to HDMI thing is?
The USB to HDTV link I know of required some driver install and setup yet your post is so light on details that I can't see where it went wrong.
