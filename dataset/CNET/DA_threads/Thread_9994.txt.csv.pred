1.4.2	LCD or CRT ? ..and by scanlines do you mean some sort of vertical or diagonal thin traces that are there constantly or are they changing ?	Ques
1.4.3	My first thought is to try the monitor on another machine if possible and/or check your PC with another monitor .	St
1.4.4	This considerably narrows the possibilities .	St
1.4.5	You rule in or out what 's the easiest to do .	St
1.4.6	You can also see if the anomaly exists while running in safe mode .	St
1.4.7	If you still have the scan lines in safe mode , it 's more likely the monitor or display card .	St
1.4.8	If not , you start looking at the driver , some setting , or the monitor 's failure to respond to it properly .	St
1.5.1	I already told you the make and model of the monitor .	St
1.5.2	I do n't know what the difference is between LCD , CRT , or any other type .	St

1.7.4	If they are , it 's not Windows .	St

1.7.7	I suspect you have .	St
1.7.8	You 're going to run out of options if you can not try another monitor or plug this one into another PC but , if it came down to only the video display device or monitor , my guess would be the monitor has the problem .	St
1.8.1	I 've already tried that .	St
1.9.1	You could try booting an UBUNTU LIVE CD as a test .	Sug
