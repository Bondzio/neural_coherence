<s> I bought this product a few months ago and I have been presently surprised with how well it streams mp3's and jpeg's from a computer to my stereo and adjacent HDTV. </s>
<s> The only downside is that it will not stream AAC/mpeg4 files. </s>
<s> Accordingly, I have listed on eBay and I am going to get an iPod. </s>
<s> My question is, does anyone know of a mp3 wifi streaming device that also supports AAC file formats? </s>
<s> There's something patently false with this issue. </s>
<s> A &quot;file&quot; is a file. </s>
<s> If you can stream one file at so many bits per second, it matters not if it's a MP3 or other. </s>
<s> What you may be writing about is the SOFTWARE PLAYER that came with the WMA11B. </s>
<s> There are far too many legal issues with audio and video that Linksys may have had an issue with not getting a clear signal from patent holders to implement &quot;everything.&quot; Changing hardware is not the issue here. </s>

<s> Bob - Thanks for that info as from a common sense perspective I agree with you. </s>
<s> Are you aware of where i could go to get some type of a &quot;software patch&quot; and/or upgrade that would allow me to stream the AAC format to the Linksys player? </s>
<s> Linksys does not currently offer any available upgrade. </s>
<s> In any case, if the hardware functions, I would imagine that eventually a &quot;software&quot; patch would be available. </s>

<s> As I read and what I know, an issue is that such files can be protected content. </s>
<s> I'd look for a converter from AAC to an open standard like MP3 or better yet... OGG/Vorbis if that's supported. </s>
<s> Your issue may be simply that you are NOT ALLOWED to play the AAC content on anything but what they let you. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?&q=aac+copy+protection finds discussions about this. </s>
<s> And it backs up what I wrote about the software patent issues being most likely at the root of the problem. </s>
<s> The lesson I learned when PROPRIETARY formats with such unfriendly encoding arrived was to not use or endorse such. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After speaking with Linksys again this evening, they informed me that due to numerous requests from wma11b wireless media adapter customers, they are developing a solution that will enable AAC files to stream. </s>
<s> It will involve firmware upgrade and a software upgrade for the computer that houses the files. </s>
<s> It should be available within 6 months at the latest. </s>
<s> Also, saw on one of the chatrooms postings from your google link, a website for a player called &quot;SlimMp3&quot; or &quot;Squeezebox&quot; which does utilize AAC in addition to mp3 formats ( http://www.slimdevices.com/ ). </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help. </s>

<s> I wonder if AAC files from itunes will play... Bob </s>
