i want some opinions out there.
if saving money and getting more for your money was your main concerns, what would be better, building your own pc from the ground up or buying a pre-configured one???
i have a good source to build one, but i don't know if i want all the hassle that goes along with that.
i've had a pc built for me before by a family friend and it was just too much hassle to take it over and see if he had the time to fix it etc.
but i don't want to pay huge inflated prices for a pre-config'd system either, but have any repairs be easier.
the one i'm considering has a few extended warranties built into the price already.
i'm not a gamer, video editor-type, just a basic surfer, who does a little business on my system.
