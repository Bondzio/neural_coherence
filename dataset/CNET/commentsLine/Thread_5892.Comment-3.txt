tried that michael, the machines couldn't even see themselves!!.
i forgot to note, i get the same response from a crossover cable that has worked for ages, first on 98&lt;&gt;me then from me&lt;&gt;xp sp1 then xp&lt;&gt;xp.
that now won't work on the xp sp2&lt;&gt;xp sp1.
maybe no connection of course!.
none of the previous setups would allow an internet sharing system to work, but that's next, if i can get the wireless system to work that is...... denis.
