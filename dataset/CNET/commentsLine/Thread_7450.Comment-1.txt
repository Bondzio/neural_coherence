well, after 7 years my dell dimension 4300 hd finally up and died on me.
even though this computer was old and slow, it was perfect for some functions i needed to conduct.
i have several laptops for serious processing power.
i want to resurrect this box and i was wondering what i could buy to replace the dead hd.
it was a 40g ide drive.
any suggestions are appreciated.
