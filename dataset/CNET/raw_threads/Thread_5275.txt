Everything seems to be going well except... sometimes when I turn the system on, the motherboard screen comes up with the fancy picture that says &quot;asus m2n4-sli&quot; and says press delete to enter setup.. so I leave it to continue booting, and sometimes at that screen the system resets and trys to boot again.. sometimes the 2nd boot is successfull, other times it gets caught in a loop where it keeps resetting. This doesnt happen all the time tho, maybe once every 10 times i try to start the system. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Some versions of XP auto-install Roxio MediaPaq Browser or the Roxio CD maker. If you are lucky enough to get past the boot go to Search and delete anything that has Roxio in its title. I doubt if you'll find Roxio in your Uninstall Program list, but you may, so check that first. Roxio's website has a free download that solves this problem.
