D-Link, Netgear and Linksys.
These guys have the largest market share.
Buy what you find on sale.
I have mixed feelings about Hawking and Airlink.
The docs for these products are weak.
I never tried Belkin or SMC but many others seem to like their products.
If you have the urge to become a hobbyist you can try the Linksys wrt54g.
There are 3rd part images that allow additional features.
