I also use Nero as my jewel box and label printer programme. I was told that there is an all-in-one printer that will also print a label on a CD or DVD. I have so far only found one - an Epson. I understand that Epson printers are a little on the thirsty side and only capable of using small capacity, and expensive, ink cartridges. Does anybody have any suggestions about the most econimical one to use, and what the price range - preferably euros - might be? Many thanks, in advance, for taking the time to answer this. Colinito

Here's the article about this. &quot;Digital Data Preservation Program CD and DVD Archiving Quick Reference Guide for Care and Handling &quot; ... &quot;Do not: 1. Touch the surface of the disc. 2. Bend the disc 3. Use adhesive labels. &quot; More at http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:7wdQ6ig-4u8J:www.itl.nist.gov/div895/carefordisc/CDandDVDCareandHandlingGuide.pdf+nist+cd+labels&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us Bob

I am aware of the details contained in your link. This is the reason that I am enquiring if anyone has any knowledge of a printer that will print the chosen label directly ON to the CD or DVD, and not on to a label to stick onto the CD or DVD. The reason, also, that I mentioned the details that I did about the printer that I have and the programme that I have been using to print the items. Kind regards Colinito

Un like lexmark x5470 the epsom printers have compatibles available i owned a epsom cx3200 all in one the original cartridges where cost 23.00 on average each that 50.00 plus for 2 cartridges. A friend in the computer world gave me some cartridges made buy Pro-jet and tiatanuim they cost around 5.00 per pack of two 1 color 1 black even i could not spot the difference so it would pay to hunt around the internet for a postal supplier.

I 'toyed' with the idea of Lightscribe, but I think I might have to buy a new printer / lightscribe printer to do this. Nero used to have it as a download, but at the time I only had the DVD writer and copier which could not be used with lightscribe. Regards Colinito

I'll check out the Epson, but I think the ink is a little expensive. As I said, I have a friend who has an Epson and it needs to 'go to the well' rather frequently! I have had a few problems with stick on labels, which is why I posted my question. (I've also had a problem answering more than one post at a time! The forum won't accept this, so I have to exit and reenter to answer each post!) Regards, Colinito

I have already been advised about the canon pixma, so I will definitely check it out. I live a little bit north of you in southern Spain!&quot; - Even so I should be able to get a reply about it when I check, Completely as an aside, I spent some time in Australia back in the 50's for a while and again in the 60's. Down the East coast, visiting the G.B Reef, Townsville, Cairns. and a survival course lasting 6 weeks from Rockhampton down to Gympie and on to Brisbane. Enjoyed Surfers paradise etc etc) Regards, Colinito
