1.1.1	HELP!	St
1.1.2	Suddenly, for some reason, my two Lenovo laptops last week (one is Windows XP and one is Windows 7) couldn't find any wireless networks.	St
1.1.3	When I click on &quot;View Wireless Networks&quot; all that comes up is the Iban computer to computer network.	St
1.1.4	I know the wireless network router is working as I can connect to it with my non 3G iPad.	St
1.1.5	I also took both computers to work and couldn't connect to an open wireless router there.	St
1.1.6	I am puzzled as to how to even begin troubleshooting.	St
1.2.1	The Norton internet security has expired.	St
1.2.2	I can't explain why Symantec shuts the internet off when that happens.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for your response.	St
1.3.2	I uninstalled Norton but the wi fi network still does not show up as an available network.	St
1.3.3	Any other ideas?	St
1.3.4	I&quot;m thinking maybe I should do a system restore if someone can guide me in how to do that.	Sug
1.4.1	You click the orb, type in system restore and read how.	St
