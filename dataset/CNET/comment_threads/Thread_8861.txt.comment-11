Thanks for the input regarding open office and msoffice 07.
I am leaning towards getting an external drive.
Does it matter what brand external dvd drive or are they all basically the same?
Best Buy is offering the ASUS netbook at a good price,though the external dvd drive is $89.
But they also recommend getting their initial 'tune-up'which enhances performance, removes things, etc., for $49 Is this tune-up a worthwhile thing to do/invest in for best functioning?
Thanks again for any feedback.
