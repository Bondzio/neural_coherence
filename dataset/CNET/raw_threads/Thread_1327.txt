Hello all, I am having some trouble with my computer rebooting when the phone rings, the computer is a compaq with win98 I have changed out the modem and it still does it. I am not on the internet when this happens and the phone line is in another jack in the other room. The phone jack i have the computer on is in my room. I only have one phone line??? I have not had a electrical problem or power surge.....Any Ideas is it win98? or maybe the motherboard or maybe the actual phone cord?? HELP any advice is well taken....... Thanks in advance Boomer

This is done by pressing the DEL key, but it varies from system to system and is shown on your post screen as you are booting up. Check to see if the WOL option (Wakeup On Lan) is enabled. There is also may be a modem ring option....disable that if it is enabled. See if that helps.
