Took it to a computer shop, they cleaned it out, everything works fine. But as I look through my pictures I notice many are missing. I've searched everywhere I know how to look, which is basically limited to the hidden files. These pics were not deleted. I know they are somewhere on the drive. What can I do to track down these pics? Can someone give me some feedback? I appreciate any information. c

From the desktop screen, press F3. You will get the search tool. Select the drive and put in the known file extension for the pics you want to search for. They will be listed by with their full path.
