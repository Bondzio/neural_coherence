while u have ur am coffee awaiting my re-animation, u have the cd drive working.
put the cd for the dvd drivers in it.
when u close it - the autorun should give u a menu to install the drivers.
if the autorun doesnt run - u can click start/run and enter d: or whatever the cd drive is d:setup or d:install one of these should work.
if not then u will have to look at the file list on the cd to see which program to run.
umm ms messanger - u shud have an icon on the toolbar for ie that looks like two people.
click that and get signed on and enter my email and send me a hello.
when i get going i will answer and we can discuss ur progress and setting up for u to do backups.
