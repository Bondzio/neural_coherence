11216	4	203246	2186163	2175598	gnasher	9/8/06 2:54 am	1.15768404e12	look at the costs of the whole package	i use generic ink in my epson printer. the economics are simple. the printer itself is now dirt cheap. the expected operational life without breakdown of modern inkjet printers seems to be about two years. (my current one is 3 years old but has not printed in colour, only black and white for the past 18 months - and will not work at all unless i replace the colour cartridges on a regular basis, no idea where all that ink goes to, but definitely not onto any paper). you can use cheap ink and throw the printer away after two years, or use extortionately expensive ink and throw it away after three. even if you have to throw it away after one year the savings on the cheaper ink are greater than the cost of the new printer. for some reason epson printers suffer from clogged nozzles more than other brands, particularly if you don't use them every day. on my last one even the drastic windex treatment failed. incidentally i have a 10 year old hp deskjet 500 used once a month or less, and it always works first time without fail. the quality of the print is not as good as on more recent models, but it never fails to deliver what it always did.

(very doubtful claim) there were no negative feedbacks about their ink quality that i could see. they ship out of canada and shipping to me has been 4 - 7 business days. i have used close to 100 cartridges and i have never ever had any issue with their generic products. the reds are vibrant and the blacks are good and dark. inkjet printers seem to become problematic when they are not used for long periods of time. ink will dry up no matter what cartridge you use.

11216	45	203246	2187592	2175598	danarid	9/8/06 1:36 pm	1.15772256e12	buying alternative printer ink	i have used ink kits for ink refills for lexmark cartridges with very good results, provided i print out every day a test page or other material. i am now using a kit called iprint with no problems (i have used up all the ink in the kit in some 3 or 4 refills) so long as i follow the rule of a printout everyday. i used, in the distant past, a kit called universal inkjet refill system. the results with it were equal to or better than the iprint kit. a refill kit consisting of plastic bellows with attached needle filled with ink from wal-mart was a disaster. the iprint i found at target; the universal kit was some time ago advertised by cvs at something like $10 for three 25 ml bottles of ink. included was a syringe, bottle of solvent, and instructions. the iprint kit is essentially the same as the universal kit. i have also tried the technique of pulling out the cartridge and setting it on a wet paper towel to get the ink flowing after a time of no use. this works very well. however, after several removals and replacements of the cartidge a ridge locking the cartridge in place broke off and the cartridge would no longer lock in place. under those conditions a replacement cartridge was needed. i have used a tool which i made consisting of a strip of metal about three-quarters-inch wide with a layer of felt cemented to it. this tool i use to soak the bottom of the cartridge while in place without removal. the lexmark cartridge can be parked in place at the center-front of the carriage permitting the water-soaked felt strip to be slipped under; a minute or less of soaking is generally enough to get the ink flowing. this also worked well. i have used a remanufactured cartridge in one case and gotten satisfactory results. there will always be one that will not perform well, or will leak ink, or show other problems. in the one case, the first cartridge did not work and the supplier replaced it without charge. remanufactured cartridges save only little in cost and it is a turkey shoot to get a satisfactory replacement. in my view, the difference in cost between a new cartridge, a remanufacture cartridge, and a refill system is totally in favor of the refill and i intend to go looking for a universal kit shortly. good luck, sick of bush
11216	46	203246	2187799	2175598	yukiuk	9/8/06 2:59 pm	1.15772754e12	it's relative to the cost of the printer	it's a very good question. i have just purchased a top of the range canon all-in-one printer and the integrated software will not allow me to use generic inks. it will also record any instances of me doing so and void any warranty. canon tell me that generic inks are inferior and can damage the print head. i am not prepared to risk it because the printer is very pricey. if, however you have a cheaper printer, i would certainly take the risk as the money saved over time would more than compensate if the printer ultimately needed replacing.
