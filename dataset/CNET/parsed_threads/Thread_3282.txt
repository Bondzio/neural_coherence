<s> I ordered and paid for an Alienware pc on 20th Feb 08. </s>
<s> Cost 2400. </s>
<s> I received the pc on 13th March 08. </s>
<s> On startup I found several files missing this corrected everything seemed ok until I actually ran a game on it. </s>
<s> The fans came on and it sounded just like a vacuum cleaner. </s>
<s> It was returned to them on the advice of one of their technicians and they received it on the 19th March. </s>
<s> After numerous emails and phone calls no one could tell me what was hapenning with the pc and the last call on 11th April I was told it could take a month I can only think they must have a part time techie in the workshop which apparently has no communication with customer service department as they say they dont know what is happening. </s>
<s> My son recommended Alienware but I dont think I can do the same. </s>
<s> You would have been better off building your own box. </s>
<s> The company isn't small. </s>
<s> Ask if the technician has a full workload. </s>
<s> More advice: always check to see if the pieces are in place. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Further to my original post. </s>
<s> I was contacted on Monday of this week and told the pc would be despatched to me the following day Tuesday 15th April. </s>
<s> I was again contacted on Tuesday 15th April and was again told by Sebastian that it would be despatched to me on Wednesday 16th. </s>
<s> I rang them this morning to see if it was worth waiting in to receive it. </s>
<s> Guess what? </s>
<s> Its still in the workshop. </s>
<s> It is now over eight weeks since I paid for this pc and it is still with Alienware. </s>
