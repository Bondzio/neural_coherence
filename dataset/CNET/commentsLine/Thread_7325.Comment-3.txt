you get into the habit of rolling a wheel on the mousepad.
its almost like a third hand.
but if you have an optical mouse, there isn't any ball to drag on a mouse pad.
just a laser light.
so if you pick up your optical mouse off the optical surface it will move on its own.
almost feeling like someone else is using it.
could that be it?
