I had an ati AIW 9700pro and I just installed my brand new x800gto. I plugged it in and the driver automatically recognized it (both use catalyst I wonder If I should have reinstalled it though ??). Everything worked fine when I installed it this morning but when I got home from work today, weird things started happening. My cpu was on the &quot;Choose your session screen&quot; because I had been away for a while which is normal but when I clicked on my session it asked me for a password ( I never put a password on my session). I tried typing nothing and clicking enter and it didnt work so I rebooted my cpu. I could log in w/o password on my session no prob but just as it loaded my desktop the screen turned black (I could still hear all the fans running). I rebooted my pc a couple times with the same problem and after like 5 times it finnaly worked... I am starting to think that my psu might be the problem, Its an old 300watt and ati says the x800series need at least 300watt. Might it be the problem ? If you guyz think the psu is the prob I think im gonna buy http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1828919&Tab=11&NoMapp=0 And what about that weird password thing ??? has it ever happened to someone here ???
