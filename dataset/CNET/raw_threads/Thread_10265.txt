Ok, what I am trying to do is help a friend. Because I have done a little web design for him he has come to me with a networking problem. However, I know little to nil about networking. -He owns restaurant. -Wants to run Pandora on outside dining area for patrons through a Blue-Ray to a TV. -Wants it wired. -Have not been there yet to (try to) troubleshoot myself. But I have a feeling I'll end up here anyway. -The POS (machine they take orders on) (Windows XP OS) connects to 2wire modem/router provided by DSL company. -Then runs to what he says is a Netgear ethernet switch through drop ceiling. -Then runs to the Sony Blue-Ray, connected to TV. -Says it detects the connection but no internet. -What could be the most common cause that I might try. Says Network diagnostics function on Blue-Ray menu does say make sure DHCP is enabled.

My best diagnostic is to take my laptop to that Sony and unplug the ethernet and try it on my laptop. My bet is the laptop can't use that ethernet connection. Why is not in the clues provided so I'll share my testing method. Bob

So, you were right, as anticipated! &quot;Why is not in the clues provided so I'll share my testing method.&quot; Please do sir. What should I do from here? BTW he did send me a picture of the labels affixed to the devices... The 2 wire model is: 2701HG-B The NetGear switch is: FS605NA

Also, the Blue-Ray did recognize the connection from the NetGear ethernet switch. It was however unable to connect to the internet. He has sent me a picture of the label on the devices: The 2 wire model is: 2701HG-B The NetGear switch is: FS605NA

You've found that this end doesn't work so you take the laptop to the other end and connect to the port with another cable to test that point. I don't want to upset you but I hope the usual answers help. Bob

Driving me crazy. I don't know what the fix is. The NetGear switch is brand new. I wanted to just test by bringing my regular ol' router from my house and replace the NetGear switch with it, then the thought occurred to me that there will be two routers connected and that won't work.. or, at least I don't know how to configure two wireless routers on one network. Is the answer somewhere in the DHCP settings of the 2wire modem/router? IF SO, what settings need to be changed? HELP

But you didn't reveal if all ports were dead as well as if they network is valid or not. For example without a router in the DSL box you would get one machine to connect and that's it. But we are this many posts and the DSL 2-wire settings are eluding me. -&gt; But you are right. The second router should not work but for another reason. It's not the 2 router issue since we do that all the time. It's the dead port issue. Next test is to use the connection from the DSL 2 wire directly. If that fails you call the DSL folk in. Bob
