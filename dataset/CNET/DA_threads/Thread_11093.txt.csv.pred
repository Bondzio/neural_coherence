1.1.1	right so specs.	St
1.1.2	intel dual core processor 2.7 ghz Vdata ram 2x 1gb atx 500w power supply 160gb sata hdd and the bane of it all Asus p5kpl am in/gb mother board now the problem.	St
1.1.3	i just baought this mother board and got the processor with it im getting the 1 long 2 short beeps for video error i dont currently have a video card installed im trying to use the internal.	St
1.1.4	im hoping you experts out there can give me a miracle fix so i dont have to replace the mother board i know its relatively cheap but im an unemployed student so replacing really isnt a good option.	St
1.1.5	thanx for your help	St
1.2.1	the operating system&quot; It would really help if we had which O/S you're using; because if I go to the ASUS support site, it automatically wants to know which O/S you're using.	St
1.2.2	I figure you're probably having issues with a missing (updated) video driver, so here is the link: http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx Just input click on 'motherboard', socket, model #, then click on what O/S you're using, this will take you to their 'download' page for everything (including BIOS, drivers, manuals, etc.)	St
1.3.1	I've not seen this on MBs with an internal device but could imagine such if the internal video is defective or disabled.	St
1.3.2	Did you check to see if it's disabled.	St
1.3.3	Drivers won't cause beeps as these are hardware failures.	St
1.3.4	Do make sure you are correct about the beep codes.	Sug
1.3.5	Bad RAM is another common cause of beeps.	St
1.4.1	Thank you for your help so far but how would I check if it's desabled ?	Ques
1.5.1	With ASUS cards I've seen, you just tap the escape key beginning right after power is applied.	St
1.5.2	But, if it just beeps immediately, you won't get that far.	St
1.5.3	If you can enter the BIOS, you need to look for the the option regarding on board devices.	St
1.5.4	I can't tell you exactly where they are.	St
1.5.5	If it is the video chip, these have sometimes been known to have solder connections go bad.	St
1.5.6	There isn't much you can do about that unless you can find the bad connections (need magnification) and are very good with your soldering skills.	St
1.5.7	If it is the video chipset, you can just get an add in video card.	St
1.5.8	Bad RAM or the CPU can cause beep codes but you'd need a listing of those for your BIOS to narrow down the probable causes.	St
1.5.9	Good luck.	St
1.6.1	for ASUS motherboards (BIOS) http://www.ami.com/support/doc/AMIBIOS8_Checkpoint_and_Beep_Code_List_PUB.pdf	St
1.7.1	im getting 1 long beep then 2 short it means a video error.	St
1.7.2	so i get nothing on screen at all.	St
1.7.3	i have no soldering skills with computers.	St
1.7.4	if i go and buy a video card do you think that will possibly solve the problem?	St
1.8.1	than trying a video card appears to be your only option.	St
1.8.2	Hopefully the store will take it back if this doesn't work out but even a lower end graphics display card will offer video improvements over what you've become accustomed to.	St
1.9.1	just have to go buy a graphics card apparently mine doesnt fit the bard sits to close to the case, any recomendations on a decent video card?	St
1.10.1	&quot; The only that a video error has occurred and the BIOS cannot initialize the video screen to display any additional information.	St
1.10.2	This beep code consists of a single long beep followed by two short beeps.	St
1.10.3	Any other beeps are probably a RAM (Random Access Memory) problems.	St
1.10.4	&quot; This quote comes directly from Phoenix Technologies-Post Beep Codes	St
1.11.1	Will getting a card fix this then ?	Ques
1.12.1	here's the ASUS link for your motherboard; it tells you what exactly will fit your board, the link is also for any and all downloads-just have to specify what O/S you're using.	St
1.12.2	http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=xs6iinKxu0y5agcg htis page can take you to whatever you probably need for the board, just have to search on the site a bit.	St
