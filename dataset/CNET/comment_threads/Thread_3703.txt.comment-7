Yeah it works fine wired, but check this out.
My work space is not (not) next to my modem.
So in order to do this, I would have to haul all my stuff to my modem to work.
This is not feasable, therefore I require either wifi or 150 ft of cat 5 for my wife to trip over or complain about.
As it turns out, I don't have an extra computer to use as a router, and buying one to do that seems counterintuitive.
Is that more clear?
