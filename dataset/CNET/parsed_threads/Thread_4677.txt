<s> I am looking for a good quality printer, good sharp text and colored graphics once in a while. </s>
<s> I am plan to use this for school/work processes in the home and am deciding which one would be best for me. </s>
<s> Why is laser so much more expensive when I see that the ppm is even less on, for example, HP LaserJet 2600N compared to other HP injets? </s>
<s> I will be printing text often and I don't want to have to run out of ink very quick. </s>
<s> Good speed would be nice too but it doesn't have to be lightning quick or anything. </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance. </s>
<s> How is the HP LaserJet 2600N compared to mainstream, a lot chepaer, HP Injets? </s>
<s> I think the inkjets' ink will need to be replaced a lot sooner but quality/speed wise? </s>
<s> Affordibility/sheet ect. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> then go for laser printer. </s>
<s> The cost/page is much cheaper compare to inkjet. </s>
<s> The initial investment maybe a bit expensive but worth it pays back in the long run. </s>
<s> I only use inkjet at home since I don't print often. </s>
<s> About 5 or 6 text pages a day. </s>
<s> Injet is slow, I have Epson Stylus C42. </s>
<s> So I want a machine with good printing speed as well as cheaper cost/page. </s>
