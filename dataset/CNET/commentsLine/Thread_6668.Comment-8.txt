i don't sell these yet so don't think this is just spam.
most/all phillips monitors have a three year warranty and some come with a &quot;perfect panel&quot; designation.
it means just that, no dead pixels!
plus a quick turn-around in case something does happen.
they're not cheap but...... viewsonic would be my second choice but their huge list of part numbers make it difficult to find the exact product that you are looking for.
i as a dealer can even get a little overwelmed with viewsonic.
weeding through all of the offerings and then checking with different vendors to find my choice gets old.
then having to do it all over in three weeks because that part # is no longer stocked.
don't get me wrong they make a good product!!
