<s> I have a TW Roadrunner cable internet connection and average about 5000 kbps speeds (When the Computer is wired directly to the Modem). </s>
<s> I add a Netgear WGT624 router to connect a PS3 & Xbox and average about 2000 KBPS at my computer. </s>
<s> I took these speeds when the game systems were turned off. </s>
<s> I do not use the wireless option on this router. </s>
<s> This is more of a drop than expected. </s>
<s> What type of Ethernet cables should I use? </s>
<s> Will cat6 cables help? </s>
<s> Should I upgrade my router? </s>
<s> Thanks in advanced </s>
<s> While I will comment you have a bargain or cheap router that takes a bite out of the speed you might boost it if you can install Openwrt in that router. </s>
<s> Sadly it's not the cables. </s>
<s> Then again I wonder if you tried it with the WIFI disabled. </s>
<s> I can't count the time I found moochers on the wifi. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob is pretty much right about your hardware but you could use CAT 6 cable, instead of CAT 5 and it might help a bit. </s>
<s> Crase & Proffit, thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Do you have any good router suggestions? </s>
<s> I need a Microsoft Xbox approved router. </s>
<s> I have found (from experience) that the Xbox is picky and needs a compatible router or it will not work. </s>

<s> &quot;WGT624 (v2) </s>
<s> Yes, I have the (v2) with the newest firmware...I purchased this model because it was on the Xbox list. </s>
<s> I never use my wireless, so I took the advice and disabled it. </s>
<s> Looks like I am getting better speeds (high 3000-low 4000 KBPS). </s>
<s> My home backs up to a school parking lot, maybe I did have some moochers. </s>
<s> Still curious on what routers are recommended. </s>
<s> My router is about 4 years old. </s>
<s> If you look into this a bit deeper you find the newer revs of that router use a higher speed cpu. </s>
<s> Not long ago they were not using the faster chips. </s>
<s> Borrow anyone's router? </s>
