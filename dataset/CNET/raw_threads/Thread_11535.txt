Anyway, i know that was a bit long winded, but i wanted to get all the info in there. any one have any ideas, or have a similar experince? Thanks -Christian

(could just be the cable) anyway, here is the new problem. i was able to get inot grub to choose if i wanted to boot into windows and linux. but when i choose one, the computer restarts. so i figgured that i would just start by wiping the drives, and throwing windows back on there. i can boot off my instal CD, and i get into the set up screen, but the windows set up is telling me that it cant locate a hard drive. when i check the bios, it tells me that my hard drives are there. even the fact that i can get to grub (and even to the part where windows asks if i want to boot in safe mode, the last known good config, or normal) tells me that the hard drives are there. what should i do?

A lot of the internals of your computer perhaps you have a windows registration problem, as it is no longer recognised by the new motherboard. Or, you have to change some default bios settings at boot. Check the Asus manual.

What you will probably have to do for your system to remain stable, is to update the motherboard bios on the asus website. They have instructions on what you will need to do.
