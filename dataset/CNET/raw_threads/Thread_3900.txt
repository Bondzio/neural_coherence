I have plans on purchasing a laptop very soon, and I wanted to convert the 2400 into a Media Center PC. I plan on adding 1gb of ram, a new video card with a DVI out (to hook up to my tv via DVI to HDMI), a new sound card, and a wireless internet adapter, and possibly a tv tuner. Here is my dilemma I only have 3 PCI slots in this hunk of junk, but I have 4 components to hook up. So here is my question do you have any suggestions on components? Also do I need all of this. I still have the &quot;stock&quot; video card with VGA out and no DVI. I do have a Creative SB Live sound card in it right now. Thank you all for any help. Keep in mind I am buying a laptop so I don't have a huge budget. Thanks again!
