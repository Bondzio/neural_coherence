<s> Every tablet I've seen runs on apple iOS or Android, or Blackberry OS etc. </s>
<s> I haven't seen one that says it runs on windows 7 and includes ms office mobile. </s>
<s> I want compatibility, which my current PDA lacks, as its OS and Office Mobile programs are outdated (even though I purchased it just before upgrading my laptop to win 7 and office 2010). </s>
<s> If there are no win 7 os tablets, what tablet would best sync seamless with a win7/office2010 laptop? </s>
<s> I want my seamless integration back! </s>
<s> Currently I have to back up my laptop work files, backup my pda work files, then hope activesynch and win mob dev ctr are getting along. </s>
<s> Then pray. </s>
<s> Then I usually have to manually update files and replace files that should not have been deleted. </s>
<s> Then once my work files are on the PDA I'm forded to save them under a new name, but then I change them back to their old names. </s>
<s> Only then will everything be properly synched, a step a few years ago would have taken minutes and I could do every day. </s>
<s> Reading http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Mobile it's for Windows Phone so the answer is that it won't run on Windows 7 (the OS.) </s>
<s> There are tablets that run Windows 7 and you can run Office on those. </s>
<s> But then that's not &quot;Office Mobile&quot; is it? </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/acer-iconia-tab-w500/4505-3126_7-34692423.html is just one of the handful of Windows 7 tablets. </s>
<s> Before I would consider that I'd pick up one of the new Ultrabooks. </s>

<s> I appreciate the info. </s>
<s> However, I'll have to look into what an Ultrabook is. </s>
<s> Also, I'm thinking of waiting for Windows 8. </s>
<s> I've read that some Win 8 tablets might go on sale in the third quarter of this year. </s>
<s> Taoskier (otherwise known as Bill) ps--Office Mobile is just a scaled down version of Office that came w/my last three HP PDAs. </s>
<s> However, HP appers to be turning their attention to phones. </s>
<s> I thought my first non wifi PDA was great, the second even better (with wifi), but the third had little memory or power and, as I see it, it was almost obsolete on arrival. </s>
<s> Office Mobile has been included on my HP PDAs, so Wikipedia is wrong if it says W Mobile is exclusively for phones. </s>
<s> While I know what that title is, I thought it best to pitch this in that manner so we could move on with the discussion. </s>
