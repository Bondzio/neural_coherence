This may be something that has already been discussed...I have a PC now and take a lot of large digital pictures.
I am looking to get an external harddrive to store my photo's on.
I am also going to be purchasing a MAC soon...That brings me to my quesiton...If I buy a hard drive and connect it to my PC and dump all of my pictures on it, will I be able to then connect it to my MAC (when I get it) without losing any of the pictures?
or is it better to wait to get the hard drive and continue to store pictures on CD's for the time being?
