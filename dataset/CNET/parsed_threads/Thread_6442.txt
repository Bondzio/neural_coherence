<s> I have recently bought a new monitor and i'm looking at using it on either an ATI firepro V8700 or a Nvidia Quadro FX4800. </s>
<s> Both these cards support display port and DVI. </s>
<s> However when i looked at a cable that goes dvi to HDMI for my monitor it says that it only supports up to 1080i. </s>
<s> How then can i get a picture in full 1080p if there isn't a cable to support it. </s>
<s> What make, model monitor is this? </s>
