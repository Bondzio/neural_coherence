if you run at 1280x1024 or lower, then your x1900xtx can handle any just about any game thrown at it with high settings as well as an 8800gts.
if you run at 1680x1050 or 1600x1200, the xtx could begin struggling compared to an 8800gts.
anything higher and you'll definitely need to start dialing back the graphics settings.
another $400 for an xtx and $120 for a crossfire mobo is almost the price of a 8800gtx.
since the gtx is as fast as 2 xtx, its the better and simpler upgrade choice.
