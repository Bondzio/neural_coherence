I'm not sure I understand your post.
We do use Drivesavers.
They actually did the data recovery on our last drive failure.
They were able to recover just over 100Gb off the drive (unfortunately lacking directory structure), and it ran just over $1200.
They're convenient since they're just across the bridge in Novato (we're in SF).
What exactly is your point, and how does it relate to the original question of &quot;SATA150 10Krpm vs. SATA3Gb+RAID&quot;?
