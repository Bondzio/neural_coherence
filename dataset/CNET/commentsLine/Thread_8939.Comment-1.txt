i have noticed that the audio cuts out randomly.
i will be playing songs on winamp and all of a sudden when the next song comes up it doesn't play.
if i hit the play button it doesn't move.
all the audio then does not work for my computer until i shutdown and reboot.
it is not just winamp either, which i thought at first.
if i use media player, or another program, or even if i am just surfing the web.
i have checked the volume control and it is still set to high volume.
any ideas?
