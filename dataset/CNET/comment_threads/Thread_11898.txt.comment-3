The momentary switch that turns on the PC connects there.
You'll need to trace the wiring but it should have a 2 connector plug and the wires are often red and black.
You'll want to make sure you didn't dislodge it when you moved the PS.
I've not seen the front panel harness dressed around PS harnesses but it could happen and moving the PS could be enough to unplug the connector.
