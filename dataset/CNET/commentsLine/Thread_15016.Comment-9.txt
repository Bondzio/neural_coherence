look at the complaints about one example (there are many others.)
avg's link scanner can cause such.
your post is lacking in so many ways that i can't begin to list the thousand reasons why such delays happen.
but there is voip so i know that it can soak the network and cause a dns to fail and game over.
the fix for that is up to you and your it to work out with a dedicated dns if that's it.
but i find folk that go into &quot;it can't be that&quot; mode and find it best to let them season for awhile.
