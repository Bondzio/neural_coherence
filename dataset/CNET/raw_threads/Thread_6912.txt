I like to work outside (mall food court, park, sidewalk cafe, etc.) and cannot always get a good signal from the nearby free wi-fi transmitters. Could someone recommend an external antenna/receiver, that is plug and play via a USB connection, to help receive the weak signals? Thanks, AC

By conflict I mean the laptop deciding which antenna receiver to use. I assume Windows Vista will give me the choice which to use... or can/will both antennas be used ? Thanks
