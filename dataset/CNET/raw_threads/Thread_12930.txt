3114	0	51911	618596	NR	jyorkd1	12/18/04 6:42 AM	1.10335212E12	Dual DVD's	I am installing two dvd's in a new machine. A DVD ROM and a DVD Burner. The DVD ROM was packaged with an audio wire. The dvd burner did not. The question is, when installing both devices, do I need an audio cable from both devices to the motherboard or just from the dvd rom to the motherboard?
