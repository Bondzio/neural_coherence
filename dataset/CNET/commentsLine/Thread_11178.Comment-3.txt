but i would like to add another thought.
inkjet ink, especially in large amounts, has also been cited as a cause of paper curl.
a text page, which may have perhaps 10% ink, will not curl the same as as a photo page, which may have 90% ink coverage.
also, the kind of paper and the kind of ink used come into play.
there are papers made specifically for laser printers, papers made specifically for inkjets, and compromise &quot;all purpose&quot; papers.
inkjet papers also have a &quot;photo paper&quot; category, and there are sometimes special inks for these papers.
while these things primarily affect image quality, they might also affect curl.
and btw, paper does have &quot;sides;&quot; the side toward the top of the package is always the &quot;better&quot; printing side.
the brand, grade, and weight (thickiness) of the paper could also be factors.
i suggest that you check the printer manufacturer's recommendations and, if the problem is serious enough, try different papers and inks to find the best combination.
hope this helps a little frank
