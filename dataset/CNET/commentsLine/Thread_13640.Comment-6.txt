what do you think about the processor, because what i know is that there are 4 kinds of intel new processors : the xtreme one that is like $900 and i dont need that much any way, then there are the 2.13ghz, 2.44 and 2.66 right?
i'd go for the 2.4ghz one, as it's the cheapest one with 4mb l2 cache.
newegg lists a 250 gig with 16mg cache for less than $80.00.
newegg lists a seagate 7200.10 320gb (perpindicular recording) for $95.
it's faster, more reliable, and holds more.
