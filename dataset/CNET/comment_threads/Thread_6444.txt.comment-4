It's best to wait, afterall you do want it to work.
The mtrbd.
support probably will issue a bios update and w/o that you're stuck at some lower level and thus no 100% benefit from the new cpu installed if it works at all.
IF you have a problem then everyone in the loop expect you has an excuse.
Effectively they'll blame you for rushing the issue as it wasn't proven yet, so they can back out of any &quot;warranty&quot; because you went in too soon.
