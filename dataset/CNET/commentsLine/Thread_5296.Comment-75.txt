games require a lot of memory and cpu cycles.
a 500mb graphics card would serve the needs (and abilities) of a casual game player.
a video card will also reduce voice / picture sync problems, dropped frames, etc.
when you are streaming, editing, or capturing video.
if you need to save money now, buy a stripped down model of a higher end computer (good processor and motherboard with extra pci, pci express, and memory slots.
you can add a video card and more memory later on.
it isn't hard to do, and not very expensive.
you may discover you don't need better graphics capability often enough to justify buying a video card, but not likely.
all sorts of applications and webpages will require more and more graphics capability in the future.
