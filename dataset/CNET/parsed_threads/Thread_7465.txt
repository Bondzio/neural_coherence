<s> I was wondering if someone could inform me and the major things that would need to be compatible for me to upgrade my systems memory. </s>
<s> Currently I have 512 DDR-SDRAM. </s>
<s> I am looking to purchase either 1GiG or higher, Windows XP, SP1 (Earlier problems with SP2) Compaq, 1 year old or less. </s>
<s> I have looked through a few websites and I am still not certain on compatibility. </s>
<s> Could you please post the things i need to check and perhaps ways to check them so that I can easily and properly upgrade my computer. </s>
<s> Also things that could be different but still compatible that could effect speed also post as my computer is mainly used for gaming. </s>
<s> Another thing that I am worried about is my current memory problems and will they effect my upgrade. </s>
<s> Currently my RAM seems to be running very slowly. </s>
<s> I have used dxdiag and it tells me that i have 448mb of RAM, which is different then what it was whenever I had purchased it. </s>
<s> I opened my PC and I unseated and reseated both sticks and it has no effect. </s>
<s> I used a memory program, cpu-z which tells me I have 512. </s>
<s> Is there a way that this could effect my upragde such as faulty seats for the memory or could I perhaps fix them now so I wont have to worry? </s>
<s> Thank you for your posts </s>
<s> The clue that you revealed with your 448MB memory shows your machine has SHARED MEMORY VIDEO. </s>
<s> Such will not get any noticable speed boost with an additional 1G of RAM since the video can slow or pause the CPUs access to RAM. </s>
<s> In this case a dedicated video card would help if you can actually disable the onboard video. </s>
<s> Laptops and most i810 based boards can't do that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> are you using an internal video card? </s>
<s> If not, you're then likely using some on-board video port whcih is using system ram for its own use. </s>
<s> Doing the math, the missing ram is 64mb(+448mb), the amount loss from 512mb. </s>
<s> That's good reason your gaming is poor as on-board video isn't as capable as add-on video cards. </s>
<s> As for ram install, check the specs for what can be installed and way its installed via the support website or manual. </s>
<s> I wouldn't leave out SP2, its worth the install besides security issues it does alot of 3rd party drivers, etc. </s>
<s> Your best bet is to do a complete format and re-install of OS, doing all updates to include SP2. </s>
<s> Expect a long install process anything else but that may cause SP2 to puke, its a hassle I know. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Well the reason I am not sure about this is becaues I had previously reinstalled my os and it didnt seem to be like this until i did so, for the first about nine or ten months I had the computer it ran fine, but after i reinstalled os it seemed to just have disappeared. </s>
<s> anyone have any other comments </s>
