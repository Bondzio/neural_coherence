i have a 120gb wd passport external hd and recenlty had issues with vista with it.
it was formatted in ntfs by vista and i had used it back up my system but when i went to complete an incremental backup it started to crash, at least is sounded like it.
vista then could not even connect to the drive , explorer would hang.
i returned it to my xp machine and did a chkdsk /f and defrag with out issue.
the chkdsk did list some hidden files that needed fixing.
*.wbcat??
?
