Model....SY-NEC-5U Serial....UW0702NC00900 I believe I am having the same issue with this card, and yes I bought it from Ebay at a bargain as well.
It has the 5 USB port connections (1 internal, 4 external).
I have installed it in the top PCI slot of my motherboard and I let Windows XP SP2 find the driver(s), which it did with no problems.
In &quot;device manager&quot;, the new card shows up and shows to be working properly with no conflicts.
Now the problem.......No matter what I plug into the new usb card, it doesnt recognize any of them (mouse, digital camera, printer, etc.)
I get a small balloon at the bottom right corner that says &quot;unknown device&quot;.
If I plug any of these items back into my motherboard usb slots, it finds them correctly with no issues....but my motherboard usb slots are 1.1 which is why I bought this new card.
Any fixes or tech support for this problem?
