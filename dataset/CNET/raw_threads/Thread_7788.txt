This is given that you've tried all possible combination of testing and the system works when it's using the original ram. If you have another system to try the new ram and works, then imcompatibility, but if the other system also displays same problems, then the problem lies with the ram itself. Did the ram comes in its original packing? Check on the ram for any scratches as it would indicate damage as well (that is if you are able to do so).
