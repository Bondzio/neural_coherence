<s> Do the following to print a self-test: Disconnect the power supply from the wall (not the back of the printer) for at least &quot;30 seconds.&quot; Then plug the printer back in. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Make sure the printer is in &quot;Copy Mode.&quot; 2. </s>
<s> Press the &quot;Menu&quot; button once. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The screen will display &quot;COPY MENU: Copies&quot;. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Press the left arrow button once. </s>
<s> The screen will display &quot;COPY MENU: Tools&quot;. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Press the check button once. </s>
<s> The screen with read &quot;Tools: Maintenance&quot;. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Press the check button once. </s>
<s> The screen with read &quot;Maintenance: Ink Levels&quot;. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> Press the right arrow button until the screen reads &quot;Maintenance: Print Test Page&quot;. </s>
<s> 8. </s>
<s> Press the check button once. </s>
<s> This will start the Self-Test. </s>
<s> Once the page has printed, the printer will stop. </s>
<s> The test is not continuous. </s>
<s> The self-test should at least print out a set of either a solid black or solid color bars, but the top portion will contain info on your printer. </s>
<s> Get a fax number from tech support and fax that info to them. </s>
<s> They'll be able to determine what's wrong from that info. </s>
<s> I'm on my second X5470, and it's giving me the same problem as the first (sounds like it's trying to turn on for no apparent reason). </s>
<s> Needless to say I'm not a happy camper. </s>
<s> Must admit Lexmark sent me a replacement quickly, but what good is that when I have the same problems with the new unit? </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> Can't return warranty over. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
