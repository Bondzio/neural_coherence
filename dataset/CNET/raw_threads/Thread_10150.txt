I just got a wireless router, and when i play a game and left it and go Away from Keyboard for the night I always disconnect cause the router is shutting itself off cause it thinks that i dont use the net anymore, so it shut itself off to save power and such. Ive putted &quot;Idle Timeout&quot; to 0. Heres the discription of idle timout: &quot;An idle Internet connection will be terminated after this time period. If this value is zero (0), then the connection will be &quot;kept alive&quot; by re-connecting immediately whenever the connection is lost.&quot; But when it reconnect, ive already disconnected from the game. So its useless. I have oxo marked &quot;Connect automatically, as requied&quot; Heres what the connect automatically description says: &quot;Connect Automatically, as Required Normally, this option should be enabled. An Internet connection will be made automatically after each timeout, whenever Internet-bound traffic is detected. This provides connection on demand and is potentially cost-saving. If disabled, you must connect manually, using the &quot;Connection Status&quot; button on the Router Status screen. This manual connection will stay up all the time without timeouts.&quot; And yes, ive contacted my ISP and they said it wasnt any problems with their stuff and my modem. But they said it was my router. Iam using a NetGear RangeMax WPN824 v2.

It does not shutoff like you note. Ever. I wonder if you are connecting with WIFI? Try this. WPA, SSID enabled and all other settings at stock save the item you noted. Bob

But that's good enough for me. I won't ask if you are checking the router's status page to see if it's truly disconnected from the internet or it's just your machine... Bob

The router is very new, i bought it with my laptop. =X Account Name WPN824 Hardware Version V2H1 Firmware Version V2.0.10_1.2.17 Internet Port MAC Address 00:18:4D:8A:E3:CF IP Address XX.XX.XX.XXX DHCP PPPoE IP Subnet Mask XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX Domain Name Server

Your ISP should tell you this but some won't. Again, your status given looks fine. What does it look like when the router (as you claim) has disconnected? In closing, one member posted over a dozen posts before they revealed all the details. The problem was an incompatible setup on their DSL modem. Again, always the member's choice to share details.

And, i dunno how the router status looks like when the router DCs or disconnect. I will try to check that out next time my router gets disconnected. I hope i can fix it ASAP. And Thanks for helping me R. Proffitt ^^ Still posting more information later when ive seen how the router status looks like when it gets disconnected. Sorry my bad english

Let me be very blunt here so I apologize if it seems not well written. You stated the router is doing the disconnect but didn't look at the router status page. I have to guess you are looking at some LED or other indication or something else. That scrap of detail is sorely needed to gain some traction on your issue. So let be be even more blunt. Nail it down. When it's disconnected, look at the router's status page. Also check that lease time. It could be &quot;one of those ISP's&quot; that hand out 1 hour leases. Sorry if it appears you have to become a network IT guru but it's tough to sort out without these items. Hang in there! -&gt; In closing there was a nice one the tech fixed recently. The owner was on DSL and complained of similar after checking email. It was the old setting in Outlook Express called &quot;Hang up after checking email.&quot; Bob

I caught the router shutting down, but this shutdown was for very long so i think its not like those other shutdowns i had before. I unplugged my modem and the routers power to fix the net again, but heres the router status.

3821	13	251903	2518811	2512130	PudgyOne	6/20/07 2:59 AM	1.18230834E12	The 2.4gh cordless phones uses	the same frequencies as the routers. You can try disconnecting the cordless phone to see if this stops you from disconnecting. If the problem is gone, then you need to get a cordless phone that is 5gh. Better yet, while you're connected, turn on the cordless phone and see if you get disconnected. If you phone allows you to change it's channel, it may or may NOT help. This is one of the big culprits. The second one is, when you view the wireless networks in your area, do you see others? What channel sre they using(right click and left click details)? They may be using the same channel that you are or one close to yours. Rick

Hope this helps
