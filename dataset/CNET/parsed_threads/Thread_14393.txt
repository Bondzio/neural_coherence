<s> I have a Gateway MA7 MX5669 running Windows 7 that will power up but the only activity that can be seen is the CD Rom and the hard drive startup for a few seconds. </s>
<s> I tried a trick that I read about where you press the 'on' key down for 60 seconds with the battery removed and then plug it in. </s>
<s> It is supposed to bleed off some residual charge in the PC but it did not work for me.I removed reinserted and then removed the two 1gb memory sticks. </s>
<s> No beeps nothing different than before. </s>
<s> I have hooked the laptop up to an external monitor.Nothing. </s>
<s> All the usual power lights are on and the fan is running as normal. </s>
<s> It is as if the normal bootup got truncated after about 5 seconds. </s>
<s> I am thinking it is the motherboard because of not hearing any beeps when I removed the memory but I am also wondering if it is possible it could be something else like the video card. </s>
<s> I would be very happy for it to be the video board. </s>
<s> What I am wondering is if anyone can tell me where I might go from here to determine what the issue is. </s>
<s> Thanks very much, Jim Lee </s>
<s> Try the generic reset (power off, remove battery, ac, press+hold power button for 60 seconds, release and test.) </s>
<s> Yes I read you tried it but you didn't tell if the AC was removed. </s>
<s> And it's not a &quot;bleed off.&quot; I can only guess some web site wrote that and we now get folk saying this. </s>
<s> But I read you think there is a video card. </s>
<s> Very few laptops have such. </s>
<s> Less than a percent point (much lower!) </s>

<s> Also, if any display becomes present, record it to post back. </s>
<s> If nothing, again, this relates to mtrbd.. </s>
<s> If any warranty, use it. </s>
<s> Last, if this laptop is known to run &quot;hot&quot; and very hot at that, the mtrbd. </s>
<s> or its components get fried and anything can happen to include not working. </s>
<s> Offhand, it appears the video got hosed, if all LEDs suggest its up and running. </s>
<s> As last resort, a teardown is required to inspect the innards. </s>

<s> Sorry but I already gave the usual above. </s>
