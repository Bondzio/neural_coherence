1.1.1	Hello , I have been having some trouble with my laptop .	St
1.1.2	I have a HP Pavillion DV8000 with Windows XP .	St
1.1.3	None of my USB ports seem to work , when I plug something in the error message titled & quot ; USB Device Not Recognized & quot ; pops up and the device does not operate .	St
1.1.4	I have researched this as much as possible for about 2 hours now and I have tried these methods .	St
1.1.5	- Unpluging power cord and battery - Deleting the items for USB under Device Manager - Checking for updates in windows update - Scanning for hardware changes in Device Manager I would really appreciate some help .	St
1.1.6	I have Service Pack 3 .	St
1.2.1	If it ever worked since the OS was installed .	St
1.2.2	The most common failure here is the bum install of the OS .	St
1.2.3	This dv8000 has an onerous install procedure too similar to this - & gt ; http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html ? threadID=271360 # 2699006 This is why I use the restore media as folk rarely will pay for the 2 to 5 days to install XP .	St

1.3.1	Do you get any error mark in device driver section of usb in device manager ?	Ques
1.3.2	best bet is to update or reinstall the drivers and also check with another usb device on all the ports .	St
1.3.3	Also use the inbuilt hw diagnostic for any information in regards to this .	St
1.4.1	Try this .	St
1.4.2	Unplug a USB device , wait 10 seconds .	St
1.4.3	Then hold down the Shift key on the keyboard while plugging the USB device back in .	Sug
1.5.1	Sounds like your laptop is missing the required drivers for the Motherboard , not Windows drivers !	St
1.5.2	Check your system , using the Control Panel , Device Manager and look for the USB tab .	St
1.5.3	If it has a question mark of 'x ' beside it , you need to install the machines drivers , so that the computer itself can recognize the ports .	St
1.5.4	Download the required driver from the manufacturers website and install them , or ( after downloading ) , Update the drivers from the control panel , using the download .	St
1.5.5	Should work perfectly after that MarkinTO	St
1.6.1	The Mac ( OS X ) and the PC ( NTFS ) use different operating systems and devices formatted specifically for one will not function in the other .	St
1.6.2	FAT 32 is a universal standard which allows external devices like HD 's , thumb drives , and memory cards to be used interchangeably to transport data back and forth etc .	St
1.6.3	So perhaps you have some devices specifically formatted for the Mac , or perhaps some other system .	St
1.6.4	So you might check your formatting .	Sug
