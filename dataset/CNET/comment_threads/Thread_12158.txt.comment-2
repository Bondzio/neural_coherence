What is your PC currently connected to and how?
If you go straight to a modem, then you buy a standard wireless router.
If you're connected to a wired router, you add a wireless access point to that.
If you want others to connect through your PC, what you'd need is a wireless network interface device that can act as an AP and be bridged to your wired NIC.
In any event, I think you're looking for an AP and not a router unless you have some other purpose here.
Maybe if you could explain more about your plan, it would get you a better answer.
