<s> I have an Epson Stylus PHOTO 825 printer that will only print graphic images but NO text. </s>
<s> For example, if I try to print an email all the framing is printed OK but the text area is left blank. </s>
<s> It also will not print any Word, WordPad or Notepad documents. </s>
<s> I just started having this problem a few days ago. </s>
<s> I've gone over all the preferences and settings on the printer and everything seems enabled. </s>
<s> Anybody have any ideas about this? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Fetch http://media-server.amazon.com/media/mole/MANUAL000011445.pdf and look at page 6 of Testing this printer. </s>
