does anyone know if there is a way to enable the usb port of a tv to access video files held on a nas drive?
my aim is to access the drive via wifi or ethernet.
presumably it would need to present the drive as a mass storage device to the tv's usb port since that's basically what the port picks up.
any suggestions would be most welcome.
the tv does not support dlna and i'm trying to avoid having to buy a separate media player e.g.
wd live tv box.
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
