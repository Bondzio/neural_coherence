many thanks!
i don't want to spend more than $700.
this will be a true utility appliance compared to what others are doing with their computers.
the laptop question is a good one.
on one hand i don't want to spend $2000 on a laptop when i could buy the same tools for 500-700. i have other places i'd like to spend that money since my computer truly will be an appliance.
on the other hand i will be traveling a great deal in the coming months and i can see the eventual superiority of a laptop.
for the moment, however, a desktop will take care of my immediate needs and when/if i see the real need for a laptop, i'll buy one.
