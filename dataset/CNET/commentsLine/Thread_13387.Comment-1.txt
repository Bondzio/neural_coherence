hi everybody.
i'm looking for really good desktop speakers for my computer.
i definitely want a powerful sub, but i want a balance between rich bass and crisp trebles.
there are so many speakers to chose from that it's mind-baffling.
any suggestions of specific models or brands are extremely appreciated.
i don't want to spend a butt-load of money, but i'm open to high-end models.
thanks!
nick
