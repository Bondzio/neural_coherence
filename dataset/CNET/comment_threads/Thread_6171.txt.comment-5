well this old plextor has a program called audio capture that is just so EASY.
I still have it running in a win 98 machine.
no muss, no fuss.
I miss it.
with these new programs, I always forget which of the 200 buttons does the one thing I want.
I actually have to write little notes to myself to remind me how to do some simple task that took an hour of digging around in menus to find.
I can't decipher the program that came with my creative sound card.
