Can I designate a priority of which LAN connection to use? I know I can enable and disable the connections but thought there might be a better method. The laptop uses Windows 2000 over ethernet cabling for internet access and is sometimes removed from the internet and used to connect to an industrial printer with a cross over cable in a different location(different building). The laptop is being shared for these two tasks. Thanks for your input Mike

What is the 'Alternate Location' setting in TCP/IP for? Can it be use for multiple LAN in question? If indeed it could be used, how do you configure it? Thank You
