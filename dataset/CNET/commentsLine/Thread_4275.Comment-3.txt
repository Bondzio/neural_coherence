hi robert and happy new year!
that's quite a site.
fortunately i can't find anything that applies - this is a good thing, (my interpretation).
wmp is up to 9.00.00.2980. directx was updated in the past two weeks.
i only have one mp3, it was from clint black's site and offered free.
other than that i don't download music files.
no worries about pirated software, just not worth it.
xp pro is patched and drivers are updated as far as i'm aware of.
virus, mal & spyware regularly scanned for.
i switched from digital to analog but still no joy on the headphones playback from the front jack.
this audio anomaly is mostly heard during system wav files (windows start, etc.)
or feed from internet stream or web sites playing midi or wav files.
i very seldom play audio cd's or video dvd's so i'm only trying to use the drive to exclude the sound card source.
i started with dell a couple days ago and they've had me disconnecting this and that and everything in between.
they seem to be looking for some sound issuing from a device but i can't seem to get them to understand that it is only heard through the speakers when played through the sound card.
i've moved the system, isolated the sub-woofer on a separate electric outlet, tested with two other speaker systems and as i mentioned plugged my headphones into the speaker output from the sound card and get the same results every time.
not sure where to turn at this point.
it's not keeping me from using the computer and isn't causing any problems elsewhere.
just something annoying.
i would like to simply un-install the sound card totally and replace it with a new one but right now i think this is dell's call.
i'm patient.
thanks bob, ron
