1.1.1	I recently received two, ECS GOAL3+ MOBO w/CPU (AMD Sempron 3000+).	St
1.1.2	I set them up following step by step procedure for bench checking...	St
1.1.3	The first MOBO works fine.	St
1.1.4	The second, the CPU Fan starts but nothing else.	St
1.1.5	I used the same power supply, memory, keyboard, monitor, and mouse in each mobo.	St
1.1.6	Why did the second fail to function correctly?	St
1.1.7	Is it a bad CPU?	St
1.1.8	or could the CMOS Battery be bad on the second mobo?	St
1.2.1	This has to be done in order to be nothing is amiss.	St
1.2.2	Small things can be forgotten or taken for granted.	St
1.2.3	I would under these circumstances return the bad one and just leave it at that.	St
1.2.4	The longer you play with it may cause further problem(s), then they can blame you.	St
1.2.5	use the warranty and state one works and the other doesn't under the same test bed.	St
1.2.6	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	After disassembly, I reassembled and rechecked the second Mobo.	St
1.3.2	When it still failed, I Then, rechecked the first mobo with same items and it still works...	St
1.3.3	Thanks, for your help.	St
1.3.4	I will get it returned...	St
1.3.5	I'd still like to know why it failed... Do you know?	St
1.3.6	Or is it more testing required?	St
1.3.7	(I am not a techie.	St
1.3.8	I just follow instructions well.)	St
1.3.9	Thanks for your help...	St
1.4.1	I can't say for sure as at this level its more of a close inspection type of thing.	St
1.4.2	I check the solder runs, and shorts or bent points, broken contacts, etc., that could be at fault.	St
1.4.3	You could swap the bios(if socketed) and see if that helps.	St
1.4.4	Sometimes, it just so.	St
1.4.5	Maybe s/h damage or the bios needs an update, etc., Some jumper or setting isn't right.	St
1.4.6	Poor soldering or similar.	St
1.4.7	Maybe a blown capacitor already, or even worse an outdated version/rev.	St
1.4.8	wasn't done from the factory, then look at the stickers/decals and/or silk-screened info.	St
1.4.9	really, its out of your hands as very possibility you couldn't fix it and would you want to as warranty comes into play.	St
1.4.10	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	Your recent input was most helpful...	St
1.5.2	Thanks a million...	St
1.5.3	The mobo is on its way back... Have a great day Willy.	St
