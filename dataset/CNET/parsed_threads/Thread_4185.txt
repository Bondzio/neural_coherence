<s> so at best buy and i bought a PNY 9600 GSO overclocked edtion for my new christmas PC. </s>
<s> It says it needs a minimum 400wat PSU, but the system only has a 250watt. </s>
<s> i installed it and it runs great the fan is queit not always on full like the 7900gt i tried before, and it doesn't flicket out of games, do i need to update my powersupply to be safe, is this bad, can the PSU eventually die, will the card automatically tone it's self down to not draw so much power? </s>
<s> thanks, bigboy </s>
<s> The maker has recommended a 400W psu, that isn't a suggestion. </s>
<s> Sooner or later you'll find out why. </s>
<s> For now, your 250W is making it but won't for long. </s>
<s> Just get the new 400W or greater psu ASAP. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>

<s> The average car will break down eventually. </s>
<s> Try that with your proper size truck and it works for a very long time. </s>
<s> Sorry if its a bad analogy. </s>
