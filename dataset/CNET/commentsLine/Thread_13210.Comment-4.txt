i remember using the computer's name and the find function.
once the computer i was at found the other computer, i could then do file sharing or whatever i wanted.
just because the computers don't show up on each other screen doesn't always mean you can't get one computer to find and work with another computer.
i do remember that if one computer didnot find the another computer it was usally caused by the computer being disconnected.
i then rebooted all the computers and then tried again.
