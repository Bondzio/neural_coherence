I have a IBM clone PC with an AOpen MK77M motherboard, one 120Gb HDD and one 119Gb HDD, 2 x 512MB DDR2 Memory. I use some old hard drives in a caddy for storage. In an earlier discussion I received lots of help on how to get my 40Gb HDD (Quantum Fireball drive) to be formatted to its proper size for use as storage in the caddy. I finally did it with my Windows XP installation CD and with the Quantum set as the primary slave, but it has put another version of Windows XP onto my PC which doesn't work properly. My start up hangs, showing two OS's. If I leave the PC alone it tries to start the top highlighted version but then hangs as it is missing files. If, when I see the two OS's at start up and highlight the second one on the list my PC starts as it always did. I have looked around in the PC files.(Not in the registry though) But I can't find any way to clear this flawed OS out other than running XP again but I'd lose all the other stuff I need on my PC. Any help would be really appreciated. Kind regards. Bob.
