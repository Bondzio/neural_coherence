you can configure the bizhub to have a static ip address through the menu on the printer itself.
it is like this with every single network printer we have in my office (around 35 right now).
we have a bizhub 350 and it did come w/ software but you need to assign the static ip via the menu on the printer (should have a little lcd screen or touch screen).
set it to whatever ip you would like (so long as it is not conflicting w/ another ip address on the network).
wait a few minutes then try to ping the ip address you just manually assigned the bizhub.
