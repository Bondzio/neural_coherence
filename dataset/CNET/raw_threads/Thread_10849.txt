5699	0	193627	2090490	NR	Disneyfan	7/25/06 11:01 AM	1.15382526E12	Three beeps and off	We have an old IBM NetVista desktop computer running Windows XP. When we power it on, it gives 3 beeps and then powers off. If we go through this many, many times it eventually does power up and seems to run ok until we power it off again and then the cycle starts over. Any ideas on what could be wrong?
