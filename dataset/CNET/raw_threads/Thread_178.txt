Is that true? I will have a N desktop, G laptop, and G X-Box 360. So if I connect the laptop and 360 to the network, it will not be an N network? If that's the case, then it seems like I am better off just sticking with my G router that I have. The other option the sales rep at CC told me was what he did in the same situation at his own home: use a Wireless N router and a Wireless G router in combination and use MAC address discrimination between N and G devices to determine which router they use.

It is the only router that allows operation of both bands at the same time - which means it is the best router to use in a mixed environment of 802.11 a/b/g/n devices (similar routers such as the Buffalo WZR-AG300NH and D-Link DIR-855 have not been released) PCWorld Magazine has named it &quot;THE&quot; router to beat On a personal note - I have one with the following devices connected full-time or on-demand: -Dell XPS M1330 Notebook (wireless) -D-Link VoIP switch -PlayStation 3 (Wireless) -PSP (wireles) -iPod Touch (wireless) -Buffalo LinkStation -HP-Officejet Pro L7680 AIO printer See my review of the Linksys WRT600N by clicking on my screen name.
