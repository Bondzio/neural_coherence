I forgot to mention that to replace that 25 pin boxed SCSI drive you'll likely have to piecemeal a solution from a few makers.
I'd look to GRANITE for their adapters from 50 or 68 pin SCSI drives I see for sale all over (Newegg.com has those drives) to the 25 pin outlet.
You'll either find a new drive housing or modify one to get over your last run.
You can finish this but I doubt you will find NIB ready to use 25 pin SCSI drive in a box like we did 10 years ago.
This is going to be not so much fun but is par for the course as old technology exits.
