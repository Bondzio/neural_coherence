in case you didn't notice, this is a forum where people share their knowledge and expertise.
i am in this forum to get familiar with something that is unfamiliar to me.
i have never built anything.
i want to become familiar with different tools and hardware that might be helpful for my project.
again, this is a class project.
i plan on doing this myself.
to resort to calling people names is uncalled for, undeserved and unnecessary especially when all i simply want to do is to become familiar with materials in a hardware store.
nonetheless, i thank you for your previous help but i wish that you did not give your input in the first place if you were going to write such such a mean-spirited second posting.
i can assure you, i will not use your idea or your design.
