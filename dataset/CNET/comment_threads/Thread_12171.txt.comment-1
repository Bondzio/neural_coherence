Nvidia does not recognise Intel core 2CPU as 4400GHz but as 2MHZ Hello My question is as follow I have a PC equipped with an Intel Core 2 CPU 4400@2.00GHZ and 1.99GHZ 2.00GB of RAM Also I have my PC equipped with an NVIDIA graphic card GeForce 8500GT I was running a performance test with the game Half-Life 2 Low Coast, and in the test it was written that my system does not meet the requirement for the game, WHY??
Because the test found that my system is equipped with only 2.0GHz CPU and the game requires at least 2.9GHz Does any one knows how to Make the graphic card (for games especially) to recognize the Core 2 CPU.
Is there a difference between a dual Core 2 and a Core 2 CPU I had a Pentim 4 running at 3.7GHz was is better performance then the Core 2 CPU 4400@2.00GHZ??
thank you for any answer mourzilca
