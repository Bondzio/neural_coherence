<s> I ordered a new monitor for my 2.5yr old PC. </s>
<s> The monitor is a wide-screen with resolution of 1680x1050. </s>
<s> I looked at my video card and it does not have this as a res (likley since wide-screens were not being offered at the time). </s>
<s> I downloaded an updated driver but it still does not support that resolution (I also made sure to show all resolutions, not just the ones supported by my current monitor). </s>
<s> So I guess I need a new video card and I am trying to figure which to buy. </s>
<s> I currently have the NVIDEA GeFORCE4 MX 440 with AGP 8x. </s>
<s> I mainly use the pc for photo editing, not really for games (the only game played is SIMS2 occasionaly). </s>
<s> I've looked at some cards but they were close to $200 which is more than I would like to spend, would rather put it towards a new PC is I were going to spend that. </s>
<s> Any advice on which to purchase, which brand is good, and what I need to know when purchasing a graphics card???? </s>
<s> Also, the new monitor is both digital and analog. </s>
<s> My current monitor is only analog, and that is the only way it connects to the PC. </s>
<s> If I buy a new video card, would it allows to use either analog or video, or is that dependent on another factor. </s>
<s> Basically I am cluseless with video cards as I've never had to upgrade or replace it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help... </s>
<s> The video card often takes a cue from the monitor as to resolutions. </s>
<s> Did you install the monitor's driver yet? </s>

<s> No, I haven't received the new monitor yet- should receive it this week. </s>
<s> But I did go into the control panel/display/settings/advance and un-checked &quot;hide modes this monitor can not display.&quot; Since I did not see the one I specified above, I am assuming this is an issue with the video-card and not with the monitor driver. </s>
<s> I would hope you are right, but from what I've read, it sounds like I likely need a new card. </s>
<s> The monitor can't support it. </s>
<s> You may be replacing a card that could do the task but that's up to you to decide whether to try the monitor.inf or driver and hook it up for a test. </s>
<s> Your time and money... Bob </s>
<s> I guess I will wait then until I receive the monitor. </s>
<s> Is it possible to download the driver onto my PC without the new monitor, and seeing if I can change the resolution, or would my current monitor be disabled as a result? </s>
<s> Since I don't see you supplying links to said driver or the contents of the usual MONITOR.INF file I'll just comment I've seen a few replace the card without need. </s>

<s> I tried to download the driver from Dell, but for some reason when I select the model, it brings me back to selecting which display- I am not sure if there is a problem with the site or some other reason. </s>
<s> So unfortunately can not provide a link. </s>
<s> I currently have the hp pavilion vf17. </s>
<s> http://www.dellcommunity.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=dim_monitor&message.id=63323 Yes it comes with the CD with the monitor.inf and profiles so video drivers know what modes and resolutions to present to you. </s>
