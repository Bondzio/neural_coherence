My document folder is suddenly out of alphabetical order. i have checked for a virus, and there are none. I checked my spyware, and got rid of those.....but it is still out of order. Can't figure out how to get it back. a Jumbled mess. Thanks! Pf

What are you using to look at the document folder. If Explorer, just click on the heading of the file list to resort the list. If it's icon placement in Explorer, I've never seen this &quot;stick&quot; and you'll have to complain to Microsoft but I know of no cure for that one. If it occurs in File, Open from &quot;Word&quot; then read this article -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=211434 Bob
