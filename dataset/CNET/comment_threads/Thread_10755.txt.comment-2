You would be the first to make such work that I would know of.
It's your board, your choice and your roll of the dice.
At least replacement motherboards could be cheap.
In closing, the AGP power supply chips, capacitors, resistors, inductors and such should also be absent.
Even as a embedded hardware designer, getting all the proper parts and more would test my patience and certainly I would not do it.
