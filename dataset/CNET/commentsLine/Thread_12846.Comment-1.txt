got a new laptop, the cd drive has been acting up horribly.
cds read at an incredibly low speed (like half an hour for a 170mb install) and whenever i try burning a cd i receive an error message.
after the error message, the drive will appear to continue doing things indefinitely, and the eject button doesn't work.
is this the drive that is messed up or is it a software problem?
