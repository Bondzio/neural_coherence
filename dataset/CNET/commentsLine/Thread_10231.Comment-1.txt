hi i have a problem involving my computer.
recently it turns itself off after a few seconds of switching it on.
the symptoms goes like this: after a long period of dormancy, when i press the on button, it switches itself on for about 20 seconds before turning itself off.
subsequent tries to switch it on, it will switch off by itself after 1 - 2 seconds.
i have tried the following: 1) changed power supply 2) changed power supply cable 3) connect to different power sockets, (i.e.
different rooms in the house) 4) only connect using the power supply cable (i.e.
monitor, speaker cables are all not connected) all the above failed to resolve the problem.
however, the annoying thing is, whenever i bring the computer over to the technician's place, it works perfectly well!
it can switch on and remain switched on for hours.
the moment i bring it home and try to switch on at home, it failed.
does anyone know what can be the cause of this?
any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks.
