I was thinking the same thing and loaded the drivers and software on the wireless laptop and still couldn't it to work.
A friend of mine has the same router and printer setup I do and has no trouble at all getting his wireless laptop to print.
The big difference is both his desktop and laptop are Windows 7 Home premium.
It must be a problem with Windows 7 and Vista not working with each other causing the problem.
The techs at BB said it wouldn't work, but they were also trying to sell me either a wireless print server or wireless printer.
I am going to another computer tech today that does this for his living and see what he says about it.
Will let you know what he says.
