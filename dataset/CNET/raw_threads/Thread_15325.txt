Basically, the only reason I'm interested in a Mac is Final Cut Pro. I've narrowed my choice down to the I Mac 20&quot; and the PowerMac 2GHz. What I want to know is how much of a difference the dual processor makes? The Power Mac is about $350 more with less features ao I'm assuming that's the big reason for the price difference. Also, if anyone has any experience with Final Cut, is the dual display capability of the Power Mac worth the extra money or is the single screen sufficient? Thanks in advance for any help

It's not so much the editing that presses the CPU(s), but any effects or encoding. Simple editing and you can skimp on the CPU. Can I ask why your Apple contact can't discuss this? Most are far more knowledgable than your usual PC dispenser. Bob

To do that you will have to get the PowerMac G5 as the iMac does not support two monitors except in mirror mode. Dual Processors will churn through the work, especially with Final Cut. THis is one of those programs, made by Apple, that take advantage of the OS, the hardware and the dual processors. However, you will have to purchase a couple of decent monitors to do your work on. If I were spending your money, two 30&quot; Apple LCD's would be superb. As I'm not, you might want to look for a 30&quot; Apple and a 17&quot; something else. Digital of course. The other big price difference is probably due to the G5 processor and the logic board in the tower allow for a faster speed than the same processor on the iMac board. P
