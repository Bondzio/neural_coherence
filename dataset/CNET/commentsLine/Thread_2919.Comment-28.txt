while using the laptop one day, the whole system crashes, that is; it went hanging - therfore it was forced to stop inorder to reset.
but, unfortunately the windows 2000 wouldn't boot up, i.e.
wouldn't open up at all...permanently.
send to a repair shop and was told hard-disk suffers 'mechanical failure'-sommething like the motor-drive inside is sort of jammed and could no longer function.
you can hear the mechanical &quot;clacking&quot; sound it produced.
in the end, replaced with a new drive to put back the laptop to operational service.
the faufty drive was thus set aside - considered unrepairable.
all my datas inside are lost,could not be recovered... regards, ray quah
