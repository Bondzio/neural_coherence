i have upgraded to windows 7 ultimate (32) on my laptop and just finished building a new desktop with windows 7 (64).
didn't have any trouble obtaining drivers for any of my peripherals, though none are older than 3 years.
i might just add here that i am basically a microsoft hater, but i think they may have finally gotten windows right with windows7.
