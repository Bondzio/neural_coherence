1.1.1	I got a used desktop , and have a number of upgrades I would like to make to it .	St
1.1.2	But first I have to get it running .	St
1.1.3	When you push the power button , the power button comes on but the hard drives are not spinning and the display does not change , not even to show the BIOS .	St
1.1.4	I think this may be either the motherboard or the graphics card .	St
1.1.5	Does anybody know which ?	Ques
1.2.1	Sorry , but you gave no clue of the system details and all that .	St
1.2.2	Its best to provide as much as possible otherwise , expect more questions just to get at a starting point .	St
1.2.3	Remove all connections to drives .	St
1.2.4	Now power-ON , what are the results ?	Ques
1.2.5	Is there now a display of any system respose NOT the display 's own lost signal message or similar ?	Ques
1.2.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I did n't think the specs would be relevant , so could you tell me what you need ?	Ques
1.3.2	I tried the hard drive thing before I posted this .	St
1.3.3	but there is no bios .	St
1.3.4	Specs : MS XP Home , computer is a Gateway , It says the model no .	St
1.3.5	is Atxaeg , graphics card is a nVidia 8860 .	St
1.3.6	Let me know what else you need .	St
1.4.1	Since you think the specs are irrelevant then the answers may be irrelevant to this machine .	St
1.4.2	To save volunteers from asking this question and having a post 20 entries long before we can get down to work , why not help others help you .	St
1.4.3	Remember these are member to member forums , no paid staff so make it easy .	St
1.4.4	Thing of the person who wants to help you change your flat tire .	St
1.4.5	They ask you to point to where the flat is and you tell them it 's not important .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	I do n't think that is an accurate analogy .	St
1.5.2	I do n't need to know how to fix it .	St
1.5.3	I was just asking for a second opinion of what was broken .	St
1.6.1	There is no need to chew my head off for being mistaken .	St
1.7.1	I wanted to share that these forums are all volunteer , all member to member .	St
1.7.2	Which means you get to try a little harder .	St
1.7.3	No paid staff also means that a few members get upset over & quot ; tech support. & quot ; I apologize for my analogy but I have many more to choose from .	St
1.7.4	But let 's get back to YOUR discussion .	St
1.7.5	All that I wanted to share I have , now it 's time for you to decide if it 's worth helping others help you .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	But let 's cover a common no boot spins drives issue .	St
1.8.2	Many forget about that little battery on the motherboard .	Sug
1.8.3	Some motherboards will not boot when that the battery voltage is too low .	St
1.8.4	This is why details matter .	St
1.8.5	I ca n't tell if this machine is known to have that issue .	St
1.8.6	Make it easy on others with machine details otherwise you get guesses and maybe bad ones .	St
1.8.7	Bob	St
1.9.1	I 'm not looking for free tech support .	St
1.9.2	You seem to think this is the first time i 've looked at a computer .	St
1.9.3	The make of my motherboard is an Intel Desktop board D850mv	St
1.10.1	But when we want to talk about a machine , it 's best to know what it is .	St
1.10.2	Leading off with the above can send folk away from helping out with ideas .	St
1.10.3	While you seem to want to debate this , why not go with the forum flow ?	Ques
1.10.4	Just put in the details so others wo n't run away .	St
1.10.5	http : //pixel01.cps.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-009007.htm gives a second idea .	St
1.10.6	This board may also exhibit this issue with a not-so-good power supply or that adapter Intel writes about .	St
1.10.7	Details are needed , a Volt Meter on that battery is a good idea .	St
1.10.8	Bob	St
1.11.1	The light on the motherboard is green , so I don ; t think it is the power supply .	St
1.11.2	Voltage test got the promised three volts	St
1.12.1	http : //pixel01.cps.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-009007.htm gives us more about what or why the PSU can cause a failed boot .	St
1.12.2	Let 's say you want to troubleshoot a dead PC .	St
1.12.3	The tried and true method is to remove all but the PSU , motherboard , CPU+HSF and the Speaker .	St
1.12.4	If those parts are good then the speaker sounds in protest of all the missing other parts .	St
1.12.5	If not , we are staring at the last 4 possible parts .	St
1.12.6	Bob	St
1.13.1	I posted to remove all connections to all drives .	St
1.13.2	This way it releases the power burden for that and if those devices actually hold back the boot in h/w manner .	St
1.13.3	Plus , if the display changes , it gives a clue .	St
1.13.4	Since you have a Gateway system which is OEM but no model # .	St
1.13.5	The model # is on a decal or sticker somewhere on the system along side the serial # .	St
1.13.6	I do n't recall a Atxeag model , sorry .	Polite
1.13.7	Certain models may have proprietary PSUs or give a clue to the age of the system .	St
1.13.8	In no uncertain terms , it maybe too old/unique to find replacements or deal with as costs may factor in .	St
1.13.9	Regardless , that is very important to me to ask as now I know to search for specs and such at support websites .	St
1.13.10	Upon visiting the Gateway support website , enter the serial # , should give clue to day1 , when it was build what it consisted of .	St
1.13.11	In most cases where a system wo n't power-ON , then simply replace PSU with a similar or greater wattage unit .	St
1.13.12	If it still does n't work , then deal with the mtrbd.. At this time reduce the system to bare minimum to help progress .	St
1.13.13	An old system as Robert stated , replace the bios battery as they do n't last forever .	St
1.13.14	Also , the LED that 's on the mtrbd .	St
1.13.15	is NOT a real clue solver other than to say , yeah there 's SOME power , but a PSU supplies various voltages and amps , etc .	St
1.13.16	if one fails it all fails .	St
1.13.17	Sorry , if seemly I ask dumb questions , but from my prospective , there are no dumb question when getting to the nitty-gritty .	St
1.13.18	I did a quick google of atxaeg and found some users do n't know the support website has any info .	St
1.13.19	Which makes me think this maybe a foreign model or somehow , unique system .	St
1.13.20	Further , the atxeag also may have additional numbers to narrow down the system model # .	St
1.13.21	ie : http : //www.fixya.com/support/t2402546-need_set_up_ram_gateway_atxaeg_lx3_700s ie : http : //forum.servomagazine.com/viewtopic.php ? f=2 & t=14858 BTW , if the mtrbd .	St
1.13.22	is at fault , then do you want to even try to fix it .	St
1.13.23	Far too often replacing the mtrbd .	St
1.13.24	is best due to cost and/or time involvement , FYI .	St
1.13.25	I hope this all helps , come back with results .	St
1.13.26	tada -- -- -Willy	St
