<s> I guess my dreams of a huge LCD is out until I get a new rig. </s>
<s> So figured I'd go with what everyone says it one of the best brands - LG. </s>
<s> Anyone know whats the difference between the identically appearing 22&quot; models from BestBuy (L226WTQ-BF) or the internet (L226WTY-BF)? </s>
<s> BestBuy Newegg Thanks </s>
<s> i can't find any info on LG's website about the L226WTY-BF so it's probably slightly newer but the BB price on the ...Q-BF is great. </s>
<s> both have HDCP (required for Vista certification) so you'll be able to play hi-def copy-protected material on both. </s>
<s> if you plan on only using the monitor with your PC (and never plan on connecting it to a cable/set-top box), go with price and get the Q-BF. </s>
<s> if you want/need 720p/1080i/1080p (hi-def TV) input, then check to see if the ...Y-BF can handle those signals via DVI/component input and decide if the extra functionality is worth the extra $50. </s>
<s> also, take a look at the westinghouse LCM-22W3 which is 22&quot; and has DIV and component inputs and can handle hi-def TV signals (often on sale at BB for less than $300; i'm very happy with mine). </s>
<s> Bestbuy regularly orders custom units from manufacturers and lists them with a slightly different model number. </s>
<s> I'm not sure but the cynic in me believes it gives them an out for that famous low price guarantee. </s>
<s> These units are often missing a feature or two. </s>
<s> So unless you're into immediate gratification, go with the unit from Newegg. </s>
<s> the bestbuy model (L226WTQ-BF) is listed on LG's website. </s>
<s> http://us.lge.com/products/model/detail/computer%20products_lcd%20monitors_full%20line%20of%20lcd%20monitors_L226WTQ-BF.jhtml the newegg model (L226WTY-BF) is NOT listed on LG's website but newegg has a photo of the product sticker. </s>
<s> newegg images of LG L226WTY-BF note that the &quot;product code&quot; is L226WTY-BF but the &quot;model no.&quot; (under the barcode) is L226WTQ. </s>
<s> so, its them same monitor but has confusing labelling. </s>
