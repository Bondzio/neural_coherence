sorry to say i have the same problem with an epson stylus color 880 ever since it sucked in two sheets of heavy glossy photo paper at one time.
had a tough time removing them.
i suspect that damaged the nozzles.
changing cartridges did not help.
unlike some other mfg printers, the epson nozzles are not part of the cartridge.
i tried everything you did & everything the epson help desk suggested except taking it to one of their repair stations.
