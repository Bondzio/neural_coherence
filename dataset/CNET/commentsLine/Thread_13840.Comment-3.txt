where do i find this thumbs.db?
i assumed it was a windows problem.
but how do i correct that?
i know the cd roms are fine because i installed them in another computer and they worked fine.
it's only in my computer and thats why i thoughts it is a corrupted drive.
the computer worked fine for over a year.. bob
