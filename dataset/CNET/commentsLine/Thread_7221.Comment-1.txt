hi, i'm wondering if the ati radeon hd7750 would be okay to use in an hp pavillion 6610f system with a 250w psu.
i know a 400w supply is recommended for it, but i've read a few others' opinions that say 250w would be fine because of the card's low power draw.
i just want to make sure if it'll work or not before i consider buying a new psu.
my system specs: amd athlon ii x4 635(2.90ghz) 4gb ddr3 750gb sataii 7200rpm dvd-rw ati radeon hd 4200 graphics windows 7 64-bit 250w lite-on ps-5251 08, 12v@14a
