It still freezes at 60 fps sometimes. I tried to play Lineage II. . .same result. i suspect that this may be overheating or my outdated hardware, but i'm not sure what to upgrade according to EVEREST Home Edition: OS: Win2000 Pro CPU: Intel Pentium 4, 2.4 GHz VGA: GeForce FX 5200 [128 MB, AGP 8x] Memory: 512 MB [two 256MB DDR SDRAM] Temperatures Motherboard:

Read here: CPU Coolers . Don't buy a cheap one, expect to pay 3$30 - $45,also use a good thermal compound such as Arctic Silver 5. The folks that make the CPU coolers also make VGA coolers. Check for one that will be compatible with your graphics card.

I do suspect your temperature readings are not accurate because if your resting CPU temp is 48*C, you should see a larger jump in temp than 2*C. You should be able to get that CPU idle temp into the 30's (C) range with a good heatsink and fan (HSF) and thermal compound. What does SpeedFan (free from Download.com) say about your system, CPU and gfx card temps? Before you go to the expense and effort of changing out the CPU heatsink and fan (HSF), try adding the largest fan to the rear exhaust of your box that will fit (120mm if possible). Also, tell us the PSU Wattage and mfg. if possible. Another thing to try is to give your computer a good cleaning with regard to viruses and spyware. Turn off all unnecessary background programs when gaming. Ultimately you might be running those games with too much detail for that gfx card. Assuming you have an AGP 8X slot, I'd consider an upgrade to an nVidia 6800 family video card if SpeedFan tells you your current hardware temps are OK.
