I bought a BT wireless card for my laptop and this works ok. I have a Fujisu Siemens CORDANT M P300 1 512MB SNR 3843630597. I am not sure if I can install a wireless net work card like BT Voyager 1040 Wireless Network Card or is it best to use an external Bt voyager wireless PC adapter USB lead Thanks Mo.
