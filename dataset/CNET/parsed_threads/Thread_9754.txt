<s> So I have been getting screwed by the company Ebellking, it seems they have a history littered all over the net of disappointed and let down customers. </s>
<s> I believe making a small compilation of just a few of the complaints i found in 10 minutes of this company may save some people money, where so many of us seem to have lost. </s>
<s> In this day of online lottery buying I believe we should look out for each other on things like this. </s>
<s> DO NOT TRUST EBELLKING http://www.amazon.co.uk/Help-please-locked-Chinese-test/forum/Fx1DBIDSXCYCEJH/Tx3HDOUTCZT9KVK/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B006M07X34 http://www.blogandroid.net/latest-ebellking-letdown/ http://androidbydavis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/android-by-davis-ebellking-living-up-to.html#1 http://androidbydavis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/android-by-davis-ebellking-living-up-to.html#1 http://complaintwire.org/complaint/aChZuQrbnwU/ebellking http://complaintwire.org/complaint/8iZc_UdYxQU/ebellking-com http://complaintwire.org/complaint/uUWX-6IZKQU/ebellking-com http://complaintwire.org/complaint/67dAi5eznAU/ebellking http://complaintwire.org/complaint/oropZWWYUgU/ebellking http://complaintwire.org/complaint/PlVfmNO8AgU/ebellking-com http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B006FZXJJ8 </s>
<s> I checked the rest and they are fine, but if a mod could remove the 'blogandroid' link that would be great. </s>
<s> 2nd link down. </s>
<s> Seems like there's been no improvement in their products or there customer service, I bought 2 Flytouch 8 last week 19 Sept 2012, one seemed ok until you tried to down load anything from app store, just get error message no matter what, second one took 3 or 4 attempts to boot up and when it did the camera didn't work, by day 2 it wouldn't turn on at all. </s>
<s> I was told I had to return them to there office in China, because the package weighed 3.5kg it would &#163;80, a friend of mine bought one at the same time was given a return address in Surrey! </s>
<s> When questioned about this I was told the UK address was a post office address only and if I didn't return it to china I wouldn't get a refund. </s>
<s> At this point we both started a dispute with paypal, hopefully anyone buying from them has paid by paypal, if your not happy start a dispute within 20 days that way there is a chance you may get your money back, hopefully if enough people go down this route they will blacklist them, once this was done I was informed I could send the tablets back to there UK address, I will be posting parcel tomorrow so will update this post regularly untill it is resolved. </s>

<s> TW20 9HN United Kingdom Also fill one of these forms in for Surrey trading standards, they are aware of this company, my friend actualy got a call from them wanting more informatiion, so hopefully they will be shutting them down soon. </s>

<s> I too have been stung by this company. </s>
<s> I had seen some of the bad reviews before purchasing from them, but figured I would be ok. </s>
<s> I bought my daughter a N90 Yuanda tablet for her Christmas. </s>
<s> Very quick delivery and to be fair it has been a good enough tablet for the money (&#163;139.99) but I noticed last week it had developed a mark on the screen, in the shape of a circle, right in the middle of the screen. </s>
<s> Its as if the display has kind of &quot;burn out&quot; in that area. </s>
<s> I contacted them by email and even attached a video of me showing the mark for proof. </s>
<s> Their answer was for me to return it to China at my expense (&#163;50 by DHL) to have it fixed AND for me to pay the return postage. </s>
<s> I would be cheaper buying a new tablet!? </s>
<s> What with their very broken english and resistance to help any further, I have to say I have kind of given up. </s>
<s> I have told them I would be leaving negative feedback everywhere I could, and got no further response. </s>
<s> They really don't care. </s>
<s> I knew I took a gamble buying from China but PLEASE don't anyone else take that risk. </s>
<s> I ordered this tablet (Vido N90S) from Ebellking exactly a week ago, and today it was delivered to my door from Hong Kong. </s>
<s> I was worried, because I read a lot of negative review on other sites from Ebellking about their costumer service. </s>
<s> In my case everithyng seems to be simple and easy and no costumer service needed. </s>
<s> I paid by paipal a week ago and I got the tablet. </s>
<s> It was packed carefully to protect the content. </s>
<s> The charger was in a separate box and I got a UK adapter with it. </s>
<s> The unit was in a Vindo branded box, exactly as it was advertised, or as I saw it on youtube videos about this device. </s>
<s> The unit by the way seems to be much better than on the youtube videos. </s>
<s> The box was open, and someone might have used a unit before me for a few hours, probably to test it and adjust it to the UK. </s>
<s> It came with the newest official firmware from Vido. </s>
<s> The language was set up to English, most of the chinise apps were removed. </s>
<s> I found as a chinese language app only the factory installed e-book reader on the device, which takes you to a chinese ebook store. </s>
<s> The default browser is not the chrome, but it is working with the BBC iplayer, which I successfully installed from the Google Play Store. </s>
<s> I also installed the you tube app and skype, both working fine. </s>
<s> The screen is not an IPS on this modell, but if you use it in a normal position, colours are really nice and the brightness and contrast are perfect. </s>
<s> I havent discovered any dead pixel yet. </s>
<s> The built of the product doesn't seem to be cheap at all. </s>
<s> Although it's not an IPad, I think it can be a concurent of that, especially if you take into account the pricetag. </s>
<s> Some apps in the playstore are incompatible with this device, some you can't see at all. </s>
<s> ITV player is not working with this firmware, and a program for watching the hungarian RTL Klub TV programs is just missing. </s>
<s> The last one is working perfectly on my Galaxy S II. </s>
<s> The wifi signal might be weaker than on other tablets, as I read in other reviews. </s>
<s> It's a nice surprise that it's not weaker than on my Galaxy S II, so I can browse the net and watch streaming videos on this device in the next room too. </s>
<s> Distance is about 10 meter and there is one wall between the router (Standard Virgin Media) and me. </s>
<s> I bought it actually for reading ebooks which are in PDF and DJVU. </s>
<s> I think it is really worth the price, and I will use it for a lot of other things too. </s>
<s> Working of the device is really smooth and responsive, as you can expect it from a dual core. </s>
<s> Thank you Ebellking, I am fully satisfied with your prodict at the moment. </s>
