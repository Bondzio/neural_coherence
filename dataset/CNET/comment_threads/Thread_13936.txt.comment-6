does make excellent PSUs.
I say that because I own a number of them and the reviews from Tech Sites as well as buyer are universally very favorable.
Here's a source (online vendor) that has good selection, attractive pricing, buyer product reviews, etc., etc., http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007657+50001459&QksAutoSuggestion=&ShowDeactivatedMark=False&Configurator=&IsNodeId=1&Subcategory=58&description=&Ntk=&CFG=&SpeTabStoreType=&srchInDesc= Recommend getting as much PSU wattage as you need for your current system and the reasonably near future...say 2-4 years and your budget will afford.
Questions...just ask.
Let us know what you select and how you like it.
