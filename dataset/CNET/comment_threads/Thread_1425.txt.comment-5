When I started thinking about a new computer a year or so ago I thought of the DIY route.
I looked over a few tutorials and parts over at Newegg.
I think I could build one just fine, my problem would be being my own Tech Support.
The idea of syncing RAM, configuring a RAID setup, and a couple other things freaked me out a little too.
I may drop into BB and see what they've got.
Another route I thought of was Costco, which sells Dell with I believe a 90 day No Questions return policy.
