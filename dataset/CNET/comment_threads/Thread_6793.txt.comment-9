having borderline amt of RAM to run the OS won't get any decent performance, or even ability to run games.
Having somewhat higher than the min will allow u to play lower-end/older PC games better, but which probably won't end up using the might of the muscular vid card since those games aren't likely to have great textures, graphics, lighting/shading, and other visual effects having a crappy vid card but lots of RAM, again probably limited to flash games and lower-end/older PC games.
Ditto if the vid card were slightly above low-end.
U'd actually be able to play higher end games decentl, but with features and details turned off/down.
If it came down to these 2, I would go latter for work, as generous RAM is certainly a performance/productivity booster.
For home, the former, as i would just upgrade RAM right away, which is the easier of the 2 to upgrade.
