ok rereading i see what you are asking.
you can buy 2 single strand cables but it is a pain.
buy what you call a fused cable which is called dual strand in most sites.
the ends can be unsnapped and swapped very easy if the orientation is not correct... generally most companies they are crossed on short cables just like you need.
