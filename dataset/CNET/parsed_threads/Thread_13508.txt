<s> I'm new here, and I'm not sure how to post help requests, so here goes.... </s>
<s> Win XP sp2 Homemade computer with ABIT sd7-533 motherboard Memory (RAM) in MB:768 Processor type:Intel P4 Processor speed (MHz):2.6 GHz Hard Drive Capacity:38 GB I have a Netgear FA311 network card connected to a WGR614 (v4) wireless router for my home network. </s>
<s> It was working fine until last week -now, when I try to disable the connection, I get an error box saying: &quot;Error disabling connection - it is not possible to diasble the connection at this time. </s>
<s> This connection may be using one or more protocols that do not support Plug-and-Play, or it may have been initiated by another user or the system account.&quot; The error seemed to occur after my spyware software (Aluria Spyware Remover) updated last week. </s>
<s> This error comes up even when my computer is the only one on the network. </s>
<s> I have tried: -system restore (which failed to restore the machine to before the spyware update) -uninstalling and reinstalling the network card using the device manager -changing the PCI slot the card is in Nothing seems to work. </s>
<s> It takes much longer for my machine to boot than before, probably because it is enabling the network everytime it is started. </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to disable my network - any help will be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> and can't google out any solution. </s>

<s> Down here im running pentium 4 and im getting that error message when i try to disable the wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Upstairs I have the exact same adapter, D-Link DWL-520 and it disables fine...I don't see how any running programs could affect something like this. </s>

<s> Here's some of my PC specs. </s>
<s> System: Microsoft Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 2 Computer: Intel Pentium 4 CPU 2.53GHz 1.92 GHz, 1.00GB of RAM Connection: 802.11g WLAN (125 mbps) ______________________________________________________ I just formatted, so I only installed my video and sound card drivers, SP2, Winamp, MSN and Firefox. </s>
<s> I never had the problem before with the same hardware. </s>
<s> I conventionally know little of computers, but my guess is that windows update or the Service Pack is running something new pertinent to wireless connectivity. </s>
