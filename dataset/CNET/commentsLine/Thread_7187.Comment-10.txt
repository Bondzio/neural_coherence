i am using my bose music system as the speakers for my desk top computer and the cable is plugged into the aux in of the bose.
i was wondering if they make an audio cable with 2 ends so that i could have one end hooked to my computer for speakers and one end to plug into my acer netbook so i could use the bose as speakeks for my netbook as well.
