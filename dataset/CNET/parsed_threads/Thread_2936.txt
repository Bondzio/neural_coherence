<s> I don't know why this is happening, it used to be that my cpu was always hotter until I cleaned the inside of my computer and removed all the dust. </s>

<s> actually I am just trying to cool down the hard drive. </s>
<s> I think that there might be something wrong with it (I keep hearing this sound (sounds like one of those machincal saws people use to cut wood). </s>
<s> I checked with Asus Probe - I got 29C for cpu and 44C for HD. </s>
<s> I also checked all the fans and the sound doesn't seem to be coming from them. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the sound is coming from the hard drive, if so what should I do? </s>
<s> My computer is new (1 year) and should I contact Asus? </s>
<s> Many now are rated only to 45C (used to be 50C.) </s>
<s> I'd leave the cover off to help the heat get out till you figure out why the case fans are not working. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I checked the fans, they're working perfectly, besides my cpu is not hot at all (29C) </s>
<s> You'll still want to cure the hot hot hot hard disk before it decides to melt and take what you didn't backup. </s>
<s> Let me be blunt. </s>
<s> Heat is bad. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Are there any case fans blowing over the HD? </s>
<s> If the HD's are up front, sometimes you have to purchase and install a front case fan for the HD. </s>
<s> There are other solutions as well, but it depends on the particulars of your case. </s>
<s> Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and modify your case or get a better one. </s>
<s> I am pretty sure that I won't need to add any more fans to my noisy computer. </s>
<s> Also this problem just started 3 weeks ago after the strange noises began appearing. </s>
<s> Before then my computer was fine, the HD was always 30C or so. </s>
<s> You can have success in cooling a computer system with many or few fans, but that is not the issue here. </s>
<s> I repeat: Do you have a fan that blows over the hard drive? </s>
<s> This is usually the front intake fan. </s>
<s> Many cases have a place for that fan, but mfgs. </s>
<s> do not install one there. </s>
<s> ASIDE: You can get larger and quieter fans to take care of your noise problem. </s>
<s> Check to see if the drive is functioning properly with the PowerMax utility from Maxtor.com. </s>
<s> to a location where it can dissipate heat OR add a fan directly infront of or on top of the HDD to reduce the heat. </s>
<s> Many if not not most PCs have fans at the bottom front of the case to induct cool air and move it directly over the internal HDDs. </s>
<s> There are lots of choices for case fans with different CFM and noise ratings.....with and wihtout temp and speed controls. </s>
<s> I was running SpinRite one day and noted the HDD temp. </s>
<s> Just for the heck of it I connected an 80MM case fan to blow air over it. </s>
<s> It was interesting to see how quickly the temp dropped. </s>
<s> I do not have a intake fan on the front of the computer (have those open slots for air flow)but I am sure the problem is not the fans because before my computer was working perfectly. </s>
<s> Also I changed the position of the HD so that there would be more air flow but there wasn't a big difference (about 1C lower sometimes). </s>
<s> I am using power max right now to check my HD, I'll post the results in a couple of minutes. </s>
<s> thanks again for your help </s>
<s> fans and system cooling is ... </s>
<s> I've never bought a case that didn't have at least 1 fan located at the front of the case. </s>
<s> One case I have has 3 80mm fans .. one at the very bottom front of the case and two more located at the front of the two drive cages. </s>
<s> And if get a chance look at some of the better cases...they all have fans located at the lower front of the case..check Lian Li VAPCMD </s>
<s> A friend of mine was having problems with his computer, so I stopped by his place yesterday to look at it. </s>
<s> He told me that he turned it on, and there was nothing on the monitor, and the activity light was not flashing at all. </s>
<s> The hardware was working fine though (Fans turning, DVD drive opens and closes, etc.). </s>
<s> When I stopped at his house to look at it, it was working fine. </s>
<s> I decided to update his video card driver, and make a few tweaks while I was there. </s>
<s> After about an hour or so, I restarted the computer and it showed the previously mentioned symptoms. </s>
<s> I reach in and touched the bay holding his hard drive, and it was effin' toasty. </s>
<s> I told him I'll swing by with an extra fan or 3 and we'll pop those babies in. </s>
<s> I'll let you know how that works out. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, if it was working fine before, and now it's overheating, I think the drive is on it's death bed. </s>
<s> I say back everything up now. </s>
<s> A few fans might delay the innevitable, but it's not going to keep it alive forever. </s>
<s> I'd back everything up and prepare to buy a new hard drive. </s>
<s> These other people can keep recommending software to monitor the drive all day, but if you know it's hot, you don't need a program to tell you what you already know. </s>
<s> did I mention that my computer was only 1 YEARS OLD!!! </s>
<s> I still have warrenty on my Hard Drive, 3 year warrenty </s>
<s> How much do you think I can sell my computer for (computer works fine in a room under 23C). </s>
<s> For pricing, search ''Completed listings'' on eBay.com for similarly configured computers. </s>
<s> Personally, I would try the largest fan that fits the front intake before giving up. </s>
<s> This can be done for under $10USD. </s>
<s> Much cheaper than a new computer. </s>
<s> I have a P4 3.0GHz (Northwood) in a mid-tower case (Antec SLK3700-BQE). </s>
<s> It has a 120mm rear exhaust fan and a 120mm front intake fan that blows over three HD. </s>
<s> The only other exhaust fan is in the PSU. </s>
<s> Each HD is below 40C. </s>
