Also downloaded the hp software from hp web page and installed an uninstalled the software Since the pop up appears even without the printer being connected, I believe the problem should be a piece of software that kind of &quot;identifies new hardware&quot; when there is none, as part of the process to install the printer when is part of the wireless network. Been looking for starting up options and can not find it do have another suggestion? thanks again for your kindly help, Leo

Right click my computer, left click properties, left click hardware, left click device manager. I used to get the installation problem when I installed my HP camera on my computer. It had to do with installing Photo Gallery. Rick
