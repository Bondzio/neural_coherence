<s> My sister-in-law has a Gateway computer with a DVD drive installed. </s>
<s> Since reinstalling the OS from the Gateway recovery disk, her DVD player will not read DVD's. </s>
<s> You can put a CD or a DVD in and open Explorer and view the contents. </s>
<s> But, when you use a DVD Player program (and I tried several to see if it was just a software problem) the programs come back with a message stating that no DVD player was found. </s>
<s> Everything looks good in device manager, My Computer shows it as a DVD player, and I've gone through an updated all the drivers. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on this??? </s>
<s> Thanks, Cameron </s>
<s> A little history of why the OS was reloaded (some OSes just get reinfected with worms upon such reinstalls), what DVD player Gateway supplied and no mention of what OS. </s>
<s> Write a little more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry, Bob, I should have put more information on it. </s>
<s> OS (Win 98) was reinstalled after a full reformat of the HD. </s>
<s> I can't remember now why she felt like she needed to do that. </s>
<s> The DVD was a Gateway installed ... the manufacturer started with an &quot;M&quot;, but I can't remember exactly who it was. </s>
<s> I'll e-mail her and find out. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>

<s> It does have issues with drivers. </s>
<s> The motherboard, audio, video and such drivers all need to be installed before I would expect a DVD to work. </s>
<s> BUT if I look at PowerDVD, it's default install in some versions needs a little help in finding the drive letter of the DVD. </s>
<s> Its in some options menu but since there are any number of versions, I leave it to you to find the menu and setting. </s>
<s> Next, the CD/DVD drives must NOT have any driver in CONFIG.SYS. </s>
<s> PLEASE share the contents of the CONFIG.SYS file to make sure it's ok. Bob </s>
