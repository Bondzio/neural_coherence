Unless you have super critical data on the HD, consider this a lost cause for the end user.
The &quot;clicking noise&quot; is a sure sign the HD is faulty in a h/w way or plain broken.
As already posted to you, call the pros if you need that data.
Otherwise, find another HD and reload and start over again.
You could have lessen the impact of losing the data if you &quot;back-up&quot;, I hope its a lesson learned once.
Last, don't buy a Maxtor HD, enuf said.
