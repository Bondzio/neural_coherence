<s> Hey everyone. </s>
<s> Here's my deal. </s>
<s> I use Logitech X-540, http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-X-540-5-1-Speaker-System/dp/B000JJM8XE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1216074034&sr=8-1 , for my surround sound setup. </s>
<s> It's not much, but I don't need anything more. </s>
<s> I have a quick question though. </s>
<s> Is there something like this product, http://www.amazon.com/Console-Adapter-Convert-Plugs-Single/dp/B0006U3ACY/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1216073334&sr=8-2 , but rather than the red and white RCA cables, it would be an optical audio cable that's converting to the 3 3.5mm cables? </s>
<s> Or is there anyway to convert an optical audio cable to that kind of output? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Optical = digital. </s>
<s> 3.5 mm = analog. </s>
<s> ...I guess that means it can't be done? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
