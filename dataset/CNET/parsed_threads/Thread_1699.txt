<s> I am about to build my first PC (attempt really but being positive) and wanted to get some feedback on what I have came up with so far. </s>
<s> I am working with a limited budget and chose my components based on being able to add &quot;more&quot; later when money is not so tight. </s>
<s> Basically I am going for a mid-low high end gaming PC that has some customization options for the future. </s>
<s> Motherboard and CPU - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4179115&CatId=3586 Memory - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3404049&Sku=O261-8038 HDD - also use a 500GB ext. </s>
<s> for media http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3255389&CatId=2458 CD/DVD - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3970770&Sku=L12-1166%20OEM Power Supply - I am curious about this one and what you all would suggest. </s>
<s> Since I wasn't sure I made room for a 750w power supply. </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3276567&Sku=ULT-LSP750 Case - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2477938&CatId=1842 Video Cards (to be added later) - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4209965&Sku=P450-9830 I plan on using Vista 64-bit to take advantage of the 4GB + memory. </s>
<s> From what I understand 32 only uses 3GB and recognizes the other 1GB as &quot;virtual memory&quot; if I have this fouled up please explain. </s>
<s> Also since I fully plan to upgrade later to the full 8GB that the mobo allows it seemed like the best choice. </s>
<s> Ok so let her rip and let me hear it, have I covered everything? </s>
<s> Would you make different choices and if so why? </s>
<s> I appreciate any and all help in this matter since I am very excited at the prospect of building my first &quot;rig&quot;, and am somewhat anxious to get underway with the contruction. </s>
<s> make sure you know what you're getting (and not getting) from tigerdirect. </s>
<s> that mobo/cpu bundle does not include a cpu cooler so you'll have to add another $30 or so for a decent one. </s>
<s> unless you plan on sli within 4-6 months, don't waste money on an sli mobo. </s>
<s> by october, a new $130 card will be as fast as or faster than dual 9800gt cards. </s>
<s> this mobo and cpu are $238 (no rebate hassles) includes a cooler and is much faster (2.6ghz vs 2.2ghz). </s>
<s> GIGABYTE GA-MA780G-UD3H, $90: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128382 AMD Phenom 9950 BLACK 2.6GHz, $148: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103291 i'd also steer clear of ultra power supplies. </s>
<s> they have about 3 different lines and a number of them are crap. </s>
<s> this 550w 80 plus certified will handle your pc as well as a lesser quality 700w unit: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817702008 </s>
<s> get a Phenom II 720 more clock, smaller process, more headroom, same price </s>
<s> the cheapest phenom ii x4 is the 810 at $180. </s>
<s> the fastest phenom ii is the 940 which is $150. </s>
<s> there is no pricing overlap between phenom and phenom ii. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice guys taking it all into consideration I think I have settled on this one - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103649 It's in my budget and I think it's a good processor that will handle anything I can throw at it. </s>
<s> And later on when I can work in a AM3 mobo and memory it is ready to go for that as well. </s>
<s> no, I'm talking about an X3 the one less core is offset by more cache, 45nm, and more headroom for overclocking Phenom II X3 720 Back Edition, $145 on Newegg right now, lots of combo deals </s>
<s> This is because there are only 4 GB of address space available using 32-bit addresses. </s>
<s> To give a simple analogy using base 10 Math, consider trying to put more than 100 addresses into strictly 2 digit form using only 0-9 for each value. </s>
<s> There are 100 possibilities, from 00 to 99 to be specific. </s>
<s> That last 1 GB of memory that you say is &quot;virtual&quot; is actually the memory reserved for various bits of hardware like sound, video, network and other parts. </s>
<s> &quot;Virtual memory&quot; is what an operating system takes off of the hard drive on a computer to use as extra memory space. </s>
