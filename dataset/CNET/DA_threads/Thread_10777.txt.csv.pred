1.1.1	NTFS - FAT32 - partition/format I recently installed a 2nd HD ( 80 gig - non formatted/non partitioned - as of yet ) ... my original system is running XP on a 40 gig FAT32 ... 1 .	St
1.1.2	Is it in my best interest to convert the FAT32 to NTFS ... and format/partition the new 80 gig to NTFS or run the 40 as is and run the 80 as NTFS ?	Ques
1.1.3	2 .	St
1.1.4	When/if I convert the FAT32 to NTFS , should I just use the XP convert ''tool '' since I have the OS/programs/files on the drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	Or should I backup the drive and format ?	Ques
1.1.6	Benefits/Drawbacks ?	Ques
1.1.7	3 .	St
1.1.8	I am in search of a way ( if possible ) to backup my operating system and programs so I do not have to reinstall everything from scatch ... ( if not the best idea ... suggestions ? )	Ques
1.1.9	Background Information : System will eventually have an external HD to use as a backup of drive # 2 , while drive # 1 strictly runs OS and Program files .	St
1.2.1	That may firm up your decision .	St
1.2.2	Boot disk NTFS , other FAT32 is fine .	St
1.2.3	Revwerse is not too good .	St
1.3.1	You 've got the wrong idea here ... One harddrive does not read another .	St
1.3.2	It 's the OS .	St
1.3.3	Older OS , such as Windows 95 , can not read NTFS because it does not support the newer file system .	St
1.3.4	If you have Windows NT , 2000 , XP or above , it does n't matter what kind of mix of file systems you have .	St
1.3.5	You can partition one harddrive into two drives , one running on FAT and the other on NTFS , and it will work fine .	St
1.4.1	With the lower price of HD these days why would you want to create more work out of something ?	Ques
1.4.2	Spend the & quot ; few & quot ; extra bucks and go get a large capacity HD .	St
1.4.3	You did n't say if you were planning on running a RAID setup .	St
1.4.4	But if you 're a gamer RAID is NOT the way to go .	St
1.4.5	In fact a RAID setup is actually slower for gaming then a single HD .	St
1.4.6	Save yourself the headaches and get a larger HD	St
1.5.1	that by boot disk I meant the operating system ? ? ?	Ques
1.5.2	? Is your sole reason for posting to try to tell someone that they are wrong ? ? ?	Ques
1.5.3	What I said in my post was valid .	St
1.5.4	If he makes the operating system FAT 32 he wo n't be able to read the files data et al that would be on the NTFS drive .	St
1.6.1	He did say he uses Windows XP , you know , it 's on the first post ...	St
1.7.1	So what 's your point ? ?	Ques
1.7.2	?	Ques
1.8.1	& quot ; If he makes the operating system FAT 32 he wo n't be able to read the files data et al that would be on the NTFS drive. & quot ;	St
1.9.1	It says if he has XP running FAT32 on the boot drive and the other drive or partition is in NTFS , he ca n't read them from the boot operating system .	St
1.9.2	Exactly the same as if the second drive was formatted using an overlay program .	St
1.9.3	We sure live in different worlds .	St
1.10.1	Haha !	St
1.10.2	Where did you get all your ideas ! ?	Ques
1.10.3	You 've got to be kidding me !	St
1.10.4	It does n't matter which drive is the boot drive .	St
1.10.5	Windows XP , the software itself , supports both formats and can read from both formats .	St
1.10.6	Poohoo ... ^_____^	St
1.11.1	Well , teh HD 's have already been purchased ... not really intended for gaming purposes .	St
1.11.2	Thanks .	Polite
