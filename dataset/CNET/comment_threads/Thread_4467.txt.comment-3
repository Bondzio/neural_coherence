I've read the vista threads and i've tried the treesize program and it only says that i am using 107 from 260 but when i check the properties it says i am using 251 out 260 just like before i rebooted my computer.
I was wondering if the files i previously had is somehow &quot;hidden&quot; but still on my hard drive.
And can someone confirm that all the files erase when one system restores the computer, I was wondering because all the files in the program files remained but the file i left in the desktop, which was almost everything, didn't
