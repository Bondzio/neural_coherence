<s> ok you tech'y people, here's a question for you. </s>
<s> I have win 98se running well on a socket370 gigabyte 6oxet motherboard. </s>
<s> (dual bios) now, i've tried first to upgrade and clean install legal copies of win 2000pro and then winxp pro. </s>
<s> but pc does not want to do this. </s>
<s> so did some digging. </s>
<s> updated intel chip on mtherboard, no problem went to update bios chip, found a problem, at the moment when i boot i get bios version f7 then i can flash main bios to version f10. </s>
<s> flash seems to work until i reboot and bios goes back to version f7, i've tried to flash main bios and backup bios but same happens,the bios goes back to version f7. </s>
<s> totally confused and frustrated at this time. </s>
<s> any help would be much appreciated many thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Not sure if your still haveing a problem but. </s>
<s> I went to the GIGABYTE Website and notice that they have 2 BIOS upgrades for the motherboard that im seeing. </s>
<s> About updating BIOS... </s>
<s> The whole BIOS updating procedure should be treated with extreme caution. </s>
<s> If you do not encounter any system instability or bugs with the current BIOS version, we suggest that you keep it. </s>
<s> If you determine to flash BIOS, you are taking a personal risk of BIOS flash failure. </s>
<s> Please contact your supplier or our distributors/resellers for further remedy in case system crashes unfortunately because of BIOS flash failure. </s>
<s> Before you begin... 1. </s>
<s> Please make sure the BIOS version you want to flash matches your motherboard model. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If your BIOS is flash protected, please do not enable BIOS Flash Protection under Advanced CMOS Setup (AMI BIOS) or Advanced BIOS Features (AWARD BIOS) in BIOS menu. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Never interrupt when you BIOS is being updated. </s>
<s> GA-6OXET Intel 815EP chipset F11c(Beta) 2002/5/15 Update Micro code http://biosupgrade.notlong.com/ *DOWNLOAD* F10 2002/1/23 Support I/O chip : ITE8712 G version Fixed FAN control in suspend item function not work http://biosgigaf10.notlong.com/ *DOWNLOAD* *Please remember to &quot;Load Optimize Defaults&quot; (in the BIOS Setup) after updating new BIOS And im not sure if this is the case, But i went to the Intel Website because the motherboard has the Intel 815EP AGPset Right? </s>
<s> I seen that it said for that you used the Intel Chipset Software Installation Utility http://IntelChipSet.notlong.com </s>
<s> &quot;Fixed FAN control in suspend item function not work&quot; This is typical Pidgen English from Gigabyte. </s>
<s> They make great mobos, but have no one that can write a clear English sentence. </s>
<s> I had the Dual Bios in a later version mobo and never could figure from the wording in the manual . </s>
<s> The following, again from Dragons good input, is an example of a Gigabyte statement that seemd to make no sense. </s>
<s> &quot;2. </s>
<s> If your BIOS is flash protected, please do not enable BIOS Flash Protection under Advanced CMOS Setup (AMI BIOS) or Advanced BIOS Features (AWARD BIOS) in BIOS menu&quot; Somehow how I think that the flash protection is preventing you from flashing the BIOS. </s>
<s> Email Gigabyte and instead of clarifying the answer, they will simply send reference the exact same statement back to you. </s>
<s> Decided to use ABIT mobos, simply because their manuals and website stuff is written such that one can understand them. </s>
<s> Maybe it's time to get a new board? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help but have downloaded all bios updates and intel chip updates. </s>
<s> Installed intel updates fine, but would not update bios. </s>
<s> Even used gigabytes own bios flash program. </s>
<s> It flashes the bios to the version I want, but then after I load optized defaults and reboots the bios goes back to f7. </s>
<s> Will have to stay with 98se for now. </s>
<s> Thanks for the math lesson Mr.Moderator, Seriously though I've got a couple other computers with the kids and all, but made this one a while ago. </s>
<s> Just wanted to update and upgrade everything, but seems I can't at the moment. </s>
<s> thanks again </s>
<s> I was born in somerset, England </s>
<s> found the problem,one word 'JUMPERS' The jumper for the flash protection wasn't on default. </s>
<s> Didn't even think of the jumpers. </s>
<s> anyway thanks for all your help somerset </s>

<s> If your new OS doesn't run properly, why not go back to what worked? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That wouldn't be Burnham-on-sea would it? </s>
<s> Most definately Bob I will go back to 98se only like I said before I was trying to upgrade everything.But anyways thanks again for your help. </s>
