I do not know the difference between crossover, and patch and all that. Could someone explain this to me please. I want to connect my computer or 360 to a router. I also might use this to connect my modem to my router, and so on. Will I be able to use a crossover cable in everyday networking?

A standard/patch cable is for connecting non-like devices such as a computer to a router, modem to router, or computer to modem. &quot;Will I be able to use a crossover cable in everyday networking?&quot; Nope.

Also if anyone knows any way to connect like computer/360/PS2 to hub/router using crossover cable please comment. PLEASE I am desperate!!!
