May I ask if anyone has specific recommendations about monitors in terms of color rendition and definition?
I can walk into a store and visually compare say flat screen TVs of various technologies, sizes and specs, but I cannot do the same with monitors since most are sold only by mail order, such as Dell.
That's why I am asking if anyone has experience based recommendations...
Thanks.
