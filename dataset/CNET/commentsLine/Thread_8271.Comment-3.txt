to be a little more detailed on your troubleshooting you should also try the video card in a different system if you have another that is compatible with the card.
also, if you have on-board video, try using it.
make sure on-board video is enabled in cmos/bios setup if you have that option.
if you dont get any video with the on-board setup, then there is just a conflict with the hard drive jumper settings.
bios is registering both of the drives as your main(primary) drive which is a critical conflict when it comes to booting your system.
it basically means that although your fans, led lights, and possibly on-board sound, will work, none of your other hardware will work because the conflict is preventing windows from loading and, therefore, preventing the drivers for your hardware from loading.
