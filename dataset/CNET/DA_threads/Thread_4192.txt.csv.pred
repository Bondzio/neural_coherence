1.1.1	iMac G4 Flat-Panel , OS 10.4.11 : My iMac keeps recognizing one EXT FW HD but not my IOMEGA EXT FW HD .	St
1.1.2	Both are journaled .	St
1.1.3	Startup Disk selection in Prefs does not recognize the Iomage HD , yet I see it on my desktop .	St
1.1.4	Whazzup ?	Ques
1.1.5	How to keep the Imega HD as my startup disk ?	Ques
1.2.1	why do you need it as the startup drive ?	Ques
1.2.2	Along with the Mac OS X ( Journaled ) , make sure that the thing is set to GUID partion table .	St
1.2.3	If it is not , it will not be recognized as a legitimate startup disk P	St
1.3.1	TechTool Pro tells me the INT HD ( only 80 ) is failing ; the IO HD is 250 , only 8 mos old .	St
1.3.2	So I figured the IO HD could hold every thing with room to spare .	St
1.3.3	Where do I go to set to GUID partition table ?	Ques
1.3.4	How to do ?	Ques
1.4.1	and erase that Iomega drive .	St
1.4.2	Then partition it into ONE partion .	St
1.4.3	Click the Customize button and choose Apple as the partition type .	St
1.4.4	Proceed from there .	St
1.4.5	P	St
1.5.1	Solved my problem : PPC Macs will not boot from USB EXT HD , only FW .	St
1.5.2	I goofed on titling this thread : my Iomega HD is EXT USB !	St
1.5.3	Anyone selling an EXT FW HD for a G4 ?	Ques
1.6.1	Should be hundreds of choices today .	St
1.6.2	But if I had that Iomega I might pull the hard drive out of it and see if it fits in some enclosure like http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817146604	Ques
1.7.1	platform specific .	St
1.7.2	A FW HD will work on a PC or a Mac , as will a USB drive or a SATA drive P	St
1.8.1	USB 2.0 has max transfer rate of 480 Mbits/s ; IEEE 1394b-2002 has 786.4 Mbits/s .	St
1.8.2	Would n't Iomega or WD use slower drives for USB 2.0 external drives than they do for Firewire 800 external drives , to minimize costs .	St
1.8.3	What would happen if I put a slower SATA drive inside the Firewire 800 external drive enclosure .	St
1.8.4	Does it still work except for slower transfer ; or my Mac wo n't mount the drive on its Firewire 800 port ?	Ques
1.8.5	I 'm interested because I 'm looking for a fast Firewire 800 external drive to make periodic bootable backups of the boot-disk on my MacBook Pro .	St
1.8.6	I think I need about 500GB to keep the most recent 2-3 bootable backups of my 200GB boot drive on my Mac to recover from disk crash or system hang .	St
1.8.7	I already use an IOmega eGo 1TB Mac Edition for Time Machine backups .	St
1.8.8	Is it wise to assemble my own Firewire 800 external storage or buy one off the shelf ?	Ques
1.8.9	My problem is mfgr 's like IOmega and WD do n't give you enough details of the hard disk inside the box to compare .	St
1.8.10	I 'm a computer hardware professional in a past life but is not sure how to make sense of the info published by hard drive manufacturers .	St
1.8.11	Any recommendations for a refresher or tutorial .	St
1.9.1	I find many to get uppity as they begin the learning process that transfer rate over the wire is not any indication of the overall speed of the transfer .	St
1.9.2	Yes , 800 should result in lower times but in my experience it never cut a 10 second transfer down to 5 seconds .	St
1.9.3	As to the slower SATA drive that 's easy .	St
1.9.4	Even SATA 1.5GbS is faster than 800 so you should not see any measurable change from SATA 3GbS to that .	St
1.9.5	Yes the drive seek time changes have more of an impact but you knew that .	St
1.9.6	As to the tutorial I suggest you keep reading and reading and after a few months it will start to make sense .	St
1.9.7	I like our classes when we read about Amdahl 's laws and think it applies here .	St
1.9.8	This and thinking about this like the slowest link in the chain sets the speed .	St
1.9.9	However the read and write speeds of drives are far lower than the transfer rate of the interfaces .	St
1.9.10	Bob	St
1.10.1	Yes , you 're right .	St
1.10.2	Thanks for pointing out that these external storage all use SATA drives .	St
1.10.3	Unless I have an eSATA port on my Mac , I 'm getting way too cerebral here and would be wasting my money on the faster drives !	St
