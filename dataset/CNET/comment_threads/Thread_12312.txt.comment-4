Easiest way is to open your PC case.
If the cable connecting your hard drive is about 1cm wide its SATA 150 or SATA 300.
SATA 300 is faster and only $2-3 more so buy that.
If its much wider about 5cm then its IDE.
Buy the fastest IDE drive you can 100-150mbs.
Never succomb to these PC company giants.
They want your money that's all.
I have always built my own machines so if I need technical support...I know where I am 24/7.
