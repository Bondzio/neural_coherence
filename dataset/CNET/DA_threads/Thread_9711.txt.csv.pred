1.1.1	I think I know what I did wrong now that caused me to lose pictures , files , music during a backup this weekend but my question is - is there a way to & quot ; restore & quot ; or & quot ; go back & quot ; to a previous day ( like 3 days ) so that my E drive is the way it was before I did the backup ?	Ques
1.1.2	I know some OS systems allow you to & quot ; go back & quot ; or restore - but I do n't know if my Western Digital hard drive Retrospect program has the option to undo my last backup ? ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks .	Polite
