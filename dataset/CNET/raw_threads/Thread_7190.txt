The only reason we're upgrading is because she wants high-speed internet and her current machine doesn't support it. She basically does email, AOL, web surfing, word processing, printing, copying and faxing. She may get into some low-in web development but nothing much. I've found two HPs both on sale at Best Buy. I can get one with all-in-one printer, Pavillion a804n (Celeron 335), and 17 in flat CRT for about $616, after rebates, including taxes. The Pavilion a1000n (Celeron 340) with basically the same features goes for about $675, after rebates, including taxes. She'll end up with two printers either way, the one that comes with the bundle which we'll probably trash and the all-in-one she really wants (HP Office Jet 5510). My question: is it worth paying the $60 extra to get the Celeron 340? My brother hates emachines (awful experience) and since he's splitting the cost with me, hp is the way we're going to go. Thanks for you help. Angie

Get the emachines t6212, when it's on sale, its a lot cheaper and emachines has changed for the better recently. I had problems and called them and their customer support was great. They sent me a brand new dl dvd+_rw drive to replace the broken one. Get the emachines,they're not a bad company since acquistion by gateway. I own 2 recent Compaq machines and 1 emachine t5026 also recent. They're both good, but for the value, i would go for the emachine... You won't find many complaints of the t6212 by people here on cnet. As for the question, the 335 and 340, it's just the clockspeed. It's not worth 60 to just get a higher clock speed. Celerons are really bad processors. The emachines comes with an AMD 64, with 64-bit support for the future and a pci-express (x16) slot for graphics upgrades. ROger

She ended up satisfied so my brother decided to go emachines. A nightmare. He finally returned the machine and got his money back, but American Express had to get involved. It was the worst customer service experience I'd ever heard of. Even though my mom has had no problems with her machine, my brother won't even consider another emachine. I liked them but I also want him to pay half the cost so I'm giving in. Oh, yes, it's HP a804n-b or a804x-b. I don'tlike what I've been hearing about HP but I figure if it works out of the box, we're good to go. If it doesn't, we take it back to BestBuy for a refund. Thanks. Angie

They have risen from the bottom to one of the top dogs. I was hesitant at first but now I'm more than satisfied. I've had my T3256 for about 6 months now. There hasn't been any problems what-so-ever, not even one glich. It's performed like a champ, has taken everything I've thrown at it. (wow we're such nerds) Just search emachines in these forums and you'll find maybe 1 negative thing. Search Dell and you get Dell sucks!! blah blah. Not that I dislike Dell, just Emachines has a much better rep. My next OEM computer purchase will probably be an Emachines again. Cuz they're just that good. Haha

It's more than four years old so it doesn't have a DVD or a CDRW. I just think it's time for a newer model. We've offered the present machine to a cousin who doesn't have a computer and she doesn't want it. Too old, she said. Go figure. FYI: I went to Best Buy last year to buy a computer for my mom and had an emachine in my shopping cart. The clerk advised me not to buy it; said a lot of people had been bringing them back. Honestly, I had it in my shopping cart and he talked me out of it. I couldn't believe it. I left with a monitor. Yes, her monitor went out last year. Like I said, after the false starts, my mom didn't have any trouble with her emachine. Let's hope the HP holds out as long. If it doesn't, my brother will get it in both ears. Angie

Our repair shop atleast in my store see's more HP's and Dells in for repair, and we dont even sell Dell lol.
