<s> I have a new PC, with adequate DRAM and a great chip to run VISTA Ultimate, and a laptop, running VISTA Home Premium. </s>
<s> Since I have used WIRED networks before with DSL service, I am guessing using a Cable modem won't cause any problems. </s>
<s> First, since I have to push the 60 feet of CAT5e wire through existing 2X6 walls, and con't know exactly where the 110V wires are located, is it essential to use a wire locator to keep the CAT5e wire far enough away from the electrical circuit so as not to compromise the signal so it drops? </s>
<s> Second, I have purchased a LINKSYS BEFSR41 Cable/DSL Router with a 4-port switch for my network, because I used the same router 8 years ago for my DSL modem and had no problems with speed or setup. </s>
<s> Is there a better wired router I should consider befoe I unwrap my BEFSR41? </s>
<s> Third, once I have the laptop connected to the router, should I buy a printer hub to connect my HP LaserJet 1300 and my OfficeJet 6210 to the router, or should I connect both printers to my PC and use printer and file sharing to enable my laptop to connect to both printers? </s>
<s> Fourth, I have a Termaltake housing for a 500mb Western Digital external hardrive that has both a ESATA and a USB2.0 port. </s>
<s> I also have a LINKSYS Network Storage Link with two USB2.0 ports and an RJ45 ethernet port. </s>
<s> Should I connect the external hard drive directly to the PC, using the ESATA port, and then access the external hard drive using printer/files sharing with my laptop? </s>
<s> Or, should I connect my LINKSYS Network Storage Link to one of the ports of the BEFSR41, and keep my external hard drive connected to the network storage link so I can backup my files and folders on the external hard drive? </s>
<s> Thanks for reading this long message, and for any advice you can send my way. </s>

<s> The TWISTED PAIRS are there to negate such pickups. </s>
<s> I'll decline explaining why this is so. </s>

<s> Absolutely your choice. </s>

<s> I like the direct USB connection since NAS speed is abotu 1/5 that of a direct USB connection. </s>
<s> That's sluggish. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob for taking the time to read and respond to each of my questions. </s>
<s> You say that the BEFSR41 us a dated product. </s>
<s> Do you know of a better router for wired networks? </s>
<s> I don't need to keep the LinkSys wired router. </s>
<s> It sounds like keeping the LinkSys Network Storage Link and using the USB2.0 link to the router is your favored choice. </s>
<s> It is easy to do, and only saves a few bucks to keep the network storage link. </s>
<s> I am also grateful to better understand the way twisted pairs work in the CAT5e wires, as I don't really know where the 110V circuit is located in the wall, and now I can get the job done without worrying about where it is. </s>
<s> Last question: I once was told that sharp bends in CAT5e wires compromise the speed of the signal. </s>
<s> Is this bolderdash or true? </s>
<s> Many thanks, Bob </s>
<s> It's a physics, electronics effect. </s>
<s> Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Pair Hopefully this will suffice for the explanation. </s>
<s> The sharp bends would have to be quite severe to create an issue. </s>
<s> You won't see this issue if you let the wire &quot;flow&quot; and don't stress it over an 90 degree edge. </s>
<s> As to a better router, I found the BEFSR41 to not handle PC to PC traffic all that well. </s>
<s> If I connected my BEFSR41 to a switched hub the network performed better. </s>
<s> This has turned out to be true with most routers of that day. </s>
<s> Today's units are usually better. </s>
<s> Try to use what gear you have. </s>
<s> You seem to be very close to a working system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the link to Wikipedia for the explanation of twisted pair technology. </s>
<s> I have an unopened box for a D-Link DIR-655 WIRELESS Router that I was going to return for credit. </s>
<s> Would it make any sense to use this router for a WIRED network, since it probably has more updated technology, unlike the LinkSye BEFSR41 that is from the dark ages? </s>
<s> If I connect a switched hub to my BEFSR41 wired router, why will the PC to PC traffic move faster? </s>
<s> Forgive me for asking these educational questions, because it takes far too much of your time to answer them and direct me to helpful sites, but maybe someday I can help someone else with the same problem. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice and help, Thomboy </s>
<s> &quot;If I connect a switched hub to my BEFSR41 wired router, why will the PC to PC traffic move faster?&quot; Because the switched hub in the BEFSR41 doesn't keep up with 100Mb transfers. </s>
<s> Even the cheapest switches hubs helped curb the time when I copy a file between machines. </s>
<s> Since routers were pricey back then I would connect up the modem -&gt; router -&gt; switched hub -&gt; PCs to get the best overall network speed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Many thanks again, Bob, for the clarification about the switched hub. </s>
<s> I should be able to find an inexpensive one, and complete the network without problems, due to your help. </s>
<s> QUESTION: Is there any reason to use the D-Link DIR-655 Wireless router in place of the BEFSR41 for my wired network? </s>
<s> I have been told over and over that using a wireless router for a wired network is OK, but wireless is more expensive. </s>
<s> COMMENT: The D-Link DIR-655 cost me $129 while the BEFSR41 cost $$65. </s>
<s> A cheap switched hub can't cost more than $30 or $95 versus $129. </s>
<s> If the D-Link is better, I don't mind spending $34 more for better long-term use. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the reply, Thomboy </s>
<s> I'm a little taken aback with the prices you listed. </s>
<s> My recent upgrade was a Netgear WPNT-834 for 69 bucks refurb from geeks.com. </s>
<s> I found a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 for 49 bucks on sale at Best Buy which is doing a stint running a Linux based router firmware since I wanted to do that for some time. </s>
<s> The gigabit wifi router is a nice touch since I doubt you'll replace that any day soon. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob: I bought the gigabit D-Link DIR-655 from Costco, but saw them advertised at cNet from other places for over $170. </s>
<s> I bought the BDFSR41 from Best Buy as it was the only wired router they had in stock. </s>
<s> Maybe the Buffalo you bought would work for me? </s>
<s> Since I don't need the wi-fi function of the DIR-655 now, maybe using it is overkill?? </s>
<s> The think all the n, and pre-n routers are pricey with lots of problems--setup, and even firmware downloads. </s>
<s> Even D-Link's technical support is lacking if trouble comes along with sub-net mask, DHCP or IP addresses. </s>
