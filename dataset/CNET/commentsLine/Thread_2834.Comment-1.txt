i need to upgrade my motherboard, cpu, and ram, there are so many to choose from i feel lost.
my current system (for gaming only) windows 7 pro 64-bit unknown motherboard (2 pci-e slots, 2 ddr2 slots, am3 socket, built in sound, 4 usb 2.0 slots) amd phenom ii quad core 2.4 ghz sapphire radeon hd 6870 1gb 4 gb ddr2 ram corsair 750w psu cd/dvd drive 500 gb hard drive i am going to buy a new case, thinking about a full tower, and i want a new motherboard, cpu and ram, keeping my graphics, psu, hd, and dvd drive my budget is $250-$300 for the motherboard and cpu, i have no preference between intel or amd i dont know much about cpus as far as which is best, how many cores is optimal etc.
thanks
