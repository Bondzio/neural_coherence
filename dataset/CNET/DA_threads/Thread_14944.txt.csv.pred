1.1.1	I just bought a Sony RA820 with 200G hard disk , however I found there is only one local drive ( C ) , I tried to create another local drive for data and media storage just in case my operating system fails and I should lose everything .	St
1.1.2	I checked the support and help areas for creating partition , but both methods in window interface and DOS interface are not working after I followed the instruction .	St
1.1.3	Where can I get references for this task ?	Ques
1.2.1	What 's the size of this 'C ' drive ?	Ques
1.2.2	If it 's almost 200GB , then there is no place to make any additional partitions .	St
1.2.3	Use a Partition Resizer to reduce the size of this 'C ' and then you can make additional partitions in the freed space .	St
1.2.4	Much more info has been posted in many other postings in this site ! !	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps .	St
1.3.1	Thank you for replying the post .	St
1.3.2	The C drive is 183G in total , while there is another 6G reserved for recovery task .	St
1.3.3	My major concern is that once if I try to make new partition , I might accidentally format the entire C drive and lose everything , including the operating system .	St
