assuming a broadband internet connection is available, a cheaper alternative would be a usb web cam attached to the laptop.
a mid-range logitech or creative cam would give you 320x240 res at 15fps.
you can use the software provided to setup a video chat or use msn messenger or other im clients.
by going with the usb attached web cam, you only have to worry about getting one wireless connection working and you can easily test the chat before hand without having to fiddle with ip addresses.
