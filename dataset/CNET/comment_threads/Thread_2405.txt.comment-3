I'm doing some consulting for such a product.
The ones I deal with are linux based and only a few USB mice are supported.
THESE ARE MADE FOR PRICE and to get your price points you can't support many mice.
It's also not a PC so anyone that calls it stone age may be out of touch with this market.
Ok, there is one idea here.
Did you try a wireless remote mouse like http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-USB-Remote-Control-Mouse/dp/B001M56DI0 Given the nature of these systems that's what I would try.
