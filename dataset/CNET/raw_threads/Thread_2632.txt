On my Virtualbox i am running windows 7. My job has two different networks. I need my Mac on Network 1 and I need to have my windows 7 in Virtualbox on network 2. If i install a USB Ethernet port on the iMac and plug network 2 into it, how can i make it work just for Virtualbox? I then want to make the built in Ethernet port work on network one and be just for the iMac? Can it be done or am i just crazy? Thank you

While I did write router code back in the early 1990s it appears you are trying something for reasons I can only guess at. At the office I have something like this but I use 3 laptops to do the work.

I need to be connected to the instructional network sot fix computers, monitor student usage and all around support. I also need to be on the administration network for the same reasons. I currently have two computers to do this. I would like to have one computer and put my other one out for student use. I want my Mac on the instructional and my virtual windows on the administration. One cannot be connected to the other.

Given how perilous setting up a single laptop would be and that it would be an emulation of the real thing we don't do what you propose. But if I was to do this I would be looking at route tables, masks and such. And there's the rub. Most folk can't alter a route table. I know it took me years to learn this. I mean I could issue the command but until I was on that router software dev team I didn't understand it because I didn't have to. Fast forward to your setup. It may take time for you to pound out what your Apple's route table looks like for this one. Bob
