I need to hook my digital camera up; is there a device out there that I can plug into my serial port that will allow me to use the usb plug on my camera? Thanks! MAX

You can google away and try to find such an adapted, but you're better served is you have PCMICA type ports to install USB ports that way. Make sure your orginal USB are done-in, they may not as the &quot;driver&quot; may need to be re-installed. Check this website for USB insight: http://www.usbman.com tada -----Willy
