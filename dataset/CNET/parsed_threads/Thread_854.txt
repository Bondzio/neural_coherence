<s> Hi I use win 7 OS and it is 1 yr old Dell Optiplex 780 desktop. </s>
<s> I had no issue when it was new to put the machine in hybernation, now it does not go into the hybernation mode! </s>
<s> Also it does not recognize the external HD ... </s>
<s> I cant backup my data files No problem with the USB it recognizes it so no problem with the USB port. </s>
<s> If some one has any suggestion what is causing this issue Thank you Pat </s>
<s> the machine recognizes the HD Control Panel under the Search devices .. but when I go the computer to look for the device it is not there. </s>
<s> Unable to back up my files. </s>
<s> In the task bar it has the icon to safely remove the hardware. </s>
<s> I use that before removing the HD. </s>
<s> I also checked the drivers and the it indicates that drivers are up to date. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>

<s> You could try doing a restoration to an earlier time to see if something might have changed within the system, doing this will not delete or remove anything, it is not the same as a full restore/recovery. </s>
<s> Unless you have tried this already, I'd give it a shot. </s>
<s> Thank you issue. </s>
<s> I will try that and see what happens. </s>
<s> Ofcourse over the months I have added some software like CCleaner, Spyaweeper, Defrag and Advancedcare. </s>
<s> I am aware that sometimes some software cause issues .. but not recognize the HD was a new one for me. </s>
<s> As I indicated earlier external USB are recognized. </s>
<s> I connect this HD to an older computer running Window XP and it recognizes the HD. </s>
<s> So it seems that some setting in this new Dell machine does not allow the HD recognition. </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your suggestion. </s>

<s> I also wanted to provide this info: On Devices and printers I see the external HD. </s>
<s> I check the properties of this HD and check the device status and it says that device is working properly. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I can check to see what is causing this external HD not to be recognized. </s>
<s> Thank you Pat </s>
