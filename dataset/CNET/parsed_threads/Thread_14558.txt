<s> Hello, I've read some tips in other threads, but I didn't see anything that specifically addressed or clearly addressed(I'm an intermediate computer person...) the following issue. </s>
<s> I have two hard drives, both SATA. </s>
<s> They both run at 7,200 RPM and are installed in the only two hard drive bays in the case. </s>
<s> Since these are the only two spaces, they are one right on top of the other with a very small amount of space between. </s>
<s> I just had a hard drive go bad and now that I'm seeing the temperatures for the new one and the working old one(idling at 47 and 52 degrees celcius respectively), I think heat was a probably villain in the last one's demise. </s>
<s> There's a large side fan over the cpu and the fan with the power supply. </s>
<s> There are no additional built in spots for more fans. </s>
<s> So I'm struggling to find a way to cool them without disrupting the intended airflow. </s>
<s> I had read somewhere that a guy rigged a fan using some foam tape so that it was pointed at the hard drives and blowing towards the front of the case. </s>
<s> Is that safe/does that work? </s>
<s> Aside from that, I really don't know what other options I have. </s>
<s> A liquid cooling system is simply out of the question budget-wise. </s>
<s> Any thoughts and/or suggestions? </s>
<s> Take Care, Chris </s>
<s> I had not given it much thought before but since you brought it up. </s>
<s> A quick look at my hd temp shows 33/36c...that's after multi hours of on/use time. </s>
<s> What happens if you remove the side panel? </s>
<s> Do you per chance have one of those micro/mini/slimline cases? </s>
<s> 47c and 52c are pretty hot. </s>
<s> Best to check the mfgs site for thermal limits. </s>
<s> I have two internal HDDs and HDTune reports their temps at 24c (120GB) and 25c (200GB). </s>
<s> They're installed in a full tower ANTEC SX1200 case in a removable drive bay that can hold up to 3 drives. </s>
<s> The removable drive bay has a fan in the front that pulls air in and pushes over the HDDs and toward the back of the PC. </s>
<s> Bottomline if your HDDs are mounted so as to be right on top of each other...it would help to separate them to the maximum practical extent possible. </s>
<s> You could consider mounting one or both into a 5.25&quot; mounting kits and moving them into 5.25&quot; drive bays ...thats a real benefit of having extra 5.25 drive bays. </s>
<s> There are lots of options ...it would help to see a PIC if possible to see how your drives are mounted. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> From what I read, it seems everyone was agreeing that removing the side panel was only effective if you then had a desktop fan flowing over the computer. </s>
<s> Even then, it was mentioned that doing so is really bad for your computer due to the incredible amounts of dust that will build up inside on every computer component. </s>
<s> It's not a slimline/micro/mini case. </s>
<s> It's a medium size tower from Medion(German Company). </s>
<s> It only came with one hard drive, I added the second. </s>
<s> It also has a floppy drive, a full flash dashboard(any type can be loaded), a cd-rom, and a dvd-rw drive. </s>
<s> That means that while there's some space below the hard drives, there aren't any left over bays to use. </s>
<s> Western Digital was saying that 55 degrees celcius should be the maximum temperature during full use. </s>
<s> So it's definitely an issue that I'm idling so hot. </s>
<s> I don't really use the cd-rom drive much, it's probably worth ditching that to mount one of the hard drives there? </s>
<s> I'd do that, but I'm not sure if that will bring the temperature down enough as there still isn't much airflow over them. </s>
<s> I think they built this with the capability of two drives but only enough space to keep one cool. </s>
<s> I'll work on a pic. </s>
<s> Is there a way to post them? </s>
<s> there's no room. </s>
<s> A solution might be to take one HDD. </s>
<s> out and put it in an external case. </s>
<s> Here's an inexpensive HDD cooler ... just need about 3/4&quot; free space below the HDD to mount it http://thermaltakeusa.com/product/dcfan/slot/a2376/a2376.asp For posting PICs...lots of folks use Imageshack.com http://reg.imageshack.us/content.php?page=faq How many 5.25&quot; drive bays do you have ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Was just a test. </s>
<s> If the test shows the hd's have cooled then you have an air flow issue. </s>
<s> Just an aside. </s>
<s> The psu ..mounted at the top.. that came with this case blew it's hot exhaust air 'into' the machine. </s>
<s> I never understood that. </s>
<s> Anyway...I spent a few bucks and bought a psu that moved the air in the proper direction.....seemed to cool the innards much better. </s>
<s> As for dust. </s>
<s> I've run this machine with and without a side cover. </s>
<s> Can't say I've seen a diff in dust build up. </s>
<s> Both methods still require a regular dust bunny clean out. </s>
<s> Alrighty. </s>
<s> I got an inexpensive hard drive cooler similar to the one VAPCMD linked to. </s>
<s> The only difference is this one was on clearance at Circuit City. </s>
<s> There wasn't any space to mount it to the hotter of the two drives, at least not below it. </s>
<s> So I ended up moving the main drive to the bottom and the new drive to the top where I installed it upside down. </s>
<s> Then I took out the floppy drive above it. </s>
<s> After custom drilling a couple of holes for the upside down drive, I taped(yes, tapes) the hard drive fan above it in place of the floppy drive since there was no way to screw it in anywhere. </s>
<s> Currently, I'm back up and running with idle temps at 28 and 31 degrees celcius. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if I'm leveled out here or if the computer is still getting warmed up. </s>
<s> If I'm leveled out, then this fan and new positioning did the trick as it's about 15-20 degrees cooler than before. </s>
<s> My only question now is the hum I'm noticing. </s>
<s> It's basically a low hum and you can feel it pulsing if you rest your hand on the case. </s>
<s> It's very low, but I can't say that I've heard it on any other computer. </s>
<s> It started with the new drive being installed right-side up, so I'm not sure what it's from. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> you could move the hard drive to a 5.25&quot; drive bay and mount the drive cooler and drive as designed. </s>
<s> You could also mount a fan on the other HDD is desired. </s>
<s> http://www.xpcgear.com/harddrivemount.html </s>
<s> I think I might get into that once the semester ends, the whole reason this was an issue is because my computer is for heavy video editing. </s>
<s> So I needed a quick fix. </s>
<s> However, long term, that idea sounds much better. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
