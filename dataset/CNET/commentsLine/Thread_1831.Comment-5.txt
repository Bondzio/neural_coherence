after fixing too many multiple rail systems (re-jigger power connections) i am now a fan of the single rail psu when ever possible.
one less thing for the builder to get wrong.
and half the work in those jobs was to give a short course in power supplies.
i don't know which was harder, the machine repair or explaining why we didn't replace parts and why.
