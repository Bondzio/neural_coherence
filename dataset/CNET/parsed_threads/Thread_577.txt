<s> Did you check to see if any parts are available. </s>
<s> Compare similar types and see what new cost is, at least you got a chance at repair if LCD type as parts might be a part-in items, if you're capable. </s>
<s> Otherwise, just move on. </s>

<s> I just can't see him giving you TWO bad monitors. </s>
<s> Something isn't right but I can't put may finger on it. </s>
<s> If they are truly bad then I doubt it's worth repairing. </s>
