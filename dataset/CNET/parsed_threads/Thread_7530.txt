<s> I have two Maxtor Diamond plus 9 HD's 80gb and 160Gb. </s>
<s> I am changing my Amd XP CPU to Amd 64bit Venice core 3500 and Asus A78NX motherboard to DFI Lan Party SNli 4 -DR. What is the likelihood of my hard disks being accepted by the new system? </s>
<s> I've got Acronis True Image for backups in case.Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> A flat out swap won't work because too much was changed, so it won't get up and run(s/w wise) once you power-UP. </s>
<s> Of course back-up or safe guard whatever data you like. </s>
<s> The system will see the new HDs and all, but the XP OS just can't accept the change, you still need to install the new h/w, re-install mtrbd. </s>
<s> patches, drivers, then swap data to new system etc. </s>
<s> to proceed forward. </s>
<s> I find it best to have a newly reformatted blank &quot;C&quot; drive to get the XP OS on and proceed from there. </s>
<s> If the C drive was used only as the OS, no problem but usualy s/w wants it as defaulted HD. </s>
<s> Do you get the picture??? </s>
<s> You can try, but it'll probably sit at the boot-up screen for awhile(give it time) and see what it does, it may ask for whatever to proceed forward. </s>
<s> safeguard data before doing that... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the prompt reply, Willy. </s>
