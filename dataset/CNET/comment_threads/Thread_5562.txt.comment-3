a nas is basically an external hard drive that you connect to over a network.
since you want to go wireless, that will drive up the price a bit.
here's a linksys unit without hard drive for $120: http://www.buy.com/prod/linksys-nas200-network-storage-system-with-2-bays/q/loc/101/205689222.html here's a dlink version for $90: http://www.buy.com/prod/network-storage-adapter-usb-2-0-to-fast-ethernet/q/loc/101/10381289.html it needs an external usb drive so once you add the usb enclosure to the price it's not really cheaper than the linksys which has 2 internal bays.
where have you read bad reviews about western digital?
i recommend them almost exclusively.
but here's a 500gb hitachi for $99: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145137
