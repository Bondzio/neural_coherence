I added a new Maxtor Hardrive ATA 133 200 GB, I have a dvd & cd burner, 512 MB of DDR 400 Ram, a brand new 400 watt power supply, a pentium 4 processor and a brand new mother board... everything is new out of the box and nothing will turn on... I had an old power supply in and when I tried to turn it on for the 1st time it turned on and off because the power supply didn't have enough watts. So when I bought the new 400 watt one, I plugged everything in properly and I got nothing... Someone please help.. I did everything that needed to be done and I got nothing.... thanks... Sully

Take it down to a bare bones power-up - CPU, one stick of RAM, PSU and Vid card, unless you have onboard graphics. 3) If you still get nothing, can you test the PSU on another board?

I forgot to mention that I have a creative sound blaster pci 128 and a video card brand new. Can you somewhat break it down what I have to do?

The orginal psu as you mentioned in another post, allows a boot-up but shutsdown. That seems to offer that not only is that psu bad but probably caused the mtrbd. to fail as well. In other words, the new psu is doing its job but the mtrbd. isn't up to boot as the &quot;boot circuitry&quot; can't wake-up to latch onto power start, it failed. Unles, you got some special psu unit(some older one) then a generic psu replacement should have worked. That leaves either you got to a 2nd problem(mtrbd.) or a bad new psu. As the other poster mentioned, test on another system to see if the new psu is truly working. When a psu fails besides itself it can take other componets with it, so beware of that. You should try to make a simple system, remove all comonets and then boot-up with new psu. Minium system, is only 1 stick(bank) of ram, kybd., video and maybe FD. Add comonets untils it fails. It if ails on 1st try then bad psu or mtrbd. The mtrbd. componets like ram, cpu, video all installed cards. should be removed one at a time to see what if any changes take place. PSU = power supply unit tada -----Willy

Shoud I unplug cd drives, hard drive, FANS, LIGHTS ETC... and just test the mother board w the video card & RAM alone? The system only has 1 stick of ddr 400 pc 3200 ram. My motherboard holds up to 2 gb. I found that I do have a loose screw. Should I try afyer taking the screw out before testing it bare bone? (WHICH I STILL DON'T KNOW THAT MEANS... LOL)

If the system starts anything, it should at least beep away at you. That way, you know it wants to start. You can add the cpu and ram to the test rest of componets. There are no drives attached at all. If you get no response, you got a bad mtrbd. or either the cpu or ram is at fault. Something is holding you back. You can also remove the power AC plug, then attach when you need to power-UP. tada -----Willy
