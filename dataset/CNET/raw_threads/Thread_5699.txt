As a previously pc-only user, I have many bookmarks in IE, though I now use only Safari and Foxfire on the Mac. Is there any way to get my bookmarks (including my many folders) transferred to my Mac? (I am not actively networking the machines (though can if I need), but sharing peripherals, including an external hard drive). Thanks for any help.
