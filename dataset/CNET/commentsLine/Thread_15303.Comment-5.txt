you'll have to go into your bios and manually configure your memory settings to get top performance since you're mixing speeds (333vs400) and the spds settings won't match.
if you know your ddr333 will run at ddr400, then config your memory as ddr400; ... letting it config automatically will use the slowest most conversative settings.
