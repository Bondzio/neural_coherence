hi, i have an ageing system i built myself 3 years ago, it is a pc chips mobo (socket a) with an amd athlon 1200 chip.
i dont need one of these barton 64 jobbies, i simply want the cheapest possible processor upgrade to cope with the newer demands i`m placing on the system.
i have 2 800 gig hd`s, and 2 dvd burners.
512meg ddr ram gforce 64meg gfx card, and i use the onboard sound card.
running winxp home sp2 and i`m sharing a wireless network connection with a similar spec computer in my kitchen via a usr router/modem.
as i say, i`m not looking to launch the space shuttle with this system, i just want some advice on the processor upgrades available for my socket a board.
last time i did this, it was amd athlon or duron (xp processors?)
to choose from, now there is only something called a sempron?
what are these?
and how do they compare to the athlon series of the past?
is an amd sempron 2400 similar to the amd athlon xp2300 ive used on a friends pc?
many thanks for any advice you can offer.
