The Windows installation disk can handle all of that for you.
I don't see any reason to format a drive at any interval.
Of course you understand that doing so wipes the drive of your data.
Some folks take the notion that a re-installation of Windows is needed to maintain a PC's performance.
I would say that was probably true back when Windows 95 and 98 were around but not so true today.
Today, if you take care of your PC's cooling system, don't load up with background services, and stay away from malware, you can run for years without appreciable degradation in the area of performance.
That being said, this becomes your choice.
If you have the time and discipline to back up anything you don't want to lose, you can go the route of regular rebuilds as a preventive measure.
In my way of thinking, however, this takes away a PCs ability to simplify one's life.
