1.1.1	I just downloaded and used `speed fan ' because I was concerned with the heat rising from the top of my rig .	St
1.1.2	A blackbird 002 01b .	St
1.1.3	The CPU and other temps are at 41c .	St
1.1.4	The ram is at 75c .	St
1.1.5	The ram is not liquid cooled and I believe this could be a fatal flaw in the design .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas on this kind of thing ?	Ques
1.1.7	Seems like HP/VOODOO did not quite get their homework right .	St
1.1.8	I could put the dominator ram fans in there , but this should be hp`s responsability .	Sug
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The system monitoring s/w is only as accurate as the sensor is .	St
1.2.2	In most cases only those with sensors give a approx .	St
1.2.3	value .	St
1.2.4	Last , I recall no memory has sensors attached , so its getting that info 2nd hand .	St
1.2.5	Next , the system is running and that being the case , its doing it job .	St
1.2.6	If you want to cool it better then that 's your option to do so .	St
1.2.7	What you should do if it is n't already to route harnesses/wiring/cables to reduce airflow interference , thus be cooler .	Ques
1.2.8	As for HPVOODOO systems not doing their job , that 's debatable , but I 'm not here for that .	St
1.2.9	If it running OK , do n't fix it , IMHO , except of course add cooling if you want .	St
1.2.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	the RAM temp is accurate ... .infrared thermometer would be easiest .	St
1.3.2	If the temp as indicated is accurate ... then I 'd check the BIOS for speed and voltage settings .	St
1.3.3	Hoping that will solve the problem .	St
1.3.4	Let us know .	St
1.3.5	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I was a little hasty in my `prognosis ' .	St
1.4.2	However ; I have had nothing but problems with this `bird ' .	St
1.4.3	Over 4 mos .	St
1.4.4	in the shop .	St
1.4.5	Emails galore .	St
1.4.6	One tech says mobo , another say not .	St
1.4.7	I have switched the GPUs , ( at the prompt from the tech ) .	St
1.4.8	One of the fans , southbridge or north .	St
1.4.9	I`m not sure , keeps falling off .	St
1.4.10	I`m supposed to get a new one delivered but I still wait .	St
1.4.11	I`m going to get a digital pyrometer and check the temps again .	St
1.4.12	PS .	St
1.4.13	After shut down , the usb ports on the `bird ' are allways `live ' .	St
1.4.14	Is this normal ?	Ques
1.4.15	Every pc I own , have owned and including friends pcs .	St
1.4.16	None of them have power to the usb ports when the rig is off .	St
1.4.17	I got this rig last Nov .	St
1.4.18	This is not right .	Res
1.4.19	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	Gone to get a digital pyrometer as soon as I can .	St
1.5.2	I still dont think 79c is normal operating temp .	St
1.5.3	Trying to get answers reminds me of `Davinci code ' .	St
1.6.1	why it 's important to make sure the reading is accurate before going further .	St
1.6.2	Good luck getting the problems straightened out ... and keep us posted .	St
1.6.3	VAPCMD PS ... here 's a link to a good infrared thermometer that can be used to troubleshoot PC or non-PC heat related problems .	St
1.6.4	http : //www.amazon.com/Fluke-62-Mini-Infrared-Thermometer/dp/B000MX5Y9C	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the link .	St
1.7.2	I wish I still had my Fluke multimeter .	St
1.7.3	$ 900 went for a walk .	St
1.7.4	I`ll let you know .	St
1.8.1	Sorry for the delayed reply ... Well any fan that falls off is n't a good thing .	St
1.8.2	Plus , even before it falls , it maybe not 100 % seated or unsettling factor to keep it where it suppose to be .	St
1.8.3	These extreme machines just do n't like losing any cooling and the results will be as you find .	St
1.8.4	Certainly , that has to be corrected .	St
1.8.5	The plain fact is , if you can further cool the system , it will be a plus for you .	St
1.8.6	Add extra fans or switch over to water cooling , etc.. USB ports should n't be active in that actually still do something in any big way .	St
1.8.7	BUT , they are still powered , the LEDs you see lit probably are just a minor side effect of keeping the system & quot ; at the ready & quot ; maybe from a wake-up/hibernate & quot ; state or awaiting a hot key from the kybd. , that 's a power setting issue ( or bios ) , you may want to review that .	St
1.8.8	However , its not going to hurt the system and in some cases you may do more harm delving into all those power setting .	St
1.8.9	If you like , keep it simple place system on a power strip ( surge protection ? )	Ques
1.8.10	and when done , just switch it off provided you did a proper shutdown .	St
1.8.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
