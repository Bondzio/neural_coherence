i just got a new computer and my roommate has another computer.
i had to set the new computer up last night when i go to my network to manage it the network is in my roommates name now and it says i have not been invited to manage the network.
how does he do that?
i have hp vista, he has a dell xp.
we both are using mcafee and that program is telling me i have to get his permission.
i do not know how the network is in his name now and why i have to be invited to manage it.
thanks in advance.
