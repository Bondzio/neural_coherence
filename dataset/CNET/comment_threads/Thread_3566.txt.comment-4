I think you're right.
I had my thinking backwards.
But I swore I had heard that a few years ago.
Your answer was really helpful, though probably a little too advanced for my good Never the less, everything I needed to know.
Sorry about the double post.
I originally posted this last night and didn't get any responses, so I was thinking I had put it in the wrong forum (I've done this before) So I decided to repost.
Thanks again!
