<s> I'm not really a computer person but my grandmother recently asked me to help her pick out a new computer. </s>
<s> I really want to make sure she gets something that will suit her needs and not give her any trouble. </s>
<s> Here's what is important for it to have: Reliability. </s>
<s> Good customer support. </s>
<s> Ability to read digital camera media cards. </s>
<s> Sufficient speed to watch videos online. </s>
<s> Sufficient memory for her pictures (she doesn't take a ton of them, though, so I imagine 320GB would be enough). </s>
<s> CD/DVD burner. </s>
<s> Windows 7. </s>
<s> Small size tower would be nice. </s>
<s> What's not important: Multimedia capabilities: She doesn't even have an HD TV in the house. </s>
<s> Gaming capabilities. </s>
<s> Blu Ray. </s>
<s> Upgrade-ability. </s>
<s> The most important thing is that it will be reliable. </s>
<s> She knows nothing about computers and I live a ways away so she always has to pay someone to look at her computer when something goes wrong. </s>
<s> She would also like to keep the price under 500$, but at or under 400$ would be better (tower only). </s>
<s> Many Thanks! </s>
<s> If I were in the marker for a new desktop and ws not going to build one myself, I would probabally buy an Asus brand from a reliability standpoint. </s>
<s> Whatever you do, stay away from anyting HP or Compaq. </s>
<s> Their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible. </s>
<s> The specs may compare, but is the quality of the parts that matter. </s>
<s> there are quite a few options. </s>
<s> Maybe get a slim tower with monitor deal at one of the big-box retailers. </s>
<s> you might consider finding a desktop someone doesn't need and loading a linux distro, it should suit her needs and may be less complicated than windows. </s>
<s> I don't think brands matter too much for desktops. </s>
<s> For laptops I would be more leary of reliability because parts aren't easy to replace. </s>
<s> The only 2 parts that may differ by who made your motherboard is the motherboard and power supply. </s>
<s> Almost all the companies will have a generic psu (so no difference). </s>
<s> All companies will probably use a custom motherboard too. </s>
<s> As for the quality of the motherboard being less than that you can get if you build yourself, yes its true. </s>
<s> But I think they're on par with the other value motherboards you can buy albeit with a custom bios and less features. </s>
<s> I think you'll find most motherboards use the same materials and the markup on boards are for enthusiasts who are willing to pay a premium for gimmicks and the latest tech. </s>
<s> The profit margins for higher end stuff are a lot larger than for the value/mainstream market, but that does not mean if it costs more it'll be more reliable. </s>
<s> I read these FORUMs regularly and don't see an extraordinary number of complaints or failures on HP machines....regardless of platform. </s>
<s> Most of what I read here is people writing about upgrading the video card or RAM in their HPs. </s>
<s> So what is your basis for saying ...'Their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible.' </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> How many HPs have you had ? </s>
<s> Aren't a fair number of the HP motherboards made by ASUS ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Today your consumer machines are five year designs. </s>
<s> Once you get over that you understand you need to think of this as rent and act accordingly as well as maintain backups of what you can't lose. </s>
<s> To go beyond 5 years we'll have to implement a maintenance system that the maker cycles parts out as they approach the usual MTBF hours. </s>
<s> Sadly this means the cost tends to go up about 10x of what you could spend with a normal replace a machine when it breaks cycle. </s>
