I've tried two drives and yet I get a &quot;no 80 conductor cable installed&quot; error message. Is this a mainboard issue? It just happened one day when I turned on the computer, though I've had compatability problems since I got the Seagate. Don't know if it's coincidence or not. I've installed millions of hard disks and have never had this happen. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.

The cable's plugged in correctly (blue plug into the MB). Both drives were set to cable select. I even changed the last one to SLAVE and it made no difference. Also can't find much on the Internet to address this except that many people seem to be experiencing this. Any other ideas?

Then one day came the dreaded knocking sound. I noticed I was getting the error message on bootup and swapped the drive for the second one. No knocking sound, but though the disk IS recognized in the bios, I still get the same error message. I'm beginning to believe it may be a MB problem. I may just have to get a massive single drive or swap to the more modern SATA drives. But if it's a MB problem, I may be playing with fire. Any other recommendations? Thanks!
