i would hook up by phone - but - i have a speach impediment that the phone seems to make worse - even to those that know me.
not to mention bad hearing - but the speaker phone button helps.
its just - crap - even been hung up on when trying to order something by phone - cause they thought i was a bitty kid or something and couldnt understand zip.
hahaha just love getting old - not ted :-))
