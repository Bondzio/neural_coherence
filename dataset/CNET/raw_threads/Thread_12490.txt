The main PC is running Vista, all the others are XP. Router is a Linkys Wireless-G (WRT54G). I had everything running fine and dandy -- all the PCs were connected on-line, I could share files easily. And then Microsoft pushed out their security fixes a couple of weeks ago. Now, after changing absolutely NOTHING on my own, none of my three XP systems can access the Public Folders on the Vista system. They can SEE the public folder, but when I try to actually go into the folder, the XP systems all get hung up. All my settings are as they were on the Vista PC and the XP systems. Sharing is on, etc, etc. It's absolutly infuriating that I lost functionality after a supposed &quot;fix.&quot; Anyone else running into this problem???

For me it's &quot;bob&quot; and then I see if &quot;bob&quot; can access the files locally and then across the network. I'll also check the firewall settings since updates can remove my rules. Bob
