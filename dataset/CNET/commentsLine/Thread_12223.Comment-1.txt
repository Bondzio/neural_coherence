i bought an alienware area-51 a little bit more then a month ago.
when i put it into sleep mode, it starts again after a minute or two.
some times it just starts a second after it goes to sleep.
thats very frustrating since i use the sleep mode a lot.
im running a norwegian windows 7 professional... can that be a problem?
