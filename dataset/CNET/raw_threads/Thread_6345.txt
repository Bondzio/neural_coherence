The old computer will not start up. I pulled out the external hard drive (Western WD 1200BEVS) SATA 2.5&quot; and purchased a Thermaltake BlacX docking station (P/N: ST0005U) to transfer data onto my new notebook. It says it should easily transfer SATA 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; hard drives. I am cannot connect my hard drive to it. Do you know why?

The connection &quot;Teeth&quot; on the internal drive do not appear to map directly into the docking station. Is there any other information I should provide?

Now having said that, I found this docks to be rather flimsy and non-intuitive when it slides &quot;home.&quot; You have the right parts. Here's a cable I use instead of the docks. -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020 (many out there like that.) Bob
