I have done a lot of work with the Linksys WRT54G, WRT54GS, and WRT54GC wireless-g routers.
In addition to disabling the SSID broadcast, there is a setting on the WRT54G and WRT54GS to disable the wireless portion of the router (set Wireless Network Mode to ''Disabled'').
The firmware versions I have encountered for the WRT54GC do not have the ability to disable its wireless network.
If I needed to disallow all wireless connections, I probably would enable MAC address filtering but permit no MAC addresses to connect.
I also would enable encryption and disable the SSID broadcast.
Hmmm...I guess I could also place the router in heavy 2.4GHz interference/blocking areas.
