I've been doing a lot of research and I keep hearing about the 27in P2770H and the 24in FX2490HD. I know that the difference in screen size is significant, but should I still prioritize the FX2490HD due to being a backlit-LED monitor over the P2770H's LCD panel? I always hear about the superiority of LED in producing more vibrant colors and contrast, but according to CNET's tests, the P2770H showed higher brightness (267 vs. 239), contrast (1003:1 vs. 983:1), and DisplayMate score (94 vs. 93). Does that mean that the color and contrast of the P2770H is better than LED-backlit FX2490HD? Thanks in advance...
