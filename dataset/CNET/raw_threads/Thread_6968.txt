6695	0	167400	1852122	NR	wait3264	4/3/06 5:23 AM	1.14404178E12	Can't open BIOS	I have a Gateway performance 1600 PC, XP Home, 512 MB Ram, P4. I can't get into the BIOS setup to see why I am getting a keyboard error on boot. The keyboard works fine and shows up in the device manager correctly. I just did a clean install of my OS (It is actually installed as an upgrqade to ME). I had the keyboard problem before the reinstallation.. The manual says to press and hold F1 during restart. I tried with a restart and a cold boot. I don't see anything about entering setup on the screens that flash by during the bootup process. Any suggestions? Thanks Kay
