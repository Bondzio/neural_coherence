<s> i'm not sure if this is the right forum, but bear with me, i'm new here. </s>
<s> that said, here is my problem: i want to find a wiring diagram for a laptop lcd/tft screen so i can make an adapter to plug it into my graphics card and have a secondary monitor. </s>
<s> where would i find info on this? </s>
<s> thanks for any help in advance! </s>
<s> See if http://www.eserviceinfo.com/equipment_type/Notebooks_43.html helps, but its been over a decade and I've yet to see anyone do this. </s>
<s> best of luck! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> no luck on the previous post, but i do thank you for your input! </s>
<s> anyone have any more suggestions? </s>
<s> I'm sure you have checked but most laptops I have seen lately have a VGA output built in and a connector for the cable in the back. </s>
<s> This does not necessarily add the ability to run two monitors at a time. </s>
<s> This takes special circuitry and not just parallel wiring. </s>
<s> Quote from Steven Haninger &quot; I'm sure you have checked but most laptops I have seen lately have a VGA output built in...&quot; this is true, but i am looking for an input. </s>
<s> i don't need to display from the lcd, but to it. </s>
<s> i have been searching endlessly and found that at least two people have used the Vesa connector on their graphics cards to connect a laptop lcd to their desktops. </s>
<s> but the best quality of color they have gotten is 16 colors. </s>
<s> i am looking for at least 16 bit and a resolution of at least 1024x768. </s>
<s> this is why i thought that maybe with the pinouts of my graphics card, and the pinout of an lcd, i would be able to have a primary (or secondary) monitor. </s>
<s> thank you for the input Steven, but i'm afraid i sitll haven't gotten the answer i'm looking for. </s>
<s> i'm still open for suggestions for anyone that has them! </s>
<s> thanks again! </s>
<s> It's like we watch you struggle at the end of a rope. </s>
<s> Someday it will dawn on you that such a &quot;adapter&quot; or &quot;rewiring&quot; doesn't work. </s>
<s> How can I shorten the time it takes you to realize that Laptop LCD's are not VGA Displays in disguise? </s>
<s> You don't want to know the truth so you may struggle trying to do this for weeks and months. </s>
<s> Here's hoping you will realize that this may never work. </s>
<s> If it did, you'd find articles aplenty on the web. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Would a shared desktop suit your purposes? </s>
<s> This is easy with a network connection and MS NetMeeting. </s>
<s> ok, here's what is happening: VGA is analog - I KNOW. </s>
<s> i said DVI or Vesa, both of which are digital. </s>
<s> now, maybe it is you &quot;struggling at the end of your rope&quot;....i don't know, nor do i care. </s>
<s> but this HAS been done. </s>
<s> there is a website ( http://www.tft2pc.maltepoeggel.de/ ) but is in german. </s>
<s> use babelfish to translate the site, you shouldn't have to &quot;struggle&quot; too much with it. </s>
<s> now, before anyone else tells me it hasn't or can't be done, take a look at that site to be proven WRONG! </s>
<s> it is possible, and it is somewhat what i'm looking for, but the person on that site has only been able to get a max resolution of 640x480 and 16 colors. </s>
<s> i want a minimum resloution of 1024x768 and at least 16 bit color. </s>
<s> but thank you for letting me see that you don't know what you're talking about....made me laugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> nope, i'm going to fiberglass a bezel and a wall mount for an lcd, or 2 (minus the rest of the laptop) and i want it connected to my desktop. </s>
<s> As an electronics design engineer, I know it is possible but it's not a simple wiring issue and your laptop doesn't have to use VGA signals to the display. </s>
<s> Since you were so nice, I leave to learn about all this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> To make a long story short, contact the supplier or vendor of the laptop. </s>
<s> -OR- have a friend in the business get the manuals for the product in question. </s>
<s> The repair maunals have the specs and such, but prepare to pay. </s>
<s> If you find some SAMS listing on just laptops, don't expect to match entirely the end product just a generalization at best or get lucky. </s>
<s> In the longrun, you maybe making an &quot;interface&quot; adapter not just a wiring adapter for a simple pin1-2 whcih should be part of the overall solution. </s>
<s> Put it this way, its a long way until completed and yes you'll need the specs. </s>
<s> manual and of course understand the engineering involved as you've seen the basic output wasn't what you desired, you duplicating the laptop interface for a more hands-on connection. </s>
<s> FYI - Laptops are such a PITA, I readily pass it on to the authorized centers if a quick fix can't be made. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy 2-cents spent </s>
