thanks for the reply and the link.
not sure exactly whats wrong.
i had 3 hard drives go out in a months time.
a 2 and a half year old sata Maxtor 300gb was first to go.
then a 100gb Seagate ide hard drive, then my 500gb Seagate ide hard drive.
the 500gb was just a few months old.
thats all in a little under a month.
that cant be a coincidence.
my guess is somethings up with the mobo but i dont know what would cause that.
any idea?
thanks, John
