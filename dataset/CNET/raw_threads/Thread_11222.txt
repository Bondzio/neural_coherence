I am trying to configure it so that I can use both ports for internet. RIght now, I can only connect one port so that my computer can use the internet and connect to my home network. Is there a way that I can set up the second port as an OUT source so that I can hook up my laptop to it through an ethernet cable to get internet as well? RIght now, when I connect my laptop to the second ethernet port, I get a connection popup but it says that it is limited and I can't connect to the internet. It &quot;senses&quot; my computer but I can't acces the internet. Can anybody help me? Or am I just thinking wrong and you can't output internet connection.

If you don't have a router, you can connect an ethernet crossover cable between the machine with Internet access and the laptop. This requires available network interface cards on both. Then run the network setup wizard on both machines starting with the desktop. Use the same workgroup name on all computers. Enable Internet Connection Sharing and File/Printer sharing. This will assign a static IP address of 192.168.0.1 to the desktop. The last octet of the laptop IP address will vary with use; 192.168.0.xxx.
