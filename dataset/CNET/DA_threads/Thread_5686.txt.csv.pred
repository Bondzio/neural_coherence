1.1.1	Hi all .	St
1.1.2	I just purchased a new SATA 500GB drive that my computer will not recognize .	St
1.1.3	I already have a 200GB IDE drive .	St
1.1.4	I set the BIOS on-chip configuration to SATA and the boot sequence sees the new drive but when I get into windows the drive is not there .	St
1.1.5	Under device management I see the IDE , CD and DVD drives but not the new drive .	St
1.1.6	There are two SATA on-board connections and I have tried them both .	St
1.1.7	The drive spins up and seems to work .	St
1.1.8	I took it back to where I purchased it and they say it 's fine .	St
1.1.9	My only other option is to get one of those PCI , SATA to IDE adapter cards .	St
1.1.10	I am running Windows XP on a MSI motherboard 1.6GHz AMD processor .	St
1.1.11	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks , Mark	St
1.2.1	I bought a couple hdds for my first computer and had the same thing happen to me with my Seagate but not my Western Digital .	St
1.2.2	The problem turned out to be that the Seagate simply did n't format itself on its own like the Western Digital .	St
1.2.3	It 's been such a long time since I found where it was hiding when I booted the computer up that I 've forgotten how to find it again .	St
1.2.4	This site though has step-by-step instructions on how to do it , and it looks about the same as what I did .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.ehow.com/how_6026_format-hard-drive.html	St
1.3.1	No , it 's a Western Digital and I did look in the 'Manage ' area and the new drive is not showing up , that is my problem .	St
1.3.2	I know how to format the drive but I need to see it before I can format it .	St
1.3.3	LOL .	St
1.3.4	Any other ideas ?	Ques
1.3.5	Thanks again	St
1.4.1	And you can not see the drive under 'disk management ' ?	Ques
1.4.2	What XP service pack are you running ?	Ques
1.4.3	Is the jumper on the HDD set for SATA 1.5 or 3.0 ?	Ques
1.4.4	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Well , I took the tech 's advice and got the PCI adapter card and that seems to have fixed the problem , he indicated the SATA on-board connections may not be working , not sure how but ... After all this , my internet connection got messed up somehow .	St
1.5.2	I could ping sites , but I still got the & quot ; page not found & quot ; error .	St
1.5.3	I spent an hour going over everything ; I even reset the winsock and nothing .	St
1.5.4	I turned off all startup programs , nothing , then disabled the panda security/virus software , Poof , works fine now .	St
1.5.5	Thanks for all your help , Mark	St
