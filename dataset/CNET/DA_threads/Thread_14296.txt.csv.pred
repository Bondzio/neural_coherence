1.1.1	I have an ASUS P5VD1-X motherboard Rev 1.xx Bus Clock : 200 megahertz BIOS : American Megatrends Inc. 080012 12/06/2005 I would like to add another hard drive or two .	St
1.1.2	I already have 2 hard drives , a dvd burner , and a cd burner installed , thus using up all the ide channels on the board .	St
1.1.3	I do n't want to buy a PCI slot ide controller in order to add more drives unless I have to .	St
1.1.4	So I am wondering if I can make use of the SATA controllers on the board at the same time as the ide primary and secondary channels .	St
1.2.1	Not a problem .	St
1.2.2	SATA does n't get BIOS from CMOS so you might have to load a driver though .	St
1.2.3	Do you have a sufficient power supply ?	Ques
1.3.1	I have a 430W PSU , Nvidia 6200 AGP graphics card , which does n't require a separate power cord from the psu , DVD burner , CD burner , soundblaster live sound card , 80 gb maxtor HD and a 20 gb maxtor HD installed .	St
1.3.2	I would think the PSU could handle another drive but I do n't know anything about the power requirements of a SATA drive verses an ide drive .	St
