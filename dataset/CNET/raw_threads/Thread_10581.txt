I am planning on purchasing a new computer at some point in the near future. My question: How do I go about transfering my downloaded music from the old computer to the new one? Thanks! Starfish

If it's DRM-free music, it's the same way as for all other files, like: - burn to CD or DVD - copy to USB-stick or external hard disk - direct cable connection or home network - copy to and from a shared storage site on Internet - mail to yourself as an attachment - copy to and from your mp3-player (a 40 Gb iTunes does fine, probably) It might be a little bit more complex if: - it's DRM'ed music that won't play on another PC by default (because it's tied to your current computer) - you want to transfer not only the music files but also the music library with all meta data (like playlists) In that case, it depends on both the media player you use and the site where you bought those music files. And without knowing those small details, nothing specific can be said. Kees

So forgive me if I ask stupid questions. -Oh don't I wish burning to a CD was an option. It is not. The current computer I use does not have a CD burner. This is one reason I can't wait to upgrade. -as for a USB stick...these can be purchased inexpensively? -Can music from an Mp3 player be easily transfered on TO another computer? I've never tried it in reverse. I have a Sandisk 1GB Mp3 player (which I love) that I also use microSD cards with so it's capacity is expanded. I'd say I have less then 3Gb worth of music at this point that will need to be transferred. What do you think my best/easiest option would be? Thanks! Starfish

And, of course, once you used it to transfer 4 Gb and burned that to DVD as backup, you can delete everything on it and transfer another 4Gb. And so on. It's a nice medium to take data (whatever data) with you. I wouldn't consider USD 30 expensive. Players that let you transfer music to them via Windows Explorer let you move files back also. Just like moving from one folder to another. If you need a dedicated program to manage the music on your player it's not always possible. And most modern PC's come with a multi-card-reader. Just plug in the micro-SD card from your player and copy music files to your hard disk. So there are all kinds of possibilities. Choose one you can manage. Kees

Check around for some deals, you may find something better that I did. The biggest ones I've heard of so far are 8 GB, but there could be bigger ones out there. Now with the sandisk 1gb player you may be able to get the data from point A to point B using that. I will say though the memory stick is easier. plug and play really.
