and is it setup per our forum sticky.
some leave it on open wifi connections or wep and their network is pirated away by neighbors.
also there are issues with p2p software and speed so i won't be helping on that area here as it's all about the sofware used (not in the posts) as well as how such speed was measured.
hope there's something that can be done.
