My scanner was dead.
Best Buy replaced it tonight, no questions asked.
Mind if I ask a newbie follow-up question?
The new scanner identical to the old with the same software.
I had recently updated the drivers on the old one.
Can I just plug the new one in and run it on the old software or do I have to uninstall the old software and install the new?
