Device manager shows only Intel 82801EB ultra ATA storage controllers When I loaded XP and pressed F6 and tried to load Abit Sata Installation Disk V1.33 (didnt get a floppy with the board) Xp wouldnt load it. I read (at http://forum.abit-usa.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=77346 ) I didnt need to load any drivers because the motherboard uses ICH5 not ICH5-R. In the bios I have the onChip ide controller enabled and set to auto and the onChip Serial ATA set to enhanced (also tried auto and sata only). In this configuration the Sata 1 is to serve as IDE-3 master with controller 1 and 2 enabled and the hdd does show as 3.

These drivers are for running RAID Arrays and will not work with the ICH5 because it does not support this feature. The drives will show as Intel 82801EB ultra ATA and run at DMA 5 which is normal because these are the drivers that Intel/Microsoft supplies with the OS (remember that SATA came out after Windows Xp and most other OS's). Also most SATA I drives are just PATA (IDE) drives with an SATA interface added to them (basically like adding a PATA to SATA adapter to an IDE hard drive and connecting it to the SATA connector on the MB). edit: from abit forum
