I updated my bios to asus v.1704.
I have waited a while to see if it has done anything but just now the same problem has occurred.
There is a beta version of a newer bios and another bios version that is in their ftp but not on the main site.
Should I update to those or is this a hardware issue?
I saw on the asus site someone else with the same problem with the same board, could is be my motherboard going bad.
His post: &quot;However, if I reset the CMOS by using the jumpers, my computer seems to 'remember' my hard drives at this point.
I replaced my cmos battery but that didnt help.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&quot;
