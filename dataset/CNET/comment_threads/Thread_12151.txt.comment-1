I run a wireless home network using a Belkin G router.
I've set the PC/XPpro connected to the router to share a directory and a printer.
The old pentium3 client was able to see the shares just fine.
On my new MacBook Pro / XPpro, however, I get an error when trying to access the workgroup.
A generic error only: &quot;Not accessible... might not have permissions... contact administrator...&quot;.
The Mac IS able to connect to the internet via the wireless router.
I found a link which says it may be Norton Anti-Virus's fault ( http://www.onecomputerguy.com/windowsxp_tips.htm#network_access_norton ), but the error or the registry entry referred to there don't exist on my host.
How can I find out WHY it's not accessible, and then to go about fixing it?
Thanx, Nir
