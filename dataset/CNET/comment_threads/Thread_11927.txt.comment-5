http://usa.asus.com/index.htm http://www.aspireusa.net/index.htm http://www.corsairmicro.com/ http://www.maxpoint.com/products/pow_supp/ Try to buy only &quot;Retail&quot; parts and no &quot;OEM&quot; parts.
Most &quot;OEM&quot; parts have firmware and/or drivers made for there designed systems.
Also &quot;OEM&quot; parts come with no paperwork.
Hope this Helps...
