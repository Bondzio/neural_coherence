1.1.1	Please help , are their any cheaper routers for the xbox than the MS one for $ 100 ?	Ques
1.2.1	Most gamers will tell you that a wired connection is better when it comes to online gaming but if that is not possible then check out your router brand ( D-link , Netgear , Linksys ) for usb adapters .	St
1.2.2	You should be able to get one for around $ 50 and it 's best to stick to the same brand for troubleshooting problems .	St
1.2.3	You should already own a wireless router and need only an USB adapter for the Xbox .	St
1.3.1	I have several friends with Xbox 360 's ( i prefer my pc ) .	St
1.3.2	In particular one of my friends has the MS wireless adapter and another an Ethernet cable .	St
1.3.3	My friend with the wireless adapter can use easily with his network with little problems , fast download speeds and little lag .	St
1.3.4	My friend with the wired connection on the other hand had to change his ISP from tiscally to BT ( in the UK this is ) as only BT can do 360 Ethernet connection .	St
1.3.5	The wired connection caused more problems and in the end costs more because of the ISP change .	St
1.4.1	I found that the Linksys WGA54G usb adapter works well with the 360 .	St
1.4.2	You can often find it for considerably less than the Microsoft adapter .	St
1.4.3	Previously using MS adapter , then router died .	St
1.4.4	Had to move to this as the MS adapter was incompatible with my new pre-N router from that I purchased from Netgear .	St
