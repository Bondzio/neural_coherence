<s> I may crossfire 2 4870x2's in the future. </s>
<s> Just want plenty of room. </s>
<s> calculators and it calculated your current PSU requirement at 338 Watts. </s>
<s> If you add another 4870 GPU, another HDD, another DVD plus 4 USBs and 2 120MM FAN it only calls for PSU with 527 watts &lt;40 AMPs. </s>
<s> I'm a firm believer in capacity or room to grow but a 1000 watt PSU for a system requiring less than 350 watt or 527 watts is over the top even for this builder of 22 years. </s>
<s> Good Luck on your choices and your build. </s>
