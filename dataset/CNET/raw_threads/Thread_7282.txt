I mistakenly believed it was 2x512 mb. I'm thinking of trying to match this stick with another 1 gig stick for dual channel mode on a nforce4 939 motherboard (JetWay 939GT4SLI-G-VC). Can anyone tell me if there's another brand that will do dual channel with it? Finding the exact same ram stick for an acceptable price is problematic. Specifications Part Number: PQI3200-1024SBL Package: 1024MB single pack Organization: 128M x 64-bit CAS Latency: 2-3-2-5 Test Voltage: 2.6 V PCB Board: 8 Layers PCB Speed: DDR 400 MHz (PC3200) Type: 184-pin DDR SDRAM Error Checking: Non-ECC Registered/Unbuffered: Unbuffered Thanks in advance!
