i was able to make it work from windows updgrade, but decided that i wanted the full support of the mulifuncion capabilities, so i went with the vista 64 bits full download drivers and installed that on my 64 bits windows 7 pro, no problems and got back the pc fax at the same time.
i just have praise with windows ps that printers is fairly old i.e.
4 years old at least.
