1.1.1	My husband has a custom built tower from Fry's with a 60gb SSD as the C drive.	St
1.1.2	It's in a slot on the top that you can pull out.	St
1.1.3	It has now filled up even though we tried to install everything we could on E: & F: and won't let us even update the virus program or window's updates.	St
1.1.4	Well he bought a 120gb SSD and Norton Ghost.	St
1.1.5	Can you give us the basic steps?	St
1.1.6	Like First install the new SSD Then image the C: to the new SSD He thinks he can just copy the C: to F: and then pull out the old SSD and put the new SSD in and then copy from F:.	St
1.1.7	I don't think it works that way.	St
1.1.8	If you pull out the C: drive won't the computer stop working?	St
1.1.9	Don't we have to install the new SSD in the computer first?	St
1.1.10	Also another thing I worry about is if you image the old SSD to the new SSD how do you keep all the GB on the new one without turning it into a 60GB?	St
1.1.11	Follow me?	St
1.1.12	I'm pretty good at figuring computer stuff out but this sounds too scary for me.	St
1.1.13	But if I had the basic steps I could probably figure out the details.	St
1.1.14	Is this something we can try or do OR should we let Fry's do it?	Sug
1.1.15	They can probably do it in a hour with a more professional program.	St
1.1.16	It will probably take us 3 days of stress.	St
1.2.1	For more background info, here's a link to my first question I posted when we bought the Fry's computer.	St
1.2.2	Well now it's a year later and we filled up it up!	St
1.2.3	How you doing with your 64GB, Kees?	St
