I just replaced my internal CD drive with an external, dismanteled the internal and renamed the external &quot;D&quot;. Now the Esc procedure does not work. Why? I am running Windows XP and Fantom makes the drive. My computer is the Gateway Solo 1450 laptop. I have all six Windows setup floppies. When it asks for the OS CD the process stops.

If your external is USB connected, your BIOS needs to be able to recognize the CD ROM device and you need to put it first in the boot order if you can. Otherwise, it's not going to work as you wish.

I have been absent because I had to take the computer into a local repair. The long story is in another thread I started about repartitioning. Anyway, my internal drive works intermitently and I am looking to replace it. This computer, the Gateway Solo 1450 laptop, does not boot from a USB connected device.
