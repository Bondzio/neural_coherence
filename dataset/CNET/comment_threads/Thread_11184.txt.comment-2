Looking at http://www.ecsusa.com/downloads/pm800-m2.html I see this is a VIA based board.
No mention of the OS and if you installed the latest drivers you can find for the motherboard, but it's a common cause.
The mention of fans plus quite a full machine would have me running it without the case cover for now.
While my p4 is all of 3.0GHz, I fitted a generic 680Watt supply to it for the simple reason I know to max out that area even though I don't believe it could deliver that number.
