i just got my new xion solaris case from newegg.com it has 2 front audio and 2 front usb ports.
using both the motherboard and case manuals i connected the cables for the usb to my motherboard and doublechecked that the pins were correct, but the ports are not working.
i did not connect the audio ports and left the pins jumped.
i am running win xp sp2; this is my first case with front usb.
