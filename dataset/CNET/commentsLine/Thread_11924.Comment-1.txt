i would like to update my desktop with a new video card.
i have a dell dimension 4400 with 640mb's of ddr ram.
i am running windows xp home.
the current card is an ati rage 128 with 16mb.
i don't play games but the video seems slow.
i understand that i have a 250 watt power supply so i would be limited to ram size in the replacement.
now the question!
could i run a card with 128 mb and tv out?
what would be a compatible card for my system that could be had for under say $75?
thanks
