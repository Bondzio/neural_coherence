<s> Hi to everyone and thanks in advance for any help... </s>
<s> I think that my ISP is throttling my bandwidth at the modem and I am here to ask help on how access full available bandwidth. </s>
<s> When the technician installed the fibre optic line and then the modem, he showed me an amazing 77MB/s (about 600Mbps) before the modem!! </s>
<s> But after the technician left these were the test results after the router: 1) SpeedTests.net: averages, after router, show: UP between 56/60Mbps & DN 45/75Mbps 2) Local Server Speed Test: average: UP 45Mpbs & DN 170Mbps A Japanese Internet savvy guy explained that NTT East throttles the available bandwidth at the building by specific apartment/modem settings related to individual contract bundles. </s>
<s> I signed up for the top bundle: TV, Phone and Internet connections. </s>
<s> This is my Hardware/software setup: OS: Win7, Line specs: Line type: IEC60874-14 Connector type: SC Core across: 9 micrometers Clad across: 125 micrometers ITU-TG-652 NTT East fibreoptic TV/Internet/Telephone bundle (100Mbps best effort) Hikari Next Family Type but 10Mbps is considered within parameters Asahi ISP Internet contract Modem: GE-PON (WAN+Coaxial TV antenna) &quot;SCM-GE-PON-&lt;H&gt;A GV-ONU D&lt;1&gt;&quot; model Router: RT-S300HI (4 Giga ports + 1 phone) Router & Modem have Japanese firmware which I cannot understand and, according to the NTT East, I must rent both modem and router from them and &quot;will not support any other modem/router setup&quot;. </s>
<s> I could not understand if it was because of technical or contractual limits. </s>
<s> I have tried to test my throughput after the modem but I could not figure out where the DNS, IP, WAN etc strings of numbers should go and, in the end, I simply cannot connect to the internet from my laptop directly to the modem so I cannot perform the same speed tests after the modem. </s>
<s> I appreciate help and I thank in advance for reading thus far and for any help and expertise which any one can spare/offer! </s>
<s> It is unlikely the limitation is in the equipment in your house. </s>
<s> They know very there are lots of guys like you that can't resist digging around. </s>
<s> The modem you can't do much about, it will cost way too much money to get into a optical line. </s>
<s> If this is done the way I have seen them done in the US they deliver the cable tv on one frequency of laser and the internet on another another. </s>
<s> You would have to have this special optics to do this. </s>
<s> The router I suspect is nothing too special. </s>
<s> They may be limiting your uplink speed with this but it hard to tell. </s>
<s> I would bet it is just a rebranded PPP based router. </s>
<s> I can't read the manuals in Japanese The way they most likely limit you is by your user id. </s>
<s> When you log in via PPP they can then limit you either by IP or mac address on their equipment. </s>
<s> The test you saw done was probable a special test id that can only get to the test server. </s>
<s> If I were them I would rig it so even if you stole that ID it could only run to the special test server. </s>
<s> @ Bill 012 Thank you. </s>
<s> Your reply was helpful and clear. </s>
<s> I appreciate your time and lending me your expertise! </s>
<s> I really appreciate people who share their knowledge and abilities for the simple sake of helping others. </s>
<s> I wish I could do likewise. </s>
<s> So replacing a modem is not as straight forward as I imagined or as replacing a router. </s>
<s> Understood. </s>
<s> BTW, the router is probably a PPP, as you say as this is the green light that they keep asking me if it is on or off. </s>
<s> Router: Since the router will be easier to replace, I went ahead and I just bought a top of the line Asus (AC66U) to replace the present Ethernet only router - at least I will have WiFi and better throughput @ the router end. </s>
<s> Modem: I will drop &lt;phone/cableTV/internet&gt; bundle in favor of internet only contract: it's cheaper, I don't understand Japanese TV and IP phone often doesn't work with fax, 800 numbers, etc. </s>
<s> They will replace the bundle services modem which I have now with an internet only new modem next week: which are the critical settings which I should check (while the technician works) to successfully replace this internet only leased new modem with a purchased one? </s>
<s> Any chances that I might pull it off if I get the right parameters? </s>
<s> Which are they? </s>
<s> Again, thanks for your time and help! </s>
