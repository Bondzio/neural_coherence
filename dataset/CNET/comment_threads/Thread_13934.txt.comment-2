A kick that dents a PC case isn't a small one and opening a hard drive to troubleshoot it is an almost certain kiss of death.
I'd say to evaluate the damage and see what's salvageable you'd need to do such one component at a time using another PC to test them.
I doubt you're clicking hard drives are going to be recognizable on any PC, however.
There are data recovery services available.
I can't say how much they charge but it may be more then the cost of an entire PC and with no guarantee of complete success.
