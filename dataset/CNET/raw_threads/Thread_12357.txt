I don't want to replace the video card just add a tuner. I would like it to have an FM tuner, decent software, and be in the 30~70 dollar range. Any suggestions? Thanks!

I have an ATI and a Asus also, but the software sucks. difficult to install and there is no &quot;on top view&quot; that lets you view in a separate window on top of your Computing. The Hauppage Win TV analog, I have had for five years and works well in Win98 and WinXP. See http://www.hauppauge.com/html/products.htm for some Ideas.
