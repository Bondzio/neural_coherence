but let's get this up on the table.
the tablet makers do not see recurring revenue by issuing updates.
in fact i've encountered bugs in systems and years later the bug is still there.
let's take the gloves off and not sugar coat this issue.
you can not expect the tablet makers to issue updates.
apple will be the exception but you see that ipad 1 may have had it's last update.
