1.1.1	Hi We have i-Mac 20 & quot ; with built in i-sight Power PC , one of last ones I think before the intel .	St
1.1.2	We have had a few problems before with it powering down and going to sleep .	St
1.1.3	Used to hoover dust out and that seemed to fix it .	St
1.1.4	Now it wo n't start at all .	St
1.1.5	I have tried all the PRAM and various commands to re set various things but none of these work .	St
1.1.6	We had a wireless keyboard and I have just tried a wired one but I do not think either are connecting as the tab key light does not come on , which it does when I tested the wired on on my lap top .	St
1.1.7	When it died it crashed with a cd in drive .	St
1.1.8	I have removed this and replaced it with the mac install disk to try and run the disk check but the optical drive is not starting at all either .	St
1.1.9	All that happens on start up is the sleep light comes on , then after a few moments fan starts to whirl .	St
1.1.10	I can '' t hear the hard drive - have tried to rock hard drive to get it to spin but nothing .	St
1.1.11	Just wondering whether worth trying to replace optical drive or is this being controlled by hard drive - hence its not working nor hard drive .	St
1.1.12	is there any way to recover data if it is the hard drive that is dead ?	Ques
1.1.13	anything else I can try and replace to fix it ?	Ques
1.1.14	could I use an external optical drive connected via USB to start ?	Ques
1.1.15	I have tried to firewire but not joy their either !	St
1.1.16	Many Thanks John	St
1.2.1	what response did you get ?	Ques
1.2.2	Any attempt at powering up ?	Ques
1.2.3	Powered up but did not actually boot ?	Ques
1.2.4	Flashing question mark ?	Ques
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	Hi Screen remains off , sleep light comes on .	St
1.3.2	Little to no noise , no clicking hard drive or anything .	St
1.3.3	Then fans starts in about 4 minutes - its like its never awoken from sleep !	St
1.3.4	The only thing I can think to do is take hard drive out - see if that works and recover data.I am nw wondering may be its a logic board failure ?	Ques
1.3.5	they seem pricey enough to replace and not sure if worth it on 6 year old mac ?	Ques
1.3.6	John	St
1.4.1	Just three captive screws on the bottom and the whole back just lifts off .	St
1.4.2	Everything is accessible from there .	St
1.4.3	Removing the HD is certainly an option , from your description it is probably just fine .	St
1.4.4	Try this before removing the drive .	St
1.4.5	Remove the back , remove the little battery and leave for 20 minutes .	St
1.4.6	Put the battery back in , replace the back , keyboard and mouse & power cord .	St
1.4.7	Try to start it .	St
1.4.8	If you get a reaction , good .	St
1.4.9	If not proceed to remove the HD and recover data before doing anything else .	St
1.4.10	It may be possible to get a replacement board but , given the age of this machine , it may be time to consider a newer iMac .	St
1.4.11	P	St
1.5.1	Hi thanks for that - where is the battery I have n't tried that - its a g5 imac isight , so quite tricky inside ?	Ques
1.5.2	many thanks	Polite
1.6.1	had a case change and is not so easy to get into .	St
1.6.2	If you have never tried this before , I would advise against it .	St
1.6.3	On these models , it is not the back that comes off , it 's the front , and it is held in by some clever clips that require a bent piece of flat , fairly rigid , thin plastic .	St
1.6.4	It is doable though , just really tricky I could send you instructions if you decide to proceed .	St
1.6.5	P	St
1.7.1	Hi I am in , have removed hard drive just would like to try the battery fix but can not see for the life of me where its is .	St
1.7.2	I am guessing it is under something else I need to take off ?	Ques
1.7.3	I think I will need a special screw driver - done ok so far but some of these screws in side I am struggling with - if you can tell me where battery is that would be great Thanks J	St
1.8.1	that 's where Apple says the battery is located .	St
1.8.2	It is one of those disk shaped batterys P	St
1.9.1	Thanks I am going to buy the special screw drivers .	St
1.9.2	I am guessing that part is under the main body so I am going to have to pull more stuff out !	St
1.9.3	Ugh J	St
