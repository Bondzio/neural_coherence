<s> I have recently been banned from a website and they thave banned me from it by &quot;logging my IP address&quot;. </s>
<s> I am not sure how this works(im not really that expereienced with computers) but apparently to change your IP address if you have broadband you have to speak to your ISP. </s>
<s> Is there any other way? </s>
<s> Additional info: I am using a wirless router(does this mean the router has an different IP?) </s>
<s> People get banned here as well and I'm sure we would frown on help given to those to get back in. </s>
<s> As such I think it proper that other sites respect the site ban and not help others &quot;get around&quot; the ban. </s>
<s> Instead, make amends with those you offended. </s>

<s> i was under the age limit and now that i am of age i want back in. </s>
<s> i have waited 2 days for a reply from my apology so now i want to take the law into my own hands. </s>
