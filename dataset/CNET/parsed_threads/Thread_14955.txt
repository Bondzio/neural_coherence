<s> We have a wireless network in our home. </s>
<s> All of our laptops (one HP,one Compaq & one MAC G4 access the network with no problems and the internet works well. </s>
<s> We bought a Lexmark wireless printer and both of the Windows machines found it with no problem and it prints very well. </s>
<s> The G4 has found it and it will print a flawless test page,(so I assume that wireless communication is happening)however it will not print from any applications. </s>
<s> IE: Word for MAC. </s>
<s> Always says there is a problem with the printer...Anybody have a clue? </s>
<s> You don't say what version of OS X you are running on that G4 I note that Lexmark has OS X drivers for that machine. </s>
<s> They even have Leopard drivers available. </s>
<s> Have you installed the latest drivers for your machine and OS? </s>
<s> Have you checked that your computer is actually using the Lexmark drivers and not the GIMP drivers? </s>
<s> Is the printer capable of direct printing (wired)? </s>
<s> If so, can the Mac (That's Capital &quot;C&quot;, lower case &quot;ac&quot;)(MAC is something completely different) P </s>
<s> Looks like you found me out. </s>
<s> I am a Windows person with fair to above average knowledge of most any Windows system or application problems. </s>
<s> My son has a Mac G4 running 10.4.11 We have hooked up several printers,(two HP's with direct USB cables. </s>
<s> Also hooked up a Lexmark 1400 series wireless printer). </s>
<s> G4 finds all the printers and drivers. </s>
<s> It allows us to print test,alignment pages,etc. </s>
<s> However each time we try to print from Pages or Word for Mac,we get error while printing messages and the status goes to stopped printing.. </s>
<s> you have the correct drivers for this OS and printer, I would be tempted to call Lexmark Tech Support for an answer I did not see anything regarding this type of problem on their site but it would not hurt for them to get involved. </s>
<s> Why so defensive? </s>
<s> I didn't mention Windows in my post. </s>
