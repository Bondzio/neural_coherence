<s> I am about to buy a new desktop and want to know which one to get. </s>
<s> I dont game, except for Tiger Woods and would like an above average gaming experience for that alone. </s>
<s> I am a student and low on funds. </s>
<s> I have to get it at Circuit City because I have 300 bucks in store credit there. </s>
<s> Here are the 3 desktops I am looking at: HP Pavilion Desktop PC (A820N)$799 http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/114636/originURLEncoded/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.circuitcity.com%2Fccd%2Fcategory.do%3FcatOid%3D-12962%26N%3D20012961%2B20012962%26c%3D1/rpem/ccd/productDetailSpecification.do#tabs eMachines Desktop PC (T3256)$599 http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/eMachines-Desktop-PC--T3256-/sem/rpsm/oid/99997/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do The HP Media Center Photosmart PC (M1160N)$999 Cant find the link For the price it's hard for me to not look hard into the eMachines, I have read good things about that computer. </s>
<s> But the Media Center is awfully tempting. </s>
<s> Also, it doesn't list the details on the graphics card, but I assume its either 64 or 128MB shared. </s>
<s> If this is the case if I bought a Radeon 9800 128MB would it run at 128 not integrated or will it always be integrated and running at say 64 if thats what it is. </s>
<s> If you buy a lesser computer you will only kick your self later. </s>
<s> The HP Media Center computer line is quite good. </s>
<s> You might even be able to find a store with earlier (and less expensive) models, like the m1070n or m1080n. </s>
<s> The HP Media Center PC's all come with an ATI graphics card, mine has the x300 125mb. </s>
<s> The added media features are great as well. </s>
<s> Hook you cable TV to it and you can record your TV shows while you are in class, burn DVD's, etc. </s>
<s> The Pavillion is another good solid PC if you don't need or want the media features of the m1160n. </s>
<s> I would go with the HP Pavilion Desktop PC (A820N)$799. </s>
<s> Do you plan on using the media center to it's full advantage. </s>
<s> There sems to be a lot of bull crap that just raises the price on your wallet. </s>
<s> If your like me who just cruises the WWW and plays a few games here and there definetly go for cheaper. </s>
<s> By the way, I have the same Radeon card and it runs like a champ. </s>
<s> You probably have to change a jumper on mother board and switch a setting in the bios for the ATI card to run. </s>
<s> Everything should be good from there on. </s>
<s> Make sure you get the latest ATI driver from their web site. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> WARNING!!! </s>
<s> I got this computer and hate it. </s>
<s> It comes with 3 PCI slots that are not PCI Express, and it has no AGP slot for video cards either. </s>
<s> In other words there is no way to upgrade the video card to something that is decent. </s>
<s> Why make a computer with ramm upgradeable to 4 gig but with no video card capability?? </s>
<s> So mad!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Does anyone have any opinion; good or bad about an HP Pavilion a815y or an a815n? </s>
<s> Also for someone like myself who isn't a gamer; will be using a new desktop PC strictly for email; web surfing; personal finances; and word processing could I get by with a machine that has both integrated video as well as integrated sound? </s>
<s> Big Steve End Of Message 02/06/05 </s>
<s> you cannot go a few dollars more (than the $999)and get a computer that you will not need to upgrade for years to come, even when your future kid gets old enough to play games. </s>
<s> ;-) (Just my suggestion)...I think the deal runs out Feb 9, 2005: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=61303&messageID=744946 If not, my 2nd suggestion is to go ahead and get the emachine. </s>
<s> (I don't see that model offered anymore at Circuit City, so maybe wait awhile since you have $300 credit) </s>
<s> In response to the posting that a graphics card cannot be installed in the HP a824n: A BFG Tech graphics card was installed in my son's computer with no problem and it works fine for the games he plays. </s>
<s> These games did not work with the onboard graphics the system came with, but appear to be fine now. </s>
<s> If you haven't bought your PC yet, and don't mind rebates you can go to compusa and get a $100 instant rebate and $250 mail in rebate for a net cost of $699 for the M1160n. </s>
<s> Go to www.compusa.com &gt; advertised specials. </s>
<s> I looking at buying this machine, does anyone have an opinion on this machine? </s>
