<s> I just got a new Core 2 Quad, Q9550, to replace my core 2 duo, E6600, but when I installed it there is no display on the monitor. </s>
<s> I checked to see if i installed it right, which I did, but still no display. </s>
<s> I have since put my old processor back, and my computer works fine. </s>
<s> Anyone know what might be wrong? </s>
<s> most motherboards with the 945 chipset are not compatible with a q9000 series CPU. </s>
<s> check your motherboard manufacturer's website to ensure compatibility. </s>
<s> fixing it could be as simple as a BIOS update with the old CPU installed. </s>
<s> Let us know what you find. </s>
