I do really appreciate your patience.
Maybe the only thing I haven't made clear is that it was about 2 years ago when the system crashed and it was then when I restored it, never realizing that Raid was more than a bug spray, so now I have 110 gig of data that I have accumulated since then I'm trying not to lose as I add another drive to replace the dead one that has been sitting in the system for 2 years doing nothing.
The remaining working drive is connected to the primary socket on the motherboard which is labeled pri raid.
Also, I did get into the raid controller program at startup and found that the 'array 2' is set to 'span' mode.
I guess that since I don't really understand the redundancy factor of the span mode, I don't know what is going to happen when I try to add another drive.
It looks to me like the motherboard is not going to allow me to add any drive unless it is hooked up to the raid controller, however, from what I have read, maybe I could configure the new drive in a separate array or logical drive as added storage.
Does that make any sense?
Please don't give up on me, you may be the only hope I have left.
Thanks, JDD
