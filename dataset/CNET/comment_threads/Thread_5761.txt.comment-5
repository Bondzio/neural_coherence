PCs have multiple usb root hubs.
there are usually two or more ports per hub and each port must share the usb power output of that hub.
the hubs are shown in device manager under &quot;Universal Serial Bus controllers.&quot; you need to locate two ports which are on different controllers so each port will be delivering full power.
plug in any usb device (a flash drive is ideal) and double click each &quot;USB Root Hub&quot; and check the &quot;Power&quot; tab until you find the usb device.
then plug the device into other ports until it shows up under a different hub.
but if you're worried, a powered usb hub will definitely give you enough juice.
