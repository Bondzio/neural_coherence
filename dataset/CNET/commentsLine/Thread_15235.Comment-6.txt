thanks that little bit of info helped me understand the pricing of motherboards.
just one other question, what exactly is the purpose of the little 1&quot; slot next to the pci express slot, i know that its a part of the pci-e slot but that is its purpose?
i cant seem to find anything on a video card that would plug into the slot.
not even the big monster video cards that take up two expansion slots.
