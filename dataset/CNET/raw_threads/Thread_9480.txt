I just need help with choosing the motherboard and Im thinking of have a dual channel for the ram because i heard that its pretty good. here's the website that im going to buy it from: http://www.pricespy.co.nz/cat_6.html?s=1&g=175 and here are the components that i've chosen so far: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600, 2.4GHz, LGA775, quad core $386.35 Seagate 250GB 7200rpm 8MB Cache 3Gb/s SATAII hard drive

Choose a mother board with the most universal socket that you can get then make sure it can run the most advanced CPU that is available the day you buy it. Motherboard first then CPU then RAM and Graphics card, then all the rest. Much of this will depend on your personal needs and wants choose components that fit them.

(no reason to pay for a 2nd pci-express slot, 8gb ram support, 2 extra sata ports, extra overclocking support, and 4 extra usb ports if you're not going to use them.) p.s.: you're going about your build properly. but if you plan on overclocking, you should get a p35 based mobo (not p31) and go with better ram (cl4 or faster from ocz, corsair, crucial, mushkin, etc.).

And I wanted to ask you, does it matter if the ram is eec or not eec or dont they have that anymore? So gigabyte is a good mobo? I heard asus makes the best mobos??
