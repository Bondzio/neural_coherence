i know the steps of trfansfering vhs tapes to my computer.
however, there are a few individuals in my life that don't have a clue or really want to get that involved and need something simplier.
i know there was a device a few years ago that allowed someone to copy a vhs tape to dvd that was not a regular dvd/vhs recorder.
this was portable and not much bigger than the actual vhs cassette.
has anyone heard of this or have info on it?
thanks
