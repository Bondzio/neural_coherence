Forget the Celeron and get the P4.
As for cooling, get whatever suits you as there are so many now but make it a copper core.
If you pick a large one, make sure you have room to install it as some are ridiculously large.
Check with &quot;modding&quot; websites for the best reviews, etc.
plus tips/hints on such OC'ing as well.
But, any OC'ing is hardly a plus now as you gain very little and place the cpu into a 100% constant stressful enviroment.
Cooling must be as reliable as you can make it.
