<s> Title is basically the question. </s>
<s> give the choice would it be more efficient to use four 256mb sticks in dual channel configuration or a single 1 gig in single channel? </s>
<s> all the sticks are 533mhz. </s>
<s> Thankyou for any replies. </s>
<s> I'd go with one 1GB stick. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Many motherboards lose the dual channel benefit if more than two matching slots are filled, so your question may be moot. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You will have to swap out a module(s) if you want more than 1GB total RAM, leaving you with unused (wasted?) </s>
<s> modules. </s>
<s> Add the second 1GB module when you have future upgrade funds. </s>
<s> i was leaning toward that decision anyway, i will have to check on the dual channel thing though. </s>
<s> i wasnt aware of the loss when four sticks are installed. </s>
<s> thanks for the imput </s>
<s> ....better to start off the amount of RAM you think you'll want upfront. </s>
<s> In other words, if you want 2GB and the system has the dual channel architecture, you'll want to get 2-1GB matching DIMMs. </s>
<s> Best to start by looking RAM recommended by the MB mfg. </s>
<s> Using one DIMM in a dual channel architecture system will suboptimize system performance. </s>

<s> I think the motherboard is the key. </s>
<s> I have a MSI RS482M2 motherboard and it says to install memory in pairs for duel channel. </s>
<s> I have 4 512mg modules for a total of 2048 mg and it is running duel channel. </s>
<s> This was just a deal on four sticks of 256 and im building a comp for a friend and tryin to save him money. </s>
<s> However, we would both like to spend a little more for dependability, and to save hassle in the future. </s>
<s> and from what it sounds like no one is getting night and day differences, even on online articles, between running four vs two and dual channel vs single, ECT. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>
<s> that meet your first statement??? </s>
<s> I've seen it with those fo six slots where the third pair reduces the speed, not disavbles Dual Channel. </s>
<s> I feel that your reply may be very misleading. </s>
<s> The double bandwidth that one gets from Dual Channel is far bwetter for those CPU's such as Intel P4's that can handle the extra bandwidth. </s>
<s> or of course 2 512's. </s>
<s> The 128 bit memory bus [2 64 bit busses read at the same time]for memory reads gives double the bandwidth, than the single channel 64 bit bus. </s>
<s> &quot;Many motherboards lose the dual channel benefit if more than two matching slots are filled, so your question may be moot.&quot; I meant that the dual channel benefit (not necessarily dual channel mode) may be lost if a slot or slots are used beyond the two matching slot minimum (one in each channel) for dual channel operation. </s>
<s> It has been my understanding that adding a third module to a typical four slot motherboard may eliminate dual channel mode if all modules have the same density. </s>
<s> Thus, the dual channel benefit is lost. </s>
<s> An example is if you populate the two slots of the channel A with 256MB modules (totaling 512MB), but only put a 256MB module in either slot of channel B. </s>
<s> In that case, channel A has a total of 512MB and channel B has a non matching total of 256MB. </s>
<s> Intel's explanation: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-011965.htm * * * * * Adding a fourth module to a dual channel capable motherboard may cause the memory to clock down in speed. </s>
<s> Dual channel mode is still realized, but the dual channel benefit is lost. </s>
<s> Dual channel bandwidth increase of up to 10% http://www.crucial.com/kb/answer.asp?qid=3751 - versus - Memory clock speed loss of more than 10% when slowing from 400MHz to 333MHz as a result of having all four slots populated. </s>
<s> While those percentages are not &quot;overall speed&quot; indicators, they do give an indication of something lost for something gained. </s>
<s> I figured I post it in this thread instead of making a new one. </s>
<s> I currently have two 512MB sticks( PC3200 ) in my system. </s>
<s> It's a P4. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade to 2GB of memory. </s>
<s> Any performace differences between having four 512 MB sticks vs two 1GB sticks? </s>
<s> Of course two 1GB sticks are more expensive, but my friend's computer uses the same type of memory so I'd figure I'd sell him my two 512MB sticks if I went that route to offset some the extra cost. </s>
<s> Of course if the two 1 GB sticks don't offer any benefit then I just get 2 extra 512 MB sticks. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The manual wouldn't tell me whether two 1 GB sticks are better than four 512 MB sticks. </s>
<s> That's why I'm posting. </s>
<s> Why would the motherboard make a differnce? </s>
<s> One way is either better than the other or they are the same. </s>
<s> Less sticks have always been more reliable. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Said sticks used to be right on the same memory bus. </s>
<s> The bus loading (capacitance mainly) would slow the memory access down and we would see a machine with all slots full cough and BSOD where the same machine with just the pair would do fine. </s>
<s> -&gt; Let's bottomline this. </s>
<s> With all the hardware variations out there and I didn't catch what motherboard this was, only a benchmark may reveal what difference the stick pairs, full load of sticks and such would be faster. </s>
<s> But even then we are only talking in the 2 and under percent range unless such disabled dual channel. </s>
<s> There is no gain to be found here for 99.99% of the machines. </s>
<s> There is also no way to research if such a test was done unless you reveal the full machine details. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> can make a big difference. </s>
<s> MBs can be sensitive to working at all with 4 DIMMs of the same density from the same mfg or working at the 'design speed' with all 4 DIMM slots populated. </s>
<s> I've seen two MBs personally where DDR400 drops from 400MHz to 333MHz when you go from 2 DIMMs to 4 DIMMs. </s>
<s> I decided the best approach for me (on an ASUS Socket 939 MB) was to use 2-1GB DIMMS vice 4-512MB DIMMs. </s>
<s> And as Bob indicated...assuming you get the both combinations working at the design speed ... say 4-512MBs @ DDR400 running at 400MHz and 2-1GB DIMMs at 400MHz, it will be difficult to 'see or notice' the difference without using a benchmark. </s>
<s> The trick for you will be getting the 4 DIMMs working at design speed in your system..that depends on the MB. </s>
<s> It wasn't so long ago when it was difficult to find a MB that would work at all with 4 DIMM slots populated. </s>
