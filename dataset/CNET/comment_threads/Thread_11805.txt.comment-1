Ok when I started my computer up it was fine but after 2 min.
it started up it crashed.
It rebooted and Norton GoBack said that it had encountered a problem and reestarted the computer so it could not crash.
It also said that if it dident reboot drive #1 would have crashed.
I tried everything to get back to my operating system Safe mode ( still rebotted)......
I tried to disable GoBack but it wouldent let me.
It always froze.
Can anyone help me fix my computer?
My Specs are: Windows XP SP2 ASUS P4C800 Intel P4 3.0 ATI All In Wonder 9800 pro Creative Sound Blaster Adigy 2 Platnuium If anyone would help me that would be great!
