<s> Since i have a low budget and I'm not even an extreme gamer, I just want to know - Is Nvidia Geforce 8400GS good for gaming (as compared to Nvidia Geforce 7300GT and Nvidia Geforce 7600) ? </s>
<s> Also ,Is 256 MB Video Memory (512 MB with the Nvidia TurboCache feature) sufficient to play the current generation games quite smoothly ? </s>
<s> My PC Config : Pc:- Lenovo 3000 series Q100 8822 11Q Intel Pentium 4 3.06 Ghz HT Intel 945G Chipset 2 GB DDR2-533 RAM Dual-Channel 80 Gb Hard Disk Windows XP Home </s>
<s> It's definitely off the bottom rung of those Intel GMA solutions and the other Nvidia 6150 but you will read less than glowing reports about speed on this DX10 capable chip. </s>
<s> However it's going to run games at &quot;reasonable&quot; settings and the drivers are not done yet so stay tuned for updates. </s>
<s> I'd take that one. </s>
<s> Sorry, to compare to the other cards find benchmarks and compare. </s>

<s> if you want to play current generation games smoothly at moderate settings, you'll need at least a 7600gt or 8600gt. </s>
<s> How much is the Dedicated Video Memory in Nvidia Geforce 8400 GS 256 MB ? </s>
<s> The chipset never determines this. </s>
<s> If you supply the make and model number of the card we might be able to look it up. </s>

<s> I want to know the Dedicated Vidoe Memory of these 2 cards - XFX Geforce 8400GS 256 MB supporting 512 MB Model(PV-T86S-WANG) and, XFX Geforce 8400GS 256 MB supporting 512 MB Model(PV-T86S-WAQG) </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The Nvidia Geforce 8400GS has 6.4 GB/sec Memory Bandwidth while Nvidia Geforce 8500GT has 12.8 Gb/sec Memory Bandwidth ,Does this difference in Memory Bandwidth reflect in the gaming performance since most of the PC games have size lower than 6.4 GB. </s>
<s> So, what's the use of these high Memory Bandwidths ? </s>
<s> While fun to know those numbers the real answer are the benchmarks. </s>
<s> Find a review on the cards you want and compare the benchmarks. </s>
