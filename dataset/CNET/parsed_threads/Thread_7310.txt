<s> I purchased a wireless G network card for my laptop to use on my vacation. </s>
<s> Then I got the bright Idea to get a wireless card for my desktop, just to see if I could get the laptop to talk to the desktop. </s>
<s> but after reading the info that came with the PCI card it seems I can not do that. </s>
<s> I did not try it yet and figure I would ask if it will work before I try it. </s>
<s> Now I have no wireless access point or router or anything on that line just 2 computers with wireless cards. </s>
<s> All I want to do is make sure the card in the Laptop will work while I am away. </s>
<s> Thanks Gene </s>
<s> To be able to connect to your desktop, you need a Hub/Switch or a router... if you want to go wireless, then you need an accesspoint, if you want to go online, you need to subscribe to an internet provider and a modem (dial-up, Broadband, Adsl, Satelite) </s>
<s> There are no hotspots anywhere near me and I just wanted to be sure the notebook card worked. </s>
<s> Quite a few of the Motels I am going to stay in next month have wireless access and I wanted it to work. </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> of the cards by switching from Infrastructure to Ad-Hoc mode. </s>
<s> If working, the two cards will see each other and the other PC in My Network Places (assuming ME,2K or XP). </s>
