ccaputo7 - how did you manage to return your oki printer.
i purchased oki5650 but the quality is poor so i want to return it and they said i can't because its my fault that i purchased that printer and that the problem is because i am using macintosh and adobe????
im not good at arguing so i just left it at that.
