hi folks.
i just got off the phone with a couple of dell technicians, and i was told that the reason that my network is bouncing is because of my belkin router.
so i have to go out and buy a new one.
here is my question for all of you.
now i have a belkin router that isn't going to be used.
is there a way to hook both up so that i can extend my wireless signal?
i know that's pretty silly to ask, but i am just trying to find something to do with the belkin.
thanks folks.
