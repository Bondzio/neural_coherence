the m7330n, which is going to be more than you need, it sounds like - pretty much any modern computer will take care of what you're looking to do.

whatever you end up with, either a) it'll work and you'll be happy, or b) something will go wrong and you'll be on the phone with support.
for what it worth, online hp support has been good.
you can chat online and they'll email you a transcript of the conversation in case you should forget anything that was mentioned.
