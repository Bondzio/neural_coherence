1.1.1	First off I would like to say this is not a power supply , BIOS , or bad connector problem .	St
1.1.2	The short version ... I had a hard drive start clicking last year , instead of backing up everything I shut the computer down .	St
1.1.3	After that I reboot and get an error primary 0 hard disk not found .	St
1.1.4	So I bought a new hard drive installed it works fine .	St
1.1.5	I tried setting up the clicking hard drive as a slave to get files I need .	St
1.1.6	All this did was give me an error primary 1 hard disk not found .	St
1.1.7	So after 4 hours of setting the working and non working hard drives as master/slave ... changing BIOS to auto detect/off ... and so on , I always get the clicking hard drive ... and no hard dick found .	St
1.1.8	So I thought if it could power the hard drive to make the clicking why would in not see the hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.9	Since the info is not critical to me and everything I have read says you have to have a & quot ; clean room & quot ; to open a hard drive , I would see what I could do to fix it .	St
1.1.10	I bought another hard drive swapped the platter from the old hard drive with the new one , all new head and such turn on PC ... same thing click , click , click .	St
1.1.11	So I downloaded Hard Drive Mechanic Software it also said no logical drive found .	St
1.1.12	So my question is how can the hard drive power up and start make a clicking noise and still say no hard drive found ?	Ques
1.1.13	Is there anything out there that can just read the platter from a hard drive outside of the case ?	Ques
1.1.14	How can the platter be causing the problem , I would have thought the actual moving components of the hard drive would have failed ?	Ques
1.1.15	Is there anything someone knows I can try other than the freezing thing ... I am just trying to get a few pictures it is not worth spending more than 50 bucks plus I have probably corrupted most of the data anyway .	St
1.2.1	http : //datacent.com/hard_drive_sounds.php I think it 's done for .	St
1.2.2	Do backups routinely .	St
1.2.3	Use redundant ( 3 ) methods of back up .	St
1.2.4	Maybe CD/DVD , second hard drive , USB , online , RAID , there are others .	St
1.2.5	http : //datacent.com/hard_drive_sounds.php http : //search.yahoo.com/search ? ei=utf-8 & fr=slv8-tyc7 & p=best % 20backup % 20methods & type= This thread untracked	St
1.3.1	It has a controller with firmware on it .	St
1.3.2	That 's what IDs the drive and it properties .	St
1.3.3	The controller could be good and the platters bad but the drive show in the BIOS just fine .	St
1.3.4	You ca n't expect to successfully replace the platters either .	St
1.3.5	In fact , removing the originals yourself is likely to reduce the probability that a drive recovery service can get your picture for you as well .	St
1.3.6	If the controller on the HD is bad , it 's sometimes possible to find an exact replacement and swap that part .	St
1.3.7	No opening of the shell is needed .	St
1.4.1	How do you find a new controller , what is the actual controllewr , and how is it replaced without opening up the shell ?	Ques
1.4.2	I know this is probably a lost cause but I am thinking maybe this can help me , or someone I know , out in the future .	St
1.4.3	And if the platter is bad is there any software that you know of that can search the hard drive with the read/write head or arm on its own without any assistance ?	Ques
1.5.1	I bought a new drive of the exact make , model and even lucked into the same PCB and FIRMWARE revisions .	St
1.5.2	It was a bargain for 129 bucks since data recovery was north of 600 .	St
1.5.3	I won !	St
