1.5.1	I have the HP Photosmart 8250 and have the that problem since day one with Vista , so it 's not just your model .	St
1.5.2	After many calls to HP I was told they have no plans on fixing the problem .	St
1.5.3	My neighbor bought a new HP computer and printer and it would n't print two sided , so it appears that HP has totally dropped double sided printing just as Bob said .	St
