and not just a network attached storage drive?
Why waste an XP license and a good piece of hardware if you just want access to files in shares.
A NAS that supports Windows SMB will do that quite well.
Remote administration is a minimal chore.
You need to turn it on/off, create/delete shares, add/remove users and do backups...not much more.
They don't need much in the way of resources and can be quite small.
