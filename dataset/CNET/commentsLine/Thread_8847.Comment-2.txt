i have a p4 630 3ghz and a leadtek 6800gs extreme pci-x.
i built the system about 2 months ago.
initially i had some noise problems with this setup.
my computer is in my bedroom so i wanted quiet.
first off the 6800gs is almost silent.
i looked at a number of cards from different makers and chose the leadtek because of reports that it was quiet.
i have to shine a flashlight at the fan to make sure its spinning.
the intel heatsink/fan is another story.
not only is it loud, it doesn't work well.
i was idleing at 48c with fan cranking.
i tried using arcric silver 5 and got the temps to 41c.
replaced it with a arctic cooler freezer pro 7 and realized that my 120mm case fans were really pretty quiet.
the high pitched fan noise disapeared with the hs/f and my temps idle at 31-33c and 45c under high load.
replaced stock case fans with aspire 120mm and now i can barely hear a humming.
