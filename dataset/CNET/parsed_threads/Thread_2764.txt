<s> I have a weird/funny problem with my Seagate 80 gb hard disk (non-sata). </s>
<s> Whenever I try to boot windows installed on it, I get the Windows Advanced Options screen (Start in Safe Mode, Safe Mode with command prompt etc.) </s>
<s> with the message that the system was not properly shut down. </s>
<s> Whatever I option I select, windows makes a bit of an effort to move forward, but then reboots and takes me back to the same Advanced Options screen. </s>
<s> To resolve this problem I decided to repair/format-and-reinstall windows when I noticed the strangest thing: my DVD-ROM wouldn't work as long as I attached this particular hard disk to the computer. </s>
<s> Any other hard disk and everything is fine. </s>
<s> The problem is not specific to my PC either; I tried the hard disk on computers of a couple of friends and it jammed their CD/DVD-ROMs in the same mysterious way. </s>
<s> This clearly is a hardware problem, but I cannot imagine what on earth could cause a hard disk to affect a DVD-ROM. </s>
<s> So if you have some insight into this, please help; not just because I want to retrieve some important data from the hard disk, but also because I badly want to know the reason behind such unique problem. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot in advance, The Impossible. </s>
<s> Here's the deal. </s>
<s> Not all IDE devices co-exist on the same cable. </s>
<s> Only those that maintain &quot;it should work&quot; will lose much time here. </s>
<s> As IDE jumper settings and cable type was not shared I suggest you research that first or just tell the forum what settings and IDE cable type you used. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Cable type, I will have to check; don't know much about it, but should be able to figure out the answer. </s>
<s> And hey, thanks a lot for the quick reply. </s>
<s> Is the 80 conductor IDE cable. </s>
<s> This has saved me so much time because the jumper settings are always the same (cable select.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 80-conductor IDE cable. </s>
<s> I am looking for for more details, if they are required. </s>
<s> I think mine is ATA66. </s>
<s> I am also trying to figure out what do 100 and 133 mean in ATA66/100/133. </s>
<s> The settings I use is Cable Select. </s>
<s> As to ATA speeds you can google that quick enough for full explainers that you can pick the one you like. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Including all Bob offered, and what you've discovered on the HD causing problems. </s>
<s> I suggest you find an adapter or ext. </s>
<s> HD that accepts IDE connection to attach to the USB port. </s>
<s> That way, you can access you data and retrieve it. </s>
<s> There really isn't any repair here for the HD, the electronics are hosed and its better simple to swap out. </s>
<s> Since, its an 80gb'er it just shown its age and if you like to play with it, but once your data is retrieved, pitch it. </s>
<s> Of course, I hope the adapter or ext. </s>
<s> USB case will work with that HD. </s>
<s> Also, mark it as to its problem if you keep it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
