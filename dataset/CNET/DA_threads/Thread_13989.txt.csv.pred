1.2.1	The network neighbourhood or NN isn't supposed to do that.	St
1.2.2	I won't duplicate web content as to why but don't count on this to work as you expected.	St
1.2.3	Next, use NET USE at a command prompt instead.	St
1.2.4	&quot;also i cannot connect internet&quot; Well that's another issue on it's own.	St
1.2.5	Your TOPIC is the NN so I'll stop here since you left out any details that I could use to help with the internet issue.	St
