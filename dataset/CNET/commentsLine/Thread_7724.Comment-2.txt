&quot;win98 was installed with this drive so i know it worked.&quot; you may have left out part of the story.
was this install recent?
if so, did you install some os other than what came with the laptop?
if so, you then have to install what motherboard or ide drivers this laptop requires.
this is true for desktops as well, but in laptops, they usually supply a restore cd that does it all for you.
when a person installs the windows os from microsoft, they learn about drivers... other items are: - set the ide controller to both in device manager - no cdrom items are allowed in config.sys or the cdrom will vanish.
- test the cdrom with a bootable cd or with a combo of boot diskette and cd.
