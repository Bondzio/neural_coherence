<s> I have just installed my first hard drive and the hardware installation was smooth. </s>
<s> Now I have a problem with the partition of the hard drive. </s>
<s> I don't understand what it means to partition the HD, and most importantly, how much to partition it. </s>
<s> I have a Western Digital 160GB EIDE . </s>
<s> I understand that I won't get all that 160GB, but I want to get the most out of it using NTFS because I read that it is more secure than FAT. </s>
<s> My computer specs are 900 Mhz, 512RAM, Western Digital 160GB EIDE Please explain what partitioning the hard drive is in lamest terms and please explain how many sections should I partition it into as well as any recommendations. </s>
<s> Thank you so much . </s>
<s> Partitioning is simply carving out a space for data storage. </s>
<s> You have to partition and then format a drive before you can use it. </s>
<s> If you're installing a version of XP with service pack 2 you can create one partition for the entire drive. </s>
<s> Use the XP installation disc to do this and format with NTFS file system. </s>
<s> Yes I'm installing XP with SP2...So I should just go ahead and create one partition for the hard drive and that's it huh? </s>
<s> Yes I will install windows XP with SP2 So all I need to do is partition the hard drive in one size and I won't run into any problems down the road in the future? </s>
<s> Be sure to backup any files you can't live without on a regular basis. </s>
<s> For example, if you have numerous pictures and music files you'll want to copy them to some kind of removable media such as CD-R, DVD-R or Thumb Drive and store them in a safe place. </s>
