and in fact it has done so, if i read your post correctly.
so something is wrong.
i assume you didn't do something yourself since it last worked (like reinstalling windows xp).
try to find it like this: 1. try this sandisk device in any other pc.
if doesn't work there either, it's broken or needs to be formatted or something like that.
2. try any other usb device to see if it works on your pc.
if not, something is wrong with your usb.
3. try another stick on your pc.
hope this helps.
