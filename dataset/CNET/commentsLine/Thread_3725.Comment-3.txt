i have ran lexmark printers for a number of years and have had great results and yes the ink levels are accurate as with all other printers that have this tool.
i have had the best results with lexmark printers so much so that it is the main one that i recommend to my family and friends and we use them at work as well.
with this being said lexmark also has the best tech support as well in my opinion.
i use to run canon printers and they were not up to par.
