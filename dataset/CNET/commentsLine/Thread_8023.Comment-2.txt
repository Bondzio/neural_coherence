since i can save the state of the &quot;box&quot; i think it's an excellent solution.
and here's a trick i use and want to share.
let's say i want to use another machine.
i copy my virtual box file over to that other machine and launch that virtual box machine without having to reinstall the windows in that virtual box.
it's pretty amazing stuff.
