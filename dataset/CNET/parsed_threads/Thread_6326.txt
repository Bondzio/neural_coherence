<s> Im looking for the knowledge of cache system organization on I7 processors. </s>
<s> If anybody can help me I should like to know: The type of organization of the different levels of cache, i.e., if they are associative, direct mapped or N set associative. </s>
<s> The answer in clock cycles of a Cache reading. </s>
<s> I suppose that level 1 will be read in 1 clock cycle. </s>
<s> And what about cache Level 2 and Level 3? </s>
<s> Is the memory interface which generates the Wait State if there is a cache miss on Level 1 or is Level 1 by itself? </s>
<s> Are the different levels of cache inclusive or exclusive? </s>
<s> The policy of writing is Write through or write back? </s>
<s> You'll want to collect the related documents listed in http://download.intel.com/design/processor/specupdt/320767.pdf </s>
<s> I thank you for your sugestion, but I couldn't find any topic related to what I'm looking for. </s>
<s> Just break down and call Intel and ask for them to tell you exactly which document you need. </s>
