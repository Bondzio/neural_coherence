1.1.1	I am new to Mac computers, I am used to pcs.	St
1.1.2	My daughter gave me an old Ibook from 2001 that has an airport card in it.	St
1.1.3	It uses 802.11b wireless.	St
1.1.4	I would like to upgrade it to 802.11g wireless.	St
1.1.5	Is this possible?	St
1.1.6	If so, do I need to buy the expensive Apple airport card or is there another brand I can use?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks for any info.	Polite
1.2.1	Get the Apple card and be happy it just works without much ado.	St
1.2.2	Try another card and if it glitches, then you get to sort it out.	St
1.2.3	The other makers just don't get it about Mac support so that's my advice since you have an Apple.	St
1.2.4	Consider that with the older iBook you may not realize any big gain in speed.	St
1.2.5	Then again... Bob	St
1.3.1	That iBook will only take the Airport .11b (original) card and does not have the physical connections, or space, for the .11g Airport card.	St
1.3.2	There are a number of USB Wireless adapters out there but, as Bob pointed out, their performance can be a little short of steller.	St
1.3.3	I don't think that any major speed gain would be made by spending extra cash on an external Wireless card for this device.	St
1.3.4	I think you will find the speed adequate for normal web surfing and email P	St
1.4.1	A PC-CARD slot is needed for any 802.11g card I've found.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Unfortunately, the iBook does not sport a PC card slot so if there is any upgrading to do it would have to be via the USB connector.	St
1.5.2	Here are three I found just now.	St
1.5.3	I have not done any research as to their compatibility with OS X or OS 9 , but the devices do exist.	St
1.5.4	http://www.netgear.com/products/details/WG111.php http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=36&prid=668 http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=36&prid=665 Given that the iBook is USB 1.0, the speed gain would be negligible.	St
1.5.5	P	St
1.6.1	USB 1 is 11 megabit, and 802.11b about the same.	St
1.6.2	The pipe is full.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Yes, they did mention on one site that you would see greater speed increases with USB 2.0 but did not say why.	St
1.7.2	Sneaky!	St
1.7.3	P	St
