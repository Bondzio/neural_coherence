i have a similar problem to the original post in this thread.
i have a dell xps 400, purchased oct. 05 with 2 memory cards, 512mb each, in dimm1 and dimm 3.
[xp 2000, ultrasmart monitor, nvidia geforce 6800, 32bit os] today, i installed 2 pny ddr2-667-533-400 memory sticks in dimm 2 and dimm3.
total memory after installation: 3 gigs.
[3,0024 mb] i reconnected all cables and booted up.
the computer sounded an &quot;alarm&quot; sound: 2 &quot;beeps&quot;, pause, 2 &quot;beeps&quot;, pause, 2 &quot;beeps&quot;.
the monitor powered up, but no image.
i pushed the status buttons on the bottom of the monitor and received a prompt message saying: no input signal detected&quot;---- or words to that effect, or a message that says: &quot;in power saving mode.
move mouse or hit any key to activate.&quot; moving the mouse or hitting any key does nothing.
the computer sounds like it is functioning as normal, except for the alarm beeps at the beginning of the boot.
i removed the pny sticks and rebooted.
same problem: 6 alarm sounds and no monitor input.
i've listened closely to the alarm sounds, and they appear to be coming from the usb ports in the back [5 in back...2 in front], but i can't confirm that.
further research indicates that what i am hearing are &quot;bios alarm codes&quot;.
i've double checked and re-checked all my hook-ups.
the monitor cable is correct.
all peripherial cables are in usb ports correctly.
any advice or insight to my problem will be greatly appreciated.
thanks!
