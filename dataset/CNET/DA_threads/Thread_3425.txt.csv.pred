1.1.1	I'm having a problem receiving more than a 54mbps feed from the DIR625 on my Toshiba A210-JA3 laptop.	St
1.1.2	The Atheros card seems to top out at 54mbps on the feed (excellent signal), compared to the D-Link USB adapter (hockey puck) that pulls in a constant 300mbps (very good signal) in the same location.	St
1.1.3	Limited interference (moved the baby monitor, microwave rarely operational); so that isn't a factor.	St
1.1.4	I've downloaded the most recent Atheros drivers from the Toshiba site but the Atheros card only will work when the DIR-625 is set to mixed G/N mode, and then only picks up the router as a G. The D-Link adapter on the Lenovo 3000 desktop works regardless of the mode.	St
1.1.5	Is there something I might be missing on the D-Link end?	St
1.1.6	I've checked for updates online and nothing pops out.	St
1.1.7	I'd love to get the laptop working at 300mbps as I run the entire house wirelessly based on the strange location of our cable modem (Motorola on Shaw Cable).	St
1.1.8	The modem is fine (just swapped in last Friday) so I've eliminated that as a potential problem.	St
1.2.1	You have both companies to make this call to.	St
1.2.2	Make sure nothing is &quot;Pre-N&quot;.	St
