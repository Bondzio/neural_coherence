i took the monitor and my laptop in to the local store where i purchased the monitor, and one of the guys there did say that there had been issues with this particular monitor and some video cards.
apparently systems with some ati cards have the same problem that i had.
i just returned the acer and tested, then purchased, a viewsonic instead.
thanks for your input, samkh.
