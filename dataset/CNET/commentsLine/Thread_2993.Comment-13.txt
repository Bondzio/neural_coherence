the fix-it method on a pc is swap parts.
a pc fix-it shop would just reach up on the shelf and grab a spare gpu.
if no go.....they would grab a spare psu......etc.etc.
that's not a luxury most home users have.
your left with best guess.......which can get expensive.
while you were in the machine did you verify that all the heat sinks were nice an clean?
all the fans were working?
maybe take a moment to reseat all the plugs?
shipping the machine can get kind of brutal on the innards.
