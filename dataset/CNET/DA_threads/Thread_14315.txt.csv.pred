1.1.2	Currently running Windows 7.	St
1.1.3	Message said couldn't find the drivers, does anyone have an idea where I can find the drivers or how to fix the problem.	Ques
1.1.4	Thank you in advance for your assistance.	St

1.3.1	I can tell you that most external hard drives that are USB will be recognized by Windows 7.	St
1.3.2	I have an old SimpleTech external harddrive (100 Gig - Yes that old, it was huge when I bought it) and it is still recognized by my Gateway windows 7 computer bought about a year and half ago to replace the PC my wife was using.	St
1.3.3	You can try the SimpleTech site but most USB hardware either holds its own basic drivers in a bit of flash memory the system treats like a usb stick or windows has them itself.	St
