The HP has a faster and cooler runnign processor, a faster hard drive with more than twice the capacity, a better sound card, built-in HDTV tuner and record, but a weaker video card.
The 8600GT can struggle in games unless you're willing to turn down the resolution and the effects/detail level.
To make the HP a good gamer, you'd need to upgrade to at least a 9600GT and replace its 350W power supply with a 450+W unit.
