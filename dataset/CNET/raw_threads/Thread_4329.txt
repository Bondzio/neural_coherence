It's for a new desktop, and the phone line with DSL coming out of it is pretty far around the house, lots of walls in the middle. If I was going to run a cable, I'd need 200+ ft of cable (I think, very rough estimate). I know that the general creed is that a hardwire is always stronger than wifi, but at that kind of distance, would the latency in transferring signal over that much wiring justify wifi to just save the time? I'd get pretty good reception, I already have wifi running for an Xbox360 in that room.

Max distance for cat 5 cable is 100m, so you still have 100ft or so to play with on top of the 200ft you are planning. If you aren't concerned with latency, than wireless is by far the easier solution.
