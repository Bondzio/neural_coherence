hello, i am an aspiring pc builder, and after much researh i have come upon many questions.
i guess my main question is this: should i wait until vista and direct x 10 come out before i build my first system?
will the new top of the line cards like the ati 1900 512 mb be direct x 10 ready, or will a whole new set of cards come out just for dx 10?
thanks you.
