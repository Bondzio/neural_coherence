<s> Hi, I'm about to buy a new LCD monitor for my father. </s>
<s> He's 60 years old and his eyes aren't quite as sharp as they used to be. </s>
<s> He currently uses a 17&quot; samsung CRT monitor at 1024x768 with the font size set to large (not extra large) in the WinXP appearance settings. </s>
<s> He finds this comfortable - the text is large enough for him to read. </s>
<s> I want to buy him a larger LCD monitor now. </s>
<s> What Screen size / resolution should I go for so that he'll find it just as comfortable, but will have more screen space? </s>
<s> My budget is around $200, definitely not more that $250. </s>
<s> you'll find that LCDs have a native resolution which provides the best image quality and that changing to another resolution degrades the image. </s>
<s> My 19&quot; has a native resolution of 1280 X 1024 and resolutions for larger monitors go even higher. </s>
<s> This means the icon and text sizes may not get larger just because the screen is larger. </s>
<s> As well, most come as &quot;wides-screen&quot; but you can still find a few with the old traditional aspect ratio. </s>
<s> In any event, you'll need to adjust settings with a newer monitor anyway but don't mess with the native resolution. </s>
<s> I remember my first experience with LCD monitor. </s>
<s> I though they were awfully bright but I am use to it now. </s>
<s> I am thinking if a led-lcd monitor would be nicer because the contrast ratio is so much higher (more like an crt monitor). </s>
<s> I see in todays' Fry's, a 24&quot; Viewsonic (1080P, 2ms) for $190; with taxes and waste disposal thing, it will probably be slightly under $250 </s>
