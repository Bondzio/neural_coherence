I recently got an IDE HDD back that I lent to my mate a while back, and have bought an external case for it from eBay. I put it in the case, plugged it in correctly, and it wouldn't recognise. Trying to fix this, I took out the drive and connected it directly to my PC via a SATA cable. I reformatted the drive and created a single volume on it. I put the drive back into the case, and it still won't recognise... [I am sure there's power getting to the drive.] Any help // suggestions?
