<s> Hi...I'm a noob when it comes to PC building, so I've purchased an old (2005) Compaq Presario SR1300AN with an ASUS A7V8X-LA motherboard. </s>
<s> I'm just planning to tinker with it (add an AGP graphics card, wireless card etc) and get some experience. </s>
<s> It currently has a 40gb, 5400 rpm IDE hard drive which I'd like to replace with a Western Digital Caviar 3.5&quot; hard drive SE EIDE 7200RPM 8MB (320gb). </s>
<s> My question is: will this mobo/machine accept this drive? </s>
<s> Will the BIOS be modern enough to deal with this drive? </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance for an advice you guys can offer. </s>
<s> That machine comes from an era when the hardware/software makers were adapting to the big HD's. </s>
<s> Perhaps it's best to get the bios level you have and call H.P..........have a chat. </s>
<s> Be aware there were storage limits at the bios level and also the OS level. </s>
<s> Many thanks for that. </s>
<s> How do I go about checking the BIOS level? </s>
<s> http://www.48bitlba.com/ has it and a lot of other information. </s>
<s> Thanks very much for that link </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It's running XP (SP2) </s>
