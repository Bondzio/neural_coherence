<s> hello, I have mixed up a bunch of PII CPU's on my table here and I don't know which is which. </s>
<s> How can I tell which is a 233 and which is a 650? </s>
<s> doesn't say anywhere. </s>
<s> just a long string of numbers. </s>
<s> also, if I put a 650 PII in a mobo that will only go up to 450 on a PII (550 on a PIII), what will happen? </s>
<s> thanks - fj </s>
<s> If I remember correctly, I think P2 only up to 450mhz. </s>
<s> or 500mhz but definitely not 650mhz. </s>
<s> If you set the jumper incorrectly (speed set too high), then the cpu just won't work; no damage done. </s>
<s> Of course if you set the speed lower then the actual, then it will work at that lower speed. </s>
<s> &quot;just a long string of numbers.&quot; Intel has a database to match such up. </s>
<s> Too bad you didn't supply at least two of those so we could have tried it and showed how we determined what was what. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> It's Intel.com... </s>
