thanks for the quick reply.
i haven't used an amd processor since i built a 486!.
i've used intels since then, so i am unaware of &quot;that amd burnout problem&quot;.
so the heat builds up so fast that it will power down in one second?
would that explain why the t-bird powered down after 5 seconds repeatedly, but the athlon-xp only runs for one second.
more power / heat in the xp?
do you think there is contact between the aluminum heat sink and the actual chip face when there is no transfer tape?
i see four rubber pads that might keep the two faces apart.
