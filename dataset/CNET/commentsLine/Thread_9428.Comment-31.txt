it's a sure bet that when the &quot;next&quot; thing gets here, there will be another &quot;next&quot; thing in the wings.
the price of the current stuff will go down and the price of the next thing will be about the same.
so you can drive yourself crazy waiting for prices to go down.
i'm generally a big fan of waiting to upgrade only when there's a clear reason; however, i am sure you don't realize how slow your 677mhz system is.
take a deep breath and shop around for the best price and find out how much fun a p4 running xp can be.
