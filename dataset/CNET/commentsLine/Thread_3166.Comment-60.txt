i certainly wouldn't trust one that long, although i've had a simpletech 160g for about 3 years.
i bought a seagate 500 about 18 months ago, and it crashed big time when i pulled it off a cardboard box onto a carpeted floor by snagging the chord.
i hoped it would be more rugged.
the point is accidents, happen and lost pictures are a real heartache.
get another and have redundant backups, since it can take 2 or 3 weeks to replace your computer when it fails.
also, you may find you travel with you usb so you can share pictures.
btw, a passport usb requires a very short cable on some laptops because of the limited power supplied thru the usb port.
