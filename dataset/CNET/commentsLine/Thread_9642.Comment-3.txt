think of ram as your computers gas tank, and the processor is the engine.
if you use editing programs for pics and whatnot, this requires a big gas tank, as they are the most memory hogging programs most people use.
if you have windows xp i would suggest getting 2 to 3 gigs of ram for the best performance, if vista, get 4 to 5 gigs, and remember you can only use ram that your motherboard supports, i.e.
the ram sped you already have, and you also, if getting more than 1 stick of ram have to use the same ram, example: if you have a stick of 1gig ram at 533mhz and want more, only put in another stick exactly the same...and you will notce improvement, yes, 1 gig for xp is not enough for video and stills editing.
hope that helps.
