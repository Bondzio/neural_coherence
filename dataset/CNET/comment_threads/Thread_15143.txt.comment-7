I have a Viewsonic 22&quot; widescreen multimedia LCD with a 7600GS graphics card and the games look and run very good with that combination.
As far as response time I could not see any difference with the 5ms response on the Viewsonic and the 2ms on the Samsung that I used for 2 weeks while the Viewsonic was being delevered.
I set the resolution at 1680 X 1050 and it looks great in very day use and also games.
The only thing I will be doing to improve gaming is installing a bigger power supply and a better, newer graphics card as that seems to be the key with the newer direct 10X games
