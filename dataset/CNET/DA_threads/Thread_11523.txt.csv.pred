1.1.1	I'm getting ready to build a computer and was wondering if a mobo with a SiS chipset, specifically SiS 648 chipset, work with an ATI 9600 video card?	St
1.1.2	It seems I remember reading that SiS chipsets don't &quot;play well&quot; with AGP cards.	St
1.1.3	Thanks for any input.	St

1.2.1	The problem I see here is that even if the chipset has been known to work, will your motherboard with said chipset work.	St
1.2.2	You can help the forum help you by supplying the make/model of this board.	Ques
1.2.3	Be sure you don't have other issues such as a tiny power supply which doesn't have an extra 30 or so Watts for the new card.	St
