answered your own question with the specs you have listed.
Some other suggestions, The Ram should be DDR2 and an 256MB video card.
a PCI-E slot be available for future video upgrades.
As for the Manf.
I can't help on that one as I have been building my own for years.
I would go with A PC for gaming.
