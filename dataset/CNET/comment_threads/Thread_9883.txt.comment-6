For me, my &quot;work&quot; fits well on a single 1 dollar DVDRW disk.
Why not the cheap solution?
A single USB hard disk fails so many points in what we have defined backtup to be over the years that it's not a valid backup.
Nice fast copy but it fails the definition and will likely fail your written goals.
-&gt; Let's move to the dollar solution?
