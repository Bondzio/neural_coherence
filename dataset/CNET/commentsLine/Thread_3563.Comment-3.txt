im not wanting to do a whole lot, i do watch movies and tv shows on my comp and would like to hook it up to my 24&quot; tv as well ive just been looking at the graphics card and it just seems old, i have just started getting into computers lately and just not up to date on what everything can do.
just didnt know if the graphics card would hold up windows 7 x64 bit and not be laggy or anything.
ya the hdd is a little small i will def.
end up getting a new one pretty soon to add to that one and have 2 externals so i am good for storage for now.
im mainly wanting to dual/triple boot os x, windows 7, and linux (idk which one yet) i dont do a whole lot of gaming as of now, but i think with the new system i will start to for sure.
just not sure how stable my graphics card is.
thanks for the feedback, appreciate it.
