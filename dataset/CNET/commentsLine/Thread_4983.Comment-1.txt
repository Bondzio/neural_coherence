i'm using an iomega 80gb hdd external hard drive for backup.
it's attached to a pc running windows xp.
when it gets full it the backups don't work, and deleting items just sends them to a recycle bin which i can't find an icon for.
occasionally i'll get a message to the effect that the disk is full, and do i want to empty the recycle bin?
and that frees up enough space to continue the backups.
how do i access the recycle bin without waiting for the 'disk full' message?
if it makes a difference, i just switched from using iomega's software to attaching the drive as a plug'n'play.
