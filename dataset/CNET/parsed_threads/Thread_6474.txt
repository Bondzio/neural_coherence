<s> I have set a Wi-Fi network with a Desktop PC and a Laptop. </s>
<s> Both running on XP. </s>
<s> I have a printer connected to the Laptop and need to be able to print on it from the Desktop PC. </s>
<s> Both computers are on and running. </s>
<s> When I try to go through the Add a Printer Wizard it goes as far as recognizing the printer connected to the Laptop. </s>
<s> It gives me the name of the laptop and the name of the printer. </s>
<s> So I choose it and click on it. </s>
<s> This is where I hit a stumbling block. </s>
<s> A frame comes on that tells me is connecting to &quot;name of the Laptop&quot; and asks for a User Name and a Password. </s>
<s> I have tried the User Name and Password for the Laptop; it simply tells me Access denied. </s>
<s> I have tried as Administrator. </s>
<s> I have tried too the User Name and Password of the PC. </s>
<s> All instances same result. </s>
<s> I made sure the share a printer on the laptop printer is enabled. </s>
<s> Any suggestions to solve this problem will be appreciated. </s>

<s> The printer is shared with Full Control? </s>
<s> Go to the printer properties. </s>
<s> Add the Everyone group on the Security tab. </s>
<s> This should give access to the printer to umm everyone. </s>
<s> Setting up the printer... Go thru network places&gt;entire network&gt;microsoft networks&gt;your desktop machine name&gt;your printer share name. </s>
<s> Double-click the printer share and it should ask you if you want to install the printer. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> would let you hang the printer on the network rather than on the laptop. </s>
<s> You would then be able to print from either computer withhout the other one being on. </s>

<s> I tried the permissions route but for some reason although it recognized the desktop PC it would not let it print. </s>
<s> Any way, after dickering with it for some days I accessed HP, the printer manufacturer, and presented the problem. </s>
<s> They directed me to download an specific wizard for that printer which I saved on a CD and ran on the Desktop PC. </s>
<s> It worked perfectly and now I can access printers back and forth between both computers. </s>
<s> Thanks for the input and help. </s>

<s> At the present time I could not get a wireless printer card. </s>
<s> Although I had though of that route to follow. </s>
<s> I probably will follow your suggestion in the not too distant future, as soon as I can do it. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help and assist. </s>
