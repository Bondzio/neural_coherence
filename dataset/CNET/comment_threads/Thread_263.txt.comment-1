I'm planning a trip to Asia in the near future and am looking for a tablet to use only for reading.
I need something that has a back light for low-light reading and I need something that has minimal glare for high-light environments.
I've considered the Kindle Paperwhite, but I have no hands-on experience with it.
I have an iPad that I use for other activities... this new device is only intended for reading.
Aside from the visibility factor, weight is also a concern.
Anyone have recommendations?
Thanks!
