Those Flash games aren't so demanding.
Some remarks: - the screen size of a netbook is quite small - 600 x 800 pixels at most - this may be a limiting factor for some games - the small keyboard might be right for small 9-years hands - playing games often needs a mouse - the touchpad of an average laptop isn't nice for that; so preferably you use it sitting at a desk, and then you don't need a notebook or laptop so much - netbooks, like all laptops, have a rather limited lifetime and expensive batteries A cheap desktop MIGHT be a better solution.
YOUR choice, depending on YOUR situation.
