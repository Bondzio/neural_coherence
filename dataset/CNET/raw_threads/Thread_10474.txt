So what I want to know is will the duplicator I am looking at (Startech.com USB to IDE SATA Standalone Hard Drive Duplicator http://www.rakuten.com/prod/startech-com-usb-to-ide-sata-standalone-hard-drive-duplicator-dock/213024954.html ) duplicate my hardrive to another hardrive, then let me plug in the new hardrive and have it run like nothing ever happened. That would mean duplicating the operating system and all other programs. Help appreciated.

I do a system backup to an external hard drive, install the new drive, restore from the external hard drive; and it's always worked for me. This gives you the added protection of an external backup you can use to retrieve any of your files if needed.

I'd go for a software solution as it has more flexibility in terms of backup/imaging and there's no warranty to expire or duplicator parts to lose. Must be a fairly new product as it's the first time I've seen it.....and didn't find an reviews on Newegg either. I use ACRONIS True Image as it will duplicate a drive as well as create images of it as is now or next week or the week after. VAPCMD
