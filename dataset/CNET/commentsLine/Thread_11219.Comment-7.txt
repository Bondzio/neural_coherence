it is the same as the location for a business.
if you do treasure or need your data to be safe you will need to make three backups.
external drives are not that expensive.
you are correct that it will cost close to $300, is the data you have worth that.
i have a minimun of three backups of everything i considered important.
check out the seagate drives at newegg and ask how bad you might need that data some day.
remember to treat these drives as if they are your new born child.
