<s> Hello, I am new to this forum, and building computers. </s>
<s> I just finished my first build, and there is no picture, the fans just whirr and the motherboard LED lights. </s>
<s> Here are my specs: Mobo: ASUS M5A78L-MX CPU: AMD Athlon II X3 3.3GHZ Case: CiT Recon mATX case RAM: Kingston ValueRAM 2GB DDR3 1333MHZ HDD: WD1200JB 120GB 7.2k RPM (this is rescued from an old DELL Dimension PC and fitted with an IDE to SATA adapter. </s>
<s> Everything apart from the HDD is new. </s>
<s> I am using the integrated ATI Radeon 3000. </s>
<s> They can be returned within 14 days as they are from Amazon (.co.uk) and Ebuyer. </s>
<s> I have tried removing the SATA for HDD. </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> I removed the RAM and HDD. </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> I reformatted the HDD in the old Dell. </s>
<s> If I get the build working, it should display the No OS detected BIOS message, like it did in the DELL. </s>
<s> I will try any other suggestions. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Remove all drives or disconnect entirely. </s>
<s> Now boot and if no display, then something remains either faulty or badly configured. </s>
<s> Test the monitor on another PC, does it work? </s>
<s> You can try the reset the bios to defaults, bu using the &quot;clearing pins&quot;, thus review the manual for what it takes to do this. </s>
<s> If the monitor still doesn't display, then the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is somehow bad or some incompatibility exists. </s>
<s> be 100% sure, no shorts or contacts on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> are present on its backside, check!!! </s>
<s> Alas, be 100% sure that the cpu is supported, if the manual states it is, maybe you need a bios update to fully support to the level it needs in order to do so. </s>
<s> It all this takes too long, return the mtrbd. </s>
<s> for replacement or try yet a different one. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> One thing to first check is that the monitor is plugged in on the MOBO. </s>
<s> The monitor should be on first displaying the no signal fault, then turn on the PC. </s>
<s> If the no sig goes away but remains blank, the video BIOS is not starting. </s>
<s> A rest needs to be initiated. </s>
<s> If still no dispaly, pull all the parts from the case and assemble them onan anti-static surface and connect it up just like in the case. </s>
<s> If things start working, you've got a grounded (stand-off) mounting point. </s>
<s> I like to use plastic or nylon standoffs unless specified to be grounded in the user manual. </s>
<s> Sometimes this leads to intermittent shorts as the MOBO gets warm and grows a little. </s>
<s> I have tried all that, and tried it with an identical working motherboard, but no luck. </s>
<s> The CPU is supported, and I don't think a BIOS update is required, but how do I update that anyway without it booting? </s>
<s> It was a bizarre case where a new CPU would only function if the BIOS was up to date. </s>
<s> I had to install an older CPU, update the BIOS then it was ready for the new CPU. </s>
<s> Lucky for me I had a computer shop for this. </s>
<s> Most folk will have to return products in such condition. </s>

<s> Try to replace or upgrade your power supply ( SMPS ) by a reputed brand . </s>
<s> You did not mention the brand and spec of your SMPS </s>
