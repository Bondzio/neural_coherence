<s> I would like to get a Samsung SATA 18XDVD+R DVD Burner w/12X DVD-RAM Write and Lightscribe. </s>
<s> I have a 4 yr old PC AMD and would like to know if a SATA is compatible or should I use a IDE? </s>
<s> I use XP Windows. </s>
<s> I have added additonal RAM card earlier, have lots of RAM. </s>
<s> I think the card was a IDE. </s>
<s> I never had a DVD player in this yet but there is an update slot and connections for one. </s>
<s> I understand this is an OEM plug and play and looks easy to install for this novice on DVD's. </s>
<s> I also have the Nero burning program already I use with my CD burner, will that be compatible with a DVD player like this. </s>
<s> Thank you for any help. </s>

<s> Some older motherboards do not have a SATA port. </s>
<s> Just get the IDE and it will plug and play. </s>
<s> Nero? </s>
<s> Only if it is equipped to burn DVDs, only you can answer this. </s>
<s> And you will need DVD player software. </s>
<s> If you're running Windows Media Player, visit my site below and go to the free software link. </s>
<s> Download and run the Windows Media Player DVD Helper. </s>
<s> It will install the codecs that WMP needs to play DVDs. </s>

<s> 5 dB hot. </s>
<s> Just my opinion but after watching hundreds struggle to get SATA support into their XP OS I'm going to pan SATA here and suggest you get the old PATA version. </s>
<s> That will work with just one thing to do. </s>
<s> Set the jumper according to the rules. </s>

<s> I'll stick with the IDE or PATA version just to be sure. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I have another problem, but am posting that in a new thread. </s>
