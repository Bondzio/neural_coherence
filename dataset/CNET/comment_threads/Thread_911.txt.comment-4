If the OSX is dates it can't see the NTFS (file system) and files.
Current versions can see NTFS volumes just fine.
There is also other solutions like having a friend with a PC copy then out to DVD or another HDD.
I've used Linux (Ubuntu to be specific) to connect 2 HDDs, one in NTFS and the other in AFS and drag the files over.
MacFUSE is worth some research if your OSX is outdated.
