i agree with rockyjohns in that you could get a better gaming rig then trying a package from any on-line store.
you first have to decide on which processor will give the best power for the game or games you wish to play.
i have read that an intel core i3 processor will play the most intensive games currently available in conjunction with a good gpu card.
i have found that watching a great number of &quot; building a gaming pc &quot; videos on youtube were very helpful.
good luck on your build.
p.s.
most web site have a disclaimer that states the bundled components may not be compatable with each other.
