Hi Everyone Can anyone tell me when installing a hard drive I usually put the jumper to Master or Slave but there is normally another option called &quot;CS&quot; What does this stand for &quot;Cabke Select&quot; or something else and when would you use this jumper position.
Kindest Regards Tony B.
