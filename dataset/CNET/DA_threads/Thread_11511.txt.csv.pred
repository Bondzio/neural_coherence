1.3.1	Lots of options ... might just make it easy and get a basic Dell ... .just make sure you have enough RAM ... at least 512MBs ( 1 GB if you get oboard video ) , enough disk space ... 100 GBs , a 19 ' monitor , and a CD-DVD Reader writer ... .you could get the el cheapo CD-ROM drive from Dell and get a CD-DVD writer of your choice from Newegg or elsewhere .	St
1.3.2	As far as the software is concerned ... unless you absolutely positively need the real deal , just use OpenOffice 2.0 .	St
