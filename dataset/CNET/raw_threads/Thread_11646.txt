After setting up all the rj45 wall sockets, I connected them to a small switch and then the adsl router/modem. Thats where my nightmare begun. The desktops shows no sign when connected to the rj45 wall sockets but can connect when directly hooked up to the switch. I have tried redoing the wiring on the rj45 wall sockets but it doesn't help. This thing is driving me nuts. Help me out guys before I loose my mind over this Cheers

I used the brown, brown white, yellow, blue white, blue, yellow white, green, green white scheme. Hope that is informative enough.

On the RJ45 sockets, all should be fine if you followed the color codes printed on the connector. However, at the other end you have RJ45 plugs and these are easier to mess up. The color order for 586A is as follows: Green/White-Green, Orange/White-Blue, Blue/White-Orange, Brown/White-Brown. There is no Yellow in the cable! Flatten out the cable in that order. The RJ45 Plug clip must be facing down. Push the cables in and crimp. Do one cable and then test. Let us know how you get on P

Generally, I use and see most often is the &quot;B&quot; scheme...and it needs to be the same on both ends of the cable. When you buy standard patch cables, they are almost always made in this fashion. A crossover cable is simply a &quot;B&quot; at one end and an &quot;A&quot; at the other. My guess is that you've got this crossed at some point and can possibly verify this by using a crossover cable from your PC to one of your &quot;dead&quot; wall outlets. If it works with a crossover cable, something got wired backwards. Good luck.

If making patch cables with the male plugs, always square off the wiring ends before inserting them into the plugs or some may not seat fully. Before crimping, look at terminal end of the wiring inside of the plug and count all 8 copper ends to make sure they're fully seated.

Life is simpler when you go from socket to socket (or patch panel) for wall wiring. RJ45 receptacles are easy to connect to the wires. OTOH RJ45 plugs and crimping are a b**** to deal with, so use ready made patch cords from wall to switch and the PC. Good luck.
