1.1.1	The new article with a sneek peak of Windows longhorn has made me much less stressed out ( http://tinyurl.com/75dhm ).	St
1.1.2	Someone said you would need like 4GB of RAM to run it well and you would also have to have a 64 bit processor.	St
1.1.3	Well not only does the article mention it will need &quot;at least 512MB of RAM&quot; but it also says it comes in a 64 bit AND 32 bit versions.	St
1.1.4	I think that because longhorn will also have 32 bit version, 64 bit will become the standard at a much later time then most people were expecting.	St
1.1.5	I'm just very thankful that M$ didnt just go all out and make a OS that needs a $2,000+ computer to run.	St
1.2.1	Longhorn will require more than 512MB of RAM.	St
1.2.2	I have never had &quot;any&quot; version of Windows run smoothly with the minimum recommended RAM.	St
1.2.3	I think MS must base their calculations on the premise that Windows will be the &quot;only&quot; program installed on your computer.	St
1.2.4	-JDM (*BTW, the people I've talked to about Longhorn say that most of the good stuff will be under the hood.	St
1.2.5	That's nice to know, but it will be a tough sell for MS...people like what they can see.)	St
1.3.1	Its like windows XP, it says it can run on 128MB of RAM but you should probobly have 256MB.	St
1.3.2	So in this case it probobly means you should have 1GB, which is much more do able then 4GB.	St
1.3.3	What do you mean by under the hood?	Ques
1.3.4	Does that mean just over all better performance?	St
1.3.5	Oh and the artice mentions you need a good GPU.	St
1.3.6	Do you think it would turn off all the extra effects while you are playing a game?	St
1.3.7	Its bad enough that windows wastes a lot of your processing power when playing a game...	St
1.3.8	It would really suck if windoes also started watering down your GPU.	St
1.4.1	and &quot;better written&quot; software is what I've been told.	St
1.4.2	My contacts say it's going to be a great new &quot;framework&quot; for doing bigger and better things.	St
1.4.3	Their verdict is &quot;awesome&quot;...and they are really picky guys.	St
1.4.4	Knowing them, they're impressed by things like &quot;stability&quot;, &quot;efficiency&quot;, &quot;security&quot;, &quot;expansion capacity&quot;, etc.	St
1.4.5	(I'm not a programmer, so I don't understand exactly what it is that has them so excited--but they are quite excited.)	St
1.4.6	From what I know, once you've installed the software, it won't be easy to enable/disable the enhanced graphical features.	St
1.4.7	That will be more of an &quot;initial setup&quot; issue.	St
1.4.8	I would assume, however, that those features wouldn't really interfere with game play.	St
1.4.9	-JDM	St
1.5.1	Lets see now, longhorn is NOT in a beta yet, over a year away.	St
1.5.2	DON'T HOLD YOUR BRAETH!!	St
1.5.3	Lets review some history.	St
1.5.4	Windows 95 hype for 3 years!!	St
1.5.5	Befor it came out.	St
1.5.6	Many probles with the product.	St
1.5.7	Then Win98 didn't work good untill second edition in '99 Then WinME to many problems to go into.	St
1.5.8	Win XP now on SP2 still lots of problems!!	St
1.5.9	MS has had to take so much out of longhorn that it should be called shorthorn.	St
1.5.10	There is an old saying &quot; The proof of the pudding is in the eating&quot;.	St
1.5.11	Right now MS is selling sizzle but there is no steak.	St
1.5.12	I look a longhorn maybe when it gets to SP1.	St
1.5.13	John	St
