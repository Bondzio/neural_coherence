<s> I want to buy a DVD-Rom, not a writer, just a rom which can read DVD's. </s>
<s> People told me that Samsung DVD-Roms give the best performance, but when I checked in the stores, they were all out of samsung and they said that there is a shortage of samsung players. </s>
<s> I live in a country where there is no online shopping or stuff like that so that's out of the question. </s>
<s> Now, I currently have a Lite On Cd writer and it has worked very well for the past couple of years and is still working fine. </s>
<s> I was thinking of buying a Lite ON Dvd rom. </s>
<s> The brands available here are Sony, Lite On, Asus, MSI and mercury. </s>
<s> Please help me in deciding which one to buy, or should i just wait for the samsung to come back into the stores but that may not happen for another ......who knows.....two years!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Order from newegg.com, compgeeks.com and will pick up a low price drive. </s>
<s> DVDROM drives are commodity items and the important item appears to be the bundled DVD player software. </s>
<s> Outside of the too noisy drive that Creative Labs had years ago, I've yet to find any drive to be preferred. </s>
<s> One note. </s>
<s> Keep the drive cool and leave an air gap top and bottom for the best lifespan. </s>
