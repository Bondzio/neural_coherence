I really have no idea what all those guys are rambling about.
It should not really matter much which enclosure you buy, as long as you make sure the drive within is of high quality.
I suggest choose anything with a Seagate drive in it, as Seagate drives now all come with 5 year warranties.
As for the enclosure itself, these are not really expensive, and if the ENCLOSURE fails (ie not the drive itself within the enclosure) you can always get a new enclosure and through the drive in the old one, into the newer one.
Generally you cant go wrong if you purchase the Vantec NST-250U2 enclosure with a seagate drive inside.
Also you cud consider getting a Dual-Layer DVD drive and backup tyo DVD disk, which is probably a much better bet and will probably cost u much less.
Just make sure you get quality DVD disk like Verbatim, TDK, or Maxell.
good DVD burners include NEC-3500a (the best) Sony D22A, Samsung H-552B
