Great!
Thanks for the information!
I will be connectiong the two machines (yes, both are XP), this evening, and will hopefully be able to fix the problem.
I spent 8 hours working on it last weekend, with no success.
I have a few more battle plans this time around, so hopefully things will work out.
I will update my progress.
Thanks, Java Trish
