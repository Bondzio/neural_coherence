Is this problem able to be fixed or my router dead? and what could cause this?
13546	1	54669	652298	651853	Michael Geist	1/2/05 3:03 PM	1.10467818E12	I would connect the modem directly to a PC....	to see if an internet connection exists. Modems go bad as well.

I have plugged the modem into the computer. I got the internet. When plugged to the router everything seems to worl fine. I get all the lights, I can access my network, my laptop gets a signal, but the internet doesnt go to my desktop or laptop.

From inside the setup program you can check things such as: 1) MAC filtering (on or off) 2) DHCP status 3) user names and passwords if required by the ISP 4) DHCP client list 5) DHCP release and renew buttons Has this router ever worked with this setup?
