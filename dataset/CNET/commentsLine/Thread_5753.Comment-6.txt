the key method is known to you and the risks.
it matters not in the grand scheme if the whole file or block of access unless that's your &quot;specification&quot; in which case, we need to rewind this to the top and really grind through what products you know about and what i know about.
then see which fits your spec.
an example usb key product is  but you don't get two keys and if you buy a second key, it won't let you access the files.
they and others don't offer data recovery services.
you must be aware of the risks.
