my eeepc 1000ha has a 160 gb sata hd, an atom n-270, 2 gb ddr2.
is it worth the trouble to replace the hd with an ssd (i have a usb adapter to use to clone it) now that some 80gb -120gb ssds are down to &lt;$110?
this hd is partitioned with c: = ~80gb and d:= ~60gb-used space = 1%(used space never grows for d:).
what is this d; drive all about, recovery?
it's awful big for that function.
for the ssd (80gb for example) hoiw big should i make the d: drive?
