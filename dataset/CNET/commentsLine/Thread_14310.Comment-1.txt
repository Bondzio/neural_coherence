i have a compaq presario with an 1.4ghz intel celeron processor.
it is equipped with a realtek ethernet and a broadcom 802.11b/g wlan.
until yesterday i was able to connect to any available network but now the system fails to connect and gives the following message: &quot;make sure the wireless switch on your computer is on&quot;.
i heard this problem is not uncommon but i have no idea what to do.
can anybody help, please?
