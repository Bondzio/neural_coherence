1.1.1	This D-Link DI-624 router is driving me nuts .	St
1.1.2	It disconects and reconects after 10 minutes or so of being solidly connected at 54Mbs .	St
1.1.3	Right now it is actually disconnected .	St
1.1.4	Now it came back up the bars in my task bar are green and connected while the disconnected wireless network has a cross in it .	St
1.1.5	How can one thing say it is connected while the other contradicts it ?	Ques
1.1.6	If I disable windows firewall it connects to the network , only to disconnect a while later .	St
1.1.7	If I enable windows firewall the same thing happens .	St
1.1.8	Everything is contradicting something else .	St
1.1.9	I have reseted the router a couple of times to its factory default but the same things happen again .	St
1.1.10	It was working fine last night .	St
1.1.11	My LAN is working with no problems .	St
1.1.12	I have had this router for a week now and I wish I had not bought it .	St
1.2.1	update then run your spyware scans .	St
1.2.2	Dropped connections can be a side effect of the little vermin .	St
1.3.1	I have run all scans there are to be run .	St
1.3.2	I was just on the phone with these guys from D-Link support they have reseted and tweaked my settings .	St
1.3.3	It seems to work a little better , but when I activate the WEP security mode it seems to be going the same old problem .	St
1.3.4	I ca n't rely on an open system to run my wireless connection .	St
1.3.5	It seems to me very strange that this was not happening for the first week I have had this router .	St
1.3.6	How come all of a sudden it began doing this nonsense .	St
1.4.1	checks out OK , that leaves a hardware issue .	St
1.4.2	If the problem persists on another PC that is known to have no issues , then the router becomes the primary suspect .	St
1.4.3	I would try another brand .	Sug
