I am sorry, I don't understand your response.
Who are the &quot;IT staff&quot; in this case?
Is there a posted document or something I can look up, on this forum?
I do believe you are on the right track with the old permissions or accounts ideas, but can you be more specific on where I could look?
thanks.
Tony
