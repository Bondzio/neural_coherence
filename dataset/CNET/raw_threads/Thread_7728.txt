But it has not started again after I moved it to a new place. When I turn on the computer, its fans start to work even a small lamp in the mother board turns on. And I noticed that the PCI devices have power. But nothing appears on the screen. The monitor is healthy and I even tested another graphic card. Its hard drive don't work (the HDD LED notifier remains off) and it actually does not boot. The system does nothing, even no POST beep I hear. I tried removing the RAM and it normally started beeping. So I think it is not a problem with motherboard. Any help is appreciated. Is it a problem with CPU (it's a P4)? If so how can I troubleshoot it? I have another P4, but I do not know how I can replace CPUs, I even do not know how to remove CPU fan. Homam

One of the laments about the PC design is that it takes good parts to swap in to find the bad part. What spares do you have? Have you tried just the bare minimum parts? Bob
