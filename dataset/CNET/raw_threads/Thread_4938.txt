When I put the two together, it said Running at DDR 333 in DUAL CHANNEL MODE as I booted up. The problem I have is when playing vice city, if I play for about 5 - 10 mins (it varys), then it will pop up with an error and say Unhandled Exception. Also other things started to crash like MSN Messenger, and I wasnt even using it. I removed the PC7200 ram and I played Vice City for 3 hours lol and it didn't have the error any more. I just want to know why this is happening and if I get another stick of Apacer 512 PC3200 if the problem will go away or not :-| I have an AMD Athlon XP 2500 + and I know thats not where the instatability is at because its not overclocked and not overheating. I have an NF7-S Abit Motherboard. Thanks for any replys

Windows 3, 95, 98 and ME have issues past 512MB. Even NT, 2000 and XP may run fine on 256 or 512MB. In fact, you may have found a flaw in your machine and since its very new, make it a warranty issue with your machine supplier. Ask for it to be fixed or your money back. Bob

Proffitt	11/17/03 10:46 AM	1.06906596E12	Why use anything else?	&quot;would you recommend getting that ram thats sold that comes in pairs thats made for dual channel?&quot; Again, NO ONE will tell you with any warranty that this will fix that. But I think you just answered your question. I will share that I see a lot of those type machines. I have to set the FSB from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 MHz and often the machine stabilizes. Many cry out saying it will run slower, but random reboots or lockups seem pretty slow to me. In short, why isn't there a warranty on this machine or its parts? Call the suppliers. Bob

Took it out and ran prime95 again with no errors... hmmm i guess the abit nf7-s doesnt like pc2700 or crucial ram anyways thanks for your help bob
