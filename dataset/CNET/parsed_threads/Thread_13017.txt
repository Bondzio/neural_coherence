<s> So can you offer any clue what can be wrong and how to solve this problem ? </s>
<s> [A] Is mouse bad ? </s>
<s> I do not have a spare one to check. </s>
<s> Is OS/Driver/Setting corrupt ? </s>

<s> Bad mouse, Bad! </s>
<s> If it won't behave, get a new one. </s>
<s> You didn't mention what type so presume it's the wheel kind. </s>
<s> Sometimes you can feel the crud build up on the inner cylindrical rollers on these and clean them off. </s>

<s> It just depends on how much you love this mouse and don't want to part with it. </s>
<s> Thank you for your suggestions. </s>
