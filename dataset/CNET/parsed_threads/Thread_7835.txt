<s> I hope my question is not seen as too remedial, but I have been using Cable internet access for over a year, and have only just discovered that I can get my wife onto my account for free. </s>
<s> She currently struggles with AOL, and I've been advised that I can get her using my cable connection - without no inconvenience to me (I work from home) - if I just network her to my computer, using a wireless router. </s>
<s> Could somebody advise? </s>
<s> She has 2 USB ports, but no Ethernet port, so I'm assuming I need to get a USB to ethernet adapter, but then what? </s>
<s> What other stuff do I need to buy, and what do you recommend that is inexpensive but works well enough: she just needs to be able to go online to check her emails, and very rarely browse some online store or other! </s>
<s> Many thanks, in advance, for your feedback and advice. </s>
<s> This is the USB wireless adapter I use... http://d-link.com/products/?pid=175 Any simpler to set up a child could do it. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestion, Michael! </s>
<s> I hope you won't mind a couple of follow-ups: Do I also need a router with this? </s>
<s> If so, what router would you recommend I purchase? </s>
<s> The site you referenced states it works with Windows 98SE...does it work with the regular Windows 98 as well? </s>
<s> My wife has a Compaq &quot;Internet Computer&quot; from 1999, which works fine, and has 2 USB ports, and runs Windows 98. </s>
<s> Based on the information from D-Links website, I would say Windows 98 first edition may have a problem with this adapter. </s>
<s> Workarounds are: 1) Upgrade the OS 2) Place the wireless router near the 98 machine and use a CAT5 cable to it. </s>
<s> Of course some type of ethernet adapter would need to be installed in the machine. </s>
<s> A multiported wireless router which feature both wired and wireless capabilities from D-Link or Linksys are among the most popular devices used. </s>
<s> I called D-Link, and they said it would handle Windows 98 (but then again, I was talking to a very aggressive salesperson!). </s>
<s> He claims I should get the G-120, instead of the 122, as the former goes to 54 Mbps, and the 122 only goes to 11Mbps. </s>
<s> I asked him if I even needed more than 11, given my wife only uses the net for checking email, and the very rare browsing session. </s>
<s> He said yes, because it would ensure less dropped connections...He also strongly recommended the DI-624 router, because they will be apparently shortly discontinuing the DI-514...your thoughts? </s>
<s> thanks again, in advance, for your advice. </s>
<s> 11 mbps vs 54 mbps, yes it is faster for local file transfers between computers. </s>
<s> As far as a faster internet connection, not really since your internet is traveling much slower then 11 mbps. </s>
<s> I have no idea what he meant by &quot;less dropped connections&quot;, this seems misleading. </s>
<s> I know...2 years later! </s>
<s> I just wanted to thank you for all your advice. </s>
<s> It helped alot. </s>
<s> Am now planning on upgrading my home networking (ie: installing some beyond just simple PC to PC wireless). </s>
<s> Thanks again, and sorry for delay in expression of gratitude! </s>
