I have 3 comps connected through the router.Linksys BEFSR41 Firmware version 1.45.7 I just reset the router and it works fine. I am using Win XP Pro VER 5.1 SP1 and a cable modem. I have no other issues with any of the computers.(win98se on both other comps.) I have checked and my network connection details which look as below... Physical Address: 00-0C-6B-1A-CC-63 IP Address: 192.168.1.100 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 DHCP Server: 192.168.1.1 Lease Obtained: 30/10/2003 5:39:33 PM Lease Expires: 31/10/2003 5:39:33 PM Is it normal for the lease to expire daily like this? Has anyone had this type of issue? Thanks Mike

I have to say that they are extremely helpful over the phone and very willing--no sighs or disdain, just good help. The phone number should be at the back of your booklet or else go to their web site to tech support (if web access is available nearby, ie. town library)

You can control that lease time, it on the password page of that router. Turn off UPNP with in the router, that may stop it from locking up. This router has a bad reputation of locking up. Hopefully a new firmware up date will be out soon, as I have 6 of these units in place.

Is it better to leave it on 0 (one day) or should I put a number of minutes? Should I enable the 'Block WAN request' (default is off) Thanks

Unfortunately, the store only had this crap of a router available,a Linksys BEFSR41. It's been a week, and I still can't get the damn thing to do what i want it to, which is to let Gunz online be what it is, an online multiplayer game. Another thing wrong with this piece of sh.... is the frequent disconnection problem. What makes it worse is that you cant set the reconnect time to less than 20 seconds! Soon as i get my DLink replacement, this junk will get my hammer award. Or maybe somebody wanna router cheap? I'll throw in some aspirins...
