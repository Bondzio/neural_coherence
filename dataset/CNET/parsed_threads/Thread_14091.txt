<s> Hi I use XP Pro and have an ATI 9800 Pro 128m AGP graphics card. </s>
<s> I picked up a Silicon Graphics/Sony 20 inch CRT monitor and have had problems with the monitor resizing my viewable window upon a cold start up and in games. </s>
<s> Upon start up (every time) I have to go into control panel and into display to advanced settings and select/switch from screen refresh rate of 75 Hertz to 85 Hertz for the screen to display properly. </s>
<s> The next time I restart my system from a cold boot I get the same problem so I go into advanced settings and switch from 85 hertz to 75 hertz... </s>
<s> When I play some games I can't see the whole screen as it is too low a resolution and the game screen is too large! </s>
<s> I searched the web and I can't get a driver for this monitor as it is 5 years old (or older) and I haven't found a compatible driver from Sony. </s>
<s> So I use the recommended windows generic driver. </s>
<s> I have the latest driver updates from ATI for the graphics card. </s>
<s> I am stumped, is it a video card problem or a hardware problem? </s>
<s> It bugs me because I want to play some games and the resizing of the monitor becomes an issue when the screen resolution changes... </s>
<s> I hope this makes sense... </s>
<s> Today's monitors understand how to resize or use the various refresh rates. </s>
<s> I wonder if this is a monitor from the bad old days? </s>
<s> If so, you may have to dive in and create your very own MONITOR.INF file. </s>
<s> Such is beyond the scope of what support I'll offer here but at least you and google can research how to create a monitor.inf for said monitor that could alleviate the issue. </s>
<s> You would also research the use of DXDIAG and the MORE tab, then the OVERRIDE button to lock in directx to that refresh rate. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
