1.1.1	I just installed a motherboard , Intel Desktop Board D865PERL , that has 2 sata ports and 2 pata ports .	St
1.1.2	The problem I 'm having is that my hard drive , IBM Desktop S/N A4DBP79F , and secondary optical device is IDE/PATA and I have installed a new DVD writer that is SATA .	St
1.1.3	When I change drive settings in the bios to enhanced and re-boot the system will not see my hard drive .	St
1.1.4	I then changed the drive setting to legacy and chose PATA Pri/SATA Sec and the system will re-boot properly but it will not see the secondary optical device .	St
1.1.5	There are multiple pin configurations on the hard drive and I was wondering if the jumpers could possibly be the problem .	St
1.1.6	Its set to master now .	St
1.2.1	And why you get to futz around with bios and more till you find a compatible combination that you like .	St
1.2.2	That is , if you enable PATA EMULATION then you may lose a PATA port .	St
1.2.3	If you leave the BIOS in full SATA mode , XP will create headaches for the uninitiated or those that did n't research this .	St
1.2.4	And as you discovered the enhanced mode is just trouble .	St
1.2.5	I suggest you leave it in normal modes and install the motherboard and sata drivers for this OS .	Sug
