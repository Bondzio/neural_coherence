it looks like to me either this cpu number 519 is no longer in production right now or is a special cpu made just for emachines with a lower fsb.
it seems as all the socket lga775 are 800fsb when mine is only 533mhz.
and the lowest cpu number i can see is 520. looks like i'll need a new cpu,motherboard, and ram by 2006.
