i bought some new ddr2 memory, but it won't fit.
both my old and new memory have 240 pins.
the memory i had has 64 pins then a gap then 56 pins (each side), which looking at google images and wikipedia seems standard.
the new memory, (hyf2536481g) has 68 pins then a gap then 52 pins (each side).
the gap is 73mm from the edge i thought all ddr2 memory had the same layout; has anyone come across this?
i thought they might have sent ddr because of the gap position, but ddr has fewer pins.
