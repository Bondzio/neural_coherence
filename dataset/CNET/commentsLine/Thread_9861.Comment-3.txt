the wireless are not reliable.
the batteries fail and cause service calls to the tune of 100's of dollars for some consumers.
microsoft's units are nice and the drivers while not stellar didn't lock up machines like the logitech drivers.
i give the nod to microsoft on this one just because of logitech's gaffe plus their arrogance in hiding the solution to the issue on their web site.
what is their problem?
