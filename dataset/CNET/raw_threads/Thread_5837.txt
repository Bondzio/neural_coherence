I bought a local non-branded 300 Watt casing for my system here, which is working perfectly fine except for one thing. Recently my computer has started making annoying noises, i checked Cnet's Help guide to cleaning the pc, and I cleaned my pc, cleaned all the fans and everything. This casing has two fans, one in the power supply, and another at the top of the casing, a small fan which seems like an extra to me in this casing, guess they were just trying to make the casing more attractive by putting in the extra fan. Now i checked and the upper fan is making ALL the noise, when i stop this fan, all noise ceases, and even after cleaning this fan is making a lot of noise, although the noise has decreased than before but it is still highly annoying. I wanted to know if I can just disable this fan and put it away, as I don't think it's of much use in the pc, the casing already has a power supply fan, processor fan, and a video card fan, this seems like an extra. Please tell me if i can just remove this fan from my pc, or any other tips, also, if I can remove it, is there any safe way of doing it? There are two red and black wires going from my power supply to the center of the fan. Help me, my ears are killing me!

WD-40, 3-in-1, or Marvel Mystery oil all works. This will help the noise, My question to you is: Do you have another fan for the case and does the power supply fan exhaust out the back. Heat raises and if the only fan you have is the PS then all the heat will be going into your PS and slowly over time heat it up.

I didn't try the oil thing, do I have to lift the silver plastic sticker in the middle of the fan and apply oil under there? I don't think that is also going to help much because this fan really sucks. Anyway, ill try it, thanks.

Most fans start making noise as time goes by, some faster than others. I clean my system every month and oil the fans at the same time. Love that quiet sound. Welcome

That top exhaust is of huge benefits regarding cooling. Remember that heat rises. I only use cases that have top exhaust fans, or add one for one case that I like, whose top comes off separately making it easy to cut the fan opening in the top,.

In the meantime, do that and then get your hands on a replacement fan. The cost of the fan is pretty cheap and the reason for the fan in the first place is to help cool the system case. The overall cooling allows your system to remain stable. If you have a quiet system, then the fan is be noticable as a noise source, so buy a decent replacement to offers &quot;low db&quot; noise levels. This maybe hit or miss as real cheap fans can work great but tend to fail quickly. tada -----Willy

You see, the fan is screwed to the top grill of the casing, when the fan rotates, the &quot;grill&quot; makes the noise, not the fan. The fan is screwed to the grill, now i've tried tightening the screws but it didn't help. I don't think theres any simple way to solve this problem. what can I do, the grill is fixed, doesn't have any other screws, and it makes noise when the fan is on......any ideas?? Thanks once again.
