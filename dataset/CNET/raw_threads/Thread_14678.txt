She will need a wireless network card....either mini PCI if available or using an available add in slot (pcmcia types). Something with 802.11 b/g should be fine. These can be bought for under $50. Wireless print servers come in parallel and USB types and tend to run about $80 and up though bargains can be found. If this is within your price range, options are many.

I was trying to find the HL-5140 on a list of printers known to be comaptible (or incompatible) with particular print servers. I haven't done a comprehensive search, but I didn't see it on any list one way or the other. SUGGESTION FOR coolanticool: you might want to contact the major mfgs. (Linksys, Belkin, D-link, Netgear, etc.) and ask them which of their print servers will support the HL-5140.
