I'm pretty sure that it's compatible with my mobo because the description on the bus type says it's an &quot;AMD Athlon 64x2 model&quot; and on Acer's website for my cpu's specs says &quot;Processor: AMD AM2 Athlon 64 x 2 or Athlon 64 or Sempron (940 pin)&quot; (here's the link: http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/0000/Acer/AspireT180/AspireT180sp2.shtml )I did notice that it got very hot pretty quickly. This is my first time replacing a cpu so I'd appreciate all the help I can get . Also my mobo cpu socket type is AM2 and the CPU is AM2+. I read that AM2+ is backwards compatible with AM2. Is this true or not? If not then Doh &gt;.&lt; My bios is up to date with the bios acer released so I dunno if that is the problem.

Such changes are &quot;great it works&quot; as well as &quot;it didn't work.&quot; As the BIOS is current your result is the later. Upgrading laptop CPUs tend to work out or not. Since we can't force the maker to support other CPUs my advice is get your money back. Bob
