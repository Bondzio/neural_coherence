I have been facing few problems in finding enclosure.
I have bought 3 different type of enclosure till date and all of them are off in dimension by few millimeters and hence not working.
It is for 2.5&quot; SATA internal harddrive 80GB from my 1 year old HP laptop.
any recommendations will be surely appreciated.
thanks Harvijay
