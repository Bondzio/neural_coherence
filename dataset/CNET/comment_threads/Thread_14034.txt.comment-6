Hi, Could you try booting up and using the sytem with less stuff?
e.g.
remove the VGA card, use the on-board one, and use less / one pcs or even old RAM.
If it works fine, than re-install RAM, Cards one by one to see the difference.
You may also adjust the CL value in the bios to a bigger value (e.g.
CL3 or 4) I have similar problem for my PCs / notebooks at home and work.
RAM is usually the source of problem.
