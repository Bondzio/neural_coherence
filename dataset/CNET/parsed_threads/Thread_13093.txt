<s> Hello I have recently changed hard drives as my older hard drive was too small. </s>
<s> I used a cloning program and it worked without a hitch. </s>
<s> I kept the partition between O/S and data but proportionately bigger. </s>
<s> Recently I lost data & want to reconnect old HD to transfer the lost data across. </s>
<s> unfortunately it asked for a boot disk which I don't have nor a floppy drive. </s>
<s> Do I need one? </s>
<s> Will the O/S on older HD conflict when both old & new HD are connected? </s>
<s> Can anyone shed some light? </s>
<s> Regards Illya PS. </s>
<s> O/S = XP Home Edition </s>
<s> Normally, there are no such problems expecially since one is a clone of the other. </s>
<s> Just properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another IDE port until finished. </s>
<s> XP will see this as a hardware change, however, and the meter keeps running until enough of these prompt a reactivation. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> Did I mention that I am a novice? </s>
<s> How do I 'properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another IDE port until finished'? </s>
<s> Can you please give me a quick run down or link me to an appropriate site. </s>
<s> Either way, thank you very much for your help Steven. </s>
<s> I assume I go into 'bios' and slave it there. </s>
<s> Can I slave it before I connect it? </s>
<s> http://www.duxcw.com/digest/Howto/hd/cpyhd/ I think this should answer it all. </s>

<s> Thank you very much Steven and Bob. </s>
<s> Your help is exactly what I was after. </s>
<s> That link you gave me Bob covers everything I needed. </s>
<s> I appreciate your time and help!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> Kindest regards, Illya PS. </s>
