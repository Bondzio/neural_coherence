I've heard a lot about overclocking the processor and the video card for a better performance in contrast to more heat and damage on the long run.
I have an Intel Pentium 4 @ 2.4Ghz and a GeForce FX5500 256mb AGP.
Do you think overclocking in certain 3d games like Dawn of War and the like would provide better performance without conflicts?
If so, how to do that?
Thank you.
