hi all, i used to build pc's a while ago.
things have changed a lot and i realize that i'm probably better off coming here with a couple of questions....for all you builder geeks wink here's what i want to accomplish: through ebay or other used vendors, i want to put together a system for some gaming (not the latest stuff) and intenet - kids pc.
so in the fast paced world of pc parts, what would be my most cost effective and cheapest way to build one up from scratch?
looking to spend very little -100$ or so all builds welcomed!
here's some of what i've seen on ebay - my problem is knowing what all i'll need for a particular build say an amd 64 socket 754??
i don't know, you guys suggest - i'm listening thanks for your patience!
