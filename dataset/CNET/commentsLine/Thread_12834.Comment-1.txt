i am using dell dimension 3000 computer with dell e173 fp flat panel color monitor less that two years.
yesterday, when i turned on the computer, i have seen only black screen.
the power led was green.
when i turned off and then on the power of the monitor, the screen was normal several seconds (i saw icons on the screen) and then became black again.
i ran self-test pattern and i think that the monitor does not pass it, because the self-test pattern does not scroll through the screen continually.
it appeared in the left bottom corner of the screen and then in a second disappeared.
please let me know where is the problem?
how to solve it/ now instead of computer monitor i am using tv screen.
hence, the problem is only with monitor.
how to solve it?
thank you in advance for help.
