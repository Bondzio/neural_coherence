<s> I have come up with an error when I boot up of &quot;Found new Hardware, Ethernet Controller&quot; on my Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> My computer is an HP Pavillion 7950 and the system board is M6TBA but I cannot find drivers to fix my problem. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled the device but it cannot find on my PC, internet what it is looking for. </s>
<s> I have a fiberoptic DSL connection. </s>
<s> Can someone help? </s>
<s> If the machine was damaged by any lightning hit, no driver will fix it, but for the http://www.google.com/search?&q=M6TBA search found the makers web site on the first page. </s>
<s> This is a Slot 1 board made 1999 or prior so support may be non-existant and frankly the owner should have become familiar with it and collected drivers over the past 4 years. </s>
<s> http://www.biostar.com.tw/support/manual/archives.php3 and fetching the manual shows that no onboard LAN was supplied. </s>
<s> You'll have to identify your network card and fetch drivers, but if it's fried, GO SHOPPING. </s>
<s> Last week found these cards new for five dollars. </s>
