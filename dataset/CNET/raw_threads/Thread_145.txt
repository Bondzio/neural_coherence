123	0	299516	2801870	NR	phill85	6/29/08 8:04 AM	1.21472664E12	Mobo Swap	Ok, ive managed to obtain a cheap pentium 4 2ghz system, to replace the durno 1ghz system at my church. The current system is used to project the words to the songs so it has two graphics cards (for dula scrren display, one to a monitor, and one to a projector) Here is the spec of the current system Duron 1ghz ECS Elite Group K7S5A Mother Board ( http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Downloads/ProductsDetail_Download.aspx?detailid=74&DetailName=Manual&DetailDesc=K7S5A%20%20 (V1.1)&CategoryID=1&MenuID=82&LanID=0) ATI RV2P-B3 PCI Graphics card DVI, VGA and component out (sorry couldnt find specs) Aopen 02948V1 AGP VGA out (sorry couldnt find any specs) The new system: P4 2ghz MSI MS6526 ver 3 ( http://global.msi.com.tw/index.php?func=downloaddetail&type=manual&maincat_no=1&prod_no=491 ) I dont tink i will need to use the on borad vga of the mother board, or the agp graphics card, as the projector has a dvi connection, but my question is could if needed? Both have agp 4x slots, but the MSI states that it must be a 1.5v card are all agp 4x cards 1.5 volt? Thanks Phill

It's very confusing to most that the AGP voltage is not set by the motherboard but by the card you put in. And there are KEYS in the slots to stop you from plugging in an incompatible card. Sorry but I decline to re-explain this further. Bob

So can it be said that its compatable, the keying on the card is done by two slots, in the old motherboard, none?
