<s> I am running an ASUS P4P800S-X Motherboard with a P4 3.0GHz CPU, 1GB of DDR Ram consisting of two 512 chips, and an ASUS Radeon 9550SE VGA card. </s>
<s> Recently I started having problems on boot-up where during the boot sequence the computer would freeze when it reached the NVRAM check. </s>
<s> The screen will say: DDR Frequency 400 Mhz Checking NVRAM.. And then it stops booting up. </s>
<s> If I turn off the power and reboot it then gets past that part on the second boot sequence and shows the following message instead: Overclocking Failed! </s>
<s> Please enter Setup to re-configure your system. </s>
<s> Then I press F1 to enter the Bios Setup, exit the BIOS without changing anything, and the computer boots up fine thereafter. </s>
<s> This problem now happens every time I boot my PC from having been in a powered off state. </s>
<s> At first I thought maybe the Ram chips were loose so I took them out and swapped the RAM slots just in case, but that didnt help to get rid of the problem. </s>
<s> Now I am thinking it may be a BIOS setting, but I am not sure what I would need to reset in the BIOS to fix the problem. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be kindly appreciated. </s>
<s> did you accidentally set the jumpers for the CPU to settings that would overclock it? </s>
<s> or did you try overclocking accidentally (chaning a setting thinking it was something else?) </s>
<s> another idea would be to contact Asus or just download the newest BIOS from Asus for your board </s>
<s> Thank you Ozos. </s>
<s> I have not changed any jumper or any other settings on the BIOS as far as I know. </s>
<s> &lt;P&gt; The only recent change to the PC was the addition of one of those optical mouses with all kinds of lights inside. </s>
<s> Maybe the extra power demand is causing a problem? </s>
<s> &lt;P&gt; Flashing the BIOS is a good sugesstion though. </s>
<s> I will start there by checking to see if there is an update available from ASUS. </s>
