<s> Im having issues with my video card. </s>
<s> Awhile back it just started flickering and freezing up on me. </s>
<s> So i assumed it was the card itself. </s>
<s> I switched to the onboard video and have no problems. </s>
<s> Yet when i uninstall the driver for my plug and play card i can then put that card back in and as long as i dont update the card and use the default monitor it does not do any flickering or freezing. </s>
<s> So im not exactly sure its the card because as long as i dont update it and use default driver for it, it works fine just without any 3D. </s>
<s> By the way its a nvidia Geforce4 mx420.Any suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I'd do two things. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Remove the case cover to sniff out heat issues. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Install the latest Nvidea drivers from Nvidia and not Microsoft. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Have you disabled onboard vid after installing the card? </s>
