Above i stated the game was trying to run @ 75 hertz, this was wrong.
Think im reading to many forums and getting burned out.
It says(&quot;Not Optimum Mode, Recommended Mode: 1920 X 1080 @ 60 hertz).
The games highest setting is 1280 X 1024.
This is where the problem is i think.
The monitor wants the game run @ 1920 X 1080, which it cannot do.
I have posted to Samsung support but have received no reply as of yet.
