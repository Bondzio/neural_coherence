1.1.1	Hi , I 'm new here and not too network-savvy .	St
1.1.2	I 'm trying to go wireless with a desktop PC running Windows XP SP2 .	St
1.1.3	I 've got a 2WIRE router which works fine when plugged into the computer via an ethernet cable .	St
1.1.4	I purchased a Netgear N300 Wireless USB adapter and installed it - it seems to be working fine .	St
1.1.5	The trouble is that my wireless connection shows & quot ; limited or no connectivity , & quot ; although the signal strength is & quot ; very good. & quot ; When I try to repair the connection , it tells me that I could not be assigned an IP address .	St
1.1.6	At the moment I 'm working via the Ethernet cable with no difficulty .	St
1.1.7	Can someone suggest a reason why the wired connection works but the wireless ( from the same router ) does n't , even though it should ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance for any help !	St
1.2.1	It could be that the OS is out of date ( SP3 has been out for years and many drivers expect it . )	St
1.2.2	You never revealed if it ever worked .	St
1.2.3	I now that setup can be horrible and today 's users are not ready for this old thing .	St
1.2.4	Tell more .	St
1.2.5	Such as if you tried it within 10 feet of the un-named and untold settings router .	St
1.2.6	For example I do not expect it to work if the SSID is hidden .	St
1.2.7	I also expect this to fail if the ethernet is plugged in , if the Ethernet IP settings were set manually and if the IP addresses are still around when you try the WiFi .	St
1.2.8	Lots to consider .	St
1.2.9	Lots of things today 's owners have reason to move away from this old thing .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	Router and adapter are in the same room , about 6 feet apart .	St
1.3.2	Router has always worked previously , just using ethernet cable .	St
1.3.3	But I 've never tried it wirelessly before .	St
1.3.4	SSID broadcast is enabled .	St
1.3.5	Router is a 2WIRE 2701HB-G .	St
1.3.6	If I understand you , you 're saying that you do n't expect the wireless adapter to work if my ethernet cable is also plugged in ?	Ques
1.4.1	If the ethernet is plugged in the IP assigned there is on the same LAN as what the WiFi will try to get assigned .	St
1.4.2	So if you recall your basic network classes you ca n't have 2 interfaces on the same LAN ( well , without a lot of work . )	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	But I eventually had to take it to an IT pro for some other issues , so I 'm having the network issue addressed at the same time .	St
1.5.2	I appreciate your help .	Polite
1.6.1	If your wired connection works fine but not your wireless then you can eliminate your modem and you wired LAN settings .	St
1.6.2	I would take a look at my wireless LAN settings , make sure it 's set to DHCP and check out what range you have it set to .	St
1.6.3	If you get that message see if you can ping your default gateway .	St
