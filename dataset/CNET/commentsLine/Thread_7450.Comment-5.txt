here in the us i paid 60 bucks for a refurb 750gb sata hard disk.
surely you can find an 80 for not much more at newegg.com or geeks.com as to paying for transfer of the data, why would i do that when i have a cable like  and free cloning software like g4u?
sorry but this is an area i feel you diy or pay up.
