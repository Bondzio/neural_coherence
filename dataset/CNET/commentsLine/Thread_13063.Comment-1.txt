how can i have a smoothly transition from wireless network to cellular network?
the following always happens with any cellular enabled device.
- wireless device (tablet, cell phone, etc.)
functions properly on wireless router.
- walk around with it and wireless signal gets weak.
- device slows down and experiences lost network packets.
- after moving far enough away from wireless router, device will finally connect to cellular internet (3g / 4g) problem is extremely bad when i get in my car, because wireless device barely has a signal from the router and i get almost no internet connection.
i have to manually turn off wifi to get the internet working properly.
