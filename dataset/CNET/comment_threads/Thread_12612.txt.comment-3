My intentions are to charge correctly, I understand how important it is to not leave the charger plugged in for more than it requires (battery memory).
Even if I were to charge incorrectly and in about a year my battery charge is only half of what it should be then that would be an even more reason to get a longer battery life, a battery with 4 hours becomes 2 hours after a year vs a battery with 11 hours becomes 5.5 hours after a year, thats a huge diff.
As far as XP, I read somewhere that you cant install XP after windows 7 has been installed (dont know why or how it makes sense) even if it is possible to install XP, thats extra cash that I dont have to purchase XP.
I wouldnt mind going with the 1005 or any ASUS netbook that is around 300.00 and has a 8 to 11 hour battery life, but I cant find any that has xp, if it does it has a 3 to 4 hour battery life.
