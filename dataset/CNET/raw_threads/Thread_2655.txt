You didn't say anything about your PCs other than you'd use them wired so I'd shut down the wireless radio for now. All should go on line fairly easily. You'd want to allow the modem to detect and configure the router. You do this by shutting down the modem, connect the router and turn it on, wait for it to fully initialize and then turn on the modem. Should be simple enough.
