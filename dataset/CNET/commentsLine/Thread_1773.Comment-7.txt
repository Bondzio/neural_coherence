unfortunately you won't be able to increase your front end bus speed very much because your p4 2.0 bus speed is 400mhz by default.
you either have to by a new p4 with the fsb of 800mhz or you can try to overclock it using the intel desktop control center which should be on the disc you got with your board or download it from intel.
it will only increase your fsb speed 4% but i guess that's better than nothing.
what i would really suggest is getting a faster p4 that supports hyper threading and has a fsb of 800mhz to begin with.
your board would automatically recognize it and you would not have to make any bios adjustments.
