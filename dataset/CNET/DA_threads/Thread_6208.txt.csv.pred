1.1.1	Ok ...	St
1.1.2	So this is what I 'm trying to do , I 've read on several sites , and several forum posts on this site but none seem to be concrete working answers so I 'm asking myself ...	St
1.1.3	I just got my new D-Link DIR-825 router yesterday to replace my D-Link DIR-615 router .	St
1.1.4	After replacing the DIR-615 and setting up/configuring my DIR-825 I got the bright idea of trying to & quot ; combine & quot ; the two routers to make one large wireless network .	St
1.1.5	Just as a quick summary ...	St
1.1.6	The DIR-825 is a simultaneous dual-band router operating in the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies .	St
1.1.7	The DIR-615 is a single band router operating in only the 2.4 GHz frequency .	St
1.1.8	Now ... What I want to do : The DIR-825 is downstairs and is the & quot ; main & quot ; router which is connected to the modem .	St
1.1.9	I would like to set up the DIR-615 upstairs and have it connected to the DIR-825 via Ethernet cable ( I have a cable ran the whole length of my house through floors and walls yadda-yadda ) .	St
1.1.10	The DIR-825 router is going to be supplying internet with a port layout as follows : 1 ) To the DIR-615 ( I believe , that 's what I 've gotten through reading ) 2 ) Family computer 3 ) Xbox 360 4 ) Mom 's work computer The DIR-615 router will have the following port layout : ( Does the Ethernet cable from the DIR-825 go into the internet jack , or port 1 jack on the DIR-615 ? ? ? )	Ques
1.1.11	1 ) From DIR-615 ( If I 've read correctly ) 2 ) Brothers computer in his room After making sure all of these computers have internet access I then want to set up the wireless network .	St
1.1.12	The DIR-825 running in the 5 GHz frequency wo n't be a problem , I 'll be running that in 802.11n with a WPA-Personal security which I utilize with my laptop .	St
1.1.13	Where I get confused is the 2.4 GHz frequency .	St
1.1.14	I want to run both the DIR-825 and the DIR-615 as the same SSID with the same security ( has to be WEP for my brothers DSi ) and what-not to essentially make one very large 2.4 GHz network .	St
1.1.15	Possible ?	Ques
1.1.16	Not possible ?	Ques
1.1.17	To much trouble for what its worth ?	Ques
