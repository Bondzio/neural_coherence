<s> I have a home entertainment system setup with a Toshiba HDTV as a second monitor. </s>
<s> It works fine, except that both monitors keep on resetting their resolutions upon boot-up. </s>
<s> Both monitors would normalized to their original resolutions if I launch Media Center (in full screen) and then close it. </s>
<s> I use a Norwood Micro 15.4&quot; LCD as my primary monitor set to 1024 x 768, and the Toshiba 62HM15A 62&quot; DLP Projection HDTV as my secondary monitor set to 1280 x 720. </s>
<s> Both are maximum settings. </s>
<s> The display is set-up to &quot;extend Windows desktop&quot; onto the Toshiba. </s>
<s> Any advice is greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> The Toshiba is connected via DVI-HDMI cable. </s>
<s> The desktop is extended onto this monitor, rather than cloned so I can still use the computer while watching movies. </s>
<s> The problem persists whether I list the Toshiba as the primary or secondary monitor. </s>
<s> I've tried playing around with the video card settings before posting without success. </s>
<s> I do not know how to change the frequency on the Toshiba. </s>
<s> I've checked the manual and did a web search without getting any info. </s>
<s> It's not a Windows thing. </s>
<s> Will check it out & keep you updated </s>
<s> Went to ATI web site & upgraded the driver and the system works like a charm. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
