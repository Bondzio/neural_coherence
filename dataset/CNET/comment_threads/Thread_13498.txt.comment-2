&quot;The capacitor didn't look too bad.&quot; When it comes to Electrolytic capacitors, ANY DEFECT no matter how small is a DEFECT and you change it.
Also you change them after 5 years since they are now past their life span.
I know folk are new to this area so be gentle with them and research, go get data sheets and show them the curves.
