10732	0	594784	5465751	NR	akbreezo	6/9/13 11:40 AM	1.370778E12	Need help with dual wireless networks	Hi all, I'm hoping I can explain what we are trying to do without sounding like a complete idiot. Doubtful. We have a wireless signal in our house that comes through a service provided router. The troubles come when we try to get internet to our shop which is separate from the house and a couple hundred feet away. We have tried a wireless repeater with no success. My husband ran CAT5 such that you can have a wired connection in the shop, but we cannot seem to get a wireless network to work through this connection. At my disposal I have the service provided router, a Linksys Wireless-G WRT54G V8, and a Uspeed Wireless-N Wi-Fi Repeater Access Point Range Extender . Any help would be most appreciated. Thanks!

I find repeaters to be too hard on folk. For example, the speed drop is bad enough but will folk place them in the correct locations? Bob
