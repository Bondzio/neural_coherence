2458	0	595892	5471217	NR	n4ught	6/25/13 3:59 PM	1.37217594E12	internetworking two routers	I have a DSL router/modem Actiontec M1000 from Qwest. It has a wifi dongle-bopper, and a single LAN port that I have connected to a TP TL-R860 router, to which I have connected all my hard wired devices. I need to be able to network the wireless devices connected to the Actiontec M1000 and the wired devices on the TPLink subnet. Details: Actiontec M1000 (with wifi dongle) WAN address assigned by PPPoE, irrelevant. LAN address 192.168.0.1 Wireless devices are on this 192.168.0.0 subnet. There is no way to assign IP addresses to specific devices, i.e. no DHCP reservations with this firmware. TPLink TL-R860 (no wifi) WAN address assigned by M1000, 192.168.0.2 LAN address 192.168.1.1 Hard wired devices are on this 192.168.1.0 subnet I can reserve DHCP addresses by MAC address. Questions: 1) I need to allow the wireless devices (laptops, tablet) on the M1000 network to access printers (Jetdirect networked HP 1320n) and devices (Pogoplug, Roku, desktops, etc.) I have added this route to the M1000: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0/192.168.0.2 But cannot connect from the wireless devices (192.168.0.0 subnet) to the wired devices (192.168.1.0) subnet. Is it even possible with my configuration? If so, what am I missing? 2) Since I cannot assign IP addresses on the M1000, can I set the DHCP IP range to say, 192.168.0.3-100, and set my TPlink router with a static WAN IP of 192.168.0.2? (So that IP is not assigned to another devices, and mess up the M1000 routing table.) Would the M1000 be &quot;aware&quot; of this setting? Can I add an entry to the routing table to make it aware? Notes of some relevance: I do not have the firewall or any security enabled on the TPLink router. I have no problem connecting to the internet with any devices. I previously have set the M1000 as a transparent bridge, and it worked fine and would continue to be so if not for the need of the wifi capability of the M1000. The TPlink router is wired-only. I have considered disabling DHCP on the TPLink router, having it act like a switch and getting addresses from the M1000, but I sorta need static, assignable addresses for my wired network. (Specifically for setting up a web server for Roksbox and Roku.) And, like I said, the M1000 is not capable of reserving DHCP addresses with this firmware.

I can't hold the full class on IP networking here but even with DHCP enabled nothing stops you from setting the IP addresses manually on a server. As to no wifi on the tplink, routers in my town start at 20 bucks so why not sell off that POC and get what you really want? Bob

Connect routers LAN to LAN (not WAN to LAN). Adjust the DHCP range on the Actiontec and set manual IPs on 192.168.0.x but outside the DHCP range on the devices that need it. All devices will then be on the same 192.168.0.x subnet. Should be a straightforward setup with no new equipment if that's what you're after.
