This is the way I also have managed to install the drivers for my 5.1 Digital (OEM).
But I'd like to install the AudioHQ and other Creative software too... With my &quot;old&quot; Live!
Value card everything was OK but this 5.1 Digital seems to be somehow strange... E.g.
WinXP detected the Value card and used correctly its MS drivers but did not with this 5.1.
