<s> We are in the process of migrating from Small Business Server 4.5 to Small Business Server 2003. </s>
<s> We have quite a range among the 20 or so workstations in our company; a couple of laptops with 512 MB RAM and 2.0-2.5 GHz processors, a slew of workstations in the 600MHz - 1.4 GHz range with 256 MB of RAM, and 4 Windows 98 SE computers with 400-600 MHz and 96 or 128 MB RAM (all the other computers are Win XP Pro SP2). </s>
<s> We had the network setup and the emails migrated and started to convert the workstations to the new domain. </s>
<s> We were very surprised to see how long it took to login. </s>
<s> Some of the computers took up to 10 minutes to log in, hanging on things like &quot;computer settings&quot; and &quot;personal settings&quot;. </s>
<s> It was not totally a function of speed and RAM, which the 2 laptops did come in the fastest, it still took about 3-5 minutes. </s>
<s> Surprisingly the Win 98 computers were next, at about 5-7 minutes (though they would also crash a lot after using the network a bit), then the rest of the Win XP machines. </s>
<s> When we reverted the machines back to the old domain they logged in quickly like they used to. </s>
<s> The guy who helped me setup the network thinks simply getting all the computers to 512MB of RAM (and replacing the 4 Win 98 computers, which was being planned anyway) will magically fix this, but I'm somewhat skeptical. </s>
<s> Could it be something about the new network/server? </s>
<s> Or 2 SBS machines running at once? </s>
<s> Any thoughts on what to look for are welcome, thanks. </s>
<s> You will find that as versions go up, so does the hardware requirements. </s>
<s> Nothing new here. </s>
<s> If you must keep old hardware you don't want the new OS. </s>
<s> The machines that crash are telling however. </s>
<s> Crashing machines can be murder on your bottom line. </s>
<s> Moreso than a new non-crashing machine. </s>
<s> Repairs on such (here) cost more than a new machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The fact that even the laptops had some amount of delay makes me think it's more than that (though upgrading would certainly help)? </s>
<s> I saw one forum that mentioned something about setting DNS for your local server vs. that of your ISP being part of the problem. </s>
<s> Again, while the Win 98 computers were definitely set for replacement anyway, just want to make sure; we don't want to buy upgrade everything else and still have the same issue, thanks. </s>
<s> If you see a lot of local hard disk access, then more RAM may help. </s>
<s> Then again, it's quite rare to see Windows machines with up to date BIOS and drivers. </s>
<s> The crash is abnormal and a clue that something is wrong. </s>
<s> Our old machines never crashed on boot like that. </s>
<s> We had to push them very hard. </s>
<s> I would not upgrade a crashing machine. </s>
<s> Adding ram will not stop the crash. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Wow, that was fast! </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm thinking more of what in our company are the &quot;middle&quot; machines; I'm pretty sure with the 4 crashing computers they are too slow for the new network. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Something is amiss with those machines. </s>
<s> We didn't crash even on 98se connecting to 2003 server. </s>
<s> But then again we we pretty in tune with BIOS, drivers, no spyware, pests etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 2 of the 4 machines had problems (not nearly as severe) on the old network. </s>
<s> And as I said, I had plans to replace them not long after the network upgrade, so now I'll just replace them before. </s>
<s> But again, I'm wondering what the issue is with the Win XP Pro machines..... </s>
