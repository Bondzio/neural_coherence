<s> Greetings. </s>
<s> I'm planning to build a new computer, or rather to upgrade a new bare-bones PC, because I don't trust myself to put everything together. </s>
<s> I've done a barebones before, but not a video card, sound card, or RAM. </s>
<s> I'm looking to buy a barebones from Cybertron PC- with: 400 watt power supply AMD Athlon 64 3000+ NC Pcchips M871G S754 V/A/L ST Motherboard onboard video onboard sound 10/100 network card Firewire card I'm also planning on buying: two 250GP SATA 7200RPM Hard Drives DVD+/-RW Drive DVD-Rom drive 5.1 PCI Sound card two sticks of PC2700 DDR 1GB RAM ATI All-In-Wonder 128 MB 9600 8X AGP Video Card I already have the 5.1 speakers, a VGA/DV-I Monitor, mouse and keyboard. </s>
<s> I've had a lot of experience with DVD and HD Drives, and only little experience installing RAM and PCI Drives, so I'm hesitant to buy all of these items at once. </s>
<s> Just by looking over this, does it make sense to buy? </s>
<s> I'm looking to be able to input and output TV video, as well as burn DVDs, and run many applications, possibly on two monitors. </s>
<s> I have done all this before to some degree with the exception of TV out/in-put. </s>
<s> I'm especially hesitant about installing the Video Card. </s>
<s> For instance, if I installed that card, would I be able to plug a VGA monitor into the VGA port of the motherboard? </s>
<s> I can only assume so. </s>
<s> And what exactly is the middle squarish port in the middle of the video card, as pictured here: &quot; http://us.st7.yimg.com/store1.yimg.com/I/directron_1870_2728961&quot;? </s>
<s> Sorry if this is too long, but I'd appreciate any advice offered. </s>
<s> You could proceed with that setup, but there are far better options available. </s>
<s> Key points: * My primary computer has an AMD Athlon64 3300+ processor, which is almost a year old, and was only considered average then. </s>
<s> Since technology is always advancing, I wouldn't settle for an Athlon64 3000+, as it is already nearing it's end of life. </s>
<s> (AMD has already cut the 3000+ from it's pricing charts.) </s>
<s> * The motherboard listed is socket 754, while AMD has recently switched to socket 939. </s>
<s> This means you'll find the possibilities of upgrading the processor in the future very limited. </s>
<s> * The current standard for RAM is DDR400 PC3200, with DDR2 gaining ground. </s>
<s> If you want to look towards the future, go in that direction. </s>
<s> However, I'd suggest not going less than PC3200, as PC2700 is reserved for older models and budget systems. </s>
<s> * If you click here , Cybertron PC lists the power supply as 350W, not 400W. </s>
<s> * The squarish plug on the ATI 9600 is the standard ATI adapter port. </s>
<s> You plug the included cable into it, which splits off into 2 VGA connections, the audio cable, and I believe one other. </s>
<s> (It's been a while since I've had it.) </s>
<s> However, you may want to read the reviews of the AIW 9600, including the one where I wrote of numerous software and driver issues. </s>
<s> Personally, I think you might be better off looking through the flyers for a computer as opposed to buying the barebones system and adding onto it. </s>
<s> You'll probably be able to find one on sale with an AMD Athlon 3500+ processor (socket 939), 1GB of PC3200 DDR (or even DDR2) RAM, DVD burner, DVD-ROM, and 200-250GB SATA drive for under $700. </s>
<s> (HP and Emachines are typically the best deals.) </s>
<s> That will give you more power and future upgradability for just slightly more. </s>
<s> Then all you have to do is add your seond hard drive and audio/video cards. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John P.S. </s>
<s> To my knowledge, there's no way for you to use the motherboard's VGA port while using the video card. </s>
<s> However, since the AIW 9600 supports dual monitors, that shouldn't be a problem. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I've posted in other places on the Internet, and I rarely get anything more than ''PCChips ist teh SuXoRz!'' </s>
<s> and no further direction. </s>
<s> The advice I have basically has made me abandon what I really wanted to do, because I apparently don't understand enough about chipsets, motherboard companies, and types of RAM, I shouldn't be allowed to touch the inside of a computer. </s>
<s> But I do know that I want around 500 GBs of HD space, a lot of RAM, a DVD drive with a separate dual-layer, dual format lightscribe burner, and a video card that lets me input and output TV. </s>
<s> Beyond that, I just want a good computer that works, not the pure performance that I think most are thinking of. </s>
<s> The biggest thing I'm worried about is the video card. </s>
<s> I think I can handle everything else, providing the other parts are compatable. </s>
<s> If I bought an Emachine or HP, I still wouldn't know exactly what video card to buy. </s>
<s> FInd someone who will build your computer. </s>
<s> Preferrably a friend or family member who is enthusiastic and know what they're talking about. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> Check out this link. </s>
<s> Any PC YOU build will be better than an Emachine or Dell. </s>
<s> http://www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html I usualy use MSI or Gigbyte MB socket 939. </s>
<s> 2 sticks of 512mb DDR-PC3200 memory and the fastest processor you can afford. </s>
