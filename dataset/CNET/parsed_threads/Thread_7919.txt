<s> Hey guys, I have a slightly urgent problem, I changed the CMOS of my Acer Veriton 1000 now when I power on the PC, the power light comes on but nothing else works. </s>
<s> Here's a link to the PC specs: http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/0000/Acer/Veriton1000/Veriton1000sp2.shtml The problem with this mini-computer is that the CMOS battery is placed at the bottom of the motherboard. </s>
<s> So in order to get it, I had to dismantle the entire PC to it's bare bone to get to the battery. </s>
<s> I should note here that the battery was in a plastic-like tube with the wiring connected to it. </s>
<s> I had to break the plastic casing off to remove the battery from the wires and then stuck the new battery to the wires with some masking tape! </s>
<s> I wasn't sure if it would cause a problem, but considering it would act as an insulator I figured I shouldn't worry about it. </s>
<s> Then I put the entire system back together, and like I said, the power like comes on, but that's about it. </s>
<s> The screen says there's no signal and when I connect a usb device like a keyboard or mouse, the lights on the devices don't come on. </s>
<s> I don't want to have to buy a new machine because I changed the battery incorrectly. </s>
<s> I do know also that the information I'm giving is fairly limited to the problem I have. </s>
<s> If someone is willing to help a (stupid) lost soul, I'll take apart my machine again and take some pictures of each process. </s>
<s> I've pretty much by hearted the process having opened it up and changed the battery wires from positive to negative, changing the battery back to the original, etc. </s>
<s> You have no idea how thankful I will be! </s>
<s> Recheck your work. </s>
<s> Even if this a PITA, you need to do it. </s>
<s> No amount or hemming and hawing is going to work for you, If the wiring was soldered on more firmly attached, solder all back on and be sure, that +, is positive and -, is negative. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted and check the surrounding area for any damage. </s>
<s> It appears while you got power the CMOS or bios really isn't active. </s>
<s> Also, be sure to inspect thew wiring as in where it goes beyond the battery is OK. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I was finally able to solder the new battery onto the wires, and unfortunately, that didn't solve my problem. </s>
<s> For now I'm replacing my computer with another, but still keeping this one to see if it can be fixed... </s>
<s> Sorry, to hear of the negative results. </s>
<s> Not knowing all the details(pictures) it may provide some clue. </s>
<s> Understand there maybe small connections or harness unconnected in small way or somehow compromised. </s>
<s> Attention to detail becomes very important and also if any &quot;short&quot; is present, can you power, &quot;ON&quot; with case open or adjust to do this to check results? </s>
<s> Since, it come down to playing with it. </s>
