1.1.1	I just got a new Dell XPS 410 with the E6600 Processor , 2 GB RAM , Nvidia 7900GS Video Card , etc ... Has anyone added another 7900GS successfully without changing the power supply ?	Ques
1.1.2	What exactly is needed to run an SLI set up .	St
1.1.3	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.4	Also , would the performance increase warrant doing this upgrade ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If the model # was SLI ready , then Dell would have mentioned it was .	St
1.2.2	If there is no mention do n't expect to become one later .	St
1.2.3	You need to visit the Dell support website and look up your model or S/N # , enter it and see what your order was fulfilled as .	St
1.2.4	Again , no SLI mentioned , not SLI ready .	St
1.2.5	SLI , needs extra power and the similar dual gpu cards to have SLI operation .	St
1.2.6	Of course the mtrbd .	St
1.2.7	must support all this .	St
1.2.8	Info here : http : //www.slizone.com/object/slizone2_build.html tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info !	St
1.3.2	Going to check website now .	St
1.3.3	So far the Geforce one says my card is compatible , but need to find out if the mb and power supply are .	St
1.3.4	If anyone else has some experience using SLI on their XPS 410 , please let me know !	Ques
1.3.5	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	'the Dell support website and look up your model or S/N # , enter it and see what your order was fulfilled as . '	St
1.4.2	... and what the system options/capabilities are .	St
1.4.3	Alternatively you cold open the box and check for PCIe slots ... if there are n't two ... Sli wo n't be an option for further consideration regardless of the PSU issue .	St

1.5.1	I just bought an XPS 410 , and would like to replace the power supply with something better .	St
1.5.2	Did you end up buying a new one , and if so , which one ?	Ques
1.5.3	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	So has anyone found out if the PSU is upgradeable in the XPS410 ? ? ?	Ques
1.6.2	That will be the deal breaker for me .	St
1.7.1	you 'd have realized the XPS 410 has only one PCIe 16X slot , one PCIe 4X slot and one PCIe 1X slot .	St
1.7.2	All things considered , it 's not what I 'd call a good host or candidate for SLi .	St
1.7.3	The message is .	St
1.7.4	.	St
1.7.5	.	St
1.7.6	.	St
1.7.7	read before buying .	Polite
1.7.8	Much easier to read before buying and avoid the wrong purchase , than to buy and regret .	St
1.7.9	These docs are just too readily available and accessible to make such errors .	St
1.7.10	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	I have a dell dimension 410 and have upgraded the psu to a 500W , you have to find a dell compatible one though and they are sold through pc power and cooling ( a subsidary of ocz ) here http : //www.pcpower.com/products/power_supplies/dell/	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	Be careful of the dates but thanks for the update .	Polite
1.10.2	As the machines age you will find you need a new power supply , DVDRW drive and other parts to keep it alive .	St
