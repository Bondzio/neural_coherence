Hi, for some weeks now, Im searching for a solution to stream live video from a wearable device (glasses, headset) to a windows system for recording.
Requirement is complete freedom from &lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;any LAN.
Most promising possibility yet seems to be the looxcie camera http://www.looxcie.com/ .
The android market app promisis an integration into browsers to come soon: ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.looxcie.live.android&amp;feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwMiwiY29tLmxvb3hjaWUubGl2ZS5hbmRyb2lkIl0 ) Currently it seems to be streaming from mobile to mobile only, though.
Whats interesting is that even the CIA starts to get interested in the device, as the spend a lot of money on it recently ( http://www.businessinsider.com/25-cutting-edge-companies-funded-by-the-central-intelligence-agency-2012-8?op=1 ).
Thanks for replies .
