you cannot link program shortcuts from one drive to another as the programs are installed and registered to the os on the drive.
however, you can install both completely working drives and run them independently by switching through the bios when you start or restart the pc.
i do this myself.
if you plug your me drive into one already working with win2k, you will need to configure the hardware, load the necessary drivers, etc.
once done, you can select which drive to operate from.
i prefer this to partitioning and loading multiple oss on a single drive.
