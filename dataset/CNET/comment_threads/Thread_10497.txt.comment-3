I have been doing development for a few years now and I have always used the same laptop, I think that it is only if you want to get into rendering high end graphics really quickly that you will need a good graphics card, I would recommend: -Medium Spec Graphics Card (512mb Nvidia) -2GB of RAM -Good Cooler for those long nights error solving -Reasonable Hard drive -32-bit operating system because 64bit isn't very widely used yet -2Ghz+ Processor -Good Keyboard (They wear down quickly !!!)
-Doesn't matter about the mouse -Clear monitor And your set for a very long time, Have fun, OdD_jOb
