1.1.1	I 'm getting a new computer , and use it mostly for music recording ( ACID or the like ) and video editing ( short teaching vids with Sony Vegas ) , as well as general Internet use/downloading .	St
1.1.2	No gaming .	St
1.1.3	Will this setup be OK ?	Ques
1.1.4	I 'm a massive user of computers but for some reason know nothing about what 's inside one .	St
1.1.5	Here 's what I have written up by the dude who 's building it : CPU - Intel Q8300 ( 2.5 ) RAM - Samsung 2G 6200 ( 2 of these ) Motherboard - Asus P5Q SE2 VGA - Ati HD 4670 HDD - Samsung 1TB ODD - LG H22NS 30 Case - Able A201 Power Supply - Aone 500W Monitor - Esys Ex2201W Some of this stuff I 'm not even sure about what it is , but I do know that it 's got a ton of space on the hard drive and it seems pretty fast .	St
1.1.6	So far the bill 's $ 975 won .	St
1.1.7	Does that seem about right ?	Ques
1.1.8	I 'll also be getting a nice soundcard for recording , though I 'm not sure what kind just yet ( any recommendations ? ) .	St
1.1.9	By the way , I 'm in Seoul , Korea , so that 's why I 'm using Asian products .	St
1.1.10	I trust Samsung ; not sure about the other brands .	St
1.2.1	CPU : architecture and name have nothing in common .	St
1.2.2	AMD64 is the same- x86_64- no matter who makes it .	St
1.2.3	RAM : This depends on the board manufacturer and BIOS .	St
1.2.4	Again , name does n't matter .	St
1.2.5	Graphics card support is also dependent upon the library being used .	St
1.2.6	I am a user of computers and of multiple operating systems .	St
1.2.7	Glorified specs and the hype behind them are useless to me .	St
1.2.8	Really , you should learn about computers .	St
1.2.9	It would be very easy for someone to screw you in a way you wo n't enjoy .	St
1.2.10	Fast ?	Ques
1.2.11	Wow !	St

1.3.1	Buying Asian parts is practically a mute point as most computer parts are from the Pacific Rim area .	St
1.3.2	Just buy what you feel comfortable with and best warranty if any .	Ques
1.3.3	Your system looks very capable , I see nothing that stands out as an issue from the h/w .	St
1.3.4	Do n't count on speed as a system measure , its more of the guts that can crunch all this in a reasonable time .	St
1.3.5	However , you need to consider the OS ( you did n't mention ) , thus a 64-bit one is better for you as you 're using video or audio editing , etc , into the mix .	St
1.3.6	XP or Vista 64-bit is probably a good choice and you can add more ram should the need arise .	St
1.3.7	I do n't like to give advice on specs of an system has usually that 's a done deal .	St

1.3.9	adios -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	First thing I see , power supply , would jack it up a little , 500w is less than I would go , 600w or better .	St
1.5.1	probably you may want to keep a look out for a good sound card for audio and a dedicated card will take the processing load off the main procesor , but if for basic audio , asus ' in-built is just fine .	St
1.5.2	With regards to samsung , they are one of the small number of memory chip manufacturer for most other brands ( besides hynix ) for crucial , kingston and patriot , thus that 's not an issue .	St
