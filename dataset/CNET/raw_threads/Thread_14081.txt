I formatted a new hard drive that is suppose to be 250 gb, but all I can see is 31.4 gb. I can't even see the extra 220 unallocated gb with any programs. Any one know what's wrong?

If XP, what service pack? If you formated it using FAT32, then try repartitioning and formatting as NTFS. A link: http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/index.html

I went here... http://www.unicore.com/ and ran their BIOS info program and ordered an upgrade - quite reasonably priced - they will issue you with a guarantee list of what the new BIOS will do for you. I can now see 137GB but my PC is still too old to see any more. You may be able to see more of your new HDD but you may be looking at a PC upgrade before seeing all of it. Good luck.

See if the hard drive is detected correctly there. If it comes up as the right size then the problem is with windows. If it comes up as the wrong size update your bios by going to the motherboard manufacturers website. If the problem is with windows firstly make sure you have windows updated, SP2 and all that (assuming you have xp). Then go to the hard drive manufacturers website and there should be a downloadable utility on there that allows windows to detect large hard disks (called big drive enabler or some such...) Hope this helps Tim

You may need to purchase Vcom Partition Commander(external program) to get use of the 250gb. When win XP formats a hard drive it sets aside a small portion for boot. Also if you don't tell winXP to format it all it won't. Hope this helps.

You can try and go to the hard drives website and see if they have a small hard drive program that will automatically setup your hard drive for you to run on your system. Most of the hard drive companies have a program for this. Also check to make sure your System Bios is up to date. Many system Bios are not up to date, by the time you get the new pc up and running an update is already out. Hopefully your system is new enough to run large hard drives. If you submit more info as to the name of your hard drive, with model,the name of your PC (compaq 4300, IBM , ect.)name and model I can get you the info you need. JMH TRPost

I had the same thing happen to me when I was helping my dad build a new computer LAST year and that was the only way to fix the problem.
1809	11	201613	2173975	2173750	linkit	9/1/06 10:35 PM	1.1571501E12	Not True!	Formatting largr HD's into more than one partition is done all the time. I posted a link with many of the causes and solutions in the first reply to this thread. From that point onward, everyone has duplicated that information in one way or another.

It is much better to write that partitioning larger HD's into more than one partition is done all the time. The formatting, of course, comes after that.

1809	14	201613	2175818	2171959	Merranvo	9/3/06 2:13 AM	1.15724958E12	A note on bios upgrades	They should only be preformed in the utmost need... you see there is a chance that when you upgrade your bios that the flash transpher will be corrupt and if your bios does not have an backup copy of the original you are seriously screwed.

I think this solution would help you know what exactly is wrong. It happens due to mother board of jumper setting. You may check out more about this here: http://www.techpavan.com/2009/04/29/hard-disk-capacity-limits-to-32-gb-solution/
1809	18	201613	3034218	3034044	VAPCMD	4/28/09 7:25 PM	1.2409467E12	Your reply was to a post from 2006. . . too late to be of	any help I'm afraid. And according to your reference ..which is consistent with my experience, the limitation pertains to a jumper on the hard disk drive as indicated below...not the MB 2. Jumper Setting limiting Hard Drive Space A minimal mistake of inserting the jumper into hard disk jumper block will result in limiting the hard disk capacity to 32GB if HDD is of higher capacity or 2.1GB otherwise. The first and last jumper block confusion will lead to such problem. The first placement will be for Master, and last for limiting, users confuse it and find their hard drives limited to 32 GB. Refer to this diagram which illustrates the jumper usage in hard drives.
