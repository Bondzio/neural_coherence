I'm glad you sorted it all out.
Remember the &quot;ink monitoring pgm.&quot; is nothing more than estimate or approx.
of ink level.
Defeating or ignoring the new ink cart install(align.)
starts sometimes this issue and/or get out of whack and keeps wanting attention.
Even if not displayed, it has become a sore spot.
I wish the times i could carry another system with me on calls as laptop sits at home.
