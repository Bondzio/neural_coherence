<s> I acquired an older Dell Optiplex GX520 desktop version computer and decided to ramp it up a bit. </s>
<s> I put in a Samsung SSD and started to upgrade the RAM. </s>
<s> I put 4gb (2gbx2) but the computer started to freeze on boot-up. </s>
<s> I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit. </s>
<s> If I take out one ram and put in a different one 1gb total of 3gb, it starts up no problem. </s>
<s> I have just dealt with the 3gb. </s>
<s> Now I wanted to upgrade the video card since the on-board graphics were crappy. </s>
<s> I put in an HIX 5450 since it is the best PCI only card out there (this motherboard doesn't have a PCI express). </s>
<s> Now I am encountering the same problem with this as the RAM upgrade where it freezes on the windows start-up screen. </s>
<s> Any help would be great. </s>

<s> I find it reasonable before attempting anything with a Dell as in upgrades to be sure of the bios level. </s>
<s> More often that not, there can be quite a difference. </s>
<s> So, if you check and find A06 present and A11 available, do upgrade the bios and correctly follow instructions. </s>
<s> Next, exactly what are your Dell specs for your model# plus its SN# or use the service tag# to truly ID the product. </s>
<s> In other words don't settle for the Dell badge, know exactly what you have. </s>
<s> Then review the specs of your model# found. </s>
<s> The info can vary if an user simply accepts model# across the board does this and that and the model# can vary as model# -A is different from model# -D even though both are Dell model123. </s>
<s> There can be a major difference, so be 100% sure. </s>
<s> http://www.dell.com/support/Manuals/us/en/19/product/optiplex-gx520 http://www.dell.com/support/troubleshooting/us/en/19/Product/optiplex-gx520 I would for testing, disable or remove the virtual clonedrive. </s>
<s> upgrade the bios, and verify your GX520 actually can use 2gb ram per slot. </s>
<s> Also ram is best as in matched pairs. </s>
<s> Yes, Win7x64 can use above 4gb and/or can the intel P4(single core) really keep-up, if i suspect all of what your doing is pushing the cpu to its limits. </s>
<s> It maybe a &quot;bottleneck&quot; sort of problem. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I figured out the issue with the RAM and the new video card. </s>
<s> I needed to update my BIOS to work with them. </s>
<s> Once I upgraded to A11 it worked perfect!! </s>
<s> I had a little interesting time flashing the BIOS since I had window 7 x64. </s>
<s> But I had an extra HDD that had 32 bit windows xp, plugged it in, ran the flash and perfecto, it worked. </s>
<s> Today is going to be a good day, I can feel it. </s>
