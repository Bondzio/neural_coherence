<s> I have an HP Officejet Pro 8600 that I bought new about 6 months ago. </s>
<s> I bought an HP-branded 950XL Black cartridge for it and it just ran out of ink. </s>
<s> I refilled it using ink from a refill company that I've used many times over the years in other HP printers, and I followed the instructions on refilling it which included having to drill it through the little ball on the bottom to get ink into it & then plugging the hole, which worked out fine. </s>
<s> But when I try to print now, it says the cartridge is depleted. </s>
<s> Here's what all I've tried --- I've been told this printer has a menu item that says &quot;Cartridge Chip Information&quot; that would allow me to stop it from checking the cartridge chip, but mine doesn't, so I'm guessing that's an older model. </s>
<s> While searching for a solution, I noticed that at least one other person has the same problem with not having that menu item & they never found any help for it either. </s>
<s> I tried reinstalling the printer & the software, but no luck. </s>
<s> I also tried the alleged factory reset method, but it doesn't work; that's where you turn it off, wait 10 secs, then turn it back and press the leff arrow 4 times when it first comes on. </s>
<s> I tried this at various points that might constitute the generic phrase &quot;when it first comes on&quot;, including when the green power button lights up, when the HP splash screen starts, when the PC gives me a notification that it recognizes the printer is on, and after the main menu comes up, all to no avail. </s>
<s> FYI, there's nothing in user manual about resetting anything except the network info. </s>
<s> I also couldn't access the alleged &quot;secret menu&quot;. </s>
<s> I also tried unplugging it & replugging it in, also cutting off the power source abruptly at the surge supressor I use, both with no luck. </s>
<s> If there is no workaround on this, I'm getting rid of it & will look for another inkjet printer that can copy/scan/print & will allow me to use either remanufactured OEM cartridges or generic cartridges to refill on my own. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for one that will give me little problem with that & will run on Windows 7 Ultimate OS? </s>
<s> I've done a lot of research on this today and it seems that you can't swap out or reset an HP OEM cartridge chip anymore, but you don't need to. </s>
<s> The trick is simply to use 2 OEM cartridges. </s>
<s> You can't refill one & put it right back in --- you have to use a different one, but you can swap them out each time. </s>
<s> Apparently the printer knows if the previous cartridge was put back into it, but it can only remember the last one, so if you use cartridge #1 & it goes empty, put cartridge #2 in, then when #2 empties, you put #1 (refilled) back in and it should work, and then refill & use #2 when the refilled #1 goes empty. </s>
<s> Note that I haven't tried this, but I saw more than 1 site that said it worked, including this YouTube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Rv7rnfnsg I'll try this and see what happens. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions (that truly work on this printer/cartridge) are welcomed. </s>
<s> I've seen that some HP inkjets can have their chip swapped out, but this generation of printers/cartridges seems to have caught on. </s>
<s> I imagine the next generation will blackball any cartridge that has ever been used anywhere, or the cartridge itself will go bad after the 1st use. </s>
<s> Too much money is riding on this for HP to not make an effort to thwart refills for good. </s>
<s> The only way it's going to change is for Congress or someone with deep pockets suing them to stop them from polluting the environment with empty cartridges & using monopolistic business practices to secure their profits. </s>
<s> Hi Did you find a Solution? </s>
