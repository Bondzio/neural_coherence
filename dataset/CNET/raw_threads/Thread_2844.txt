I suggest you hit the Clt+Alt+Del keys once and see what's running, and kill the tasks not required(leave MS ones) for the time being and allow the defragger a chance to finish. You can also, check the &quot;startup&quot; of files to see if you can disable during such defragging. If your systemtray is more than 3-4 icons present, check them to disable, try one at a time for best operation. Check into areas... good luck -----Willy

Hint: You posted in the &quot;PC Hardware Forum.&quot; For Windows 9x/ME this article covers it all -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/?id=222469 This applies to defragmenting as well as scandisk. What I often see is any number of responses that contain bits and pieces of what's in this article, but why not have it all. In closing, if you feel this is a hardware issue, tell about what hardware issue you have. Bob

Then run Defrag. When finished, shut down and restart, and computer will boot normally.
