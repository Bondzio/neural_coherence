Over in our Storage forum the most succesful recovery is when the owner opens the USB casing and moves the drive into another case.
However if you've been very good about backups you can make it a warranty issue and let them have it.
Example case for IDE drives at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817716010 Example case for SATA drives at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817173043 Sorry no.
I can't guess if it's the case but it's the cheap part you want to replace if you want a shot at getting to the files again.
