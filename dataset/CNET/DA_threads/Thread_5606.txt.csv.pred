1.1.1	I finally tried to build my first computer today with the parts listed below , but when I try to turn on the computer , nothing happens .	St
1.1.2	I disconnected all the peripherals from the PSU to eliminate that as a problem , but it still wo n't start .	St
1.1.3	When I initially flip the switch for the PSU , the lights on my keyboard ( Caps lock and the like ) flash for a second , but then when I hit the power button on the case , it does n't turn on .	St
1.1.4	The PSU never makes a noise and the fan does n't move .	St
1.1.5	I thought this might be because I only used 2 out of the 3 cables that you ca n't detach from the PSU ( the website says that all & quot ; non-vital & quot ; cables are detachable , so maybe I need to use all 3 of these & quot ; vital & quot ; cables ? ) .	Ques
1.1.6	I used the 8 pin CPU connector and the 24 pin main power connector , but am not using the 4 pin CPU connector since there is nowhere on the motherboard to put it .	St
1.1.7	Do the lights on the keyboard mean the PSU works and I 'm just doing something wrong or is the PSU dead ?	Ques
1.1.8	Or is it something else entirely , like the motherboard being dead ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite

1.2.1	If proper connections are made it should work .	St
1.2.2	Its important to review the manual and verify the connections are going to where they need to go .	St
1.2.3	Also , the frt .	St
1.2.4	panel power-ON/OFF harness si proper .	St
1.2.5	You can remove the harness and using a small screwdriver or metal contact , short the contact for a split sec .	St
1.2.6	and see if it powers-ON .	St
1.2.7	That way yu know at least the proper contact was active .	St
1.2.8	Next , check the video connection , if not on video car or on-board is connected , that way at least a flash may appear or not bit indicates power again is present .	Sug
1.2.9	The monetarily flash you see1st powering-ON is only the surge and means only power is present BUT not active ( ON ? OFF ) status .	St
1.2.10	Alas , not cables/harness need be connected , if all that are required are connected .	St
1.2.11	New PSUs come ready for various setups and thus not all are needed .	St
1.2.12	Check and verify all is fully seated and OK , take your time .	St
1.2.13	You need to make a simple ( basic ) system , only enough to power-ON the system .	St
1.2.14	If that does n't work , again some connection is n't pressnt or misconnected .	St
1.2.15	Of course , if all else fails , you can then though the status of components being OK , swap and replace .	St
1.2.16	Google for bad caps or such and look for exmaples at www.badcaps.com .	St
1.2.17	-OR- a troubleshooting chart giving ideas to check following the chart .	St
1.2.18	You ca n't take anything for granted .	St
1.2.19	If possible test compnets elsewhere .	St
1.2.20	You did n't mention what wattage PSU was , is it better than 400W and a decent name brand ?	Ques
1.2.21	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	No need to double post .	St
1.3.2	I will lock this so you can concentrate on your other thread here ; http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7586_102-0.html ? messageID=3378713 # 3378713 It avoids confusion and duplication .	Sug
