<s> I want to upgrade my mother board because I have found that I have an off brand and I would like to upgrade my video card. </s>
<s> I don't however want to have to buy new memory or a processor. </s>
<s> I have an Intel Pentium 2.6 ghz processor. </s>
<s> And i have ddr sdram. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what mother board I could get. </s>
<s> Can ddr and ddr2-dimm ram run in the same motherboard? </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> There are boards that have both type sockets but none allow installing more than 1 type. </s>

<s> Ok so is ddr sdram the same as just ddr? </s>
<s> When I am looking for motherboards. </s>
<s> You can narrow it down with the pin count and form factor. </s>

<s> What motherboard do you already have? </s>
<s> What video card do you already have? </s>
<s> What do you want to be able to do with the new video card? </s>
<s> Download and run CPU-Z (cpuid.com) to learn the manufacturer name and model number of your current motherboard. </s>
<s> You should have a socket 478 CPU with a Northwood core (confirm this with CPU-Z). </s>
<s> That means you need to start your search by looking at socket 478 motherboards that support a P4 (not just Core Solo or Core Duo CPUs). </s>
<s> I only knew of three socket 478 P4 motherboards that had a PCI Express slot, they weren't the greatest boards, and they are getting difficult to find these days. </s>
<s> You should still be able to find some good boards with i865 or i875 chipsets and AGP 8X video slots. </s>
<s> Another option that will allow you to keep your DDR memory is to move to a socket 939 AMD CPU & motherboard; but, if you are going to spend that much money, I'd just bite the bullet and build a complete Core 2 Duo system. </s>
<s> Got to this site via google. </s>
<s> Hope someone can help. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> My Dell Dimension 2350 cannot be upgraded to accept a x16 PCI express. </s>
<s> I plan to build my own via Tiger or Egg. </s>
<s> My question is: after removing the hard drive, floppy and CD r/w, will I be able to place them in any ATX case, or does it have to be a micro ATX. </s>
<s> Also, will the hard drive (with my windows XP be automatically usable in the new machine? </s>
<s> It was preloaded on the Dell. </s>
<s> It didn't come with its own OS disk--just a restore disk. </s>
