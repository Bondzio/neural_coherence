<s> I currently have Belkin n+ router that drops the signal every 40s. </s>
<s> All computers have this. </s>
<s> They stay connected but can not navigate the internet. </s>
<s> browsing the web i see other people have this problem. </s>
<s> whatever. </s>
<s> I want a router that works. </s>
<s> Decent speeds and reliable. </s>
<s> Definitely not a Belkin. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Is that every 40 seconds? </s>
<s> Is the firmware up to date? </s>
<s> Tried a reset? </s>
<s> D-link DIR-655. </s>
<s> When you read the forums you will find people have the exact complaint as yours on every brand of equipment. </s>
<s> There are so many models and even within those models many many variations on hardware and firmware revisions. </s>
<s> So just because someone says I have no issues with a brand of router someone else may because they are not exactly the same router. </s>
<s> I would try firmware update first, many manufactures rather than send a update to their factory put the burden on the customer. </s>
<s> You will find routers that were manufactured only months ago have software that is years old. </s>
<s> This old software sometimes is based on standards before 802.11N was certified so it is not 100% compatible. </s>
<s> You have one of the major brands if you want another brand you can try linksys or netgear. </s>
<s> The vast majority have no issues but you never know. </s>
<s> yes the firmware is up to date, and the thing is I have seen even more reports of drops from belkin routers than anything else. </s>
<s> yes is the answer to all your questions </s>
