<s> Anybody run across this? </s>
<s> I have four computers all operating from a home router. </s>
<s> All have the same Windows 2000 and network configuration. </s>
<s> They can all &quot;talk&quot; to each other (browse or map a drive) except for one. </s>
<s> This one will map to the other computers, but the other computers cannot map to this one. </s>
<s> Attempts just say Network path not found, or something like that. </s>
<s> Whenever the other 3 computers have connection issues, rebooting one of them usually solves it. </s>
<s> Not this one. </s>
<s> I've looked at all the network configs and can't see any difference. </s>
<s> This one computer does have one other network issue. </s>
<s> It can't connect to a dialup ISP. </s>
<s> Gets some protocol missing error. </s>
<s> I tried deleting and reinstalling the TCP stack but that caused worse problems, and had to restore the whole system. </s>
<s> All these machines are different hardware, but identical OS's and Windows updates. </s>
<s> My last resort is a clean install, which I'm not looking forward to. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> Well, none of the &quot;fixes&quot; had any effect. </s>
<s> I could have sworn connecting to this machine worked at one time. </s>
<s> Although none of the other machines have a recently used map to this machine. </s>
<s> I probably just need to reload anyway. </s>
<s> It's been a while. </s>
<s> I just hate getting everything back the way I want it. </s>
<s> It's such a pain. </s>
<s> I've been debating going to XP anyway. </s>
<s> But the thought of &quot;registering&quot; with MS galls me. </s>
