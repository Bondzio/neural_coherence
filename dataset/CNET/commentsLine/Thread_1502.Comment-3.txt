ram is referred to by 2 different means ie: pc2700 = 333 mhz (or ddr333) you'd be best to go to  and use the on-line scan to determine your needs.
spend some time on that site to get an underatnding of ram designations.
a google never hurt either!!
and yes it does matter - you need the excact ram!
and no, i never heard of a motherboard that will support both sdram & ddr ram (sdram is for older machines - like 5yrs & older.)
