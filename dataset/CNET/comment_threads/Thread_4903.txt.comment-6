In my experience this happens when the account printing does not have admin rights on the PC that the printer is installed on.
Try it with 2 accounts on the same PC (remove the colour cart) and try forcing it to black.
You will find that if you dont have admin privileges in uses the colour cartage no matter what.
I dont consider sticking users in a local admin group so they can print, a valid fix but it might help you.
