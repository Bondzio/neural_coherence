Read http://www.tomshardware.com/column/20011012/index.html Frankly, this power supply is suitable for the up to 1 GHz class of machines.
Yes, it might work for awhile, but as a test I'd slip in a 450W to see if power is the issue as well as removing all drives.
Nothing but motherboard, CPU/HSF, RAM and a video card.
Not much else is needed to see a screen display.
Why so small a supply?
Have you read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/index.html and such articles?
