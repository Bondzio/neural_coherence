everyone here seems to be well versed in the online persuit of computer hardware, so here is my question: where is the best place to buy a complete system online?
my concerns in order of importance are price, customization, and customer service.
i'm a casual gamer, at least moderate performance is a must.
i have shopped around at various places, but i want to make sure i'm getting the best deal i can.
thank you in advance for any info/ideas.
