<s> Hi, I want to build a wireless home network to connect 4 desktop computers, 2 notebook computers, 1 laser printer and 1 network-attached storage (NAS) with ethernet connection. </s>
<s> The 2 main objectives of building the network are (1) to enable data sharing among all devices and (2) to share the internet connection via the single internet connection given by the ISP. </s>
<s> Please give me the hardware need and connections. </s>
<s> also, suggestion of the hardware brand and model is the best. </s>
<s> More thanks. </s>
<s> which begins with a wireless router and wireless adapters. </s>
<s> Most consumer oriented products will serve your purpose, the Sunday circulars are full of them. </s>
<s> You might want to use one makers products as tech support becomes easier if needed. </s>
