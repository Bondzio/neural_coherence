I have checked this forum and found the same problem as mine!!
but the information I want is not there ?
When i have my comp on and then put my laptop on i get this message what i want to know is what is causing this and how can i fix it ?
is it something to do with the IP address on my desktop or laptop not set to automatic ?
if so how do i get to the place to put things right?
i am running windows XP PRO on both comps, i dont know what other information you may need but if you do kindly please ask and i will supply willingly ?
Thank you for any help.
