7987	0	284307	2706684	NR	Pezonator	2/16/08 10:56 PM	1.20320256E12	Upgraded system randomly crashes on the net	Hi, I hope this is in the right section I recently upgraded my AMD socket 939 Mobo from an Athlon 3500 and Radeon X1650pro to a dual core AMD 4200 with a Thermaltake Blue Orb2 fan and Radeon X1950pro. I also installed a fresh copy of my Windows XP Home and it's fully updated (this was a few days after I installed the new stuff, hoping it would fix the problem). Problem: The old system ran fine, no crashes whatsoever. After I installed the new components and installed the catalyst 7.10 &quot;driver only&quot; on the system, it would just randomly crash (with the old XP). Whether is be trying to install software, playing a game, looking at pictures and videos or browsing the net. So I then installed a fresh Windows and the catalyst 8.2 control centre and driver, which is what i'm using now. It has fixed it to some degree, so I can now play games and install stuff. But on a random website or trying to save a random picture or even watching a youtube video, it will either freeze or the monitor will turn off or it will say &quot;out of range&quot; and then restart. It is a clean install of Windows, 2 weeks old. And the BIOS settings are exactly the same as with the X1650 which worked fine. I know it may be a stability issue or a setting I must change in the bios, but I have no idea what the problem actually is. My system is as follows: ASUS A8V deluxe M/B, AGP 8x, socket 939, bios 1017 (latest) AMD Athlon X2 4200+ ATI Radeon X1950pro Windows XP Home SP2 fully updated 750Watt TT PSU I would really appreciate any help. Games fly, but I surf the net just waiting for it to crash. I'm lucky I could write this message! Thanks PS. I was just about to press submit post and guess what it did... This time it said &quot;non-preset mode&quot; and just froze. Thank goodness for Firefox's restore

Do they match? Do you have the right one in the right slot? Run this diagnostics check: http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp The CPU did you install it correctly? Is it the right one for the board? How about the power supply is it big enough? This one is tough to diagnose: http://www.efficientpowersupplies.org/pages/Generalized_Internal_Power_Supply_Efficiency_Test_Protocol_R5.pdf 500 watts is the upper limit for most systems. Anything more then this is &quot;over kill&quot;. If you have a $5,000.00+ system this may apply.

7987	3	284307	2708098	2707260	Pezonator	2/18/08 8:08 PM	1.20336528E12	I'll try it	Thanks for the reply I didn't think about re-seating the RAM and video card, I will try this and let you know what happens. The CPU is in properly and matches the M/B, so that's fine. I also have 2GB of Geil DDR400 RAM (4x512MB), I've had these for over a year now and seem to work fine. The PSU is a ThermalTake 750Watt and is brand new. I'm beginning to think that the video card may be faulty.... I hope that's not the case.

7987	5	284307	2708200	2708118	Pezonator	2/19/08 1:08 AM	1.20338328E12	The thing is...	I've been thinking It can't be a problem with the memory or GPU because I can play games, listen to music and watch videos for hours without any problems.?/?-.- Thanks though, I'll do a memory test soon.

The temp is running pretty good, CPU is at 40 to 45 degrees and mobo at 23-27 degrees. The case is an Antec 900 which helps alot. I also changed the resolution colour to 16 bit, down from 32bit and it seems to be working fine, no crashes and I've been all over the web. So it might be fixed although it now looks pretty average, there might be some colour distortion. I'm not game enough to go back to 32bit Thanks guys

I then restarted and tried to change to 32bit colour, hit apply and it froze again. So i'm either thinking of changing the voltages and see how I go or go back to an earlier catalyst driver.

Here's another tip if you wrap your fan with rubber bands they run quieter. That around the out side of the fan cases not over the top of the fans, most figure that out, most.

I did change my AGP setting to 4x instead of 8x and it seems to be working ok. I have been on sites that have made it crash without trouble such as youtube. I think I'll just have to change to 4x mode when I'm surfing the net for a while and go back to 8x when playing games. Thanks for the help. If changing to 4x does not fix it, then I'll post here again
