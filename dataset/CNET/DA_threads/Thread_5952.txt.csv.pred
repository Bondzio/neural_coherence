1.1.1	Computer is running Windows ME.	St
1.1.2	Connected to a Netgear router along with five other computers.	St
1.1.3	Never had any problems, then the other day couldn't access internet.	St
1.1.4	I don't know if someone screwed around with the computer or if there is an Explorer corrupt file but the problem has been troubleshooted to this: - using winipcfg, the IP address is a # which it shouldn't be and I don't know how to change it.	St
1.1.5	It should be something like 192.168.0.4 but its not.	St
1.1.6	I am home now and don't have the actual address.	St
1.1.7	I tried releasing the address but when I press the button nothing happens.	St
1.1.8	I have no idea how the IP address changed but because of this, there is no communication with the router and thus no internet.	St
1.1.9	Some things I tried besides releasing the IP address are checking all settings in Network control panel.	St
1.1.10	They are as they should be.	St
1.1.11	I went to the routers address (192.168.0.1) and checked on attached devices.	St
1.1.12	This computer is no longer listed of course.	St
1.1.13	I pressed &quot;refresh&quot; but it still didn't show up.	St
1.1.14	I rebooted the router to no avail.	St
1.1.15	I need to determine why the computer IP address is locked and how to change it again.	St
1.1.16	any suggestions are greatly appreciated.	Polite
1.2.1	Howdy, I have the same issue, for about a week now.	St
1.2.2	Provider sent me a new modem, but I unlocked it by going into my providers supplied software and loading a prior configuration.	St
1.2.3	However once I did this I lost my CD drives and am now at a point where my system will not boot.	St
1.2.4	Outside of my computer not booting, which could have been done by me, I was not able to access the internet from my PC.	St
