sounds like you have either a driver conflict fault or, a driver problem, have you tried different versions of the driver?
are you running a raid setup h/d?
try pressing ctrl/alt/del and see what programmes are running in the back ground you may be suprised how much memory they take up!
also have you set your bois settings to use your max memory for your vid card, pallete snooping sometimes causes a conflict try turning it off if it has that option.
i had similar fault when i installed an x800xl, was down to driver/mobo conflict, did you buy the sys ready built or did you build it?
more sys info would be helpful
