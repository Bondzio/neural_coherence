Thanks for the info.
That was a bit suspicious, it didn't really make sense to me.
But who am I to question the infallible word of some lady in India?
Yeah, my main worry about the newer cards is that they would burn out as my little comp probably can't handle them.
But it's good to know I can move up to 128.
The 4200 has served me well, but I am starting to notice some limitations, and I am keeping this PC for the near future, so and upgrade is in order.
