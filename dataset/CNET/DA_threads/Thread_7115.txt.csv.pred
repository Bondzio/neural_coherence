1.1.1	I have a networking question .	St
1.1.2	I currently have 3 computers that seem to refuse to network to each other .	St
1.1.3	Computer one is a laptop with a 1.13 GHZ Pentium 3 , 256 MB of RAM and WinXP .	St
1.1.4	Computer two is a desktop with a 2.0 GHZ Pentium 4 , 512 MB of RAM and WinXP Computer three is a desktop with a 2.14 GHZ AMD AthlonXP 2600+ , 1,536 MB of RAM and WinXP .	St
1.1.5	I have a Netgear MR314 Broadband Router , and a 802.11B card for the laptop .	St
1.1.6	I had the two desktops networked ( wired ) 10/100 and it worked fine , until the AMD system went down ( PSU Problems ) after I fixed the AMD system the two desktops would n't network .	St
1.1.7	The Laptop has never worked with the card that was bought for it .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ( Netgear 's support thing would n't let me send the support e-mail , I mailed the Laptop Manufacturer ) I only care about getting all 3 to work because I want to share a Broadband Connection , and since I have the hardware I do n't plan on buying anything but a cable modem , here is my second question .	St
1.1.9	Should I buy a cable modem or let my ISP provide one for me ?	Ques
1.1.10	The local electronics store only had one overpriced , Motorola Model .	St
1.1.11	I looked on the web at Tigerdirect and Newgg .	St
1.1.12	Most of those modems seemed pretty expensive , around $ 50 .	St
1.1.13	Any help at all ...	St
1.2.1	You do not buy a cable modem , you let your connection provider supply it and connect your router to that .	Sug
1.2.2	You need to set fixed IP 's on the 2 desktops and the laptop and see if you can Ping the IP of the other systems while connected .	St
1.2.3	If you can ping then you can get the internet working , file sharing will also be possible .	St
1.2.4	When you connect up to the router select START/RUN type CMD and hit enter or OK. Then type IPCONFIG On each system .	St
1.2.5	What IP does it show your network card using on each system ?	Ques
1.2.6	You should get a different IP for each system , in the 192.168.x.x range .	St
1.2.7	If you do n't get that then the router is not handing out addresses .	St
1.2.8	You can hard code the address by going to TCP/IP properties for the network connection and specifying the IP .	St
1.2.9	Once you do that you can then ping the IP of the other system to see if you can see it on the network .	St
1.3.1	actually the AMD system is saying its IP is somthing like 4.227.22x.xxx Should I go and assign the IP addresses these machines had before they crashed ( I believe the other desktop retains its old IP , it just has a .1 or .2 and so on up to 4 ) I could just make each computer have the address it would have been given right ?	Ques
1.4.1	please ignore my other 2nd post .	Sug
1.4.2	It did n't read my network connection , it read my modem , my bad .	St
1.4.3	Ok the old desktop is getting the correct address from the Router .	St
1.4.4	The AMD has 2 network connection ports .	St
1.4.5	Neither of them can renew their IP address from the & quot ; Repair & quot ; button .	St
1.4.6	I can not ping the older computer .	St
1.4.7	Could you please be more descriptive on how to get into the screen to assign my computer an IP address .	Ques
1.4.8	Thank you	St
1.5.1	An IP like you mention makes no sense at all , no router would assign an IP like that .	St
1.5.2	You need to be working with the 192.168 range , so that it is private .	St
1.5.3	It could be your router has a problem , you might try resetting it and reconfiguring it , but the address you describe is not within the range handed out by any router I have seen , unless someone messed with it quite seriously .	St
1.5.4	Give one system an IP of 192.168.1.2 and the other 192.168.1.3 and see if you can ping one from the other .	St
1.6.1	To set the IP , Open Network connections in control panel , right click the Local Area Connection and select properties .	St
1.6.2	Double click on TCP/IP and you can set the IP address right there .	St
1.7.1	AMD based systems do n't network with just Microsoft 's offerings .	St
1.7.2	You get to download and install motherboard drivers and maybe LAN card drivers .	St
1.7.3	Easy to break by accepting a driver from Windows Update ( Hint : do n't ! )	St
1.7.4	The same story for the other machines .	St
1.7.5	Microsoft rarely gets the LAN driver proper .	St
1.7.6	In closing , any install of ZoneAlarm promptly kills off networking for new network builders .	St
1.7.7	They need to uninstall such and disable ICF until the network is up .	St
1.7.8	Also , home made cables are a no-no for beginners and seasoned builders know what issues a hand made cable brings .	St
1.7.9	Bob	St
