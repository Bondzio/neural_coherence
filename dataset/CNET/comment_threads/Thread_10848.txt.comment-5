I have all the firewall exceptions set to allow file and printer sharing, but still cannot see other computers in this wireless home network of three.
I am convinced that the problem has something to do with which XP services are enabled, although I was advised that NetBios was not required, only TCP/IP.
I have read the comments ridiculing the endeavours of some users in this forum who are attempting to tune a wireless network, and that rather puts me in the same boat, I fear.
