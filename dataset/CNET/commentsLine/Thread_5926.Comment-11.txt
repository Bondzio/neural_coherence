i'm using windows xp.
when windows was starting up after it loads a little it comes up with a blue screen.
mentions it had to stop due to error in the hard drive, may have virus or maybe corrupted.
it says to take it out and check it.
it also says something about run chkdsk/ f. i have no idea what that means
