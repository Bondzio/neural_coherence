I got a paper jam, which I cleared. I also canceled the printing job. The printer tells me to turn it off after I cleared it. But there is no power button, just a button to stop/clear settings. I pressed that, I pressed the start button, but all I get is flashing green lights. I've look carefully at the booklet, but there is no diagram showing all the parts of the printer. There has to be a power button somewhere. I checked the Epson troubleshooting page, but it's no help. I think I'm going crazy!!! Please help me.

It's slightly technical but it is one of the annoying things that I deal with every month. Here's a few articles about it. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=Stop+and+Delete+Print+Jobs+Windows+Vista%2FXP Pick the one you like. Bob

Honestly, you have to look over the unit and go from that. Otherwise, place on a power strip and shutdown 100% that way AFTER you allow it to go to sleep(idle). Basically, the ptr. is using a logic circuit to keep it ON/OFF as I suspect very much like a PC. If that's the case, check for any s/w feature to control that action. That's my best guess as so many printers out there. AND yes, IMHO that's not a good thing. Of course, you can pull the AC plug. tada -----Willy

If it blinks, etc. for some time allow it to do so, it should finally go OFF. However going OFF maybe more of going to sleep. The manual I quickly reviewed offers that up-to 5min. may pass before it shuts down or sleeps. That could also be related to any error condition as the blinking could refer to an error status(verify). FYI - Power button/switch have the universal symbol of a arched circle with a line and dot in it. Make notice of that on other PC devices, maybe the PC. tada -----Willy
