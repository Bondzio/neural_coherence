if dell made good computers, they and you would not have to brag about their tech support.
i currently have 2 acers...a desktop and a laptop.
no problems with either of them.
prior to that i had 2 gateway computers.
no tech support was needed on either of them, either.
guess those brands are better made than dell.
sorry, guy.
