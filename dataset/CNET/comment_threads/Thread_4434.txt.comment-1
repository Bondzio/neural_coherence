I have a secure wireless network.
About once or twice a day I see my wireless connection bar go down and down until I totally get kicked off my network.
The only way to fix it is to run upstairs and unplug the router and plug it back in.
This works until I have to go do it again, and again, and again.
There our some wireless networks around me and every time I get kicked off there is a new wireless network that I don't usual see.
Is it possible that this person and my network our on the same channel and when they get on I get kicked off?
I have tried going into the router settings and change the channel but that didn't seem to do the trick.
Anyone else have any ideas?
Thanks!
