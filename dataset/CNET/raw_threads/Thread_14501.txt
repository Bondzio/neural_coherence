I was just thought that after a year of heavy burning(dvd and cd) the burner would be dead but it seems okay. I did some research on the brand name of the drive-TSST Corp. Which is a joint venture between Toshiba and Samsung. The last firmware upgrade I got maybe fall of 2005, and none since. This is why I think maybe I should get a new burner, because they've stop giving updates, meaning that my burner is outdated. Maybe I'm over reacting, I guess if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Even if you got a new DVD burner, it may need an update so don't sweat it if no updates are available for you're current burner. &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; is alot of common sense. You have the option to replace in the future, cross-fingers good or bad. tada -----Willy
