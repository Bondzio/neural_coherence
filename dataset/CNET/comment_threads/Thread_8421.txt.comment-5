Is not the Westell unit a DSL gateway?
Typically that is what Verizon/Frontier furnishes, at least recently.
It is a combination unit wireless capable, modem/router in one unit, which would preclude the use of another router for general purposes.
Whereas if you were to use your Linksys unit you would use a separate modem.
The problem is DSL, your Linksys router is set up for use with a cable modem, which is a different ball game.
That is I guess you could say, a &quot;GOTCHA&quot; with Verizon/Frontier DSL hook ups since they are fed by a phone link instead of cable.
Is there a work around?
Well that's the question for Verizon/Frontier, I would love to hear their answer to this one.
It goes to firmware and of course hook up(s).
