i was just on hp's website.
they have applications you can run on your pc which should calculate when you are coming to the end-of-life on your ssd (maximum number of write cycles).
so, it that is worrying you, there are apps out there to give you fair warning.
check out cnet's download site.
i thought i saw some there too.
with fewer moving parts, ssds should last a long time but you need to look up the number of write cycles when comparing ssds in terms of brands and models.
the other suggestion is to make sure you have recent firmware in the drive, especially if you buy a drive used.
but that raises another question: if you buy a used ssd, how many write cycles would it have on it left?
