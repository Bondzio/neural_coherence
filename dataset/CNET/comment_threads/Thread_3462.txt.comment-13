Hey Linkit.
I found a copy of the original adapter set-up disk that I had burned, in my caotic pile of &quot;stuff&quot; in my bottom drawer.
I ran it and hey pres!
I'm back on net.
It confirms what I suspected: that drivers are sometimes not enough as the set-up disk holds other secrets.
So now I can sleep a bit more soundly:-) Thanks for your contribution.
Regards Stewart
