<s> hi everyone... i have a little bit of a problem, im very sorry for the inconvenience if you get this alot but ive tried really after reading other posts on how to successfully set up an ad hoc network... however i have failed. </s>
<s> ALL i really want to do is set up a wlan... no routers no nothing, just to be able to share files between two laptops i just recently bought ( vaio and dell both with internal wireless network cards and wlan) . </s>
<s> I would greatly greatly appreciate it if someone could take the time to walk me through the steps one by one please... thanks you. </s>
<s> im sorry i almost forgot... both machines are running xp pro and both do have internal wireless cards </s>
<s> It's part of a demo I setup to demo my software. </s>
<s> The one thing that wipes most out is they installed a firewall. </s>
<s> But you didn't note it so your issue may be elsewhere. </s>
<s> The machines were new so after Windows Update and installing the antivirus I selected a folder to share, set it to adhoc and rebooted. </s>
<s> The other machine I did the same and it asked if I wanted to connect to the adhoc network. </s>
<s> Very easy and I can't see how a step by step would be needed. </s>
<s> But a firewall could squash this. </s>

<s> I wonder who installed this OS. </s>
<s> Very few can do a clean install and get it all working. </s>
<s> You may not have a network setup issue here. </s>
