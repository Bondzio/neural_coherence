ancient technology with dos the only option!
i used it primarily to link, by phone, to the real estate mainframe for work purposes only.
i left the rest of it for my young sons to use for their games.
dos is beyond my mental abilities to grasp, although the concept is understandable, it never worked for me.
thanks bill gates !!
i am now better off and a puter geek at work!
