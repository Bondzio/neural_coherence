<s> Hello, For months a I have had zero success trying to network Epson 4800 printers on a windows 2003 server from a mac client (10.5.6). </s>
<s> I am able to print directly to the printer via IP, but when I send the job to the server nothing happens and I get a communication error. </s>
<s> Epson support would not give me any help ...and stated that Epson drivers do not support any server OS. </s>
<s> So i then created a XP pro box to queue jobs and still had the same problem. </s>
<s> I NEED to get these up on a server! </s>
<s> Are there any alternative drivers that are a close match to the Epson 4800's? </s>
<s> Generic drivers will queue to the server, however print quality is sketchy..... </s>
<s> I just can't seem to face the fact that I'm unable to queue Epson printers on a server client network! </s>
<s> There must be a way! </s>
<s> I Administer a print server with a variety of printers and only epson give me trouble. </s>
<s> anyone out there run into this issue? </s>
<s> thanks for reading! </s>

<s> Forgetting about putting it on any Windows or PC/Apple at all? </s>
<s> That is put it on a 25 buck print server? </s>
<s> I used this a few times -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=GMFPSU22W6&cat=PRN Sorry, I do not have an Epson. </s>
<s> Just some HP k550. </s>

<s> Unfortunately, I must try to put these Epsons on a windows server print queue. </s>
<s> We use Pharos pay per print tracking system.....This is the only way the college I work at can charge students per print. </s>
<s> I have never had any trouble with HP and Cannon printers, both large format and laserjets without any trouble. </s>
<s> Then no Epson for you. </s>
<s> Sorry but you'll have to work with Pharos or who you can pay to fix this one. </s>
<s> I deal with mostly business, home, office setups and never had to keep such on a Windows server. </s>
