computers will get obselete regardless in 30-45 days with new processors, memory and hard drives getting bigger.
most processors are 2-3 gigaherz, hard drives tend to be 30 gigabytes or more and memory is at 256 mb's or more.
you'll want to buy a computer with alot of memory like 512 mb's or 1 gigabyte if you are going to do digital video editing.
it all depends on what you're going to use the computer for and how much you have to spend on the computer.
computers are pretty cheap at $300-$500 dollars.
i would definitely find a computer with a dvd burner.
