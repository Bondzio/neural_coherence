AddLogix USB/Firewire Enclosure + Toshiba MK8026GAX 80GB in it. I presume I just have to connect it (pin-1 to pin-1 of course), plug it and I am ready to go isnt it? Do I have to set the Master/Slave jumper or something? My XP-Pro Laptop make the dwidly sound but the Drive is not mapped there. Waited long enough...to no avail!! Can you tell me what I am doing Wrong Please....

I can't check since you didn't supply make and model. 2. It's not supposed to just show up. Blank hard disks need prepartion with the Drive or Disk Management tool in XP. Bob
