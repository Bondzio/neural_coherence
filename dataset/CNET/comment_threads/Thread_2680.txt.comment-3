A couple years ago I gave an old computer to a friend in Trenton.
It was like, why not give it to them instead of throw it away.
I didn't reformat the hard drive however and the Windows kept my name as the registered owner.
I was upset because the cd-rw drive wouldn't open so I got a new computer from Sears.com.
Life is good.
You should order a computer from geeks.com or something.
Good luck.
I don't think I could send a computer outside of my country, let alone my state.
It would cost too much for me and take too much effort.
