i have an hp pavilion a735w, amd3000+ processor.
512mb ram, and installed a new ati radeon 9550 256agp card.
now when i try and play top end games (or even half life and duke nukem mp) when selecting new game, the monitor either shutsoff and doesnt come back on or the system will restart.
i was told to upgrade my ram to at least a gig, install additional case fans.
i am also using original 250w power supply.
i am new to computer gaming but this is really irritating.
also when pressing ctrl+alt.+del, you see the cpu usage and when i window a game and open this up it shows i am using 100% cpu.
somebody please help.
i am on a budget and i read this was good if on budget.
also ati customer service sucks!!!
thanks all who reply
