<s> I use 3 external storage drives: 1 - Western Digital (WD) passport 250gb 2 - HP Simple Save 500 gb 3 - Apple Ipod Nano 4gb I have 2 computer which I will name: 1 - Old PC 2 - New PC -both running on windows 7 ultimate I use these 3 on separate occasions and they've worked fine for months on the old pc. </s>
<s> Then, I purchased another one and was also able to use the same drives for a couple of weeks. </s>
<s> Then one day, (out of nowhere), the PCs failed to recognize the WD hard drive. </s>
<s> When I plug it in, the light on the WD would turn on, and the pc balloon &quot;USB NOT RECOGNIZED&quot; would pop up. </s>
<s> The next day, both the HP and the NANO also became unrecognizable. </s>
<s> I don't recall installing any new software/etc. </s>
<s> nor dropping the hard drives or getting them wet or whatever. </s>
<s> I tried plugging them in on several other computers, and the same problem: USB DEVICE NOT RECOGNIZED. </s>
<s> A few days after, I observed that my NEW PC also became faulty. </s>
<s> It would have Blue Screens every now and then, or sometimes when I start up, windows explorer would hang. </s>
<s> Now, I've tried scanning for viruses using different software, GetDataBack program also won't recognize them, and have tried using tune-up-utilities and UniBlue Powersuite but to no avail. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> The computer still had problems, and the drives are still unrecognizable. </s>
<s> I had a friend (who's good with computers) check my pc and he said that the NEW PC probably had hardware problems since it had static when he opened the casing. </s>
<s> But he had no idea regarding the status of my hard drives and couldn't really say if it was caused by the NEW PC problems. </s>
<s> I'll be sending the pc back to where I bought it to have it fixed but for now I'd just like to know if: -Is this directly related to the my Hard drives becoming unrecognizable? </s>
<s> -If not, what's wrong with them? </s>
<s> -How can I fix them and save not only the hard drives (which cost a lot of money) but my files as well? </s>
<s> Note: *Western Digital - &quot;USB not recognized&quot; balloon pops up when plugged in. </s>
<s> - Light turns on. </s>
<s> No Clicking sound (i've read in other threads that theirs have clicking sounds but mine doesn't so i guess that's a good thing. </s>
<s> - Device Manager: Under USB Controllers - Unknown Device (updating the driver won't work since the computers says it's up to date. </s>
<s> tried uninstalling then installing, no use). </s>
<s> - Device Status (under unknown device properties): &quot;Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. </s>
<s> (Code 43)&quot; - Disk Management: not detected. </s>
<s> *HP Simple Save - no pop-up balloon. </s>
<s> as if it wasn't plugged in. </s>
<s> - Light turns on. </s>
<s> No Clicking sound. </s>
<s> - Device Manager: not detected. </s>
<s> - Disk Management: not detected. </s>
<s> *Ipod NANO - no pop-up balloon. </s>
<s> as if it wasn't plugged in. </s>
<s> - not recognized by iTunes. </s>
<s> - Will work as an mp3 player, but won't charge or can't be recognized when plugged into the computer. </s>
<s> This is very odd and frustrating. </s>
<s> I hope someone can shed some light on my dilemma. </s>
<s> I wouldn't want to buy hard drives or replace my nano since that would cost me a lot!! </s>
<s> and my files are also important. </s>
<s> First thing to do: get the disk out of the enclosure into a new one. </s>
<s> See if that works on a third PC. </s>
<s> If so, the disk and the data are saved for some USD 20. </s>
<s> That's cheap. </s>
<s> Now make a backup of that data on DVD or another hard disk. </s>
<s> That's safe. </s>
<s> Repeat three times for three disks. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick response. </s>
<s> That might work but take for instance the ipod nano. </s>
<s> I can't buy another case for that.. Any other thoughts? </s>
<s> If it's damaged in such a way that it doesn't even function in any other PC or Mac (not even after a reset) you need repair or (most likely) replacement. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> what do you mean by reset? </s>
<s> How can I do that? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Try it on a third PC. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Still broken? </s>
<s> Buy a new one or have the old one repaired. </s>

<s> I'm using a WD Passport 320GB and a Seagate 160GB and know how frustrating it gets. </s>
<s> I encountered this problem a while back and seriously there was no problem with the Hard Drives. </s>
<s> The problem was actually in the form of a faulty USB hub. </s>
<s> The clicking sound as you mentioned is nothing but low voltage. </s>
<s> Due to it, there is not enough voltage to make the Disk run and the disk tends to restart. </s>
<s> As for non-detection of ext-HDD's it is a minor glitch that is taken care of by rebooting, provided that your PC hasn't stayed ON for long. </s>
<s> Even your problem still persists, firstly remove all related device drivers (This should be pretty simple if you are using Win 7). </s>
<s> Reboot it again and check. </s>
<s> If you still get the errors open the cabinet and and check whether the USB cables connecting on the motherboard. </s>
<s> These are the only things I could come up with since I had the same type of problem and got it fixed - While doing hardware changes, the cable for USB was left lose. </s>
<s> I hope it works out for you. </s>
<s> Right now I'm facing a similar kind of problem but it is with the ext-HDD and my LCD TV... </s>
<s> It detects pendrives, but not ext-HDD... </s>
<s> I wonder why... Tell me when you have a breakthrough...... pruthvibhushan@yahoo.co.in </s>
<s> I agree with pruthvibhushan. </s>
<s> That clicking is low voltage. </s>
<s> I'm taking it that your &quot;old PC&quot; is running 1.0 USB, which doesn't have the power for newer externals. </s>
<s> Add to that, your power supply hasn't the umph to push out the juice (so to speak). </s>
<s> Why it stopped working all of a sudden could be anything. </s>
<s> You're running updates to programs which blow past your old drivers & USB's, to you having too much of a load on the house outlet/APS/UPS. </s>
<s> Why your &quot;new PC&quot; is having problems with these drives may be an issue with the drive, I agree. </s>
<s> On your &quot;new PC&quot; is it a completely new PC, or an older tower/case? </s>
<s> Why I ask is if you plug your front connections into a new board (mother), from an old tower/case, those leads are still old, not new. </s>
<s> I have that issue with the one tower I use. </s>
<s> All of my externals are plugged into the rear, alone. </s>
<s> Additionally, you shouldn't run externals (drives) off a hub. </s>
<s> They require a separate power supply, as well as USB. </s>
<s> That is, they don't like to share. </s>
<s> Which is good, in the event that data crosses paths. </s>
<s> Don't laugh, it happens (less now than long ago). </s>
<s> I'd look into the computers on hand first. </s>
<s> Perhaps your drives are mislabeled between computers? </s>
<s> When I swap externals, it is registered to that computer with the same letter, if, I'm going to be doing a bunch of serious file saving & swapping. </s>
<s> But this is more for different OS versions, when I'm running anything less than NTFS on the external. </s>
<s> Please let us know the outcome. </s>
