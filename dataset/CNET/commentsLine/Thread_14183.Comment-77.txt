i got my first computer in 1983, it was an oric.
it had no hard drive and no screen so i had to use our tv to watch and and portable radio with tape recorder.
the were not many programs available, mostly games but one could buy magazines and books with games to type in so my best fun these days were to type in the games and make them run.
i loved it very much now i have both pc and a laptop.
i use both, the pc run 24 hours a day and the laptop goes with me when travelling and when i am lazy and want to use a computer in my stress-less-chair, f.i.
for playing solitairies or sudoku.
