1.1.1	I purchased a Western Digital eSata external drive and hooked it up to my MacBook Pro using a SIIG eSata-to-Express34 Controller.	St
1.1.2	I formatted the drive using Disk Utility.	St
1.1.3	I find that I can read from the drive fine.	St
1.1.4	But whenever I try to save any large files into the drive, it stops copying after a while.	St
1.1.5	The drive has a USB interface as well, and I can read/write from the drive just fine using the USB.	St
1.1.6	But writes fail whenever I use the e-Sata interface.	Polite
1.1.7	What can be the problem?	St
1.2.1	While I would have opted for a firewire interface on a Mac any day of the week, esata while promising is still on a shake down cruise.	St
1.2.2	You didn't do anything wrong.	St
1.2.3	Ask for your money back since I take it they didn't offer any support.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I know it's a new technology, but it's catching up fast.	St
1.3.2	Now, I don't think it's a problem with the hard drive since I've tested two external e-Sata drives and both show the same problem.	St
1.3.3	Someone out there must have faced the same problem.	St
1.4.1	They'll either have a new driver, firmware or admit to the issue.	St
1.4.2	While these forums are good this one is still a new thing that isn't working out of the box for everyone.	St
1.4.3	The only way to fix this is to return defective stuff.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
