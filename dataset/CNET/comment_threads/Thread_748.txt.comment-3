I also dont think that system will boot if RAM is too low as 96MB.
I am unable to make out whether any configuration has been done at the BIOS level.
Because of which I am posting this query.
System configuration is P4 1.5Ghz Processor Motherboard - Mecury - very old model (if you want i can post the model Number too.)
RAM - 512MB SDRAM (obsolete in market) How did i come to know that Windows OS is showing me 96MB - In My computer i checked for hardware properties.
Over there is showed me 96Mb of Ram.
Is there any other way to check the RAM in windows XP OS.
Also Please suggest some solution for this??
