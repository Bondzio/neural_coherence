<s> I have 2 Western Digital external drives. </s>
<s> The problem I am having is sometimes my photos will be 'gray' half way down to the bottom. </s>
<s> And they become unusable. </s>
<s> The wierd thing is this. </s>
<s> I recently purchased a slide program that I can SEE the whole photo but if I try to use it I only see a blank black space. </s>
<s> But when I click on the photo again from within the program (not putting it in a slide show), what I see is 3 of the same photo one each on top of the other at different levels. </s>
<s> I hope this is making sense. </s>
<s> I am afraid to open my photos on the externals as it ruins them...has anyone else had this problem or know what it might be that is causing this? </s>
<s> It's unlikely a photo will be ruined by opening it in a viewer. </s>
<s> Reasonably speaking, it isn't updated so stays unchanged. </s>
<s> To ensure that, set it to read-only from Windows Explorer, My Computer or command prompt. </s>
<s> That way it's safe to experiment with these weird problems, both on your external drive and on internal drives. </s>

<s> If you watch these forums you find some are thinking of these drives LITERALLY as &quot;storage.&quot; They are storage but should never be thought of your archive or backup. </s>
