<s> Do all routers have firewalls or do routers act like a firewall. </s>
<s> What is the best and the cheapest router to get that has a firewall. </s>
<s> Need it for home networking and business. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You have to define what a firewall is first. </s>
<s> Your basic NAT ROUTER is a firewall if you write that unsolicited packets don't make it to the machines behind the stock configured NAT ROUTER. </s>
<s> Others will only call it a firewall if it has &quot;stateful inspection&quot;. </s>
<s> But for all the worms that we've seen, all the routers in their stock configuration would have kept the machine safe. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Most routers nowsaday have built-in firewall. </s>
<s> Not all though. </s>
<s> DLink routers are good and not expensive. </s>
<s> Depend on wire or wireless router, the price could be varied. </s>
<s> If you need it for home use buy a netgear router its about $50 just make sure it has SPI on the box some of the older netgear routers don't have them and it doesn't really cost that much more to have it. </s>
<s> The SPI and the Nat firewall features are on by default so you don't have to configure that part. </s>
<s> they also have a wireless version for $70 -$90 depending on whether you get the 11mbs 802.11b or 54 mbs 802.11g, don't pay any attention to claims of 108mbs super G claims, sometimes they work and sometimes they cause unwanted problems with cordless phones. </s>
<s> If it's for business use I would highly recommend you pay more and get a business class router with firewall. </s>
<s> Netgear's runs for about $180 - 200 with built in wireless router. </s>
<s> There is a difference between this one and a $50 router. </s>
<s> The home routers come with a stripped down version of the SPI firewall. </s>
<s> fine for home but business use should use a real firewall. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
