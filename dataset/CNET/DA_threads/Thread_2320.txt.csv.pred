1.1.1	I 'M SELLING A COMPUTER BUT I NEED TO REMOVE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND LEAVE WIN XP ON THE HARD DRIVE THATS GOING WITH IT .	St
1.1.2	HOW DO I DO THAT ?	Ques
1.1.3	THANKS JO	St
1.2.1	That depends on how perfect it should be .	St
1.2.2	The least you can do : - make a new account with administrative capabilities - login into all other accounts ( one by one ) and clear their recycle bin - log in into the new account , and delete all other accounts This will delete the Documents and Settings ( including My Documents ) of all users But you ca n't delete the Guest user and the secret administrative user .	St
1.2.3	If those have been used , their data will stay .	St
1.2.4	That leaves Program Files , Windows , System Information , Recycler and maybe some other folders that were already present when you bought the machine .	St
1.2.5	And possibly a lot of other folders you created yourself to put your own data in ( some do , some do n't ) .	St
1.2.6	Those should be deleted also , of course .	St
1.2.7	Then download and install ccleaner ( free ) and use it to clean off temp files that maybe in those accounts .	St
1.2.8	This procedure leaves not only Windows on the machine , but also all programs you installed yourself ( like MS Office ) .	St
1.2.9	If you want to re-use paid programs on another PC , you must uninstall them from this machine .	St
1.2.10	If you keep them , you should include the installation CD in the price .	St
1.2.11	And , of course , you must add the system restore CD , the Windows CD , all driver CD 's to the machine , because the new owner needs them if he ever reinstalls Windows .	St
1.2.12	It could well be , however , that the new owner wants to do a clean install of Windows himself , to be sure he has a nice clean machine .	St
1.2.13	Then use DBAN ( free download ) to totally erase the hard disk , and let him do the install , using all the CD 's you include in the deal .	St
1.2.14	This procedure might save you a lot of unnecessary work .	St
1.2.15	Kees	St
1.3.1	After reading posts like http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html ? forumID=32 & threadID=119247 & start=0 & tag=forum-w ; forums06 where Windows stored your name and password and much more in PROTECTED STORAGE and a tool is noted to see it , I think the only way to purge the information is to wipe the drive clean with DBAN ( see google ) and re-load the OS .	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thank you very much !	St
1.4.2	Its very helpful !	St
1.5.1	Google for KILLDISK or DBAN disk wiping out pgms.. Use either one and then once done , reload the OS back onto your old system .	St
1.5.2	Be sure for the complete OS system reload that drivers , etc .	St
1.5.3	are also part of it .	St
1.5.4	When it asks for system ID , names , tags , etc.. just enter & quot ; Donor & quot ; or whatever make you feel OK. Give system away plus any or all CDs , discs that are part of the system .	St
1.5.5	REMEMBER , if this is an OEM type OS , like from Dell , Gateway , etc. , that OS is only valid on that system .	St
1.5.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Jo : There are lots of programs out there that can wipe a hard drive .	St
1.6.2	Just Google something like & quot ; Hard drive wiper & quot ; .	St
1.6.3	FWIW - I use Acronis Drive Cleanser , which is built into Acronis True Image backup software .	St
1.6.4	As far as I know , it works great .	St
