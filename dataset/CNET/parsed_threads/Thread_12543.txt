<s> I am a medical transcriptionist and work via my company's platform over the internet, so I am constantly online (high speed). </s>
<s> I want to buy a laptop to work off of when I am away from home. </s>
<s> I also want to be able to burn DVDs and CDs off of it. </s>
<s> I'm looking to get something with at least 2GB RAM and 100 GB HD. </s>
<s> My question is about the processor for this computer. </s>
<s> I am so confused about what to look for and what would be best for what I am needing to do. </s>
<s> Pentium 4 with hyper-threading, Pentium M, or Duo Core? </s>
<s> I want whatever if the fastest, and I can't make heads nor tails of anything about these processors. </s>
<s> It looks like greek to me. </s>
<s> Please give me some advice! </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Pentium 4: Just say no to a Pentium 4. </s>
<s> They're not really intended for laptops and run hot and are at the end of their product lifecycle. </s>
<s> Pentium M: These are the mainstream notebook processors. </s>
<s> They have very good performance and battery life. </s>
<s> Celeron M: These are castrated (yes I said it) Pentium M processors. </s>
<s> Only consider them if you're trying to economize (which you don't seem to be) Core Duo: A Pentium M with 2 CPU cores. </s>
<s> The &quot;Core&quot; moniker is Intel's new marketing strategy and the label for all new processors. </s>
<s> In June/July Intel should be releasing new Core Duo processors based on new CPU architecture. </s>
<s> Core Solo: The new name for Pentium M. One the AMD side of the fence: Turion 64: AMD's notebook processor. </s>
<s> Good performance but the Pentium M/Centrino/Core Duo is (imho) a better package. </s>
<s> Mobile Athlon 64: This is really a desktop chip with advanced power saving. </s>
<s> Since Athlons run cooler than Pentium 4s they are somewhat OK for a laptop but not if you really want cool running and long battery life. </s>
<s> Mobile Athlon Sempron: A castrated (yes I said it again!) </s>
<s> Mobile Athlon 64. </s>
<s> For the economy minded. </s>
<s> Probably, right now, the only place that Intel is the better, with the M. Understand that the term Centrino includes 3 factors, the M CPU, a faster chipset, and a wireless capabiolity built in. </s>
<s> The faster chipset is why they perform, in a lap top, at the level of a P4 in a laptop with a considerably higher clock rate. </s>

<s> Funny and very enlightening. </s>
<s> Thank you so much. </s>
<s> I really appreciate the information. </s>
<s> You used terminology I understand! </s>
<s> Okay, I have checked out computers, and I am down to choosing between a notebook with 100GB HD, 2GB RAM, and either a 2GHz Duo Core processor or a 2.26 GHz Pentium M processor. </s>
<s> The duo core is a little more expensive, and I am willing to pay it if it is worth the money. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Core duo, 2 GB of ram and 100 gb hard drive is more than enough. </s>
<s> Core Duo is more efficient than pentium M processor. </s>
<s> By paying a bit more you'll get a better processor and better performance. </s>
<s> The one thing to do after purchasing is removing all the bundle softwares and do a quick turn up. </s>
<s> All manufactures of laptop load alot of unecessary software. </s>
<s> I have no idea what that means. </s>
<s> What is a turn up? </s>
<s> I'm such a minion when it comes to this stuff, and on top of that, I'm a girl! </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> If you explain how to do whatever it is you are talking about, I will try to do it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> ...are paid by third-party companies to install a lot of unnecessary software onto the computer before they sell it to you. </s>
<s> This software is called bloatware because it takes up hard drive space, runs in the background, and slows the computer down. </s>
<s> The best way to eliminate bloatware is to get a Windows XP CD, format the hard drive, and reinstall Windows. </s>
