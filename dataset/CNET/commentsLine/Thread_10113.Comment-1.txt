can someone help me set up the samsung srd-470d recorder, so that i can access my security cameras remotely.
i have tried the phone tech support site but it is always busy.
i have all the necessary equipment router/modem, & a fixed ip address.
or failing that, an online webpage with graphical instructions.
i have the manual, but i am still struggling.
thanks for any help you can give..
