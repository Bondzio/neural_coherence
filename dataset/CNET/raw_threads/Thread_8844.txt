Proffitt	5/13/07 8:11 AM	1.17904386E12	Seems proper.	&quot;can't broadcast the internet connection from our main computer.&quot; That's not a standard setup so it's unlikely to work. Try the more standard of broadcasting your internet connection from the internet connection and not from your main computer. Bob

Also make, model, firmware versions, age of all parts involved. A short story might help too. One owner had switched from DSL so I was able to spot the issue. They forgot to uninstall the former DSL PPPoE software. Bob

Bob The main computer that I'm on is connected by ethernet to the modem and the router is connected to the cable modem as well. The main computer is a 3 year old eMachines T2958 Windows XP sp2. The laptops are both Gateway. One is the CX2620 and the other is the MX6931, both running Windows XP SP2. We also have a Wii that can sense the SSIDs as well. Hope this helps. Need any more info?

I messed up in that I asked for all the parts involved and you doled them out over different replies so it's more work for me to piece together the setup. RCA DCM425 is your Cable modem. It has no router or other features. The FON 2100 A/B/C is your router. It appears to be quite rare so you'll have to find the manual for me. Let's repeat where I see a problem. &quot;The main computer that I'm on is connected by ethernet to the modem and the router is connected to the cable modem as well.&quot; That's an incorrect setup. If I were to set this up I do this. Cable modem to Router. All PCs and other things connect to the router. Bob

That is, the Fon device appears to not be a ROUTER. You don't have a router so you have all but one internet IP address and without a router this device is only good for &quot;not much.&quot; When you get a router, please write back since I've subscribed to this discussion. The proper setup is noted in section B1 and other places which is... DSL/CABLE MODEM -&gt; Router -&gt; PCs and your Fon device. Bob

Thankfully new firmware cured that issue you wrote about. HOWEVER !!! You don't need to fix that if you were to follow the instructions FON supplied. But why not fix it? Tell me which version of 524 you have? A, D, C, OR E? http://www.dlink.com/products/support.asp?pid=316&sec=0#firmware Bob

Please move forward on your own to tell if your firmware is the latest and if not, please tell me why you didn't. If you have old firmware, write when you'll be replacing this router since I know that as supplied it's a dud. Bob

There is a chance you didn't ask me if such would work but given the short number of words it's up to anyone to guess the real question. -&gt; It took awhile but at the end I see you are oh so close.

I was trying to install the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter on the desktop and every time I do, I either get an error (5) or an error (6) message. Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter depends on the service and I'm also guessing the D-Link router. When I try to start the Windows Firewall service, which the Wi-Fi adapter depends on, it gives me &quot;Error 5: Access is Denied&quot; message. I found out from here that I have a lot of stuff missing from the protocols section when I look at it in the msinfo32 console when I compared it to my laptop. However, when I installed it on the laptop, it installed fine, no problems, worked mucho bella. I tried to do what it said in this article too to no avail. Any suggestions?

Strung it into an old D-Link 614+ 802.11b router - into the non-firewalled port designed for a server (good enough for my DSL speed). The public ssid works fine, but I can't connect to the private ssid with my PSP (it also hates my D-Link - and throughput is brutally slow - reminiscent of dialup) I've been thinking about a Wii, but expect it to also hate my D-Link ...and now I'm pessimistic about how well it will play with the FON, given this and many other posts I've searched.
589	22	247547	2519474	2515111	Ascertain20	6/20/07 6:08 PM	1.18236288E12	Windows Firewall/ICS problem	I found out the problem lies in the Windows Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing service. It's only affecting our desktop, but due to some nasty viruses we've had last year and this year, there's a lot of protocols missing when I look in the msinfo32 console when I click on Network and then Protocols. There should be a lot more than the current 4 I see, when I checked it against my laptop. So is there any way to restore all the protocols? BTW, when I hooked the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB adapter into my laptop, it worked fine with the Wii and both DS' we have. Also if you want, I can give you a screenshot of the desktop's msinfo32 information I've been talking about.

It has hardware version B2 and it has the German version of Firmware 2.02 on it... the only problem is I dont speak German and so I cant set it up the way I would like it. (the only reason I bought it is I am stationed in Germany and it is one of the only ones I can get my hands on). I tried the UK D-link site but apparently it no longer exists... any help would be greatly appreciated.
