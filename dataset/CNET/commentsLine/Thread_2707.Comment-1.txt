the last week or so, our internet connection has been off and on.
the lights on the modem report no internet connection--then sometimes 10, sometimes 30 minutes later, all is well.
i don't know if this is charter cable, or my modem.
we do not have tv, or a second hookup, so i can't just unplug the modem and then try another hookup.
the modem is 5 years old (motorola surfboard 5100).
unfortunately, we have voip phone service so i can't call charter when this is down.
i have called them before and i've always gotten the &quot;there's nothing wrong with our connection&quot; answer--again, when the internet connection is running, of course its working properly.
is there any diagnostic i can run, to determine if the problem is an old modem or my isp?
i can always get another modem and plug it in, then re-sell it on amazon if the new modem isn't any better off, but i'd lose 20-30 bucks in the exchange.
i'd like to try something else first.
any suggestions?
