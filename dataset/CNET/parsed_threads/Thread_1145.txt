<s> Why can't I map a drive between two PCs on my home network? </s>
<s> Both ethernet cards are installed properly in Device Manager on the respective machines, configured with IPs on the same subnet. </s>
<s> I can ping each machine from the other, so there is connectivity. </s>
<s> However whenever I try to map a drive I get the error message that the machine cannot be found on the network. </s>
<s> Firewalls are down, the drive I want to map to has been shared, yet I can't still seem to map. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> And not only on the PC but some routers have them as well. </s>
<s> See this discussion and near the end they found they had to re-share the folder. </s>

<s> ...the Windows firewall is turned off on both machines. </s>
<s> The router is not a router, but rather a Linksys switch, so no way to set it to DHCP. </s>
<s> The ethernet cards are configured with a static IP on the same subnet. </s>
<s> Again, I can ping each machine from the other, BUT I CAN'T MAP A DRIVE. </s>
<s> This is extremely frustrating, as I have never had this problem before and I can't seem to figure it out. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any more ideas. </s>
<s> What should be a simple procedure has become a pain in the............ Any and all help appreciated! </s>
<s> You listed only the firewall, but rather than going over each item with each member I offer the prior discussion so they can check over accounts and that issue with re-sharing. </s>
<s> Your reply doesn't tell much about the other areas. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...and I have been going around and around and around with this problem for about 2 weeks now, and I am still beating my head against the same (fire)wall... </s>
<s> The same user account exists on both computers, both with admin priviledges. </s>
<s> The drives I want to map to have been fully shared. </s>
<s> Both ethernet cards are configured with static IPs on the same subnet. </s>
<s> I can ping each machine from the other. </s>
<s> The Windows firewall has been turned off on both machines, but I still can't map a freakin' drive!!! </s>
<s> &quot;The network resource cannot be found.&quot; Can anyone provied a clue as to what might be going on before I take a hammer to both machines? </s>
<s> I have been networking various home computers for years and I have never had this problem before, so I am really frustrated and at a loss as to what is going on. </s>
<s> Could it be a hardware problem of some sort? </s>
<s> Or some mysterious Windoze tweak? </s>
<s> HELP!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Ouch. </s>
<s> Expert setup mode. </s>
<s> OK, without knowing the setup in detail I'll just write it shouldn't work. </s>
<s> Not everyone gets it right. </s>
<s> Also, any use of ICS trumps the sharing and may disable this. </s>
<s> I'm also sensing this is some homebuilt machine. </s>
<s> Again the details are missing so I can't guess if you forgot some motherboard driver. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But once again, both machines are running XP. </s>
<s> Both have the same user account with admin privileges. </s>
<s> The drives I am trying to map to are fully shared with all read, write and change permissions granted to various users. </s>
<s> I am now using a Netgear VPN Router/Firewall running DHCP. </s>
<s> Both ethernet cards in the respective machines are configured to acquire an IP address from the DHCP server (Netgear Router). </s>
<s> Once again, I can ping each machine successfully from the other. </s>
<s> And when I open a RUN dialogue box from the start menu and type in the IP address of the other machine, I get an explorer window showing all the shared files and folders on the other machine, which I can manipulate at will. </s>
<s> However, whenever I try to map a drive I still get the error message that the network resource cannot be found and I may not have access permissions to connect to that resource. </s>
<s> Hmmmmmm.... </s>
<s> Most peculiar. </s>
<s> Some problem with NetBIOS name resolution?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Reveal a clue. </s>
<s> I've seen that happen when the owner hid the network neighborhood from the desktop. </s>
<s> But I'm guessing here. </s>
<s> Is this &quot;stock&quot; or tweaked? </s>
<s> I still see no response about the long discussion where we covered almost all the angles from accounts to firewalls. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...I read through the previous discussion AGAIN and I see nothing there that I have not already touched on. </s>
<s> To reiterate: The same user account is on both machines, with admin privileges. </s>
<s> Windows firewall is turned off on both machines, Zone Alarm shut down. </s>
<s> Both ethernet cards configured to receive an IP address via DHCP from the Netgear VPN firewall/router. </s>
<s> I can successfully ping each machine from the other. </s>
<s> I can type the other machine's IP address at the RUN command and view all the shares on the other machine. </s>
<s> I just can't map a drive! </s>
<s> And yes, both machines are heavily tweaked. </s>
<s> I am running TweakUI and a couple other tweak programs, but My Network Places is still on the desktop, although I may have removed it at one time. </s>
<s> Why should this matter? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Recreating the share after the accounts were made. </s>
<s> Even if you did so, it's time to recreate it. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If the IP address works but the name doesn't then I wonder if someone was tweaking XP Services. </s>
<s> I can't guess what's different from stock but one service provides name resolution. </s>
<s> Maybe someone stopped that? </s>
<s> Sorry, I take these setups on stock XP setups and it works. </s>
<s> Once we run into tweaked machines it's too much fun to find what it is. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...since I bought or built them. </s>
<s> And I have been all through the Services several times. </s>
<s> The only one that I can find which relates to name resolution is TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper, which is turned on on both machines. </s>
<s> I will try re-creating the shares... </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help. </s>
<s> I believe has the letters DNS in it may be needed. </s>
<s> Check to see which are not in the stock settings. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...re-creating the shared drive has made matters worse. </s>
<s> Now I cannot even connect to the shared drive with the IP address at the RUN command anymore. </s>
<s> All I can connect to is some generic shared folders. </s>
<s> I am completely frustrated and at a loss as to why these two machines are unable to connect on my home network. </s>
<s> Time to get out the sledgehammer... </s>
<s> If recreating the share made it worse, it could have been insightful to know the error messages when you connected with the ip address. </s>
<s> It certainly reads like the age old issues of name resolution and accounts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...when connecting with the IP address at the run command. </s>
<s> The error message appears whenever I try to map a drive in Explorer or when I try to map a drive or find the shares in Workgroup in My Network Places. </s>
<s> The error states that the network path could not be found, or perhaps I don't have permission to access that resource, and it urges me to contact my network administrator. </s>
<s> Well...that's me! </s>
<s> Great advice, Microsoft! </s>
<s> Firewalls or accounts are incorrect. </s>
<s> Sorry but that's what I find.. too many times. </s>
<s> There is one other area besides this and that is the spyware issue. </s>
<s> The Sixpack I note at the next link usually finds the pest or repairs the winsock. </s>
