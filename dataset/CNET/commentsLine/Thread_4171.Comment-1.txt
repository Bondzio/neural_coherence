i have a six-year-old computer with a reset button on the tower.
this button is convenient because when a screen freezes up it is easier to press the reset button than to press ctrl.
alt.
and delete.
i need to buy a new computer but the stores that i visited only sell computers that do not have reset buttons.
if i buy a computer without a reset button how would i fix a frozen screen?
thank you very much.
