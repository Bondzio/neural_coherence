I ran into this last week.
The machine had onboard graphics as well as the VGA card.
I had to move the cable to the onboard to change the BIOS setting and then back to the card for the next boot.
Without make and model I can't tell if this applies or if that information would have me think of something else.

Test the monitor on another PC.
PPS.
Check both ends of the vga cable.
