<s> Hi to all, I'm looking for solution about cooling fans. </s>
<s> I'm slghtly new for pc. </s>
<s> Planning ?- I'm planning to install/configure/connect addtional cooling fans and my monitor tp make atleast cool condition. </s>
<s> I'm Having- some fans with smps(Seperate one) Here, I want to know:- Is that possible to supply power from SMPS(seperate) to fans? </s>
<s> If yes, tell me pin configuation 4pin connectors of SMPS &amp; fans(its like cpu fan) Thanks in advance...And Special thanks to who are read this thread/post. </s>
<s> Typical PC fan operation is based on DC voltage. </s>
<s> If you plan to add more then connect them. </s>
<s> You may need additional Y-cable splice to make more connections available from un-used Molex power connection. </s>
<s> Power to run fans isn't that demanding thus placing fans should relatively easy. </s>
<s> If you like, visit a &quot;modding website&quot; to get ideas of what's available and/or been done. </s>
<s> Of course you should use the on-board fan connections provided by the mtrbd. </s>
<s> to help in this regard. </s>
<s> IMO, it should straight-forward where fans may best serve. </s>
<s> The key is &quot;air flow&quot;, front to rear direction and provide as best less obstructions as possible. </s>
<s> Typical fan placement is frt. </s>
<s> panel= pull in, rear=pull/push out. </s>
<s> Any other fan placement either &quot;directly&quot; cools by drawing away or blowing towards. </s>
<s> Depending on that arrangement, the remaining(any other) fans have to increase their operation to balance &quot;in vs out flow&quot;. </s>
<s> Fans on top usually pull out or vented out. </s>
<s> The above applies to typical PC type fans. </s>
<s> If you get creative and use household or auto fans, etc., or refrigeration, that's your talents at works. </s>
<s> Also, you may want to look at PC water cooling kits as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
