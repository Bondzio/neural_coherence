HD upto a friends PC and he had a virus, which i knew about, but i desperately needed my coursework from the Drive so i plugged it in anyway. Now my external drive has a virus, in all the .exe files on it. the hard drive has Ceedo and the Segate software installed (Auto detect etc..) where can i download these from ? or can i just format the drive and it will work perfectly just after ?
