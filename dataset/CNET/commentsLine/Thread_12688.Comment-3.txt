you should check the tv setting and see if it has any for &quot;idle&quot; time or some time limit, set to never or disregard.
it maybe treating the device attached as not being polled and thus times out.
if the timeout period is always the same.
this can be called &quot;sleep mode&quot; as well.
understand these newer tv's have alot of options now, so don't rule it out.
this is on top of any other areas to check.
