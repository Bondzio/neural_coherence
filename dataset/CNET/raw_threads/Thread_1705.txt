I purchased an amped wireless SR150 so I can connect my Blue Ray Player (hard wired only) to my network so I could watch netflix, vudu etc...issue is it lags way too much. talked to amped wireless and they told me I need to upgrade to an extender with a larger range, my router is in the basement, TV/blue ray on the main floor..after doing some research I am thinking about the power line adapters. Which way should I go? I don't want to make another trip to the store....

All WiFi links are subject to interference and 802.11n has only 2 channels that don't overlap -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels so you can imagine that any neighbor has a 50/50 chance of messing up your connection speed. Power line works well but be sure to talk to them about the limitation such as both outlets must be on the same side of the power system. I'll stop here as I will duplicate the web. Bob

Purchased a 50ft Cat5E cable so my son can play xbox in the basement...It did not work, I moved the modem down to the basement plugged in a shorter cable and the xbox worked, so it had to be the cable, if I do that again with the blue ray player I am afraid the same thing will happen even though I know 50ft is well within the specifications of CAT5e. Plus I don't really want to run a cable that long (kind of a pain) if you know what I mean

However without testing it wired (my brother does this work) the client is never sure if more wifi gear is the answer. Why? Well on the new Smart TV and players there is a lot more lag than what you see on a common PC. I'm finding folk compare the response times on the TV to their PC. bob

Netflix Signal drops to under 1mbps....As for the cable, it was the cable at least as far as the Xbox was concerned....It did work on my laptop, but not on the Xbox.....was a speed issue...or a cable quality issue, one of the two. I suppose I could return the extender and buy a cable and see what happens....although a wireless solution would be easier and less work....

That is, I can't tell if the modem is just a modem or one of those combo modem+router things. If it's the combo deal setup needs to be checked. I see a diagram but no words on settings. Also only a few part numbers so I can't check it out. If the modem is the usual, you no longer plug it into the WAN or Internet port of the router. But I'm getting ahead of myself. -&gt; As to the basement, my brother and the office will not warrant any router in the basement work. You know why. Bob

Think the first step I am going to do is get a better router and turn the wifi off on the time warner box, I know its a cheap pos....then perhaps go buy the longer cable....see if that works
