8537	0	174334	1917235	NR	amarjitb	5/4/06 9:34 PM	1.14677844E12	New computer, old printer	Hi there, I'm writing from home about my computer at work so I don't have detailed specs. I just got a new Dell (insert specs here) and I'm trying to connect my older HP PSC. (insert spec here) New machine has no parallel port, printer has no USB thingie. Is there any kind of adapter available? Can't seems to find one online. Also need a network interface card for DSL (cable is impossible in the old factory where my restaurant is located) USB to PS/2 cables (or the other way around) to connect new CPU to our 10 year old POS so I can use one mouse and keyboard on both machines. Silly me, I thought I could replace our worn out computer with a spiffy new one and life would be good. Silly me for not checking out this stuff before I clicked &quot;BUY ME!!!!&quot; Arrgh. Thanks, Kim

Check this website or similar for &quot;adapters&quot;. But beware if you need this many adapters just return the system for a more usable one that already provides this otherwise, time and cost may defeat the whole purpose of the solution of replacement, while you can. http://www.cyberguys.com http://www.blackbox.com A qucik fix for no parallel(LPT) port is to install a pci type card offering LPT port(s). The same solution for any DSL link, which maybe best using an ethernet port, if possible one offering m/f ports like LPT, ethernet, and serial. DSL can work using USb port just be sure that is offered as an link, but this is slow compared to ethernet. tada -----Willy

I could not use the instalation CD, I used the drivers that XP gave me. My HP Computer works just as good with Windows XP as it did with Windows ME. Good Luck Wendell H
