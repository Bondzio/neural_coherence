<s> to my horror sometimes my comp. </s>

<s> What were you trying to fix and what symptoms have changed. </s>
<s> If disconnecting/reconnecting is all that was done before these problems occurred, it's usually a matter of rechecking ones own work. </s>
<s> One common problem can be with the power connectors to a drive. </s>
<s> The female ends will begin to make poor contact because there is a split in them that allows them to spread a bit. </s>
<s> You can usually pinch these back into shape. </s>
<s> Other connectors might not be seating properly as well. </s>
<s> You can reseat cards connected to the MB as well. </s>
<s> That's where I would start. </s>
