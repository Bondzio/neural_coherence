well, i bit the bullet and called pc mfr.
after 2 looooooooong hours on the phone (you know the drill..let me talk to my supervisor...), they are sending a tech to my house to swap out the mobo.
at least i don't have to ship it back or return it to retailer and be without it.
glad its brand new.
(moral of the story: try out all ports and features within warranty period!)
i couldn't get them to admit it was a known problem or anything along those lines, but they assured me that would fix the problem.
one of the times while i was holding for a long time (and anticipating that they might blame it on the hard drive itself), i discovered that my laptop had an esata port.
so i quickly tried it out there and it worked perfectly.
it was plug and play.
that kinda narrowed the options.
