it will run in any order, however, are they all same manufacture & quality?
lower latency may be best first.
mb size isn't that important as each memory row is accessed individually.
if it seems to run worse, try just 256 mb stick alone, try various combos.
it shouldn't have preceptiable effect.
heck call main & mem manufacturers if you want more opinions.
why not most expensive first?
wear latex gloves when handling memory, -=never=- touch stick with bare fingers or it will resonate poorly due to skin oils/contaniments.signed:physician thomas stewart von drashek m.d.
