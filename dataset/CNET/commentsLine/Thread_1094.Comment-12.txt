will i have to purchase something to get the security i need?
i'm a poor college student!
seriously!
i would use the xp sp2, but am a little wary about installing the sp2.
i have a thinkpad t42, and i have heard that it is not quite supported yet.
is there another free firewall that would be useful for me?
thanks for that link.
i'll try to look around some more, so i can finally stop bothering you.
thanks again.
