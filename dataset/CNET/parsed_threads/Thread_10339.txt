<s> I currently have a Samsung 941bw display, which is 19&quot; 1440x900. </s>
<s> I want to not only connect it to my computer (DVI) but also play console games (using composite video, maybe component in the future). </s>
<s> I have a few options: get a hardware video converter get a usb input device get a new display Getting a new display is my preferred choice, so I am asking for recommendations. </s>
<s> I'd like a display that is widescreen, has dvi+component+composite or s-video, can display 4:3 without stretching, and is about $300 to $400. </s>
<s> I like my current Samsung, but am not a brand *****, so I don't care who makes it. </s>
<s> I have researched like a mofo and found these displays: Samsung 2280HD Samsung 215TW Samsung 225MS Dell 2007FP (4:3 ratio ) Now, some of these are old/discontinued. </s>
<s> Others are too expensive, but I'm just posting these to describe what kind of display I am looking for. </s>
<s> The 215TW looks the best, but has a lag issue, I guess. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice or recommendations. </s>
