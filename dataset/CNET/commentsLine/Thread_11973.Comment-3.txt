i was instructed by both game companies to do that, still doesn't work.
tehy also suggested doing some kind of ram check, so i just didn't bother and bought 2 new 1 gigabyte sticks of ram, still did it.
i can't afford a new video card, and im sure there's some kind of fix for this, as i am sure that im not the only one hwo has had this happen.
