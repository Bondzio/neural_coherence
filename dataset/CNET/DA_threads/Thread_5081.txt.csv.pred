1.1.1	Dear All, I want to buy a new PC.	St
1.1.2	To get more information i browsed Intel's website.	St
1.1.3	My choice may be Celeron D, Pentium D or Pentium 4 Processor.	St
1.1.4	They support features like: Intel 64 Bit Computing, Execute Disable Bit And i got this on the website: 64-bit computing on Intel architecture requires a computer system with a processor, chipset, BIOS, operating system, device drivers and applications enabled for Intel 64 architecture.	St
1.1.5	Processors will not operate (including 32-bit operation) without an Intel 64 architecture-enabled BIOS.	St
1.1.6	Performance will vary depending on your hardware and software configurations.	St
1.1.7	Consult with your system vendor for more information.	St
1.1.8	Enabling Execute Disable Bit functionality requires a PC with a processor with Execute Disable Bit capability and a supporting operating system.	St
1.1.9	Check with your PC manufacturer on whether your system delivers Execute Disable Bit functionality.	St
1.1.10	So my question is do they support operating systems like Windows 2000 Prof., Windows XP or i have to go for their 64 bit versions?	St
1.1.11	What is the CPU number available now which will support Windows 2000 Prof. SP4 or Windows XP SP2, will be economical and which do not need special hardware or software?	St

1.2.1	&quot;So my question is do they support operating systems like Windows 2000 Prof., Windows XP or i have to go for their 64 bit versions?&quot; In this sentence &quot;they&quot; is equal to the CPU's Celeron D, Pentium D or Pentium 4 Processor.	St
1.2.2	The answer is simple.	St
1.2.3	Windows 2000 and XP all run fine on these CPUs with or without the Execute Disable Bit.	St
1.2.4	Hope this helps.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
