hello ,i have macbook running tiger 10.4.10. recently i've been facing some difficulties while trying to burn cd's.
i am thinking about buying an external dvd burner.
are there any recommendations?
are there any limitations i should be aware of?
would i have to remove my internal drive?
thanks in advance
