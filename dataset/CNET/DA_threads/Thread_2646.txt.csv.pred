1.1.1	I back up data on my hard drive using: - External hard drive (Please explain.)	St
1.1.2	- USB flash/thumb drive (Please explain.)	St
1.1.3	- CD and DVD writers/rewriters (Please explain.)	St
1.1.4	- Tape drive (Please explain.)	St
1.1.5	- RAID configuration (Please explain.)	St
1.1.6	- Online storage (Please explain.)	St
1.1.7	- I don't do any backups.	St
1.1.8	(Why not?)	St
1.1.9	- Other (What is it?)	St
1.2.1	I have used Symantec, Roxio and Microsoft's backup software.	St
1.2.2	I do a full backup about once a month and an incremental about once a week.	St
1.3.1	I am paranoid about backing up my computer ... 1.	St
1.3.2	I weekly backup on a Maxtor One Touch External Drive 2.	St
1.3.3	I nightly backup any updated files (Excel, Word, etc) on a Peerless External Drive 3.	St
1.3.4	I backup photos and other files on DVD's occasionally 4.	St
1.3.5	I backup important files on a DVD occasionally and store it in my safety deposit box	St
1.4.1	After having two PCs die from &quot;brain cancer&quot; (corrupt sectors) in the past seven years, and barely being able to retrieve the data and files I wanted most to keep...	St
1.4.2	I finally &quot;got religion&quot; and went all out for a system with RAID-1, two years ago.	St
1.4.3	Only had to use it once after a botched software update that put the system into a boot loop.	St
1.4.4	The peace of mind that comes from knowing I'm just a click away from restoring everything just the way it was, is invaluable!!!	St
1.4.5	For my three external drives, I use imaging for back-ups to another external.	St
1.5.1	I have three HDDs installed and a backup PC.	St
1.5.2	I use XXClone to back up my OS from IDE0 to IDE1, and Karenware's Replicator to back up my data on IDE1 or IDE2.	St
1.5.3	I also have an ATEN data transfer capability to back up data across computers.	St
1.6.1	i back up my data using external hard drive.	St
1.6.2	usually i backup the documents, favorites, music, stuff like that, only back up every time im about to reinstall windows.	St
1.7.1	Lee, I took your column to heart when it ran last fall.	St
1.7.2	I realized that if my system went down, I could not possibly get it back to operational condition without days of work.	St
1.7.3	I have had my main desktop computer for four years and there are tons of programs and data accumulated during that time.	St
1.7.4	Reconstructing the operating system is one (laborious!!!)	St
1.7.5	thing, reloading all the programs from CDs or from off the net (where a lot of them came from) would be absolutely daunting.	St
1.7.6	I looked into USB external drives but ended up with an internal drive solution because it copied faster and is easier than hooking up the drive every time.	St
1.7.7	I installed a similar sized drive as my main program drive (60GB) into my system.	St
1.7.8	I already had two drives installed, so I needed to add a PCI ATA drive card and cable (about $39 at Fry's).	St
1.7.9	The software that I use for backup is HD Clone from Miray Software, about $45.	St
1.7.10	I did a lot of research and this package does a system level drive clone operation that makes use of its own operating system.	St
1.7.11	http://www.miray.de/order/sat.hdclone.se.html The company was very helpful when I was first getting things working.	St
1.7.12	They responded to my requests for help and provided updates that permitted everything to work.	St
1.7.13	With HD Clone, I can quickly do a mirror copy of my main drive in about 45 minutes.	St
1.7.14	That drive then sits in the system but does not get used (yes, it is still plugged in and powered up - and if I was really paranoid I would leave the cover off the computer case and unplug the drive cable and power cable every time).	St
1.7.15	I have tested the drive by swapping out the &quot;original&quot; and restarting the computer.	St
1.7.16	It comes up without problems!!!	St
1.7.17	So if I ever have a crash (make that WHEN I eventually have a crash) I will be one of the smuggest guys in town because I will be back up and running in minutes, instead of days.	St
1.7.18	I spent about $90 on the drive controller and HD Clone software, I had an extra drive kicking around.	St
1.7.19	That is a very low cost insurance policy for instant restart in the event of a failure.	St
1.7.20	Since it is easy to execute a complete clone operation (stick the CD in the drive and restart the system, takes about 60 seconds to load, click through the setup screens and go) I start it when I leave my house at least once a week.	St
1.8.1	I use Windows Home Server!	St
1.8.2	http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx I've been a beta tester since Feb 07 and it really works!	St
1.9.1	I use RAID1 to protect against hard drive failure, but that usually isn't considered to be a backup solition since it doesn't protect against mistaken file deletion.	St
1.9.2	Backup is usually defined to mean a method to allow recovery of files previously deleted.	St
1.9.3	RAID1 *can* be used for this in some situations - by using a set of disks as if they were tapes in a backup - but it isn't commonly done.	St
1.9.4	I have Retrospect to do backups to an external hard drive (which I can take off site if necessary).	St
1.9.5	It keeps previous versions of files I've changed, for a while at least.	St
1.10.1	Still relying on a CD writer that I've had for years, which has worked very well and is dependable.	St
1.10.2	I mostly just back up photos and a few other important files.	St
1.10.3	I plan on eventually upgrading to an external hard drive.	St
1.11.1	how about internal hard drive?????	St
1.11.2	this poll is not done without any thought pissed me off	St
1.12.1	I have a lot of personal files on my system that are important only to me.	St
1.12.2	I have 2 large ext.	St
1.12.3	HDs and I copy everything there.	St
1.12.4	If I really want to keep it--I copy it on both drives.	St
1.12.5	Using CDs or DVDs, even re-writable ones, seems extreme.	St
1.12.6	The old business rule--keep a copy at another location (to save data in case of fire) is the best way--if you want data that badly.	St
1.12.7	I have had lightning problems before (got my modem fried) and I try to not keep both external drives on at the same time.	St
1.12.8	Soon, I am sure little plug-in modules will hold everything you need and be super-easy to use.	St
1.13.1	What exactly pissed you off?	St
1.14.1	You say you back-up everything?	St
1.14.2	how often??	St
1.14.3	recently checked and Im using almost 60gb of my Seagate 500gb internal HD.	St
1.14.4	stands to reason I would have to have room for 60gb every single time I backed up everything!	St
1.14.5	a lot of CD/DVDs too.	St
1.14.6	I dont think you fellas are really backing up EVERYTHING???	St
1.14.7	personally back up all my docs once a month or so- on dvd BUY a reboot copy if one didnt come with your PC- like with my Sony Vaio	St
1.15.1	1.	St
1.15.2	I use EMC Retrospect to back my entire hard drive once per week.	St
1.15.3	2.	St
1.15.4	I make a mirror image of my hard drive once every six months.	St
1.15.5	3.	St
1.15.6	I backup to a Maxtor external hard drive partitioned into two volumes, one for backups, one for mirror.	St
1.16.1	I do an automated daily backup of my home directory using Retrospect Express and a monthly backup of my iPhoto and iTunes libraries to a hard drive using SilverKeeper.	St
1.16.2	When I take my MacBook Pro on a trip, I clone the entire hard drive to to an external hard drive with SuperDuper!	St
1.16.3	in case the machine is lost so I can easily replicate it on a replacement computer.	St
1.16.4	I am planing to replace all this with Time Machine when Leopard comes out in the fall.	St
1.17.1	I use a USB 2.0 External HDD & Acronis True Image.	St
1.17.2	Be sure to get a Hard Drive for your backup that is big enough to image all the data you anticipate using in your current machine now and for the future.	St
1.17.3	(Installing expansion Hard Drives, etc.)	St
1.17.4	Some of the RAID solutions out there are very tempting, though.	St
1.17.5	Except for having to use identical drives.	St
1.17.6	I'm seriously considering the DROBO, as spendy as it is.	St
1.17.7	DROBO: http://reviews.cnet.com/hard-drives/drobo/4505-3186_7-32470303.html Acronis True Image: http://reviews.cnet.com/backup-and-recovery/acronis-true-image-8/4505-3682_7-31256880.html	St
1.18.1	GHost is cool.	St
1.18.2	Version,12.0 is nice they all work like dogs.	St
1.18.3	They are all good.	St
1.18.4	Also usually use the EXTERNAL HDs for backups accept it can be a pain when you switch out PC's a lot or work on your rig a lot.	St
1.18.5	Anyhow,I believe externals can be a pain.	St
1.18.6	I usually use an internal drive a 500 GIGS.Best way to do a restore is to save an image on a Different Hard drive not on your C hard drive.	St
1.18.7	The best way to restore the pc back the original state is to keep a good boot disk with all the proper utilities on it to point to your backup on your external or extra INTERNAL HD.	St
1.18.8	Not to point but I mean the path of the backup file itself then tell the software to do a restore.	St
1.18.9	It is that easy.	St
1.18.10	Most people just don't take the time when they get a software with a million capabilities they get discouraged and do not utilize the software nearly to it's fullest potential.	St
1.19.1	I did that because my &quot;backup&quot; isn't really much of a backup as it is protection against potential failures.	St
1.19.2	I know I should do something more effective, but with both my Vista and XP installations on a RAID 0 array, my only copy of all my important stuff is located on an external disk.	St
1.19.3	I should come up with something better, but for now, that's it.	St
1.20.1	I installed a 500 gig RE Western Digital.	St
1.20.2	This is a server type hard drive, with more life hours then the normal PC harddrive.	St
1.20.3	I normally replace hard drives every two years.	St
1.20.4	Thats if I run them all the time.	St
1.20.5	I tried a Raid and some other types of setups and all ways was having crashes that would require me to reinstall my OS or work around until bios found my hard drives.	St
1.20.6	I messed up a couple of Seagates hard drives with this Raid setup and spent a lot of time waiting for my hard drives from Seagates.	St
1.20.7	After the third time of returning hard drives I gave up on seagates and the Raid setup.	St
1.20.8	So as I found out talking to others with the same problem I gave up on a Raid setup.	St
1.20.9	I was looking as most are for a system to protect my information.	St
1.20.10	I tried Ghost 9 for a back up of my Raid setup.	St
1.20.11	But Ghost will not support a Raid system.	St
1.20.12	So now I use the 500 gig for backup and dayly updates.	St
1.20.13	If and when I need something from my backup I can open it and work with those files.	St
1.20.14	Ghost 9 and Acronis are about the same.	St
1.20.15	Both will give you a full backup without stoping your work.	St
1.20.16	Then they will update you backup so you have an up to date backup.	St
1.20.17	When I reinstall the backup it gives me a complete hard drive set up from the boot files to all other files I had on the old drive.	St
1.20.18	I learn this after the Windows SP 2 and the problems it caused.	St
1.20.19	Most backup were no good.	St
1.20.20	NO!	St
1.20.21	Boot sectors!	St
1.20.22	SO the computers would not boot from the hard drives.	St
1.21.1	I use an online backup called Drive HQ.	St
1.21.2	It automatically backs up everything--even my old partition I can no longer get into.	St
1.21.3	Cost?	St
1.21.4	Only $29.	St
1.21.5	a year.	St
1.21.6	They have more expensive offers with more options for larger backups and businesses.	St
1.21.7	For my birthday, my son gave me a Maxtor periphrial backup disc with several hundred Gigabytes but after installing it, my computer ran so slowly I could barely use it.	St
1.21.8	It was only after reading the Maxtor stats in &quot;My Computer&quot; that I found it needed far more RAM than I have to run it, so had no other choice but to uninstall the program.	St
1.21.9	Will use the Maxtor for my next computer which will have &quot;beaucoup de RAM.&quot;	St
1.22.1	1.	St
1.22.2	Buy a secondary HDD 2.	St
1.22.3	Install in PC slave slot 3.	St
1.22.4	Put all your data in this HDD 4.	St
1.22.5	Done	St
1.23.1	I have two drawers for hard drives, one for the Windows disc and one for anything else.	St
1.23.2	Every week I load a disc into the second drawer (Secondary master) and use Acronis True Image - Manage hard drives - Clone hard drive to take a complete image of the Windows disc.	St
1.23.3	The resulting copy can be used at any time simply by moving it to the Primary Master drawer.	St
1.23.4	Easy.	St
1.24.1	I don't even want to backup my computer because I don't have anything that really needs to be backed up.	St
1.24.2	All that is on my main drive is programs and that's the only drive I've ever had problems with.	St
1.24.3	But OneCare was yelling at me and being all red about it, so I told it that it could backup my C: drive.	St
1.24.4	The backup file takes up less than 4GB so it's not like it wastes too much space, and what isn't backed up is screen shots of games and recorded TV shows.	St
1.24.5	If I lose them, I'm not going to feel like someone just chopped off a limb or anything.	St
1.24.6	But I have backed up my music collection on my own, although I should tell OneCare to back that up.	St
1.24.7	Plus everything is also on my MP3 player (Creative Zen Jukebox Xtra with 30GB storage if you're wondering).	St
1.24.8	But that reminds me I have another 40 minutes of music to put on my player.	St
1.25.1	I back up using an additional internal hard drive, and use Bounce Back to keep the image of the backup drive up to date.	St
1.25.2	Main files are automatically backed up by bounce Back daily, and whole system is backed up weekly immediately after system virus scan (to try to avoid backing up viruses with the system backup).	St
1.26.1	All our TeraStations are set up with a RAID 5 array.	St
1.26.2	One 2T for movies, one 1T for Audio and backups of important data, one 1T for total computer backups of three separate computer systems as well as some projects from work.	St
1.26.3	And even though my hubby is a network specialist and runs a couple of small companies' networks... we don't back up the separate computers as often as we should, though no important data is kept on the individual computers themselves.	St
1.26.4	And BTW... one of the hard drives in one of our older TeraStations went splat the other day and we were able to rewrite it with no loss of data.	St
1.26.5	Though we do need to do a hard drive replacement in it for safety's sake.	St
1.27.1	I share some files across my network so I have multiple copies of many files on any of my computers should something fail.	St
1.27.2	I also burn some files to CD from time-to-time.	St
1.27.3	I also transfer some files to a USB device sometime.	St
1.27.4	I don't perform &quot;back-ups&quot; per se.	St
1.28.1	I run a home network with 3-4 computers.	St
1.28.2	Each computer has been set up with an automatic back up program that backs up to a NAS drive on my network.	St
1.29.1	I purchased a Seagate Free Agent Pro that came with a copy of Auto Back Up, and I automatically back up the files that I have chosen on a daily basis.	St
1.29.2	It is the best back up system that I have ever used, and have tried to do back ups regularly since I had a hard drive failure many years ago.	St
1.29.3	I also have a RAID 1 on my C drive.	St
1.29.4	Best to get a program like Auto Back up,a and then it will be done with no intervention from you the User.	St
1.29.5	The program backs the files up in a &quot;Tree&quot; format just like it is on your computer, so you can go out and find any individual file that you may need.	St
1.30.1	I have been using a computer for about 13 years but have never backed up.	St
1.30.2	It is too confusing and I do not know how to do it.	St
1.30.3	If it were easier I probably would do it.	St
1.30.4	There should be something that just says &quot;back up&quot; and you can say yes or no and it automatically backs up whatever it should without you having to choose among stuff and not knowing what to choose.	St
1.30.5	Wish I could have done this as my last computer broke and I lost almost all my pictures and music files.	St
1.30.6	Mostly everything else somebody was able to get off old hold drive for me.	St
1.31.1	I am one of those who does not understand &quot;backup&quot;; I would love to have what you suggested; all this technical stuff is way beyond me!	St
1.31.2	I did put some stuff on a CD-RW and it was supposed to be a backup but I don't really know what's on it.	St
1.31.3	I would like to save some great emails and my favorites but that's about all.	St
1.32.1	I use an external (USB) hard drive and Partition Magic to clone my System & Data partitions for a backup - that way I can re-clone them to the original, a replacement, or an upgraded disk (more space, faster, etc).	St
1.32.2	I have very infrequently had to use the backup partitions on the external drive, and cloning them back to my PC has worked flawlessly.	St
1.32.3	With a copy of Partition Magic on a bootable CD, I can even access the partitions, delete bad partitions, etc, without being able to boot up the machine normally (I have my PC set to boot from CD before booting from hard drive).	St
1.33.1	to an external HDD.	St
1.33.2	Don't want to spend hours and hours locating CDs, products keys, reloading OS, reloading drivers, reloading application software, setting preferences, bookmarks, etc., etc., Makes me tired just thinking about it.	St
1.33.3	VAPCMD	St
1.34.1	Or what if your PC takes a lightening strike ?	Ques
1.35.1	I veiwed all the answers but it seems that some of these people have forgotten that XP comes with a backup utility And at least My copy works real well	St
1.36.1	I also use a second &quot;Internal&quot; hard drive.	St
1.36.2	It is much faster than an external hard drive going through a USB port.	St
1.36.3	I am not pissed off about it, just curious why you would not include this option in your poll.	St
1.37.1	Its esasy to backup data files and photos...whichever way you choose...My problem is that I have to reinstall my OS and some of my programs and its never the same..ie...It literally took me weeks to get a favorite program tuner usb to work even with its updated drivers for XP.	St
1.37.2	It was meant for win98...now, after being forced to reinstall the OS, I got the same problem all over again.	St
1.37.3	Restore didn't help.	St
1.38.1	NIL	St
1.39.1	All of the techniques are OK, except that none of them works all the time.	St
1.39.2	Windows file backup is great but if you have a HDD crash you are in trouble; those applications that backup your HDD incrementally sometimes cannot do the job right, and it damages everything, the old backup and the following increments.	St
1.39.3	I do a few things: When I install Windows or Linux, I divide the HDD in two partitions (or more).	St
1.39.4	One partition for the OS and applications, and another partition - that I will call &quot;Drive D&quot; here - where I will keep backups and a folder called &quot;My Documents.&quot; Inside the that folder, I can keep everything I want.	St
1.39.5	After Windows is installed, I direct the My Documents shortcut icon on the desktop to that folder on drive D: (D:\My Documents).	St
1.39.6	Windows will ask me if I want to move all the items in C:\My Documents to D:\My Documents.	Sug
1.39.7	I will say YES for now, provided that I have not put anything in the new folder yet.	St
1.39.8	After all the drivers and applications are installed, I may use a very good Symantec tool called Ghost 2003, or Acronis True Image 8, 9 or 10, and sometimes both and create image(s) of that HDD on the separate partition (or even a second or third drive).	St
1.39.9	The trick is not to use incremental image creations (sour experiences).	St
1.39.10	I may create an image of my so called Drive D onto an external HDD or just back it up every so often by using a tool called SyncBack (free or buy the professional edition at www.2brightsparks.com), which allows me to schedule synchronizations or backups.	St
1.39.11	Never had a problem.	St
1.39.12	If computer crashes or becomes unusable, I just use the perfect image of the fresh installation.	St
1.39.13	Since the OS is always on drive C, drive D is untouched, and all My Documents are still there waiting for me.	St
1.39.14	Never failed.	St
1.40.1	i use ghost 10 on all of my computers, i currently work with 4 desktops and 2 laptops.	St
1.40.2	and believe me i go over board when it comes to backup.	St
1.40.3	at the end of last year 06 my hdd on my cadcam computer went kaput!!!	St
1.40.4	i had well over 4 years of work on that computer in cad dwgs.	St
1.40.5	that cost me a lot of work and grief.	St
1.40.6	i did take the hdd out and sent it to seagate for recovery, no dice completely gone major crash as the head into the discs.	St
1.40.7	all my computers are for business.	St
1.40.8	the only games on mine are Freecell and solitary.	St
1.40.9	i use them as time killers.	St
1.40.10	so what i do is add a 3rd hdd split it into 2 partitions.	St
1.40.11	the front partition i use to make an exact bootable copy of my hdd.	St
1.40.12	the 2nd partition i use to have my recovery points and my backup of the &quot;C&quot; drive.	Ques
1.40.13	i should also mention that i do not store any more drawings on my C drive anymore nor do i store any volitile materials like CNC programs or anything that is important.	Ques
1.40.14	for these files i use a slave drive for just storage.	St
1.40.15	i do back these up too to external usb drives.	St
1.40.16	i have one laptop that does nothing but by acctg billing.	St
1.40.17	i have no outside programs other than quickbooks.	St
1.40.18	now i keep 3 back ups of the qbbk info on the c drive on an external and on a thumb drive.	St
1.40.19	pretty anal huh?	St
1.40.20	maybe but i've lost a number of hdd over the years and i am tired of trying to recoup i just hope this is enough protection.	St
1.41.1	I notice no one seems to back up to a flash drive.	St
1.41.2	Is there a reason?	St
1.41.3	So far I only back up documents and some programme files.	St
1.41.4	I use CD's for that but a flash drive seems less cumbersome.	St
1.41.5	I'm not technical at all	St
1.42.1	I use a program called EZ Gig II by Apricorn.	St
1.42.2	I recently reformatted my computer's hard drive but before did a full backup of my drive using EZ Gig.	St
1.42.3	When it came time to transfer my data, EZ Gig II made a virtual HD from my image and then I just transferred my data by right clicking on Start and then chose Explore.	St
1.42.4	EZ Gig II was a free program that was included when I bought a USB 2.0 to SATA/IDE connector.	St
1.42.5	Best free program I ever received.	St
1.43.1	NIL	St
1.44.1	How come they didn't mention internals?!	St
1.44.2	It's like make a poll for a favorite laser printer without HP, or something like that.	St
1.44.3	Makes no sense.	St
1.45.1	I backup my data in three ways.	St
1.45.2	The first is to use a program called FolderShare from Microsoft.	St
1.45.3	It allows me to keep data in sync between my laptop and my desktop.	St
1.45.4	The second is using a freeware program called File Hamster.	St
1.45.5	It keeps track of all files & updates to those files that you indicate and copies the information to (in my case) an external 1TB USB drive.	St
1.45.6	The third way is a scheduled backup using Nero Backup Express.	St
1.45.7	Once a week I take a full backup of My Documents.	St
1.45.8	A second weekly backup copies My Downloads.	Sug
1.45.9	The third weekly backup is an incremental backup of My Documents.	St
1.45.10	The first two go on 2-DVD +R discs.	St
1.45.11	The third one is to a CD-R disc.	St
1.45.12	I make no attempt to backup Windows or software.	St
1.46.1	I unfortunately lost all my data on my Desktop Hard Drive.	St
1.46.2	So, now I have my laptop backed up using the Maxtor Sync.	St
1.46.3	Does anyone know - How to prevent moved folders from being recreated and duplicated from the sync?	St
1.46.4	Jayne	St
1.47.1	I use CD-RW or DVD-RW with Nero back it up.	St
1.47.2	I want to use my 4GB flashdrive but cant get Nero to recognize it.	St
1.47.3	I am not sure how to do it.	Res

1.48.1	when i finish installing my Windows, office, games, i backup/clone my C:\(WinXP) drive into my data drive (wic is just another compartment of onne disc) Using Norton Ghost.	St
1.48.2	and when i get a virus, or any problem, i just restore my XP+office+game etc.	St
1.48.3	Saves a lot of time.	St
1.48.4	And i save all my documents into my data drive as well.	St
1.48.5	I also have a external drive that i back up my data drive to.	St
1.49.1	I too use Microsoft's Home Server in it's current beta from, this automaticlly backups all computers on the network.	St
1.49.2	It uses a program that only backs up one copy of any one file from the hardrives, so the back space is is small.	St
1.49.3	It was a a complete restore funtion for the total hardrive if needed.	St
1.49.4	I also use Second Copy to backup the data from each computer to a common drive so all My Photos for example are on the 'P:' drive.	St
1.49.5	All drives attached to the Home sever can be added to the overall data storage space and you have the option of saving data on two different drives.	St
1.49.6	I also use 2nd copy to back up the to a USB drive attached to the Home Server as well as to my remote location computer in my observatory in case of a house fire.	St
1.50.1	Using FileSync available from http://www.fileware.com/products.htm, I am able to back up the contents of my HDD to one or more external USB hard drives.	St
1.50.2	I use one external drive for individual folder backups and another to back up the entire drive.	St
1.50.3	I start the application, select the folders or ... and do a compare.	St
1.50.4	I then uncheck the files I do not wish to back up, then tell it to do its thing.	St
1.50.5	NOTE: if the folders or the HDD partition I am backing up are large, I usually either do it before going home at night or taking a lunch break or similar.	St
1.50.6	FileSync is great since it will also backup to a SAN or NAS or a drive on a server.	St
1.50.7	I found the $30 to be well worth it.	St
1.51.1	NIL	St
1.52.1	that no backup method is any good if you can't restore the system.	St
1.52.2	The only way to test your scheme is to deliberately (but safely) trash your system and try to restore it.	St
1.52.3	As for using RAID 1, SATA drives are best as there's no guarantee with PATA that, if one drive fails, the other will boot.	St
1.52.4	Developing a good backup scheme is only part of the plan.	St
1.52.5	Restoring is another and you need to make sure both work in actual trial.	St
1.53.1	I use a 160GB external hard drive by Maxtor, updated using Synctoy.	St
1.54.1	I have: 1. a backup partition 2.	St
1.54.2	An external hard drive 3. thumb drives with a copy of vista and my files 4. a vista backup disk 5. backup my files to online storage with norton 360 every week	St
1.55.1	Hello, I've been using my external hardrive (80 GB) to back up my files on two computers I do this once a week.	St
1.55.2	My question is can this portable storage devise be converted to a flash drive so I can easily see what files I have and what files I want to back up, delete, or sync?	St
1.55.3	I've also been usinga 4G flash drive to transfer and store some of my files because I find it daunting to use the Maxtor.	St
1.55.4	I may not be taking full advantage of my Maxtor, because I'm always so afraid to do something wrong and delete all my files by mistake.	St
1.55.5	I am not a techie so I've done some stupid things (because I thought I knew what I was doing) and later regreted it.	St
1.55.6	Last time I tried to clean up my computer I messed it up so bad the Geek Squad had to reinstall my OS.	St
1.55.7	My husband keeps begging me to stop experimenting and adds, &quot;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.&quot; So, direct me as to where to find the information requested, or advise me please.	St
1.55.8	I have a Gateway GR5012 PC Media Center Edition 2005, Intel Pentium D 820 processor, Windows XP 1024 MB DDR2, 250 GB SATA HDD, 7200 RPM w/8 MG Cache.	St
1.55.9	And, a Toshiba A105 Satellite Laptop, with Inel Centrino and Windows XP.	St
1.55.10	(Sorry I can't be more specific with the details) My external hard drive is a Maxgtor OneTouch II Mini Edition 80GB with encryption capabilities.	St
1.55.11	Thank you very much, &quot;Not a techie I am&quot; Carmen	St
1.56.1	You may have just provided the help I need.	St
1.56.2	Tell me if Im on the right track.	St
1.56.3	I want to have an &quot;exact copy&quot; of my hard drive so if (when) it crashes I can re-load EVERYTHING (files, documents, pics, WindowsXP, programs, bookmarks, etc).	St
1.56.4	I have been given so many different answers and I'm &quot;not a computer person&quot;, so frustrated!	St
1.56.5	I just bought Acronis True Image (unopened still) and an external hard drive.	St
1.56.6	Still not sure if that is the BEST option for what I want.	Res
1.56.7	You seem to be on to something!I have a Dell Dimension4600 (uses IDE hard drive not SATA) and can't figure out if I have room for another internal hard drive (I looked inside but really don't know what I'm looking for) and if that will be more trouble than an external hard drive.	St
1.56.8	I want the EASIEST and hopefully least expensive way to accomplish what I want - would your idea work??!!	St
1.56.9	Any other suggestions out there?	St
1.56.10	Please answer in &quot;English&quot;, not &quot;computerese&quot; (grin).	St
1.56.11	Oh yeah, what is a &quot;drive controller?&quot; THANKS!!	St
1.56.12	!	St
1.57.1	With RAID 1, I have two identical drives configured as one volume.	St
1.57.2	Each drive is a mirror image of the other.	St
1.57.3	If one drive fails, you are able to continue with just the one drive.	St
1.57.4	You replace the failed drive and the RAID system will rebuild the new drive.	St
1.57.5	You will continue to use your computer during this operation in the background.	St
1.57.6	Within a short time the new drive will mirror the older drive.	St
1.57.7	I use a UPS or Uninterruptable Power Supply to protect my system from power fluctuations (e.g., brown outs, power surges), noise on the power line, and power outages.	St
1.57.8	The battery in the UPS provides these capabilities including the ability to continue running during a power outage.	St
1.57.9	I have my system configured to shutdown safely if the power is out more than 5 minutes.	St
1.57.10	I can leave my system running at all times without any concern about power issues.	St
1.57.11	The RAID 1 configuration can be improved by adding additional drives depending on how much you want to spend and how paranoid you might be regarding the loss of your system drive.	St
1.57.12	The odds of two drives failing is very low.	St
1.57.13	With the UPS protection any additional effort to protect your system drive would improve your odds, but I am not sure it would improve them enough to justify the expense and effort.	St
1.58.1	I have the full backup of my hd bade with Acrinis True Image.	St
1.58.2	I store it on dvd.	St
1.58.3	Also every week i make scheduled backups of my work files.	St
1.58.4	My scheduled backups I store in the Secure Zone on my hdd (True Image has such utility).	St
1.59.1	Someone here said that they have as backup a Vista on their thumbdrive.	St
1.59.2	What good is that if one can't boot it up in tact?	Polite
1.59.3	Also, it would have to be a large capacity TD.	St
1.60.1	I have learned my lesson & will be backing up data from now on...probably using a CD or flash drive.	St
1.60.2	My computer is less than 6 mos old & the hard drive crashed.	St
1.60.3	Luckily, I did not have a lot of important things on there or things that cannot be recreated!	St
1.61.1	I feel that as my laptop is less than three months old and came with all operating software I need (M/S Office 2007/Vista etc).	St
1.61.2	I only need to save my work onto a flash drive and this negates the need to constantly back up my Hard drive to CDs, in face I never need to even defragment my hard drive either.	St
1.61.3	Tam Anderson, Psychology Student, QMU, Edinburgh	St
1.62.1	I backup to DVD-Rs and an external Seagate Freeagent 250 Gig drive (yeah, I bought one in a moment of weakness despite my usual preference for putting together my own components).	St
1.62.2	The most precious data such as my research/thesis data I copy on to the Freeagent + burn to DVDs + finally keep a copy on one of my 3 physical internal SATA drives, on which is there plenty of space.	St
1.62.3	This is apart from the same data stored on my lab computer.	St
1.62.4	Call me paranoid, but I dont want to repeat 3 years worth of hard research because one fine day my drives decide to quit!!	St
1.62.5	As mentioned in another thread, apart from a regular backup policy, it's also a very good idea to have file recovery software up and running on the PC.	St
1.62.6	It is invaluable if you accidently delete (from the recycle bin) important files of which you have no backup, or which were modified after the last backup.	St
1.62.7	Prevention is better than cure: have a sound data protection plan in place rather than reacting to an incident after the fact.	St
1.63.1	My apologies for the long belated reply.	St
1.63.2	Good details.	St
1.63.3	My set-up is very much like yours.	St
1.63.4	I &quot;got religion&quot; about having a UPS a long time ago too.	St
1.63.5	I've just recently experienced a failure of the RAID-1 secondary drive and will replacing it pronto!	St
