AMD provided mobo mfrs well in advanced the voltage levels that the chip would use.
Pretty certain that other parameters are internal chip parameters and both the 130 and 90's use the same pinouts.
However I think that John Robie had posted something that only certain models would support Dual Core.
Maybe email John.
Long range, however, because putting the MCH on the CPU chip has boxed them in to using only DDR [no DDR2].
New socket scheduled for mid 2006 [but bet that they beat that if Intel does something to spur them to beat that schedule] for CPU's supporting DDR 2.
