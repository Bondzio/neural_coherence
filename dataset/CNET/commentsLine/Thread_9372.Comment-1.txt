three main questions.
1) i'm upgrading some peripherals...drives, ram, hd...how can i know how much power my system requires now and how much it will after the upgrades?
2) i'm limited (very) in my cpu upgrade.
i have a p4 1.4ghz and specs allow for 1.8. i came across some kits that state they can upgrade to higher processors (2.8) with the use of an adapter.
what are the benefits/problems of using such kits?
3) finally, again regarding my cpu, which is supposed to have a 400hz bus.
i recently ran a utility test and the results were that it was running at 100. what can cause this difference?
if anyone can help with any of these i'd appreciate it.
