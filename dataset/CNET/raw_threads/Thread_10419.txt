Signal goes through outside antenna to alvarion breezeaccess box to wireless router. Each pc has a wireless adapter. Thinking of switching to Verizon wireless. The Verizon wireless modem would be usb. Can I send the broadband signal from Verizon's usb modem through a pc to the wireless router? Running windows 2000.

Update the firmware in your wireless router Broadcast SSID Use WPA security use nothing else. Rick
