<s> Hello, My problem is my pc is turning it self off in the middle of playing games and using other programs. </s>
<s> I used my scanner today and while I was using one of the programs that came with my scanner my PC just turned it self off. </s>
<s> I had to turn off the power supply to my surge protect and then wait a minute and turn the surge protector back on. </s>
<s> Then I can push the power button and start the PC. </s>
<s> C drive has 15GB and 6.65GB used D has 54.8GB used and 44.9 used. </s>
<s> I have 512MB of ram. </s>
<s> I have a Vaio and the hard drive is already formated with 15 for C and 54 for D. Two days ago I uninstalled a program that I got from CNET. </s>
<s> This program is call Power DVD Burner. </s>
<s> It sent my computer into a blue fatal when I rebooted it. </s>
<s> I had to restore the C drive because it would not let me into normal or safe mode. </s>
<s> My PC did not start doing this until I uninstalled this program. </s>
<s> I have deleted all but the necessary programs like MS office,Adobe, and real player. </s>
<s> I did download a bunch of updates from Microsoft. </s>
<s> I also updated Net framework 1.1 to 3.0. </s>
<s> I download only to the D drive but the updates automatically download to the C and sometimes other programs I load still want to download a little of themselves to C. I read an article that said sometimes the battery or power supply could cause problems like this. </s>
<s> I don't want to replace part after part. </s>
<s> I don't think it is worth that consider the age of the PC. </s>
<s> Any suggestion as to what is happening to my system? </s>
<s> I feel I need a new one. </s>
<s> It is barely 3 years old. </s>
<s> But I rather junk it then rebuild it completely. </s>
<s> My PC is running XP Home edition. </s>
<s> Even at 1 year dust and lint can build up to cause heat shutdowns. </s>

<s> I talk about the download processing, u can set your download destination folder by change &quot;My document&quot; path by setting: 1)Right click on My document 2)Choose Tab: change target 3)then browse to a new folder. </s>
<s> 4)ok Reagard. </s>
<s> age is just about 3 years. </s>
<s> What are you suggesting? </s>
<s> Opening the PC and dusting? </s>
<s> I know you can change the destination for other files but what about updates from Windows. </s>
<s> When the updates are done downloading windows update ask you to restart. </s>
<s> These updates are taking up a lot of space. </s>
<s> And some programs like the game the Sims want to still download some to the C drive. </s>
<s> If you say no it shuts the game down and will not allow the game to be installed. </s>
<s> I don't have the game on my system at this time because it is not a necessary program right now. </s>
<s> At minimum I've always noted yearly. </s>
<s> So if it hasn't been done and the fans checked you're likely getting close to the cause. </s>
