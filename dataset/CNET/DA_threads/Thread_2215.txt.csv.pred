1.1.1	I have an HP 7160 Media Center PC, (old, I know, but good enough, not ready to upgrade yet) Comcast cable modem, and linksys WRPT54G broadband router.	St
1.1.2	(2 phone ports, wired ports, wireless) I am constantly disconnected from the internet, have to get up to go across the house to unplug/replug/reset the router so much I count it as &quot;exercise.&quot; It takes forever to do anything on the net.	St
1.1.3	If I had a more constant connection, I might find time to actually do some REAL exercising!	St
1.1.4	(-: What router should I buy to replace it?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks for your suggestions.	St
1.1.6	Synthia	St
1.2.1	If you can't stand drops, you get wired.	St
