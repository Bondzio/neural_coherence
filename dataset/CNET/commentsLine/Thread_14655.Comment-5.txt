i've been searching for a solution to this problem but as a computer novice i cant make sense of the responses!
i hope you can help me.
i don't have a power option on my control panel.
i'm using a dell pc - dimension 5100. i got the message when i tried to connect my camera to the pc and again when i used my memory stick.
the usb port therefore seems to not be working at all.
can anyone help me?
