<s> I was given a computer with various components installed. </s>
<s> I was told if I could get it to work I could keep it. </s>
<s> The main issue is that it has an IBM 15gb HD that accesses only 2gb. </s>
<s> The OS is Windows Melenium. </s>
<s> I have checked cable connections,jumper settings, and BIOS settings all to manufacture's reccomendations with no luck. </s>
<s> The BIOS CHS settings do not match the reccomended ones and when attempting to change them manually they revert back upon rebooting. </s>
<s> System Info under- Storage/Disks reports Size as 14.32gb and yet I still receive &quot;Low Disk Space&quot; error msgs. </s>
<s> It would appear that the drive was partitioned to not support large hard drives. </s>
<s> If you can reinstall a 9x OS, I would FDISK and choose large disk support. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I am relatively new to computers but seem to have gained enough knowledge to be dangerous. </s>
<s> Reguarding your answer, 9x OS what specifically would that translate to? </s>
<s> Also, using FDISK would mean that I will lose all data, right? </s>
<s> 9x systems = 95, 98, 98SE, ME. </s>
<s> Also, using FDISK would mean that I will lose all data, right? </s>
<s> Yes and no. </s>
<s> First you back up to an external source what you do not want to lose then you build anew. </s>
<s> Try booting your machine, then pressing F8 before the machine boots into Windows. </s>
<s> Choose the option &quot;Start in MS-DOS mode&quot;, then type in the letters &quot;FDISK&quot;. </s>
<s> Use that program to find if there is any space left (which there should be). </s>
<s> Make sure to enable &quot;Large Hard Disk Supoort. </s>
<s> Make new partitions to fill up the space, if need be. </s>
<s> First you have to lose all your data if you want the full size of your HD (hard-drive) If you can get your hands on a 98se start-up disk, start your computer with it. </s>
<s> When it comes up with the A&gt; propmpt type in FDISK and select large partition. </s>
<s> When you get inside FDISK you have to delete all existing partition by press &quot;3&quot;. </s>
<s> when it asks what kind of partition say primary. </s>
<s> Go back to the beginning of FDISK by pressing the escape key and choose &quot;1&quot; and then &quot;1&quot; again and your computer should show all of the HD. </s>
<s> E-mail me with questions. </s>
<s> Never mind what the BIOS sees. </s>
<s> There is a known bug for some IBM TravelStar hard drives where they report the wrong size to the BIOS. </s>
<s> If that is what this is there is a firmware update at the IBM site that can correct the problem, but that will not have any real impact on drive space. </s>
<s> And what about 'D' drive? </s>
<s> If this is a laptop (or configured like one)... </s>
<s> Many laptops have a 2gb 'C' drive and the rest of the hard drive is 'D' since hibernation software requires FAT16 (limited to 2GB). </s>
<s> If that is how this computer was originally configured you will end up with the same thing when you 'restore'. </s>
<s> If you do not have an &quot;genuine windows CD&quot; and only a 'restore' CD chances are your windows install files are sitting in c:\windows\options\cabs . </s>
<s> You will not be able to change your configuration and reinstall windows unless you burn them to a bootable CD before doing anything else. </s>
<s> Also make an &quot;EBD&quot; (Emergency Boot Disk) and them extract the files from the EBD.Cab and copy them back to the floppy. </s>
<s> They will usually fit. </s>
<s> Check to see if you have a 'D' drive. </s>
<s> If so, then you need to move your C:\My Documents folders to D:\My Documents along with any other disk hog data files such as music/video etc. </s>
<s> Anytime you install new software it should be installed to 'D:\'. </s>
<s> 'C' should only be used for the operating system and bundled software. </s>
