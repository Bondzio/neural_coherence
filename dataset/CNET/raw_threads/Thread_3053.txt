My Seagate Barracuda HD is not being detected in BIOS, and thus wont allow me install Vista. Any help would be appreciated, and any further details easily given. My Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128074 My Hard Drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148288 -Thanks

If you dont see it in the post, you can try going in the bios and check if the channels aren't disabled or anything else disabled. If that doesnt help just look if you connected you hard drive correctly and the power cable is connected, sometimes it will help if you connect to an other port. If you dont see the harddrive in vista, then you have to install the sata drivers so the harddrive can be recognized. When you have to select your harddrive under that screen is an option to install extra drivers, click on it and put in your motherboard disk or your manufacturers driver disk.

Proffitt	1/5/08 6:29 AM	1.19951454E12	all the problems the level of detail and control in the BIOS	I bet if all the hardware is good you didn't configure the BIOS to enable the SATA ports. I decline to read the manual for you on this one since I really need to spend more time on a project here but it sounds like you didn't setup the BIOS. It's not automatic. Bob

When I try to launch with IDE, it asks if I want to swap to AHCI. I thought IDE was with the long ribbon attachment, rather then a SATA cable?

I had some RAID option which made the drives vanish from that BIOS and I get to boot into another BIOS (F10?) to prepare the drives then Vista still wouldn't see them without a diskette. Same story here I fear. You need to try the various permutations and try SATA 1, then 2 connections. But let's try simple. Is the hard disk SPINNING? Bob

7076	8	278561	2671088	2671085	R. Proffitt	1/5/08 12:02 PM	1.19953452E12	AHA. The air gap problem.	SATA power connections look wildly different. Find that power and get it plugged in.

7076	11	278561	2671388	2671028	nutral	1/5/08 5:41 PM	1.19955486E12	HD not detected	I think you are having a problem with the emulation that a lot of motherboards use, the AHCI is a mode of that. IDE means its emulated as an ide drive in the bios and also in installations. If you arent going to run raid like strping (0) or mirroring (1) you can best use the IDE option. becouse its most compatible
7076	12	278561	2671465	2671388	reddog1083	1/5/08 7:37 PM	1.19956182E12	Where to look for SATA HD in BIOS?	So I dont think I hear it spinning, but then I listen to my other computers hard drive and I can not really tell if its spinning either. Under BIOS they have just the IDE Channels 0-5 Master & Slave, but no SATA. So I really cant see if its in BIOS or not.
7076	13	278561	2671678	2671465	R. Proffitt	1/6/08 5:27 AM	1.19959722E12	Have it checked out.	You could lose months on this. Have someone with good hearing check it. Bob
7076	14	278561	2671909	2671465	nutral	1/6/08 10:29 AM	1.19961534E12	sata is ide	You dont see sata becouse the motherboard is settingc the sata drives on the screen As ide harddisks. So all your sata drives look like ide drives but they aren't. Do you see your drives there ?
7076	15	278561	2672702	2671909	reddog1083	1/7/08 8:10 AM	1.1996934E12	Would this matter?	So my motherboard only has one of the long IDE ribbon cable ports, and currently I only have my DVD drive plugged into the &quot;Master&quot; section of the ribbon cable, and then plugged into the slot. I have two people here at work that are telling me that I shouldn't have the &quot;Master&quot; plugged into the DVD drive, rather the &quot;Slave&quot;, so my computer doesn't see the DVD drive as the master, and thus try and load up from there. To me, it wouldn't make since, seeing as how the Hard Drive is SATA, wouldn't that make it on a completeley different channel? But I figured I would ask before I ship my Hard Drive out (already packaged and everything). -Thanks

For example I have this new board and it emulates IDE with SATA but I must be careful which I choose. The manual notes that for emulation (far too many choices for me to write them all here) that I use the SATA 1 and 3 connections will map to the Primary IDE master and slave. The Primary IDE connector in this case is then dead and I have to use the Secondary IDE for my boot DVDRW drive. As to master or slave or CABLE SELECT the type of IDE CABLE I use matters. For 80 Conductor cables I use CS. For 40 conductor cables with one drive I use master and with two drives one master and one slave. Bob

Under SATA 1 it says [Not Detected] but enabled. What gives?? My DVD writer is an IDE and set on Slave - something else I need to fix, but that shouldn't effect the hard drive, right?? The drive is softly clicking about 2x/second - is THAT the right noise?? I never noticed all these noises from my past computers, but now that I have a problem, my ears are pricked!

7076	19	278561	2672950	2672946	lizadove	1/7/08 12:02 PM	1.19970732E12	Soo... any other suggestions??	I have heard you need to format a HD before it's recognized, but how can we do that if we can't even load an OS??
