unless you're a serious gamer, something like an acer aspire 1642zwlm for 425 pounds (inc vat w/centrino 1.7ghz, 512mb, 60gb, dvd burner, 15&quot; widescreen) is hard to beat.
you can probably shop around and get this one for less or a better one still under your budget.
you can tote a laptop to class/library and bring it home on holidays.
in the us, laptops are required at a number of universities as you must bring them to certain classes.
