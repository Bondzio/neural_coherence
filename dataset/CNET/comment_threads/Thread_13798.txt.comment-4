I have the R800 and love.
And, glad to say I'm not having the same problem.
If it's still under warranty, go there.
Sounds like the color rendering in the printer is bad.
It could be a bad ribbon cable.
The good &quot;test&quot; sheet is never printed at full resolution.
Sorry.
and life goes on... Jack
