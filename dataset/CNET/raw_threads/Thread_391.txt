Hi, I have an HP a1600n computer with 2GB RAM (upgraded +1GB) and an Athlon X2 3800+ 2.0 Ghz processor. I use the computer for video editing and gaming. I'd like to get a faster processor, but I had some questions. I'm looking to spend under or around $200. Since I'm already using an AMD processor, will an Intel one not work with my computer? What processor would be best for video editing? Will single core be just as good as dual, becauase I'm not multitasking? Thanks so much for the help!

Heck there are even some AMD processors that won't work with your own set up since there are different sockets for different families of CPUs which is how the CPU plugs into the motherboard. I would suggest looking up which socket, AM2 or 939 being the most likely, that your computer has and then getting the best for that. Looking up that model it seems you have an AM2 socket so you could go to Newegg.com or somewhere similar and look for AM2 processors. There is an AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ Windsor 3.0GHz for $229.99 if you want one of the top ones. I'd suggest a dual core since while you may think you aren't multi-tasking, how sure are you that there aren't services running the background taking up resources? Regards, JB

If you buy a Pentium Processor than you'll have to fork out for a new Mother Board to put that Processor on. The one and only Pentium Processor I ever had blew and when I went to replace it I couldn't find a Pentium of the same type. Since I had to get it done in a big hurry ...as in FAST!!! ... (I was smack dab in the middle of an online college course at the time) I went ahead and switched back to AMD. The Mother Board the Pentium was on was incompatible with AMD. So I had to spend over $350 for BOTH! ...this was in 2003. 2. IMHO AMD is much better in quality than Pentium. In the past and since, I always had AMDs up to the point I tried that Pentium that didn't even last a year! All my puters now have AMDs in them. I'm presently using the one I replaced the CPU and MB in and the others are being stored. NONE of them have any problems. Now, my roomie has an 'older' Pentium 4. My AMD is &quot;equivalent&quot; to a Pentium 3. My puter runs at least three times faster than theirs! Those are only a couple of reason why I will continue to stick with AMD. You can find AMDs that are compatible with your MB that will give you what you're after. Just go to your local computer retailer/repair shop, tell them what MB you have and what you want to do with it, what your budget is, etc. and they'll be able to fix you up with what you need. Hope this helps. GOOD LUCK!

How can I find out what motherboard I have, and is there somewhere I can look online to see what processors will work with my motherboard? If there isn't an easy way, I'll just go to my local computer shop. The Athlon X2 6000+ looks ok- little more than I wanted to spend, but I'll just save longer. Thanks!

It will tell you EVERYthing about your computer and the system running on it. Find Belarc Advisor FREE here in CNet's dowload section. If the puter itself is inoperable, then one must open it up and look at the board to find out what it is. However, if your puter is still under warrenty, opening it yourself WILL Void that warrenty!!! Contact the manufacturer, tell the make, model and serial number to see if they can tell you. They should be able to do this for you. Hope this helps. Good luck!

If you go to specifications it will tell you what socket is used for the CPU. Hp is notorious for using of sizes that are not standard. For instant my HP pavilion 750 uses a mobile processor but it does say that it is a 775 socket so I should be able to purchase any processor that will run on that socket. Most online computer stores such as newegg and pc connection allow you to search for parts by specifications such as the socket type. Also if it is an intel socket you can only use intel processors.
