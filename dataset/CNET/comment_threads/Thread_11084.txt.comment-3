This was my first question.
I was referring to a couple of other posts regarding CD/DVD in this forum.
Sorry if I mislead you.
Thanks for the link to other question/answers.
It did answer one of my questions about jumpers.
I'll try the housekeeping routine first and a CD cleaner.
This isn't my PC.
I was helping a friend and I know she doesn't have the extra money to buy a new CD burner right now so was hoping there might be some other suggestions.
Thanks Patti
