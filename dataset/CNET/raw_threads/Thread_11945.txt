Unfortunately, it can only link to ethernet, and my home has a wireless network. I tried to work around buying another $100 piece of hardware (ethernet bridge) by linking to my Gateway laptop. Unfortunately, the laptop does not have an ethernet connector--just phone and USB, and the DVD player does not have a USB connector. There has to be a gizmo that will let me connect up. I've looked at ethernet-USB connectors and I think they will work, but I thought I'd let you hardware geniuses give me some advice before I spend more money on this setup. Thanks for any suggestions you have.

The WGPS606 was so cheap and worked so well that at 25 I bought two. Let me state that to setup as a bridge you CHEAT and LIE that you are setting it up as a print server but bail out when you get to the print setup. Viola, a bridge.

Connect one to the router via Ethernet and plug it in. Connect the other one (you need two) to the player and plug it in. http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=294&name=Powerline-Networking
