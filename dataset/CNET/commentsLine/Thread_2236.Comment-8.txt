i actually never replaced the original power supply in the gt5032.
have had no issues with it even under a load.
i have had no problems at all with the bfg 7800 gt oc card out of the box.
when i put in the card i didn't notice the manufacturer's requirements for a 400 watt power supply, but have experienced no issues at all with the stock gateway 300w ps.
i am using the integrated sound card and i do not use the tv tuner card at all.
like i said i have had great luck with this system/card set-up.
