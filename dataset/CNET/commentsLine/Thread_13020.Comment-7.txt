aha, now we have some info.
you are connecting a wide (16-bit) drive to a narrow (8-bit) controller.
in this one drive configuration, you must jumper the drive to terminate the bus at himself.
moreover you must (probably thru scsi bios setup or on board jumpers) terminate the bus on the symbios board.
then you may have a shot at it working, but technically it's an illegal configuration.
bob is probably right, however before you spend your $50 on an ide drive, consider buying a wide scsi controller (68 pins) (the adaptec aha2940uw is available at around that price).
this plus a wide (68 pin cable) s/b all you need.
the disk id can be anywhere except 7 since that is reserved for the controller board.
if the 68-pin cable you get has more than 2 connectors, you will need a cable terminator for the last connector on the the cable, in which case drive termination s/b turned off.
benefits: legal configuration, double the bus speed of the single 8-bit card you now have, room for expansion if desired.
scsi is challenging, but rewarding.
more useful for servers than pc's (in general).
usually more expensive due to a lower volume market.
