thanks for the advice, shylaugh.
an attorney friend recommended i send a registered letter to dell, and explain that i do not want them to call me at work.
(my payments always seem to be late, even though i mail them way in advance.)
so today i am writing my letter and asking that they contact me in writing in the future.
once they receive my letter, if they again call me at work i will have a legal case against their harassment.
would you mind sharing the address where you sent your letter?
they have so many addresses, i don't know where to send it.
thanks much!
stephanie
