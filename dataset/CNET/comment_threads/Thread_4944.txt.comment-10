When makers rewrite the networking book we'll have to match the old names to what they write today.
That's a bridge mode and can harbor a firewall.
Domains are going to tax even the most season IT staff as the Domain Servers must be configured just so.
But I wonder if you have confused domains with workgroups?
If you have different workgroup names you have to correct that.
