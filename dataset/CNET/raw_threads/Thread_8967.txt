However, I do have a scheduled time when I disconnect everyone from the Internet, so I am the only one online. I have secured our wireless connection with a complicated network name and password, so our roommate cannot get online wirelessly.

You can google research P2P so no need for me to write what that is. -&gt; Let say you used a complicated name and password on a WEP protected network. Today's easy to use tools can get that information in about 2 minutes. Go figure why they offer WEP. Bob
