i downloaded the 4in1, usb, and video drivers.
i have installed from their cd and the downloads.
same thing.
i built this animal and it did work fine, it's just with the reinstall of xp it messed up.
i do have an error with the &quot;nec pci to usb open host controller&quot; i tried the nec site and they aim me at microsoft, no help there.
as i said i do have a pci device with 5 usb 2 ports and three firewire ports; it doesn't work either.
the model is f 2007 made by koutech.com.
