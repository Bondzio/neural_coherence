as i understand it, tec dates are a prediction that critical hdd parameters will exceed a level that are considered to be a sign of impending [theoretical] failure.
however, the unreliable nature of tec dates diminishes progressively as the amount of data gathered increases.
hence it takes any of these predictive applications time to gather sufficient data for an accurate tec prediction.
this is presumably why reinstallation following an install produces different tec predictions, since the available data set is smaller after installation than it was previously and hence the prediction is not the same.
-doh!
