I have ordered a Dell m1330 with a 64 gb SSd drive.
My thought was to buy an external 2.5&quot; drive and enclosure using USB.
I realized that the Dell has SATAII but no port.
Can I use an express card with SATA ports to connect with the Dell for data and use an external power supply for power or use a usb connector for power.
Any specific hardware suggestions?
Will it work?
Hard drive suggestions 320gb?
Enclosure suggestions?
Thanks
