1.1.1	So I recently bought parts to build a new computer to replace my old one , and I bought a Spire Swordfin SP-9007B from newegg.com where as after I recived it I noticed that the case does n't seem to have any normal slots for hard drives that I can see .	St
1.1.2	The place in the case where it looks like it 's meant to go & quot ; underneath the floppy and cd drives & quot ; there are two metal walls with lots of big oval shaped holes , but no places for screws to fit and the open sides face both the case doors .	St
1.1.3	The case did n't include any manuals or instructions and the people on the Spire website refuse to even respond to my emails .	St
1.1.4	If anyone can shed some light on my problem I would be very thankful .	St
1.2.1	Does it look like this ?	Ques
1.2.2	http : //www.spirecoolers.com/case.asp ? ProdID=14	Ques
1.3.1	Yikes , that 's pretty different from the inside of my case which has everything except the hard drive bays .	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the help .	St
1.3.3	Ugh I do n't think spire is going to pay for the shipping on their own mistake .	St
