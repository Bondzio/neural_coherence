do you realize how little information you have supplied?
you at least have to tell us what os you are trying to install, and a lot more info about the environment is also needed.
with many os's you can wipe the drive and repartition it during install, others you need to format the drive, but you give us nothing to go on.
how many hard drives in the system?
