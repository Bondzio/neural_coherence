Everytime I print something on my Dell A940 printer the job completes but the printer status box does not fully delete the job.
I have to go into Task Manager on my Windows XP and find two processes (DLBAJSWX.EXE and DLBAPSWX.exe) and manually end the processes to free up the printer for the next project.
Any idea what's up?
