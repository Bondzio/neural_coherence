I am a gamer but at this time, with my Gateway Pentium III, I am not able to play the game I like. The requirements for this game is -Operating System: Windows 98/2000/ME/XP -Processor: 1GHz or greater -RAM: 512 MB -Video Card: DirectX 9 compatible. Pixel shader and vertex shader compatible hardware with 64 MB of texture memory -Sound Card: DirectSound compatible audio hardware The game is every-expanding, so need more room for expansion. I don't know where to start. I have heard it is easy to build your own computer. I cannot afford to pay $2000+ for a system at this time, but think if I buy the components and make one myself, I can afford to do it. After looking up the components, I am totally comfused. Any suggestions? Really what I need is a baseline on what I need.

I just put together the following system AMD 64 /3000 - 512 Mem - 80G SATA HD - CD/DVD burner - ATI 9800 Video card - EPox MB OS XP Home SP2. I used my old CRT and accessories. Total cost with taxes and shipping came to a shade more than $800 total. I used Newegg.com for most of the parts. They have reviews of the parts as well as very good customer service. You will learn about all the different choises you have available on Chip and Motherboard combinations. For cost reasons I choose the AMD 64 vs the Intel chip. You can get some good buys on AMD XP chips but they are at the end of their development. I figured I could go with the 754 socket in the AMD 64 line and get a couple more years of service by up grading the CPU when the prices drop on the 3800+ versions.
