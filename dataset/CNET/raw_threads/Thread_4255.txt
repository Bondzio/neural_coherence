I had a Win XP Compaq laptop but it's screen broke and it was old anyways so i bought a new HP Pavilion dv2000. This one has vista installed. Next i thought I'd get my old data on the new laptop and then keep my old Seagate 2.5' 120GB hard drive as an external one. It seemed simple but it's been driving me crazy for 3 days. I searched many topics but nobody has this problem. Anyways, i bought a Coolpodz IDE enclosure and hooked it up and everything. The laptop recognizes that a disk drive has been plugged http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=safeix5.jpg but i can't see it on My Computer. Disk management says this: http://img184.imageshack.us/img184/355/unreadak1.jpg I am starting to get really pissed off with this thing, although i am pretty sure it's something simple (maybe a faulty enclosure). By the way i have tried setting it as master, as slave and even tried a brand new Western Digital 120Gb hdd but still same results . Same thing on my desktop which runs WinXp , so i'm guessing it's not vista's fault. Any help appreciated.

There is another method where we use a DESKTOP and a laptop drive adapter along with these titles. If those fail in the desktop the next stop is to ask http://www.drivesavers.com Bob

12025	11	278754	2672756	2672754	R. Proffitt	1/7/08 8:45 AM	1.1996955E12	Here's an adapter I use.	Link -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=HD-108&cat=HDD Then I can use these tools on a desktop to get back drives that we can't in the USB enclosures. Some consumers won't be able to do this so they'll have to deal with http://www.drivesavers.com or similar. Bob PS. Don't fret it if we are hitting the limits of home data recovery. It happens and is how most learn that they need to address their backup plans.
