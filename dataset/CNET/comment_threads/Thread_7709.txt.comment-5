i don't want this to happen again either.
so i suppose i put two posts in one.
sorry about that.
anyways, Ive already set up the return, so now its a data backup question i suppose.
i don't want the hassle of having to make backups every day, or of having to restart it all if this happens again.
i thought RAID was the answer.
if one drive fails it just uses the other, which was just a clone.
maybe i was lied to about RAID ha ha.
