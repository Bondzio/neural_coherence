It gets set up when you try and connect to a wireless printer or try to connect directly to someone else's PC. It can be called anything but hpsetup seems to be the most common. Ok...my question is WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE THIS RUNNING ALL THE TIME???? I am just figuring out a problem with my conference rooms and WiFi. It seems if you get two laptops broadcasting hpsetup, they sit there and crank out tons of RF apparently saying to each other &quot;Hey you want to connect? No? Ok how about now?&quot; Over and over. That RF then gets picked up by the mics that are sitting directly in front of the laptops and it screws up the sound going to the other end. This seem SO insecure. Why is my IT department not freaking out? It seems that if I had an open network connection broadcasting my MAC address all the time even with the lid closed in standby mode, that it could cause some issues. I have done tests over the last few days and I can walk down the executive hallway and see about half of the laptops because they are broadcasting hpsetup. Plus I can connect to the adhoc network without them ever knowing I did it. Im not a hacker so I dont know what I can do, but Im sure one of you freaks could figure something out. It just seems very strange. Is there something I don't know? What the heck else are people using this for?
