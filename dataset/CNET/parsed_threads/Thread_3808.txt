<s> I am attaching a Maxtor DiamondMax 10 80GB drive via USB2 and dedicated power supply. </s>
<s> The connector is a generic 2.5/3.5in & SATA connector with a power brick for direct disk power. </s>
<s> I have had no issues whatsoever when using this in conjunction with 2.5in drives (obviously bus powered). </s>
<s> Whether set as master or slave, upon discovery, the screen goes black and my computer (XP) goes down and restarts. </s>
<s> This is a new one on me. </s>
<s> I think for literally a few milliseconds there's a blue screen in there however it is impossible to pick up what it is saying before it's black and we're rebooting. </s>
<s> I'm seeing a couple of references from around crash time in the Event Viewer: Service Control Manager (EventID 7000) The General Purpose USB Driver (adildr.sys) service failed to start due to the following error: The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it. </s>
<s> And SideBySide (EventID 32 & 59) Resolve Partial Assembly failed for Microsoft.VC80.MFCLOC. </s>
<s> Reference error message: The referenced assembly is not installed on your system. </s>
<s> Any similar experiences or ideas? </s>
<s> By unchecking the box in System Properties, I am pausing the blue screen error before auto-restart: &quot;IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_EQUAL .... Tech info: STOP: 0x0000000A (0x00000018,0x00000002,0x00000000,0x804F6809)&quot; This IS known to be a problem drive - one for which I am trying to determine if there is any recoverable data. </s>
<s> Did you get any drivers with this disk? </s>
<s> The site below gives more information on 0xA Stop errors. </s>
<s> http://aumha.org/a/stop.htm I hope it helps. </s>

<s> Plug in the power supply before connecting the USB cord. </s>
<s> Thanks for those replies. </s>
<s> It was indeed the effect of a virus that had corrupted the partition table which in turn crashed on all attempts to mount it - whether connection was in Windows or some boot level utilities. </s>
<s> I've had some difficult disk recoveries before but this was nasty. </s>
<s> Happily all went well and all files were recovered on both partitions before restoring the disk to working order. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> How did you discover the problem was a virus? </s>
<s> And how did you dispose of the virus? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Late night frustration/oversight/slip in security when it slipped onto my test machine when I booted into a Linux install. </s>
<s> It displayed the same errors intermittently, other times booting into windows but to no practical level (100% cpu etc.) </s>
<s> and limited use in safe mode. </s>
<s> Naturally (and fortunately) I have an image and spare disk for the test machine. </s>
<s> Quickly restored and sobered by the infection, I changed tack/came to my senses with jumper settings CS w/CLJ and managed to mount one partition for long enough to rebuild the PT and snag the vital files. </s>
<s> The device still wasn't recognised in other environs but another switch in jumpers opened up the possibilities with some other utilities to see and scrub all partitions just like a new disk. </s>
<s> I could also just sense the disk was mechanically sounding just fine. </s>
<s> What was the virus? </s>
<s> I cannot identify but it basically seemed to have corrupted the PT to a level it was impossible to access the device without freezing the computer in this not uncommon way (hence the difficulty in tracing the core issue). </s>
<s> I suspect it is engineered this way! </s>
<s> I know very little about malware that affects boot records, partition data - not that I really want to have any more experience of them but I'm curious if someone can shed more light on these particular symptoms. </s>
<s> Why not discuss this in out Virus and Security Alerts forum here; http://forums.cnet.com/5204-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&tag=dir.forum The experts are there, and if they haven't seen this before they would be most interested. </s>
<s> I'm intrigued you discovered this when booting up into Linux. </s>
<s> Do you think this was a Linux infection then? </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> Any proof? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> To clarify, the virus did not appear in Linux but when I rebooted into Windows, having connected the device whilst booted into Linux. </s>
<s> My assumption, and it is only an assumption, is that my test machine NTFS disk was exposed at this point and no other that I can estimate. </s>
<s> That one disk has a partition failure is no reason to conclude virus. </s>
<s> That these absolute partition failures, which I have never before encountered, now happen together, in this manner, and in this sequence of events - this kind of contagious hardware failure is too much coincidence for me. </s>
<s> On top of that, I have before encountered the effect of malware that prevents the start-up of key windows services in normal start-up mode, hogging the CPU, whilst in safe mode, the disk is fine but AV resident shield was not loaded and 'locked out'. </s>
<s> No network connections possible. </s>
<s> This is the same - the partition business is a new one to me but I've read about it. </s>
<s> My objective was to recover irreplacable files and, if possible, the disk - which I did. </s>
<s> Alas for the sake of this discussion, the possibility of further research into whether this was a virus, and if so which, has now gone as I have restored the disk to good working order with a fresh OS install. </s>
<s> The same thing happens every time I power up the USB DVD drive with the computer running. </s>
<s> Upon crashing, I reboot XP with the DVD drive still running and there is no problem until I repower the DVD drive again. </s>
<s> Seems to be a power issue. </s>
