i'm looking for the right approach on adding some devices to my home network.
i have a dual band netgear wndr3700 router running both g and n. that router is downstairs but my son has his laptop, xbox and new desktop in his bedroom with no wired ethernet.
at first i was just going to buy a wireless n adaptor for his desktop but then thought we'd be better off with a wireless access point and then connect each of his three devices to it with gigabit ethernet.
does that seem like the right solution?
if so what access points support n and gigbit ethernet?
if that is not viable then which netgear wireless adaptor will give the best performance?
seems like a pci card will give better performance than a usb adaptor?
thanks.
