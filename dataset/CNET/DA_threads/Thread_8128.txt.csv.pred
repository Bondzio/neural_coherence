1.1.1	i have an old comp laying around and i want to make a gaming pc so my dad has let me open it up for an upgrade .	St
1.1.2	byt the way the computer is an old Dell Dimension 3000 heres what i plan to put in a nvidia geforce 8800 GT for 250 $ 2 gigs of ram for 69 $ and a 320gig HD for 80 $ my only concern is if my dell can run the 8800 ?	Ques
1.1.3	any other things u guys notice lem me know	St
1.2.1	It depends on the available slots .	St
1.2.2	For video cards that 's AGP ( old ) , PCI ( common ) and PCI-E ( latest ) .	St
1.2.3	Check the specs of both your PC and the videocard to see if there 's a match .	St
1.2.4	Also , this being an OLD machine , check if can handle 2 Gb RAM , a 320 Gb hard disk , and if the CPU is fast enough to handle the games you want .	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.6	Kees	St
1.3.1	sorry but i am an idiot when it comes to this ... so how would i go about checking these things ?	Ques
1.3.2	also can a pentium 4 work with the GT ?	Ques
1.4.1	It 's at http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim3000/en/SM/index.htm Ouch ! ! ! .	St
1.4.2	This unit has a 250 WATT PSU and no AGP or PCIe slots .	St
1.4.3	Not only does it not have a slot for the AGP or newer PCIe card but the power supply is n't up to the task .	St
1.4.4	- & gt ; Sorry .	St
1.4.5	No .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	so i buy a new power supply that aint that big a deal ?	Ques
1.5.2	and is there anything i can do to add PCI slot ?	Ques
1.6.1	But for this video card you need AGP or PCIe slots which your machine does n't have .	St
1.6.2	A new motherboard could mean new RAM , new power supply and a new LICENSE to the OS since it 's usually locked to the old hardware .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	basically it means that you would have to replace 90 % of the stuff in the computer if you wanted to upgrade ...	St
1.7.2	Your better off building or buying a new system .	St
1.7.3	-as a side note you can build your own system with specs ( including the parts you used ) for about $ 800 .	St
1.7.4	Something to consider .	St
1.8.1	find one , you could n't install it in your system .	St
1.8.2	Your system does n't have a PCIe slot .	St
1.8.3	Anyone that has a decent price on the 8800GT does n't have 'em in stock .	St
1.8.4	As others have indicated ... you 're better off getting a new box with the desired peripherals and the video card you want .	St
1.8.5	To keep your cost down you could also look at the new ATI 3800 series ... they are available from the $ 175 to the $ 220 ( and more for some vendors ) VAPCMD	Sug
1.9.1	do ATI cards also need PCI e or AGP ?	Ques
1.10.1	Your Dell System has 'built-in or what some call onboard graphics & quot ; .	St
1.10.2	Systems using onboard graphics use regular system memory for video RAM .	St
1.10.3	So if your system has 256MBs system RAM ... .and if your onboard video system was using 64MBs RAM ... your usable system memory would be reduced to 192MBs RAM .	St
1.10.4	Your Dell Dimension 3000 has 3 expansion slots for peripherals but they 're not PCIe ( the latest and greatest ) and not AGP ( the previous generation latest and greatest ) it has PCI .	St
1.10.5	So the only video card you could buy and add to your current system would have to be PCI .	St
1.10.6	That 's the only interface option your system has for adding peripherals like graphics cards .	St
1.10.7	Given the limitations a PCI video card places on gaming performance you 're better off selling the existing system and putting your $ $ into a system designed for gaming .	St
1.10.8	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	I do n't know if you 've made a decision about your plans to upgrade .	St
1.11.2	May I suggest you reconsider and add a few more dollars to the $ 400 upgrade estimate and get something more powerful and new .	Sug
1.11.3	The Celeron processor that comes with the Dimension 3000 is not a gaming processor , even if you can put the graphics card you want in it .	St
1.11.4	That processor is barely good enough to multi task regular office applications .	St
1.11.5	Look at TigerDirect.com Go to motherboard / CPU combos link .	St
1.11.6	Sort by price .	St
1.11.7	They have a great motherboard with a GE Force 8400 video card for around $ 100 after rebate .	St
1.11.8	Add a dual-core cpu , cpu fan , and 2 gig of high speed RAM ( $ 29 after rebate ) and you 've spent barely $ 400 ( without shipping ) , which gives you room to ad a nice hard drive .	St
1.11.9	Good luck .	Polite
1.12.1	The XP OS that came with that XP wo n't transplant .	St
