The cnet review of this computer states that the max video RAM supported is 256. Is this because the integrated nVidia GeForce 6150 card is 256MB or is the something else (like the motherboard) limiting the amount of video RAM supported? In other words if I bought a 512MB graphics card would be a waste? Thanks! donatena

But a laptop was another type of machine where you wanted portability, battery powered for as many hours as possible. I get the feeling you are not looking for the usual laptop but a desktop in the shape of a laptop. For these you pay a premium. In parting, it's rare to almost non-existent the number of laptops with user upgradeable video. Be sure you get that item right. Bob

I'm looking to upgrade the video card to run more graphic intensive games. I am not sure if for some reason the computer's max video memory (256MB) is limited by more than the video card itself. So if I bought a 512MB graphics card would it not work or only work like a 256MB card? donatena

You can fit newer cards and the drivers and get more video RAM. But 256MB is plenty for most games and Vista's Aero effects. What needs a 512MB video card? Bob

I've been reading reviews on xbitlabs.com for about a year now, and from what I gather 512MB isn't needed for anything yet. However, some of the more advanced cards are coming with a 512 MB option. I probably won't buy a new video card for at least 6 months, but when I do the 512 MB cards might be more the norm. I just wanted to be sure that if I bought one I was going to be able to utilize all 512MB. Thanks again for the help. I spoke with reps at circuit city and HP and neither seemed to know what I was asking. donatena

It supports up to 256MB video memory, meaning that it &quot;steals&quot; some of your much slower system RAM to get to 256MB for display purposes. nVidia calls its shared memory technology TurboCache and ATI calls it HyperMemory. It may be found integrated into motherboards or separately in video cards. In desktops, these cards are the less expensive, lower performance alternatives to the other video cards that have their own dedicated (not shared) video memory. If you are a gamer, then you will want to upgrade to a better card.

If I upgrade to a dedicated card do I need to worry about disabling the integrated card or will the installation of the new card solve that problem during installation? Thanks
