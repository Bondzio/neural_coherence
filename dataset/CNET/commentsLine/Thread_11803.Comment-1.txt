i'm buying a new rig soon.considering an amd phenom ii 1090 t with a gigabyte ga-790 xta-ud4 board,and 8 gigs or ddr3 dual channel memory.though i'm not a &quot;gamer&quot; i do however edit and compile a lot of dvd's in keeping up with my grand kids.i already have 2 evga geforce 9500 gt video cards and just can't find a link to see if they are compatible with this rig.really like to find out before i buy it.anybody know where i can get that info?
