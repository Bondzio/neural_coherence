You could have a weak or failing PSU(power supply) or the infamous bad caps on mtrbd.. Google(for example) for bad caps, but inspect the mtrbd.
for leaking, distorted or bulging caps(capacitors).
Since, you have a 1.8Mhz system that suggests you had it for awhile as that's dated and/or been around.
In that time the PSU has aged and possibly on its last legs.
The bad caps is known problem from bad manufacture of caps.
In either case, replace, I suggest the PSU, first unless you see bad caps.
