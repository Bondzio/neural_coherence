first, are you totally against mirroring your scsi drive?
depending on the type, an extra scsi drive could only be about $200 (fujitsu 74gb 10k rpm).
windows server can manage the mirror for you even if you don't have a hardware raid controller.
as for a sata raid controller, tomshardware recently ran a roundup (sans any adaptec since they don't have any pci-express raid cards):  i wouldn't use any standard pci raid controller in a server nowadays since drives are fast enough to exceed the bus limits... stick with 66mhz pci, pci-x or pci-express.
i've had good experience with highpoint's rocketraid line but if you need tech support, lsi logic would be a better (but more expensive) choice.
rocketraid 2310 ($140, pci-express x4, software raid):  lsi logic sas/sata ($210, pci-express x4, hardware raid) *my recommendation*:  if you get a sata controller, i strongly recommend you install it in a test server/pc first.
