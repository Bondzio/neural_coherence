Samsung 10.1 ATT OS 4.1.2 using FF browser that started crashing daily and many times multiple times......Mozilla search must added to more frustration.
....did a OS update and ATT had none.....yes.
leared cache and if I clear all data then it means anothe half hour trying to remember how I set up sync again...
The selling point of FF is the ability to use the SYNC function and can access all webpags in my bookmarks with password log ins if an other browser did this I would dump FF in a second......
So now awaiting your feedback.....thanks much....
