Now intermittently we are loosing the LAN connectivity i.e we are not able to ping any system from any node inside the hospital network for sometimes, after some time it will start working and then again it will stops again.We are using procurve switches and also we are not using any router. Can anybody suggest me what is the problem?

This requires someone who knows how to log into the switches and look and see how traffic flows when it works and how it flows when it does not. This could be anything from spanning tree to mac table timeout settings. If you do not KNOW what the 2 previously mentioned things are you need to get help from someone who does. It could be many other things. When you run business network you need to learn at least the basics or hire someone who does.

When you find a business that is having this issue you begin the usual work of replacing the first dumb switch with a better one. Now you can see if your ping made it to the now smarter switch. It was not funny when some IT staffer was out of date and out of touch on this. The company finally had to let them go. Bob
