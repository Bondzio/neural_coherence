Where I'm stuck is in deciding between a single 150Gb 10,000rpm SATA150 drive, and 4 7200rpm SATA 3Gb/s drives in a RAID10 array. I know that the RAID10 will give me added security due to its data redundancy, but am unsure of how performance will compare to the single 10krpm drive. Basically, if I'm looking at a dramatic performance hit with the RAID configuration, I'd be willing to sacrifice security. FWIW, I'm going to be using this in a Dual Xeon Quad-core 3D graphics/video editing machine. Thanks for any and all recommendations! -num

How does RAID (any version) help in light that better than 9 out of 10 times that delete key was the error? Also since that's the common cause, data recovery is nearly impossible or too costly since most getdataback tools don't work on RAID. Bob
7235	2	246358	2479509	2479310	numlok	5/6/07 9:58 AM	1.17844548E12	Actually...	Actually, the majority (say 6 or so) data loss issues my company has had have been due soley to hardware error. Several went to data-recovery services (who confirmed the hardware-based error base), while several just ended up on a stack of &quot;bad&quot; drives. The worst case was a single external Lacie 1Tb drive. We run multiple levels of security (hardware/software firewall, site-licensed anti-virus), and our user base is extremely familiar with proper saftey protocols. The drive configurations I'm asking about will be for single-user workstations, so I'm actually leaning toward no RAID data redundancy, since the most critical data WILL be saved to our network storage (which IS data-redundant). Thanks for your input anyhow.

They were able to recover just over 100Gb off the drive (unfortunately lacking directory structure), and it ran just over $1200. They're convenient since they're just across the bridge in Novato (we're in SF). What exactly is your point, and how does it relate to the original question of &quot;SATA150 10Krpm vs. SATA3Gb+RAID&quot;? ???

Plus the more common failures are not something RAID helps on. We've seen more luck with automatic backups to other machines on the network as well as real backup systems than RAID. Just sharing what I've seen over the years. If you were looking for some speed tests or such may I suggest tomshardware.com since they recently did some comparisons of RAID chipsets. Bob

7235	7	246358	2479948	2479925	numlok	5/6/07 8:31 PM	1.17848346E12	Thanks.	Good info. The only controller I'm planning on using is the one built into the Tyan S2696A2NRF Motherboard ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813151048 ). At the moment, I'm actually leaning toward using two Raptors striped (Raid 0), and relying on the network storage for really important data backup. Make sense? Thanks again!
7235	8	246358	2480341	2479948	ramarc	5/7/07 8:35 AM	1.1785269E12	more info	intel's built-in raid controllers on their server boards are pretty good (but a bit feature starved). your backup strategy (like most people's) doesn't appear to include image backups. so, if either drive fails, you'll have to reinstall the OS and all of your software. even if you ghost a bare install to the replacement drive(s), you'll still lose a day or two. if you don't do image backups and daily incrementals, then i recommend a mirror for the os and apps. the difference between 7200rpm and 10000rpm drives for app loading/interaction is minimal. (for a server, the faster access time raptors provide is a big benefit, but for a workstation you won't see that much improvement in your daily activities.) the raptors speed will be seen in pagefile/scratchfile performance and reading/writing large datasets (like video editting, big photoshop images, etc.). that same speed benefit can be achieved with 2 7200rpm drives in a stripe set. as for relying on the network as your main backup method, the wisdom of that all depends on the backup policy of your network. aslo, simply copying files to the network is not a good backup strategy. some type of full backup (at least for your data files tree) along with incrementals/differentials is essential.
7235	9	246358	2480333	2480341	numlok	5/7/07 9:05 AM	1.1785287E12	Workflow	Thanks again for the insight. I think we'll probably get external drives to do nightly local-machine backups. It might help to clarify the type of work we do: We are a 3D Animation Studio, and use primarily 3D Studio Max in combination with Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. Scene/video/texture and working files all get incrementally saved to the network, with no work-related files saved on the local machines (other than temporarily). The only &quot;real&quot; things that should be on the local workstations are program files, plugins, email, and such. Sometimes large video files (several thousand frames) get copied locally in order to speed up editing. We do need to use both a lot of large static bitmaps (texure maps), as well as dynamic video files (rendering/editing HD 1080P). The machines will have QuadroFX 46000 video cards, but having done this type of work for close to 15 years now, I know that every little ounce of performance you can squeeze out of the rest of the system will help. So, I think I'm going to do a striped pair of Raptors and attach external drives for the sole purpose of nightly backups. Should do the trick, no? I'm hoping to get all the pieces this week, and will post pics once they're all together.

Built for speed, with nightly external backups for the parachute. Thanks again, and wish me luck!
