I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab2 .. mini tablet .. LOVE IT .. and I'm 71 3/4s!
It is Android OS, can get Kindle app as well as Nook app, many many apps, as well as email, internet, etc .. and it fits easily into a purse/messanger bag-type to carry with you.
Of course the best thing is the cost ..
I had originally purchased the Kindle Fire HD to replace my several years old Kindle keyboard .. then started looking at the difference in price between it ($199) and having a 'real' computer - the Samsung was $249 .. so for $50 more I received MUCH more and I love it!
