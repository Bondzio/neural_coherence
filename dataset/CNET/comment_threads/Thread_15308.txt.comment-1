I'm looking to buy a new desktop computer but it seems like a monitor is nearly 1/3 of the price.
Do certain brands crap out on you?
What kind do you have?
I was looking at newegg.com and there's an Acer 17&quot; LCD for only $285.
Oh btw I either want a cheap LCD or a flat screen tube, at 17&quot; (under about $350.
Yeah I know it limits the LCDs, that's why I'm looking more towards a flat tube.)
So I would appreciate any recommendations.
Thanks.
