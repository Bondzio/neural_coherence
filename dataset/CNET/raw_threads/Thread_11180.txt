After re-installing XP-Pro using the Compaq disk, then use a second disk to install several more drivers - including ATI M22/24 video. Everything worked OK until the driver is installed; then the screen becomes horribly fuzzy(can't think of a better description) and you can barely read anything- as it was before. Sometimes booting stops at a black screen. I've loaded drivers from MS automatic update, from ATI, and from HP(with their on-line help), but everytime any graphics/video driver is loaded, disaster hits. I've even done the whole routine with a different hard drive, with the same result. The only remedy is to Restore from Safe Mode- or reinstall the OS again. Without the ATI graphics, it's obviously sluggish, but it works. I think there is a problem with the graphics part of the motherboard because it's relatively OK before a driver &quot;activates&quot; it. This wouldn't be such a big deal on a desktop- just stick a new card in it. So, any idea why installing a graphics driver kills it? I think it's a hardware flaw.

A new MB from HP is like $799, or one from Ebay for maybe $300, plus the time and hassle to change it (not my favorite chore). I don't think the owner is willing to spend that much at this point, but if a new MB was the only way, then we'd be able to make a decision on it. But I can't buy one just to try it. I asked the question hoping somebody had a similar experience, or as &quot;is there any possible solution that I'm not aware of&quot;- short of a new MB. I have a feeling I may be owning this laptop if it comes cheaply enough.

I often test such machines with a linux CD to see if the graphics choke under linux. If it fails in Linux it surely is a machine with issues. -&gt; About the board swap. This is where HP and such has it all over the little guy. They have the boards and can do the test, call in the engineers and more. But your description is just like what I've seen with failed video ram. However since we can't replace that with ease or safely then the board swap is the right way. Bob

I do have a Ubuntu CD if I get it back. Like most others, I'm much more conservative when working on other people's computers, but if it were mine, let it rip! That's how I learn.
