I had to decrease the resolution. And darkstar has an option to turn off shadows, which greatly increased performance. In the support forum for the game they told me to put the program darkstar.exe in the the exceptions list turning off dep or wep, or something like that. If after decreasing resolution and reinstalling directx still the same thing happens, its probably something you're just going to have to live with with that game. Darkstar one always quits on me.

I had the same problem when running even simple games, I ran some tests on it and found that the CPU was getting very hot. Upon further research I found that this whole line of CPU's runs notoriously hot. I'd recommend downloading a program to check your temp. If its too hot, try buying some better thermal grease (I use Arctic Silver.) Apply that to your Athlon and give it a try. I had to do it a couple times to get the right amount, too much = too hot, too little = too hot. That should fix the problem, your comp is doing exactly what mine did.
