Anyway, my question is about the durability of disc, at least the ability to withstand extreme temperature. I get discs from an online rental service and when some, I put them in the mailbox overnight in order not the miss the mail carrier when they come. Now since I live in the middle of nowhere, theft is not an issue. My concern is with temperature. Here in the south, it can get down to about 40 degrees at night. Is this safe for these discs sitting in a standard US mailbox?
