I desperatly need a new computer and have no desire (nor ability) to build my own.
I was going to buy a Dell, but a friend told me about Cyber Power Inc, however their reviews suck.
I've also check Ibuypower.com and Monarch computers, which is the best website to buy a decent computer from?
Thanks for any help, this is driving me crazy Coreth5
