By that, do you mean the circle to square RJ45 to RJ11 connection?
Thi will be used to link the server to the phone line to ue it a a fax server - only for sending faxes, the fax machine will recieve them.
There are no switched hubs on the network, currently there is 1 wireless modem router serving all of the connections, which travelling to the far office is very patchy and almost always not working, hence the reason for going wired.
Router(2) is a Belkin wireless modem router - I'm hoping it will work, but if not then I will have to try another one, I wouldn't be too surpried if it didn't work to be honest.
I don't need it wireless a there is the main router jut metre away.
Router (3) is a Linksys 1-port access point that I am fairly sure will work without hassle, although it may need upgrading should more data ports be required.
Can someone also tell me - there is one RJ45 port with both data and voice signals in it - would it damage either a phone or a computer if it was connected, or should the data cables only have pins 1,2,3,6 and voice only have pins 4,5 connected?
Thanks for getting back to me.
