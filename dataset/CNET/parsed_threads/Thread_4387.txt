<s> Is it worth getting an iPad 3 or waiting until Windows tablets come out? </s>
<s> The most I would be willing to spend on a tablet would be $500 and I haven't heard any price ranges on a Windows tablet. </s>
<s> If you want a tablet that gives you greater flexibility, go for the windows tablet but note that it may be unable to give you the same performance as an iPad. </s>
<s> The iPad is less likely to lag and is easier to use but limits the apps you can get. </s>
<s> Personally, I prefer the iPad. </s>
<s> Do you prefer the iPad because it's less likely to lag and easier or other reasons? </s>
<s> I don't own a tablet and am considering one and am trying to decide what would work best for me. </s>
<s> Who would want a Windows tablet now? </s>
<s> Well OK. </s>
<s> If you want to shell out $1500 for a slate. </s>
<s> But for iPad level ( hardware/price point ) MS has spent a decade proving it can't do a good job in that arena. </s>
<s> Maybe when Win 8 has been out for a while, but not now. </s>
<s> As for iPad, given the hardware you will be overpaying. </s>
<s> What's the matter with Android? </s>
<s> Since I write apps and more for Windows, a tablet form would be great for the sales pitch. </s>
<s> Let's say there is a need for such a thing and in your world, no need. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Just curious.....Why do you prefer Android over an iPad. </s>
<s> I'm trying to decide and opinions are helpful. </s>
<s> $300 at Best Buy right now. </s>
<s> Smooth experience, Hulu, Flash, Chrome, King Office. </s>
<s> You can plug a memory cards into it, regular USB devices like keyboards and thumbdrives. </s>
<s> It pretty much just works. </s>
<s> What do you plan to use the Tablet for? </s>
<s> Chances are, you will get far more mileage with the iPad 3 then Windows Tablet. </s>
<s> W-Tab is yet to be released, the app selection will be tiny compared to iOS or Android. </s>
<s> Android also suffers from consistent support. </s>
<s> Most Android tables do not have easy OS upgrades, and incomplete hardware support. </s>
<s> There are very good reasons why iPad dominates tablets, will over 60% of tablet sales. </s>
<s> An iPad 1 can be updated to the latest iOS 5.1.1 (and like iOS 6). </s>
<s> Of course iPad has limits, so consider that when you look at when you decide. </s>
<s> Bottom line: wait a few months on how successful the Windows tab is before you decide to spend your money. </s>
<s> For the price the hardware tends to be underpowered. </s>
<s> Yeah yeah, the people that buy the unuderpowered equipment all say specs don't matter, but I see the car commercials which talk about acceleration, mpg, cyuclinders etc. </s>
<s> Seems that put in the proper perspective specs do matter. </s>
<s> There is not any Tablets has better touch screen then ipad 3. </s>

<s> Though ipad3 far better than the windows 8 tablet, to suit your budget i would suggest you to go for the windows 8 tablet. </s>
<s> It would cost around $500 - $700. </s>
<s> I had thought the samething untill I saw this review http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHcxMKDKCiU With win 8 probably hitting the stores in October, investors are investing in win 8 and It will kill premium mac PCs. </s>
<s> Windows 8 is the simply amazing. </s>
<s> Win 8 tablets can do everything that ipad does but ipad cannot do everything that win 8 does. </s>
<s> I think it depends on you taste...if you want a high-performance mean flexible lag free machine then choose i pad 3 ....but the problem or sometimes the advantage of i OS is that Apple had kept in a prison or a closed box so that nothing can affect you from outside...you are safe and secure whatever happens .....and i Tunes,and the well flourished application Eco system makes i pad 3 an irresistible choice.... but if u want a tablet with which u can do anything go 4 window 8 tab.....because you have the full freedom over the device...but may not delver the performance by apple`s i pad 3....but don't think that windows is low on performance...it will be equipped with high end hardware.... the choice is yours...both have their own merits and DE-merits....choose the one which suits you the best.... i ______________________________________________________________________________________________ </s>
