OK, Bob.
I am prepared to embark on this new level of troubleshooting.
I'll presume that something on the order of 10x magnification would show something I may recognize as abnormal.
I'll further presume that I may end up using the machine w/ 256MB RAM, but will advise if I make any progress...thanks again.
Ron
