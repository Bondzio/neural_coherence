I did find the datasheet and I looked on the internet for Dallas Semiconductor.
I checked their website for this product and it came up with no hits, because it looks like the ds12887a is a replacement for the ds1287a.
I Googled it and got a number of hits.
Since I've never bought anything like this before I'm a little unsure of where to go.
One of the hits was Amazon and there were several different prices.
I'll speak to a person I work with, but if you have a place that you'd recommend I'll check it out.
This seemed so much easier when I thought I'd be changing a 3 volt battery.
