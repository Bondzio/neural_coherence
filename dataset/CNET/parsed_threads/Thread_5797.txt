<s> I'm about ready to take the plunge and buy a Western Digital 120GB hard drive to replace the 30GB drive that my Dimension 4600 came with. </s>
<s> Am I correct in thinking that the WD drive will include a utility to copy everything from the old drive--OS, programs, and data files--onto the new drive? </s>
<s> Or will I have to purchase additional software to do that? </s>

<s> For the bare drive you just download it from the maker's web page. </s>
