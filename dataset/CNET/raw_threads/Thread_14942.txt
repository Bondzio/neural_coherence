I have a 10 gig hd not in the computer, which i would like to get the music off of and clear everything else off of it and put it into a new built computer sometime later. Is there a cable I can purchase to connect the hard drive to a usb port to download the music files into another hard drive, and wipe the hard drive clean for use in another machine. thanks for any help.
