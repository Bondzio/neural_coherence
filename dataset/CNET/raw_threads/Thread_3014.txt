But, I've read other posts on this site that have implied because of the lower cache an AMD Athlon 64 processor located on a socket 754 motherboard can not support 64 bit extensions. So I was just hoping that someone could clear things up for me.

Heavens, they are still making motherboards with 754 socket with the fairly new PCI-Express support: Some Socket 754 motherboards with PCIe: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=113370&messageID=1288902&tag=
