i have exactly the same problem, and i'm using exactly the same configuration (xps 8000 running w7 64 bit, 8gb, trying to use a lacie d2 quadra 1.5tb external drive).
after several tries, i actually got the computer to recognize the drive once somehow after a reboot--it was there, and i was able to format it and access it.
after the next reboot it was gone and i haven't seen it since.
haven't even tried connecting by usb yet--i'm not keen on accomodating a brand new system that doesn't work properly.
was hoping to avoid a motherboard swap but i see here and on a thread on dell's support site (  ) that this seems to be the main fix.
come on, dell.
