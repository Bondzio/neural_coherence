here are my observations: 1) those prices are kinda on the high side.
that processor is available online for $225.
$40 isn't the end of the world, but when you're on a budget all students are on a budget; lol), every dollar matters.
2) why 3gb of ram?
by getting 3x1gb sticks, you won't be able to have dual-channel.
i'd stick with 2x1gb for now, and then, when windows vista comes out, maybe upgrade to 4gb.
3) 7600gts are available for as little as $110 online, on sites such as newegg.com.
4) get a different brand of hard drive, as hitachis aren't known for being reliable.
another name for the deskstar is the deathstar.
5) for the case, i'd get anything made by lian-li or antec.
6) for the power supply, i'd get an antec truepower 430 watt.
if you're not up to building a computer, you should look at monarch computer , as you can choose every individual component (down to the ram and power supply), and they'll build it for you and ship it to you.
