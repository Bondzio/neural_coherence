My 120 GB WD was working normally, i format it from a while and accidentally deleted all manufacture drivers/folders that comes originally with it. After that i continued to work properly for a couple of weeks and now suddenly i can see it anymore! I connect it to my laptop or desktop - i tried different USBs and machine and different operating systems (xp & vista) but no result. It shows in the tray bar that i have an external connected, it shows in the device manager inside the &quot;disk drives&quot; a &quot;WD&quot; icon but with no specifications so i can't see it in my computer neither in computer management---&gt;disk management !! So please tell me what i can do?what is the solution?now i don't mind to loose my data on it but i want it to work again. I hope to receive a helpful answer from you and thanks in advance. If u need to know anything else i am ready.

The drive I'd start with buying a new case and mount the existing drive in it. Then see if it works. Could very well be. If it doesn't, buy a new drive also. That probably leaves you with one broken disc and one spare case for future use. Kees

By the way i know about the externals but thx anyway for the explanation. I hope that there is some solutions out there.
