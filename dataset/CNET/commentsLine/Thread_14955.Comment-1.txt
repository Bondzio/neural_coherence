we have a wireless network in our home.
all of our laptops (one hp,one compaq & one mac g4 access the network with no problems and the internet works well.
we bought a lexmark wireless printer and both of the windows machines found it with no problem and it prints very well.
the g4 has found it and it will print a flawless test page,(so i assume that wireless communication is happening)however it will not print from any applications.
ie: word for mac.
always says there is a problem with the printer...anybody have a clue?
