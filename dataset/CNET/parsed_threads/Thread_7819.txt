<s> Hello, I recently purchased a wireless security camera system. </s>
<s> It comes with it's own hub that captures the video and outputs it through A/V ports. </s>
<s> I want to plug the A/V chords into my laptop so that I can record the video. </s>
<s> A few questions I have is: 1. </s>
<s> Do A/V to USB adapters exist that would make sense in this situation? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do A/V to Firewire adapaters exist? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> What kind of software would I be looking at for recording this on a PC? </s>
<s> Mac? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Are there any other setups I should consider? </s>
<s> For example, can I simply caputre the video from a PC off the network? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> That's called &quot;Video Capture.&quot; TOO MANY TO LIST HERE. </s>
<s> I'm surprised you were not flooded with options when you went shopping. </s>
<s> As to the network, such would a documented feature along with how or else it can't. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> does &quot;video capture&quot; refer to capturing on the network? </s>
<s> or capturing from a device? </s>
<s> i have found plenty of freeware that can handle video from a device, but nothing that can capture it off the network. </s>
<s> do you have any examples of these? </s>
<s> thanks heaps! </s>
<s> Let's say I have some video capture device and it is set up to save one or so many hours in a file, then another and so on. </s>
<s> Said file is then &quot;shared&quot; on a network or off the network (your choice.) </s>
<s> Seems like you can do this? </s>
<s> Again, there are hundreds of video capture cards and even more software. </s>
<s> It's like trying to find a dollar hamburger in L.A. Bob </s>
<s> bob. </s>
<s> i'm on the rgiht track now. </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
