<s> Hey guys, So i recently aquired a new Mobo, CPU, and some RAM. </s>
<s> So basically a whole new setup. </s>
<s> I installed all these new parts with my old Video Card and harddrive and booted up. </s>
<s> First problem i ran into was with the OS. </s>
<s> ( Running old Windows Xp) So i used the repair and after a while got everything running. </s>
<s> Did windows update for everything it would give me. </s>
<s> But my sound is not playing at all. </s>
<s> No sound from anything. </s>
<s> I went on the MoBo site and tried to get the audio driver but whenever i install it and restart it doesnt show up in Device Managers. </s>
<s> *** Think this is the step i need to do, and not 100% on if i did it right I did update my video card drivers fromt the website as well and the only yellow exclamation marks i have left in Device Managers is unknown devices in the other category. </s>
<s> ( 3 of them.) </s>
<s> Specs. </s>
<s> Asus P8P57 Deluxe - Mobo Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 - CPU ATI Radeon HD 4600 Series - Graphics Card 4gbs Ram </s>
<s> It's the yellow exclamation marks. </s>
<s> These are devices Windows does not recognize and have drivers for. </s>
<s> They are likely on your new motherboard and the old copy of XP cannot fix that for you. </s>
<s> The motherboard should have come with a driver disk. </s>
<s> You need to run that and install the drivers beginning with the chipset drivers. </s>
<s> After that, you can try the sound card and other devices until all the yellow goes away. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> EXAMPLE (!!!) </s>
<s> at http://www.fastfs.com/help_pages/hp%20downgrade.htm Notice how hard it is to install Sound on XP? </s>
<s> I find this to be true for most of today's hardware. </s>
