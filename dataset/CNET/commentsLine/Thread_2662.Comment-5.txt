hi bob, well, i tried the online virus/worm scan, and my system came up clean.
i also ran chkdsk a few more times, and although it runs and supposedly fixes the errors (although there's no indication from chkdsk that the errors were indeed repaired), the errors remain to varying degrees--each time i check for errors using norton utilities, the &quot;deleting index entry&quot; line changes.
i even went so far as to install spybot search & destroy, thinking it might be spyware or adware screwing things up, and that didn't work either.
&lt;sigh&gt;.
i guess i'll live with it for now.
i appreciate your suggestions, though, and i would welcome any others you might have thanks again!
scott
