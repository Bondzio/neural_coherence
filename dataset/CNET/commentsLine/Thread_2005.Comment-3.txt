try why he suggested (400w is plenty of juice though).
does it still do it *only* on those maps (even after the sp1 install), or have you tried other maps since the &quot;upgrade&quot;?
if that is the case (only those maps) you may want to contact the developer to see if there is any compatability issues with your hardware.
does your system restart ever (like you described) other than in those games (at logon, net browsing, etc.)?
if it does, or every has, you probably have a power problem.
you can never have to large of a power supply (and no, if you install a monster 600w power supply, your computer will not use more electricity than if it had a 300w supply, unless your hardware actually needs it).
with today's superfast (read power hungry) parts and 2ghz+ processors, you really do need signifcantly more power than was necessary yester-year.
the athlons especially, need more power.
you'd be fine with 400w.
