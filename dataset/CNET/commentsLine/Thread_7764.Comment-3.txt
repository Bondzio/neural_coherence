since you lack details on your system, the advice will be generic.
many systems on startup will kick-in the fan to a high speed then settle down.
if you had a system for awhile, it cooling fins or fan maybe lacking a good cleaning, do it asap.
if this is a laptop, the same applies.
use a can of compressed air or direct brush cleaning for best results.
if the problem persists after a cleaning, then replace fan as likely cause of noise.
those systems build as extreme of oc'ed will need better cooling if only &quot;stock cooled&quot; to better cool the heat build-up.
if cleaning all areas should be addressed.
