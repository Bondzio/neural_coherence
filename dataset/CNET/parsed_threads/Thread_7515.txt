<s> Hello everyone Im currently with xplornet 4g internet and am having issues configuring my Belkin n300 wireless N router. </s>
<s> Basically what I am scratching my head at is this. </s>
<s> My router is telling me it is not connected and has a solid orange light, but my wired internet from the belkin router is working fine. </s>
<s> Wireless works fine coming from the belkin router as well but tends to drop at least once a day on all my wireless devices (tablet, galaxy s2 phone, PS3 etc), usually only for a few seconds. </s>
<s> I am just wondering what could possibly cause these problems, if they are connected and how to fix them. </s>
<s> I was having this issue with a sparkly new router. </s>
<s> After a month of putting it off I dove into it and tried the usual then turned to the web. </s>
<s> I lucked out that others were having troubles and the maker's web site was only reporting there were reports of the issue. </s>
<s> The other discussions found folk that found the prior firmware version to not have this issue so I rolled back one version and it's much better. </s>
<s> I suggest you do the same research. </s>
