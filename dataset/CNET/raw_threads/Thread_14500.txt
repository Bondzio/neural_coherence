I never had to mess with the router settings until I recently found out that I couldn't port forward any more. When I try port forwarding on the router website(10.0.0.1), I get an error message that states&quot;Server IP Address isn't in LAN IP address subnet!&quot; What I enter: Common Services: Other Other Service: Minecraft Server Type:TCP/UDP Server IP Address: 192 168 1 13 (My IPv4 address) Starting Port: 25565 Ending Port: 25565 Any help would be appreciated! Thanks
