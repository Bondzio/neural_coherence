My understanding is that at least some of the pc's hp is selling with that board have a very meager powersupply (only 250 watts) I don't know if I would trust a 3700+ on such a system (I don't know how hp gets even the 3400+ to work with it unless they are using a custom, mobile or crippled processor)without upgrading the psu as well and while you are at it replace the graphics card and this and that... You would be better off getting a complete new 939 system before making such an upgrade.
