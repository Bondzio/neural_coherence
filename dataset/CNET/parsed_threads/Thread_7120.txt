<s> I'm getting ready to build a system for myself. </s>
<s> Here's the specs: Asus AM2 Mobo nforce 570SLI chipset eVGA GeForce 7900GT (non-OC'd) Kingwin 600W PSU AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ (might overclock eventually) WD Caviar 250GB Hard drive Here's my debate: I'm going to buy DDR2 667 or better RAM. </s>
<s> Right now, I'm looking at Corsair RAM, 2GB, Latency 4, 4-4-4-12 timings. </s>
<s> However, for a little bit more, I could get mushkin Extreme, 2GB, Latency 3, 3-3-3-10 RAM. </s>
<s> I know quite a bit about computers, but RAM would have to be my most lacking area. </s>
<s> I know the mushkin ram has better timings and latency, but I've also heard a few bad things about mushkin, albeit not much. </s>
<s> I need opinions: who's better? </s>
<s> Muskin or Corsair? </s>
<s> I know a few of my fellow tech heads will help me out on this one. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> These are both DDR2 667 RAM sets. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/04/01/ram_wars/ covers a lot of ground and benchmarks so you can test which one wins. </s>
<s> However I've found such testing to turn up less than 1% speed payback so I've ceased overtesting this area in favor of price per GB and stability. </s>

<s> Personally I'd go with Corsair. </s>
<s> I've never had any problems with any Corsair RAM. </s>
<s> I didn't even think about looking for RAM reviews online. </s>
<s> Appreciate the help. </s>
