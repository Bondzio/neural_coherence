Count the beeps and any sequence it may be presenting, like long-short beeps, etc. Then check Dell for any clues to what the bios beep code could be telling you. With power-OFF a quick fix, is to reseat the ram or swap them around. Make sure they're fully seated and use static care when handling. Then try rebooting again. tada -----Willy
