<s> I have no intention of building one so I'm looking for a pc I can order and have shipped. </s>
<s> My two main questions are (1) Intel P4 vs Athalon chip (whats the real deal with the 32 vs. 64 bit operating systems. </s>
<s> Will it really matter over the next two years). </s>
<s> (2) What kind of video card do I need. </s>
<s> I was told AGP is way faster/better than pci but I've been looking at one that has a PCI-E card which the local 17 yr old salesjock at compusa says is the next generation video card and is better that AGP cards. </s>
<s> Can I get a system my son will be able to use for a couple of years for $1800 (w/o monitor)and if so any suggestions. </s>
<s> Dell is easy to order from but should i be looking elsewhere? </s>
<s> Any advice is welcome. </s>
<s> Its a very complicated process these days! </s>
<s> I suggest you get your hands on this magazine; PC Gamer. </s>
<s> Inside will be systems offered which in most cases are tailored for gaming usage. </s>
<s> These are more likely to fall into a happy medium for you. </s>
<s> You can then checkout the websites of interested systems and proceed from there with specs and so on, but be sure to read the warranty issues as gaming systems tend to push the envelope. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Oh yeah, PCGamer has a website too; http://www.pcgamer.com ciao -----Willy </s>
