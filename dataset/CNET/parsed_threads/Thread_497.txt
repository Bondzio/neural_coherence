<s> Hey ppl, I need help setting up a network printer between my desktop which is running windows xp and my laptop which is running windows vista. </s>
<s> Do I to download a printer driver on my laptop or is there an easy way in the settings somewhere. </s>
<s> Please ppl, help me out and also the printer I want to put on a network is an older one (so it's not a USB printer, its that older bigger, clunkier kind of ports into the desktop PC). </s>
<s> Please help, ppl. </s>
<s> You said you wanted to network a printer. </s>
<s> By this do you mean share it on a network or have it on the network via a print server. </s>
<s> Sharing requires the host device to be on all the time for printing to happen. </s>
<s> A printer on a print server is available to any PC with a driver for it and the TCP/IP port created. </s>
<s> Hi, thanks for replying. </s>
<s> I am not very technical with this but basically i want to be able to connect my laptop to the main desktop's printer but i don't want to connect my printer through the internet if that is what you mean by being connected all the time. </s>
<s> I know my response is very vague, but you can either ask me further to clarify what exactly i want or if it's not much trouble, you can just post the solutions and instructions for going about setting up the network printer with a heading for each network printer solution (step by step and numbered steps). </s>
<s> Thanks again for replying. </s>
<s> First, you have to network the two PCs. </s>
<s> This will require some hardware. </s>
<s> The best way would be through a hub or switch using Ethernet cable. </s>
<s> What we don't know yet is what sort of networking hardware you already have. </s>
<s> Do you have a broadband internet service? </s>
<s> If so, are you using a router? </s>
<s> If you have a router, that's a big help as you're two PCs will need IP addresses to communicate. </s>
<s> If you don't have broadband internet and just want the two PCs networked, you do that with a single &quot;crossover&quot; type Ethernet cable and set your IP addresses manually. </s>
<s> In any event, you need to get them networked first and make sure &quot;printer and file sharing&quot; is turned on. </s>
<s> Next, you decide which PC will have the printer attached. </s>
<s> You will install the printer driver, attach the printer and test it. </s>
<s> You will need to share that printer. </s>
<s> If you do a right click on the printer icon that been created, you should see an option to share it. </s>
<s> Select that option and an up-raised palm should appear under it. </s>
<s> Now, when you browse the network from the other PC, it will look for shares. </s>
<s> The printer should be one of them. </s>
<s> A right click on the shared printer should bring up an option to install it. </s>
<s> Sometimes this doesn't work. </s>
<s> Another way would be to use the &quot;add printer&quot; option which will allow you to browse to the same printer across the network and install from there. </s>
<s> It's probable you'll need a different printer driver for this PC than the other because the operating systems are not the same. </s>
<s> You'll need to have that driver handy. </s>
<s> Admittedly it's been a while since I've done printer sharing set-up and it's not always possible to know what to expect when two different OSs are involved. </s>
<s> But, that's basically how you'd do printer sharing. </s>
<s> First network the PCs, install the printer one one and share it and then make the connection from the other PC. </s>
