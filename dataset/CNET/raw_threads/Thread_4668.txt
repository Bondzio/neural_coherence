Will it eventual just stop and screw my pc up? Should I go ahead and get a new power supply? I haven't had any over heating or crashing issues with it. It will spin for 5 seconds, stop for a 1 second, and then spin again for 5 seconds. power suppy is 650 or 600 watts Could a connection just be loose? I have never opened up my power suppy, but I built this pc. specs below: System Information report written at: 09/10/10 21:02:30 System Name: PENCEWD-PC [System Summary] Item
