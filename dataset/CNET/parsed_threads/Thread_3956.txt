<s> Hi, Sorry if this is posted in the wrong section, so please move it if it is. </s>
<s> I need to find for my study project a graphics card expert who's willing to help me. </s>
<s> The person needs to answer 15 questions (that i made) about the history of the graphics card. </s>
<s> Thanks Chris </s>
<s> My experience dates back to pre-PC days with circuit designs from about 1972. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi, Think it does Class starts again on monday so i'll have to ask then. </s>
<s> It hasn't been easy finding one :s Thanks </s>
<s> Good grief BOB! </s>
<s> You are dating yourself!! </s>
<s> I thought I was the only Dinosaur around **LOL** I go back to roughly the same era and perhaps beyond, PRE SOLID state, tape drives, etc. </s>
<s> Happy new year! </s>
<s> Was in use back then and in the class I took we learned how to inspect it and even repair the memory arrays. </s>
<s> Graphics back then was pretty crude. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> that required a heater and temperature control to keep their crystal oscillators stable, Hollerith punch cards and ascii punch tape, keyboards that somehow coded with visible light. </s>
<s> You'll remember words like &quot;and, nand, or and nor&quot; and maybe even &quot;Schmidt trigger&quot;...but video...what video...there wasn't anything that resembled video other than the Lissajous pattern on one's O-scope doing hard drive head alignments. </s>
<s> Ah yes, haven't heard that terminology for years! </s>
<s> Sort of a walk down memory lane, glad to see that SOMEONE still remembers! </s>
<s> HAPPY NEW YEAR STEVE! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> One of the labs was to build the tic tac toe game with relays. </s>
<s> LEDs were new and expensive so incandescent bulbs and LEAD based solder. </s>
<s> Graphics of the day was with pens that were pushed around the paper! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Some of the communication stuff I worked on in the military and later used this type of memory. </s>
<s> I was once told that they were hand &quot;sewn&quot; by Asian women because they were the only people with the eyesight and steady hand to do this work. </s>
<s> Vaguely I remember something about having read, write, and re-write functions. </s>
<s> The beads required two lines to make them change state...X and Y. </s>
<s> Either didn't provide enough current to switch them so this happened only at the intersection where both passed through a bead. </s>
<s> To read from memory, an attempt was made to switch each bead back using the same method. </s>
<s> If it switched, a small current was felt in the read line. </s>
<s> This, effectively, cleared that bead and the controller would need to write it back again....or at least that's the explanation I remember. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that 8 or 16 k occupied nearly 1 square foot of space on a PCB. </s>
<s> I never saw one of these fail. </s>
<s> Yes Bob and the calculators had handles on them and a word processor was a Royal or a Remmington, Happy New Year, Phil </s>
<s> My first was an Underwood. </s>
<s> We nicknamed it the &quot;Blunderwood&quot;. </s>
<s> but the purest would prefer one of these http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=blickensderfer&sa=N&start=0&ndsp=18 </s>
<s> Blade maker and gun maker? </s>
<s> Seems the right stuff for zombie movies. </s>
<s> We had no graphics to speak of. </s>
<s> All i/f was through the teletype panel. </s>
<s> Though, some could say the punch cards were also an i/f. </s>
<s> Let's see, input a problem and walk away or await a call to say the work was done. </s>
<s> Also, computers were noisy back then up to a point. </s>
<s> Those printers back then, really pounded away. </s>
<s> Heck, I had to learn &quot;tube theory&quot; and read all those darn logic schematics. </s>
