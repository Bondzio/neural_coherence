I just got a cable modem installed so I then bought a wireless router and 2 wireless ethernet cards for 2 98se machines. All was good. All 3 machines are online. I ran the home network wizard on the XP machine and created the network disk for the 2 98se machines. After running the set-up disk on the 98se machines I am at the following point: the 2 98se machines can see each other and access the shared documents folder. The XP machine can see the 2 98se machines and access the shared documents folder. When either of the 98se machines tries to access the XP machine so they can print, I am prompted for a password to access the XP shared documents folder. What do I do? How am I to know what the password is. I was never prompted to create a password. Thanks for any help
