while the epson c120 printer is cheap to purchase, the replacement cartridges are sad.
black epson 68 has about 7.5ml in it, while suggested retail is 39.99 for a double pack.
meaning 2.86 dollars per ml, the color epson 69 each have 5ml in them with a suggested cost of 2.47 dollars per ml.
now these prices are from epson directly.
page yields are roughly 370 pages for the 68 black (single) and 350 pages for the 69 colors.
however, i know from a person who uses this printer constantly that she is getting replacements about every 2-3 weeks.
and she does not use the printer as much as a card/invitation business would.
