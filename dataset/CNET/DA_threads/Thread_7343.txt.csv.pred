1.1.1	I've been a console gamer for about 12 years, and this summer I've decided to build a gaming rig to suit my computer and gaming needs.	St
1.1.2	As far as accessories, I was just wondering if getting a programmable gaming controller would be better for shooting games or just using an affordable gaming mouse and keyboard (Saitek Cyborg & RAT 7 for example)?	St
1.2.1	I used to pc game and I found almost every year I had to shell out another $200 + to keep the video card performance up.	St
1.2.2	On top of that I like to play fair for fun and it just ruins the fun when anyone ( with lil effort ) can either but parts that give advantages to them and/or modify pc files to flat out cheat !	St
1.2.3	Another thing I hate about pc gaming is when i want to play and instead of playing im remote connecting to other players to get their divers working or the headsets going , network issues blah blah etc with computers and so many unique configs i was getting tired of it and i just wanted to play Alas, along came the ps3 with hd graphics, so simple, put the disk in and turn on your headset on and away you gooooo.	St
1.2.4	the graphics before were way better on the computer but now that's evened out quite a bit and with $$ I save I can buy a ps3 every year.	St
1.2.5	Ps we have the xbox also and they can be modified to cheat too, but the ps3 is still better locked up !	St
1.2.6	Sorry for the rant but I'll never go back to pc gaming bc it's too open , not as many players and too much money and configuration.	St
