the enclosure i have is the nexstar 3 model number nst-360u2-bk.
i did try to contact vantech tech support (only could find an email address for tech help) and of course they never responded...big shock...i don't know why these companies even have email for tech help or whatever...they never respond...worthless.
anyway, like i said many times, i can't try smaller partitions or anything like that because when i go into disk management it only shows up as 32gb of unformatted space and if i try to format the drive it won't let me enter a number higher than 32gb.
