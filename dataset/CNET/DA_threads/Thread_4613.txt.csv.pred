1.1.1	in trying to find out what kind of MOBO I have I ran across AIDA32 , while going though everything that this program brought up it said that i have an AGP slot thats not in use .	St
1.1.2	My question is , when i opened the case and looked i saw an area labeled AGP1 and there is nothing there , is it possible to ADD and AGP slot ?	Ques
1.1.3	if so how hard would it be ?	Ques
1.1.4	Any help would be great full .	Polite
1.1.5	Thank you	St
1.2.1	Use CPU-Z ( http : //www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php ) to confirm the manufacturer and model number of the motherboard .	St
1.2.2	Post the results here .	St
1.2.3	I will note that some motherboard models used by big name computer makers will specify that there is a particular slot or other ports , but they end up missing or as dummy ports that never were wired .	St
1.2.4	How hard would it be ?	Ques
1.2.5	Entirely too difficult and expensive .	St
1.2.6	The solution is to get a new motherboard with the slot you want or just purchase a new computer .	St
1.2.7	Maybe a PCI ( not PCI Express ) video card will suffice ?	Ques
