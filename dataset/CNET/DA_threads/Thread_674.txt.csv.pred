1.1.1	I use to have a cannon ink jet an i could always refill the ink for less than $ 8 , instead of buying a brand new cartridge .	St
1.1.2	That printer finally died .	St
1.1.3	I now have a lexmark ink jet , and the cartridges are chipped , this means it tracks the amount of ink and will stop working if you refill it .	St
1.1.4	Since ink cartridges are at least $ 30 and do not last long , what brand of printer should i buy that is kinda cheap & gt ; $ 40 ?	Ques
1.2.1	Epson now has printers out ( the & quot ; C & quot ; series & quot ; ) that have chipped ink cartridges .	St
1.2.2	However , there are & quot ; Ink Refill & quot ; web sites that sell a chip that goes on the refillable cartridges that & quot ; trick & quot ; the printer in to thinking there is always a new or full ink Cartridge .	St
1.2.3	Check it out .	St
1.2.4	Pretty nifty .	St
1.2.5	I think www.inkjetsaver.com or www.universalinkjet.com are just two of those sites .	St
1.2.6	I have four Epsons and it is great to be able to refill them .	St
1.2.7	Plus , I have two Lexmarks ( Z23 and Z611 ) .	St
1.2.8	I just snap the tops off , refill and tape the tops down .	St
1.2.9	Refill kits show how - can buy them at WalMart..	St
1.3.1	First off , the chip in an ink cartridge , called a & quot ; smart chip & quot ; , is something that printer manufacturers can put into their ink cartridges to supposedly tell you when your printer is going to run out of ink .	St
1.3.2	Something that 's not as well known is that it also holds a unique coding with an I.D .	St
1.3.3	and brand name signature in it .	St
1.3.4	The printer will then only recognize the manufacturer 's smart chip or a smart chip made to mimic the chip that the manufacturer has made .	St
1.3.5	Sometimes these manufacturers set an expiration date on these cartridges chips that disable them even if they 're still full of ink .	St
1.3.6	Personally , I think that the only reason they have this chip is so that people have to buy extremely overpriced original manufactured cartridges , and to eliminate the third party choice of cartridge refills , and buying in-expensive re-manufactured cartridges .	St
1.3.7	Basically they 're taking out the competition .	St
1.3.8	The smart chip also makes people think that using third party ink will damage your printer .	St
1.3.9	A warning box that pops up after the installation of a re-manufactured ink or toner cartridge that tells you the ink will damage your printer .	St
1.3.10	( 9 % of the time , it does n't .	St
1.3.11	Lawsuits have been filed , claiming that the chip delivered a false message that asked people to replace the cartridge even though it was still full , I 've also heard of one that claimed that the chip itself broke their printer .	St
1.3.12	In conclusion I 've found that you can fight this technology by buying a chip re-setter for the cartridge when it needs to be re-filled or if it 's getting close to that expiration date , or you can buy compatible cartridges that have a new re-placement chip installed .	St
1.3.13	As to what brand of printer you should buy for yourself , personally I 'm not into any specific brand of printer .	Ques
1.3.14	I know to stay away from Epson 's they tend to have a lot of problems .	St
1.3.15	I think a better question to ask is , & quot ; What Printer Should I Buy ?	Ques
1.3.16	& quot ; Depending on if your printing large amounts of text , or quality pictures , or a little of both .	St
1.3.17	Knowing what you print before you purchase your new printer can save you a lot of money .	St
1.3.18	So in conclusion I would recommend reading the article hyper linked in this paragraph before the purchase of your next printer .	Sug
1.3.19	It could potentially help you save money .	St
1.3.20	I hope this information was useful thanks for taking the time to read my long answer .	St
