Any cpu speed rating that's not OC'ed is stable, once OC'ed you're pushing it.
If you're buying a cpu to OC, then you assume all risk.
Multiple core cpus tend to work well and they needn't be speed demons even if they can be OC'ed.
As for your ?, buy what you feel suits you.
I exclude OC needs.
I suggest any cpu you get should be easily supported by your mtrbd.
As for the mtrbd., if OC'ing in mind that it is also OC friendly.
