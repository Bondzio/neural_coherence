<s> I'm running Win XP with SP 1. </s>
<s> A couple weeks ago, my DVD-ROM and CD-RW drives stopped working. </s>
<s> They weren't visible in &quot;My Computer,&quot; and the CD-RW drive wouldn't even open when I pressed the eject button, so I restarted. </s>
<s> They were not found by the BIOS at boot-up. </s>
<s> I figured it was a bad IDE cable, so I pilfered one from another computer and installed it. </s>
<s> Presto, they worked again. </s>
<s> Today, the same thing has happened. </s>
<s> I don't think the chances of having two IDE cables go bad in the span of a couple weeks is very likely. </s>
<s> The DVD drive is set to be the master on IDE channel 2, and the CD-RW as the slave on the same channel. </s>
<s> The DVD drive will open if I push the eject button, so it doesn't seem like an issue with my power supply. </s>
<s> The DVD drive is an 8x drive from Creative, the CD-RW is a CD-Writer Plus 9100 from HP. </s>
<s> Neither has any firmware updates on their respective websites. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> Test each unit ALONE and ONE AT A TIME. </s>
<s> Does it work then? </s>

<s> Testing them seperately, they both worked fine. </s>
<s> So, I returned to the original configuration (DVD as master, CD-RW as slave on channel 2), and they even worked while they were together again. </s>
<s> So far, the problem seems to be solved by opening the case, removing the IDE cable, and reconnecting it. </s>
<s> Could it be a problem with one of the pins on the DVD drive? </s>
<s> I don't really want to have to open my case every week just so my drives will work. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for a next step? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> If this was my machine I'd watch for signs that a drive was on the verge of failure. </s>
<s> The BIOS boot screen could read &)(*()(DVD)*)(*( instead of LD DVDROM MASTER. </s>
<s> These clues lead us to what to do next. </s>
<s> Also, I know to see if the FIRMWARE is current and I also will fit 80 conductor cables, set the jumpers to CS since that's my most trouble free setups. </s>
<s> Sadly, the drive or part with the issue didn't reveal itself (yet). </s>

<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I'll try CS and keep an eye on things for now. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help. </s>
