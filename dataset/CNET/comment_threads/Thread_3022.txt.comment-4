The i810 may not have a disable.
And if you read the HP Forums you find you've selected a problematic combo.
But let us try anyway.
Since we don't disable the i810 video, we just set the AGP or PCI to be the primary display and then connect the display to the card/connection we want.
Then we install the ATI drivers.
NO!
We don't uninstall the i810 video drivers.
