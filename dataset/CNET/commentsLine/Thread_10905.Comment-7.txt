zonealarm is a pretty good firewall, but after trying sygate personal firewall, i switched.
i just like the interface better.
as for anti-spyware, ad-aware se and spybot s&d are both excellent programs.
if you really want to get &quot;down and dirty&quot; into the system and see what's going on, try hijackthis.
it's not for the faint of heart, though.
it's a pretty powerful program.
if you don't know what you're doing with it, don't guess... ask!
there are lots of people out here that are willing to help.
