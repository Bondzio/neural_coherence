<s> This is a small issue... COMPUTER: I have a Dell Dimension 8400 (P4 3.0GHz, 2.5GB RAM, 80GB SATA drive). </s>
<s> Original power supply is 350 watts. </s>
<s> MY MODIFICATIONS: * Added a Linksys Ethernet NIC, on-board connection died * PCI card with 4 USB 2.0 ports * Combo Firewire (2 ports)/USB 2.0 (4 ports) PCI expansion card (bought but haven't installed, so count it) * 2GB of DDR2 SDRAM, 533 MHz, on top of my original 512MB Other than that I am running everything on external power, e.g. </s>
<s> external HDD, flash drives which are bus-powered. </s>
<s> Between MS Office documents, music collection, and pictures, I have finally gotten to 2/3 full on my original HDD and want to add on another SATA drive in the 160-250GB range. </s>
<s> MY QUESTION... Do I need a new power supply? </s>
<s> If so, what do you recommend? </s>
<s> Is there some formula I could use to calculate my needs? </s>
<s> It is a Dell so I also have concerns about proprietary equipment dimensions, cabling, etc. </s>
<s> Also, does anyone have any successes with any hard drive makers? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/choosing-a-power-supply.htm HD... their all good, untill they die and you have no &quot;backup&quot; </s>
<s> The Dell psus are darn good, though many think they're not. </s>
<s> The point is they do deliver the juice until it fails like any other psu. </s>
<s> I suggest you calculate your actual power demands and add on top of that at least 50% or simply double it. </s>
<s> Because you have a Dell, you do need to be sure it is compatible to physically as well deliver the added wattage in its space. </s>
<s> You can check at: http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and follow their lead on suggestions. </s>
<s> If price affects you then find what they offer in wattage and then look for another *namebrand* psu of similar rating. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> just leave your original power supply alone. </s>
<s> it's more than adequate for your usage. </s>
<s> as for hard drives, any name brand will do: western digital, seagate, hitachi. </s>
<s> i'd only get a maxtor (since they're a subsidiary of seagate now) if it was cheaper than the other brands i mentioned. </s>
<s> Sorry for the delay - thanks to all the advice. </s>
<s> I kept the current PS, might swap out hard drives but everything seems to be working fine. </s>
<s> good thing u kept the old psu b/c dell has there psus specially made for there mobos so even if u did try and get anotehr one it wouldnt work believe me thats how my old pc was lol </s>
