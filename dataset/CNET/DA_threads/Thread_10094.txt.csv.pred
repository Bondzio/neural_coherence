1.1.1	im looking for advice on the nas220 by seagate before purchasing .	St
1.1.2	I am looking to know how this device handles streaming movies and music to xbox units and if it can do this without any issues when acting as a media server ?	Ques
1.1.3	any advice and support is welcome especially if any members have this nas drjve and use it in the same manor as i intend to .	Ques
1.2.1	Sorry , it failed .	St
1.2.2	All NAS devices have issues .	St
1.2.3	If not the device itself then the owner 's network and the players of the content .	St
1.2.4	There is no known issue free solution today .	St
1.2.5	I wish you had not made this question such an easy one .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	ok. is there any media servers that are up to the job ?	Ques
1.3.2	shame about the nas drives	St
1.4.1	Again , none .	St
1.4.2	Why ?	Ques
1.4.3	Because I am seeing folk get content from , let 's say , the internet and the encoding is all over the map these media servers only support a small percentage of possible encoding so there will be issues .	St
1.4.4	Can you share why you made this such an easy question ?	Ques
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	so in short we are being mislead with false advertising such as these devices being able to perform when infact they dont !	St
1.5.2	all i am looking for is a sound device that allows me to share media files to other connected devices on my network , seems like i am fighting a loosing battle .	St
1.5.3	The questions are so easy if you already know the answers ?	Ques
1.5.4	if you never ask then how do we learn ?	Ques
1.5.5	a fundemental learning curve !	St
1.5.6	can you offer any solutions to my issue ?	Ques
1.5.7	would like to have this capacity on my network but now realise nas drives are not the answer .	St
1.5.8	I am currently using a netgear DGND3700 router but the ready share feature i am not to convinced with either ie ; supporting a 2 TB external Hard drive ?	Ques
1.6.1	Sorry that I made it sound easy .	St
1.6.2	You asked GREAT QUESTIONS and were SPOT ON when you declared that the marketing made it sound like it all works .	St
1.6.3	The DGND3700 is not a bad choice but as we ( not you , but somewhere on this forum ) discovered is n't perfect .	St
1.6.4	One CNET member was having issues with the NAS feature and their Xbox 360 .	St
1.6.5	We did some searching and discovered we had to FIDDLE with a setting .	St
1.6.6	This means that even this failed the & quot ; without issue & quot ; test .	St
1.6.7	As to the 2TB drive size , Netgear should answer that .	St
1.6.8	My take is that most folk are put off by the mess of encoding and the rather sluggish file transfers .	St
1.6.9	That is , they are used to much faster transfers .	St
1.6.10	For example if you can wait half a hour for that video to copy up to the NAS then you 'll be OK on that aspect .	St
1.6.11	Then we have the encoding of the content to cover .	St
1.6.12	The player , if a PC is pretty capable but today I find folk trying to play it on some HDTV and then the truth is revealed .	St
1.6.13	Or the owner learns about video encoding , transcoding and lip sync .	St
1.6.14	Bob	St
1.7.1	For the HDTV player it 's a Logitech Revue .	St
1.7.2	For the NAS , it 's some netbook ( low power , capable and cheap . )	St
1.7.3	For the other content I usually plug it right into the Revue .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	happy days , thats what im looking for	St
1.9.1	Even though what I use now has a long history of things that did n't work out ( the old ROKU HD , some HTPC , too many & quot ; media players & quot ; ) I am looking to change this working system some day .	St
1.9.2	I 'm considering the Sony Google TV since it has a BD player .	St
1.9.3	Just want to test it .	St
1.9.4	WHY ?	Ques
1.9.5	1 .	St
1.9.6	The BD player .	St
1.9.7	2 .	St
1.9.8	It 's 1080p versus the Revue 's 720p .	St
1.9.9	The Revue is working well but I wonder if it can be better .	St
1.9.10	The Boxee seems to get good reviews but I have n't tried it yet .	St
1.9.11	And strange I have n't seen one in the stores here .	St
1.9.12	Bob	St
