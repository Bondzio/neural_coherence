hello- i recently put in a new second hard drive because my c disk was full.
( my computer is a sony vaio i bought in 2001, i run windows xp.)
my question is: i cant tell which of the disks in my computer is the new one.
i bought the hard drive at a local computer store and it didnt come with any instructions or docs at all.
it shows disk:c, d, g,and h. the c i know isnt it.
and the d-i think it is a &quot;partition&quot;(not really sure).
(my cd & dvd is e,f) i need to format the new one(i guess) how on earth do i find my new one?
and no, i cant get any help from the place where i bought it-he is not very helpful.
thanks, lizzie
