<s> I have a cheapie homemade PC from a kit from CompUSA, it's an ASUS M2N-SLI MoBo with an AMD Phenom processor. </s>
<s> It runs XP Pro, I use it to run older utility programs that won't run on Win7. </s>
<s> The other day it hung up while browsing, so I had to shut down and restart. </s>
<s> Darn thing wouldn't come back on; no lights, no fans, nothing. </s>
<s> I replaced the ATX power supply, and at least I saw lights and fans, and the hard drive was clearly running, but it still wouldn't boot. </s>
<s> The fan on the processor seemed to run kinda slow, but that may be normal on cool startup. </s>
<s> I also removed all plug-in boards, including memory, to make sure there wasn't something among them that was causing an issue. </s>
<s> No dice. </s>
<s> So it seems my next step would be to either get a new MoBo or a new processor. </s>
<s> But is there any way I can tell which is bad, so it won't be hit-or-miss? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> You need to minimize the system to basics and see if it will run. </s>
<s> Here, if possible try components elsewhere to test them. </s>
<s> There is no easy or magic fix, as sometimes it boils down to just that, testing. </s>
<s> Also, I've found, when tested solo or elsewhere, things work, but once put together again, it fails. </s>
<s> Usually, it boils down to the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and there's really no test for it other than installing all new(test items) and see if it works. </s>
<s> It appears your PSU went out and it *may* have taken something with it. </s>
<s> Since, you have an older system, it maybe better to think new rather than repair, build another system for costs involved maybe more bang for the buck. </s>
