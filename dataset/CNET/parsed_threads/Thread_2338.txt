<s> I recently bought the Netgear WG 511v2 wifi card for my Dell Latitude lap top with Win Xp pro operating system. </s>
<s> Prior to this card I have used belkins and linksys cards with no problems at all. </s>
<s> Ever since I have installed this card I continue to face problems when i try to put the laptop on stand by or shut down nothing happens, I have to hold down the power button for a few seconds to shut off the machine which is of course not the best way to work the computer. </s>
<s> I have tried removing the wifi card restarting the machine and trying to put the laptop on stand by and all of it works just perfect. </s>
<s> I have a feeling its got to do with the new card. </s>
<s> ANy help will be appreciated.. </s>
<s> one offered here: http://kbserver.netgear.com/release_notes/D102738.asp </s>
<s> I returned it for a model I know works. </s>
<s> Driver updates didn't cure it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yes the firmware was the first thing I looked at and it is the most recent version. </s>
<s> Bob thanks for your feedback, I guess I will have to do the same...by the way it's been a while since i logged on here. </s>
<s> it's good to see, you are still around showing directions to us that are lost </s>
