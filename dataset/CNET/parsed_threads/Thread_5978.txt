<s> During startup my computer is giving me an error message: Explored caused an exception OIH in module SHDOCVW.DLL at 0167:77c6901b Any ideas...please help. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> look at the top Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> As the other post says you haven't told us much, you say you get the error but dont say if your system crashes! </s>
<s> Anyway SHDOCVW.DLL is a IExplorer file so it is likely you have spyware as (i assume) a program at startup is trying to load a web page. </s>
<s> Therefore run spyware programs and if that doesn't work stop items in the startup folder of msconfig from loading until you find the culprit. </s>
