<s> I currently have a 19&quot; Trinitron CRT (14&quot; horizontal viewing width). </s>
<s> Due to eye surgery and eyeglass issues I have to get a monitor as low to the desktop as possible to avoid having to look upward too much. </s>
<s> I'm looking at both 17&quot; LCD and 19&quot;LCD. </s>
<s> I understand that the native resolution is 1280 x 1024 for maximum clarity. </s>
<s> Right now I have my CRT at 1024 x 768. </s>
<s> Here are my questions: Assuming that I have to have the maximum clarity, should I make the logical assumtion that the icons, etc. </s>
<s> are going to be smaller than on my 19&quot; CRT. </s>
<s> Would the 19&quot; LCD give me larger icons than the 17&quot;. </s>
<s> This can be a potential problem because the 19&quot; screen size will be taller and I will have another 2&quot; to look up. </s>
<s> How tall is the viewing height on each. </s>
<s> Width can also be an issue here becasue I don't have as good peripheral vision now and want to minimize moving my head from side to side. </s>
<s> Are there any LCDs width a native resolution of 1024 x 768? </s>
<s> Also would a digital video card do anything here. </s>
<s> Thanks, Marc </s>
<s> You can get LCDs that adjust for height. </s>
<s> You might get, if you don't already have one, a pneumatic chair that can rise up a bit. </s>
<s> Yes, LCDs work best in their native resolution and, with 17&quot; and 19&quot; having the same one, the 17 will produce smaller icons. </s>
<s> If you wear glasses which are bi/trifocals, get a pair of single vision lenses optimized for your normal position from head to screen. </s>
<s> XP will let you make the icons larger and stay with the native resolutin so that's not a problem. </s>
<s> There are also some &quot;accessibility&quot; options that you can work with. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> inlarging icons, thevlower the resolution the bigger and easier to read. </s>
<s> the lcds, which can mount on adjustable bracket thats on ur wall would help u hope you heal good konny </s>
<s> Thanks for all the suggestions. </s>
<s> I'd tried some and considered all. </s>
<s> I learned that 15&quot; monitors have a native resolution of 1024 x 768. </s>
<s> That horizontal viewing size is very close to my 19&quot; crt. </s>
<s> Does that mean that the height is the same as my crt which is 11&quot;? </s>
<s> Most importantly, am I correct in thinking that the 1024 x 768 resolution is the same actual icon and text size on both types? </s>
<s> Finally, I see that there are few 15&quot; anymore so I need some reccomendations. </s>
<s> I have a TV tuner card in my computer and often watch TV both in a small box and full screen if this matters. </s>
<s> I can check the manf. </s>
<s> web sites to see if they will take one of those arm mounts on the back although I assume that they all can. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the info. </s>
