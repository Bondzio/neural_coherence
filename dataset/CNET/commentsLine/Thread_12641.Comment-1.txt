help!!
i live in southern il and broadband choices are beyond limited.
so i'm looking for a simple way to take advantage of networking 2 pc's in my home using windows ics.
i've done everything correct as far to setting up both pc's.
however when the machine#1 connects to the internet, machine#2 does not connect at all.
does the verizon's vzaccess manager application is causing my problem?
i really need help with this...as far as networking...i'm consider to be a white belt.
2 - p4 (dell) windows xp home pc 1 - verizon wireless um150 usb modem 1 - vzaccess manager 1 - crossover cable machine 1 ip address - 192.168.0.1 subnet mask - 255.255.255.0 gateway - (blank) machine 2 ip address - 192.168.0.2 subnet mask - 255.255.255.0 gateway - 192.168.0.1
