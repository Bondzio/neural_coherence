Should I change the 100Mhz internal frequency and 7.0x/15x freq multiplier to 200Mhz and 12x ? Or would this blow up the board???? Happy Saturday everyone.

In my BIOS I can enter the internal frequency as 100Mhz and onward up to ?200. I can also change the multiplier in a number of ways. Is the Mhz the only one I should change? Not the multiplier? Grateful for a blow by blow idiot's guide! A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.....

Leave the multiplier alone and simply raise the Front Side Bus in increments of say 5 mhz, ie. 105, 110, etc. until you reach 133. With each incremental raise, note whether the system boots without problem. Stop raising the FSB when you reach 133, you should see the correct reading then.
