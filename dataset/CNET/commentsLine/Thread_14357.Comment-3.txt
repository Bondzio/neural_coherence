but how would i cable it with a router?
as i indicated in my original post, i've tried a router with no luck.i had a techie friend come over to help me and after 2 hours, he stood up, scratched his head and said, &quot;reformat and start over&quot; then he walked out.
i tried a hub as a last resort and it worked, albiet with the above problems.
is there no way to run an adsl modem through a hub and have it work correctly?
