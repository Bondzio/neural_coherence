<s> My computer died about 8 months after I got it and sent it back to Compaq because it was still under warranty. </s>
<s> They said the hard drive had gone bad and replaced it. </s>
<s> When I came back, it was working fine, well, for about 2 months. </s>
<s> I had downloaded VLC Media player and was using it to play music, A had highlighted a few songs and right clicked open with VLC. </s>
<s> VLC opened every song I had in my library at the same time in and each time it opened each song in a new player (expl; for each song it opened a new player to play the song) This froze my computer and I had to hard boot. </s>
<s> After the hard boot I went to blue screen. </s>
<s> After reading some forums, Most of the info said that other people who had this problem had burned out their RAM. </s>
<s> So I changed my RAM. </s>
<s> But While I was changing it out I upgraded it from 512MB X2 to 1GB x2. </s>
<s> I did research on the RAM before I bought it and was told the new RAM was compatible. </s>
<s> After the new RAM was installed, The first thing I noticed was in the Bios It was still detecting 512MB X2. </s>
<s> After that it go to the start-up menu (Start windows in safe mode; safe mode with networking, normally, etc.) </s>
<s> I've tried all the options and it always goes to blue screen. </s>
<s> I downloaded a XP System Restore disk and tried booting from CD, it starts just fine but the goes to &quot;Examining 238473 MB disk 0 at id 0 on bus 0 on nvatabus...&quot; The hard drive is 250GB so that might be right, I'm not sure. </s>
<s> But the BootCD just stops there... </s>
<s> Nothing Else... What's the Problem??? </s>
<s> What do I need to do? </s>
<s> Please educate me... Joel </s>
<s> The ram is not the right ram. </s>
<s> Since we have the results it's an easy diagnosis that you want to go back to your old RAM configuration. </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> Just to clarify... Are saying that I got the wrong RAM? </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure I got the DDR2 DIMM 5300 1GB. </s>
<s> Which said it was backward compatible with the DDR2 DIMM 4200 512MB that my computer came with. </s>
<s> So, my computer needs the 4200 and is not compatible with other RAM? </s>
<s> OR I just happened to get bad RAM and this is one of the errors that can result from bad memory? </s>
<s> Sorry, I can be a little dense if things aren't spelled out for me... </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick reply Joel </s>
<s> Sorry no. </s>
<s> You are telling me it's the wrong ram. </s>
<s> If it was the right ram and you got it plugged in right it would be fine and you would not be telling me this story. </s>
<s> Go back to what works and next time, Crucial.com Bob </s>
<s> Back to the original RAM 512mb ddr2 dimm 4200. it's still NOT working... grrr </s>
