<s> Hey there. </s>
<s> I have a Compaq Presario SR1300AN. </s>
<s> The spec's are: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=us&docname=c00282472&dlc=en&product=446896&printable=yes&encodeUrl=true& I am wondering, is this computer worth being upgraded? </s>
<s> Or should I build a new one? </s>
<s> I am interested in using it for Gaming, browsing, listening to music, windows live messenger. </s>
<s> Should I just buy a whole new PC or just build one. </s>
<s> If so can you help me find a cheap setup? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> When you change the motherboard the OS that came with the Compaq usually fails. </s>
<s> At a few hundred bucks, it can be the deal breaker. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> upgrade to a Proprietary computer such as a Compaq, Dell, HP, etc. </s>
<s> You can reuse some of the components, however the first major problem is the nifty little cases they use. </s>
<s> Simply too small to adequately cool any of the improvements you would want to make. </s>
<s> Start with a new case [under $60]. </s>
<s> Best to buy one sans Power Supply and buy a separate supply that you verify has all the power needed as well as connectors needed for new mobos, videos etc. </s>
<s> Very possible that your Dell doesn't even have a slot for a video card, which right there kills gaming. </s>
<s> The FSB shows as 333 MHz which can't be upgraded without getting a new mobo. </s>
<s> You don't want to get involved finding out if the Dell mobo is wired for a standard ATX V2 supply or pay an arm and a leg for one from them. </s>
<s> Go to newegg and check prices. </s>
<s> Yep you will have to buy a new Op Sys [XP Pro with SP2B, OEM CD from Newegg is $139. </s>
<s> Home is $89]. </s>
<s> About all I plan to salvage from my old Compaq is the case and even that will need some sheet metal work. </s>
<s> Ever time I try and start a build (price it out) I find that buying a new OS (must be real and complete) causes the price to go up to the point I can buy for cheaper then I can build it. </s>
<s> I usally stop and decide to live with what I have. </s>
<s> Try here for more general info http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7586_102-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=223495&messageID=2347588 Look at my reply &quot;Basic things to watch for when buying&quot; </s>
<s> The off the shelf computer you have now has a cheap motherboard and processor,so most other parts will be selected on price rather than quality. </s>
<s> By using a top class motherboard and processor these parts will have a 3 year warranty. </s>
<s> A 400W-500W power supply in a large ATX case for better airflow is needed to run a good video card. </s>
<s> Use either a P4 or Athlon 64 motherboard with the latest socket size. </s>
<s> Gaming computers need to be top of the line with at least 1 gig of Ram and a core 2 duo processor or dual core processor. </s>
<s> You will not be able to build a cheap system if you want to play the latest games. </s>
<s> Brand name computers are built to a price first and foremost,this is why a lot of them give trouble. </s>
<s> The moment you cut corners on price you cut quality. </s>
<s> If cost is a real problem forget using it for serious gaming and put your present system into a larger case with a 400W power supply and install a DVD R/RW so you can burn DVDs and add 2x512 of ram discarding the 256 stick (you may be able to trade it in if is lifetime warranty Ram). </s>
<s> Doing this will be a cheap option that will improve your performance and allow you to play older games. </s>
<s> With the adittion of a $300 video card more modern games can be played. </s>
<s> Have fun colo39 </s>
<s> computers is you don't have to worry about hardware mismatches and warranties. </s>
<s> And you've got that support on their websites, which nowadays is often a live chat. </s>
<s> If you build your own, you run the risk of getting jipped and making mistakes that could cost you a lot of money. </s>
<s> Computers nowadays aren't at all what they were 10 years ago. </s>
<s> I don't mean that in the speed and technology sense, but in the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; sense too. </s>
<s> Those complete brand name systems offer consumers a no hassle, no nonsense, high quality alternative to the run around and being shafted by people who just want your money. </s>
<s> Compaq may have a faster video card, sound card, more memory, and faster chip for you on their web site that could cost you a lot less than a new computer. </s>
<s> The situation in USA is different to Australia as here computer shop builds of Desktops are far superior to brand name. </s>
<s> The PCUser magazine, almost monthly set a set of criteria to build a desktop too and the larger computer shop builders always are superior and cheaper. </s>
<s> Only occasionally do brand name desktops get anywhere near the selected criterior, that also includes price and performance. </s>
<s> PC User magazine is the largest Computer Mag in Australia and is highly regarded within the Industry. </s>
<s> Many Local computer shops are crooks here too, so by getting a desktop built to a PC uers specification can be the only safe way to build a system if you are not very computer savy. </s>
<s> When you buy a desktop here you get much more detail as to what is inside than USA sites I have looked at. </s>
<s> Good computer shops will give you a full 3 year hardware warranty as this is what good manufacturers give. </s>
<s> A good shop will just replace any faulty parts and deal with the manufacturer for you. </s>
<s> If components are sourced from a Chinese supplier direct, not a local agent this causes all the warranty problems. </s>
<s> Our overall pricing is cheaper here than USA Our AU$ is worth 75 cents US. </s>
<s> Overall computer salesman here are rated like car salesmen,not reliable and they tell lies. </s>
<s> A good honest local techie is hard to find especialy if you know about computer hardware and cannot be bluffed and lied to. </s>
