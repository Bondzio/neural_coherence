I have an Acorp 6BX/VIA83 MB.
Fan1 and Fan2 on the motherboard are not working any longer.
I used a tester on the three prongs and this is what reads: Fan1= prong1 11.1v, prong2 .91v, prong3 is the ground Fan2= prong1 3.5v, prong2 9.53v, prong3 is the ground My BIOS has nothing for fan settings.
I haven't found any program that controls my motherboard fan.
The only trouble shooting was plugging an exhaust fan into all 3 fan oulets off my motherboard.
It only works in FAN3.
Is there any troubleshooting I can do with this problem, or is my motherboard going on me?
Thanks for any info you can pass my way, -Joe
