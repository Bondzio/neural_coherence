I have a Netgear router, VPN 824. I connected both notebooks with the router(note that I had set up the rooter two years ago using a PC) Now, I want to create a LAN so that I can share files between two computers. I scouted this web site and I found information dated in 2005 on how to add a PC with XP system to a MAC but this does not seem to help. Any help/idea is greatly appreciated

Your problem is sharing drives of dissimilar file systems, which can't see each other. What you need is a file system both can see and write files on. That would be a FAT32 partition on one of the computers, or a LAN capable external harddrive with FAT32 partitions on it, hooked to the router. Here's a page about what Mac computers can read only, read and write to for file systems. Claims Mac can at least read NTFS partitions, so curious if yours can &quot;see&quot; files on the Vista computer?
