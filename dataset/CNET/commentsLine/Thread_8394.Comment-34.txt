all you need is one of those zelman fans so that the fan directly blows strait out back .
zelman heat sink fans are very good for cooling and it's the copper ones that you want as you know its good at removing heat .also you need decent thermal compound that is what most computers now use for thermal solution i suggest you get silver based thermal compound and all you need to do is spreed a fin layer on to the cpu.
