I configured one on newegg with Socket 939 and it came to about $900. I configured another with Socket AM2 for about $1000. Is it worth $100 more to go with AM2? I heard it's only 1% faster.

And it's only if you get DDR2 that's running at a high enough frequency, at that. Really, AM2 is just a backstop until K8L comes out in about 2 years. AM2 processors are going to use less power, so if that's something you're concerned about, go with the AM2 system. Otherwise, honestly, it's really not going to matter too much.
