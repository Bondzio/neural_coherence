This is easy to cure IF the drivers for the video card support the needed video mode as well as you installing the matching MONITOR.INF that came with the monitor in question.
You have some installing to do.
As there is no standard here, I can only offer generic directions.
In short, video drivers then the monitor.inf that describes the monitor capabilities.
