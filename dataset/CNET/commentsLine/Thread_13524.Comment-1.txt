i bought a brand new sony computer in dec 2003, pcv-rz44g, and i have had problems with it ever since i bought it, it's running really slow, freezes all the time, takes 15 minutes to start up, get error messages all the time, have to restore it every 2 weeks, can't use the preinstalled software etc... have called sony maybe 15-20 times for the last 9 months, took the computer to compusa for check up and no progress, same as before, sony sent a rep to come over to change the harddrive, was little bit faster for 2 weeks then the same thing again.
but a week ago i had my friend check it and under system properties i only have 256mb of ram, but this model is suppose to have 512mb of ram.
called sony and the only thing they can offer is to send me another 256mb of ram, but i feel really cheated since i have had this computer for nine months and i paid $1800 for it and it has not been working at all, i mean today for a computer like this i would only pay around $800 and if i would to spend $1800 today i would be able to get something really good!
sony doesn't wanna take any responsibility at all and they even accused me for taking the memorycard out!
i have never ever in my entire life been treated with such disrespect then from sony!
what can i do in a situation like this???
i will never ever spend any money at all for any sony products again.
i think it's not more then fair for sony to take the computer back and return my money so i can go and buy a computer that actully work.
