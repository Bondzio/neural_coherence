this is good info.
i'm in the market for a new system, and ibuypower is one i looked at.
good prices, but not if they sell garbage.
cyberpowerpc.com has a very similar interface and look.
are they the same company, or is this just the way several online computer companies look?
also, does anyone know what's the deal with &quot;professional wiring&quot; costing extra?
if you don't pay do they let their preschooler wire your box??
?
