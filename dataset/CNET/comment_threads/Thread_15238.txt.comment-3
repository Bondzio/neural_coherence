Using MiniTool Partition Wizard's __ function I ran Check and Fix which told me one file was &quot;entirely unreadable&quot; and was removed.
It also said it repaired 25 files.
While attempting to close MiniTool and open My Computer the explorer.exe froze (as it often does while trying to access the drive) and I had to unplug the drive.
Upon plugging it back in I found it is no longer called &quot;My Book&quot; as WD had names it, but it is now &quot;Local Disk&quot; and will not open.
Did I just ruin my chances of recovering the 1 gig of photos i had left to copy?
What else can I do to recover these files?
Please help!
