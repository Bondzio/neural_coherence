1.1.1	This probably is a dummy question , but I 'm very new to wireless usage , so maybe someone can provide the info I need .	St
1.1.2	Thanks in advance for any information .	St
1.1.3	I live in the south .	St
1.1.4	There is a church near my house which has a school as a part of its operation .	St
1.1.5	Last year I bought a laptop equipped with the hardware necessary for wireless connections .	St
1.1.6	For a few months I got a message on firing up the laptop that a wireless connection had been detected .	St
1.1.7	I do n't know if it was the church 's connection or not , although I suspected it was because it was the largest quasi-business use nearby .	St
1.1.8	I figured it probably was and did n't try connecting , and several months ago , I stopped getting the message .	St
1.1.9	Early this year the local mullet wrapper printed a story about the county 's looking into providing a county-wide wireless system for the general public .	St
1.1.10	In the meantime , the local library system has established wireless servers ( ?	Ques
1.1.11	) at each of its branches ; yesterday I went to one of the branches and finally learned how to actually use a wireless connection .	St
1.1.12	This morning , before I left for the library branch that I used yesterday , I decided to use my dialup connection at home .	St
1.1.13	After the laptop warmed up , I got the & quot ; wireless connection detected & quot ; message .	St
1.1.14	So , I connected and am nowing using it ; it is about as fast as a DSL connection .	St
1.1.15	Is it possible that the connection I 'm using is , in fact , the county library 's system and that the coverage of the system is a lot wider than they 've let on publicly ?	Ques
1.1.16	In other words that I do n't need to go to the branches ?	Ques
1.1.17	The only thing that makes me think this is n't correct is that a lady at the library who was also using her laptop said that a certain spot in that branch did not have as good a connection as where we were .	St
1.2.1	Bump	St
1.3.1	A typical wireless connection is good for approx .	St
1.3.2	100 ft. indoors and 300 ft. outdoors , depending on the location of the router .	St
1.3.3	There are ways of course to boost this , but to the best of my knowledge , 1000 ft. would be the best you could ever achieve in a & quot ; perfect & quot ; world .	St
1.3.4	So , not knowing how close you are/were to each of the wireless signals you describe , it is difficult to answer your question completely .	St
1.3.5	There are several cities in the US that have & quot ; city-wide & quot ; coverage of a broadband connection , but even there , certain areas can not connect , and these use a totally different transmission than your typical wireless router .	St
1.4.1	The wireless connection disappeared around noon yesterday , so I thought I 'd go to one of the library branches to use their wireless .	St
1.4.2	Five hair-pulling hours later , I still could not connect to it , even though there were people with laptops all around me connecting without a problem .	St
1.4.3	Unfortunately , the library workers can not help , even though they offer wireless use to the public .	St
1.4.4	They claim they can not afford the bucks to hire help people who are comptetent to help people use technology they provide ! !	St
1.4.5	I suppose they 're telling the truth but it is infuriating , to say the least ...	St
1.5.1	Another thing : I was able to connect to the county 's wireless on Monday afternoon with only one minor glitch .	St
1.5.2	That glitch was that my machine did n't automatically detect the wireless system when I fired it up , but I soon found it by hitting the & quot ; Connect to : & quot ; button on the Start button .	St
1.5.3	It then performed a search for wireless connections and found the library system .	St
1.5.4	So why in hell could n't it find it yesterday when I was trying from the same exact spot in the library I used on Monday ?	Ques
