I was just thinking the same since the lenses is thicker then i recall (before i bought the new1), but i went to eye doctor couple of weeks ago and after sight test and more he told me that it's okay... what's make you assume that? there's a chance that my sight deteriorated since several weeks ago? but anyway, do you know what is the recomended distance should be from the eyes to the monitor? and with the setting i believe that theres spesific settings for considerable long time sitting the computer without eyes getting tired i just didnt find those settings... Thanks...

The Optical Technician gets you READING GLASSES and another for driving or outdoors. For me, the set for the computer was not the same as reading glasses. Bob
