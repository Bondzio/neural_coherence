You did state that you couldn't see it in Disk Management.
Try Disk Management one more time and INITIALIZE it: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000588.htm If that doesn't work, I'd install the hard drive as a secondary drive in my desktop.
Then, try initializing it in Disk Management again.
If that fails, try SeaTools from Seagate.com.
