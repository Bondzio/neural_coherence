as a retired expert on hdds especially microdrives, i feel qualified to discuss this topic.
the media life expectancy is well over 20 years, that is, the time the media will retain the magnetic data if it's set on the shelf.
the primary failure (wearout) item in any hdd is the bearings.
usually caused by machines that are run 24x7 or sudden shock.
rarely do you see a mobile drive failure by bearings in laptop drives that are used as portable machines however more and more are being used as home office machines and may be left spinning more than 12hrs/day.
for the external question, the major threat is shock caused by an accidental drop which could damage the bearings causing the disk to not run true and loss of data could occur.
take care of the drive, limit spin hours and your drive should last for 10-15 years or more.
then there are those pesky electronic failures that just happen... can't predict those.
