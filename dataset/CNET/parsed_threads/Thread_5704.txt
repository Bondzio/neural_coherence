<s> Hi I've been searching for a very long time for an answer to my problem. </s>
<s> I'm hoping someone here may have that answer. </s>
<s> =o) I have a Netgear WGT624v2 108Mbps wireless router. </s>
<s> 2 PCs are connected wirelessly with Netgear WG311T PCI cards and 1 PC is connected wired to the router. </s>
<s> The problem is this: When viewing certain websites/pages over wireless, the router will lock-up. </s>
<s> The router lights perform normal, even Windows (XP Pro and Home) remains ''connected'' but there's no connection. </s>
<s> Wired PC can't connect, can't connect to the router's configuration pages, can't browse local network, it completely shuts everything out. </s>
<s> All caused by simply trying to load a web page. </s>
<s> When viewing these sites/pages over wired however, the problem doesn't occur. </s>
<s> It's only over wireless, on any PC, that the problem can happen. </s>
<s> There are various sites that can cause this, so when viewing Google results chances are one of them will lock-up the router requiring a router reboot. </s>
<s> You can only imagine how frustrating that is! </s>
<s> What's interesting is if I reboot the router and view a page I know causes this straight away, sometimes the page will load fine. </s>
<s> If however I view a few pages first before the ''culprit'' page, it will definitely lock-up. </s>
<s> Also, it's not specific to a DNS name but more a URL/website area. </s>
<s> For example, www.bbc.co.uk works fine as does 99% of its pages, but www.bbc.co.uk/weather does not. </s>
<s> That section will kill my router 99.99% of the time. </s>
<s> There are other sites such as reporter.mozilla.org that will do the same thing and countless others. </s>
<s> Netgear support have been fantastic. </s>
<s> I have a support rep who calls me at home and we try various things (testing with encryption off, various other router settings) and I've even been sent a new version of the router. </s>
<s> A WGT624v3, which is much improved, still has the same problem! </s>
<s> Could it be a compatibility issue with my cable modem? </s>
<s> I've never seen an issue like this before, have you? </s>
<s> Regards, Craig. </s>
<s> I might also clean out those Temporary Internet pages as well as those cookies and clear the History file. </s>
<s> While I consider it much like a car maker delivering a busted car and asking you to do the final fix, the FIRMWARE on your new router is often out of date. </s>
<s> The maker's website should have the update and how to install it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for both replies. </s>
<s> Trying a different brand isn't a solution I'm afraid. </s>
<s> My router uses proprietary methods to delivery 108Mbps. </s>
<s> Else I'll have 108Mbps cards running at 54Mbps. </s>
<s> Cookies are not stored, cache is emptied when Firefox is closed, History isn't even stored (0 days setting). </s>
<s> Not that I don't appreciate your reply but that's too obvious a solution and of course I've already tried it. </s>
<s> Besides, the problem doesn't happen on wired, even with a full cache. </s>
<s> I keep the firmware up-to-date. </s>
<s> In fact, at one point it seemed to improve on a few updates. </s>
<s> The firmware with the v3 model is up-to-date. </s>
<s> It's only just hit the stores. </s>
<s> As a gesture Netgear have replaced my v2 with a v3. </s>
<s> I've still got to work out this problem though. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I have the same issue, running the same router, but with the original v1 model. </s>
<s> It often locks up, and the only fix is to manually reset the power. </s>
<s> I've tried the same maintenance as well - firmware upgrades, cleaning out temp, cache, and cookie files, etc. </s>
<s> Though it could be a specific problem with the 108 Mbps function, I've yet to find a solution. </s>
<s> It's dissapointing, but the only solution (if you want to maintain 108 Mbps) may be to upgrade to a new model, though there's no guarantee that you won't run into the same problem. </s>
<s> I've tried different modes (Auto 108, 108 only, standard G (54Mbps)), various encryption options on and off, and it makes no difference. </s>
<s> There must be thousands of people with Netgear routers on the same ISP as me. </s>
<s> I'm going to try my router and card on a friend's PC who has the same ISP as me and see if it works there. </s>
<s> If it does, I'll have to try and get a new cable modem from my ISP... =o) </s>
<s> Even though the WGT624 v3 model just hit the stores, it may have been boxed months ago. </s>
<s> Take a look at the firmware on Netgear.com. </s>
<s> It looks like there is a &quot;version 1.0.128_1.0.1&quot;. </s>
<s> It was published on 15-SEP-2005 and includes 12 bug fixes. </s>
<s> On the other end, download the latest driver for the wireless network adapter. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Another C|NET member did and was told a specific version of firmware to use. </s>
<s> It cured their issue. </s>
<s> Sometimes you must ask mother. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> For the passed year, I've always used the latest firmware. </s>
<s> Even releases that aren't public yet and still no joy. </s>
<s> With regards to the cards, they're using the latest drivers too. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I would have returned it as defective. </s>
<s> Called in to who? </s>
<s> (Dumb question? </s>
<s> lol) This is why I posted my problem here, hoping someone had the same issue and a fix for it. </s>
<s> It's quite a unique case, otherwise it would be known by Netgear. </s>
<s> There were a few previous versions of firmware that seemed to perform better -- but the problem was still there. </s>
<s> That suggests a flaw in the firmware, but there's thousands of people who use Netgear routers on the same ISP as me. </s>
<s> It would be known straight away if there was such a problem. </s>
<s> When I test it at my friend's house on his connection, if the result is fine, I'll ask for a new cable modem from my ISP. </s>
<s> My current one is around 5 years old and the modems they ship now are completely different. </s>
<s> I have already had it replaced once (the company I bought it from said it sounds faulty) but I was disappointed to find the problem was still there. </s>
<s> 2 months of waiting for Netgear support to reply (lol) I get a personal phone call from one support tech who's currently trying his best to solve the problem. </s>
<s> We were hoping the version 3 (I had version 2) would be the fix, but we were wrong. </s>
<s> Still, I got a nicer (more expensive too!) </s>
<s> looking router as a replacement. </s>
<s> It's still frustrating though... =o( </s>
