Joshi	2/1/08 11:33 PM	1.20190878E12	My USB Webcam SN9C103 does not work with Vista	Hi: I have purchased a Webcam (Model No &quot;SN9C103&quot; make Tevion) in last year. This Webcam was working perfectly fine with Windows XP operating system loaded on my old laptop. I changed my laptop, which has &quot;Windows Vista&quot; pre-loaded on it. Now I am trying to install this Webcam on the new laptop and it is not getting installed. During installation, I am getting a message &quot;Not enough storage is available to complete this operation&quot;. Can anybody help in installing this Webcam? Warm Regards Chandrashekhar S. Joshi

I hope this is the brand name/Manufacturer for this Web Cam. Of the few sites that did list some form of driver for it, none said they had a driver for Vista. Seek out the manufacturer of this product and see if the driver is available from there web site. I had the same problem with a web cam and the simplest solution was to get a new one. Also, I have McAfee site advisor on my computer and I don't believe I've ever seen so few sites reviewed or so many yellow warnings then I had on this search. Where did you get that thing? There certainly in a bad neighborhood.

The part number should be listed on the WebCam or on the driver CD/DVD, if not check the settings program within all programs. Some times drivers aren't created/designed correctly so they don't work. Contact this site for assistance. One last note try totally uninstalling the driver before you install those available from this site. This will provide a &quot;clean&quot; install of the driver. Over wrighting them sometimes causes trouble. A question do you like the webcam when it works? How is the HiRes? Is it really clear?
