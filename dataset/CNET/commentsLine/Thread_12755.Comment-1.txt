i am using a wireless hook up to connect to my isp.
i have an adlink sender/receiver that is wired directly to a buffalo g54 air station router.
my desk top pc is wired directly to the router and my notebook connects by wireless.
this system works fine, but my wife recently bought a home networking system.
this system required a dsl or better hook up.
after talking to the phone company we found out that the only option we had was a fiber optics 100mb hook up.
so, with a lot of expense and a long wait we have a fiber optics internet connection sitting in the house.
my wife's home networking system has a dedicated isp address, that is in japanese, i don't read japanese and have no interest in connecting to this isp.
but, i am quite interested in connecting to the internet and using my current isp through this fiber optics connection.
there is only one plug available to the box that the phone company installed, is it as simple as adding an adapter to supply two connections to this box?
or do i have to buy a different router and possibly other hardware to be able to use two different isp's?
i'd appreciate any help.
thanks.
bob
