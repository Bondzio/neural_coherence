hey there well it took me a while to figure out that while i had to not type the &quot;exe&quot; file extension on a&gt;awdflash, i did have to type the &quot;.bin&quot; extension on the new bios filename.
i am up and running -- and it is recognizing the 40 gb drive now!
hooray!
how big of a drive can this soyo 6ba+ mobo recognize now with the bios update ya spose?
