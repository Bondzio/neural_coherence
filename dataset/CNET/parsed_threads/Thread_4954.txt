<s> I have just got my HP d4100e with this motherboard installed (ASUS A8AE-LE). </s>
<s> It has two 512 modules installed. </s>
<s> I want to install this &quot;Corsair XMS 1GB DDR, XMS3200&quot; Module. </s>
<s> However, I'm not sure if I need to install two 1GB module into the first two channels and the two 512 in the second two? </s>
<s> Looking for some help </s>
<s> if u have 2 doesnt really matter. </s>
<s> wat do u need 3gb of memory for? </s>
<s> or do u only have 1 module of corsair xms 1gb? </s>
<s> if so since it is dual channel u will only get total of 1.5gb </s>
<s> I only have one module of the Corsair. </s>
<s> By installing this in the far left channel and the two 512 modules in the next two channels, I will only get 1.5 GBs. </s>
<s> I order to get 2 GBs, I would need another 1 Gig stick. </s>
<s> the problem is dual channel. </s>
<s> u need to install ram in pairs. </s>
<s> since u have 3, u can go either with what u have, 512 and 512, or 1gb and 512. if u get an additional 1gb module, u can have 1gb and 1gb and 512mb and 512mb occupying all 4 slots. </s>
<s> Have a happy holiday </s>
