<s> My p/s fan stopped blowing and the unit needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> It is rated at 350; is it safe to replace it with a 400? </s>
<s> But since you can't or may not check to see that each 5 volt, 12 volt and such AMPERES are sufficient from the new 400 and that most specs are widely optimistic, I suggest you move to the 450 Watt or more since they are under 20 bucks and will keep you out of trouble. </s>
