i have a tv tuner card for recording tv shows, and sometimes burn them to a rw disk and watch them at work, lol.
i use the tuner card to capture analog vids i'm slowly archiving to dvd.
i use the firewire port from the audigy soundblaster bay to capture vids from my digital video camera.
so the new card doesn't factor into my video capturing stuff.
the new card seems to be working well, but not at highest resolution settings, but i can live with that.
could be my system isn't fast enough to pump out the frame-rates i wanted?
on a different note, i went back to the shop where i bought the card, and told the guy to &quot;start eating&quot; cuz he promised me the card would run great at highest settings, and if it didn't he said he'd eat the card.
i was just busting his chops.
we both agreed it's probably my system (i told him i wanted to buy a higher end card; he told me to stop wasting my $$, lol).
to make up for my troubles, he gave me a brand new motorola cable modem i almost bought at circuit city yesterday for $60 after a rebate.
my isp just upgraded broadband download speeds to 7mb/sec(!
), so i don't have to rent a cable modem anymore.
good deal, huh.
do kinda wish in retrospect that i got a higher end card, but the guy probably did me a favor by not selling me one, lol.
