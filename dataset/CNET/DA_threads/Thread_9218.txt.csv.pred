1.1.1	I have a 17 & quot ; Powerbook that 's about 3 years old running system 10.3.9 .	St
1.1.2	I 'm a graphic designer so its got the usual line up of graphics software : Adobe CS2 , a couple of web browsers ( Safari and Firefox ) , pictures in iPhoto and some music in iTunes ( but not a lot . )	St
1.1.3	It 's apparently 75 GB hard drive with 15.31 GB available .	St
1.1.4	For the last several months it sounds like the fan is running all the time .	St
1.1.5	Sometimes it sounds like two fans are running - kind of a & quot ; whirrrrr & quot ; sound .	St
1.1.6	It stops when I put it to sleep or shut it down .	St
1.1.7	Is this a cause for concern ?	Ques
1.1.8	Do these things run hot after a while or do I have some bigger issue to deal with ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks in advance for your help .	St

1.2.1	Check for dust .	St
1.2.2	Open up the laptop and clean it out with compressed air .	St
1.2.3	Make sure you clean the CPU cooler well , this is most likely the source of the problem .	St
1.2.4	Gently wiggle the CPU cooler and see if it 's tight to the mother board .	St
1.2.5	Do n't force it .	St
1.2.6	Try to keep your hands off the metal components .	St
1.2.7	Try these two suggestions first .	St
1.2.8	The cleaning should be done periodically depending on how often you use the laptop .	St
1.2.9	You will need to decide how often that will be .	St
1.3.1	but the fans should hold the temp to a within tolerances .	Sug
1.3.2	Once you have followed the other posters advice , see if running one graphic program at a time produces the increased fan noise .	St
1.3.3	I had a copy of SNOOD , that well known graphics program , that took 100 % of the processor , which in turn made the fans go so fast that it sounded like a freight train .	St
1.3.4	Once I had made the connection , SNOOD went out the window .	St
1.3.5	Check out Activity Monitor , Applications & gt ; Utilities , when the fans spin up and see if you can spot what is going on with the system .	St

1.4.1	The chill pad has 2 fans built into it which are powered off of a USB port .	St
1.4.2	I often have the iBook 's internal fans kick on if I 'm not using the chill pad but hardly ever , when the chill pad is connected and running .	St
1.4.3	Rubber pads also allow air to circulate under the iBook for better cooling .	St
1.4.4	For convenience and portability , I used self stick velcro tape to connect the iBook 's bottom side to the plastic , lightweight chill pad .	St
1.4.5	This way , it moves around the house as one unit .	St
1.4.6	I have handed it to people who never realized the chill mat was not part of the computer .	St
1.4.7	Since I run Tiger on my G4 ...	St
1.4.8	I use a widget called iStat Pro to monitor functions and hardware .	St
1.4.9	Temps on CPU , RAM , and HD can vary as much as 15 degrees Fahrenheit , when I use the cooling pad on my lap top .	St
1.4.10	If I get another laptop , I will definitely get another cooling pad ( no matter what brand ) for it .	St
1.4.11	It performs better and stays cooler , and I expect a longer operating life out of it because it has seen less wear and tear ( heat wise ) .	St
1.4.12	cheers grim PS : in the time I took to write this , I turned off the chill pad 's fans ... and the CPU temp rose from 122F to 128F .	St
1.5.1	You 're expecting a Powerbook to be quiet ?	Ques
1.5.2	POWA !	St
1.6.1	I note you do n't claim to own one or use one but I will concede that you know what one is .	St
1.6.2	On what do you base your comment ?	Ques
1.6.3	Just wondering if it was based on any factual information , first hand experience , etc.. How 's the eMachine running ?	Ques

1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	Thanks for the advice .	St
1.9.2	I 'm not sure I 'm capable of opening this thing up and cleaning it but at least I know what to ask for at the service center .	St
1.9.3	Tony	St
1.10.1	I 'll give it a try after its cleaned .	St
1.10.2	Tony	St
