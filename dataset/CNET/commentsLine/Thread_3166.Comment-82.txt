i thought this reply was excellent and it confirmed what i had expected... these drives, if left to run and run will last a very long time... if the numbers given (750,000 hours = mtbf) are right... that's over 80 years... you will be very old before your drive gives up... maybe there is a decimal point problem there, but 8+ years is still pretty good.
that's continuous running... however, contrary to what has been said elsewhere... maybe switching on and off lots of times isn't so healthy - the 'stress' of start-up will doubtless do more harm to moveable parts than constant running... remember newton's first law... pre-penultimately (this is my first post, i think)... at least one drive manufacturer - seagate - has free downloadable software that analyses the health of your hard drive.
i don't know for sure, but it probably compares actual read-write times with the expected times for different sections of the disk... i have used it several times and am still using, as a second hard drive, an old 1997 6gb drive... don't ask me why, i'm a bit bonkers that way... the seagate tools program says that it analyses some other manufacturers' drives as well... get the software from  .
penultimately: of course you can run said software and some evil gremlin can cause your drive to crash - we are talking in hundredths of millimetres in the amount of substance that is needed for operation of some parts of the drive.
finally... i wish all readers of this post their fully 750,000 hours of trouble-free disk usage... mike
