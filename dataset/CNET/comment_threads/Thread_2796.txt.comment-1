Recently I was curious about getting more RAM for my computer but I didn't know which I had to buy in order to make my computer faster.
So I decided to open up the computer and take out the RAM to see what type it was.
After placing it back into the memory slot (pretty secure and in place) I turned on my computer again, only to find out that the monitor had no screen except for the &quot;Self-Test&quot; display, and after 25 seconds, a long beep occurs, then stops and repeats it self in the same process.
Any idea's what's going on?
