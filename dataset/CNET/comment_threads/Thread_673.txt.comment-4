Did you take the 80GB drive out and install XP fresh on it or did you just try and use it with the Emachine disk that was working in the other system.
Windows XP hard drives just will not boot on another system with different hardware, and you probably can't put it back in the old system and get it working there either because you would have corrupted it putting it in a new system.
Windows XP is extremely dependent on the hardware in the system it was installed in.
The differences in hardware makes it impossible to port Windows XP hard drives to a new system, like we used to do with Windows 98 (and even then you had to do tricks to get it working).
Even a retail version of Windows XP would have this problem.
You need to do a fresh install and when you do that you have to have a new copy of XP, the one that came with the Emachine will never authenticate in the new system.
While others have mentioned the OEM license, that really isn't an issue, I have installed OEM versions on other brand systems, as a test, and they come up just fine, won't authenticate (you have 30 days), need a valid license, but they install and work just fine...then I blew them away and installed a good license, but I was able to prove the point (in this case a Dell copy on an HP Pavilion).
