yes, that happens with people who use their external disk as storage, without making a backup of the data on it.
a very common story in this forum.
some people only learn about backup when it's too late.
sorry to read you were one of them.
and no storage manufacturer is responsible for the consequences of losing data.
safeguarding that is your own responsibility.
all you get is what you pay for: a one (or 2 or 3) year warranty on the hardware.
