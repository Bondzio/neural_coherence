&quot;So, do I need to just take this monitor apart and the problem you say will be easy to spot?
Then just solder the bad connections?&quot; What choice is there and if it's a bad solder joint then all that's left is how good an inspector you are and whether you find it.
Some won't dive in because they are afraid to break it.
Let me write this.
It's broken so we can proceed without fear.
And repair at a shop exceeds replacement cost so what is there to fear but ____ itself?
