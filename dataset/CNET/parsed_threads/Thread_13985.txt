<s> I have two WPN802 (Netgear Rangemax APs) one acting as a repeater. </s>
<s> I live in a large(ish) bungalow with many walls and doors From last September (2006) until June 2007 the combination worked very well. </s>
<s> The recent Summer in Ireland was poor. </s>
<s> Lately (August) with an increase in atmospheric high pressure the repeater is having difficulty connecting with the primary AP Are there better products on the market now that will enable me to get very good range without being too badly affected by high pressure conditions? </s>
<s> (Netgear WPN802 was a huge advance over my earlier SMC products) Do I have to revert to a wired solution? </s>
<s> Does the new 802.11n standard help in any way (I am more concerned about range than speed). </s>
<s> TIA Joe Kelly Ireland </s>
<s> I'd move the repeater closer to the router. </s>
<s> Even a few feet may help. </s>
<s> I'll share I picked up a refurb wpnt834 for 70 bucks and the range has been amazing. </s>
<s> The first thing I did was go get the latest firmware and set it up the way I do all over. </s>
<s> That is, stock settings then broadcast the SSID and WPA for security. </s>
<s> It's on the far side of my house and I can connect to it two houses down 300 feet away. </s>
<s> Very nice. </s>
<s> I also have the Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 which was 50 bucks and loaded the White Russian with WEBIF firmware. </s>
<s> Same settings of stock, SSID and WPA. </s>
<s> It connects well at the house 2 doors door. </s>
<s> I'm unsure why you would need repeaters unless your firmware is old or you disabled SSID broadcast. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, A few feet has made a difference but its now in a place that will probably cause my wife to pick it up and throw it in the bin! </s>
<s> (bin = thrash can) I need the repeater because the WPN802 repeater is better at connecting to the primary than my wireless connections in the computers are and I have several. </s>
<s> I'll check into the WPNT834. </s>
<s> Will I need two. </s>
<s> Do they have a repeater mode? </s>
<s> Joe </s>
<s> But I don't use the 834 in such a mode. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Since it's working at some 300 feet I don't need a repeater. </s>
<s> Bob. </s>
