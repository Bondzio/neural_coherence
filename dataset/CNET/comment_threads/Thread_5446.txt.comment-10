Only now know what the real issues are.
You may want to rethink such posts since they rarely get back on track of the real problem.
-&gt; Now that I know this I can share that many i845 boards had bad caps (see google about BAD CAPS) and many are old.
The old, tired power supply can have the same issue so we know to inspect for the bad caps plus pop in a monster power supply for a test run.
We also leave the cover off until we think we've fixed it.
