1.1.1	Well , as the title suggests , I am making my first build .	St
1.1.2	So my budget is around 30,000 INR .	St
1.1.3	( 1 $ = Roughly 65 Rupees ) ( Approx 450 $ ) So here is my proposed build : Case : Cooler Master N300 NSE-300 KKN1 Mid tower case CPU : AMD FX - 4300 Black edition MoBo : Asus M5A78L-M LX V2 or Gigabyte GA-78LMT-USB3 ( confused as I want a USB 3.0 ) RAM : Corsair Vengeance CMZ4GX3M1A606C9 4*1 4 GB ( 1600 DDR3 ) GPU : Confused .	St
1.1.4	I do n't know which one to get .	St
1.1.5	Preferably under 3000Rs .	St
1.1.6	HDD : WD Blue WD10EZEX 1 TB .	St
1.1.7	Optical drive : Samsung SH 224 DB/IDDS PSU : Another place of confusion .	St
1.1.8	One of the calculators suggested I get a 300W one , whereas one showed around 450W .	St
1.1.9	Please suggest .	Sug
1.1.10	And one more question .	St
1.1.11	Well , the site says that the motherboard supports Windows 7 .	St
1.1.12	Does that mean it ca n't run Windows 8 ?	Ques
1.1.13	Also , I 'm buying parts from flipkart.com I 'm not sure whether this will be enough for hardcore gaming and stuff but my mom needs it now so I did a lot of research and found out all this .	St
1.1.14	I already have a monitor for my needs .	St
1.1.15	A friend of mine will provide me the OS ( Win 7 Ultimate or Win 8 ? )	Ques
1.1.16	I 'm confused A LOT .	St
1.1.17	Please help .	St
1.2.1	Did you look at the AMD A10 ?	Ques
1.2.2	That way you game for much less .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	You mean the AMD A10- 5800K right ?	Ques
1.3.2	It comes with HD 7660D integrated graphics .	St
1.3.3	Hmm nice option .	Polite
1.3.4	But a good Mobo for that ?	Ques
1.3.5	I want USB 3.0 and preferably 1600Mhz memory supported .	St
1.3.6	( Under a budget though ) : P	St
1.4.1	Tomshardware did benchmark comparisons on motherboards and found so little difference that they do n't do that anymore .	St
1.4.2	Your comment about memory speed is very strange .	Polite
1.4.3	Something a new builder might ask .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I kinda knew it .	St
1.5.2	I googled it and came to know that it should downgrade itself to 1333Mhz .	St
1.5.3	So now I 'm fine with that .	St
1.5.4	But still for the motherboard .	St
1.5.5	I 'm searching , and when I 'll get one I 'll come up with it .	St
1.6.1	I found a motherboard for the FM2 socket type , and now another problem has come up .	St
1.6.2	One of the reviewers says that the position of the RAM slots is such that I ca n't fit Corsair Vengeance RAMs ( or any RAMs with heatsink ) in it .	St
1.6.3	Anyways the motherboard is Gigabyte GA- F2A55M-DS2 .	St
1.6.4	So it seems like I might have to change my RAM .	St
1.7.1	It 's not as if anyone mentioned overclocking and such .	St
1.7.2	So what 's the issue here ?	Ques
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	Not the fan one , the RAM is designed in such a way to cool it down .	St
1.8.2	Let 's just say it is a big sized one .	St
1.8.3	And no , I have no plans of overclocking as of now .	St
1.9.1	Look at crucial.com and you rarely see such addons .	St
1.10.1	http : //www.flipkart.com/corsair-vengeance-ddr3-4-gb-1-x-gb-pc-ram-cmz4gx3m1a1600c9/p/itmd2rypbx4eehaf ? pid=RAMD2RYPMVWCEK6E & otracker=from-search & srno=t_1 & query=RAM & ref=37036966-ff48-4092-be86-29929db6e621 And how is the Motherboard ?	Ques
1.11.1	This is not saying this is for your machine but notice it has no fins .	St
1.11.2	They are not needed .	St
1.11.3	http : //www.amazon.com/Crucial-PC3-12800-Unbuffered-240-Pin-CT51264BA160B/dp/B006YG89Q6	St
1.12.1	If you are going with that mobo and an apu you will be using system ram for video ram .	St
1.12.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820231550 That will get you .	St
1.12.3	Dual channel Faster speed for the video Enough ram for the video to grab as big a chunk as it wants .	St
1.13.1	But the memory clock rate is set by the APU in this case and there 's no need for heat spreaders yet .	St
1.13.2	Bob	St
1.14.1	It looks like the a10 will support 1866 native .	St
1.14.2	It looks like the mobo the op picked will support 1866 native .	St
1.14.3	Since that igp will feed from the system ram ... ..I 'd go with the fastest ram possible ... .native .	St
1.14.4	Heat spreaders ?	Ques
1.14.5	Nice to look at I suppose .	St
1.14.6	Perhaps their of value with the folks that go nut-so with overclocking .	St
1.15.1	You have lots of options .	St
1.15.2	One of which is to go the A10 route ( as R. Proffitt has suggested ) .	St
1.15.3	So , with this in mind : CPU : A10 Series will do the trick ( and have a GPU already ) Mobo : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813128566 It has all the features you 're looking for ( USB 3.0 , DDR3 2400OC/1866/1600/1333/1066Mhz memory modules ) .	St
1.15.4	Gigabyte is one of the best motherboard manufacturers out there , and a gamer 's choice ... you 'll be in good shape .	St
1.15.5	Cost : $ 119 RAM : Your selection is fine ; if anything I 'd consider a total of 8GB since you 're planning on doing lots of gaming ( I 'm a gamer by the way ) .	St
1.15.6	You 'll be looking at $ 80 to $ 100 if you choose this route .	St
1.15.7	Corsair is fine .	St
1.15.8	GPU : the A10-5800K comes with the Radeon HD 7660 GPU .	St
1.15.9	Note , the & quot ; K & quot ; means the GPU/CPU are unlocked , ready for overclocking , that is if you ever choose to overclock them , you will be able to do so .	St
1.15.10	Cost : $ 130 And if you are interested to learn about our A-Series APUs , look here : http : //www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/Pages/consumer-desktops.aspx # 7 HDD : Your selection is fine .	St
1.15.11	But if you are planning to play lots of games , an SSD can be a good alternative ; you 'll have a greater performance ( in terms of access times ) .	St
1.15.12	It will cost you a little more thought .	St
1.15.13	If anything go with a 120GB SSD , make it the bootable drive and use the WD Blue HDD as the secondary/storage drive .	St
1.15.14	Cost for a 120GB SSD is about $ 120 .	St
1.15.15	Again this is just an option ... not a must .	St
1.15.16	Optical Drive : No comment here , I never used a Samsung drive but it 's a great company with lots of good products in the market .	St
1.15.17	You will be fine .	St
1.15.18	PSU : this is important .	St
1.15.19	Make sure to get a 500w ( or greater ) power supply .	St
1.15.20	It 's a good investment and will pay dividends in the long term .	St
1.15.21	It will easily power any of the components listed here and if you ever want to add other device , well you wo n't have to worry about the PSU .	St
1.15.22	I suggest Cooler Master , Corsair or Antec , look here : http : //www.newegg.com/Power-Supplies/SubCategory/ID-58 Cost : about $ 70 About the Operating System : Do n't worry the above are all Windows friendly .	St
1.15.23	From a gamer standpoint , I suggest you run Win-7 ( or Win-7 64bit if you go with 8GB of RAM ) .	St
1.15.24	Win 8 will do just fine too .	St
1.15.25	NOTE : Avoid doing any overclocking if you are new at building/customizing PC system .	St
1.15.26	Start slow Also , the RAM wo n't heat up if you do n't overclock them ... Good luck Drillo283 !	St
1.16.1	Thanks Warsam71 , Your reply was extremely helpful .	St
1.16.2	But the problem is , all included , it goes way over budget .	St
1.16.3	Over 500 $ .	St
1.16.4	I ca n't afford to spend that much .	St
1.16.5	SSD is just is n't an option as it gives less space for more money .	St
1.16.6	Yeah it does have it 's advantages , but it is still very expensive .	St
1.16.7	The motherboard , it costs 12000 Rs .	St
1.16.8	Around 200 $ or less : / Oh well and I still have to buy a good PSU .	St
1.16.9	The 8 GB RAM though was a good idea .	St
1.16.10	I might consider it .	St
1.16.11	Thanks a lot .	St
1.16.12	I will post my final rig when it is decided .	St
1.16.13	Very nicely explained and a detailed reply .	St
1.16.14	Thank you !	St
1.17.1	So as per the proposed changes , I have made a new rig fitting my budget ( yay !	St
1.17.2	: D ) I still have no need for a monitor .	St
1.17.3	So , here is the new changed rig .	St
1.17.4	Case : Cooler Master N300 NSE-300 KKN1 Mid tower case Processor : AMD A10 - 5800K MoBo : MSI- FM2-A85-XMA-P33 ( Got one that gets all my needs + in my budget : D ) RAM : Corsair Vengeance CMZ4GX3M1A606C9 4*1 4 GB ( 1600 DDR3 ) HDD : WD Blue WD10EZEX 1 TB .	St
1.17.5	Optical drive : Samsung SH 224 DB/IDDS PSU : Corsair CX-500 500W I wo n't install graphic card right now .	St
1.17.6	I hope that the PSU will be sufficient .	St
1.18.1	Just make it a single rail model to avoid having to learn about & quot ; balancing the rails. & quot ; I find most builders only get into that years later .	St
1.18.2	Bob	St
1.19.1	My bad , the case is Cooler Master K281 Midtower	St
1.20.1	Should I go ahead and order these parts ?	Ques
1.20.2	As this fits in my budget and well , prices are about to rise even further so I would like to get them as quickly as possible .	St
1.20.3	Fast reply would help .	St
1.20.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.21.1	If yes , get 2 * 2GBs=4GB or better yet 2 * 4GB=8GB ... ..otherwise if/when you want to add RAM ... you wo n't have to pull out RAM to install the new RAM .	St
1.21.2	Better you get 8GBs ( 2*4GBs ) now that have to do it later .	St
1.21.3	Let us know how it turns out .	St
1.21.4	VAPCMD	St
1.22.1	Hmm ok , and I 'm going to get my parts today , wish me luck !	St
1.22.2	:3	St
1.23.1	The new AMD APU models like this can really put some entry level gaming in easy reach with the ability to add a better graphics card in another year .	St
1.23.2	Bob	St
