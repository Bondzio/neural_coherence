Installing these leads immediately to a Machine Check Exception. Any Ideas?

It's my first attempt at building a PC..untill now I've just swaped parts and such. the only clue i have for you guys is that without installing video card drivers everything is just fine.

I wonder if you forgot some BIOS or flash update, the motherboard drivers (some try what's on the CD and that's buggy or out of date.) With such slim details all I can say is to call the maker and ask what they want to be exchanged. Another nutty thing is overclocking. Imagine the poor soul that tries that. Bob

BIOS is stock, as it came on the mobo, I checked ASUS website for an update however the only BIOS on their site for labeled as &quot;initial release&quot; so im assuming im on that now. here are the numbers in the error 0x0000009c (0x00000000, 0xf7ac3050, 0xp02000040, 0x00000800)

From ASUS' spec sheet: CPU: Socket775 for Intel Pentium Processor Extreme Edition / Pentium D / Pentium 4 / Celeron CPU Memory: Dual channel memory architecture 4 x 240-pin DIMM sockets support max. 16GB DDR2 667/533 non-ECC memory You could try manually setting your RAM to DDR2-667 since DDR2-800 can be problematic even on boards with explicit support. Lastly, the p5n32 has been known to be troublesome with dual core intel CPUs since its release. IMHO, you be best off exchanging the board for one based on the intel 946, 965 or 975 chipset.
