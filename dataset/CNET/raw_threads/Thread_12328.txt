722	0	549088	5239954	NR	kutysjr	12/2/11 8:49 AM	1.32281574E12	Router & Switch	I have 6 computers I need networked together (hard wired), and I also want a wireless connection available for guests. I have the internet connection coming out of the wall (not sure from where.) I'm running internet into router, 5 servers into switch, switch into router, router into &quot;main&quot; computer. On the &quot;main&quot; computer I can see all the servers, but cannot connect to the internet. I'm using Windows 7, and when diagnosing the problem it says the internet from the wall is not reaching the router. When I hard wire the wall connection directly to the main computer I have full internet. Any ideas? Am I just connecting something out of place? Thanks.
