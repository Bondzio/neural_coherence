alows you to run 2 (or more depending on model) pcs from one keboard/mouse/mon.
will need an os on each machine though.
as for sharing the resources/drives, you are going to need a network to share drives/storage.
if you are using a router already then that will prbably have at least 4 ports on it.
just get yourself a network cable or two and your done.
else get a crossover cable (not a normal network cable)and plug it straight from one machines network card to the other.
