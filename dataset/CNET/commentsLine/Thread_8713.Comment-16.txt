i had my last computer for 10 years (running win'98), and only a few months ago did i finally break down & buy an new one (and only because the other one was soooooo slow!).
anyway, during the 10 years, i only cleaned it out once; when i added memory.
i was reading this weeks current c-net question of the week (concerning a noisy computer) and it finally occurred to me that's probably why my last computer was sooooo loud!
so, that leads me to my question.
how do i clean out the inside?
simply take off the cover and blow (i'd feel better about canned air; i'm afraid i'd suck out something i wasn't supposed to if i used a vaccume)?
another post warned about possibly voiding your warranty if opening the cover during the warranty period.
problem is, this is a smoking house on a dirt road with 2 dogs a few blocks from the beach (lots of sand).
so...i don't want to void my warranty, but waithing a couple of years before cleaning doesn't sound like such a great idea either.
what would you do?
thanks!
