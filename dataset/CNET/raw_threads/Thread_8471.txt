While playing a video game last night the system began to lag more and more. My friend quit out of the program and the screen immediately went black. Now when we attempt to reboot the computer goes through the boot process, but when it gets to the point where the Windows loading screen should appear it just goes to black. We suspect it is the video card. The only thing I can think to dispute this is that; number one - the boot info. shows up fine. And Number two - after the screen goes to black the mouse (which is optical) never lights up (which I suspect it would if Windows was still loading.) Any ideas?
