I already installed MoBo drivers.
Thanks (removing and readding the cdrom drive) sotra worked but.. Planescape torment... when i got to a new area it wants the CD, even though the CD's in there.
I don't have this trouble under win98.
Other times with other programs it sometimes has trouble 'seeing' the CD under XP but not win98.
MoBo GA-71XE thunderbird athlon 750.
