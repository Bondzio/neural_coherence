AMD Athlon 3600 64 Bit Dual Core ATHLON 3600 X2 64 BIT MB BIOSTAR NF61S ( Gforce 6100 , 8CH Audio , Red , SATA2 ) DDR2 1 GB 667 MHZ HD 160GB SATA GABINET KIT 400W Price : $ 320 And they gave me a list with lots of options to make my own pc , but im not sure what to chose , all i know is that i want 1 or 2gb ram , been able to play my games online and not having problems with a slow pc , and i think that i dont need more than 80gb hard drive .	St
1.1.2	Any sugestions ?	Ques
1.1.3	here is the list _MEMORY : DDR 512 MB 400MHZ $ 31 DDR 512 MB 400MHZ KINGSTON $ 58 DDR 1,0 GB 400MHZ $ 60 DDR 1,0 GB 400MHZ KINGSTON $ 104 DDR2 512 MB 667 MHZ $ 26 DDR2 512 MB 667 MHZ KINGSTON $ 36 DDR2 1 GB 667 MHZ $ 50 DDR2 1 GB 667 MHZ KINGSTON $ 64 DDR2 1 GB 800 MHZ $ 58 DIMM 512 MB SDRAM 133MHZ $ 54 _MICROS AMD AM2 SOCKET 940 : MICRO S940 SEMPRON 64 BIT 3200+ BOX	St
1.2.1	& gt ; & gt ; & gt ; all i know is that i want 1 or 2gb ram , been able to play my games online and not having problems with a slow pc .	St
1.2.2	I bet you dont even know why you want 2 gb of Ram ?	Ques
1.2.3	All I can tell you is do your research .	St
1.2.4	A couple of things to look for .	St
1.2.5	Most Ram is pretty much the same ( at least with DDR 2 ) .	St
1.2.6	The main difference is how Fast the RAM is , that is what the 667 MHZ , or 800 MHZ means .	St
1.2.7	Usually try to get faster the better .	St
1.2.8	667 MHZ or 800 MHZ would do just fine .	St
1.2.9	Most of your list seems like it is for a Micro computer ( a really small computer ) .	St
1.2.10	Is that really what you want ?	Ques
1.2.11	http : //www23.tomshardware.com/cpu.html Go to this site and compare the different processors and see which one would suite your needs .	St
1.2.12	If it is not on the list then you probably shouldnt be buying it ( its to old ) .	St
1.2.13	I would at least make sure you get a dual core CPU ( either one that says X2 or intel core 2 duo ) .	St
1.2.14	What type of games do you plan on playing ?	Ques
1.2.15	This is where your graphic card would come into play ( pun intended ) .	St
1.2.16	If you want one of the bigger graphic Cards ( 8800 or 2900 XT ) then you probably cant go with a Micro Motherboard/case .	St
1.2.17	This well help with game performance but really your internet speed is the biggest with online games .	St
1.2.18	You probably are better off picking out what you think you want and then post here and we can make fun of you or praise you for your choice .	St
1.2.19	; -0	St
1.3.1	-Well thanks , now i know that ram of 800 MHZ is better .	Polite
1.3.2	-To answer your question , i want 2gb of ram to be able to open different programs at the same time .	St
1.3.3	-You say & quot ; Most Ram is pretty much the same ( at least with DDR 2 ) & quot ; ; what other tipe of ram is out there that i could chose ?	Ques
1.3.4	-The games i play are : Knight Online , Age of Mythology and Mount & Blade .	St
1.3.5	-The games i plan to play are : ArchLord , Counter Strike ( Source if posible ) -My internet conection is 2112 kb/s so that 's not a problem .	St
1.3.6	Now i dont want to get the & quot ; last pc & quot ; , but a & quot ; regular to good & quot ; is fine to me =D , so foget the ( 8800 or 2900 XT ) maybe a 256mb card that is not so expensive or maybe a really good Micro Motherboard/case ... PS : Thanks for your comment and link , it helped me more than you think	St
1.4.1	& gt ; & gt ; & gt ; -To answer your question , i want 2gb of ram to be able to open different programs at the same time .	St
1.4.2	RAM does help with this , but Dual Core helps more .	St
1.4.3	& gt ; & gt ; & gt ; You say & quot ; Most Ram is pretty much the same ( at least with DDR 2 ) & quot ; ; what other tipe of ram is out there that i could chose ?	Ques
1.4.4	Well DDR3 has come out that well be faster in the future , but right now it isnt really that big of different then DDR2 .	St
1.4.5	Also there are faster DDR2 then 800mhz .	St
1.4.6	But you wont notice the difference .	St
1.4.7	& gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; maybe a 256mb card that is not so expensive or maybe a really good Micro Motherboard/case ...	St
1.4.8	Check that same site of tomshardware.com it also has a section to give you the best Graphic Card for the price .	St
1.5.1	Hi , This is similar to the setup that I have , and it was quite a good balance of speed and price .	St
1.5.2	It would be helpful to know your budget first , but here goes : MB S940 ASUS M2N-E SLI ( NO VIDEO ON BOARD ) $ 116 ( video card further down list ) MICRO S940 ATHLON 4200+ X2 64 BIT BOX $ 125 - probably one of the best value processors OR MICRO S940 ATHLON 4000+ X2 64 BIT BOX $ 90 DDR2 1 GB 667 MHZ $ 50 DDR2 1 GB 667 MHZ $ 50 ( for dual channel ) HD 160GB SATA $ 72 ( because more space is always better , and you might suddenly find that you have run out of disk space ) GABINET KIT 400W Price : $ 320 ( keep it the same ) VGA PCIE 256MB GF NX7600GS $ 149 ( aww man i love this card to bits ! )	St
1.5.3	The speed of your RAM does n't really matter much unless your a hardcore overclocker , and you wo n't notice a difference between DDR2-667 and 800 .	St
1.5.4	I would also go for an OEM version of Windows Vista Home Premium Hope this helps	St
