I don't want to get a notebook cause he's still young and dont think he will take care of it. I am trying to get something that's 300 or less. Thanks

You need to see what is out there today and see what folk think. That model may be out of stock or not at your local stores. At the office we have a few too many netbooks. They all perform about the same. The lesson is simple. One is much like the next. Bob
