The battery is only used when the pc is powered off, if the battery is getting wear some of the setting may changed.
When you put in a new battery and checked the bios settings the bios program may have scaned every thing and did a &quot;refresh&quot; of the settings for clock speed memeory speed etc.
So now it's back at a perfomrance setting.
But with out knowing the pc make and bios type it's haed to tell.
