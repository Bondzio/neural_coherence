there is definately a life expecatncy on external hard drives.
seagate make the best, in my opinion, and have a good track record.
i would keep am external hard drive in operation for 5 years at best.
some drives will fail in less time than that.
if you have a 5 year old drive, i would buy a new external hard drive and backup all data on your present external hard drive, possibly to an internal hd until you can transfer over to the new external.
failing that, hope your external hd keeps going until you get your new drive, and transfer immediatly all your files.
if you have a dvd-rw, consider using that to back up your files to dvd as well.
remember, redundant backups are better than no backups.
if you can, use external online storage for your files, especially photos, videos, and text files.
i use megaupload to store my video files, and while i have a premium account, its not neccesary.
the free account will allow up to 90 days of storage before they delete the files, allowing you some breathing space.
i have found that the seagate freeagent 1.5tb external hard drive has the longest warranty, 5 years, so if it fails within this time, you can at least get another.
