hey guys, i am getting my first custom pc this weekend have a couple questions on what ya'll recommend and what all i can do with this pc set up specs are... gigabyte ga-p35-ds3l (rev.
2.0) intel core 2 quad q8200 2.33ghz, 45nm, 1333mhz fsb, 4mb l2 cache logisys 700watt psu 5 or 6gb (cant remember) ddr2 pc6400 800mhz dual channel (expandable to 8gb ddr3 1066mhz dc) seagate 320gb hdd 7200rpm 16mb cache 512mb video geforce forsa 6600 will this set up run win7 x64 good?
i know the video card isnt too new, would i need a new one to run windows 7 x64 better than with the one thats in it?
do ya'll recommend upgrading to 8gb ddr3?
or should i stick with what i have for now.
thanks!
