1.1.1	Going on to a DFI LanParty UT nF3 250Gb motherboard - and I have a choice of two Athlon 64 3400+ CPUs : ADA3400AEP4AX LBAZC 0510APMW or ADA3400AEP4AR CAA2C 0531EPMW From the best info I was able to find - I think the AR is a Clawhammer ( it is also the newer chip ) , and the AX is a Newcastle .	St
1.1.2	( but I do n't know this for sure ) I am not a big OCer , but if I want to , I would like to have that ability , that is why I choose this particular m-board , and the lead question for picking one of these two CPUs .	St
1.1.3	I will be running XP-Pro ( SP2 ) TYIA for any and all assistance - Dam j	St
1.2.1	prices to drop soon 15 May or so if I recall correctly .	St
1.2.2	Supsect dual cores will also drop when the AM2 hit retailers too .	St
1.2.3	For the info ... the AMD site should give you the info you need .	St
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the time VAPCMD , but I have the CPUs in my possesion and I need to choose between them ( ca n't keep both ) .	St
1.3.2	Besides this is a socket 754 board , so ''Dual Core '' chips will not be of help to me .	St
1.3.3	Do you ( or anyone else ) know of a reason one of these CPUs should be favored over the other ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks again for your attention - Dam j	St
1.4.1	same cache ( 512KB ) , same operating freq ( 2.2ghz ) .	St
1.4.2	the AR is the newer rev .	St
1.4.3	if you could find a 3400+ with ADA3400AEP5AR or ADA3400AEP5AP OPNs they would be better for OC'ing since they have 1MB cache and a 2.0ghz op freq ( more headroom ) .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.thedigerati.us/info/amdcpuchart.html	St
1.5.1	Thanks ''ramarc '' for taking the time to post , and the terrific info site for AMD CPUs ...	St
1.5.2	I 've looked for something like this for quite some time .	St
1.5.3	I already have these two # 4 chips , but if I had a 1GB cache chip , that 's the one I 'd be using alright .	St
1.5.4	You 're correct - the AR chip is about 5 months newer , but it also opperates at 2200MHz x11 , while the ''Newcastle '' is 2400MHz x12 - So like you pointed out in your post - ''Headroom '' looks like the deciding factor .	St
1.5.5	Sure wish I knew more about reading the ''Stepping '' codes .	St
1.5.6	Thank you again for your help - Dam j	St
