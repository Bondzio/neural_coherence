<s> I just loaded on Vista RC2, and was all excited to try out the new Vista Media Center with it, since I have never used Media Center before. </s>
<s> Vista automatically installed some drivers that were dated and signed as of 6/21 which is newer than the drivers on this page http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/support/vista.html When it loads up, the screen is all snowy, I can hear some audio from the station, and only barely make out anything. </s>
<s> I tried to fore it and load the older drivers from the Hauppauge page on, but then it said after when I got into Media Center that my TV tuner wasn't supported. </s>
<s> I was pretty sure there was support for my Hauppauge 500 in Vista 64 anyone have any idea to help me get it working? </s>
<s> Thanks, ~J </s>
<s> Vista RC2 is &quot;beta&quot; and until Vista in whatever version does get released offically, don't expect much help from the s/w vendors until then AND expect some drop-out of support as older s/w & h/w is phased out or simply no longer supported. </s>
<s> While you may have more luck with more popular devices or pgms. </s>
<s> as things settle down maybe all this will be cleared-up. </s>
<s> At this point you're on your own or at the mercy of things forthcoming or not. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I understand that. </s>
<s> But seeing a whole drivers page on Hauppauge's site makes it look atleast like they are trying to continue to support it throughout the Vista beta. </s>
<s> The drivers now automatically load in Vista after installed. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there was anyone that might have had any luck getting it to work. </s>
<s> I know the Hauppauge 500 is a popular card, so I figure someone out there has tried it with RC2, and was wondering if they were having the same unforunate luck I have had. </s>
