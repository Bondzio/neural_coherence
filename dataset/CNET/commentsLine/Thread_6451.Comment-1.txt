i'm looking to buy a new gaming pc in the next couple months, and am currently looking at this one here:  as far as high performance gaming goes, is this gonna perform well?
the highest spec game i'll be playing is probably gta iv, and then just older ones like half-life 2. thanks in advance for any help!
