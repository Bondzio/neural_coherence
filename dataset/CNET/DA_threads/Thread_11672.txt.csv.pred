1.1.1	I want to create a network between our conference room and our office .	St
1.1.2	I have a router in our office ( which has four desktop computers ) and i want to extend the network to our conference room , which unfortunately is beyond the reach of the router 's wi-fi .	St
1.1.3	I am contemplating on using repeaters for the signal to reach the conference room and then then installing a network bridge ( with wi-fi ) to network the desktop computers there and facilitate wi-fi access .	St
1.1.4	Another option is to connect the router in the office with a bridge on the conference room with cables .	St
1.1.5	Or is it better to just connect even the desktops in the conference room via wi-fi ?	Ques
1.2.1	If you install a range extender , and the wi-fi laptop can connect , you can still share files .	St
1.2.2	A modern router can connect up to 128 wireless connections .	St
1.2.3	Your choice on wired or wireless .	St
