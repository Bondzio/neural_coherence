1.1.1	How do I know if I have raid implemented and if I do which type of Raid it is ?	Ques
1.2.1	Since to get it implemented you had to add drivers , answer questions about how many drives to put into the raid that it would be so painful to setup that you would remember how it was made .	St
1.2.2	No raid .	St

1.3.1	I did n't setup the server , so I would n't have installed the drivers .	St
1.3.2	The problem is that one of the disks has failed and I want to know if it is possible to remove and reseat the disk without powering off the server .	St
1.4.1	Given the details in your post ( no make , model or other clues ) I think it 's time to call the one that set this up and ask .	St
1.4.2	Only the RAID 5 and up may support disk replacement .	St
1.4.3	And even then I must know which controller or software is used .	St
1.4.4	Some of them have you use some software or control panel to mark the failing drive for removal then you use that again to add the new drive .	St
1.4.5	No guessing allowed from my experience .	St
1.4.6	- & gt ; Let me share what usually happens .	St
1.4.7	If the owners ca n't find out more they usually end up replacing the server or rebuilding it from scratch .	St
