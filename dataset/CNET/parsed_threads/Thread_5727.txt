<s> I am trying to add a dell laptop to my home network consisting of 2 desktops connected to a 2wire 1000homeportal modem with wireless capabilities. </s>
<s> The new laptop had a built in network card. </s>
<s> The SBC CD only wants to set up for a 2wire product. </s>
<s> I am getting a great signal strength but limited or no connectivity. </s>
<s> When I check the ip address it is incorrect. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> What can I do to get this to work? </s>
<s> is done by opening a command prompt and using ipconfig/release and ipconfig/renew. </s>
<s> If your IP is now in line with the rest of your PCs, you should be good to go. </s>
<s> I did try this with no luck. </s>
<s> SBC and 2wire both couldn't help me. </s>
<s> I was hoping someone else had this same problem and a solution. </s>
<s> The previous help you got with this was not correct. </s>
<s> The reason you got limited or no connectivity on your wireless connection, is simply mistyping your WEP key. </s>
<s> If you went to your prefered network list and disconnected from your current wireless connection, you could retype the 10 digit hexadecimal key located on your 2wire 1000sw. </s>
<s> I really hope you already found the answer to this a long time ago. </s>
