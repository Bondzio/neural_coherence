1.1.1	I have a 2003 Viewsonic CRT and have recently purchased a 22&quot; LCD.	St
1.1.2	The problem I will describe in the next paragraph is present on both monitors but much more noticeable LCD.	St
1.1.3	I have tried the LCD monitor on 4 different computer (Laptops and Desktops) with different hardware and the problem present with all so I am pretty sure it is the monitor not the hardware configuration.	St
1.1.4	PROBLEM: When viewing text some of the letters appear redish, greenish or grayish.	St
1.1.5	The redish hue is very apparent in a word which contains double letters like &quot;ii&quot; or &quot;ll&quot;.	St
1.1.6	The smaller the font the more noticible the discolorations.	St
1.1.7	Since I do a lot of wordprocessing and spreadsheet work, I am considering returning the monitor.	St
1.1.8	Has anyone else noticed this problem with Viewsonic or any other brand of monitor?	Ques
1.1.9	I am wondering if it is just a charactertic of the Viewsonic monitors.	St
1.1.10	My husband uses a Sony 19&quot; LCD which has a clear crisp display regardless of how large or small the text is.	St
1.1.11	Unfortunately I can't really afford the cost of a Sony.	St
1.2.1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_resolution	St
1.3.1	I do and have found some difficulty in adjusting my Viewsonic CRT for a perfect edge to edge picture when looking directly in the middle.	St
1.3.2	I see some color distortion toward the edges which disappears when I move or turn my head.	St
1.3.3	Keeping it degaussed helps but isn't perfect.	St
1.3.4	I do get some color distortion my laptop's LCD screen as well.	St
1.3.5	It also lessens depending on my viewing position.	St
1.3.6	I suspect glasses cause some subtle color distortion when light is refracted and the color spectrum components separate.	St
