i had a 40gb maxtor external, it went, and i can't use any of my spare hds with the usb case, i have 2 120 gb maxtor externals, both holding the same data, normally diconnected ( i only connect to a pc, for read/write, which has been completely scanned ), a 120gb internal ( which is external most of the time ) holding much of the same data, and the same data is scattered around a few more internal hds.
i haven't lost any data but it's not easy to find what i'm looking for when i want to check on it.
system, it's not.
data bank, ok. i probably have 10 copies of some files (over-over-overkill) but i wouldn't even mention the possibility of cleaning the system up, unless somebody knows of a utility which can sort it all out.
hah!!!
