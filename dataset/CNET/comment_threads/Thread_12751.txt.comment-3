Cable ties along with thier strap pads which with removal sticky backs can be placed whwere needed for ties best use.
There are also cable spirals or looms which route wires through them.
The spirals are easist as they wrap around like spiral notepads.
Further, there is &quot;shrink tubes/wrap&quot; when applied you then use a heat source(hair dryer&quot; and shrink the routed wires.
Of course route wires/harness as best as possible and keep from hard or rubbing points.
While you can route some wires/harness behind the mtrbd.
its best NOT to as possible prolonged contact could be unknown until too late, beware.
Anything else you create at will as you deem fit.
