I've just burnt a CD-R with some music files (MP3/WMA format). It appears that there is something wrong with the process and I just want to start it over. But the CD burner application now gives me an error saying that there is no enough space. When I tried to re-format the CD, it allowed only the Quick Format. After Quick Format is done, CD is still recognized as that original size of files are occupying the space; thus, there is no enough space available. In the Format function, the Full Format is not an allowed choice. Does this mean that for burning CD-R, once you make a mistake, that's the end of story and you can never reuse that disk? Do I have to throw this disk away and use a new one?
