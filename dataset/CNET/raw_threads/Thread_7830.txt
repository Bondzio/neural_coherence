But it supports 8GB of memory so i somewhat have a hard time believing athelon is it. i'm thinking Phenom x 4? Maby i could contact a different part of Acer. I Emailed help with the question But the response seemed to be from a scripted & & typed by someone with little grasp of the English language completely ignoring my request for above question. possibly pay support if i can't get a definitive answer.
