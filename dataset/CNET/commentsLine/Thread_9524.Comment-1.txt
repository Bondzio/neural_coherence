when i try to burn several audio files it manages one then the burn process aborts and the cd is ejected.
it is ok when burning data cds.
i am using nero 5. the cd writer was installed with a dvd drive too - i have tried the cd writer on its own after removing the dvd drive but this hasn't made any difference.
the cd writer is an acer 24x10x 40x crw 2410a with seamless link and meets the minimum spec for the pc.
the pc is a socket 7 240mhz, with 128mb ram and a 6gb hdd running winse.
the cd writer system requirements are: 200mhz or above cpu; 64mb or above ram; windows 95/98/me/2000 or nt.
the cd writer is set as the slave on hard drive cable.
according to the manula it can be master or slave.
