An IDE hard drive marked as ATA and one marked as Ultra ATA?
My older 60 Gig HD will work in my external USB-2 case but my new 160 &quot;Ultra&quot; will not.
It works perfectly in my desktop as a slave, but it will not work in my external case.
Windows (XP Pro) does not notice the USB device.
But if I put the older 60 Gig drive into the case, XP sees it perfectly.
Just wondering.
And yes, the jumpers are correct, master while in the case.
