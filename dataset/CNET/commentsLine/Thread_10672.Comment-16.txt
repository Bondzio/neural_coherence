ive got an nec multisync lcd.....seemed to me, good computer(alienware ...nvidia 6600gt) good monitor.....yet after switching the included monitor cable( you'd think alienware would include it as well or at least offer it on there website.....regardless luv the thing anywayz ) either way made the trip to &quot;fry's electronics&quot;(las vegas....based in california) was like $60.
switching back n forth.....&quot;seemed&quot; to me that the screen seemed to refresh or &quot;pop&quot; up faster with the dvi cable than wothout.
if indeed using a utility, movies or gaming where it makes the most difference (clairity, refresh) then definately go dvi.if not applicable then save yourself a few bucks.
