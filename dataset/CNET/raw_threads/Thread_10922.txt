I currently have a waveplus wp 1200 802.11b wireless pcmcia card on the laptop. It came with the Quetec connection software(quetec.ca). Unfortunately I believe either the software or hardware is bad, maybe both. The thing connected for a brief few seconds got lost it completely afterwards, the program sometimes can detect wireless networks and says that it connects to them but no browsing or pinging is able. Anybody know of a program that is preferrably free that I can use with my adapter to connect to wireless networks(windows ME)?

Make/model laptop and most important, who installed that OS. Here's why. Most will install the OS but laptop drivers are not something Microsoft will install. 2. If the product is defective. Return it. 3. Try Linux. Use google.com and see if DSL (Damn Small Linux) can use that card. Bob

Quetecs support is nil. Their website doesn't even work. I don't think it works with linux/unix. For compatibility the cards requirements said only windows versions.

Now you can dig around Dell's site for all the drivers. A clean install of the OS and Dell's drivers might fix this. Before all that. Go to some free hotspot and try again. Bob
