i dont see a tv tuner on it.
tough, the box mentions &quot;tv features&quot; on it.
anyways, my video-in drivers are now working fine.
the only thing not is &quot;nvidia wdm tvtuner&quot;.
the problem i have now, is that i cant recieve a full screen video.
i recieve channels, but not full screen.
i use windvd creator.
what other options do i have?
