<s> How come you can't post pixs here? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Really? </s>
<s> I've been to many forums and I run one and never had this problem posting my pixs. </s>
<s> I think c/net is just trying to save on some server/bandwidth. </s>
<s> I know what you are saying, but we showed the exploits and that was enough for the powers that be to hit the disable feature. </s>
<s> The pictures still launch so where's the loss? </s>

<s> The loss? </s>
<s> Well, let's see; 1. </s>
<s> No pixs posted 2. </s>
<s> Not many will click the link. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Only forum I've been to that don't post pixs. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> No responses... no pixs to look at. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Got much more response from other forums where they let you post pixs. </s>
<s> enough, or you want more? </s>
<s> A safe forum or not. </s>
<s> Let's be honest here. </s>
<s> I responded to your second post and not the top post. </s>
<s> It was something I felt you may have wanted to know. </s>
<s> -&gt; Feel free to vent in the Forum Feedback forum but to do so in this discussion promptly derailed what you may have wanted to really talk about. </s>

<s> That site is more what I'm looking for to post the pixs... </s>
<s> However, this begs the question... how come you can post the pixs there and not here? </s>
<s> After this question get answered, go ahead and delete these threads. </s>
<s> No resonse yet and I sent them an email over a week ago. </s>
