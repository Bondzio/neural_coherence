Scanning Newprint is not a positive experience, you must scan it at 300-400DPI usually, but the text on the back can sometimes interfere with the recognition and result in your having to do it manually.
You have to select each column one at a time, after scanning and before the OCR step, in order to get the best output, but as you have noted, newspaper text gets a lot of errors (color of paper and text on other side are main cause) and you have to really proofread it carefully.
You don't want to scan to OCR with photos, you scan the photos separately with different software, and manually select the columns that you want to convert to text.
Don't expect to get good results (with the current state of software) with multiple columns or with tables (columnary data) in something you are scanning, it just doesn't work well.
The scanned photos you want to use need to be placed inside the text and set to flow around it, with Word or your Desktop publishing software.
OCR software just doesn't do this.
Scanning to email is probably best done as a JPG or PDF file if you have Acrobat.
This only requires basic scanning software, not something like Omnipage, and JPG is a smaller file than other text formats.
As long as you make it big enough it should be readable.
