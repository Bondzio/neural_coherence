to temporarily connect the HD directly to an IDE port in your PC.
You will need to set the jumpers properly.
It may well be that the controller in the new enclosure has some different way it accesses the drive.
In this case (and if the drive itself is still good) a reformat might be necessary.
Connect the drive to the PC as above and see if that works.
