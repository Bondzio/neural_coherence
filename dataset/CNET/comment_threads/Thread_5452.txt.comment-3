Yes, the only difference I can think of was that I had an older ATI card before, with its drivers and catalyst.
But even then, I had to install the drivers from the CD.
I tried it again, this time using the ATI driver found on this site, but the same thing happens.
Windows freezes at the same command line.
I just went through some boxes and I found my old ATI, so I'll load it up again and see if I can get those drivers to work.
Would there be any issues if I then try to load the HD2400 again as an upgrade to see if it'll be recognized then?
