<s> I recently acquired a DSL connection and set up a Linksys firewall router to distribute it and function as a network switch for a wired 3 PC network. </s>
<s> The network is peer to peer and all PCs are running Windows XP pro. </s>
<s> Each PC is also running Zone Alarm with antivirus, with the network in the trusted zone. </s>
<s> For some reason, the router is very picky about internet access. </s>
<s> I can get though to google and yahoo and almost no other sites, either using a browser or pinging. </s>
<s> Other than installing a password for access I have not tried any fancy security settings on the router firewall. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how to access the rest of the internet? </s>
<s> What Linksys router model? </s>
<s> Router firmware updated to latest version? </s>
<s> Only one firewall on each computer (is Windows firewall disabled)? </s>
