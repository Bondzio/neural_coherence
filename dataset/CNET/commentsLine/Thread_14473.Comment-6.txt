i think choice is a good thing, r. proffitt.
but the prices didnt change.
sure you get more, but its because of technological advancements.
i think if you dont want it the macbook should start at 1079 so you dont waste your money.
but whatever.
o and yes the mbp need new keyboards.
i think it be nice if the macbook had illuminated keys, but the mbp is the only mac that doesnt use the new keyboard.
