1.1.1	I have an eMachines C2825 with 250-watt ATX power unit.	St
1.1.2	My computer shut down unexpectedly and I caught a whiff of something that smelled like over-heated electrical insulation coming from the power unit.	St
1.1.3	The fan was running OK, and I have since restarted the computer and there seems to be no problem.	St
1.1.4	I looked at the other component and everything else seems to be fine ... CPU, hard drive, etc.	St
1.1.5	That olfactory warning was enough for me!	St
1.1.6	I am going to replace the power unit.	St
1.1.7	I don't want to take any chances.	St
1.1.8	My only question now is about installation.	St
1.1.9	If it is a simple plug-and-go kind of job then I'll tackle it myself.	St
1.1.10	If there is a chance I could really screw things up, then I'd rather pay someone else to do it who knows what they're doing.	St
1.1.11	Should I tackle it myself?	St
1.1.12	If so, should I stick with a 250-max or go higher?	St
1.1.13	What brand gives me the best bang for the buck?	Polite
1.1.14	What should I be watching out for?	St
1.1.15	Any special tricks to installation?	Polite
1.1.16	Thanks for your interest and help.	St
1.2.1	...is a simple affair really, and takes about 10 minutes...routing the cables around neatly to help airflow actually takes far longer!	St
1.2.2	Basically a Power Supply Unti (PSU) is a big metal box (which may or may not fit in your system case : huge problem #1) with a lot of power leads and molex plugs.	St
1.2.3	As long as you plug each device and drive into a molex connector (make sure you buy a PSU with enough plugs : small problem #2), the only thing remaining is to plug the motherboard in.	St
1.2.4	This last step can can be a little problematic (danger Will Robinson DANGER!!!)	St
1.2.5	because modern PSU's actually have a few motherboard power plugs.	St
1.2.6	Often there'll be a secondary small 4 pin block.	St
1.2.7	Some people don't notice this or forget to plug that in if it's required by the motherboard, and the system won't power up without that (possible problem #3).	St
1.2.8	It might be that your motherboard won't need the 4pin one at all too, or may require the use of both aligned into a single larger block.	St
1.2.9	Be careful with this, and look at your old motherboard / PSU connector to make sure the new one is going in with that same wire colour positions etc.	Sug
1.2.10	Get that wrong and you can easily fry a working motherboard.	St
1.2.11	Speaking of frying.	St
1.2.12	The burning smell might not even be the PSU at all, as it's fan will expel smells from anywhere inside a computer.	St
1.2.13	You can unplug it from all the drives and motherboard and test it ( very carefully ) like this : http://modtown.co.uk/mt/article2.php?id=psumod If it powers up, with no burning smell (cough cough) something else in your PC may be a bit crispy.	St
1.2.14	Good luck, GeeBee.	St
