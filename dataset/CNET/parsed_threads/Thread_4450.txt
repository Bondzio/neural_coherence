<s> I have an HP Pavilion dv9000 laptop where my wireless card stopped working. </s>
<s> I was able to get it back working using Linksys Easylink Advisor software and power-cycling my Linksys router. </s>
<s> Anyways I am curious has to ideas about what caused it to temporarily stop working. </s>
<s> I have heard stories about HP laptops' wireless cards failing permanently(this model has known overheating issues particularly with its motherboard). </s>
<s> I really want to do anything I can do to prevent that. </s>
<s> I use a laptop fan and I wonder if I should unscrew the back of the laptop to try to clean out dust near the wireless card. </s>
<s> Or are the wireless cards not really affected by heat issues? </s>
<s> Or could it be something completely different that caused this? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> When this happens, do you get some sort of hardware error message or failure shown in device manager? </s>
<s> The reason I ask is that, with wireless connections, other factors are involved. </s>
<s> These can be your router or another persons nearby as well as other forms of RF. </s>
<s> Can you verify it's your own wireless card? </s>
<s> As for cooling, it's well known that laptops need cleaning and it's not always as easy to do as desktops. </s>
<s> Minimally you clean the fan and exhaust path using compressed air. </s>
<s> If you find it very dusty, you disassemble and clean what you are comfortable doing. </s>
<s> That's what happens occasionally with all machines. </s>
<s> But what I'm encountering today are people that think the machines should be flawless. </s>
<s> We're not there yet. </s>
<s> As to what causes this is simple. </s>
<s> There is some bug, glitch or such in the driver, OS or system. </s>
<s> This will not be the last time you encounter such glitches. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hmmm that's a good point. </s>
<s> Before I power-cycled my router I did check the wireless card in device manager and it said &quot;device is working properly&quot;. </s>
<s> So I guess it was a problem with my router? </s>
<s> I found it interesting that when I right-clicked on the wireless icon in the taskbar and selected &quot;diagnose&quot; that it reset the wireless card settings but that this didn't fix the problem. </s>
<s> In the past when this has happened, doing that has fixed the problem. </s>
<s> I'm using Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> I'm still thinking of trying to clean the wireless card area; is it as simple as unscrewing the panel beneath the wireless card and spraying canned air? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply, I'll keep that in mind. </s>
