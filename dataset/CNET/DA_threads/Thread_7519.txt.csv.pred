1.1.1	I was given this PC, but when I start it up it looks as if everything is well until it stops at a Black screened menu with white words.	St
1.1.2	The 'System Configuration' Menu.	St
1.1.3	It comes to the point where it says &quot;Building DMI Pool......Success&quot; and nothing happens after that it just stays in that menu.	St
1.1.4	Can anyone help me get past this menu and actually load up the OS?	St
1.1.5	Wich by the way is Windows XP Pro.	St
1.2.1	Usually a sign of some trouble on the IDE channels.	St
1.2.2	Bad drive or bad CD/DVD drive.	St

1.3.5	I sometimes just re-install the DRIVERS..and leave it at that.. .. You also don't want DUPLICATE Project Software..like ROXIO and NERO on the same machine.. ..	St
1.3.6	Sometimes a Salesman might sell you something your machine won't SUPPORT/its advisible to know your Original Configuration.. .. Celeron D is not real good w/DVD-burning..but adeguate w/Audio on CD.. .. NTFS File Systems are best over the FAT32..for System Drives.. and are a must for Video Creation(7200-rpm).. ..	St
1.3.7	The START-MENU/ Click the PROPERTIES/ I only use 3-ICONS in the Start Menu.. and I Un-Check the BOX-recently OPENED Documents.. ........and CLEAR the LIST........regularily.. .. Defragmentor Program/ gives a good IMAGE of the HDD's that your Useing.. .. That GREEN Stip is your Page File..	St
1.3.8	I only use a Page File in the (C:)Drive and never exceed 800-MB's.. My HD will show a GREEN Strip at the Left side of the Visual for Disk Defragmentor/and if I corrupt my OS..this will split into two-strips..two Green Strips means its time to re-Install the OS.. .. That's the simple side.	St
