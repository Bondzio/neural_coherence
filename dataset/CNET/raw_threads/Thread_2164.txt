I installed Norton 360 and soon after that little things started to happen. Finally, the computer started to reboot at what seemed random times. I had the computer checked out by a 'professional' who was only able to slightly improve the computer's performance. He took out Norton 360 claiming that it was damaging some parts of the operating system, Windows XP Entertainment Edition. I really don't want to reinstall the operating system, as I have installed some free software that is no longer available. Lately, when I try to turn off the computer via 'RUN etc', the computer reboots. I have to resort to turning off the computer via front panel switch. I use the computer for work and don't really want to have much down time. Any help I can get in this regard will be most appreciated. Thank you

That's what I do now since it boots faster in the morning and the power is off so to me there is no downside and plenty of upside. Good luck, Bob PS. I'm not a good person to talk to about Norton. I too only see it's dark side.

This moring I came in and found the computer was on, HIBERNATING(?). I know I turned it off with the front panel button whem I last used it. The computer came right up wituout the long powerup wait. Ralph.
