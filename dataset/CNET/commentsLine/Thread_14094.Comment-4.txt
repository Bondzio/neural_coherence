i know an issue and have fixed dozens of them.
i refuse to enter into yet another discussion about fixing the internal wifi card or if it's a driver.
please forgive me as that discussion has been done too many times.
here's the card i'm using to overcome this issue -&gt; wpnt511 or wpc54g.
you can read all the banter about this at  again, sorry if i don't want to go over this again.
it's become a well known issue.
i hope you see what's up and understand why i'm just popping in 20 buck cards now.
