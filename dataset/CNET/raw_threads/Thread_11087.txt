After I add the new SATA to my PC will there be any compatibility issues between the two disks? Any booting delays etc? Can anyone shed some light on this??? My motherboard supports both SATA and PATA HDD's, Intel D101GGc is the model.

Sadly what I did doesn't apply to all other PCs. There is or was not compatibility issue but there definitely is a issue with how well they document this. Bob

As Bob said adding a hdd and adding & changing it for boot drive, is not the same thing.
