<s> My question: Is there such a thing as a DSL signal booster? </s>
<s> If so, can you read my &quot;blurb&quot; below to see if you would recommend one? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> I am a teacher in a small Christian elementary school. </s>
<s> We have a computer lab with 19 desktop computers. </s>
<s> They are all networked (wired) to a router going into the only DSL outlet in the room. </s>
<s> At times, the computers on the other side of the room have low connectivity. </s>
<s> (Those 9 are hooked to a hub, and that one cord goes across the ceiling to the main router.) </s>
<s> Besides that one hub Ethernet cord, there are 10 other individual computer cords plugged into the router. </s>
<s> We are a new school in a fairly large, older church. </s>
<s> I am certain that when the DSL lines were run for the church that they did not anticipate there being over 35 new school computers hooking into the signal. </s>
<s> It seems overloaded to me, but that's just my opinion. </s>
<s> Is there anything like a DSL signal booster that I can put between my wall jack and router? </s>
<s> If so, where would I find such a thing? </s>
<s> I appreciate any advice you can give! </s>
<s> for a switch. </s>
<s> It's more efficient and may solve some speed problems (although you did not note where the speed hit occured, Internet or Intranet). </s>
<s> Some reading: http://www.stanford.edu/group/networking/lnaguide/docs/hubs-vs-switches.html </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion. </s>
<s> I actually have 2 Linksys 16 port workgroup switches in the lab. </s>
<s> One is at the only DSL wall jack in the room. </s>
<s> There are 7 computers hooked to that switch and one long cord coming from the switch on the other side of the room. </s>
<s> On that side of the room there are 12 computers hooked into that switch. </s>
<s> It is this side of the room that seems to have a slower connection at times. </s>
<s> I spoke with our building maintenance last night, and they told me that they can run another DSL line to my classroom. </s>
<s> That way I could split the number of computers on one jack. </s>
<s> This would create another split at one of the main DSL boxes, but it would keep no more than 10 computers plugged into one switch in my lab. </s>
<s> I guess it would also get rid of the &quot;daisy chain&quot; effect with a switch wired into another switch. </s>
<s> It will probably be just a trial and error setup. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the suggestion. </s>
<s> I welcome anyone else's thoughts as well. </s>
