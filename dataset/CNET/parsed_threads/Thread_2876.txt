<s> So, shipping my computer had some unexpected side effects, one of which is my CD-RW drive seems to be broken.. </s>
<s> If I go into -any- program to burn a music or data CD or copy one.. it seems like it's working.. </s>
<s> In fact, it 'completes' it and the CD pops out after it's 'done' but.. the CD is always empty but cannot be reused. </s>
<s> I've tried with different CD types to no avail. </s>
<s> The hardware is hooked up, and registers as working right. </s>
<s> No new drivers or anything sooo... </s>
<s> I'm pretty much screwed with that one, right? </s>
<s> I'm okay with that as my other CD drive works and I don't use the R a whole lot. </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind upgraded to a DVD drive anyway - I guess it would be a DVD writer so I'd still have the CD writing capabilities. </s>
<s> I don't imagine this should be too hard. </s>
<s> How do I find out if my motherboard can handle that? </s>
<s> And what's compatible with my system? </s>
<s> And finally, what's recommended? </s>
<s> I've never had a DVD drive and so I totally have not caught up with the technology. </s>
<s> You gave no mention of your system specs/details. </s>
<s> On this matter a replacement DVD in lieu of the CD drive will be OK. Just drop it in and set the jumpers, ect. </s>
<s> to your needs. </s>
<s> Most retail boxed DVD drive will have the help guide and any r/w software required. </s>
<s> Beware, the DVD may not be seen as a DVD and the s/w is important as if XP based system won't follow the easy drop to disk writing, you'll need that provided s/w. </s>
<s> As for brands I suggest the HP, LG, or Lite-on and maybe Sony. </s>
<s> If you desire &quot;lightscribe&quot; option that's up to you. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> As for specs, right now I've 768Megs RAM, 20 free Gigs of space and, according to HP my motherboard is ASUS A7N8X-LA. </s>
<s> It seems I wasn't quite as in the dark as I thought I was - simply took some looking up of the new terminology - like Light Scribe which seems pretty dandy. </s>
<s> I'm seeing things about IDE/EIDE/SATA which seem to be the connection/cable type. </s>
<s> Is there a certain type I would only be able to use? </s>
<s> My current drives use IDE (which, according to some is really EIDE?) </s>
<s> but would I be able to use SATA or EIDE if I found a writer I liked better with those options? </s>
<s> The ones I am looking at right now are Lite-ON, HP, LG or Asus. </s>
<s> I've been checking out reviews from a certain competitor site. </s>
<s> The pricing is actually much more reasonable than I expected! </s>
<s> I'm not entirely sure by what you mean with 'set the jumpers.' </s>
<s> Jumpers, those are small plug thingees that need to set. </s>
<s> This tells the system either master/slave -OR- CS setting for use on the cable. </s>
<s> Once, you remove the old CD, review the decal/sticker and see what its set as. </s>
<s> You can use that to help set the new drive. </s>
<s> For most, you probably have an EIDE type CD drive, thus a new EIDE is required, also known as a PATA vs SATA type. </s>
<s> As for a brand pick one, if you've a HP system, then keep it in the family or not, pick one of the others. </s>
<s> It really doesn't matter in the long run. </s>
<s> adios -----Willy </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827129018 It doesn't have lightscribe but it's getting great reviews from buyers. </s>
<s> Might want to check out lightscribe before you get to set on it... it might require more than it's worth. </s>
<s> You should probably get an IDE CD-DVD drive if your MB is the ASUS A7N8X MB....the A7N8X-LA is an ASUS MB made for HP we need more info about the HP model number and series to assist further. </s>
<s> Happy Computing VAPCMD </s>
