<s> Hello, I just bought an external hard and plan to reformat it to NTFS. </s>
<s> I have a PC with Windows 2000 and a laptop with XP Pro that I will use it with. </s>
<s> I will also take it over to a friend's house to transfer some music from his collection. </s>
<s> I believe that his external hard drive is formatted to FAT32. </s>
<s> Might be an ignorant question, but will I be able to take files off of his FAT32 formatted external hard drive and transfer them to my NTFS formatted drive? </s>
<s> In addition, if he has data stored on his Windows ME pc that I want, I am assuming that I cannot take it since my drive is NTFS? </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help. </s>
<s> But more to the point, for USB file system support your Windows 2000 works fine with FAT32 and NTFS. </s>
<s> Windows ME will only support FAT32 (and the other FATs). </s>

<s> Ok, I understand. </s>
<s> So no issue with getting the files from his FAT external drive but I won't be able to plug into his ME pc, right? </s>
<s> Can I plug my NTFS drive into Windows ME? </s>
<s> Sure, but it won't be recognised. </s>
<s> For that direction of transfer use some FAT32 volume. </s>
<s> PLEASE EJECT SAID DRIVES PROPER since FAT32 drives are well known to corrupt or vanish if we lose power or pull the plug. </s>

<s> What I meant! </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
