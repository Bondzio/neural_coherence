<s> I need some ideas, I've built a new system with an MSI 945 neo5-f mobo, Pentium d 820 processor, 4G of Kingston pc5300 ram, 2 WD 160G sata hd, Nvidia 8600GT and a new 500wt power supply. </s>
<s> When I try to boot up and load the operating system it shuts it down when I try to save the bios settings. </s>
<s> All the components listed except the processor and video card are new. </s>
<s> The only thing I did in the bios was to change the boot order. </s>
<s> Is this mobo defective? </s>
<s> Any ideas would be welcome. </s>
<s> You say you load the OS. </s>
<s> Is this OS a transplant from another machine? </s>
<s> I turned it on went into the bios to check that it had the right boot sequence then after it asks me if I want to save the settings it shuts off as soon as I hit enter. </s>
<s> That I will be installing a new copy of Vista if I can get it to load. </s>
<s> Check one thing. </s>
<s> Is your CPU on the support list for the version BIOS that is in the machine. </s>
<s> Checking the next thing -&gt; You don't need ANY hard disks or CD/DVD drives to save the BIOS settings. </s>
<s> Also, reveal what BIOS settings you are changing since one poorer (went to the shop counter) soul was OVERCLOCKING and couldn't understand why his system would reboot on a BIOS save never to show a screen until the BIOS settings were reset with a jumper. </s>
<s> Expensive lesson about overclocking. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It recognized all the hardware which is what threw me initially. </s>
<s> I think I found the problem, I was able to view the hardware monitor and the cpu temps were in the high 80's and going up. </s>
<s> So it looks like the MB is defective and a replacement is in order.Thanks for the suggestions Rob, you always seem to have a good answer and I appreciate that. </s>
<s> properly ... loose perhaps ? </s>
<s> No thermal paste or pad ? </s>
<s> Check it out...that's not a MB defect. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I think I'll try that before a new board, thanks. </s>
<s> you're running stock CPU setting the standard heatsink should be OK ...but only if it's making full contact with the CPU heat spreader. </s>
<s> Sometimes the heatsink locks pop loose and without full contact ...the CPU heat rises rapdily. </s>
<s> Best to checj that first VAPCMD </s>
<s> On the stock heatsink/fan a couple of the tabs seem to behaving a problem, they snap in but won't stay so it looks like I'll need a new one anyway, this one has a little mileage on it. </s>
<s> over at http://www.FrostyTech.com....they 've go great info about the HS fans especially thermal transfer and noise. </s>
<s> From there ...you can go to your favorite source, buy it and install it. </s>
<s> Take a look at those made by Xigmatek ....they've got some decent HS Fans at reasonable prices ... but it's good to get the bracket kit to avoid the mounting problem. </s>
<s> Keep us posted. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You guys and gale are top shelf! </s>
<s> It turns out the heatsink/fan was the culprit. </s>
<s> Installed a new one and she fired right up. </s>
<s> You saved me a great deal of hunting and I appreciate it. </s>
<s> Cheers!! </s>
