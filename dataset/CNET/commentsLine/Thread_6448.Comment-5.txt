as most systems have only one hdd....sometimes split or partitioned into two or more logical drives.
but if you're sure there are 2 separate physical drives mounted internally...the options are to replace the smaller hdd and image the smaller hdd to it.
or you could image the smaller drive (c) to the larger drive and use the 1.8tb hdd as your internal hdd.
personally i like the idea of two internal hdds as i use the 2nd hdd solely as a backup to the 1st hdd.
with a second drive mounted internally, backups and restores are quick and easy.
external hdds are ok but usually less reliable as you can see from reading in this forum.
