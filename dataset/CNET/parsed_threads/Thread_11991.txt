<s> i was wondering if the following was good for a basically mild gaming, then some multitasking. </s>
<s> and if everything was compatable, etc. </s>
<s> thanks in advance...the parts are listed below Case - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144151 Motherboard - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131569 CPU - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103531 Power supply - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817174023 CPU cooler - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118223 Hard Drive - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148103 Graphics card - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?item=N82E16814130071 </s>
<s> You're forgetting the memory. </s>
<s> BTW, that's not what i would consider a budget pc with a 8800gts. </s>
<s> You might want to get the socket am2 instead of socket 939. </s>
<s> i really wouldnt call getting a 8800gt a &quot;mild&quot; gaming pc because that GPU is for people that like gaming and are preparing for directx10 hope this helps </s>
<s> if you are doing mild gaming, you don't need that nice a graphics card. </s>
<s> infact, you would be fine with agp or maybe even integrated graphics. </s>
<s> a pny vetro 6600 (not gt) 256 agp card will do fine. </s>
<s> I have one in an older computer and it can run halo, counterstrike, ect, and unless your playing batlefield 2 or something you'll be fine. </s>
<s> This will also save you some $ on the motherboard, but good call on the asus. </s>
<s> stay with that brand. </s>
<s> KEY part missing. </s>
<s> ram. </s>
<s> get 1 gig of fairly fast ram and you should be fine. </s>
<s> and finaly you don't need a 3800+ proccessor. </s>
<s> a 3200+ will suit your needs perfectly. </s>
<s> trust me. </s>
<s> i have tested many products, and you'll be fine with these. </s>
