I've been a PC user for many many years and I've just decided to gradually cross over to Macs. I bought an iBook off of ebay and I have a problem with it. It's an iBook G3. It had a previous owner and the person who sold it to me told me that I would have to get a new operating system. The previous owner had a password set up and I cant get into anything to delete the programs and few old files. I tried contacting the person who sold it to me on ebay but his account is now longer active. The computer is in good working condition because I can sign on as a guest but not an administrator. Could someone help me figure out how to solve this problem? I would greatly appreciate it. I dont know how to format the hard drive or i don't even know if i need to. I really don't want to buy a new hard drive because I've heard it's extremely hard to change a mac hard drive. Thanks so much.
