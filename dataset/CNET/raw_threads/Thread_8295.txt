Both connect to the internet (desktop via a lan cable and the lappy wirelessly). Having run the WinXp network wizard a couple of times has not corrected my problem. When using the Desktop, I can see all the shared folders on both computers and more importantly I can use the files in those folders. When using the lappy, I can see all the shared folders but whenever I try to open a folder it hangs. Windoze tells me that it's not responding. So I ran a little experiment to see if this was a wireless issue and hooked the lappy up to the router with a lan cable and ran the wizard again. Same result. Also I can not print via the network (the printer is hooked up to the desktop via USB), I can print from the desktop no problem but not from the lappy Equipment being used; Liksys G wireless router Rogers cable modem Desktop - AthlonXp 2500+, 1gb of ram, 280gb of HD space Lappy - Acer 5024 - AMD 64 ML34 1gb of ram, 100gb HD Both have file sharing turned on, nothing different was done on the lappy from the desktop. Why can I only access files one way but not the other, and how do I fix this. Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Mark

What firewall does the desktop have running? Try connecting to the desktop with the desktop firewall turned OFF. Does it work?

As for turning the firewall off and on to network my desktop (in the basement) and the laptop (upstairs) is not only inconvenient to do each and every time I want to share files, but counterproductive to the firewall itself I think. So to answer your questions, no, I haven't tried that yet, but just out of curiosity I will. I did read another discussion about something similar, computer1 could see the shared folders on computer2 but not vice versa. I can see them on both but can only actually access the lappy from the desktop. The laptop is new (bought about 2 months ago) and I did have to use the recovery disk that came with it once, right at the begining when I had issues with NAV05. I could see some of the networking settings being lost but like I said, I can see the files just not access them. &quot;My network places&quot; window stops responding for a min or so, then without actually opening up the folder I clicked on, it begins to respond again, where I am free to click on a shared folder again only to have it freeze again.

I have also deleted all the printers I could see that the laptop has. Adding a printer and allowing windows to search the network for a printer has fixed this problem (for the time being), I am now able to print from the lappy via the network. Also, I ran the wireless networking wizard on both puters (I used an SD card to transfer all the settings as I don't have a floppy on the lapptop nor do I have a memory stick), this seems to work fine. One thing I was not able to do is to connect the SD card to the Router, which it seems to suggest in the instructions. I then ran the &quot;network setup wizard&quot; also on both computers as instructed by the &quot;help&quot; feature in WinXp. All that seems to have worked well and I have selected print and file sharing under the windows firewall settings. But now instead of hanging like before, I get a new messg. when I attempting to access the shared folders from either the desktop or the laptop; &quot;X folder is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. Not enough server storage is available to process this comand&quot;. Any help at all would be appreciated.
