i switched it to cable select.
there is two different diagrams on the back of the hard drive though.
one for 15 head and one for 16. either way it has 9 pins on the back.
i'm not sure what an 80 conductor is but i'm using the cable that came with the mobo.
one also came with the hard drive.
i could switch those two around if it would help?
the one with the hard drive is a flat ribbon cable while the one that came with the mobo is round.
