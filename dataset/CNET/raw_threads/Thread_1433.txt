I've accomplished a wireless setup on 5 machines, but that's about the extent of my hands on experience. I would like to network three machines for file sharing. They all access the same T-1 line. 2 machines running windows 98se. 1 machine running XP Home. I would like for the xp machine to be the host. I've read about different methods for setting this up. Frankly, it's a little confusing to a novice. I would like to hear from those of you who have experience with T-1 line network setup. Also, what, if any, hardware is needed? (router, switch, etc.) Thanks for any suggestions. Ernie

I set up the network using the netbuie protocol with printer & file sharing. The xp machine required a different configuration and the extracting of some files from the xp cd, but it all came together and works great.

Do all the computers need to be on wireless g to share the printer? I wireless b capable of printer sharing? Thought you might be able to help.

If the printer is connected to a PC (versus a print server port on the router/switch), you may need to be sure that each user has an account to which the printer is connected. I used to have a router/switch with a printer port on it which meant any PC on the network could print to it at any time. I replaced the printer and my new one only connects by USB to the PC. I had to replace the R/S, and now the main PC has to be on for the others to be able to print.
