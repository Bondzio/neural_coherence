http://sellout.woot.com/offers/philips-wireless-hd-net-connect-8 I picked this up since I could pop that in, power the transmitter with USB.
All the reviews are tainted with folk that, well I apologize, are expecting more than the product can deliver.
That is I see folk read &quot;good for 20 feet&quot; then they stick a wall and hope it will go 40 feet.
That will result in a bad review.
I'm guessing here you want that iPad screen over WiFi solution.
Maybe that's out there.
