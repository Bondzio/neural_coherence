if you some aptitude build your own system,the latest release hardware does not appear to be the best performing in a lot of cases,it seems to be a pattern that the best setup for a motherboard does not become widely known or available until it is nearly obsolete,e.g.
amd k6 3+ cpu's on a socket 7 platform that outperform a majority of pentium 3 based systems and tualatin core p3 cpu's,which are basically a p4 (i'd rather run a pc on a p3 1400/512/133 than any p4 pentium or celeron under 2500).if you are looking at going to a p4 or the equivalent amd there are some boards out there (asrock)that support both the older and more recent socket types so you can start with an older 478 p4 and upgrade to a 775 package later.make sure you get a board that is compatable with as many currently available cpu's as possible,and hyperthreading support is a must.with regards to cpu's in the case of intel at least i am concerned to see a majority of benchmark results show a negligable performance increase resulting from doubling or even quadrupling the l2 cache( i suspect that 512k is optimal on the curve of size vs performance),in fact my research indicates older socket 478 cpu's perform just as well and in some cases marginally better than the new 775 cpu's with 2 and 4 times the l2 cache and more supported technologies,this is reflected in price (check web retailers prices for new 478 and 775 prices for equivalent speed cpu's).currently not having any dual core cpu's to play with (retailers wishing to send me one for testing are welcome,ha,ha) i can't really say too much about them,maybe they will overcome some of the issues with cache performance,maybe not.when looking at upgrading or buying new remember 'cpu':compatability,price,upgradability.
