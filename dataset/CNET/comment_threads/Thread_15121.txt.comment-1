Basics of home network: FIOS with Vista desktop connected to router via ethernet cable,xp laptop and Lexmark S605 printer communicate wirelessly with router.Everything worked flawlessly until last weekend.
The old Dlink G router died on Sunday after 5yrs so I ran to Staples and bought a Cisco/Linksys E1000 'N' router.I got everything back up and running with no problems.To rejoin the S605 to the network,I went into it's wireless network settings and entered the router's ssid and p/word.I printed from both the desktop and laptop,everything worked and the network was happy!
Fast forward one week:I'm on the verge of taking my Mossberg 500 and using the printer for target practice.
Printing from either desktop/laptop gives communication errors(neither one sees the printer over the network).I can use the printer only if I connect it to the desktop via usb.
Things tried: Reset printer to factory defaults.
Delete all traces of anything Lexmark and reinstall software on both computers.
Result:the printer can see the router and I can add it to the network through the printer's settings but neither computer can see the printer?
I realize I have to create a new printer port on the desktop but I can't,entering the printer's ip addy get's 0 results.
