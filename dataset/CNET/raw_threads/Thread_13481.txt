I want to add one more stick to it. On Newegg there is a wide variety of memory. Is there much of a difference in memory and is there a certain manufacturer that I should be looking for? Thanks............ Tom

Like Ray indicates, you should not have any problems, provided you get right specs for what is recommended for your PC. I purchased Crucial and Kingston RAM from Circuit City and Best Buy, also some mail order with Crucial without any problems on my computers, and for installation on others.
