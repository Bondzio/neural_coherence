Microsoft Windows Xp Version 2002 Service Pack 3 Dell DIM3000 I've tried to uninstall both and restarted.
Nothing happened Disk drive D always saids please install disk.
It does not read the disk is in there.
Disk drive E does not open.
I've tried using a paper clip and restart computer.
I've tried to update with windows and nothing happened again.
What can I do to fix this?
