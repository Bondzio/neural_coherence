1.1.1	I just bought Pinnacle PCTV USB 2.0 55e/150e .	St
1.1.2	I actually bought it for my laptop which is running Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit .	St
1.1.3	The drivers which came with the package contain windows XP drivers only .	St
1.1.4	So I tried it on my Desktop which is runs Windows XP Professional SP2 .	St
1.1.5	But still I had problems .	St
1.1.6	I installed the software as indicated in the quick start guide .	St
1.1.7	After the Pinnacle Media Center 4.0 was installed I restarted my computer and tried to scan for channels .	St
1.1.8	( I used my Cable TV cord for input ) .	St
1.1.9	But it always scanned and found no channels ( this same Cable TV works well with my TV ) .	St
1.1.10	Then when I tried to access TV from the Media Center there came an error message : No TV Device found .	St
1.1.11	I reconnected and checked all the connections .	St
1.1.12	Everything was Ok. Then I searched for drivers online the ones I got on were on the Pinnacle Windows Vista Pledge .	St
1.1.13	They said to download Pinnacle Media Center patch 4.7 .	St
1.1.14	But the size of the file is 251 MB .	St
1.1.15	I use a slow dial-up connection .	St
1.1.16	It will take me 15 to 20 hours downloading such a file even while using a download manager .	St
1.1.17	I need help with this .	St
1.1.18	Is there any way I can download only the drivers without the Pinnacle Media Center ?	Ques
1.1.19	So that I can use my TV Tuner Device with Windows Media Center ( on Windows Vista ) .	St
1.1.20	This will reduce the file size I will have to download and also I 'm not very comfortable with Pinnacle Media Center , as I am with Windows Media Center .	St
1.1.21	Also is there any way I can do the same with my desktop ( Windows XP ) which does not have a Windows Media Center even .	Ques
1.1.22	Thank you in advance .	St
1.1.23	Its very frustrating that I cant use my device .	St
1.2.1	& quot ; So that I can use my TV Tuner Device with Windows Media Center & quot ; Only Pinnacle can do this .	St
1.2.2	I see they have some player software up for Vista but it 's unclear if they integrate it with WMC .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Beleieve me , I understand the dail-up issue for large files .	St
1.3.2	When I need such large files , I use a friend 's or co. system to d/l and burn to CD or flash drive and take home .	St
1.3.3	Its frustating , but I found no other way .	St
1.3.4	As for the required Vista drivers or s/w , then only the maker/vendor can supply that .	St
1.3.5	Pinnacle is definetly your only source , so query them or see what they have .	St
1.3.6	Since , you 've been there you know what 's & quot ; currently & quot ; available .	St
1.3.7	Again , query them , but the box/manual should explain what the product does and I 'm sure it did n't have & quot ; Vista & quot ; logo supported as well .	St
1.3.8	If you can , return the item ASAP for full refund before that causes a problem if nothing works .	St
1.4.1	Last Friday I bought a Pinnacle PCTV Hybrid Tuner Kit for Windows Vista ...	St
1.4.2	The box says & quot ; Experience the full power of Windows Media Center & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	I have installed the PCTV installer for Windows Media Center version 3.1 from the included Pinnacle cdrom and also checked for recent Pinnacle drivers but this is the latest version available .	St
1.4.4	But Windows MCE does not recognize this USB stick at all ! ! !	St
1.4.5	However the PCTV driver is available in Vista device manager and a freeware tool ( free for 30 days ) can use the PCTV USB stick for watching TV and also the A/V input works with my digital Sony camera .	St
1.4.6	I am running everything on a brand new ACER laptop AMD Turion 64 X2 Mobile Technology TL-60 with 2048 MB of RAM and have all Vista updates installed since yesterday .	St
1.4.7	Because there is no TV application included I am really disappointed with this Pinnacle package .	St
1.4.8	By the way it has the & quot ; certified for Windows Vista & quot ; logo on the box , what a shame ! ! !	St
1.4.9	So I need help with this very urgent because I can return the package to the shop and receive a refund within 8 days .	St
1.4.10	Is there anybody who has already a working combination of a Pinnacle PCTV card/USB with Windows Media Center in Vista ?	Ques
1.4.11	Thanks	Polite
1.5.1	There are 5 versions so which do you have ?	Ques
1.6.1	Vista Home Premium Vista Version:6.0.6000.16551 ( vista_gdr.070828-1515 ) with Windows Media Center technologies	St
1.7.1	& quot ; watch , TimeShift and record your favourite TV content in Windows Media Center. & quot ; Since they claim they use WMC then there may be no standalone TV App .	St
1.7.2	But reading http : //www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/uk/Products/Consumer+Products/PCTV+Tuners/landing_page_pctv_tuner_kit_for_vista.htm it appears to me that some IR BLASTER is needed too .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	Seriously I did , on a new system with Vista Ultimate , new tuners , cable cards inserted .	St
1.8.2	About 30 calls to Sony .	St
1.8.3	HDTV on a PC with TV tuners simply does not work .	St
1.9.1	But this discussion is about PINNACLE and not the fiasco about cable cards and HDTV .	St
