you mentioned that f.e.a.r.
doesn't support eax 3. that's odd because sierra's game page says different: recommended specifications: sound blaster x-fi series sound card  far cry's recommended sound card: sound blaster audigy series  i could go on but the bottom line is you're wrong.
eax 2.0 is *minimum spec* and many games support the higher eax levels.
go to an enthusiast site like hothardware.com or hardocp.com or anandtech.com and visit their forums.
you'll see that real gamers who want the best hardware always choose creative cards.
and the x-fi gamer does perform just as well as the other x-fi line.
the xram feature is only used by 1 or 2 games and is primarily useful for audio apps (like sound forge).
