I just looked at a friends V2-Premier because the fan on the power supply wasn't working.
What I found was a &quot;250W&quot; power supply for a P4 2.8 processor CDRW,DVD,Card Reader, etc.
The box also had problems powering up.... Had to push the on button serveral times and cross fingers to get it to turn on.
When I replaced the power supply fan that apparently put it over the top!
Once powered on it would make it to the XP Logo Screen and then power itself back off.
I replaced the power supply with a larger 500w (don't need one that big but I had one on the shelf) and both the booting and power switch problems disappeared.
Looks to me like a box sold with bells and whistles but skimpy/cheap components inside.
Reminded me of an eMachine I worked on once.....
