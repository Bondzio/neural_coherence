I have tried the Phone tech support site but it is always busy. I have all the necessary equipment Router/modem, & a fixed IP address. Or failing that, an online webpage with graphical instructions. I have the manual, but i am still struggling. Thanks for any help you can give..

Proffitt	11/26/10 1:01 PM	1.29077646E12	To fix this	We have to have a firm grasp of networking but without that I can offer only a few suggestions (covering networking is something too large to cover in forums.) 1. Put the recorder on your router into the router's DMZ. This is not going to be explained much further because networking is a rather deep subject. If you can't find the DMZ, please obtain on site support. 2. I want to comment about the fixed IP address. Given DDNS capabilities why would I pay for a fixed IP? Bob

Please provide the following details: 1 Routers model number 2 Cameras model number - you have provided the recorders model number, which is enough under certain circumstances. 3 I require these so that I can let you set up the router for port forwarding which will allow you to access the camera from a remote location. Take care, Navneet.
