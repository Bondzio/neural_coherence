Well seeing as how I'm a tech and small computer business owner my tendancy, especially in U.S. dollars (I'm Canadian) would be to say that you could get yourself a kick @ss gaming system for that kind of dough, with a 8ms response time monitor.
A word of caution, going with anything larger than 19&quot; in an LCD with a decent reponse time (12ms or under, preferably 8ms) is going to cost you dearly.
AS for the system, if you're adventurous and want to put it together yourself, a high end gaming system with AMD processor and dual SLI Nividia video cards could be in your future.
Good luck.
