When I read &quot;and I have it set to the SPD settings in BIOS&quot; I thought you were entering in the timing.
Yes, it sounds a notch too low according to what I read.
Try this.
Head to the BIOS and enter the slowest settings for the ram possible.
I don't hold much hope for that but all the above points to some odd BIOS+CPU issue.
XP does fine on quad core machines here and has for years.
While I've lost count of how many I installed, the HP d4999t and d5000 we have at home ran XP without such loopiness.
Now they run 7 64 bit.
