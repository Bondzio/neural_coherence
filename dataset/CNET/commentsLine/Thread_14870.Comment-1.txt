howdy, my computer has begun to run very slowly and i just recieved a warning that the vitrual memory is low.
i am trying to figure out how to remedy this.
first let me tell you what i have done to the computer.
i added a plug and play cd rom and storage device.i also have a slave drive running the computer.
i use the plugin device for downloading, but run the programs from the c drive.
besides that i have basic windows and microsoft word stuff and two video games.
any good place to start?
what are my virus or otherwise potential?
oh,i have a gateway that is about two years old and run windows xp thank you much steve
