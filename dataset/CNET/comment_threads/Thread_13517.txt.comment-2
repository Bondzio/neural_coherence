Also, testing this is a nightmare.
To change the settings on any of the devices I have to physically be there, but for testing I have to go outside of my network, which essentially requires me to drive to some place that has wifi.
and then back if I need to change something on a device, and then out again to test it....
Does anybody know of a better way to test this?
Finally, is there a log file somewhere on my laptop or the server that I could inspect for more clues about this problem?
Thanks.
Thanks
