If that`s not it try reinstalling your video drivers You might also check in the control panel to see if their is a conflict. left click on my computer,then control panel,then system then device manager,should show a yellow ! or a red x if theres a problem. good luck.

Have 16 colors and no more settings seem to be available. Tried system restore, didn't work. System information report says: Item name Value Standard PCI Graphics Adapter (VGA) Adapter type: not available Adapter description: (standard display types) Adapter RAM: not available Installed drivers: not available Driver version: vga.drv INF file: 4.0 (MILLDISP.INF section) color planes: VGA Color table entries: 4 Resolution: 16 X 640 X 480 hertz Bits/Pixel: 0 Memory Address: 0xA0000-0xAFFFF Memory Address: 0xB0000-0xBFFFF I/O Port: 0x03B0-0x03BB I/O Port: 0x03C0-0x3DF Memory address: 0xFF000000-0xFF7FFFFF Memory address: 0xE7EF0000-0xE7EFFFFF I/O Port: 0xCC00=0xCC7F Memory adress 0xC0000-0xC7FFF Driver c:\windows\system\vmm32.vxd (, 1,008.75 KB (1,032,956 bytes), Not Available) Can anyone help me?

I was able to ask my system to go to 256 colors but when I restarted my computer, it went back to 16 every time. After talking to our IT server guy, I found our box of software and located the CD that had the original Video Drivers on it. I installed it (it kept asking if I wanted to keep my current files...they were newer...I said yes each time until the process was complete). After the install was complete it automatically restarted my computer and I was set up with 256 colors. The last thing I did was go back into my display and change my screen area to 800x600 pixels. Hope this helps. Kovicky
