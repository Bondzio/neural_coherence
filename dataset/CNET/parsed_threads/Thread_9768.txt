<s> I have a 5-year old Dell Dimension E521 with an internal DVD+-RW TS-H653A SCSI CdRom Device and I run Vista. </s>
<s> The empty disc drawer opens for no reason and when I shut it it just keeps opening. </s>
<s> It almost always begins happening at PC startup (before I'm even in Windows) and continues sporadically no matter what programs I'm running (mostly IE and Word). </s>
<s> I've run AVG, Malwarebytes, Superantispyware (all free versions) and defragmenter, with no change. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Unplug the data cable from the back of the optical unit. </s>
<s> If it still opens......replace the optical unit.....20 buck item. </s>
<s> Since this happens before you even get to windows, that suggests a h/w problem. </s>
<s> The other poster is right, just replace the drive, you probably have no recourse to fix it. </s>
<s> I would think this is a broken or jammed sw. at tray door. </s>
<s> Since, this is intermittent, then likely a broken sw.. You can reseat the data cable if you like or replace. </s>
<s> Be sure if you buy new, replace with similar type drive as in EIDE or SATA type. </s>
<s> You could borrow an used drive and see if it repeats action. </s>

<s> What is a sw? </s>
<s> And I see no cable relating to the DVD drive; it's internal. </s>
<s> Are you all talking about taking the PC apart? </s>
<s> Yes, to unplug the data cable from the drive you have to remove the cover on 99% of desktop PCs. </s>
<s> In this instance, sw = switch. </s>
<s> My reference for s/w = software h/w = hardware Dell E521 is a desktop PC, then you need to crack it open. </s>
<s> Dell provides the info to do this, just surf for your model# at Dell support or enter your service tag# to get the required info. </s>
<s> You need to know, because if you have to replace the drive, that's the action you'll later do. </s>
<s> It's not hard IMHO, at all just be careful and take due diligence. </s>
