<s> my new graphic card should fit in the agp 4x slot even though its agp8x i heard its compatible but the metal bracket that surrounds the dvi/ s video plug is too small i think my new one has a low profile bracket and my current one has a full height bracket but i cant switch the brackets because my current graphic card uses one vga connecter while the new one uses a dvi and s video connector i have a converter for that but the bracket is still an issue. </s>
<s> i was thinking maybe i should remove the low profile bracket of of the new graphic card and use aluminum foil so the graphic card wont be hanging out and leave a hole for dust to enter into will that work? </s>
<s> or is there anything else other than buying a new graphic card that i can do. </s>
<s> I think the risk of a piece causing a short is so high that I'd make one of plastic. </s>
<s> As to dust, no PC I know is dust proof so that's an odd thought. </s>

<s> So is using plastic better than using aluminum foil because i thought that plastic would melt but if its plastic i should use than i can find some easy to cut plastic around maybe a binder or something like that. </s>
<s> That means we are well past the danger zone of the chips frying. </s>
<s> That's hot! </s>
<s> wait i haven't tried using plastic i was asking if it would be better to use than aluminum foil and i was just predicting that it will get hot and melt but i don't actually now if it will melt or not. </s>
<s> The computer we have shouldn't get that hot anyways.. so should i use plastic replace the metal bracket that is too small? </s>
<s> Plastic gives anyone a shot at getting it done. </s>
<s> Metal (any type) comes with &quot;extra skill required&quot; but FOIL gives me a bad feeling as it could fall into the machine. </s>
<s> Yes I've headed to the shop to make a new custom bracket when needed. </s>
<s> It's just sheet metal so tin snips and a drill press then some creative bending was all that was ever needed. </s>
<s> Plastic could be the easy and safe fix. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I do agree with all you said and since i don't have that much skill in using drills i wouldnt want to mess anything up so I'll just use plastic thanks for answering my questions. </s>
