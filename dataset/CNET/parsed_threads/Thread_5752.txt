<s> I already have my OS as well as other software programs installed on my Western Digital hdd. </s>
<s> I doubt it's possible because all the software is already installed on my current hdd, but I would like to add another of the exact same Western Digital hard drive in conjunction with my current hard drive to create a RAID 0 or stripped system. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if this is possible, and, if so, how I would go about it? </s>
<s> My second question about a RAID 0 system is if it is possible to backup all its files onto an external hdd? </s>
<s> Does your raid system support such? </s>
<s> Most don't. </s>
<s> Item 2 is a software issue. </s>
<s> I think Acronis is quite good. </s>
<s> As Bob say, make sure your system supports RAID. </s>
<s> Here's what you can try. </s>
<s> Enable RAID on your MB's ports that support it and install the proper drivers on your current HD and make sure they show as functioning properly. </s>
<s> Next, make a complete HD image using software capable of doing such on another HD...and preferably one that will restore from DOS. </s>
<s> Put your two WD drives on the RAID channel, boot and create the array as you desire. </s>
<s> Once the array is created, connect the HD with the full image on it to the system and restore that to the RAID array. </s>
<s> Set the array as the first HD in the boot order and fire it up. </s>
<s> If all goes well, it will start just fine but Windows could be unhappy about the hardware changes and require re-activation. </s>
<s> If all doesn't go well, you still have the full image available to restore as it worked before. </s>
<s> As for your question about backing up to an external, that should work fine. </s>
<s> A RAID array is seen as a single drive and has a single drive letter. </s>
<s> What you probably cannot do is back up a full image to an external and restore it to a non-RAID drive. </s>
<s> the boot loader will be configured for ata/sata, and will not have the raid drivers at boottime (even if they're installed in the OS). </s>
<s> if raid-0 is enabled on the motherboard, it will erase the partition tables of the existing drives. </s>
<s> Sweet! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I'm kinda a computer noob though. </s>
<s> How would I create a 'complete HD image using capable software' and what are some examples of the software I might use? </s>
<s> You can enable RAID on the MB and XP will see the new hardware and allow you to install the driver. </s>
<s> This differs from trying install XP on an existing array where you'd need to pre-install the drivers from a floppy. </s>
<s> With the RAID drivers already installed, you can create the array and move the OS over to it. </s>
<s> Now, I have done this with RAID 1 on an SATA set but not RAID 0. </s>
<s> I presumed it would work either way but could be mistaken. </s>
<s> that company has been absorbed by the evil Symantec corporation who has their own product called Norton Ghost. </s>
<s> That would probably do the job. </s>
<s> Another popular one is Acronis True Image. </s>
<s> I have no experience with it but it should work also. </s>
<s> After rereading here, your best bet might be to do a clean installation on a pair of new drives of the same model. </s>
<s> Personally, I'd never consider RAID 0 anymore than I'd jump from a plane without a second parachute but that's your choice. </s>
<s> That you're looking for backup advice is a good thing. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> just installing the os level drivers won't change the bootloader's drivers which are part of the master boot record. </s>
<s> so when the image is applied to the raid volume, xp won't boot since the bootloader will be using ata/sata drivers, not the vendor specific raid driver. </s>
<s> raid 1 is often transparent to the OS since the controller makes 2 drives look like 1, but striping (and raid 5) always requires a low-level raid driver since 2+ drives are being merged. </s>
<s> and, striping cannot be enable without having some drives to stripe. </s>
<s> once enabled, the controller will clear the partition tables on the striped drives. </s>
<s> I'd never consider RAID 0 for my own use unless going for a speed record with the intention of donating what's on it to the data black hole. </s>
