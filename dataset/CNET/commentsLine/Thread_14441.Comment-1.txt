hey guys, i have a 500 gb wd external hard drive.
it was working fine this morning but when i came home today i noticed none of the 3 partitions drives had any files in them.
i shut off my computer and started it up again and i unplugged the hard drive from my computer and the power to it when my computer was shut down.
it still doesn't work after i plugged everything back in and powered on.
when i plug the hard drive into my computer's usb it still detects all 3 partitioned drives but i still can't see any folders on the hard drive.
additionally the power button on the hard drive just keeps spinning indicating that its reading.
when i click on the properties for the hard drive it shows used space and free space as 0 bytes.
can someone offer some insight on whats wrong with it as well as how to fix it or is it just a brick now?
