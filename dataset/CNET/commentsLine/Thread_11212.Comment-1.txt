i should connect apartment 2 network to ap1 network and provide it with internet.
equipment is as on drawing, wep is disabled, ap router from ap1 and ap client from ap2 are properly connected via channel 13, 54mbps.
signal is 70db.
problem is that computers from ap2 cannot ping anything beyond 192.168.1.131. where did i do wrong?
