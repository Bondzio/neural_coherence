I think that's sad.
The wireless card seems to be fine, but I understand what you mean about the cards not syncing.
I'll try g, thanks.
Yes, I can leave a MacBook down near the modem and Internet share, but wired is mostly out of the question unless I want to buy a few hundred feet of cat 5 or sit on my washer to chart.
I don't know what you meant about something being wrong there, but I meant what I said.
