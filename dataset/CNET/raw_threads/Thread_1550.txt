I rarely have to help him out, but did last week as we installed an entry level video editor so he can make his own video production. I'm sure there are Macs too, but I am a little PC oriented due to work and more. Bob

But many people get a new computer and give the older one to the childern. If you have a MAC then go that way. If you have a PC go that way. John

I would go with a cheap Pentium 4 or a cheap Athlon XP...they really don't need top of line if they are that young. I would say I good idea would be to get them a webcam/video camera for computer so they can make stupid videos and stuff. That is just my opinion tho.

They will learn the basics and still be able to get internet access with enough speed to be comfortable. Being used, the system will be very cheap if &quot;working&quot; no repairs other than maybe getting to a clean slate as it were. Otherwise, a cheap system and I do mean cheap but affordable are in the $500 range or cheaper if brought on sale, supplied by Compaq, HP, eMachines, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, Best Buy, Circuit City, Fry's and verious online sources. That system is usually an entry system is normally new or a &quot;reburbed&quot; one that's returned to as new condition, just read the fine print. The side benefit of a vendor supplied system is usually some OS and s/w bundle in part of the deal and basic warranty, if new, less warranty if reburbed. enjoy -----Willy

The webcam/video camera that cv4stm suggest is inexpensive and should be a hit with them. He should know as he has stated before that he is 15 years old. When my grandchildren come over they play with my 500MHz desktop that I paid $2375 for 6 yrs ago now worth about $200, or the emachine 766Mhz. If they need to play a current high tech game then they use my 2.0 GHz desktop.
