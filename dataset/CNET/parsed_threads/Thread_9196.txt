<s> I was never aware that I had a raid system, I didn't even know what raid was.The restoral disk fixed my system but now I have only one 120 gig hard drive. </s>

<s> Looking in the Bios, Primary IDE and Slave aere not detected. </s>
<s> THE IDE controller is set to BOTH. </s>
<s> UPON STARTUP THE MESSAGE IS FLASHING &quot;2+0 STRIPE IS OFFLINE&quot;, however, the computer starts and runs fine. </s>
<s> The device manager lists the disk drive as, Promise 1+0 Span scsi device, and under Properties for this drive the 2 boxes (disable tagged queing, and Disable synchronous transfers) are both unchecked. </s>
<s> So, what will happen if I replace the dead drive? </s>

<s> The failure of just one drive will result in all data in an array being lost. </s>
<s> What you really need to decide is whether continue with RAID (I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS OPTION) or go with a more conventional setup where you can dramatically the reduce the risk of data loss and be better prepared if a drive happens to die. </s>
<s> I have read the exact links several times but still the question that I am asking is, since my raid crashed before I knew anything about raid, I used a restoral disk that restored the system, however, I don't know how the remaining drive is configured. </s>
<s> How do I replace the dead drive without running the risk of losing the data that is on the remaining disk. </s>
<s> I agree that the raid array is not the way that I want to configure the system with the new drive. </s>
<s> Should I just set the new drive to slave and the old remaining drive to master? </s>
<s> Like I said before, the primary master and primary slave are not even listed as detected in the bios. </s>
<s> I'm sorry if I'm having a hard time explaining exactly what my delimma is, as it may not be a delimma at all but I don't want to lose my data and I need to add space. </s>

<s> with the failure of the first drive Like I said before ..... he bad news about RAID 0 is and I quote....&quot;The failure of just one drive will result in all data in an array being lost.&quot; You indicated one drive died and you restored the OS to the working drive. </s>
<s> Sorry for the bad news ...perhaps someone else will see a solution I missed. </s>
<s> I do really appreciate your patience. </s>
<s> Maybe the only thing I haven't made clear is that it was about 2 years ago when the system crashed and it was then when I restored it, never realizing that Raid was more than a bug spray, so now I have 110 gig of data that I have accumulated since then I'm trying not to lose as I add another drive to replace the dead one that has been sitting in the system for 2 years doing nothing. </s>
<s> The remaining working drive is connected to the primary socket on the motherboard which is labeled pri raid. </s>
<s> Also, I did get into the raid controller program at startup and found that the 'array 2' is set to 'span' mode. </s>
<s> I guess that since I don't really understand the redundancy factor of the span mode, I don't know what is going to happen when I try to add another drive. </s>
<s> It looks to me like the motherboard is not going to allow me to add any drive unless it is hooked up to the raid controller, however, from what I have read, maybe I could configure the new drive in a separate array or logical drive as added storage. </s>
<s> Does that make any sense? </s>
<s> Please don't give up on me, you may be the only hope I have left. </s>
<s> Thanks, JDD </s>
