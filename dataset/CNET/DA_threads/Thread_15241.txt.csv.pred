1.1.1	I have an old PC ( Compaq Presario 4910 ) that I have n't used in years .	St
1.1.2	Today , I realized I might have some old files on it that I might want to see again , so I hooked it back up .	St
1.1.3	Unfortunately , after the standard COMPAQ screen and password check , I received this error : Invalid System Disk Replace the disk , and then press any key I remember that in the days leading up to the purchase of my current PC , I deleted a lot of excess files , but I did n't think I did anything to hurt my computer .	St
1.1.4	Maybe I was wrong .	St

1.2.1	well first , is there a disk in the floppy drive ?	Ques
1.2.2	try removing it , then rebooting .	Sug
1.2.3	that message means there 's no OS on the first disk drive of the & quot ; boot sequence. & quot ; if the error is not because of the bios looking for an OS on the floppy , even if your hard drive operating system files are corrupted/gone , with a little perseverance you can remove the drive and hook it up to your other machine and get the data files off it that way -- assuming of course , that the drive still works .	St
1.2.4	- fj	St
1.3.1	Check to see if there is a diskette in the floppy drive .	St
1.3.2	This can cause this error message on boot .	St
1.4.1	If you wiped out import files in the root directory the system will no longer boot .	St
1.4.2	You need to SYS the drive to get it to boot again , if it is seen at boot time .	St
1.4.3	Boot with a floppy disk that has the same version of DOS that is on the system ( www.bootdisk.com for a copy ) and then SYS the drive SYS A : C : to restore the boot information and get it to boot up .	St
