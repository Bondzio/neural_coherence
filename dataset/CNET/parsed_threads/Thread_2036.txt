<s> Hi all I haven't been here for a very long time, since my last PC build just a little under 2 years ago, so I am really out of the loop with hardware and stuff, so once more I have returned to ask for the help and support of those more technology-knowledgeable than I. </s>
<s> Basically I start university on the 16th of September and will be moving away from home for the first time. </s>
<s> After much consideration, and due to my limited budget I have decided to try and build a new desktop PC, rather than buying a cheap laptop. </s>
<s> My budget is around &#65443;500 for the system and monitor, and due to limited desk space I will definitely need an LCD screen (19&quot; maybe? </s>
<s> ): Primary Uses: - Listening to music, I am planning to purchase a set of 2.1 speakers and to use my PC as my main audio device instead of taking a hifi system down to university. </s>
<s> - The usual sort of office stuff, word, excel, running together with IRC, MSN maybe and also the music playing together with any other background things (Makes me wonder if I need a dual core?). </s>
<s> Secondary Uses: - I will likely watch movies regularly, in order to make use of the unlimited download bandwidth in campus in the first year. </s>
<s> - I will probably play on a few games, but I'm not a big gamer and if I do play games they tend to be strategy games and the like, rather than first person shooters and stuff, so frame rate isn't a huge problem for me, but a nice looking screen would be good. </s>
<s> As I will go very soon, this leaves me just a few days to decide upon what parts I want for my PC so that I can order them and get the system put together before I head off to university. </s>
<s> Therefore I would really, really appreciate any support and advice any of you can offer on this subject... as to be honest I just don't know what combination, within my price range will give me the best performance for the above stuff? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance to anybody who is willing to give me a helping hand! </s>
<s> Kindest Regards John </s>

<s> ): What's your budget? </s>
<s> I can give you advice, and give a rough list of parts, but I have no idea what UK prices are like, as I live in the US. </s>
<s> That budget is 500? </s>
<s> (The ''pound'' symbol didn't translate in your post.) </s>
<s> I've been working at a major computer retailer here in the States for the past two years, and it made me realize, for that price range, it can be really hard to beat a Compaq, eMachine, etc. </s>
<s> I am talking regular, no rebate, full retail prices. </s>
<s> So my advice is just make sure you price match some pre-built systems against what you are going to build, you may be suprised. </s>
<s> Yeah it is 500 (UK) pounds. </s>
<s> As for retail machines, I check with dell and it seems they cut corners in areas which I could cover in I choose carefully. </s>
<s> What website are you buying from? </s>
<s> Can you post a link? </s>
<s> If you post a link, I'll make a list of parts that fits your budget. </s>
<s> Thanks -Nathan </s>
<s> unless you're a serious gamer, something like an acer aspire 1642zwlm for 425 pounds (inc VAT w/centrino 1.7ghz, 512mb, 60gb, dvd burner, 15&quot; widescreen) is hard to beat. </s>
<s> you can probably shop around and get this one for less or a better one still under your budget. </s>
<s> you can tote a laptop to class/library and bring it home on holidays. </s>
<s> in the US, laptops are required at a number of universities as you must bring them to certain classes. </s>
