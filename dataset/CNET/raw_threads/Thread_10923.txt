Then if suddendly the fixed hard drive break on my computer I've just to recopy the external drive to my fixed one. I'm thinking of that manner compared to keeping CD data who is very limited.

Also I create a bootable CD, wich allows to boot and restore my backup, even if it's unable to boot Windows. Highly recommend, as convenient and tried solution.
