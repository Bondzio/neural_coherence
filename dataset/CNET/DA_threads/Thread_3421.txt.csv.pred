1.1.1	Help me I 'm desparately in need of help here , I have received a bootable copy of Windows 64 on a DVD .	St
1.1.2	Im so eager to try it out , but the prob is I cant get it to boot in my system .	St
1.1.3	No this is not a problem with the DVD , cos I tried it in the morning and it worked then !	St
1.1.4	( meaning it booted into the Windows setup 'bluescreen ' ) .	St
1.1.5	Since I dint have time then I thought I 'd install it later .	St
1.1.6	But in the eve when i popped the DVD into the Asus DVD Writer it didnt boot at all .	St
1.1.7	My system is like ignoring the drive completely at startup and going into the Hard drive for booting .	St
1.1.8	I tried with the Windows XP bootable CD that I used to setup XP on this machine and nor does it boot with that CD now .	St
1.1.9	But previosuly it was working fine .	St
1.1.10	Im sure this is some settings gone off in da BIOS , so could someone help me in giving the correct settings .	St
1.1.11	No matter how much I change the boot priority ( from Hard drive to CDROM in the first boot device ) it doesnt work .	St
1.1.12	I tried resetting the BIOS nor did it work then .	St
1.1.13	I disabled RAID and that wudnt help either .	St
1.1.14	The biggest mystery is that altho the drive is ignored at startup it is detected in Windows and Im able to run the DVD ( altho Im unable to setup Windows 64 within Windows , cos Windows XP is a 32 bit environment ) My MoBo and config are : Gigabyte GA-k8nf-9 motherboard , AMD Athlon64 3000+ ( 1.8 GHz clock ) , ASUS 16X DVD Writer , 1 Hitachi 160 GB SATA drive 1 Maxtor 120 GB ATA Diamond Plus drive	St
1.2.1	It appears to be one of those things that fail with age .	St
1.2.2	Did you check to see if ASUS has a firmware update for that drive ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yea I have done a firmware update and NO this aint an old drive .	St
1.3.2	It 's jus 1 month old and was included with the first AMD system I built .	St
1.3.3	But the mystery is the 2 IDE drives dont get detecetd at all when POSTing ( meaning they dont appear on the screen with their names ) but at times they DO !	St
1.3.4	When I first built my system and wanted to install Windows , I think I had truble here too and I cant remember what I did to get it work .	St
1.3.5	And yesterday when i wanted to give a try with the BIOS again I started the PC and then it showed the 2 IDE drives at POSTing and when I went into the BIOS the 2 IDE drives were there with thier names under & quot ; Standard CMOS Settings & quot ; but when I restatrted the PC ( without saving chnages to BIOS and exitting ) then it did not show the names of the 2 drives at POST !	St
1.4.1	NIL	St

1.5.9	4 .	St
1.5.10	Swap with master/slave positions .	St
1.5.11	Bob	St
1.6.1	Change the 1st boot device to DVD-RW ( or whatever you have on there ) disconnect the 2 hard drives , change the jumper to master on the DVD Drive and after putting the DVD in boot the system .	St
1.6.2	If it picks up then you rule out the drive or DVD being a problem .	St
1.6.3	If it doesnt work try to flash your BIOS to a newer version .	St
1.6.4	Long procedure but the process of elimination is a no fail .	St
1.6.5	Good Luck ... -Ciao	St
