i don't do many pos systems or terminals.
however, those that were done, suggest that the printer comes &quot;pre-loaded&quot; and was replaced.
i haven't seen one programmed out in the field.
the process maybe easy to do to transfer the logo, but not the make-up of the logo, so alot is in the air.
at best, you may get by with some &quot;text message&quot;.
on top of that some special s/w or standalone h/w would be needed to deal directly with the ptr.
at hand.
