unless you need a specific 64-bit app, i don't recommend upgrading to xp-64.
all of your hardware may not be supported.
as for your perceived slow down, consider optimizing your system (defrag, remove uneeded tray/background apps, optimize page file, add ram, etc).
since you're willing to move to xp-64, a reinstall of windows could be beneficial.
