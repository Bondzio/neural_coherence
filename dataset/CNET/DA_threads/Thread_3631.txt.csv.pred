1.1.1	I just bought a 300 GB external hard drive .	St
1.1.2	And , I play MMORPG 's a lot .	St
1.1.3	Could I put the games on the hard drive , and leave the space open on my internal ?	Ques
1.1.4	Like , play them on the external ?	Ques
1.2.1	anyone that recommends it .	St
1.2.2	No matter where you install application SW including games , some files will be placed on the drive with the OS .	St
1.2.3	So some of the files will be one place and other will be on the external .	St
1.2.4	Using the external will usually be slower because it 's running thru USB and if there 's lots of reads and writes ... the drives will usually run hotter in the external enclosure than they would if running internally .	St
1.2.5	Generally speaking ... a bad idea in my opinion .	St
1.2.6	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Yeah , its a bad idea to put a game on an External HDD , its slower for one and puts stress on the drive , and you cant use the game on any other computers because of things it has to store on your main HDD..	St
1.4.1	I have to agree with that for the most part unless ( maybe ) it is a dual hook up , FIREWIRE/USB dive .	St
1.4.2	Of course you need F/W capability on the computer , i.e : FIREWIRE TO FIREWIRE , that MIGHT do the job but standard USB , would n't think a good idea .	St
