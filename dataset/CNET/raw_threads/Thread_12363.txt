If the cpu one, then replace for the small cost and the duty it does, why not. Do this ASAP, it can only fail entirely later. Robert, is right, please replace. tada -----Willy

Yea it sucks to buy a new fan, but it's better then buying a new CPU because it over heated. Even if it's a case fan, it's better to replace for better airflow, and sanity since bad fans are really annoying.
