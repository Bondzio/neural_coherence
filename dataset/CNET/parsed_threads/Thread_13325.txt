<s> Hi, im running my own webserver at home and since i dont want to have 1 computer turned on the whole day, i thought of having 2 instead so they can help each other. </s>
<s> In order to do that, they need to have the same place to store the files, in this case an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I know that a usb switcher is an option, because it would allow me to turn off one computer and switch the hard drive to the other that is on. </s>
<s> However i wonder if there is a way to have them both connected at the same time without having to switch them every time so i would just need to turn on one and turn off the other. </s>
<s> Could you please give me a hint? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Some routers offer a USB port which can accommodate hard drives as network drives. </s>
<s> You can buy external hard drives with an Ethernet port which essentially makes then NAS drives (network attached storage). </s>
<s> You might look into that. </s>
<s> As a side note, remember to have a backup plan for any such drive. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Im interested in the router option. </s>
<s> Could you please tell me the exact name of that hardware so i can google it? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Print server router You can take it from there. </s>
<s> Happy hunting. </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
<s> I found this http://www.buy.com/prod/asus-wl-520gu-125m-broad-range-ez-wireless-router-all-in-one-print/206865166.html one question. </s>
<s> My HDD is USB 3.0. </s>
<s> Do you think speed gets affected if i connect it to this router? </s>
<s> there are two factors involved. </s>
<s> One will be your network speed and the other will be the USB to router transfer speed. </s>
<s> This router seems to be 10/100 so even USB2 will outrun it. </s>
<s> USB3 should not make any difference one way or the other. </s>
<s> If your network speed was fully gigabit, it might matter in some limited circumstances. </s>
<s> In any event, it should provide you with what you want short of buying an actual NAS device. </s>
<s> sounds a good idea. </s>

<s> Check out this link: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=6721861&amp;CatId=207 From what you are saying, I see no reason you cannot use something like this for what you want to do. </s>
<s> And, it's pretty well straight forward for installation and use . </s>
<s> Of course, you will need all programs installed on each computer that will be accessing the files. </s>
<s> Let us know what you decide to do! </s>
<s> hmmm, I don't think you quite answered supercain's question. </s>
<s> The answer is, yes, speed will be affected. </s>
<s> Any networking solution to sharing the drive will be considerably slower than just plugging the drive into your PC. </s>
<s> Even gigabit ethernet will be slower than USB3.0. </s>
<s> of 10/100 so the speed will depend on the slowest device in the transfer path. </s>
<s> I can't see where a USB3 HD would transfer data between his PC and the USB3 hard drive any faster than to a USB2 drive with that network speed limit...at least not detectably. </s>
