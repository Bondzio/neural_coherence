I have an iMac and will soon be buying a macbook.
The iMac is connected wirelessly to my Airport Extreme.
The macbook will be wireless as well.
don't feel the Time Capsule is worth buying since I already have the Airport and don't want to pay for another router.
Can I connect an external hard drive to the Airport and use it to backup both computers wirelessly?
If so, would I need to partition an external drive to back up each one separately?
Or are there ready-made options for backing up multiple computers wirelessly in this fashion?
Thanks
