i have a desktop with a 1.2 ghz athlon processor (thunderbird i _believe_) with 384 (256+128) ram.
no idea about the motherboard, do you know how i can find some stats about it?
anyway, running windows xp.
sometimes it gets a bit sluggish when i have a lot programs open.
will upping the ram to 512 or 768 be worth the money?
its sd-ram, by the way.
