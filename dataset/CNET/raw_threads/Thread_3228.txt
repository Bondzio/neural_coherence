And ill take any suggestions and opinions on what would be a good investment to boost my computer performance. such as graphic cards, ect. ect.

Understand also, that Vista will come in various flavours and need a *minium* to run for its most basic release, as more bells&whistles are added, sure it needs more. As in OSes before it, I don't doubt that Vista(when openly sold) will run its own tests and see if it can be installed, thus the last test before installing for sure. tada -----Willy
