1.8.1	The heat sink is , or is supposed to be , attached to the processor with a clip .	St
1.8.2	The clip is shaped so that it exerts downward pressure on the heatsink .	St
1.8.3	It has a slot in both ends which attach to a plastic hook on the processor seat .	St

1.9.4	?	Ques
1.10.1	You already have the heat sink , you just need the clip and some thermal paste .	St
1.10.2	The paste you can get from Radio Shack and you may be able to get a clip from your local computer repair shop .	St
1.10.3	They are pretty generic .	St
1.10.4	After you get the High Speed internet , do n't forget the router P	St
