the step-by-step can get pretty lengthy, but i'm going to direct you to a tutorial i wrote on another forum (sorry, but if one exists here i'm not yet aware of it).
start with networking fundamentals part 1 and work through part 3.  the basic idea is that you want to make sure your computers are in the same workgroup, and share resources (printers and folders).
you'll then be able to browse those shared resources from the other computer.
please let me know if this helps!
