Hi!
Thank you for your prompt reply!
Sorry for my silly question but what do you mean by &quot;canned air&quot;?
Something related to the dust settled in the radiator?
It's a product for cleaning electronic stuff like this??
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_duster Never used it!!
Pease tell me what I have to do and whether or not I need to update my BIOS as well (if so, please tell me how to do that: can I use the above tools instead of the third party software suggested by my BIOS manufacturer which is not free??
).
