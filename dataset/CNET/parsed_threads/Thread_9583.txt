<s> Hi, I'm interested in upgrading the graphics card in my new desktop and I'm not 100% sure on what to get. </s>
<s> I've been looking into this but am new to PC gaming. </s>
<s> One card that has caught my attention is a GTX 660ti. </s>
<s> What's your opinion on the card? </s>
<s> If you approve of this card, what specific third party card should I purchase? </s>
<s> If you Do Not agree with me getting this card, what would you recommend around the same price of 660ti? </s>
<s> Also, what brand/manufacturer should I purchase a power supply from for the new graphics card? </s>
<s> Many thanks for the information and time taken to help.. Specs: 3rd Gen Intel Core i7-3770 processor 8GB DDR3 memory, expandable to 16GB. </s>

<s> The 660ti is a nice card. </s>
<s> It's also in the 300 buck area. </s>
<s> If I had those sort of bucks to spend I might look at the Hd 7950. </s>
<s> Both cards should work quite well. </s>
<s> Both cards will require a psu upgrade. </s>
<s> The 7950 will require a little more psu muscle. </s>
<s> Just to be safe.....700w single rail. </s>
<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> I'll check out the info there. </s>
