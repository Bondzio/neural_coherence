1.1.6	I have two other drives that I am trying to install from my old computer .	St
1.1.7	1st is a Western Digital 120GB HD .	St
1.1.8	2nd is an LG DVD ROM writer .	St
1.1.9	Both are IDE .	St
1.1.10	I purchased two IDE to SATA conversion kits with the necessary cables .	St
1.1.11	I am new to all of this so forgive my ignorance .	St
1.1.12	Thanks ... .	Polite
1.2.1	I ca n't tell if you tried and failed or just asking for a reading from the old crystal ball .	St
1.3.1	suggest starting there .	Sug
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I installed both drives , hooked them up as I thought they should go .	St
1.4.2	When I start the machine it dose n't recognize either drive .	St
1.4.3	I 'm not sure where to set the jumpers to .	St
1.4.4	Please feel free to ask me questions , I do n't know what else to put in the feed ...	Sug
1.4.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	On today 's Dells they use the 80 conductor IDE cables so you set the jumpers to CS and then make sure ( again the Dell docs ) that the BIOS has the IDE port enabled .	St

1.6.1	Bob , You keep referring to the Dell Docs , I 'm not sure how to access these or where they are ? ?	Ques
1.6.2	I tried using the & quot ; Help and Support & quot ; trouble shooter that came with windows it did n't seem to help .	St
1.6.3	I did noticed that the Bios IDE port was enabled .	St
1.6.4	I 'm not to sure how to set the boot config though .	St
1.6.5	I tried setting the jumpers a few different ways , Cable Select & Slave , not Master .	St
1.6.6	It seemed to recognize the HD when it was set to CS but not the CD ROM .	St
1.6.7	I went into the device manager and saw the new HD there .	St
1.6.8	I clicked properties , it said it was working properly but I could n't access it .	St
1.6.9	Then it started acting funny after I rebooted .	St
1.6.10	Windows would n't boot correctly it seemed to hang up..	St
1.7.1	Go there and put in your model number and read the docs online .	St
1.7.2	Since yours is a mini tower your options are likely to be very limited but Dell years ago switched to 80 conductor cables so at lease we know how to set the jumpers .	St
1.7.3	& quot ; I 'm not to sure how to set the boot config though. & quot ; You set it to & quot ; your choice. & quot ; I ca n't make that choice for you given the details so far .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Bob I was searching for a solution that enabled me to connect my Plextor 230 CD drive to a newish SATA Dell ( Insp 520 ) .	St
1.8.2	I 'm not a hardware guy at all so am having to take this slowly .	St
1.8.3	There is no IDE connector that I could see although there is a plug-in for a floppy drive connect in tghe diagram of the motherboard which looks like an IDE cable connection point .	St
1.8.4	Assuming a can connect here will I need to install a PCI card ?	Ques
1.8.5	If this option fails I wonder whether a simple IDE to SATA dongle would be the way to proceed ... assuming I have spare SATA connection and power points .	St
1.8.6	I am hot at home where the Dell is but will return there for a week in 6 days and would like to get any stuff I need on the way home .	St
1.8.7	Would appreciate yours and others advice about this .	Polite
1.8.8	Mark	St
1.9.1	Sadly we ca n't tell in advance it the ide to sata will work .	St
1.9.2	So we keep both on the shelves and use which one works .	St
1.9.3	The really bad news is a new SATA DL with Lightscribe drive is too cheap now .	St
1.9.4	See http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=BLK-GSA-H62L-DO & cat=DVD ( was under 30 bucks ... )	St
1.10.1	Sorry , I missed something ... what do you mean we keep both ?	Ques
1.10.2	I want to use the Plextor to get virtually perfect rips of my CD collection and tests suggest that nothing can match the Plex here - that is why I want to use it .	St
1.10.3	Mark	St
1.11.1	( virtually ) ...	St
1.11.2	The first thing we try is the IDE to SATA converter .	St
1.11.3	If that fails we install an IDE PCI card .	St
1.11.4	If that fails we try an external USB case .	St
1.11.5	At some point the owner makes the choice .	St
1.11.6	Hope this helps .	St
1.11.7	Bob	St
