folks, i'm no networking genius.
in fact, i only recently learned that there are routers with built-in firewalls.
this makes me want to ask whether these hardware-based firewalls are generally as good as zone alarm pro, let's say.
i've been using zone alarm on my pc, but i've been wondering a few things about it: might it be slowing down my system?
would a router/firewall combo possibly be better?
if i add additional systems to my home set-up, can they all benefit from the router-based firewall instead of running a firewall on each system?
generally speaking, is there anything substantially inadequate about router-based firewalls i should know about that might affect my interest in this possible solution?
in case it's relevant, i'm running the latest version of zone alarm pro on a dell 2.5 ghz desktop with 768 mbytes of ram running xp pro w/sp2 and all patches.
by the way, my system runs fine, but i've wondered whether zone alarm is slowing me down and whether you folks feel the router-based firewalls are as good or better than zone alarm.
thanks, folks, and have a good one.
tony
