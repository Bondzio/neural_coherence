<s> Several teachers in our school are trying to connect their computers to video projectors. </s>
<s> We want to use a y-splitter so we don't have to always change cables. </s>
<s> When we connect the splitter on many of the monitors (several different brands) the monitor becomes fuzzy. </s>
<s> The picture on the projector is fine. </s>
<s> If we disconnect the splitter and connect the monitor cable directly to the PC the picture quality is fine. </s>
<s> My question is does this have to do with the quality of splitter we are using and how do I find one the will work with out making the monitor appear fuzzy? </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you, Sister Elizabeth Powhatan School </s>
<s> Lower the Refresh rate to 60 and maybe the resolution to 800x600 so the splitter gets a signal it may be able to handle. </s>
<s> The effect is well known. </s>

<s> As Robert stated, the signal strength is weaken due to a &quot;multiple/broken link&quot; this effect is also found in extended cabling. </s>
<s> Either buy a &quot;high quality&quot; cable, gold tipped or adapters specificily offered/recommended by the vendor of your projector. </s>
<s> I'm not that into projector and stuff but found this issue with large monitors and ext. </s>
<s> cables. </s>
