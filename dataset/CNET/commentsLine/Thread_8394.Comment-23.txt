heatsink fans blow toward the cpu.
the air will of course bounce back off the cpu and to the sides.
pushing cool air towards something is more efficient at cooling than pulling hot air away.
this is why you are cooler sitting under a running ceiling fan when its blowing on you, rather than it running in reverse (it will pull from the sides rather that directly below it/ you wouldn't feel a thing)
