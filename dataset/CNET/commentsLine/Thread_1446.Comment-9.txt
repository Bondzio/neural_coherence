...from athens, tx, usa...i usually reside near port arthur, tx, but unfortunately hurricane rita has displaced me for a while, and the instructions i have that helped me get the monitor back up and working are back home...it involves dis-assembly of the monitor and removal of a heat-shield looking thingy inside...i would not want to try to talk you through the process without the details i have back home, so i will post back here (hopefully within a week or so) as soon as i get back home...sorry for the inconvenience... matt
