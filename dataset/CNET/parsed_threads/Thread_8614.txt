<s> I want to buy a used mac that has PC software compatability, that has acceptible freedom from freeze-ups, that will serve my needs for printing of digital camera photos and other relatively simple graphics--and doesn't cost much beyond $400. </s>
<s> What would you suggest? </s>
<s> LOL ! </s>
<s> Oh, goodness. </s>
<s> Okay, you want a Mac that is compatible with M$, rock-solid reliability, and cheap. </s>
<s> Sigh. </s>
<s> M$ compatibility has come a long way in recent years. </s>
<s> So you want a fairly recent Mac that can run OS X.3.6. </s>
<s> Which requires a good bit of RAM to run well. </s>
<s> Yet, a used Mac might come with OS 9.2.2. </s>
<s> Which was not quite rock solid, no. </s>
<s> And a used Mac might not come with enough RAM. </s>
<s> OS X should have a minimum of 256 MB. </s>
<s> And of course, you'd have to buy OS X for the used Mac. </s>
<s> It's not free. </s>
<s> OS 9 could be reliable enough if you were willing to limit the third-party stuff. </s>
<s> Now, I always added stuff to 'trick out' my Macs. </s>
<s> But I used a brand-new Mac some years back and was surprised how fast it was running. </s>
<s> And realized that it was faster BECAUSE it was 'stock', not 'custom'. </s>
<s> Which led me to understand that all the software gadgets I was running were each cutting out their own slice of processor power. </s>
<s> And reliability too ! </s>
<s> The more stuff you add to OS 9, the more likely it will crash occasionally, especially while running Web Browsers, for some reason. </s>
<s> But adding extra goodies to OS X is much more reliable. </s>
<s> So, what do I recommend? </s>
<s> You can watch for a deal on a used iMac. </s>
<s> With OS X, 256 MB of RAM at least. </s>
<s> Or you can buy a used iMac, then buy more RAM, buy OS X.3.6, and end up with something almost as good as buying a new eMac. </s>
<s> If you can handle the installation of RAM yourself, that is. </s>
<s> The eMac is the all-in-one low cost Mac Apple sells for education. </s>
<s> It goes for about $799 or so. </s>
<s> by PC software compatible do you mean run PC software titles? </s>
<s> If so than you need to adjust your needs. </s>
<s> Mac's cant run PC tittles, they can run MS office if that's what you mean. </s>
<s> If you still want a cheap quality Mac than look for a used iMac 300mhz or better... </s>
<s> A Used G4 Quicksilver with OS 10.3, Microsoft word with Vitual PC would meet your needs, software is a bit pricey. </s>
<s> (I know of a G4 that is getting ready to go on the market) </s>
<s> Why would he need Virtual PC to run M$ Word on this used Mac. </s>
<s> There is not enough information given to help this person out. </s>
<s> What exactly is meant by PC Compatibility? </s>
