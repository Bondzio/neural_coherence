hi skip as i am not familiar with the resetting of bios, i have not done the bios reset.
however, i had attempted to remove the memory modules and replacing it back 1 at a time.
it continues to give the same problem.
next, i uninstall the video driver and reinstall an upgraded one.
this time the problem seems to have gone off for a while.
i can use it for 2 days.
this problem seems to resurface under a particular user account.
(note: i had created a 3 user accounts) the other 2 seems to work fine.
i had disable the automatic re-boot, and a blue screen is presented with the problem messages.
one of the recommendation is to get the windows update.
and i am doing it now.
i will continue to monitor if the problem still persists.
afterwhich, i will perhaps install xp sp2.
and hopefully it could solve the problem.
i will keep you posted of the development.
by the way, i had another piece of the 40gb hard disk, and i had tried to reinstall xp.
and it just hang and give me a blue screen with similar error messages.
hence, i don't think reinstalling would help.
and thank you for taking the trouble to give me all the advice.
