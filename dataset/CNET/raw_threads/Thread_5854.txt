PC Specs: 1 Maxtor HD 10GB IDE / Master 1 Maxtor HD 40GB (2 partitions, 20gb each) / Slave 350w PSU WindowsXP Pro SP2 No third party partitioning software installed.

But power outages at the wrong time, a not so great power supply in the PC, spyware damage, trojans, virus, malware, Sony ROOTKITS, other ROOTKITS and the list goes on and on. Sorry, but we may never know why your machine did this. It does point out an issue with your backup system. As to getting the files back, try these phrases on google.com ONCOMPUTERS KNOPPIX (an article I inspired) GETDATABACK (Software for recovery) PC FILE INSPECTOR (Free file recovery) Best of luck, Bob
