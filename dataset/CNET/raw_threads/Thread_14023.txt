I want to make sure the information on those drives can never be recovered. Besides completely destroying the drive with a power drill, is their a way of erasing the information, that's just as effective? I have a program that writes all zeroes to the drive. (Takes 1 - 5 Hours) But is this good enough? What is this I hear about programs that write all zeroes, 3, 7, even 35 times?

We always used 3 times which we considered good enough for all except government. We also used DBAN (Darick's Boot And Nuke) which is fairly popular today. Assuming you don't have something like top secret weapons data, 3 passes is usually enough. If you only need protection from ordinary non-government humans without special high tech equipment, 3 passes should be more than adequate. ` Good luck.

As well, they've too many targets who don't protect themselves well. I'd say that, for most purposes, such as Dban are more than adequate. Even one pass from the HD manufacturer's destructive diagnostics utility will make the platters unreadable from within the same drive mechanism.
