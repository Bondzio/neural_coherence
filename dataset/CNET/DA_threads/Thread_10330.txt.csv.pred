1.1.1	I ahve two computers that I leave on continuously .	St
1.1.2	a 667 MHZ HP and a 2300 MHZ emachine I also have two printers and a scanner Anyone know approx .	St
1.1.3	how much energy in kilowatts this would be per month ?	Ques
1.2.1	Figure 100 Watts for under 1GHz machines , 200 for above 2GHz .	St
1.2.2	Printers vary widely with my old Laserjet II sucking up 1,000 Watts when the heater element kicks in to today 's laser that sips 4 or less Watts when just sitting there .	St
1.2.3	If the printers/scanners are newer , guesstimate 10 Watts each .	St
1.2.4	If you feel you do n't want to guess , go to Radio Shack and buy the wall mount AC Watt Meter .	St

1.3.1	Let 's assume that your computer has a 250 watt power supply and your monitor runs at 100 watts .	St
1.3.2	For a 24 hour period the energy consumption for just these two items is 8400 watt-hours or 8.4 KWhs .	St
1.3.3	If these items are on for 30 days each month - you are using 252 KWattHours per month .	St
1.3.4	If we assume a conservative estimate of $ 0.10 per KWh from your electric company , then you are spending $ 25 per month by leaving your computer running 24 hours each day .	St
1.4.1	http : //www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ noted that 6 out of 21 supplies were not able to deliver on their ratings .	St
1.4.2	As such , the rule of thumb for a reliable PC is to fit a power supply that your machine will draw about 1/2 the rated Watts .	St
1.4.3	I 'd peg the 250 Watt supply to , on average consume about 100 Watts on a pre-built machine .	St
1.4.4	And about 150 Watts if the user upgraded the machine .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Most of the electricity used becomes heat .	St
1.5.2	In the winter , this actually means reduces the amount of heat your furnace needs to produce .	St
1.5.3	In the summer , if you have an air conditioner , it works a little harder .	St
