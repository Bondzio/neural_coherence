1.1.1	ok , so i have a HP with vista home premium , and i 'm trying to record a bunch of LP 's to digital .	St
1.1.2	The desktop has 2 L/R composite audio jacks ( one in the front , one in the back ) .	St
1.1.3	I have searched everywhere trying to find out how to record through the composite jacks , but everything says to get an adapter and record through the 3.5mm jack .	St
1.1.4	But i do n't really want to buy an adapter when there are already 2 composite jacks on the computer .	St
1.1.5	I do n't know why they 're on the computer if they do n't have a purpose .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone know how to access these ports for recording ?	Ques
1.2.1	all you need is 1 cable .	St
1.2.2	cable ... if you are using a stereo receiver ... you will need a 'Y ' cable the 'v ' part is 2 rca male and the other end is a cable looking like your stereo headphone for your portable cd player .	St
1.2.3	note that there are 2 line on the lower part of this plug the 2 lines means stereo , 1 line means mono .	St
1.2.4	you want stereo .	St
1.2.5	Check your record player and see what the output or audio out jack looks like .	St
1.2.6	how to plug in the cable ... on the stereo receiver or record player plug ( usually it is a rca jack ) the cable into audio out Left and Right of the player .	St
1.2.7	left stands for left speaker , right stands for right speaker .	St
1.2.8	the other end usually a 1 pin ( looks like your portable stereo headphone jack ) stereo male cable note the 2 line on the tip of the pin the 2 line stands for stereo ( please correct me if I am wrong ) .	St
1.2.9	next you will need software that can help you do the sound transfer .	St
1.2.10	this will be Real Time so patience is a must .	St
1.2.11	1st do a little test , test a few seconds of recording then play it back if all ok then do the whole song .	Sug
1.2.12	or Unless you just bought a turn table with usb plug .	St
1.2.13	This is a new technology that can be used to do lp conversion .	St
1.2.14	hope this helps	St
1.3.1	i know all about the Y-connector and where to plug it in , that 's what i read everywhere i look .	St
1.3.2	On the tower , there are composite audio input jacks , i do n't want to use the line in , and for some reason i ca n't figure out how to utilize them to record my stuff .	St
1.3.3	And i already have recording software ...	St
1.4.1	There are various different flavours of record players , but most will need a phono box .	St
1.4.2	There are some budget modern decks which have this built in to output a Line Out suitable for jacking into a computer ( amp , etc ) but the vast majority of record decks require pre-amplification and equalisation .	St
1.4.3	And we are n't talking about 'to get it to work best ' or 'for best sound ' - we are talking about just getting the connection to work in the first place .	St
1.4.4	There are phono boxes and there are phono boxes , but the cheapest way is to use your integrated amplifier , i.e .	St
1.4.5	most likely the amp you had the record player plugged into originally .	St
1.4.6	Using the Tape Out of the integrated amp connected to the PC , you can record the preamplified signal of the record deck .	St
1.4.7	If you want to get fancier / easier , this one for example has a USB output , so you can plug it directly into a USB socket of the PC .	St
1.4.8	This saves you having to mess around with volumes too much , and will offer the best conversion since the signal is already digital when it enters your computer .	St
1.4.9	http : //www.sumikoaudio.net/project/products/phonobox_2_usb.htm	St
1.5.1	You 're getting various terms mixed up so it 's hard to tell , but if the 'composite jacks ' you 're talking about are yellow then they 're for the teevee .	St
1.5.2	Not audio , video .	St
1.6.1	the problem is with the computer , not the record player , the jacks are red and white , right and left , and i have an amplifier , i just ca n't figure out how to access those jacks in vista	St
1.7.1	... your recording software should be able to choose between inputs .	St
1.7.2	Or go into Control Panel , type Sounds into the search field , click on the Sounds panel when it appears , go into the Recording tab and chooose the device .	St
1.7.3	There is a signal bar on the right hand side of each device , and if you select it and test-playback your record player , you should be able to see which is which .	St
1.8.1	I 'm not sure if you 've found the answer to this since it 's an older post , however the reason you have n't been able to locate these jacks in your recording software or anything is because they are part of your TV Tuner , not the sound board .	St
1.8.2	So I really doubt you would be able to record any kind of audio from them without a coupled video signal .	St
1.8.3	Hope that helped !	St
1.8.4	Good Luck !	St
1.8.5	I have experienced a similar problem with these jacks , however I am trying to hook my PS3 up to my pc using the composite and av jacks that you are talking about on the front .	St
1.8.6	The problem is that vista has no bundled software to tackle such a task , and therefor you are forced into using 3rd party software ( unstable ) that has n't been tested with all hardware .	St
1.8.7	This basically mean Vista developers + HP hardware = Dumb .	St
