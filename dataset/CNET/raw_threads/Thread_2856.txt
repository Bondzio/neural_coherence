Well everything seems to be working fine (the cable is connected to me Dell computer, and the wireless is only used by my new HP notebook), but I can't share files across the internet with people. You see, I have this internet program called winMX, where you can share pictures, movies, music, etc. Of course I only download pictures. It seems that recently since Ive got the wireless router connected that only I can download pictures off of people, yet, no one can download pictures from me. And that is the problem, before I could download pictures from others, and others could download pics from me, yet now no one can download from me. Does anyone have answers as to why others cant download off of me now? could it be because of the wireless network I set up?

You'll have to get into you DSL router and turn those ports on.
