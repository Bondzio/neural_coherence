<s> hi all, i have two internal HDDs, and i want to use both of them. </s>
<s> heres the catch, i want to install windows XP on both and i want them to be completely independent of each other. </s>
<s> probably a select menu on startup. </s>
<s> when i say completely independent i mean that these hard drives cannot access each other at all. </s>
<s> it must be as if ive physically replaced one hard drive with the other when i choose one at startup. </s>
<s> no apps, viruses or even windows processes can access both hard drives at the same time. </s>
<s> is this possible? </s>
<s> the computer is a gigabyte G31 motherboard and a E8400 chip. </s>
<s> the hard drives are two sata 250 GB </s>
<s> The Boot Magic feature of Partition Magic does what you ask with partition hiding. </s>
<s> Look into that. </s>
<s> Hd selector switch....use google. </s>
<s> Never tried one. </s>
