1.2.1	it works better than Flash.	St
1.2.2	However, you could increase the limit for Flash and see if it makes any difference for you.	St
1.2.3	If it doesn't, then just move it back to the original setting.	St
1.2.4	Flash is a resource hog and many Mac users block Flash content altogether.	St
1.2.5	Internet connection speed also plays a major part in the way video is presented P	St
