1.1.1	As one of many being totally confused as to which Tablet to buy , after all the usual attempts to eliminate potential & quot ; bombs & quot ; , the one question I have been unable to have answered , properly is when looking at machines available how do you know if it will have an up-grade from ICS to JB .	St
1.1.2	What has further confused me is just one hour ago reading a punter , s review of a Samsung machine with ICS and he was able to up-grade to JB himself using Kies .	St
1.1.3	So , before buying a particular machine which only carries ICS , how can you tell if an up-grade is possible ?	Ques
1.2.1	Do not buy an ICS tablet if you want JB .	St
1.2.2	It 's that simple .	St
1.2.3	You are never sure if the maker will issue that update .	St
1.2.4	There is no reason to repeat what others have learned about this .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Buy either a Nexus 7 or Nexus 10 by Google .	St
1.3.2	I believe they both come with Jelly Bean .	St
1.3.3	I just bought a Nexus 7 to use in my car as a GPS/entertainment system and I know that has Jelly Bean .	St
1.3.4	You can buy direct from Google or from a store .	St
1.4.1	Baybreeze .	St
1.4.2	Many thanks for your responding in a pleasant way , something laking on here of late .	Polite
1.4.3	In fact I have looked at your suggestions and am interested in buying one but thare are a couple of other machines which also interest me , other than them not having JellyBean .	St
1.4.4	I am still left with the question as to how you can know , in advance , that a machine which only carries ICS may be upgraded to JB soon or at a later date or , if in fact , never .	St
1.4.5	This is really the hub of my question which I would really love someone to answer me .	St
1.4.6	Many thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	Is put to the maker of the tablet .	St
1.5.2	Anywhere else and it 's unofficial .	St
1.5.3	I know the question well and as you suspect , some folk have learned the answer first hand .	St
1.5.4	Are you ready to learn this first hand ?	Ques

1.6.1	I bought myself a Samsung galaxy Tab2 at Xmas , and after a couple of days it started updating to JB .	St
1.6.2	It warned me I might & quot ; lose & quot ; some of the apps i 'd installed , so I held my breath , but all was ok. Ca n't say I noticed any change after the upgrade ( it told me it had updated successfully ) , but am still getting used to it anyway .	St
1.6.3	So far i 'm loving it !	St
1.7.1	Here my update happened on a well known model and Flash is no more .	St
1.7.2	Ouch .	St
