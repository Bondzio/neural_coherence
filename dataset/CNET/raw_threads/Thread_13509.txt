It shuts off when in idle and also when running labor intensive programs, but not simple tasks like surfing the web or using MS Word. I keep getting the following event notice: Kernel-Power 41 (63) error. I have checked everything that I can find on the web, including the help page from Microsoft, and followed all of the tips. I am at a loss as to what is next. I have checked my psu and it has very good voltage readings. I have checked all connections, checked for loose parts and screws that may be causing shorts. I have checked by bios settings as well as my power option settings. The only thing I can think could be the problem is the mobo, the cpu, or the ram. I lean more to the cpu because (according to the windows 7 gadget meter), my cpu was running at almost 100% before it shut off last night. Now that doesn't account for why it shuts off during idle, but it may be a clue. In case you are wondering, I have also checked the thermal compound. I have the following: EVGA nForce 790i Ultra SLI Motherboard - NVIDIA nForce 790i Ultra SLI, Socket 775, ATX, Audio, PCI Express 2.0, SLI Ready, S/PDIF, USB 2.0, Firewire, eSATA, RAID XFX GeForce 9800 GTX + Video Card - 512MB DDR3, PCI Express 2.0, SLI Ready, (Dual Link) Dual DVI, HDTV, VGA Support Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 Processor BX80580Q8200 - 2.33GHz, 4MB Cache, 1333MHz FSB, Quad Core, Retail, Socket 775 HITACHI 1TB and 3TB SERIAL ATA HD Kingwin Mach 1 Modular Power Supply - 1220-Watt, ATX, SLI-Ready, Six 12V Rails Corsair XMS3 2048MB Dual Channel PC10600 DDR3 1333MHz Memory (2 x 1024MB) Your help would be great. Thanks

Do you have another card to swap in if the cover off test doesn't show any changes? 3. &quot;Six 12V Rails&quot; Now comes the REALLY HARD QUESTION. If this has SIX Rails, how did you balance them? And this is why I tell folk to get SINGLE RAIL power supplies. To avoid learning this the hard way. Bob

I did take my cover off becuase I was looking for a noising fan (what I thought was the problem), and even with the cover off and a new fan, the computer was still shuting down. 2. I do not have a spare video card 3. While I know how to plug my parts in, I guess I don't know what it means to balance the rails or how to balance the rails. Can you provide more information?

Proffitt	1/25/12 3:24 PM	1.32750504E12	More on balance.	https://www.google.com/search?q=PC+POWER+SUPPLY+BALANCE+THE+RAILS In short it means you take care to balance the load across the rails so that no single rail gets over taxed. This is why I tell folk that don't want to learn this stuff to get a single rail PSU. Bob

I have only made the following changes: 1. better fan for cpu 2. added a 3tb hd 3. changed the fan on the 3tb hd two times 4. had the dvd drive replaced on a warrenty issue The only things that were added new to the psu was the 3tb hd and the its fan. Everything was going great. Then one day the computer turned its self on from a standby state then shut down completely. Since that day, it has been nothing but problems. I can't even identify the problem correctly to be able to identify the solution. Balancing the psu is a new solution, so I will try that.

Not the PSU but since no one did the balancing or even knew, it's one of the areas I keep encountering. I think you may be thinking that the PSU is always the same. Does not age? Bob
