1.1.2	Computer specs : AMD 2500 atlon xp 512 DDRram Onboard Graphic card .	St
1.1.3	Everything works fine however every program that he needs to send like MSN , AOL , Email it freezes his program for like 10 -20 sec then returns normal .	St
1.1.4	Any Suggestions , I have no clue what would cause his Appz to freeze when he sends stuff using AIM , MSN and email .	St
1.1.5	Could it be something set in the Bios , or could it be bad Ram , the computer works like a charm when he does n't & quot ; send & quot ; .	St

1.3.1	Your post does n't tell if an antivirus program like Norton 2004 is involved or what email software is used .	St
