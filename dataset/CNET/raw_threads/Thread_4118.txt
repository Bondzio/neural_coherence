Currently we have an 8 port Switch: Netgear G5608 and a Wireless access point: Netgear WG602 v3, to connect all together. Does anyone have any suggestions for an update to these two? I'm trying to combine it all into one, making it easier to maintain.

The router must be in front of the switch as the router assigns IP addresses to each device. The wireless devices communicate with the router. Run the Network Setup Wizard on each machine and turn on File and Printer Sharing on all devices. Assign a Network name to be used by all devices. Use WPA(2) for your wireless security. Done.

Then configure the router as a bridge/switch. It sounds from the description as though the server is a DHCP server, and could also be a file server. There isn't enough information yet to make a real suggestion.
