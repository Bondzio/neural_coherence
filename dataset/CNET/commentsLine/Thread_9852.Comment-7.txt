if you believe that's how the problem got resolved, buy another cable.
don't believe just because now its working it will remain so.
the cost of the cable is very low.
if cable issue, then those devices couldn't be acknowledged during the boot cycle as it awaits for an answer and waits.
it will take some time but it should have errored in some way, but yours is a celeron cpu so it takes awhile before that happens or not if more problematic.
either way, glad its working for ya.
