<s> I want to replace my old router. </s>
<s> My notebook (Dell Latitude D630) supports 802.11 b/g/n. </s>
<s> My needs are simple: use the notebook to access my LAN and the Internet (cable modem to desktop). </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> I want to take full advantage of the capabilities of the notebook's card, but I don't need the sun, the moon and the stars. </s>
<s> I don't do gaming or watch films through the router. </s>
<s> The max distance involved is probably less than 100 feet. </s>
<s> I've noticed that user comments on CNET always rate routers lower than the CNET reviews, which isn't very helpful. </s>
<s> I also want one that has better documentation and support than that provided by D-Link. </s>
<s> All come in dead even on support and documentation. </s>
<s> The one issue I see today is they don't teach networking. </s>
<s> Is that the missing documentation? </s>
<s> I've used D-link, Netgear, and Linksys. </s>
<s> All have worked, and I've had problems with each one. </s>
<s> A while back I got a Linksys (read Cisco) WRT-350N. </s>
<s> Worked until it didn't, the wireless died. </s>
<s> Before that I had a D-link something else until it died. </s>
<s> I had the Linksys repaired (under warranty). </s>
<s> While I was waiting on it I got a D-link DIR-655. </s>
<s> Both the latest Linksys and D-link are gigabit wired and wireless N. The D-link is now running and the repaired Linksys is still in the box. </s>
<s> Long story short, what's the best? </s>
<s> Ford or Chevy. </s>
<s> It's hard to say which one is better. </s>
<s> I get good wired speeds and the wireless is powerful. </s>
<s> In reality, I have found by experience that D-link has better documentation and support. </s>
<s> When I sent questions to each one, only D-link replied in a timely manor. </s>
<s> I even got a phone call from an email question. </s>
<s> Not saying Linksys is bad, they just took too long to reply. </s>
<s> Maybe a fluke. </s>
<s> Just get a name brand. </s>
<s> And remember this for wireless. </s>
<s> As distance increases, speed decreases. </s>
