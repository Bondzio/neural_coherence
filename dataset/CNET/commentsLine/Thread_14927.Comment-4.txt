as already stated to you, replacing the kybd.
would be an easy fix.
just find one that's similar or maybe slighlty more to your liking.
fyi- well smashing is pretty much close to giving it a true breakdown.
i assume &quot;smashing&quot; was an aggressive act.
next time, just &quot;burp&quot; the kybd.
like a baby.
turn it over, and pat the kybd.
backside with a few good smacks to loosen any crud, food, staples, hair and/or foreign substances.
shake it as well and notice the stuff that falls out onto the desk, worth noting.
however, if this doesn't change the situation, replace.
