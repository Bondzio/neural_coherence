In my computer desktop I have a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 Video Card with a VGA connection, S-Video connection, and DVI connection. The sound card is a Sound Blaster Audigy 2. The television has an S-Video-In connection, RCA connections: Video-In (yellow), Left Audio-In (white), Right Audio-In (red); and Left Audio-out (white), Right Audio-out (red). What wires/components do I need to hook up the computer to the television to view DVD's? Thanks.

I am able to view my desktop on the television, but the quality is poor. What settings do I need to fix? Please advise. In addition, when I view a DVD on my television, how do I set it up to fill the entire screen, at this point, it only shows the movie in widescreen? How do find out if I have the most up to date drivers, software, etc., to be sure I receive the best quality? What is Forceware, I keep seeing on the site? If you need additional information, please let me know.
