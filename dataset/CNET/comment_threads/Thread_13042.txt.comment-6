Why not get some PCs from craigslist for free/dirt cheap and just rip them apart and upgrade them?
Good will sells all of their PCs for $15.
I have see a few P3s there and I still use a P3 as my workstation.
(It has 2x15GB IDE drives raided together for a swap file, 512MB Ram, 1x 40gb drive for storage, 1x20gb drive for OS and a DVD burner.)
It isn't a speed demon but with a dedicated video card (free) it runs XP nicely.
