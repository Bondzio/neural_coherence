MikWit, I am trying out AdBlock Plus with FireFox as you suggested to eliminate the AnchorFree ad.
The content of the ad is blanked out but the approximately one inch of white space the top of the webpages remains.
I have the 'Collapse Blocked Element' option checked on.
Any thought on how to close-up the white space?
