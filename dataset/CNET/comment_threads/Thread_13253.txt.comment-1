I am planning for an upgrade (a cheap upgrade, at least).
These are recent specs: Intel Pentium D 2.66 GHz (see it here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_d ) DDR 400 (1GB) 2 HDD: Western Digital (320GB,SATA) and Samsung (40GB,IDE) Internal video card (32MB) Windows XP SP2 I need advices on what hardware/software should I put in to keep it fast.
I also have plans of playing high spec games like Call of Duty 4, Left for Dead, Xmen Origins, etc., but I was worrying about the bus speed of my motherboard.
I still use DDRs (which has 400MHz transfer rate), meaning I use an old motherboard (I forgot the brand, sorry!)
If I reached (at least minimum) specs of these games, can I still play these games smoothly under these bus speeds?
Thanks!
