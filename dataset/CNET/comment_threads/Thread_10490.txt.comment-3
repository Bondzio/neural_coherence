Such an O.E.M.
PC will only work with it's original motherboard since the Recovery CDs will only have the drivers & software for that motherboard.
If one of the Recovery CDs is labeled Windows XP then you might be able to use it to do a clean install on your new motherboard.
You can give it a shot.
The reason I stated that is I had performed a similar installation a couple of weeks ago.
Someone had wiped out the hidden recovery partition on a HP Pavilion so could not do a recovery as no recovery disks were available.
But the HP has the XP CD Key on the side of the PC.
I was able to use another O.E.M.
WinXP HE CD from a DELL Dimension to install XP on the HP using the HP CD-Key!
