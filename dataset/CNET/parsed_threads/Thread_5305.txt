<s> Hello all =D Today, I started my day looking for multi-button gaming mice. </s>
<s> I ended the day with a $900 list specifying what I needed to make a custom gaming rig. </s>
<s> Funny how things work out, amirite? </s>
<s> So, anyway, I found a guide that outlined things you had to look for in your hardware and what specs would be good for a middle-ish gaming rig. </s>
<s> I myself am an avid WoW player (Level 80 tankadin on the Dark Iron- US server, same name as my username), but I see myself expanding in the realm of games in the future, so I tried to get some &quot;wiggle&quot; room in the future. </s>
<s> The main reason I am posting all of this is to see if any tech-savvy people could comb the list I have and see if I am missing something or my parts don't work &quot;like clockwork&quot;. </s>
<s> I'd also like to know if someone could recommend a certain tower to house all of this; it is rather hard for me to envision the dimensions of this project, so someone who has done this before could really help out. </s>
<s> xD So, here it is: CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115057 CPU Cooling: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134 Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128359 RAM: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231121 Hard Drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136098 Video Card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102822 Monitor: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009127 Power Supply: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139005 Keyboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823175103 Mouse: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826104318 I know it is a laundry list essentially, but I'd love some comments on this. </s>
<s> Besides the tower, I was also wondering what OS I should use (XP/Windows 7) and what the best way to get it would be; I mean, $200 for an OS? </s>
<s> Ugh... BTW, will I also need to buy cables to connect all of this, or do the come with this &quot;gear&quot;? </s>
<s> I know, I'm such a newbie xD But when I can see that getting a rig with these specs in a custom fashion can save me a hundreds... </s>
<s> I'll swallow my pride. </s>
<s> I'd probably get at least a 21&quot; monitor, but that's just me. </s>
<s> I would also get a bigger hard drive, at least 500gb with 16mb cache(16mb would mean faster performance). </s>
<s> Both items are only a few dollars more. </s>
<s> I would also suggest getting 4gb of ram minimum. </s>
<s> I think you would be better off getting a higher clocked dualcore instead of the quad core. </s>
<s> You could probably getby with an overclocked pentium dual core and its half the price of the processor you currently have listed. </s>
<s> if you are a student, microsoft is offering a full version of microsoft windows 7 home or PROFESSIONAL for ~$40, but you must have a valid .edu address. </s>
<s> Alternatively, you could also get windows server 2003R2, windows server2008, and windows server2008R2 via dreamspark, also need a valid .edu email address. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I am not a (college) student, so it looks like I ain't getting any subsidies. </s>
<s> :P About the RAM; I read that only 64 bit versions of OS's can utilize more than 4g of RAM... do they mean 4g and above, or just above 4g? </s>
<s> Great call on the processor! </s>
<s> I found one that is practically 100 dollars cheaper and should run all my gaming needs: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116072 BTW, if you don't mind me asking, what allows that dual core to perform as well or better than a quad core which is 100 dollars more? </s>
<s> Or do quad cores excel in something other than the dual cores? </s>
<s> I'd look at this. </s>
<s> Doubles the RAM without doubling the cost and gets you DUAL CHANNEL operation which you won't get with 1 DIMM. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231122 VAPCMD </s>
<s> Lol, I spent some time looking for RAM and eventually settled on that model. </s>
<s> So, I settled on a case as well and now the only hole in this list would be the OS. </s>
<s> I am probably going to go for a 64 bit version, Windows 7 if possible. </s>
<s> Is there anything that might convince me to go with an XP version? </s>
<s> I just went onto Newegg and found the option to buy a 64 bit Windows Vista Home Premium which &quot;comes with a Windows 7 Upgrade coupon&quot; for 100 dollars. </s>
<s> Could someone tell me what this means? </s>
<s> Does that mean I'd have to install Vista first, send in my coupon, wait for a Windows 7 Upgrade disc, and then install Windows 7? </s>
<s> Or is it more streamlined than that? </s>
<s> While I can't imagine spending 100 bucks for that coupon, it is just weeks till 7 rolls out. </s>
<s> Why rush this? </s>
<s> Keep shopping over the next 3 weeks and you'll skip the upgrade and the usual &quot;now what is that file?, is that from Vista?&quot; questions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks everybody for replying. </s>
<s> Hopefully I can get all this together... if not, you'll hear from me :P </s>
<s> PS...don't forget to do your bench test before installing the MB into the case. </s>
<s> If it won't work outside the case, it won't work inside the case either. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Will do! </s>
<s> I'll probably wait till Windows 7 comes out before I order everything. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> 4770 is as fast as 4850 and both are faster than the hd 4830. either can be found for $99 on newegg. </s>
<s> WD5000AAKS is a 500gb caviar blue and is a bit faster (due to double the cache) than the 320gb model for only $10 more. </s>
<s> WD6400AAKS 640GB is the next generation and a good bit faster than the 320gb version. </s>
<s> Antec EarthWatts EA650 650W is $85 and a very good power supply for your mid-level rig. </s>
<s> here's a [url=http://www.hardocp.com/article/2009/09/18/antec_earthwatts_750w_psu_review/]review of the 750w model[url]. </s>
<s> and windows7 is no-brainer over xp. </s>
<s> spring for win7 pro (same price as xp) and it will include &quot;xp mode&quot; so you'll have the best of the new and the old OS flavors. </s>
<s> Thank goodness you pointed that power supply out; the one I had listed I never saw the actually price, just the reduced price! </s>
<s> You sir, saved me 80 dollars xD As for your other suggestions, I have gone through with them. </s>
<s> I also decided to keep the monitor I have now, shaving off some of the cost. </s>
<s> And while Windows 7 Pro would be optimal... its pricing isn't. </s>
<s> So I'll just stick with Home Premium. </s>
<s> The one you picked is a great PSU. </s>
<s> CORSAIR CMPSU-650TX 650W ATX12V / EPS12V SLI Ready CrossFire Ready 80 PLUS Certified Active PFC Compatible with Core i7 Power Supply - Retail Voted Best Power Supply Manufacturer by Custom PC 2008 It's free shipping and $89.99 after $10 rebate VAPCMD </s>
<s> The original one I had was 169.99, but was reduce to 90 with a 10 dollar mail in rebate. </s>
<s> Right now I've been reducing and increasing the prices of all my materaisl, and it always comes out around 900. </s>
<s> I know someone who has a potential .edu address, so I'm hoping I can get the subsidized Windows 7. </s>
<s> when the Corsair is $99 ($89 after $10 rebate) and Antec is $95 ...both have free shipping. </s>
