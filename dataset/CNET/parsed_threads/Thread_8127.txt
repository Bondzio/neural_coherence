<s> I have been running a small website business out of my home, working on a 4-year old Compaq from Wal-Mart and dual monitors ( one from a GeForce 2, one from the on-board ). </s>
<s> It works pretty well and I have not major problems, but it's an old PC and I've not shopped around for a PC in half a decade ..... a long time in the PC world. </s>
<s> Suddenly I have been given an opportunity by a man who will employ me, and has told me he would purchase me all new equipment including a PC, all I gotta do is tell him what I need. </s>
<s> Of course I do a lot of graphic editing which is usually not very demanding, but he is also looking to get me into some video editing work. </s>
<s> I imagine I need a pretty decent video card to run dual flat-screens as well as handle large video files ... or are there other things to consider. </s>
<s> AMD vs. Pentium or Celeron? </s>
<s> Dual processors? </s>
<s> I will probably have a couple thousand $$ to work with.... so what would my dream machine be like? </s>
<s> Video card isn't that important. </s>
<s> Just get one that supports dual output (try for dual DVI) and DirectX 9 support. </s>
<s> Most things for the types of apps you use are handled with CPU and RAM. </s>
<s> Games, AutoCAD, and 3D modeling apps are the programs that really utilize video cards. </s>
<s> Some aspects of Photoshop can use them, as well as some video editing programs, but they don't really tax the card very much. </s>
<s> Windows Vista will probably be the most taxing thing that video card will ever run. </s>
<s> So don't spend more than about $100-200 on the card. </s>
<s> Something in the range of a GeForce 7600GS or ATI Radeon x1600Pro card should do very well for that price range. </s>
<s> For the rest of it, dual core would be good. </s>
<s> It sounds like you will be using several processor-intensive applications at a time, so they would definatley benefit from dual-core. </s>
<s> If you are getting it right now, I would opt for the new AM2 socket AMD 64 X2 processors(assuming this is a custom build, otherwise, just any old AMD64 X2 will work, try for at leas 3500+, whatever is the best bang for the buck), they currently lead Intel by a decent margin, performance-wise. </s>
<s> If you are waiting a bit, see how the new Conroe core processors from Intel benchmark, they look promising. </s>
<s> For RAM, 2 gigs would be a very comfortable point to be at, if you think you will do a lot of video editing, then consider 4. </s>
<s> For hard drives, the bigger the better. </s>
<s> The only thing to note here is if video editing will be a significant use of the machine, you may want to opt for one high speed drive like a Western Digital Raptor. </s>
<s> Other than that, everything should be pretty much built into the motherboard...NIC, Sound, etc. </s>
<s> For monitors, Samsung seem to be good bang for the buck, Viewsonics, too. </s>
<s> For art work, look for a higher contrast ratio (500:1 and higher), and always at most a 12ms response time, 8 is very standard now though. </s>
