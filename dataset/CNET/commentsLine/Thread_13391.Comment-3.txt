xp os doesn't supply usb drivers, though it may have in earlier releases.
that's a function of the mtrbd.
support cd or usb driver from the support website.
plus, it has to be enabled in bios.
then you have to if so supplied install the usb cards own driver, i have found some cheaper usb cards or devices simply problematic and only the &quot;generic usb&quot; driver does any good from the  website.
check all that... fyi - sp2 dealt with alot more than security, but it should also include sp1(or portions needed) as part of the total install package.
