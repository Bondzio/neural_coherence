<s> Now ask yourself if they might pre-install this on your new machine. </s>
<s> Would they? </s>
<s> The company is unapologetic and is not revealing how far they went with this intrusion. </s>

<s> excluding the DRM, Sony doesn't make that great of PC's.. Pros: Brand Name Nice Cases blend into anything Very Media Center Oriented (or they used to be) Cons: Expensive Gotta to pick a certain model Can't Customize DRM Scandal (Not realy related) Hard to get what you want Bad Configs The laptops aren't that bad, though. </s>

<s> I have had a PCV Rs 720G http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000301N94/102-8400451-4368948?v=glance&n=541966&v=glance for almost exactly a year. </s>
<s> Along with sony's 19-inch flat panel monitor, which is gorgeous, incidentally. </s>
<s> No troubles with the PC. </s>
<s> It's done exactly what I wanted it to do, day in and day out. </s>
<s> I was specially attracted to a few of the features, like the front-panel connections for USB and camera cards and the like. </s>
<s> It's all worked out well. </s>
<s> I've burned tons of CDs and DVDs, done copying and ripping and all of it, without a hitch. </s>
<s> The few times I've needed support (always of my own doing), it's been there in live chat. </s>
<s> And I've run recovery twice and the program works as intended. </s>
<s> If you go vaio, make sure to let the Update program run in the taskbar. </s>
<s> It will alert you to driver updates and so forth at the sony support site, and they come out pretty regularly, another little bonus that I like. </s>
<s> In short, I'm happy with my vaio and plan on using it several more years. </s>
<s> I have 3 Vaios: 2 towers and a little travel notebook. </s>
<s> Both tower hard drives went bad very quickly. </s>
<s> My most recent is ticking on borrowed time. </s>
<s> Now I have 2 external drives backing all data, a drive image and a clone. </s>
<s> I do like the media features but Sony has used very unreliable hard drives. </s>
<s> Also, the DVD write grinds; the DVD read, if I let it activate ruins the DVD because it converts to &quot;0 space used and 0 space available.&quot; Many copies are in RAW image for no reason or selection. </s>
<s> Steve66: Have you ever had any problem with the PC fan running continously? </s>
<s> I also have A PCV-RS720G. </s>
<s> Only factory installed hardware on the machine, but the fan runs almost all the time and it's very loud and annoying. </s>
<s> Has anyone else experienced this? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I'm looking for a PC to assist my family with school, media, basic gaming, and general home office work. </s>
<s> I want to spend under $1000, I'm fight with the Sony Vaio RB52, HP Pavilion, or just the thought of finding a Dell. </s>
<s> Any have any suggestios? </s>
<s> Hello, I have the Sony Vaio PCV-RS720G Easy bake over as well and may have a 4-6 month solution to your FAN problem. </s>
<s> My fan was soo loud that I couldn't even talk to people on the phone by my desk. </s>
<s> Here are the steps I took to fix my problem. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> UNPLUG the computer! </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Remove the computer case. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Locate the aluminum 2-3 inch (DUST coated) cooling tower above the Pentium 4 CPU. </s>
<s> It's hard to miss. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Carefully unscrew the fan (4 phillip screws) and remove dust from underneith the fan (Cooling fins) and the side (cooling fins). </s>
<s> I carefully used a mini vacuume (or a house vacuume that has a air pressure release slot for reducing the suction power, a can of compressed air can and a soft cloth to remove all the dust from the cooling fins and the inner compartment as well. </s>
<s> You could CAREFULLY blow out the power supply as well, Read air can directions carefully as resedue can be emmitted from the can if you're not careful. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Replace the cover and plug in, restart the computer. </s>
<s> My computer's cooling fan stopped whirring like a police siren. </s>
<s> Take Care, John - HomeComputerSetup.com Gurnee Illinois </s>
<s> See this review about their customer service: http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/promos/smart_computing/artifacts/19770313_Eprint.pdf </s>
<s> but that was a tower model not the all in one Mac like. </s>
<s> The reason why I went with dell in 2004 was because of the protection plan because we move about every 12-18 months and use mover because of my husband work seeing that my vaio was murdered during our move back to the states. </s>
