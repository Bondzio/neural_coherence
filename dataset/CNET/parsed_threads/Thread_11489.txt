<s> Also, I was informed the graphics card is about mid-level? </s>
<s> as far as cards go. </s>
<s> And the psu isn't very good. </s>
<s> I am not big time gamer, but I would like to get into it a little. </s>
<s> Would it be worth buying this, and then buying a new graphics card/psu? </s>
<s> I also have a 19&quot; hd monitor and 160 gb hdd that I can throw into it. </s>
<s> Sorry, couldn't find an edit option. </s>

<s> Something that can handle good games. </s>
<s> depending on how much its been used, yes thats a good deal. </s>
<s> you could probaby build it yourslef for a couple hundred more, but im guessing your dont know how to. </s>
<s> the video card isnt amazing, but its not crap either i think if you stay with taht video card the psu will be fine with another hard drive </s>

<s> I'd think this would be a nice upgrade for me. </s>
<s> But if I have to go out and spend more on a new graphics card, maybe it's not worth it? </s>
<s> I am having such a difficult time deciding, lol. </s>
<s> I just want to be able to play some good games. </s>
<s> and you can play most games on medium settings with the 9500gt. </s>
<s> no need to immediately start replacing components but the 80gb hard drive is pretty dinky. </s>
<s> the new comp will blow that one out of the water. </s>
<s> it has a MUCH faster cpu, more ram and way better video card </s>
<s> Indeed. </s>
<s> I don't even know what to ask anymore. </s>
<s> Either I buy this, use it for a bit and upgrade graphics card when I can, or wait until I can afford to build one myself. </s>
<s> Decisions!! </s>
