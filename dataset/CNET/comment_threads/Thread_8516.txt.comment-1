I have a USB Memory Bar USB Device Flash Drive which I got recently.
I was able to use it for a few times but after that when I click on properties it has 0 bytes capacity and the file system is RAW.
I could not format it because it says &quot;write protected&quot; but I know that it is not write protected, since it is not the type with a write-protect notch/switch.
I always safe-remove it whenever I use it.
Please help, thank you.I am using Windows XP Service Pack 2
