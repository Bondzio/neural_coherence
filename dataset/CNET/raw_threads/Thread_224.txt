Hi, I am looking to get a graphics card so I can have dual monitors, I know I need to get a small graphics card physically to fit my tower (slimline), but I have also noticed that the lowest required Wattage was like 300, I read somewhere that the GeForce 8500 GT and the GeForce 8600 GT will work on such a small PSU, but I don't want to risk blowing anything up... So does anyone know one that will work or one that just doesn't require so much juice? I have the HP s5120f...

Generally speaking the cheaper the GPU, the lower the performance and the lower the power requirement. Newegg.com is usually a good place to shop as they generally offer good products and good product detail. VAPCMD

I only have 1 open PCI-e slot, and I've only seen the GeForce in AGP, so are there any cards that I could use that's PCI-e? And I was actually thinking just getting a whole new PSU wouldn't be completely out of the idea, so are there any PSU's that could fit? I have searched around on the net and really didn't get any answers...

You research that! -&gt; How about an open PCI slot. There are Nvidia 6200s for that. Bob
