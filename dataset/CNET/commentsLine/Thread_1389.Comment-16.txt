your computer does what you want, so a new pci card with usb 2.0 and a new external hard drive will solve your problem.
although you may also need some tech service to install the pci card if you're not sure that you can do it... i would say that the whole upgrade would cost you around $105 - $150, including a decent size external hard drive.
now, your computer does what you want but everything can be done much faster, and it's not going to live forever!
withing the next couple of years, if you try to install a new program, you may have troubles and disappointment.
within the next couple of years, certain parts of your computer may die... etc.
i would rather invest on a new computer than on upgrades for an old one, specially after 3 years have passed since i bought the computer.
but that's just me and you just have to think if it's worth it now, to spend the money on upgrades rather than on a new computer.
because the upgrades cost you 1/4 or 1/5 of the new computer and you won't get as many advantages as with a new computer!
good luck with whatever you decide!
and try to get an amd athlon or athlon 64 or pentium 4 if you actually buy a new computer (athlon 64 is the best right now).
no celeron, duron or sempron... their processors are not as efficient and your computer will become old faster.
