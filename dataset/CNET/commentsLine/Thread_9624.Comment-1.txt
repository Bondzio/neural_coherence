i am looking for a sleek external bluray drive, it must be able to write dvd &amp; cd's as well.
i bought a laptop without an optical drive and i want to be able to throw an external drive in my laptop case and have it for trips (watching blurays, burning cds, etc).
i have 2 questions: 1) i have usb 3.0 capabilities, should i take advantage of that on this purchase?
2) what should i buy?
