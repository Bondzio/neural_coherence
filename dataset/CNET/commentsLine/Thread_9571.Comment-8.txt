i would wonder what happened prior to your &quot;lost&quot; memory.
perhaps a more comprehensive cleaning is in order.
dirty contacts or perhaps what may have caused the memory to lose contact is at issue.
you could also have heat issues or even power supply issues.
that does not exclude application or system software or spyware as being a new and different problem.
i don't think reseating the memory fixes or relates to those problems.
