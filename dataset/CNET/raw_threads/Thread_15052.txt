9161	0	544122	5215756	NR	iflog	10/11/11 1:57 PM	1.31834142E12	Widescreen Monitor	I have a Samsung 24&quot; widescreen monitor and I know the native resolution is 1920x1080. I also am aware that this equates to a 16x9. I want to change the resolution because I cant see 1920x1080 that well. Out of all the optional resolutions, the only other one that equates to a 16x9 is 1360x768. When I change the display to that resolution everything on the screen gets fuzzy. It doesn't happen with any other resolution. Any ideas?

There are some tweaks in Windows that might help. Make sure you use &quot;clear type&quot; for text. You can change icon size on your desktop, Windows XP and 7 both have features to help those with vision problems. In 7 it's called &quot;ease of access&quot; or some such...an accessory.
