someone said they talked to envelopments about their printers.
we also called to see what they used because we just got their stardream christmas samples.
they must have switched printers again.
they are now using the ricoh 811 and i have to say they are gorgeous.
they printed a photograph on stardream and it is perfect.
we are also in the market for a laser that will work on stardream.
as far as the epson, we have the r1900 and i just recently had to have ours replaced (it was 3 months old, already having the same feeding problems the r1800 was having).
we don't run stardream through it because it is so hard on printers.
we currently use an oki c5200 and have to replace the fuser every 6 months cause the paper chews it up.
epson recommends one of their pro imaging 3800. supposedly made of sturdier stuff.
anyway, i think we will end up with the ricoh just because of the samples we have seen.
hope this helps someone.
