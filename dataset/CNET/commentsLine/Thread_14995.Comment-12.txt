definitely a power consumed depends on it's rating that's why it is marked.look the general power rating is calculated as p=vicos*,where * is the angle to which voltage or current lags or leads each other.incase of integrated devices the load depends on the bias of the semi-conductor chip used.once the component is overloaded forward biased route is replaced by a reverse biased stream and hence excess of electricity used.and as for unwanted components ,yes it is to be removed asap.
