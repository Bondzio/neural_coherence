as my final test i boot my livecd of pclinuxos and see if the usb device works or not.
it would be a shame to see another person replace a board over driver issues.
i also didn't read you testing the usb device on another machine.
&quot;30 minutes later&quot;.... that can point to a heat issue.
tell me the case cover is off and you dusted it out plus left the cover off to check the fans.
