I recently built myself a new desktop. the specs are windows 7 64 bit home premium 3.6 ghz zambezi quad core cpu 2 x 2 gb 1600mhz ram amd 6670 sapphire gpu 500gb western digital 7200 rpm hd asrock 990fx extreme3 corsair 600w gamer series power supply I have been playing mass effect 1. i am about 15 hours into the game, no complications thus far. can run the graphics at ultra but play on medium just to not stress the gpu that much cuz i know its not the best gaming card. I went to the planet noveria and got to peak 15. when i enter the garage, all of the characters, myself and my 2 teammates, turn in to black blocks. i can run out of the garage and it is just fine. i puts me back to me. but as soon as i run in, i turn into a blob again. I checked to make sure my gpu was not overheating cuz it is only running around 45-53 celcius while playing mass effect or world of warcraft( which runs fine btw). I next went to check my drivers were up to date. first let windows 7 check to see if it needed an update. it said no. didn't trust it all the way so i went to amd to check. their site also said i was up to date next i went to the catalyst program to change settings. i went through 1 by 1 and turned everything off and would load ME1. still broken. Next i turned everything to max. same result. I changed all the settings in game in the same manner. No change. i figured the files for ME1 must be bad so i uninstalled and reinstalled and i was still a black blob. Any help that you can give me would be great cuz i am really at a loss for what is wrong. its not like that section is more graphic intense, all other games have worked fine. thanks a lot.

HOWEVER there are usually forums about this game and you find folk reporting those bugs. And however (again) I am finding folk that think there are no bugs in these games. It's a big shock to some. https://www.google.com/search?as_q=mass+effect+black+blobs Hmm, it looks like folk are talking about it and no absolute cure. Bob
