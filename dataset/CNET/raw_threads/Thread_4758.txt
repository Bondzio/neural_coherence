I bought a Radeon HD 8350 Graphics card and it comes with two DVI ports, a HDMI port, and a Display port The only problem is that I can't figure out how to rig this up to have three monitors side by side. Does anybody have an Idea of what to do and also what products I should buy

Don't know the radeon card but I suspect that the 2 dvi outputs will be separate, and the HDMI and display port will be alternatives to the DVI, but I could be wrong. I use 3 monitors - 2 driven by a high end Matrox card via dvi and the third by a separate old pci card, as I don't need anything special on that screen which is just used for browser and email. A

Sorry but while I can see how to connect 2, the card appears to only do that many and has only 2 VGA connections (using the usual DVI2VGA adapters.) For the 3rd display you have to add a card or USB video card. Bob
