Ok, I have $80 from a Graphics card I sold.
And I'm going to start building a new pc.
But I have no idea which parts to start on.
I am getting a 775 slot Pentium d 3.0 ghz processor and an asrock motherboard.
But I have this $80 and I am wondering what to spend it on.
Case?
Hard drive?
RAM?
Graphics card?
thanks for the advice
