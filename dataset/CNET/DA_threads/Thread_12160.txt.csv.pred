1.1.2	the power button itself is about the size of a thumb , but what 's so bad about it is that it 's too sensitive .	St
1.1.3	i 've never noticed it before , but this morning when i turned on my pc , i only *touch* the button lightly , and BOOM my pc powers on , i did n't even push the button all the way in , i just touch it and my pc is already on , now to me this is very serious and worries me quite alot .	St
1.1.4	i 'm worry that my pc might fry becasue of it , i had an old hp , i rememebr when i push the power button once but my hands were abit shaky so when i push the button once , the button was actually pushed twice causing the pc to rapidly turn on and off then back on again , then before i know it my hp fried up and was dead , it was unrepaiable .	St
1.1.5	now i 'm worried that the sam thing might happen again on my new pc , if the button is so sensitive , if my hands got shaky again when i push it wo n't my new pc fried like my old hp ?	Ques

Ques
1.1.7	i 'm very worried , please help me T_T	St
1.2.1	Yes , get a new chassi !	St
1.2.2	No not blow up but destroy your motherboard .	St
1.2.3	Best Regardes Thomas Persson IT Doktor www.itdoktorn.com	St
1.3.1	in an ATX system .	St
1.3.2	It is a momentary contact switch , at first contact it initiates a logic circuit on the mobo that turns the supply on .	St
1.3.3	The supply has a built in delay of 100 to 500 ms to allow the voltage to get up to spec before it issues the Power OK signal .	St
1.3.4	The various delays would make the second contact to be missed by the logic circuitry unless it was a few seconds later .	St
1.3.5	The problem that you had with the prior computer was likely with an AT type system , where the power switch was an alternate action switch and could be activated off and on rapidly [ this still should not bother a good supply [ back in the old vacuum tube days it definitely caused problems .	St
1.4.1	well i have a very bad power supply , i do n't even know what brand it is , i did take a look it saids : & quot ; ADDW power supply & quot ; that 's it , i think the addw is the brand name for it , like i said i builted my pc in hong kong , i got it custom builted so i have no clue what kind of psu those guys gave me , so far there has been some problems with it but not too serious i guess .	St
1.4.2	a few months ago , there was a very serious problem with my new pc , when i click on & quot ; log out & quot ; in windows xp , my pc , unexpectly : shuts off then back on , then off then on then off then on ... .RAPIDLY and uncontrollable i pull the plug and turn my pc back on , it was dead , it beeps at me but nothing came on , in that moment my pc was dead .	St
1.4.3	when my hp died , it too beep at me and nothing came on , i cried and cried because i ca n't believe within just a month of losing old hp i broke another new pc , i could n't stop crying as i manually turn my pc on and off hoping it might it might come back online , but it did n't , so i turn it off and spend an hour crying .	St
1.4.4	when i 'm finish with that , i tried one more time , i turn on my supposedly broken pc and a miracle happened .	St
1.4.5	MY PC WAS ALIVE AGAIN !	St
1.4.6	bios boot , then windows , everything was back to normal again , it was strange since my pc was suppose to be broken , i heard the beeps and saw the blank screen , it was dead , but for some odd reason it was back alive again after i turn it back on .	St
1.4.7	maybe ASUS mobo revive itself , but it does n't matter , my pc is working , i bought my old hp in canada 5 years ago , and it broke 8 times within a year and the tech guys could n't fix it so they have to gave me new parts everytime it broke .	St
1.4.8	every single pc i own always breaks , no matter how careful i am it still breaks in the end , i vow not to let my new pc breaks again , that 's whay i got so anxious and ask so many questions and got so worried , believe me , if your old pc breaks 8 times per year and your new one is having problems anyone would get all worried sick .	St
1.4.9	well thanks for helping me out , really , many thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	Having a cheap system only provides ease in its failure , sooner or later .	St
1.5.2	But since you already experienced a 2nd PC to die , maybe you got & quot ; bad power & quot ; like in AC .	St
1.5.3	I suggest if you do n't already get a decent surge protector , a AC line conditioner plus a UPS unit .	St
1.5.4	Getting all these will help or provide a level of performance just to be stable at least from AC surges and the like , clean power .	St
1.5.5	Rememeber , cheap is cheap and as you mentioned unit was from that source of known cheap stuff , well you get the picture .	St
1.5.6	replace the psu with a namebrand one and of at least 400W or better .	St
1.5.7	A cheap 500W is good if its way above your power needs , heck 550W psu units are becoming common .	St
1.5.8	As for the case ON switch , if its truly touchy it maybe crappy construction or even broke .	St
1.5.9	Find its connection on the mtrbd .	St
1.5.10	and unplug then replace with a simple monentarily contact sw. and see if the problem goes away .	Sug
1.5.11	nother one from a broke system case ( test unit ) will do fine .	St
1.5.12	Try that and get back with results ... tada -- -- -Willy	St

1.6.2	or te damage is already taking its toll ?	Ques
1.6.3	this morning it happened again , i got so nervous when i was about to push that sensitive power button , my hands shake when touched it and ... . well my pc turns back on with a very strange noise coming from the chasis , i think i just damage something , it 's all my fault T_T	St
