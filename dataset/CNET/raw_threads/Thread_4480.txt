The brown slot is your AGP slot. This is where you want to install your AGP graphics card. Go to a site such as Newegg, and search Video Cards -&gt; AGP X4/X8. Although you're mainboard will only produce X4 AGP speeds, installing a card that supports X8 is okay. Is this a custom built PC, or an OEM bought from Dell, HP, eMachines, etc.?

Inside your case, on the power supply, you should see a label with several, perhaps confusing, numerical values. You want to find the value that represents the Total Watt Output - or something like that. If it is below 300W, I would consider replacing the power supply as well. The good news is that your case is probably standard ATX. You should be able to install a good 500W + power supply without problems - if you need to.

I can't find anaything written on it. So I don't know the power output. There is only small label on the power supply written on it, QC pass ese 016316 then a table of number, and number 4 is ticked.

Try unscrewing the power supply from the case (if you haven't already), and search the areas &quot;hidden&quot; due to the case. Honestly, given the age of your mainboard and graphics card, you're probably ready for a new power supply. Use Newegg, or you're favorite retailer, and find something with at least 450W. Good brands include PC Power & Cooling, OCZ, Antec, and a few others. Newegg.com's (no, I don't work for them, they just happen to be the best, in my opinion) customer reviews happen to be very reliable. When purchasing hardware, I often pay close attention to what others are saying about products I'm interested in. You may find the reviews to be helpful. Happy Hunting! Michael
