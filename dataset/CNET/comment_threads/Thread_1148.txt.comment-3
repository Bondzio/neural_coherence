are u on 98 se.
I don't think it will make a lot of difference 98 or 98se.
Just go into the bios and set it to boot from the cd rom drive.
Also on your pc just go to google search and look for booting 98 how to etc ther are 1000s of webs on that.
I think if Mums pc can see the cd rom drive try booting over the current system if that works then I would think of upgrading.
I did read of someone upgrading from 98 to xp but i am not sure if this is possible + plus u will need a valid copy with reg key code.
Sorry that is all i can help u with regards ....... John
