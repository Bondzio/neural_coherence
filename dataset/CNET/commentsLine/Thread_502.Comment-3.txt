the cache and fsb is different.
the cache won't make much of a diff.
as for the fsb speed, it determines your multiplier, which determines your clock speed.
so 1.5 won't make much of a difference to 1.6. usually if you customize a notebook, you can upgrade to a 1.6 for little $$$.
the main difference is the features.
the 370 lacks certain features that the pentium m comes with.
btw, good luck playing sims 2, i believe you need a direct x 9.0c compatible gfx card.
now the gma 900, which proabbly comes with your system supports it i think, but ppl had problems with it.
