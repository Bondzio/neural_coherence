though i really don't think it will make much difference.
if you are doing standard definition, the g4 based machines from last year were fine.
if you want to do high-definition, that might be more of a challenge, but the current crop of apple laptops, whether macbook or pro, should be fine as well.
i expect the hidef video import to be less than real-time - but that is a cpu issue, not a video/graphics implementation issue.
and whether macbook or pro, standard definition (16:9 or 4:3 will be realtime import.
this presumes you are using a minidv tape based camcorder and importing the video over firewire.
don't even consider using a dvd-based camcorder (the video is *that* bad when you rip the dvd; hard drive based camcorders will need a &quot;translator&quot; after you copy the file from the camcorder's hard drive to the computer... suggest looking through the camcorder forum here at cnet or get to know the apple.com support discussions area as both are extremely helpful.
you'll benefit from maxing out the ram whichever laptop you choose.
you probably should plan on getting an external firewire-connected drive, too.
