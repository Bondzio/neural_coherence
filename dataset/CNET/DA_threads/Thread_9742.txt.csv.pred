1.1.1	My computer , which I built approx 1 year ago , is suddenly displaying the speed of my AMD Athlon 1.2GHZ as 900MHZ .	St
1.1.2	How can this be corrected ? ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks , Bob	St
1.2.1	Verify in your bios setting , the proper cpu setting .	St
1.2.2	usually the multipler is off and thus reflects a lower cpu rating , look at the FSB , etc .	St
1.2.3	save it upon exit .	St
1.2.4	You may have to reboot to be 100 % it kept the new setting .	St
1.2.5	This is the 1st area to look into .	St
1.2.6	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	the multiplier is fixed and even if the mobo offers settings the CPU will simply ignore them .	St
1.3.2	What has likely happened is that you had a & quot ; bad & quot ; shutdown as interpreted by your mobo logic so it reset the memory bus speed to the lowest setting as a protective measure .	St
1.3.3	You should be able to simply go into the BIOS and set the memory bus speed back to the desired setting .	St
1.3.4	Various BIOS 's have different ways of referring to this setting .	St
1.3.5	Some call it FSB , for DDR memory they may memtion the basic speed or the doubled speed [ example 133 or 266 , for PC 2700 memory ] .	St
