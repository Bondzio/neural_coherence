a cheap solution i have found is to cut several layers of corrugated cardboard to just fit under the bottom of the laptop.
this elevates the bottom and provides a heat sink to dissapate the built up heat as the corrugation acts as a heat pipe wicking away the heat.
if you like you can cover the top with a layer of aluminum foil hot glued to the cardboard.
