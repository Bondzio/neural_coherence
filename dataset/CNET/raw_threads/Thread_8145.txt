I don't have a ton of money to spend on it, around $200.00 neighborhood. My main concern is that the board be future ready and reliable. Also, whether I should go PCI express or stick with AGP. The card I have in my current PC is a Radeon 9800 pro 128mb. What I'm wondering is should I get an AGP board and cannibalize the old computer, thus saving money or bide my time and get the PCI express. So confused, lol. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If an upgrade, what CPU (and socket type), memory amount and type, video card model, etc. do you already have. The $200 is for just a motherboard, or for a motherboard and new PCI-Express X16 video card?

Only parts I will be taking from my old system are a Radeon 9800 Pro 128mb, DVD Rom 16x drive, CD R/RW drive, and WD 80gb - 7200rpm HD. Depending on whether I decide to get an AGP board, or PCI express board will make or break the Radeon. The $200 is for the motherboard only. My main sticking point is AGP or PCI express...do I go for AGP and what are my chances of being obsolete in the near future, or PCI express and build the system slowly, as I can only afford to build it a piece at a time? Also will be installing new memory, not moving the old cards over.

Your biggest costs will be the new video card and a new processor...unless you're using the old one. $200 won't hack it. You'll spend at least that on the CPU. $130 for the motherboard; $75 - $100 for memory. A 350w PSU may work initially but you'll need to upgrade to at least 400w..with 450w preferred. Oh yeh... if you computer came with Windows loaded you'll have to buy a new OS. OEM supplied OSes won't activiate on the new motherboard. and life goes on... Jack
