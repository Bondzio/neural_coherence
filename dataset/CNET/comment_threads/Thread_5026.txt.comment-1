Ok, I have a Western Digital 80 GB Hard Drive.
I have it hooked up as a slave right now and am attempting to format the drive with Partition Magic.
I can read from and write to the drive just fine in WinXP Pro, though Windows says it only has about 36 GB (I previously had a partition on the drive splitting it in half, so I'm guessing that is where this is coming from, but it no longer shows any partitions, just the one small drive).
Partition Magic shows the drive as &quot;BAD&quot; and produces an error when attempting to format (bad parameter/argument).
PM also reports that the drive has a bad MBR (Master Boot Record).
In Windows I can format to NTFS just fine, but nothing changes in PM.
I want my other 40Gigs back and to partition the drive again.
Is there any software or special jumper setting that can get it right?
