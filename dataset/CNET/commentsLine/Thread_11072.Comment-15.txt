no doubt that there are lots better out today and that 478 is getting harder to come across.
i guess it would just depend on how much a person would want to engage in.
prices for new have come down a good deal but if a person does not want the task of replacing software and transferring tons of personal data, the upgrade may give the older machine a bit more life.
either way, i hope that the original poster will now be more confident it what ever decision he makes.
thanks for your insight.
