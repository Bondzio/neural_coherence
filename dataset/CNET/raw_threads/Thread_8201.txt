I saw this place that said CPU speed. It stated 133mhz. I hit enter. It said to put in a value bewteen 133 and 200, so I put 200. And then I saved and exited. Anyway, it went to restart, and I have no response from my monitor. I use another video card (so I don't use my onboard one). I tried plugging the monitor back into my old onboard video with no success. At startup the Hard drive dosen't do its usual beep. Please help. Do I need to reset BIOS? If so, how would I go about doing that without actually going in to the BIOS. I dont think my mobo is shot, because I recieve the annoying long beep if I take my RAM out. The only other thing I can think of is that the processor is shot. I put my ear close to it and can hear noise but I'm not sure if thats how it usually sounds because I dont ever listen to my processor up close. In case its important im using win XP. 2.4GHZ processor, 512 RAM. I dont really care if I lose whats on my HD so much(most of it is backed up) and the other stuff is on my ipod. Please HELP!! PS I posted this in the Computer help forum as well. Im not sure which is appropriate.

One overclocks the Memory bus in 1 MHz steps. Thus if you were trying to overclock starting from 133 MHz, he says try 134 MHz as the next step. If you want to overclock, PLEASE do a lot of research to understand the techniques that are used for various types of systems.
