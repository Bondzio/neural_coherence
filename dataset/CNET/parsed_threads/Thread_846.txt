<s> I need a new desktop and have been looking at MCV Engineering. </s>
<s> They are at mcvpc.com. </s>
<s> They custom-build desktops at a pretty competitive price. </s>
<s> They claim to have been in the business for several years. </s>
<s> They're located in Dublin, OH, not exactly the silicon valley. </s>
<s> Just want to know if anyone out there has ever had any dealings with them. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the site looks cheaply done, seems like a geocities get-up personally i wouldn't buy from a company like that why not build it yourself? </s>
<s> Cnet's course starts on monday...and it's very well put together </s>
<s> Yes there are lots of places like this, just look on ebay. </s>
<s> If everthing works ok, fine. </s>
<s> But if it dosn't??? </s>
<s> Take the C-Net course. </s>
<s> There are a lot of help pages like this one below. </s>
<s> John http://www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html </s>
<s> I've had very negative experiences with the personnel of mcvpc.com, which include parts broken on arrival, late shipping, and extremely rude customer service. </s>
<s> Check them out with the BBB before doing business with them, and remember to &quot;read the fine print&quot; in their Terms and Conditions section. </s>
<s> I have a small business and have purchased 5 systems over the past 2 years from MCV. </s>
<s> All of the transactions went very smoothly and the deliveries were timely. </s>
<s> About a month ago, my first systems power supply gave out and I contacted them and they sent out a new one very quickly. </s>
<s> No problems at all...I would recommend them very highly. </s>
<s> Check out the ratings at resellerratings.com or ebay, all very positive (that's what I did). </s>
<s> MCV Engineering used to be Explorer Micro...and it doesn't look like they had a very good reputation. </s>
<s> It seems that Explorer Micro went out of business and reincarnated itself as MCV. </s>
<s> Here's a quote: &quot;Explorer Micro has filed bankruptcy, they can be found further ripping off people under their new business: www.mcvpc.com.&quot; Doesn't sound too good, huh? </s>
<s> I'd be real careful if I were you. </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> This is the source of the quote I posted above: http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:WxxIi01M-gsJ:www.thecomplaintstation.com/cgi-bin/datacgi/database.cgi%3Ffile%3DForum%26report%3DSubtopicSummary%26SubtopicID%3D00032129%26firstrecord%3D0%26finalrecord%3D14+mcvpc+complaints&hl=en It's not the only info I found--just the source of the quote in question. </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> and it's not cached. </s>
<s> http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1752-p1-s2-d1.html And I quote: &quot;Explorer Micro has disappeared, but they have reappeared elsewhere on the Internet. </s>
<s> Their new address is http://www.mcvpc.com.&quot; -JDM </s>
<s> I've been watching these people for a while. </s>
<s> They're pretty much the shadiest individuals I've ever dealt with in my life. </s>
<s> It's also funny how every time someone posts a negative review of mcvpc.com on the Internet, someone signs up for a free account just to post a glowing rebuttal. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> there are a lot of 'vested interests' watching what goes on at CNET and other forums. </s>
<s> Welcome to the third internet revolution--where power gets returned to the people! </s>
<s> JDM </s>
<s> It's always best to hear from people who have direct experience with a company. </s>
<s> I suspect there are many 'members' in this and other forums who signed up for the sole purpose of &quot;running interference&quot;. </s>
<s> However, there's a limit to what damage they can do...especially if they're vastly outnumbered, as they usually are. </s>
<s> And, unless they are long-term members who post regularly on a wide variety of topics, they also lack the &quot;credibility&quot; to have any real effect. </s>
<s> I'd be more worried about long-term members who might be offered &quot;incentives&quot; to boost/pan particular companies...that would be a bigger problem, and much harder to detect. </s>
<s> However, such individuals would only be helpful in &quot;tipping the balance&quot;, not in &quot;turning things around&quot;. </s>
<s> In forums like this, the power still rests with the people. </s>
<s> As for those companies which are heavily into &quot;damage control&quot; and &quot;information management&quot;, I have a Chinese proverb that applies rather nicely: &quot;If you don't want anyone to know about it, don't do it.&quot; JDM </s>
<s> Not only are they outnumbered in this case, they're not very smart. </s>
<s> I remember that Explorer Micro took quite a beating on the resellerratings.com forums. </s>
<s> One user took the time to post a positive review of the company. </s>
<s> The webmaster of resellerratings.com investigated and found that not only was the poster from a Columbus, OH-area IP address (where Explorer Micro was based), but had repeated the text word-for-word of a positive review that was also on the Explorer Micro home page. </s>
<s> Whether or not Explorer Micro is or isn't mcvpc.com, I exhort anyone doing business with an unknown company to first check out the BBB, the state attorney general's office, and ESPECIALLY any fine print that goes along with it. </s>
<s> Mcvpc.com's terms and conditions can be summarized as &quot;You give us your money, but we have no obligation to give you a working computer.&quot; </s>
<s> posting such negative comments concerning a company you've never done business with. </s>
<s> I seem to be the only one in this discussion that has purchased from them. </s>
<s> I'm fairly certain that the 2 companies aren't linked because my first purchase was just over 2 years ago and from what I've read about Explorer Micro, they were still in business at the time. </s>
<s> I agree that checking out any company that you're not familiar with is a good idea before doing business with them but I think it shows poor judgement and a bit of irresponsibility to disparage a company that you've not actually dealt with. </s>
<s> Personally, I try to be very cautious in giving any company a positive/negative review. </s>
<s> In this case, I believe I said ''be careful'' not ''don't buy anything from them''. </s>
<s> Everyone at CNET Forums is interested in the truth. </s>
<s> So far, we've heard good and bad things about MCV Engineering, which may or may not be what was previously known as Explorer Micro. </s>
<s> The BBB's take on MCV Engineering is as follows: http://columbus-oh.bbb.org/bbbasp/newsearch2.asp?ID=1&strBCode=03020000&ComID=0302000065003653 There are two positive reviews on ResellerRatings.com, both posted by individuals who apparently signed up to provide positive reviews for the company, and who give absolutely no information about themselves: http://www.resellerratings.com/seller8056.html The information from the Better Business Bureau and the information from the above listed reviews contradict each other...so what are we supposed to think? </s>
<s> If there are many happy MCV Engineering customers out there, we'll hear from them sooner or later. </s>
<s> If not, we'll hear about that as well. </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> &quot;posting such negative comments concerning a company you've never done business with.&quot; I have contacted mcvpc.com about doing business, but did not make a transaction because they could not satisfy my concerns about their &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot; and their record with the BBB. </s>
<s> &quot;I'm fairly certain that the 2 companies aren't linked because my first purchase was just over 2 years ago and from what I've read about Explorer Micro, they were still in business at the time.&quot; There are a number of similarities and synchronicities between Explorer Micro and mcvpc.com that are too uncanny to be written off as mere coincidence. </s>
<s> One started about when the other went under. </s>
<s> They're both Internet discount computer resellers based in northern suburbs of Columbus, OH. </s>
<s> The &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot; are the same. </s>
<s> Their business strategies (claim to undersell almost everyone, spam everywhere on the Internet, pay no heed to the BBB) are familiar. </s>
<s> Both have some character named Jeff Hartman either in charge or among the higher-ups. </s>
<s> There are many, many more. </s>
<s> &quot;I agree that checking out any company that you're not familiar with is a good idea before doing business with them but I think it shows poor judgement and a bit of irresponsibility to disparage a company that you've not actually dealt with.&quot; Heh. </s>
<s> If you only knew. </s>
