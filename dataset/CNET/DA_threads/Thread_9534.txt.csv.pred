1.4.2	PCMCIAs Tend to have better performance , and are usually More Expensive ... if you have n't Bought a Router/Card yet , I suggest Getting Same Brand name ( Even though it wo n't matter ) It will help if you have to call for support .	St

1.5.1	I was thinking jingram105 was comparing internal wireless cards ( like mini-PCI ) vs. any external wireless adapter ( USB or PC-Card/PCMCIA ) .	St
1.5.2	Maybe jingram105 can clarify this .	St
1.6.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.2	I did mean how do PCMCIA cards and USB adpators compare .	St
1.6.3	My fault for not being more clear .	St
1.6.4	I already have a Motorola Wireless router in the house ( model WR850G ) .	St
1.6.5	That 's about all I know about the router , and I had planned to just buy a 54Mb PCMCIA card at Walmart for about $ 35.00 .	St
1.6.6	I wonder if I would be better off with the 108Mb card , or if with my router , I should just stick with the 54Mb card .	Sug
1.6.7	I do n't want to spend a lot of money , especially since I 'm putting this in a computer owned by my employer .	St
1.6.8	Thanks again .	St

1.7.1	To achieve the ''up to 108Mbps '' that you have seen advertised on a particular ''enhanced '' wireless-g network adapter , you need to have a router ( or wireless access point ) that is also ''enhanced . ''	St
1.7.2	You also need to be in fairly close proximity to the router .	St
1.7.3	I took a look at the specifications for your router , and it looks to be a standard wireless-g router ( up to 54Mbps ) .	St
1.7.4	An enhanced wireless-g network adapter will work with the router , but its connection speed will be limited to 54Mbps .	St
1.7.5	If you had a MIMO router , you would see a range and speed boost with either the standard or enhanced wireless-g adapter .	St
1.8.1	PCMCIA card = PC Card While ''PCMCIA '' is really the name of the standards organization that governs such card technology , many manufacturers and retailers use that name instead of the more proper ''PC-Card . ''	St
1.8.2	As for for PC Card vs USB wireless adapter ?	Ques
1.8.3	I see it as more of a convenience issue .	St
1.8.4	Using a PC card in a notebook frees the USB 2.0 ports for other uses ; however , a USB 2.0 adapter can later be used on a desktop if the need arises .	St
1.8.5	I have used both kinds .	St
1.8.6	These days , I just get the inexpensive wireless-g USB 2.0 adapter and have no regrets .	St
1.9.1	Thanks everyone !	St

1.10.1	My notebook has a built in Atheros Communications 11 a/b/g Wireless LAN mini PCI express adapter .	St
