same thing here in 2001. smoke is very acidic besides the carbon being a conductor.
i lost a pc, scanner, monitor, and printer to smoke and heat, no direct fire.
the acidic nature of the smoke will cause extreme corrosion on all connections.
but i was able to salvage my hd.
hds are sealed against most problems.
you may be able to salvage the hd if you can put it into another pc as a slave drive and recover data.
but the other parts will be lost.
my insurance replaced the pc and peripherals and i was able to put the old hd into the new one and recover my important stuff.
good luck, give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
