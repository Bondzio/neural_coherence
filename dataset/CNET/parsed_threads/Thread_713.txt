<s> I just purchased my first mac a cheap used g3 lombard. </s>
<s> I've been wanting to try a mac and the price was right. </s>
<s> It has OSX on it, can I use any wireless card to connect to my wireless network or does it have to be an apple aircard? </s>
<s> No, it does not have to be an Apple Airport card. </s>
<s> This is just as well as there is nowhere to put one anyway. </s>
<s> You will need a wireless PC card that is compatible with Mac OS X. </s>
<s> Do a Google search for such a device. </s>
<s> Apple do not make a wireless card for the G3 laptop range. </s>
<s> Check out this site for more information: http://www.orangeware.com/endusers/wirelessformac.html P </s>
<s> the D-Link DWL-122 USB wireless option P </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I ended up getting a Hawkin HWC54DA, and probably paying too much but it was the only one I could find at a local store that came with mac support, and I was too impatient to order something online. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It works fine. </s>
<s> It came with all the software needed for a mac. </s>
<s> Another item to add to the &quot;it will work &quot; list Thanks P </s>
