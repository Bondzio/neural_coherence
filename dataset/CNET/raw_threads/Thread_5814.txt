E85000 GA-P35-DS3L OCZ 6400 TITANIUM x4 LIBERTY ENERMAX 620W(have this already) sapphire X1900XTX (have already) hi all, having read then re-read hundreds of post i decided to bit the bullet and go for the above listed. Im a little bit annoyed that i went for the RAM i chose because 10 mins after i placed the order i read that i would have been better to have went with Corsair dominator 8500. i have a little wok to do with the bios on the MB - think its F8a i need but that should be ok. other that that its just wait and see.... i got the cheap mobo and ram cus i decisded to wait til next year to go DDR3 as its just to expensive for me rite now. anyone got a similar set up and have pionts to offer i would love to hear them. thanks in advance
