1.1.1	I have an HP Pavilion quad core m9040n that I want to attach an external hard drive to .	St
1.1.2	I am getting conflicting advice on how exactly to connect it .	St
1.1.3	The HP does not have an esata port , but all I think I need is to buy an esata plate for the back and connect it internally to one of the spare ports .	St
1.1.4	If I do that , what kind of esata cable do I need to buy ?	Ques
1.1.5	A regular esata cable , or an esata-to-esata cable ?	Ques
1.1.6	I want to buy all the right parts at the same time .	St
1.1.7	Thanks !	St

1.2.1	contains a lot of drives so make sure it has an unused SATA port before you buy the & quot ; eSATA bracket & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	There should be one metal slot cover you can remove and install the bracket .	St
1.2.3	Hopefully your external drive has an eSATA port ... if so , get an eSATA-to-eSATA cable and you 're good to go .	St
1.2.4	If your external has a SATA port ( L-shaped instead of I-shaped ) , get an eSATA-to-SATA cable .	St
1.2.5	If the PC has no unused SATA ports , you should be able to still buy and install a PCI-E SATA card with an external eSATA port .	St
1.2.6	In this case you 'll need to install the driver for the card .	St
1.2.7	Google the terms I used above if you are wondering what they look like .	St
1.3.1	If your external drive has the eSATA connection then you want the plate to have the eSATA connection as well .	St
1.3.2	Normally the drive should come with the cable as well ( in this case , it would be a black shielded cable ) .	St
1.3.3	The internal sata cable will most likely to red .	St
1.4.1	http : //www.mwave.com/mwave/SkuSearch_v2.asp ? SCriteria=BA23833	Ques
1.5.1	FYI : I bought the bracket/plate ( whatever it is supposed to be called ) , and I plugged the red cable it had internally to an empty sata port .	St
1.5.2	When I connected my external hard drive to the plate with an esata-to-esata cable , my computer detected it right away !	St
1.5.3	I was really expecting that I would have to buy an esata pci card , rather than just the bracket , but I did n't , WOOHOO !	St
1.5.4	The only downer was I was dismayed to see that it came preformatted as FAT32 .	St
1.5.5	I reformatted it to NTFS , but it is a 1TB drive and it took FOREVER , like more than an hour , at least - I do n't know exactly how long - instead of watching the progress bar painfully crawl along I went out and had some fun and came back hours later and all was well .	St
