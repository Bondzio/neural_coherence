I can cause this to happen IF I enabled the SATA to IDE emulation in the BIOS.
It's a very funny area of Windows, BIOS and drivers so the details matter.
I know that machine owners do not like having to know these details but if we are to add another drive it may matter which SATA port we used if the IDE emulation is in use.
Your reply didn't give me the feeling you have this area firmly under control.
Let's hope the next drive works for you.
