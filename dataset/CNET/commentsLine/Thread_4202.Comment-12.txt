you are down to floppy, memory, cpu/hsf, motherboard and psu.
you can now remove the floppy, memory as well.
just want it to power up and beep.
there should be all of four parts on the cardboard.
the speaker has never been the cause of a power up issue so that leaves you with cpu, motherboard and power supply.
if that won't power up and beep, then one to three of those parts are ... bum.
