2482	0	511200	5052842	NR	Linux_Nerd	12/25/10 3:30 PM	1.293291E12	Moving Motherboard from one Case to another	I have a motherboard in a PC that has an extremely compact case, and it's getting very frustrating to get inside to the internals to adjust a PCI card or install something new. Last time I tried to install something, I had to remove the entire back end of the computer. My question is, if I move it to a more spacious enclosure, is there any catch or difficulty that I might encounter? I'm not trying to change the Motherboard, just the case and add a second DVD drive.

The second thing I see stump owners is the reset and other button and LED hookups. But most muddle by and get it done. About that second DVD. TIP: Leave a slot open between drives to let them run cooler. Bob

Adding to what	Bob said ....you only need a couple of the brass standoffs to hold the MB in place. You can use plastic standoffs (like the ones at the link below) to support the MB at the other support/mounting points.
