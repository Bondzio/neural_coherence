I need a wireless device that can best allow me to do the following: 1) connect wirelessly to my existing wireless network using D-Link 624. 2) allows me to connect multiple devices via hard wire to the ethernet ports. At least 3 ethernet pots required on the device. 3) Supports 802.11G 4) Uses WPA security 5) Can allow for transmission speeds upt 108Mbs I have looked at both at Linksys and DLink but I am still at a loss.
