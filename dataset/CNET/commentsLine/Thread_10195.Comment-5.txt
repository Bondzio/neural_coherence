thanks for the tips, willi.
we'll certainly look into tracking down a replacement 6l or other old, reliable hp laser jet.
one thing i've noticed though on other consumer boards (and even hp's own board).
people looking to buy and therefore discussing pros and cons of various new printers are replacing their old, classic hp laser jets (iis, 4s and 6s most prominently) because after an average of 6- 10 years (in our case 10 years), the computers have died.
so it seems that a lot of people in small businesses, perhaps one-person businesses such as my partner's, people just keep them and do not feel the pressure to upgrade so long as things still function.
so i'll check out the site you mentioned and craigslist...and ask a lot of questions about the condition!
our 6l started working again mysteriously this morning but it could stop again anytime.
we could sell it while it was working...not that we would do anything deceitful like that...i just mean that it might be possible to pass off such a classic laser printer as functioning to a buyer even though it has unseen problems.
