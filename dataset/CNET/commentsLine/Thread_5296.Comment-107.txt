motherboards that have chipsets with integrated graphics like for instance, the amd 790gx or 890gx don't usually cost much more than many motherboards without integrated graphics, in fact, the 790fx and 890fx chipsets are more expensive than the gx versions but have no on-board video.
my advice to you is simply this; buy a computer with integrated graphics and spend the extra on that ocz fatal1ty series 650w power supply.
that psu will add to your overall system stability regardless.
try using the integrated graphics and if they're good enough, you can wait until the next best thing comes out and drives current card prices down.
if it's not sufficient, got get that card you were looking at.
either way, don't spend money on something you're not sure you need yet.
that's the worst way to shop for computer parts.
