<s> I know that the HD 4870 performs better than the 9800 gtx. </s>
<s> I was just wondering if this 9800 gtx ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133220 ) would be able to stand up to it? </s>
<s> Does anyone know when HD 4870's will be shipping again. </s>
<s> Should be avilable soon. </s>
<s> If not, 9800gtxs are good if only they went down in price even more. </s>
<s> What matters isn't so much how one card stands up to another, but how they handle your software. </s>
<s> I've read internet claims that people have the HD4870 already in-hand, but I remember reading that supplies will be limited for at least the next couple weeks. </s>
<s> I've only seen the HD4850 myself (at local Best Buy for $199). </s>
<s> the hd 4850 is comparable to a 9800gtx... that's why nvidia dropped the price to $200 and added the 9800gtx+ for $230. </s>

<s> newegg has the his hd 4870 in stock now but i'm sure it'll be gone in an hour or so. </s>
