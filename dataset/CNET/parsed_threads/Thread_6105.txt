<s> Hi, I've decided to upgrade my existing PC. </s>
<s> I'm having a hard time deciding which route to go this time for the first time. </s>
<s> I was at first going to upgrade my system to one using a 925X motherboard w/PCI-e, but it seems most of the reviews I've read, the Socket 775 processors do not perform as expected and tend to run hot to boot! </s>
<s> I was then thinking about waiting for the nForce4 motherboards that run on the AMD 64 platform w/ PCI-e support. </s>
<s> Is either of these platforms an option? </s>
<s> Or is there something better? </s>
<s> I currently have a system with a Asus P4PE 845 motherboard, a P4 2.53 processor with 512 meg of DDR PC2700 memory. </s>
<s> One of the reasons I want to upgrade is so I can run a better AGP card than what I have now (mine can run only a 4x slot card. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advise any of you can offer. </s>
<s> and mobo's with the nForce 4 are available. </s>
<s> go to: http://www.tomshardware.com or http://www.anandtech.com and read the details about them. </s>
<s> Gigabyte may be the latest to come out. </s>
<s> If gaming is your thing, AMD still wins hands down. </s>
<s> yeah i have a 3.4 p4 on a intel 925xcv motherboard and it idles at around 32 and games at hottest 40 i hope i helped u </s>
