hello, i recently built a new pc that i installed an lg bd-rom/dvd rewriter.
with the optical came a super multi blue install disc for windows ver.
1.1a.
i installed the software with no problems until now.
a few weeks ago i purchased a sony bd-re (25 gb) to be used to store a bunch of pictures, music, videos, and docs in-case of a harddrive failure.
last night i went to copy all of these files to the bd-re and burn, however, when i placed the disc in the optical, the drive does not even recognize there's a disc and it spits the disc back out.
i talked to a friend about this today who told me that a lot of the bd burners will have problems reading and writing to a bd-re and it is necessary to install a third party software that will allow this to be accomplished.
any truths to this or advice on how to deal with this?
thanks.
