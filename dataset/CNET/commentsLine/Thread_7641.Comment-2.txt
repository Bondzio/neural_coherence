i too got fed up with the epson.
i had two that failed after a short time with a printhead issue.
i switched to hp in order to avoid that.
if you want to be able to print 13x19, there will be fewer choices.
while i do not have one of these, here is a link to a review of one:  also, photosmart printers can print directly from the camera, media or computer and this one (hp 8750)has built in network capabilities.
of course with the capablility to print 13x19 pictures, you have to expect a pricetag that is hefty also.
