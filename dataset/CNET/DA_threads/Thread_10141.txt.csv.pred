1.1.1	I have this router and it shows on the internet setup page that it can be configured as an ethernet bridge, but how?	St
1.1.2	Nothing in the manual on or Dynex's support site that i can find.	St
1.1.3	I want to use it as a remote wifi adaptor.	St
1.1.4	My situation is this: I live in an RV fulltime,the skin of the RV is metal, thus signal strength is cut way back when inside on laptop.	St
1.1.5	I want to place (in a weatherproof box) this router about thirty feet above my RV on an antenna mast, run cat 5 cable to my laptop inside.	St
1.1.6	I have an ethernet bridge that is plug and play, but is a very expensive model and i do not wish to risk losing it to vandels, thieves, or high winds.	St
1.1.7	I wanted to use this dynex router as a bridge since they are only $29 on sale.	St
1.1.8	I have tried setting it via the web setup as a bridge, matched the channel and ssid to the broadcasting access point, there is no security, it's an open network, it still shows up as being an access point in netstumbler and does not make a connection as a bridge.	St
1.1.9	Any ideas?	St
1.1.10	I need detailed simple information as i am not to swift with this networking stuff	St
1.2.1	in the router's web interface?	St
1.2.2	As well, I'm fairly certain you'd at least need the MAC address of the AP as well as some other cooperation from it through it's owner.	St
1.2.3	Is this a public site for users in an RV park?	St
1.2.4	Personally, however, I'd be a bit leery of putting up a 30 foot lightning rod that connects to my laptop.	St
1.2.5	You might have other options such as a repeater that could pick up the signal near a window.	Sug
1.3.1	I have the mac address and all that info, just need to know how to configure the router to perform as a bridge.	St
1.3.2	The bridge tab in setup does not have many options to choose from and no directions.	St
1.3.3	As far as lightning goes, this is not a permanent installation, and lightning is infrequent in the winter months.	St
1.3.4	If you do not have first hand knowledge of how to set it up, why respond?	St
1.3.5	?	Ques
1.4.1	Because I know you cannot accomplish this with just your router settings.	St
1.4.2	A bridge is an association between two components.	St
1.4.3	That's why I said you need cooperation from the AP.	St
1.4.4	The AP will connect multiple users to a wireless network but not bridge networks which is, essentially, what you're wanting to do.	St
1.4.5	You're right.	St
1.4.6	I don't know how to set up your router as a bridge.	St
1.4.7	What I'm saying is that it's not going to help do what you are trying to do.	St
1.4.8	If the AP has a bridge mode and you can change it as well, you've got a chance.	St
1.4.9	The little bit of wireless bridging I've done fixes the devices on their MAC (hardware) addresses and uses authentication codes for security.	St
1.4.10	Here's a link that might help.	St
1.4.11	Sorry if I can't.	St
