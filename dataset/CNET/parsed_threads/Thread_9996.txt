<s> In my device manager under storage controllers, I have an IDE controller listed with error message 39 (Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. </s>
<s> The driver may be corrupted or missing.) </s>
<s> I've tried running the driver update but a driver can't be located. </s>
<s> Here's the weird part; I tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling (by scanning for new hardware in device manager) the controller and when it reinstalled, the name of the hardware was completely different from the first time I uninstalled it. </s>
<s> For example; Before uninstall it'll be something like AQXFHYW2 IDE Controller &amp; after reinstall it'll be a completely different series of random numbers &amp; letters. </s>
<s> In the properties of the controller, the driver provider, date, version etc. </s>
<s> are all unknown. </s>
<s> Anyone ever hear of anything like this? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help Here are my system specs HP Pavilion Dv5t 1000 cto Intel Pro Core Duo 2 2Ghz 4GB RAM nVidia GeForce 9200M GS Graphics Card Windows Vista Home Premium 32bt Service Pack 2 </s>
<s> But driver update is the last tool I suggest using. </s>
<s> If you keep at this you learn to find the driver from the maker first. </s>
<s> Also, CODE 39 is one of the well discussed failures. </s>
<s> If it's working don't fix this. </s>
<s> Also 4GB on 32 bit OSes tend to do this a lot. </s>
<s> Chalk it up to bad choices made years ago. </s>

<s> This is actually a manufacturer replacement for the the first computer I ever owned (that was an older Pavilion series). </s>
<s> That one kept crapping out so they finally replaced it with this, &amp; everything, including the RAM, was installed by HP. </s>
<s> I haven't upgraded it @ all. </s>
<s> That aside, how do I fix this? </s>
<s> What will this problem effect? </s>
<s> Can I just disable it &amp; forget about it? </s>
<s> There is another device listed under storage controllers: Microsoft iSCSI Initator &amp; it's working fine. </s>
<s> But a few owners go looking at the device manager and find things like this EVEN IF the machine is working fine. </s>
<s> In those cases my advice is to ignore it. </s>
