<s> Here's my problem. </s>
<s> I have a wired desktop and a wireless laptop (both XP) going througha linksys router to the internet. </s>
<s> I have file sharing turned on and shared folders on both computers; but, I can only access the folders on the laptop. </s>
<s> I can see the folders of both my desktop and laptop when I look at Network Neighborhood on both PCs but can't access the folders on the desktop through Network Neighborhood (on either computer). </s>
<s> Everytime I get the error &quot;XXX is not accessible.&quot; Both are on the same workgroup and I never changed the permissions of the folder on the desktop. </s>
<s> I know for a fact that the shared folders have worked in the past, but I don't know what happened. </s>
<s> Oh, and the printer works fine on the shared network. </s>
<s> It is connected to my desktop and I can print to it from my laptop. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> identical accounts and passwords? </s>
<s> Example: a cloongoon account and identical password on both computers. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> NO, but it worked when I didn't have identical accounts. </s>
<s> There is a less secure way with the guest account but creating matching accounts is best. </s>
<s> Let's not make it easy for them. </s>
<s> Ok I'll try that. </s>
<s> But that still doesn't explain to me why I can access the laptop's files but not the desktop's. </s>
<s> If the guest account was enabled on one, not the other or if the accounts are proper on one but not the other. </s>
<s> One thing is unlike the other, something's not quite the same... </s>
