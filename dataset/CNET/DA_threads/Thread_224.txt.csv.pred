1.1.1	Hi , I am looking to get a graphics card so I can have dual monitors , I know I need to get a small graphics card physically to fit my tower ( slimline ) , but I have also noticed that the lowest required Wattage was like 300 , I read somewhere that the GeForce 8500 GT and the GeForce 8600 GT will work on such a small PSU , but I do n't want to risk blowing anything up ...	St
1.1.2	So does anyone know one that will work or one that just does n't require so much juice ?	Ques
1.1.3	I have the HP s5120f ...	St
1.2.1	each model number .	St
1.2.2	Generally speaking the cheaper the GPU , the lower the performance and the lower the power requirement .	St
1.2.3	Newegg.com is usually a good place to shop as they generally offer good products and good product detail .	St

1.3.1	I used a P3 Watt Meter and that card is far too heavy .	St
1.3.2	For those small power supplies you need to stick to the Nvidia 6200 based cards .	St

1.4.1	So would this be too much for the PSU ?	Ques

1.5.1	specific BFG video card , is available to you at the manufacturer 's website .	St
1.5.2	All you need do is go there and find it .	St

1.6.1	Your class power supply requires a low power card like the ones with the Nvidia 6200 .	St
1.7.1	I only have 1 open PCI-e slot , and I 've only seen the GeForce in AGP , so are there any cards that I could use that 's PCI-e ?	Ques
1.7.2	And I was actually thinking just getting a whole new PSU would n't be completely out of the idea , so are there any PSU 's that could fit ?	Ques
1.7.3	I have searched around on the net and really did n't get any answers ...	St
1.8.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814161280 However if this is such a low power supply I do n't have a Watt number on this card .	St
1.8.2	You research that !	St
1.8.3	- & gt ; How about an open PCI slot .	St
1.8.4	There are Nvidia 6200s for that .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	suggestions , no point in providing further input .	St
