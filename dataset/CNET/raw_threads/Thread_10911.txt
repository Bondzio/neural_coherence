5354	0	288363	2732708	NR	Mr767	3/19/08 6:52 AM	1.20590952E12	Computer powers off in various scenarios	I recently built a new computer, however it seems to be unstable due to an issue with the power supply or grounding? The system has powered down on three occasions. In one scenario I detached the USB-cable from one of the four USB-ports in the back. In the other two, I slightly moved the computer while it was laying on the carpet. Not only did it power down - it would not boot again. The only way I could make it boot was to detach the PCI-cards, the PCI-E Graphics card and even the CPU. After resetting the BIOS, and mounting the cards, I was able to get it up and running again. At this time my system runs ok, however I am worried to detach or attach any cable as long as the system runs. I never had a problem with this on my other self-built systems. I am very curios as to what cause this problem! Any response would be much appreciated. Regards, O.

It doesn't matter if it &quot;sounds&quot; like it is the first machine I've built. It is not. I am just trying to put the point across that I DID build my own machines before and that I never experienced this problem before. On the other hand, though, I am certainly not a professional.
5354	3	288363	2732875	2732865	R. Proffitt	3/19/08 9:44 AM	1.20591984E12	So tell this in your posts.	First timers or not, this issue is repeated too often so I toss that out first. I was not there to watch you build the machine so I have to offer the most common issue. Also try using those fiber insulators on the mounting posts just to make sure. Bob

I never used fiber insulators on the mounting posts before, but I am certainly willing to give it a go - sounds like a good idea. Btw - when working on my problem, I could hear the sound of a loose screw when tilting the cabinet. Could the loose scew be the cause of my problems?
5354	5	288363	2732885	2732883	R. Proffitt	3/19/08 10:00 AM	1.2059208E12	Good find. Let me write &quot;never.&quot;	Never let a screw loose in a PC. It's metal and could cause a very unhappy event. Power off. Tilt it this way and that until you find it and get it out of there. -&gt; Over a decade ago I ran the repair department at a computer store. You just hit on one of the quality checks we did on every device. We would check for this sound on machines arriving and leaving... Bob
