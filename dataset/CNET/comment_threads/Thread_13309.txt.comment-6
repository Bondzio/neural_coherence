what you've provided, and some information I found on HP's website, the mainboard has the Intel 945 chipset, which is Core 2 compatable in most all cases, and you said you have a Core 2 Duo currently installed (and working I would assume?)
which leads me to believe it might support the Quad Core, however there are other variables you should consider before going for a quad core, like the power supply and case cooling.
