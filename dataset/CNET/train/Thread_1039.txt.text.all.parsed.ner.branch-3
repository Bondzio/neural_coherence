5257	10	541694	5204592	5204289	mwooge	9/17/11 9:45 am	1.3162527e12	i do either of two things.	if i'm going somewhere for several hours i turn off my computer. otherwise i leave it on, letting the screen saver look for extraterrestrial life (seti).

(not to mention the other problem they are having with it- &quot;tin whiskers&quot; breaking off and straying into circuitry and shorting out- the military has lost quite a few missiles and at least one new satellite due to this, they say it's like ticking time bombs everywhere) the original design of the xbox360 has a reputation of &quot;not if it will break... but when&quot; and they've tracked it down now to the similar issue of excessive chassis heat causing the circuit board to expand and fracture the lead free solder. (fwiw you can make a pc last damn near forever if you don't mind fan noise. take out your oem case fan and install an industrial quality squirrel cage blower- i.e; ebm pabst, comair rotron, etc, cheap surplus. blowers make positive air pressure, fans do not. this will evacuate heat from the case like mad.)

5257	17	541694	5205379	5205344	oterrya	9/18/11 10:13 pm	1.31638398e12	wow	do you listen to yourself? you must be on a terabyte network link. my updates takemuch longer that 12 seconds to download -- installation time is minimal by comparison. you did not mention daily backups -- they take me from 5 minutes to many times that (depending on how active i have been the previous day). yes, having ssd all around would speed this up somewhat. how about cost? to implement ssd on my machines would require about 15 tb of it in two 7.5 tb bundles for backups plus about 5 tb for individual machines. i do not want to sell my house to buy this stuff. maybe someday it will be priced at a satisfacory level. i did not mention the major database updates that can occur when i am away by my merely staging the data. no matter what the drive speed, i would not like waiting for these either. please do not assume that a ssd solution that works for you will work for everyone. i looked at it. it will not work for me for several reasons. .t.

5257	19	541694	5205448	5204289	wbowblis	9/19/11 6:33 am	1.31641398e12	hibernating	i usually hibernate the computers that i or my wife use a lot. i used to do a shut-down, but hibernate is faster on both start-up and shut-down, and you can leave some programs running, even with files open. i do a full restart once every week or two, but this is usually forced by an update, so it usually isn't really a choice. the computers that i use less, i shut down. in all cases, once the computer finishes it's shut-down or hibernate, i cut the power to them via the switch box they are plugged into. makes no sense to pay for power to a computer that you are not currently using. at work, i just log off except on weekends and holidays, when i shut down fully, including disconnecting power using a switch box. the switch boxes include surge suppressors, but nothing is 100% effective and we have enough power interruptions to be concerned what the power does on being restored.
5257	20	541694	5205476	5204289	fahrm	9/19/11 7:36 am	1.31641776e12	hibernate (i think)	i have to use the moon button on my keyboard rather than shut down (which i would prefer to save electricity), because when i do a shut down or reboot i always get a &quot;warning; intuder detected&quot; so a reset is necessary to bypass that. if i use the keyboard button (which sounds like a shut down, since computer is silent) i rarely have this problem. all else works fine, so i will leave it that way.
