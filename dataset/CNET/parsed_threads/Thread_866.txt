<s> Alright, I'm building my firsy system, but I have been researching the crap out of all of my parts, so I have it down to the model number on everything except for the graphics card. </s>
<s> I am a college student, so budget is important, but I have a decent amount of money to play around with. </s>
<s> Here is the rig: Athlon 64 3500+ Socket 939 Asus A8N-E Motherboard (not looking for SLI) 1 GB OCZ DDR-400 Performance Enhanced Latency at 2-3-2-6 250 GB Hitachi Deskstar 7200rpm SATA 3.0GB/s Hard drive Cooler Master Praetorian Case Antec NeoPower 480W Power Supply Lite-On DVD Burner I wanted to spend about $300 on a video card. </s>
<s> So far as I can tell, the cards I would get the most out of with my set up are: Radeon X800XL 256, Geforce 6800 GT or any other cards around that range. </s>
<s> Now, if I buck the extra 50 bucks to go up to a Radeon X850XT, will it be worth it in terms of performance? </s>
<s> Another question is with the amount I want to spend on a video card (NOT $400+ for something like a 7800) would I be better off lowering my CPU to an Athlon 64 3000+ and just going for the 400-500 dollar card? </s>
<s> The goal here is being able to play any new games that come out on damn good video settings, like F.E.A.R. </s>
<s> and Call of Duty 2. </s>
<s> Doom 3 and Halflife 2 are afterthoughts to me, so they should be able to be played with ZERO problem. </s>
<s> so dont buy ati. </s>
<s> the 6800gt would be great. </s>
<s> I'm a little wary of getting a 6800GT. </s>
<s> I keep reading reviews on Newegg for several different manufacturers and it seems people either say it performs great, or they say they have a ton of problems with it, there isn't a lot of middle ground. </s>
<s> Cooling these things seems to be an issue too, and while I won't have a problem putting on an aftermarket cooler, I don't exactly want to do that, then have the card crap out, then be stuck with no video card due to voiding my warranty! </s>
<s> I can't afford it. </s>
<s> I might go with a 7800 </s>
