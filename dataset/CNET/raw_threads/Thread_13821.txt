Does a wireless router (thinking of the Linksys 54G) need to be wired to at least one computer? Or can it ''standalone'' and be installed away from a computer? In another room for example. I know it needs to be hardwired for initial setup, but can it then be transferred and be 100% wireless after install?

I went out and bought Linksys 54gs, PCI card. I set it up as per the instructions (?). The router is in the parish house and the remote is in the church office. The distance between the two points is approximately 80 feet. The setup didn't work. I recheck the password, ddis and chanel with no results. I didn't put in to effect the security. I thought it is maybe out of transmitter limits, so I bought a range extender-same results. My question is: Is there a way to check the transmetter opower eminating from the router? If I got the gist of the range extenter, it receives from the route. With the results I got, I hard wired it and it is working fine. I, still want to go wireless.
