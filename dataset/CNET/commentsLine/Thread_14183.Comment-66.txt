i remember we had a xerox microcomputer at the health department.
as i understand the history they actually come up with the first gui..graphical user interface for the very young..that's anyone under 50. xerox gave up on it.
talk about a bad business decision.
my understanding is msdos and cpm stole a lot from unix which was a bell labs product.
remember when at&t owned or controlled the baby bells.
after divestiture came the cell phone companies the supposed demise of at&t.
now some of the behometh cell companies have crashed and burned and at&t is growing.
the baby bells merged.. what change a lifetime has seen?
