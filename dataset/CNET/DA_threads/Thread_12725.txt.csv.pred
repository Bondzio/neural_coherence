1.1.1	When trying to connect from my laptop to the network we set up on our D-Link router I get an error message that says & quot ; Windows was unable to find a certificate to log you on to the network [ SSID ] & quot ; My desktop that connects wirelessly and my roommates laptop do not experience this issue .	St
1.1.2	I 've searched the web and found various solutions like unchecking the certificate in the SSID 's properties and such .	St
1.1.3	The problem is though that in my list of wireless clients , the network does not show up as a WPA-PSK connection when it IS .	St
1.1.4	It shows the network and says ( WPA ) on my desktop , but this one has it configured as an open WEP connection .	St
1.1.5	If I go to the advance settings and try to manually enter it as a WPA and enter the password , it just wont connect .	St
1.1.6	I am COMPLETELY stumped as to why this wont work .	St
1.1.7	The internet works when I plug the laptop directly into the router , and when I remove security settings for the router .	St
1.1.8	Thing is ...	St
1.1.9	I live in a heavily populated college area where everyone is trying to steal peoples ' internet so I ca n't leave it unprotected .	St
1.1.10	Any suggestions would be appreciated , I feel like I 've tried EVERYTHING at this point .	Polite
1.1.11	( reinstalling my wireless network adapter software as well ) thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	Oops , sorry .	Polite
1.2.2	It appears the details are missing .	St
1.3.1	sorry that was dumb of me it 's a D-Link DIR-616 router I 'm running Windows XP on the affected Laptop and the network adapter is a D-Link DWL-G630 also this computer and network adapter both work fine if trying to connect to any other wireless network so it 's not like faulty hardware is an issue .	St
1.4.1	It looks like you set it up for a radius server .	St
1.4.2	But I ca n't tell yet .	St
1.4.3	Focus on the router and be sure the router firmware is the latest since I 've seen this error where some machines connect and some do n't .	St
1.4.4	The poor owner could n't accept it was out of date firmware so they ended up paying 2 companies to come look .	St
1.4.5	The second one they let change the firmware .	St
1.4.6	They wanted a refund from us .	St
1.4.7	We said no .	Res
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	I do n't really know what that ( router firmware ) means or how to figure that out ... we did JUST get the router though .	St
1.5.2	I saw the settings on my router for the WPA Enterprise thing that said it uses a RADIUS , but that was not the option we selected .	St
1.5.3	Also how would that explain the reason my desktop connects wirelessly and it does n't support the certificate settings	St
1.6.1	It 's busted for sure .	St
1.6.2	Sorry but you may have to catch up on the wifi terminology and that & quot ; new & quot ; units ship with outdated firmware to solve this one .	St
1.6.3	Again , been that , done that and people are very confused about why it works on one machine but not the other and to them it looks like magic when I update the firmware , set it up and it works .	St
1.6.4	Do n't fret about it , people are making good money on this situation .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	how do I go about updating the firmware then ?	Ques
1.7.2	I 've never learned any of this stuff because I 've never had a problem connecting before ever but I feel confident that I can do it ...	St
1.7.3	I 'm definitely frustrated and determined .	St
1.8.1	1 .	St
1.8.2	You 've set it up our way at http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=264135 & messageID=2584349 which includes updating the router .	St
1.8.3	2 .	St
1.8.4	You found google.com and what others had to say about that message .	St
1.8.5	If so , it 's dead and needs to be seen by someone first hand .	St
1.8.6	Bob	St
1.9.1	Why would I not set up a router with the same name as your router ( you elected to not share router details such as your SSID , firmware version , etc . )	St
1.9.2	so I could confound and confuse that person and maybe get them off the air ?	Sug
1.9.3	I 'd like to help but your post details are weak .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	I did n't know anything about a firmware version until now .	St
1.10.2	my SSID is Three 's Company and the firmware version is 2.3	St
1.11.1	With some drivers .	St
1.11.2	Now go back to a simple 6 to 8 letter name with just ALPHA characters .	Sug
1.11.3	It 's not a bug you find everyday .	St
1.11.4	http : //www.dlink.com/products/support.asp ? pid=565 & pv=115 & sec=0 notes a 2.23 but no 2.3 .	St
1.11.5	I 'd install their latest at 2.24 to make sure you have all the fixes they give us .	St
1.11.6	I 'll use the manual from ftp : //ftp.dlink.com/Gateway/dir615_revB/Manual/dir615_revB_manual_220.zip See page 76 .	St
1.11.7	Is this the setting you used ?	Ques
1.11.8	Bob	St
1.12.1	I tried earlier plugging my laptop directly into the router and attempting to update the firmware .	St
1.12.2	I downloaded the latest version 2.24 and when I attempted to open the file on the router page to load the new firmware version , it did n't work and told me that the version I was attempting to upload may be corrupt and that the gateway would not be updated .	St
1.12.3	I will attempt to change the SSID to something more simple .	St
1.13.1	If downloads are showing up corrupt I 'd be scanning that machine for : a ) Download accelerators .	St
1.13.2	b ) Limewire .	St
1.13.3	c ) P2P programs .	St
1.13.4	d ) Winsock hijackers ( see our SPYWARE FORUM ) and other things .	St
1.13.5	Good hunting .	St
1.13.6	Bob	St
