<s> Which one would you get AMD Athlon 64 X2 or Intel Core(TM)2 Duo. </s>
<s> tomshardware.com you can take the CPU comparison for a spin then decide for yourself. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hp has a few pavillions that are just about identical except for the platform (intel vs amd). </s>
<s> for the same price, an athlon x2 4800+/5000+ pc is a faster choice than a core2duo e4300/e4400/e6300/e6320. </s>
<s> The two computers I was looking at were HP a6030n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core processor 4800+ Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE HP a1740n with Intel Core2 Duo processor E6300 Graphics Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 The pice difference is $5.00 </s>
<s> here's a comparison of a HP Pavilion a1630n (Athlon 64 X2 4600+) and a HP Pavilion a1640n (Core2Duo E6300). </s>
<s> http://www.sharkyextreme.com/hardware/article.php/3673796 The X2 4800+ will give you slightly better performance than the E6300. </s>
<s> Definitely AMD one ! </s>
<s> I own both AMD & Intel ... they are now 8 months old, & I Bet the AMD is still as fast as it was the first day ! </s>
<s> & ya, AMD has worked a lot on Heat produced by the processor. </s>
<s> That does it all ! </s>
<s> Battlefield for instance is a non-starter. </s>
<s> So unless you put in some 3D card that system is not so good. </s>
<s> It has the better CPU according to the charts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> MMMM i would go for the hp HP a6030n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core processor 4800+ Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE First th processor is the same speed it may differ a little bit but the Intel graphics arent recommended however i experiences the 6150 LE video card and it can run new games with considerble graphics but look if u are looking for gaming i dont recommend HP </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=2802&p=5 the e6300 'wins' most SYSmark timings compared to a 4600+, but in 80% of the other benchmarks, an x2 4600+ is equal to or faster an e6300. </s>
<s> so an x2 4800+ is definitely faster than a e6300 (though the difference won't be noticeable in typical activities.) </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> : tomshardware has never included the e6300 in its charts. </s>
<s> How do the 2 units compare for total Watts? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I used toms before and scaled it around near enough CPUs. </s>
<s> My results were too close to call and given the difference in Watts I gave my nod to the C2D. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> performance per watt is about the only area that amd has a consistent lead of intel. </s>
<s> Thanks for the update. </s>
<s> I was in the same quandary just last week for the same two desktops. </s>
<s> I even bought the 6030 but returned as soon as i found an open box at Sams Club for an HPm7767c, E6600 processor, 2 gigs ram, 600 gb harddrive, nvidia 7500, and a 22 inch monitor for a spanking 849.99!!! </s>
<s> The the e6300 beats the amd in many areas, and vice versa. </s>
<s> but i still would have gone with the amd for its more stylish casing, graphics card, and faster baseline processor speed. </s>
