My latest attemplt to install Realtek AC'97 WHQL driver onto a Dell Dimension 3000 always results in a Blue Screen Of Death (due to device driver conflict).
I downloaded the newest version of the driver from Realtek website.
During installation, it says if I want to continue since this driver is not digitally signed by Realtek.
Having read the read-me on Realtek website, I clicked : Continue Anyway.
It continues for a little more and then gives me a blue screen of death.
Attempts to try different drivers does not help.
My Windows XP Home installation was new.
What can be the cause of the problem?
