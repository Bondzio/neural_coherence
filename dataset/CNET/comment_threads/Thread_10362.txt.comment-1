I have a server MB Asus DSEB-DG.
It has two PCI-Express slots, and other slots also.
It comes with two marvell 88se6145 raid controllers built on the motherboard.
The issue is that when I use a PCI-express Video card.
I cannot get in the Marvell raid controller BIOS during startup (CTRL-M) to set up the raid.
I have also tried using many different PCI-Express video cards but same results.
When I use a video card in any regular PCI slot or use the one built on motherboard the BIOS option for marvell to set up the raid works fine.
I am just guessing that there must be something in the main BIOS that I can tune so that I get the option during startup for Raid setup when using PCI-Express slot in my case for Graphics card.
Any tip would be nice.
