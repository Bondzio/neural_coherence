<s> Hello, I am building a system and I am not sure what motherboard to buy. </s>
<s> I am thinking about getting an intel motherboard Core i7. </s>
<s> I am not sure which motherboard to go for. </s>
<s> To give you a better Idea. </s>
<s> I don't play games. </s>
<s> I need a computer for music production. </s>
<s> Here are a few that I have been looking at EVGA ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188039 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188046 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx? </s>
<s> Item=N82E16813188049) Any others you might recommend? </s>
<s> Should I go AMD Route? </s>
<s> Realistically, I don't want to spend over $200 if possible, but if people are for the EVGA then I might just do it. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your time </s>
<s> are considerably more expensive than Socket 775 systems. </s>
<s> Not sure the extra $$ gives proportionate increase in performance for most. </s>
<s> Core i7 MBs start at $200 and go to $400 and the CPUs start about $275 unless you live near a MicroCenter where they're sometimes on sale for $200. </s>
<s> Here's a socket 775 MB with decent rating from buyers.and it's $115 after rebate. </s>

<s> Do you think it is better to go to a DDR3 motherboard than a DDR2? </s>
<s> I use music producing software and I need to make sure I can use this with out my computer bogging down. </s>
<s> When it comes to CPU's it doesn't have to be the Core i7, I will consider the ones before that as long as my computer can handle my music production software, so it doesn't bogg down my computer. </s>
<s> Then I am fine. </s>
<s> Is Gigabyte Motherboard the way to go? </s>
<s> Asus? </s>
<s> EVGA? </s>
<s> Hello, I am building a new system and I am not sure which route to take in terms of which motherboard, processor etc. </s>
<s> Here is some info on what I am building a computer for...I am building this computer for music production and not gaming. </s>
<s> Software I use is FL Studio and Protools as well as plugging in instruments to the computer for recording. </s>
<s> I need a computer system that won't bogg down when I have all these softwares and plug-ins open. </s>
<s> I would like to get the Core i7 processor, but not sure if I should go for it or not. </s>
<s> Should I go the AMD Route? </s>
<s> It seems more affordable to go for the AMD Route. </s>
<s> If I go with the AMD I am thinking about this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103674 Then comes to the motherboard. </s>
<s> I am really not sure which one to decide on. </s>
<s> Here are a few brands I have been looking at are EVGA, Gigabyte and ASUS. </s>
<s> What about other brands like Intel, Foxconn, MSI, DFI? </s>
<s> When it comes to memory should I stick with DDR2 or DDR3? </s>
<s> I have some wish list categories. </s>
<s> Jeff's Computer Build = Stuff I already have and purchased { http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=8883254 } Jeff's Future Build = Stuff I am thinking about buying. </s>
<s> { http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=11217152 } Other Case Considerations = Other cases I am thinking about. </s>
<s> { http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=10509211 } So, I still need Motherboard, Processor, Sound Card, Memory. </s>
<s> I am looking to spend $500 more, but no more than $600. </s>
<s> Few notes:For the Case, I am leaning towards the Azza Solano 1000 and for the Video card I bought from Best Buy the VisionTek HD 4350 ATI Radeon Video Card, should I keep or upgrade it? </s>
<s> For Sound card people have recommended M-Audio an EMU for music production, What do you guys think? </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your time </s>
<s> OK, so a quick Google search on ProTools and FL Studio show that they are multi-threaded, but, to be perfectly honest, they don't go into a lot of detail. </s>
<s> It was literally one line in FL Studios feature list and a few forum posting describing multi-threaded-ness on ProTools. </s>
<s> So, I would definitely get a quad, but I think you knew that already. </s>
<s> The part I'm debating is AMD/Intel quad. </s>
<s> From my research, ProTools seems to work rather nicely with i7's, with a certain bench (Dverbs, if you've heard of it) it gets twice the score than a Q6600. </s>
<s> If I were you, I would go i7. </s>
<s> But, realize, you'll need DDR3. </s>
<s> Core i7 can ONLY take DDR3, no DDR2 here. </s>
<s> For the best performance with i7, we do want triple-channel memory. </s>
<s> I'm not fully versed on the performance benefits from double to triple-channel, but the prices are close enough and i7 has a memory controller built for triple-channel, so why go slower? </s>
<s> And, like I said, prices are close. </s>
<s> Do you plan to overclock? </s>
<s> If so, I would go for one of those cases. </s>
<s> But if you aren't, you don't *NEED* the cooling that those cases give and a cheaper case will suffice. </s>
<s> But, here's the rub. </s>
<s> The cheapest i7 is $280. </s>
<s> An i7 motherboard will run you $200 or more, a few dipping into the high 100's. </s>
<s> Memory (6GB, triple channel) will be another $100. </s>
<s> If you're counting right, we're at $580 and we haven't even bought the sound card, which sounds pretty important considering the tools you're using. </s>
<s> We can dip down into Intel quad's or AMD's quads, but the i7 may be a bit out of your price range. </s>
<s> Both AMD/Intel quads are great. </s>
<s> AMD has cheaper motherboards and are a little more overclocking friendly, but Intel's quads are faster per-clock than AMDs. </s>
<s> A 3.2GHz AMD (Phenom II 955) is a bit slower than the Q9650 (3.0GHz). </s>
<s> Research your tools a bit, see what other people are using them with. </s>
<s> Some tools, unfortunately, are highly biased to one architecture or another. </s>
<s> See if there are any anomalies there. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> Your i7 MB is going $200-$300 .... $250-$275 for the CPU.....$100 for the RAM and then there's the video card. </s>

<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your reply. </s>
<s> Affordability and espcially I am not a gamer, I am really leaning towards AMD Phenom, what I mentioned in my post. </s>
<s> I don't plan on overclocking. </s>
<s> Here is my First Mock Build and can be subjected to change. </s>
<s> Case wise, I am still deciding on the Azzan and Antec 1200. http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=11224712 Let me know your thoughts on the build so far. </s>

<s> Thanks for the links, Ramarc. </s>
<s> Now only a bit more so I don't feel bad about buying one for me, lol! </s>
<s> I just built an AMD Phenom system last week, though it was the dual-core version: Phenom II X2 550, 3.1GHz. </s>
<s> Thing absolutely roared; and for the price? </s>
<s> Heck yes. </s>
<s> Build looks great, though I might make a few changes: The 955 is the fastest Phenom available,true, but you're definitely paying quite a premium for it. </s>
<s> If it were up to me, I would go for the 940. </s>
<s> It's at 3.0GHz instead of the 955's 3.2GHz. </s>
<s> But, it is still a Black Edition CPU, meaning it has an unlocked multiplier. </s>
<s> That means it is DEAD-simple to overclock. </s>
<s> I would get the Phenom II 940, save $56, go into your BIOS and change the multiplier from 15 to 16. </s>
<s> BAM: you get a 955 for free. </s>
<s> I highly doubt you'll have to do any voltage tweaks at all. </s>
<s> No need to fuss with memory multipliers or HTT multipliers: change one number and you're golden. </s>
<s> I would personally change the RAM to this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148261 What do you get for an extra $5? </s>
<s> Tighter timings (CAS6 versus CAS8) and cool lights! </s>
<s> Check out the video review in it's review section. </s>
<s> CAS latency isn't a big performance gain, but it can help, especially in memory-intensive applications. </s>
<s> Not sure if yours falls under that. </s>
<s> But, darn, those lights are too cool. </s>
<s> Now we HAVE to get a case with a window, lol! </s>
<s> The links you posted are truncated; they've been cut short. </s>
<s> Can you try pasting them again? </s>
<s> I'm the wrong guy to ask about sound cards: I use onboard and can't tell the difference since the day I threw out my Creative card. </s>
<s> I will tell you this, though: the X-Fi chipset is mainly targeted toward gamers and the like. </s>
<s> E-MU and M-Audio are targeted for professionals. </s>
<s> I'd just go with the one that fits your budget AND (more importantly) has all the connections you'll need. </s>
<s> And then some. </s>
<s> You realize these are full-towers, right? </s>
<s> I have a Coolermaster Stacker 830 (big boy, trust me) and it's huge. </s>
<s> Like, no mid-tower compares. </s>
<s> Just trust me. </s>
<s> Think big. </s>
<s> Then go two more steps. </s>
<s> That's a full tower. </s>
<s> In my opinion, I'd go with the AZZA. </s>
<s> Never heard of them, but it has good reviews. </s>
<s> You get a bigger side fan and it's a whole lot cheaper. </s>
<s> And who doesn't love 230mm fans?! </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> Hi Ibrahim, The links I have posted are working. </s>

<s> { http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=10509211 } Thank you for the CPU insight. </s>
<s> I will look into it. </s>
<s> Yeah, I realize it is a full tower case. </s>
<s> I measured it and yes it is larger than my mid tower, but the only difference is the height, which is 16 on my midtower and 22 on the full tower. </s>
<s> Yes it is taller, but still fits in my work space. </s>
<s> My mid tower is 20 is length or width what ever you call it and 8 inches from side to side. </s>
<s> On the ones I picked it is about the same as those dimensions. </s>
<s> Should work out ok. </s>
<s> If it turns out to be too big for my tastes, can I return to new egg with out a problem? </s>
<s> I will check out as well. </s>
<s> Thank you again for your help. </s>
<s> Any thing else let me know. </s>
<s> I should have some questions in a bit. </s>
<s> I was actually referring to the RAM you linked me, but I still like the one's I linked, unless you need a lower price? </s>
<s> Oh, yeah. </s>
<s> Newegg has a fantastic RMA program. </s>
<s> I'd much rather deal with Newegg than a company. </s>
<s> I looked through the case choices again and I really like the AZZA. </s>
<s> The others are too expensive, IMO, for what you get, but I'm not one to talk with a $220 case. </s>
<s> But the AZZA looks like it has the good stuff: removable mobo tray, good fans, nice exterior design. </s>
<s> It isn't tool-less, but I find the trusting reassurance of a tightened screw a bit more satisfying than the promise of wimpy plastic. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> Thank you once again. </s>
<s> Sweet. </s>
<s> I am going to get the Azza case. </s>
<s> Those RAM's are for Intel motherboards, so I am no longer looking at those. </s>
<s> I thought about that too. </s>
<s> Yeah, Tooless is easier, but those thumb screws are not bad either. </s>
<s> So, this looks like my final build http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=11224712 . </s>
<s> I will make my final decision by the weekend for sure. </s>
<s> If you or anyone else has any recomendations please let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> It looks good. </s>
<s> RAM, actually, isn't &quot;for&quot; a certain brand. </s>
<s> RAM will work as long as it has the same subsystem (DDR2, DDR3, etc) in any system. </s>
<s> Speeds don't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo (SPD) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs. </s>
<s> Looks nice from my end. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> It looks like I will need to upgrade my operating system from XP Professsional to a 64 bit Operating System, so I can take full advantage of the memory. </s>
<s> Which one should I consider Windows XP Professional 64 bit Windows Vista Pro 64 bit Windows 7 RC 64 bit Thank you. </s>
<s> But the big issue for most is drivers. </s>
<s> In order from most lacking in my experience (drivers from makers) is this order. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> (don't expect drivers from maker) Windows 7 RC 64 bit 2. </s>
<s> (hit and miss support from makers) Windows XP Professional 64 bit 3. </s>
<s> (can usually find or get an answer about the driver) Windows Vista Pro 64 bit After 7 ships you can </s>
<s> After 7 ships then you can ask the makers for drivers. </s>
<s> For now I've found in many cases the Vista driver works (if there is one.) </s>
<s> So, you think I should just upgrade to vista 64 then? </s>
<s> And if you preorder the WIN7 upgrade now, it will only cost $99. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832116676 $149.99 VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I am hoping to make a decsion on my system by the end of the weekend. </s>
<s> When you said: &quot;Speeds don't even matter because they have built-in specs that work with any mobo (SPD) but may have to be adjusted to get to the actual specs.&quot; How do you do that? </s>
<s> How do you adjust the specs to get the actuals? </s>
<s> I think I will order the discounted Windows 7 and download the Windows 7 64bit RC for free. </s>
<s> I won't do it until I check with my software specs to see if it can. </s>
<s> I havn't had time to do it yet. </s>
<s> I won't count out the Windows Vista either. </s>
<s> I have to think about it further. </s>
<s> Hello everyone, I have decided on the Core i7. </s>
<s> I found a great deal at Microcenter for $199, so that was the decider. </s>
<s> Some of you who recommended things to me, I am not sure if some of them will be right for the Core i7. </s>
<s> If you can update your recommendations, I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> I will reread as well. </s>

<s> Another update. </s>
<s> I bought the Window7 Prof upgrade from Amazon.com because I happened to get the promotion price at $99 upgrade of win 7. </s>
<s> Since I decided to late, I wasn't able to get the deal thru Newegg.com. </s>
<s> I happended to put it in the shopping cart before it expired and happened to go back to amazon.com and I realized it was still there. </s>
<s> So, done deal. </s>
<s> I will go with the RC Version and once I get the retail version of Win 7 I will upgrade from there. </s>
<s> One thing I am not sure about is, which it doesn't state on the website that if it is 64 bit or not. </s>
<s> Does Win 7 come in both 32 or 64 bit? </s>
<s> I will probably have to send an email to Amazon.com to find out. </s>
<s> So, once again I am going to go with the Windows 7 RC version. </s>
<s> I have heard enough good stuff about it that I am willing to go this route. </s>
