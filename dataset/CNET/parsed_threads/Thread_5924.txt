<s> Troughout the past week my computer kept freezing every once in a while when playing World of Warcraft. </s>
<s> I would have to restart my computer after the picture froze. </s>
<s> Just today I was playing when suddenly the computer just turned off. </s>
<s> I went to turn it on again and it will not power up. </s>
<s> No lights, no fans, nothing. </s>
<s> I figured maybe the power supply was dead, which would have explained the strange freezes I was getting throughout the week. </s>
<s> I switched power supplies with an older computer and found the same results. </s>
<s> The power supply that I thought was dead was working fine on the older computer, and my newer computer still had nothing. </s>
<s> I tried switching the graphics cards with the same results, the graphics card works fine on the other computer. </s>
<s> I don't think its the memory because the computer isnt even starting up. </s>
<s> Seems like its a power problem, yet the power supply appears to be working fine on other computers. </s>
<s> Could my motherboard have died out on me? </s>
<s> I'm using an ASUS P5B-E motherboard and have had it for 6 months before these problems started. </s>
<s> CPU is a Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas on how I should go about troubleshooting this? </s>
<s> Any help would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Have you checked to see if the CPU Fan is working, could be that the CPU over-heated and shut down, the same could also be true of the memory? </s>

<s> Don't discount the RAM.In spite of what you said, the same happened to my computer-just stopped working, would not power up etc.After trying everything, including numerous E-mails and help from HP,I eventually removed one of the Ram modules, and hey presto it worked! </s>
