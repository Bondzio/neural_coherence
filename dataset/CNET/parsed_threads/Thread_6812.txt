<s> I've been trying off and on for a week to get this thing to work. </s>
<s> First I followed the instructions to the T, 10 times. </s>
<s> Then I did a firm ware rev. </s>
<s> The thing wouldn't let connect to internet on the host computer! </s>
<s> But the connection was on. </s>
<s> On the wireless computer I got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet. </s>
<s> Next I attached a Linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back. </s>
<s> Then I hooked the 624 to the linsky router. </s>
<s> Now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I tried to go into the installtion URL, http://192.168.0.1, but the operation &quot;times out&quot; every time. </s>
<s> I almost got the thing to connect but the error message said there was a network address conflict. </s>
<s> I'm running an AMD64 3200, with 1G of ram with Win XPPro. </s>
<s> I stay in Germany using ADSL from Telecom. </s>
<s> Can anybody pllllease help. </s>

<s> A confusing statement, clarification is needed. </s>
<s> How many computers are on this LAN and how do they connect. </s>
<s> &quot;Next I attached a Linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back. </s>
<s> Then I hooked the 624 to the linsky router. </s>
<s> Now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet.&quot; This is where it gets muddy when you put two routers together. </s>
<s> Simplify this network down to one router and give D-Link tech support a call. </s>
<s> I have one of these devices. </s>
<s> After I bought it I went through the same thing you are going through. </s>
<s> I could not get it to connect wirelessly (even with all of the up dates) or wired to other DLink devices. </s>
<s> I finally ended up giving it away to a friend that owns a coffee house for use as an internet access point for customers. </s>
<s> He has to reboot it about 6 times a day to even get it to work as an access point (not even as a router). </s>
<s> If you can return it your should return as soon as possible and replace it the Belkin 125 unit. </s>
<s> I worked with the DI624 for about 2 months and it NEVER worked right. </s>
<s> I've got 3 Belkin Wireless units and have not had any trouble with them. </s>
<s> One of them (802.11b) has been running now without reboot for about 18 months. </s>
<s> They are easy to set up and they WORK. </s>
