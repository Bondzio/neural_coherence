bought a 250 gb maxtor hard drive, within a year it started making loud clicking noises, does not allow me to connect or read data.
customer support can only replace the drive and cannot retreive the data.
all my data is lost.
you spend $70-100 only to loose data or to pay more for data retreival softwares.
if you are lucky, you will get you data back.
will not buy it again nor recommend to anyone.
