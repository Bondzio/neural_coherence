thanks for your answer.
i am actually located in europe.
they know i have a wifi internet connection as i sit on the porch and do work.
saying no is also pretty much impossible as they have helped me out quite a few times.
&lt;div&gt; so in order to limit the bandwith i allocate to them i have to get a new router?
no other easier way?
&lt;/div&gt;
