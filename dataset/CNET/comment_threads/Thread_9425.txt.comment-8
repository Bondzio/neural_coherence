Then you are in good shape!
Congratulations.
By the way, I am not trying to sell anything, I have no affiliation with this company whatsoever, just trying to put out some sort of viable response that makes sense.
In my case, I need the shield for WiFi access and was happy to find a free option for Mac OS X.
You mention a firewall but that is not the issue here, so I don't think we are on the same wavelength.
Besides, the product is free anyway, so selling is would be a misnomer.
If you don't like the program, don't use it, and do your own research.
