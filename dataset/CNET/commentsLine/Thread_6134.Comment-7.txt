but i am not eligible to download windows xp mode with windows 7 home premium.
vuescan seems very good but i must weigh this against the cost of a brand new printer/scanner for about 50. you are right about about the compatibility cost of windows 7. i lost adobe photoshop, corel draw, videocam look, greeting card magic and canon zoom browser does not link to pictures.
all these were working well on xp so i seem to be paying the price of getting up to date.
