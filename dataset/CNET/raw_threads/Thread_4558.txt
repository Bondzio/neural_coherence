I want to get my nephew a tablet for his 13th birthday, but do not want to spend $300.00 for one. I know this limits my choice a lot, but I think it is the best way to go. I have been looking at the Kindle Fire, Nook Tablet, Blackberry Playbook and the Acer Iconia Tablet A100-07U08U. This bring me between $200 and $250 which is a good price. It does not need to be an extensive tablet just something he can facebook, games and surf the net on. Any suggestions would be great, I am flexible with the OS and am not a hater of other stuff. Thanks

It's 199 and if you get lucky Amazon has refurbished units once in awhile. http://www.phonearena.com/news/Refurbished-Kindle-Fire-goes-on-sale-for-139_id28563 Frankly I think you should not invest too much on these. Yes, we have them but we don't use them much. Bob

However, if the 13 year old would like a camera on the tablet, then don't get the Kindle Fire since it has no cameras. I know the Lenovo has both a front and rear camera and is the same price as the Kindle Fire. Unless one roots the Kindle or the Nook, I think, they only have access to either Amazon's or B&N&quot;s app stores. The Acer and Lenovo have access to the Android Market. One can also install the Kindle and Nook readers on these to read their books and such.
