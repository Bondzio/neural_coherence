gee mingo, i didn't mean to hit a nerve here!
i know the card is old but i have dim 4400 that is almost that old and that card was supposed to be good in it's day.
i don't do games and i can't swing a new computer right now but my current video card is a rage 128 with a whole 16mb of memory.
all i want is a card that will update my video without causing a power supply crash.
there isn't much to choose from with agp 2x.
is the x1650xt an ati card?
i also head a geforce fx5500 will also work in my 4400. any help is appreciated.
