It will state the &quot;specs&quot; of your system and what ram it takes and the max. amount too. The quick and cheap way is to visit http://www.crucial.com and see what they state for your system. The possibility exists you may need SDR vs DDR ram, but that's an if only until you check. tada -----Willy

You can watch the boot screen to see the amount and type of memory that is detected at boot. That said, if you've never install memory, there are precautions that must be taken. Here's a link to one set of instructions, but there are many more found with Google. http://www.webtechgeek.com/How-to-Install-Memory.htm
