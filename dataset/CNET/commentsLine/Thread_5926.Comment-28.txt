the computer i'm using right now has a floppy drive.
i work tomorrow until 7 eastern time so around 4 your time?
i'll check back in then.
i don't have a win98 disk.
the only diagnostics i could find wasn't for the model hard drive i have.
only ultrastar.
i have deskstar.
i'm pretty sure its 7k250 also.
however there was drive fitness test.
though it says that it can only be used with x86 processors.
i'm running pentuim 3 on the one i'm using now.
thank you for all your help i appreciate it.
