if we install anti-virus software on the intel mac, does it slow down the mac side?
the astro became unusable it was so slow and cumbersome (know that mac commercial making fun of the pc operating system asking permission with every keystroke?
it was like that).
i would hate to ruin the speed and ease of the mac.
about the customer site: since it is 98% of our business, it is the tail that wags the dog.
right now we access their website using ie6; they do not support the ie7 browser.
when their is group upgrades to ie7, they will no longer support ie6 connection, forcing us to up-grade too.
i think my husband figured out ie7 would require a more robust computer system or maybe a more up-to-date operating system.
for some reason, i think the astro will be unable to make the next upgrade.
thank you for your response.
