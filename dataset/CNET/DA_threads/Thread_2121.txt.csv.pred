1.1.1	System Information : ASUS M4A87TD Evo ( Motherboard ) AMD Phenom II x4 965 Black Edition ( CPU ) Radeon HD 4890 ( Graphics Card ) 8 GB Ripjaw Series ( Memory ) Prepare for an earful .	St
1.1.2	About 3 months ago my adventures with this computer started .	St
1.1.3	I had a couple of somewhat seasoned computer builders walking me through buying and putting together a computer .	St
1.1.4	I put it together and turned it on but the only reward I received for my effort were fans running .	St
1.1.5	I did n't get any picture on the screen nor any start-up/error beeps from my internal speaker .	St
1.1.6	I tried : with only one stick of memory , no memory ( trying to bait some error beeps ) , no graphics card , everything unplugged aside from the CPU and motherboard , but to no avail .	St
1.1.7	I did n't have many extra computer parts lying around to test against it but I was able to test a different graphics card in my motherboard and there was still nothing appearing on the screen or any error beeps .	St
1.1.8	The graphics card went back to it 's owner and he informed me it was still functional in his computer .	St
1.1.9	My friend and I then decided it was most likely the motherboard that was causing my issues and I RMA 'd it to ASUS and had a new one shipped to me .	St
1.1.10	I got it back and I was faced with the same issues I had been with the last motherboard .	St
1.1.11	I tried all my old trouble shooting attempts and I still get nothing .	St
1.1.12	No beeps , nothing but fans .	St
1.1.13	I do not understand why if everything in the world was broken why I would n't be getting error beeps unless the speaker itself was broken .	St
1.1.14	A few extra notes about the computer : The monitor is a VGA and the graphics card is a DVI so I had to use an adapter between the two which of course it 's possible that is the issue as well but it still does n't explain my lack of beeps .	St
1.1.15	I have to use an adapter for the power cord going to my graphics card too .	St
1.1.16	That is about every piece of information I can give you about this computer .	St
1.1.17	If you have any tips for trouble shooting , or perhaps are a miracle worker and can revive it with voodoo dolls , any help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.18	I do n't have access to any computer parts to test against it , not even the graphics card any more , so that is n't in my book of options right now .	St
1.1.19	If you know what the most likely culprit is and know what I should be replacing that would be useful knowledge as well .	St
1.1.20	Thank you for reading my long post and any information you have to give .	St
1.2.1	Okay I assemble Computers and I have had my share with hardware configuration problems .	St
1.2.2	When get my parts from the distributer , I check them .	St
1.2.3	I start in the following manner .	St
1.2.4	I install the processor on the motherboard with the heatsink .	St
1.2.5	Then put the memory in the slots .	St
1.2.6	Connect it to the monitor and Power Up .	St
1.2.7	If I get the MoBo logo and BIOS reading on the monitor I proceed further .	St
1.2.8	If not , I retrace my steps .	St
1.2.9	In your case , your Graphic card and MoBo came true ( seems to me ) .	St
1.2.10	Since you tested with both of your RAM sticks , it very unlikely that your both RAM sticks have gone bad at the same time .	St
1.2.11	It could be your processor , BUT , before your start ripping off your hardware to get to your CPU , I would STRONGLY suggest you to take a look at your Power Supply ( SMPS ) .	St
1.2.12	Make sure you are using one of a correct Wattage rating and of a reputable brand .	St
1.2.13	I have found cheap ones saying 650 Watt but they fail to even give 450 WAtt .	St
1.2.14	Looks to me as if you are having a & quot ; Brown Out & quot ; condition .	St
1.2.15	Hope this helps Sam	St
1.3.1	Following your suggestion , I think I will try buying a new power supply first .	St
1.3.2	It was given to me by a friend and it is n't new nor have I heard of the brand before so I suppose that could very likely be the issue .	St
1.3.3	Thank you for your input !	St
1.4.1	Since , you never got this system to run , then do n't trust adapters .	St
1.4.2	if you can at least test those elsewhere .	St
1.4.3	I do n't see why you need an adapter for the GPU power , most newer PSU have all the connectors needed , so either that 's an old PSU or definitively lacking the right connector , I would get a newer more wattage PSU to begin with and not a cheap one either or one you tested or trust .	St
1.4.4	Sadly , newer mtrbds .	St
1.4.5	need to be bios updated to improve its overall use .	St
1.4.6	But , you never got there , so its not booting or at least beeping .	St
1.4.7	Provided you know the spkr .	St
1.4.8	or & quot ; on-board & quot ; spkr .	St
1.4.9	is working it should have beeped .	St
1.4.10	All you need to test on a simple level is the mtrbd .	St
1.4.11	by itself and PSU attached .	St
1.4.12	Short the ON/OFF connection pins and it should beep away or spin up and then down .	St
1.4.13	You can remove the bios chip itself if socketed and then beep or at least have the small LED glow .	St
1.4.14	Also , the fan can be the chassis or CPU fan by itself , no cpu , nothing , no ram , nothing .	St
1.4.15	What are the results ?	Ques
1.4.16	If you still get no beeps or fan running , then return for money back no need to fight anymore to make it work .	St
1.4.17	Make darn sure any jumper or sting are proper if applicable on the mtrbd.. Use the CMOS clearing to return to system defaults and try again .	St
1.4.18	Having access to another PC as test bed would have helped , but since it never worked and clues are sparse , it gets to be more of guessing .	St
1.4.19	That 's why you need to to test and verify this or that as complete new items are n't always compatible or more is needed .	St
1.4.20	I certainly get a new capable PSU at least for now .	St
1.4.21	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Your post does n't tell enough but there are a few clues here .	St
1.5.2	1 .	St
1.5.3	You might have recycled another power supply and it does not meet the needs of this CPU and board .	St
1.5.4	2 .	St
1.5.5	I see this has a 4 pin ATXV connection .	St
1.5.6	The symptoms are what happens with that is not plugged in .	St
1.5.7	3 .	St
1.5.8	Some boards come jumpered in clear cmos and wo n't start .	St
1.5.9	4 .	St
1.5.10	One board had a typo in the book about the reset connection .	St
1.5.11	Long story short is the motherboard printing was correct .	St
1.5.12	Bob	St
