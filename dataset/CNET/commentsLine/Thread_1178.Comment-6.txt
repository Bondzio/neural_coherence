many thanks for the thorough explanations.
i have our router set to provide dynamic addressing in the range 192.168.1.100-119. does this mean that i can use addresses from 192.168.1.120-254 (and/or .1.2-99 for that matter) for static addressing and the devices at those addresses will also be seen on the network?
thanks again.
