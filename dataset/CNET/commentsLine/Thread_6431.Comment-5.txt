hi mate, well it is now sorted, what i did is connect the router to the modem as stated (make sure your modem is on when you power it back up as some go in to standby).
then i connected a lan cable to the modem and logged in to it that way, then i ran the wizard and hey presto it works!!
maybe this will work for you as well!
regards, bigg.....
