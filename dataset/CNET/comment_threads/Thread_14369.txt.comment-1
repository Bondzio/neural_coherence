My socket 775 motherboard died about three months ago (verified by the Geek Squad at Best Buy), and my hubby purchased a replacement on Ebay.
I was planning to install it myself, but he claims we have to download all sorts of drivers and involves more than either of us can handle.
He purchased the board without consulting me, but claims he verified with the seller that everything should match.
The computer is custom-built (from a barebones kit), Windows XP Pro, DDR.
It was built by an acquaintance, but we live more than two hours away now, and none of the local computer shops have good reputations.
Please let me know what's involved and whether I should try installing the motherboard myself.
I've installed and formatted a hard drive, and stuck extra memory chips into the motherboard, but wouldn't consider myself a computer whiz by any stretch of the imagination.
Many thanks.
