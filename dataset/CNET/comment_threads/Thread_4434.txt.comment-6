Also any setting OTHER than SSID broadcast enabled and WPA?
Some routers seem to have problems when I turn on NAT filtering or &quot;other.&quot; Please start telling all.
It is too much work for me to ask every detail.
This is not tech support but you and I discussing it.
Just like non-paid support, you have to get out and push.
