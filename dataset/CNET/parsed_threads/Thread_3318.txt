<s> Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop, Windows XP home, been using a Linksys WRT54GS router with speed booster for a little less than a year. </s>
<s> Also have a Dell PC wired into the router. </s>
<s> That connection is for the most part consistent, yet a power cycle must go down a few times a week. </s>
<s> But the real issue is my laptop. </s>
<s> I used to have a very consistent and fast connection throughout my home. </s>
<s> Most importantly, my bedroom which is a floor above the router. </s>
<s> Lately, all has become hell. </s>
<s> I have a very inconsistent connection with my laptop. </s>
<s> And now, I either get no connection in my bedroom, or an extremely weak signal. </s>
<s> Trying to upgrade the firmware (which has been a headache in itself). </s>
<s> I've read a TON lately on how this specific model tends to be a terrible router. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> On the verge of picking up a DLink 655 Extreme Gigabit N router, even though my laptop runs on a G network. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> I'm tired of not having consistent internet! </s>
<s> Especially in my bedroom!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Is it setup per our forum sticky? </s>
<s> Maybe try this page. </s>
<s> http://www.linksysfix.com/check/HomePage/index.htm?callerID=WS I've got the very same router as you on XP pro with one other desktop and a Dell Inspiron 1100. </s>
<s> I've had no problems with this router for the past 6 months, and no problems upgrading the firmware. </s>
<s> It could also be the network adapter in your laptop ----- not the router. </s>
<s> I wish I had an answer for you. </s>
<s> You'll discover it's one very nice router. </s>
<s> It is set up per the sticky. </s>
<s> I tried that link zmark provided. </s>
<s> I downloaded the Easylink Firmware tool. </s>
<s> To upgrade the firmware, I was prompted to plug the ethernet cable (from the back of my wired computer) into the laptop itself, with the other end already in &quot;port 1&quot;. </s>
<s> Well, the router never recognized the ethernet cable in port 1, so when i clicked to proceed forward, the router was not recognized, nothing happened, and I have the same problem. </s>
<s> I vaguely remember now when I first got the router, I went through the necessary steps with the router and the PC, did everything fine. </s>
<s> Then I just started up my laptop, it recognized the network created on my PC, and I just used the internet on my laptop that way. </s>
<s> However I have always received the following message when starting up my laptop: &quot;Duplicate name exists on the network&quot;. </s>
<s> I usually just X out of it, and proceed forward. </s>
<s> So my question is, did the actions listed above create my current problem? </s>
<s> Why isn't my router recognizing the ethernet cable plugged into it from the laptop? </s>
<s> Also, is there any way to test if the issues stems with my network adapter in my laptop?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> That the machine you tried to update from likely had it's wifi link enabled at that time. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> If the firmware is out of date then it's not setup per the forum sticky. </s>
<s> This model router is well known to have issues corrected by updating the firmware. </s>
<s> So what should I do? </s>
<s> I tried to update my firmware, and I failed. </s>
<s> How can I check to see if the network adapter in my laptop is the issue? </s>
<s> Why am I getting the &quot;duplicate name message&quot;? </s>
<s> And what does it mean? </s>
<s> Help!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Doesn't the Dell control the wireless card using the fn+f2 button? </s>
<s> I'm sorry to ask this but do you know your laptop features or where to find them? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've never had to deal with whether my network adapter was an issue, so no, i didn't know of the fn+f2 function. </s>
<s> I'm wondering if I made a mistake adding my laptop to my network, hence the &quot;duplicate name on the network&quot; message i always get at start up. </s>
<s> My internet connection is so inconsistent with my laptop. </s>
<s> Can anyone give me a step by step understanding of figuring out what the problem is (whether it be my network adapter, router, etc). </s>
<s> Any words on my inability to have my router recognized by my laptop via an ethernet cable? </s>
<s> There are support people available to come in and set it up for you. </s>
<s> Given you didn't know your own laptop is a sign. </s>
<s> I'm sorry if this offends you in any way but unless you dive in you may have to call in the troops for this sort of work. </s>
<s> -&gt; I agree the makers blew it big time here. </s>
<s> This is far more complicated than it needs to be. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't think the fact that I didn't know how to turn on/off my network adapter is a sign I don't know my laptop. </s>
<s> It's just a part of my computer I've never had to deal with before (network adapter). </s>
<s> I'm confident the problem is the router. </s>
<s> It's just so inconsistent with my laptop. </s>
<s> I keep having my signal dropped, and it simply won't connect in areas of my house where previously it always had a strong connection. </s>
<s> I just put in my order for a DLink 655 Xtreme N Gigabit router. </s>
<s> Here's to hoping that will solve my issues. </s>
<s> At the very least, it should help me figure out what the real issue is. </s>
<s> To replace a router before you got it updated since new routers may come with outdated firmware but new issues so we get to repeat the same issues. </s>
<s> As to not knowing your laptop, a reply above noted the key combo so you should have used that to get the task done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tried to update the firmware and wasn't able to (I stated this before in posts). </s>
<s> I wouldn't call that sad. </s>
<s> I tried your suggestions and it didn't work. </s>
<s> So now I'm trying something else. </s>
<s> I understand your point, but again I'm confident the problem lies with the Linksys router itself. </s>
<s> Especially after it was working for quite some time. </s>
<s> Plus, with all my online research regarding my current router, there have been a ton of user complaints in having many issues like I have had with this specific model. </s>
<s> Lastly, I don't see where the key combo you mentioned again was stated by a previous post. </s>
<s> Regardless, all that key combo did was turn the network adapter on and off, not really any help. </s>
<s> What program are you using to connect to the Internet? </s>
<s> Intel ProSet Wireless? </s>
<s> If so, what version? </s>
<s> If it's version 11, there are problems with it staying connected. </s>
<s> I had to go back to version 10. </s>
<s> Download it from here http://support.us.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=gen&releaseid=R138747&formatcnt=1&libid=0&fileid=185739 Set a System Restore Point. </s>
<s> Go to control panel and remove Intel ProSet wireless. </s>
<s> Restart your computer. </s>
<s> Install the file that was downloaded. </s>
<s> Now connect and what happens? </s>
<s> Are you staying connected? </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> I'm using Intel proset wireless version 9. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
