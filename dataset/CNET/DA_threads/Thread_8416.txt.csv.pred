1.1.1	I have an older emachine that I am refurbishing for a friend.	St
1.1.2	It is an etower 533i which came with Windows 98 installed.	St
1.1.3	I have upgraded the memory and it works great.	St
1.1.4	I installed Windows 2000 Professional (clean install) and finally got all updated drivers installed so that all hardware works perfectly with the exception of the modem.	St
1.1.5	No matter which driver I install, nothing happens.	St
1.1.6	I have installed the one that emachine provides and I have also installed what is supposed to work according to all the driver sites I've found and nothing works.	St
1.1.7	I understand the modem is a Conexant Soft 56K PCI Modem.	St
1.1.8	Can anyone help with this problem ?	Ques
1.1.9	?	Ques
1.2.1	Conexant never made modems, just the chips.	St
1.2.2	As such you didn't supply the make and model of the modem for others to go find it.	St
1.2.3	Maybe do as I do and pull the modem out and toss it.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
