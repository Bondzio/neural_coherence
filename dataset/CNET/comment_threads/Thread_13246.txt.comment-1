My PC currently has 1 GB memory (2-512GB chips) with 2 slots for expansion.
I've always read where an upgrade should use the same size chips, but is it written in stone where I have to use 2 more 512s as opposed to dropping in 1 or 2 1GB chips to use with the 512s in there now?
Or do I take the current 512s out & drop in 2, 3 or 4 1GB chips?
