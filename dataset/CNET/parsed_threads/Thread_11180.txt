<s> I was working on a friend's Presario X6000; a big laptop with a big graphics problem; nothing could be read on the screen. </s>
<s> After re-installing XP-Pro using the Compaq disk, then use a second disk to install several more drivers - including ATI M22/24 video. </s>
<s> Everything worked OK until the driver is installed; then the screen becomes horribly fuzzy(can't think of a better description) and you can barely read anything- as it was before. </s>
<s> Sometimes booting stops at a black screen. </s>
<s> I've loaded drivers from MS automatic update, from ATI, and from HP(with their on-line help), but everytime any graphics/video driver is loaded, disaster hits. </s>
<s> I've even done the whole routine with a different hard drive, with the same result. </s>
<s> The only remedy is to Restore from Safe Mode- or reinstall the OS again. </s>
<s> Without the ATI graphics, it's obviously sluggish, but it works. </s>
<s> I think there is a problem with the graphics part of the motherboard because it's relatively OK before a driver &quot;activates&quot; it. </s>
<s> This wouldn't be such a big deal on a desktop- just stick a new card in it. </s>
<s> So, any idea why installing a graphics driver kills it? </s>
<s> I think it's a hardware flaw. </s>
<s> Swap in a new motherboard and re-test. </s>
<s> Be sure the BIOS is 'defaults' in case there is some setting that breaks the graphics. </s>
<s> Too bad I don't have another motherboard. </s>
<s> A new MB from HP is like $799, or one from Ebay for maybe $300, plus the time and hassle to change it (not my favorite chore). </s>
<s> I don't think the owner is willing to spend that much at this point, but if a new MB was the only way, then we'd be able to make a decision on it. </s>
<s> But I can't buy one just to try it. </s>
<s> I asked the question hoping somebody had a similar experience, or as &quot;is there any possible solution that I'm not aware of&quot;- short of a new MB. </s>
<s> I have a feeling I may be owning this laptop if it comes cheaply enough. </s>
<s> Or rather UBUNTU (see google). </s>
<s> I often test such machines with a linux CD to see if the graphics choke under linux. </s>
<s> If it fails in Linux it surely is a machine with issues. </s>
<s> -&gt; About the board swap. </s>
<s> This is where HP and such has it all over the little guy. </s>
<s> They have the boards and can do the test, call in the engineers and more. </s>
<s> But your description is just like what I've seen with failed video ram. </s>
<s> However since we can't replace that with ease or safely then the board swap is the right way. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I gave the computer back to the owner with the warning to not let it install a video driver. </s>
<s> I'll wait & see what happens. </s>
<s> I do have a Ubuntu CD if I get it back. </s>
<s> Like most others, I'm much more conservative when working on other people's computers, but if it were mine, let it rip! </s>
<s> That's how I learn. </s>
