1.1.1	so I just recieved some comptuer stuff for my birthday My computer has : AMD AThlon 3800+ X2 dual core 2.0GhZ processor one 250GB hard drive one CD/DVD writer drive x1 512 MB DDR2 SDRAM x2 2 GB DDR2 SDRAM new video card that requires 400W ( Geforce 8600GTS ) http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktops/compaq-presario-sr5130nx-desktop/4507-3118_7-32773948.html ? tag=specs ( full specs ) I got a 400W PSU for the video card but forgot I 'd have to power the rest of the system .	St
1.1.2	So how many watts do you think I should shoot for ?	Ques
1.2.1	Try the other method of calculating power .	St
1.2.2	Total up the amperes on each supply as well as the total watts .	St
1.2.3	See that neither gets close to 400 Watts or the amperage on each supply .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I would go for a 500Watt PSU of quality power for that system .	St
1.3.2	It also depends if you are going to add another drive , fan and/or video card in the future , so it 's good to future proof yourself .	St
1.4.1	The other posters covered the topic well , i just like to add do n't be too cheap in buying a decent psu .	St
1.4.2	Beware , some psu makers *may* post specs that really are n't that good once heat stress is placed on them and/or severe service , they degrade quickly .	St
1.4.3	In this regard paying a bit more makes for happy system experience .	St
1.4.4	The overall best advice is buy the biggest wattage psu and namebrand you can afford and be done with it .	St
1.4.5	Afterall , there are now 1.5k watts ( and related amps ) psus offered now , though you wo n't need that .	St
1.4.6	If you like use a psu watts calculator and then add 100W to the calculated total for optimum current needs .	St
1.4.7	You can search these forums for past answers that repeatedly cover the topic .	St
1.4.8	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	I tried that wattage calc , and it looks like I 'm probably running at almost 200W ( probably a little high , seeing as I 'm using a 250W ) without a video card .	St
1.5.2	I guess I 'll be getting something around 600-700W .	St
1.6.1	WHAT EVER YOU DO DO DONT GET A COOLER MASTER 550W I GOT IT AND IT IS LOUD AS HELL !	St
1.6.2	LIKE THINK OF A LOUD PC AND THEN DOUBLE IT ... YES THATS HOW LOUD IT IS	St
1.7.1	Buying a Power Supply can be tricky .	St
1.7.2	You 'll find the same Wattage Power Supply for sale at prices ranging from $ 20 to $ 220 .	St
1.7.3	Why not buy the cheap one ?	Ques
1.7.4	Or use the PS that came with your case ?	Ques
1.7.5	Cheap Power Supplies fail , and often they will destroy your Motherboard , Hard Drive , and pretty much everything .	St
1.7.6	Honestly , it 's just not worth it .	St
1.7.7	Plan on spending at least $ 80 for a 350W or better Power Supply .	St
1.7.8	It will be money well spent .	St
1.7.9	Good brands I 've bought are BFG and Antec , There are others that are good , too .	St
