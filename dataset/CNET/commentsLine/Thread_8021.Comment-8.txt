your old psu is nothing more than a generic atx type psu.
finding a similar one with be fairly easy as most vendors offer this at 500w unit.
just be sure the connections offered(basic) are what you need and added connections are provided as well though you may not need them, they cause no harm.
again, look for typical generic atx-12v type psu.
