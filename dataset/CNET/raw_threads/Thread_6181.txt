My router seems to be droping my internet conect for 1-2 seconds every 10-30 min. If i connect directly to the modem all is fine. I have tried two moodems and get a very similar patern. I have talked to both the ISP provider and the Trendnet suport people to no avail. The big issue is that I play on line games and this interuption short as it is seems to cause games to drop. Also Ventrilo, Yahoo messenger and MSN. When i bought the new router the issue seemed to go away for a while then it returned after a few days. An ideas?

The words: Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended. There is a setting in the router to control this. Rick

I have tried everything from latest firmware to leaving it as an open connection. The firmware I have is for the B1.1R hardware dated May, 2007. Is yours newer than that? It is a pain when uploads break. Thanks in advance.
