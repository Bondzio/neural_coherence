i am using 2 nic cards and a direct connection with no router or hub.
both computers have modems.
the problem is when the device driver &quot;ndis.vxd&quot; tries to load the driver (for ics) icshare.vxd, the device refuses to load.
(this information comes from the bootlog).
i also have the horrible little yellow exclamation point in the device manager (computer/network adapters/internet connection sharing).
i can load a new driver for the ics adapter in &quot;device manager&quot; all day long (also tried icshare.inf fix from microsoft), but the yellow exclamation point never dies.
and the device still refuses to load.
i am 90% sure that nothing is wrong with ndis.vxd, but i am at a loss as how to force something to load or update the ics setup completely.
yes, i've tried to uninstall and reinstall using add/remove programs.
several times, with the client disconnected from the host and connected.
i have spent 2 days trying to get this darn network up and running.
i'm soooo tired now.
please help!!!!
