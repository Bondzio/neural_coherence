1.1.5	Heres what i customized on HP i'll put my questions about each part in parentheses.	St
1.1.6	HP elite HPE-480t Intel Core I-7 930 8 GB 1033 Ram Primary HD- 80gb Solid State Drive ( I've heard that formatting this type of drive in Raid 0 format makes it very fast but makes transfer rates lower.	St

1.1.8	How do i put this drive in raid 0?	Ques
1.1.9	what is raid 0?	St

1.1.15	I want to have a 3 monitor set up and if there is a better combination of others cards feel free to advise ) Sound card- Integrated Sound ( dont know if its worth the extra money for the sound blaster card ) Networking - Wireless N lan card ( should i get bluetooth with it?	Sug

1.1.19	Thank you!	St
1.2.1	I've held back long enough for HP to correct their stance on an in warranty issue on a laptop but the last talk ended with &quot;that's not supported.&quot; It was a simple issue that my HP laptop would not boot when a Spring HTC EVO 4G phone was plugged in.	St
1.2.2	While I know why it does me no good as only HP can issue a fixed BIOS.	St
1.2.3	Instead the choice was to tell me it was not supported.	St
1.2.4	Since HP can't warrant or support their machines, it's time to move on to those that will.	St
