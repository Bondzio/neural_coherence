i'm new to overclocking.
if i do decide to go that route and get the opteron and that board to overclock it, is it easy to do?
is there somewhere i can go that would guide me through it?
it'd definitely something i would do assuming i wouldn't be damaging any of my new parts, or decreasing their longevity.
i would assume i would need to buy new fans in order to overclock it is that right?
intel conroe will come out very high in price i would assume, so it's probably not something i'd be interested in looking for, i might just go this route.
i appreciate all of your help so far, thank you very much, ~j
