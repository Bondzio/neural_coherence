i would have avoid acronis altogether.
all this partitioning and more seems to have ended badly.
what i learned years ago is to learn the native tools, use simpler setups so repairs could be done without calling acronis.
if i had to deal with this i would install just the new drive, clean it off by booting my xp/other cd and installing the os and drivers.
then i'd add the old drive and recover my stuff.
