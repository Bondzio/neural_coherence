I went to Fry's Electronics today and bought a Gateway FX6801-01 Desktop computer.
I got it home and it would not boot up.
I took it back to Fry's and they opened it up and looked inside.
This is what that found.
NO CPU!
and the 9 megs of memory had been exchanged for 3 megs of memory.
Fry's would not exchange it.
ARRRGGHH!
