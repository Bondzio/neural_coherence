1.1.1	Hey there .	St
1.1.2	I`m trying to connect my mobile phone to my pc using a usb cable designed for the job .	St
1.1.3	The set up for the cable and software says that it should be a USB connection , but when it looks for the phone , it only looks at COM ports 1 and 2 ( which I believe are the serial ports ) .	St
1.1.4	How can I give my USB port a COM number ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is it even possible ?	Ques
1.1.6	I`m using Windows XP Pro .	St
1.1.7	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	This is the typical result of USB ports that are not enabled , or have other issues .	St
1.2.2	Usually the person notices it when they try something that uses USB .	St
1.2.3	I 'd pester your machine builder/supplier/support to show the USB ports working .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Having setup a lot of these I look for the icon in the Tray ( next to the time ) that supports the actual synching .	St
1.3.2	If you right click on it it may pop up and have options for USB or Serial , or you may need to bring up the Setup options to change them to use the USB port instead of the serial port .	St
1.3.3	A Palm pilot will look for serial if you do n't set it correct , same with a phone .	St
1.3.4	Since your system has XP I would assume you have working USB ports , you have gone to Device Manager ( under Control Panel/System ) and made sure they show up , or have used other USB devices with the system ?	Ques
1.4.1	Yes , I`ve used other devices both my USB ports with no problem .	St
1.4.2	The little symbol next to the time in the system tray only gives me the & quot ; safely remove hardware & quot ; option when I select it .	St
1.4.3	When I plug the cable for the phone into the USB port , the computer gives the little audio sound that says a device has been connected to the ort , so the computer knows it`s there , but it gives a question mark in the device managed , saying there`s no drivers , even though they`ve been installed correctly , and that has been aknowledged by the installation program .	St
1.4.4	It`s just that the software for the phone will only look for COM port 1 or 2 , but it`s supposed to be a USB cable ? ! ! ! ! !	St
1.4.5	It`s doing my brain in ! !	St
1.4.6	Thanks again for your help so far ... ...	St
1.5.1	& quot ; it gives a question mark in the device managed , saying there`s no drivers , even though they`ve been installed correctly & quot ; This is often the result of plugging in a device before the drivers were installed .	St
1.5.2	Let 's NOT debate this point , but move forward to the usual remedy .	St
1.5.3	When you see those & quot ; ? & quot ; mark items , use the Device Manager to remove them .	St
1.5.4	Then unplug the phone and do NOT plug it back in .	St
1.5.5	Now install the drivers for the phone .	St
1.5.6	And then try again .	Sug
1.5.7	If it does n't work , you 'll have to tell us the URL of said phone and drivers so we can check these are for XP .	St
1.5.8	Bob	St
1.6.1	I recently bought a digital camera and after loading the drivers for it I plugged it in to the usb port and a window popped up saying new harware found , and windows then proceeded to reinstall the driver for the camera .	St
1.6.2	Try uninstalling you phone drivers and then plug in your phone and have windows seach for new harware .	St
