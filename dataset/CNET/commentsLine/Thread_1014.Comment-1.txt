hi, i'm using an hp a1600n to edit videos.
my specs: hp pavilion desktop amd athlon 64 x2 dual core processor 3800+, 2.0 ghz 2 gigs of ram (i added 1 gig myself) nvidia graphics card (i don't what model, where do i look?)
i've experienced some lag as i'm editing and i'm looking to re-vamp this computer, rather than buying new- it's less than a year old.
i will be dealing with hd video soon and i'm sure my pc will seem even slower then.
i'd like to upgrade to a 2.8+ ghz processor (3.0 ghz wouldn't hurt).
is a processor hard to install?
i'm also curious if i should buy a better video card.
i'm unsure about how a video card affects performance and what kinds there are.
thanks for any responses!
!
