<s> Many times I come across people that would like to add networked backup to their home network but don't want to buy a new router with a USB port. </s>
<s> If there are no desktop computers in the home, they won't want to tether a drive to one laptop only for the drive to not be available to others should that laptop be moved. </s>
<s> Is there an adapter that will allow an external USB hard drive to connect to an ethernet port on a router that can then be shared? </s>
<s> Google up the GMFPSU22W6 which I picked up two of for under 25 each. </s>
<s> Ok, now I have USB drives on my Ethernet and network. </s>
<s> But the speed over wifi is abysmal and barely tolerable wired. </s>
<s> Here's partly why -&gt;USB 2.0 sprints (?) </s>
<s> along at 480 million bits per second and your common Ethernet is 100 million bits per second (Mbps). </s>
<s> Ethernet is FULL DUPLEX and when we move to WIFI that's shared bandwidth at 54 Mbps on a good day. </s>
<s> My GMFPSU22W6's do fine as print servers but the USB drives are now back on the machines via USB when I need them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If the drive was used for backups to be run during the night it might not be a problem. </s>
<s> I would only recommend a wired connection of course. </s>
<s> I'm trying to find a low-cost network backup solution for residential folks. </s>
<s> It seems that if we try to depend on a drive attached to a system and shared, the connection is not always reliable especially in a mixed Windows environment. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> I leave it to you to determine that. </s>
<s> Wifi is not reliable enough for hours of backup. </s>
<s> Yes you can fine SYNCBACK to beef it up but you do the math. </s>
<s> Let's say you have 40GB to backup. </s>
<s> Let's give you 10 megabits per second due to all that file server overhead. </s>
<s> How long? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> A solution for $25 would be great but with your scenario of 40GB at 10MB/second, you would never be able to do it in one night. </s>
<s> So it looks like if I want to have a relatively low-cost solution with reasonable speed, it would require an NAS. </s>
<s> Sorry for the typo. </s>
<s> I meant find not fine. </s>
<s> That device turns your common USB drive into a NAS. </s>
<s> Just thought I'd warn you about network copy speeds. </s>
<s> At least someone told you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All you guys need is a NAS Adapter ( Network Attached Storage) it has a one end USB port and the other a LAN out put It's compatible with almost any generic external USB storage devices from Flash sticks to Storage Towers!! </s>
<s> regarding the Update in WIFI, you can back up the computers initially LAN connected. </s>
<s> and then keep the update going real-time without concerning yourself with bandwidth over load.. this can easily be done with Genie Professional TimeLine.. </s>
<s> I bought this program and it never let me down </s>
