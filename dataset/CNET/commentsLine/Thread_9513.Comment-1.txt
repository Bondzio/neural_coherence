i have an additional 200gb hdd and only 31.4gb is showing up.
it was showing the full 200gb but all of a sudden it is not.
i know there is a problem with xp os's without sp1 but i have sp1 and all updates that have been released so it can't be that.
my set-up: athlon xp 2100 512mb ram hdd 1 = 80gb hdd 2 = 200gb xp sp1
