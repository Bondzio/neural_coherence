1.2.4	Your product = http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product ? cc=us & lc=en & product=424351 I see that you might enable a THIRD MASTER in the BIOS at http : //forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1144192 However unless you find a document with the BIOS screen shots , this is as far as I go .	St
1.2.5	Plan B .	St
1.2.6	Install some card like this - & gt ; http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16815124020 but beware that many do n't want to flash the BIOS for the IDE emulation so it will work .	St
