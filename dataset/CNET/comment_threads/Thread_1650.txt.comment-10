those sticks are way overpriced .
for that price you could get ddr2-1066 with the same 5-5-5-18 timings: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227289 here's another ddr2-800 2x2gb kit with the same timings for $81: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146693 tighter 4-4-4-12 timings are only a few bucks more: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820211282 p.s.
: 4x1gb is fine if you run at stock speeds (and you don't seem to be interested in overclocking).
