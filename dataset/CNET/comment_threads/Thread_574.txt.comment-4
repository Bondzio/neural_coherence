We have the issue of being able to interfere with a persons wifi if they are on an insecure link such as none or WEP.
Forgive me as I can't write the full detail for each member.
This is why we move directly to the forum's suggested setup.
After we've done that, there is an issue with some network cards internal to laptops that peter out in a year or so.
For that we have another long discussion post in this forum.
In short I install a PC-Card to replace the internal card.
Some will fight that move but I know the signs and carry the spare card to show it as a fix.
