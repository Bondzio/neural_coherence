1.1.1	Hey guys, I'm new here and I figured this would be a fantastic place to get help on a subject I am currently on the fence about.	St
1.1.2	I bought a Logitech LX5 wireless optical mouse about four years ago.	St
1.1.3	The mouse worked pretty well for the most part but right now I am finding that the mouse doesn't want to respond to the surface of my desk as well as it used to.	St
1.1.4	A lot of times I try to click on things or just simply move it around and I have to shift the mouse to different parts of my desk in order for it to function properly, and then back to another spot later because it will eventually act up in the new spot anyways.	St
1.1.5	This is a huge annoyance, plus the wireless dongle for it is big and gets in the way so I am in the market for a new mouse.	St
1.1.6	What is currently one of the best wireless optical mice on the market right now?	St
1.1.7	I'm looking for one that performs well on all surfaces (even though I just need it to perform well on my computer desk), is inexpensive (not over $50), and preferably has more than two buttons on it.	St
1.1.8	I have been looking into the Microsoft Arc Mouse but I'm not too sure how well it performs on surfaces and I read a couple of poor reviews on Amazon/Best Buy's website.	St
1.1.9	Can anyone recommend a good mouse to me?	Ques
1.1.10	I'm about to throw this Logitech one out the window.	St
1.1.11	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	While I give the nod to Logitech v450 Nano's here, your requirement may be too much.	St
1.2.2	Your desk may need something a mouse can &quot;see.&quot; Good hunting, Bob	St
