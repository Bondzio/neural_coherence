yes, since you are building new, the 64-bit is the wave of the future.
nerdyboy mentioned dual core which also has the 64-bit support and is even newer.
dual core provides two execution cores in one physical processor allowing the platform to do more in less time, performing multiple tasks with smooth interaction with your pc.
intel currently has dual core: pent d processor 820, 2.8ghz = $241 pent d processor 830, 3.0ghz = $316 pent d processor 840, 3.2ghz = $530 in 1000 unit quantities the dual core intel pentium processor extreme edition 3.2ghz, with motherboard, intel d955x bklkr, and 955x pci-express chipset with ddr2 is supposed to be $1050.
the amd 64 dual core processing family should be out by the end of september and is supposed to include models: 4800 processor = $1000 4600 processor = $803 4400 processor = $581 4200 processor = $537 respectively, in 1000 unit quantities
