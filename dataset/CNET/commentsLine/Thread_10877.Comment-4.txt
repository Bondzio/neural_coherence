a few pages you should probably look at.
an older column by daniel rutter of dan's data points out that at today's capacities, it's just about impossible to write to a drive fast enough to burn out any given sector  basically, with a modern ssd's wear-leveling algorithms you can't really write to one spot enough times to burn it out that way.
even when the disk is nearly full, the software on the drive will copy a section that doesn't change into a more-worn area, and then that only-written-once area starts getting used.
a more recent look at them  which refers to jeff atwood's coding horror blog, where he relates that from what he's heard ssds are less reliable then platters, but their speed is so good that he uses them anyway, and keeps good backups  i've taken the hybrid approach.
i would find 256 gb too cramped.
so, when i needed to reinstall windows recently, i took the opportunity to replace my three-yr-old drive.
i got a 256 gb ssd to act as my boot drive, and to hold temp files and other often-changing data.
and i have a 1 tb drive where i keep bulky stuff that doesn't really get read and written all that often, so drive speed isn't much of an issue.
i put downloads, documents, music and pictures on the platter drive.
everything else i let go onto the system ssd.
