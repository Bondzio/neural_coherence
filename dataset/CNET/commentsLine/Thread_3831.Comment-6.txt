i was having the same problem with my belkin n+ router and comcast service (rca thomson modem).
i had the comcast guys come and check the internet signal, which was strong and uninterrupted.
i took the usual steps (power cycling the modem and router, changing wireless channels, resetting modem to factory defaults, etc.)
to no avail.
i have seen rumblings around the internet about problems with this router.
there is no new firmware upgrade to address these issues.
it's a shame because i was getting great speed and throughput on the router before these problems arose.
i ended up returning the router and getting a linksys n router - that seemed to solve my problems.
