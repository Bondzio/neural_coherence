i see more people lose files over firewire than usb under windows.
i can't explain why.
my thought is that msft and apple's bickering is part of that since linux and apple oses don't seem to have the issue.
if you use firewire be sure that you run it for a long time in your testing state of mind.
that is, don't rely on it.
in fact, given this forum (read it if you dare) and how externals are not storage but devices we must backup more often than internals i suggest you head straight to usb and use the thing.
