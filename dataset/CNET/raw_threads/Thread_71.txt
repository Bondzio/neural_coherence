Now when I try to burn a cd,it will get to 65%, and my computer will shut down and restart. I checked the heat inside of the computer, and it seem to be ok. I left the side panel off, and the fan is working ok. Any help would be appreciated. Other then this my computer is working real good.

After more work on burning a cd, I believe that it is a heat related problem. I hooked a fan up, and put it beside my computer. I was able to copy a cd with no problem. Thanks for your reply.
