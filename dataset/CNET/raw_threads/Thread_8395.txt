Please advise: Which memory am I better off with? DDR2 ECC SDRAM or 400MHz DDR Memory 3.40 Ghz Single Processor or XEON Processor? Does the video card make the difference? Which video card do you recommend? Thanks in advance Pam 50

Proffitt	10/31/04 3:50 PM	1.0992378E12	Re: Video Editing: DDR2 ECC SDRAM and 400MHz DDR Memory for	We have a paltry 4 MB ATI RadeonGO card on on DVD rendered box after we tested with some 2 hundred card and found no difference in performance. It seems to be all about the CPU, CPU CACHE and memory speeds. Next in line are hard disk speeds. Bob

I'm not sure which way to go on the RAM question - I personally haven't put a lot of stock in RAM speed differences. I use an AMD Athlon 64 CPU and PC 2700 DDR RAM (1.5GB) running Avid Xpress Pro editing software. I have basically no problems with rendering, layers, etc. I also am running (internal) ATA/IDE drives and connecting both USB and Firewire external drives. Access of the externals is sometimes a little slow, but not enough to affect the editing performance. The video card requirements depend on the software requirements. For example, Avid - and many other high end programs don't require more than about a 64MB video card in most cases. I run an NVIDIA 128MB card in my system. I've been told not to waste my money on a high end/high RAM capacity video card for editing - the current softwares won't use most of the onboard video RAM anyway.

Visit the Video Guys here http://www.videoguys.com/system.htm Lots and lots of information on systems and video editing Bill .
