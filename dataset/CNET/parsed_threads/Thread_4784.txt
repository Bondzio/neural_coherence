<s> Hi, I have recently been persuaded that Apple is the way to go for me. </s>
<s> I have been looking to get a laptop for myself for a little while now, and have settled on a Macbook. </s>
<s> I am basically doing normal, everyday tasks such as email, word processing, watching movies, burn cd's etc. </s>
<s> I will not be gaming. </s>
<s> My question is which version is right for me - the 1.8ghz or 2ghz? </s>
<s> I would at least want to upgrade the RAM to 1gb in the 1.8 and to 2gb a bit later if I need to. </s>
<s> I could easily do the same in the 2ghz version. </s>
<s> Having a dvd burner and larger hard drive would be nice but they are not essential for me. </s>
<s> Is the performance difference that great and is the 2gz a much better value? </s>
<s> Also - how worth it are laptop warranties? </s>
<s> I have never owned a laptop so I don't really know. </s>
<s> I know that VISA doubles any warranty on a product so that could be enough but I don't know for sure. </s>
<s> I am spinning in circles with all the options and would appreciate any guidance. </s>
<s> thx. </s>
<s> I suppose you are not going to do any video editing. </s>
<s> So do you need the DVD burner? </s>
<s> Well ask your self this question. </s>
<s> Are you or are you not going to burn DVDs. </s>
<s> You could burn DVDs for extra storage or for movies etc. </s>
<s> If you are going to do only the things that you mentioned then you would be better off going for the 1.83 Ghz model as the increase to 2 Ghz is not really noticeable. </s>
<s> It is almost impossible to notice the difference with the work that you are going to do. </s>
<s> The only way to notice the difference is to do some CPU intensive work like video editing. </s>
<s> When you do that, you might notice that your work is done a few mins earlier. </s>
<s> About the hard drive, well again it depends upon you. </s>
<s> Are you going to store any multimedia like movies on your laptop? </s>
<s> Do you need the extra storage? </s>
<s> For the work you specified, I really dont think you will need it. </s>
<s> With the extra cash that you save, you can buy more RAM which comes in quite handy and the difference is quite noticeable most of the time. </s>
<s> Better still, you can buy AppleCare for your laptop. </s>
<s> It is like car insurance, you dont use it frequently but it might come in handy. </s>
<s> If some internal defect comes up then it might cost a lot of money to get repaired but the AppleCare it is free. </s>
<s> The main reason why many people buy it is because it helps a lot when you want to sell your laptop after a few years. </s>
<s> The reason being that people will know that this product is protected by Apple and any defects will be repaired by Apple. </s>
<s> Now lets look at the differences. </s>
<s> If you upgrade your RAM and hard drive to equal the 2 Ghz model, then the difference in money is only $ 75. </s>
<s> With that $ 75 you get a DL SuperDrive and a slightly faster processor. </s>
<s> The only attractive thing is the superdrive. </s>
<s> Another little problem you face is RAM. </s>
<s> As far as I know, the Macbook has only 2 RAM slots. </s>
<s> No matter how much RAM you buy, the RAM will always take up both the slots. </s>
<s> If you want to upgrade on your own then you will have to take away one RAM stick and maybe sell it to free up one slot. </s>
<s> So you would think right now that it is better to just go for the 2 GB right away. </s>
<s> But remember the Apple RAM is more expensive than what you can get from other manufacturers. </s>
<s> When you click on the Learn More button on Apple online store, it tells you that 512 MB is good enough for tasks like word processing, emailing etc. </s>
<s> REad more of it and you can choose what is appropriate for you. </s>
<s> If I were in your position, then I would just buy the 1.83 Ghz model (unless I wanted to burn DVDs) and buy the AppleCare and maybe upgrade to 1 GB RAM. </s>
<s> Simply out, do you want to burn DVDs? </s>
<s> If yes, go for the 2 GHz model, if no, go for the 1.83 ghz model. </s>
<s> Good Bye </s>
<s> Oh yeah and maybe you should wait for Leopard. </s>
<s> I don't want a debate started here but its a strong suggestion. </s>
<s> Now that we are in 2007, iLife 07 should be very close to release. </s>
<s> and if you can hold on to buying a laptop, then you should wait for Leopard the new Mac OS to release. </s>
<s> It will have many cool new features like automatic backup, multiple desktops etc to name a few. </s>
<s> It is also rumoured tham the Graphical User Interface will change from Aqua(current on Tiger) to Illuminous which will have black and dark colours. </s>
<s> It is also said that the new OS normally works faster than the previous OS on the same hardware. </s>
<s> I dont know about this but I have heard people saying this. </s>
<s> I have the 2ghz macbook with 158mb of ram ( still havent gotten around to updating it :P) and I think its a great computer..but since we're soo close to leopard being released maybe you should wait and see. </s>
<s> Things like &quot;Time Travel&quot; similar to the feature on windows computers is something really nice to have. </s>
<s> If you need a laptop for work now though, then dont hesitate, upgrade to leopard later. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Just wanted to say thanks guys! </s>
<s> Waiting till Leopard is out seems to be the smart thing to do. </s>
<s> Appreciate it! </s>
<s> Hi, i am in the same spot as the original thread starter. </s>
<s> Presently i am a student so have access to web and use a lot of comp related to internet usage. </s>
<s> But my work is on merchant ships, where i am away from net. </s>
<s> So succinctly i use the laptop for normal word processing etc, PLUS basic (Read basic) EDITING of pictures using picasa or may be photoshop ( btw does mac have any software like photoshop ?) </s>
<s> in distant future. </s>
<s> My question is: Should i be so much worried regarding the non use of ATI graphics card in macbook with core 2duo. </s>
<s> and can i just use openoffice and avoid buying ms office for mac since i can convert openoffice files into MS files just for printing purposes. </s>
<s> thks in advance for ur help brgds krish </s>
<s> Link to -&gt; http://www.neooffice.org/ Bob </s>
<s> can be done in iPhoto, free with every new Mac. </s>
<s> You could also use Photoshop Elements for Mac if you want to do a little more with editing. </s>
<s> As to your question about photoshop. </s>
<s> Yes there is a piece of software that is remarkably similar to Photoshop. </s>
<s> It's called Photoshop. </s>
<s> That product is produced for both platforms. </s>
<s> You should not concern yourself with the non use of ATI graphics cards. </s>
<s> The card that is installed in the MacBook is perfectly capable of doing what you want it to do. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> thks P One more question, presently have an ACER laptop which came with XP home installed.The xp home is buried somewhere in one of the 3 &quot;Reecovery&quot; cds for the laptop Can i install xp home in macbook by using these cds? </s>
<s> rgds krish </s>
<s> outside the terms of use of the EULA that you agreed to when you purchased the Acer. </s>
<s> You would also probably find that the restore disks have some form of checking on them to ensure that your are installing it on an Acer machine. </s>
<s> HP & Compaq used that technique. </s>
