1.4.1	You might want to consider a ram upgrade........800&gt;1066.	St
1.4.2	It can make quite a difference for some apps.	St
1.4.3	It's not exactly a budget buster but may give a nice bump.	St
1.5.1	My system currently recognizes only 3.254GB of RAM!	St
1.5.2	Should I upgrade my Operating system and memory to get the best bang for the buck?	St
1.6.1	Swapping a couple of ram sticks and getting a little bump is about as simple as it gets.	St
1.6.2	Swapping an OS and getting everything to function again can put a major hit on the beer supply.	St
1.6.3	If the OS you have works.........leave it alone.	St
1.6.4	Your call.	St
