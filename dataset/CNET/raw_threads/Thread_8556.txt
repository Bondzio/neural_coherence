I partitioned it and set it up so window's sees it. Problem is, now the system keeps crashing every so often....it will either crash a game being played or completely shut down the computer. The one thing that I noticed right off the bat was that the main hard drive is set to Master and this new drive is set to Secondary Master, but after the computer started up I figured it must be ok. That's the only conflict I can think of that might be screwing things up. Any ideas on why it might be crashing? Thanks!! AMD 3.0 Sound Blaster Audigy Two different hard drives Windows XP Home
