I decided to take them to the Indian VoTech center & let them have some fun testing it.
I'm a member or the Indian VoTech center.
Would be some intresting testing on it for those young kids as long as they don't screw it up.
Only cost me $5.00 to have it tested.
Pretty sure it's the mobo at fault.
They merely test it for any faults & report back & I decide if I want them to fix it & I pay for the parts.
I most likely will reapir it myself.
