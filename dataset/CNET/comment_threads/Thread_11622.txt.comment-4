Of the DMCA and the BR/BD software consortium is the primary reason why.
Since almost all BR/BD content is protected and the software to play it requires the decoder and there is no open source decoder and the DMCA chills the developers you may be waiting a very long time.
There's also no reason to stick to BR/BD.
