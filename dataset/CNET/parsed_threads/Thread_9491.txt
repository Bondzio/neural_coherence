<s> Is there any way to burn VCR tapes to my PC? </s>
<s> My son (Now deceased) was assistant athetic trainer for the Alabama Crimson Tide from 1979-199. </s>
<s> I have VCR tapes for every televised Crimson Tide game from 1985-1990. </s>
<s> I want to heep them in a better format, and perhaps to edit and burn them to DVD-RW disks. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ed Henne </s>
<s> My wife faced the same thing: many VCR tapes of instructional videos that she wanted to convert to digital format. </s>
<s> We went to Best Buy and bought a DVD recorder that also had a VCR deck. </s>
<s> Dubbing tapes to DVD is a cinch, though you do have to do that in real time. </s>
<s> Once you have the DVDs burned, you can use software (I use a DVD ripper from Xilisoft) to rip those DVDs into smaller MPEGs if you want. </s>
<s> But I suspect you just want DVDs of the tapes, so the dual deck is the way to go. </s>
<s> Not expensive either. </s>
<s> Why not just get a dvd recorder? </s>
<s> That's the method I use. </s>
<s> A 55 buck DVD recorder. </s>
<s> Then off to the PC with the discs. </s>
<s> For quick editing I use the following titles (the free ones.) </s>
<s> Virtual Dub (snip snip!) </s>
<s> DVD FLICK (that was easy) IMGBURN (that is good stuff) Bob </s>
