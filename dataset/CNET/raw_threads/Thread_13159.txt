USB 1.1 is lucky to hit 11Megabits per second or about 1 megabyte per second so it's too slow 60 MB per minute or 3,600 MB per hour. You can't hit the 1X speed of DVD so playback and recording will not function. Bob

Since, at best you can transfer 3 odd GB in an hour that 700MB of MP3 will take about 15 to 20 minutes. It's really useful, but slow. Answer? Only if its supported. Bob
