maxtor shared storage drives&gt; i have one of these that i need to replace the hard drive in and it is out of warranty.
has anyone had success with doing this?
all i get is a solid yellow light and the maxtor software will not find it on the network.
i've tried resetting the drive and that doesn't work either.
i've also tried formatting the with ntfs and with no partitioning at all and still no go.
suggestions?
