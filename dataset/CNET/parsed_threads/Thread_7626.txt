<s> I have a Sony Vaio FS640 notebook with built in wireless and have DSL.With the help of someone I got it set up but ever since it drops on me alot.I have days where I don't have the problem but like last night it kept dropping on me every 2-5 mins then it finally stopped. </s>
<s> When I reconnect I have to repair because trying to type in my network password doesn't work.I'm using it upstairs and i'm in a Townhome. </s>
<s> What is it is it what channel I have it on or what?Please help. </s>

<s> It says it up to date?I'm confused. </s>
<s> I can't tell what &quot;it&quot; is that said it is up todate. </s>
<s> Example? </s>
<s> Microsoft has this Update Driver button that would report such but it fails to check the maker's web site. </s>
<s> If that is all they give you, I'd ask for a refund. </s>
