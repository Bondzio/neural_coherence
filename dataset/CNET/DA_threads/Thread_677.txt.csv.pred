1.1.1	I am buying a MacBook Pro with a ss hard drive ( which is small ) , it has the nvidia 1gb graphics card .	St
1.1.2	I want to play many video games which require Windows , but most of these games take up quite a bit of space so I do not want to run bootcamp on the Mac ss .	St
1.1.3	Is it possible to take an external hard drive format the entire thing as a Windows 7 system and run this hard drive as an alternate with my computer for the use of video games ?	Ques
1.1.4	Also , I have USB 3.0 so it seems this would be the best connection for speed and price , am I right in thinking this ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	You ca n't install Windows on a removable drive .	St
1.2.2	But you can install it on the ssd under bootcamp , and then ( if the installer of the game allows it ) install the games on the external .	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	I do n't see any system or procedure to do what you asked .	St
1.4.1	So I was reading up on using bootcamp .	St
1.4.2	do many games require a C : drive install anymore or will external be fine .	St
1.4.3	Also , is USB 3.0 a fast enough connection for playing games ?	Ques
1.4.4	Sorry for the remedial questions it has been a while since I have done stuff with computer games .	St
1.5.1	Only the gamer can answer that .	St
1.5.2	All the games I 've seen run off some USB 2.0 do run fine .	St
1.5.3	There are delays in loading maps , or the game but they do run .	St
1.5.4	But then you have that gamer that wo n't accept any delay .	St
