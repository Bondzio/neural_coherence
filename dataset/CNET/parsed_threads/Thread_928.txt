<s> I am currently building a computer myself for the first time. </s>
<s> I am wondering if setting aside a hard drive just for windows 7 and another hard drive for all my games, video editing software etc will benefit me in anyway. </s>
<s> I currently have a Western Digital AV-GP WD10EVDS 1TB ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16822136496 ) and I was looking at buying Western Digital VelociRaptor WD3000GLFSRTL ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16822136375 ). </s>
<s> If seperating Windows and my software on seperate hard drives does benefit me, which hard drive should I put windows on and which one should i put my software on? </s>
<s> I even thought about putting windows on a SSD and using the velociraptor for software and the 1tb hard drive for just storage. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> In fact, I do have Win 7 installed on one. </s>
<s> But the issue of putting software on a different drive in another matter. </s>
<s> I don't do gaming but unless your games can install completely on a separate drive and put nothing in the Windows folders or registry, I'd not put them on a separate drive. </s>
<s> Most all software will put entries in the registry and add libraries and other parts of itself to the Windows folder regardless of where you target the installation. </s>
<s> In that case, I think it's best that the entire program be on the drive Windows boots from. </s>
<s> I'd reserve the larger drives for data storage and part of your backup scheme. </s>
<s> Part of my own backup scheme involves keeping entire primary HD images on larger internal and external drives as this allows me very quick and nearly complete disaster recovery capability. </s>
