That includes $89 for a copy of Windows XP Home.
That doesn't include a monitor or any other peripherals, just what was there.
I'm buying most of it on ZipZoomFly.
I'd prefer newegg, but I'm in Cali and the tax kills it.
Plus ZZF is offering free shipping on all the pricey components.
So looks like I'm going to order this stuff tonight.
