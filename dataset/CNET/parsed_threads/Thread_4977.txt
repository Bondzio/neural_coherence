<s> Bought this P4 desktop in 2001 or 2002, but it is tweaked to my liking, nice sound/video cards, plenty of RAM, fast enough, and I am not using it for advanced applications so I want to keep it. </s>
<s> I remember hearing that as computers age, some parts can go bad. </s>
<s> Should I replace the Hard Drive? </s>
<s> Also, is there some kind of aging issue with the BIOS? </s>
<s> I seem to remember that there is a BIOS chip or battery that might die after several years, rendering one's system useless. </s>
<s> Lastly, this may be a silly question, but I need to upgrade to USB 2.0, can I just buy a USB 2.0 PCI Card, and install it, or is a motherboard from 2001 not going to be able to handle it anyway? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> However I do need to remind myself to dust out the machines yearly and replace any failed fans. </s>

<s> MAKE SURE YOU UNPLUG THE PC FROM AC POWER BEFORE DOING ANYTHING INSIDE. </s>
<s> Re the rest...start by making sure it's 'relatively' dust free. </s>
<s> Especially make sure the CPU heatsink and fan are to the max extent possible free of dust. </s>
<s> Same with power supply and case fans. </s>
<s> The other thing is BACKUP ... storing your MUST HAVE DATA somewhere in addition to you PC HDD. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Yup I do make sure that it is relatively dust free, and I unplug and touch a ground first to de-static-ize myself b4 swapping out cards, etc. </s>
<s> There is a battery that keeps the BIOS alive when you turn the PC off. </s>
<s> They last 4-5 years. </s>
<s> It's located on the motherboard and is a flat, silver battery. </s>
<s> When it starts to die your clock will forget the time. </s>
<s> When this happens, replace it. </s>
