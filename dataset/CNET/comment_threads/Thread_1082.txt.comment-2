My guess would be the ASUS disk would be what is called a &quot;BOOT &quot; disk and what the store created were the OS disks.
You would use these for system failures and ONLY then.
The store disks (usually 2 or 3 DVD'S) would/should contain the total operating system and would restore the system back to &quot;as new&quot; .
The boot disk would be used IF the system failed to boot and would/could recover the system from within the system (OS).
ONLY use these IF you need to, store them in a safe location as a just in case.
