Hello I want to record videos with Fraps.
I want to buy a new PC that can handle the games bellow at full settings + recording at full size without lag (for me that means steady 60+ FPS).
What do you think?
My budget is around 1100$ or 800 I live germany but have the option to go to the US from time to time.
For the first step it would be good to find the parts that I need even if it goes above my budget.
Then we can find sales where I can match my budget.
List of games: -Splinter Cell Chaos theory -Splinter Cell Double agent -Splinter Cell Conviction -Call of duty 5 -Call of duty 6 -The elder scorlls 4: Oblivion (Guilds, expansions, Arena and main quest.)
