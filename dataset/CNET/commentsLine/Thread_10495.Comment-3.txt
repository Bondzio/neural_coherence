last fall i built two pcs similar to yours... intel 945 mobos, antec cases/power supplies, dual sata drives, p4d 3.0ghz in one, p4 3.4ghz in the other.
the first build went smooth as butter and booted up the first try.
the second one took me another 4 days because it wouldn't boot.
the lan leds would come on, the cpu fan would spin for a sec, then nothing.
i tore down the functioning pc and started swapping parts and still no luck.
my problem was the extra 2x2 pin mobo power connector (12v processor core voltage)... i forgot to plug it in.
hope your problem is as simple.
