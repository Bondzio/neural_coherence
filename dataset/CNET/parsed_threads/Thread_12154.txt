<s> I have a laptop with a 30GB hard drive that I use for architecture school. </s>
<s> Since I tend to create lots of graphic files (3d studio max, illustrator, photoshop, short animations), I generally create around 3-4 gigabytes of information every three months. </s>
<s> I have been burning cd's each semester to store old files that I only occasionally need to access for portfolio purposes. </s>
<s> I am now think about buying an external DVD burner as an alternative for storing those files. </s>
<s> From my perspective, it seems like it would be faster and make the process of accessing old files simpler (1 for each semester, etc) Is this the best option? </s>
<s> If so, do I need to get one that does -rw and +rw? </s>
<s> If so, can soemone tell me why? </s>
<s> Thanks Chris Becker </s>
<s> Here is what I do for my 30g laptop drive.... </s>
<s> It does not pay to buy a bigger laptop drive, not at all.. </s>
<s> They are way too expensive.... </s>
<s> I went and bought an external hard drive case (USB) which cost me $30 ......... </s>
<s> I then installed a 160g hard drive in it. </s>
<s> You could get a USB hard drive but also are expensive and at least with my scenerio I could remove drive from the case and put in my regular computer if I wanted to...... </s>
<s> It works fast and great..... </s>
