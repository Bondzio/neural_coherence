This was a blank card to start with onto which I installed maps while in a Garmin GPS ( Not me, the card.). I would like to change the configuration. I've erased memory sticks before with no problems. In other words I need to defeat the write protection.

Many users reported data loss when the switch was worn down or broken especially on early sockets where manufacturing process was not perfected or due to firmware bugs. Some devices also allow users to ignore write protect switch for user's comfort.&quot; I don't have your card to examine but it shows that write protection is not in the card but a function of the host device. So this leads us to try another host device or replace the card to see if the card has failed. I won't look into your user manual to see if your device can format a card. I leave that to you. Bob

I thought the lock lever on the card holder was to keep the micro card secure. I inserted the card in the holder and left the lever unlocked and it formatted just fine. Thanks again. Cnet does it again.

How do I get the interface to work or should I reformat then put the files back on? thanks
