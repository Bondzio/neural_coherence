Work in IT so got the tech tip to put it in the freezer for a bit (don't freeze just cool) as a last minute data recovery option. Will try tonight and let you know how it goes.

Use the disconnect icon to the lower right side of the screen. Yes I know it is suppose to be Puug&quot;n&quot;play but for some reason attached USB devices like hard drives and thumb (sticks) drives can loose the boot sector. Keep trying to get a read on the drive by using it on another system. If you can't, look into a restore program. Go to TUCOWS.COM and get all you want there.
