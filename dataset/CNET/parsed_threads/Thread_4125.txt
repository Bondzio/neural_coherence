<s> I'm looking to upgrade my wireless networking hardware. </s>
<s> One of my desktop computers has an adapter which allows it to use a wireless pc card (laptop style). </s>
<s> I know desktops usually have either PCI card or USB adapters in them but is there a disadvantage to using the cardbus adapter in the desktop? </s>
<s> Also, any opinions on D-Link routers/adapters vs. Netgear? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If the cost is ok and you get the drivers to work then you're done. </s>
<s> Support is rare for these PC-Card on desktop setups. </s>
