1.1.1	It is best to leave the HDD running all the time , or to shut it off whenever it is anticipated that the computer will not be in use for several hours or days ?	Ques
1.1.2	To me , a computer hard drive , like any other mechanical device with moving parts , is subject to physical wear and a finite lifespan , so it should last longer if it is not running for hours or days when not in use .	St
1.1.3	I have been running mine with the power options set to go into standby after two hours unattended .	St
1.1.4	But some of my associates are telling me that what kills HDD 's is the warm up and cool down process , and that they have left them running 24/7 for years with no problem .	St
1.1.5	Of course I always shut down completely and pull the power plug and cable connection whenever there is even the slightest threat of lightning .	St
1.1.6	After two computer hits in the past I do n't want to smoke this one .	St
1.1.7	But I am wondering if I am doing more harm than good to the computer 's internal HDD by turning it on and shutting it off every day .	St
1.2.1	for years , and there is still no difinitive answer .	St
1.2.2	It is almost like religion : there are those who say you must turn the drives off to prolong their life , and there are those who say you must leave them on to prolong their life .	St
1.2.3	Also , of course , there are those who say it probably does n't make any significant difference in drive life .	St
1.2.4	Few of these users are apt tto change their mind unless there is compelling physical evidence one way or the other -- and that is lacking .	St
1.2.5	This question is obviouly closely tied to the question of turning off the computer or leaving it run because concern for the drive is often quoted as a reason for one 's decision At one time in the past , I tended to leave things on 27/7 .	St
1.2.6	Then , as little evidence developed that the hard drive would suffer , I let power management shut it down after a period on no activity , but left the computer on .	St
1.2.7	Now , as I see no evidence that anything suffers , I turn the whole system off if I am not going to use it for a few hours .	St
1.2.8	Some say that when a computer is in standby it draws negligable power so it does not need to be turned off .	St
1.2.9	That is not true for mine ; I have measured it and it still draws about 50 watts in standby .	St
1.2.10	It is , therefore , energy savings that prompt my decision .	St
1.2.11	Hope this helps Frank	St
1.3.1	Different clocks in New Mexico ?	Ques
1.3.2	Agreed on your opinions .	St
1.3.3	My web server is on ( here in Texas ) 2 4 /7 but my main machine is shut down when I 'm not on it .	St
