Now he have: 1 intranet server (linux) also acting as an internet gateway (192.168.0.1), two NIC, one connected to a Cable modem (with FIX IP) and the other one go to a 24 port Switch. He have a Domain (aaaa.com) and subdomain (bbbb.aaaa.com) for his intranet, hosted by the ISP... (but the intranet data is on his server) Problem 1: When the internet is down, he can not access his intranet through the LAN. and now, He want to add a wireless router access point, which as a router it will have an IP of 192.168.0.1 (that is the same as his current server IP) Question: How do I set this additional wireless router? Or What should I do to correct any mistake that he make, if any? Thank You
