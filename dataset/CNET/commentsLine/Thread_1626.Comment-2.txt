note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
my first guess is that windows 2000 isn't properly installed.
try installing the latest motherboard chipset drivers.
i copied the forum note since without those details i can't be more specific.
