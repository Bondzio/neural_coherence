After accidentally deleting the needed data, one could use a data recovery programs or ask for a data recovery service from the expert and data recovery company.
But, the latter choice always needs much money.
So, if you have no much money for it, you could firstly try some drive data recovery freeware.
In fact, as I know, there are many drive data recovery freeware that could work much efficiently than some paid ones, such as Recuva, TestDisk and iCare Data Recovery Free, etc.
Therefore, do not save anything new on this formatted drive in case of data loss and select a proper data recovery program to take chances.
Good luck!
