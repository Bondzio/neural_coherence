i own a few eyefi cards and i have a few tablets but not the nook hd.
just an older nook.
my nook color as well as the nook hd have a microsd slot.
so you can check out  it appears you can see the pictures of standard jpeg.
sorry but i don't have the nook hd so i can't do more here.
-&gt; parting comment.
if support is that bad they can't answer your questions, why are you considering their product?
