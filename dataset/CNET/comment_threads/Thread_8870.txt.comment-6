I have a brand new Gateway, a one year old HP at work and a Two year old HP here at home along with Dell laptops.
I had huge amounts of problems with all the crap software put on systems by HP.
I had to do a reinstall of the operating system to make it run right.
The Gateway came out of the box pretty clean.
Only had to deleat a couple of programs.
Don't get me wrong all the computers have served me well.
I don't think the brand makes any difference any longer.
All the parts on the inside are the same and the company is only putting them all together.
Pick the one that best works for you and always try to buy more than you need so you can get many years of enjoyment out of your investment.
