also, testing this is a nightmare.
to change the settings on any of the devices i have to physically be there, but for testing i have to go outside of my network, which essentially requires me to drive to some place that has wifi.
and then back if i need to change something on a device, and then out again to test it.... does anybody know of a better way to test this?
finally, is there a log file somewhere on my laptop or the server that i could inspect for more clues about this problem?
thanks.
thanks
