if i had a cable modem to my switch and to the house, then not much would work proper.
if i wired my cable modem to the router, then router to switch to the house, then that's the common working setup.
i will not help people with the first setup since that's their choice and their headache.
i hope you understand why.
to place the printer on the proper network, you need a pc that shares the printer or one of dlink/linksys's printer sharing boxes.
your choice.
