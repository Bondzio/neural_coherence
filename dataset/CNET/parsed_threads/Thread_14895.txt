<s> hi all, I've currently beefed up my computer by installing an ATI Radeon X800 Pro graphics card and replacing my 512MB of RAM with 1GB (512MB x 2 Duel Crucial Channel Kit) However, whats seriously lacking in my comp is a new power supply. </s>
<s> My current PS is a pathetic 300w which is making other components in the PC under perform. </s>
<s> Now, I'm no expert when it comes to buying power supplies, so I thought I'd ask you guys. </s>
<s> What do I need to consider before buying a new one? </s>
<s> I'm aiming to purchase a power supply capable of generating between 400-450w. </s>
<s> If it helps, my current PC spec is as follows... Windows XP Home Edition 2.19Ghz AMD Athlon XP 3200+ 1.00GB RAM Sapphire Radeon x800 Pro gfx. </s>
<s> Motherboard: Manufacturer : ASUSTeK Computer INC. MP Support : No Model : A7NVM400 Version : Rev 2.xx Serial Number : MB-1234567890 System BIOS : 63-0100-000001-00101111-112503-nFORCE Thanks all. </s>
<s> your comp will use what it needs </s>
<s> Look here http://www.newegg.com/index.asp or here http://www.compgeeks.com/ Seems a 500w unit is about 20 bucks. </s>
<s> ====================== If you have a nice fat wallet look here. </s>
<s> http://www.pcpowercooling.com/ Caution it's not for the faint of heart. </s>
<s> Excuse if repeated... </s>
<s> Besides getting a 400W at least or more, you should seriously consider a &quot;quality&quot; unit as pricing pretty much separates the two. </s>
<s> Also, a build-in 2nd or dual fan setup for the p/s unit is practically a must to better handle its own heat plus any from the system. </s>
<s> If you don't do this, sooner or later you pay the price either in a failed system, of not only a doomed p/s but possible other componets going down as well. </s>

<s> go with anything above 400 from antec. </s>
<s> i have the 550 http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=20550 and it was not that expensive but is working very well. </s>
<s> watch out for the specs. </s>
<s> http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/index.html may also help you. </s>
<s> Willy, thanks for your usual good advice. </s>
<s> My question concerns the second power supply unit (PSU) fan you mentioned. </s>
<s> A PSU comes with a built-in fan and this fan exhausts itself outside the computer case, hence good cooling. </s>
<s> If we put in a second fan to cool the PSU, where would this fan go? </s>
<s> If it were an exhaust fan, wouldn't there need to be a second exhaust opening in the case? </s>
<s> Alternatively, if a cooling fan were just pointed at the PSU, that might not do anything more than move hot air from the PSU to another point inside the computer case. </s>
<s> Also, there would be other fans in the case, too: one for the CPU and another for the video card (all just assumptions). </s>
<s> All fans might just end up shuttling hot air from one to another. </s>
<s> PC Power and Cooling's web site says, &quot;a well-designed cooling scheme utilizing two fans is just as effective at ventilating your case as adding 15 fans with no overall plan&quot;. </s>
<s> How then can we come up with a well-designed cooling plan? </s>
<s> I know this may be difficult to describe without a diagram, but can you get us pointed in the right direction? </s>
<s> I believe you misunderstood. </s>
<s> The p/s units come with dual fans(already installed) actaully on the p/s unit. </s>
<s> The push and pull as it were to better handle the p/s unit demands to exhaust its own heat build-up. </s>
<s> The p/s itself will help vent system heat build-up but with dual fans it just gets the job done alittle better. </s>
<s> That doesn't exclude any other &quot;system case&quot; fan(s). </s>
<s> The system case *may* have an empty spot to install fan, use it. </s>
<s> If none present, then use the a slot fan that mounts in a empty buss slot either getting power from the slot or actual power harness. </s>
<s> These types of fans directly exhaust the system case plus may help vent the area next to a buss card or just the case itself. </s>
<s> Other fan(s) whose only purpose is simply to get &quot;air flow&quot; going to prevent &quot;dammed air&quot; sticking too long in any one area, like wire harness or along cards. </s>
<s> A well placed &quot;blow hole&quot; on top of system case helps alot as heat rises, but you usually have to make a hole and then install a fan. </s>
<s> As to the PCpower andCooling mentions, they basically say, you need a &quot;proper air flow&quot; to best handle heat situations. </s>
<s> That's why you see the frt. </s>
<s> case fan usually low, the rear exhaust fan, higher. </s>
<s> The orginal p/s unit fan(s) are carry over when that was that was needed, but more importantly it handled the p/s heat venting plus any system demands. </s>
<s> Of course, we've come a long way from that, some systems do have 4-6fans installed if air-cooled. </s>
<s> geeezzzzz enjoy -----Willy </s>
