alright, so i'm running on an old pc and i'm only able to buy an agp card.
i'm not much of a hardware junkie, so i've got very little knowledge, hence why i'm here.
so basically, i played on my dad's computer and i ran fallout 3 on some medium settings and low, and it ran fairly good.
he's hooked with all the same specifications as me, but he has an updated video card in which i'm saving up to buy.
the reason i've come here is to ask what you'd think would get a better performance.
i've found this card, &quot;his radeon hd 4670 iceq video card - 1gb gddr3&quot; and the card my dad has is a &quot;sapphire radeon hd 3850 video card - 512mb gddr3.&quot; here's the link to the specifications on the his radeon hd 4670 iceq :  and here's the link to the specifications on the sapphire radeon hd 3850 video card - 512mb gddr3 :  i was wondering if you guys could help me decide which one would run better, preferably for fallout 3, at medium to low settings (i'm not going for a high settings or anything).
also, you may be wondering so here are my full computer specifications, well the more important: operating system: windows xp pro (service pack 2) ram: 1gb (upgrading to 2gb of ram) video card: radeon x850 series (256mb ddr2) processor: pentium(r) 4 cpu 3.00ghz (single core, of course) if you want me to provide more information on my computer, i will gladly try my best to.
thank you, david
