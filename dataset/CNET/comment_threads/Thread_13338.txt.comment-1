I'm considering doing the switch and getting a mac laptop in the near future (after leopard comes out, that is), and I was wondering if there's any reason to get the macbook pro over the regular macbook.
I'm going to be doing mostly regular computer tasks, like word processing, internet browsing, more than a bit of photo editing, and a lot of music playing (not much video/audio editing that i could think of).
Would it be worth it to get the pro just for the discrete graphics card, processor that's a little faster, and a 2 inch larger screen?
Does it make that much of a difference, and is there anything that I'm missing that'd make the pro the (much) better choice?
