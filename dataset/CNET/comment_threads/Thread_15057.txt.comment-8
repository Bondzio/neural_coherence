Since your looking for vendor built PC's... Why not have a look at eBay?
They have so many pre-built PC's on ebay for cheaper than from an Official branded vendor.
I bought a full system with an AMD Athlon 3500+ for really cheap and it runs so so so so so well!!!!
EBAY IS A GREAT WAY TO LOOK FOR STUFF!!!
