1.1.1	Hello , I 'm looking design student looking for a printer , and we often print in sizes only a little bigger than standard letter paper ( such as 11x17 tabloid ) .	St
1.1.2	I currently have a basic HP All-in-One printer , but I 'm looking to upgrade to a larger one that prints 11x17 .	St
1.1.3	So then I 'm looking for a printer that can print formats as large as 11x17 ( larger is n't necessary ) , and that still has a flatbed scanner/copier ( fax not necessary ) .	St
1.1.4	Does this even exist ?	Ques
1.2.1	looking for , but be aware that these babies do n't come cheap .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.superwarehouse.com/Panasonic_KV-S3065CW_Sheetfed_Scanner/KV-S3065CW/p/473870	St
1.3.1	I got an email from Brother USA this weekend about their July 4th sale ( ends 7/9/11 ) , and it includes 2 inkjet MFPs with 11 & quot ; x17 & quot ; scanning & amp ; printing capability .	St
1.3.2	Here 's a link to a page on their website showing the specials : http : //www.brothermall.com/promotions/ ? PType=Rebate & amp ; pGrp=5 Both the MFC-J6510DW and MFC-J6710DW would meet your requirements , and at a considerably cheaper price than the wide-format MFP that Brechan linked to .	St
1.3.3	If you 're still looking for a wide-format MFP , both models sound like they 'd be well worth considering .	St
1.4.1	That you posted to a thread that is over 1 year old ?	Ques
1.4.2	He probably found something by now and moved on .	St
1.5.1	Yes , but this might be a topic others are interested in , too -- and those others might be interested in the sale I linked to .	St
1.6.1	The wide-format MFP linked to in Brechan 's reply to OP cost over $ 1,500 on sale .	St
1.6.2	At those prices , OP may well have still been looking for a less-expensive alternative , such as what I linked to ( $ 179- $ 229 on sale ) .	St
1.6.3	A $ 1,500+ printer would perhaps be within the budget of the university design department of OP , but NOT within the budget of a design student , as OP described himself/herself .	St
