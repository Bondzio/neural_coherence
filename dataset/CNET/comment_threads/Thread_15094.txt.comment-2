Find your favorite CAD and rendering software and see what it minimum and recommended system requirements are.
If you go (somewhat) above the recommended requirements you should be OK.

Things that probably matter: - CPU speed and number of cores - 32 or 64 bit OS - graphic card - amount of RAM - Windows or Apple or Linux Kees
