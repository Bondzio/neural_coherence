I recently receive an iPad for Father's Day.
It isn't a replacement for a computer.
It is however, a great device to use for what you need to use it for: Web browsing, emails, YouTube.
Download some Apps to make it more productive (some free, some cost $).
I also own an iPod Touch, and the iPad is much better to use.
The large screen is a pleasure to look at.
All of the iPod Touch screen manipulations function on the iPad too.
But the iPad doesn't connect directly to a digital camera (interface cables are available I think), nor can you install MS Office (but the iPad can download compatible programs).
