For some insane reason, after so many years with an HP desktop, i foolishly decided to take the hook, and by an imac osx 10.6.4 2.66 ghz intel core 2 duo 2gb 1076 mhz ddr3 ram.
Can anyone help me with a way to improve the audio??
I use a logitech x540 5.1 speaker system which sounds AWSOME on my old hp, but sounds like @#$% on this mac.
the store where i bought the mac suggested these speakers, said speakers i have no problem with.
Before i throw this mac out the 2nd story window, anyone have any ideas??
Thanks JC
