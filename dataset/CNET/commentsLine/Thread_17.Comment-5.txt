i am going to use that extra ram in cg aplications [computer graphic].
i want to speed up my manipulating and rotation in viewport.
number of polygons in my projects really increased since last semester, and it lags in big scenes.
do you think that extra memory i want to buy can help me in this kind of issue?
i think it will do some better performence, but if it is worth of 100 euros.
what do you think?
my os is 64bit.
