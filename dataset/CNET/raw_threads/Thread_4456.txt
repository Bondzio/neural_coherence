I am building a new PC with two CD drives using one from an older PC and a brandy new CD/DVD with all the fancy bells and whistles. They both play music CD's with the audio coming out on the Wave channel level control but neither one on the CD channel control. I checked the input pins on the mother board by injecting audio on both left/right inputs and they work OK. Also used a signal tracer to listen for signals on the CD output cable pins with dead silence. What am I missing? Is there a software switch to control the analog output from the CD's? All software switches are unmuted. 2.4 ghz. Viper Mach Speed Socket 754 Mother Board with AMD Athlon 64 3400+ CPU and XP Pro. Never experienced this in the many PC's I have built.. Thanks for any suggestions or leads... BigBill
