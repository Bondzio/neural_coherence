<s> I have been given an old Acer pentium 166 Mhz that I am fixing up for my 3 yr. old. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade the 32mb of memory which is 72 pin non-par FPM. </s>
<s> I have some EDO,will this memory work? </s>
<s> I can't give a 100% answer. </s>
<s> However, you can install and see if it works or not, it won't hurt the system thought it may hang. </s>
<s> If it works, then OK, if not, then you have to pick one type then find similar FPM or EDO of *all* same type. </s>
<s> Some systems you could mix types, but not all. </s>
<s> If you can google for specs on that model# Acer will give a more informed answer. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> the fpm and replace all with the edo. </s>
<s> The only other difference is the fpm is 70ns and edo is 60 ns. </s>
