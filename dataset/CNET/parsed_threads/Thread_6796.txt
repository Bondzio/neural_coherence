Will my Iomega product work with Windows Vista? </s>
<s> Question Will my Iomega product work with the new Microsoft Windows Vista operating system? </s>
<s> Answer Iomega is currently working to complete testing with the new Microsoft Windows Vista operating system. </s>
<s> In most cases, Windows Vista includes the drivers necessary to recognize Iomega drives. </s>
<s> Vista's native drivers should assign a drive letter to most Iomega drives in My Computer. </s>
<s> Important Note: This compatibility information is based on testing only with 32-bit platforms of Windows Vista and does not indicate compatibility with 64-bit Windows Vista platforms. </s>
<s> Iomega is still evaluating product compatibility with 64-bit platforms and will have more information available in the future. </s>
<s> REV Users: A new version of REV System Software is now available from Iomega that improves compatibility and makes several features available under Windows Vista. </s>
<s> To download the REV System Software version 5.0.0.8 for Windows Vista, please choose your Windows Vista platform: 32-bit | 64-bit. </s>
<s> Important: A REV disk formatted under Vista without the new System Software (version 5.0.0.8 or higher) will not work in previous operating systems, such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, or Mac OS X. Zip Users: IomegaWare software will not work with Windows Vista. </s>
<s> You will still be able to use your Zip 100MB, 250MB or 750MB USB, ATAPI, FireWire or SCSI drives in Windows Vista, but certain features supplied by IomegaWare will no longer be available, including: Long format (short format will still be available through native Windows Vista tools) Password protection Parallel Port Zip drives will not be supported in Windows Vista. </s>
<s> (note: please go to the site to see more I only copied partial description over). </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> please note.. </s>
<s> I don't know the update date of this list by iomega I recommend you talk to iomega before buying any of their product or transfer any hardware over from your old pc to your vista pc, they have a live chat that you can access thru their web site m-f. My 2nd recommendation is call or talk to them at least 3 times at different day and time and keep track of the rep name if you get 2 out of 3 with the same answers then you know you are not being told incorrect information. </s>

<s> Afetr several hours of effort I had discovered that the zip drive driver is not authorised / signed by MS so to resolve.... you can use run followed from &quot;cmd&quot; Then type ..... bcdedit /set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS Then reboot The read /write and eject functions should then work as on my System watch for any MS updates KB 932596 AND KB938979 which are integrity updates will counteract this adjustment and should be removed first. </s>
<s> ANYONE PLEASE ADVISE IF OK FOR YOU </s>
<s> Should have said.... this resolves the issue where the atapi driver has become a problem in Vista 64 SP1.The zip drive appears in Device Manager but not in My Computer </s>
<s> Iomega claims ALL their Zip Drives work with ALL operating systems. </s>
<s> Conversly the moderator of their Zip Forum admitted that only the USB Zips work in Vista. </s>
<s> I'm sure Iomega's lie is prompted by their desire to sell you plenty of Zip Disks for your non-functional drive. </s>
<s> Tried your fix using bcdedit/loadset loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKING. </s>
<s> No Luck. </s>
<s> Iomega loads their drivers and puts their icon on the drive but it can't be accessed even from an admin prompt. </s>
<s> Everytime after the driver program runs I get a message that an entry point could not be accessed for VERSION.DLL As I say the Moderator of the Iomega forum on Zips says only USB version will work but you look on Iomega's wesite (as someone noted above) and Iomega claims that an Atapi (internal) Zip will work in Vista. </s>
<s> If they can't write a driver to enable our Atapi Zips in Vista, Iomega should swap us out a rebuilt USB Zip for our Atapi. </s>
<s> That would be a measure of whether they care about their customers or the allmighty dollar. </s>
<s> The moderator of the Iomega Zip forum says catagorically that only USB will work with Vista.Iomega claims all their zips will work with Vista and true to the RIP-OFFS they are, continue to sell disks and drives as though that were true.My 250 Atapi will not work with Vista or Windows 7 even when I try to emulate hard drives,floppies, etc. </s>
<s> They are as dishonest as the day is long. </s>
<s> I have about 48 100 MB Iomega ZIP disks most of which were written with XP and W2000 although a lot were written with versions prior to W2000. </s>
<s> Vista sees the drive but doesn't read anything. </s>
<s> I have numerous downloaded apps on these disks either in .exe or .zip format which I can't use. </s>
<s> I'm not a newbie or a power user...somewhere in between. </s>
<s> Would appreciate and suggestions, directions, etc. </s>
