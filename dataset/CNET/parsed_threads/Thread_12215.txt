<s> My desktop PC internal card reader has begun to only appear as drives in explorer occasionally. </s>
<s> I have Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit). </s>
<s> I have disconnected the reader and reconnected but the problem persists. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled the USB controllers in Device Manager, also without joy. </s>
<s> The main area of concern is whether it's software or hardware. </s>
<s> Ask your machine's maker for what drivers and HELPER APPS they use. </s>
<s> In the beginning each slot would show as a drive in Explorer (circa 2000?) </s>
<s> and consumers were sorely confused so a change in driver and helper apps caused the drive to hide when there was no card in the slot. </s>
<s> HOWEVER this can cause issues if you are attempting to do data recovery since some recovery apps get blocked by the helper app. </s>
<s> My advice is to ignore it. </s>
