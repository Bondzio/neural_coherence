i want to view and record my current tv lineup to my pc.
i have a cable box from my cable company (astound).
will it go through the cable box for one channel viewing-recording or is there a way to bypass the cable box for simultaneously viewing and recording on the pc like a dvr does?
i have expanded basic cable programing.
also, what would be better: a usb tuner or internal tv tuner card and whats a good one for under $100.00.
thanks
