<s> Hello, I just purchased a USB 3.5G modem - model: K190 made by KTech and I need its drivers/software. </s>
<s> It doesn't work (except the extra SD memory card capability) as it doesn't have any drivers or software on it, contrary to what the store clerk said, maybe there's a defect because I already tried it on two different laptops. </s>
<s> Certainly, it didn't come with any CD or manual nor can I give it back. </s>
<s> The company doesn't have any website and there are no drivers to be found on the internet.. </s>
<s> I spent hours looking for the modem's drivers.. </s>
<s> I would be very grateful if somebody could help me out and if possible, send me the software/driver of this modem to my email address: gkmansion@o2.pl If somebody from this website doesn't help me, I will have to throw it away:( I paid $25 for it.. </s>
<s> I realize that for some folks it's nothing, but I'm quite poor and I can't afford to buy another model.. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time and help in advance. </s>

<s> Just purchased means you should return it if they don't supply those or the location to get the drivers. </s>
<s> Why would you throw the stick away since you just bought it? </s>
<s> Something does not make sense. </s>
