The Cat 5e jacks will work with Cat6 but the Cat6 will only function at Cat5e level.
Usually the 110 punchdowns are color coded so you shouldn't need any wiring guide.
Just wire both ends according to one of the standards -568A or 568B.
If you make a cable with 568A on one end and 568B on the other, you create a crossover cable.
This isn't what you want.
