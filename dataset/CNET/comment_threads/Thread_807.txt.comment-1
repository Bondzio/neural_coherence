Ok this has been happening for a while on my creative modemblaster which has its drivers updated by the way.
There are two inputs for the phone line, each time my modem dials out whether it be a successful dial or not it switches to the other input, the one where the phone line is not in.
So this leaves me waiting for a dial tone when i hit sign in, and if i dont hear one i must put the phone line in the other jack as soon as possible and then it will start to dial.
Anyone know how this happened?
thanks!
