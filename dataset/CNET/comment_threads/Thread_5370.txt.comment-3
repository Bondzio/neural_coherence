Playback Devices in the control Panel Sound are only active Realtek Digital Output with a green tick mark and the others are dim: ATI HDMI Output 2-ATI High Definition Audio Device Not Plugged in (with red downward arrow mark) ATI HDMI Output ATI High Definition Audio Device Not Plugged in (with red downward arrow mark) Speakers Realtek High Definition Audio Not Plugged in The active playback device is only the Realtek Digital Output: Realtek High Definition Audio Default Device.
So I am not able to select the listed playback devices to make it default.
I also checked the BIOS and the setup is: Onboard Device-- Standard High Definition Audio -- Enabled Front Panel Type Audio -- HD Audio SPDIF out Mode Setting -- SPDIF (I changed to HDMI) What I did in the past was I changed the graphic card PCIE Port such as the first time I used was the MSI Graphic Card in the PCIEX16_1 port and XFX was in PCIEX16_2 port then I changed it MSI was in the PCIE16_2 and the XFX was in the PCIEX16_1.
After I have problem of Playback sound device then I've changed like before.
When I tried to open the playback devices is also always slow.
