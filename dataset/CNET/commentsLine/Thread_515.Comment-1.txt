my d, e, and dvd drives are un-accessible and missing in windows explorer.
they also don't show up in &quot;disk management&quot;.
this is the second time in a week this has happened.
the last time it was fixed was after i rebooted the pc.
both times i was trying to play a song in itunes, when i was unable to access the drives.
my d drive is for my media files.
g is my bluray drive and works fine.
my dvd drive is l... i think.
how do i fix this?
thanks for any info!
