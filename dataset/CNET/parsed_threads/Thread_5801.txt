<s> Just installed a PCI based video card in my older desktop so that I can run dual monitors (one's on a serial port, the other is DVI). </s>
<s> I'm wondering if there is anyway to ALSO use the OEM/stock video chipset to run a third monitor at the same time on the original serial port? </s>
<s> We're using windows 7 here, if that helps. </s>
<s> Some of them will support two devices. </s>
<s> Being that there are two video cards installed, perhaps one of them is capable of running two. </s>
<s> What are the make and model numbers of the installed cards? </s>
<s> Most unlikely. </s>
<s> You want dual display then get a video card that supports it. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> That must be a typo or misunderstanding. </s>
<s> As to the onboard graphics, since some machines disable onboard video when a card is installed you can't tell if you can use that until you try it. </s>
