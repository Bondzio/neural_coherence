<s> I am looking to purchase Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and it is time to upgrade my ATI Radeon 9200 128 MB to something a little more powerful. </s>
<s> My motherboard only has an AGP slot and I have somewhat narrowed it down to these video cards: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1782292&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1240195&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1460940&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1240060&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 All of these ones are 256 MB NVIDIAs. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards the first one from PNY the 6800 GS. </s>
<s> I also found some 128 MB ones for a similar price: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1182887&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1121824&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 I'm thinking that 256 MB is gonna be better than 128 MB or is that not always true. </s>
<s> Anyway if anyone can help me choose a good one (either from these or another one) it would be much appreciated </s>
<s> ...then get the best card that will fit in your budget. </s>
<s> definitely get 256mb. </s>
<s> here's my pecking order for AGP cards $200 or less: $205: geforce 6800gs $170: radeon X800gto $120: radeon x1600pro </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> My budget is around $200, but I definitely wouldn't be averse to getting something decent for cheaper. </s>
<s> unless you're planning on playing elder scrolls at 1600x1200 or on a 19&quot; widescreen, they'll all do just fine. </s>
<s> they'll be a big stepup from a 9200. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> since u r using ati...wouldnt want to cause u trouble by switching here is a link to a decent card...it will be a huge improvement over the 9200 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102666 </s>
<s> Well I think I might end up going with the PNY geforce 6800 gs 256 MB one found here: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1782292&CatId=0 The only other ones I can find that are similar to what people have mentioned are these: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2111221&CatId=0 (this one is large but I could probably fit it in my case if I took out my useless dial-up modem card) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1904065&Tab=11&NoMapp=0 (a little more expensice than the others, also for the x-series of ATI cards, is a lower number a better card, as opposed to how it was with the 9000 series where a larger number was better) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1892411&CatId=0 (Again a little more expensive, but is it any better?) </s>
<s> Also being in Canada I can't order anything from newegg or zipzoomfly because they don't ship to Canada. </s>
<s> So I am pretty much stuck with Tigerdirect.ca, thought they do seem to have pretty reasonable prices) Any further help is appreciated. </s>
<s> ...Are the two best AGP cards. </s>
<s> The only thing is that thte X850 is getting a little old, and it has no Piuxel Shader 3. </s>
<s> You'll make a good choice going with either of them. </s>
