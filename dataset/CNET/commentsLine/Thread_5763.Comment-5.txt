hi.
i have a rather old desktop at home too.
the specs are: intel pentium iii 533 mhz (slot 1) dfi pa-61 motherboard (via 693/596 (pc-133)) 512 mb pc-133 sdram s3 prosavage3d 8mb 10 gb hdd windows me well, i'm planning to upgrade the computer in terms of changing the video card to maybe a nvidia geforce 2 or ati radeon 7500 (or something like that, not too expensive, but reasonable performance), and also the hard disk to 40 gb (because i need more space, plus the present hard disk is 3 years old already, i want to change it before it dies).
besides my above upgrades, are there any other upgrades recommended?
and, based on my current system, would you advise against me using windows xp?
thanks!
