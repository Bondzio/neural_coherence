Hi all Quick question; I am using Win XP home and when I go into my Device Manager under Display Adapters I have 2 listings - 128 DDR ATI Radeon 9700 TX w/TV-Out - 128 DDR ATI Radeon 9700 TX w/TV-Out sec Does this mean I have 2 video cards installed in my machine?
If i look at the back of my machine i only see one (I think).
I am looking to add a second monitor and wanted to make sure I need another before I do anything else.
Thanks, Mike
