It's not sure which one is better. And there's always the option to start all over with the same hardware by a system recovery, going back to factory conditions. Then it's just as fast as it was when it was new. Really. Then do all Windows updates, install the programs you still use, get back all your personal data from your backup and enjoy! Only if it's still slow then, new hardware is a necessity. Kees

Your specs are: http://reviews.cnet.com/motherboards/elitegroup-p4m900t-m2-1/4507-3049_7-33240795.html It shows it wide open for cpu upgrades, you need to decide which one you want. I suggest E6600. That way it replaces wit h a more powerful cpu. However, you can still find a &quot;E&quot; c lass that more faster, just visit the Intel support website and locate the E-class cpu and pick from the list. You'll want one that uses the LGA-775 socket so that is the clue besides the speed. I also suggest you do a bios update in order to allow the full spectum of cpu upgrades allowable. In this case, it seems you're good to go in quick swaqp and drop of the cpu. The nest suggestion is to increase the aramm amount in oder to better the overall handling of the system. That is as far as i would go. Take it further than that. tada ------Willy

Here's the cpu support list for that mobo. http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Product/Product_Detail.aspx?DetailID=822&CategoryID=1&MenuID=16&LanID=9 I suspect that's going to be e-bay type stuff so I'll let you do the shopping. Suggestion. Install 4GB of ram........seems to be the max for that mobo. Be malware free. Keep background stuff to a minimum.

The machine has the latest bios since it sees the e2200. DON'T fuss with that bios unless you have to...........you can turn the machine into a brick.

If that's not the case . . . no need for the BIOS FLASH/Update. Was only trying help with 'updating the BIOS before or after installing the new CPU' and definitely it's better to do it before before (if required) than after. VAPCMD
5448	10	575447	5373097	5372831	Willy	10/14/12 8:47 PM	1.35024762E12	What a bios update does	BIOS update, you need to check and verify what the current bios level is and compare to what the latest one is. That way, you see if there is a huge gap, you will need to update. While any bios update can potentially make your PC a brick, it will also if properly done, provide the greatest latitude of cpu to install. Bios updates were released just for that purpose besides any other glitches or corrections they did. Of course, you can buy the cpu and install and take it from there. However, if you get some cpu that &quot;suppose to work&quot; and doesn't generally speaking the bios update will more than likely correct that. In that case, you have to remove the new cpu return the old one and then bios update and when completed then install the new cpu. It would help that the support website provide what a bios update corrects or adds to the bios, but too often that is negated or very sparse. Bios update: adds more cpus to recognize, handle ram better, correct glitches, mtrbd. options increased/eased among other things. If all this is Greek to you, then allow someone locally to explain it all. I can only point you in the right direction and then you decide. I refrain from providing PC 101 courses. tada -----Willy

For your mobo.... none. ----------------- can i mix one with the other ? In theory...yes. ---------------- which is better ? For your mobo.....equal. ------------- What's happening is..........your mobo is running the 6400 ram at 5300 speed. That's as fast as the mobo can go. If you want to install another stick of 6400 it should work........just at 5300 speed.

I find folk new to this struggle the first time as we must remove the Heatsink+Fan unit then flip open a latch and well the usual. Sometimes the new to this owner forgets heatsink compound and ends up with a dead PC. -&gt; Are you sure this is a good upgrade? We know that for games, it's not the CPU that matters. Bob
5448	19	575447	5373371	5373310	Willy	10/15/12 12:53 PM	1.35030558E12	If you dare...	You have me worried as i don't suspect to see what you see. I understand the cpu maybe stuck and that's because the heatsink compound has apparently adheared too well. This should have been done after some use of the PC, then try to remove the cpu as the heat itself will lessen the adhesion of cpu to heatsink. Your mtrbd. has a small socket cage and the cpu BETTER remain inside and not stuck to the heatsink. There is also a fan mounting cage which should allow you unmount, by unscrewing it. Then you see the cpu mounted on socket. If you can, provide some pix, place some on a public viewing like Photobucket. So, a real picture of your dealing with sorta thing. If in some way the actual cpu is shown, it must be removed by pulling-up with deft care and ESD(static wrist band) being used in order to prevent static discharge damage. Here is the mtrbd. showing no cpu and empty socket from support website. http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Product/Product_Detail.aspx?DetailID=822&MenuID=16 there is no mounting setup for the fan shown. That comes later as part of the fan/heatsink install which has to be removed, you view what the cpu. http://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+replacing+lga775+cpu&oq=youtube+replacing+lga775+cpu&sugexp=chrome,mod=16&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 good luck ------Willy
