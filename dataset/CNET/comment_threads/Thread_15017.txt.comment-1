well today I come home and boot up my computer.
As soon as it boots my mouse doesnt work anymore and it says &quot;Power Surge On Hub Port&quot;.
I moved my mouse from the back usb port to the front and it works but my keyboard still will not work.
I was looking around in device manager and disabled my mouse LOL!
=(.
Can anyone help me here?Any help would be GREATLY GREATLY appreciated, Thanks.
