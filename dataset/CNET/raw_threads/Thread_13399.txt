I have a 2Ghz celeron, XP, and an audigy sound card... now for some reason, its making a popping sound whenever i try to play a CD or a DVD, yet a mere 3 weeks ago, when i installed the card, it was playing back perfectly fine. all other sound is fine, it only 'pops' when i have a CD/DVD in the drive, so i know theres nothing wrong with the speakers. i was wondering if any of you nice clever people knew what i have to change/hit hard, to sort my problem out!? greatly appreciated!!!

Pass all scans I note and be free of all PESTS with the Anti-Parasite Suite I listed at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 4. Before above, try a headset or other speakers to make sure the amplified speakers are not the cause. Bob
