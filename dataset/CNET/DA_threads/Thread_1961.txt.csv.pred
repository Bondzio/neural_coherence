1.1.1	situation : fresh install of windows 7 ultimate 64 bit new hardware : ( cpu , motherboard , ram , gpu and psu ) so i 'm getting these squares ( 5mm x 5mm ) scratchy looking artifacts on the desktop , sometimes they blink sometimes they dont .	St
1.1.2	they vanish when i click around .	St
1.1.3	weird , i can only get a screenshot when it happens to the desktop screen , when other apps are open and they come out and then & quot ; print screen & quot ; , they dont show up on paint .	St
1.1.4	i then disabled the video card and use the mobo 's integrated gpu instead .	St
1.1.5	after obseving , the artifacts dont show up anymore .	St
1.1.6	so i was certain i got a defective video card , and yes i managed to get it replaced by the vendor .	St
1.1.7	after another session of formatting and reinstalling of win 7 and the NEW video card , they showed up again .	St
1.1.8	so it wasnt video card after all .	St
1.1.9	my new theory is that the video card ( PCIe ) slot in the mobo is defective .	St
1.1.10	is this possible .	St
1.1.11	help me diagnose this .	St
1.1.12	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	i first noticed the artifacts on the fresh install of win7 , no graphics driver installed yet i then installed the driver that is included in the package of the gpu , artifacts show up i then installed latest driver , still artifacts show-up last test , i downloaded a trial version of win 7 , still they show up .	St
1.2.2	i 'm at my wits end .	St
1.3.1	I did have this happen on a failing video card , however .	St
1.3.2	The card had bad caps but even that could have been due to dragging down the PS .	St
1.3.3	Tell more about your hardware including the video card and PS wattage .	St
