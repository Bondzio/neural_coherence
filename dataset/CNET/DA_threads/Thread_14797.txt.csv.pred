1.1.1	I accidentally spilled water on my Acer Aspire One D250 netbook .	St
1.1.2	I quickly took out the battery and dried it for a few days .	St
1.1.3	Afterwards , the netbook worked but the left half of the screen is very dim ( not dark ) where you can barely make out the images .	St
1.1.4	The right half displays normally .	St
1.1.5	Also if you look closely , you can make out a water stain in the center of the left ( bad ) half .	St
1.1.6	If I attach the netbook to an external monitor , the display is good , so I know that the video card and motherboard are good and the problem lies with the lcd screen .	St
1.1.7	Do these symptoms probably indicate that the screen needs to be replaced or is it the inverter only ?	Ques
1.1.8	I do n't want to replace both since it could get expensive .	St
1.1.9	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Usually dinner money .	St
1.2.2	LCDs however run about 1/2 the price of a new machine .	St
1.2.3	Take a chance on the inverter but I doubt it because all the inverters I know are all or nothing .	St
