<s> i have a macbook pro (the first generation) with 2.16ghz core duo and 1gig of ram (hopefully upgrading that soon). </s>
<s> i was hoping to be able to install vista on an external harddrive and somehow run it with bootcamp without installing it directly onto my laptop's on-board harddrive. </s>
<s> any suggestions as to how to go about doing this? </s>
<s> So far, no version of Windows runs off external drives. </s>
<s> I have not read of a successful external drive install of Vista yet so you would be the first. </s>
<s> Let me be clear that said externals are connected with USB or Firewire but not SATA. </s>

<s> does that &quot;no version of Windows runs off external drives&quot; apply to all machines or just the Boot Camp mac? </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> Windows versions from Microsoft. </s>
<s> Not going to comment on hack jobs. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> USB, Firewire drives. </s>
<s> With that short constraint list, no version of Windows installs and runs on external USB, Firewire drives. </s>
<s> Yes there is BART, but that's a hack, doesn't run everything and is a hack. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> and a little surprising. </s>
<s> I have been booting off external drives, SCSI & Firewire(no usb) since my first Mac. </s>
<s> I thought that the Primary drive only, boot thing had moved along. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I thought that if I installed OSX on an external drive, then booted off of that drive to install BootCamp on it I could get around the internal drive requirement, but it did not work. </s>
<s> Maybe they'll finally let you do that with 10.5. </s>
