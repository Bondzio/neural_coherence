I bought an HP-branded 950XL Black cartridge for it and it just ran out of ink. I refilled it using ink from a refill company that I've used many times over the years in other HP printers, and I followed the instructions on refilling it which included having to drill it through the little ball on the bottom to get ink into it & then plugging the hole, which worked out fine. But when I try to print now, it says the cartridge is depleted. Here's what all I've tried --- I've been told this printer has a menu item that says &quot;Cartridge Chip Information&quot; that would allow me to stop it from checking the cartridge chip, but mine doesn't, so I'm guessing that's an older model. While searching for a solution, I noticed that at least one other person has the same problem with not having that menu item & they never found any help for it either. I tried reinstalling the printer & the software, but no luck. I also tried the alleged factory reset method, but it doesn't work; that's where you turn it off, wait 10 secs, then turn it back and press the leff arrow 4 times when it first comes on. I tried this at various points that might constitute the generic phrase &quot;when it first comes on&quot;, including when the green power button lights up, when the HP splash screen starts, when the PC gives me a notification that it recognizes the printer is on, and after the main menu comes up, all to no avail. FYI, there's nothing in user manual about resetting anything except the network info. I also couldn't access the alleged &quot;secret menu&quot;. I also tried unplugging it & replugging it in, also cutting off the power source abruptly at the surge supressor I use, both with no luck. If there is no workaround on this, I'm getting rid of it & will look for another inkjet printer that can copy/scan/print & will allow me to use either remanufactured OEM cartridges or generic cartridges to refill on my own. Any suggestions for one that will give me little problem with that & will run on Windows 7 Ultimate OS?

I've done a lot of research on this today and it seems that you can't swap out or reset an HP OEM cartridge chip anymore, but you don't need to. The trick is simply to use 2 OEM cartridges. You can't refill one & put it right back in --- you have to use a different one, but you can swap them out each time. Apparently the printer knows if the previous cartridge was put back into it, but it can only remember the last one, so if you use cartridge #1 & it goes empty, put cartridge #2 in, then when #2 empties, you put #1 (refilled) back in and it should work, and then refill & use #2 when the refilled #1 goes empty. Note that I haven't tried this, but I saw more than 1 site that said it worked, including this YouTube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Rv7rnfnsg I'll try this and see what happens. Any other suggestions (that truly work on this printer/cartridge) are welcomed. I've seen that some HP inkjets can have their chip swapped out, but this generation of printers/cartridges seems to have caught on. I imagine the next generation will blackball any cartridge that has ever been used anywhere, or the cartridge itself will go bad after the 1st use. Too much money is riding on this for HP to not make an effort to thwart refills for good. The only way it's going to change is for Congress or someone with deep pockets suing them to stop them from polluting the environment with empty cartridges & using monopolistic business practices to secure their profits.
