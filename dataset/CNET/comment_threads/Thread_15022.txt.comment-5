Another thing: I was able to connect to the county's wireless on Monday afternoon with only one minor glitch.
That glitch was that my machine didn't automatically detect the wireless system when I fired it up, but I soon found it by hitting the &quot;Connect to:&quot; button on the Start button.
It then performed a search for wireless connections and found the library system.
So why in hell couldn't it find it yesterday when I was trying from the same exact spot in the library I used on Monday?
