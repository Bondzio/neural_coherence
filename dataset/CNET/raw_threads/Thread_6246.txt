Right from the start, I received great customer service on what components would work best for me. The specs on the computer I built are as follows. Lian Li Full Tower Chassis (HUGE, I didnt realize how big it was) Core i7 920 (overclocked for free to 3.8) 1000w corsair modular power supply Asus Rampage 2 Extreme Aftermarket Fans / Heatsink 6 GB OCZ Reaper 1866 DDR3 Ram Nvidia GTX 295 WD Velociraptor 300gb DVD Burner w/ lightscribe I also had the chassis custom painted Audi Blue. Its amazing looking, and is very durable. It only cost 99 bucks, I was expecting it to be cheap paint but its full blown high quality stuff. I couldnt be happier with my purchase. Just wanted to give them the thumbs up on a job well done. Anyone else have any experiences with them ?

If you want to order game currency.....I mean computers...common guys, use your head. For more info about Visualdreamers.com, go to the link below.

It is important to know how long a business has been runing, especially when they are offering warrenty information. If you visited archive.org, you would notice that in 2007, that Visualdreamers was a movie selling company. In 2009, it started selling computers. If you feel like shellinng out 2000+ dollars to them, be my guest. I don't like seeing people get sucked into these. I was a victim before, luckily it only costed me 30 dollars.
