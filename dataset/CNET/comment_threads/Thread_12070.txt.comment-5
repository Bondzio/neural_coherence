I have used nothing but Athlons in the systems I have built, and must inform you that efficient heat transfer for this chip is critical, and indeed, AMD go to great pains to stress this.
This would be accentated with the Barton core, as the die has less area of contact with the heat sink.
Thermal interface material is required on ALL AMD processors!
