I jsut bought LG GSA 2164D External DVD Burner since i got it for $50 and i no the price is awesome for an external burner with dual-laye burning facility. I searched online for it and u can't buy it for less than $100. I am still confused if i should keep it or not as i am not a DVD Burner EXPERT. The specs for the Burner are as followed: Reads/Writes all DVD/CD formatsincluding DVD-RAM Max. 16x DVD+-R Write Speed Max. 48x CD Write Speed Supports Double Layer DVD+R, Dual Layer -R Discs (8.5GB) High Speed Media Support 2MB Buffer with SuperLink Buffer Underrun Error Protection Windows ME/2000/XP Compatible All-In-One DVD Writing Software & Cables Included USB 2.0 Port for Fast Data Transfer Writing Speed Optimized for Each Media Type Source: lge.com CAN U SIMPLY TELL ME IF IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT TO KEEP OR NOT? THANX IN ADVANCE
