Earlier tonight it was raining by my house so I turned off my PC after there was a short power outage.
A few minutes ago my dad came over to use and turned it on and it wouldn't work.
The boot screen showed up and it asked me if I wanted to start up the desktop normally or in safe mode.
Thinking nothing was wrong, I chose normal and then to my surprise, after the boot screen showed up, the monitor went blank.
I then tried turning it off by pressing the Power button, but it wouldn't so I had to unplug the power from the back.
I started it over and started it in Safe Mode which worked.
I'm going to try reinstalling Windows, but before I do that I wanted advice from you guys.
As for system info, I've got a Gateway 504GR with WinXP Home edition with integrated gfx (for those who think it might be my gfx card).
Please help!
