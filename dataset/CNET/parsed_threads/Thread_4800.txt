<s> I had to send my computer out to Geek Squad due to it wouldn't start. </s>
<s> They replaced my video card, for which it took them 5 weeks, and I finally got it back last week. </s>
<s> Now my computer is booting and running very slowly and my USB 2.0 ability has disappeared, and I only have USB 1.0 abilities. </s>
<s> It is taking my 160 gig IPod 5 x's as long as normal to sync. </s>
<s> Anyone who can unlock this mystery would be very much appreciated. </s>
<s> If working before but not after, I'd take it back. </s>
<s> I'm sure the long wait the last time would make you hesitant but you should at least call it to their attention and mention it came back to you with a problem it didn't have before. </s>
<s> See what they say. </s>
<s> Good service should always include a thorough test before returning something to a customer. </s>
<s> You don't just fix what's broken and hand it back. </s>
<s> You look for other problems and advise the customer of these while the product is in your hands. </s>
<s> But without make, model, versions of drivers, the OS this conversation can't start. </s>
<s> Are you seeing the words in red today? </s>
<s> Make Acer Model M5630-U5052A Version of Drivers USB Root Hub is Microsoft 6.0.6001.18000 USB Universal Host Controller is Intel 8.2.0.1008 OS Windows Vista w/ Service Pack 1 </s>
<s> I just used the Restore DVDs on an Acer. </s>
<s> Try that next. </s>
<s> If you have the restore/recovery CDs, use them to reload the USB ability and/or drivers. </s>
<s> If you don't have them, then inquire at Acer, there maybe a small cost or argue for them as you didn't get them. </s>
<s> Its avaluable item to have, regardless. </s>
<s> The Cd should provide a menu item to load USB directly, if not then the Acer support website should provide them. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> A hard drive had previously crashed on my Acer, and I made the mistake of having a good friend install Vista on a new hard drive, so my system is no longer considered Acer OEM, and they say there is nothing they can do to help me. </s>
<s> Head to Acer for motherboard and more drivers. </s>
<s> Here's the rub, Acer is your primary support website for the &quot;product brought&quot;. </s>
<s> Once you devived from that you pretty much are on your own. </s>
<s> Vista has the nasty habit of not providing any or on a timing basis the drivers or s/w required to run on your system. </s>
<s> Not just Acer but any OEM build one. </s>
<s> It just harder, so you have to surf and match your device to the proper driver. </s>
<s> In the case of USB, the XP(if that what you had originally) should be capable of driving Vista. </s>
<s> The rub also exists that the OS itself provides drivers and shouldn't need any. </s>
<s> But some chipsets maybe better driven by the OEM supplied drivers. </s>
<s> Goto: http://www,usbman.com or any other USB help website and find a possible driver for your mtrbd. </s>
<s> USB chipset, just be sure what you have. </s>
<s> It maybe VIA, NEC, or other brand so match what is needed. </s>
<s> If you check under the device mgr. </s>
<s> it should post what USB hub is present and go from that. </s>
<s> adios -----Willy </s>
<s> But I'm in the USA. </s>
