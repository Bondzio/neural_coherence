<s> I am trying to set up a network for my parents. </s>
<s> My mom just bought a new laptop and wants to be able to network it to the desktop for transfering files and printer usage. </s>
<s> I have now spent the last 4 hours fighting it and could use some help. </s>
<s> I have gotten both computers on the 'net by way of a Linksys router and SBC DSL. </s>
<s> That end works fine. </s>
<s> For the networking part tho, I get a inaccessable error. </s>
<s> The laptop is an Acer using wireless. </s>
<s> The desktop is an older Compaq which is wired to the router. </s>
<s> Both are running XP home. </s>
<s> I have run the XP network setup wizard on both computers. </s>
<s> I can see the Compaq from the Acer. </s>
<s> I can see the Acer and all shared folders from the Compaq. </s>
<s> I cannot move files or folders from or to either computer. </s>
<s> Both are running Windows firewall. </s>
<s> I have checked the exceptions list to make sure that file and print sharing is allowed on both comps. </s>
<s> I have tried disabling the firewall on both comps to eliminate that as a possibility (didnt matter). </s>
<s> I am sure that I am missing something simple (and prolly stupid) but I am stuck. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> Did you right click the folders and click on the sharing tab then enable them to be shared? </s>
<s> Did you right click MY computer and click properties, click computer name tab, click change and click on Workgroup button and the workgroup NAME has same name on each pc? </s>
<s> Also make sure both pcs have different names for the PC name....Workgroup same, PC different. </s>
<s> Are you running any other firewalls like ZoneAlarm? </s>
<s> If so, do away with windows firewall and manually enter the ips into the trusted zone on both pcs. </s>

<s> I have shared the my documents folders, and a couple of others, on both computers. </s>
<s> The workgroup name is the same for both as well (MSHOME). </s>
<s> The only firewall being used is the Windows firewall, and I have tried disabling it to no avail. </s>
<s> As I mentioned, both computers can ''see'' each other. </s>
<s> The Compaq can also see the shared folders on the Acer. </s>
<s> The Acer can only see the Compaq computer name. </s>
<s> Shared printers can not be seen. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> The printer has to be installed on the pc trying to share it. </s>
<s> If you are having file sharing problems then it still may not see the printer but you can take your printer driver disk and install it on the &quot;assume laptop&quot; and then it will be able to share the printer. </s>

<s> Just had someone else who said they had to reset the Linksys router and it cleared everything up, there is a reset button on it so perhaps give it a try. </s>

<s> Went by my moms this evening to try a few things I read about on the web. </s>
<s> Just for giggles, I connected my personal laptop to the network (wirelessly) to see which computer I could connect to and so on. </s>
<s> I was immediately able to access my moms laptop (the Acer) and she was able to access mine. </s>
<s> The desktop (Compaq) was able to see and access all shared folders on BOTH laptops. </s>
<s> It was also able to transfer files and folders between the 3. </s>
<s> Neither of the 2 laptops were able to access any files or folders on the Compaq (desktop). </s>
<s> You can see the desktop on both laptops, but if you try to access it, you get the error &quot;Network Path Not Found&quot;. </s>
<s> Also, fwiw, the icon for the Compaq is dimmed on both laptops. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=318030 let me know. </s>
<s> thanks for all the help. </s>
<s> As it turns out, the problem was an old Cisco VPN that was set up on the desktop. </s>
<s> Uninstalling the VPN immediately fixed the problem and got the communication back. </s>
<s> Thanks again Craig </s>
<s> Thanks for posting back and glad it worked out. </s>
