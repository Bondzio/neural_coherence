<s> Hello All, I am planning to take a backup of pictures on a DVD. </s>
<s> They include half of my wedding pictures, scanned as a tiff file. </s>
<s> I wonder what experts suggest as a best method of backing up these pictures. </s>
<s> At this moment, I am planning to backup on TDK Scratchproof DVD+R and on DV tapes (I don't know how I can backup on DV tapes but I have heard that it is possible) Any other wise method or this is enough? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> back up on DV tape? </s>
<s> Any pointer on that? </s>
<s> There is a lot of junk on the internet I have decided to use Scratchproof TDK discs as we don't get Taiyo Yudens here so I thought this one as best bet.. </s>
<s> i'd recommend Acronis True Image. </s>
<s> it can backup directly to DVD and u do not need any other 3_rd party software's(like Nero). </s>
<s> beside it has many other useful features. </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> just forgot to give link (maybe that won't be even useful), but anyway... </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply but my issue is with the media, no matter which program you use, its very essential that your media survives that lifetime, else alls in vain. </s>
<s> I am pretty much baffled with the media. </s>
<s> Scratchproof DVDs have been working great so far at my working place but we never back it up on the tapes so I am looking for some method to backup on the DV tapes. </s>
<s> I guess they would last longer than DVDs if stored well. </s>
