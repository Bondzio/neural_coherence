in computer management/disk management, open help, go to the index, and open the importing disks , overview topic.
the command line info should be what you need.
btw, location 0 is the position of the disk on its controller.
i assume the usb disk is the only loaded/connected usb drive and is thus location 0. your c: drive is location 0 on your hd controller.
