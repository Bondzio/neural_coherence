I found a PC and I was trying to find info (specifications) on the motherboard but I dont seem to find any...So can someone try and help please...?
It has a type of chip that has a VIA logo with the characters: VT82C686B .
I tried google-ing this up but no luck... Any more info you might need to try and figure the specs out just let me know.
