Hello, I bought a Dell inspiron 546 that comes with a intigrated ATI radeon HD3200 graphics card recently.
I also purchased an 23&quot; ASUS VH-232H monitor.
For some reason the desktop screen won't fill the entire 23 inch screen.
I'm getting black bars around the edges of the monitor.
Is this a limitation of the video card or something I'm missing with the settings?
Thanks in advance for your help.
