keldawwg & ssedlymayrvery impressive dissertations on the whole harddrive subject.
geewiz, makes me feel that everything i might have believed about hard drives was wrong.
interesting idea about turning the hd so the pcb is face up.
never would have dreamed of doing that.
must be like eating a peanut butter sandwich with the wonder bread turned ass backwards.
makes sense from a cooling stand point, though.
and i'm sure the hd has no idea that it's inverted and will read and write the same.
as far as using small capacity, slower speed drives, i'm not sure that's practical for most people today.
where it makes since from a temperature and drive reliability standpoint, it may not in other ways.
for one, you'd likely wind up with more drives in your system--more combined heat--to compensate for the lesser storage capacity of the individual drives.
but, hey, i guess life is filled with compromises.
leaving space between the drives is a great idea.
sometimes the obvious things are the ones that we tend to skip over.
and best of all, this one bit of technology that wont cost me a thing to implement.
lastly, should your drive be hot to the touch after normal use?
i mean, obviously it would be warm.
but should it be uncomfortable to hold in your hand immediately after turning your system off?
