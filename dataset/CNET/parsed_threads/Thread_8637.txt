<s> Greetings everyone, I recently purchased an Acer Aspire T135. </s>
<s> While I've been very happy with the machine's performance, one thing in particular is causing me some, albeit minor, frustration. </s>
<s> At times when I am running a few programs (e.g., Firefox, Windows Media Player, & Spybot), the CPU fan kicks into high gear, which leads to an increase in the noise factor. </s>
<s> I've also noticed that when I plug a USB flash drive into the PC, the CPU fan kicks into overdrive (even if I'm not using any programs at the moment). </s>
<s> Furthermore, when I log into my Yahoo email account (web-based) and go to my Inbox, the CPU fan kicks into high-speed and the webpage takes a few seconds to load (not extremely slow, but not expected with broadband). </s>
<s> Once the page loads, the fan slows down. </s>
<s> I understand that when the CPU has to work harder, the fan speeds up in order to keep the processor cool. </s>
<s> What I'm confused about is why the fan speeds up when the USB drive is plugged in or when I access my Yahoo email Inbox (I'm also confused about why the Yahoo email Inbox wepage is slower to load than most webpages). </s>
<s> Any thoughts on why these issues may be occurring? </s>
<s> Also, I'm looking to purchase a new CPU fan and heatsink -- one that's quieter and will keep the processor much cooler. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on what to purchase? </s>
<s> A friend recommends either Zalman or Arctic. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> My specs are as follows -- Motherboard Name: Gigabyte GA-K8VM800M Motherboard Size: 220 mm x 240 mm Motherboard Chipset: K8M800 Bus Type: AMD Hammer Form Factor: Micro ATX CPU Type: AMD Sempron, 1800 MHz (9 x 200) 3100+ CPU Alias: Venice-256 S754 Package Type: 754 Pin uOPGA Package Size: 4.00 cm x 4.00 cm Memory: 1024 MHz DDR SDRAM PC 3200 (2 x 512) Thanks in advance, Jason </s>
<s> When you plug in the USB drive this likely leads to Windows starting to process to communicate with that device and possibly index the files or other things that add more work to the processor. </s>
<s> The Yahoo! </s>
<s> issue is likely due to how Yahoo! </s>
<s> has configured their web-based e-mail to have a lot of something called AJAX so that there is quite a bit of JavaScript to be downloaded when you first hit the page as well as run various scripts. </s>
<s> I don't have any suggestions for fans and heatsinks but I would suggest reading up on various reviews so that you do get what should work best for you. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> get a voltage controller called Zalman Fan Mate 2. </s>
<s> Then turn off CPU temperature control in BIOS. </s>
<s> Set the fan speed to whatever noise level you can tolerate. </s>
<s> If the CPU shuts down because it gets too hot, you will definitely know it, but I doubt it will. </s>
<s> Have fun! </s>
<s> Sounds like the fan is doing what it is designed to do. </s>
<s> CPU gets hotter, fan gets faster. </s>
<s> Get a can of compressed air and blow the dust out of all filters, fans, and heatsinks. </s>
<s> Download and install SpeedFan to get temperature and fan speed data. </s>
<s> What temperatures do you see? </s>
<s> Any fan behaviour or temperature change when running the computer with the case opened? </s>
<s> You may benefit from just reapplying the thermal compound (remove old and apply new according to compound's directions). </s>
<s> An alternative may be to just replace the heatsink fan with the largest fan that will fit the heatsink. </s>
<s> Of course, this is not possible if the fan is part of the heatsink--get the new heatsink and fan (HSF) if that is the case. </s>
<s> * * * * * Consider upgrading to a socket 754 Athlon 64. http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ClassValue=Motherboard&ProductID=1919&ProductName=GA-K8VM800M The retail version (not OEM) will include a new HSF and thermal compound/thermal pad. </s>
<s> The only problem is that the socket 754 Athlon 64's are getting scarce and haven't dropped in price as the socket 939 models have. </s>
<s> Bummer. </s>
