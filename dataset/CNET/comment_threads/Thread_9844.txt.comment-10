I had three diff routers before this one.
I did the DMZ open prt forwarding ALL the things forums said, and nothing helped!
The NETGEAR WNR2000v2 has to the best router ever for MWCOD,and black ops and any xbox 360 game!
All I did was plug it up and it ran!
Open NAT every time, no configuration, It even saw the gateway without cofiguration.
It has a good range as well on the wireless.
If your fighting the open NAT like I was, You will love this router!
