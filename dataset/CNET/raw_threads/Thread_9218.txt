I'm a graphic designer so its got the usual line up of graphics software: Adobe CS2, a couple of web browsers (Safari and Firefox), pictures in iPhoto and some music in iTunes (but not a lot.) It's apparently 75 GB hard drive with 15.31 GB available. For the last several months it sounds like the fan is running all the time. Sometimes it sounds like two fans are running - kind of a &quot;whirrrrr&quot; sound. It stops when I put it to sleep or shut it down. Is this a cause for concern? Do these things run hot after a while or do I have some bigger issue to deal with? Thanks in advance for your help. Tony

Make sure you clean the CPU cooler well, this is most likely the source of the problem. Gently wiggle the CPU cooler and see if it's tight to the mother board. Don't force it. Try to keep your hands off the metal components. Try these two suggestions first. The cleaning should be done periodically depending on how often you use the laptop. You will need to decide how often that will be.

Once you have followed the other posters advice, see if running one graphic program at a time produces the increased fan noise. I had a copy of SNOOD, that well known graphics program , that took 100% of the processor, which in turn made the fans go so fast that it sounded like a freight train. Once I had made the connection, SNOOD went out the window. Check out Activity Monitor, Applications &gt; Utilities, when the fans spin up and see if you can spot what is going on with the system. P

I often have the iBook's internal fans kick on if I'm not using the chill pad but hardly ever, when the chill pad is connected and running. Rubber pads also allow air to circulate under the iBook for better cooling. For convenience and portability, I used self stick velcro tape to connect the iBook's bottom side to the plastic, lightweight chill pad. This way, it moves around the house as one unit. I have handed it to people who never realized the chill mat was not part of the computer. Since I run Tiger on my G4... I use a widget called iStat Pro to monitor functions and hardware. Temps on CPU, RAM, and HD can vary as much as 15 degrees Fahrenheit, when I use the cooling pad on my lap top. If I get another laptop, I will definitely get another cooling pad (no matter what brand) for it. It performs better and stays cooler, and I expect a longer operating life out of it because it has seen less wear and tear (heat wise). cheers grim PS: in the time I took to write this, I turned off the chill pad's fans... and the CPU temp rose from 122F to 128F.

I note you don't claim to own one or use one but I will concede that you know what one is. On what do you base your comment? Just wondering if it was based on any factual information, first hand experience, etc.. How's the eMachine running? P
