you can oc using this.
i have a 5700le oc'ed to over 100mhz from stock core and mem.
o unlock coolbits: 1. open the start\run dialog box, and type regedit and hit ok 2.browse to: hkey_local_machine\software\nvidiacorporation\global\nvtweak\ 3.then right click and go to new and choose dword value 4. rename the dword value the comes up to coolbits(without quotes) 5. right click on it to modify it 6. and then change the value to 3 and the base to decimal once you do this, go back to your nvidia control panel.
you should see some new options.
one of these options is clock frequency settings.
select this, click manual overclocking and then hit detect optimal frequencies.
ive found this to be fairly reliable.
however use this at your own discretion.
keep on eye on temperatures in your case.
