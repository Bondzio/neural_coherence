i'm not sure what kind of games your son wants to play, but i play online games like age of mythology on an emachines refurb with a plain 17&quot; crt monitor.
the emachines amd 3000 cost $500 at  i bought another emachines for my relatives in the philippines on tigerdirect and it is doing just fine for graphic design.
i'm not sure why i'd pay $1000 for a desktop computer.
i'd be curious to hear from others what performance differences are really noticable on a higher end computer than p4/amd athalon 512 ddr ram, 128 mb video card and 160 mb hard drive.
