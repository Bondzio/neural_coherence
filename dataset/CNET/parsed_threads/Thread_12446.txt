<s> I have an MSI RX3870 T2D512E-OC Video card and over the weekend told me about the ATI Catalyst driver site at http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html . </s>
<s> I was wondering, what are the major differences in the drivers you can download at the manufacturer's website as opposed to the drivers from ATI Catalyst? </s>
<s> Any real benefits to the catalyst drivers? </s>
<s> You might visit the manufacturer's site. </s>
<s> See here: http://global.msi.com.tw/index.php?func=proddesc&prod_no=1365 They show an update service. </s>
<s> You might want to check that out. </s>
<s> Normally the ATI site will have the newest driver version, but this particular card may not utilize the same feature set. </s>
<s> They have a warning about using the incorrect driver. </s>
<s> See here: http://global.msi.com.tw/index.php?func=downloaddetail&type=driver&maincat_no=&prod_no=1365 </s>
<s> vendors just bundle the latest ati drivers at the time of packaging... they don't create their own drivers for video cards. </s>
<s> you can download just the drivers or the full catalyst control center (ccc). </s>
<s> ccc gives you greater control over advanced features (anti-aliasing performance, color management, video acceleration, overclocking, etc.) </s>
<s> but it can be a pain. </s>
<s> There is a difference between cards that are &quot;Built by ATI&quot; and cards that are &quot;Powered by ATI&quot;. </s>
<s> In many instances, cards that are &quot;powered by&quot; often contain &quot;enhancements&quot; that are specifically engineered for their brand of card. </s>
<s> Pipelines and/or shaders my be disabled or there may be overclocked functions that the manufacturer has determined are &quot;optimal&quot; for their version of the card. </s>
<s> In my experience, it has always been best to download the drivers from the card manufacturers website, although I have had mixed success with using the drivers offered from the ATI website. </s>
<s> nVidia on the other hand has no such issues. </s>
<s> After being a longtime ATI user I now have a new pc with an 8800GTS and will probably never go back to ATI powered cards. </s>
<s> Also, CCC (Catalyst Control Center) tends to be a resource hog and takes longer to load than nVidia's control panel. </s>
