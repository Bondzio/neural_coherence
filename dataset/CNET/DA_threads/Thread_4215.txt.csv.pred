1.1.1	So I own a Dell Inspiron M5010 , which came equipped with a 320GB , 5400 RPM Samsung Spinpoint M7 ( HM321HI ) HDD .	St
1.1.2	After about 3 months , the HDD became unusable due to a high count of bad sectors ( & gt ; 500 ) .	St
1.1.3	I 've replaced the broken HDD with a brand new , identical HDD which reached a bad sector count of over 250 in ~1 month .	St
1.1.4	I have then upgraded the HDD to a 500GB , 7200 RPM Samsung Spinpoint M7 ( HM500JI ) ; at the moment it has 166 bad sectors in about 2 months of usage .	St
1.1.5	I did not use the laptop under harsh conditions , it is not filled with dust , it did not suffer mechanical shocks .	St
1.1.6	What should I be on the lookout for ?	Ques
1.1.7	The current HDD temperature varries from 42-45 when idling to ~52-54 when playing a video game or using it extensively and the CPU temperature is always above 59 degrees Celsius , even when first booting up the laptop .	St
1.1.8	Also , the original power supply stopped working after 4 months since I purchased the laptop and I have replaced it with another 90W power supply .	St
1.1.9	Fun fact : a few ( 1-8 ) sectors were being marked as & quot ; bad & quot ; almost every time the song changed in an Youtube playlist ; not always , but most of the time .	St

1.3.1	Yes , it was n't even half year old when I had to replace the first HDD .	St
1.3.2	I was abroad and I did n't have access to any Dell authorized shops therefore I had to replace the HDD myself and I lost the warranty .	St
1.3.3	By the way , I have the M5010 with an AMD Phenom II Quad-Core P920 CPU .	St
