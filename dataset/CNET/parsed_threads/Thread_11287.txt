<s> Hi, I'm going to describe a problem I'm having, maybe someone can throw me an idea. </s>
<s> I have a Laptop. </s>
<s> It's a Dell Inspiron 5000 with W2K. </s>
<s> It has one mouse/keyboard port and one serial port. </s>
<s> I'm trying to hook up a mouse and a keyboard to the laptop. </s>
<s> Mouse has to be hooked up to the serial port, I have an adapter for it. </s>
<s> Problem: when everything is hooked up, the system does not see the mouse on the serial port, only touchpad works. </s>
<s> I already checked in the BIOS and the touchpad is set to [Auto, Disable], as it's supposed to. </s>
<s> Anyone would have any idea why the system would not switch to the serial mouse automatically? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> It seems to be some cruel joke that Radio Shack and many other places sell such adapters. </s>
<s> Bottomline? </s>
<s> I've never seen such work. </s>
<s> Do describe in gruesome detail the make/model number of said mouse so I can see if it is indeed serial capable. </s>
<s> The switch to use an external mouse is far from automatic and you may need some USB or PS2 mouse to make this work. </s>

<s> You can't use the PS/2 port for a mouse? </s>
<s> http://docs.us.dell.com/docs/systems/pblan/overview.htm#back Are you using the PS/2 port already? </s>
<s> Make sure the serial device is the only one and select an IRQ if possible or use &quot;auto&quot; mode for best results. </s>
<s> Usually, I use the PS/2 port for a mouse. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> They make splitters for the PS/2 port that will allow you to run both a keyboard and mouse from the single PS/2 port on a laptop. </s>
<s> That would be the best answer unless you actually have an old style serial mouse, which should work. </s>
<s> Well, there is one PS2 port and one serial port on the laptop. </s>
<s> Keyboard is plugged in to PS2. </s>
<s> That leaves serial port for the mouse. </s>
<s> I would think that when the system software finds a device (like a mouse) on the serial port, it should disable the touchpad automatically. </s>
<s> Hi Bob, Well the mouse is a generic no-brand two-button PS2 mouse. </s>
<s> Since I have used up the only PS2 port by plugging the keyboard to it, I am trying to make use of the serial port by using a PS2-to-serial adapter thingy. </s>
<s> I had a laptop some six years ago or so, with Win95, and I did exactly the same thing with the adapter, and it worked automatically. </s>
<s> All I can say is that some manufacturers do things that boggle my mind sometimes, like only providing ONE PS2 port. </s>
<s> There is plenty of space for two in the back panel. </s>
<s> As I noted, such adapters are readily available and only serve to confound users and tech support. </s>
<s> At this point I have not read anything that says this make/model mouse can do RS232. </s>
<s> Your other note about plugging in some serial mouse and it taking over is worth discussing a bit. </s>
<s> Behaviours about this changed over the years since 95 since sending bytes out the serial port to probe for a mouse can confuse non-mouse devices connected to such a port. </s>
<s> I think this idea vanished over time. </s>
<s> While you may want things to work a certain way automatically, it doesn't mean that such a way would be acceptable to the next person... </s>
<s> So with that, not everyone can be satisfied. </s>
<s> Did you try an USB mouse? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You assume incorrectly, it varies all over the place, some automatically disable the touchpad if a PS/2 mouse is used, some do not, same would be true with a Serial mouse. </s>
