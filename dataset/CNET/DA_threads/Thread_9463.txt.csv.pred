1.1.1	I have a sound blaster audigy 2zs.	St
1.1.2	All sound from the speakers works, but when i try to use a microphone it doesnt pick up any sound.	St
1.1.3	Ive checked all the advanced options and it isnt muted anywhere.	St
1.1.4	I tested the hardware but it never picks up any sound.	St
1.1.5	All the sound drivers under the device manager work, except for one driver, called &quot;multimedia audio controller, which is labeled as unknown.	St
1.1.6	What i dont get is that the mic worked with this exact setup a month ago, and it just stopped working one day.	St
1.1.7	I tried the mic in another computer and it worked, so i know it is not the mic itself.	St
1.1.8	I've tried updating the drivers from the creative website and everything.	St
1.1.9	Any help would be appreciated.	St
1.2.1	i might make a complete fool of myself here, lol but i have a couple of questions which u probly hav already stated: 1) are your speakers 5.1 surround?	St
1.2.2	2) if so have u disabled centre/sub in the sound mixer?	St
1.2.3	this is what happened to me, so i bought audio splitters but i have to turn centre/sub woofer to mic in denni0302	St
1.3.1	type of Mic you may have to set a jumper (or remove it) on your card.	St
1.3.2	My Shure SM58 Cardoid microphone required a jumper to be put in on my CLabs X-FIdelity card.	St
1.3.3	Try one of the cheap PC microphones and see if it works if you are trying a high quality vocal or directional audio Mic.	St
