the problem is that when i try start up with minimum configuration: cpu, motherboard and power and case of course.
the power fan and cpu fan just run 1 second then down 2 second and then run again and down again.
i think the normal situation should be the fans keep running and the motherboard alert no memory found.
there are 4 phase leds on board, two green down one yellow up and one yellow top.
i have replace the power and cpu, it doesn't work.
now i am gonna change the motherboard.
but before that, i post to see if there are some good solutions.
and i wonder if there is a chance that it the case problem.
cpu : i5-760 motherboard : gigabyte p55-usb3 power : corsair tx 650w power supply
