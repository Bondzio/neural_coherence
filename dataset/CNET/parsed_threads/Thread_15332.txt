<s> I have Western Digital external hard drive that is compatible with both PC and MAC. </s>
<s> It was working fine with both and now it does not work with PC. </s>
<s> When I connect it with MAC, I am able to view all the files and can copy, edit, etc. </s>
<s> However, when I connect it with a PC, I can see the drive but I cannot see the content in the Drive. </s>
<s> What could be the problem with it? </s>
<s> Could I have deleted some of the files? </s>
<s> Is there any way I can do to fix this problem? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> have you checked those posts ? </s>

<s> But since it's working you have the opportunity to save your files on your backup. </s>
<s> Then you can format it again on the PC and on your Mac copy the files back onto that drive. </s>
<s> There are thousands of prior discussions. </s>
