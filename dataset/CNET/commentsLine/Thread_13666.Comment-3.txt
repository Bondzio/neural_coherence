hi steven, i have a vsd which has an inbuilt http page which i can bring up on my laptop.
however from other stations on my network it is not accessible.
if i bridge(using xp) my wireless and local are connection (broadcom) then the device is pingable, but not accessible by my laptop or the broader network.
