when i first start in computers, in '83, i was always told that you put the fastest memory first (this is just a carryover from earlier times when you bought memory in nanosecond speeds - 100, 90, 80, etc.
nanoseconds).
next i was always taught that you should put the largest stick first, etc.
reasoning being that what you're doing might require over 250mb and if you put 2 128s first then the &quot;overflow&quot; carries over to the 2nd stick, instead of just the 256 if it was put in the 1st slot.
pretty simple explanation, of a complexe issue, but it'll get the job done.
