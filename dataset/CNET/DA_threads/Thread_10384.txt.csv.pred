1.1.1	I have decided to build my own gaming rig to shave some $ , and I am in need of some guidance .	St
1.1.2	So far I 've semi-decided on the following parts : Motherboard- -ASUS P5N-T Deluxe Motherboard Video Card -EVGA GeForce 9800 GT Video Card Processor- -Q9650 Intel Core 2 Quad Proc Hard-drive- -Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB RAM -Kingston 1GB ( x3 ) 667MHz DDR2 I know that I have n't listed an optical drive , case or monitor but that 's not really a concern .	St
1.1.3	Anyway , my question is , am I missing anything important ?	Ques
1.1.4	Is this a terrible mixture of components ?	Ques
1.1.5	Am I off my rocker ?	Ques
1.1.6	Any help , advice , suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated !	St
1.2.1	proposing ... most of us do n't have time to look them up .	St
1.2.2	So the easier you make ... the better chance you 'll have for getting help .	St
1.2.3	Feel free to start with the ASUS MB but it looks to me like its really a crapshoot or just crap .	St
1.2.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx ? Submit=ENE & DEPA=0 & Order=BESTMATCH & Description=ASUS+P5N-T+Deluxe & x=0 & y=0 You did n't indicate a PSU ... pretty important component and 1GB RAM ai n't enough for a high-end PC with a Q9650 .	St
1.2.5	I 'd also look at the WD640GB ... the WD6400AAKS or WD6401AALS .	St
1.2.6	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822136218 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822136218 VAPCMD	Ques
1.3.1	Good idea .	Polite
1.3.2	REPOST !	St
1.3.3	Motherboard- -ASUS P5N-T Deluxe Motherboard http : //www.asus.com/products.aspx ? modelmenu=1 & model=1981 & l1=3 & l2=11 & l3=610 & l4=0 Video Card -EVGA GeForce 9800 GT Video Card http : //www.ncix.com/products/index.php ? sku=33091 & vpn=512-P3-N971-TR & manufacture=eVGA Processor- -Q9650 Intel Core 2 Quad Proc http : //processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx ? sSpec=SLB8W Hard-drive- -Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB http : //www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=2795126 RAM- -Kingston 1GB ( x3 ) 667MHz DDR2 http : //www.jr.com/kingston/pe/KGS_KVR667D2S51/ I totally forgot to mention the PSU , but I 've one that works so no problems there .	St
1.3.4	As for the RAM I indicated 3X but that was probably too small , sorry .	Polite
1.3.5	The motherboard is where most of my uncertainty lies and I 'm definitely not set in my ways with regard to that particular one .	St
1.4.1	you 've paired a high-end mobo , high-end cpu , with a mid-range video card and low-end ram .	St
1.4.2	if you do n't plan on SLI , do n't get an SLI mobo .	St
1.4.3	an asus p5q pro is nearly half the price and will perform better .	St
1.4.4	if you do plan on SLI in the future , an asus p5n-d ( based on 750i chipset which does n't have the flaky issues of the 780i ) is a better choice .	St
1.4.5	the 3ghz q9650 wo n't improve your gaming experience much when compared to a 2.8 q9550 , but the q9550 should save you at least $ 200CAD .	St
1.4.6	use the money you saved to upgrade to a radeon hd 4870 or geforce gtx 260 and 2x2gb ddr2-1066 .	St
1.4.7	you 'll should still wind up saving at least $ 150CAD but have a faster gaming rig .	St
1.5.1	Re the 3 GBs RAM ... .OK if you get 2 @ 1GB and 2 @ 512MB but you do n't want 3 @ 1GBs ... you need RAM in pairs to maximize system performance .	St
1.5.2	If it were mine , I 'd just bump it to 4GB RAM total ... .then there 's no need to worry about upgrading later .	St
1.5.3	Re the MB ... .ditto my comments above .	St
1.5.4	While ASUS usually makes decent MBs ... buyer comments on the model you 've proposed are poor at best .	St
1.5.5	Re the HDD ... .WD640GB has better ratings and higher density per platter .	St
1.5.6	Last ... .re PSU ... .make sure it 's a decent PSU..there 's lots of pretty ones that are n't worth anything .	St
1.5.7	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I see what you 're saying about the proc , seems like a waste of money to get one that surpasses my reqs .	St
1.6.2	Any thoughts on how the Core 2 Duo E8400 Wolfdale 3.0GHz would hold up ?	Ques
1.6.3	It seems like enough and I 've heard a lot of good things about it .	St
1.6.4	http : //www.ncix.com/products/index.php ? sku=27784 & vpn=bx80570e8400 & manufacture=intel .	St
1.6.5	As for the mobo/graphics card combo , I can see myself going sli in the future , so the p5q pro you suggested seems like a good choice .	St
1.6.6	With that extra money in mind , I could go upgrade to the gtx 260 like you suggested and spring for a better hd and ram , ( any preferences on the latter ? )	Ques
1.6.7	GPU- http : //www.ncix.com/products/index.php ? sku=33327 & vpn=896-P3-1265-AR & manufacture=eVGA Mobo- http : //www.ncix.com/products/index.php ? sku=30418 & vpn=P5Q % 20Pro & manufacture=ASUS And of course the obligatory question , how 'crysis'able would this be ?	Ques
