1.1.1	Hello All I was wondering if anyone has used one of these drives .	St
1.1.2	I have only seen 1 review for it so far .	St
1.1.3	I need some USB drives to backup important Word , Excel files and to backup the programs I download from the Internet for my Palm .	St
1.1.4	I am backing up programs , but I will not be running the programs from the USB drive .	St
1.1.5	Storage is all that I 'm looking for .	St
1.1.6	I ask about this particular drive 'cause it 's on sale at a good price .	St
1.1.7	Thanks for any help/advise Regards Fritzmom	St
1.2.1	The Lexar 8GB with the LCD was under 20 last week .	St
1.2.2	See http : //www.target.com/Lexar-8GB-USB-Jump-Drive/dp/B0028OGI7A It 's fast and cool .	St

1.3.1	I do agree that it is really convenient talking about the actual size .	St
1.3.2	But I was disappointed to find out that you can not reuse it when you try to delete old files from the USB and replace it with another file , a message will pop up that says you can not store anymore because there is no enough space .	St
1.3.3	when I checked the general preference the capacity showed USED : 7.69 GB on disk ( 7,685,210,112 bytes ) , where in fact the only data stored left is ( Micro USB quick start up guide ) only .	St
1.3.4	Unlike my other USB which is of course another brand , I can always delete old movie files and replace it with new ones .	St
1.3.5	But I will appreciate if anyone can tell me if there is a way to reuse the drive .	St
1.3.6	By the way I am using MAC .	St
1.3.7	Thank You	St
1.4.1	While you can storage on flash media , do n't count on this as permanent storage , temporary at best .	St
1.4.2	Just too many issues arises and all the requests for help ca n't always be fixed .	St
1.4.3	You still need to store the most precious of your data to discs as a more safer place .	St
1.4.4	That does n't mean you ca n't use flash drives , just do n't do n't store them there indefinitely .	St
1.4.5	As for flash drives sales , they come and go .	St
1.4.6	There will always be another one either at brick fronts or online stores on sale .	St
1.4.7	In my experience , I 've used Toshiba and Kingston drives with good results .	St
1.4.8	HOWEVER , don ; t fall for super cheap drive like A-Data , etc or any that seem to pop-up on sale often .	St
1.4.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	You should try emptying out your trash , because if you have put files in the trash from your drive they still take up space .	Sug
1.5.2	if that does n't work you could maybe try and format your drive by going into applications & gt ; utilities & gt ; disk utility and formatting the device to Mac OS X Extended ( Journaled ) ( or MS-DOS if you are transferring files between your mac and a windows computer ) .	Sug
1.5.3	Cheers , Sam	St
