creating a drive image is one approach, you can also use traditional backup software such as backup mypc, which is published by sonic and may have a different name by now.
i would back up to a file on an external usb drive.
most good backup software has an option to create a disastery recovery disc.
in some cases, this method installs a bare-bones installation of windows, then accesses the backup file on the external drive to restore your system.
one good feature of this method is that you can have multiple backups if the partition on the external hard drive is large enough.
i usually keep two or three backups.
