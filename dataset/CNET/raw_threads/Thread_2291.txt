I don't want this to turn into an Intel vs. AMD thread. I only want to know your reccomendations on which setup to build around. My needs from this setup will be as follows: 1. Must be fairly quiet 2. Must support SATA drives 3. Must have PCI express slot for graphics card 4. Must have optical audio output 5. Possibly slots for both DDR & DDR2 ram (for future upgrades) My plans are to start off with a basic setup, possibly a mobo with integrated graphics & audio. Then upgrade gradually as my budget permits. I know that I'll want an expensive graphics card for better picture quality down the road, but integrated graphics will be fine for now. I don't play any games on my PC, so that is not a concern for me. Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks

Intel 915P supports PCI-X. Intel 915P supports DDR2. AMD does not currently support DDR2 until they revamp their processors...

As far as the cpu/mobo I guess i was just curious which processor would perform better for this type of setup....AMD or Intel?
3702	3	92912	1057482	1054978	ozos	3/19/05 11:37 PM	1.11127542E12	hmmm, AMD vs. Intel it is	Alright i would first off NOT COMPARE A 3.2GHZ CHIP AGAINST THE 3700+ the 3700+ would CRUSH THAT P4 with ease for the simple reason that: AMD's PR is about 90% accurate this time around, meaning you'd need a 3.7GHZ P4 to compete with that 3700 (in reality, it's more like a 3.5GHZ chip...) also AVOID THE PENTIUM IV 6xx series just because they have EM64T does not make them faster THEY ARE SLOWER the 5xx chips perform better under all benchmarks I would not say you need DDR2, but it is a newer/incoming feature getting PCIE is a good idea i would suggest something like the following (avoid the 3700 in general, it's Socket 754, which means single channel RAM and AGP 8x only...neither of which he wants) I would get the Athlon64 3800+ (only around $50 more, and the performance increase is great for $50) an nVidia nForce4 based motherboard (nForce4 is the only chipset AMD chips have to run PCIE, also, you need a Socket 939 board for the 3800+) as for video i'd get a PCIE X850XT or X850Pro but really since PCIE AIW cards aren't out (except the horrid X600 based one) i'd get the 3800+ with an AGP board and an AIW X800XL

Re: &quot;an nVidia nForce4 based motherboard (nForce4 is the only chipset AMD chips have to run PCIE,&quot; Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, and probably other motherboards will run PCIE. PCIE = PCI-Express with x1 bus(s) and posssibly a x16 bus for a video card.
3702	6	92912	1061000	1057482	John Robie	3/21/05 12:28 PM	1.11140808E12	What?...&quot;AVOID THE PENTIUM IV 6xx series&quot;	&quot;just because they have EM64T does not make them faster&quot; What a brash statement, along with some others, that belongs in the kiddies column of a gaming forum. The 6xx series is the wave of the future for Pent IV and slowly makers of Pentium computers are trying to sell off their 5xx to make room for the 6xx series, which mainly also differs along with EM64T, in having the new PCI-Express technology, including the new PCI-Express graphic cards. Here are some comments extracted from Tom's Hardware: &quot;AMD has been offering 64-bit capability since Fall 2003, even though only a few users have been able to really benefit from it. &quot;Without a doubt, the future belongs to the new PCI Express interface. The PCI bus and the AGP interface will be and is slowly being replaced by PCI Express.&quot; &quot;The new models 6xx differ from the 500 series in offering SpeedStep and the larger cache.&quot; &quot;If we directly compare the 500 and 600 series families, the conclusion we arrive at is very clear: the new version clearly is the better processor. Thanks to features such as EM64T 64-bit extensions, the Execute Disable Bit, Thermal Monitoring 2, the Enhanced Halt State and Enhanced SpeedStep, the new 2 MB Prescott finally meets the standard of being a processor that is both fast and reasonable in feature set and power consumption. In the coming months, Intel is going to make some real news in their Pentium 4 family. The best example will be the virtualization technology called Vanderpool or VT.&quot;
3702	7	92912	1062332	1059742	ozos	3/22/05 1:44 AM	1.11145584E12	you sound like a tard	this really proves your lack of general knowledge nVidia nForce4 is a chipset just like Intel's 925XE for Socket T in fact the nForce4 Ultra is the AMD S939 equivalent to the 925XE i was expecting fourm goers here to understand that i was meaning nVidia nForce4 meant the board chipset because: A) nVidia does not produce CPU's B) nVidia does not produce their own PCB/own their own OEM which means it can only be a chip it's not graphics as their graphics line is clearly called GeForce and GeForce is incapable of controlling a motherboard which would leave a motherboard's chipset Asus, Gigabyte and MSI are OEM manufactuers as to those benchmarks i guess i misread the Pentium IV 5 vs 6 not like it matters when you consider that the P4 EE 3.73 is averaging like the Athlon64 3500+ now which is the better CPU john? i'm going to say that the $275 3500+ which is, utterly, killing the Pentium IV EE 3.73 which isn't out yet, and will retial for...how much was it? $1000? $1100? $1200? making it what? 3? 4 times as much money? for 2 or 3% LESS power? i still fail to see your logic on anything john you are anti ATi, and anti AMD just because nVidia and Intel have produced good products in other generations (NV40 and Pentium III are my examples) doesn't mean their kings in current past generations i know that's a little weird let me re-phrase just because Intel used to be good, doesn't make them good now their getting whipped same goes for nVidia's NV3x line against's ATi's R3xx line can't you accept that Intel and nVidia aren't the best? you seem to find anything you can, just to tear AMD and ATi down... god you make me want to buy ATi products just to **** you off as to the OpenGL benchmarks which i'm sure your to gripe about my personal favorite, the Athlon64 3800+ is still taking names yes it loses in woflenstien by about 1 FPS now let's consider this again i know this is really super hard math to compute you take the Athlon64 3800+, which is $355 still with me? now you take the Pentium IV EE 3.73, which is unreleased and the guessed MSRP based on past EE series chips on release is $1100 (in the range of) still with me? now we subtract $355 (hell, make it $390, over price the chip to give the PIV some advantage) let's take $390 from $1100 that is $710 now what in hell would possess someone to pay $710 for a 1FPS increase in 1 game, and 2-4FPS drop in every other game, not to mention a roughly 8 FPS drop in Half-Life 2? hmmm by your logic it works though we spend more money than we should on a gfx card so then we waste yet more money on the CPU so while we are at it let's buy that Fatal1ty motherboard, so we can have a $230 motherboard, which can be had for $170 if you take all the tags off of it but oh no gotta use john's system gotta spend hundreds more (currently in your advice the total ammount of money you've suggested wasting is around $600...i'm not saying you've suggested the EE chip, i'm saying you've suggestd 6xx chips and over priced graphics cards...i thought the idea was to help members SAVE money, not waste it frivoulsly)

3702	13	92912	1104850	1074393	vance3	4/6/05 3:47 PM	1.11280242E12	Prices were just as reference	Prices were just as reference, when I looked at USD prices you can get in the states, just forget your 1.5:1 ratio, a 1:1 is more like it. I mostly wanted to point the different elements with an idea of cost.

Seems the forum goal is to have an intelligent exchange of information be it for one point of view or another in order to further thought and knowledge and development of those interested in accessing its resources
