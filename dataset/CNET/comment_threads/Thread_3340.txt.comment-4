You didn't state what system you have.
BUT, if this is an OEM type system from the likes of Gateway, Compaq, etc., then the MS# is on the cover somewhere on the system and/or found in the manual(s) or documentation given to you fro safekeeping.
If this system was build by local shop or DIY'er then they should provided the disks.
If brought ny an OEM builder, then contact them quickly for such support and if locally that seller.
