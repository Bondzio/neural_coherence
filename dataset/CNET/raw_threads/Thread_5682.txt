I read some reviews last week on the Sony VAIO VGN-BZ12VN and other people have reported an issue with the backlight. Is there anyone else who has had a similar issue or knows if this is a common problem or fault with this model of the Sony Vaio? The Vaio's are expensive so am disappointed that the backlight went wrong so quickly. I purchased a much cheaper Acer from Okobe at the same time as the Sony and the Acer still works perfectly.

I contacted the company I bought it from and they said that it had to go to the manufacturer. I contacted Sony and was asked to send it back to them. They repaired it and so far so good (its been 6 months since then). I was upset though as it cost so much more.
