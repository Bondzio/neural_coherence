I have 2 Western Digital external drives.
The problem I am having is sometimes my photos will be 'gray' half way down to the bottom.
And they become unusable.
The wierd thing is this.
I recently purchased a slide program that I can SEE the whole photo but if I try to use it I only see a blank black space.
But when I click on the photo again from within the program (not putting it in a slide show), what I see is 3 of the same photo one each on top of the other at different levels.
I hope this is making sense.
I am afraid to open my photos on the externals as it ruins them...has anyone else had this problem or know what it might be that is causing this?
