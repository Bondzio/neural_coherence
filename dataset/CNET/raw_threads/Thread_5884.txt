Anyways, I should have let you know which ones I was looking at in the first place. Here they are: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-131-474&catalog=280&manufactory=BROWSE&depa=1 http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-131-461&catalog=280&manufactory=BROWSE&depa=1 And also a Radeon IGP board...what exactly is this? I'm not familiar with this one. http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-131-150&catalog=280&manufactory=BROWSE&depa=1
