i originally did want to stick to a crt, but i was having alot of problems finding a decent sized one new; there were alot of 15/17&quot;, not so many bigger ones.
i was nervous about going used, as my current one died after only 3 years.
hopefully the lcd i ordered will be good, if not i'll exchange for store credit or something- sabine
