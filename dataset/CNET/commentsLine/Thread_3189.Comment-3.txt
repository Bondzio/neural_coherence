bob, i downloaded the driver and while the game can now be played, my regular display setting are distractingly massive.
how can i get my display (desktop picture, icon size and internet display, etc.
)to be the same size as before?
if i use system restore, will it take out the newly downloaded driver?
is there another way to change the display?
some of the page is so far off the screen that i can't even get to the arrow to move it across the page.
