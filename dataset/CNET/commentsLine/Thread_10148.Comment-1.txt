i have a odd question.
i took a speed test for my internet: download speed was 781.7 kbps upload speed was 215.5 kbps ok, i checked in network connection and its reported speed was: 100.mbps how is that?
the speed in the 2nd one, in windows in network connections, is much faster, faster than any connection that a company advertises, excpet t3.
are they recording different types of speed?
just wondering, nothing serious.
