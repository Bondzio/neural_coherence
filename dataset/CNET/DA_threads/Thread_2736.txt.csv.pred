1.1.1	does & quot ; core 2 duo & quot ; mean that there are two 64bit Intel processors or does it just mean that there is one 64bit processor ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	The Core 2 Duo is thoroughly documented out there but your question and answer is simply yes .	St
1.3.2	I thought however since you noted 64 bit I 'd add this caveat .	St
1.3.3	The 64 bit feature is not in the Core Duo units ( I wo n't double check which might have had it ) but was solidly in the Core 2 Duo lineup .	St
1.3.4	Just check the feature list for EM64T in the CPU you are looking at .	Sug
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	It depends on who you ask .	St
1.4.2	The operating system will probably see it as two different processors when scheduling its tasks .	St
1.4.3	However , physically it 's not two different processors since it goes in the same socket .	St
1.4.4	Also , I 'm quite sure the cores share the same cache , and this is different if you have multiple physical CPUs .	St
1.4.5	Hope this was helpful	St
1.5.1	Thats its the same technology as that new memory .	St
1.5.2	Alternating current has an up wave and a down wave .	St
1.5.3	And the old memory just & quot ; functioned & quot ; on the up wave at say 100mhz .	St
1.5.4	So they found out they could double it by making the down wave a function too .	St
1.5.5	And thats why my layman 's guess is .	St
1.5.6	That CPU technology just followed suit with the new memory technology .	St
1.5.7	And thats why the slower processor speeds ( yet supposedly faster output ) .	St
1.5.8	The processor 's working twice as hard appearing as 2 processors but is really one working on the up and down signals .	St
1.6.1	problems like piping .	St
1.6.2	A CPU gets bit strings a certain length ( 32 bit or 64 bit ) which are divided up by the operating system .	St
1.6.3	Without the piping in this way , the data would just be garble .	St
1.6.4	Because each string needs a header , a body , and a footer to work ( just like networking signals ) .	St
1.6.5	So if you have a 64 bit processor you 're going to need a 64 bit operating system to make the 64 bit long strings with a header , a body , and footer .	St
1.6.6	Or does the & quot ; Core 2 & quot ; make more vague the definition of what a 64 bit processor is ( 2 32 bit strings in parallel instead of one long 64 bit one ) ?	Ques
1.6.7	It seems to me that if you were going to make a multiple processored system , you 'd separate the processors instead of piling them up on one another .	St
1.6.8	For cooling purposes and simplicity .	St
1.6.9	I do n't know .	St
1.6.10	I 'm just babbling .	St
1.7.1	I was drunk and in a bar in college when I did this , but on a napkin I wrote out some crazy equation involving the speed of light .	St
1.7.2	186,000 miles per second .	St
1.7.3	And figured a processor the size of about 2 inches .	St
1.7.4	And what gigahertz it 'd take to breach that 186,000 mile per second barrier .	St
1.7.5	And , do n't ask me how because I 'm sober now , but somehow I figured out the max processor speed to be somewhere around 3.7 gigahertz .	St
1.7.6	And you have to wonder : When do strange things happen in these processors ?	Ques
1.7.7	Like power spikes and CPU farts .	St
1.7.8	And if thats not why the newer processors are slower .	St
1.8.1	CPU frequency is a poor value to use for computations , as the calculation speed is currently dominated by other factors ... cache and bus speeds , etc ...	St
1.8.2	The proper value to monitor is the number of operations per second known as & quot ; flops. & quot ; Supercomputers work on the scale of teraflops now -- petaflops will be running all around the world in ~5 years .	St
1.8.3	Still -- to correct your discussion , you 're off by a few orders of magnitude .	St
1.8.4	The average distance the electrical signal needs to travel between junctions in the CPU is less than 500 microns ( 0.05 cm ) -- call this D. Speed of light is C~ 3E10 cm/s .	St
1.8.5	Frequency can be approximated by C/D , which comes to half a teraHertz -- that is , ~500 GHz .	St
1.8.6	This is only limited by the circuitry sizes ... in fact , there are prototype TeraHertz CPUs developed by places like Los Alamos National Labs .	St
1.8.7	As CPU developers begin to break the micron barrier with nanometer-scales for circuitry , we 'll be able to up this petaHertz circuitry ( i.e. , 1,000,000 GHz ) !	St
1.8.8	So , you 're back of the envelope was probably a little clouded by that beer yeast -- hopefully it was good beer .	St
1.9.1	electrical conduction speeds are only ~2/3 the speed of light , so the limit is a little lower than my over-simplified estimate .	St
1.10.1	There are two processors on the same processor slot .	St
1.10.2	There are now processors with 4 processors in the same socket , but they are really 2 of the dual core processors on the same die .	St
1.10.3	Not for sure if they share the cache or not , have n't looked that close at them because of the price	St
1.11.1	It broke my : & quot ; I do n't know what I 'm talking about & quot ; barrier .	St
1.11.2	Thanks for the info .	St
