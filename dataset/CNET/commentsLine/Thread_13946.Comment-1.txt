i am wanting to upgrade from my hardy yet outdated nvidia geforce ti 4200 64mb.
i was told by a dell support person that 64mb was the highest i could go due to how the computer is made.
so that limits my options significantly.
i was wondering if anyone has any advice on this, like what is the best 64mb video card i can get.
i play games a lot, thus i am upgrading.
any help would be great.
