Bob, Looks like a few of them have shown up since I last checked into it.
That model is not available just now, but I think I have a few other ones on Amazon.
Not using an iPad, need to use a windows pad for other requirements, so wan it to work with that, and actually only from the couch to the TV..... Greg
