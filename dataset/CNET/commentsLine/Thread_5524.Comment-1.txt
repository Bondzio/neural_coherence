i have a creative zen vision m. every time i plug it into a usb port and the zen is identified as docked the pc shuts off completely.
some pc specs are: asus k8v-mx motherboard, 1gb ram, amd athlon xp 2500 cpu, 80 gb hd.
i've tried using the zen on a new notebook i bought and it works fine on it.
unfortunately all my music files are on my pc.
any help or suggestions would be great.
thanks.
