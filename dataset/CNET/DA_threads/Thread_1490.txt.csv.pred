1.1.1	Hi: I've got a friend who wants to set up a wireless network at home, the thing is he is already using a wired modem/router with 4 ports.	St
1.1.2	so im wondering to set up a wireless network, is the best option just to buy a wireless modem/router and replace the wired one?	St
1.1.3	or is it possible to get a wireless router only and use that with the wired modem/router?	St
1.1.4	if it's possible, how would I go about doing that?	St
1.1.5	Cheers	Polite
1.2.1	You could add a Wireless Access Point -- but a used wireless router is a lot cheaper and ex-ISP models turn up all the time due to customer churn.	St
1.2.2	Obviously to replace the existing router you'll need to apply the right settings to match your ISP's requirements -- see their home site for any help files on how to set up common brands of router.	St
1.2.3	If you get a used ex-ISP wireless router and find it is locked to an ISP just add it as a WAP to the existing router --- see following link: http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101496.asp	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the advice	Ques
