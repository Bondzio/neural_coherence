i took my netgear wgr614v10 back to walmart and exchanged it for a wnr2000v2.
i find out after i got home that not only is it not windows 7 certified but its not certified for xbox either.
it seems to be working better than the old router on the laptop but when i test my 360 connection i get a moderate nat warning.
i have followed all the steps listed on the xbox support.
i have forwarded port, set xbox as the dmz.
i don't know what else to do.
the connection seems to be some better but i can't get the nat changed to open.
any suggestions on what to do or should i just give it up and order a wireless modem from my isp and pay $4.00 every month?
thanks
