Hello, My computer keeps freezing up and if the cursor stops moving, my computer will make a steady high pitched noise.
Typing is even delayed at some point.
This just started yesterday morning.
I've done a virus check and none have shown up.
Does anyone know what could be happening?
Thank you for your time.
