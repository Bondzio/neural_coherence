well when we thought about using the warrenty.
it was kinda laate .
and we had to travel from nassau [bahamas] to florida.
so it was kinda costly.
we already made two trips to get it repaired.
so we kinda made up our mind that we wont get another hp.
we will just stick to hp printers and scanners....[or at least i wanted too].
