have a program installed that *control* fan speeds?
or does it just *monitor* speeds?
you sure the program and its parameters are not corrupted?
try deactivating or uninstalling it to see what happens.
you can also try booting into safe mode or even let it sit in bios without os booting to see if fans and temps are ok. your components all seem solid and altho they may have degraded i would go the cheap route and figure if each one is still good before spending to replace.
