unless you're a fanatic gamer and need huge amounts of power my suggestion would be to buy technology that has been generally available for &gt; 6-9 months; and buy a level of operating system that has had some time to get the major bugs worked out.
key advantage is that the price of the hardware has started dropping because it's superceded by the newer &quot;gee whiz&quot; gear.
today that would give you at least a 3-4ghz processor and a 160gb drive plus a dvd burner, and your supplier would probably throw in a lowend laser printer or photo-printer as well.
and you'd be using win xp.
some readers might accuse me of being a luddite -- but that approach has kept my computing costs low with reasonably good performance.
