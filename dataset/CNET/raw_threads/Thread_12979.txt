My current video card is a GeForce4 ti4800 AGP. The card has been wonderful and I play almost all games with video settings maxed out. I've been wanting to get a new video card simply because I can't play games like Battlefield2 because the GeForce4 isn't DirectX 9 compliant (or something along those lines). Can anyone recommend a good card that would work for me? I'm looking to spen around $150-$250. I've been looking at a GeForce 6800, but to be honest, I can't sort out the different models too well. I have a 4x AGP controller. On a simple level, will I be seeing any improvement going to an 8x card?
