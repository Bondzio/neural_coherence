<s> I have a keyboard called &quot;Compaq Internet Keyboard With 22 Hot Keys&quot; but I used it so much that the keys started falling out, so I keep it in the original package that it came in. </s>
<s> I got another HP internet keyboard and mouse on eBay, but it is larger and it doesn't have as many functions as the other keyboard does, so I got an adapter for the keyboards and I have them both connected. </s>
<s> Now I have two keyboards and two mice and they both work at the same time because you can connect just about anything with a USB connection.... and all these things install by themselves... </s>
<s> I also have two USB extensions. </s>
<s> They light up. </s>
<s> And they can plug in, but they can also work just by connecting to the computer. </s>
<s> One of the speaker systems that I have on it has the green audio plug, and it has a usb connection that it gets its power from. </s>
<s> And there are USB Hard Drives, Zip Drives, Jaz Drives, Tape Drives, Jump Drives, and Edge Drives. </s>
<s> ( They have USB memory card readers, But the memory card reader slots are built into my computer, so I don't need a USB one. ) </s>
<s> If somebody has at least one of all of these things, and there seems to be no limit to how many USB devices can be connected to just one computer, how can the computer provide power to all of the devices?? </s>
<s> Will it crash the computer or something? </s>
