i foolishly installed clonecd, and then decided to uninstall it, now my dvd drive won't recognise any discs at all (message: 'insert disc in drive' even when i've put a disc in and double-clicked the drive icon).
i'm sure i read here somewhere (can't find the link)that clonecd deletes crucial files and causes this problem...does anyone know how to remedy it?
my dvd drive is a samsung sd-616-t, and yes, i've tried samsungs site but couldn't find a cure.
all help greatfully appreciated!
