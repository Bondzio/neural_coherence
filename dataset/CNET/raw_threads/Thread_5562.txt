My wife and I have a good collection of music together, but each of us has our own iPods and playlists. Therefore, with my modest knowledge I thought it would be a good idea to have an external shared drive where we could store all our files and access them from either or both laptops. The idea is to use that external hard drive wirelessly as you would use an internal one, in each of the laptops. My question is, is this possible? If so, which one would you recommend? We are looking into buying something with 500GB. I was especially interested in a Western Digital, but I have read so many bad reviews, and as you could probably tell by now I am not enlightened with computer knowledge I appreciate all the help!

I plug my external USB-2 &quot;stuff&quot; drive into it and it becomes a network drive. It is seen by all my PCs (4, one wireless laptop) and is exactly what you're looking for. Drives? I'm partial to Seagate. I have an 80 Gig unit in the USB case, it's perpendicular recording is fast. I just purchased this 160 Gig http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148212 as I'm running out of space on the 80. Seagate has many choices here http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=50001305+40000014&Manufactory=1305&SubCategory=14&SpeTabStoreType=0 up to a TeraByte.

I think I made up my mind and I will buy a NAS from LaCie and plug it directly to my modem. That way it will solve my problems, hopefully. I might ask for help when installation happens... Thanks again!
