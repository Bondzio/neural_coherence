an integrated graphics card is the card that comes pre-installed with the system's motherboard.
while 256 mb of graphics memory will be enough for games that came out 5 years ago, it is recommended to have at least 512+ mb of graphics memory to play the latest games.
if you wish to play the latest games like splinter cell conviction, battlefield bad company 2 and mass effect 2, it is recommended to have a nvidia graphics card that supports pixel shader 3.0 and has a graphics memory of 512 mb (minimum).
i have a nvidia ge force 8400 gs with 512 mb memory and still the latest games run smoothly only at the minimal graphics detail.
they start to slow down if i change to medium detail.
the most important thing you should consider before buying a graphic card is the manufacturer of the graphics card.
most integrated cards are made by intel.
intel cards are not supported by most games and hence i am not sure if you can play the latest ones.
you can ask your dealer if he can provide you a ati or nvidia graphics card instead of the integrated one.
but, that can be done only if the pc's motherboard has the provision to install additional graphic cards.
just like the normal ram, graphics memory too can be increased only if the mother board has the provision to support it.
(you cannot buy graphics memory like an ordinary ram, you need to get a new card with more memory.
so you may have to remove one to use the other and its expensive too).
i suggest you ask your dealer regarding this.
for a good gaming experience, i recommend a pc with a nvidia or ati graphics card with atleast 512 mb of ram.
visit  and  for info regarding the price and features of the graphic cards.
also, don't forget to ask your dealer regarding the provision in the motherboard.
i hope you find this useful.
