ok, i've seen and read other posts that are almost identical to my issue but none that are exactly like mine.
i've been through microsoft and dell with no solution, i'm hopeful that i can find a solution or at least a good answer here.
i have a dell xps 600 and i'm running windows xp pro 32bit.
my computer came from the factory with 2gb of dual cahnnel ram ddr2-sdram pc2-5300 (333 mhz) i recently purchased two more gb of ram from dell making sure to ues the exact same type.
my computer has 4 dimm slots and the motherboard can use up to 8gb of ram with a 64bit os.
my problem is that the new ram shows up in the bios but not in system properties.
it also shows in system information but system information is also telling me that i only have 2 gb available.
i have run pc wizard to see what it has to tell me.
pc wizard tells me that i have 1gb of ram in each dimm slot, but under the configuration tab when you click on the windows logo it tells me that i have only 2gb of ram, i'm a bit confused, i have the same software telling me two different things.
i assume at this point that my os is seeing 4gb of ram but is only using 2. if there is anyone that can help me i can't even tell you how much i would appreciate it.
