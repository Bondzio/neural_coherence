Windows 8 is NOT for phones...
If you want to program in similar way, use Windows Phone 7.5.
Win8 is only for tablets or computers (it works without touchscreen too!).
No phone would support it... it needs 1 GB of RAM and A LOT of memory (it's not much for PCs, but it's huge amounts for phones).
And also, metro style applications for Windows 8 require big resolution to run, i think it's 1024x768 or something like that... (also not big for PCs but huge for phones) For growing... Now Android is growing faster than any onther OS, but i think when Windows 8 will be released, the Metro Style will become more popular and people will start buying Windows Phone, especially older people because it'll be easier to learn how to use it if you have a PC with win8.
And if you develop games, iOS is the best platform for that That's my advice it's your choice
