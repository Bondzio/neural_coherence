<s> I have a 2 year old HP Pavilion ze2000 and a 60GB Hard Drive, and 2 Gigs of virtual Memory, XP I am contemplating whether or not i want to restore my complete system and clear my hard drive. </s>
<s> Here is the story. </s>
<s> I bought The Sims 2 Double Deluxe at walmart. </s>
<s> When i Installed it and tried to play the game it said: Please insert the original disc instead of a backup (1000). </s>
<s> Which is complete junk. </s>
<s> After calling technical support i was able to play the game once because of deleting all my processes in windows task manager. </s>
<s> Woke up yesterday and COULD NOT play it. </s>
<s> Thank you ea, you were wonderful help. </s>
<s> Same message i had gotten before. </s>
<s> I didnt want to take the game back because i thought there was some other way to run the game. </s>
<s> after reading 100 forums I learned that there was emulator software that i could download, so i downloaded everything i could in hopes i could play my darn game! </s>
<s> but no luck now i have a full hard drive and no way to play the sims 2 double deluxe, thanks again EA. </s>
<s> Anyway, i made a list of all programs i need to install after erasing my entire hard drive, but found that I have MICROSOFT OFFICE 2007. and said OMG i dont want to clear my hard drive. </s>
<s> I also have other drivers/like my internet provider that i want to keep. </s>
<s> And most of these things wont fit on a CD-R or Jump Drive. </s>
<s> After my head exploded i looked at my C: Drive, and found something really weird: (60GB HDD) 60 Gig hard drive- C:/Documents and settings=17GB- and C:/Program Files=9.50GB and there are about 3 extra files in that folder that equal a small amount of MB's, so i would say thats another 3 or 4 gigs at the most. </s>
<s> Im not a Mathematician or anything, but that DOES NOT equal 60 Gigabits. </s>
<s> Where did my space go. </s>
<s> Ive ran Disk Defragmenters, and disc cleanups. </s>
<s> I dont know what to do. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> How about getting a larger hard disk and installing it ? </s>
<s> Here's an IDE (ATA) HDD 120GB for $65 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136130 They've got SATA drives too. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Yes my system can write DVDs </s>
<s> data used for system restores. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I had my computer in the shop about 2 months ago and i noticed when i got it back it had the same amount of hard drive space but all my files were erased. </s>
<s> How do i get to these hidden partitions? </s>
<s> How do i get to my old files, and how do i clean these from my hard drive so i have more space? </s>
<s> so your disk is only half full. </s>
<s> Its capacity is 60ish* GB, not that it currently contains 60 GB. </s>
<s> You don't need to put all the files on the same DVD, and obviously you don't need to save stuff that's not useful to you. </s>
<s> What made you think the drive was full? </s>
<s> Your 60 gig drive probably has 52 -54 gigs available for data. </s>
<s> Your 2 gigs of physical memory (I think you said virtual but it's really RAM or physical) will cause Windows to set aside about 1 1/2 times that amount as a swap file. </s>
<s> To check it's size you will probably have to enable viewing for hidden files. </s>
<s> As well, if you have &quot;hibernate&quot; enabled, another large chunk of hard drive space is reserved for that and this becomes unavailable for data storage. </s>
<s> The hidden partition should be viewable but you need to find disk manager to do that. </s>
<s> It may be called something like a &quot;service&quot; partition. </s>
<s> So, all in all, it wouldn't be unusual for you to have under 50 gigs of disk space available to you. </s>
<s> You can do some cleanup and Windows has a cleanup utility under Accessories/System Tools. </s>
<s> This won't get all of the unnecessary files. </s>
<s> You can run that utility with the option to delete all but the latest restore point. </s>
<s> This will greatly improve available HD space. </s>
<s> But, you're biggest chunk of wasted space after 2 years is likely to be from Windows updates. </s>
<s> These are found in the Windows folder and are compressed so colored in blue. </s>
<s> They will have some sort of KB and a list of numbers. </s>
<s> You can manually delete all but the first file which will be something like $hf_mig$. </s>
<s> You'll also find files in the Windows &quot;temp&quot; folder. </s>
<s> You can delete all of these. </s>
<s> Some may not allow you as they may be in use. </s>
<s> Another place to look is for temporary files under your username. </s>
<s> It will be in the Documents and Settings folder under your username/Local Settings. </s>
<s> These can go. </s>
<s> None of this is going to help you retrieve files that have been deleted. </s>
<s> The hidden partition does not contain these. </s>
<s> I doubt doing this will help with your gaming problem. </s>
<s> That's another issue to be resolved. </s>
<s> Perhaps this a piracy protection feature of it. </s>
<s> Can't offer much there. </s>
<s> Good luck . </s>
<s> NIL </s>
