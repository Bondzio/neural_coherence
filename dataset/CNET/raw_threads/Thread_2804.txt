I recently took the old notebook to a local computer shop, asked them to transfer the data from the old notebook to DVD. They wanted $130 for the job. I mentioned it at work and a guy told me I can remove the CD/DVD drive on my new notebook, plug in the old hard drive and download from the drive. This seems risky to me, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.

They specifically talked about how the CD/DVD drive is an alternative drive (D:) on most computers, so you could technically put anything in there and it should work. I'll look into the USB drive though, thanks for the idea.
