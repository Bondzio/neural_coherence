If you have the installation/restore disk to reinstall Nero, I would try uninstalling Nero completely, restart computer, and then reinstall Nero.
Add the Nero update after reinstall, too.
See if this works.
If yo have a registered copy of Nero, copy its Serial Number before you remove Nero from the computer.
This will allow you to re-enter the Serial Number after reinstallation.
