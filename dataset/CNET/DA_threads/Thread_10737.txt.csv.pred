1.1.1	I have a Dell Inspiron 620 .	St
1.1.2	Last night a power surged MESSED up my computer .	St
1.1.3	I did n't even realize this until I had sat down to a screen that was displaying & quot ; windows is loading files & quot ; and a full bar underneath just hanging there .	St
1.1.4	I knew that this meant it had automatically done a startup repair but I was n't sure why it was hanging .	St
1.1.5	So I rebooted and changed the BIOS to run from the CD rom first .	St
1.1.6	I put in a windows 7 cd to try and run startup repair from there and rebooted .	St
1.1.7	Again it just loaded the & quot ; windows is loading files & quot ; bar and hanged .	St
1.1.8	At this point I decided to run an Unbuntu CD to try and salvage what was on my hardrives before I did a clean wipe and reinstall of windows 7 .	St
1.1.9	It displayed the Unbuntu splash page and then went blank .	St
1.1.10	After this I noticed that there were sounds coming from inside my computer ...	St
1.1.11	Here 's that uploaded in mp3 form to help give you an idea .	St
1.1.12	( after :23 skip to :58 ) What is this by user668315214 on SoundCloud - Create , record and share your sounds for free It makes these same sounds each time I tried to boot , so I figured it was my hard drive causing this .	St
1.1.13	To test that theory , I removed my hardrives and used another one from a different computer that was made around the same time as my other HDDs .	St
1.1.14	Still , no proper boot , and it made the exact same sounds .	St
1.1.15	All I can think of it being is a mother board issue .	St
1.1.16	What do you all think ?	Ques
1.2.1	Sorry , the correct link for the sound file is here .	St
1.2.2	http : //soundcloud.com/user668315214/what-is-this	St
1.3.1	You can test the setup by disconnecting the HD entirely , just leave in place .	St
1.3.2	Access the bios and be sure that the CD drive is the 1st boot device .	St
1.3.3	I hope your Ubuntu is a & quot ; live CD version & quot ; and then reboot to check status .	St
1.3.4	If the Ubuntu boots quickly or it does different than before , report back .	St
1.3.5	If the system boots , then your HD is hosed .	St
1.3.6	If it hangs again at same point , then your mtrbd .	St
1.3.7	could be at fault .	St
1.3.8	Of course , any ram or video still is installed , if you reduce or swap them out if status changes to narrow fault .	St
1.3.9	Often enough , since you believe that a power surge caused the issue , you maybe chasing problem after problem even if you think you 've resolved it .	St
1.3.10	Too often another problem crops-up soon or it last at least 30 days or more , then I 'll consider it resolved .	St
1.3.11	Yeah , it maybe time to replace PC if issues happen too soon or problems continue AND ! ! !	St
1.3.12	you ca n't trust the parts present in old PC until tested .	St
1.3.13	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.4.1	The sounds like the HD , but it does n't seem to continue on .	St
1.4.2	If that 's all , then the HD is probably awaits some system error display to allow to continue .	St
1.4.3	I suggest you wait and give it more time and see if any error message appears .	Sug
1.4.4	Wait about 10-15mins .	St
1.4.5	The noise itself does n't suggest a bad HD though , unless this is constantly doing this .	St
