I want to build a new PC and am looking for suggestions for specs and specific brands of motherboards etc.
Also where have you had the best luck purchasing components.
I am not a gamer nor do I do a lot of high end processing and don't need a top of line speed or high end video.
Prob a dual core.
Want to do 2 hard drives.
1 for the OS (may want to do a dual boot) and 1 for evything else.
Suggestions appreciated.
Thanks
