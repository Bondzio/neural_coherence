<s> An IDE hard drive marked as ATA and one marked as Ultra ATA? </s>
<s> My older 60 Gig HD will work in my external USB-2 case but my new 160 &quot;Ultra&quot; will not. </s>
<s> It works perfectly in my desktop as a slave, but it will not work in my external case. </s>
<s> Windows (XP Pro) does not notice the USB device. </s>
<s> But if I put the older 60 Gig drive into the case, XP sees it perfectly. </s>
<s> Just wondering. </s>
<s> And yes, the jumpers are correct, master while in the case. </s>
<s> Some really old cases had issues with drives over 127GB... Bob </s>

<s> Here's what the &quot;Wisegeek&quot; had to say about it: http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-ultra-ata.htm &quot;ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) refers to a common standard used to connect hard drives and other storage devices to a motherboard. </s>
<s> It is also referred to as IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics), though the terms are not technically interchangeable. </s>
<s> Ultra ATA is simply next generation ATA with improved transfer speed and architecture. </s>
<s> There are several buzzwords surrounding Ultra ATA that can make it a little confusing for consumers, but each buzzword refers to an aspect of the standard that forms the overall architecture of Ultra ATA. </s>
<s> UDMA (Ultra Direct Memory Access): To begin, Ultra ATA is based on a joint venture design between Intel, Quantum and Seagate. </s>
<s> It is written around a specification that allows a hard disk or drive to transfer data directly to the computer's system memory without having to use the CPU to direct this action. </s>
<s> This saves processor resources and increases performance. </s>
<s> Therefore, Ultra ATA is also called Ultra DMA, or UDMA for short As if all this isn't enough to make the average consumer hire the neighborhood geek to buy a hard drive for them, there are also escalating grades of Ultra ATA defined by transfer speed ceilings. </s>
<s> For example, there is Ultra ATA/33, Ultra ATA/66 Ultra ATA/100 and Ultra ATA/133. </s>
<s> As you may have guessed, ATA/133 is the fastest, with a transfer rate of 133 megabytes per second, roughly comparable to the earliest version of SATA. </s>
<s> While SATA drives have long out-paced Ultra ATA drives for performance, the latter is still an excellent economical choice. </s>
<s> Aside from their use as system drives, Ultra ATA drives are also popular backup and archive drives. </s>
<s> If purchasing an Ultra ATA hard drive or ATAPI device, you will need a UDMA controller to take over the responsibility of directing data flow between system memory and the component device. </s>
<s> This controller is built into the motherboard chipset in most cases. </s>
<s> For motherboards that are not Ultra ATA compliant, a UDMA controller card can be purchased and added to an open PCI slot on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Ultra ATA drives and controllers are available everywhere computer products are sold.&quot; </s>
<s> I actually have two of them and they're probably 3-4 years old. </s>
<s> Which brand model 160GB is it that doesn't work ? </s>
