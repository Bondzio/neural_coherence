i want a copier/printer preferably.
i will be using it mainly for printing text and copying text for homeschooling purposes (one child).
i'd like it to be able to: handle occasional cardstock sheets from printing or copying one ink cartridge fairly cheap (obviously color is optional) automatic feed i need the printer to be fairly inexpensive as well.
max $170!
and i don't want to have to replace the ink cartridge all the time.
it won't get a ton of use but a fair amount.
i have windows xp if that helps any.
i have reviewed a few different printers and can not decide between the hp laserjet p1005 (which is not a copier) or one of the all-in-one canon pixma mp520 or mp610.
i don't really have use for photo printing since i send all that off to be done.
so the all-in-ones seem like a waste of money to me.
so any other suggestions for me?
anyone?
thank you very much in advance!
