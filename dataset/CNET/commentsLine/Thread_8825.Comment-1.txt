hi, my name is mike myatt and i have a problem with my computer it has an amd athlon 64 x2 4200+, at 2.2ghz, socket am2 wich is just turning off with no warning.
i think this is because the cpu is overheating.
can i correct this by changing the heatsink ?
now it looks the heatsink is properly attached.
thanks in advance!
mike myatt
