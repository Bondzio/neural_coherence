I did not have any of the Dell installation CD's. I installed the drivers I downloaded from Dell before reading I was supposed to install them in a specific order, (DSS Deskto System Software, followed by Chipset drivers, then other drivers). I currently do not have any audio in the system, which I believe is a result of not having installed the DSS and chip-set prior to audio drivers. I need to know how I undo what I have done. Do I need to delete the audio drivers and then install the DSS and Chip set before reinstalling the audio drivers, or what? Thank you.
