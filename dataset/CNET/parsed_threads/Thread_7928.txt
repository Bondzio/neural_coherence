<s> I have tried to get into my computer, however when I switch it on, the Microsoft windows xp professional comes up and I press enter, but, an error screen flashes on and then it goes back to the Microsoft windows xp professional menu again. </s>
<s> So, I created another partition on my computer with the basics and it works fine. </s>
<s> Trying to access my disk drive and it comes up &quot;Access is denied&quot;Tried to restoring, but, that failed. </s>
<s> Any suggestions, thanks? </s>
<s> XP Take Ownership. </s>
<s> Thanks, but, that doesn't work either. </s>
<s> When I try to go in safe mode, it kicks me back to the OS menu again. </s>
<s> Safe mode boot failures are now a solid sign of malware damage. </s>
<s> Over in the Storage Forum at the top post are ways to get your files out. </s>
<s> And a last chance. </s>
<s> DO NOT PLUG IN ANY USB OR OTHER THING. </s>
<s> Try safe mode again. </s>
<s> And I know what your question. </s>
<s> Can you fix Safe Mode boot failures? </s>
<s> I can but on pre-installed Windows I can't since they remove all the tools to fix it. </s>
<s> We get the files out safe then reinstall the OS. </s>
