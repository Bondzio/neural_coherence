Does the school use a MS Windows network?
If so, adding a file server to the environment should be as easy as adding the server, creating the file structure, organizing the &quot;access permissions by user account&quot; setup.
Windows 2003 is pretty easy to setup, but i do recommend that you consult with an MCSE, to achieve the proper design.
In regards to the access/permissions, again, Windows 2003 will provide the tools to setup such an environment (its all about the NTFS configuration).
In regards to having all the files &quot;upload or something like that...&quot; use file shares and roaming profiles.
