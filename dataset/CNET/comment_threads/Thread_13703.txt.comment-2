On 3/28/04 you posted a question regarding Dell 940 printer and the fact that you had to manually delete two processes.
Yesterday, I got a message after putting new color cartridge in same printer, that referenced dlbapswx.exe.
Did you ever find out what your problem was?
In addition to error message,the cartridge is missing blue color.
.
Wondering if error message is a separate issue.
I am relatively new at all this, but have a need to know... even if I don't understand the answers!!
Any help would be appreciated
