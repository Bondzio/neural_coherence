<s> I started with a 20GB hard drive, and just added a 120GB hard drive. </s>
<s> Everything is still on the 20GB. </s>
<s> I use XP. </s>
<s> Where should I put files? </s>
<s> Should I keep XP on the 20GB and move all my data and programs to the 120GB? </s>
<s> Or vice versa? </s>
<s> Any ideas on this? </s>
<s> One thing I will be doing is putting old Hi8 tapes through my camcorder (via firewire) so I can convert them to DVD. </s>
<s> I would assume I am best off transferring these to the 120GB as it is faster and larger. </s>
<s> But should I move anything off my old slower 20GB HD; would my system performance increase by moving EVERYTHING over to the new drive? </s>
<s> Oh, and how would I do any of this? </s>
<s> THANK YOU!! </s>

<s> &quot;Where should I put files?&quot; Where you can find them. </s>

<s> Or vice versa? </s>
<s> Any ideas on this?&quot; I just did something similar. </s>
<s> I used Ghost2002 to copy a system from one drive to another, removed the older slower drive as a backup and made the newer faster drive as the master and wher the OS is and files are. </s>
<s> Much nicer and no big questions. </s>

<s> I would assume I am best off transferring these to the 120GB as it is faster and larger.&quot; You'll answer this soon enough since for each 2 hour home movie (which is best limited to 1 hour, your choice), I see my temp workspace to be about 20 to 30 GB. </s>
<s> This question will sort itself out as you will soon realise. </s>

<s> But what I did. </s>
<s> &quot;Oh, and how would I do any of this? </s>
<s> &quot; I used Ghost 2002. </s>
<s> But the drive may have come with software and instructions to do this move. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick and helpful answers, Bob! </s>
<s> I will move everything over to the new drive, and then make it the Master. </s>
<s> Is there a need to change anything in BIOS, or do I just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up? </s>
<s> As far as transferring data, the new drive is a Western Digital and came with Data Lifeguard Tools, which should do the trick, I believe. </s>
<s> I will then use the old drive as my back-up drive. </s>
<s> Is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a Slave, and back-up to that on occasion? </s>
<s> Or is there a chance that if the system crashes, both drives could be obliterated? </s>
<s> And thanks for the tip about preferably limiting movie files to 1 hour. </s>
<s> Sorry to ask more questions on top of my questions! </s>
<s> Much appreciated! </s>

<s> Is there a need to change anything in BIOS, or do I just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up?&quot; Too dependent on the machine in question. </s>
<s> The last time I did this, the BIOS settings were on AUTO and not even a jumper was moved because 80 conductor IDE cables use the drives in CABLE SELECT mode. </s>
<s> &quot;As far as transferring data, the new drive is a Western Digital and came with Data Lifeguard Tools, which should do the trick, I believe.&quot; I've used that. </s>
<s> Seems to work for most. </s>

<s> Is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a Slave, and back-up to that on occasion? </s>
<s> Or is there a chance that if the system crashes, both drives could be obliterated?&quot; I removed the drive for various reasons. </s>
<s> - The drive was smaller and slower and created too many questions about where to store files. </s>
<s> - I didn't want to upgrade the power supply or worry about cooling issues. </s>
<s> - Yes. </s>
<s> Data on writeable devices is at risk during any disaster. </s>
