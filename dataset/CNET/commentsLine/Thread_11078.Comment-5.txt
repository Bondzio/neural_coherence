more demanding video output are stating at least on thier packaging, &quot;to have 350w p/s&quot;.
having a larger p/s isn't going to hurt the system provided its &quot;doable&quot; as some systems either have propiertory cabling or rewired voltage output, great for thier systems but not &quot;generic&quot; to what typically available.
thus, you need be sure its not only rated to fit and compatible but also be at least 350w or better.
dell, may have an upgrade path from thier wares or not but check.
a good vendor to check with is  or google for any other vendor.
