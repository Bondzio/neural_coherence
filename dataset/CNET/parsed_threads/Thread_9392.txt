<s> I want a burner to just back up digital pictures and maybe convert some old VHS movies to DVD. </s>
<s> I have been looking at the SONY but while at Walmart noticed the Lite-On dual layer that uses all +/- formats. </s>
<s> It also comes with the Nero software and some others as well. </s>
<s> I believe it was $109.00 not a bad price and about $70.00 cheaper than the SONY. </s>
<s> Will it hold up do you guys think? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> of my builds. </s>
<s> I've found them reliable and replaceable (when needed) and worth the price. </s>
<s> Note that optical drives are realistically only going to last a year or two at best, then you replace them. </s>
<s> I might check out Newegg for comparing prices even though Walmarts return policy is a slam dunk. </s>

<s> I have a Lite-On DVD burner pre-installed on my newest computer, and I installed a Sony on an older system. </s>
<s> I've had the Lite-On for 6 months, and the Sony for a little over a year...an experience that challenges the &quot;big-name&quot; theory. </s>
<s> The Lite-on has had no problems, and is very quiet, only making a soft whirling sound at its highest speed. </s>
<s> The Sony, on the other hand, has been a little louder, and on a few occasions, had problems with the disks becoming &quot;unbalanced,&quot; while they worked fine in the Lite-On drive. </s>
<s> In addition, the Sony drive failed to burn twice...it claimed the burn had completed and showed the files on the disk. </s>
<s> I shut down the computer, and when I later tried to access it, I found the disk was blank (unfortunately I had already deleted the files from the hard drive). </s>
<s> I'm assuming that there was a software glitch, but have been double-checking all disks burned with the Sony drive since. </s>
<s> I'm sure that my experience will not hold true on all drives by these manufacturers, as each one is subject to its own quirks. </s>
<s> However, given this and the price difference, I would definately get the Lite-On multi-format DVD burner. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John P.S. </s>
<s> If you are looking for a DVD Recorder for your TV, I'd like to mention that Walmart's Ilo recorders are actually made by Lite-on, and their basic burner just went on clearance to $95 (from $150). </s>
<s> However, I have a Philips recorder, so I can't comment on the quality of that particular product. </s>
<s> Ummm... </s>
<s> Yes, it is. </s>
<s> It is in fact the same drive. </s>
<s> Lite-On makes a lot of burners for other companies, and Sony is one of their biggest customers. </s>
<s> You can check out this list of the OEM re-badged Lite-On drives to compare which Lite-On model is re-badged as which Sony model... http://codeguys.rpc1.org/dvdrw_overview.html Lite-On drives for years have been some of the top-rated drives by many of the burner sites, Like www.cdfreaks.com... </s>
<s> I have used Lite-On drives for years without ever having a problem... Their CD burners go on sale for $20 at Fry's all the time... </s>
<s> I have installed probably 25 of them... Having said that, I will say that in my own computers I have the NEC 3520A, which is an awesome drive, too. </s>
<s> Absolutely problem free for me, and they are only $38 plus $4 shipping at Newegg.com. </s>
<s> They don't have an external right now, though... </s>
<s> If you need an external, I would buy the Lite-On without hesitation. </s>
<s> I don't understand why you would ever need to replace any optical drive in a computer? </s>
<s> I've had my Dell 866 mhz for 5 years with dual optical drives and never once had any problems with either of them let alone need to replace them. </s>
<s> Any optical drive should last you (depending on your usage) the life of your computer. </s>
<s> The burner on my Dell is an LG installed by Dell. </s>
<s> I can proudly say that i've never had any problems with it. </s>
<s> I have the Ilo external DVD recorder and I'm trying to record from my laptop to the Ilo. </s>
<s> You say the Lite-On is the same, so I'm hoping that someone might have the info. </s>
<s> I hooked it up via USB, but they are not recognizing eachother. </s>
