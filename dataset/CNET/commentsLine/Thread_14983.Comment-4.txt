i found that in safe mode my display looks good.
but i also found i could set a new display size but that the box to set refresh rate was greyed out.
so no joy after rebooting.
i will move on to try other advice, such as re-installing the ati card and drivers.
thanks for your help, bob (ps, for what i need, running in safe mode is also acceptable, just tedious)
