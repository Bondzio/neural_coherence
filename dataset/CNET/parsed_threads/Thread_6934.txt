<s> First off, I own a Gateway GT4016 desktop computer. </s>
<s> On the front there's a little panel thing in one of the slots like where the dvd drive is fixed that has a USB connection and two slots labeled &quot;SD/MMC/SM/MS/MS-PRO/xD&quot; and &quot;CF/MICRODRIVE&quot;. </s>
<s> I, being the genius that I am, inserted my CF card from my camera into the CF drive, but I think I did it backwards. </s>
<s> It wasn't reading and didn't click or anything, so I got tweezers to try to pull it out, but that just pushed it in more and now I can't even try to pull it out from the front. </s>
<s> It doesn't read on My Computer and whenever I try to open the drive called &quot;CompactFlashI/II (H:)&quot; it says I need to insert a disk. </s>
<s> If I click eject, it does nothing. </s>
<s> My question is, how do I go about getting my card back out? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Most desktops allow the removal of the covers/skins. </s>
<s> If your system allows this then remove the frt. </s>
<s> bezel/cover. </s>
<s> You'll gain greater access maybe the depth of the bezel removed will be enough to grip the CF card. </s>
<s> Otherwise, if that area itself can be removed as like a cage unit to gain further access w/o actually tearing down the unit itself. </s>
<s> You'll still have to open case, etc. </s>
<s> to get into this. </s>
<s> All this info is generic in nature, you have to check then proceed. </s>
<s> I exclude any possible damage that may have happened if the CF card port was permanent. </s>
<s> All those memory cards, I can't recall if it used contact pins to mount vs. pads on the CF card. </s>
<s> You'll need to inspect after CF removal the card and port for continued us. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> try this see if the lower right corner of the screen where the system tray are show a white box with a upward green arror that same icon you see if you have a usb drive installed in if yes try clicking it. </s>
<s> try to see if you can eject the card treating it like if it was a usb drive 2nd option start computer then you will see a listing of all your drive right click on the drive where your card is see if you can get a pop up menu with the word 'eject' showing as one of the menu choice try clicking the eject from there to see if the card will come out good luck </s>
