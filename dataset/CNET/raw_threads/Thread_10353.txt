I dont know if anyone will want to hunt a laptop down for me but i need: 1 GB of RAM 12&quot; screen &gt;1.5 GHz Built-in Wireless Price below $1,000 (as low as possible would be good) Anyway, any help will be greatly appreciated! Thanks Doc

But yeah, if you need an inexpensive laptop then dell would probably be in your budget. Since you're not using it for gaming then 1000 should be more than enough. You may be looking for a Mac though, since you posted in the Mac section, but an iBook is slightly under 1000 before tax, and will most definitly meet your needs.
