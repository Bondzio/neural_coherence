<s> I recently had a new PC built which included iHAS224-SATA SuperAllwrite With LightScribe Cd/Dvd player. </s>
<s> I run Windows 7 Pro. </s>
<s> My Problem: The CDs I burn on this player will not play on my car CD player (Subaru 2001 Forrester.) </s>
<s> The burned CD will play on my daughters' cars (2003 and 2008 Ford models) and all other players around the house. </s>
<s> Could it be that my Subaru player is just to old? </s>
<s> Are there any types of adjustments I can make while burning the disc to solve this problem?? </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> and Thanks........... </s>
<s> This is well discussed. </s>
<s> You can read what the CDR FAQ (see google) has to say but the short version is to reduce the write speed to 2X and try other media. </s>
