<s> We have an old IBM NetVista desktop computer running Windows XP. </s>
<s> When we power it on, it gives 3 beeps and then powers off. </s>
<s> If we go through this many, many times it eventually does power up and seems to run ok until we power it off again and then the cycle starts over. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what could be wrong? </s>
<s> ...are usually fully detailed in your motherboard manual, but as ever (sigh) google to the rescue. </s>
