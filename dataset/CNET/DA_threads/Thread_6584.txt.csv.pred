1.1.1	Hi all , & lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; I have a Virgin Media Super Hub with a 60mpbs connection in my study on the first floor .	St
1.1.2	The hub is connected to my NAS and my laptop , both wired .	St
1.1.3	Wireless is disabled on the VM Super Hub , but it is not running in modem mode since I need access to the extra LAN ports .	St
1.1.4	& lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; A gigabit cable runs from the study to the living room on the ground floor where it is connected to the LAN port on a TP-Link n router .	St
1.1.5	There are three devices connected to the router , again wired .	St
1.1.6	This router acts as my wireless hub for all the devices in the house ( approx 10 devices in all ) .	St
1.1.7	I use only the TP-Link as the wireless router since its performance far exceeds that of the Super Hub .	St
1.1.8	& lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; Unfortunately , none of the routers are dual-band .	St
1.1.9	Now that I have a couple of dual-band capable devices , if I enable 5Ghz on the VM Super Hub and retaing the 2.4Ghz on the TP-link , will I get the benefits of dual band ?	Ques
1.1.10	If not , what would I need to configure in order to achieve that ?	Ques
1.1.11	Do they need to have the same SSID ?	Ques
1.1.12	& lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; Many thanks .	Polite

1.2.1	As that 's well discussed I 'll answer no and move on .	St
1.2.2	What is this benefit of dual band ?	Ques
1.2.3	You never revealed that .	St
1.2.4	I find that having a dual band helps since we know that WiFi is half duplex ( sorry if I do n't define all tech terms ) and that means only one device can transfer a packet at a time in only one direction .	St
1.2.5	Having a second WiFi channel ( you may call this dual band ) means we doubled our WiFi capacity .	St
