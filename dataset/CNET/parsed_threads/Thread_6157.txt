<s> Hello, I'm looking to know what the upgrade capabilities are on a Dell Dimension 3000. </s>
<s> It's like a 5 year old computer and I just upgraded to Windows 7 but here are my questions: -Largest Hard Drive (Hard Drive Size Not that Important, more Important is RPMs) -How Much RAM Can I put in this (I want 6 Gigs or More) -What Kind of Dedicated Graphics Card -Upgrade Processor Let me know. </s>
<s> My I'm a web developer &amp; my website is Current Century Media if I can't upgrade this system much I'll just continue to use it for Microsoft Office/Notepad Editors/XAMMP I also plan on buying a Lenovo IdeaPad U410 from the Windows Store... is this a good buy or not. </s>
<s> I want to start working with Illustrator &amp; In-Design. </s>
<s> Thanks, Ted Cacciola Current Century Media </s>
<s> I went to look but came away with what must be 100+ models in that line up. </s>
<s> Also, there appear to be some prior discussions on upgrading various Dells. </s>
<s> But without a specific model, no one can be specific. </s>
<s> As to RAM, use crucial.com. </s>

<s> Dell stopped driver support for that machine at XP. </s>
<s> If you installed W7 I suspect your running windows generic drivers.....not good for perf. </s>
<s> Crucial says 2GB max ram. </s>
<s> That's ok for XP.......not so good for W7. </s>
<s> You need to visit the Dell support website and using your service tag#, enter it and find the exact details of what your PC was build as. </s>
<s> Then find any upgrades that Dell provides, but you needn't buy from them, buy similar from other vendors. </s>
<s> However, IMHO, you should chuck this PC if you really want this for some business as it already too dated and any upgrades won't really make it a swift or real dependable PC, it has to work real hard to keep up and/or become stressed. </s>
<s> Check your local Craigslist and find out what that PC is going for and then check what others are selling that maybe more upgradeable and/or simply better to begin with. </s>
<s> In other words put you possible upgrade funds to better use on a newer PC. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
