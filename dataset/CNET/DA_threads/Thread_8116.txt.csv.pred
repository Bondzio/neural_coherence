1.1.1	ok im building a gaming pc with an i5-3750k CPU ... i want to mainly play diablo 3 and starcraft 2 on ultra settings , witch i believe NVDIA favors -- - also looking into games such as Crysis 3 , B3 , and Metro witch i heard the 7950 favors because of memory/bandwidth yadda yadda yadda.. so im asking YOU PEOPLE FOR HELP ! !	St
1.1.2	also .	St
1.1.3	PhysX looks sick just saying ... and more games are starting to offer it -- PLEASE COMMENT .	St
1.1.4	*FACTS* GTX 660Ti ***VS*** Radeon HD 7950	St
1.2.1	Meaning they swap places on what they each do better .	St
1.2.2	If it was my call and I was going to spend 300 bucks ... ..I 'd go with the 7950 .	St
1.2.3	Way better bandwidth .	St
1.3.1	im using one monitor if that makes a difference ?	Ques
1.3.2	what role does bandwidth play over the 660Ti ?	Ques
1.3.3	there is no price difference right now	St
1.4.1	I 'd head to google and type in TOMSHARDWARE and then add the card in question then the word REVIEW .	St
1.4.2	I know they did the 7750 and recall they did the 660 so you can compare the two and pick the one that did better on the game in question .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	That refers to how fast you can feed the card .	St
1.5.2	For game play across multiple games this is important .	St
1.5.3	For game play on a specific game perhaps not so much .	St
1.5.4	Search for reviews ... ... ..I think your going to find that overall the 7950 is the better card .	St
