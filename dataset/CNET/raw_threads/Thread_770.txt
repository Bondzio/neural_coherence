7360	0	46668	552953	NR	HJE	11/19/04 9:51 AM	1.10085786E12	HP Laserjet 4P printer	My printer has suddenly decided to cut off items that I print from the internet or emails. Sometimes it's just the first couple of letters on the left side, other times it can be 3 to 5 words on the left side. I don't know why it is doing this and I have tried and checked everything I can think of to get it to print everything. There must be something I'm overlooking and if anyone can help me I'd sure appreciate it! I use Windows 98 on an IBM clone.

To check to see if that's the case, try removing the developer and gently shaking it horizontally to redistribute the toner. If it works, good, but your cartridge may be running low on toner.
