1.1.1	I have a laptop PC running Vista ( I have a windows 7 upgrade but am afraid to try to install it ) I also have a cannon mp830 all in one fax/printer/etc .	St
1.1.2	Internet service is high speed cable from comcast .	St
1.1.3	I would like to minimize my cables and add some flexibility to my current set up .	St
1.1.4	I want to add a wireless router , add capapability to print/fax etc wirelessly , and maybe add a budget friendly modem ( I lease mine from comcast however $ 5/ month starting to add up ) ... my condo is not that big ( under 1000 sq ft ) and pretty open .	St
1.1.5	Home office set up in living room .	St
1.1.6	the farthest i would get from the router is walking up a flight of steps to my deck outside above my condo , maybe 20 ft vertically above me .	St
1.1.7	is there an all in one router/modem that will also enable me to print wirelessly ?	Ques
1.1.8	I tried asking a couple of online retailers however 2 declined sales support and the other recommended equipment that would be suitable for an office .	St
1.1.9	I only have one computer and a single printer .	St
1.1.10	it does not need to be overly complicated or high tech ( or expensive ) .	St
1.1.11	I know that speed bottlenecks can occur anywhere in the system though im sure that current routers ( and a new modem ) will eclipse what i currently have speedwise .	St
1.1.12	also , will i have compatability issues if i decide to upgrade to windows 7 suggestions ... ..thx	St
1.2.1	I might suggest you get your own modem and router .	St
1.2.2	I run a D-link DCM-202 modem and a D-link DIR-655 router .	St
1.2.3	Both mine .	St
1.2.4	The modem is DOCSYS 2.0 ( will handle the highest speed connection ) and the router is wireless N and Gigabit wired .	St
1.2.5	With this setup you are wired and wireless for the future .	St
1.2.6	I do not recommend a modem/router combo .	St
1.2.7	Waaaaay too much trouble to configure .	St
1.2.8	Print wirelessly ?	Ques
1.2.9	Is the printer a wireless printer ?	Ques
1.2.10	If so the router will find it .	St
1.2.11	If not , keep it wired .	St
1.2.12	There are wireless printer adapters out there but they can be a PITA .	St
1.2.13	My router is printer compatible ( wired ) .	St
1.2.14	It can act as a print server .	St
1.2.15	Connect it to the router and carry the laptop around .	St
