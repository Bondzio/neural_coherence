<s> My daughter wants a Netbook PC and I went to Bestbuy today to see what they had. </s>
<s> I saw 2, a Gateway LT2104u and an Asus 115PEB-RRED01S. </s>
<s> The Asus is about $20 more. </s>
<s> The specs look about the same with the ASUS appartently having longer battery life. </s>
<s> I asked the Geek squad guy which was better and he said the Gateway. </s>
<s> Any ideas out there on the forum? </s>
<s> Both have the same processor and 250gb hard drives. </s>
<s> The ASUS says it has IntelUMA Graphics, teh Gateway says it has Intel 3150 accelerator. </s>
<s> Anyway, let me know your thoughts. </s>

<s> I Personally would go with Asus, Mainly for the reason that their parts are greatly appreciated by myself. </s>
<s> especially motherboards. </s>
