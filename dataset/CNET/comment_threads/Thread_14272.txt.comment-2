http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/readyboost.mspx runs with Vista superfetch feature only, but you can add this to your computer, format it and convert the entire drive to virtual memory.
A chip to chip connection is better then a chip to drive connection.
This will give an older system more virtual memory, some say it works better with older systems then newer ones.
Once installed and formatted the drive should not be removed so put it in a rear USB port on the desk top.
A 2GB USB can be bought for about $20.00 or less.
