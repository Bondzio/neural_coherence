<s> The new article with a sneek peak of Windows longhorn has made me much less stressed out ( http://tinyurl.com/75dhm ). </s>
<s> Someone said you would need like 4GB of RAM to run it well and you would also have to have a 64 bit processor. </s>
<s> Well not only does the article mention it will need &quot;at least 512MB of RAM&quot; but it also says it comes in a 64 bit AND 32 bit versions. </s>
<s> I think that because longhorn will also have 32 bit version, 64 bit will become the standard at a much later time then most people were expecting. </s>
<s> I'm just very thankful that M$ didnt just go all out and make a OS that needs a $2,000+ computer to run. </s>
<s> Longhorn will require more than 512MB of RAM. </s>
<s> I have never had &quot;any&quot; version of Windows run smoothly with the minimum recommended RAM. </s>
<s> I think MS must base their calculations on the premise that Windows will be the &quot;only&quot; program installed on your computer. </s>
<s> -JDM (*BTW, the people I've talked to about Longhorn say that most of the good stuff will be under the hood. </s>
<s> That's nice to know, but it will be a tough sell for MS...people like what they can see.) </s>
<s> Its like windows XP, it says it can run on 128MB of RAM but you should probobly have 256MB. </s>
<s> So in this case it probobly means you should have 1GB, which is much more do able then 4GB. </s>
<s> What do you mean by under the hood? </s>
<s> Does that mean just over all better performance? </s>
<s> Oh and the artice mentions you need a good GPU. </s>
<s> Do you think it would turn off all the extra effects while you are playing a game? </s>
<s> Its bad enough that windows wastes a lot of your processing power when playing a game... </s>
<s> It would really suck if windoes also started watering down your GPU. </s>
<s> and &quot;better written&quot; software is what I've been told. </s>
<s> My contacts say it's going to be a great new &quot;framework&quot; for doing bigger and better things. </s>
<s> Their verdict is &quot;awesome&quot;...and they are really picky guys. </s>
<s> Knowing them, they're impressed by things like &quot;stability&quot;, &quot;efficiency&quot;, &quot;security&quot;, &quot;expansion capacity&quot;, etc. </s>
<s> (I'm not a programmer, so I don't understand exactly what it is that has them so excited--but they are quite excited.) </s>
<s> From what I know, once you've installed the software, it won't be easy to enable/disable the enhanced graphical features. </s>
<s> That will be more of an &quot;initial setup&quot; issue. </s>
<s> I would assume, however, that those features wouldn't really interfere with game play. </s>
<s> -JDM </s>
<s> Lets see now, longhorn is NOT in a beta yet, over a year away. </s>
<s> DON'T HOLD YOUR BRAETH!! </s>
<s> Lets review some history. </s>
<s> Windows 95 hype for 3 years!! </s>
<s> Befor it came out. </s>
<s> Many probles with the product. </s>
<s> Then Win98 didn't work good untill second edition in '99 Then WinME to many problems to go into. </s>
<s> Win XP now on SP2 still lots of problems!! </s>
<s> MS has had to take so much out of longhorn that it should be called shorthorn. </s>
<s> There is an old saying &quot; The proof of the pudding is in the eating&quot;. </s>
<s> Right now MS is selling sizzle but there is no steak. </s>
<s> I look a longhorn maybe when it gets to SP1. </s>
