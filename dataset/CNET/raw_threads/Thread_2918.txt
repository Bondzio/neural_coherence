I have a PC running Win XP Pro and a laptop (acer aspire) running Win XP Home. Both have wireless adapters installed and working. When I connect them via crossover cable it all works wonderfully. File sharing and internet works great. Outlook, messenger and everything works fine. The PC connects to the internet through ethernet adapter which connects to a cable modem. The internet works fine on my PC. HOWEVER, when i set up a peer to peer 'ad hoc' wireless network, the file sharing works fine however the internet does very strange things. Certain websites work fine (such as google, bbc.co.uk and certain others), however others just don't load at all. Messenger doesnt work, outlook doesnt download e-mails and no videos or programs will download. I have tried this with my friends laptop too (same make) and the same thing happens!! I have tried pinging several websites.....google, bbc work fine, but ebay, msn, natwest all time out. I have tried changing the MAC address and playing around with the ip addresses, but not being an expert i dont really know what i am doing!! If you have heard of this problem and know how to sort it, please let me know, cos this is driving me insane!! Thanks.
