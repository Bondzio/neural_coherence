<s> I have an external Hard Disk (internal disk converted to external by means of an enclosure). </s>
<s> It is connected to my computer through USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Because my internal hard diak already runs-out of disk space, I plan to install programs, applications and games to it. </s>
<s> Is it possible or it's the same in terms of performance as an internal drive? </s>
<s> Because I think external hard disk is only used for saving files (documents, pictures, music and videos) or for back-up purposes. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> Most programs allow install on any drive. </s>
<s> So, in principle, it's yes. </s>
<s> But it's slower. </s>
<s> And it's less reliable. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
<s> Alternatives: - clean unnecessary files from your internal hard disk - install a second internal disk (not possible with a laptop, alas) - install a bigger internal disk than you have now - store other files on your external (but DON'T FORGET THE BACKUP!) </s>
<s> in stead of these programs Kees </s>
