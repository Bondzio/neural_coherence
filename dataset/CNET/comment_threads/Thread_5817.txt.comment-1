So I'm sitting here at 2:49 am trying to lead a QA test for an MMO emulator, and building my christmas computer too.
Heres my question for every body, Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 Processor HH80557PJ0804MGS - 3.0GHz, 4MB Cache, 1333MHz FSB, Conroe, Dual-Core, OEM, Socket 775, Processor OR Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Processor HH80562PH0568M - 2.40GHz, 8MB Cache, 1066MHz FSB, Kentsfield, Quad-Core, OEM, Socket 775, Processor The good old Dual vs Quad.
The dual core has 1333MHz fsb, its also clocked 600 Mhz higher although reviews say its overclocking power is nowhere near that of the Q6600.
The Quad core has a slightly less fsb at 1066 MHz, but it is quad core which will be optimal for future support in gaming (hopefully) There have been reports of the Q6600 being overclocked to 3.6Ghz stable I believe.
So which would you choose and why?
