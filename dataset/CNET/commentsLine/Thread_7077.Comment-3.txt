for wifi i rarely find that to work.
go back to dhcp now.
also let's say this is a cable modem.
be sure when switching to the router from a direct connection to power down the cable modem, move the ethernet to the router then power up the cable modem.
why this is needed is written about widely.
i'll stop here with one more admonishment.
use our forum sticky for setup of the router.
