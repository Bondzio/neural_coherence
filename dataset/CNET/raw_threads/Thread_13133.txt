I just bought a MacBook Pro about a week ago, and installed WinXP SP2 through Boot Camp. Everything has worked fine up until this morning when my BT mouse suddenly stopped working on both Mac OS X and Windows. I fixed the problem on the Mac OS X by trashing a preference file, and the mouse now works perfectly. It still does not work on Windows, though. When I try to install it, it locates the mouse, connects, but the system tray displays the following message: &quot;A problem occured during hardware installation. Your hardware might not work properly&quot;. I have a feeling it is a software problem. I tried reinstalling the Boot Camp software, but it didn't work. Does anyone have an idea what I should do? Thanks!
