I first noticed this when I was attempting to print a page from the internet. I thought it might have been grayed out areas from the internet site. Then I copied the page to Word and printed. The same bars showed up. Then I put a document on the scanner and copied. The bars continue to appear. I had the Black cartridge refiled before this happened. Could this be the culprit?

If you've been around the usual service counters you find consumers that can't use a new cart since it costs more than a new printer. And printers over 2 years old with rare exception are never serviced but tossed and replaced. The x7170 looks to be that old. Bob

I know this is an older printer but it has been working great until lately. I will buy another cartridge and hopefully this will solve my problem.

A Mr. Proffitt stated, this is a pretty old printer, if a cartridge or cleaning sheets don't resolve the issue, time to replace.

You didn't mention anything about your system, OS etc. I'd reinstall from scratch and also take a look at Lexmark's site for upgrades/updates.

The problem was there when I printed a print head alignment page. I am assuming that would be like a self test. The problem is also there when I make a copy. I am convinced the problem is in the refiled printer cartridge.

6929	10	600680	5495155	5495067	Homer-not	9/6/13 9:38 AM	1.37846028E12	another PC	That, too, is part of my problem. I don't have another PC to connect the printer to. When it prints the problem while making a direct copy and from the head alignment it convinces me the problem is in the cartridge.
6929	11	600680	5495133	5495155	R. Proffitt	9/6/13 9:44 AM	1.37846064E12	Sorry	But when I wrote the printer, a cartridge is part of the printer however I've seen such things and only those new to the repair counter would know it's the cart. But worth changing as it's cheap. Bob

6929	14	600680	5495562	5495189	pgc3	9/7/13 8:45 AM	1.3785435E12	Sign	Yuppers, toast city...unless, and I doubt, it is simply the cartridge.
