<s> Mk so many problems here... </s>
<s> I recently got a HP G71 laptop from a friend who said thatit would not start up correctly and the Bootmgr was broken. </s>
<s> Well, in my attempt to fix it I found that the D: drive was also 'missing'. </s>
<s> So as I tried to fix bootmgr using a windows 7 repair disc and going through that crap I eventually found that the bootmgr cant be fixed till the hard drive is. </s>
<s> So, I ran this thing where it says at the top 'Checking Disk Local Disk (D:)' and I knew there was bad clusters so I checked the thing about attempt to clean up bad clusters. </s>
<s> So far this checking disk thing has been going on for almost 3 days. </s>
<s> and its at about 60% progress.. </s>
<s> I would also like to wipe everything off the laptop before I give it to my girlfriend that way she pretty much has a fresh start and not a ton of crap. </s>
<s> My questions are.. Is it supposed to take this long? </s>
<s> Am I on the right path? </s>
<s> &gt; If I'm no,t how do I fix this? </s>
<s> Will doing all this wipe my Hard-Drive like I want? </s>
<s> Any questions I will answer to the best of my abilities </s>
<s> My first thought, if I'd gotten such a laptop, would be to do a factory re-installation of the system so I'd have some starting point. </s>
<s> If the restore partition was still good and accessible, this would be a good thing to try. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I don't know the keystrokes to attempt this but you could check the HP web site for instructions. </s>
<s> It may be that the restore partition is gone or damaged and you cannot fix this without the proper media. </s>
<s> I would wonder, as well, if the issue could have occurred by the laptop being dropped and the HD suffering physical damage. </s>
<s> In that case, you'd need a new drive. </s>
<s> You could try to pull the drive to see who manufactured it, go to their web site and find their diagnostics disk to check the drive. </s>
<s> You'd need to make bootable media to do so. </s>
<s> If the drive is good but you've no way to rebuild the system due to lack of proper disks, you go to HP and ask to purchase them if available. </s>
<s> That's about all I can offer as there's no known history to give a hint as to what the problem could have been caused by. </s>
<s> Did you try using the restore media for this PC? </s>
<s> Idk how I would do the media thing.. but when I tried to do all the restore points and everything I was not able to. </s>
<s> It was all because the hard drive was 'missing' and when I would look at the hard drive in some windows it wouldn't show the amount of memory it had and when I opened it, it would have no files in it. </s>
<s> so I ended up popping off the back to make sure it was secure. </s>
<s> And as far as the history of the damage. </s>
<s> Apparently this was my friend's friend's computer. </s>
<s> And she one day got pissed off and threw it to the ground and punched it. </s>
<s> Then when she started the computer it started with the whole broken bootmgr. </s>
<s> If this is true, I'd say you not only need a new laptop but maybe some new friends. </s>
<s> I'd not put a dime into it. </s>
<s> If the screen isn't damaged, maybe you can ebay it for parts. </s>
<s> Well, my friends are fine xD its my friends of friends that are a little outgoing and brutal =P yeah, she beat the crap out of it then when she started it up she apparently said &quot;I think it got a virus&quot; with all serious-ness too. </s>
<s> I couldn't help but laugh. </s>
<s> Anyways, I just received the laptop for free and if I could fix it I still get to keep it. </s>
<s> Soooo, lets say that the hard drive is able to work it just isn't. </s>
<s> How would I go about fixing it in its current state. </s>
<s> It is still doing the Checking Disk thing where it says XXXXXXX free clusters processed. </s>
<s> Would this clean up all the bad clusters? </s>
<s> Then after this what would I do to continue fixing it to eventually get it in working order? </s>
<s> You need the recovery/restore discs for that model# laptop. </s>
<s> -OR- an install OS disc that's from retail sources. </s>
<s> You can order a replacement disc from HP provided it is still available in wares for some cost. </s>
<s> This cost is usually less than store brought. </s>
<s> I suggest you query for those disc(s) in order to attempt a reload of the OS. </s>
<s> You can contact HP for details via the HP support website, look for replacement discs. </s>
<s> With all the problems you have, then that's the way to go provided you have a display on the screen. </s>
<s> Of course, contact your friend and see what discs they have available. </s>
<s> Beware, though there maybe a possibility the HD is actually bad which is either part of multiple problems or the source of. </s>
<s> No matter you need those disc(s). </s>
<s> A quick test is to get the Ubuntu &quot;LiveCD&quot; version, burn to disc using the .ISO file. </s>
<s> Once done it should be bootable, place in drive and reboot. </s>
<s> That way, you do some testing and accessing to see what if anything is wrong. </s>
<s> That is a freebie OS and works on many laptops. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> program. </s>
<s> These can be downloaded as an image and burned to floppy or CD. </s>
<s> They'll tell you if the HD is good or not. </s>
<s> If not, you need to get a new HD to make it work. </s>
<s> As Willy said, a live Linux disk could be of value as it can check your other hardware for functionality. </s>
<s> It can't do much in the way of hard drive diagnostics though. </s>
<s> But the check finally finished... Yep the hard drive is screwed. </s>
<s> Lol, my girlfriend isnt too happy about it. </s>
<s> Know anyone wanting to buy laptop parts? </s>
<s> xD </s>
