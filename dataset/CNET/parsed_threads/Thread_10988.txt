<s> I was given a custom built computer with XP Pro. </s>
<s> It has no plugs for keyboard or mouse only 3 usb plugs in back and 2 in front. </s>
<s> I have tried plugging in a USB keyboard and a USB Mouse in all but at boot in Cmos it says &quot;No Keyboard detected&quot; Then &quot;No Mouse detected&quot;. </s>
<s> It then proceeds to the windows sign on screen wanting a password. </s>
<s> I know the password but unable to enter or by pass the screen because Keyboard and mouse are not recognized. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> They must have had a working k and m to install so ask them what works. </s>
<s> Bob I did your suggestion first.Unable to find the origional builder, that's why it was given to me. </s>
<s> Would installing a PCI usb card work or do I need to get past the sign on screen first? </s>
<s> Try some PS2 keyboard and in the bios set the USB Keyboard Support to enabled. </s>
<s> Bob! </s>
<s> As I stated this machine was custom built without any PS/2 connectors. </s>
<s> I can't very well plug in a ps/2 keyboard without a place to plug it in. </s>
<s> Or has some Dell board (you have to reveal details like that.) </s>
<s> You might consider recycling parts into a new machine that works. </s>
<s> Who's to say that all the USB ports are blown? </s>
<s> And no, an USB PCI card rarely works in this sort of blown board issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> I appreciate you expert opinion. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Reset the CMOS with that jumper, etc. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Beg, borrow a DELL USB keyboard. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> JUST the USB KEYBOARD. </s>
<s> NO OTHER DEVICES. </s>
