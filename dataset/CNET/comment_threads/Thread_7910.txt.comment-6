Try remove all parts that is not needed in booting the PC.
reseat the CPU, HDD cable and all other cables , also the Video Card, swap the RAM in different slot if using more than 1 RAM.. Reset the system by doing the following: unplug the power cord , pressing the button over 20seconds to discharge the mainboard and connect the power cord again.
Power on the PC and see if your PC boots with the CPU, RAM, HDD, VGA and KB/mouse only.
Hope this helps.
