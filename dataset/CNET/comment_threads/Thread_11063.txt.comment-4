I just read that Bob Proffit says this can be done and he's usually right.You have to check the cost of doing this against the cost of another drive and the peace of mind factor.
There is always some satisfaction to be gained by recovering broken gear but I think I would not put anything that I couldn't live without on that drive,Resoldered or not.
However I am not noted as an optomist:-) Best regards Stewart
