what's the ambient temp in the room where the pcs located ?
re a better hs fans....lots of options ....take a look over at overclockers.com ...they've got reviews on lots of aftermarket products you can read about.
you could also try removing the stock hs fan and using a more efficient thermal compound..something like arctic silver 5.
