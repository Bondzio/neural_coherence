I am hoping for a little help again. here are my specs Model : Dell Dimension 2400 Chassis Type : Space Saving Service Tag : FR99741 Operating System : Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 (Build 2600) Hard Drive 1 : ST380011A Serial Number : 3JV94TCB Size : 76.29 GB Buffer : 2048 KB Hard Drive Type : ATA Current Transfer Rate : UDMA-100 Max Transfer Rate : UDMA-100 Volumes : c :\ Size : 76.25 GB (34.95 GB Free) Optical Drive 1 : HL-DT-ST DVD-ROM GDR8162B Type : DVD-ROM drive Current CD Read Speed : 20X ( Max 48X ) Optical Drive 2 : TEAC DVD+RW DV-W58E Type : DVD/CD-RW combo drive Current CD Read Speed : 40X ( Max 40X ) Current CD Write Speed : 32X ( Max 32X ) PROBLEM : I can only burn music CDS with my drive. I used to be able to put pics on either cd or dvd disks. i also used to be able to put video onto a DVD (HOME MOVIE) i HAVE DVD DECRYPTOR, DVD SHRINK, AND WINDOWS(FOR MY PICS). Most forums that i have read say that my drive has gone bad; they dont tend to last very long. I guess my question is why can i burn music cds but when i try to burn pictures or movies my software doesnt recognize that there is media in the drive. i have tried dvd-rw and dvd+rw , cd-r and cd-rw media. I have also tried to troubleshoot using windows but i dont get anywhere. I am hoping there is a simple fix that i have over looked.

In your post you say you can burn music cd's (but no data cd's). That seems a contradiction. And isn't the recognition part of the burning the same for burning a music CD or a data CD? So where in the turn of events does it differ. You can try to burn using a free program called CDBURNERXP. If that doesn't work either, I'd replace the drive and try again. Replacing is a rather easy job and the drives aren't expensive. Kees

I use the same burner w/out any problem when i burn music cd's. But when i want to burn to a dvd media, my software (no matter which one i try) says to insert media. by your reaction i'm getting that this is probably a user error? Or could it be that the drive just needs replaced? I was hoping there was a missing driver or update.

Now you say you can't burn to dvd-media (only), an nothing about data cd's. If ALL cd's work and NO DVD's work, it's most likely a hardware issue. Why are you so reluctant to accept that fact? Kees
