Then maybe a pix on the web.
I did say they do vary and I'll be leading blindfolded, so search for a pix.
If it doesn't lend itself to be taken apart, then you will void the warranty, so do you want to proceed?

So, exactly what product do you have, GeForce XYZ123?
is the chipset not the maker, so a model# is somewhere on the product, sticker/decal maybe?
