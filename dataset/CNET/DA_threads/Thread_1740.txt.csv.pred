1.1.1	I am running XP .	St
1.1.2	My desktop has two internal hard drives .	St
1.1.3	I have two Seagate FreeAgent USB/eSATA 500 GB external hard drives .	St
1.1.4	I am currently connecting them , one at a time , with USB2 cables .	St
1.1.5	The problem is that my computer will read only one of the external drives at a time .	St
1.1.6	I can plug both in , but the computer will not recognise both .	St
1.1.7	A friend in Europe says that he plugs all his ext hds into a usb hub , which then goes into a computer usb port .	St
1.1.8	I have one of these hubs , but am not currently using it .	St
1.1.9	The Seagate technician told me that , indeed , my computer would not recognise both external hard drives at once : that connecting them both could corrupt them .	St
1.1.10	This does n't make sense to me .	St
1.1.11	I still have the firewire cable for one ( probably both . )	St
1.1.12	I did not connect with the firewire cable because I do n't need the speed .	St
1.1.13	These drives are for safety backup of what is already on the internal hard drive and for access to an internet sharing hub .	St
1.1.14	It is necessary for me to access both external drives in one session .	St
1.1.15	Would I blow something up if I connected one drive to the next via usb2 , then the second one to the desktop ?	Ques
1.1.16	Would firewire cables work this way ?	Ques
1.1.17	Would ext hds of different brands or sizes be read at the same time ?	Ques
1.1.18	I blew up a maxtor some months ago , and do n't know if it happened because I plugged it into the wrong voltage adaptor , or tried to connect two Maxtors at once .	St
1.1.19	Obviously , I have since learned that Maxtor is the second line of WD .	St
1.1.20	Not much was lost except one very important folder of data which can not be duplicated .	St
1.1.21	Good lesson .	St
1.1.22	But that is history .	St
1.1.23	I just do n't want to do it again If I could get a 1 TB Seagate , then I would , but I have not found them yet .	St
1.1.24	And even so , I would n't want to waste the 500 gb drives if they could all be connected .	St
1.1.25	I hope I have not worded this problem in too complicated a way .	St
1.2.1	yes , you can break something .	Res
1.2.2	Are the drive cases USB powered or do they have their own external power supply ?	Ques
1.2.3	BTW , here is the Seagate Terabyte unit .	St
1.2.4	http : //www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/desktops/barracuda_hard_drives/barracuda_7200.11/	St
1.3.1	I was just asking a question in a post above and saw this so I figured I 'd drop in ...	St
1.3.2	I run 2 Seagate externals along with a Maxtor external into 5 different USB onboard ports , the 2 Maxtors into the box directly and the Seagate into a hub that also has a printer , an Ipod , a digital camera and a housed laptop HD for carting around stuff bigger than my flash drive will handle ... the HD maker should n't be an issue , the OS should see them as separate entities..	St
1.3.3	I 've found that an external USB hub with its own power supply helps because sometimes the amperage draw from the external drives collapses the onboard USB feed .	St
1.3.4	Also , there 's USB cables to be had with one connector on one end and 2 on the other for hookups that need more power .	St
1.3.5	Depending upon the onboard current availability of the system , this has always worked for me ...	St
1.3.6	I 've never run 2 drives in series , it 's an interesting thought if you can provide them the power they need ... but please do n't take that as an endorsement , I really do n't know ... and on my machine the Firewire bus is it 's own boss so I also plug stuff in there from time to time .	St
1.3.7	If your machine has a separate amperage source for USB and Firewire it 's an easy answer ... And in reality , Maxtor is the second line of Seagate .	St
1.3.8	Happened a few years ago .	St
1.3.9	WD is a stand alone who bought the company who developed SATA technology ... and in general , 1TB drives are 2 500s slaved in the same housing ... hmm , if they share a partition I guess your thoughts or ganging them could be a good one ...	St
1.3.10	So I hope that helps , if for no other reason than to say I run different brands of HDs all the time and have never had a problem , except the weird thing I posted before ... Good luck !	St
1.3.11	Wayne	St
1.4.1	Both your messages have helped clarify -- and caution me !	St
1.4.2	Both of the ext drives do have their own power supplies .	St
1.4.3	Is is at all possible that , because the two ext drives are the same size , and the same brand and model no , that the C drive can not distinguish ?	Ques
1.4.4	What if I hooked up one via firewire , and left the other alone with the usb2 .	St
1.4.5	It just now occurs to me that my usb hub is not usb 2 , so that might make a difference in capabilities -- maybe only speed , which , as I said , is not a problem .	St
1.4.6	thank you again for your help and for any more someone or you can give .	Polite
