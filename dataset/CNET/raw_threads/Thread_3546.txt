Then it all shuts back off. The first time this happened I played with the battery on the motherboard a little bit and after that the computer went back to working, but only half the time. I decided that it was the battery so I bought a new one and put it in and then the computer started up fine ~5 times. Now (after going ~8 hours off) it's doing the same thing it did before. Anyone know what this is? Bad motherboard?

That fan MUST start with the computer power-up, and MUST run all the time, to keep the CPU temperature in limits. It sounds as though the motherboard or CPU overheat protection is shutting down your machine to prevent the CPU from cooking. Roger

The small black plastic fan (a little bit left of center) is the one that isn't working (and hasn't been for a while). I guess I'll try to get some more fans going in my room.

You just let it go and that may have resulted in the chip burning up. While you can replace that fan, it is more likely you have a damaged chip and a new fan won't help at all.

If you're lucky you'll be able to continue on. If damage has already been done, it will continue to shutdown but at longer intervals before doing so even with a working fan. Otherwise damage is too great and time to pitch the mtrbd. in the trash. Let it be a lesson not to be repeated. good luck -----Willy

Now though it's going back to doing what it was doing...about half the time. What's weird is if I unplug all drives, then it starts up fine everytime (althought obviously it tells me no drives are found). Would this indicate a power problem?

So...get ready to say goodby to it. BUT BEFORE YOU DO...download a freeway MB diagnostic program (Use TUCOWS as a source) and find out for use what is working and what is not. Perhaps you have laying around somewhere the install/driver CD that came with your motherboard/computer. The manufacturer may have included a diagnostic program on that CD for just such a time like this. Check it out. God's Speed!
