i just got a acomdata external hd enclosure (usb 2.0/firewire) and i want to hook my main pc to it using the firewire (done sucessfully) and my laptop up to it at the same time using the usb connection.
can this be done without damaging the unit?
i have successfully plugged it into the laptop with only the usb interface (no connection through firewire at that time).
thanks for the advice
