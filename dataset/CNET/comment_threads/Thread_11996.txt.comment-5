I quit using Norton 2 years ago.
I now use AVG.
You can get the free version.
That's what I started out with but I upgraded to the pay version.
I like it much better than Norton.
I also vote for Zone Alarm over XP firewall.
The XP firewall was probably turned on by default.
but check at Start/Control Panel/Security Center.
When you install Zone Alarm it will turn off the Windows firewall automatically.
