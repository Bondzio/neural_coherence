the geforce 6800 is not clearly faster than a radeon x1600pro.
one wins some benchmarks while the other wins different benchmarks.
neither can play recent, graphics intensive games like f.e.a.r.
or call of duty 2 with frame rates at high detail settings.
a radeon x800gto is about the same speed as a x1600xt and about the same price as the 6800. the gto lacks shader model 3/hdr, but oblivion's hdr can slow a 7800/1800 to a crawl so its a moot feature.
here's an article that compares a 1600xt and a 6800 (note that the x800 is slower than a x800gto).
it's too bad that nvidia chose to pull the 6800gs since the was hands-down the best midrange agp card a few months ago.
tigerdirect still has a few:
