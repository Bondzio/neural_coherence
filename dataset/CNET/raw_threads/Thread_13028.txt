People told me that Samsung DVD-Roms give the best performance, but when I checked in the stores, they were all out of samsung and they said that there is a shortage of samsung players. I live in a country where there is no online shopping or stuff like that so that's out of the question. Now, I currently have a Lite On Cd writer and it has worked very well for the past couple of years and is still working fine. I was thinking of buying a Lite ON Dvd rom. The brands available here are Sony, Lite On, Asus, MSI and mercury. Please help me in deciding which one to buy, or should i just wait for the samsung to come back into the stores but that may not happen for another ......who knows.....two years!!!

DVDROM drives are commodity items and the important item appears to be the bundled DVD player software. Outside of the too noisy drive that Creative Labs had years ago, I've yet to find any drive to be preferred. One note. Keep the drive cool and leave an air gap top and bottom for the best lifespan.
