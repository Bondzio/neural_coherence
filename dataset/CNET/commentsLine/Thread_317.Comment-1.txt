i have installed a siemens gigaset se572 wlan dsl wireless router.
unfortunately it has only one port, for connection to pc.
i want to network my dell 3100cn laser printer which is not wireless.
i have tried connecting a newlink 5 port hub using the uplink to the wireless router but the router cannot recognise connection.
the port next to the uplink is empty and i have used non-crossover cabling.
can anyone advise me on how to network my printer.
