<s> I reviewed an older thread on this topic and followed the suggestions, but no joy. </s>
<s> I have replaced my laptop with a new one, running Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> I have set up network sharing as directed, and my laptop can see an modify files on the XP system. </s>
<s> The XP system can see the files on the Vista laptop, but when I try to open one, I get the XP message &quot;[path] is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission ....&quot;. </s>
<s> Yet I have set sharing permissions on the laptop to Everyone. </s>
<s> I also see in the Vista File Sharing panels the comment &quot;People must have a user account for this computer to access files...&quot; Does this mean I have to create an account for my XP machine? </s>
<s> If so, how do you do this for a 'user' on another machine on the network? </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice Perry B </s>
<s> Everyone with an account. </s>
<s> Why not try making those accounts? </s>
<s> I find it interesting that people read this but don't try. </s>

<s> As I said, there does not seem to be a way to create an account for a user on a remote computer ... it's obviously easy to create an account on the host computer, but I need one that will activate the path \\XP System\user. </s>
<s> I have also set up and permissioned &quot;Everyone&quot; but that doesn't work. </s>
<s> When you login, you have an account name. </s>
<s> THAT NAME must have an account in each machine you want to access this machine from. </s>
<s> The rules are simple. </s>
<s> Just tell me what step stops you from creating the account. </s>
<s> And let's repeat this. </s>
<s> &quot;Everyone&quot; is not &quot;Anyone.&quot; The difference is worth repeating. </s>
<s> &quot;Everyone&quot; in windows networking is those with an account. </s>
<s> &quot;Anyone&quot; would be those with or without an account. </s>
