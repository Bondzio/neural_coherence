<s> Is it possible for a Hard Drive to overheat and cause lock-ups? </s>
<s> I've put fans on everything else that could overheat and im still having heat problems. </s>
<s> I see some try everything but the cover off. </s>
<s> &quot;I have fans.&quot; -&gt; Also, try my usual scans of HOUSECALL and EWIDO. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> How are you capturing or measuring thet 'overheat' info ??? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I had taken the cover off after and its stopped. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if its the Hard Drives that are overheating, I just locked it up, took off the case and felt everything. </s>
<s> CPU, Video Card, and Chipset were all nice and cool while the Hard Drives were burning hot. </s>
<s> With the side off/open....does it still overheat ? </s>
<s> What case do you have ? </s>
<s> Make and Model # How many case fans do you have ...at the case front, the case back ? </s>

<s> It Stopped freezing and its some 10 year old case I fished out of my basement. </s>
<s> Besides all I want to know is if it's possible for a Hard Drive to overheat and cause lock-ups. </s>
<s> Yes....definitely possible for the HDD as well as other components to overheat and cause the PC to lockup. </s>
<s> I thought you were interested in indentifying the cause and finding a way to eliminate the heat other than leaving the case open. </s>
<s> I plan on getting a new case and one of those hard drive cooling things to put in it. </s>
<s> I just needed to know if it was possible. </s>
<s> You won't need any special hard drive cooling if you buy a well designed case with good airflow over the hard disk drives. </s>
<s> With the case below which includes a 400 watt PS, I'd probably add a 120MM fan in the front which would ensure cool outside air coming in from the front over the hard drives. </s>

<s> As you revealed elsewhere... </s>
<s> Sorry but you've likely toasted your machine. </s>
<s> I thought I had good air flow but after a failure I decided to record the HDD temperature. </s>
<s> 49C (120F). </s>
<s> Way too hot. </s>
<s> Ended up installing a cooling fan and the temperature dropped to 33C. </s>
<s> I wrote an article about my experience. </s>
<s> See http://temperature.insmart.com/hddheat.html Can supply cheap temperature recorders if anyone needs one. </s>
<s> SpeedFan it is freeware. </s>
<s> http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php This will tell you what your temperatures are. </s>
<s> I'd advise that you not use the &quot;clock&quot; feature unless you know precisely what your doing. </s>
<s> Here are two hard drive cooler to consider should you need them. </s>
