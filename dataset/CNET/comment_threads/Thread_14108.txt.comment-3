I know it is the CPU because I had the GPU for a while before I upgraded the processor, And that's when the noise started.
I have checked the computer while it's running and it is defintely the CPU fan.
My computer is running plenty cool it is just the noise that bothers me, I would like to find a upgrade to my current fan/heatsink without filling up my case.
I have a fan at the front of the case and the rear of the case so I'm ok for case cooling, just want to find a comparable fan that will do the job while being silent under load.
I will check temps tomorrow it's too late to run that now.
Thanks for the website have been looking at that for a new fan.
