1.1.1	Ok heres the situation ... every time I go to rebuild my machine It fails out on copying files from any Windows Bootable CD ... ( Windows XP , 2000 , and LongHorn_Beta ) .	St

1.1.3	I 've swapped the HDD , and the CD 'S and I even took the HDD and CD and they installed fine on an older box I have .	St
1.1.4	Please I need any suggestion on what to do now.. Oh I have also reseated the memory IDE cables and changed CD-ROM drives .	St
1.1.5	The only thing I have n't done yet was reseat the CPU ...	St
1.1.6	I hate having to move those things .	St
1.1.7	The machine is also rather dusty..	St

1.2.1	My usual list : 1 .	St
1.2.2	BIG WHOPPING Power supply .	St
1.2.3	No mention of your complete machine parts list , but I often just pop in a 450 Watt PSU and try again .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	Set the FSB ( a BIOS setting ) from 266 to 200 or 133 to 100 MHz .	St
1.2.6	( Beats crashing and hair loss ) 3 .	St
1.2.7	Pull the case cover , point a fan at the internals .	St
1.2.8	4 .	St
1.2.9	Just one stick of ram .	St
1.2.10	Then try another stick .	Sug
1.2.11	Do n't NOT count that the ram works in another machine .	St
1.2.12	Needs to work in this machine .	St
1.2.13	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
1.3.1	Thanks alot Bob I 'm going to have to changes the Power supply..	St
1.3.2	I just bought a 300W and did n't think anything of it I 'll check the other settings thanks for your time .	St
1.3.3	Ray .	St
1.4.1	Try the other settings since it & quot ; lightens the load. & quot ; AMD 's tend to take big gulps of power and these tend to curb that appetite .	St
1.4.2	Can help in the pinch .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 'm looking at the motherboard now and I 'm going to look up the power specs online ...	St
1.5.2	I hope I can change the settings ...	St
1.5.3	Thanks again .	St
1.6.1	I like to add to what Robert suggested ...	St
1.6.2	If the problem crops up under 3-different OS installs , I would look at more memory ( check ram ) or yet another CD drive .	St
1.6.3	I *assume* the OS cds are legit and not copies which can introduce problems also .	St
1.6.4	-OR- you maybe better off doing a fresh install if you 're upgrading or reloading or trying a dual-mode install with win9x , etc.. Maybe , also the h/w just is too old as XP or even W2K become picky on that issue .	Sug
1.6.5	You just ca n't take anything for granted .	St
1.6.6	-- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	I had a similar problem ; it was the cpu overheating while installing 98se .	St
1.7.2	Make sure your cpu fan/heatsink is clean and running ; if it is very old , you might try a new fan/heatsink .	Res
1.7.3	Ken	St
1.8.1	That might be the problem I have an Athlon K7 1.2 gig chip on a K7SEM board ... and I took it all apart last night and the heatsink was mighty dirty ...	St
1.8.2	I removed the fan from the top and cleaned it out the best I could ...	St
1.8.3	I reseated the CPU and heatsink and cleaned the fan ... there is another fan in the box so air flow should n't be an issue .	St
1.8.4	I 'm going to go get my *legit* cd 's and try again I ca n't give up Oh and btw the memory chip is 512DDR pc 133 .	St
1.8.5	It should work fine It did in my other machine .	St
1.8.6	Thanks for the help .	St
1.9.1	The chip is rather new and unused ... 512DDR SDRAM ... PC 133. and the cd-rom was swapped I cleaned some dust out of the heat sink and fan and I 'm taking my perfectly legit CD 's and going to try again tonight wish me luck ! !	St
1.9.2	!	St
