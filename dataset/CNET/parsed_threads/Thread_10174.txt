<s> A friend running Windows XP has an HP Color Laserjet 1600 and she asked me to have a look at why it wasn't printing. </s>
<s> I clicked on the printer icon in the control panel which brought up the printer. </s>
<s> When I right clicked on the printer, it displayed the words 'paused - deleting'. </s>
<s> I un-paused the printer, the documents in her queue printed, and the printer disappeared. </s>
<s> I re-installed the printer but could never get anything to print. </s>
<s> The first item in the print queue would have a printing status of 'error-printing'. </s>
<s> Running the Windows troubleshooter yielded nothing. </s>
<s> I could not print a test page, print from DOS, etc.. </s>
<s> I then did a system restore to get her system back to a week ago. </s>
<s> The printer once again said paused - deleting, only the documents were the new documents I'd tried to print after the re-install. </s>
<s> I un-paused and the new documents printed. </s>
<s> And the printer again disappeared. </s>
<s> I can't seem to fix this. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> The heading on the Peripherals Forum declares that 'CNET's Forum on peripherals is the best source for finding help, troubleshooting, and getting buying advice from a community of experts. </s>
<s> Discussion topics include laser printers, inkjet printers, external hard drives, Webcams, monitors, keyboards, and mouse questions'. </s>
<s> I posted this question over a month ago and have had zero responses. </s>
<s> Is there something wrong with the way I phrased the question? </s>
<s> Our Computer Help has more readers. </s>
<s> My thought is the old stop and start the print spooler issue or fix. </s>
<s> I make no apologies for Microsoft leaving this unfixed and decline to dive into a dissertation about it. </s>
<s> So the short answer is that its still buggy. </s>
<s> You can improve it sometimes with the latest service pack and HP's drivers but even then, I'll have to open the command line up and stop the spooler, delete a few files and restart it. </s>
<s> In closing you may not know this so let me add the video driver is used to render some content. </s>
<s> This means we want the video driver to be current too. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
