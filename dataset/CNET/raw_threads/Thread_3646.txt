It readily IDs the HD and you need proceed to the support website and use that for any further details. Finding your similar posts for s/w help, the decal, etc., has always all that is needed. The only way it could differ if the vendor is somehow deceiving you but not the manufacturer. So other than that, the decal is good enough. tada -----Willy

You better care as the label IDs the product. using that SN# and since WD already says, they're not what is suppose to, then you have a case. You need to contact the vendor and address the issue. If you haven't already, stop any payment. If local, contact them. If not, then contact by whatever means in order to resolve this. If in fact this is something on the illegal nature you need to report it. besides contacting WD to help resolve the problem, that vendor has to be held accountable. Take notes, save paperwork, whatever in order to prove your case as now if you proceed it may become a legal matter if the vendor doesn't stand behind the product. As for WD, besides being contacted how or what they once you explain the matter would be a matter they may want to press. It's up to you as to how you proceed but i wouldn't become uncivil in this issue. tada ------Willy

I could wonder if it wasn't a &quot;refurb&quot; drive that had the controller board replaced as the SN and other drive parameters would be burned onto the board's circuitry. This being the case, you need to confront the seller with the information and see if they'll make this right. The other option...and if you got a very friendly price...is to keep it and live with it. Caveat emptor.

I ran into that with SDHC cards - smaller cards - label changed and the report back in the fat says higher mem and class. not so - some dont work at all or you just end up with a 1 to 4 g card. these were purch IN the usa with no mention of where from. only use reputable sellers for electronics !

Built three computers from buying parts I bought from them. I do not chose to use their name. They have refunded my money back into my account. I am not happy off what happened, and hope it does not happen again to me or some one else. To everybody just be carefull when you buy parts or anything online. Thank You For Your Help: Wendell
