I have a BENQ external cd-rw usb device and the notebook recognizes it as an USB Optical Storage. I tried it in a desktop and it does the same thing. I cant even install the driver because it does not found the device or because windows looks for a driver of a USB data storage. Thank you in advance

All others see such as drive as &quot;USB Optical Storage.&quot; To use the drive I add software such as you find at http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ Bob

Many are unaware of this and fall into a trap of &quot;it shouldn't be this way&quot; for some period of time. I'll wait for you to figure that out. In the meantime, if you want to create a CDR or CDRW disk, the software I noted is free to try out. Bob

It seems to me that the device does not communicate at all with the computer (it must be it since there is no driver for the cd-rw drive).

While I may wonder why you didn't write this in your first post, I now just ask you to ignore any reply up to this point and hope someone else sees a solution. To me the drive sounds dead or you have an USB 1.1 cable and it should an USB 2.0 cable. Bob

I hope it is just a cable problem. Thank you for your help.
