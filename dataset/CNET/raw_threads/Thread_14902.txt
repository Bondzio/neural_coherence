It happens at the same place everytime. it happens when the XP screen is on. It just seems like the power is instantly cut and it restarts. I tried reformatting my slave hard drive and using it, but the same thing happened when i loaded windows XP, and when i loaded windows 2000. when I loaded windows 2000, it worked until i shut down the computer and come back the next day, the same thing started happening again. I have been struggling with this for awhile, finally, yesterday i loaded windows 98, and it worked fine. however, after a few hours, my computer randomly just cut off power. It happened another time after that. Now, i loaded Windows 2000 on it again, in a different folder, it cut off two times when i was installing the setup. finally, when it was installed, it loaded fine and came to windows. i connected my master hard drive to it (my 40 gig) and tried to scan for viruses. it cut off twice while i was scanning. Over this weekend, this started happeneing to two other computers in my house as well. the same exact problem. we do not share files, but we are on a router which is connected to a cable modem. Could this be a boot sector virus? does anyone know which virus do something like this? I would like to clean the virus, but keep some of my important documents from my Master (40 gig) hard drive. Thank you for your replies Roops

Try two forums at first and move to others if you get no replies. At this point you are spamming the boards and its unclear if you will carry on 5 discussions. Bob
