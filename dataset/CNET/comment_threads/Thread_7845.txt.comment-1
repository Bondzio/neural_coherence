I'd like to transfer all my old VCR tapes and 8mm tapes to DVD.
I'm looking to buy a new computer that can handle all that video editing can do.
I'm looking at an HP Pavilion a6750y.
Phenom 2.3gz quad core processer, 8GB od RAM, 750 GB hard drive.
I'll be uploading with a Pinnacle Dazzle Recorder thru a USB.
Will this machine let me get the job done.
Any suggestions??
Trying to stay under $1000.00 Thanks bobmj14120
