<s> Hello All I was wondering if anyone has used one of these drives. </s>
<s> I have only seen 1 review for it so far. </s>
<s> I need some USB drives to backup important Word, Excel files and to backup the programs I download from the Internet for my Palm. </s>
<s> I am backing up programs, but I will not be running the programs from the USB drive. </s>
<s> Storage is all that I'm looking for. </s>
<s> I ask about this particular drive 'cause it's on sale at a good price. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help/advise Regards Fritzmom </s>
<s> The Lexar 8GB with the LCD was under 20 last week. </s>
<s> See http://www.target.com/Lexar-8GB-USB-Jump-Drive/dp/B0028OGI7A It's fast and cool. </s>

<s> I do agree that it is really convenient talking about the actual size. </s>
<s> But I was disappointed to find out that you can not reuse it when you try to delete old files from the USB and replace it with another file, a message will pop up that says you can not store anymore because there is no enough space. </s>
<s> when I checked the general preference the capacity showed USED: 7.69 GB on disk (7,685,210,112 bytes), where in fact the only data stored left is (Micro USB quick start up guide) only. </s>
<s> Unlike my other USB which is of course another brand, I can always delete old movie files and replace it with new ones. </s>
<s> But I will appreciate if anyone can tell me if there is a way to reuse the drive. </s>
<s> By the way I am using MAC. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> While you can storage on flash media, don't count on this as permanent storage, temporary at best. </s>
<s> Just too many issues arises and all the requests for help can't always be fixed. </s>
<s> You still need to store the most precious of your data to discs as a more safer place. </s>
<s> That doesn't mean you can't use flash drives, just don't don't store them there indefinitely. </s>
<s> As for flash drives sales, they come and go. </s>
<s> There will always be another one either at brick fronts or online stores on sale. </s>
<s> In my experience, I've used Toshiba and Kingston drives with good results. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, don;t fall for super cheap drive like A-Data, etc or any that seem to pop-up on sale often. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You should try emptying out your trash, because if you have put files in the trash from your drive they still take up space. </s>
<s> if that doesn't work you could maybe try and format your drive by going into applications&gt;utilities&gt;disk utility and formatting the device to Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) (or MS-DOS if you are transferring files between your mac and a windows computer). </s>
<s> Cheers, Sam </s>
