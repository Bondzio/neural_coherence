Tnx..new info: when i try to boot into anything, the pc hangs.
i'm not sure what it tries to do and fail but i suspect it needs to write to RAM and can't.
When booting from a Ubuntu CD, the GUI shows for a bit then it tries to fully boot into the system and it then goes to a flashing cursor and black screen hang.
W98 boot diskette, wxp install cd, dell utility cd....the bootup process either hangs or when I select a boot option the system reverts right back into POST like in a loop.
I've swapped mem modules...not sure what this could be.
