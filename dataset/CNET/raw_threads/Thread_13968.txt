And, boy, it's a chore adding other XP-compatible software to it. I guess HP does not want you to add your own collection of (Xp-compatible) software products to it. Since it will not recognize my Cakewalk Music Creator 2003 software, does anybody have a suggestion of another music-type creator software product that I can buy that will work with the HP n7060m? Thanks, R

Perhaps it is because of http://www.cakewalk.com/Support/DX9.ASP Check to see if you have Direct X 9. Type (in RUN) dxdiag then click Ok. Or, maybe Register and ask Cakewalk Support about that problem.

I can probably help you. Here is one suggestion on the cakewalk forum http://www.cakewalk.com/forum/tm.asp?m=430644 The thread is related to the version of Direct X that you have installed. For reference the 7060 comes with DX9 as is standard with Windows XP SP2 and Media Center 2005 (basicly Windows XP Pro with SP2. I would search Cakewalk's user support forum for help with their products.

I got Cakewalk Creator 2003 to load onto my HP m7060n system, however, the recording function does not work. When I try to record with a microphone - no sound is measured on the volume meter. I get a message that my computer's Realtek sound card is not compatible with Cakewalk Creator 2003 drivers. Am I sol? Is there a driver I can download from HP or Cakewalk? Very frustrating.
