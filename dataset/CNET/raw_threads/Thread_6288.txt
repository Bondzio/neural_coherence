Hello all, I have recently purchased an enclosure and hard drive. it was working fine for a good while. i formatted the drive into a logical FAT32 drive to back up my ps3 files. i then selected to use &quot;safely remove hardware&quot;. it said it was ok to remove. and now my PS3 nor computer recognizes it. not shown anywhere. the light comes on on the enclosure and i can hear the disks spinning but nothing. i replaced the hard drive just in case and still nothing. can anyone offer any suggestions to fix this? the I am using Vista 32 SP2. PS. i also tested this on different ports and did not work. this port works since it recognized my external mouse.
