Unknown gunmen abducted three Britons and a New Zealand citizen in Russia's breakaway Chechnya region after a shootout with their bodyguards, a regional official said Sunday.
A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
The British Embassy in Moscow has received no direct information about three Britons and a New Zealander kidnapped in breakaway Chechnya nearly two weeks ago, an embassy official said Wednesday.
Chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern Russia.
