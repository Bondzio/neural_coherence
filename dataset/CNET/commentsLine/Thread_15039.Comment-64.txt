formatting and possibly even anti-virus scans might not be enough.
if you have an mbr (master boot record) / bootkit / boot sector virus, the infection might still linger.
if you're concerned, you should repair or rebuild the mbr, or use a tool specifically to remove such viruses.
for options, just google &quot;how to remove an mbr virus&quot;.
