I have a four+ year old Dell desktop with a Geforce3 Ti 200 graphics card.
I want to upgrade to a card with more dedicated memory preparing for adding Vista later.
Don't play graphics intensive games.
Could anyone please confirm my old card is in an AGP slot?
2x/4x or 4x/8x???
Any recommendations for models,brands or store would be appreciated.
Thanks.
