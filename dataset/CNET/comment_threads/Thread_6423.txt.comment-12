The first one didn't download, I don't know why.
I'm thinking about replacing my mobo now, I wanna be able to get an x16 card.
It IS possible, I found that here http://forums.3dgamers.com/archive/index.php/t-12904 and then I was trying to find a mobo on newegg... otherwise, i was thinking I could just go with this one http://www.buy.com/prod/intel-d945gbo-desktop-board-pentium-d-celeron-d-pentium-4-intel-945g/q/loc/101/202166272.html That way I can have MORE expansion slots for RAM, it will still fit, and I can get an x16 card.
Do you think I could do it with little experience on taking that stuff out and installing a new one.
I've only opened up the computer to put something in the PCI slot... Is it better than my current one?...too many thought right now..
