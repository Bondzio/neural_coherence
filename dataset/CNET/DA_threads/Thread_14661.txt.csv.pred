1.1.2	i need a 2.6ghz for a game i wana play , would it equal out to atleast that ?	Ques
1.1.3	anyone know exactly what itd compare to single intel pentium ghz ?	Ques
1.1.4	thanx for any help lol .	Polite
1.2.1	It 's better to have a 2.33 Dual Core than it is to have just one 2.66 .	St
1.2.2	Dual core is able to process information because it has two ( obviously ) chips working , whereas the 2.66 is only one .	St
1.2.3	This way , with dual core , your system wont choke or anything when there 's too much info being processed .	St
