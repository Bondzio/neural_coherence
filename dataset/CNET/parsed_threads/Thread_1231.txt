<s> I had a few files (several GB) on my 1TB external HDD when it had virus; i.e when I opened the HDD on Windows Explorer, it showed I had no files, but when I clicked on &quot;Properties&quot;, the GB used were still there; or when I opened it with Winrar, the files were also there. </s>
<s> As those files were not important, I chose to format the HDD. </s>
<s> After either &quot;Quick format&quot; or Normal format, the HDD now shows there's no files, but still a 128MB used on the HDD. </s>
<s> What is this 128MB used, and how can I get rid of it? </s>
<s> I thought if they're some system files, it'll be just a few MB used? </s>
<s> Thanks, Ctmap </s>
<s> Creating a file system takes up space for the allocation table, recycle bin and other things even when empty. </s>
<s> Sort of like an empty file cabinet takes up space. </s>
