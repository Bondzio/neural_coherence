1.1.1	This happened before but somehow it actually fixed itself , ( how ?	Ques
1.1.2	i dont know ) but now its actually lasting longer than it previously has .	St
1.1.3	OK , so i turn on my computer and everthing looks as though its going smoothly , then while it is 'Detecting IDE Drives ' it takes a little longer than it usually does , then after that , this comes up : 'Primary Master : None Primary Slave : None Secondary Master : Toshiba DVD ROM SD-M1502 1008 Secondary Slave : _NEC NR-7700A ' Then it pops up saying 'Verifying DMI Pool Data ... .Update Success Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM : Failure ...	St
1.1.4	Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM : Failure ...	St
1.1.5	Disk Boot Failure , Insert System Disc ... ' Recently I installed windows XP , though im pretty sure this has nothing to do with the problem , any info you need i dont mind on telling you .	St
1.1.6	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Either the bios is flaky or the mtrbd .	St
1.2.2	itself .	St
1.2.3	I find this happens every now and then and really nothing seems to correct it .	St
1.2.4	If it happens often enough maybe I could pin-point but usually not .	St
1.2.5	I make sure the bios is the newest and installed , all cabling is proper or swap out with others .	St
1.2.6	Reseat any movable chips , etc .	St
1.2.7	and inspect for contacts on the rear of mtrbd .	St
1.2.8	that the mounts are n't shorting , usually no matter what it seems to work at least for the time being .	St
1.2.9	A reboot seems to correct the problem or at least a warm reboot does .	St
1.2.10	If it happens usually from a cold boot ( 1st time ) it maybe a cold solder joint .	St
1.2.11	Considering the problems it may cause , I install a new mtrbd .	St
1.2.12	and proceed on .	St
1.2.13	The same mtrbd .	St
1.2.14	installed in another case and the problem does n't come back , go figure .	St
1.2.15	Sometimes cleaning the ram slots with alcohol helps or the cable connectors on mtrbd .	St
1.2.16	Sorry , I 've seen this too often , other than above no fix .	St
1.2.17	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	If set to AUTO the system goes through the detection process each boot .	St
1.3.2	In the BIOS , try to detect each of the drives [ no time limit in this detection ] and enter those parameters in the BIOS rather than using AUTO .	St
1.3.3	See if that helps .	St
1.3.4	Probably use LBA on the right side of the entry .	St
1.3.5	Some time ago , I thought that I had read a post on on to extend thje toime that the boot allows to detect the drive before bowing out , but ca n't remember where .	St
