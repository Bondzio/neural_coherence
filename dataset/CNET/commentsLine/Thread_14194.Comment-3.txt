thanks for your response, bob.
i'm surprised and dismayed at the idea of downgrading the settings of the router.
kind of negates the advantage of getting the latest and the greatest equipment, which is why i bought this router, per the recommendations of the cnet editors.
wouldn't switching to wireless g compromise the increased range and speed of the newer n standard?
same with changing from the more secure wpa2 to the less secure wpa security?
