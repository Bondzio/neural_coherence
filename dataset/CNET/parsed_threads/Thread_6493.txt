<s> I have an emachine t6522, and it comes with a pci express slot. </s>
<s> i would like to put in the 6600gt but the power supply calls for a minimum of 350w and my emachine only has 300w. </s>
<s> i am wondering if putting one in would really drag my system, or if it would be fine. </s>
<s> i dont really want to upgrade my power supply right now so if its not possibel for the 6600gt what graphic cards would be the next best one that will be in the 300w power supply range. </s>
<s> thanx for you help, clay </s>
<s> Someone in this forum has done it without a problem. </s>
<s> If not, second best maybe 6600, 6200. </s>
