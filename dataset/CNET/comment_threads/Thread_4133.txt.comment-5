Let's bring this down to Earth fast.
There are sites like www.tomshardware.com that have benchmarks.
But what I've seen is that motherboards rarely cause a benchmark to move about.
Since you didn't define what would be better (benchmark, dollars or such), your question can't be answered.
Even moreso you didn't supply any possible boards for consideration.
Here's why this matters.
Some posters are in Aus, some in Britain and what's available where you are may not be some board I would point at.
In closing, if your board supplier won't talk to you about this, why are you doing business with them?
