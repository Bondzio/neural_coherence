&quot;he part where the IDE is being detected.
i mean the part wherein when you press DEL you can access bios configuration.
but if i disconnect the maxtor hard disk again, everything comes to normal.&quot;... All that means is that something is wrong with the drive.
If it's worth saving, get a quote from drivesavers.com or ontrack.com Not to bother you but why is what you can't lose only on hard disks?
