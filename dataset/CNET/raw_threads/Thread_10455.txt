The signal strength is excellent but it appears it cannot find my IP Address. Everything was working fine and this just started.

Should be in the region 192.168.0.1 -- if very different look type ipconfig /? and try using the /renew and /release options. I think you can usually achieve the same by restarting the computer but this is quicker. Though your adapter may be showing a good signal, this kind of error can be caused by reception issues. If it persists, test all wireless channels for speed and reliability and select a new own -- preferable at least 5 stops from strongest neighbouring wifi network.

In normal cases, the IP-address isn't found, but assigned by the router, so the laptop doesn't search for it, but gets it in a message. A possible cause: password doesn't match. Resetting the router (turn off, wait a minute, turn on) might help also. That's the first thing to try. Kees
