Hello everyone, I'm in the process of configuring my first custom build.
This system will be used for 3d graphics.
I hope to configure a system that will be able to be upgraded with newer parts as prices fall in the future.
I can't justify spending more than $1100.
Can you computer gurus out there have a quick look and let me know if I am mismatching.
OR, if you have any suggestions, I am more than happy and greatful to know what you think.
Thanks allot guys!
