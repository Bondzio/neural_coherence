When I turned on my computer this afternoon, it had an abnormal buzzing sound coming from it that did not go away.
I had it on for an hour to hour and a half and it buzzed the whole time, so I turned off and used my laptop, and when I went to pull a couple files off the computer it still buzzed the half an hour it was on that time.
It did the noise a few weeks ago but it stopped after half an hour that time and hasn't done it since.
When I searched the internet for possiblities to the noise, one thing I kept seeing was that it could be a failing power supply.
Could that be it?
My computer is a 5 year old IBM, store bought, with only the hard drive and network card being update in that time.
How would I be able to check to see if the power supply is failing?
Or are there any other suggestions of things to check.
Would it be safe to use it for short periods of time (like half an hour here and there) in order to burn some files, if I find it is the power supply, until I can get a new one?
