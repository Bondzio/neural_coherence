I have several internal HDs that are &quot;dead.
The oldest one might be about 8 years old.
There is nothing on them that I need, but I would like to see if there is anything that I might want.
(previous versions of drafts, unedited copies of older photos etc).
What are the chances of me being able to physically take the actual disk out and putting it into a working HD?
