Thanks for the clarification.
It's just I used DVI with the Last two Macs I had and I don't want to go back to VGA connection ever again.
I never seen or heard of a HDMI on a PC or a Mac before and it raised some doubt after hearing and only seeing HDMI only in TV related products.
Again thank you.
