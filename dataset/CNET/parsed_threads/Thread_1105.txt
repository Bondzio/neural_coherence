<s> Hey there everyone! </s>
<s> My wife and I recently moved from the U.S. to France and are now looking to get a multifunction printer/scanner to assist us with out work. </s>
<s> Since we are only here for two-years, we were hoping to get one that has a Universal Power Supply, so that we can bring it back to the States with us. </s>
<s> Sadly, I may be using the wrong search criteria on the internet, since I cannot find any info on these. </s>
<s> Or, maybe they just don't exist. </s>
<s> Any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> I looked at our hp c4780 all in one and the AC adapter shows 100 to 240VAC and 50/60 Hz. </s>
<s> From what I know that is universal (actually terrestrial Earth) so you may only need to look at the AC adapters and not the printers. </s>

<s> You can purchase universal conversion kits, most box stores have them, you shouldn't have to worry about swapping out the power inverter. </s>
