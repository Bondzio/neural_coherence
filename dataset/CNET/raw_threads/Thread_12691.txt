I read your post twice and found so little about the desktop that I can't comment except that the virtual iso games are quite the tip off that something isn't quite legit. Bob

Is this version of Win 8 a legitimate copy or is this os an install from a torrent? What AV are you running ?Getting info here is like pulling teeth, the op doesn't wanna give any up .

Install SP1, installl all updates, install antivirus and only install trusted applications. If you still get BSOD's it's a hardware issue. If everything is fine and you install other software and troubles begin, you know where to search for the cause. And maybe even everything stays fine. Kees
