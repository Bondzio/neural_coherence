So I can get rid of unnecessary files. The reason for the restore is an error message that I get EVERY time I reboot my laptop that requires me to put the Windows disk in the CD Drive which came with the laptop which I bought brand new. I'm hoping to eliminate this error message and &quot;spring clean&quot; my computer's hard drive.

It is time to backup what files you can't lose then restore the machine with the restore dvds you made when the machine was new. Bob

So I need to delete the files I don't want before the &quot;all or nothing&quot; backup, then backup the laptop hard drive, then do my &quot;restore to original state procedure&quot;, then sync the external hard drive with the laptop and put all my &quot;keeper&quot; files back on the laptop hard drive? Is that correct??

The failure you note is not uncommon but any full copy would have the same problem when you restore from it. So that plan is flawed. What works well is to copy our files out to 2 or more places then use the restore media. I then reinstall my basic applications and copy my files back in. Bob
