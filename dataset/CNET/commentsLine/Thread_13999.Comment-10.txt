knowing all parts other than the cpu had been tested and ok, and absolutely no beeps, ever, i pulled the cpu again and put it under the big magnifying glass.
let me say i hate these am2 and 939 pin processors, too many pins in too small a space and too thin.
it makes you appreciate the socket a cpu's much better.
two pins were bent on the cpu, one near the marked corner a row back both ways and one on the exact opposite corner.
those pins are so close and so small i could barely see them even with my reading glasses and looking through the glass, but did manage to try some different size safety pins till i found one that would fit exactly between the pins width and was able to &quot;comb&quot; the 2 bent pins back up fairly decent.
it was enough to get them all into the socket ok with some very gentle wiggle action.
did the post and boot up fine now to my thumbdrive, even with both sticks of the kingston hyperx memory installed (2 g's total).
even with a magnifier i almost didn't see that second pin that was bent, and the first worst bent one wasn't that easy to find either.
that's after sighting down the rows from both sides, and it was the wrong glint of light that helped me find it.
i don't know if i bent them the first install, or if it was damaged in shipping.
at least it's done and i can move on from it.
