1.2.1	Gpu .	St
1.2.2	You might want to look at the Hd 7870 .	St

1.3.1	I 'm really interested in CUDA tech but not completely married to it .	St
1.3.2	The only other thing that gives me trepidation on the 7870 are the user comments about it not being recognized by the mobo .	St
1.3.3	This is my first build so I am kind of nervous about the assembly stage .	St
