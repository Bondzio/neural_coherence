My numbers are as follows: To Modem To Internet Max Allowed Speed (kbps) 1984 512 SN Margin (dB) 11.0 16.0 Line Attenuation (dB) 51.0 31.0 Loss of signal 0 68 Loss of frame 0 0 CRC Errors 735 3 I am currently on a temporary cap to allow my connection to stabilize. My normal max throughput would be 3008/512 The ATT techs have been out five times now. They have replaced several things downstairs. They have also done some work at the box, and in the &quot;pit&quot; as they said. They also did something called a port cut. They believed the problem was in my building wiring, but I have ruled that out using a 100 foot RJ14 twisted pair cable I bought from radio shack, which I ran directly from the box to my dsl modem. I was still getting hundreds of CRC errors every five minutes or so. When my line is stable, which happens intermittently my max ATTN DR is usually in the 4500 - 4800 range, which should give me enough bandwidth to run my 3008 with no issues. I have never seen any problems on the Tx side of it. Just Rx. Ideas to try?

It might have been better that you denied you a connection? 3 miles is 15840 feet so it's not much to say there is 3 miles of trouble to look at. Shame really. But it's time to bail out of that service for another. Bob
