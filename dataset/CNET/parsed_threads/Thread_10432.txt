<s> if i have a 1.83 core duo how much ram would i need to get the most out of my prosser? </s>
<s> What are you doing with the machine and which operating system will it use are just a couple of the factors in this as it could be anywhere from 512 MB to 4 GB for most situations though there may be some exceptions if you want to try to run something really fancy schmancy. </s>
<s> it's sufficient for everything unless you do big photoshop files. </s>
<s> Dual core is a 32/64. </s>
<s> Either you will get more from a 32 bit environment or more stability from a 64 bit environment. </s>
<s> Ram depends on the number of processes (programs and calls) running at the same time. </s>
<s> This depends on OS Choice (Windows takes up more, Sun OS takes up a lot of ram but delivers the goods, Linux has user defined processes, except sys and root, BSD uses less process, and plan9 uses the least. </s>
<s> Mac is a bsd type system) The kernel for each automatically loads the necessary drivers. </s>
<s> Are you running an audio video setup? </s>
<s> with heavy equipment? </s>
<s> A stereo? </s>
<s> Multiple or 3+ tier cd burner/ dvd burner racks? </s>
<s> Then you need more ram. </s>
<s> RAM which is purchased because some says it is good and not for system performance is the same as buying snow chains while living in florida. </s>
<s> It makes no sense. </s>
<s> Go back, make a list of what you are running and the amount of ram necessay for each process. </s>
<s> Add that up and add 128M for safety/overflow measures. </s>
<s> That should be your answer. </s>
