1.1.1	Design Macs running OSX 10.4.11 Windows Server 2003 A few months ago we changed from AFP to SMB to connect to our Windows 2003 fileserver as we were using SFM on the Windows Server and experiencing frequent disconnections and spinning beachballs when browsing folder with lots of content etc.	St
1.1.2	Since switching to SMB the previous speed issues when broswing large directories in list view no longer occur and the frequent disconnections no longer occur either.	St
1.1.3	However, once a week, the designers get a message pop up saying the server connection has been interrupted and then the server share unmounts and then InDesign crashes if the doc has been opened from the server.	St
1.1.4	All the connected designers see this message at the same time so it would appear to be a message/alert generated from the server itself to its connected clients.	St
1.1.5	Anyone else seen this problem ?	Ques
1.1.6	Many thank in advance.	Polite
1.2.1	Windows 2003 server has support lines for such troubles if your IT staff needs a hand but sorry, no I didn't see that problem here but our setup is very plain.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
