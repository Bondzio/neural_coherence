the diagnostics are not good enough.
i won't write much about the ubuntu memory test but from memory it runs forever because memory is only good when in use and you have issues like temperature, power stability and more that means a test has to run forever while you may want it to run once and point out the issue.
as it stands i can't say it's a ram issue.
it could be that adding more ram taxed the power supply a little more, blocked some air flow or that ram is used for video display and isn't quite compatible.
try this.
exchange the 2 sticks.
that is take the one in slot one and place in slot two and the one in slot two to slot one.
no.
i can't cure the industry.
