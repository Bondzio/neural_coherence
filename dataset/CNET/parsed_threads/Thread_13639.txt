<s> Hi, I have a HP Photosmart C5180 printer, and a few weeks ago it started having issues. </s>
<s> It wouldn't print at first, so we would turn it off and then back on, and then it would print. </s>
<s> Then after a few days, that quick fix didn't work and it wouldn't print at all. </s>
<s> I tried the suggestions from the troubleshooting manual - disconnect from pc, power, etc., then reconnect again, and that didn't work. </s>
<s> I removed it from the pc and just plugged it in separately to a different outlet to see if it would work on it's own, and it doesn't. </s>
<s> I have to remove the power cord entirely to turn it off. </s>
<s> When I leave it plugged in, the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success, then shuts down for a couple seconds, then tries to turn on again. </s>
<s> I would try a different power adapter/cord, but it's not a traditional cord that I can just use a spare one to connect to the printer. </s>
<s> It would cost more to service this printer than it's worth, so I just wanted to check here and see if anyone had similar issues or know of a fix. </s>
<s> Thanks for any feedback! </s>
<s> You are left to YOUR CHOICE HERE. </s>
<s> There is no service manual and I've found service, even a DIAGNOSTIC to exceed the price of a new printer. </s>
<s> Some seem upset at that but would we rather pay more for a printer and service? </s>
<s> (If so, there are better printers which can be fixed when broken.) </s>

<s> You didn't mention the operating system that you are using. </s>
<s> Did you uninstall and reinstall the software? </s>
<s> If you are using Vista or 7, with the C5180 you may have to upgrade the software from Hp's web site. </s>
<s> It may be bad harware (internal printer issue) as Bob said but it could also be a software problem related to the printer/OS. </s>
<s> Check software before you scrap the unit, C5180 was fairly decent. </s>
<s> i know this post is old but my brother and i have the same printers and bought them at the same time. </s>
<s> he is having the exact same problem as described above we switched printer sand mine is working on his computer. </s>
<s> i searched alot of forums but no one has an answer. </s>
<s> do you ??? </s>
<s> this is what it is doing the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success, then shuts down for a couple seconds, then tries to turn on again. </s>
<s> i cannot even estabish a computer connection as well. </s>
<s> the display screen shows hp logo with the load bar trying to load and then it freezes then tries to restart again. </s>
<s> i check and did all the obvious here to troubleshoot but no prevail. </s>
<s> should i take it to best buy geeks </s>
<s> My answer is that there are no service manuals for these products. </s>
<s> I see a few for sale at 10 to 20 dollars at http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000GWMJVA/ref=dp_olp_used_mbc?ie=UTF8&amp;storeAttribute=e&amp;submit.see-all-buying-options=see-all-buying-options&amp;condition=used While service and repair is possible, the cost to do so is more than a new or used printer. </s>
