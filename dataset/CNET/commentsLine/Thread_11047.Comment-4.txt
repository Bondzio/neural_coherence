thanks for the link to the forum sticky.
i have the second router set up as a wap and the signal strength/reception is great.
my only remaining question is about security.
it appears that the wireless from wap is simply creating a second network that is independent of the wired network downstairs.
although i gave the wap the same ssid as my wired network, this signal is unsecured.
do i assign a different encrption for the wap and the laptops that use the signal, or is there a way to integrate it into the security of the &quot;original&quot; network ssid?
thanks for your help.
