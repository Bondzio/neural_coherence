hi bob, i didnt really understand what youre trying to say in your first point, and for the thought that for bigger lines a bigger tablet is needed, that is not true.
wacom tablets (most graphics tablets for that matter) run in 'absolute' mode, meaning the active area of the tablet represents the whole screen.
this means that i can draw the same size line whether or not i have a small, medium or large tablet.
i can't afford the cintiq with the massive price tag just yet, and i don't know if i will enjoy using the tablet anyways, so im not spending over 1,000 for a tablet that i might use for 2 months, and then leave it alone.
sorry to be difficult, - hellz
