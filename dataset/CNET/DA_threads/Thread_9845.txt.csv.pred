1.1.1	When attempting to burn a new CD-R (on ROXIO), it always stops in the middle of the transaction...what could be causing this and is it fixable?	St
1.1.2	How can I test the drive to find the problem?	St
1.1.3	I've tried cleaning the drive by using a disk lens cleaner but to no avail.	St
1.2.1	Is to try another drive.	Sug
1.2.2	The problem is the drives cost so little (free to 40?)	St
1.2.3	that there are no machines or diagnostic software worth trying as the tech time and charges means we head straight to replacement.	St
1.2.4	HOWEVER Roxio's video creation is known to fail like you wrote and the drive recording features still work fine.	St
1.2.5	Only you could reveal more details to see if this is the usual video creation failure.	Sug
1.2.6	If it is, try DVD FLICK next (see google.com) Bob	St
