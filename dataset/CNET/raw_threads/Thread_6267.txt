Is there something &quot;out there&quot; that can combine both DIMMS into one DIMM slot so that I can add the additional 1GB I want into the other DIMM slot? By the way, my memory is the PC2100 kind.

Your RAM speed tells me that the machine is an older model. If your setup will support it, then it's purchase time. A 1 Gig stick and a 512 stick. But I've also found that anything over a Gig is major overkill.
