What a bummer, Mr. Moderator.
So what's the answer?
Vacationing last week in Hawaii, there were &quot;hot spots&quot; in most of the local coffee houses that would give you a password for about $10 per day.
Being the cheapskates that we are, we opted for dial-up access (56k), which felt like reverting back to the 50's because it was so slow.
But I've heard of &quot;access&quot; thru your cellular phone, also &quot;satellite&quot; service (for the mobile computer-guy).
What's the story?
Are there any holy grails out there that are functional?
