ok, those are two of the best cards around.
i personally have a geforce 9800 512 mb and it runs great, i play codwaw, simcity socitites, age of empires iii, and many other graphic heavy games and i can run all my games on max quality with no lag.
(mind you that i custom build my machine and i run 64 bit windows 7 rc) however i think that the geforce 9500 1 gb card might be better because it has more dedicated graphics memory, and it should be able to play games for many more years to come.
