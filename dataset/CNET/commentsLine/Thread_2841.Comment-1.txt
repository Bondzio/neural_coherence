i recently bought a dell computer with a cd/dvd rom.
the rom is a dounble layer burner.
i haven't had any complaints with burning, it does dvds at 16x, but i am unhappy with it's read speed.
it seems when i play computer games the rom just doesn't read the cd fast enough.
i have a second open bay that will fit another rom drive.
should i look into getting a faster cd-rom drive, and use that for gaming and copying cds?
if so any suggestions on the brand?
