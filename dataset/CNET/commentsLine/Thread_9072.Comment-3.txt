i checked my physical memory, and increased it.
does it matter which drive the physical memory is on?
i honestly tried putting physical memory on all drives ( i dont even know what that does...) the cpu is not constantly at 100, it just gets jammed up it seems.
if i try to do things at once, the comp slows down considerably...
