<s> Also is there an adaptor that would allow me to connect. </s>
<s> I've been looking at the linksys wusb11. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> What's the distance between computers. </s>
<s> ?With no interference at all you should be fine up to a max.of 300 feet.If you have interference it could drop dramatically to 50 to 100 feet.If you go with Linksys which is a good choice you also can use wireless reapeter. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
