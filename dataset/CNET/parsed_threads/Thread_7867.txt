<s> Is there a powerfull enought anteana on the market that can send a 360* signal for a distance of 10-40 miles? </s>
<s> That was asked a bit ago. </s>
<s> The problem is you need more Watts plus that antenna. </s>
<s> Remember that an antenna does not add power to the signals. </s>
<s> If can pick up more and be more efficient (less loss), but adds no power. </s>
<s> A short discussion elsewhere found the power required at about 20 miles to be about 500 Watts for 360 coverage. </s>
<s> This is just one reason why a cellular type approach works. </s>
<s> Your answer is a simple no. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> &quot;Think power. </s>
<s> Remember that 2.4GBz is that same frequency range as your Microwave oven. </s>
<s> Now a little issue of how to double the coverage of a Radio signal. </s>
<s> You need 4 times the power for each doubling of the distance. </s>
<s> Starting at only 200 milliwatts for your best WiFi Wireless Access Point (WAP) as a baseline, we can figure what it takes to reach out to you at 100 miles away. </s>
<s> Let's peg that full speed 802.11a at 11 megabits to work super at 41.25 feet and see what Watts we need at 1 mile? </s>
<s> OK BPBASIC Ready&gt; 64000 Bytes free 41.25 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 5280 feet. </s>
<s> 0.2W * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 25.6 Watts End BPBASIC Now if we want to go from 1 mile to 20 miles we just keep going. </s>
<s> 2 miles = 51.2 Watts 4 miles = 102.4 Watts 8 miles = 204.8 Watts 16 miles = 409.6 Watts 32 miles = 819.2 Watts Yes, we have about the power of your average household Microwave oven at 20 miles. </s>
<s> Not only do we need this much power in the WAP, but about that much in you lap PC-Card. </s>
<s> Looks like WiFi in your card will have some problems. </s>
<s> Bob&quot; --------- In addition -------- Numerous other issues creep in such as a reflection off some mountain will duplicate the signal, but slightly out of phase and effectively scramble your reception. </s>
<s> All the same issues that cell phone network builders become lots of fun. </s>
<s> --------- The bottom line ----- You won't be doing this. </s>
<s> The band in question is shared by all. </s>
<s> You would be wiping all others off the airspace and someone would be hunting you down. </s>

<s> Point to point, etc.. From Google in case I was unclear... Definitions of Line of Sight on the Web: The line of sight is the line that connects the observer's eye with the thing the observer is looking at. </s>
<s> This expression is often used with measurements of doppler velocity and magnetic field in magnetograms, where only that part is measured that is directed along the line of sight. </s>
<s> To know the complete velocity or magnetic field, the components that are at right angles to the line of sight must also be measured. </s>
<s> Such components may be called the field-of-view components, though this expression is not commonly used. </s>
