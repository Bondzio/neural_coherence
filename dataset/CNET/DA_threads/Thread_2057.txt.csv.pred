1.1.1	Hi there , I have an old monitor that I have had for a good few years now , and since I got it , it has had an issue where if you knock the desk it is sat on slightly the screen goes blank and I need to unplug the mains and insert it again .	St
1.1.2	This issue started to get better years ago and since then has been unplugged for a couple of years , I want to start using it again as I am now restoring old computers as part of a course I am doing in PC repair and upgrading .	St
1.1.3	Due to the lack of monitors available as I am using my newer monitor on my current PC to read the book , I wondered if any one could give me any ideas what could be wrong .	St
1.1.4	I unfortunately have no idea what to try to fix the issue as an old friend of mine who was good with computers has had a look and could n't suggest anything either .	St
1.1.5	The monitor is an Videoseven L19PS TC099 Any ideas are welcomed as I have received some great advice from you in the past .	St
1.1.6	Thank you everyone Kindest Regards Paul	St
1.2.1	If a sudden jar , however so light , causes the display to fail , or come on , there is a loose connection .	St
1.2.2	It could be in the power supply , the video driver , or a cable/wiring .	St
1.2.3	Unless you are competent in troubleshooting using a wiring diagram and a digital meter , it 's best to either replace the monitor or take it to a qualified electronics repair shop .	St
1.2.4	If you do the latter you can probably buy a new monitor for the cost of repairs .	St
1.2.5	Since LCD monitors are more computer than video device , I 'd recommend replacing it .	St
