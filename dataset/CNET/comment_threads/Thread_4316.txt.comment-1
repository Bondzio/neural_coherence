I've just purchased an Intel D865 GLCLK mobo and want to fit it with some good quality DDR.
I have looked at the Geil Golden Dragon and was quite impressed but I would like something to compare it to before I make a decision.
The board has four DIMM sockets and supports the following memory features: 2.6 V (only) 184-pin DDR SDRAM DIMMs with gold-plated contacts Unbuffered, single-sided or double-sided DIMMs with the following restriction: Double-sided DIMMs with x16 organization are not supported 4 GB maximum total system memory Minimum total system memory: 64 MB Non-ECC DIMMs Serial Presence Detect DDR400, DDR333, and DDR266 SDRAM DIMMs
