My needs were basic; all I wanted to do was serve MP3 files to my Sonos streaming music system. Problem was, only after I bought the drive did I find out about it's record of unreliability, and sure enough after 6 months it started to play up. A few tips off the web plus a few hours talking to Maxtor did get it up and running, but I still didn't trust it so backed up my crucial files to DVD. That proved wise; almost the day it went out of warranty it's failed completely, so now I'm in the market another solution. My needs have changed slightly though... - Serve content to my Sonos as before (I only have a measly 15gb of music right now, though); - Provide a reliable backup solution for the two laptops my partner and I use (I think that means I need RAID 1 config, correct?); - In future, serve HD video content to my main TV. The backup piece is probably the most important thing for me now - I've just bought a new digital SLR and have a baby on the way, so I need to be able to backup my files safely, reliably and with the minimum of fuss. Speed is not so crucial - as long as it can keep up with pushing 720p content down a wired link to the TV, that should be good enough. I've taken a look online, but have become rather confused by the options on offer. What would people suggest? I have up to 300 to spend on the right solution. I'm a technology lover, but not a techie - I'm not against buying a NAS cage and installing drives if that's the most reliable option, but I don't want to spend hour after frustrating hour setting it up only to get unreliable performance. As a result I like the look of the Buffalo Linkstation Pro Duo, but don't know much about it - are the drives possible to replace if one fails? Any suggestions would be much appreciated - frankly I'm surprised at how few of the consumer targetted NAS solutions get a good writeup! Thanks in advance, Matt
