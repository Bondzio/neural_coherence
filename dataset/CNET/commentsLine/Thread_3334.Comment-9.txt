read it for yourself.
read up on the hamachi security at:  it encrypts all your messages.
it would be hard for another system to intercept the messages and be able to decrypt them.
logmein has many different products of which hamachi is just one of them.
check them out.
you can try out their products and see how they work.
if you have two computers that has internet access, install hamachi on both, set the accounts and see what it can do for you.
i'm here in the west, and i used the free hamachi to control my daughters computer who is in missouri.
