1.1.1	Can a bigger size hard drive , e.g.-2tb 16mb cache , & cache make an operating system , e.g.-windows xp , boot-up & multi-task faster ?	Ques
1.1.2	In-other words , make a system 's O.S .	St
1.1.3	more efficiently faster ?	Ques
1.1.4	What other specs make a h.d .	St
1.1.5	faster ?	Ques
1.2.1	Theoretically , more cache and higher speed of rotation improve HD performance .	St
1.2.2	SATA 3 is common and SATA 6 is just out .	St
1.2.3	It should provide some improvements over SATA 3 .	St
1.2.4	SCSI seems to still take the prize with platter type devices .	St
1.2.5	Solid state HDs did n't offer much ( if any ) improvement over platter types initially but are gaining ground .	St
1.2.6	All I know is what I read and all I told is only what I 've read so take it with a grain of salt .	St
1.3.1	SEEK TIME is often in the several MILLISECOND range which is an eternity in computer time .	St
1.3.2	Compare a 5 millisecond seek to the 6 millisecond seek and you soon discover that buffers pale in comparison to payback .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	You might want to scan the drive for errors , defragment it , move most used programs to the inner tracks and see if the manufacturer has any utilities such as ones that lengthen the timeout , etc .	St
1.4.2	FiOS-Dave	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	How the heck do you do that ?	Ques
1.6.2	I had no idea you can control where a program is placed on the HDD !	St
1.7.1	In terms of pure speed , it 's my belief that a smaller drive , with high rotational speed , a large cache and high seek times would suit your purpose .	St
1.7.2	Put simply , the less there is to look through the faster you accomplish the find .	St
1.7.3	With the rotational speed and low seek times once you 've looked up what you want the quicker that happens .	St
1.7.4	Overall though , a small ( 60GB ish ) solid state disk is the speediest option .	St
1.7.5	Apart from the most specialised HDD none beat them as they operate at almost teh speed of memory .	St
1.7.6	HTH	St
1.8.1	sorry , meant to say LOW seek times !	Polite
