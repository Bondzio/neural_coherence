1.1.1	I 've been having an issue with my computer lately , it started out happening very little , now its happening basically each time I start , and wake up from sleep mode on my computer .	St
1.1.2	Here 's the issue , if I put my computer in sleep mode , it wakes up , the fans come on , but there 's no display on the monitor , I have to hold the power button down and reboot .	St
1.1.3	The computer does n't have any display after I reboot .	St
1.1.4	I have to keep rebooting the machine , like 20 times to get it to work.. Any idea on what the problem is ?	Ques
1.1.5	I 'm thinking it 's the video card , or maybe the motherboard .	St
1.1.6	Sometimes the screen flashes black , and a message pops up saying & quot ; Video card driver stopped responding , but recovered. & quot ; , or something like that , also , the computer freezes at times , and the same thing happens with no display .	St
1.1.7	Oh , and sometimes when this happens , there 's no beeps when attempting to start the machine .	St
1.1.8	Thanks Oh , and here 's the specs .	St
1.1.9	Sparkle 9600 GT 2gb 4Gb 's Ram Phenom 9950 quad-core Asus M3N72-D Motherboard Windows Vista 64 Bit	St
1.2.1	Are you sure its in sleep mode ?	Ques
1.2.2	or hibernate ?	Ques
1.2.3	when i had this problem with my dv2213cl the support agent told me it was caused by a boot issue , it just would not boot out of hibernate or sleep long story short i had to send the computer to be serviced and they ended up missing the commitment date and i had to end up calling them only to be told that they found nothing wrong with the computer ( but that they were working to fix the problem ) well it came back with something that did not need to be fixed and the problem still was the same i had to end up re imaging the hard disk to make it work again to sum it up i was out of a computer for little over a month since it was being fixed by support.. good luck ..	St
1.3.1	I 'm having the same problem , except I do n't use sleep mode , it 's just when I boot it up .	St
1.3.2	I 've found out a few things about it : one , if I reseat everything it stops having the issue , but that 's temporary and it will soon start doing it again more frequently , and two , when I kick it right after I boot it it has a better chance of starting up , but I really do n't like doing that because it 's potentially harmful to the hardware .	St
1.3.3	Even so , this tells me something is seated incorrectly or loosely , but if that 's the case I ca n't figure out what it is because I 've gone through every connection on the board , a few times each , and they all seem to be fine .	St
1.3.4	I ca n't send it to be repaired because it 's a custom , but right now I 'm pretty stumped and I ca n't find any help , and this is the first thread I 've come across which has the problem I 'm having .	St
1.3.5	Please , if anyone knows how to fix this , share .	St
1.3.6	Thank you .	St
1.4.1	@ nancy Oh I forgot to say , I reimaged the harddisk a few times , it 's not helping .	St
1.5.1	I found out a few things today , I have a few IM programs that auto start when windows boots , I had my friend see if I signed onto the the instant messenger , to see If my computer even made it to windows , and he said I logged on , so obviously windows is booting .	St
1.5.2	I 'm guessing this is a problem with the graphics card..	St
