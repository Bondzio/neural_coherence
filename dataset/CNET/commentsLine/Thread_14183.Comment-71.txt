your story parallels mine so much it was a little shocking.
the ibm 360 came out when i was working in the ...pentagon for western union.
i was a maintenance tech then.
we had sds, scientific data systems, computers.
their claim to fame was it was the first computer to use silicone transistors and heated memory which made them very stable if not fast.
as i recall the hard disk drives looked like two pie pans bolted together with an unbelievable 1 meg of storage.
that was in the late sixties.
sds also was the moniker for the students for a democratic society to follow my university days.
i think american needs to reactivate them.
could it be that 1984 has now arrived?
my osborne was the blue case.
my original drives were 180 double sided.
the originals were 90k.
those were the days.. newkiwi
