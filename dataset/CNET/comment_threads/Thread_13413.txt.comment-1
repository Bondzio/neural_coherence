I just replaced my dead hard drive after nasty virus killed it and treated my self to a new ATX case after swapping everything over and following the motherboard manual for the right connection placement I plugged in the power and waited for the my facny new blue neon lit case to tell me my pc has burst into life but nothing not even a pop bang or fizzle!
My mother board is an ASUS A7A266 and the new tower a novatech panacea I have double checked the placement of the reset swith and power switch connectors etc but nothing I even removed the battery for 2 minutes still nothing, when I switch the power back on and press the power button the fan twitches and that is it the only sign of life is the green neon on the motherboard.
Can any 1 think of any thing I may have overlooked or does it sound like my mother board has expired aswell??
Any help will be greatly appreciated!
