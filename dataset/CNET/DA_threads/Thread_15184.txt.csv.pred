1.1.1	Hi , I 've been looking to get myself a convertible Windows 8 Tablet , but struggling to settle on one .	St
1.1.2	Ideally it would have good sound , USB ports and large memory ( and able to handle being connected to a 1tb external HDD ) I was swaying towards the Lenovo IdeaTab Lynx , but this is not out in the UK yet and wont be for some time yet and I 'm not quite sure it would do all I need .	St
1.1.3	Does anyone have any advice or recommendations ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks , Steven .	St
1.2.1	I would not consider any laptop/tablet to have good sound .	St
1.2.2	That 's usually reserved for your receiver and speaker systems .	St
1.2.3	There are very few convertibles today as you have discovered .	St

1.3.1	yeah , sound is not the be all and end all for me , was meaning more a case of being at a reasonable level as my current netbook is very very quiet .	St
1.4.1	It takes a while for more selections to appear .	St
1.4.2	HOWEVER , because of what Microsoft did with the slate other makers decided to not roll out their designs .	St
1.4.3	Given the high price of that with the usual keyboard I do n't see the attraction .	St
