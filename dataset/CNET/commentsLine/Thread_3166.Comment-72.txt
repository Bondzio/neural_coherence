backup on dvd and get a new big external hd to copy your files to and then unplug it (power cord and usb/firewire/esata) and only use it to copy your files to when you add more to your &quot;everyday&quot; external hd!!
anything that has moving parts--such as a disk-- will fail after a lot of use, or just time.
