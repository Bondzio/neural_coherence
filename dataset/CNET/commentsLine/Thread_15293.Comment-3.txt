sata is the means by which the hard drive connects to the computer.
raid (redundant array of independant disks) was originally a security backup device using multiple identical hard drives.
if one failed, all the data was still on one of the other drives.
raid 0 changes this a bit however.
it takes 2 drives and creates a single drive.
not unlike dual-channel memory.
it nearly double the rate that data can be both read and written.
it requires a special controller that is either built into the motherboard, or can come as a seperate controller card.
