i thinking of buying a external hd and i was wondering if i should wait until usb 3.0 comes out in 2010, or the next version of firewire (s3200).
i was looking for a (or at least) 1 tb external hd with usb 2.0, firewire 400 and 800. the seagate freeagent mac seems perfect, and is priced over $200.
considering both my computers have firewire 800 capabilities... but with the next gen hardware coming out, what would you do?
do you think usb 3 hds will be available instantly after the release and would hd pricing go up?
