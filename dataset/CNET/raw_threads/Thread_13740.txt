Ok so the flow of what's happened goes... - CPU started rapidly hitting 90+c so figure it was the coolit Eco pump that was acting up. - Bought and installed a corsair H100i, turned the pc on, still getting crazy CPU spikes from cold boot. - switched to low power mode, turned off turbo via bios. - start up, CPU still climbing quickly to 60-70c. Now this is all confusing because it seems like the CPU is just going crazy. But then it gets even weirder. - When the temps are stable enough from bios (around 50c) I continue to desktop. - upon loading the desktop it has the network loading symbol in the tray but it looks frozen. None of the system start up program's start and although I can click around on the start menu, I can enter control panel but if I click on any program's or desktop shortcuts nothing happens. - on a few occasions it would eventually do a blue screen memory dump n crash. - starting in safe mode is fine and everything works on the desktop. Also the CPU fans are running at about 2000+rpm. I really need help on this, I can not figure it out. It feels like the whole system is going. I'm really annoyed though because I just dropped &#163;95 on this new CPU cooler and the old one may have been fine after all! My pc specs are: I7 2600k oc'd to 4.2ghz Coolit ECO C240 ALC CPU water cooling (old) Corsair H100i CPU liquid cooler (new) Arctic cool mx4 thermal compound HAH 922 with large side panel intake fan Asus p8p67 rev3.0 Corsair tx750 Gtx 670 ftw 8gb 1600mhz ram 3year silver warranty

At best overclocking will shorten the life of your components, and at worst it will burn them out. When the temps get over around 80 degrees C, that can cause component damage. I hope it's not too late for you.

The cpu is on a extreme power save mode. Have re-seated the cpu cooler a number of time. What's strange is that if there was damage to the cpu/mobo/psu there would be other signs, at the very least there would be bios error codes on startup. And my CPU has never been stressed, the oc on it has always been moderate and it's temps barely ever went past 45c.
