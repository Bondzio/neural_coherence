google for &quot;charging station or dock&quot; should get you in the right direction.
the key for your needs is the flexibility of various different connections and/or universal one if supplied(adapter?).
of course, if your university/school uses such, why not see what they use.
you may find that such a station may offer to charge only similar same devices because so many devices get used and returned to be charged.
