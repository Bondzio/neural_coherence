recently i turned on my computer and instead of booting it showed a blinking &quot;_&quot;.
not knowing exactly what to do, i cleared the cmos and turned it back on.
at that point it failed to recognize the both of my western digital hard drives.
i opened up the computer and changed the arrangement of the ide cables and turned it back on.
then it worked.
but now, when i try to transfer files from one hd to the other, it will start transferring and then stop at about 30% and the &quot;3 minutes remaining&quot; turnes into &quot;5&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;20&quot; and so on.
anyone know what i should do?
my friend says to &quot;flash&quot; my bios.
