browse the network for the pc that hosts the printer.
click on it and see if the printer shows.
it should if the sharing was set up properly.
do a right click and select &quot;connect&quot;.
i remember years ago older nt systems had an &quot;install&quot; option from this point but not sure if this works the same.
the ideal way is to use a print server but this costs a bit and not all printers and print servers work happily together.
