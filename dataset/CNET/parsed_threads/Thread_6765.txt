<s> I installed Windows 98 once, and it didn't work. </s>
<s> Anyway, I was able to start up in Safe Mode, and I had something like 5.8 GB of space on that computer's hard drive. </s>
<s> I decided to re-install. </s>
<s> I made a boot disk, and typed FDISK to re-partion my hard drive. </s>
<s> I deleted by old partitions, and made a new one. </s>
<s> When it asked if I wanted to use the maximum space for my partion, I hit yes. </s>
<s> It said 508 MB. </s>
<s> I figured something was wrong, so I restarted, and did the process of FDISK over. </s>
<s> This time, instead of clicking yes to the maximum, I just set the value of space to be used on the partion I wanted (in percent) to 99%. </s>
<s> It came out as like 500 MB. </s>
<s> What happened!? </s>
<s> It's like my hard drive was randomly reduced to 1/10 the size! </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> My first thought was that the hard drive was shot, but I later proceeded to install Windows 98 on it, so I fail to see how only 90% of it was ruined... Any suggestions as to where to go would be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks, GarciaOwens By the way, I'm 100% sure that my hard drive -was- very near 6 GB, so it's not just be seeing things or something. </s>
<s> 4 years late but i just got vista and it does this too, but it goes bak up like it goes 17.2gb 17.0gb 16.7gb down to like 11gb then jumps to 19gb </s>
<s> Have you looked in the BIOS to see what is detected as the hard drive? </s>
<s> Depending on that, how old is the computer? </s>
<s> Some really old computers cannot handle large hard drives. </s>
<s> did you click YES to having large drive support? </s>
<s> If you didn't then you are limited to FAT 16- 2 GB. </s>
<s> There was also an update to FDISK. </s>
<s> Even if you downloaded that it DID NOT automatically insert the new version into the file that makes the Boot floppy. </s>
<s> You must do that manually, either on the floppy as just for that floppy or in explorer to replace the old FDISK that is in the boot disk file. </s>
<s> For large drives the FDISK works just fine, however then the format reports the incorrect size, however if you proceed it actually formats the drive correctly. </s>
