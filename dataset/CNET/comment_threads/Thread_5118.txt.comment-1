I'm hoping to get advice on what the best/fastest cable modem/router device is?
I currently have a motorola surfboard sbg6580.
It works good, but it interferes with my direct tv so I can't use it and need to find another....
So, what is the best???
Price doesn't matter.
I just want the best one.
thanks!
