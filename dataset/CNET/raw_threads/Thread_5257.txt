10326	0	199984	2147647	NR	Chris_Fon	8/21/06 7:15 AM	1.1561445E12	Bluetooth Related Tech Challenge	I have: Nokia 6230 Toshiba Equium Laptop with USB 2.0 ports Windows XP Home Edition Nokia Connectivity cable I am planning to buy a bluetooth donlge for my laptop, but then wondered: Would it be possible to connect my phone to my laptop (via the cable or infra-red) and then use the bluetooth on the phone, making my phone itself the bluetooth dongle. Unleashing it's power to my laptop. Any tech-wizard up for the challenge?

Outside of the Linux bluetooth efforts, bluetooth insides are closed source and not open to us doing much more than what they give us. Yes, I've been using bluetooth in embedded applications and the closed world that it is has hampered adoption. Bob
