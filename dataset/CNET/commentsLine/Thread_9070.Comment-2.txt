is the drive a sata 150 or a 300?
whuch of the two speeds does your mobo's sata support.
the seagates have a jumper if it is a 3.0 gbps drive and the mobo's only 1.5 gbps.
mostly they are shipped with the jumper to limit it to 1.5, and must be removed.
[just the opposite for wd drives] the mobo reporting udma5 is an error according to scott mueller's book.
upgrading and repairing pc'sa [17th edition] quote is from the book.
hope that this does not violate copyright laws.
&quot;note that because sata is designed to be backward-compatible with parallel ata, some confusion can result because sata drives can report speeds and modes that emulate parallel ata settings for backwards compatibility.
this means the drive is merely lying for backwards compatibility with existing software.&quot; &quot;udma 5 is is ata 100 [parallel ata mode at 100 mbps] while the slowest serial mode [1.5 gbps] is 150 mbps and ultra dma modes simply do not apply to serial ata drives.&quot; &quot;the serial ata spec actually requires that the reply to the identify device command are to be set as indicated in ata/atapi 5.&quot;
