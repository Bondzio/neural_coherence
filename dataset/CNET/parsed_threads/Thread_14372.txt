<s> Hi all I have dell laptop and PC to connect. </s>
<s> Win 2000 sevice pack 4. </s>
<s> The laptop is mine but the computer is my school PC on which I have Power user account. </s>
<s> They both have those LAN connection things. </s>
<s> I have the LAN cable for the laptop. </s>
<s> What I did was to plug the cable into both LAN connections. </s>
<s> This does not seem to work. </s>
<s> I want to transfer some files. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> NIC connections require a cross type ethernet cable to work. </s>
<s> Any computer store will have it. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> When i connect the two together the PC shows up on the laptops network places. </s>
<s> However when i try to connect to the PC it asks me for a username and password. </s>
<s> Is there a way to get around this. </s>
<s> Another way I was thinking is to unplug a PC and plug my laaptop into the network and send the files to the PC that I want to. </s>
<s> The only thing is that I can't seem to be able to join the school network either. </s>
<s> It was a stroke of brilliance. </s>
<s> Somehow I thought of creating and administrator account on the school PC via my power user account. </s>
<s> Didn't think it would work but it did and then I logged on as an admin and now i can transfer my files. </s>
<s> Still not sure how that was possible though, but it worked. </s>
<s> hehe </s>
