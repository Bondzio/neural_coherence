<s> hi, I was looking at getting the Western digital raptor, but I was told for how much it is, it really not worth it. </s>
<s> I'm doing gaming on my PC, and I don't need more than 150 GB space. </s>
<s> so, I geuss what I'm asking is it better to buy the raptor, or get a 7200 RPM, hard drive? </s>
<s> My specs, Asus M2N-E SLI, AMD 64 X2 3800+ thermaltake PurePower 430 watts Xion 4 case, EVGA 8600 GTS </s>
<s> that's 90% as fast as a raptor. </s>
<s> and your cpu and video card are holding back your gaming performance, not the hard drive. </s>
<s> alright thanks, I know I need to upgrade my CPU, but whats wrong with the graphic card? </s>

<s> a 9600gt will double your framerates in unreal tourney 3, cod4, bioshock, and of course, crysis. </s>
<s> thats proably true, but I can't afford the 8800 series, and I play Battle for middle earth2 and it can run it maxed settings. </s>
<s> No lag </s>
<s> when you talk about bang for buck,I payed $90 fro the EVGA 8600 GTS. </s>
<s> so its still a good deal for that. </s>
