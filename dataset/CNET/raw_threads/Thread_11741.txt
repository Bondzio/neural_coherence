Pardon what may appear to be a &quot;stupid&quot; question but a flat panel LCD monitor with built-in speakers; it's not necessary to hook up the speakers on the monitor is it? Can you use your current speakers instead and the monitor will function normally (in terms of video quality)?

Just make sure the volume is kept turned all the way down on the monitor (if it has a volume setting) and ensure that the connector doesn't touch anything electrical (it will cause the speakers to hum).
