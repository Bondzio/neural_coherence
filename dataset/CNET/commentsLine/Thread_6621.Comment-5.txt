you can either go directly to the cyberlink website  to see what kind of deals they offer or just buy from the link you got directed to by windows.
there are free alternative's, but the codecs those freebie's install sometimes play havoc with other media and playback software.
the cyberlink plugin for windows media player will give you the powerdvd 4 codec (i believe), and your dvd's will play fine in windows media player on windows xp.
this doesn't work on 98se or me since wmp doesn't play dvd's on those os's.
you just miss some of the fancy audio and video tricks like multichannel audio and video enhancement.
you get the decoder that downmixes the dvd's audio to 2 channel stereo and the video codec that will enable dvd playback through windows media player 9 and 10.
