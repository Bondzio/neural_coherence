I'm trying to install an ASUS EAH4350 SILENT graphics card. Without the card in, the computer boots up completely fine, running Windows Vista with 2gigs of ram. The ASUS card uses a PCI Express slot, but once the card's plugged in, and I power up the computer, it will beep 6 times in sequence with a red light flashing on the front, stop for a second, then start beeping again. The start up HP screen won't run either. Any idea on how to install it with it working? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Is there a way besides a PSU calculator to figure out how much extra power I have or would be needed to run this card? As in an actual application in Windows or something? The entire reason I want to in include this card is because while playing the Sims 3, the screen will go black, but comes back darker than before. When the Sims is minimized, a warning triangle will appear in the notification area saying that the display driver crashed but has successfully recovered (or something or the sort) so I figured that a new graphics card would be the solution.

Other manufacturers websites suggest a minimum 300 watt power supply for their HD4350's, you also have to take in consideration that your PC is a 'small form factor', so write down the measurements of your power supply, and compare that to the size of new ones.
