<s> I have to buy a desktop to use as a server for either windows 2000 or windows 2003. </s>
<s> I would go for a laptop but they are not really good as servers. </s>
<s> I am looking for compact size like HP slimline or Dell XPS 210. </s>
<s> But can we use them as Servers? </s>
<s> Anyone has any experience, please share. </s>
<s> Also any other suggestions are welcome. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Goto either Dell or HP, etc. </s>
<s> and check out servers and review thier specs. </s>
<s> You'll see they're slightly different from basic systems. </s>
<s> If you really want a server to maintain uptime, don't skimp on the goods. </s>
<s> Even an older server system will suffice for typical server needs if all you want is a server in general. </s>
<s> In other words, servers aren't build for speed/brute force as much as they are for reliability. </s>
