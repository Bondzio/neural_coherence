you need to write the disk to 0's in order to ensure that all the old data is gone.
in particular with hard drives that contained windows at some point in time, this is particularly important.
windows likes to add files that can't be overwritten, even with a re-formatting of the drive.
it's best to download a utility from the hard drive manufacturer (western digital has a good one) that will write the disk to 0's.
once you do that, there is no way that any data that was previously on there could possibly survive.
