1.1.1	Hi guys.	St
1.1.2	I recently bought a new Linkys E900 router because my old router broke.	St
1.1.3	However this new one is a bit weird and doesn't seem to be working properly.	St
1.1.4	Im suspecting they sold me a used one because initially the default password (the one needed to access the router's setting from the browser) did not work and I had to reset the router to be able to access the settings page.	St
1.1.5	Unfortunately I'm not in a position to return it.	St
1.1.6	I ordered it online when I was in the US but now I am in Europe.	St
1.1.7	Anyway, lets get to the issues: First of all, to connect to the internet I need to connect the internet cable (the one coming from the modem) into one of the four LAN ports instead of the &quot;internet&quot; port.	St
1.1.8	If I connect the cable to the port that says internet, it doesn't work and the little exclamation mark on the corner of my screen appears.	St
1.1.9	Idk if that is how it is supposed to be or there is something I'm doing wrong.	St
1.1.10	Then once I connect the internet cable to one of the LAN ports, the little exclamation mark disappears (meaning it is now connected to the internet), But when I click on my browser it doesn't work.	St
1.1.11	I believe it is connect to the internet because most software that requires internet do work.	St
1.1.12	Ex.	St
1.1.13	Celtx which needs to connect online for some of its features can do so, and other software can connect as well with no problem.	St
1.1.14	Outlook connects and disconnects at random.	St
1.1.15	Even the web-browser (I use chrome) will work occasionally, but it will stop working at random, and even at the times it works, it only works for some websites and for some others it will not.	St
1.1.16	Occasionally it will work fine for all websites but after a few minutes it will stop working, then work again, then stop working and so on... For example if I watch a youtube video, it will stop loading halfway through etc....	St
1.1.17	The thing might be broken but maybe there is something I can fix in the settings.	St
1.1.18	Hopefully I explained my problem well and didn't confuse everybody.	St
1.2.1	That's a well known setup you can research on google with &quot;How do I use my router as a WAP?&quot; As no cable modem is listed I'll stop here.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	With the modem connected to the LAN port, there will be a conflict with the public and private IP addresses.	St
1.3.2	It won't operate properly in this configuration.	St
1.3.3	You should try: - Turning off all devices (including modem) - Turn on modem and allow it to sync (all lights indicating normal service) - Connect modem to WAN (Internet) port on router, then turn it on.	St
1.3.4	- Turn on PCs and test service.	St
1.3.5	If you still can't get it to work, you may need to contact your ISP and inquire on proper settings you may need for your router.	Sug
1.4.1	I made my router into a WAP (Idk why but it took me longer than I thought), now it works, no interruptions, but I feel that now the internet is much slower than with my old router.... My only indication of this is that videos take a lot longer to load (almost double the length of the video itself).	St
1.4.2	The speed seemed to be fine just after I turned the router into a WAP.	St
1.4.3	It was a few hours later that it got slow...	St
1.4.4	I think I have an aura that ruins electronics...	St
1.5.1	That didn't fix it..	St
1.5.2	I think it is because the modem is also a router itself (if that is the correct way to call it).	St
1.5.3	Based on another suggestion, I turned my new Wi-fi router into a WAP and now it works (connect the modem cable into one of the LAN ports), though the speed seems to be reduced...	St
1.5.4	IT is weird because with my old Wi-Fi router I there was no prblem ....	St
1.6.1	So your Modem is a Cable Gateway?	St
1.6.2	You didn't state what make, model modem you are linking to.	St
1.6.3	A Cable Gateway is a Modem/Router combination, some are wireless.	St
1.6.4	If it is a wireless gateway you wouldn't need to link to another router.	St
1.6.5	If it is a hardwire gateway I'd swap it out to a stand alone cable modem, something like a Motorola Surfboard and if the hardwired systems are all Gigabit ready I'd swap cables from Cat-5 to Cat-6 for better throughput potential.	St
1.7.1	The slowness is not uncommon as more devices get on the WiFi and LAN.	St
1.7.2	Be sure to keep what you can wired and for security have the usual WPA2 AES Personal security and if you can pull it off, schedule the router's WiFi to only work during the hours you use it.	St
1.7.3	Lastly, is the firmware current in the router?	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	It appears that it was the actual internet that for some reason got slow, because I connected my laptop directly to the modem and it was still slow.. Now it is better - even with the router.	St
1.8.2	Thanks and I assume it is the current firmware cuz I bought it just over a month ago.	St
1.8.3	Is there any way to check?	Ques
1.9.1	It's at the maker's web page on their product and usually on the web admin page of the router.	St
1.9.2	I compare the two.	St
1.9.3	As to bought last month, I've had no router arrive with current firmware.	St
1.9.4	Why that is, is simple.	St
1.9.5	They make it, fixing bugs as it floats across the ocean and no company can afford to open them up to update as they go to the shelves.	Sug
1.9.6	Bob	St
