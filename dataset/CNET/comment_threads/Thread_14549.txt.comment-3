I'd look at a new power supply, just to be safe, and given that that X2 is probably leaps and bounds above whatever its replacing, in power consumption and performance.
I'd also look for a high quality PSU over sheer wattage ratings, I can't stress this enough, and if you do decide to skimp on it anyways, all we can do is look on and say &quot;Told ya so&quot; http://www.xoxide.com/buy-computer-power-supplies.html A few manufacturers to add to that list: Corsair Memory (rebadged SeaSonic parts) OCZ Technology (very reputable manufacturer)
