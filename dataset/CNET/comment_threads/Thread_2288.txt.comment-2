Have you re-formated the drive and re-installed the O.S.?
Did you check the motherboard website for the latest drivers, and bios updates?
I recently installed a new motherboard that wouldn't let me install XP, until I updated the bios.
Have you tested the memory?
Memtest.
That's all that's left, since everything else is new, but keep in mind that even new parts can be faulty.
