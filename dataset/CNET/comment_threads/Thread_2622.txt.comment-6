1.
Pick a drive (I'll pick one from newegg and another from geeks.)
(120GB drive) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822152005 http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=4R120L0&cat=HDD Both are under 70 bucks.
2.
Pick a Mac compatible firewire case.
http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=BLU-MGB35U2FW-N&cat=HDD ( has all the cables and I have one of these on this machine. )
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817145126 (also has the needed cables) So there it is for right about the 100 buck mark.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Submit=SubCatDeals&SubCategory=414 shows the ready to use units, but you get about 1/2 the space for the same dollars.
Hope this helps.
Bob
