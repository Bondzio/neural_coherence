but since i owned a few parallel port scanners years ago i too can't remember all the steps.
however i don't know linux.
i use it.
but then again i'm fibbing a little here.
while i know a lot about linux nothing i know would be required to use ubuntu and sane to scan in images for use later.
bob ps.
be sure to post in more visited forums like the cnet computer help forum and other forums since the hunt for a cd will be quite the hunt.
i'm sure you looked worldwide on ebay too.
