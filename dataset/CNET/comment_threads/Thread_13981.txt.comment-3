That's true.
For somebody who knows what they are doing, physical access is all it takes.
That's why Consoles keep getting hacked to play backup versions of their games.
Even Unix would benefit from a fast RAM disk used to store frequently used programs, so I don't know why you claim it's not a solution.
If my idea would work, it's a great idea to turn older computers into RAM disks over FireWire to serve your main computer.
Just swap out your 512 RAM and pop in 4x2GB = 8GB RAM disk.
Get two cheap computers and a FireWire RAID card and you'll get around 200MB/s bandwidth from that solution!
A similar idea is the Gigabyte i-RAM, but they don't make those anymore so you have to be creative!
