I just purchased the Linksys WRTSL54GS router.
After many many calls to them just to get it able to get online, I now want to be able to use it for network storage.
I have a Dell Inspiron 6000 wirelessly connected to it, and a Maxtor 100GB hard drive connected to the router via USB.
Following Linksys' instruction manual, I can FTP to the drive.
However, I can't see it in My Network Places.
Can someone please help?
