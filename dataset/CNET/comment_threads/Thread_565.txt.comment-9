and not programs that might not move over easily, if at all, hook the old harddrive up as a slave to the XP harddrive (make sure both harddrives are jumpered correctly for Master with Slave (XP) and Slave (old).
Once you get to the desktop, XP's Windows Explorer will see the old drive as letter D: since there is a Primary Dos Partition on it (you can check the contents in a Windows Explorer window to be sure), and then just drag and drop from D: to C: for any files you want to keep.
Once you have done that, you can right click the D: drive, choose Format from the menu, and empty the drive out and use it now just for storage if you want to keep the drive hooked up.
Otherwise, turn the computer off, unhook the old drive, make sure the XP drive is jumpered again as Master or Single, and boot back up.
