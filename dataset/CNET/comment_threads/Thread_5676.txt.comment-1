Whenever I put in the software to install my Sound Blaster Live!
5.1 sound card i get an error message saying &quot;Setup could not detect any Sound Blaster audio card on your system.
Please ensure that your Sound Blaster hardware is properly installed before running this setup program.
Setup will now exit.&quot; Yet when I go into device manager it detects that I have installed the Sound Blaster card.
My motherboard came with onboard sound which I disabled and I tried the card in different PCI slots.
What should I do???
?
