Going for a cheaper build using build in CPU graphics: http://tinyurl.com/3fnjykh http://tinyurl.com/3bxd97n http://tinyurl.com/4y5gmrn http://tinyurl.com/3s7lnwg http://tinyurl.com/3cbwvfq http://tinyurl.com/4xpfacx http://tinyurl.com/3bv9mrr http://tinyurl.com/3okruxq I want more than 4GB Ram just cause, but it seems like the next option is 8GB?
Do you think the build in graphics will handle 1080P movies well?
Thanks
