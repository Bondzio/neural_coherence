<s> On my old micron pc that was advertised as a 1 gig athalon processor the computer properties it says it is running at 1.01 gig. </s>
<s> Now I have since built a computer and it was advertised as a 2.6 gig athalon xp but it is running a 1600 why is that? </s>
<s> Do I have to change some settings to make it 2.6 gig Also how does Pentium 4 compare to athalon in the way they are rating the speed? </s>
<s> One is the one with the 266 MHz FSB. </s>
<s> That runs at 2133 MHz IF you are using DDR 133 memory and have it set properly in the BIOS. </s>
<s> It's multiplier is 16, thus 133 MHz times 16 = 2133 MHZ. </s>
<s> However if you are only running at 1600 MHz that means that you are only using DDR 100 memory [or have the BIOS set to 100 rather than 133]. </s>
<s> [100 MHz X 16 = 1600]. </s>
<s> The Barton core 2600+ runs at 2083 MHz IF you are using DDR 166 memory. </s>
<s> It has a multiplier of 12.5. </s>
<s> Actually DDR 100 memory is called PC 2100, DDR 133 is PC 2400, DDR 133 is called PC 2700, and really DDR 200, DDR 266, and DDR 333. </s>
<s> AMD uses a widely criticized naming/numbering system that supposedly uses the clock speed of the Intel CPU, that the AMD CPU performs at the same level as. </s>
<s> Even though the Barton has a slower clock speed it has a faster FSB and larger cache, thus is a better prformer. </s>
<s> Thanks for clearing that up I think I understand that now. </s>
<s> On the motherboard there is a junper setting for 100 and 133 so is that where you would make the FBS setting depending on the ram you have. </s>
<s> The Motherboard is a PCChips M811LU </s>
<s> NIL </s>
