i will await someone's message regarding the best way to go thru this.
i'm also awaiting a call back from dell.
i replaced the two cd/dvd drives that dell sent and i received wednesday.
i still can't use the drives, so i expect someone from dell to tell me to format my hard drive.
i can't do that until i have a backup of the drive.
can i use pc relocator by connecting a scsi drive to my computer??
