i have an issue with my motherboard.
if i install any new ram other than what i used when i built my computer i can't use sleep mode.
the reason why, is that when i try waking my computer up, my processor idles at 50% and windows becomes extremely unstable and i have to shut down.
i have none of these issues when i boot up and my computer passes all stability tests.
so there is something wrong with the motherboard somewhere.
so my question is, should i install the new ram and never use sleep mode, or keep my current ram and be able to use sleep mode?
and i don't want to rma the motherboard because if i am going to go through that hassle i will just buy a new, better motherboard.
