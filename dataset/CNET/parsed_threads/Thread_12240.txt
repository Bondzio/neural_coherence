<s> I wanted to purchase a speaker system for my newly built PC. </s>
<s> I narrowed it down to the Logitech Z-5500 or Bose Companion 3 speaker system. </s>
<s> I wanted to get people's thoughts and/or experiences with these two. </s>
<s> I like the Bose for it's simple look, but would not want to sacrifice quality that the Logitech Z-5500 might potentially offer. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance everyone. </s>
<s> One 2 speaker system connected to my 32&quot; LCD TV. </s>
<s> The other is the Companion-3 connected to my 55&quot; Sony SXRD. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Killer sound. </s>
<s> The C-3 has bass that will rattle windows. </s>
