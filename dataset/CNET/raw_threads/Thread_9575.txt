I recently ordered the two best video cards (NVIDIA 7900GTX SLI). Now on Nvidia's website it says that the cards are Vista ready, but I read a review on CNET that says they'll only be good on DirectX 9.0. Vista only runs on DirectX 10.0. Does that mean the video cards will be obsolete by the time Vista debuts or perhaps will Nvidia be able to submit drivers to download so I get full graphics potential? I also am using the AMD 64 bit chip which also says it is Vista ready. But is it ready only with the minimum requirements or am I just wasting my time and should wait before I buy. Please HELP!

Vista will be pushed back more and more. Many people are going to stay with XP because it will probably be faster. All the newest games will be backwards compatible with XP for at least a few years. HL2 can run on win 2000. And since a gaming rig is only a gaming rig for about 2 years. You should never have to say, damn I can't play this until I get Vista. If I am wrong I will give you my address and you can come give me a punch in the face. ; )

I know a lot of gamers and they have some new systems much like you and when they put Vista on, they said it ran , well, like crap. They all went back to XP. I personally don't care for it and would stick with XP right now and I call Vista the Win ME of NTFS. I would say it's slow, sluggishly irritating, a bogged down XP and not worth the time. I would stay with what works for now. This is just my opinion though and you should still do some self research. Paul

That is a big word for 4 letters. I got around to thinking , yes I do that once in a while, and I figure maybe MS is doing the right thing. In the past they put out an OS and beta test the darn thing as legit OSs causing millions to fix issues as they went. Perhaps this is a better route to take and eventually will be more stable in the near future. I don't like the resource sucking of the OS but with higher ram, 64 DCPs and all, I suppose you can get more out of an OS. If it shows little improvment before final, then count me out, i'll wait for the next generation and use XP for now. Paul

Forget about Vista and stick with XP Pro. Everybody's hyped-up over Vista but it's going to turn out to be crap. Vista-Vista-Vista.............. do some heavy research.

Appreciate the advice and it will be a while before I upgrade.
