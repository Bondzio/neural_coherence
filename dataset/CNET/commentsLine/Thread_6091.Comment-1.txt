help.....i am experienced wifi user and am on my second laptop which i just purchased.....i have owned for about 6 months a netgear wgu624a/b/g.
when i setup my new fast,option loaded hp dv8210us with built in b/g wireless....i was shocked to find that they do not support netgear products....i have been to hell and back going round and round with tech service at netgear as well as hp..... no help there!!!
i have tried all the known configuration routines.....i also own a newgear a/b/g pcmcia card....it won't work either......disgusting.
i have an old dlink b band router that i daisy chained with the netgear and that works but it is slow b band.....i have spent several hundred dollars on the netgear and like using the a band security and other reasons.....not to mention not wanting to spend more money just to please those two guys that work out of their garage...hewlett/packard...anyone here got ideas.... one more thing, i was in a coffee shop and my wireless would not work....asked the coffee person what kind of router....you guessed it netgear... absolutly disgusting.....
