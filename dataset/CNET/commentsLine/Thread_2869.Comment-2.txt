i hooked the maxtor up to my dell laptop, copied that archive, then hooked it up to my desktop.
i am running xp-pro on a pentium with c: drive and 2 dvd drives (d: and e:).
the system found it and labelled it as f: ..so far, so good... created an archive directory, copied 4 folders, then had to wander off.
when restarted, the desktop can no longer find drive f:, the maxtor.
..bummer!...
oh yeah, if i power up with the maxtor attached to a usb port, the system hangs in post..double bummer!!...
have you too been thinking about getting an archival portable drive..?
