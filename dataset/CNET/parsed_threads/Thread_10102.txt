<s> Is there some way of making the thing work? </s>
<s> Would be nice to have it.... thanks for any help. </s>
<s> it is a psa h20l ata </s>
<s> it's a GSA, not psa </s>
<s> Swap the CD cables or get a new one and check results. </s>
<s> Just what do you mean by not playing? </s>
<s> if you have too much going on it may blog down the IDE Ch. </s>
<s> and/or slow it so much it appears as an error. </s>
<s> Thus check to disable any bkgrd. </s>
<s> running pgms. </s>
<s> to release system resources back again. </s>
<s> When it comes to CD/DVD type errors is to simply replace it and start from there. </s>
<s> The wear&tear of the drive has gotten to a point of failure though not 100% yet. </s>
