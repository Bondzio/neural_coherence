and wherea re oyu getting these prices, its so expensive firstly: look at intel's core 2 duo line, and amd's athlon64 x2, you dont need fx (and it doesnt get you much, unless you're buying the dsdc set, the dsdc setup would increase fps in supcom) secondly, sli, worthless, get the 8800gtx single, install it, and forget about it, you dont need sli (it wont help much with supcomm) thirdly, ram kit just means you get 2 or 4 sticks of ram in one package, vs buying each individually, do not get 4gb of ram, windows xp and vista 32-bit won't even see part of it, and while vista x64 can see all of it, nothing can make use of it (its a waste of cash, is what i'm getting at), if you want a lot of ram, get a 2x1gb kit and a 2x512mb kit and run 3gb of ram in dual channel, it'll save you the money on buying another gb, and it'll be usable the money you're spending on that optical drive is obscene, look at basically any other brand of dvd burner, it'll cost about $35, lite-on and nec are both great, so is lg i'd look at an entirely different psu, as the one you've selected doesn't inspire confidence, check out companies that are revered for their psus, not their calculators, such as corsair, seasonic tech, silverstone, pc power & cooling, enermax, etc if you still want sli for whatever reason, 850w is skimpy, i'd look at a different case with sli too, try silverstone, lian-li, or antec (you need more airflow), and 850-1000w of psu from a reputable, known psu maker honestly, the kb/mouse aren't worth the $100, you dont need &quot;gaming hardware&quot; just to game, if you want a fast response mouse, check out the intellimouse explorer 3.0 from ms, should run you about $35, just as capable as the logitech, but none of the built up hype, hence cheaper (even razer's mice are cheaper) check  you should be able to do a whole system with a 500gb hd (they only cost about $95) for under $1500
