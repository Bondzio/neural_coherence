1.1.1	Hi to everyone!	St
1.1.2	I would appreciate your advice and time; I have 2 single areas of concern: 1. download/upload Speed 2 Coverage distance/strength I use Win XP (SP3), my home is about 200 msq (600 sqft) and the walls are thin, wooden, paperwalled separators, yet an &quot;n&quot; draft Buffalo Airstation Nifty Giga cannot manage to allow g std laptop operation throught the house.	St
1.1.3	I want to watch Blueray movies, in full HD, by streaming them wirelessly from my laptop to my HT (through a Digital Media Centre).	St
1.1.4	Here is my doubt: given certain technical specifications as the &quot;n&quot; standard and the dual band (2.4 and 5 GHz) does it matter which model or brand I buy?	St
1.1.5	I am not interested in options and accessories as preferential bandwith assign, or USB mass storage sharing or Safety improvements or LCD screens, etc... Only speed and coverage.	St
1.1.6	Any advice for my next &quot;n&quot; std, dual band, router purchase?	St
1.1.7	Thank you for any help.	St

1.2.1	Hi everyone, I just realized that in theory a std should set the specs and therefore all routers should have the same a) download/upload speeds and b) coverage Strength/distance..	St
1.2.2	However, antennas, radio RX/TX, maybe even packet management and other matters may differentiate a) & b)...	St
1.2.3	So, I'm back at having to read all the reviews... Has anyone had to buy an N std, Dual Band Router recently?	St
1.2.4	Did anyone have to read all the reviews concerning a) & b)?	Ques
1.2.5	Can anyone cut my research time and give me the reply?	St
1.2.6	Thanks to anyone who did the research and is willing to share it.	St
1.2.7	Ciao, Tommaso	St
1.3.1	That the FCC limits power emissions in any one direction so all makers are playing from the same rule book.	St
1.3.2	Good routers tend to all blur into a group of good routers with bad routers finding bad comments so no one router stands out.	Sug
1.3.3	This is hard for most to accept.	St
1.3.4	That is, some think there is a router that will outperform all other routers by say 2 times.	St
1.3.5	That's untrue yet you find people researching this.	St
1.3.6	Here I use post 18 of this forum sticky if I need better coverage and it costs so little that maybe that's why many won't do that.	St
