1.1.1	I have a question.	St
1.1.2	I am thinking of getting a new ssd drive and windows 7, and using my old hard drive for extra storage.	St
1.1.3	Do I need to reformat it before using it as a second drive, or can it be plugged in after the new install with files and the old operating system still on it?	St
1.2.1	Yep.	St
1.3.1	Great, that will make it a lot easier to reformat.	St
