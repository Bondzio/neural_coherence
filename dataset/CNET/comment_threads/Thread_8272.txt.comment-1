Been thinking of getting a tablet for a few weeks now and am having trouble deciding between the iPad and the galaxy tab.
I've played around with the Note and I quite like the tablet (not sure how different the note is to the galaxy tab other then the specs and a flashy stylus), but it's a little out of my price range, however I have some reservations about the galaxy tab.
I currently own an android phone, the HTC One X and have some disappointing issues with it and because of that I am uncertain if it want to invest in an Android tablet, although I am beginning to think it's an issue with HTC, not Android.
I intend to use the tablet for reading e-books, music, browsing and maybe the occasional video.
The one of the problems I have with my HTC is getting media on to the phone.
I know you can mount them like a disc drive but I used HTC's own manager which is utterly horrible, which is one of the reasons why the iPad seems to be a better as iTunes is a lot easier to use as it's left a bad stain on my experience with android.
With the Samsung, I like being able to add more storage through the use of SD card as I don't really like being locked into just one amount of storage.
In the end, I am stuck in the middle with this decision and cannot decide, so looking for a little advice.
