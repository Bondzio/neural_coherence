<s> I have a few little questions about the practicality of the iMacs. </s>
<s> Can you turn off the screen only while the Mac runs or the speakers are being used? </s>
<s> Is there a little knob or something to physically lower or raise the speakers volume? </s>
<s> On my HP monitor, there is a small 'ring' and a small part of it protrudes from under the screen. </s>
<s> I can 'turn' the ;ring' left for raising volume and right for lowering volume. </s>
<s> How is the sound quality of the speakers, overall comparing them to other average monitor speakers. </s>
<s> People say that Win Xp runs better on a Mac than on a PC. </s>
<s> Is this literally true? </s>
<s> I am asking this because it does not sound logical. </s>
<s> PCs and Macs now have the same processors and are almost exactly the same under the hood. </s>
<s> So how can someone say that a Mac runs XP better than a PC. </s>
<s> Or is ti just the extra speed boost that they notice with a clean XP install and better, faster hardware? </s>
<s> Please give me your opinions about this. </s>
<s> 1) Can you turn off the screen only while the Mac runs or the speakers are being used? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> By setting one or more of the corners to turn the screen off, or by setting the monitor sleep option timer appropriately, the screen can go off after a pre-set time. </s>
<s> (The full-screen &quot;Visualizer&quot; feature that can optionally run while iTunes music is playing a song is pretty cool so maybe you want to leave the monitor on.) </s>
<s> 2) Is there a little knob or something to physically lower or raise the speakers volume? </s>
<s> On the iMac keyboard, there are two buttons near the top near the right... volume up and down. </s>
<s> 3) Quality of the speakers is a bit subjective. </s>
<s> For any speakers this size, you will not get chest thumping bass. </s>
<s> I think their quality is comparable to - or maybe a little better than - the speakers in my HP/Compaq n6220 laptop. </s>
<s> External speakers - with a subwoofer - would be an improvement in both cases. </s>
<s> My son has a set of Klipsch or Altec-Lansing (I forget which) that were $50-$60 a couple of years ago and they are fine for his needs... which includes playing movies through his Mac to a projector to display on the wall and the fill a small living room with more than enough audio to have an acceptable experience for his college buddies... and still have volume &quot;headroom&quot; to get louder if needed... 4) I have not heard/read/experienced XP running any better/faster on a Mac... so I will not comment. </s>
<s> Relative to items 1-3, a visit to an authorized Apple Dealer (including an Apple store, if there is one nearby) would likely help... </s>
<s> Item 4 would take a while to prove out... my opinion. </s>
