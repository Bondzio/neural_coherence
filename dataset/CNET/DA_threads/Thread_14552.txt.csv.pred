1.1.1	Good Day , I am building a new PC and I purchased an AOC LM760 LCD 17 & quot ; LCD .	St
1.1.2	However it has a D-sub connector only and my Video Card has both VGA and DVI-I connector .	St
1.1.3	The package contains a DVI to VGA adapter .	St
1.1.4	My question is will my LCD show an improvement once I have used the adapter to the DVI-I rather than the VGA connector .	St
1.1.5	I know that some LCD 's do the conversion from analog to digital within their electronics , however in this case will the LCD know that it is a digital input it is connecting to or will try to use the analog circuitry .	St
1.1.6	Will I see a difference .	St
1.2.1	the lcd will probably auto-switch to the proper input .	St
1.2.2	if not , enter the menu and manually aim at the appropriate input .	St
1.3.1	as soon as i hit submit , i finally understood your question .	St
1.3.2	you should n't see any improvement using the dvi connector with a dvi-vga adapter , so just plug the monitor directly into the vga ( analog ) output .	St
