I am planning to replace my cd-rw drive with a dvd-rw drive.
I have performed some minor work inside a machine such as adding memory, replacing a modem, etc.
Do you think a amateur like me would have a problem with replacing this drive?
Also, is there a website where I could get some detailed instructions on doing this?
Another stupid question: what is &quot;firmware&quot; and why does it need to be upgraded??
