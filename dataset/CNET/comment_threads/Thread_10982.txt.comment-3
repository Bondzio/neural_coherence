I bought the Calvary drive at Newegg and the reviews there are not very positive.
I can't tell if any of the reviewers used the SATA port.
I just turned on my computer with the Calvary drive attached to the mother board SATA port and my second hard drive attached to the controller card.
The controller card runs both my DVD drive and hard drive just fine.
The Calvary drive is still not recognized by the computer.
I will have to decide if I want to spend the money for another ESATA cable or just run the drive via USB.
