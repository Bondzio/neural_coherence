1.1.1	Here is a common question I think .	St
1.1.2	I have a perfectly working Windows XP setup , 160 gb drive .	St
1.1.3	I see a lot of 'backup ' solutions and I regularly burn off photos and docs to a CD-rom archive .	St
1.1.4	I see 'raid ' options and a lot of external hard drives that do 'incremental ' back ups .	St
1.1.5	I do not want a real time fail safe .	St
1.1.6	I think my issue with this is that if I have a dual/redundant drive that is storing data in two places , its real time and so its always mirroring what the environment looks like .	St
1.1.7	I am not seeking that .	St
1.1.8	I also do not want to crack open my case if I do not have too and make any jumper/switch settings or change the CMOS ( because everything works right now ) .	St
1.1.9	Here is what I DO want to do ; I want to take an exact image of everything on the PC .	St
1.1.10	not a 'restore ' point .	St
1.1.11	I am talking every file , every registry setting , every thing .	St
1.1.12	A true image of the hole enchilada .	St
1.1.13	Every save game on every installed application , just as it is .	St
1.1.14	not an incremental anything , a true image .	St
1.1.15	Then if I should mess things up on the PC or get bombarded with issues , I want to be able to blow away everything and go back to things EXACTLY as they are on the image .	St
1.1.16	I have heard of a product called 'Arconis True Image ' and my understanding is you can even create a shadow drive that is sitting on your hard drive you can revert from , but I am afraid then I go from 160gb to 80gb effectively .	St
1.1.17	So I am not sure that is the best option .	St
1.1.18	I have seen some interesting external hard drives , but they are not bootable , and so I think that while I may be able to push my data there , I am not sure that I can do a complete swap of what was on the external for the internal .	St
1.1.19	I know this much ; you ca n't yank the hard drive from one and put it another , because the OS sees this change and will now not register windows XP to the new drive .	St
1.1.20	Significant hard ware changes seem to cause problems .	St
1.1.21	Please give me a simple solution to creating a perfect image on an external drive or a virtual drive ( as a last resort ) .	Sug
1.2.1	Type that into google.com and enjoy .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hello Kaenash .	St
1.3.2	Acronis True Image creates an exact image of everything on the PC , every file , every registry setting , every save game on every installed application , just as it is .	St
1.3.3	You can restore this image at any time , so you 'll get everything back as it is when you create the image .	St
1.3.4	Acronis has a secure zone it 's a hidden partition where you can keep the imagies .	St
1.3.5	But you may not use is , if you want .	St
1.3.6	True Image has a high level compression option so if you make a backup from 160 GB the image file will be much smaller .	St
1.3.7	If you use an external HDD , you can create a bootable media CD , boot from it and restore the image from an external HDD .	St
1.3.8	At least if you need to upgrade to another HDD , you 'll be able to restore the image on a new drive .	St
1.3.9	http : //www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/	St
1.4.1	It 's MaxBlast .	St
1.4.2	It 'll clone a drive and the utility is free from Maxtor ( or whatever the name is now ) .	St
1.4.3	I 'd just buy a new HD , clone your PC drive to the new one , and put it away for safe keeping .	St
1.5.1	I am not sure I follow the advice .	St
1.5.2	Let me clarify and make sure I understand .	St
1.5.3	First , this maxblast software comes bundled on external hard drives ?	Ques
1.5.4	Basically , my vision was buying a 160gb external drive and then either having this arconis or something bundled with it make a bit by bit back up of the whole thing including the boot sector .	St
1.5.5	Then lets say I get so inundated with worms and spyware that I say ''Hey , I want to go back to when it was good again '' rather than select 'system restore ' which is going to do only partially what I want , I go hook the USB of this external drive that has been sitting on the shelf since I took a healthy image up .	St
1.5.6	I press a 'button ' that basically wipes EVERYTHING from the current hard drive and replaces it with this image on the external hd .	St
1.5.7	That is the part that to me seems surreal .	St
1.5.8	I see how if its just data files going from one place to another ( MPEGS , MP3 ) it would work .	St
1.5.9	But how do you wipe out one and replace with another ?	Ques
1.5.10	The OS would have to be erased so once its erased what allows it to access a usb drive and overwrite ?	Ques
1.5.11	I saw the part about the bootable CD and that sounds like what I would do is wipe things out , then plug in the bootable CD with fingers crossed it did n't get scratched .	St
1.5.12	Then plug in the USB and let it load to the C drive of my freshly formatted PC drive the image from the external drive .	St
1.5.13	I do not have a problem buying the arconis and the external HD OR just buying a maxtor if it has what I need bundled .	St
1.5.14	just tell me what to do .	Sug
1.5.15	thanks guys .	Polite
1.5.16	I think we are on the right track , I just do n't want to spend 400 bucks on a external drive and software only to find out 'oops , you are n't backing up your pictures ?	Ques
1.5.17	well you ca n't restore these settings and registry ' I understand the CMOS itself is not something I can back up or restore .	St
1.5.18	Some one could probably make a nice dollar bundling a perfect archived healthy backup product that you touch a button to save and touch a button to replace and this process is all automated .	Sug
1.6.1	Do you use it for a backup or just when changing drives ?	Ques
1.6.2	Only thing I would be concerned about is there 's no compression and just one copy to affect the restore .	St
1.6.3	I use Ghost and do image backups with it regularly .	St
1.6.4	to a second internal hard drive .	St
1.6.5	It 's only weakness is no automatic incrementals .	St
1.6.6	After I do the backup to a second internal hard disk ... I copy the backup images to an external and store it off site .	St
1.6.7	I 'm a believer ... backup or prepare for the heck that one will endure when your hard drive fails ... .not if..just when .	St
1.7.1	http : //www.farstone.com/home/ensite/products/restoreit-pro.shtml This tool & quot ; Sounds & quot ; like what I am seeking .	St
1.7.2	Anyone know about it ?	Ques
1.7.3	it has two options , incremental and a complete backup .	St
1.7.4	The idea was as I said to make a USB copy of my hard drive down to every last detail , then put it on a shelf .	St
1.7.5	eventually I get tired of sluggishness and I can zap this new copy back on there in place of the old one .	St
1.7.6	This thing claims it loads before windows does , which is why you can do that .	St
1.7.7	My big concern with it , ( other than it is only available online ) is that I have concerns that it will do harm loading before windows does potentially .	St
1.7.8	I once owned & quot ; System suite 5 & quot ; which is perhaps why I say all this paranoia .	St
1.7.9	It had a ridiculous restore function that I had trusted .	St
1.7.10	Sadly , it required a mouse .	St
1.7.11	I have ( as most do ) a USB mouse .	St
1.7.12	What idiot disabled the tab keys or arrow keys to navigate around and requires a mouse for restoring ?	Ques
1.7.13	Anyway , it was pure junk that did a lot more harm and no good .	St
1.7.14	thanks for the help	Polite
1.8.1	For the time being I 'll use GHOST 2003 for my image backups/restores and will continue testing True Image 9.0 and NovaBackup 7.3 ( as soon as it arrives ) .	St
1.8.2	I tried Norton GoBack a long time ago and it too did something at STARTUP that conflicted with other utilities I used so I stopped using it .	St
1.8.3	Having used NovaStor/NovaBackup before GHOST ... I 'm hopeful their new product will give the backup and restore capabilities I 'm looking for .	St
1.8.4	I definitely do n't want to have to install Windows and a backup program to effect a full restore .	St
1.8.5	That 's what Norton GHOST has done so well for me and the handful of freinds and relatives I help for these many years .	St
