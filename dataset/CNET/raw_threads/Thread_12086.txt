So I just email the people at compaq asking what's the maximum size I can upgrade my Harddrive to, and they said maximum is 60GB. I just bought a 160GB Western Digital HD!! I haven't opened the package yet, and in the email, compaq peeps said they have not tested harddrives bigger than 60GB. Do you think I should go ahead and try to install the new hard drive?? They did say my system is compatible with IDE hard drive, which is what I bought. My pc is a Pentium III 750Mhz, 128Ram, Windows 98 SE.
