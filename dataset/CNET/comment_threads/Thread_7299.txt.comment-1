I just bought two new Laptop, with Windows xp pro-sp2 (OEM), both are wireless ready.
When I use a cable (hardwired) they get the IP as it should.
Problem is, when I try to connect/join my existing wireless lan, those two laptop unable to get an IP address, what they get is 169.xxx.xxx.xxx (the Wifi icon has yellow triangle in it - 'Limited or no connectivity' or 'unable to get an IP address'.
Is there some setting I should look for?
I'm pretty sure this is a Windows XP-SP2 related problem, because when my other laptop with Windows XP pro-sp1, join the Wireless lan, it has no problem at all...
Thank You for any help and information.
