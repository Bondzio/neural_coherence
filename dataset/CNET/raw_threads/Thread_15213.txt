The BSODs are not software specific and occur idle, in Word, and using Internet Explorer. They started on 1/17/2010 and continue to this day. I have used several programs scanning for malware/viruses and everything is good there. I am running an HP desktop w/32-bit Vista. I have included one of the latest BSOD minidump reports for reviewing in hopes it will help pinpoint a problem. I see &quot;memory corruption&quot; in it and ran memtest and it passed with 0 errors and also performed a memory stress test which was successful as well. Any help would be MUCH appreciated!!

You state that you have run a memory stress test, but do not state which one, here is a link for memtest86+ which will definitely show where your memory is corrupted. http://memtest86.en.softonic.com/
13975	2	391094	3289362	3289369	bigadatank	4/19/10 11:33 AM	1.27167678E12	memtest	Sorry for long post, wanted to get all the info I had out there. Yes, I used memtest86+ and it found 0 errors. I used the Hardware Diagnostics Tool in Windows Vista for the stress test.
13975	3	391094	3289391	3289362	Brechan	4/19/10 12:31 PM	1.27168026E12	corrupted memory	Sorry, but it doesn't really take a tech wizard to see that your memory is at fault; all reports show that there is corrupted memory in the system, therefore resulting in BSOD.
13975	4	391094	3289431	3289224	R. Proffitt	4/19/10 1:38 PM	1.27168428E12	Windows Server 2008	You paid dearly for that OS. Now talk to the machine's maker and Microsoft about getting your money's worth. I'd comment about the failure but look at what you posted. It's incomplete but when I saw Windows Server 2008 I thought what a lucky person you were to have paid so much for that system. Bob
13975	5	391094	3289561	3289431	bigadatank	4/19/10 6:22 PM	1.27170132E12	information	What additional information would you like? I have about 30 BSOD Minidumps since 1/17/10 that I could provide. Would a system restore to factory settings be worth a shot? I guess that if things still are haywire it would pretty much cingle out the memory, right? I just can't beleive that the memory passed the memtest86+ and a stress test if it is faulty. Is that possible? Thank you!
13975	6	391094	3289583	3289391	bigadatank	4/19/10 8:05 PM	1.2717075E12	mr tech wizard	Why then does my memory pass ever test I have put it through? I am perplexed by this and my your snideness as well.
13975	7	391094	3289729	3289561	R. Proffitt	4/20/10 5:26 AM	1.27174116E12	None needed.	Windows Server 2008 is a many thousand buck investment on Server Grade machines. You should be hammering the supplier of the machine to get your SERVER up and stable. Bob
13975	8	391094	3289786	3289583	Brechan	4/20/10 6:44 AM	1.27174584E12	Sorry	didn't mean to come across as being 'snide'. You should heed the advice of Mr. Proffit though, and contact both the supplier of your computer AND Microsoft and get the rest of your SERVER programs sorted out. This could be the point of your troubles as well...having at least 1 incomplete program installed on your system.
13975	9	391094	3289789	3289224	R. Proffitt	4/20/10 6:50 AM	1.2717462E12	There is one small thing.	I see AVAST in that log. http://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=41382.0 noted this and they issued some fix/patch. Avast must have cost quite the pile of cash for WINDOWS SERVER 2008. I see it's 399 US DOLLARS so here's my advice. FOLLOW THE MONEY. Get the folk you paid for all this to support you. Bob
13975	10	391094	3289792	3289789	Kees Bakker	4/20/10 6:58 AM	1.27174668E12	Another small thing.	I see Mcshield.exe in that dump. That's McAfee, not Avast. While aswFsBlk.SYS is from Avast. Could it be these programs don't like each other running? Kees
13975	11	391094	3289793	3289792	bigadatank	4/20/10 7:17 AM	1.27174782E12	McAfee v. Avast	Yes I think that should be explored. I started investigating the antivirus issue last night and will continue again after returning home. I uninstalled Avast and will be uninstalling McAfee this evening. I will then reinstall Avast and see what happens and report back.
13975	12	391094	3289803	3289792	R. Proffitt	4/20/10 7:46 AM	1.27174956E12	Good call.	If there is a lesson here it's not to put more than one antivirus on such a machine. I'd still want to hear what all those folk/companies have to tell you have spending a few thousand in Server 2008, and those many hundred buck antivirus packages. You are out a lot of money here. Bob
