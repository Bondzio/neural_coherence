I have seen the threads about moving files using external HDD, flash drives, transfer cables, and networking the computers. However, my problem is that my new computer has Windows 7 while the old has XP. Which method of file transfer would be the best for my situation? Also, is there anyway that I could delete just the OS on the old hard drive and use it as a secondary drive without having any problems with file sharing? Thanks.

I connected the ethernet cable from the old machine to the new and used some USB stick to hold Windows Easy Tranfer for the old machine. This is not to write yet another tutorial but to share it works pretty good. From xp to 7 is supported. Bob
