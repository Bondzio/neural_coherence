1.4.1	Connecting two computers to a router forms a network of two computers .	St
1.4.2	The icon in your taskbar that indicates you are & quot ; connected & quot ; means only that you are successfully connected to your router .	St
1.4.3	That does n't mean that your router made the proper connection to your cable/DSL modem .	St
1.4.4	The router needs to be configured according to the instructions that your ISP provides for using a router with their service .	St
1.4.5	Internet -- - modem -- - router & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; computers This usually means setting the router to & quot ; PPPoE & quot ; for DSL or & quot ; Automatic DHCP & quot ; for cable service .	St
1.4.6	Sometimes MAC Address cloning is required .	St
1.4.7	Do n't rely on me , though .	St
1.4.8	You need to follow the instructions from your ISP for configuring your router .	St
1.4.9	* * * * * Also , make sure your router has the latest firmware .	St

1.7.1	For all with similar problems , try this : Go into your ADSL modem/router and configure it to enable & quot ; NAT & quot ; .	St
1.8.1	Can you explain how you configure your router to NAT ?	Ques
1.8.2	I have a Linksys WRT546 .	St

1.8.4	Mylalptop also does not bring up webpages when I am staying at a hotel and accessing their wireless network .	St
1.8.5	There has to be something on my laptop that I am not using .	St
1.8.6	My desktop calls the wireless network & quot ; smith & quot ; , but my laptop calls it & quot ; linksys. & quot ; I am considering deleting the network on both computers , then trying to set up the network again .	St
1.8.7	It all went haywire when I changed from a DSL connection to fiber optics .	St
1.8.8	My laptop works fine at work on my work LAN .	St

1.9.1	An ADSL modem/router has an address ( consult the user 's nanual ) - http : //xxx.xx.xxx ... ..etc .	St
1.9.2	where you set the modem with details from your ISP , e.g .	St
1.9.3	DNS , username , IP , password , type of connection , etc .	St
1.9.4	One of the items is whether to enable NAT or not .	St
1.9.5	For your particular problem , it seems that your wireless network & quot ; SSID & quot ; is smith , and your desktop has the wrong SSID .	St
1.9.6	Try to configure your laptop wireless adaptor to detect all available networks , or right click the connection icon ans choose & quot ; repair & quot ; .	St
1.9.7	This may also solve your peoblem at the hotel .	St
1.10.1	... & quot ; and your desktop has the wrong SSID & quot ; should read & quot ; and your laptop ... ... & quot ; .	St
1.10.2	It may help to & quot ; enable broadcast SSID & quot ; at the wireless access point/router .	St
1.10.3	It can be disabled later if so desired .	St
1.10.4	Note that it takes time for networks to be detected , and once detected , to get connected .	St
1.10.5	Connection may fail if the signal is not strong enough , although the signal may have been detected .	St
1.11.1	I have tried the repair feature , but it does not help .	St
1.11.2	I have also tried adding the laptop to the desktop network by running the wizard again and transfering the the configuration on a flash disk .	St
1.11.3	Still , smith does not show up on the desktop .	St
1.11.4	It looks like I had better get a hold of my ISP .	St
