any video/tuner card *should* support this feature, but lots of PCs have problems going to sleep and waking up.
if your PC can hibernate/restore without a problem, srpo should work for you.
generally, you'll need to use the official/stable (whql) drivers for your PC and the latest OS service pack... resist the urge to update your drivers beyond what the PC manufacturer provides unless it comes via Windows update (assuming you're using XP).
if you need more reassurance, post your question to ATI or the &quot;Home Theater Computers&quot; forum of http://www.avsforum.com/ .
