<s> OK....Here's my question....actually there are 2 1. </s>
<s> I have a new machine coming with a built-in TV tuner card. </s>
<s> In the same room, is my Cable Modem which is running to a Netgear Wireless Router. </s>
<s> I only have 1 Coaxline coming in. </s>
<s> How should I rig this up? </s>
<s> I plan on buying a surge protector(SP) with Coax protection so there is no hardwired path for a surge to hit my system. </s>
<s> I can't spit the coax before the SP because either the feed going into my Modem or my computer will not be protected (unless I buy 2 SPs). </s>
<s> Incidentally, my desktop will not be wirelessly connected so if a surge hits my modem, it can get to my router and them into my new system. </s>
<s> Can I input the Coax into the SP and then spit it coming out? </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> Can I utilize the Ethernet protection on the SP for this? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Several of the SPs on the market have telephone line splitters. </s>
<s> Are there any SPs that have Coax splitters? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> The USA Telco and Cable companies already have great protection on those lines. </s>
<s> What country are you in that you would add even more protection? </s>
<s> Yes there are splitters. </s>
<s> I do not know what the name of it is. </s>
<s> (There are so many types of connectors and adaptors and cables and splitters) Cables To Go Dot Com (not sure how it is spelled) is an example of a bunch of cables. </s>
<s> If I were you I would just buy two identical Surge Protectors (a.k.a. </s>
<s> &quot;SPs&quot;) and now I am confused about how this is all going to be connected. </s>
<s> I guess I could draw a map of what I think something like this would look like, but I won't. </s>
