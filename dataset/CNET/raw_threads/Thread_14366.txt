When I started having problems, UT3 would occasionally restart my computer mid-match. Then, in WoW I started having a lot of graphical errors with blades of grass streaming through the sky or ground textures making endless walls, or some parts not appearing at all and I just see through the ground. Now the problems are more intense - UT3 sometimes just crashes as soon as i run it. My whole interface in wow clips, disappears, flashes, etc - but none of these wow problems happen right off. It's only after I play for a while. Restarting the game usually fixes it. It can either be a restart, or my gfx card can crash. When it does crash, sometimes my screen will freeze but i can still see my cursor moving around behind it. Other times, it totally locks up. Sometimes my Catalyst center will tell me my VPU became unresponsive and has just been restarted. It may be worth mentioning that when UT3 USED to restart, it seemingly only did it when playing a certain server, and even after letting it run for 3 hours straight to strain it and see if it was the heat, all ran well. I'd say it was heat but I'm not sure. It's not running any hotter than it always has. I don't understand what else would cause these problems though. I run my A/V 24/7 and did a scan not long ago. I'm using an ATI Radeon X1950XT gfx card, and a C2D E6420 CPU. The computer runs hotter than most, but it's not unusual for this computer. I was about to buy a new 8800GTX gfx card when it suddenly hit me that the whole system restarting is most likely not the gfx card and that this whole thing seems like overheating in general. Does anyone know if it's heat, a virus, or some other problem? Would fixing this situation require a new gfx card, a hard drive reformat, or a thorough virus scan? Thanks in advance.
