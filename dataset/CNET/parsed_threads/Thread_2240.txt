<s> I have had a desktop PC for years and I always left it running in sleep mode when not in use. </s>
<s> I recently got the new Macbook and it is my first notebook. </s>
<s> When I am not using it should I generally turn it off or leave it in sleep mode? </s>
<s> Im not to sure if there are any differences to the hardiness of laptop HDD's over desktops. </s>
<s> Reading online it seems that Laptop HDD's seem to be a litte more fragile. </s>
<s> Also is there a problem with leaving the laptop plugged into the wall for extended periods even after it is done charging? </s>

<s> His cat ate the mouse when his computer was in the sleep-mode. </s>

<s> Not my computer. </s>
<s> I personally would shut off a laptop every time you close the cover. </s>
<s> Why leave the thing on? </s>
<s> Maybe Bob Proffitt can explain the difference on how PC Laptops and Mac Laptops work and how to treat them. </s>
<s> I think Bob's son has a new Mac starting in to collage this year. </s>
<s> I would love to purchase one of these dual-core laptops for my son also. </s>

<s> I believe the default setting for sleep mode on the MacBooks is to also put the HDD to sleep when possible. </s>
<s> So, once the laptop has gone into sleep mode, the HDD is no longer spinning and everything is basically in a state of limbo. </s>
<s> You should have no concerns about the &quot;fragility&quot; of the HDD, although they are smaller and appear less robust than their full sized counterparts, they are designed to withstand a little more &quot;abuse&quot; than a drive that will be forever fixed in a permanent position. </s>
<s> I have an old iBook that sleeps for 80% of the time, with the drive shut down, It's about 7 years old and has the original drive. </s>
<s> On the subject of leaving the machine plugged into the wall, not a problem. </s>
<s> The Power Management circuit will ensure that a float charge will be applied to the battery, just to keep it tickled up, and push the rest of the power past the battery to the inner sanctum. </s>
<s> It is a good idea to discharge the battery fully, once in a while (see the manual) and then plug it back in again. </s>
<s> Just run it until it shuts itself down. </s>
<s> Hope this helps P </s>
