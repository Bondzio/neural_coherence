first of all, if you have a firewall of any kind, this usually blocks the immediate connection.
you should first of all, run the network setup wizard on both pc's, making one the primary.
when asked to do so, insert the floppy disk, or cd from the pc you use as main and then put the floppy\cd in the other pc and reboot both.
now, you have to make sure winxp firewall is disabled.
you go to :my network places and open it.
then go to view network connection, click on it, got to the right and your connection will be there (should) , right click, properties, advanced, and you will see windows firewall connections, make sure file and printer sharing are not checked, then click the settings tab, advanced, uncheck local area connection.
apply or ok, and exit.
now, if you have other firewalls like zone alarm, you will need to enter the ip address manually, of the other pc, on each pc, to allow both to communicate.
also what i have run in to a lot, is zone alarm will still block if manually entered and had to look at the log file and then add the ip to safety zone.
which you may have to put safety zone setting to medium.
rarely but this happens, you may have to go to your network connection and right click properties again and do a repair on the connection, sometimes this takes out little bugs but i would check the above first.
any more probs, let me know, paul
