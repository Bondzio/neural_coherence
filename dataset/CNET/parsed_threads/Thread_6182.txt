<s> Im purchasing a hp a6230n computer 2.8 dual core, 3 gig ram, 400 hd going to upgrade the graphics card and the one im thinking about is the 8600 gt oc. </s>
<s> specs looked good, but i want to know how this card will hold up to todays games, toms hardware's tier talked about the 8600 gt but not the oc version so i was wondering if anyone here knew about it. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> From memory it wrote that within the same family you might see about 5 percent change in the scores. </s>
<s> It's a fine card but I'd still pick from the &quot;best video card for the money&quot; any day of the week. </s>
<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/10/01/the_best_gaming_graphics_cards_for_the_money/ In closing, no gamer I know of is happy with today's cards. </s>

<s> so is it worth an extra $80 for the x1950 pro (which is direct x 9.0) over the 8600 gt oc (direct x 10) </s>
<s> And benchmarks. </s>
<s> This is the only way I'll choose one card over another. </s>
