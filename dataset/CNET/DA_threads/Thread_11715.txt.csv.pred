1.1.1	Hey, I just installed the ATI Theater 550 Pro TV tuner card, and I want to play my PS2 on it.	St
1.1.2	However, I can't seem to find a way how to play it.	St
1.1.3	So I have a few questions: First, how do I go to the PS2 in the first place?	St
1.1.4	Do I access it from TV?	St
1.1.5	Is there supposed to be a special channel?	St
1.1.6	Second, I don't have a cable or tv antenna connected; do I need to have one connected to play the ps2?	St
1.1.7	Third, I have Windows SP1.	St
1.1.8	Do I really need SP2 to play on the ps2?	St
1.2.1	The outputs on PS2 are???	St
1.2.2	RF???	St
1.2.3	Video???	St
1.2.4	?How did you hook your PS2 to your TV????	St
1.2.5	So lets say RF set PS2 to channel 3, connect a RF cable from the PS2 RF out to channel 3 the ATI tuner input and tune it to channel 3.	St
1.2.6	John	St
1.3.1	How do I set the RF?	Ques
1.3.2	I'm a little confused by what you're suggesting.	St
