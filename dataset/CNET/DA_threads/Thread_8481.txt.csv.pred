1.1.2	I buy the parts , put it together and then sell it .	St
1.1.3	I 'm going to post the specifications , and how much I paid for the parts , and I 'm wondering how much you would be willing to pay for said computer .	St
1.1.4	1 .	St
1.1.5	AMD Athlon II x3 450 Triple Core CPU 2 .	St
1.1.6	450W Power Supply ( Triple Rail ) 3 .	St

1.2.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-7586_102-589004/new-entry-mid-level-gaming-rig-does-everything-work-out/ ? messageId=5439282 # message5439282 The problem with this one is still what we covered before .	St
1.2.2	It 's a little light and no OS so you are unlikely to get a good price above the part costs .	St
1.2.3	The OS alone is worth a bit as a great install with recovery media is worth hundreds on its own .	St
1.2.4	But I have encountered those that build PCs that ca n't wrap their head around this area .	St
1.2.5	That is , they think nothing of installing Windows but we are solidly into the consumer age .	St
1.2.6	If they machine is not ready to use and can not be recovered without a guru or hundreds at a service counter it 's just another clone .	St
1.2.7	Clones are plentiful and cheap .	St
1.2.8	How will you make this unit stand out and not be yet another Ebay clone ?	Ques
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	The best I can do is include a trial operating system such as Windows 7 Home Premium .	St
1.3.2	I ca n't afford to spend $ 100 on an operating system .	St
1.3.3	I also include all of the warranties that come with the parts .	St
1.3.4	Other than that , I ca n't imagine doing anything to make it stand out and be more worthy .	St
1.3.5	Do you have any suggestions ?	Ques
1.4.1	It 's not ready to put to work so where 's the value added beyond you bolting together parts ?	Ques
1.4.2	- & gt ; Let me tip my hand a little .	St
1.4.3	I have friends in this industry and those the did n't exit the desktop marker were deeply hurt later .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	When outfits ... ..think Dell etc ... .are buying their parts by the train load ... ..think 20/30/40 % less than your cost and ca n't make any money building desktops ... ... .how did you plan on doing it ?	Ques
1.5.2	Build one ... ... test it ... ... .float it out on the market for 400 bucks .	St
1.5.3	Should not take very long to see if there is any demand .	St
1.5.4	You could not sell that machine to me but I doubt I fit your target audience .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
