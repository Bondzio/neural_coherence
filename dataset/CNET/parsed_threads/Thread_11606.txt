<s> I am a real NFS Fan but have never had the graphics card to run it at high resolutions...So my question is what card do I need (Options from both ATI & Nvidia) to run NFS MW and the 2 undergorund games at 1024X768 with some sort of basic antialiasing and medium to high levels of details. </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch </s>
<s> Do you have a PCI-E x16 slot on your motherboard? </s>
<s> or an AGP slot? </s>
<s> Without this info, there can be no recommendation for a graphucs card. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I've got a PCI-Express slot sitting there... sorry about not mentioning that... </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I also play NFS (most wanted is sweet), and I have an ati redeon x600xt. </s>
<s> I have overclocked the core by 80 MHz. </s>
<s> I can run most wanted on 1024x768 with maximum details, and get about 20 FPS. </s>
<s> Which is playable, but there is noticeable lag. </s>
<s> I'm considering upgrading to an ati radeon x800xl. </s>
<s> You have integrated graphics; you'll have to buy and install the video card, then go into the BIOS and disable the integrated graphics. </s>
<s> Oh yeah; whats your price range? </s>
<s> If you have around 250 I'd go for a 6800GS, or if you can find a GT that low. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim </s>
<s> See the price is the whole dilemma. </s>
<s> I want the minimum graphics card to run med details, 1024-768, with a bit of aa and with a decent more than playable FPS. </s>
<s> I was thinking about the x600 but would that be overkill for one very awesome set of games. </s>
<s> I want to MINIMIZE price such that I can play NFS MW and blow myself away and still have some room in a couple years time when the next one releases to play it at a lower resolution....Not to start a fire here but what is ATI good at and what is Nvidia good at?.... </s>
<s> P.S: Dont really want to go $250...hence the afore mentioned medium settings. </s>
<s> You should consider the nvidia 6600 gt. </s>
<s> If you only want medium settings for most wanted, then the next game might be unplayable. </s>
<s> NVIDIA has many different partners; look at this link and choose whichever one you like. </s>

<s> you could fish out some dough and cough up for a 6800GS, retailing about the same as some of its higher priced brother card, the 6600GT. </s>
<s> &quot;The Gigabyte GV-NX66T128VP made an outstanding impression on us. </s>
<s> The card is very fast thanks to its fast memory modules and higher memory clock rate, and absolutely silent thanks to its passive cooling. </s>
<s> The equipment, with video in and out, HDTV output and the good games bundle were also a big plus, and convinced us to recommend this card.&quot; From TH: http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/04/04/good_3d_performance_at_a_middling_price/page33.html ~Ibrahim </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I find that 128MB video with NVIDIA chips is the best route, The memory will support the size display you wish and the software companies are following NVIDIA's cue as the de-facto standard. </s>
<s> Other cards will work well, but may become jumpy and even cause comflicts with other software loaded at bootup because of the pathches needed to make the other cards work properly. </s>
<s> Someone might have suggested this already, but the 6600gt is the best way to go for you. </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=26408&CatId=1839 It should run your games at lower settings with a little of aa. </s>
<s> Although I suggest getting the ATI Radeon X800XL which for a little more $$$ can give you increased performance. </s>
<s> -How does the 6600 GT match up to the 1600XL ? </s>
<s> and the X700...isnt that a good card too. </s>
<s> I am talking Price/Performance wise? </s>
<s> -Should I get a stock card from Nvidia/ ATI or go with the different board manufacturers like Sapphire/Powercolor Thankz </s>
<s> just get 6800gs. </s>
<s> if not then get x1600xt. </s>
<s> if lower, 6600gt or x1600pro. </s>
<s> x800xl probably is same as 6800gs. </s>
<s> although both will do better than the other in some benchmarks. </s>
<s> ati and nvidia make the gfx core while the other manufactures make the board. </s>
<s> ati cards usually made by sapphire. </s>
<s> good manufacturers for nvidia and ati include: msi, powercolor, sapphire, evga, gigabyte, asus, bfg, chaintech, xfx, his, connect 3d btw i would go nvidia route over ati as ati cards dont seem to offer as better performance over nvidia ones nowadays </s>
<s> lacks shader model 3. </s>
<s> Thanks for that. </s>
<s> I guess I will go with 6600GT then. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
<s> ATI started rolling out SM3 with I believe the X1800XL and the X1800XT. </s>
