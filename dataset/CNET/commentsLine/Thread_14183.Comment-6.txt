in 1984 i was working in a structural engineer's office, and they had me use an ibm for typing client documents.
the screen looked like dos (no gui) and had a: and b: drives.
i had to code in text attributes the same way we do in html today (&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, etc.).
one day the boss brought in a brand new apple computer with the funny model name of macintosh, and he let me play around on it.
that's when the computer bug bit me, and i've been happily pcing ever since in both windows and mac oses!
:o)
