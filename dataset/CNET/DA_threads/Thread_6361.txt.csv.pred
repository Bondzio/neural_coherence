1.1.1	I have a desktop with a 1.2 Ghz Athlon processor ( Thunderbird I _believe_ ) with 384 ( 256+128 ) RAM .	St
1.1.2	No idea about the motherboard , do you know how I can find some stats about it ?	Ques
1.1.3	Anyway , running Windows XP .	St
1.1.4	Sometimes it gets a bit sluggish when I have a lot programs open .	St
1.1.5	Will upping the RAM to 512 or 768 be worth the money ?	Ques
1.1.6	Its SD-RAM , by the way .	St
1.2.1	especially , as you mention , you open a lot of programs at once .	St
1.2.2	512 to 1 meg would improve things in that regard .	St
1.2.3	You 'd still have to weigh the cost of additional RAM against saving it toward a new system or at least MB and processor .	St
1.2.4	I remember ( and often repeat ) a saying I once heard in regard to auto racing that seems relevant with computers as well .	St
1.2.5	& quot ; Speed costs money .	St
1.2.6	How fast do you want to go ? & quot ;	Ques
1.3.1	I have to agree with Steve on this one with regards to the ram issue , but remember , if you 're not a frequent upgrader , the sd-ram that 's in your system now is not only obsolete , but will be troublesome to find in another year and is incresingly expensive .	St
1.3.2	As an example , your ram probably runs at 133 mhz .	St
1.3.3	OCZ technology recently broke the 1000 mhz barrier with ram , so you can see it 's getting further and further behind .	St
1.3.4	Personally I 'd wait and upgrade the board chip and ram at the same time .	St
1.4.1	Seeing as how I am a college student , money for the whole MB/processor/RAM at one time is going to take a while .	St
1.4.2	In the mean time I think I 'll up the RAM to 768 and save for that exotic system of the future .	St
1.4.3	On a slightly different subject , if I shoot for a future price point , $ 2000 would pretty much get me the best processor/MB/RAM/Video at any point in time right ?	Ques
1.5.1	For a long time the trend has been that prices fall and performance increases but prices are falling more slowly now .	St
1.5.2	Basically , for the same relative cost today you get more .	St
1.5.3	But , I would not want to predict the future nor would I buy anything today to put away for later .	St
1.5.4	I 'd not try to find an & quot ; upgradable & quot ; PC unless the I planned to upgrade real soon as technology comes and goes too fast to know how long something will be useful .	St
1.5.5	Buy what you need today to do what you need to do today and not what you think your needs will be tomorrow .	St
1.5.6	Just my opinion only .	St
1.6.1	If u do n't see yourself doing a major upgrade soon ( proc , mobo , the whole works ) , then getting at least 0.75GB of RAM would be preferred .	St
1.6.2	WinXP is quite the resource hog , and will let u play some low to mid end PC games MUCH better .	St
1.6.3	I was the same way n college .	St
1.6.4	I upgraded RAM , hd , burner drive , mouse , and OS .	St
1.6.5	Everything else that was larger and more expensive i waited till i got out of school and would be able to better afford then .	St
1.6.6	for new system $ 2000 is enough for prebuilt places like Dell .	St
1.6.7	That price point should even include a nice LCD monitor .	St
1.6.8	If ya want a more extravagent LCD monitor , consider spending a 'lil more for a better LCD ( 20+ in , or maybe even those 24 '' widscreen ones ) .	St
1.6.9	Spending more on a good monitor may work well for future investments , as ppl will often reuse the same nice monitor for 5+ years , till the end of its lifecycle .	St
1.6.10	You can shave up to hundreds of $ $ off if you can find online deals and coupons for those PCs If you 're assembling your own PC , $ 2000 is enough with extra bells and whistles .	St
1.7.1	Well seeing as how I 'm a tech and small computer business owner my tendancy , especially in U.S. dollars ( I 'm Canadian ) would be to say that you could get yourself a kick @ ss gaming system for that kind of dough , with a 8ms response time monitor .	St
1.7.2	A word of caution , going with anything larger than 19 & quot ; in an LCD with a decent reponse time ( 12ms or under , preferably 8ms ) is going to cost you dearly .	St
1.7.3	AS for the system , if you 're adventurous and want to put it together yourself , a high end gaming system with AMD processor and dual SLI Nividia video cards could be in your future .	St
1.7.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.8.1	My intent is to build my own system , once I get that amount cash .	St
1.8.2	Thanks for all the advice .	St
