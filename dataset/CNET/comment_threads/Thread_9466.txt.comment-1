I'm setting up a home network with a Netgear RP614 router.
I have a Dell laptop running XP PRO.
I use the laptop at work, where the IT Dept.
has assigned static ip's to all clients.
My ip config is as follows: IP address: 10 218 154 11 Subnet: 255 255 255 0 Default Gateway: 10 218 154 253 Primary DNS: 24 92 228 12 Secondary: 24 92 228 173 So in order to be able to use my laptop at home I envisioned setting up my router's DHCP to something like: 10 218 154 100 to 10 218 154 254 But then I'm not sure about the DNS.
I would need the DNS to be the same as the default gateway?
Right?
So is there a way around this?
Or another way to do this perhaps?
