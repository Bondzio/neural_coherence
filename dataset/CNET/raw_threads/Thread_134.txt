8267	0	202345	2169009	NR	Jake F	8/30/06 4:29 PM	1.15695534E12	Ancient 8'' floppy drive needed	I have a long document that was saved on two 8'' floppy discs (using a Xerox 860). I'm hoping that systems with these drives are still in use somewhere or, perhaps, by a data transfer service. If anyone reading this has such a thing and can copy either to a smaller size floppy, to a cd, transfer files via email attachment, or upload via FTP, please let me know. Jake
