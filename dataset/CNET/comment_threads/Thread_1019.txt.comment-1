hi guys, Straight to the point,i have a very high number of files which are over 2,000,000,000 Nos, the volume of each file is between 1 KB and 30 KB,and because of the enormous count of files,copying them into a NAS (Network Access Server which contains 8 HDDs that are in 10 RAID-resulting in a 6GB Drive) is a complicated task.
copying through windows ordinary copy paste usually takes years(!!!)
to even calculate the task progress,and i also have tried using following softwares : UltraCopy, TeraCopy, above softwares usually fail in the first initial minutes,the following software-which is a great one for Copy Tasks- does not hang but again takes a very long time: RichCopy also i tried using Norton Ghost, which takes a image of the source drive in a short time,but again copying from the image to the destination drive is very very slow.
I'm looking for a solution which can copy the files from source HDD without worrying about dealing with every and each one of files,but only copying segments of HDD no matter how many files are located in them,perhaps this solution will result in a very faster copy.
I would appreciate if you offer me any professional solution for this issue.
Thank you!
