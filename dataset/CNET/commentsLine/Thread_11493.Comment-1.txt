hello again-- you all helped me solve a problem with my cd rom last week.
maybe now you can help me with my lexmark x125 all-in-one.
the short question, is it possible for the usb cord to go bad?
i have had this lexmark for 1-2 years, and it has always required me to restart the computer every day as it &quot;freezes&quot; up and won't print if it hasn't been used for a while.
of course i wouldn't save the doc i was trying to print, so i would lose that and then have to sit while i restarted and then start all over again.
for a printer without an on/off button, this need to restart has always troubled me.
so over the last month the restarts have not been working.
recently, i just couldn't get the thing to work even though the printer status showed ready.
so, i moved the cord to the front usb ports and it started working again.
today, i had to unplug the cord several times before it would work.
so is it the cord?
i have windows xp home edition 2002, have downloaded all the win service packs, and it's all running on a compaq with amd xp1700 processor 1.47 g with 480m of ram.
