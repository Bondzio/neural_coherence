Thanks, I've solved the problem.
It was preety simple, I'm just to noob to figure it out.
Ribbon was pressed to the far end on the roller and was rubbed by some parts of printer body.
Taking it back out on roller for about 3-5mm solved it.
However if you put it back to far it will be missing ribbon sensor, so that't not gonna work either.
Printer is Zebra 170Xiii Plus.
