1.1.1	Hey all - I am setting up a new small office network and I want to make sure my design using Cisco routers is adequate for what I am wanting to do.	St
1.1.2	I will have a 27Mbps network connection, approx 20 users wired/wireless, 10 of which will be wired desktops/laptops, printers, the other 10 likely to connect via wireless.	St
1.1.3	I am not expecting excessive file transfers or large amounts of streaming however, I would like to only have to adjust my bandwidth and not the physical solution if that becomes a requirement.	St
1.1.4	My plan is to buy the Cisco EA4500 wireless router and the SE2800 8 port Gigabit Ethernet Switch.	St
1.1.5	Will this setup keep consistent performance across wireless and wired connections?	St
1.1.6	What can these handle in concurrent connections performing normal daily email and web browsing?	St
1.1.7	Is there a more recommended setup I should implement?	St
1.1.8	Thank you for your help!	St
1.2.1	I've yet to see ANY solution that kept consistent performance as there are variables such as make, model or the laptops or slight location differences let a laptop edge out others and look preferred.	St
1.2.2	To solve this might require a rack of gear to met out the packets at a set rate.	St
1.2.3	Sounds expensive.	St
1.2.4	The setup is sound, common, works but your question might mean there are other goals.	St
1.2.5	The number of open connections is rarely a factor of the router.	St
1.2.6	Why?	St
1.2.7	TCP/IP.	St
1.2.8	I can't duplicate this as it's pretty well documented on the net.	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob.	St
1.3.2	My concern around performance was specifically focused on the fluctuation of users in and out.	St
1.3.3	If I add 10 users on to this network with the existing 10 already connected I wanted to make sure the performance didn't take a dive for all.	St
1.3.4	I understand this is dependent on how the bandwidth will be used.	St
1.3.5	This is a normal office, email and web browsing.	St
1.3.6	in your opinion, is the setup I have planned a good setup for this use?	St
1.3.7	Thanks!	St
1.4.1	That's how such a system works.	St
1.4.2	If you want to look into some bandwidth shaping router, there is such but I don't prefer the bald look.	St
1.4.3	You have a fine plan.	St
1.4.4	While I'd re-jigger it later with maybe a second access point if needed, I'd go with this.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
