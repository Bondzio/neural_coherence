Our web server for close to 10 years was some Pentium 100MHz with 64MB RAM running an older NT Windows. It had an 8.4GB hard disk and served up the web pages just fine. Are you sure of your goals? As to the software, today I want a LAMP based distro. Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_ (software_bundle) Bob

Today my favorite are those 20 Watt Geode CPU's. The current web server at the office is drawing under 60 watts at peak use now. Your goals are still unclear here. Web site or building a PC? Bob

Just layin it out straight so there's no confusion.
7834	6	248958	2493913	2493870	Darton Fury	5/23/07 9:32 AM	1.17991272E12	Simple Answers	#1 Trick Question? A PC can be a server, as R. Proffit stated, but dedicated servers have multiple, powerful processors, lots of RAM, numerous fast hard disks often in a RAID 5 array, and very fast NICs. #2 See Above. #3 Apache is a free web server.
