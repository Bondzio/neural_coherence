the router in the school is handled remotely by it personnel with school administration.
they had to open up something to get this out on the web, link it for me and give me an ip address to put in a browser for remote access.
but, would this explain why i can't use http from the local network...inside the school itself?
i can't see how it's firewall could have an effect.
as well, i can't figure how adding &quot;everyone&quot; to the share suddenly makes it accessible from either direction.
hope this makes sense.
thanks for the quick comeback.
