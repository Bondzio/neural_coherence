<s> i have DSL but i am getting cable internet next month. </s>
<s> I want to know do i need to buy a cable router or will my existing DSL router work with the cable internet? </s>
<s> I have verizon DSL and I am switching to Road Runner(time warner cable) internet. </s>
<s> because a cable isn't a phone line. </s>
<s> If the adsl-modem is integrated in your current router (or if the router is integrated in your current modem, that's the same) you'll need a new one. </s>
<s> But I think Roadrunner will supply you with a modem. </s>
<s> A only-router router will be able to talk with it. </s>
<s> A ADSL-modem-router combined may have the necessary connection to talk with it. </s>
<s> And possible Roadrunner will supply you with a 'multi-PC-modem'. </s>
<s> And that IS a &quot;cable router&quot;. </s>
<s> Better ask Roadrunner what exactly they have in store for you. </s>
<s> If it's for one PC only, ask them what you need to connect it to multiple PC's and if your current router will work. </s>
<s> It might depend also if they give you something with a USB-connection or with a RJ45-connection. </s>
<s> Only they know what you'll get, and only you know what you have. </s>
<s> Together you must be able to find out how it's going to work. </s>
