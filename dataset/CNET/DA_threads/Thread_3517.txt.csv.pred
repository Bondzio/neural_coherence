1.1.1	I 'm running Windows XP and i just bought a Wireless G PCI network adapter , i have disabled the linksys software and am using Windows XP to manage my connections .	St
1.1.2	So i was wondering if there was a way to get the linksys software off of my computer and still be able to use the adapter .	St
1.1.3	There are no options to close the icon when right clicked , nor is there a menu to block it from .	St
1.1.4	I tried uninstalling the software but that uninstalled the hardware as well , is there any other way that i can get this annoying software off my taskbar ?	Ques
1.2.1	installing the drivers from the Linksys disk without installing their software ?	Ques
1.3.1	No , how would i go about doing that ?	Ques
1.3.2	Would i just explore the CD with explorer and then open the drivers folder ?	Ques
1.4.1	you can do that .	St
1.4.2	When you install hardware and it asks you if you have a disk , click Yes and point it to the .inf file .	St
