1.1.5	BTW , there is no such delay if I boot from cd .	St

1.2.1	Try the CMOS boot order to be the hard disk first .	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.3.2	Glad to see you 're still helping in the forums .	St
1.3.3	Been awhile since I was here .	St
1.3.4	I 'm beginning to think there may be an incorrect RAID setting , even though I 'm not using raid .	St
1.3.5	The VIA raid driver is installed , and I can access RAID through BIOS , but for some reason I ca n't change any settings .	St
1.3.6	I 'll get back to you if I find whats happening with the RAID controller .	St
1.4.1	Some boards have a delay meant for external devices such as USB drives to spin up so they can be detected .	St
1.4.2	Look for this .	St
1.5.1	Had n't thought of that !	St
1.5.2	I 'll give it a look , and if I find anything wrong there , I 'll get back to you .	St
1.6.1	Tried every BIOS setting for usb delay , and none made a difference .	St
1.6.2	Thanks for the idea .	St
1.6.3	I 'm going to flash back to my original mb shipping BIOS and see if that corrects the problem .	St
1.6.4	Again , thanks .	Polite
1.7.1	If you are using XP , it 's possible you have the delay set there .	St
1.7.2	Look in the advanced section of your startup/recovery options .	St
1.7.3	You can view the boot loader by hitting the & quot ; Edit & quot ; button .	St
1.7.4	See if it mentions a delay time .	St
1.8.1	Thanks again Steven .	St
1.8.2	Everything there compares to my other machine , but I changed the settings around , but to no avail .	St
1.8.3	However , your post got me to thinking that maybe some other software is messing with things .	St
1.8.4	I am using & quot ; XP Smoker & quot ; , so I am going to do an uninstall there and see what happens .	St
1.8.5	Have a good one .	St
1.8.6	Ken	St
