<s> please i need some help i have a pioneer dvr-104 burner the firmware v.1.30, the problem is that it wont burn any cds, and also wont read any of them plz help me i will apreciate it </s>
<s> How old is the unit? </s>
<s> If such is like mine, it's dead. </s>
<s> Its been replaced since repair cost exceeded the price of a new drive. </s>
<s> Here's my final test. </s>
<s> I set it as master on a PC with no other drive and attempt to boot a Windows 2000 or XP CD. </s>
<s> No boot=it's dead. </s>
<s> We try the usual CD Len Cleaner, but service costs forbid doing much else. </s>
