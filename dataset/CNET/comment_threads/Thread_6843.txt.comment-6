the 680i line has been very problematic and has had data corruption issues.
this 750i would be a better choice if SLI is a must: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188026 the 8800gts/640mb has been obsolete since late last year.
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3140&p=7 the 9600gt/512mb and the 8800gt/512mb are faster and cheaper ($130-$170).
the 9800gtx/512mb is dropping to $200 in the next few days.
and the radeon hd 4850 and hd 4870 are generally considered the best choices at $200 and $305.
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3341&p=13 if you won't be using dual cards, then a p45 based mobo would be a better choice than the 750i.
if you want dual GPUs then drop in a 9800gx2.
