alright what you need to know is that with dual 12v rail PSU's the 12v rails aren't loaded as much meaning that 15A or 16A on each is perfectly fine that system will run perfectly fine on a good OCZ or Antec PSU providing 24A on the 12v (there-abouts) dual 12v and quad 12v are only good if your going to load a lot of stuff into the machine a 6600GT isn't a high power item things you should consider: A) afaik a Venice 3800 DOES NOT EXIST, so if you could link to what your talking about B) i'd get a 6800nU for PCIE C) Intel does not make Athlon64 support chipsets, and you want the nForce4, not the nForce3, nForce3 has all sorts of problems (it's the first gen for Athlon64, it has various things that cause issues...better than VIA but not by much) D) don't get Intel E) get a HIGH END PSU from Antec, Enermax, OCZ, Fortron Source Power, Sparkle Power or PC Power & Cooling F) make sure that CPU is cooled by a good HSF, Thermaltake anything DOES NOT COUNT AS THAT!
get an XP-90 and 92MM Panaflo High Speed fan...will let that chip run ice cold, meaning it runs more efficiently (does not require higher voltage, i know it sounds weird that higher temp wants more voltage which makes more heat...but if it's running hot it'll need more voltage to stabalize (Why do you think sub-zero allows such nice OC's on any CPU?)
aside from that it's looking nice
