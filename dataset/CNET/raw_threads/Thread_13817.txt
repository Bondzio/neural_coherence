So I removed the video card, unplugged my second HD and dropped the recovery DVD in and did a deconstructive XP reinstall. All seemed to go okay with the reformat, but now it boots to the XP screen, then shuts down and restarts...everytime. I cannot even continue in safe mode. I should not be having any hardware conflicts because there is none. I'm running off of the on-board video and nothing is plugged in. When I tried to boot with last known good configuration, it is saying something along the lines as &quot;missing system32&quot;??? I did reflash the BIOS earlier this year, will that cause a problem? The mobo is a MSI K8NGM2-L w/ AMD 64X2 Dual Core 4200 and 2.5GB RAM. 250GB SATA HD master w/ a 160GB PATA HD slave. This is on an eMachines T6216.

I've learned to make sure I have my XP SP2 CD handy with SATA drives and even more so with over 127GB drives. It's a minor point but one that keeps coming up. Bob
