It used to be true you could get more FPS or sound quality from a card.
This changed and now that many hook up with HDMI (with sound over HDMI) the sound card is just another item that could create problems for the new PC builder.
Let me be very bad here and write that very few can install Windows properly and then they complain about lockups and more.
WHICH IS WHY I like simpler machines for the beginner.
The sound card is not going to add value here.
I see you didn't pick a video card so please pick from THE LIST .
