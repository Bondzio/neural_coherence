<s> Having moved from the US to UK we forgot to flick the switch on the back of our Dell Inspiron desktop (basic 2004 model) from 115v to 230v! </s>
<s> We knew it had to be done but somehow in the confusion of looking for a plug adaptor it got plugged in! </s>
<s> There was a loud bang and a smell of burnt components!. </s>
<s> Can I assume the computer is now only worthy of the bin, ie. </s>
<s> will there be damage to other more expensive components than just the PSU? </s>
<s> Is it possible or economically worth an amateur attempting to replace the PSU in case it is just the PSU? </s>
<s> Any help greatly appreciated </s>
<s> Try one. </s>
<s> It's much cheaper than not trying. </s>
