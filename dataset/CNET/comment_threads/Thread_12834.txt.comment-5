Dear Bob: Thank you very much for your response.
You wrote, If the warranty can't be extended what stops you from opening YOU ARE SECOND TIME PAID MY ATTENTION TO THE WARRANTY OF THE MONITOR.
The warranty of my computer system was 90 days, and I thought the monitor has the same warranty time period.
After your second e-mail I started to read carefully the Product Information Guide and have learned that my monitor has a 3-year limited warranty.
I called Dell and they replaced the monitor with the refurbished one.
It works very well.
Best regards, Peter
