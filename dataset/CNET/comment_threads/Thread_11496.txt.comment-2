The best advise is to stay away from mix-and-match.
You are better off running the same brand of router and card(s).
I use the Belkin preN and have had no problems with it other than interferrence with like-frequency wireless phones.
That was an easy problem to take care of.
Range with the Belkin preN is very good and yes, it does support older/non-preN cards, however if you want to maximize your range and speed, then use preN cards with the router.
