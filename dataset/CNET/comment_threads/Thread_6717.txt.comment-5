This is currently just an old PC that isn't really doing anything but is soon to be turned into mainly just a music computer.
I have already Upgraded RAM to 3.0GB DDR PC3200 (Maximum as I'm currently only running 32-Bit OS), and I just ordered a New Video-Card for the PC.
For me it is mainly the challenge, I enjoy doing this and even if it doesn't show in much in actual performance it's more for the heck of it anyways.
I really haven't had a problem with the P4 HT 3.0 in this system, it's actually a relatively fast Processor, and unitl recently I did not know it was a 64-Bit Capable processor.
Just wondering if there is anything faster that can physically be put into the system.
