<s> Whenever I help one of my friends with their computer, I install SpywareBlaster, Spybot-Search & Destroy, and Ad-aware. </s>
<s> If they don't have antivirus protection, I install AVG Free. </s>
<s> On my own computer, I also have Atomic Clock Sync, Moffsoft FreeCalc, Notesholder Lite (handy reminders and notes), ShortKeys Lite (simple way to enter things like often-used addresses), Weatherbug, Webshots, Citi Virtual Account Numbers (from my Citibank credit card service), Auction Sentry for eBay, and Photoshop Elements. </s>
<s> On my kids' computer, I also have Webroot Spy Sweeper for additional protection with scheduled updating and scanning for spyware threats. </s>

<s> A great way to selectively synchronize your files across two or more machines is Allway Sync: http://www.allwaysync.com I need regular access to certain files from both machines, and I won't always be connected to the network with my laptop. </s>
<s> This free utility has been a real boon. </s>
<s> There are various automation features, but I just have a couple of separate jobs I created that I manually initiate at the end of the day. </s>
<s> Not only does it ensure that the files are in sync, but you have the added benefit of an automatic backup onto another machine. </s>

<s> * = freeware MinMaxExtender aka mmext. </s>
<s> If you've used Mac OS or linux before, you know that windows are capable of more than just minimized, maximized, and restore. </s>
<s> This utility also lets you maximize vertically, maximize horizontally, set a window to alwasy be on top, shade (just leave the title bar), and even minimize windows to system tray. </s>

<s> When i wanna zoom in on pictures or text, it's quicker to use this than to DL and blow it up in M$ Paint and Fax Viewer IconConverter Not a necessity, but now that I have it, I can spice up my folders and desktop icons with custom icons VirtualDub* compress, convert, and tweak (screen size, aspect ratios, filters) video clips winzip 7-zip* may be better for file compressions, but I'm already used to this, and it's paid for too. </s>

<s> In the future, maybe I'll switch to Avast*, AVG*, or some other freeware AV apps if the renewal fee for NAV becomes ridiculously high. </s>
