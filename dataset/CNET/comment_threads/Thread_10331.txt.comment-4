This is really a no brainer a LCD is much better that a moniter.
Video card if your a gamer and like to watch movies on your computer [ I DO ] upgrade it if you can afford it.
RThe newer VC's are so much better you wont believe your eye's how much more detailed your games and movies will be.
One more thing get a good sound card to make the expierance a whole lot better.
I have a sound blaster X-FI high fidality extreme music with creative 5.1 surround sound and love it.
