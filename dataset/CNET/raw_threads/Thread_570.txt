When I move to a location or move very slowly the mouse seems to jump a bit further or move up or down. The whole system is only about 6 months old. I have cleaned the mouse and tried to remove the mouse pad. I have tinkered with the settings in the properties without sucess. It is just a standard wheel mouse from MS. Any ideas?????

There are more posibilities but these are the most common ones. Shah,

They all have similiar problems as you describe. Occaisionally a small movement of the mouse causes a big move in the pointer on the screen. We have tried the differenet settings and mousepads too but the thing that solves the problem is switching to a Logitech mouse - problem disapears
