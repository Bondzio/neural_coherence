interesting article on todays and last weeks wall street journal on this subject by walt mossberg.
you can't view the entire written article unless you're a subscriber, but he has a couple of interesting short videos on the subject of crap-filled new computers that anyone can view - see link below.
he seems to agree with my point that expecting normal computer buyers to be able or advised to wipe their hard drive and reinstall windows (assuming you get a full version disk which most like dell, etc do not) is dangerous.
he also confirms that many of the &quot;restore&quot; disks have this junk on them, so you accomplish nothing.
i think this practice is going to become a big issue for computer sellers as folks find out that their spanking new vista computer takes 5 minutes to start up, largely because of advertising and trial software on their startup menu.
