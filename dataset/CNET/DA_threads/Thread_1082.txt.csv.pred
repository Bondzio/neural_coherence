1.1.1	I recently bought an Asus CM1730 Windows 7 desktop .	St
1.1.2	It came with an 'Installation Disk ' -- the retailer created a set of 'Recovery Disks ' for it .	St
1.1.3	What is the difference between them ?	Ques
1.1.4	When would I use each of them ?	Ques
1.1.5	Do either contain Windows ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thank you for your help .	St
1.2.1	My guess would be the ASUS disk would be what is called a & quot ; BOOT & quot ; disk and what the store created were the OS disks .	St
1.2.2	You would use these for system failures and ONLY then .	St
1.2.3	The store disks ( usually 2 or 3 DVD 'S ) would/should contain the total operating system and would restore the system back to & quot ; as new & quot ; .	St
1.2.4	The boot disk would be used IF the system failed to boot and would/could recover the system from within the system ( OS ) .	St
1.2.5	ONLY use these IF you need to , store them in a safe location as a just in case .	St
1.3.1	Thank you - your reply clarified my quandary a lot .	Polite
1.3.2	Not to beleaguer it - but - would n't the OS disks include the boot in ? ?	Ques
1.3.3	If ( and I hope I never do ) need the boot disc -- would n't I need to follow it with the OS discs ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thank you for your help .	St
