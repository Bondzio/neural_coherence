<s> Hi, just upgraded my motherboard with a newer ABIT Mother board with SIS chipset, memory, CPU and box. </s>
<s> Intel 2.4MH, 512 Meg, 350watt power. </s>
<s> The computer boots to dos or XP boot CD. </s>
<s> The old motherboard was 2x450 VIA chipset. </s>
<s> The new system will NOT boot from the old HD. </s>
<s> It posts and the BIOs see everythink alright. </s>
<s> Somebody told me it was because there were too many new devices to deal with, as the LAN, VGA, sound and other devices are integrated. </s>
<s> Any comments or places to go for help? </s>
<s> Did you install the OS once you installed the new motherboard? </s>
<s> Why such a small power supply? </s>
<s> Here's some articles about changing motherboards with XP -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?&q=xp+change+motherboard Bob </s>
<s> I had a similar experience but my system locked into a continuous restarting of the OS after coming to the startup options menu. </s>
<s> This is normal behaviour with massive hardware changes at one time. </s>
<s> I needed to boot to the XP CD and do an installation repair followed by a reactivation of the OS. </s>
<s> It was relatively painless and I was expecting this and came prepared. </s>
<s> The system worked fine after all new drivers were in place. </s>
<s> I'd try the installation repair method. </s>
<s> If you can make a full copy of the old drive first or an image of it, you can try multiple times if mistakes occur. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
