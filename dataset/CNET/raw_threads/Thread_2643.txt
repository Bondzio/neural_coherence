Haven't decided on whether to buy one off Gateway's web site, Velocity Micro's site, or just go to Best Buy and make the purchase. I chose Gateway and Velocity for there customer service and quality of systems. Most reviews on them seem to be good. I know you can customize if you buy from thier web sites, but that is the only advantage I see so far. Gateway, Velocity, or Best Buy store? Your opinions please.

If you go that route, get the make/model and go back home to research that model and see if it's been superseded or you can beat it by going direct. Bob

I had originally ordered one to be customized from HP. I also ordered a monitor from them. I got the monitor (actually 2), and since both were defective, I cancelled my order after spending about 4 hours on the phone with their &quot;tech support&quot;. ARRGH! I think the deciding factor for buying a VM was this article. I thought it was very helpful: http://consumer.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTIxNSwxLCxoY29uc3VtZXI= Good luck!
