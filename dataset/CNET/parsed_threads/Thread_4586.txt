<s> I currently have a wireless network with a cable modem. </s>
<s> I am thinking of switching to DSL because it is cheaper. </s>
<s> Do I need to have one computer on at all times for the DSL network to work? </s>
<s> I can't find a direct answer to this question. </s>
<s> All I want is to be able to have my wireless network on like it is now so that any computer (and the TiVo) in our house can connect at anytime. </s>
<s> Is it possible to do this with a DSL connection? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> But most likely you need to change or reconfigure the IP address... so before you change the modem, please make a note on your current configuration... </s>
<s> so everything will work the same with my network? </s>
<s> the only difference is that instead of haveing a modem that gets a signal from my cable line i will have a modem that gets a signal from my phone line, right? </s>
<s> i wont have to worry about having a computer establish some sort of connection so that the rest of the computers can get online right? </s>
<s> thanks for your help. </s>
<s> is simple, add a wireless router to the modem and each individual device may connect independently. </s>
<s> Note that some modem's will have built in routing capabilities. </s>
<s> Ask you ISP if they are providing such. </s>
<s> You pretty much called it. </s>
<s> There is no difference between DSL and cable other than the physical connection. </s>
<s> Swap the modem and plug your router back in. </s>
