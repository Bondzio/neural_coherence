1.1.1	Hi , I recently got a Toshiba Satellite E105 laptop and I was wondering how to wipe my hard drive absolutely clean of everything ( including OS and partitions ) and start over , installing my Windows 7 RC dvd onto a 2 GB ( or so ) partition and leaving the rest of the hard drive 's space on a second partition , assuming that 's a wise way to set up a hard drive ... ?	Ques
1.1.2	I already tried installing W7 RC only to find that there was already an OEM reserved partition where Vista is , so I was only able to install W7 RC on the larger of the two partitions , and I 'm pleased to report that W7 seems great , but I 'd like to re-install it onto a cleaned-up hard drive that does n't have a big Windows.old folder taking up a bunch of space .	St
1.1.3	So could you tell me how to set my hard drive up that way for my next attempt at a W7 RC installation ?	Ques
1.1.4	So to summarize , I first want to completely wipe my hard drive clean , which currently contains two separate partitions : one small OEM-created Vista partition and the main one now containing W7 RC .	St
1.1.5	From there , I want to set my hard drive up with one small partition I can install W7 RC on and another main one for storage and stuff , unless you hard drive experts think it 's wiser to set a laptop up differently ... Also , as a side question , could you tell me if a hard drive backup image includes everything like partitioning , etc , or if it only contains the OS , software , data , and things like that ?	Ques
1.1.6	Because I should probably make a backup image before doing anything drastic .	St
