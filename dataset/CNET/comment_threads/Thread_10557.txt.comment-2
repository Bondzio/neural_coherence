1.
How old is it?
If past 2 or so years, I agree.
Today's electronics in many cases are designed for cost targets and sacrifice longevity.
2.
Where is it?
Why I ask is that one member had theirs in an enclosed space.
Another had it buried under a pile of debris.
Treat it nicely and keep it cool without burying it under other devices.
