I'm transitioning to wireless n for my home network to facilitate streaming HD video and basically speed everything up.
We still have 1 computer that runs wireless g and often have guests that may have g as well.
Is it possible to hook a cheap wireless g access point like the Belkin F5D7132 to my new wireless N router?
My understanding is that running mixed g/n from the router will degrade the overall performance.
I'm assuming that running a seperate g access point connected by ethernet will allow the router to remain 100% n but maintain g access.
