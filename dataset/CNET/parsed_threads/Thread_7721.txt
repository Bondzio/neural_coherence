<s> If I burn files to a dvd here in the states and send the dvd to somebody in Europe, will they be able to read the dvd since it's two different regions involved? </s>

<s> Files and DVD movies are different. </s>
<s> Files are files, data is data, etc. </s>
<s> are home mpg and avi movies that I want to send to a relative....if I burn them as data, even though they are ntsc, will they be able to convert them to pal if they need to? </s>

<s> Hi Toni; If you have a small file, why not try to burn it, as data, to cdr, then copy it back to your hdd. </s>
<s> I only know that it works with mp3 files. </s>
<s> Hope it works. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> are all my backups of my home mpg and avi movies....I was wondering if I have NTSC and am copying the data files to another dvd media to send to my relatives overseas and they use PAL, will they be able to convert my data files to PAL so they can view them in a dvd player there since the two dvd players are from two different regions? </s>
