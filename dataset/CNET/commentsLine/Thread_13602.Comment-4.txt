to happen so suddenly suggest either a component failed or heat damage.
laptops tend to get hot and when run in such a condition sooner or later they poop-out.
to test the hd, i've used ada-2020 adapter to a desktop and access the hd that way.
you can then run whatever hd tests, etc.
to help eliminate the hd as a problem.
if no problem, return it to the laptop and try again.
you can get your hands on the ubcd, ultimate boot disk and get the .iso file and make a bootable cd disk.
that way you can test other componets, etc.
w/o the hd or fd.
if you can inspect&verify any laptop fans are working to include the cpu one(if applicable).
i found some laptops so hot, they burp the heatsink compound(expelled) to the sides yet work until it eventually dries out.
in these cases, the cpu has fried or become too unstable to re-use.
