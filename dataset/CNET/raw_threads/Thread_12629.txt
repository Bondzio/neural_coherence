It can be a ready-to-use NAS with USB or an enclosure for IDE or/and SATA HDD which support USB & Ethernet at the same time. The devices I did see can support network or USB but not both at the same time or does not have a reasonable price for a home user. I need something reliable but the speed is not very important. 1 MB/sec is enough for me. As I know an internal 500GB hard-drive is below $150 now so I would like to have a complete solution for $200. Can abybody advise me anything? Thank you. V.

It's also my web server running my web site. Nothing fancy, just a good home built. Since I do not need a lot of storage I only have a 60 Gig master drive and an 80 Gig &quot;storage&quot; drive. You can spend a gazillion dollars on a dedicated server, or you can build your own for a few hundred. Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't.

5934	2	237308	2424132	2424097	veey	3/8/07 6:14 AM	1.17333444E12	So what?	I have 3 home built PCs. This is just because I got rid of 2 more recently. The storage I need is supposed to be connected to my home theater since I have a DVD player with USB. And I would like the storage to be available on the LAN at the same time.

5934	4	237308	2424231	2424208	veey	3/8/07 8:09 AM	1.17334134E12	!	I am open to discuss options and I think I described what I need in details. Thanks.

5934	6	237308	2425831	2425762	veey	3/9/07 6:42 PM	1.17346572E12	?	What is F&PS?
5934	7	237308	2425837	2425831	veey	3/9/07 7:02 PM	1.17346692E12	Sory, I got it.	I still don't understand how that can be an option. Probably I am missing something but how can I configure a computer with a shared drive to work as a USB-drive? DVD player has an &quot;A&quot; USB socket and works fine with flash drive and USB-HDD formatted with fat32. I have A-USB on the computer wich is not close to the playre BTW. But if it was how can it be recognized as a USB-drive?

5934	10	237308	2426142	2426092	veey	3/10/07 7:49 AM	1.17351294E12	Thank you for a hint but I don't believe it will work	If you mean something like that http://www.usb-ware.com/usb-2-usb-data-link-file-transfer-cable-uc250.htm It can be used for data transfering between 2 computers. But it does not convert a PC to an external USB storage. Also to make it work special software must be installed on both computers. That software creates something like network bridge via USB. Unfortunately I cannot install software on the DVD-player. . The thing which could help me would be a device connected to the LAN and emulating a USB-drive. But I don't know is something like that available. At least I've never heard about that. That's why I think a USB-drive with LAN interface is an easiest solution. But as I told I cannot find one working with 2 interfaces simultaneously.

So without a clear spec I don't see anyone that will guess what you are trying to do. We were close. -&gt; Bottomline. Go to the store, go to newegg.com and see if what you want is made. Yes? Buy it. No. Make it. Bob
5934	12	237308	2426211	2426201	veey	3/10/07 8:29 AM	1.17351534E12	That's what I am doing!	I did read specs for multiple USB-drives and enclosures on newegg.com, buy.com, pricegrabber, etc., visited some manufacturers' sites. But still no luck.... And now I am here hoping anybody can help me.
5934	13	237308	2426250	2426211	R. Proffitt	3/10/07 8:38 AM	1.17351588E12	We did.	But a new spec emerged and the solution is no more. I think a new complete spec is needed. Bob

BTW I tried NTFS-formatted drive and it's not working with the player. Next to the player I have a router with WiFi & Ethernet. And I have a LAN with XP, Win2003 & Linux. Linux box is gonna be the closest to the player.

5934	16	237308	2426263	2423895	R. Proffitt	3/10/07 9:46 AM	1.17351996E12	Not an answer. But what I've tried and tossed.	I think I see where you are going here. I wanted a player that could fetch from some other place so I could have a digital jukebox. My first solution was the Dlink Media Lounge. It almost worked. It's downfall was Dlink never revealing how to properly encode video for this box. Next I used a full blown PC and http://www.mythtv.org/mythimages/menuiulius.png At the time MythTV was still getting fixed up. I may try it again but any day now the Apple TV will ship. So this is what I'm considering next (Apple TV) and since I already have nice Wifi NAS units like the DSM-G600 we'll see how it all gets along together. Happy hunting for your solution. Bob

5934	18	237308	2426624	2426489	R. Proffitt	3/10/07 5:48 PM	1.17354888E12	I had one of those. It suffered from that same issue...	As the Dlink. They never revealed what encoding would make it work properly. The Dlink ALMOST worked. But even at my best guesses somewhere 10 minutes into the playback the video would stall, audio would keep going and at 11 minutes the video would pick up again. I never found a good demo file to show it working. It sits back in it's box in case I ever find the answers in either firmware updates or another encoding. -&gt; There will be another reply to the top question explaining a technical reason why you can't connect the ethernet NAS and the USB port at the same time. Bob
5934	19	237308	2426641	2423895	R. Proffitt	3/10/07 5:53 PM	1.17354918E12	&quot;which support USB & Ethernet at the same time.&quot; = NEVER!!!	After a few days it finally occurred to me that I've been here before. Another fellow tinkerer found a box that claimed you could run the USB to 2 machines to share the hard disk. What they didn't reveal is that only a modified version of Linux could be used. Until you read the instructions. -&gt; Here's the bottom line. No USB host to said drive ever expects the hard disk directory contents to be changed underneath it. The file allocation system when Windows connects to the drive is expected (by Microsoft and just about any other OS) to be under the sole control of the machine that connected to it. When one machine writes to the drive, the next machine has not a clue that the allocation table is now invalid and it writes to clusters it knows are free promptly trashing contents on the drive. So there you have it. Why your product doesn't exist and never will. Sorry I didn't remember this earlier. Bob
5934	20	237308	2426833	2426641	veey	3/11/07 6:31 AM	1.17359466E12	That's a bad news.	As for me I don't care of file allocation table since player is gonna have read-only access.
5934	21	237308	2426909	2426833	R. Proffitt	3/11/07 7:22 AM	1.17359772E12	I hope you see the issues now.	Even if some USB port was marked &quot;read only&quot; the host would still fail as the machine altering the drive could and will rewrite the directory contents. At first this doesn't sound too bad until you discover that directory entries can change cluster locations too. I'd rather not describe every scenario here but after a few you discover &quot;this will never work&quot; and therefore no product will ever be found to do this. But we still found a solution to your first post but not with the product you noted later. Bob
