I know, I know thats pitiful but what I want to do is get the most that I can from this dinosaur. My machine runs great its old but its updated to that max. I have a GForce 4 mmx 440 se 64 meg Pci card that requires a 250 watt power supply. I've been running it on 90 watts for a couple years and i'm not getting the most from it. My question is; can I upgrade to at least a 250 watt power supply without frying my system??

Your 100 Watt light bulb uses... about 100 Watts. But the socket and supply can do more! Bob
