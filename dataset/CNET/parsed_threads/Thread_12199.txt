<s> I've had a HP f1703 flat panel monitor for about a year and a half (so no warranty). </s>
<s> This morning the moitors menu started randomly opening and closing itself for no apparent reason. </s>
<s> It wasn't doing this last night and I can't think of anything that would cause this. </s>
<s> Anything you guys could think of to help would be greatly appriciated. </s>
<s> I am having the same problem, but with a KDS monitor. </s>
<s> Have you figured out how to fix the problem? </s>
