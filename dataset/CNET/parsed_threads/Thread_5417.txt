<s> I have a desktop that recently died (motherboard) and since I mostly use my notebook anyway I thought I would just convert my desktop's internal 80GB HD to an external drive that I could connect to my laptop USB using an enclosure. </s>
<s> I just want to make sure that I can take the HD with its OS (XP) and all the files/programs and plug it in and read the data on it with no problems. </s>
<s> I have only seen/read about people using blank, naive drives for this. </s>
<s> I have some data/music/files on the HD and still really need them, so I don't want to reformat/erase it until I can at least transfer them to the notebook HD. </s>
<s> If I do need to wipe the drive, any comments on the best,easiest and cheapest way to retrieve my files first would be welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> This may or may not work. </s>
<s> Much depends on the partition type of the XP drive. </s>
<s> If your laptop has XP, this is not an issue. </s>
<s> The external enclosure will have its own controller. </s>
<s> It may or may not be able to access the information on the drive. </s>
<s> The ones I have work, however. </s>
<s> If you have access to another XP machine that you can temporarily connect the drive to and transfer your wanted files, this is another avenue you can pursue. </s>
<s> The external is a crapshoot. </s>
<s> I got the external enclosure, plugged in my old desktop HD (was running XP), and connected it by USB to my notebook (also running XP). </s>
<s> No problem detecting and reading the drive ... except: I could not get into my folder, I did not have access. </s>
<s> The program files, shared files, all other folders were accessible, just the &quot;my documents.&quot; I guess my login under the XP OS from my old drive is still necessary, but I can't get any prompt to get in. </s>
<s> How can I access this folder when I am using this HD as a secondary drive? </s>
<s> I will guess the OS on the laptop has claimed ownership for the system. </s>
<s> You can take it back through the security settings. </s>
<s> How you do this depends on whether the laptop is XP Pro or Home. </s>
<s> If Pro, just do a right click on the desired folder and go to Properties/Security. </s>
<s> Check to see if your logon name is listed. </s>
<s> I am guessing you are not there. </s>
<s> You will need to &quot;Add&quot; yourself. </s>
<s> From &quot;Advanced&quot; click &quot;Find Now&quot;. </s>
<s> Find your name and add it. </s>
<s> Return to the listing, click on your name and check the box for full control. </s>
<s> From this window press &quot;Advanced&quot; and then the &quot;Owner&quot; tab. </s>
<s> Click your name to take ownership and check the box to apply these settings to subfolders so they can &quot;inherit&quot; these permissions. </s>
<s> Now, if your laptop is XP Home, you can do similar but you must boot to Safe Mode. </s>
<s> Steve, Thanks for the tips. </s>
<s> Everything worked exactly as you said. </s>
<s> I do have XP Home, so I really would have had a lot of trouble figuring it out if not for your help. </s>
<s> By the way, why do you have to be in safe mode for XP Home in order to grab ownership? </s>
<s> And in safe mode why at login do I only see &quot;administrator&quot; and myself, but not another user (my wife) with no admin priveleges, while in regular mode I do not see &quot;admin&quot;? </s>
<s> My problems are all solved these questions are just for my own edification.... </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
