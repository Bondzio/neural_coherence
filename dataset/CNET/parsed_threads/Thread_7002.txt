<s> I have a Simple Tech External Hard Drive 320GB and now it's not working. </s>
<s> Here are 2 images. </s>
<s> http://img197.imageshack.us/gal.php?g=48904628.png I went to the device manager and saw no errors. </s>
<s> Some people said I need to partition or whatever and I don't know. </s>
<s> I need some other opinions. </s>
<s> more details please. </s>
<s> does it do the same if you plug it into another system? </s>
<s> have you tried removing power and data cables to the drive and letting it sit (drain flea power and cool off) for at least 30 min? </s>
<s> if the enclosure has any status lights, do any of them blink when you try opening e:? </s>
<s> have you tried another usb cable? </s>
<s> do other usb storage devices work fine (usb keys and such)? </s>
<s> if it is, then try using the usb. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work then the next thing would be &quot;data recovery&quot; which would be pain in the butt. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
