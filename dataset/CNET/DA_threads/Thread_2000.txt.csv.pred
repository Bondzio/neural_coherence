1.1.1	I have been struggling for a couple months now to get my computer to burn a DVD-R disk.	St
1.1.2	The computer works fine with +R but when I try to create a -R the disk writes a little information on the disk and then the drive and computer lockup.	St
1.1.3	I have tried just about everything I can think of without lick.	St
1.1.4	Drive Type - I currently have an I/O magic drive but even purchased an Pioneer.	St
1.1.5	With the I/O Magic I could write +R but not -R. With the Pioneer I could not get either to work.	St
1.1.6	Windows - I was using Windows2000 but just spent the weekend upgrading to Windows XP and it has the same result.	St
1.1.7	Software - I have used many software packages including Nero, ROXIO, and Pinnacle.	St
1.1.8	Disk Types - I have tried both Teon and verbatim Disks.	St
1.1.9	I have read other forums and found others having similar situations but no smoking gun.	St
1.1.10	Ideas welcome!	St
1.2.1	See if there is some updated firmware and my trick of recording at 1/2 (or lower) the rated drive or media speed.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I checked IO Magic for the latest firmware and loaded an update already without any change in operation.	St
1.3.2	Have also tried all the various speeds also without progress.	St
1.3.3	Other thoughts?	St
1.4.1	If it isnt the oldest bad doctor joke in history, its probably close: A guy goes to the doctor, moves his arm in a funky way, and says, Doc, it hurts when I do this.	St
1.4.2	Dont do that, the doctor inevitably answers.	St
1.4.3	Until you sort it out, stop doing that.	St
1.4.4	It's likely the drive needs firmware or is failing, but you didn't supply the exact make/model of the drive.	St
1.4.5	Hint: I/O Magic didn't make that drive.	St
1.4.6	It's something they got in bulk and had their label put on.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
