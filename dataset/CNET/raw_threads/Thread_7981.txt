What would be a reasonable Nvidia uprade for my system in the $100-$150 range? I am concerned about compatability and cooling. System: Pentium 4 3.2Ghz, 3 Gig RAM, motherboard Intel D865GLC. I am unsure of wattage of power supply.

Power supply. If you're unsure, how can we know? 3. Cooling. If this is an XP machine, 3 Gb RAM doesn't make much sense probably (depending on what you do with the machine). But it doesn't harm either. Kees

After that, choose from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/11/06/best_graphics_card/ If you can't tell what the power supply is then replace it at the same time with a monster. Bob
