<s> well i finally decided to build my own computer piece by piece and found that i actually did it right! </s>
<s> I upgraded from an old mobo and a 1ghz AMD thunderbird w/ sdram. </s>
<s> Here is what i got: arctic silver ceramique thermal paste AMD athlon xp barton 2.1ghz Asus a7n8x-e deluxe nforce2 mobo 2 bars of corsair 512MB DDR pc 3200 thermaltake silentboost cpu fan ATI all in wonder radeon 9600 seagate 160gb SATA hard drive 7200RPM western digital 40gb hard drive I run on windows 98SE only... </s>
<s> So first thing i noticed is that i cant have a drive any larger than 135GB because of 98.. </s>
<s> yay!... </s>
<s> I had to partition and i still have about 30gigs unaccounted for that i CANT use, any suggestions about that are welcome.. </s>
<s> Here are my issues though: 1. </s>
<s> I cant recall what programs they were but two of them showed my processor as 1.3 & 1.4 Ghz only! </s>
<s> This seems kind of true because it takes about 3 minutes to load windows sometimes more (longer than w/ my old 1ghz thunderbird) and also many applications dont show the impact of my processor being twice as fast now. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I get system hangups when the processor led is not blinking but there is something going on in the background 3. </s>
<s> Extremely slow transfer from hard drive to hard drive. </s>
<s> If i move around 10gigs or more, i usually get an auto system reboot eventually... </s>
<s> When i leave my pc on overnight to encode dvds ill usually wake up to a reset pc and an invalid/crashed file I was really expecting win98 to be on crack w/ this new configuration that it was probably not made to ever witness but instead im very disappointed that such an optimal setup could be so slow, i know something has to be wrong here. </s>
<s> I've tested my pc w/ the new warhammer demo and i was able to run it on full config with only some frame hits, i also can now run the highly demanding AVS plugin for winamp in fullscreen which i could barely use in half screen before. </s>
<s> My corsair memory IS reporting correctly at about 1.2ghz. </s>
<s> I have not been able to go online and update drivers but i will eventually do that, that might be a problem. </s>
<s> Please give me some advice. </s>
<s> The 137GB drive limit is DOS. </s>
<s> There is also an issue with over 512M with Windows 98. </s>
<s> This article explains how to limit Windows to 512M. </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q253912/ In closing, some machine misbehave with both sticks of RAM and that is a warranty issue. </s>

<s> im not worried too much about the ram, i will try that out though... what worries me most is that my processor is not showing over a third of its processing, ive never heard of any case where a 2ghz could possible report as a 1.3... has anyone?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Usually a sign the BIOS is out of date or you set the FSB wrong. </s>
<s> A new board does not mean the BIOS is current. </s>
