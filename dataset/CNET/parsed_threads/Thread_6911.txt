<s> ..Got a new Dell Dimension running WinXP Home in the B office. </s>
<s> After several tries with the network setup utility, I still can't get it to share files and printers with the computer in the A office, even though both computers go on the Internet just fine. </s>
<s> ..I used the network troubleshooter and got to the part about pinging the other computer. </s>
<s> I used ipconfig at the command prompt to find out the IP address for the B computer. </s>
<s> Then I walked over to the A office to find the IP address of that machine. </s>
<s> Then I tried to ping the B computer from A, and got nothing. </s>
<s> ..OK, were getting somewhere. </s>
<s> ..Then, on a whim, I asked A to ping itself. </s>
<s> A normal response came back. </s>
<s> OK, thats good. </s>
<s> Then I walked back to B and tried to ping A. </s>
<s> A normal response came back. </s>
<s> Hmmm. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> .I can ping A from B, but I cant ping B from A. </s>
<s> Is that normal? </s>
<s> ..Then I asked B to ping itself. </s>
<s> ..No response. </s>
<s> ..Now, how can a computer be unable to talk to its own self? </s>
<s> I checked the properties tab on the network connection for B, and everything appears to be nominal. </s>
<s> I set file and printer sharing ON in the network setup utility. </s>
<s> Can anybody tell me whats going on? </s>
<s> Is this really weird, or am I just ignorant about something? </s>
<s> * </s>
<s> I assume that your have a router!!!! </s>
<s> If not GET one. </s>
<s> Then you can set up your home network. </s>
<s> &quot;computer in the A office, even though both computers go on the Internet just fine&quot;. </s>
<s> What is this computer??? </s>
<s> What OS is on it??? </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Both computers are Dell Dimensions with Pentium 4's running WinXP Home with 512K RAM, networked via a router. </s>
<s> The previous computer in office B networked just fine, and I'm plugging in the new one with the same cable plugged into the same outlet. </s>
<s> I dug a little more and found that even though I had directed the network wizard to enable file and printer sharing, it had not done so. </s>
<s> The shared folder was unshared, according to the blank box in the Properties dialog box. </s>
<s> When I used the Properties function to allow the folder to be shared (by checkmarking the 'shared' box), it balked and the first couple of attempts were rejected. </s>
<s> I noticed and unchecked the 'Read Only' box on the folder, and that got it to accept the 'shared' function. </s>
<s> I thought. </s>
<s> But nothing actually had changed when I tested it. </s>
<s> I'm still curious about the failure to ping. </s>
<s> What might that mean? </s>
<s> I'm thinking ethernet adaptor failure, and get a new ethernet card. </s>
<s> But I don't really grok networking that well. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> * </s>
<s> First of all, if you have a firewall of any kind, this usually blocks the immediate connection. </s>
<s> You should first of all, run the network setup wizard on both pc's, making one the primary. </s>
<s> When asked to do so, insert the floppy disk, or cd from the pc you use as main and then put the floppy\cd in the other pc and reboot both. </s>
<s> Now, you have to make sure winxp firewall is disabled. </s>
<s> You go to :my network places and open it. </s>
<s> Then go to view network connection, click on it, got to the right and your connection will be there (should) , right click, properties, advanced, and you will see windows firewall connections, make sure file and printer sharing are not checked, then click the settings tab, advanced, uncheck local area connection. </s>
<s> Apply or ok, and exit. </s>
<s> Now, if you have other firewalls like Zone alarm, you will need to enter the ip address manually, of the other pc, on each pc, to allow both to communicate. </s>
<s> Also what I have run in to a lot, is Zone alarm will still block if manually entered and had to look at the log file and then add the ip to safety zone. </s>
<s> Which you may have to put safety zone setting to medium. </s>
<s> Rarely but this happens, you may have to go to your network connection and right click properties again and do a repair on the connection, sometimes this takes out little bugs but I would check the above first. </s>
<s> Any more probs, let me know, Paul </s>
