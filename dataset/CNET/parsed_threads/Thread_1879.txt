<s> Hi, I was working with my computer and suddenly it froze. </s>
<s> Then after rebutting the monitor, its does not come up. </s>
<s> Its stays black with a factory message stating that it has no problems and to check the cable connection. </s>
<s> I have unplugged, restarted from scratch several times with no luck. </s>
<s> I can hear the computer working and doing something but nothings comes up to the monitor. </s>
<s> I even have restarted with no other devices connected to my computer. </s>
<s> I have a Gateway PC1500, XP, Thanks... ... </s>
<s> It could be the cable, or it could be the video board. </s>
<s> First, I would reload the video drivers. </s>
<s> If that does not work, can you borrow another monitor to plug in? </s>
<s> If it works, then your monitor needs to go to the shop for a new cable. </s>
<s> If the substitute monitor does not work, then your video board may need to be replaced. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
<s> Thank you Frank... </s>
<s> I will try this and will let you know....Ramon </s>
<s> Check for PC issues. </s>
<s> If your monitor claims it has no video input, trust it. </s>
