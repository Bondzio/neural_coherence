laptop as I was running through my brother's 7year old Dell Inspiron 4150 (only 512MB ram).
I refreshed everything from top to bottom as, yes, given Xp's age and my brother's specs, it will run slow, just capable of the most basic now.
Maybe you would like to give windows7 a try to revive it.
Yes, linux is a good option for such if you are confident or willing to try it out (I have tried OpenSuse, Redhax/Fedora, Freespire alongside with MacOSX and Windows), and if you don't want to remove your current XP, there're linux distros which comes all in the CD itself (and runs from it directly) before deciding.
Anyway, newer variations of netbooks not only limits itself to the older Intel Atom N-series processor but, HP also do uses the Nvidia Neo processor, Dell uses the Atom Z-series, Acer Timeline uses the Intel's ULV variations.
