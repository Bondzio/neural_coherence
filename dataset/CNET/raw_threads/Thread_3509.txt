If you're using FAT32 on the system, you'll experience what you're seeing. There are file size limits as well as folder limits. You said the external drive is virus &quot;affected&quot; but I'm not sure what that means. An external drive cannot run virus code on its own. It can contain files with virus code if that's what you mean. It can also have damaged files so maybe you can explain the symptoms that led to your conclusion. In any event, you might be able to copy the files to another external drive rather than to your PC drive if you can come up with such. As well, your Ubuntu might be able to burn files to either an image or to DVD if it will allow disk swapping.

Ubuntu offers you the chance but if the files over the FAT32 limits then really you've gone as far as you can go. Understand, you have a hosed ext. drive that Win7 sees as corrupted FAT structure and Ubuntu sees that too it does use the same FAT32 structure or similar but very large files usually cause a problem above 4Gb, thus a limit. On top of that you still have some corruption which adds to the issue. You may want to try some &quot;recovery s/w&quot; that hopefully can repair the corruption and/or allow under Win7 to retrieve data. This all takes time, so don't be surprised if this is a long process. Next time, store precious data in multiple media as ext. drives should be considered temporary at best. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1621657 tada -----Willy
