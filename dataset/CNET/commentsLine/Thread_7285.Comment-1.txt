hello, i have a small 3 comp.
home network (win xp pro).
all machines have fixed ip adresses.
i have a switch and through it the comp.
connect to adsl.
it works fine, but as soon as i add my laptop to the lan (connect it to the switch), the lan looses internet connectivity.
as soon as i disconnect the laptop, the internet is back, why?
the switch has 5 ports + uplink to the adsl modem.
regards, mirza
