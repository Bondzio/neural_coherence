i have an html web app in &quot;internal&quot; network.
i want to display it's content on web server and web server only.
is there some solution that would present my web app from internal network on my public web server, and not open it so that anyone that can look into source open it directly.
if i access it via iframe, that would mean, it can be accessed from outside.
is there a solution that would serve as a gateway but close any connections to network machine outside the network?
thanks, mario
