Every morning when I switch on the printer, it will say that the printer is not connected properly when it's actually connected. Then after restarting, uninstalling, and adding the printer again, until the terminal detect my printer (from USB port), everything will work fine until the next morning. I tried connecting using other USB port (back and front) and it doesn't work. Does anyone know the reason of it? Thank you in advance.

Every morning it will still be offline and I have to keep rebooting the computer until the printer is ready to use. It always comes out with an error message saying that the printer isn't attached properly, can't detect the printer and so on. The printer using a USB 1.1 is attached to the computer that is using a USB 2.0 port. Will this matter?
