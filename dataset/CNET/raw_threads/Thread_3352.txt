The spec is: Pentium 4 @ 3.0Ghz GeForce Nvidia 6600GT 1 CD-DVD burner 2x hard drives a few usb devices 1 PCI card for video capture I think this will require no less than 350W. A local shop has no 400W units but they do have a 500W unit on special offer (cheaper than the 350W they stock). I was hoping to get a 400W unit. Will it be OK to use a 500W unit even if it's full potential is not required? Will it overload my motherboard????

Nowadays one must be certain if the power supply has all the connectors that you may need if you go in for the SLI type systems. The new video cards need special power and connectors. Make certain the the main mobo power connector is a combo 20/24 pin connector. That way if you have a 20 pin you simply detach the extra four pins, but if you later upgrade to a new mobo that uses the 24 pin, you can simply reattach the extra four pins.

See pic (warning it's quite large): http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/ux/pix/d915gux_lg.jpg The main power socket has 24 pins (left of pic). There is also a square 4 pin socket and a rectangle 4 pin socket (right of pic). Is there any special requirements I should look out for in the PSU?

The mobo manual should describe what the other pins/sockets are for. I'm not certain what the connector next to the 4 pin connector is for, the one that you say is 4 pin rectangular. I assume that you have SATA connections, and newer power supplies all seem to supply a few power connections for SATA drives.

Consider getting one that takes an input AC voltage in the range of 80 VAC to 230 VAC automatically [no switch to select the voltage] it'll give extra protection against line voltage surges at the US 120VAC. Here's a link to one [a one day special price. LOL] http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817103937

The square one has '12V PWR' printed next to it. The rectangular one has '1x4 PWR' printed next to it and looks like the power socked on the back of optical drives (male connector - 4 pin). I've noticed SATA printed on it somewhere (I'm at work so I can't look. What is SATA?
4446	9	156757	1742052	1742051	mr_tinka	2/14/06 3:55 AM	1.1398893E12	Alt PWR	Look at docs online. The rectagle 4 pin power socket is the alternative power connector.
4446	10	156757	1742075	1742052	mr_tinka	2/14/06 4:21 AM	1.13989086E12	Alt PWR	Just been reading up and I'm a whole lot wiser. The 1x4 PWR is if the main power connector on the PSU is a 2x10 connector, the 1x4 is then required. The 1x4 connector is not required with a 2x12 connector.
4446	11	156757	1742298	1740158	Willy	2/14/06 6:29 AM	1.13989854E12	PSU - my std. advice	First of all, &quot;quality&quot; matters, cheap is cheap. Get a namebrand psu of at least 400W+ or better. If you buy a generic brand then get the highest wattage you can find to produce the most stable psu from any poor quality or just cheap make-up. Namebrand psus tend to be stable for even less wattage than generic ones. Having a high wattage psu will have its power demands available for the &quot;needed on demand&quot; usage as any excess will be available as required. Read the specs as any psu should detail themselves via thier decal/sticker. Understand, wattage output of the rated wattage is avilable but not for constant output, its only for &quot;peak&quot; usage and can't be sustained for extended periods will surely test the &quot;quality&quot; of any psu, thus more rated wattage is a plus. Find the rated wattage, and expect at least 75% be available on a constant stable output. Last, remember all devices are attached to the power output should a psu fail, the strong possibility exists that it may take with it any/all weak devices to include the mtrbd. so keep that in mind. tada -----Willy

4446	13	156757	1743153	1742346	Willy	2/14/06 12:56 PM	1.13992176E12	Some good ones	Unfortunely there are so many brands, more than ever it can be pretty much a hassle. I recommend Antec,Enermax, Vantec, and I believe Fortec or fortac. The most trusted and reliable brand is PCPower&Cooling(very $) but darn good check thier website of same name. tada -----Willy
