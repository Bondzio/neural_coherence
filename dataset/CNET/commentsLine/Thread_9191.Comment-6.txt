thanks for all of the help on that.
because transfer of files between the two oss shouldnt be a problem, i have decided to get a mac.
this is unless something overwhelming about vista (nothing yet) convinces me to switch.
now i want to figure out which apple laptop to get.
i think the macbook should be fine for what i want to do, but i am concerned about the integrated graphics.
this is not really a problem unless i get into video editing more.
in this case, the pro would be a better choice.
the price is the only obstacle.
thanks
