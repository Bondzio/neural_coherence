looks like a super machine at that price.
as far as the extended warranty...there's no &quot;right&quot; answer.
circuit city wants $139 for two years.
without reading all the fine print, i think this means it is two years in addition to the 12-month factory warranty.
it's really a &quot;peace of mind&quot; thing, a form of insurance like any other insurance.
i guess it all comes down to how long you will keep, and be happy, with the system.
you might be ready to dump it in a year.
or maybe not.
regardless, it looks terrific.
pick up a nice flat-panel monitor and you're good to go.
