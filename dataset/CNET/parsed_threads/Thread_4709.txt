<s> I'm planning to buy a 24'' monitor. </s>
<s> I'll mainly use the display to work with text, internet and for movies. </s>
<s> Much less for games (so far I have too weak hardware, although this may change). </s>
<s> Is important for me that the monitor had a D-Sub (only such I have in my notebook) and DVI. </s>
<s> I considered BENQ LED GL2450HM , Philips 247E3LPHSU and Acer G245HABID. </s>
<s> However I met with an advice that it is better to look around for a IPS panel. </s>
<s> I drew attention on the: 23'' LG IPS235V-BN, Iiyama Prolite XB2374HDS and DELL U2312HM. </s>
<s> I noticed that these three gather the most positive reviews, but which to choose? </s>
<s> And whether it's worth buying one inch smaller display but with IPS panel or maybe 24'' TN? </s>
<s> Have you looked at what Samsung has to offer? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/one-day-deal/ It has DVD-D, HDMI and d-sub connections. </s>
