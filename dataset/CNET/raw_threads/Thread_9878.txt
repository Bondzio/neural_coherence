I cannot use this drive with any other computers without installation the driver It is very inconvenient. So is there any possibility to use this Thumb Drive without driver? Looking for your help and advice.

Windows XP has built-in drivers for most thumb drives, but it is possible they may not work for some particular drives. Win 98 does not have such drivers built in, so you must load it yourself; and yes, you must have a driver installed. However, you only need do that once for each machine, so it should not be a big deal -- unless you are working with a lot of different systems. If XP does not support this drive, then the answer for Win 98 applies. Or you could get a new thumb drive that is supported; they are quite inexpensive now. Hope this helps Frank

My Thumbs Drive is an old one so it is the cause of this problem I think.I have checked their website also but they have only the new products and cannot find any solution of my old Thumbs Drive. I think it is time to change a new one.
