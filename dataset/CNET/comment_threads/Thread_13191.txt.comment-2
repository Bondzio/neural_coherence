I used the ATI and Hauppauge cards for the CAPTURE step with the AUDIO plugged into my PC's audio line-in jack.
After the capture I used Ulead.com's (demos are there) for the video to DVD creation.
The downside to this is that you can count on 6 to 10 hours of work for each 1 hour of DVD.
Not that you sit there for each hour, but that's the usual time it takes for the PC.
