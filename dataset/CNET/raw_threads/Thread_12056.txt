6878	0	135288	1524690	NR	zoltee	11/8/05 11:53 AM	1.13145078E12	very slow HDD write speed	I am booting XP Pro from a Maxtor SATA on an Abit AN7 (onboard sata controller - Silicon Image SiI3112) and I am experiencing very slow HDD writes. It used to be over 40 MB/s but since a while (I don't remember since when) it is around 5 MB/s. It writes ok for about 1 sec. (untill the buffer is full) than it drops instantly. I reinstalled XP, updated the bios, ran the diagnostic tools from maxtor, everithing was fine... where else should I look?
