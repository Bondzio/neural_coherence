if the hard drives are decent size for storage, then i would just try any one of the methods mentioned by the many different inputs from others.
reformatting by using the os is a great way to do it.
but if the drives are small and old school ide drives, then maybe it's time to spend a little bit of cash, and invest in a new sata drive for storage.
get a big one at least 1tb, that has 32mb cache or greater.
and yes, trying to reuse instead of tossing away, is always a good thing.
