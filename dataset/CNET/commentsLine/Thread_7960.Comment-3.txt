upgrade to a proprietary computer such as a compaq, dell, hp, etc.
you can reuse some of the components, however the first major problem is the nifty little cases they use.
simply too small to adequately cool any of the improvements you would want to make.
start with a new case [under $60].
best to buy one sans power supply and buy a separate supply that you verify has all the power needed as well as connectors needed for new mobos, videos etc.
very possible that your dell doesn't even have a slot for a video card, which right there kills gaming.
the fsb shows as 333 mhz which can't be upgraded without getting a new mobo.
you don't want to get involved finding out if the dell mobo is wired for a standard atx v2 supply or pay an arm and a leg for one from them.
go to newegg and check prices.
yep you will have to buy a new op sys [xp pro with sp2b, oem cd from newegg is $139.
home is $89].
