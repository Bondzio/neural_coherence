I use it and prefer it.
For some strange reason IE &quot;hangs up&quot; and I usually have to exit and re-enter the program, I don't have this problem with Firefox...That's why I prefer it.
Like others have said...Why not try it?...you can always un-install it if you don't like it.
Occasionally (rarely is more accurate) a website will require IE ...I simply close the Firefox browser and fire up the IE (hoping it doesn't freeze up).
