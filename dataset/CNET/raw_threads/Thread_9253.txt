I' getting a new pc and i was wondering what is the best processor/ graphic card combination is? i've got a NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTX w/ 768MB card and a Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6600 (2.40GHz) and 2 gbs of ram , will this all work good together?

I do however suggest you look into the PSU(power supply) side as that will strongly determine the uptime of this system as it will sustain heavy power demands. You should look for a SLI certified PSU and/or of least 500W or better and cheap is cheap(not good). The better PSUs are into the $150+ range and there's a reason for that as for similar wattage units costs less *may not* maintain their wattage output for long under heavy demands and/or build-up systems with all the goodies. If you don't have problems within 30-90days but do later get flaky issues, consider the PSU at fault, excluding s/w issues. tada -----Willy
