1.1.1	I have been working on a problem with my Netgear WGR614v5 router this past few days , to the point that I am ready to give in and upgrade to another router .	St
1.1.2	But I thought I give it a try here with my situation .	St
1.1.3	The router is connected to internet by a DSL modem .	St
1.1.4	I have one cable line connection to it , and internet works okay on that machine .	St
1.1.5	I have two other laptops and a printer connected to the router on the wireless network ; as recent as a few days ago , the wireless connection was working okay .	St
1.1.6	As of now , neither laptop or the printer can connect to the router .	St
1.1.7	I have not changed any of the setup , and I do n't have any new appliance nearby the router to cause interference .	St
1.1.8	I was watching the Netgear control panel on one of the laptops , it can detect good signal strength from the network , but as soon it tries to acquire network address from it , it cuts off and goes back & quot ; scanning & quot ; , then the whole cycle repeats .	St
1.1.9	One thought I had was the DHCP server , but checking its configuration in the router did not reveal any problem .	St
1.1.10	My best guess is that somehow the wireless part of the router is malfunctioning , could be something as simple as damaged antenna .	St
1.1.11	Since I have no other way to diagnose this , my next step is to abandon this router .	St
1.1.12	It would be greatly appreciated if someone has any other suggestion on the situation .	Polite
1.2.1	How about getting into the router and turning off the wireless radio , then back on .	St
1.3.1	If the router is set to WEP or lesser security you will see that today .	St
1.3.2	We cover the settings we like to see in this forum .	St
1.3.3	Tell more .	St
1.3.4	bob	St
1.4.1	I already tried turning on and off wireless radio , but that did not work .	St
1.4.2	The security is WPA .	St
1.4.3	I also have a wireless card access list , and all the laptops and printer MAC address are on that list .	St
1.5.1	Sorry but there is a reason we do n't use MAC filters .	St
1.5.2	Why did you add such ?	Ques
1.6.1	I believe the person recommending it to me indicated that it 's an added security , such that only those accepted on the access list can access the router .	St
1.6.2	I have always had the access list from as long as I can remember , so I do n't think that 's the reason the wireless connection is malfunctioning .	St
1.6.3	BTW , what 's the reason against using MAC filter ?	Ques
1.7.1	But I find some routers buckle under that use .	St
1.7.2	This forum 's sticky is pretty specific and we supply a suggested setup that is secure and works across most routers .	St
1.7.3	If you are having problems with your router then you talk to its maker .	St
1.7.4	I have no cure for such routers short of going back to our forum suggested setups .	St
1.7.5	Again , there are those that will suggest disabling SSID broadcast too .	St
1.7.6	But let 's let those that suggest such tell you have to deal with what happens next .	Sug
