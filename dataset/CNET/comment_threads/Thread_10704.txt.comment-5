Just need a topic...
Such old drives may have ODD (to today's users) jumper methods.
Some drives had a SLAVE PRESENT jumper.
But without exacting details I can't guess you missed the jumpers or what type IDE cable you used.
Then again, the 2GB drive could be dead.
It is certainly past the 5 year mark.
