i get this, but why am i losing connection when my neighbors stay on?
wouldn't that root back to my property?
the cable company is watching both of my neighbors connections to be sure it's not a regional issue, they stay on when i drop.
any chance at all that something in the modem and/or switch causes the internet to drop even at the modem level?
