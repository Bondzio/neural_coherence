<s> I added a new Maxtor Hardrive ATA 133 200 GB, I have a dvd & cd burner, 512 MB of DDR 400 Ram, a brand new 400 watt power supply, a pentium 4 processor and a brand new mother board... everything is new out of the box and nothing will turn on... </s>
<s> I had an old power supply in and when I tried to turn it on for the 1st time it turned on and off because the power supply didn't have enough watts. </s>
<s> So when I bought the new 400 watt one, I plugged everything in properly and I got nothing... </s>
<s> Someone please help.. </s>
<s> I did everything that needed to be done and I got nothing.... thanks... Sully </s>
<s> It doesn't sound like you have a very power-hungry configuration... You're getting nothing-nothing? </s>
<s> No lights on the motherboard? </s>
<s> No fans spinning? </s>
<s> No beeps? </s>
<s> List specs (brand and model) of your components. </s>
<s> i Have a Antec SmartPower 2.0 400W Power Supply * 400W * Unique Dual Fans Technology for virtually silent operation * ATX12V v2.0 compliant - consume up to 25% less power than standard power supplies The Mother Board Is an Elite Group 84.. something... </s>
<s> I have the box at home... </s>
<s> I have a Maxtor ATA 133 160 GB Harddrive Intel Pentium IV Processor 1 Stick OF 512 MB DDR - 400 PC 3200 Ram... A Xoxide X-Ventilator PC Case - Black W / Lighting: 180; Dual Blue Cathode Kit & 1 DVD - RW AND A SONY CD-RW I haven't installed Windows XP yet.. bc the pc wont turn on. </s>
<s> Okay, and absolutely nothing is happening? </s>
<s> Lights? </s>
<s> Beeps? </s>
<s> Fans? </s>
<s> no nothing at all.. What can it be? </s>
<s> 1) If there's an on/off switch on the back of the PSU, make sure that it's in the 'on' position. </s>
<s> 2) Take the board out of the case to ensure that you don't have a short somewhere (loose screw, etc). </s>
<s> Take it down to a bare bones power-up - CPU, one stick of RAM, PSU and Vid card, unless you have onboard graphics. </s>
<s> 3) If you still get nothing, can you test the PSU on another board? </s>
<s> I'm somewhat confused what a PSU is maybe I have another termonalogy for it. </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that I have a creative sound blaster pci 128 and a video card brand new. </s>
<s> Can you somewhat break it down what I have to do? </s>
<s> If you replace the psu with another of the same type but higher wattage and the system won't boot, you have another problem. </s>
<s> The orginal psu as you mentioned in another post, allows a boot-up but shutsdown. </s>
<s> That seems to offer that not only is that psu bad but probably caused the mtrbd. </s>
<s> to fail as well. </s>
<s> In other words, the new psu is doing its job but the mtrbd. </s>
<s> isn't up to boot as the &quot;boot circuitry&quot; can't wake-up to latch onto power start, it failed. </s>
<s> Unles, you got some special psu unit(some older one) then a generic psu replacement should have worked. </s>
<s> That leaves either you got to a 2nd problem(mtrbd.) </s>
<s> or a bad new psu. </s>
<s> As the other poster mentioned, test on another system to see if the new psu is truly working. </s>
<s> When a psu fails besides itself it can take other componets with it, so beware of that. </s>
<s> You should try to make a simple system, remove all comonets and then boot-up with new psu. </s>
<s> Minium system, is only 1 stick(bank) of ram, kybd., video and maybe FD. </s>
<s> Add comonets untils it fails. </s>
<s> It if ails on 1st try then bad psu or mtrbd. </s>
<s> The mtrbd. </s>
<s> componets like ram, cpu, video all installed cards. </s>
<s> should be removed one at a time to see what if any changes take place. </s>
<s> PSU = power supply unit tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Otay Willy so what you're saying is I should bring it down to barebone... meaning... </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> Shoud I unplug cd drives, hard drive, FANS, LIGHTS ETC... and just test the mother board w the video card & RAM alone? </s>
<s> The system only has 1 stick of ddr 400 pc 3200 ram. </s>
<s> My motherboard holds up to 2 gb. </s>
<s> I found that I do have a loose screw. </s>
<s> Should I try afyer taking the screw out before testing it bare bone? </s>
<s> (WHICH I STILL DON'T KNOW THAT MEANS... LOL) </s>
<s> You can &quot;barebone&quot; if you like. </s>
<s> You can go further, by removing all ram and even the cpu out. </s>
<s> If the system starts anything, it should at least beep away at you. </s>
<s> That way, you know it wants to start. </s>
<s> You can add the cpu and ram to the test rest of componets. </s>
<s> There are no drives attached at all. </s>
<s> If you get no response, you got a bad mtrbd. </s>
<s> or either the cpu or ram is at fault. </s>
<s> Something is holding you back. </s>
<s> You can also remove the power AC plug, then attach when you need to power-UP. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks Willy. </s>
<s> You rock!! </s>
<s> Although this damn custom built computer shitzu!! </s>
<s> Is hurting my brain. </s>
<s> Anyhow, do you MySpace? </s>
<s> We all do. </s>
<s> My MySpace is http://www.myspace.com/shescreamsemo I am going to rack my brain working on this crap TONIGHT!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> LOL - glad Willy was able to help you out while I was gone, but I have to laugh as I live on the edge of Prospect Heights! </s>
<s> Anyway, good luck! </s>
<s> Post your results, or lack thereof! </s>
<s> Hey, I am experiencing the same problems as you. </s>
<s> You were thanking Willy just for his input or what was the ultimate solution for you? </s>
<s> Thanks much! </s>
<s> Very desperate need of help. </s>
