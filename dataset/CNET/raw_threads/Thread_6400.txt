On my Secondary IDE bus I have a Plextor PX-708A DVD burner (master) and a TDK DVDRW420N burner as the slave. When I boot XP Pro and try to read a PhotoCD (.pcd) in Plextor drive, it asks to put in disk , then it says can't read from disk. Yet when I put it into the TDK drive it has no problems. Now - I have played with htis and that settings, and finally I found that if I go to device manager and remove the Plextor drive, then have it search and install new hardware , that now it will act right, at least till I reboot, or if I follow the advice and reboot - it will work properly that instance as it installs the device on that cycle, but won't acknowledge the .pcd disk upon hte following reboot. Any ideas how I can fix this , or why this is happening - and only to my master drive?-- Harry JK of Reading, PA

Have uninstalled from hardware manager, adn rebooted allowing discovery of new hardware. Having done this in the past it had worked ofr that session only and not after multiple reboots. Today it si still working, adn I wonder when it will stop next?
