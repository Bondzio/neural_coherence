1.1.1	Greetings , I have recently decided to build myself a Desktop Computer to replace my current laptop since I no longer require mobility .	St
1.1.2	That said , it has been years since I built a computer from scratch and even then the machine was not built for any kind of real performance .	St
1.1.3	I have been spending some time searching across the web , evaluating needs vs. wants , setting my budget , picking out parts , etc. , and now I fall upon the graces of my online peers for advice .	St
1.1.4	On to the nitty-gritty : Purpose : The machine will be used primarily for Graphic Arts .	St
1.1.5	I work in programs such as Photoshop , Daz3D , Poser , Maya , 3DSMax , Illustrator , etc .	St
1.1.6	The secondary use for the machine ( and should probably be called primary ) is gaming .	St
1.1.7	Currently I play World of Warcraft , Rift , and Starcraft 2 .	St
1.1.8	I also do some work in Visual Studio .	St
1.1.9	Budget : I 'd like to keep it around or under $ 2000 .	St
1.1.10	Parts and Purchase : I am starting from scratch , with no preexisting parts and nothing currently purchased .	St
1.1.11	Where I buy from is of little consequence , though to avoid exorbitant shipping costs I would prefer to buy as much from one place as possible .	St
1.1.12	I am fine with online shopping .	St
1.1.13	Peripherals : Not needed .	St
1.1.14	OS : I have a copy of Windows 7 Pro 64-bit , but may be purchasing another Home version , not sure yet .	St
1.1.15	Cooling : I would like to keep the machine as cool as possible but am tepid about liquid cooling , any advise/opinions on this is welcome .	St
1.1.16	All of that said , as I mentioned before I have been looking for parts and have put together a list of what I think will take care of what I need .	St
1.1.17	But , whether they are the best part for my dollar is unknown to me .	St
1.1.18	I do not think I will have any compatibility issues , except perhaps with the SSD ( I 'm not sure on that one ) , but if you notice any glaring compatibility issues please note it .	St
1.1.19	What I 'd like is for any and all of you to pick my list apart and let me know your thoughts or any problems you see .	St
1.1.20	I am open to switching out any of what I have chosen for a better and/or cheaper product as long as everything stays within my budget and functionality requirements .	St
1.1.21	After researching , these are the parts that I am looking into buying : Case : Cooler Master RC-932-KKN5-GP HAF 932 Advance Full Tower Case - ATX , Black , SuperSpeed USB 3.0 PSU : Ultra U12-40841 X4 Gold Edition Modular Power Supply - 1000W , ATX , 80 Plus Gold , 135mm Fan , SLI Ready , CrossFire Technology , Active PFC , Vibration Dampener Included , Lifetime Warranty w/ Registration Mobo : ASUS P8P67 Deluxe B3 Intel P67 Motherboard - ATX , Socket H2 ( LGA 1155 ) , Intel P67 Express , 2200MHz DDR3 ( O.C .	St
1.1.22	) , Dual Gigabit LAN , 8-CH Audio , SATA 6.0 Gb/s , USB 3.0 , SLI/CrossFireX , Bluetooth CPU : Intel Core i7-2600K BX80623I72600K Unlocked Processor - Quad Core , 8MB L3 Cache , 3.40 GHz , Socket H2 ( LGA1155 ) , Retail CPU Cooler : Corsair CWCH50-1 Hydro H50 CPU Liquid Cooler - 120mm Fan , Copper Cold Plate , Aluminum Radiator , LGA775 , LGA1366 , LGA1156 , AM2/AM3 RAM : Corsair CML16GX3M4A1600C9 Vengeance LP Desktop Memory Kit - 16GB ( 4x 4GB ) , PC3-12800 , DDR3-1600MHz , 9-9-9-24 CAS Latency , 240-pin DIMM , 1.5V , Unbuffered , Intel XMP Ready Video : EVGA 01G-P3-1561-AR GeForce GTX 560 Ti Free Performance Boost Video Card - 1GB , GDDR5 , PCI-Express 2.0 ( x16 ) , Dual DVI , HDMI , DirectX 11 , SLI Ready SSD : Corsair Performance 3 Series CSSD-P3256GB2-BRKT 2.5 & quot ; 256GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive ( SSD )	St
1.2.1	To add a few notes , I have been considering other parts as well .	St
1.2.2	Please have a look and tell me what you think in comparison : PSU : Ultra X4 1050-Watt Modular Power Supply - 135mm Fan , ATX , Lifetime Warranty w/ Registration , 80+ Silver , NVIDIA SLI & amp ; ATI Crossfire Certifications , Vibration Dampener Included Mobo : GIGABYTE Z68X-UD7-B3 Intel Z68 Motherboard - ATX , Socket H2 ( LGA1155 ) , Intel Z68 Chipset , 2133MHz DDR3 , SATA 6.0 Gb/s , RAID , 7.1-CH Audio , Dual Gigabit LAN , SuperSpeed USB 3.0 , CrossFireX/SLI Ready Also , I 've left out the Optical drive just because they are easily obtainable and typically are inconsequential to the build itself .	St
1.2.3	However , in case its needed for compatibility and/or PSU load assessments in my build , the one I am looking at is : Optical Drive : LG WH12LS30K 12x Blu-Ray Burner - BD-R , 12x , BD-R DL 12x , BD-RE 2x , BD-RE DL 2x , DVDR 16x , DVDR DL 8x , DVD+RW 8x , DVD-RW 6x , DVD-RAM 12x , CD-R 48x , CD-RW 24x , Internal , SATA , 4MB , LightScribe ( OEM ) Lastly , all of the product descriptions I have listed are directly off of TigerDirect for any search questions .	St
1.2.4	I 'm not too concerned about storage on the SSD .	St
1.2.5	I only need about 100GB locally but wanted to make sure I had enough on there for overhead since I may store files locally for a brief time until transferred to a NAS device .	St
1.2.6	Thanks again !	St
1.3.1	Also consider researching about your OS , because you mentioned that you will also consider to buy a new home edition , it is much better if you install your 64bit , because if im not mistaken , 32bit OS will not maximize all your RAM .	St
1.4.1	Copy ?	Ques
1.4.2	of win7 , 64-bit is n't going to help you .	St
1.4.3	It may come back to bite you .	St
1.4.4	Get the OEM version ( DIY type ) and go from there and be done with licensing .	St
1.4.5	If you 're going to be pushing the PC , then absolutely go add liquid cooling .	St
1.4.6	While typical air cooling may suffice once you go liquid and it 's done right , its a real plus .	St
1.4.7	Unless , you find you really need 16gb of ram , you maybe better off with 8gb .	St
1.4.8	You can hopefully upgrade ram later to 16gb .	St
1.4.9	Even with your s/w demands , 8gb is still very capable , of course that can be addressed if the need arises , that 's up to you .	St
1.4.10	Last , use the SSD as a OS install rather than a pgm .	St
1.4.11	tool area of work .	St
1.4.12	SSD have weakness in repeated use of R/W and persistent use of the same data locations can spell bad news later .	St
1.4.13	However , some pgms .	St
1.4.14	install will only default to drive & quot ; C & quot ; , if you can install elsewhere , do so .	St
1.4.15	I meantion that as thre SSD will get loaded pretty quick if no attention here .	St
1.4.16	This is a known problem ( google on topic ) , but has been addressed .	St
1.4.17	High-end SSD drives that are hi-perf types and/or latest do well .	St
1.4.18	I still recommend a typical HD to do the real grunt work you plan to do .	St
1.4.19	tada -- -- -Willy & lt ; div & gt ; & lt ; div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.5.1	I probably should have been a bit more specific about the OS .	St
1.5.2	I have a legitimate ( MSDN ) copy of Windows 7 Pro 64-bit that I have not used , the reason why I lean toward using it is for networking purposes ( setting up RDP and the like ) that a Home version will not allow you to do .	St
1.5.3	As for mentioning & quot ; another & quot ; Home copy , I currently have Win7 Home Premium ( 64-bit ) that came on my Alienware M15X laptop that I bought some time ago .	St
1.5.4	Apologies for any confusion on that strand , I merely mentioned the OS so you 'd know what I planned to operate on .	St
1.5.5	As for my choice on the 16GB of RAM , that was just a price-point decision .	St
1.5.6	The pricing I am able to get on the 16GB was not much more than what I receive on like-RAM at 8GB .	St
1.5.7	As for storage , I did toy with the thought of a smaller SSD to support only core necessities and using my NAS device for storage , I was thinking on the larger for those & quot ; uh oh & quot ; scenarios .	St
1.6.1	To add to the OS side of things , the Alienware one is n't necessasy going to work & quot ; if & quot ; you plan to use on the new system .	St
1.6.2	While the other OS supplied is OK , I hope it works well for ya .	St
1.6.3	keep any papaerwork in case you have issues later .	St
1.6.4	I also , like to comment on the memory , if that 's good , then that 's good .	St
1.6.5	I hope it works well for ya .	St
1.6.6	Now for the SSD , as I explained some SSDs wo n't last long if they get used extensively regrdless of how .	St
1.6.7	The nature of SSD is that repeated usage of the same area will cause a failure or a fault , thought hey are more robust than flash drives , the problem is often seen on these as well .	St
1.6.8	The whole reason for explaining this is that when they go bad , they just go , no clue they 're gone .	St
1.6.9	Please google on the topic of SSDs and find this out .	Sug
1.6.10	Nwer SSD released maybe better at handling these issues since the newer Sandbridge ( force ? )	Ques
1.6.11	releases .	St
1.6.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	Hi It looks good , but you might want to consider the X68 Motherboard .	St
1.7.2	It would be a good fit for that i7 2660k Sandy Bridge .	St
1.7.3	I did n't see anything about memory , but with graphics type stuff such as video editing and such , I would go for the max ( 1600 Mhz ) .	St
1.7.4	May be a bit of overkill as I think an 850w Corsair would be fine for that build with ample headroom .	St
1.7.5	I am running the same Video card in here and it is a good one to be sure .	St
1.7.6	As for the Corsaid Hydro H50 , if you must go that route , I would consider at least the H70 although there are some very good non liquid cooling solutions out there .	St
1.8.1	Yes , on the SSD , make sure that you get an SSD that supports the TRIM command .	St
1.8.2	You absolutely need wear-leveling firmware to play with an OS like Windows 7 that will issue TRIM commands when needed , like when large blocks of memory are deleted .	St
1.8.3	I have an Intel 160GB SSD , which I find perfectly adequate for a C : drive , I have another regular drive that provides a lot more storage for data , but is slower .	St
1.8.4	However , all my programs run off the SSD , which gives me a very fast boot .	St
1.8.5	I 've also turned off the paging and hibernation files , since they take a fairly large piece of SSD , and are not needed if you do n't hibernate and have a lot of physical memory ( so you 'll never swap ) .	St
1.8.6	I 'm very happy with my SSD , the computer boots and shuts down quickly , and programs come up quickly .	St
1.8.7	And given that I 'm always running out of physical memory , programs/games/apps run as fast as the cpu and memory speeds will allow .	St
1.8.8	Which is pretty fast these days .	St
1.8.9	Also , pay attention to your backup speed , make sure that you have Firewire , USB3 , Thunderbolt , or some fast connection for backup devices , spending a lot of time backing up is not fun .	St
1.8.10	One last thought , spend some time researching graphics/video cards .	St
1.8.11	There 's lots of benchmark results on the internet .	St
1.8.12	Given what you want to do , you 'll need a good , strong graphics card , so try and get what you 'll need first time out .	St
1.8.13	It 's very disappointing to find that you have a great system , but your graphics card just is n't up to what you need it to do , and have to go out and do that one over .	St
1.8.14	Only you know what you need your graphics card to be able to do , and what you can get for the money you have for it .	St
1.8.15	On the other hand , getting a graphics card that 's bottled-necked by your memory and CPU speeds is just wasting money .	St
1.8.16	So do some research , the facts that you need are out there .	St
1.9.1	Ths is just to clarify my post .	St
1.9.2	On the Memory , what I meant was the max memory running at 1600 Mhz .	St
1.9.3	As for the Bottle necking aspect , with 1600 Mhz memory and the i7 2600k CPU , that wo n't be an issue .	St
1.9.4	That card you have chosen , nor others will be bottle necked .	St
1.9.5	As I previously said , An X68 based board would be a good choice these days .	St
1.10.1	Why buy from this e-tailer when there are others out there with more competitive prices ( e.g .	St
1.10.2	newegg.com ) ; from the list of components you have provided ( although some are not available through newegg ) , there are far better choices/ prices provided by newegg http : //www.newegg.com/Index.aspx ? name=Home Second ; do not scrimp on the PSU , although Ultra may be tigerdirects best ( in-house ) brand , for the same money you should be spending it on a more reputable company ( e.g .	St
1.10.3	Antec , Corsair , Silverstone , and the like ) .	St
1.10.4	Third ; while others may argue that & quot ; all-in-one & quot ; liquid cooling solutions ( such as the Corsair H50/ H70/ H80 ) are the next best thing to custom water cooling , they are not .	St
1.10.5	These solutions are no better than a & quot ; lesser & quot ; priced air cooler .	St
1.10.6	Forth ; while buying a computer case is strictly a personal choice only you can make , make sure the case you get fulfills all your needs ... there 's nothing worse than getting into the nitty-gritty of the build , only to find that the case you 've chosen is more of a nightmare come true , rather than the dream you were wishing for .	St
1.10.7	Fifth ; I have to agree with Willy on the point of having an SSD , the point of having an SSD in your system is to make the O/S and other & quot ; key & quot ; programs run faster , rather than the & quot ; old-school & quot ; way of thinking , where the main HDD was for every program under the sun ... then using other ( internal or external ) drives for storage and backup .	St
1.10.8	Best to have a smaller SSD for the O/S and a few programs that are used often ; then get another & quot ; fast & quot ; drive for everything else .	St
1.11.1	I have to update my previous two posts as I mea n't the Z68 Chipset rather than X68 ( there is n't one of those , just X58 ) .	St
1.11.2	Anyway , TigerDirect is Fine .	St
1.11.3	I use both TigerDirect & NewEgg .	St
