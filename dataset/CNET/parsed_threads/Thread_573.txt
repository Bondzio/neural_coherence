<s> I have just set up a wireless network in my home and everything works great except that i lose sthe signal for my laptop on the second floor. </s>
<s> I have a 3com OfficeConnect Wireless 11G cable/dsl Router. </s>
<s> Does 3com make an signal extender for their routers? </s>
<s> I have emailed them but to no avail. </s>
<s> My house is made of solid concrete, I live in Mexico. </s>
<s> If they do not make that product what would be my best option for use of my laptop on the second floor? </s>
<s> Appreciate any help you all can provide. </s>
<s> up to the second floor is feasible, a WAP may be the solution. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> You might replace your router with one of the new extended-range units. </s>
<s> While the 802.11n standard is not yet out, router manufacturers are already producing units with increased speed and range. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You might use a high-gain antenna, either purchased or home-made, with your present router. </s>
<s> (See www.freeantennas.com for more info.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If there is a place on the second floor where you get a decent signal, you could place a wireless repeater there to re-broadcast throughout the second floor. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> There are units which use your power wiring to carry the signal. </s>
<s> You would plug one unit into a power outlet near the wireless router, and another into a power outlet on the second floor to re-broadcaast there. </s>
<s> You can Google these options for more information. </s>
<s> BTW, while it might be desirable for an extenderto be from the same manufacturer as the router, it is not usually necessary if they adhere strictly to the 802.11g standard. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>

<s> I would try the belkin pre-n. </s>
<s> It seems to have excellent range and is quite powerful. </s>
<s> Read the cnet reviews but pay the most attention to the user reviews. </s>
<s> I use a powerline bridge for extending my wireless network. </s>
<s> Belkin and a few others have what is called homelink which is basically a bridge the lets you send your network further using the house 120VAC wiring. </s>
<s> I use one unit by my router and one in my shop, which is about 150 ft away and has metal walls, in the shop I have a 2nd wireless router/access point. </s>
<s> I have suggested this for use in some large homes and they have worked well. </s>
<s> you can get a range extender from walmart! </s>
<s> it is a name brand linksys unit! </s>
