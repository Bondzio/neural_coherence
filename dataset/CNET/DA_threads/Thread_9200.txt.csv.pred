1.1.6	I changed my speakers , checked the wires & everything .	St
1.1.7	Then I thought maybe it 's the driver so I got into the Windows Update website & it showed that I have a newer driver available & I decided maybe that would be the key to this but nope after that I got a yellow exclamation mark next to & quot ; C-Media AC97 Audio Device & quot ; in device manager .

1.1.14	What is going on ?	Ques
1.1.15	How can I get my sound back ?	Ques
