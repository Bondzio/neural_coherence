hi everybody, specs: computer model number: hp pavillion ze4610us os: win xp home edition router: linksys wireless-g 2.4 ghz model:wrt54g i purchased linksys router in order to network my desktop pc and my laptop to be on the internet at the same time using my dial up isp.
i didn't realize that my router does not support the server for dial up connection.
linksys rep further told me that i still could network both computers at a local level but i wouldn't be able to use the dial up connection as a gateway.
he told me that i could do it through win xp networking software but he was not allowed to tell me how seeing he works for linksys etc.
please help!.
i need to know if there is anything i need to purchase in order to network both computers together to run the same dial up connection?
thanks for all your help in advance.
