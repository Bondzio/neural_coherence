<s> Ok, i have networked before and never had this much problem. </s>
<s> The house that i am networking uses BellSouth FastAccess DSL with a Westell modem. </s>
<s> I am trying to add a Linksys Wirless B Router to the house. </s>
<s> Connecting one computer wired and two others via wireless cards. </s>
<s> I set up the DSL on a Dell computer and began connecting. </s>
<s> It didnt work so i called BellSouth and they said that i had to configure the modem to work with Bridged Networking from PPPoep. </s>
<s> I did everything the guy said and it still doesnt work. </s>
<s> I have used the same router at my house with a cable modem and it works great! </s>
<s> So i would think it has to be something with Westell, Bellsouth, or can it be something wrong with the Router? </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> Anyone use bellsouth and have networked it? </s>
<s> Ever ran into something similar? </s>
<s> Thanks Tyler </s>
<s> I have the router do the login and NOTHING on the clients except have Windows &quot;obtain an address automatically&quot;. </s>
<s> Nothing in your post about configuring the router... Bob </s>
<s> i had it on obtain the ip automatically. </s>
<s> i made sure the DHCP server was enabled. </s>
<s> i set it up like i did the last time i networked some computers. </s>
<s> like you said, i find it very odd. </s>
<s> After it didnt work i reseted the router to the defaults-and still nothing. </s>
<s> i thought it might be the PC so i ran the network wizard and ran home and small business networking. </s>
<s> NOTHING. </s>
<s> i started to run the disk that linksys gave me(suppossed to not be required to run) but it kept giving me error about not being able to reach the internet. </s>
<s> Thats because the modem is still in the single user setting. </s>
<s> (which i had to put it in to run the linksys program so it could access the internet. </s>
<s> then i hooked the router up like it said(maybe i should have put the setting back to &quot;bridged&quot; in the modem.) </s>
<s> im a slightly confused as to what needs to be done. </s>
<s> Tyler </s>
<s> Have you tried setting the router to report the original computer's MAC address? </s>
<s> That's the only way I could get mine to work with DSL here (Telus, BC). </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> i'm having almost the same exact problem with the same exact modem and using dell (see &quot;immediate assistance...&quot;). </s>
<s> wonder if it is the modem? </s>
<s> i was using usb connection prior and worked fine. </s>
<s> i searched it out on the internet. </s>
<s> The bellsouth tech was no help and knew nothing. </s>
<s> Set the modem to Bridging Ethernet. </s>
<s> Set the router to PPPoE. </s>
<s> Type in user name (ex: username@bellsouth.net). </s>
<s> Type password. </s>
<s> Click Status to make sure it is connected. </s>
<s> Reboot computer. </s>
<s> Router has to be PPpoE not auto find. </s>
<s> Tyler p.s. </s>
<s> the power of google is amazing. </s>
<s> &quot;Westell+Linksys&quot; gave me my info try for yours </s>
<s> I had to call Linksys tech support and they refered me to a web site that automatically set the proper settings on the router. </s>
<s> My system is running smoothly now.I think the website was www.linksys.com/connect, but I would call the tech support number in your manual. </s>
<s> Verizon tech support gave me the wrong information three different times. </s>
