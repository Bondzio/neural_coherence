1.1.1	Summary - Windows XP Pro SP3 will not install when APIC is enabled in bios .	St
1.1.2	Hardware - Asus M4A785-M ( flashed to latest BIOS version of 1006 ) , 2 sticks of 1GB DDR2 800 from G.SKILL , GeForce 8400GS 512MB video card in the PCIe 2.0X16 slot , Athlon II X4 640 3.0 GHz 95W processor , hard drive connected via SATA , 480W power supply .	St
1.1.3	Details - I originally had this system running with a Sempron processor without any problems .	St
1.1.4	I then upgraded to the Athlon II Quad Core .	St
1.1.5	Everything seemed to be okay for a while ( although I never did check to see if all 4 cores were running ) .	St
1.1.6	I got a BSOD one day and the system would not boot ( even into safe mode ) without a BSOD .	St
1.1.7	I noticed that the hard drive reported some bad sectors , so I backed up what I could and re-formatted and did a clean install of XP Pro SP3 .	St
1.1.8	When the system did its first re-boot during install , I got a BSOD of No_More_IRP_Stack_Locations .	St
1.1.9	I get this error no matter what I have tried , except for turning off APIC in the bios .	St
1.1.10	When I turn off APIC , XP will install correctly , but of course it installs as a Standard PC and only one core is active .	St
1.1.11	What I 've Tried - I originally thought this was a hard drive problem , since bad sectors were being reported .	St
1.1.12	However , I 've checked the hard drive with the manufacturer 's testing program and all was well .	St
1.1.13	I also have tried using a completely different drive with no luck .	St
1.1.14	That rules out a problem with the hard drive .	St
1.1.15	I also suspected bad RAM .	St
1.1.16	I 've tried moving the two sticks around into different slots with no success .	St
1.1.17	I also ran Memtest overnight without any errors .	St
1.1.18	That seems to rule out bad RAM as a problem .	St
1.1.19	I then turned my attention to the other hardware , and I 've tried removing all peripherals and the video card before installing XP Pro .	St
1.1.20	I had no success there , either .	St
1.1.21	I suspect the hardware is fine , as I can run a LiveCD of Ubuntu without any problems , and with all four cores running .	St
1.1.22	I tinkered around with various BIOS settings , which is how I discovered it was related to the ACIP setting .	St
1.1.23	The first thing I did was flash to the latest BIOS version ( 1006 ) , but no luck there .	St
1.1.24	I 've read that people have tried disabling legacy USB support and APM before install , but that did not work for me .	St
1.1.25	I tried using the setup defaults , and also turning off ACPI and PnPOS , but nothing helped .	St
1.1.26	The only setting that changed anything was to disable APIC .	St
1.1.27	I even tried forcing XP Pro to choose a different HAL during install .	St
1.1.28	I disabled ACPI and tried to force the MPS Multiprocessor HAL .	St
1.1.29	That gave me a different BSOD ( Bad_Pool_Header ) , but it did not fix my problem .	St
1.1.30	Overall , I 've tried installing XP Pro at least a dozen times trying different settings .	St
1.1.31	This has been the most frustrating computer issue I 've had , and I 'm out of ideas .	St
1.1.32	Right now I 'm running XP Pro with only one core of my quad core active , which is a big hit on performance .	St
1.1.33	I 'm also starting to get some random lock-ups , but I do n't know if they are related to the APIC issue or not .	St
1.1.34	If anyone has any ideas on how to get XP Pro to communicate with this motherboard when APIC is activated , please let me know .	Ques
1.2.1	Unless this XP Pro is some odd ball hacked version I have to take the errors as the sign they are .	St
1.2.2	Some hardware issue .	St
1.2.3	The 8400 video card is a known bad thing .	St
1.2.4	Try another card .	St
1.2.5	And also try Linux .	Sug
1.2.6	If linux fails we know ... Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	As I mentioned in my post , I do n't think it is a hardware issue .	St
1.3.3	I have removed the video card from the system and used the on-board video with the same results .	St
1.3.4	I also mentioned that I 've tried Linux - I can run Ubuntu with no problems whatsoever .	St
1.3.5	Any other ideas ?	Ques
1.4.1	I should also mention that the XP Pro SP3 disk is the real deal .	St
1.4.2	No hacked versions here .	St
1.5.1	You will be in an endless loop .	St
1.5.2	XP installs without such drama on good machines .	St
1.5.3	Sorry but this lesson is a hard one for some .	St
1.5.4	That is , there are folk that feel that Windows XP has some flaw that causes the above issue .	St
1.5.5	Yes there is that SATA hard drive support item but here , we are looking for something amiss with the machine .	St
1.5.6	Now that you 've declared it 's not hardware , I have to unsubscribe and wait .	St
1.5.7	bob	St
1.6.1	Bob , I 'm not necessarily blaming XP .	St
1.6.2	I just think that the processor , chipset , and XP are n't communicating when it comes to APIC .	St
1.6.3	It could be a hardware issue that Ubuntu ignores and XP does n't .	St
1.6.4	Maybe I have a flaky chipset or processor .	St
1.6.5	I do n't usually have this much trouble tracking down problems , but this one has me stumped .	St
1.7.1	Is not hard , just can cost us some coin .	St
1.7.2	For years I 've fixed these by swapping out the parts ( CPU , board , etc ) until we find the bad part .	St
1.7.3	But that 's the rough lesson for some new techs .	St
1.7.4	Once in a while you encounter the new tech that thinks it 's some bug in XP .	St
1.7.5	If it was , then what would you do ?	Ques
1.7.6	You found a workaround for the hardware so there are choices to either replace the parts or just let it stay with APIC disabled .	St
1.7.7	Bob	St
1.8.1	While you point out the APIC issue is the root of your problem .	St
1.8.2	That in turn suggests the mtrbd , which supports this feature maybe less than it should be .	St
1.8.3	Further , since it all worked before and now you have a new cpu of quad-core the chipset or mtrbd .	St
1.8.4	is lacking in its output .	St
1.8.5	You 've basically have found a Achilles heel or glitch because at the time of the initial release the cpu was n't supported or full support has fallen .	St
1.8.6	That mtrbd , if replaced ( with newer ) would probably resolve the problem and/or reduce the cpu core ( s ) and or demand less from it .	St
1.8.7	It boils down from your results , that the mtrbd .	St
1.8.8	just is n't as capable .	St
1.8.9	Of course , if it is some XP related issue , then going with Win7 install to see if that resolves it provided you want to go that route .	St
1.8.10	I also do n't recall XP supporting multiple cpu cores other than XP 64-bit version .	St
1.8.11	Even then the 64-bit versions had issues as well .	St
1.8.12	The 32-bit version would acknowledge multiple cores but used only 1 , again if I recall right .	St
1.8.13	That info was based on just dual-core , maybe quad-core is too much .	St
1.8.14	Add it all up and a glitch is found , IMO .	St
1.8.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	I think XP Pro supports multiple cores , at least with SP3 .	St
1.9.2	Otherwise , why would there be multiprocessor HALs included ?	Ques
1.9.3	I tried to force both the APCI Multiprocessor and MPS Multiprocessor HALs , but no luck .	St
1.9.4	You are probably right about the motherboard not fully supporting the X4 processor , or at least not supporting it enough for XP 's comfort .	St
1.9.5	So far I have n't been able to get anything out of Asus about it , though .	St
1.10.1	Not an issue here .	St
1.10.2	I think you are looking at a hardware issue or a bios one but the only new thought I have is the RAM speed seems low .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	Bob , what do you mean by RAM speed ?	Ques
1.11.2	The RAM is rated DDR2 800 , and I have it set to the SPD settings in BIOS .	St
1.11.3	Do you think it should be set at 1066 , even though it is n't rated for it ?	Ques
1.12.1	There 's another clue ( sort of like the sound of a shoe dropping . )	St
1.12.2	If you are manually setting memory timing it makes me think the BIOS is daft or the memory speed is not in sync with the new CPU .	St
1.12.3	The links I skimmed over seem to note 1066 as the bottom end speed to fit with this CPU ?	Ques
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	I 'm not setting the memory timings manually .	St
1.13.2	They are set at the automatic SPD detect .	St
1.13.3	Are you saying that you think my memory is too slow for the CPU ?	Ques
1.14.1	When I read & quot ; and I have it set to the SPD settings in BIOS & quot ; I thought you were entering in the timing .	St
1.14.2	Yes , it sounds a notch too low according to what I read .	St
1.14.3	Try this .	St
1.14.4	Head to the BIOS and enter the slowest settings for the ram possible .	St
1.14.5	I do n't hold much hope for that but all the above points to some odd BIOS+CPU issue .	St
1.14.6	XP does fine on quad core machines here and has for years .	St
1.14.7	While I 've lost count of how many I installed , the HP d4999t and d5000 we have at home ran XP without such loopiness .	St
1.14.8	Now they run 7 64 bit .	St
1.14.9	Bob	St
