so i tore it down again just to double-check the dust.
very little dust for such an old machine, no bugs.
fan worked fine.
i hadn't tested that before because i didn't want to run it without the back cover, but when i did, she booted just fine!
had to go back to a previous rebuild or whatever, but she worked.
then i shut her down, put the back cover on and tried again, no problemo.
but why?
