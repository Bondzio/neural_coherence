Have you tried back to square one, an OS restore, not use of a restore point?
Sometimes, its best to go and wipe out all in order to remove any possible link that the old restore points may have or don't touch on.
It seems this is the choice you're left with.
That trial s/w may have done damage that somehow remains to cause grief even though removed.
