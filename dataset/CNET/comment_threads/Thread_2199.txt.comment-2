the lower end had a 500mhz core, 1400mhz mem clock and didnt metion shader clock the high end had 575 mhz core, 1800mhz mem, and 1350 mhz shader clock if they both have a shader clock i believe u could buy an 8800 gts instead of gtx and OC and get the same results.i really dont think that 200 some odd mb memory is gonna make a diffirence.
