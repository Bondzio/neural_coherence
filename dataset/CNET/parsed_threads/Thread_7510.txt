<s> I have had difficulty playing music CD's that I create from Napster on my PC. </s>
<s> The CD creates properly and will play back in the other CD on the PC but when I take it to my car it takes several minutes to find a track. </s>
<s> Once the track is found it plays fine from then on. </s>
<s> CD's purchased at the store work fine in my car. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> It's a known issue. </s>
<s> Read http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq04.html#S4-23 I see that all I would want to write... has been written. </s>
