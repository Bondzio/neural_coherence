<s> I have an extra drive for the computer...and everything was fine, it was about halfway filled up I think? </s>
<s> Then one day suddenly I think I saw an error message at the bottom of the screen. </s>
<s> Now the hard drive doesn't show up on the computer, when I go to my computer it doesn't appear there though it is plugged in and on. </s>
<s> please help...I really hope it isn't lost forever. </s>
<s> You haven't said what type of drive it is; is it in an external box and connected by USB, or is it internally fitted ? </s>
<s> And you haven't said which operating system you're running. </s>
<s> These are the things I would try, in no particular order: If you have XP, call up system restore and roll back to a date before the problem occurred. </s>
<s> This should sort it out if the problem is with Windows. </s>
<s> If it's an external model, maybe you accidentally moved it to a different socket? </s>
<s> This can cause some devices to stop working and request software (drivers). </s>
<s> Either way there should be an indication in Device Manager. </s>
<s> Right click on ''My Computer'', then Properties, Hardware, Device Manager. </s>
<s> Open up the tree entitled Disk drives. </s>
<s> You should see two entries if you have two drives, more if you have other devices such as memory card readers. </s>
<s> If you see a yellow exclamation mark against your drive, you might be able to resolve the problem by uninstalling it (right-click it & uninstall), then close all the windows & reboot the pc. </s>
<s> If the drive isn't in the list at all, it's probably not connected properly. </s>
