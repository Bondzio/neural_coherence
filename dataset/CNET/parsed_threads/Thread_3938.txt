<s> Alright, I've heard differing answers to this, and I've never upgraded a processor, so I'm in need of an answer. </s>
<s> On a Windows PC, do you have to reinstall Windows if you upgrade the processor? </s>
<s> A good example is when we go from single core to dual core CPUs. </s>
<s> There are articles to check if Windows is set proper for that change but as you can imagine Windows is rather dumbfounded at this change. </s>

<s> Like it has been said it depends on how big of change you is made. </s>
<s> Going from a P4 2.8 to a 3.0 probably wouldn't effect it. </s>
<s> Going from a P4 to a PD or more could. </s>
<s> Windows XP knows what your hardware is and when to big of change happens it doesn't like it. </s>
<s> Usually this has more to do with graphics, but the processor could be effective. </s>

<s> I've got a friend who wanted me to do a few updates to his eMachines computer. </s>
<s> It currently has a Celeron D processor, and he bought a Pentium D 805. </s>
<s> They're both LGA 775, so that's not a worry, and I believe the mobo can handle the upgrade without a BIOS update. </s>
<s> However, he doesn't have a copy of Windows XP, and I wasn't sure if he would need to buy one or not just to upgrade his processor. </s>
<s> I've already done a few things to the computer, like upgrading the power supply and installing a different graphics card. </s>
<s> I was just hoping I could install the processor without reinstalling XP. </s>
<s> Here's a question: if I swapped the processors out, and it didn't like the upgrade, couldn't I just put the Celeron back in without any problems? </s>
