rsn (real soon now) is a devilish issue.
i'm going to tell you to wait until you can't wait no more.
i saved my neighbor's laptop about 5 times and during that time we saw the passing of those horrid pentium 4 laptops and the arrival of the centrino and more mhz to the ghz.
by hanging in one more year they not only extended their old laptop by that long but added 2 years to their next laptop's life by skipping what was then being offered.
when you can't wait anymore, then pull the trigger.
