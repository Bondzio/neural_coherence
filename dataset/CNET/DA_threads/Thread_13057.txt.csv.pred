Ques

1.2.1	OEMS would require a new os to as the hardware is only compatible with the factory os .	St
1.2.2	Also , drivers are n't standard , and would need to be backuped prior to the installation of a new os .	St
1.2.3	As for the ocmpatibility , just make sure the powersupply motherboard cable ( 24-pin , etc ... ) is the same on the motherboard .	St

1.3.1	Recently I have been looking at http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813127225 Recamended ( sp ) by a friend .	St
1.3.2	I was just wondering , do you think I would be able to use this problem free ?	Ques

1.3.5	Is it a smart buy ?	Ques
1.4.1	1 .	St
1.4.2	The OS is locked to the HP machine .	St
1.4.3	A surprise upgrade cost will be a new XP ( or other ) license .	St
1.4.4	2 .	St
1.4.5	The upgrade may tax the old power supply .	St
1.4.6	While this can be cheap many upgraders forget the stock power supply may not be up to the task .	St
1.4.7	3 .	St
1.4.8	Internal wiring .	St
1.4.9	While I do n't have much issue here some will give the market failing marks on how to wire up the reset , LED active , USB and more connections .	St
1.4.10	Usually by your second or so upgrade you 've learned your way out of this .	St
1.4.11	4 .	St
1.4.12	The OS wo n't boot on the new machine from the old hard disk .	St
1.4.13	If the upgrader is new , some confusion will happen and too often they lose their files .	St
1.4.14	Hopefully this list of possibly issues will help you avoid them .	St

1.8.3	And I recently started working again so I have a steady cash flow coming in that Im going to spend .	St
1.9.1	I had only opened a computer once before to install a NIC card ; I just decided to build my own rig since it would be completely for gaming and the ones from places like alienware are way too expensive .	St
1.9.2	There are many online tutorials that help you through the process of assembling your computer - it truly is not that complicated .	St
1.9.3	I got a lot of help from people on these forums and was able to get out for under $ 1000 , but the rigs value is much more than that .	St

1.10.5	The more specifc you can be ... the easier it is for users to make suitable recommendations , You 'll usually get plenty of comments .	St

1.11.4	The only thing that somewhat scares me even after reading stuff on the net would be the processor .	St
1.11.5	I dont know why but that just seems from what Ive read to be over me .	St
1.11.6	Most of my stuff would be coming from newegg and I always read the buyer comments just to get an idea of what they thought and if anything was bad .	St
