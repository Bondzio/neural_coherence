1.1.1	Ok so I 'm planning on wirelessing the house cause running wires on the stairs and through halls is n't working for me anymore ... .	St
1.1.2	But can I just get a wireles router and the adapters for the computers ( PCI or USB ) and/or labtops and be good to go..or.. do I have to have a WAP in each room where there is a computer as well as that computer having an adapter ?	Ques
1.1.3	Would it be better to have WAPs even though just the adapters will do in terms on signal and speed goes ?	Ques
1.2.1	& quot ; Ok so I 'm planning on wirelessing the house cause running wires on the stairs and through halls is n't working for me anymore ... . & quot ; Using WAPs means stringing CAT5 to them , so you do n't get away from this step .	St
1.2.2	A WAP in each room is a bit of overkill unless you are living in Buckingham Palace .	St
1.2.3	Try to centrally locate your router and see who connects from there , you may not need a WAP at all .	St
