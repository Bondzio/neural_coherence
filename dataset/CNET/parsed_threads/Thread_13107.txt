<s> I just installed a Radeon 9250 PCI stealth video card, with 256 megs of memory. </s>
<s> To my surprise, it does not seem to display video any faster than the Intel video that is built into the motherboard. </s>
<s> Other owners have commented on increased redraw speed but I cannot tell any difference. </s>
<s> I have downloaded and installed the latest ATI drivers. </s>
<s> I run a pretty standard clone computer with an intel 845g chipset, 512 megs of ram, XP home edition and a 1.8 ghz processor. </s>
<s> Is there some configuration utility or method that I am missing to kick this card into high gear? </s>
<s> PCI eXpress? </s>
<s> If yes, the PCI bus runs at half the speed or less than the AGP bus and is not a dedicated bus. </s>
<s> It is shared with other PCI cards. </s>
<s> However, I dfo know that ATI drivers can be a bear to install properly. </s>
<s> Sometimes there is only so much one can do to improve older computers. </s>
<s> In what program/game do you wish to improve redraw speed? </s>
<s> nowadays, video cards only differentiate themselves by how well they handle 3D games (Doom, Half Life 2, Call of Duty, Splinter Cell, Oblivion, etc.). </s>
<s> Outside of gaming, your integrated intel graphics are just as good as any other video card. </s>
<s> Thanks very much for the help. </s>
<s> This card fits into a regular PCI slot, so I suppose it can only work as well as PCI allows. </s>
