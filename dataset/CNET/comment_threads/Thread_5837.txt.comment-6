A drop of oil will help in the short run.
In the meantime, do that and then get your hands on a replacement fan.
The cost of the fan is pretty cheap and the reason for the fan in the first place is to help cool the system case.
The overall cooling allows your system to remain stable.
If you have a quiet system, then the fan is be noticable as a noise source, so buy a decent replacement to offers &quot;low db&quot; noise levels.
This maybe hit or miss as real cheap fans can work great but tend to fail quickly.
