<s> We are planing on buying a new computer capable of converting video tapes to DVDs. </s>
<s> We like the looks of Sony RS530G but can't find much infomation on how good Sony is on reliabliability and service. </s>
<s> How does this computer compare to HP and Dell computers? </s>
<s> In checking in Comsumer Reports we found very little information about Sony. </s>
<s> Have always thought Sony was the top of the line in their products and just wondered why we weren't seeing the infomation about their computers. </s>
<s> Your help in this infomation would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> (LIKE STEERS WE STILL TRY) </s>
<s> While I'm still smarting over a dozen laptops from Sony at the office, their DVD creation software is very nice. </s>
<s> HP and Dell don't offer this ease of creating a DVD. </s>
<s> Not a bad choice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Go with a company called Bunnie Computers. </s>
<s> I have their Hare performance pro, and I am in to the same thing converting to DVD. </s>
<s> Bunnie Computers has the New Pentium 4 Prescott that neither Dell, IBM, or Sony Has yet to offer. </s>
<s> This difference is; Dell (512kb L2 Cache) Bunnie (1MB) L2 Cache. </s>
<s> You do the math :o) Plus it glows </s>
