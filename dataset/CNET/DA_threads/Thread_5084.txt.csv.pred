1.1.1	I am wanting to use OpenDNS on my entire network w/o configuring all the computers .	St
1.1.2	The router I have is a D-Link WBR-1310 .	St
1.1.3	It is currently using the 1.04 firmware upgrade .	St
1.1.4	Changing the DNS server does not work using this firmware .	St
1.1.5	But I saw somewhere that 1.02 will work .	St
1.1.6	It is not on the D-Link web site , and I was wondering if anyone had any clue where I could find the 1.02 firmware ?	Ques
1.1.7	Or if there is another solution ( other than configuring it on every machine ) Thanks as alway .	St
1.2.1	You 're right .	Res
1.2.2	You ca n't even in 1.02 .	St
1.2.3	But you can turn off the DHCP function in that router and have your own DHCP server to hand out the IP and more information .	St
1.2.4	I decline to write how here since that 's in the TCPIP 101 course .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
