dust is a huge problem for me as i live in an agricultural part of australia.
airborne pesticides, sorghum & cotton dust as well as animal hair cause me to use compressed air, crc co contact cleaner and cleaning fan blades with alcohol soaked qtips at least monthly.
the idea of fittinga house air filter is looking very good...but costly.
