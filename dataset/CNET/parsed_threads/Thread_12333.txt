<s> Hi, My old powerbook G3 won't start, there's not even that familiar start-up sound, just a tiny tiny zzzzzzz from inside. </s>
<s> Sometimes not even that. </s>
<s> On recommendation, I did buy a new battery and also tried to reset the computer, which didn't help at all. </s>
<s> Since that, I bought a new iBook, but it's a shame that my favorite computer, that used to be a very good computer, just is gathering dust in my cupboard. </s>
<s> Any ideas what could be wrong with my old friend? </s>
<s> /Jimmy A </s>
<s> It's a Powerbook G3 with firewire and OSX 10.1 /J </s>
<s> The tiny zzzzz sond from inside does not sound too good. </s>
<s> It's possibly the powerboard that is the culprit here or even the PMU board. </s>
<s> I if resetting the PMU via the keyboard or the reset button failed to do the trick, try this. </s>
<s> Remove the battery, plug in the power adapter, reset the PMU and try to fire it up. </s>
<s> If you still get the zzzz sound, I fear you may have to accept that your old friend has departed but could be resurrected for a, quite large, chunk of change. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> ok, i tried it. </s>
<s> Do not get any sound at all, just this tiny zzz sound, which is so tiny that I might be imagining it. </s>
<s> Perhaps I shoud try to sell it as spare parts. </s>
<s> Its organs might make someone elses PB live longer. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
