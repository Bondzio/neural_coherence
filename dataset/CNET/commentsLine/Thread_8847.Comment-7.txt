the amd equivalent would be the athlon 64 3200+, which costs about $160.
amds are as reliable as intels, and they produce less heat.
i would get an athlon 64 3700+ san diego core for about $210 on newegg.
get a name-brand socket 939 board, and some nice ddr400 (amd doesn't support ddr2), and you're good to go.
about the tv tuners: i have no idea.
i had one in my pc, and i never used it.
when i want to watch tv, i watch it on a tv :p.
