Say I'm using the MyBook (with it's vast storage) for a central network data warehouse. RAID will help with redundancy inside the MyBook box, so if one drive fails, the other will have a copy of the data. But what happens if the whole WD MyBook unit burns in a fire? I need another unit just like it somewhere else. But terabytes of data don't transfer quickly on a 100Mb network. Do you have a suggestion for how to maintain a replica of this huge drive somewhere else?

What matters is that whatever you do, it should withstand and be able to help you recover from the disaster you plan for. That is, if your building goes down in flames, is whisked away by hurricane or is submerged by flood whatever you do withstands those disasters. Many forget the disaster plan. This means that at some point you have to consider off site storage of what you can't lose. Bob

If the hardware only supports transfers of 5MB/sec (40mbps) you're looking at 18GB/hr (432GB/day), not exactly zipping along - and certainly not enough to backup a TB drive every night. Am I thinking about this wrong? Is there technology that helps? Differential backups maybe? But you still need full archives from time to time, eh? Help!!

It's not as if you are creating 1TB a day so your sync or backup program should someday catch up. Look at SYNCBACK for example. It will only transfer the changed files. Bob
