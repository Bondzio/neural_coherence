1.1.1	i just got an hp pavillion a1510n, still not sure of what to think of it yet.	St
1.1.2	i was told it is compatible for all the new software coming up like windows vista, then of course i didnt have a computer at the time to confirm anything, considering i needed the internet to do that.	St
1.1.3	so if anyone knows how this model of computer will do in the future let me know.	Sug
1.1.4	And ill take any suggestions and opinions on what would be a good investment to boost my computer performance.	Sug
1.1.5	such as graphic cards, ect.	St
1.1.6	ect.	St
1.2.1	These two links should provide you an answer: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/evaluate/hardware/vistarpc.mspx http://www.pcpitstop.com/vistaready/default.asp?AdID=256892 Use and verify for Vista readiness.	St
1.2.2	tada -----Willy this opinion is mine and no political party supports it	St
1.3.1	ok thanx theres something that comes up saying i need to download a utility thing to take the test.	St
1.3.2	but when i need to know, and have the money for vista, ill know where to go.	St
1.3.3	thanx again	St
1.4.1	Yeah, d/l the sit, its not intrusive.	St
1.4.2	It will check your system and compare it to what Vista needs.	Sug
1.4.3	Understand also, that Vista will come in various flavours and need a *minium* to run for its most basic release, as more bells&whistles are added, sure it needs more.	St
1.4.4	As in OSes before it, I don't doubt that Vista(when openly sold) will run its own tests and see if it can be installed, thus the last test before installing for sure.	St
1.4.5	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	ok ill d/l that stuff then and see how it gos thanx	St
