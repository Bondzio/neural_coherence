remember that you don't get all those bits for your data payload.
some are used up in preamble, postamble and checksums of the data packet.
while 11 megabits may arrive at your pc, only 1/2 of that may be your data, the rest for bits before, after and about the data you needed to move.
this is why it depends.
as to your network, that issue is fairly well understood.
but your network looks too complex for me to offer any support.
it's bad enough with cable/dsl to router, but it looks like you have two routers.
such a setup is for experts to own and love.
