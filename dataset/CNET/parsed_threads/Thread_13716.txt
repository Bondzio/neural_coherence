<s> I have purchased a separate ADSL ethernet modem (D-Link DSL-300T) and a wireless router (Linksys Wireless G). </s>
<s> I would like to be able to access the internet from my laptop (which is wifi enabled)anywhere in the house. </s>
<s> All the manuals indicate that once the modem is connected to the router, I need to connect the router to my laptop using an ethernet cable. </s>
<s> My laptop therefore has to be connected to the wireless router with an ethernet cable, which doesn't seem very wireless to me! </s>
<s> Could someone please let me know how I can have the modem and router in one room, and access the internet from my laptop in another room? </s>
<s> A friend of mine can do this with his Mac Setup (a Mac laptop and Airport Extreme modem/router). </s>
<s> But to setup the router, a wired connection is used. </s>
<s> Once that's done it will run fine without the connection. </s>
<s> I wonder how you would get the internet without a network since the internet is a network. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> your wireless connection on the router? </s>
<s> If the laptop will access the router you're done. </s>
<s> Mine works perfectly. </s>
<s> Did the router come with any instructions? </s>
<s> Have you installed it properly? </s>
<s> Have you contacted Linksys? </s>
<s> But do not attempt any router maintenance wireless, use the cord. </s>
<s> Set everything up wired, then unplug and go wireless. </s>
<s> The computer that you desire to have connected wirleessly must have a wireless network adapter that is compatible with your wireless router. </s>

<s> Do You have any idea what a network is? </s>
<s> How can you have wireless internet (a network) without having a network? </s>
<s> If you would read your instructions... You connect your computer {via ethernet} to the router to perform the setup. </s>
<s> Then you disconnect the computer (laptop) and connect the router to your modem. </s>
<s> Enable your wireless adapter on your laptop, and you are good to go. </s>
<s> Note: If it still doesn't work correctly, try a complete power cycle. </s>
<s> 1)power off computer, power off router, power off modem. </s>
<s> ---Leave off for at least 30 sec.--- 2) power on modem, power on router, power on computer. </s>
<s> Just so you know: That is a network. </s>
<s> ''Do You have any idea what a network is?'' </s>
<s> ''How can you have wireless internet (a network) without having a network?'' </s>
<s> Sound like you have a problem. </s>
<s> He's asking a question ''expert'' and really doesn't need your -1cent. </s>
<s> Do you know what a phone is? </s>
<s> Answer that. </s>
<s> Any idea to apply this to prevent others from interloping? </s>
<s> its already set up and working....just cant figure out how to go back and apply this security.....i see many attempts to connect trend micro's thru my wifi detector. </s>
