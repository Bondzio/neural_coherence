The data rate of USB 1.1 is too low for DVD recording.
Let's attempt a DVD write at about 600 kbps?
That's about 4 hours.
A CD-R at 4x is some 700 MB that at top speed completes in about 25 minutes.
I actually see 30 minutes.
So at USB 1.1 and 4,700 MB to a DVD that would be 4,700 / 700 or 3.3 hours.
And this is if all went well... You'll want an USB 2.0 card since for a PCI card it's the cheap solution.
Here's one I used -&gt; http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=A-6202-4 Be sure to read more at http://www.usbman.com about USB 2.0 on the OS in question.
