I have an Intel 2.6Ghz which is working very well.
My temperature is ok but I still want it to be cooler.
It is always displaying 42 C and I would like to lower it.
I have not OC'd it.
I know that 42 C isn't a big deal, but I would like to have a more efficient fan/HS anyway.
I have three case fans (two exhaust fans in the back and one sucking air into the case on the side of the same).
Does anyone know about a top of the line fan for my processor in order to keep it even cooler?
I want a better fan/heatsink (NOT the thermal paste since I think that means that you can't get the HS/Fan off anymore) for top $50.
Thank you.
