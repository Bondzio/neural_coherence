i don't discuss dual video cards.
this is my choice on the matter.
why?
dual video cards are only for those that must go there and suffer the issues.
it's like a tar pit.
i don't go into tar pits.
hope this explains my choice on this.
if you need more power, use the first link and move up the chain.
then read the review on your selected card to sniff out if you need to replace the psu.
here i use the watt meter before and after along with the psu details on amperes per rail to make the decision to replace or not replace a psu.
