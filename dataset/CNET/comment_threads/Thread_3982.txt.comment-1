I have been in the market for a new computer and found a deal at Costco (item #470094) for a HP a6857c-b desktop with 23&quot; 1080p monitor, 8GB DDR2, Core 2 Quad for $879.
It has vista, I am a current XP user, and I am wondering if I should wait for WIN 7.
My current computer(Dell circa 2002) is working fine, but I really would like to update my technology.
Should I wait for a WIN 7 computer?
Will there be better deals on Vista systems as WIN 7 gets closer?
Thanks
