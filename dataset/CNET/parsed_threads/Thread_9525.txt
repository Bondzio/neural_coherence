<s> A Windows XP user is connected to the Internet through LAN with static addressing (192.168.0.0/24). </s>
<s> He connects to a corporate LAN (192.168.1.0/24) using VPN (PPTP) and gets a dynamic IP from a corporate DHCP server. </s>
<s> Question: is it possible to access the user's LAN from the corporate LAN through this PPTP connection? </s>
<s> If yes, where and how should the routing be set up? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> The corporate IT staffer should be handing out VPN client CDs that automate the entire process. </s>
