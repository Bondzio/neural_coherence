I was just about to buy a monochrome laser printer when I read a review that you need to replace the laser printer's cartridge or drum or something every 3 toners, and each cartridge costs just as much as the laser printer.
Is this true?
I need advice on buying a printer to be used when I'm at a university.
Honestly, I only need black ink, and there will be months when I won't use it since I will be on break.
How much maintenance comes with laser printers in comparison to inkjet printers?
How long do they last?
Thanks, and sorry for so many questions, it's just so hard to pick.
