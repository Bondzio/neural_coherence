Most motherboards are designed for a certain brand and range of processors.
This is due to varying types of connections, speeds, and connections.
Obviously Intel and AMD use different sockets, but within each there're different sockets, speeds, and features.
Also a processor is designed to work with a certain type of RAM (e.g.
DDR, DDR2, DDR3), so you'd probably need new RAM to go with the processor and motherboard.
So you're looking at $200 to $300 and you still have your old hard drive, ports, power supply, operating system, and probably no warranty.
So I know I'd just spend a little more and buy a new computer.
YMMV.
