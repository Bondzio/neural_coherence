DX10 is the breaking point to get Vista.
Well, it seems MS wants users to be more Vista ready and pony up the $.
Don't look for DX10 capable games to under XP, unless they provide a solution with their s/w bundle(not likely).
But heck, it still early since Vista was released and all the issues it imposes.
