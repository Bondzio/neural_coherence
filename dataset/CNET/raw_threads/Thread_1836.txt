Now there are some very important files on there and i was wondering that if i were to put that hard drive in my dad's pc, what will happened? his pc has XP and XP is also on my hard drive. i was wondering if there is a way i can just get the files out of there? because if i can just get the files i can then move them to my dad's hard drive and erase what on my hard drive and then add it as more storage to another pc

Copy what you wish, then do what you want. Your logic is correct. Good luck, Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.

One thing though. On my PC that got messed up i had accounts with password. Someone could not see someones else accounts(like thier desktop, documents, folders) will i be able to see them after setting it up as a slave?
