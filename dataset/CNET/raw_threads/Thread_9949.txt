Install the Linksys driver and when instructed insert the Linksys Wireless adapter. Otherwise suggest you do as explained in my other post.

Netgear: http://www.netgear.com/Support.aspx Linksys: http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support These maybe incompatible. You might make sure the drivers for these two pieces of hardware are up to date first. If you have a Internet connection download the new drivers to a USB and then through the USB to the new machine then try again. This thread untracked.
