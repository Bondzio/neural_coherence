I am having massive trouble connecting my new Windows Vista laptop to my ethernet LAN.
I can connect to the internet fine on all machines, but I cannot see any files on the Vista system from the others or vice-versa.
I'm using a Belkin F5D7633 modem-router, a Win XP desktop, a Win 98 desktop, and a new hp laptop with Vista loaded.
It could be a range of things.
But one simple question is: What does it mean when you cannot get a response when pinging the same machine?
My Vista system gets an answer back from the router and the Win98 PC, but not itself.
Thanks, mt64ed
