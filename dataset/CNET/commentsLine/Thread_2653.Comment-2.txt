said protection dongles rarely use the virtual parallel port but read the port directly.
if this was me i would have tried a pc-card parallel port first since i know the limitations of usb parallel ports.
then again i don't know if your laptop is pc-card or express.
for one company product we had to return the old parallel port dongle for a new spiffy usb one.
that fixed our issue.
the bottom line is that the software company should offer this support at bare minimum and if they have gone away then what happens when the dongle is lost, stolen or blown?
i hope you have a plan.
