1.2.1	is by far the best budget gpu on the market .	St
1.2.2	you will , although there are people here that did n't , upgrade your psu .	St
1.2.3	it will make sure your system has all the power you need because the 6600GT requires at least 350w and your emachine has 300w .	St
1.2.4	look at antec , ozc , and enermax and in the range of 400w+ .	St
1.2.5	you would have to purchase the tv tuner separately , and i am not fond on those , so maybe someone else can help you .	St
1.2.6	enjoy your new gpu , and your huge monitor !	Polite
