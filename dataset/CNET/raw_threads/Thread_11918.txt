1375	0	97105	1105293	NR	Big Steve	4/6/05 7:08 PM	1.11281448E12	Browser hijacked; virus hit old PC, need to buy new PC.	My browser and PC were both hit last week; browser was hijacked; PC was hit by viruses; PC took 15 hits last week; thought my Norton was working; must not have been. Sent all 15 hits to Norton for analysis; all 15 hits were listed as having adware components. Unable to repair; have been advised by others to buy a new PC; trash the old one since I can't seem to repair the damage. Would like recommendations on a basic entry level new desktop PC; nothing from Dell since I have issues with their tech support for home office PC's plus all of the negative feedback I've read in other forums about Dell and their company's poor customer service and tech support. I would be using my new PC to do word processing; email; internet and home finance. I'm not into computer games or digital photography. Would also like to know what new security software I should have installed on any new PC before connecting it to the internet. I want to avoid a repeat of what has just happened to my old PC last week which seemed to be running fine on WIN 95 until these attacks took place last week. Big Steve End Of Message 04/06/05

I have Norton AV 2004 installed but haven't been able to receive any live updates for quite sometime. What could possibly be causing me to not be able to receive any of Norton's live updates? I have had no success in contacting Norton for an explanation and my AV subscription is scheduled to expire in nine days. Big Steve End Of Reply 04/10/05

1375	9	97105	1115523	1114831	jcd	4/11/05 8:20 AM	1.1132076E12	Agreed	Do a clean install; install a firewall and Av and Spybot, Adaware, MS antispy, spywareguard and spywareblaster,CWshredder and Crapcleaner before you go on internet. New Pc WHY?
1375	10	97105	1116404	1114831	Big Steve	4/11/05 3:42 PM	1.11323412E12	Browser hijacked; viruses hit old PC; can't seem to repair;	When you say simply re-install Windows which in my particular case would be Windows 95; do you mean by use of the Windows 95 CD? My brother gave me this computer as a birthday gift 6 years ago come this June 2005 and unfortunately a Windows 95 CD wasn't included with it so that would be a problem; correct? I've got my eyes on that new Emachine T6212 I think; that might not be the correct model number. Since I know basically nothing about the workings of a computer; if I do decide to buy that Emachine; should I also consider purchasing an extended warranty or not? If so for how many years? Please advise. Big Steve End Of Reply 04/11/05

Without reading all the fine print, I think this means it is two years in addition to the 12-month factory warranty. It's really a &quot;peace of mind&quot; thing, a form of insurance like any other insurance. I guess it all comes down to how long you will keep, and be happy, with the system. You might be ready to dump it in a year. Or maybe not. Regardless, it looks terrific. Pick up a nice flat-panel monitor and you're good to go.
