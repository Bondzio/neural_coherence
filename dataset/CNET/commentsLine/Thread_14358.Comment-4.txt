yea i assembled everything at once :/ power led is the one on the motherboard i have speakers/sound blasters the 'speaker' 4-pin front panel connector is just not there i can't explain it, the case didn't even come with a manual... i'm going to try what you said.
atleast i don't have to swap the hdd and drives to do that would be a pain.
