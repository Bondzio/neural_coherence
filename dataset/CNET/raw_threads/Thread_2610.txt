But as it still has a little life in it, anyone know if it's possible to bride the Netgear to Linksys so extend wireless range? I've also wondered if a MacAirport could be used for the same purpose? Or do I have to stick with Netgear? Thanks in advance for any ideas.

The same networking principles should apply to connecting two different routers, but there is no guarantee of success. *** Post the particular router models that you are using. Maybe someone has done this. It doesn't fit your situation and is more complicated, but it is possible to wirelessly connect two Linksys routers with the SAME 3RD PARTY FIRMWARE that is capable of implementing WDS. http://www.linksysinfo.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=7
