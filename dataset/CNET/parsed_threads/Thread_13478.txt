<s> Hi everybody, I wanted to buy a tablet, and until quite recently I had settled on getting the Apple ipad 2, 32 gb, wifi only. </s>
<s> I am a college student, and felt this was the best option out there. </s>
<s> however, I recently saw that lenovo released a tablet too, with, in fact, a digital pen, which i thought would make note taking in class totally awesome. </s>
<s> I don't know what the lenovo is like, so was wondering if i should stick to the tried and tested apple, or go ahead and buy the lenovo. </s>
<s> or, should I wait for a couple of months to see if an apple ipad 3 is released anytime soon? </s>
<s> thanks guys </s>
<s> As to the iPad 3 question it's not uncommon for the unit to ship then folk ask when the iPad 4 will come out. </s>
<s> If the product is not what you want, don't buy it. </s>

<s> This is the best Android Tablet out there and very capable of word processing with the optional Keyboard all for less than the price of an iPad 2. </s>
<s> But really I suggest a laptop or desktop if it's your only computer. </s>
<s> Lenova Tablet with a DIgital Pen is really good for a student. </s>
<s> But I heard the device id not 100% perfect. </s>
<s> So research completely before buying it. </s>
<s> I think samsung Galaxy Is the best option for student. </s>
<s> He is very comfert for student...... ---------------------------------------- Visit [URL=http://www.facebook.com/snsindia]Sarkari Naukri [/URL] On Facebook </s>
