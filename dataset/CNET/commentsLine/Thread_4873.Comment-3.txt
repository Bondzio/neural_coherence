i hear what you're saying but the budget won't stretch that far!
is there any kit which might achieve what i'm looking for?
i imagine others will have considered this as it would seem to be an obvious solution to centrally accessing media files for viewing on the telly.
a lot of modern tvs have pretty good built in media players.
but is it possible?
