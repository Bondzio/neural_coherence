I was wondering if someone could help me out with a question concerning how much memory my ancient PC can handle. &quot;ASUS&quot;, the motherboard manufacturer states that it can handle 2 GB's of DDR 2100 but my SONY owners manual states that it can only handle 1 GB, (which I already have installed). So my basic question is. Should I listen to my SONY manual or the ASUS motherboard info.? SONY PCV-RX650 1 GB of DDR 2100 system memory 80 GB Primary HD 235 GB Slave drive ATI Radeon 9250 GPU with 256 MB's of dedicated ram Thank you for any info., someone could give me.
