you obviously cannot enable and configure a RAID array and use the hardware RAID with one OS and software with the other.
I don't know Ubuntu or whether a software solution is available.
One thing that would bother me about both being software RAID, if possible, is wondering if any interaction of either OS with the other partition might break it.
I gave up on RAID a couple years ago so am not the best to ask about current technology.
