1.2.1	Machines with 1.0GB RAM?	St
1.2.2	I see you didn't tell much about your PC.	St
1.2.3	Why make others ask you for that?	Sug
1.2.4	In other words why not make your first post a good one?	St
1.3.1	i need help.	St
1.3.2	.	St
1.3.3	why cant I open the turbo c in my computer.	St
1.3.4	.	St
1.3.5	instead it tells me that &quot;16 bit DOS SUBSYSTEM&quot;.	St
1.3.6	.	St
1.3.7	any body?	St
1.3.8	.	St
1.3.9	.	St
1.3.10	please.	St
1.3.11	.	St
1.3.12	I realy need a reply.	St
1.3.13	.	St
1.4.1	even .	St
1.4.2	.	St
1.4.3	me .	St
1.4.4	.my computer tells me that&quot;16 bit DOS SUBSYSTEM, , but i guess.	St
1.4.5	.	St
1.4.6	theres better way for that.	St
1.4.7	.	St
1.4.8	why don't you try to find a newer version in turbo c which can run in 32 bit DOS SUBSYSTEM.	Sug
1.4.9	.	St
1.4.10	Im already doing it right now.	St
1.4.11	.	St
1.4.12	.	St
1.5.1	Time after time I see the OS damaged.	St
1.5.2	You didn't tell too much so all I can offer is http://www.google.com/search?q=16+bit+DOS+SUBSYSTEM Bob	St
1.6.1	In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C I read that the latest version is from 1990.	St
1.6.2	Are you sure it's compatible with Windows XP?	St
1.6.3	I've got my doubts.	St
1.6.4	My suggestion is to find another (compatible) C-compiler or a another (compatible) OS, like MS DOS 6.0 or thereabout.	St
1.6.5	But that might not run on current hardware.	St
1.6.6	Kees	St
1.7.1	I can vouch for that.	St
1.7.2	However the subsystem error is caused by malware most of the time.	St
1.7.3	Sometimes I find it's an owner with registry and other cleaners but it is often fixable.	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Q: write a program tha asks for values from the user and find out which number was entered the most number of times (mode) and how many times this number was enetered.	St
1.8.2	assumed that the numbers entered are postive and in increasing order.	St
1.8.3	example: 112222233-1, display the mode is 2 and its frequency is 5 hope you can help me... tnx a lot in advanced..	St
1.9.1	i have been ecountered that problem before.	St
1.9.2	but actually you just use for loop and array.	St
1.9.3	that's all i can remember.	St
1.10.1	homework and school assignments here.	St
1.10.2	That's something you must do yourself: learning by doing.	St
1.10.3	Be sure your program had a good way of handling: - empty input (just return) - invalid input (like @1A' or 877) - short input (like 0) unless, of course, you're allowed to interpret &quot;assumed&quot; or &quot;assume&quot; as &quot;There's no need to check it and the program may give erroneous result or reach an abnormal end if these precondition isn't met&quot;.	St
1.10.4	Ask your teacher.	St
1.10.5	A few more remarks: - The suggestion above of using an array is useful, but - given the order - not necessary.	St
1.10.6	It should work without array also.	St
1.10.7	- The assignment is about numbers (each on it's own line until you enter a negative one).	St
1.10.8	Your input example is about digits (all on one line and ending with a non-digit).	St
1.10.9	- Is it necessary to handle floating point numbers (like 3.14 or 3.14E13) or can it be assumed the numbers are positive integers?	St
1.10.10	Kees	St
1.11.1	Hellow, , i just want to ask a favor.	St
1.11.2	.	St
1.11.3	i realy need this code on how to make a command to printer using turbo c. .	St

1.11.5	.	St
1.11.6	please submit your post asp.	Sug
1.11.7	.	St
1.11.8	Thanks	Polite
1.12.1	I don't think this is a good question for a forum that's listed under Hardware in the index.	St
1.12.2	Moreover, it's not clear if you mean c or c++ (that should make a difference for the coding you need).	St
1.12.3	And can you tell more about what you mean &quot;make a command to printer&quot;.	St
1.12.4	Please repost with this additions in Computer Help.	St
1.12.5	Kees	St
1.13.1	Did you go to Krugle.com and see if it's there?	St
1.14.1	Hi I am snjay and I have problem with running C programing with AMD Athlon 2.60 GHz Processor, what should I do for run the C program with same processor.please help.	St
1.15.1	Since Turbo C was DOS based you can now get Microsoft's Virtual PC and run DOS in that and Turbo C will run in the VPC.	St
