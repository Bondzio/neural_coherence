1.1.1	Hi all ! !	St
1.1.2	First post here .	St
1.1.3	I have an Asus Pk53 Deluxe Mobo Newegg.com - ASUS P5K3 DELUXE/WIFI-AP LGA 775 Intel P35 ATX Intel Motherboard - Intel Motherboards with 4 , 1GB chips of Team Xtreem DDR3 1333 RAM http : //www.teamgroup.com.tw/teamgroup/en/productDetail.php ? pd_id=2 & pl1_id=1 & pl2_id=1 I just bought a pack of Kingston 4GB ( 2 x 2GB ) 240-Pin DDR3 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820134792 to replace 2 of my old RAM chips ( eventually Id like to replace all of my old 1gb chips for 2gb chips and have 8gb total RAM ) but am having freezing problems , restarting issues , and an error just before Windows starts loading : Overclocking failed !	St
1.1.4	Press F1 to enter Setup or F2 to load defaults and continue .	St
1.1.5	Hitting F2 has so far worked .	St
1.1.6	My computer doesnt freeze , and the performance increase with the 2 extra gb is noticeable .	St
1.1.7	The problem with that is that if i try to restart my computer it never restarts , the monitors dont even turn on .	St
1.1.8	I have to & quot ; hard shut down & quot ; with the power button , start up and hit F2 for the Overclocking error again .	St
1.1.9	I thought the problem might have been that the two different kinds of RAM dont work well together .	St
1.1.10	But then I removed all of my old RAM and left just the two Kingston chips and it still freezes my computer .	St
1.1.11	Everything still works fine when I put all of my old chips back .	St
1.1.12	Is my motherboard not compatible with the Kingston RAM ?	Ques
1.1.13	It says it works with 1066 or 1333 DDR3 RAM , 240-Pin .	St
1.1.14	Are there other specs I 'm not taking into account ?	Ques
1.1.15	Im pretty sure I have the latest BIOS update .	St
1.1.16	The default BIOS settings seem to set all Overclocking options to Auto so Im not even sure whats Overclocking and whats not .	St
1.1.17	And I dont really know enough to start changing BIOS settings myself .	St
1.1.18	Any help on this would be greatly appreciated ! !	Polite
