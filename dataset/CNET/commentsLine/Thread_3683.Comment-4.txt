sorry, but i don't know of a solution for you except to use a file splitter.
-&gt; did you just reveal that you don't have a backup?
in the latest version of macosx it's supposed to work better with ntfs than ever before.
but ask in the mac forums before you convert the drive to ntfs.
while conversion is not supposed to wipe the drive, imagine that a few were surprised with a clean, empty volume.
