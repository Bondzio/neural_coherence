I knew to up the voltage and correct the timings because I fixed many computers before, just never seen an issue like this.
I figured it out though, it was service pack 2, I reinstalled windows, this time X64 edition, loaded drivers, been running stable since, did memtest overnight no errors, then prime 95 for 5 hours no probs.
thanks
