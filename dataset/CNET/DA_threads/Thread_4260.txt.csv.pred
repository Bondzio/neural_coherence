1.1.1	I have an Hp pavilion a735w , AMD3000+ Processor .	St
1.1.2	512MB Ram , and installed a New ATI Radeon 9550 256AGP Card .	St
1.1.3	NOW when i try and play top end games ( or even Half Life and Duke Nukem MP ) when selecting New Game , the Monitor either shutsoff and doesnt come back on OR the system will restart .	St
1.1.4	I was told to Upgrade my ram to at least a Gig , install additional case fans .	St
1.1.5	I am also using original 250w power supply .	St
1.1.6	I am new to computer gaming BUT this is really irritating .	St
1.1.7	Also when Pressing Ctrl+Alt.+Del , you see the CPU Usage and when i window a game and open this up it shows i am using 100 % cpu .	St
1.1.8	Somebody please help .	Sug
1.1.9	I am on a Budget and i read this was good if on budget .	St
1.1.10	ALSO ATI Customer service SUCKS ! ! !	St
1.1.11	Thanks ALL who reply	St
1.2.1	either overheating or lack of power .	St
1.2.2	could also be defective card .	St
1.2.3	downloaded the latest drivers ?	Ques
1.2.4	clean out ur case or leave it open .	St
1.2.5	if still shuts off then probably because the psu is too weak .	St
1.2.6	doest this happen only when playing games ?	Ques
1.2.7	how bout if the computer was left on for say 4 hours ?	Ques
1.3.1	Your PSU is definitely too weak to run your system .	St
1.3.2	I would think you need atleast 300 or more ... Even my old P3 celeron with 384 RAM and a 9250 radeon takes more than 250 ... You need a better psu	St
1.4.1	It shuts off when playing some of the Higher end games NOT when i play like C & C , Half Life , ETC ... As for shutting down while NOT playing games , Sometimes .	St
1.4.2	When you run quite a few programs at a time , sometimes it will sometimes it wont .	St
1.4.3	BUT if just letting it run , NO .	St
1.4.4	I ran Limewire and let it go ALL night , got up in morning , Never shutdown .	St
1.4.5	Ive tried contacting ATI about this issue BUT every time i call there number is busy , and I 've already registered my Card online , I dont know where else to turn to .	St
1.4.6	Thanks again	St
1.5.1	Do you think i should also get some more cooling fans , just to be on the safe side along with the psu ?	Sug
1.6.1	250 watt is way to small/ get 400 watt or better	St
1.7.1	i just got the same card w/250 watts and the only time it turns off the monitor is in high end video games or when I was doing 3dmark video test .	St
1.7.2	I 'm came upon this thread as I was trying to trouble shoot the problem .	St
1.7.3	I have a 400 W psu , hopefully it works .	St
