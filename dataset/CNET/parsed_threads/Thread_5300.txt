<s> To all who can help plz do. </s>
<s> A couple days ago my PC got fried. </s>
<s> I smelled smoke from the back and my PC died. </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply but still won't boot up. </s>
<s> Pull the battery out and the plug and replaced them. </s>
<s> The power supply fan spins as well as the fan for processor but no video and no beep just a low tone. </s>
<s> I removed the video card and plugged directly to motherboard still no video. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can try b4 I end up just replacing motherboard and if needed the processor? </s>
<s> When this happens the power supply can wipe out all connected devices. </s>
<s> But try it with just a few parts such as PSU, motherboard, CPU and heatsink. </s>
<s> No cards or ram is required because we just want beeps. </s>
<s> And in closing some forget the ATX12V connection but this PC is not well described so that's a guess. </s>

<s> I have tried as described. </s>
<s> This is no beeps. </s>
<s> Everything remove except CPU PSU motherboard With 4 pin atx connected. </s>
<s> Again, I'm missing make/model and such but read the manual on how to clear the CMOS and try again. </s>
<s> Be sure to measure the CMOS battery because if it's too low some motherboards don't boot. </s>
