1.1.1	I have a d-link boxee box that I want to use to stream HD movies/tv locally and from the internet.	St
1.1.2	I have beeen looking at new routers like the Netgear N900 to increase my speed and throughput.	St
1.1.3	I would then go from: modem&gt;router&gt;switch&gt;boxee(and other devices)&gt;tv I need the switch as I have other devices in my entertainment system that require internet access.	St
1.1.4	My Question is even if I buy a superfast router ,will my through put be limited by the switch??	St
1.1.5	Thanks Robert	St
1.2.1	Than what streaming HD movies require.	St
1.2.2	No gain there.	St
1.2.3	HOWEVER the best fix is to not use Wifi if at all possible.	St
1.2.4	I picked up a powerline network to get away from wifi.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I will use cable from the new router to the switch and then cable to my network devices such as the Boxee.	St
1.3.2	My current problem is that I get constant buffering when trying to stream from the internet.	St
1.3.3	I was originally wi-fi and then ran a cable directly from my D-link 615 router but there were no improvments... That's why I figured that a new(faster) router might help ?	Ques
1.4.1	There are some things you can try NOW such as router defaults except what the ISP requires as well as turning off wifi for a test run.	St
1.4.2	I don't see the rest of the system and other details to note if it's the old Netflix at 6PM issue.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I am trying to stream mostly from the internet sites like &quot;watchseries&quot; on the Boxee box.	St
1.5.2	It is a constant problem, not time of day related..	St
1.5.3	When you say &quot;that 615&quot; is that a bad thing??	St
1.5.4	ps thanks for the fast replys!!!	Polite
1.5.5	If you were buying a switch, what would you choose for this application?	St
1.6.1	It can be site specific.	St
1.6.2	The 615 is a value router.	St
1.6.3	It would be fine most of the time.	Polite
1.6.4	Try this on youtube or better sites.	St
1.6.5	You should find the lesser known video sites to struggle to keep up with demand.	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	I will try tonight...	Sug
