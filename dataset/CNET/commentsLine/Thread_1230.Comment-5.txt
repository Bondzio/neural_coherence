hi there, system properties says that i have 2gb of ram while system info says that i have 4gb.
do you know of a way to check and see if more than 2gb can ever be used?
i know people who have added ram in their system and it allways shows in system properties for some reason in my situation it does not.
as i mentioned system info shows that i have 4gb as does the bios.
