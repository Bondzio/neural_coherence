&quot;the iomega hd does have automatic backup app&quot; backs up what you have on your pc/mac to that storage unit.
since you have two copies, one on the pc/mac and one on the storage unit it is not a disaster when the storage unit dies.
you appear to have changed something so you had but one copy?
