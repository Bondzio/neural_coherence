long story short i had to enable wpa 2 on my home network.
i've tried this once before bu took it off when one of my computers did not allow me to enable wpa 2 on it.
i have3 home computers: the main one is running vista and he other 2 are both xp (i know that doesn't make a difference).
and they both have wireless cards.
both linksys.
one is linksys wmp11 ver 2.1, and the other is a linksys wmp54gs ver 1.4. no the latter supports wpa 2 on its setup tab.
i am able to enter the password and it works fine.
but the other, the wmp11, is a older card and does not list wpa 2 in the drop down list.
however when using xp's wireless connection window, it tells me that it found a signal and that its wpa 2 encrypted.
so i open it up, type in the password, it shows a connecting window, and then just goes away after a minute.
no error messages, nothing.
and i still can't get connected on that computer.
i've also downloaded the patch from microsoft enabling wpa 2, but i can't seem to get it to work.
i've tried everything short of downloading sp 3, which one person said would help.
is there something i'm missing with xp's wpa 2 patch?
is there a way to do this?
(i'd but a new card but i'm short on money)
