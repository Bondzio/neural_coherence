As I understood you description you are using the parallel port?
IF this is so then you are sharing through windows?
If the above is true make sure that the firewall settings are set correct to let outside computers print to that printer...
I am not to sure how server 2003 works but I think that may be the problem...
If you need to use more the one computer the ideal solution is to upgrade to the internal web server, and just put the printer direct on your network.
Not only is this much faster the printer is always there even when the computer is not on.
Just a side note on the 500's, make sure you change the p-head too.
This can cause problems with the carriage later on if this is not done at least once per year depending on how much you are printing.
