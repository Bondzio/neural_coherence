1.1.4	File and print sharing is enabled on both and the workgroup name is the same on both computers , yet when I 'm on one computer and both are on the network I ca n't see the other computer .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas on what the problem might be ?	Ques
1.2.1	XPs built in firewall ( ICF ) may be the limiting factor .	St

1.3.1	I had the same exact problem when first hooking up new XP desktop through router to laptops .	St
1.3.2	It 's the firewalls -- as mentioned you have to disable the built-in XP firewall HOWEVER you must ALSO disable the Firewall in Norton Internet Security ( which comes preloaded in most XP 's ) .	St
