1.1.1	So I 'm pretty sure this is a PSU problem .	St
1.1.2	When I turn my computer on after it being powered down for a while , it will not detect either of my 2 hard drives .	St
1.1.3	I assume they are not getting any power .	St
1.1.4	I turn off my psu via the power switch on the back of the unit , then turn it back on ... wait for it to charge back up and start my computer up again .	St
1.1.5	Everything runs smoothly after that .	St
1.1.6	I have to do this procedure every time I want to turn my computer on .	St
1.1.7	I am fortunate not to have had either of my hard drives fail/fry due to this .	St
1.1.8	My question is does anyone know what is happening ?	Ques
1.1.9	Is the psu going completely down the tubes ?	Ques
1.1.10	And has does it keep from frying my drives ?	Ques
1.1.11	Is there a protection system that turns off all power to the hard drives if there is not enough power to give to them ?	Ques

1.2.1	& quot ; Enhance ATA ODD compatibility & quot ; at the maker 's support web page tells me your BIOS may be out of date .	St
1.3.1	I updated my bios to asus v.1704 .	St
1.3.2	I have waited a while to see if it has done anything but just now the same problem has occurred .	St
1.3.3	There is a beta version of a newer bios and another bios version that is in their ftp but not on the main site .	St
1.3.4	Should I update to those or is this a hardware issue ?	Ques
1.3.5	I saw on the asus site someone else with the same problem with the same board , could is be my motherboard going bad .	St
1.3.6	His post : & quot ; However , if I reset the CMOS by using the jumpers , my computer seems to 'remember ' my hard drives at this point .	St
1.3.7	I replaced my cmos battery but that didnt help .	St
1.3.8	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. & quot ;	Polite
1.4.1	You want the 80 CONDUCTOR type .	St
1.4.2	This is the last hurrah before we wonder if the drives have seen better days or if they never got the bios quite right .	St
1.4.3	Do you remember the bad old days where they offered a start up delay in the bios so drives could spin up and be ready ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	You can replace the PSU anytime to verify the power issue ( increase wattage and amps ) , if that 's the case .	St
1.5.2	You seem to have a & quot ; stuffed system & quot ; and may take awhile to come up to speed or simply be acknowledged by the bios , the 4gb of ram being suspect and 4 drives .	St
1.5.3	Very possibility all together abit too much at the start .	St
1.5.4	The beta bios update if it did n't ID what it does , stay away from such updates of any kind .	St
1.5.5	A bios update has to address an issue you 've encountered .	St
1.5.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	ive had this exact setup going for a year now and it has only started happening recently ... do u still think it might be b/c of 4 ram sticks , 2 hdd , 1 optical , vid card , and fans all needing to be recognized ?	Ques
1.6.2	if this is the case would changing any bios settings help ?	Ques
1.6.3	such as turning on the delay start up ? ... .	St
1.6.4	btw to Proffitt : i will probably be trying your suggestion soon and to everyone thanks for the input/advice .	St
1.7.1	If you had the same system for 1 yr. then you 've encountered wear & tear of the psu .	St
1.7.2	They do degrade over time because of heat stress and/or added devices , etc.. You get the picture .	St
1.7.3	Now , you 've added a recent bios update you may have compounded the problem , never use a & quot ; beta & quot ; version even the manufacturers offer its at your & quot ; risk & quot ; sorta deal .	St
1.7.4	Anyways , your PSU may no longer have the & quot ; phuuumf & quot ; to get things going as it did when brand new .	St
1.7.5	Take away some added device like the CD drives , 1/2 of ram and see if it starts more quickly or more often than not .	St
1.7.6	If the problem persists then you may have a mtrbd .	St
1.7.7	issue , which includes the bios .	St
1.7.8	HDs do go bad over time when mounted on top of each other as heat build-up is caught between the two and causes that sort of heat stress and cooks the electronics on them .	St
1.7.9	You see it can be anything , do n't take anything for granted , as you appear to because it worked for 1yr. , now it does n't as well .	St
1.7.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	i really dont know much about cmos or the jumpers .	St
1.9.2	I have never touched them to my knowledge .	St
1.10.1	So I just wanted to post that the problem is now solved after buying and installing a new psu : ocz 700 watt gamexstream psu .	St
1.10.2	Thanks for everyone 's input .	St
