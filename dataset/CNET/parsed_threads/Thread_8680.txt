<s> I'm already running one WD 250gb sata drive on my ECS K8M800-M2 (v1.0) motherboard, without any problems. </s>
<s> I've just bought another drive, a WD 160gb sata (WD1600AAJS 3.0Gb/s), and can't get it running. </s>
<s> It ought to be the simplest thing, I just plugged it in, but when I reboot I get nothing. </s>
<s> It'll sit there in POST and grind away forever and nothing happens. </s>
<s> I swear the drive is running, I can feel it in my hand. </s>
<s> Mine's an old motherboard so I remembered to set the 5/6 jumper to do only 1.5gb/s. </s>
<s> If I plug the new drive in, everything just hangs when trying to read the drives; when I unplug it, everything's fine again and windows starts up. </s>
<s> I've tested my SATA cables and the slots on the motherboard, they all work in any configuration I want when using the old hard drive; it's only when I plug in the new one that things fall apart. </s>
<s> It'll eventually go to windows, but windows won't see the new drive no matter what I do. </s>
<s> The bios and chipset are both updated. </s>
<s> My western digital hard drive utilities see only one drive, so it's definitely just not there. </s>
<s> I've gotten a dead drive in the mail before, but it was completely dead, not running at all. </s>
<s> This one hums like it wants to work...I just can't get it to cooperate. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Check the simple stuff first, any jumpers, cables tight/seated, bios enabled(for that port). </s>
<s> Now, it may be possible a bios update is required, if so check to see what the update does. </s>
<s> In other words, see if it addresses that problem or any other if known. </s>
<s> Since, you stated the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is older it may need more than one in order to keep up to date. </s>
<s> If any bios update, prepare for it, you have 1 chance as this is a serious step, proceed when ready. </s>
<s> To test new HD, mount it alone. </s>
<s> Remove current old HD, mount new on. </s>
<s> Set it up for use and have any s/w from WD that helps in this regard. </s>
<s> WD, uses the Dataguard setup s/w, get it from the WD support website if you don't have it and be sure its for your type/model HD. </s>
<s> Get the helpguide from support as well, it explains details. </s>
<s> Also, be ready it may need the SATA s/w from the XP CD if you don't already have that as a separate item(maybe). </s>
<s> Testing the HD alone, eliminates any possible boo-boo to the working HD and you're dealing the problem alone. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> What happens if you use the connections, cables from the working drive? </s>
<s> That motherboard only supports SATA I drives. </s>
<s> There is a bug in the chipset that prevents SATA II (300Mbps) drives from reverting to SATA I mode. </s>
<s> You can make it work by manually setting the drive to SATA I. </s>
<s> Most drives have a jumper or internal setting to accomplish this (for exactly this purpose). </s>
<s> See the drive manufacturer's website to find out how. </s>
<s> You may have to download a utility program (and find a machine to run it on) to set the drive up the way you need. </s>
