Tom, Intel's new line up of processors means the Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad processors have been end of lifed.
Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 are now available at retailers, Dell.com and HP.com.
Depending on your needs I would start your research at Core i3 but if your future PC needs are not fully known just yet and you have the budget I would go for a Core i5 based system.
Core i5 has a very cool feature called Turbo which allows the processor to speed up to complete tasks when there is &quot;Processor headroom&quot;.
What this really means if you are running an application that is single threaded (Core i5 can handle four threads) then the processor can exceed the stated frequency (speed) until the task is complete.
In some cases you can get another 1 Ghz of clock speed above the stated frequency of the processor, thus the Turbo.
When the task is complete the processor ramps back down.
You can only get Turbo on Core i5 and Core i7 processors.
Hope this helps TimWoodChip
