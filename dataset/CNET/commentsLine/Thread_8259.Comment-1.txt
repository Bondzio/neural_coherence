i am setting up a small office ie.
4-5 workstations and wireless network.
i need to have printing capacity as well for all workstations.
i am wondering if it is better to buy smaller printers for each station or to network them all to one bigger printer.
does anyone know how i could best research answers to this question?
thanks.
