About the bIOS, I don't know what your talking about, newbie here.
Anyway, the HDD didn't fail.
The problem is that since opening the case and un-plugging the HDD, it hasn't worked.
I doubt it was a coincidence that the drive failing the second we openned it, because it was making loud noise all month.
