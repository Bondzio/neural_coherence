<s> Need some help. </s>
<s> Have a 4 month old AlienWare X51, been running great until yesterday, it says it has no internet access. </s>
<s> The signal is there and its connected to the router, I have full bars. </s>
<s> But its saying theres no internet access. </s>
<s> My laptop, TV, iPhone, and Xbox are all working, no problems what so ever on the same network. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Geeez, I really don't mean to be flippant but I saw Alienware with an issue and could NOT help but have a little chuckle. </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong, Alienware makes some pretty neat stuff. </s>
<s> I would assume you have already checked out your network settings, etc. </s>
<s> , firewall, security settings and listed homepage to see that it hasn't changed. </s>
<s> Since all your other hook ups work I am suspicious as to the possibility of your system having picked up a bug of some kind. </s>
<s> You didn't mention any error messages re hdwe issues. </s>
<s> Of course you have likely looked in device manager to see if there might be an issue with the net adapter. </s>
