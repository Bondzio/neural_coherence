i will use cable from the new router to the switch and then cable to my network devices such as the boxee.
my current problem is that i get constant buffering when trying to stream from the internet.
i was originally wi-fi and then ran a cable directly from my d-link 615 router but there were no improvments... that's why i figured that a new(faster) router might help ?
