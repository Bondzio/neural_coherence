I use my PC to create music i have a P4 2.53 Intel processor with a gig of Ram from OCZ PC 2700.
With 2 120 Maxtor HD and my Motherboard is a gigabyte GA --xxx not sure but it has HT tech and 533 FSB.
I want to build another PC but what should i go with.
I am looking for a processor that can hand large file we all know if you use Protools or Steinberg Nuendo that recording tracks take up alot of processing and memory.
What would be the pes CPU P4 Intel or AMD ?
