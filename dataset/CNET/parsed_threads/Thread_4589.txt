<s> I have a Dell Dimension 8300 pc running Windows XP with a DVD drive and a DVD burner. </s>
<s> Neither drive will automatically play a CD or DVD when insterted into the drive. </s>
<s> This occurs both when I insert a game and when I insert a DVD movie. </s>
<s> Preciously, when I inserted a game, the computer automatically started the game. </s>
<s> And when I inserted a DVD movie, the computer automatically prompted me as to what action I would like to take (ie open with PowerDVD or Windows Media Player or Roxio, etc). </s>
<s> I am not sure what I changed in the system to cause this problem or what to do to correct it. </s>
<s> I can play a game if I go into the Programs menu and select the game icon after inserting the game disk. </s>
<s> And I can play a DVD movie by again going into the Programs menu and selecting the Power DVD program and then pointing to the drive. </s>
<s> But neither drive will play automatically any more. </s>
<s> The Device Manager says that both devices are working properly. </s>
<s> When I go into My Computer and highlight either drive and click on Properties, the Auto Play tab shows that I still have checked the option to have the computer &quot;prompt me each time to choose an action&quot; for both video and DVD. </s>
<s> I even tried changing it to the option where the default was to select a specified program (IE Power DVD or Windows Media Player), but that didn't work either. </s>
<s> Under Device Manager, IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers, Advance Settings Tab for both Primary and Secondary IDE Channel, it shows Device Type as &quot;Auto Detection&quot; and the Transfer Mode as &quot;DMA if available&quot;. </s>
<s> I mention the DMA settings as I was attempting to upgrade the firmware on my Sony DVD burner (Sony DRU-530A) and may have screwed something up in that process. </s>
<s> It was after I made this upgrade that the two drives would no longer autoplay a disk. </s>
<s> I was instructed to disable the DMA settings before executing the firmware update and then to enable the DMA settings afterwards. </s>
<s> I thought I performed both steps correctly, but I may not have. </s>
<s> And I don't know if this would cause the problem I am describing or not. </s>
<s> Once again, proving that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest how to troubleshoot this problem. </s>
<s> I haven't had any luck searching various knowledge bases. </s>
<s> I would be most appreciative of some help. </s>
<s> and in the autoplay, click restore defaults, should work. </s>
<s> I think. </s>

<s> See http://www.jsifaq.com/SUBN/tip6900/rh6952.htm </s>
<s> Thanks for the tips. </s>
<s> Restore Defaults did not work, but using the AutoFix utility did. </s>
<s> I greatly appreciate your help. </s>
