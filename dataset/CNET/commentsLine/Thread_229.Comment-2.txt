i see at  this was first available in 2005. any consumer grade printer is non-repairable for very simple reasons.
the minimum shop fee is over 100 bucks and a new printer can be had for less.
this does infuriate some folk so we know to not upset them by writing about this issue.
(oops.)
i see folk do sell used ones starting at 50 bucks so your choice to get another to take its place without issues.
