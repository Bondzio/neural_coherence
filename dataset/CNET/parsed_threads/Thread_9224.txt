<s> This is an annoying problem that has recently started to happen in our office. </s>
<s> The UMAX Powerlook II scanner is taking HALF A DAY to power up. </s>
<s> That's 3 HOURS and it greatly impacts on our work flow. </s>
<s> Below are the specs of the computer and the ADAPTEC SCSI card. </s>
<s> Computer Specs OS Name </s>
<s> Am assuming that you have tried reloading the scanner software? </s>
<s> Other peripherals work normally? </s>
<s> Printer, etc. </s>
<s> If you have not, uninstall the scanner and reinstall the software. </s>
<s> Sounds more like a hardware issue but always try the software first, then go from there. </s>
<s> Yes we have tried that. </s>
<s> But the software doesn't work when the hardware isn't detected when the computer starts. </s>
<s> When the computer starts the Scanner isn't even detected in the device manager. </s>
<s> Before last week if I hit refresh the scanner was detected and started but now nothing happens. </s>
<s> Sounds like hardware issue then. </s>
<s> Cable possibly but more than likely internal issue with scanner. </s>
<s> My suggestion would be to replace it with a newer USB input scanner, they aren't that expensive and are generally faster than the old SCSI hook ups. </s>
<s> It does seem to be a hardware issue because it's taking half a day from the time the Power button is pushed. </s>
<s> This is even before I turn on the computer. </s>
<s> In regard to your second point getting the usb scanner might be like pulling teeth as far as my supervisor is concerned. </s>
