<s> Hi I just bought a HP Pavilion dv9000t series custom few days back to replace my iMac. </s>
<s> I chose this computer for HP reputation and it came with HDMI out. </s>
<s> I wanted to know if HDMI is the same thing as a DVI with sound can I use this as a output to connect the laptop to my 22&quot; gateway display with DVI as a extended desktop? </s>
<s> I talked with someone at radioshack about this and they sold me a cable with HDMI out and DVI in attached. </s>
<s> Today I talked with someone who thought the HDMI was only used for TVs and not display. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> If it is do anyone know what the cable I bought is used for? </s>
<s> Did I waste fifty bucks too? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> you'll just need a hdmi to dvi cable. </s>
<s> shop around since $50 is way too expensive for a cable. </s>

<s> Thanks for the clarification. </s>
<s> It's just I used DVI with the Last two Macs I had and I don't want to go back to VGA connection ever again. </s>
<s> I never seen or heard of a HDMI on a PC or a Mac before and it raised some doubt after hearing and only seeing HDMI only in TV related products. </s>
<s> Again thank you. </s>
