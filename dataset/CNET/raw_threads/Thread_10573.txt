(black borders)	My computer's screen recently flashed (it's been working flawlessly for over 2 years) and ever since my screen has about an 1 1/2 inch black border on both sides. If I run a game I will get the full screen. I tried formatting my computer but the problem still persists. I have an AMD Athlon XP 2000+ processor running on windows XP (service pack 2) with directX 9 or better. The videocard is a Nvidia GeForce4 MX 440-SE which says to be working properly. My display settings are 800x600, 60 hertz. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem and/or how knows how to fix it.

Many monitors remember different settings for the margins at different resolutions. Try adjusting whatever size/spacing controls are available through your monitors built-in menu/buttons.
