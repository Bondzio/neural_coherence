i want to get my nephew a tablet for his 13th birthday, but do not want to spend $300.00 for one.
i know this limits my choice a lot, but i think it is the best way to go.
i have been looking at the kindle fire, nook tablet, blackberry playbook and the acer iconia tablet a100-07u08u.
this bring me between $200 and $250 which is a good price.
it does not need to be an extensive tablet just something he can facebook, games and surf the net on.
any suggestions would be great, i am flexible with the os and am not a hater of other stuff.
thanks
