<s> I have just bought a new Dell with a 40G hard drive. </s>
<s> It of course comes with XP. </s>
<s> My old computer is running an OEM Win 98 (non SE) with a 3G and a 40G hard drive that I installed. </s>
<s> Is it possible to simply physically take the 40G out of my old computer and install it in my new one and have the XP recognize that drive and it's contents without any substantial problems? </s>
<s> Or do I need to bite the bullet and transfer files and then install the hard drive clean? </s>
<s> I was told this was known as &quot;hot starting&quot; a hard drive. </s>
<s> Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> As to the actaul install... 1. </s>
<s> Power off. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Set jumpers per the IDE rules (it's all over the web!) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Set BIOS to autodetect. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> In most cases, boot XP and you'l see your other drive and be able to drag files off it. </s>
<s> Programs get to be installed from CD's or what else. </s>
