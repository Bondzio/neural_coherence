Now the problem im having is, everytime i try to use I.E i get a pop-up on screen saying windows installing, to which i thought, ok is my computer infected. So i done a full system scan and it is fine, so i then looked it up on microsofts website, and it mentioned something about microsoft word, or that the registry is a little screwed up. Now before i start doing anything silly going my microsofts website, to which i dont trust fully, as this error happens everytime i try to look @ a different website, but if i play games it doesnt happen, also it appears on boot-up to which it might be a registry error. The o/s that im running is xp home. So i was wondering if anyone has come across this problem.. Thanks......

Windows Installer Cleanup Utility While that may find some pending install, I don't use Internet Explorer except for Windows Update. I find it too dangerous and time consuming to cleanup after the pests drop in. After WICU, look up EWIDO for another scan. Bob
