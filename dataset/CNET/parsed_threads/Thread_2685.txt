<s> After reading and researching several home/small business printers and scanners, I still can't decide what to buy. </s>
<s> The scanner I am thinking of is the Epson 1670 Photo (comments?) </s>
<s> but the printer I am looking for (please help!) </s>
<s> would offer high quality color and text, have an ADF, prefer multiple colors so to only replace colors as necessary. </s>
<s> I would be using this for cards, invitations, letters, pictures (next purchase is 1st digital camera) mostly creative personal stuff but some small business things that I want to look professional. </s>
<s> Speed is somewhat an issue because I normally do 200 cards, etc. </s>
<s> at a time. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I'm just mind boggled by all the variations. </s>
<s> An issue that can catch most people offguard is that you may find that ink will have to be handy at 200 sheet runs. </s>
<s> When I do my yearly mailing, I have one spare ink cart before I print and usually have to replace all but one... Today's printer at home is the Epson C80. </s>
<s> It's getting a few years old so when it messes up, the C84 or the 6 color with CD printing capability unit is what I'll probably get. </s>
