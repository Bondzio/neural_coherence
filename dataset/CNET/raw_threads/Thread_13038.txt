I am a college student and i use my computer for school work, web browsing, and dowloading alot music. I want my imac to atleast last 3 or 4 year and during that time i dont want to worry about not having enough memory or ram,or my processor being to out of date. will the 20 inch model with 2gb of memory, 750gb of ram,and 2.66 processor last me comfortably or will i need the 24 inch with 4 gb of memory,1tb of ram and the 3.06 processor?
