<s> I installed Windows 98 once, and it didn't work. </s>
<s> Anyway, I was able to start up in Safe Mode, and I had something like 5.8 GB of space on that computer's hard drive. </s>
<s> I decided to re-install. </s>
<s> I made a boot disk, and typed FDISK to re-partion my hard drive. </s>
<s> I deleted by old partitions, and made a new one. </s>
<s> When it asked if I wanted to use the maximum space for my partion, I hit yes. </s>
<s> It said 508 MB. </s>
<s> I figured something was wrong, so I restarted, and did the process of FDISK over. </s>
<s> This time, instead of clicking yes to the maximum, I just set the value of space to be used on the partion I wanted (in percent) to 99%. </s>
<s> It came out as like 500 MB. </s>
<s> What happened!? </s>
<s> It's like my hard drive was randomly reduced to 1/10 the size! </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> My first thought was that the hard drive was shot, but I later proceeded to install Windows 98 on it, so I fail to see how only 90% of it was ruined... Any suggestions as to where to go would be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks, GarciaOwens By the way, I'm 100% sure that my hard drive -was- very near 6 GB, so it's not just be seeing things or something. </s>
<s> i also notice that when bought my first hard drive it ranges around 160 gig. </s>
<s> but after a couple of months i was infected with a unknown virus so i decided to reformat my pc but after i reformat it, install os and drivers i checked my my computer properties and ive noticed that my hard drive lost some of its volume. </s>
<s> it was not some for me but it was a more gig capacity which was i lost and then i asked someone who knows more about computer than me and he said every time i reformat a pc it automatically lose some space. </s>
<s> please note that this is just my opinion and others might not agree w/ me so i suggest you to ask for second and third opinions. </s>
<s> thanks hope this will provide you much ideas. </s>
<s> I think FDISK reports it as 500 megs even when it's bigger. </s>
<s> Why don't you download a disk utility from your drive's manufacturer and use that instead? </s>
<s> They work much better than old FDISK and FORMAT, much quicker and are more updated, give more accurate info. </s>
<s> Let's hope they figured it out. </s>
