Thanks for your reply kees.
I will never have more than 2 or 3 computers on the network.
I have got all the ethernet runs in order to connect televisions in different rooms etc, giving them access to my nas media.
There will not be a lot of traffic on the network, usually only 1 or 2 devices at a time.
I need a setup that is more for the home user.
I am hoping to spend about $400 or so on my switch.
Would I be better to have a standard 24 port gigabit switch, and use poe adaptors?
Thanks Barry
