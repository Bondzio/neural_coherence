1.1.1	Hey guys .	St
1.1.2	I 'm new to PC building and hope to build my first gaming machine probably this coming summer .	St
1.1.3	I was wondering how you connect two nvidia cards w/ SLI .	St
1.1.4	I was looking on Newegg and the picture says there is an SLI connector on the bottom on the opposite side of where you connect it to your PCIe slot .	St
1.1.5	So how to I link them together is there a cord or something ?	Ques
1.1.6	Also what is the highest amount you can have connected through SLI ?	Ques
1.1.7	I was thinking of buying 2 1GB cards and SLI them together could I do that or is there a limit ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks ahead for the help , Will	Sug
1.2.1	On the top of the card there is a notch where the SLi bridge goes .	St
1.2.2	Most of the SLi compatible motherboards come with an SLi bridge included .	St
1.2.3	You can get 2 Nvidia GeForce 7950GTX2 cards , which have a Gigabyte of memory and 2 chips on the one card .	St
1.2.4	Having two of these in SLi creates Quad Sli , and requires a compatible motherboard , power supply , a big enough case ( the cards are long ) and another SLi bridge .	St
1.2.5	Alternatively , you could buy a single 8800GTX card , for about 3/4 of the price of the Quad SLi .	St
1.2.6	A single 800GTX card beats a Quad Sli setup .	St
