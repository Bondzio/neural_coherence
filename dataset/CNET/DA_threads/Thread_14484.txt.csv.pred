1.1.1	will a antec 400 watt power supply be enough for my pc?	St
1.1.2	Im running a AMD 3200, 1gig ddr dualchannel ram, 2 raid serial ata 100gb Hd's, 2 GeForce 7800GTX GDDR3 SLI video cards.	St
1.2.1	Go here: http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone2_build.html Scroll down to SLI certified power supplies.	St
1.2.2	They are all over 500W.	St
1.3.1	I like Antec, but your system appears to really be pushing what can safety operate of that 400W.	St
1.3.2	The high wattage rating that any psu can supply can only sustain for a given time and continue to output such levels and the highest level is very short duration.	St
1.3.3	Thus, I recommend to look into at least 450W or better and 500W+ is truly worth the cost.	St
1.3.4	Those dual SLI cards are what is crushing the system psu, so think if the psu goes what else goes with it.	St
1.3.5	You got too much invested and installed, get a higher wattage psu, its the basis of a stable system more than you think.	St
1.3.6	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	Jeez, no.	St
1.4.2	Those 7800GTX's are monsters.	St
1.4.3	Especially in SLI.	St
1.4.4	Get a wattage of at least 650 watts, more if you can.	St
1.4.5	And don't get an unknown brand, like Nefarion Cooling Solutions.	St
1.4.6	Antect, Thermaltake and PC Power and Cooling.	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
