The mouse driver has different name than before now for some reason, it's now called &quot;HID-compliant mouse&quot;. When I click on &quot;update driver&quot; it says I have the latest, but the driver is from 2006. I used to have a Logitech control panel but now it's gone. Doesn't give me the option to rollback driver. Should I uninstall the driver, unplug mouse, and then plug it back in hoping I will get my old Logitech driver back?

Are you sure it won't damage anything if I pop in regular AA batteries into the mouse (I believe the model number is Logitech MX500) instead of using the rechargeable batteries that came with it? This person put regular batteries in their phone that normally takes rechargeable batteries and the regular batteries ended up melting, so I'm worried about that: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081115051609AAp3Vha
