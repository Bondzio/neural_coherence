<s> I just got a new firm ware update for my wireless router the Dlink DI 624 and it has WPA and WPA2 but my brother has a netgear PCI card WG311 and i dont know if i can have this kind of security My question is does the PCI card have firmware or will i just have to use WEP </s>

<s> As far as security, each network has it's own needs. </s>
<s> An apartment environment may need the beefier security of WPA, while a private country estate may need MAC filtering at best. </s>
<s> The choice is yours. </s>

<s> on page 3-10. </s>
<s> Any change to the cards security function would come through a software program update, not firmware. </s>

<s> Netgear has information on their website too. </s>
<s> A cursory look reveals that there are 3 different versions of the WG311 card, but you have to look at the serial number of yours to determine which it is. </s>
<s> One of them has a new driver that will support WPA, the others apparently won't. </s>
