thanks for the reply, i tried updating but it already had the most recent ver.
on it.
i've narrowed down the problem it seems if the internet connection is not working on one of the desktops, i can disable the radio on the laptop and almost immediatly find the internet on the desktop.
then turning the radio back on does not cause immediate loss of desktop connection(have used both at the same time for extended periods of time) but can expect it to be gone again eventually.
