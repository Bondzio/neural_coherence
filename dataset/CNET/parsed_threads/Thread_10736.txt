<s> I am really confused about buying a new computer. </s>
<s> I am saving up for a top of the line computer and I am stuck between 4 companies, Alienware, Falcon Northwest, Dell, Voodoo. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards Alienware because I really like their cases(I'm a sucker for cool cases), but I have read nothing but negative things about their customer support. </s>
<s> I have also read that Falcon and Dell both have really good tech support. </s>
<s> Not sure about Voodoo's support. </s>
<s> Help please! </s>
<s> Alienware wasn't always a big co. it had growing pains. </s>
<s> You'll be a sucker if all you like is the case. </s>
<s> When Alienware introduced the cases, sales really took off and thier support dropped as well. </s>
<s> Basically, they outgrew themselves and haven't caught up. </s>
<s> Plus, the users they sell to are bound to demand the most from thier systems as gamers typically punish thier systems going to extremes. </s>
<s> Even though Alienware makes good systems, its still off the shelf componets, they simply put it to together in a cool way(duh). </s>
<s> But, the other vendors do well too, exclude Dell for now. </s>
<s> Check those others and see what they got. </s>
<s> If none do well, you can buy a Alienware &quot;looking&quot; case as many are out there really jazzed-up cases for DIY'ers offering pretty much the same item. </s>
<s> VooDoo seems to be relatively new and none have come across my repair bench, but then again, alot of $2K+ systems rarely do, those $400 ones all the time, I exclude servors and such. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you Willy. </s>
<s> Im planning on spending 6000 to 8000 on a high end gaming computer so I just wanted to make sure the company I go with has good technical support (at least enough to act like they care). </s>
<s> Falcon Northwest from what I have read has excellent customer service. </s>
<s> I'm not in it for just the cool case but if I spend this much on a computer I figure I should get what I want. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help! </s>
