As mentioned, you'll need to use recovery software.
Here's an article describing the software with reviews and links to freeware recovery software available on this site: http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12/recovering-those-accidentally-lost.html Now the SmartMedia card was, if I'm not mistaken, the first flash card.
Also if I remember correctly, these cards were not really designed to be durable and last forever (few years max).
I'm surprised yours was still working properly.
Would highly recommend considering a new camera with new media.
