i have a dell inspiron 620. last night a power surged messed up my computer.
i didn't even realize this until i had sat down to a screen that was displaying &quot;windows is loading files&quot; and a full bar underneath just hanging there.
i knew that this meant it had automatically done a startup repair but i wasn't sure why it was hanging.
so i rebooted and changed the bios to run from the cd rom first.
i put in a windows 7 cd to try and run startup repair from there and rebooted.
again it just loaded the &quot;windows is loading files&quot; bar and hanged.
at this point i decided to run an unbuntu cd to try and salvage what was on my hardrives before i did a clean wipe and reinstall of windows 7. it displayed the unbuntu splash page and then went blank.
after this i noticed that there were sounds coming from inside my computer... here's that uploaded in mp3 form to help give you an idea.
(after :23 skip to :58) what is this by user668315214 on soundcloud - create, record and share your sounds for free it makes these same sounds each time i tried to boot, so i figured it was my hard drive causing this.
to test that theory, i removed my hardrives and used another one from a different computer that was made around the same time as my other hdds.
still, no proper boot, and it made the exact same sounds.
all i can think of it being is a mother board issue.
what do you all think?
