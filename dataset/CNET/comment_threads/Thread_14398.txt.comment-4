Thanks for the info and here are the specs on the computer.
I'm running XP home installed with a clean install using an upgrade from 98se.
It is up to date with SP2 and all of the latest udated from microsoft.
It is a Micron Millenia (Best Buy) P# 733 with 2 hard drives.
I'm running AWIL's avast anti-virus and microsofts anti-spyware.
I just did a chkdsk on the secondary drive and it read unrecoverable.
I unhooked it and the PC started.
Guess I'm back in business.
Thanks again
