<s> I have a Samsung 24&quot; widescreen monitor and I know the native resolution is 1920x1080. </s>
<s> I also am aware that this equates to a 16x9. </s>
<s> I want to change the resolution because I cant see 1920x1080 that well. </s>
<s> Out of all the optional resolutions, the only other one that equates to a 16x9 is 1360x768. </s>
<s> When I change the display to that resolution everything on the screen gets fuzzy. </s>
<s> It doesn't happen with any other resolution. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> No resolution other than native will provide the optimum image. </s>
<s> There are some tweaks in Windows that might help. </s>
<s> Make sure you use &quot;clear type&quot; for text. </s>
<s> You can change icon size on your desktop, Windows XP and 7 both have features to help those with vision problems. </s>
<s> In 7 it's called &quot;ease of access&quot; or some such...an accessory. </s>
<s> What about upgrading your video? </s>
<s> Perhaps you already have, if not that might be a thought. </s>
<s> An aftermarket slot card could/would increase your options. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> I tried the clear type option but it didn't help. </s>
<s> Its not just the type but everything on the screen looks off. </s>
<s> Why does it happen only with this one resolution? </s>
<s> Steve's post mentioned NATIVE RESOLUTION, which would be optimal for that monitor but not necessarily for the onboard (computer) hardware, that is why I asked if you had upgraded your system, specifically an aftermarket video card that could give you more options and potentially better performance. </s>
