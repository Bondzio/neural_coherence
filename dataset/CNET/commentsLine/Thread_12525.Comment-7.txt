you said in your first post that your win7 computer is connected to your router via an ethernet card.
if so, it does not need a wireless adapter and that should not affect it seeing and connecting to the printer.
while i bow to the change discussion about the router and i accept there may be some setting or other there that needs looking at, i'm still puzzled what the computer's wizard said when you used it to connect to this printer.
