I would like to know if you resolved this issue since I am having the same problem.
I have tried to install the card (H/W Rev B2) in an XP SP2 machine and none of the drivers can be found (tried the original CD and 3 downloaded drivers from D-Link).
I thought it was related to the SP2 upgrade.
This card was working fine in a Win98 machine.
