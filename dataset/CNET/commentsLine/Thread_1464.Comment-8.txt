it is a vaio vpceb12en.
it does not have usb ports on the back, but three on the right side and one usb/esata port on left, whcih can also used as a usb port(i did not try on that one).
and also with windows i can see the transfer rate upto 57mb/s with the ports on the right.
yes i agree with that.
ubuntu has better support and also easy too, than fedora.
but i love fedora !
