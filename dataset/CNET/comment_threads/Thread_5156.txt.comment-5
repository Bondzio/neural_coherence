The pink microphone input port on the computer is just that--a place to plug in an external microphone.
If the desktop had an internal microphone (installed, say, in the front of the case), the desktop case would have to sit on your desktop and you would have to speak into your case.
Not uncommon with notebooks, but on a desktop??
