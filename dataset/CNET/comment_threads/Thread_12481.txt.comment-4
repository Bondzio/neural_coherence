I'm having the same problem.
Dell has been out to switch out the sound card - same problem.
Tech support at Creative tried some software fixes with me, but wasn't able to solve the problem.
I'm going to try a higher end microphone with the sound card and also a USB microphone.
Anyone find any other fixes?
