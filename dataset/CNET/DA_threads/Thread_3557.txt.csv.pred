1.1.1	Hey All, Well I am writing you from my new T6212 I put in 2-512MB pc3200 sticks, I had enough and got a x800xl (or is it xt, ah i forget but $299 at compusa, pci-e).	St
1.1.2	I formatted all the oem stuff and installed my Win xp sp2 , had to go find the sound card driver but that was easy.	St
1.1.3	I am installing World of Warcraft now, so we will see how it performs but I suspect well.	St
1.1.4	It's patching to current build, takes a bit from scratch.	St
1.1.5	I will update after I play a bit :P I also got the 19&quot; crt from Best buy, Insignia, their signiture brand, genereric I guess lol but it has quite a good picture and I am very pleased :P Only $129, so that's nice.	St
1.1.6	The only thing I have to install hardware wise is a wireless pci adapter.	St
1.1.7	Waiting to move the pc to do that though.	St
1.1.8	No hurry since it's not needed yet.	St
1.1.9	It's operating very very well.	St
1.1.10	Talk to you all soon and let you knwo how well it performs on 3d Thanks for everyones input too SeaninWa	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Let us kno how everything works out.	St
1.3.2	Thats why I love the T6212, just a few upgrades and the thing can fly.	St
1.3.3	Such a great deal.	Polite
1.4.1	Hey, So ya it's going very well.	Polite
1.4.2	It handles multitasking like a charm, I am playing World of Warcraft while I type this and have 2 downloads (torrents)going while sharing at max upload speed.	St
1.4.3	Early I was installing 3 things at once, all went very quickly.	St
1.4.4	I unzipped 3 things at once while downloading a couple things and it did studder a bit but got through it pretty well if you asked me.	St
1.4.5	The x800 is performing well also.	St
1.4.6	I am not going to overclock it as I just dont think it's necessary really.	St
1.4.7	Plus I have the psu issue and less is more here lol.	St
1.4.8	In wow with 4xaa8xaf and 1600x1200 everything else turned max I get 25-40 fps in populated areas and a bit higher 10 or so fps in non populated areas.	St
1.4.9	I kinda thought I was gonna get more but it doesn't matter really as it's completely playable at those rates.	St
1.4.10	It look terrific, as much as it can.	St
1.4.11	I don't think the textures are as detailed as I would like but that's the coding not the video card I suspect.	St
1.4.12	I didn't add a sound card and I am perfectly happy with it as it is, works fine for me.	St
1.4.13	I have a subwoofer and 2 speakers and it's great for me.	St
1.4.14	Plus again I have the psu issues to worry about so again less is more :P I getting some other games via online now and am going to try them out and see what happens but it really seems to be doing very well.	St
1.4.15	I hope it keeps it up.	St
1.4.16	The cpu is running 31 degrees which I believe is good.	St
1.4.17	So that's nice to know.	Polite
1.4.18	I don't know what else to add but if I think of anything I will let you all know.	St
1.4.19	If you have any specific questions feel free to leave a post and I will see if I can get you an answer :P So, yes it was a great investment SeaninWa	St
1.5.1	the info and updates, SW!	St
1.5.2	I'm recommending the T6212 to some of my friends.	St
1.5.3	JDM	St
1.6.1	I have installed a 6600 GT OC, two 512 sticks of ram, a $20 soundblaster card (the onboard sound when playing Half life 2 sucked) it sounds great now, and a 450 watt power supply.	St
1.6.2	The computer really kicks ass now, I can play the newest games with all of the graphics turned up with no problem!	St
1.6.3	AND when you decide to go SLI all you have to do is buy a new motherboard!	St
1.6.4	Also it is a 64bit AMD, so when the new 64bit windows comes out, you are ready to go!	St
1.6.5	ALSO, it is theoretically possible to shoehorn an Athlon 64 FX-55 processor and its heat sink into the T6212.	St
1.6.6	So, get one!	St
1.7.1	Where did you get the 450W power supply from that will fit in the T6212 case??	St
1.7.2	Thanks!	St
1.8.1	have fun with ur new toy..seaninwa any particular reason to go with x800xl instead of 6600gt?	St
1.9.1	x800xl is like double performance of 6600gt.	St
1.9.2	the x800xl competes with nvidia 6800gt.	St
1.9.3	it is between 6800gt and 6800 ultra.	St
1.9.4	the x800xl has 256bit memory interface and 16 pixel lines.	St
1.9.5	if u have the money, u should definitely go for the x800xl or 6800gt instead of the 6600gt	St
1.10.1	Thx nerdyboy, how about powersupply needs of x800xl..is 300W enough?	St
1.10.2	I am yet to get into gaming.	St
1.10.3	Currently main purpose of my video card will be for HTPC.	St
1.10.4	Do u know, if x800XL good for HTPC over DVI outputs.	St
1.11.1	at CompUSA, It's a Mad Dog SurePower 450watt.	St
1.11.2	$80 Fits perfectly, you need no extra cables or parts to install.	St
1.12.1	x800xl is an extremely powerful graphics card.	St
1.12.2	basically same specs as the highest end ati radeon x850xt, just slower clock speeds.	St
1.12.3	if u do get into gaming, u will have a very potent system.	St
1.13.1	ATI cards are fast, but lack the technology support by nvidia such as FP3.0 i think and others, which would render these cards useless in the coming years.	St
1.13.2	ATI wants you to keep upgrading and buying their cards along with intel, they changed their socket to not be able to upgrade to dual-core.	St
1.13.3	No wonder ati and intel are basically partners when you build a system.	St
1.13.4	That's why gamers buy amd, which allows you to upgrade, and nvidia.	St
1.13.5	By all means, if you want brute force, get the intel and ati, but for the future and compatibility and the fastest game experience, but not the best for encoding,etc.	St
1.13.6	get amd and nvidia.	St
1.13.7	Roger	St
