this is not ``i told you so,'' but i think we've decided there is no repair.
two guys here added to the two at dell were sure this problem could be solved without a clean install of windows.
it took a while, but each guy thought there was a cure and i did what they told me to do, and in the end, they came to the conclusion that there is no repair, no cure and so we need to get on with it.
i just finished a defrag that took less than an hour.
i want to get on with the answer i had when i came here and that was what is the best, cheapest way to do a clean install while saving as much software as possible.
with some kind of external hard drive, i can save all of the files that need saving, so the question remains.
i hope that's what happens next, maybe tomorrow.
thanks to everyone who tried to cure the problem.
