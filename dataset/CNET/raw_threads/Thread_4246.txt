I've heard that it will free up RAM, and help the CPU perform better but idk.. i dont game alot, but i do like HD video editing. My computer is a SFF, and the best Low Profile graphics card deal i have found is a 2GB Radeon HD5450 card. Current Specs: Dell Optiplex 755 SFF Stock Mobo Intel Q6600 2.4 GHz (SLACR, G0 Stepping) 4GB DDR2 RAM (bout to upgrade to 8) Windows 7 HP 64 Bit 1.0 TB WD Caviar Black SATA HD I capture Halo Gameplay with a Hauppauge HD PVR Gaming Edition, and edit with Sony Vegas Pro 9.0c

Yes, adding a new video card will free ram back for PC system use once the on-board video is disabled. In most cases, you'll increase video capabilities beyond on-board which are basic or OEM requirements match. i do suggest you review any new video cards specs and find out if replacing the PSU for for required needs(or better) and lets not exclude cooling as well. Doing this for the new video card is best for continued use to become less problematic. The more demanding the video card the more attention to details for the best overall operation becomes a MUST. So don't discount this because it may work for some time then start to falter later. tada -----Willy

Years ago they used to do that, today it creates too many support calls so I see most machines don't release onboard video ram. Some BIOS may allow you to reduce it but the trend is away from such for a very simple reason. Folks no longer want to tweak machines (most!) So I have one more comment. The 5450 is a good solution for those machines like you noted but the 2GB might be DDR2 RAM. If so, get the slightly faster 1GB DDR3 card. What game did you want to try that needed that 2GB Video Card? Most of today's games are fine with 1GB. And the games that want more would run poorly on this card. Bob
