I have never used dual band nics installed inside the laptop, only ones that are usb external.
I would suspect they work similar.
Their are settings in the device config in the driver that lets you set all kinds of wireless settings.
One option will select the band and it may default to 2.4.
You may have to force it to use 5, Some adapters have their own little app to set this stuff but i think if you are using windows you must set these from the device manager.
Kinda depends one of my adapters will scan both 2.4 and 5 and when you select the device to connect to it set all this stuff.
The other you have to scan each separately.
Never tried set them using just the windows network stuff though.
I would recommend you run everything that can run on 5G and force the 2.4 to run G only or B only if you have stuff that does not do G. Even B is more than fast enough for internet surfing.
