<s> I have a hd7770 and every time i have a game session after a while the video crash, the image freeze, i have black screen for a couple of seconds, and the game minimizes (Display driver amdkmdap stopped responding and has successfully recovered.). </s>
<s> I tried all latest amd drivers and with all of them i have this problem, i tested the video card on another pc and works perfectly, i tried to replace the 7770 with an nvidia 280gtx and the nvidia with its drivers do not crash, i also tried different psu on my pc but the problem persists. </s>

<s> I was reading a review on that video card and there test PCs used 750Watt on one and 1000Watt on another. </s>
