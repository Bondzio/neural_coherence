<s> Have two older Pionex systems which I am trying to rehab for use in a child care center. </s>
<s> Everything is now working fine except that I do not have sound. </s>
<s> Original OS was corrupted so I loaded WIN98 on all three systems. </s>
<s> One unit is 266Mhz, the other 350 Mhz. </s>
<s> I believe both have Cyrix processors. </s>
<s> One unit appears to have an onboard sound chip while the other has a PCI sound card. </s>
<s> I have replaced the sound card with a new one. </s>
<s> On both systems if I try to load a game I get the same error message: &quot;WAVEOUTGETNUMDEVS---NO WAVE DEVICES----OK&quot; If I click OK the game loads but there is no sound. </s>
<s> I have deleted &quot;Sound Controllers&quot; in System Devices and reloaded the drivers but no luck. </s>
<s> Can someone help? </s>

<s> You get to find what it has, find the drivers and install them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The new sound card I installed came with a driver CD. </s>
<s> I was able to browse and locate the correct drivers which loaded properly. </s>
<s> Same error message. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I was not aware of this fact....but, all I did was load a clean version of WIN98 over the old version. </s>
<s> I did not wipe the hard drive clean before the install so shouldn't the MOBO drivers still be loaded? </s>
<s> Why would this only affect the WAVE Devices and nothing else? </s>
<s> For devices to work with a motherboard, sometimes you need to install the motherboard drivers first. </s>
<s> Microsoft does NOT install all needed drivers and the Driver Update button is little more than a demo of how good things could be. </s>
<s> Just wondering. </s>
<s> Since Windows 98 has been around for 7+ years, how could we avoid learning about the drivers? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The title says it all. </s>
<s> What you say makes sense, but us common folk don't work with computers all the time and we certainly don't get into code and the inner workings of an OS. </s>
<s> That's why we come on-line asking for help. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I will search for the MOBO drivers and hopefully that will solve my problem. </s>
<s> Board and I'll look for them. </s>
<s> Look up BELARC ADVISOR and supply its output MINUS any Serial Numbers if you can't find the make and model of the board. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the offer. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I scrapped out the old modems as the machines were never to be connected to the internet. </s>
<s> Thus I can't use BELARC ADVISOR until I put a modem in. </s>
<s> However, from looking at the board I can determine the following: First system is by Pionex, P-GXM266A-V2. </s>
<s> It has one Cyrix chip labeled L2A0788; CX5520 and I am sure the CPU is a Cyrix. </s>
<s> Bios is Award. </s>
<s> MOBO also has the following stamped on it: M5CNB VER. </s>
<s> 1.1. </s>
<s> Second unit is also Pionex, P-CMII350B-V7. </s>
<s> Cyrix M 2 350GP CPU chip with Award Bios. </s>
<s> M5ATD Ver. </s>
<s> 1.2 stamped on MOBO. </s>
<s> Is this enough to go on? </s>
<s> If not I will pick up a modem card and install. </s>
<s> then copied to the desktop on the computers that need it and the program run from there.....it will create a file that you can either print or write down the device makers and model numbers......we'll get you to the drivers. </s>
<s> So since you're on the net with your computer you can download it for free.....very small program. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> Toni or Bob, Very nice program. </s>
<s> I have installed it on one machine and received the following info: Windows 98 Build 4.10.1998 Bios: Award 4.51 PG 07/17/98 Model: Pionex Processor: 267 Mhz Cyrix GXm 16 KB Cache Board: GXm-Cx5520 Bus Clock: 64 Mhz Is this enough? </s>
<s> Second machine processor heat sink fan is bad so need to replace before I run Belarc. </s>
