a standard written by techie engineers, and dertimnes the way the thing should work.
802.11g (which is what your laptop has) is the fastest standard that has been agreed.
definetly stick with that.
anything that runs at 108mps will not be built to the standrds when they are published so you have no guarntee's it will work properly.
as for a brand and security, the security is the same strength on all kit, regardless of brand, as it is built to a standard.
security is an issue only if you don't set it properly.
from that point of view, use something that's easy to use- if you get on with your netgear kit then buy netgear.
no idea what a storage router is.....
