I need to set up a wireless, secured network for about 6 individuals located across the country. I need a central server, probably FTP ability... Where do I start? I am not an IT guy (obviously, the crowd says!) but am more than a complete newb on a computer... This is for a small business startup to give you the obvious context.. Since this is probably too advanced for me, can anyone recommend a company that provides this service? Thanks for your time and help Chuck

Since you said they are located across the country, I'll suggest you look up VPNs and use virtual private networking. They could have access either by wired or wireless from many locations. You mentioned FTP which is simply for file transfer so I presume it's for document sharing. You'll need a server somewhere that's open to the web. My best suggestion, since you said you're not an IT guy, is to hire one. I can't tell you who to turn to as this depends on your location. You may have someone in your city who you can call that would be happy to sit down with you and chat about your needs.

Starting a company with geographically dispursed staff will need careful planning. I run an IT consulting firm in Atlanta; however, we consult with companies across the country. I would love to speak with you to understand your specific requirements. Feel free to contact me sales@precedent-tech.com.
