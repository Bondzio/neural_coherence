I do a little video editing and some fairly-sophisticated perl and java animations of my own designs, and do these with the built-in video card on my (2GB, Athlon X2) system.
I suspect, but don't really know,that the performance of both would be enhanced by a little better video card.
At heavy loads, the PC did not quite keep up with the animations till I added the second GB of memory, and I am thinking to go to even-more sophisticated animations in the future.
It's hard for me to understand why anyone except an extreme gamer would need more than a $100 video adapter.
