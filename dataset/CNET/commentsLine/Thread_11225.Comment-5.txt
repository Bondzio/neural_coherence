not firefox, but i use opera, and very rarely have ie open.
speed is same with either browser.
i'm not going to stress over it, it's not that big an issue.
i can copy and paste to notepad any text i need, and send that to printer pretty quickly.
i very rarely wish to print a whole web page, as is.
it's just sort of irritating that it takes so long.
