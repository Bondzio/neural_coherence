i already have a cintiq.
i want a digital sketchpad.
my only requirement was to ask cnet to include this kind of info in their reviews.
as for the series 7 slate, last years model ran photoshop fine, has wacom tech, and was pressure sensitive ( i believe only 256 levels) the new series 7 slate  pretty much fits the bill....but its hard to find the info in reviews....that is what i am saying.
