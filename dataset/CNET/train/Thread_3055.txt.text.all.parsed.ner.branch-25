(let's say- p3 933mhz?) 2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop. what can be the problem?

(let's say- p3 933mhz?) this is not possible. here's why. i'll use the game doom 3 as my example that no system today can play that game at it's top settings without &quot;stuck&quot; or a pause now and then. the game was designed to push the envelope and to take advantage of hardware yet to be. 2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop. what can be the problem? i'd say the cause can be either a poor installation or a power supply that is on the edges of the maximum that it can supply. bob

6427	13	39817	470357	466551	unknown	10/8/04 6:46 am	1.09721796e12	re: ram vs processor + a screen gone crazy	1) i recommend upgrading both ram and cpu, but if cash is short, do the cpu upgrade first. personally, i have a duron 1.3 ghz cpu, and 640 mb ram (128 + 512) and i still need more ram and processor speed. however, until you do upgrade your hardware, you can boost your ram by adjusting windows's paging file. sure, it consumes some of your hdd, but it will work, until the upgrade is done. 2) my guess is that your power source does not produce enough watts to satisfy all the needs of your system. sure, it is ok without fan, but the moment you plug it in, you add another power consumer and it can't take it. so, it cuts down on the power supplied to the monitor, to keep the fan, motherboard, cpu, and hdd running. my advice ? get a newer motherboard and power source. a 400w power source should do the trick.

(i run a computer lab at a major university, and have 20 of the systems described) cleaning up the drive , ensuring that there is plenty of virtual memory available, removing spy-ware and of course having a good viruscan program and autoscheduling of updates(all) should help. as for the fan, if it connects to the motherboard, it may be drawing to much current, or it may be faulty. i would try another fan, and if the same results, have the power supply checked.

6427	16	39817	470873	470357	kwkid	10/8/04 10:03 am	1.09722978e12	re: ram vs processor + a screen gone crazy	lets see if we can clear up some serious misconceptions about the power supply. 1.) the monitor does not draw power or plug into the computer power supply. 2.) it is the responsibility of the graphics card to drive the image on the monitor. therefore, it is the graphics card that is being affected by the power supply/extra fan, not the monitor. as for the ram/processor debate, i vote for the ram first as the price vs. performance boost is much better. that being said, i don't believe we really have enough information to make the &quot;best&quot; decision. with p4 2.66ghz systems selling for as little as $350.00 it might actually be more cost effective to go this route. sincerely, kwkid
