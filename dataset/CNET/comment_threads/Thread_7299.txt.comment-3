Sorry about that, the Laptop is Acer 3200 folio design and Acer Ferrari 3400.
Note: There is a button near the keyboard to enabled/disabled Wifi Lan.
I don't relize if there is another setting to turn on the Wifi... (Yes I heard that I have to turn on the wifi, but, where it is .. if this applicable to my laptop) Thank You again for the help
