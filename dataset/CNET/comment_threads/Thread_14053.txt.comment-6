like will said, you can return the pc if it has problems within 7 days (as of january when i bought my pc).
personally, i never bought a pc from circuit city, all the pcs in the house are from bestbuy.
no problems what so ever.
i don't think you will be disapointed which ever you choose.
if you do get the 835gm, it won't disapoint.
mine is still running after all the stuff i replaced, near everything except cpu, ram, hdds, and ide drives, and gateway's tech chat is one of the nicest and easiest things to do, its free, and its avaible daily, so your covered by their support.
