Is there a true plug and play available for Win98SE?
I want to move some files/photos from an old computer that is no longer connected to the internet without having to download the drivers from a manufacturer's website ( obviously, since it isn't connected to the internet ).
I will be moving the files/photos to Win XP.
Any recommendations?
