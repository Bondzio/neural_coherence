considering the difference between the 3000 and 3200 is minimal, while the price difference is fairly big (considering the performance difference) also, avoid radeon x series, as they lack sm3.0 support and will give you issues with sm3.0 games, such as anything based on atari's upcoming u3 engine (which is starting to surface) and some modern games such as the latest installment of splinter cell (it, however, allows for backwards compatability, as it was released around the same time as dx9.0c (which req.
's sm3.0)) only geforce 6 and 7 truly support sm3.0, ati can't even come close (geforce 6 and 7 also support fp32 or higher, ati lacks this aswell (don't quote me on this but i believe geforce 7 supports fp64)) in addition, the psu with your case probably came as part of a $20-$90 package i'd suggest throwing it away now, to save the hastle if your building a pc to last for any ammount of time, your going to want to buy a psu of a high caliber, and no psu included with any case (with the exception of double redundant psu's, which cost upwards of $700 for some) is going to be of a high caliber (there are some exceptions, but very (very) few, those would include a few upper level antec models and 1 or 2 thermaltake models)
