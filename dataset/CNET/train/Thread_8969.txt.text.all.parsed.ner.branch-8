(i have been using kaspersky security for three years, and strongly recommend their products). the computer i currently use for office & home is a dell laptop with windows xp, with which i am very happy - no, i am not changing to vista. if their are any secrets i have found the ways to keep my computer trouble free are of course - (1) leave plenty of empty space on your computer hard-drive to allow your software to function efficiently, (2) have only 1 security service (for virus, hackers, spam...) that you understand how to use, (3) data should be stored (backed-up) on an external hard-drive, which should ideally be copied again to a second external hard-drive! on your computer keep only software (your tools) and your current files. for storage purposes i use two identical 250gb lacie external hard-drives. each holds the same information - all my files and a complete system back-up of my computer. these are slightly larger (physical size) than an old vhs video cassette. if i travel for a long period i take one with me in order to allow consultation of all my files.

11460	52	259090	2556727	2555240	lynjs	8/5/07 4:20 pm	1.1863308e12	i always had to reformat	on my old hp 733 mhz, for the past couple of years reformatting was all i done every six to seven months. it was so insane that eventually the machine was replaced back in march with a 3 gig hp a1750y series custom model from hp. a note for those getting a newer pc, beware that one must make the boot disc themselves. it doesn't come with the machine like it use to, so have a dvd handy or about 19 cd-rws ready. when i attempted to make my disc with the software provided, there was a glitch. i had to contact hp where they promptly mailed a boot disc out to me. the practice is stupid. they should have just done that anyway.
