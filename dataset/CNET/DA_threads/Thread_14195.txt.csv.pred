1.1.1	The first time happened when I was using my windows formatted external ( FAT32 i believe ) hard drive on my friend 's mac computer .	St
1.1.2	I 'm not sure what happen because it was working fine but when I took it home it didnt recognize the drive .	St
1.1.3	Windows was asking me to reformat the hard drive !	St
1.1.4	So I skimmed the internet , but i didnt even know how the problem occured .	St
1.1.5	I had no hope left so I boxed the 160 gig hard drive for storage in case one day I might be able to save my thousands of photos and music .	St
1.1.6	I bought a new hard drive and decided to forget the past and start fresh .	St
1.1.7	This time I bought a 200 gig hard drive and again , I chose Seagate .	St
1.1.8	The secound time happen a few days ago , I bought a new Mac Book Pro and wanted to transfer what ever I had on my Windows XP desktop to my new mac .	St
1.1.9	I was transfering some mp3 and pictures but then I stoped .	St
1.1.10	I pushed the button down on the front of the seagate and an alert signal poped up telling me that I incorrectly disconnected the external hard drive .	St
1.1.11	I then pushed ok and immediatly tried to reconnect the hard drive .	St
1.1.12	Now every time I do so I a pop up tells me that & quot ; the disk you inserted was not readable by this computer & quot ; and I can either Initialize , Ignore , or Eject .	St
1.1.13	I tried to load the hard drive on a windows and it shows up blank and asks me to reformat it .	St
1.1.14	... .. NOT AGAIN ! ! !	St
1.1.15	GAH !	St
1.1.16	Is there any way of saving my files with the file names !	St
1.1.17	I looked at disk warrior and it seems to only help mac formatted hard drive .	St
1.1.18	Data Rescue II would get my files , but I wa n't my file names as well .	St
1.1.19	Is there a way of just restoring the directory.. or something so that I can return it to the way it was ?	Ques
1.1.20	HELP !	St
1.2.1	Here I 'm just copying files from a command line or sometimes explorer .	St
1.2.2	What 's with that button ?	Ques
1.2.3	Also , I wonder if the drive 's housing has an issue .	St
1.2.4	Some overheat or have other issues .	St
1.2.5	Try a better case .	St
1.2.6	- & gt ; In closing , FAT32 is going to mess up .	St
1.2.7	It does n't have any fault tolerance but it 's your only choice if you want a Mac to write to it .	St
1.2.8	Just remember it 's a timebomb of a filesystem .	St
1.2.9	No fix is planned .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	the button ... ? the button is to turn the external hard drive off and on .	St
1.3.2	I dont think heat is in issue , Im in an air conditioned room and on the box , the seagate claims that it was designed for cooling .	St
1.3.3	I was n't writing anything to the hard drive , just coping files to my mac .	St
1.3.4	Unless something going on undetected ...	St
1.3.5	I was planning to take everything off the external and then reformat it immediately .	St
1.3.6	I know seagate in the booklet says that sharing files between a mac and pc is not recommened but I did n't think this would happen.. well at least happen again .	St
1.4.1	You must eject the drive or shutdown Windows before removing the power .	St
1.4.2	FAT32 's lack of resiliency is a big factor here .	St
1.4.3	Consider using that power switch as a bad idea if Windows is still running .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	you keep saying FAT32 [ sucks ] but can anyone at least tell me clearly wether it is fixable .	St
1.5.2	i do n't know , i saw disk warrior can repair directories but only mac directories i disconnected the hard drive on a mac ( you push and hold down the button till it beeps and the hard drive spins down ) .	St
1.5.3	usually its fine when you perform it on a windows but when you disconnect this way on a mac it becomes unusable .	St
1.5.4	i really need helpful replies please bob , your kinda helping but i already realized that I have to disconnect first for the second time ( second failed hard drive ) .	Sug
1.5.5	can you at least tell if there is any hope of restoring the drive or is my best bet to retrieve the data , such as using data rescue .	St
1.5.6	i know data rescue II works but it does n't come with the file names , i have thousands of pictures each organized , and thousand of ( legal ) mp3 rips from my CDs .	St
1.5.7	I do n't want to spend thousands of hours relabeling them .	St
1.5.8	I 'm in college and i do n't have that kind of time for a while but i want some of the data now .	St
1.5.9	thanks	Polite
1.6.1	I only am sharing that FAT32 is fragile .	St
1.6.2	Use of that old file system on USB drives will be exciting .	St
1.6.3	Have you tried Zero Assumption Recovery on that drive ?	Ques
1.6.4	Also , why are files on such a drive that you ca n't lose ?	Ques
1.6.5	I 've shared that fat32 is fragile and you may have revealed you are attempting to use a fragile file system for & quot ; storage & quot ; or even worse & quot ; backup. & quot ; There 's a lesson here .	St
1.6.6	I find some will not want to learn it any other way but firsthand .	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	I know you are wanting to have some shared portable drive from Mac to PC and FAT32 is one shareable file system .	St
1.7.2	But the lesson I learned was this .	St
1.7.3	To connect such a drive I do this .	St
1.7.4	Mac ?	Ques
1.7.5	Connect with firewire .	St
1.7.6	PC ?	Ques
1.7.7	Connect with USB .	St
1.7.8	While both should work on either the operative word in this is & quot ; should & quot ; .	St
1.7.9	I 'm sharing my free lesson so you can use it if you can .	St
1.7.10	Maybe it will help , maybe not .	St
1.7.11	For now we just use those USB memory keys and networks to fling files around .	St
1.7.12	Bob	St
1.8.1	well i knew seagate couldnt help me ( says so in the warrenty that they take no responsibility for data loss ) but i called them anyways , to see if they had a suggestion -they at least told me that it was probably a corrupt partitioning table but thats all he could tell me , and just told me to search google i was thankfull for that but anyone know of a data recovery program that will recover the filenames too ?	Ques
1.8.2	or a program that will fix a corrupt partitioning table ?	Ques
1.9.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=corrupt+partition+table & btnG=Google+Search It seems this happens too often .	St
1.9.2	If you did n't believe in backups ... Bob	St
