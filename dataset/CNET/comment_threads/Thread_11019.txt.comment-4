I'm using Firefox web browser I noticed there's an orange line across the folder tab.
I'm not sure if it's always been there but that's the same orange color I see going across the screen sometimes.
Also I see the orange when I open My Computer and hover over &quot;name&quot; &quot;type&quot; &quot;total size&quot;.
I don't know if that's supposed to happen but that's what I see.
