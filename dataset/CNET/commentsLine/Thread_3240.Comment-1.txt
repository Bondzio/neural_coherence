i am running windows xp professional on an asus p4t motherboard with 2gb rdram and 1.8 mhz pentium 4 processor.
my sound card is a creative audigy live.
my graphics card is an ati all in wonder 7500. i have downloaded all the latest drivers and updates for all my hardware and the operating system here is my problem and it is driving me crazy!!!
when i play the tv on the computer the video and sound are out of sink (the sound and video play at different times like a poorly dubbed karate movie).
the graphics card uses the sound cards input to play sound through a cable connecting both cards.
another weird thing is that my system keeps muting the input volume by itself as though resetting itself.
i hope it is just a configuration issue but i am clueless.
