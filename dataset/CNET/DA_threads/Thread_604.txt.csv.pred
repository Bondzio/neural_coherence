1.1.1	My computer (running Windows 98) does not recognize the installed modem anymore.	St
1.1.2	I was using DSL so I didn't need it and before then it was working fine.	St
1.1.3	Now I need to use dial-up again.	St
1.1.4	I've since deleted the modem from the device manager and hardware profile and have physically taken the modem out and re-installed it but even the hardware device wizard didnt detect it when I put it back in the slot.	St
1.1.5	I've downloaded a number of drivers (with my other computer) but nothing.	St
1.1.6	Could this be a problem with the BIOS now?	St
1.1.7	What can be done?	St
1.2.1	where you have it......some motherboards have a shared slot that shouldn't be used for a modem.	St
1.2.2	It's usually the last (furthest away from the AGP slot) or the first one (right next to the AGP slot).	St
1.2.3	If you have it in either of those slots, move it to another, and then see if windows finds it.	St
1.2.4	TONI	St
