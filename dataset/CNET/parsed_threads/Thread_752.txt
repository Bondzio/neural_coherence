<s> hello all, lately i have been encountering a lot of internet problems regarding the range of wifi throughout my house. </s>
<s> i am unable to get wifi in one side on my basement as well as very spotty connections on the third floor. </s>
<s> i am also have a lot of dropped connections throughout the house. </s>
<s> i tried building a parabolic reflector, as well as placing the router in different locations with no improvements in wifi range or stability. </s>
<s> my question is should i wire my house for ethernet. </s>
<s> i use my laptop throughout the house. </s>
<s> all in all there are 5 laptops, an xbox 360, ps3, as well as a few portable devices (cell phones, ipod, etc). </s>
<s> all the laptops are predominantly used without batteries/they are plugged into the wall. </s>
<s> my tenant plays a lot of online games on the his ps3 but has issues with the wifi dropping out. </s>
<s> i know wiring a completed house is a lot of work but i dont have a problem doing some labor if its worth it. </s>
<s> i also want to be cost efficient. </s>
<s> in an ideal world basically i would want to be able to connect anywhere in the house, have reliable connections, and have good speeds to stream movies and download content. </s>
<s> current router is dlink dir-625. </s>
<s> any help or advice would be much appreciated.thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Have you tried using a wireless booster first this my work as it lets use position then through out the house so that you can get a stronger signal down stairs and farther. </s>

<s> A wired home network would be ideal if you don't mind doing the work of running wires. </s>
<s> Once you run the wires, you can even add wireless access points at those places where you need better wireless coverage. </s>
<s> If you want to avoid the work though, you may want to try out power line network adapters. </s>
<s> They have worked well for me in a variety of situations, and allow you the flexibility of moving the adapters to different areas of the house to give you connectivity. </s>
<s> You can even add WAPs to these as well for wireless coverage in weak areas. </s>
<s> As another poster mentioned, if you can run the cables I'd do it since that would give you some options, wireless access points etc. </s>
<s> If you are going to do the cable runs use CAT-6 instead of CAT-5, if you can, since chances are you will eventually upgrade your hardware, specifically the modem/ router from a G series to a more current N and CAT-6 would give you a potential for better throughput. </s>
<s> Good luck!! </s>
