you should do test prints and several cleaning cycles to assure that the printer is up to task.
as all epson printers are picky of the quality ink they use, stick with epson ink until good quality outputs are achieved, thus if you change to different vendort, you can blame the ink.
you need to start from scratch.
here's a link that gives a review on epson r800:  it appears that a new different ink was used this model notknown before.
in that alone, stick with epson ink.
to better clean the printer, directly swipe the printhead with a damp clean cloth to remove all crud/gunk build-up, then do a cleaning cycle.
hope this helps.
