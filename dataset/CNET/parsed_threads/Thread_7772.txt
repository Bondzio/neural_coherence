<s> I current have a printer simular to the HP Photosmart C4480. </s>
<s> I am running into an issue and the reason behind me not using it, whenever I try and print I am constantly being told that I do not have any paper in the tray. </s>
<s> I can load it with 100 sheets of paper and this happens. </s>
<s> I am looking for an all in one similar to the Dell printers where the paper is loaded from the top in. </s>
<s> I am not sure how good Dell's printers are, I know their PC's are good. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> If the printer is over 2 years old then try the usual cleaning, read the product manuals for what they say about this (I don't duplicate that here) and then if the printer is 2 or more years old, start shopping. </s>
<s> All consumer printers last about 2 to some years. </s>
<s> Many can't accept that. </s>

<s> Thats all fine and dandy....Do you have a preference as to what brand is better over teh others? </s>
<s> I've used them all over the years but don't bother with Lexmark jet printers that you find in stores. </s>
<s> I do prefer laser printers and &quot;Office&quot; printers from HP but consumers generally don't want to go past 99 bucks so those may not be on the list. </s>
