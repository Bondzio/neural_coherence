a two USB cable driven HD.
I guess if you have enough ports then there is no problem.
How difficult would it have been to give it an option brick for regular home use.
Not all computers have the necessary power to run everything that can be plugged into them.
There is only a finite amount of power on each USB bus.
Anyway, glad you back in business.
