I have been running a wireless home network for months, then decided to reinstall the Netgear WG311T adapter in one windows XP Home machine, because it disconnected a couple of times.
However, when attempting to run setup from the CD, I get an error message: ''Failed to load the windows 2000 setup program.
Please make sure that inst2000.dll is in the setup directory.
Error Number: 0x80040702 Description: Failed to load dll: Inst.2000 Setup will now terminate.''
I am unable to get past this stage or correct it.
Has anyone had an experience of this, please.
I am assuming that I will not have to physically remove the card from the board and start from scratch?
I am reminded of the old adage, ''If it ain't broke, dont fix it!''
Oh, and the other two machines and the broadband modem/router are all working perfectly.
