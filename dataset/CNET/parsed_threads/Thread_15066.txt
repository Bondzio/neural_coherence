<s> I was wondering If i can make my external hard drive use the same drive every time I plug it in, For example drive G: or anything like that, every time I unplug it and plug it back in, it turns into I different drive, and then i have to delete all my music off of Itunes, and reinstall them, for them to play, since I have all my music on my external hard drive, Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> BE CONSISTENT which USB plug and port you use. </s>
<s> system cannot look through the external case's interface and positively ID the drive. </s>
<s> If not, it will rediscover it each time the PC restarts. </s>
<s> I'm suspecting this begins in the BIOS. </s>
<s> You do need to keep keep the drive connected to the same USB port...no swapping...or it finds new hardware. </s>
<s> You can also try assigning the drive letter yourself and see if that works. </s>
<s> But I'd check device manager to see if the external is showing by the actual hard drive's ID which should suggest the manufacturer's name, model # and connection type. </s>
