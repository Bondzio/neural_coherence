I've heard TV tuner cards or special adapters (e.g. StarTech COMP2VGA Game-Console-To-PC-Monitor Adapter) but would like specific feedback if possible. I would prefer a solution that allows me to switch between both uses as easily as possible (i.e. don't want to have to plug/unplug stuff all the time). The main reason I ask is that I want to use XBOX live but my phone jacks are limited (2 in whole house, neither near our only TV where XBOX currently located). I would LOVE to simply put my XBOX on my desk which is huge and share the DSL and HOPEFULLY the monitor too.

You'll need the XBox VGA cable. Here's an inexpensive KVM: http://www.buy.com/prod/Trendnet_TK_205K_2_Port_PS_2_KVM_Switch/q/loc/101/10352473.html and a VGA switch: http://www.buy.com/prod/Tripp_Lite_Monitor_Switch_2_port_s/q/loc/101/10259620.html The KVM switch should allow you to use your keyboard and mouse with the XBox also. As for sharing the DSL line, you'll need a router such as this: http://www.buy.com/prod/D_Link_DI_604_4_Port_Cable_DSL_Router/q/loc/101/10326027.html It will connect to your DSL modem and your PC and XBox will connect to it.

In the meantime I have also found a few reputably reliable VGA adapters which have a quick switch between PC and console. I am optimistic one of these will work well - the picture quality on the VDigi is supposed to be excellent, as well as a couple of others. If not, I will likely get a TV Tuner card...
