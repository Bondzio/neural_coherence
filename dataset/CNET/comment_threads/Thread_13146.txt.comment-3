I didn't even try the drive as a DVD drive yet, (I didnt try to play a DVD) but I dont have software anyway.
My Computer labels it as a CD-Rom, I'll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works.
Though somebody gave me this site, http://forum.rpc1.org/dl_firmware.php?download_id=319, I don't know what to get from it.
