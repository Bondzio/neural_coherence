I am trying to connect my 820GM Media center to my tv but my TV is having trouble picking up the signal.
I tried the VGA output directly to the back of the TV abd I tried the S-Video both were unable to be detected by the tv.
It there anything on the computer I need to do to send the signal to the TV
