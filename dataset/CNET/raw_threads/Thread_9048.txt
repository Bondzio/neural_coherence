MSI KM2M , KM266-8235-6A6LVM4DC-00 Currently have 80 gig wd hdd as primary, and 40 gig hdd as slave on one ribbon. Have NEC DVD+RW nd-1000 on another ribbon. Have new SONY DVD/CD, DVD+/-R dual layer,double layer to install. Should I slave one of the DVD to another? (which would be slave)? Or should I make each HDD as primary and make each DVD as slave to the HDD? Thanks, Ben

CSL is supposed to work with newer drives, but doesn't always. I have had new drives that HAD to be Master/Slave switched and would only works as Master, not as Slave. Hope this helps. chuck
