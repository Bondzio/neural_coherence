<s> I have a ASUS mobo which came with onboard NIC. </s>
<s> Now this NIC seems to be dead (no light at the back, can't connect to Network, can't access internet). </s>
<s> So I uninstalled it from Device Manager and bought this D-Link DFE-530TX PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter (rev.C). </s>
<s> Everything is fine except for this: Each time I start Windows 2000 Pro, it tells me that it has found new hardware and to insert the cd that came with it. </s>
<s> I would like this not to appear each time I start Windows. </s>
<s> How would I do that? </s>
<s> PC particulars: MoBo = ASUSTek P4S533 REV 1.xx Bus Clock = 100 Mhz BIOS = Award Software, Inc. </s>
<s> Revision: 1009 09/09/2002 OS = Win 2000 Pro RAM = 768 MB Processor = Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz If you need more info pls ask. </s>
<s> Go to your bios select Advance under Integrated Peripherals your network settings should be there and this disabled it. </s>
<s> If not, refer to your manual. </s>
<s> You can just bring up Device manager, double click the onboard NIC and click on Disable and that will do what you need. </s>
<s> If disabling it in the BIOS doesn't end this problem that works just as well, you don't need it disabled in the BIOS to use another network card. </s>
