You've lost the discussion since you had other electrical paths for damage to occur. Sorry to hear about your loss. Bob

The best surge protector no matter what brand can only &quot;reduce/limit&quot; the damage to a system. If you're lucky, it stops damage other than itself, otherwise it migrates down the path taking the weakest componets out. A simple electrical surge is reduced or stopped but a &quot;electrical/lighting&quot; hit is another matter, you're dealing with the big stuff well into millions of volts or its range of joules potential. Just call or inform the surge protector co., that after a surge, the system wasn't running when it was before. You shouldn't need to anything other than that. You can place your system elsewhere to see if it powers-up w/o the surge protector, etc.. good luck -----Willy

The damage would have to be very evident such as parts blown off the board for them to say it was the protection device that failed to protect. Sorry to hear about your loss, but seeing PC failures daily for a multitude of reasons I can only write that it's doubtful since the power supply is next in line for the line voltage to cause an issue and fail. Not the motherboard. Bob
