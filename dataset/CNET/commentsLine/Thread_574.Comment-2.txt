given we can create this issue on insecure or wep secured networks why can't it be this network?
i read your post twice and can't find the security setup.
in short our forum sticky tells a setup we find to help with the issues.
a. stock settings.
b. ssid broadcasting.
c. wpa or wpa2 if you can support it.
