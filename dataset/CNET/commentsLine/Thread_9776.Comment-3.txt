consider that printer manufacturers practically give away their low end products with the expectation of making money on ink and other consumables.
you may pay less per page for ink with some higher priced printers that use high capacity cartridges where each only holds one color.
color laser printers will be cheaper per page but you get sticker shock when replacing them.
color laser printers do not produce the best photo quality but are great for other uses.
