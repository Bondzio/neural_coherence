I have an outside-the-box question for you... Is it possible that one of your power dongles from the PS to your card are screwed up somehow?
This could result in lower than expected current flow to your video card and all sorts of funky problems.
I know the Gateway didn't have sufficient power cables on the PS when I got mine so I had to pick up some splitters.
It may be possible that one of yours has some hidden damage.
If so, this could be a three dollar fix.
Just a thought.
