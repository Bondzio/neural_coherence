the speed gain is there on the apple but here's the big deal.
windows still has proven to be less than happy with firewire connected drives.
i won't vet all my answers but here's what i would use.
1. said drive.
2. usb 2.0 3. ntfs for the file system since the new apple osx can read and write to that.
be sure that they know to not &quot;store&quot; things there.
it's not &quot;storage.&quot; if there is any doubt about that, read all the posts in this forum.
