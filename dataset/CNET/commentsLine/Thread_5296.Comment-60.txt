yes, 256mb video memory is pretty hefty, enough to run even some of the most graphically intense games on the market.
the term &quot;integrated&quot; refers to the fact that the gpu(graphics processor unit) is part of the system board and not a plugin card.
it derives its memory from the ram that is for the regular memory on the system board.
depending upon how much the main memory is, 2gb, 3gb even 4gb, depending on the system, processor and peripheral chips have limitations, the video memory is subtracted from that value.
in a worst case event, you could diable the onboard video and install a video card with more memory to support a newer game that requires more than the 256mb supported by the integrated system seyup.
