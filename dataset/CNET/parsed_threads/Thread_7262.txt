<s> A few months ago, colleges that my dependent was accepted to ALL said there were no requirements as to desktop/laptop, OS, 32/64/dual core. </s>
<s> All these major universities had laptop to check out in the libraries. </s>
<s> Dorms have internet capablity. </s>
<s> Now the IT department of university chosen is saying the way to go is a laptop that is dual core (T2300, T2400, or T2500) and Vista capable. </s>
<s> So what's everyone's take: A decent desktop running XP Home and MS Office or a new laptop priced from $1300 that is dual core and supposed to support Vista? </s>
<s> Since Vista isn't here many a vendor can say it supports Vista, but its not set in stone yet. </s>
<s> Students perfer laptops but a decent desktop does just as well. </s>
<s> If cost is an issue a desktop will do fine. </s>
<s> If cost isn't then a laptop is better only if because its mobile. </s>
<s> Please don't exclude any insurance as laptops are the number 1 item stolen on campus next to ipods. </s>
<s> As for dual core, that's fancy stuff if you need it, get it but basic single core does fine and overall for all tasks whatever they maybe. </s>
<s> For an entering freshman, a desktop is OK, as needs become more clearer, then spring for a new laptop maybe in the jr. year. </s>
<s> Also, expect the need for a flashdrive and/or wireless option for whatever system is gotten should be part of the package. </s>

<s> At one college a plan with Dell was something you would kill for. </s>
<s> It included 4 years of service. </s>
<s> Very amazing deal. </s>
<s> They also supplied a list of machines. </s>
<s> It was bound to happen that someone would kick up the requirements. </s>
<s> Will those have have substandard units upgrade? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There is a company through school that does sell laptops and desktops (laptops are primary). </s>
<s> The only major difference between other vendors is that they provide 4 year program; but no software is listed. </s>
<s> Others of same price, memory, HD, processor usually have XP Pro or Windows Media. </s>
<s> The academic deals for the OS and Office reduce that effect but service for your laptop is EXPENSIVE. </s>
<s> I'll write in the near 1 thousand buck range for the LCD or motherboard failures. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just finished my freshman year at college, and I have a laptop. </s>
<s> As long as you have a MODERN laptop (not one that's three or so years old like mine), a laptop should take care of every need a college student has. </s>
<s> It's definitely good to have a USB drive laying around, as they get used A LOT. </s>
<s> Right now, Vista really isn't that big of a deal for a college student, so I wouldn't worry about that little part. </s>
<s> Windows XP will do fine. </s>
<s> And dual core is a nice touch, but it isn't necessarily needed. </s>
<s> The only real problem with laptops is screen size. </s>
<s> There have been reports released that staring at small (12&quot; of so) laptop screens for hours (as college students are prone to do) can be very bad for the eyes. </s>
<s> Therefore, I'd suggest getting something with a decent-sized screen. </s>
<s> Mine is about a 13&quot;, and it's a little small for me, in my opinion. </s>
<s> Just make sure it's something that will be comfortable to look at. </s>

<s> I want to thank everyone for their input. </s>
<s> Her desktop has wireless capability and she has a USB drive because it was policy at high school not to allow diskettes from outside sources. </s>
<s> She doesn't really like working on a laptop, so I was surprised when she said this. </s>
<s> The ABSOLUTE minimum requirement in my opinion is a 64-bit processor. </s>
<s> This is something to watich for because Intel currently doesn't have a 64-bit mobile chips yet (unless you count the Pentium 4, which runs too hot anyway). </s>
<s> Dual-core isn't too important because few applications can take advantages of dual-core. </s>
<s> For the desktop: Any AMD chip with 64-bit will be enough (including the Sempron). </s>
<s> Intel is ok but their chips output more heat which translates to more fan noise. </s>
<s> If you absolutely need a dual-core chip, then go for the Pentium D 9xx series. </s>
<s> Avoid the 8xx series becuase they run MUCH hotter and a little slower. </s>
<s> The one exception would be the 805 because it isn't as clocked as high so it's thermal output is less. </s>
<s> For the laptop: Currently the only 64-bit laptop chip that is out there is the Turion 64. </s>
<s> Intel chips get better battery life but they don't have 64-bit support. </s>
