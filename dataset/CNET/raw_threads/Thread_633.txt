I have a maxtor HD that is intermittent noisy and I have received an exact replacement. I need to transfer my settings and files to the new drive so I can return the noisy one. How can I accomplish this and how can up backup to a DVD. Thanks

Believe Maxtor has such software that usually comes with their retail drives or can be downloaded from their website.
