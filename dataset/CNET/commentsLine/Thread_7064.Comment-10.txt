chrishandyman, thanks for your reply.
i'll check out the epson, but i think the ink is a little expensive.
as i said, i have a friend who has an epson and it needs to 'go to the well' rather frequently!
i have had a few problems with stick on labels, which is why i posted my question.
(i've also had a problem answering more than one post at a time!
the forum won't accept this, so i have to exit and reenter to answer each post!)
regards, colinito
