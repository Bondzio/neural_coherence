The third one, however, seems invisible to the first two, even though it can see THEM. All computers have Norton Firewall, which are all set to allow the network activity. What gets me, is that all computers can ping each other with no problems. What the heck is wrong with this third computer? They are all running Windows XP.

Try disabling it and the built-in Windows firewall and see what happens. I bet they'll all be able to see each other and be able to connect to each other. If this works, you'll need to edit the firewall rules in Norton.

Once the computer I was at found the other computer, I could then do file sharing or whatever I wanted. Just because the computers don't show up on each other screen doesn't always mean you can't get one computer to find and work with another computer. I do remember that if one computer didnot find the another computer it was usally caused by the computer being disconnected. I then rebooted all the computers and then tried again.
