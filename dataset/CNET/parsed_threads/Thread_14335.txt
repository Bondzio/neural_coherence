<s> My kid's machine taps about 95 Watts or less sitting there and I think I measure 110 Watts during game play. </s>
<s> Which is far better than some older machines we had. </s>
<s> While it only had 2GB when we installed Windows 7, we knew to install the 64 bit since we didn't want to install the OS again later. </s>
<s> It ran very well and then later, the second 2GB was added. </s>
<s> The HP d5000 was all of 369 bucks at geeks.com and quite the bargain unit. </s>
<s> Yes we added the gt 220 and used one of the Windows 7 family pack licenses so you can get an idea what the grand total was. </s>
<s> The kid's happy so I can only hope that he doesn't bug me for a new machine this year. </s>
