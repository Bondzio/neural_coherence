I was using DSL so I didn't need it and before then it was working fine. Now I need to use dial-up again. I've since deleted the modem from the device manager and hardware profile and have physically taken the modem out and re-installed it but even the hardware device wizard didnt detect it when I put it back in the slot. I've downloaded a number of drivers (with my other computer) but nothing. Could this be a problem with the BIOS now? What can be done?

It's usually the last (furthest away from the AGP slot) or the first one (right next to the AGP slot). If you have it in either of those slots, move it to another, and then see if windows finds it.
