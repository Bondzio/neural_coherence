<s> I am considering purchasing a new tablet. </s>
<s> I have narrowed the list to the Kindle Fire HD ($159) or the Nexus 7 ($229). </s>
<s> Games and reading are my only interests. </s>
<s> Is the Nexus worth the extra $70? </s>
<s> At the office we have the Nexus 7 (original) and at home the Fire 7 HD. </s>
<s> The Nexus has the edge on the Kindle as there are more book readers there and you don't have as closed an ecosystem. </s>
<s> Games are a few more too. </s>
<s> But for Amazon Prime Video the Fire 7 HD is hard to beat as we have ours connected to the HDTV with HDMI. </s>
<s> It's the best player I've seen in years. </s>
<s> Tough choice but I like the fact the Nexus is more open and still has the Kindle app. </s>

<s> for reading purposes you have many apps which let you get a perfect reading experience..also the display and the resolution of the screen boost the quality.. for games nexus 7 is definitely the best..and by connecting a keyboard and mouse or a gamepad to the nexus using an otg cable you will have great fun as processor is very fast..no issues of hanging or crashing just go with this brief comparison: http://www.tabletcurry.com/compare-tablets.php?ctablet []=Asus+Google+Nexus+7+%282013%29+16GB&ctablet[]=Amazon+Kindle+Fire+HD+7+16GB the website is for india so dont think about price or date of release.. </s>
