The pin configuration seems so strange, i don't know if it's a 5 or 6 pin set up! Can anyone help me? thank you!

Again, change the drive to a new enclosure and you'll fix this in much less time that anyone expected. Here's a tutorial -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FlySnyJ0CQ

You use your DVM or, if lucky, wiring color codes to figure out what goes to where. You get soldering and splicing equipment...maybe a grommet or two. I can't give exact step by step but this can be done. You're result may be ugly and it won't be UL approved. Make sure you're home insurance is up to date. Or, use Bob's advice.
