1.1.1	200 MHz P55C Intel Pentium MMX CPU , 64Mb SIMM 72pin EDO RAM , Asus SP97-V motherboard , Win98se OS , 245watt AT power supply , 2 Western Digital 2.5Gb & 8Gb ( 8Gb partitioned into 4 logic drives ) hard drives , Sony CDROM drive , AT mini-tower case , 5.25 & 3.5 floppy drives , ISA modem , PCI S3 Stealth V64 video card , and a ISA SB16 sound card .	St
1.1.2	Put this system together by parting out of 3 win95 based computers .	St
1.1.3	System will be used for retro games , Office 97 applications , out-going email , and faxing .	St
1.1.4	I have the system running stable , that means restarts from win98 shut down menu cause freeze on shut down screen and soft boot during startup ( pre windows loading ) cause freeze .	St
1.1.5	I configured the hard drives to be on the same primary IDE cable , 0 as master , 1 as slave , and put the CDROM on its own secondary cable as a slave .	St
1.1.6	The system would boot showing the drives as present and working on the next boot the slave drive failed to be recognized .	St
1.1.7	The pattern was hard drives okay , good boot , and the next boot , bad boot , un-recognized slave drive with reduced computer speed .	St
1.1.8	I re-configured the CDROM to be on the same primary IDE cable as the master hard drive , and put the slave drive on its own secondary cable .	St
1.1.9	The boot with un-recognized slave hard drive went away and the system is stable .	St
1.1.10	What is going on here ?	Ques
1.1.11	Why cant I get a stable system with the hard drives located on the same IDE cable ?	Ques
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	This was a known issue with some older systems .	St
1.2.3	The cause was most commonly tracked down to a BIOS issue .	St
1.2.4	See if you can find if it has been updated .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	Another trick I use is to use 80 conductor cables and follow the jumper rules to the letter .	St
1.2.7	There are some that will try non-standard jumpering ideas but I leave them to experiment .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	I will check on the BIOS version and update if I need to .	Sug
1.3.2	I will try the 80 wire cable .	Sug
1.3.3	Is this a fix ?	Ques
1.3.4	On top of the WD 8Gb drive ( jumpered as slave ) there is a note about if used with a 2Gb drive a special jumper settings maybe needed and the diagram shows an additional jumper placed on the pins beside the slave pins .	St
1.3.5	Ill get the drive model numbers and see if WD has any info on this .	St
1.4.1	Get rid of Windows 98 - unless your that nostalgic .	St
1.4.2	Worn-out W98 installation CDs will cause this because you never get a clean reinstall .	St
1.4.3	The exact same thing happened to me .	St
1.4.4	Also , reconfigure your jumpers to original setups .	St
1.4.5	Just how old is that CPU ?	Ques
1.5.1	I have resolved the problem , thanks to you .	Polite
1.5.2	I decided to use an 80 wire cable instead of the 40 wire IDE cable , as you indicated .	St
1.5.3	When I pulled the drives out I found a black jumper ( not visible while drive was in computer ) as well as the white jumper I installed to set the drive to master .	St
1.5.4	The additional jumper must have been from previous installation of the drive in another computer where the alternate jumper setting was needed .	St
1.5.5	I pulled the jumper off and re-installed the drives using the 80 wire IDE cable .	St
1.5.6	The drives are working fine now and seem quieter .	St
1.6.1	You got ta say it or the magic wo n't stick .	St
1.6.2	Thanks for the report back and best of continued self made luck .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Well it shipped with Win95 & Win3.1 drivers .	St
1.7.2	My guess is 1997 date of manufacture .	St
1.7.3	It was a Win95 system when I got it ( donated as a pen2 , later learned it was a pen MMX ) .	St
1.7.4	I put in a used drive , just to see if the system worked at all .	St
1.7.5	5 years later , fix or part out time .	St
1.7.6	So Im rebuilding it as Retro System .	St
1.7.7	I couldnt get a stable system with the additional drive in the location I wanted .	St
1.7.8	I pulled the drives out I found a black jumper ( not visible while drive was in computer ) as well as the white jumper I installed to set the drive to master .	St
1.7.9	I decided to use the 80 wire cable because I wanted to see if it would work .	St
1.7.10	I pulled the jumper off and re-installed the drives using the 80 wire IDE cable .	St
1.7.11	The drives are working fine now and seem quieter .	St
1.7.12	The system is stable .	St
1.7.13	As to the use of win98se , I cant install ME because the CPU is below 250 MHz .	St
1.7.14	I have a Linux live CD I will try , but if you can think of another OS please feel free to post .	St
