i did a little looking around and have been unable to find such a thing.
to avoid picking up any trojan horse type problem, and there are only a couple of them around, just refuse to download any software that you did not specifically ask for.
one of the popular ones currently doing the rounds, happens when a user tries to view a colored (usually blue) video.
they are informed that they need a special codec and directed to the download site.
due to the lack of blood in the brain, the user downloads the codec, unpacks it, gives it permission to install itself and find their machine compromised.
apple software update notifications are the exception to the rule here.
you can download those without a problem.
about that website and ie 7. have you ever tried with another browser or have you just used ie because the site guys said you should?
