it's beginning to seem to me that it is all set up this way to kind of monopolize the help and support area of their business.
however, if this is anywhere near true then why in the world would they have established links to the microsoft help and supprt page - that do not work?
could it be that they cannot remove them because they are an intrinsic part of the vista os?
and if this is indeed true, then why aren't a lot of folks talking/complaining about it?
