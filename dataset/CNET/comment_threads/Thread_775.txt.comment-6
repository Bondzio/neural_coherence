jzou, I don't know which AMD and Intel processors you considered, but figuring out what CPU to buy is probably the single most diffficult decision when you're building a PC.
Used to be, you could just look at the processor family (386, 486, etc.)
and speed, then look for a DX or SX suffix, and you had all the information you needed to compare parts.
These days, you need a good, up-to-date reference in order to know just how one processor compares to another.
While in the past I have favored AMD processors for the same reason you originally did -- lots of bang for the buck -- I'm no longer sure if AMD still offers a significant price advantage.
OTOH, unless you're building a computer for gaming, AutoCAD or Photoshop, almost any of today's common desktop processors will have more than enough power for your needs -- and even with those power-hungry apps, the video card is probably more important than the CPU.
I'm more concerned these days with the amount of power a CPU draws, how much heat it generates (those two go together), the amount of on-board cache, and in some cases whether it has onboard graphics; for general computing use, just about any mid-range processor is fast enough, and even some budget procs have plenty of oomph for most of the things my family does.
