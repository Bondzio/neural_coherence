1.1.1	well ive had a huge problem with my PC for a while now specs : asus p5n32-sli dlx pentium D 3.2 4gb ram 2 nvidia 7800 256mb in sli cooler master case with 4 fan side side window ( i will note this system was about 4.5G when i bought it so im desperate to get it working without full replacement . )	St
1.1.2	so about 2 months ago i had a short in my room and trying to run my pc only on a tripplite battery backup because i didnt notice power was out on 1 circuit , a bolt of electricity came out about an inch from my 1000w PS and it was fried .	St
1.1.3	later i bought a bfg 850w and my problems start .	St
1.1.4	all seems well , then about 5 minuets after loading windows normally my PC shuts off .	St
1.1.5	i cant figure anything out and finally take it to bestbuy geek squad ( useless ) and they say the mobo is bad , i have it traded out with a dirty looking but identical mobo through asus warrenty , same problems , so i take it to a computer repair and by this time i was trying to install vista wen this all started so i tried to get it on and bios is the only thing loadable .	St
1.1.6	at the repair shop they use a test PS at 450w and it stays on for a few hours no problem .	St
1.1.7	so i buy a new 700w PS because that is the 2nd larges available in my area ( did order a 1000wPS from newegg but has yet to come ) and everything seems great , i got vista installed and many updates most counterstrike and source run fine at a max 35 % CPU and all is well , until i run the vista rating program and it does the same shutoff .	St
1.1.8	so i do it again with the task manager up and it shuts off at 100 % cpu useage , and all other times it seems to shutoff when maintaining hugh cpu demand above 80 % so i look in bios hardware monitor .	St
1.1.9	i am used to seeing 50c/40c for cpu/mobo but now its showing 70c/35c .	St
1.1.10	( note : it was 54c on cpu beforetaking it to bestbuy . )	St
1.1.11	so i have a few things suggesting power supply overheating and a few saying CPU overheating .	St
1.1.12	please , can anyone give me suggestions .	Ques
1.1.13	if any further info is need please ask .	Sug
1.2.1	also my case is designed for super good airflow and i guarentee thats not it , having a fan blow on back of PC at PS exhaust does nothing , and CPU heat sink ( zalman cnps9500 ) is a freon fill tube and has treated me wellsince i put it in .	St
1.2.2	better than any liquid cooling ive seen when combined with the case airflow .	St
1.3.1	http : //www.heatsink-guide.com/content.php ? content=maxtemp.shtml and if you go get your CPU & quot ; specs & quot ; show your Pentium D 3.2GHz to be 69.8C maximum .	St
1.3.2	Yours is beyond this so I 'd at least leave the cover off until you can get some fresh heatsink compound .	St
1.3.3	Then I 'd get the HSF off , clean and put on the fresh compound .	St
1.3.4	I ca n't count how many times I 'd seen a tech remove the HSF , look at it and put it back on without even a small drop of compound to help fill in the voids they created .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	i knew thermal grease was very necessary but i had no idea that it would make 20-30c difference between a barely there layer from the PC reapir place and the amount i applied .	St
1.4.2	thank you , computer is finally back up and running perfect .	Polite
1.5.1	Thank you for telling the story in your first post .	St
1.5.2	It has enough clues plus a story to have me to think about something specific to try .	St
1.5.3	And yes , the new techs at many & quot ; shops & quot ; will think nothing of pulling off the heatsink to look and of course it works fine & quot ; in the shop. & quot ; You made the & quot ; perfect & quot ; post and put the advice to good use .	St
1.5.4	Best of continued self made luck !	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
