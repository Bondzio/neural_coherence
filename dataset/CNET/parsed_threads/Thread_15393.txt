<s> i have e machines t6212 running win xp with 512mb ram pc3200 at 400mz two ddr channels it says i need to do it in pairs can i do two 512s or do i need to do it in 256s i want to max it out but not sure what i need full specs on the machine is 2ghz athlon64 3200+ 512 ram ddr sdram ati radeon xpress200 160 gb hard drive </s>
<s> You should have 4 slots. </s>
<s> For dual channel support, you populate in pairs....same spec RAM in each color coded slot. </s>
<s> It would probably be best to have all the same and these are generally offered in matched pairs. </s>
<s> As such, you would need 2 matched 2 gig pairs (which is the same as saying 4 1 gig modules. </s>
<s> That would max your PC and make your wallet much lighter as well. </s>
<s> If you want the most bang for your buck, save the money on adding RAM and get a good video card. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> General computing for Windows XP doesn't need more that 512MB of system RAM. </s>
<s> Some games will benefit from 1GB RAM, but that is the most I would install. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Current Radeon Xpress 200 chipset is integrated into the motherboard. </s>
<s> The 128MB of advertised video memory is actually drawn from shared system memory (the existing 512MB of system RAM). </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Adding a PCI Express X16 video card with dedicated video memory (doesn't share system RAM) will improve your system performance more than using 4GB RAM. </s>
<s> If you intend to run some of today's games, definitely get a nice video card instead or more RAM. </s>
<s> Some references: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1790104,00.asp http://www.emachineupgraders.info/ </s>
<s> Dual channel RAM need to be in pairs or else they get lonely and quit working... well dual channel RAM is faster by provide parallel performance to your applications. </s>
<s> depend on your motherboard, which can have 2 or 4 slots, you can support up to 4GB (4 x 1GB) or 2GB (4 x 512 MB or 2 x 1 GB) Some chipset don't support up to 4 GB even with 4 slots, so check your specs with Fresh Diagnose or contact your manufacture. </s>
<s> I recommend a DDR or GDDR3 video card for better performance, which means they do not say TurboCache or HyperMemory. </s>
<s> Go to Belarc.com and download Belarc Advisor. </s>
<s> Once you've installed and run Belarc Advisor...use the info from Belarc and go to Crucial.com. </s>
<s> Enter the info about your system and it will tell you exactly what RAM is available for your system and it's guaranteed to work. </s>
<s> If you do need more RAM ...and it must be installed in pairs you could get 2 DIMMs with 256MBs ea for 512 or 2 DIMMs with 512MBs for 1GB. </s>
<s> If you get 1GB..I recommend you put those in slots 0 and 1 and the old RAM in slots 2 and 3. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> Not necessarily. </s>
<s> However, I'm overly cautious and when you're mixing RAM from different manufacturers and adding 2x512MBs to a system with 2x256MBs, I'd always put the higher density DIMMs, the 2x512s, in the first two slots. </s>
<s> In the event there's any incompatibility or abnormal behavior ... you can pull the 2x256s and still have dual channel and 1GB RAM. </s>
