i am just about to replace my hardrive and have one last question.
my current master hd is understood.
however, i have a second hd that appears to not be a slave.
it is identified as an ide primary master and my cd-rw as the ide primary slave.
question, could i move the ide primary master hd off the ide and to the slave and just leave the cd-rw on the ide?
does it make a difference?
