1.1.1	I have new laptop (HP pavillion dv6-1355dx) running windows 7.	St
1.1.2	I have a HP Photosmart c309a multifunction printer.	St
1.1.3	Unable to connect wifi (ad hoc) from laptop to printer for wireless printing.	St
1.1.4	I created SSID and still can not print anything.	St
1.1.5	Printer LCD display shows symbal that it is doing something but in the end it does nothing but eventially say there is no connection.	St
1.1.6	HP service reps are no help and appear to not really know much about basic stuff.	St
1.1.7	Could some one please help me.	Sug
1.1.8	I am pulling my hair out.	St
1.1.9	Oh yeah, software is loaded too.	St
1.2.1	It too me 4 hours to nail down what our c4780 didn't like.	St
1.2.2	Turns out we had to set the router to 802.11g.	St
1.2.3	It was cranky to non-functional when the router was in it's 802.11b/g/n mode.	St
1.2.4	Can't say if this helps you.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the suggestion, though it did not work for me.	St
1.3.2	If you have any other ideas I am all ears.	St
1.4.1	The typical router with dv6-1361sb Windows 7 Pro, c4780 wifi printer and the change noted.	St
1.4.2	I have not tried adhoc and may never do that.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I have realized that the reason I was having a difficult time setting up my printer for ad hoc was that windows 7 and the software for the printer was not communicating that i needed to followup with more actions.	St
1.5.2	I needed to remove the default printer software that came with my laptop.	St
1.5.3	(Not that I received a printer.	St
1.5.4	Not sure why this was on my computer) I then told my pc to look again for the printer.	St
1.5.5	Other things that may have helped but not sure it really mattered in my case was checking the firewall protection is not to strong and making sure that my pc was set to share with other devices.	St
