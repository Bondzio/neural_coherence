I am just worry if there will be any thing I need to pay attention to before getting a new sata harddrive. My motherboard is an asus tusl2-c intel815ep chip set. I would like to set the SATA as the master drive with an adaptor and then attach and ata drive just for data storage as slave. will I be asked to intall an driver with intalling winxp since I no longer had a floppy disk.

I suppose you could put the driver on to a CD-R but I have only seen reference to SATA drivers being installed from a floppy. Not sure if XP setup would see a cd-rom drive in it's initial setup phase, other than being able to boot from it of course, which is made possible by the BIOS.
