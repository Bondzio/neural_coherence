...hardware requirement for the operating system.
windows media centre edition works fine without any tv tuner(s) installed.
for those who do want a media centre os, and may wish to add some tv functionality later, it can handle up to 4 tuners (2 analogue + 2 digital).
conversely not all tv tuner's need mce, and ship with w98/xp software and drivers.
there are also those tv tuners which only ship with mce software too, so consider check carefully, if anyone's thinking of doing so.
