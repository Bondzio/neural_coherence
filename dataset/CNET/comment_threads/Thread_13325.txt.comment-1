Hi, im running my own webserver at home and since i dont want to have 1 computer turned on the whole day, i thought of having 2 instead so they can help each other.
In order to do that, they need to have the same place to store the files, in this case an external hard drive.
I know that a usb switcher is an option, because it would allow me to turn off one computer and switch the hard drive to the other that is on.
However i wonder if there is a way to have them both connected at the same time without having to switch them every time so i would just need to turn on one and turn off the other.
Could you please give me a hint?
Thank you.
