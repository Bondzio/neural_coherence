1.1.1	I've a Sony DVD Burner DW-D26A installed on my PC.I've worked with DVD-5 discs without problems.I get some DVD-9 discs to make copies of my movies.Since I bought my DVD drive,I've used the NTI DVD Maker software to burn the discs.Using that software I can't burn a DVD-9 disc.Could someone tell me what should I do to burn a DVD-9 disc with mi DVD drive,or if I need an extra software???
