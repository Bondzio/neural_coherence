System Info: Pentium 4 2.8GHZ RAM type: DDR2 Original RAM: 2 DDR2 PC-3200 258Mb Sticks # of RAM Slots: 4 PC Brand: Dell Dimension 4700 Series with Windows XP *Requires RAM to be installed in pairs ~~~~~~~~` Problem: I tried to put a 1Gb stick of DDR2 5300 into my PC.
I took out one of the 258Mb sticks and put in the 1Gb stick.
I put my case back on, and booted up my machine.
The BiOs told me I had new RAM, and I got to the Windows Xp login screen.
I logged in to my user account, and it ran for a few seconds.
However, then a blue screen came up, and my PC shut down.
Could anyone tell me a solution for this problem?
Thank you.
