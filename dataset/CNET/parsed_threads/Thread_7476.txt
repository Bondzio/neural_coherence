<s> it does sound like an operating system failure, let's see if i can help: if you don't have you're mother board manual, go to the company's web site (use your neighbor's computer or something)and print an online or PDF copy. </s>
<s> using that manual as your guide, follow the steps to enter your BIOS settings. </s>
<s> find the menu dedicated to computer boot up prcedures. </s>
<s> alter the boot-order so that your cd or dvd drive boots first (the motheboard manual should explain all of the specific steps better) save the changes, but stay in the bios for a moment. </s>
<s> open your cd/dvd drive and insert the operating system's disk (hopefully you have it). </s>
<s> now, when you exit the bios, the system should restart and begin the boot process. </s>
<s> a menu should now open from the cd giving you several options. </s>
<s> those options should include repairing you're operating system, booting from the disk(i think), and a few others. </s>
<s> select the repair option and let it work it's magic. </s>
<s> if that doesn't work or my instructins baffle you, go to the microsoft (or whoever makes your Operating system) website (using that neighbor's computer) and seek more professional assistance. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
