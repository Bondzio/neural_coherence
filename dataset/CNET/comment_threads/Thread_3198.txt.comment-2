I've yet to see any from ATI to Hauppaugge in NTSC recordings.
HD recording is a contentious area with the HD providers not wanting such recorded and the hardware makers wanting to provide recording capability.
You may find recording HD limited to a lower quality and this is not driven by make/model.
