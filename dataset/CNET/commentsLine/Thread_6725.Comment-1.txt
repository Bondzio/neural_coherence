i have a computer running win me.
i want to transfer the files from that hard drive to a computer running win 2000. is it possable to take the hd from the me computer and put it in the 2000 computer as a 2nd drive?
i would then copy the files to the drive that has 2000 installed on it.
i would then put the me drive back in the computer that it was in first.
will all the programs work ok?
