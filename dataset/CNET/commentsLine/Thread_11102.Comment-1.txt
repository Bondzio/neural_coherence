i have just gone from windows 2000 to windows xp professional, full, clean install, and now my graphics card is being recognized only as a pci card (under the cards properties it says that the location is pci 1), also i know that it there is a problem because every time i load up savage, it tells me that my card is in pci mode and this will cause problems, which it does.
i have tried uninstalling the card, reinstalling it, using an older card (that still came up as pci), and had no joy with anything.
my pc specs are as follows: windows xp pro sp1 abit at7 max2 motherboard amd athlon xp 2600+ galaxy geforce fx 5200 (the other card i tried was an abit geforce ti 4200) 1gb pc2700 ram note: i have noticed a few people suggesting that you need to reformat reinstall to resolve this problem, however, seeing as that's what i have just done, i don't see how that would have any effect.
any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.
cheers ben
