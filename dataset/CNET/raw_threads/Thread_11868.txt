Since the install, about 6 GBs of space has mysteriously disappeared from my hard drive. I have installed no other programs. I've already looked at the obvious culprits, such as fragmented files, clearing out the various caches, defragging, etc., and I'm stumped. Network Magic is a very small program (less than 50 MBs), so I'm not sure whether its installation and the disk space disappearance are purely coincidental, or whether there's truly a correlation. Does anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

I've never had it do anything unsightly to any of them, from file cleanups to registry cleanups. In fact, I'd already used it to see if it would make a dent in the 6 GBs of space before I did your fix. Again; thanks for the help.
