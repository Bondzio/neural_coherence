amd athlon xp 3200+ 1gb (2x512mb) pc3200 ddr ram 160gb hd ati x1300pro agp 256mb (integrated gpu for now) 19in.
widescreen envision lcd 1440x900 every time i attempt to play some video or load a game my computer restarts.
originally i thought it was my video card, so i pulled the ati card out but i am still getting the same problems.
now i'm beginning to think that its the ram.
however, this raises a few questions.
1. i have 2 sticks of 512mb pc3200 in there.
1 samsung module is oem and came with the pc.
the other stick is pny brand.
is it possible that only 1 stick has failed, since i am not getting a total system failure?
i am still able to do basic tasks on the internet and such, but its the large stuff that will trigger the restart.
or have both sticks failed?
2. if only 1 stick has failed, which one would it likely be?
i'm thinking the samsung, since it is a poorer quality stick.
or maybe the pny?
3. is there any way to test my ram without using a program that uses a floppy?
i don't have a floppy drive.
and the programs i've seen want you to create a floppy boot disk.
thanks alot.
