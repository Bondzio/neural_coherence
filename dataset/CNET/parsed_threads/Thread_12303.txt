<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> I posted a topic a while back about internet problems, but I'm back again. </s>
<s> I`m using a LG x120 netbook. </s>
<s> My wireless router is DLINK DIR-601. </s>
<s> Operating system: Windows 7 What happens is my internet stops working for gaps at a time. </s>
<s> It will not disconnect, but the page will stop loading and lead me to the cannot display page. </s>
<s> When I posted my problems before, here were some of the responses: 1) Reset your wireless router to factory settings, then set it up again. </s>
<s> ---I did this, set it up as followed on the instructions, still having the same problems. </s>
<s> 2) Make sure you are using WPA and not WEP. </s>
<s> ---I am. </s>
<s> 3) Make sure your firmware is up to date. </s>
<s> ---There is nowhere on DLINKs website to download a `firmware update`for the DIR-601. </s>
<s> There is a webpage that lets me log into my router, and it says I am FIRMWARE 1.00NA. </s>
<s> 4) Try unplugging for 30s and plug back in. </s>
<s> ---Tried it, still problems. </s>
<s> Here`s something else that might help, I am not sure: When the internet does cut out and I get the error webpage, I click the `troubleshoot` button and Windows does its scan for errors type thing. </s>
<s> This is usually what happens. </s>
<s> 1) Scans. </s>
<s> Result: Windows couldn`t identify the problem. </s>
<s> Fixed. </s>
<s> Internet now works again until next cut out. </s>
<s> 2) Scans. </s>
<s> Result: DNS server isn`t responding. </s>
<s> Fixed. </s>
<s> Internet now works again until next cut out. </s>
<s> 3) Scans. </s>
<s> Result: Windows cannot automatically detect this network`s settings. </s>
<s> Fixed. </s>
<s> Internet now works until next cut out. </s>
<s> Please help me, I am so frusterated. </s>
<s> I am not only frusterated by my slow, cutting out internet at my home, but I am more frusterated at the fact that I don`t know very much about computers and I can`t fix this. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for helping me out forum... </s>
<s> Has suggested settings. </s>
<s> I can't find your router settings so here they are again. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Router defaults. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> WPA security. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That's what you said last time, and I just stated again in this topic that I've done that, and it hasn't fixed anything. </s>
<s> When I log into my router, and try to make changes, and save, it says &quot;This feature has been disabled on this emulator.&quot; </s>
<s> This tells me you are not changing the router but the netgear or other emulator page. </s>
<s> SHARE THE URL of that router setup page for confirmation. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.support.dlink.com/emulators/dir601/100NA/login.html I login as ADMIN and try to change the settings, but anything I click will give me a &quot;This feature is disabled...&quot; message. </s>
<s> This explains why you haven't made the changes to your router. </s>
<s> Sorry but I would be guessing if your router is at: http://192.168.0.1 This can vary but that's a common one. </s>
<s> Thanks for telling what you were doing. </s>
<s> It explained a lot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for taking the time to find/type that link for me, Bob. </s>
<s> I entered the settings from that URL, and found that I am using the newest firmware and using WPA. </s>
<s> I changed it to WPA2 because it said something about stronger connection with it. </s>
<s> So.. </s>
<s> I guess everything looks good now. </s>
<s> I hope so anyways. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help. </s>

<s> There is no need to panic yet but I do see the biggest problem is that not everyone wants to be their own IT STAFF GURU and dust bunny collector. </s>
<s> Hope all this helped you out, Merry Christmas, Bob </s>
<s> Hey Bob, it's happened again. </s>
<s> My laptop disconnected twice tonight, about an hour between the two times. </s>
<s> My roommates laptop didn't disconnect at all. </s>
<s> Do you have a suggestion for a next step..? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> See if your machine has newer wifi drivers. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Replace the wifi card. </s>
<s> If you are running P2P downloads, wifi is known to buckle. </s>
<s> Not much you can do for those that haven't learned to get wired for that use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Got this router for x-mas, sigh, nice thought, but total absolute junk. </s>
<s> To fix the constant disconnect: 1 go into your router settings 2 click &quot;advanced&quot; tab up top 3 click &quot;advanced wireless&quot; tab on left 4 change the beacon period to 20 This will slow down the connection speed somewhat(about 20%), but will enable the router to hold a steady connection. </s>
<s> Wonder what is an adequate time period before I &quot;accidentally&quot; break it and get a new one. </s>
<s> Seriously total junk, D-link never should have put it on the market. </s>
