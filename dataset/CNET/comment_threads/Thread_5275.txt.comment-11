If you're running XP and you have loaded Microsoft SP2, the trouble could be the Roxio installation.
Some versions of XP auto-install Roxio MediaPaq Browser or the Roxio CD maker.
If you are lucky enough to get past the boot go to Search and delete anything that has Roxio in its title.
I doubt if you'll find Roxio in your Uninstall Program list, but you may, so check that first.
Roxio's website has a free download that solves this problem.
