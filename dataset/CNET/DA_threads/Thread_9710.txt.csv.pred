1.1.1	I have an HP Pavilion 513n with a 1.8gig processor.	St
1.1.2	Previous to my problem the computer had been sitting for several weeks.	St
1.1.3	I had taken the memory out and had not fully replaced it into the mobo slot.	St
1.1.4	Without realizing this I turned on the computer.	St
1.1.5	It beeped a lot, the power button light was on, and the HD access light stayed on continuously.	St
1.1.6	When I realized what I had done, I unplugged the computer and replaced the memory solidly into the slot.	St
1.1.7	Since then when I boot it, I get the screen message &quot;Operating System Not Found.&quot; When I go into setup, it shows no primary master or slave drive.	St
1.1.8	It shows my memory, floppy drive and DVD-ROM(as a secondary master) correctly.	St
1.1.9	The computer will boot from the floppy drive with a windows 98 boot disk.	St
1.1.10	It runs programs from the floppy disk without problems.	St
1.1.11	I have tried a different,working HD.	St
1.1.12	I can hear it running, but the BIOS will not recognize it is there.	St
1.1.13	I have switched cables.	St
1.1.14	Nothing I try has worked.	St
1.1.15	Any help would be appreciated.	St
1.1.16	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Try this.	St
1.2.2	Attach the HD and 80 conductor IDE cable to the SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL.	St
1.2.3	Does it detect it?	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	.	St
1.4.1	Thanks for all the suggestions.	St
1.4.2	I reset BIOS defaults without any success.	St
1.4.3	I then disconnected the DVD-ROM and connected that cable to the HD.	St
1.4.4	The computer booted fine.	St
1.4.5	But then I took the cable in the primary slot and moved it to the secondary slot(the one that the DVD-ROM was in).	St
1.4.6	After this the computer would not boot again.	St
1.4.7	In other words the cable was bad the whole time.	St
1.4.8	Once again thanks for the help.	Polite
1.4.9	James	St
