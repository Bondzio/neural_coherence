dear sir/madam, i have just completed the home build of my own computer: motherboard: gigabyte ga-965p-ds3/s3 cpu: intel core 2 duo hdd: samsung hd400ld - ide video card: geforce 8500gt cd/dvd: lite-on corp - lh-20a1s - sata (pwr+data) monitor: samsung syncmaster 2032bw (dvi) psu: akasa - ak-p050 fg8 so far these are the only components connected.
all seems ok during bios and post and i have set bootup to first cdrom, second hdd, third floppy.
my problem is at end of bios and all details are on monitor boot from cd/dvd is indicated, the windows vista office home and student 2007 installation disk is active and runs on my cd/dvd drive for 1 minute and slows down eventually stopping.
there is no error message on screen, only boot from cd/dvd: and nothing else.
i have tried changing many enable/disable functions in bios with no changes.
i have verified both drives and they run, all fans run, leds all active.
there is something i'm missing!
any help appreciated.
