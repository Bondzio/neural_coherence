alright... let me run down everything that has happened so far: this started out when i was building an entire new system, including these components: asrock 939dual-sata2 (motherboard) raidmax 450w power supply xfx geforce 6800gt agp 8x (video card) amd athlon 64 3200+ (processor) 1024 gb corsaid ddr400 ram okay, so i installed everything correctly, but i left something out: the power going from the power source to the video card.
i turned the computer on, and when giving it power i got a screeching sound which sounded like it was coming from around my power source or processor.
i (stupidly) let the thing make this sound for about 10 seconds and then it shut down, and i smelled a faint burning smell (i am pretty sure this came from my power supply when i got down and checked).
i couldn't get the computer to come back on after that.
i used the 420w power supply which came with my case next, and found the same thing happening (at the time i didn't know this was because i didn't have power going to video card from the power source), but i quickly turned the computer off.
now i am stuck.
when hooking the power up to the video card (which i recently realized i needed to do, although all too late) everything appears to run fine but i can't get a display to appear on my monitor.
i need to know which parts are beyond repair so i can rebuild this system... i checked the motherboard for any spots of burns or anything and found none, but it could still be messed up.
i haven't took the fan off the processor to check it yet, but i will do that after this post.
i just need to know if there is any way i can test to see which part was affected by this incident: my video card, processor, or motherboard.
are all three bad and do i need to replace them all, or is there any way i can test each part individually?
response would be greatly appreciated.
note: a bunch of this happened in another post, for more info you can read it at
