I also bought a new case (which is no probs), a new power supply: Q-TEC 450W, new RAM: Kingston 512MB DDR Pc3200, and a new processor: AMD 3200+. I kept my old graphics card: Nvidia 64MB Ti-4200. I connected all the items to the MOBO and did what it said in quick set up, but when I turn the computer on it doesnt even do a P.O.S.T, no bios beeps nothing, all the fans come on but nothing else no monitor response nothing. I just wondered if someone could help me!!! THANK YOU

Another motherboard had a documentation error and the HD LED was connected (in the manual) to the RESET connection. Again, no boot. Think over what you would do in each case. Bob

Used @BIOS utility to update the BIOS this past Friday and now have the same problem you describe. So much for the Dual BIOS feature. I tried the CMOS reset and that is about it. I have an email in to tech support at Gigabyte. Never needed to ask them a question before so I am not sure how fast they are to respond.
