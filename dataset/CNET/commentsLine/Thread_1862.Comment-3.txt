sorry...i re-read your question and notice that you are using a netgear router...and my answer was referring to a linksys router.
i don't think anything would be that much different...you still &quot;cascade&quot; as i describe...i would contact netgear and get their input.
incidently, my rt31p2 vonage router is the &quot;first&quot; one in line from the modem.
sorry if i confused you with the linksys info
