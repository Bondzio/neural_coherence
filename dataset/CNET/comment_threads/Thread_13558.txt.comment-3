If you use extra video cable, reduce it to the only the orginal VGA cable, check results.
If the problem persists, then use that warranty NOW!
Of course try to adjust the monitor for best results, otherwise you have a bad monitor, maybe caused by shipping, etc.
Cjeck also for any bent, pushed, otherwise odd looking pins on all the VGA cable(s).
good luck -----Willy
