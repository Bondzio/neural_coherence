hi, just got a new game for my dinosaur-age computer.
no really, i have a pci gpu.
my game requires a nvidia geforce 8600. looking onlince, i see a multitude of 8400s, but no 8600s.
i have a couple questions to ask: 1) would it likely work with a 8400?
i would not want to waste my time and money.
2) are the pci's extinct?
would it save me money in the long run to get a new mobo that works with pcie cards?
thank you for the time, i would really appreciate your help, w|r
