1.1.1	On this black friday , I purchased Dell XPS desktop with huge discount .	St
1.1.2	Almost half price of right this moment 's price .	St
1.1.3	However recently while I am researching about dell computer , I found out that quality of dell computer parts are really low and they are using cheap parts .	St
1.1.4	Return policy period is not past and I kept every boxes and every parts of set .	St
1.1.5	Thus I am able to return the product .	St
1.1.6	Do you guys think that I should return the computer ?	Ques
1.2.1	you may as well return it if you can .	St
1.2.2	Then , you can pay twice the price for something else and , the next day , wonder , again , if you made the right decision .	St
1.3.1	Is it real that Dell computer is using cheap and low quality parts ?	Ques
1.3.2	based on what i have seen on the web , I know that among pre-built computer .	St
1.4.1	It has at least a year warranty so would your quality desktop per year be more or less ?	Ques
1.5.1	Dell parts are no better or worse than any other OEM maker ... ... I suppose not to include Apple .	St
1.5.2	If you go around the web you will find a 1000 post bitching about Dell .	St
1.5.3	Why is that ? ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .Dell sells a gazillion machines .	St
1.5.4	I 'm looking at a couple of year old Dell desktop ... ... .works fine .	St
1.6.1	I 'm with you , Dell is as good as any ready made boxes on the market .	St
1.6.2	The only way to get a zoot kick butt whiz bang set up is to BUILD IT YOURSELF , which many of us do or spend a bunch of loot and get an ALIENWARE UNIT ... or the alternative go to MAC .	St
1.7.1	This is entirely up to you if you feel you got a raw deal .	St
1.7.2	IMHO , Dell uses the same parts except for the mtrbd .	St
1.7.3	that everyone else uses .	St
1.7.4	Sure , they buy in bulk , but so does everyone else .	St
1.7.5	Unless , your Dell falls apart , then it 's just as good as any other OEM based PC out there .	St
1.7.6	If you want , check 3rd party builders and check prices .	St
1.7.7	Also , remember you get the s/w bundle and OWS which in many cases a huge hunk of the purchase , so beware of other vendors that offer a PC , yet you pay extra at least for the OS or its a billable item .	St
1.7.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	I got the fact that Dell 's parts are same with any other OEM computers , but how about compare with & quot ; Building my own computer. & quot ; If prices are equal , for sure , quality of built computer will be better compare to manufactured computer , but how much different ?	Ques
1.8.2	Because I also considering about building my own computer with money i receive from dell if i return the desktop .	St
1.8.3	What you guys think ?	Ques
