Did you try?
I can't count the times where people want some guaranty from me.
&quot; Can you tell me how to access the post you are mentioning?
&quot; The sticky post is in this forum, the top post today.
Just click on CNET forums: Networking & wireless and there it is.
&quot;Also, I am not sure why I would be quadrupling the efforts to port forward both the dsl and the wifi.
Do i need to do more than what I have already done?&quot; Because you have a double NAT and need to forward twice and your hardware may not work.
You have double the hardware and software at work here so 4 times the possibility of it not working.
