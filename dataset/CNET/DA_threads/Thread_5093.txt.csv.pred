1.1.1	Just bought the samsung galaxy tab 2 and seeking advice on these memory cards .	St
1.1.2	2 specifications come to mind which is data transfer and write speed .	St
1.1.3	My apps will reside on the tab and all other data will reside on the card so I do n't want to over buy for my needs .	St
1.1.4	Can someone tell me what would suffice for my needs ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks , Mike	St
1.2.1	And here that 32GB card was about 32 bucks .	St
1.2.2	Not a deal breaker if I ever wanted to change it to a class 10 if the price was right .	St
1.2.3	Plus it could serve as a memory stick for a few dollars .	St
