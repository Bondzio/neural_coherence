i'm surprised no one told you that 250 watts was well on the low side of what over 1ghz machines should have.
live and learn i suppose, but you'll have to be aware that it's time to consider all the parts that were in the machine to be &quot;suspect&quot;.
the last machine i witnessed do that took out everything except a modem and the fans.
the modem dies a few months later.
never overtax a power supply.
