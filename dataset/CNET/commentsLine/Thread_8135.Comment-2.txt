two areas may confound old hardware users.
1. the isa irq would have to be set in the bios for the sb 16 in question.
the irq is either 5 or 7 depending on the make of the sb16 or its jumpers.
the setting in the bios would either be &quot;legacy&quot; or &quot;non-pci/pnp&quot;.
2. the motherboard drivers are not supplied by microsoft so that is great fun to find.
3. the lack of usb stability is likely item #2 or some other usb issue noted at  too bad you didn't reveal what make/model motherboard.
4. let's be absolutely crystal clear on a very important point.
if it works, don't fix it.
there is no reason to fix a device manager item if your sound card and all is working!
