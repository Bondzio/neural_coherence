<s> Hey everyone! </s>
<s> I'll get the specs out of the way first. </s>
<s> I have an HP dv9000 (2007) and a Macbook Pro (2009). </s>
<s> For the longest time I've backed up my PC on my SimpleTech 250GB external hard drive, which is USB powered (plugs into two ports) I recently installed XP on my Mac so I formatted the external drive and backed up my Mac with Time Machine on the it. </s>
<s> Anyways, now I want to sync it back with my PC. </s>
<s> I connected it, and I could hear the drive attached noise, and it also shows the 'Safely Remove Drive' option, however it isn't listed under My Computer. </s>
<s> In the device manager, I can see it under Disk Drives as 'Hitachi HTS.... USB Device'. </s>
<s> I checked to update drivers and it said everything was up to date and it claimed that it was working properly. </s>
<s> Any ideas on how to format it so that my PC will list it under My Computer?! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Now go research DISK MANAGEMENT and how to use that. </s>
<s> I got it to work. </s>
<s> Device manager won't let you actually do anything to it, thanks though. </s>
<s> A PC doesn't know what to do with a Mac drive, so after searching around, I just had to use my Mac to format it to FAT32. </s>
<s> It's impossible to do anything to it (without third party software) on a PC without doing so, not even in disk manager. </s>
<s> Next time, GPARTED. </s>
<s> GPARTED will touch that drive and we have the sticky post in this forum with the LaCie Miracle that some claim lets us use the Mac formatted drives. </s>
