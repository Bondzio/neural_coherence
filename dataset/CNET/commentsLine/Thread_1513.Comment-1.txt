hi all, i'm going to be upgrading my mobo to an asus a8n sli premium nvidia.
this board seems to fit my needs for gaming, but, i prefer ati crossfire gpu, my gut feeling is that while both use pcie16, that nvidia sli ready board won't allow the ati card to work properly.
not that nvidia isn't a great card, it's really just preference, if i had to, i would use nvidia.
i'll be running an amd athlon 64 x2 4800 with 2 gigs of dual channel ddr2 ram.
any thoughts...
