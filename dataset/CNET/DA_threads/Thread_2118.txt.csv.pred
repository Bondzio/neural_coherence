1.1.1	Hi .	St
1.1.2	I have a Dell Inspiron 5100 , and starting from yesterday , there is this constant ticking sound coming from the speakers , even before Windows is loaded ( in fact , the ticking sound started as soon as I start the computer , even in BIOS ) .	St
1.1.3	If I connect an external speaker , the ticking sound comes from the external speaker instead .	St
1.1.4	Actually , this is what happened : my friend was using my computer to play some mpeg files , when suddenly sound coming out from my notebook stopped .	St
1.1.5	He checked the volume control , but the icon was missing from the taskbar .	St
1.1.6	He went to Device Manager , and ca n't find the Sigmatel C Major inside there .	St
1.1.7	( At this stage , there is no ticking sound yet , just complete silence ) .	St
1.1.8	I started the computer and went to BIOS , and surprisingly , in the BIOS , Sigmatel audio was recognised , but Modem was 'Disabled ' , although in the next page , where I can disable/enable things , the modem was already enabled ( by the way , there is no setting to disabled/enabled Sigmatel ) ( still complete silence ) .	St
1.1.9	My checking in Device Manager confirmed this .	St
1.1.10	I tried fixing the problem by flashing the BIOS to the newest version ( A29 ) .	St
1.1.11	After the flashing , starting from startup , I can hear the ticking sound .	St
1.1.12	When I went into Windows , I checked Device Manager and found my the Sigmatel and modem back in the Device Manager list .	St
1.1.13	I tried playing something in Media Player , but there 's no sound coming out .	St
1.1.14	I tried updating the driver to the newest too , but to no avail .	St
1.1.15	Next , I fiddled with the settings .	St
1.1.16	I moved the Balance setting in Volume Control to left , and I can hear a soft sound ( the song that I was playing ) coming out .	St
1.1.17	Shifting it to right causes no sound to come out .	St
1.1.18	If I connect an external speaker , the song will come out from my external speaker , but I have to set my external speaker to MAX .	St
1.1.19	When I shift the volume control bar to the left , I hear both the song and the ticking sound , if I shift it to the right , the ticking sound is still there ( not louder or softer ) .	St
1.1.20	Muting the audio has no use either , the ticking sound stills come out .	St
1.1.21	What do you think is the problem ?	Ques
1.1.22	What should I do ?	Ques
1.1.23	Is this a hardware problem with the audio ( which is intergrated ) , or ... ?	Ques
1.1.24	Thanks a lot .	St
1.2.1	This may seem like a strange answer but I have a cordless phone which sends a constant ticking sound through my PC speakers if it is placed too close to the PC .	St
1.2.2	It must be some sort of radio interference .	St
1.2.3	IF you have such a phone try turning it off or moving it futher away from the PC .	St
1.3.1	Ticking sound at boot , before snd drivers load .	St
1.3.2	low volume in one speaker , none in other .	St
1.3.3	devices appear-disappear .	St
1.3.4	using headphones instead of speakers may show same result .	St
1.3.5	Sounds like blown audio to me .	St
1.3.6	Too bad you ca n't add an audio card , and that the Dell is out of warranty ?	Ques
1.3.7	If the CDrom has headphone outlet , it is run by audio hardware anyway , so no workaround .	St
1.3.8	Ask for verbal ballpark estimate from local Dell shop or online fixers , so you do n't have to pay $ $ look fee .	St
1.4.1	Yeah , when I 'm on my cell phone anywhere close to my dimension 4100 , it makes a buzzing noisem from the speakers .	St
1.4.2	So I guess it 's either A .	St
1.4.3	) Your phone is too close to your speakers , or B .	St
1.4.4	) It 's actually a time bomb and you need to submerge it in your bathtub promptly .	St
