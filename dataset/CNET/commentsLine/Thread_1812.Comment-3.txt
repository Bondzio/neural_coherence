thank you for your reply but i still don't know how to set the jumper setting on the old drive - western digital drive.
maxtor did include the 80 conductor cable.
they did tell me to set both drives to cs/cable select.
but where is cable select?
their drive has a 5-pin selection.
if i set to slave but i'm afraid of data loss, or whatever.
with much appreciation ron stebbins
