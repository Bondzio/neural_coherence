Hello, I have been trying to play games like call of duty 2 and doom 3 and they run really slow and choppy.
I took this system requirements test and my graphics card was the only thing that failed the test.
So my question is if I want to upgrade a graphics card, can i just upgrade to any graphics card or does it matter what my pc specs are?
I have a Pentium 4, 3.06 ghz, 896 RAM, 146 GB hard drive, ATI RADEON EXPRESS 200, and i have a PCI express slot.
