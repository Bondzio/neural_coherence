1.1.1	Hi Can anyone help me with a problem I cant seem to over come .	St
1.1.2	My current set up is Connected to my master telephone socket ( upstairs ) is a Fibre Optic Broadband modem which then goes into a Huawei HG533 ( talktalk ) Wifi router , giving me WIFI in the home ( connected to multiple Win7 PCs/Sky Box/iPhones/Android Tablets etc ) I have an office out-building which I have a cat5 cable running from the office into my home downstairs .	St
1.1.3	( previously my broadband worked off the telephone slave socket and I could directly connect ) now I am using a Belkin HD powerline connected to the WIFI router upstairs and then plugged in downstairs with the cat5 office cable inserted .	St
1.1.4	In the office I have Netgear RangeMax WNR854T which when the cat5 from the house is connected to the DSL socket which gives me wifi and allows me to direct connect my Win 7PC/IPTelephone/Network Printer/Win7 Laptop .	St
1.1.5	However this creates its own little network and whilst I can get internet ok .	St
1.1.6	I can not see the home PCs and vis-a-versa .	St
1.1.7	I want to be able to transfer files across the full network ( currently using a USB stick ) and print from any machine to the office printer .	St
1.1.8	If I connect the cat5 from the house to a LAN port I can see the full network but have now internet ( or wifi ) in the office.I thought by doing it this way my office router would act as a network hub and allow internet through but it doesnt .	St
1.1.9	I thought I had a pretty good understanding of these things but this problem has broken me ! ! !	St
1.1.10	Can anyone help ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thank you in advance	St
1.2.1	If we want to see the LAN .	St
1.2.2	If you used the WAN port then you are creating another LAN ( sorry if I do n't expand the common acronyms ) on the other side of that router .	St
1.2.3	This is why I use routers for such things but GOOGLE THIS PHRASE - & gt ; How do I use a router as a WAP ?	Ques
1.2.4	That 's all I ever needed .	St
