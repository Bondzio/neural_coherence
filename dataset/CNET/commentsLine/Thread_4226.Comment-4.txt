&quot;my computer still freezes if the lacie is on at restart&quot; if this was my machine, i'd search for the maker of the motherboard's web site and install their latest motherboard driver package.
windows xp does not know or supply drivers for amd based motherboards.
they have a basic package, but not something i would use too long.
at  i see usb 2.0 drivers and the motherboard driver packages.
microsoft will not fetch or install such for you.
best of luck, bob
