i have a question about my current power supply, a 850w thermaltake black widow modular, and the evga geforce 9800 gtx+ ssc graphics card, the system requirements of the card state that a power supply with a +12v rating of 26a is needed to run the card, and my power supply only offers 18a, so heres my question, is that close to enough to run the card with zero issues?
or should i replace it again, even though its new, bought it in november?
and if i need to replace it, where can i find a cheap sub $200 750w-850w power supply with amperage needed by the card?
please answer and thanks to those who do.
