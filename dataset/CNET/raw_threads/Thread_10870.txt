Any mouse is okay, as long as you don't need a power socket. I have big hands so ergonomics counts alot. I also care about the features of the mouse too! My choices so far: Microsoft Arc Mouse Microsoft Explorer/ Explorer Mini Logitech Vx Nano You guys are welcome to give more suggestions. I mainly want to see the other people's opinions about these mice and any problems that may have arisen after usage, since I don't want to encounter the problems with a mouse AFTER I buy it. Thanks alot

That is the first millimeter of movement when it's been sitting still might be ignored. It's there but not a killer reason for me to change it out. I'd buy it again. Bob
