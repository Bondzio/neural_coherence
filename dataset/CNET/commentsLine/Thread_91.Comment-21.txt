i read all the stuff before it and couldn't figure out how a hard drive can be kept cold enough during reinstallation to be worth the time in the freezer!
i can just imagine some poor sod freezing it, rushing to install it, try it but it's warm and fails, remove it, freeze it... forever!
but somehow, putting a drive anywhere moisture is bound to be while keeping it attached to an electrical source is bound to make you very, very unhappy sooner or later.
i had a gateway drive that was bad and failed in 2 months.
it also made the click of death before it was removed.
i would have tried the freezer trick with that 16 mb beauty but gateway replaced it with an upgrade - a whopping 21mb!!!!
- and would have voided that replacement if i'd removed the drive myself.
(by the way, that &quot;garbage&quot; gateway lasted 3 years after that and then only the sound card failed.
go figure.)
regarding an ebay hard drive at any price tho, remember that a hard drive is delicate and may have been working before the shipper dropped it, post office punted it onto a convayer belt that dropped it, and the mail carrier dropped it trying to put it in your mailbox before handing it to a neighbour (who shook it out of curiousity) to give you.
but you're annoyed that you spend (gasp!)
$10???
i suggest you skip the mail order altogether and go to a used computer parts store, test the drive there, and bring it home yourself.
no space in the freezer needed... :-d
