the external case you are using, is most likely, limiting the drive because, it cannot handle a 400gb hard drive.
only new external cases, that are (designed and say) handle up to 500gb drives or more, will work.
most older external cases, can only handle up to 300gb drives or less.
check with the manufacturer, on how much it can handle, or buy a new case that can handle it.
hope this helps.
