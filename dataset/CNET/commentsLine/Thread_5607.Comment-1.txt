my hp hard drive just went splat (i'm at the library now).
the hard drive i have is an ide drive, but the pc i am about to buy has an sata drive.
i'm told i can not put the ide drive in the new pc with the sata drive, as my current pc wont even boot up how can i get the info on the ide hard drive off & somehow on to the new pc with sata drive?
please please help thanks
