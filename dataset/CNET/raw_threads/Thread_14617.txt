Take a moment to craft something more like... Changed the power supply and it still doesn't (something.) In fact, I can't tell if it turns on or not. My definition of &quot;on&quot; here is fans spinning. Not that windows works (or linux.) So given so little words, you could try just the PSU, motherboard, Speaker and the CPU+HeatSinkFan and see if it will power up and beep. If not, you are looking at the four possible bad parts. Bob

Your BIOS batter is a nickle size &quot;silver&quot; battery located near your BIOS chip. Take the battery out and after 5- seconds place it back in. 2. Check your motherboard manual for a jumper connection by your BIOS chip. The jumper has three terminals. Move the jumper over to the bare terminal. That wil turn your BIOS off, clearing your BIOS. After a few seconds, move the jumper back. Just BE SURE to ground yourself to the chassis before you touch anything. Static electricity can kill your motherboard. Hope this works. Good luck!
