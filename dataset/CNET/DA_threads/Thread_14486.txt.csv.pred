1.1.1	Hey guys , I 'm looking into possibly upgrading a few components of my PC , but I 'm a bit out of the loop regarding current compatibilities between some of my hardware/software .	St
1.1.2	I really need to upgrade my RAM , but its the area giving me the most trouble .	St
1.1.3	I 'm currently running a eVGA , nForce 680i SLI 775 T1 , LGA775 , nForce 680i SLI , 1333MHz FSB , DDR2-1200 8GB /4 , PCIe x16 SLI /2 , SATA 3Gb/s RAID 0+1 /6 , HDA , GbLAN /2 , FW , ATX motherboard , with Windows XP Home , and I 'm unsure as to what the best RAM choice would be that is compatible with this .	St
1.1.4	I know I have a 4G limit at DDR2-1200 speed , but if anyone had some suggestions please let me know .	St
1.1.5	I 'm also running a GeForce 8800 GTS 320 MB RAM , that I am thinking about upgrading or maybe running two with SLI , what do you guys think would be the better option ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks a lot everyone .	Polite
1.2.1	or is that your MB 's capacity ?	Ques
1.2.2	If you 're running XP Home , your limit will be around 3.5 GB and any more will either be ignored or will cause trouble .	St
1.2.3	What I 'd do is head to Crucial memory and input your motherboard make & amp ; model number .	St
1.2.4	It 's doubtful you 'll notice any improvement above 2 GB but do n't get more than 4 GB .	St
1.3.1	The 8800 's were nice in their day .	St
1.3.2	Time to look at & quot ; the list. & quot ; Link - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-gaming-performance,3042.html	St
1.4.1	The motherboard can support 8 Gigs , but since I 'm running Windows XP Home 32 bit it maxes at 4 GB .	St
1.4.2	I just do n't know what kind of DDR2-1200 ram to get .	St
1.5.1	Getting any so-called hot ram is n't really going to help even if you 're a gamer .	St
1.5.2	It will still operate at 1200 mode .	St
1.5.3	Though , the heat tolerate or those offered with & quot ; heatsinks , etc. & quot ; will be better to get , if gaming or demanding situations is n't your bag then typical high grade ram will suffice .	St
1.5.4	If that 's the reason for your query , then look for the various ram offering that suggest they 're capable .	St
1.5.5	Most ram vendors , offer some tier-level of ram tolerances , etc. , suggesting they do better than the entry level as in & quot ; cheaper & quot ; or bargain type .	St
1.5.6	Common sense will dictate to you what to get or desire .	St
1.5.7	If getting a whole kit or re-install of ram , then be sure they match or come similar to what you have for best install .	St
1.5.8	If you like to consider upgrading the OS to win7 at 64-bit , you 'll may like the added ram and new win7 as it seems your present PC supports it .	St
1.5.9	Though , you can use the Win7 adviser from MS to test that , just a thought .	St
1.5.10	Alas , as a parting thought as well , have you checked the bios updates .	St
1.5.11	it *may* provide for better ram handling abilities if so directed .	St
1.5.12	Not increase ram but how it handles ram or your mtrbd .	St
1.5.13	per se .	St
1.5.14	& lt ; div & gt ; tada -- -- -Willy & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
