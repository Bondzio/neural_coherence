1.1.1	Problem with a printer here .	St
1.1.2	Compaq IJ1200 printer running on Win2000 Pro .	St
1.1.3	Every time I try to print something , only half of it shows up on the page with the other half of the page being blank ... .. in the sense that the entire picture seems to be & quot ; moved & quot ; to one side so much that half of it gets literally cut off .	St
1.1.4	Printing quality is fine .	St
1.1.5	The alignment has been done and the test page prints fine as well .	St
1.1.6	It worked OK on the same computer while running WinME - the problem has only occured upon installation of Win2000 Pro .	St
1.1.7	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.8	Chris	St
1.2.1	The missing item in your post is what you were printing .	St
1.2.2	If you are printing an Internet Web Page , then I ca n't help you .	St
1.2.3	That issue swirls around the lack of printing in the World Wide Web consortium and specifications at http : //www.w3c.org and is currently in committee .	St
1.2.4	Tell more .	St
1.2.5	bob	St
1.3.1	This happens with picture files in the Windows Explorer ... .. jpg , gif , etc..	St
1.3.2	I have n't tried printing a web page and I 'm not sure about txt files ( although the test page prints fine ) .	St
1.3.3	This is a problem on my dad 's computer - he prints a lot of pictures .	St
1.3.4	I tried a number of them and it happens every single time .	St
1.3.5	Actually , it not only happens when trying to print pictures straight out of the Windows Explorer , but also when trying to print from a special program for scanning pictures , editing them , and so on .	St
1.3.6	To explain it again ... when printing a picture , it should be right in the middle of the printing page .	St
1.3.7	But it ends up being shifted to the side , so that half of it is & quot ; out of bounderies & quot ; of the page and obviously gets cut off ( while the closer half is right by the edge ) .	St
1.3.8	Chris	St
1.4.1	But all the gritty details are missing .	St
1.4.2	OS , printer model , if you uninstalled and reinstalled the printer driver , set printer driver to & quot ; defaults & quot ; , checked the paper size and margins in the printer properties .	St
1.4.3	You get the idea .	St
1.4.4	All that is known is what you 've told ... Tell more .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Did you try updating with W2K drivers ?	Ques
1.5.2	You might try going to Microsoft and checking HCL ( hardware compatability list )	Sug
1.6.1	In the original post I specified that it was the Compaq IJ1200 printer running on Win2000 Pro .	St
1.6.2	I also said that the printer worked fine ( with the same drivers ) when WinME was installed on the same computer a little while back .	St
1.6.3	I reinstalled the driver , everything is set to default , paper size and margins are also OK .	St
1.6.4	The weird thing is that the test page prints fine .	St
1.6.5	If something was wrong in the settings , would n't the test page be printed incorrectly as well ?	Ques
1.6.6	Maybe I 've missed something .	St
1.6.7	I just thought that maybe if someone here came across this problem in the past , they 'd have an answer .	St
1.6.8	I do n't know what else to tell you .	St
1.6.9	Chris	St
1.7.1	All the Windows Updates are done - is that what you meant ?	Ques
1.7.2	I do n't see that particular model on the HCL list , but I see another one from the series - IJ650 .	St
1.7.3	Should n't IJ1200 run also then ?	Ques
1.7.4	Chris	St
1.8.1	Such as Notepad .	St
1.8.2	Double check the margins in the application since they can be amiss .	Sug
1.8.3	Yes , sometimes I miss the items in the post .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Sorry for any confusion .	St
1.9.2	It should .	St
1.9.3	Have you updated with Windows 2000 printer drivers ?	Ques
1.9.4	Check Compaq 's web site to see if you have the correct driver or need an updated driver for your printer .	St
1.10.1	Alright ... ..	St
1.10.2	I printed a large .txt file and it came out OK ( 9 pages in total - no flaws ) .	St
1.10.3	I checked the margins and they 're good .	St
1.10.4	I also tried another .jpg picture and it came out all screwed up again .	St
1.10.5	This seems to be only affecting picture files .	St
1.10.6	Weird .	St
1.10.7	I think I 'm going to contact Compaq and if they do n't have an answer , out the window the printer goes .	St
1.10.8	Chris	St
1.11.1	My dad had an old backup of the last printer drivers and so I re-installed them ( 2 times already ) - but it did n't help .	St
1.11.2	I 'm going to download those same ones myself - maybe his copy is corrupt or something .	St
1.11.3	May as well try that , since I 'm running out of ideas .	St
1.11.4	And I 'm going to contact Compaq .	St
1.11.5	Maybe they know what 's going on , since they made the thing .	St
1.11.6	Thanks for the driver suggestion/reminder .	St
1.11.7	Chris	St
1.12.1	Your posts do n't tell what applications .	St
1.12.2	Wish they were a bit more complete .	St
1.12.3	Bob	St
1.13.1	Hey , Bob , what 's with the & quot ; No further replies to this post will be accepted. & quot ; to your last post ?	Ques
1.13.2	I 'm posting my reply to you here .	St
1.13.3	What do you mean about & quot ; each application can have margins & quot ; .	St
1.13.4	If I am opening up Windows Explorer to find a .jpg in there , then right-click on it to Print it out ... .. how do you set a margin for that ?	Ques
1.13.5	It 's automatic .	St
1.13.6	I do n't quiet understand what you mean .	St
1.13.7	When I said that I checked the margins , I meant in Control Panel - & gt ; Printers - & gt ; Printer Model - & gt ; the Options for it .	St
1.13.8	Chris	St
1.14.1	The forum software limits the depth of the replies .	St
1.14.2	Always have .	St
1.14.3	NOW that you have revealed in good detail how you are printing , instead open the JPEG and print from an application .	St
1.14.4	I see we are inching towards the fix , but do keep trying .	St
1.14.5	Bob	St
1.15.1	This discussion notes one cure .	St
1.15.2	Read reply # 3 .	St
1.15.3	Microsoft does n't tell us why this may work .	St
