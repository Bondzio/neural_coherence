1.1.1	I 'm hoping some of you can help me .	St
1.1.2	I currently have a Logitech MX Revolution mouse and I 'm about to throw it through a wall !	St
1.1.3	It constantly stutters and freezes while I 'm playing simple computer games .	St
1.1.4	I 've tried uninstalling the software to see if that helps and the problem still persists .	St
1.1.5	I 've done a lot of research and I 'm at a loss at what mouse I should try next .	St
1.1.6	I really like the ergonomics of the Revolution which I think means I prefer a palm grip .	St
1.1.7	I also like the cordless factor but I 'm not completely opposed to a corded .	St
1.1.8	I 've been looking at gaming mice like the X8 sidewinder , the Logitech G5 & G9 , Microsoft Habu and the Razer Death Adder but I 'm not sure if the gaming mice would be overkill for me .	St
1.1.9	The Sidewinder seems like it may be too big for me ( I 'm a woman ) from reviews , but I like the wireless aspect .	St
1.1.10	The Razer Mamba is the only one I can find that can switch from wired to wireless but paying over $ 100 for a mouse that has a lot of features I 'll never use seems silly to me .	St
1.1.11	I do not play any hard core games but I would like to get through a game of Luxor without slamming my mouse out of frustration .	St
1.1.12	I have been looking at mice using a laser tracking system because I do n't like to use a mouse pad and use it directly on my desk ( wood ) - another reason the Sidewinder seemed like a good choice due to the blue track system , but I am afraid of the size .	St
1.1.13	Does the DPI or wireless capability have anything to do with the problems I 'm having or is it just the mouse ?	Ques
1.1.14	I would really like a mouse with the same ergonomic build that does n't have the problems I 've mentioned .	St
1.1.15	I have a new computer with plenty of RAM , large hard drive and dual processors so the computer is not the problem .	St
1.1.16	Any advice would be greatly appreciated !	Polite
1.2.1	Hmmm , I would HIGHLY recommend using a mouse pad and specifically a WOW pad , they are designed for use with optical and Laser units .	St
1.2.2	Some of the issues you have been having could be created by the surface and light refractivity .	St
1.3.1	I would also recommended using a mousepad that is designed for the type of mouse you get .	St
1.3.2	Some are only good for optical and some are only good for laser .	St
1.3.3	Aside from that , I do have some expertise in the mouse division .	St
1.3.4	If you like the Revolution , you will probably like the similarly-shaped Logitech G5 .	St
1.3.5	It 's a solid mouse with plenty of features .	St
1.3.6	DPI switching is great , and the weight cartridge is a little gimicky , but is great if you 're picky about weight .	St
1.3.7	If you want something really cool , the G500 will be coming out , which is basically a super G5 .	St
1.3.8	Note that just because you like the Revolutions grip , you do not necessarily have a & quot ; palm & quot ; grip .	St
1.3.9	You know you have a palm grip when you do n't even squeeze the sides of the mouse with your fingers to move it because your palm is on top of it .	St
1.3.10	If you DO have a palm grip , you can probably use one of the SideWinder mice .	St
1.3.11	It 's not really that much bigger than the G5 length-wise , but people feel like it is because of the height on the back .	St
1.3.12	If you rest your whole palm on top of the mouse , you will be fine ... unless your fingers are child-like small .	St
1.3.13	It sounds like you do n't need a lot of slick macro features and rediculously high DPI engines , so I would recommend the G5 .	St
1.4.1	Mice have changed alot in a few yrs .	St
1.4.2	Because of that , they too are becoming another task the system has to service .	St
1.4.3	A std .	St
1.4.4	PS2 mouse just did n't have so many problems .	St
1.4.5	Now add IF or wifi and batteries , etc. , you get the picture .	St
1.4.6	As others suggested , get the required pad for better operation .	St
1.4.7	Understand that during gaming , intense PC usage is at hand even for simple games , that 's fact .	St
1.4.8	Your mouse being yet another device may falter under such conditions .	St
1.4.9	A simple USB may help as being physically connected loses many of the IF or wifi issues .	St
1.4.10	Further , they 're cheaper and/or tend to work in all aspects of what many users want just being cabled is the holdout .	St
1.4.11	Now decide ... ... . tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Thank you to those who replied .	St
1.5.2	I got the WOW pad today and I can not even believe it - my mouse is working perfectly !	St
1.5.3	*knocks on wood* Love this pad b/c it is super thin .	St
1.5.4	I do n't particularly like using a mouse pad to begin with but with this one it is so thin and large that I hardly notice it ( except the mouse glides much easier on it than on the desk ) .	St
1.5.5	I never even thought that would be a problem b/c I was under the impression that laser mice worked on any surface except glass .	St
1.5.6	I have a wood grain desk and thought that would be fine .	St
1.5.7	I also went to Best Buy to try out some mice and the Logitech G5 was my favorite fit , next was the G9 .	St
1.5.8	Did not like the Razer mice - way too flat for me .	St
1.5.9	They did not have the Sidewinder to try and they also did not have the mice out of the packages so I had to feel them in the plastic .	St
1.5.10	Staples had them out but had none of the mice I was interested in .	St
1.5.11	I probably do n't even need a new mouse now thanks to your great advice , but if I do I will probably stay with Logitech .	St
1.5.12	Perhaps I 'll wait for that new one that was mentioned to come out to have a good corded mouse on hand should anything happen in the future As far as the palm vs claw grip : I did some research on what each is and mostly hold my mouse in a palm grip but I did notice that for some games that need greater/more precise movement , I pull my palm up slightly and use my fingers more .	St
1.5.13	I see they call that the fingertip grip .	St
1.5.14	I suppose I actually use both grips , depending on what I 'm doing and I do not use the claw grip at all ( although I also found some people consider the fingertip grip and claw grips to be essentially the same thing - my fingers stay pretty flat which is why I think it 's probably not considered a claw ) .	St
1.5.15	Well , thanks again everybody .	Polite
1.5.16	Your help was greatly appreciated !	Polite
