well, i don't know what to suspect.
others have said check the psu first.
i would think that if the power supply failed it machine would have turned off, not freeze.
after i unplugged the video card, hd, cd drive, all but one stick of ram without any change in it i think only the psu and motherboard are left.
i haven't added new hardware or programs recently.
the only other issue i had is the the latest windows update wouldn't install.
the green power light on the power supply blinks when the computer tries to start.
that would be why i suspected maybe the psu maybe.
