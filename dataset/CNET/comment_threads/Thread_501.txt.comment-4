Sorry I missed it out.
My desktop is 2 1/2 years old, and runs XP sp1 - I was put off by all the probs with upgrading - maybe that is not such a problem now?
The new notebook runs SP2.
I have BTW found an answer on another forum found out how I can swith the print spooler off.
I am still, however having major problems, in that neither computer is seeing each other, despite each being able to connect to the internet.
I will try again later......
