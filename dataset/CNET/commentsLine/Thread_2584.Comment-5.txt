you're looking at a wide range of pcs including media center pcs.
you should decide the top 3 things you want your pc to do, then pick a pc that's good at those things.
for instance, don't spend the extra cash on a media center pc unless you want it to be your media center and you'll be watching tv/movies, timeshifting tv, recording tv/dvds, and listening to music on it all the time.
a regular pc can do these things with a few upgrades, but if you want to put a pc in your living room to do these things often, then get a media center pc.
if your top 3 things you want to do are &quot;play the sims&quot;, &quot;surf the web&quot;, and &quot;download music&quot;, then just get an inexpensive pc.
if you're top three things are &quot;play battlefield2&quot;, &quot;convert dvds to divx&quot;, and &quot;edit videos&quot;, then get a pc with an amd x2 or p4-d and a fat video card like an ati x1800 or geforced 7800.
