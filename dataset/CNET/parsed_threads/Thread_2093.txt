<s> Buying a new Windows 7 64 bit. </s>
<s> I am not a gamer and I don't overload system with too many programs, but for once I would like to have more than enough RAM. </s>
<s> Shall I stay with 4GB or go to 8GB? </s>
<s> My thanks....miki </s>
<s> Then monitor how much of it you use. </s>
<s> No need to spend money on RAM you don't use. </s>
<s> It's easy to add later if you need it. </s>

<s> Windows 7 with 4GB of RAM should be plenty fast if you aren't gaming. </s>
<s> I have 2GB installed and I get by with having multiple browser tabs, Pandora streaming, programs like Outlook, Excel, and Digsby just fine. </s>
<s> I currently have a situation with my 7-year-old Dell XP computer for which, until recently, adding new RDRAM (Rambus) cost about $250 and it was not worth so doing since a new computer was in the near future -- so I do not want to be in that situation again. </s>
<s> That said, methinks 4GB of a different RAM should be fine. </s>
<s> My thanks for your reply.....miki </s>
