The first is the 9500GT 512mb Gddr2, mem clock on that one is 1000mhz, than their is a 1gb version but the mem clock drops to 800. Their is also a 512mb version with gddr3, it's mem clock is 1400mhz, and has a better bandwith speed, all the cards have a 550 core, and are 128 bit. Which would be better 1gb or gdr3 speed. thanks, bigboy
