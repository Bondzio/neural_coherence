Thanks for the replies.
You mention that I should: &quot;check to make sure the heatsink is secured because prescott fans are known to kinda pop off.
Check your BIOS as well to see if there is anything to adjust&quot; I am just learning all this stuff, so I am not sure how to do either of these things.
One thing that the dell tech had me do via phone was hit F12 during startup to run a diagnostic of my hardware, and it didn't find any problems.
The whooshing sound is only loud sometimes when I startup the computer, and it is ONLY on startup.
When the computer is running loud, it doesn't run quite as loud as the initial 'whoosh.'
I am surprised to hear people say these sounds are normal, because I have never encountered a computer fan that was as loud as this, sometimes it is as loud as my air conditioner!
Perhaps it is because most of the Dell computers I use in libraries and offices are Pentium 3's?
Does it really make that much difference?
