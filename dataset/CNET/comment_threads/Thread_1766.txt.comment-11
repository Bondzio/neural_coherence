The Quadro4 900XGL card is circa 2002 and can't be expected to handle any games mentioned.
The only PCI based Quadro that I can find is a Quadro4 NVS280 but it only has 64MB of RAM and can't handle 30+ windows.
It too can't handle any modern games since it only has 64MB of RAM.
3DFuzion made a PCI geforce 6200 and that GPU passes the autodesk certification tests.
The 3DFuzion card is drying up and pretty hard to find -- here's a new one for $55 from eBay: http://cgi.ebay.com/3D-Fuzion-3DFR6200P-Geforce-6200-128MB-PCI-Video-Card_W0QQitemZ300010102958QQihZ020QQcategoryZ40161QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem The geForce 6200 can't handle those games either.
But since its PCI, it can coexist with one of the gaming cards that I mentioned earlier.
If you combine the PCI 6200 with the AGP 7600GS, you'll be right at your $200 budget.
