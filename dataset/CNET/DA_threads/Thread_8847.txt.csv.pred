1.1.1	This is the config i have selected based on my budget.	St
1.1.2	intel pentium 3.2 Intel 945 G chipset board Memmory:-Corsair or Transcend 2Gb 533 MHz DDR-2 HDD 160 GB Seagate Monitor 17'inch flat CRT Samsung 793S Lite-On SOHW-1673S dvd writer ATX Cabinet with 400 Watts SMPS Altec Lansing ATP3 speakers Geforce 6800 GS 256MB PCI-E CARD Tv tuner card: - Play TV @P7000 ( Internal ) PIXEL VIEW ( suggest a better card under 100 $ ) I want this computer for gaming (play all latest games at decent resolution) and also wanna use this as a media center PC.	St
1.1.3	I will be using windows XP with MCE 2005 and then switching over to vista when it arrives.	St
1.1.4	Since i will be using my computer for watching/recording tv i want a system that doesn't make any noise.	St
1.1.5	Can someone here tell me whether the P4 chip or the graphics card make a lot of noise and if so is there any way to reduce it????	St
1.1.6	Noise during gameplay is okay though.Only wanna keep noise down while watching/recording tv.	St
1.1.7	This is the first time i am building a new computer.Please let me know of any combatibility issues or what should be changed .	St
1.1.8	Also is it better to build or buy a media center system that can play games?	St
1.1.9	Also please state whether this config would be enough for vista.	St
1.1.10	Also does it make any difference whether i use 400 MHz or 677 MHz ram on my pc?	St
1.1.11	?	Ques
1.2.1	I have a P4 630 3Ghz and a Leadtek 6800GS Extreme PCI-X.	St
1.2.2	I built the system about 2 months ago.	St
1.2.3	Initially I had some noise problems with this setup.	St
1.2.4	My computer is in my bedroom so I wanted quiet.	St
1.2.5	First off the 6800GS is almost silent.	St
1.2.6	I looked at a number of cards from different makers and chose the Leadtek because of reports that it was quiet.	St
1.2.7	I have to shine a flashlight at the fan to make sure its spinning.	St
1.2.8	The intel heatsink/fan is another story.	St
1.2.9	Not only is it loud, it doesn't work well.	St
1.2.10	I was idleing at 48C with fan cranking.	St
1.2.11	I tried using Arcric Silver 5 and got the temps to 41C.	St
1.2.12	Replaced it with a Arctic Cooler Freezer Pro 7 and realized that my 120mm case fans were really pretty quiet.	St
1.2.13	The high pitched fan noise disapeared with the hs/f and my temps idle at 31-33C and 45C under high load.	St
1.2.14	Replaced stock case fans with Aspire 120mm and now I can barely hear a humming.	St
1.3.1	I've got a similar setup and ScarChunk is bang on the money.	St
1.3.2	The Artic Freezer Pro 7 is (imo) the best after-market coolor for a P4.	St
1.3.3	It's cool and quiet (to steal a phrase) and cheap ($35).	St
1.3.4	Unless you're absolutely sold on a 6800GS, take a look at current pricing on an X850XT.	St
1.3.5	Both it and the 6800GS are starting at $170 on newegg.	St
1.3.6	But the x850XT is significantly faster out the box (no tweaking necessary).	St
1.3.7	It's fan is a bit noisier (but Artic makes a silencer for it also).	St
1.4.1	I'm running Patriot DDR2/667 at 4-4-4-12 (spd is 5-5-5-15) in one PC and GEIL DDR2/533 in another.	St
1.4.2	From the mem tests I've tried and the reviews I've read, name brand DDR2 with spd of 533: 4-4-4-12 will run at 667: 4-4-4-12.	St
1.4.3	The benchmark difference is slight at best (less than 5%).	St
1.4.4	So, your Corsair/Transcend should be fine at DDR2/667.	St
1.4.5	Don't know what your budget is, but hexus.net gave your tuner a so-so review.	St
1.4.6	But at the $50 price point, i 'spose that's expected.	St
1.5.1	OK I've got another thread going, but maybe you've had experience with both.	St
1.5.2	Is DDR2 running at 533Mhz with 4-4-4-12 timings any faster than DDR at 400Mhz with 2.5-3-3-7?	St
1.5.3	I've built a few systems, but I've never really messed with the timings.	St
1.5.4	I'll soon have my hands on a gig of both types and I want to get another gig to match.	St
1.5.5	I've read a bunch of conflicting articles, but most seem to think that unless you get DDR2 with really good timings, DDR is still the way to go.	St
1.5.6	Good timings + DDR2 = $$$	St
1.6.1	Thank you all for helping me out!	St
1.6.2	Also please explain to me :- What's the AMD's equivalent( same or greater speed) of intel type 640 3.2 MHz 2 MB L2 cache processor????	Sug
1.6.3	Also are AMD's fans noisy???	St
1.6.4	?And how many fans do i need to install in such a system(which is comparable to 3.2 MHz P4 system)???	St
1.6.5	Also are AMD CPU's reliable??	St
1.6.6	Will they last for say 5 yrs without any problems?????	St
1.6.7	And finally tell me which tuner card is better:- Pinnacle PCTV Pro or Compro Videomate Tv Gold Plus 2 ?	Ques
1.7.1	The AMD equivalent would be the Athlon 64 3200+, which costs about $160.	St
1.7.2	AMDs are as reliable as Intels, and they produce less heat.	St
1.7.3	I would get an Athlon 64 3700+ San Diego core for about $210 on newegg.	St
1.7.4	Get a name-brand socket 939 board, and some nice DDR400 (AMD doesn't support DDR2), and you're good to go.	St
1.7.5	About the TV tuners: I have no idea.	St
1.7.6	I had one in my PC, and I never used it.	St
1.7.7	When I want to watch TV, I watch it on a TV :P.	St
