hi bob &gt;&gt;i'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by isps.&lt;&lt; no this is not the case for me.
&gt;&gt;you could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product&lt;&lt;.
what do mean i can try ?
could you please explain ?
&gt;&gt;as to port 20, it's part of ftp so need i write more?&lt;&lt; yes i konw that port 20 is a data port on a server side.
when the client uses active mode, the server only needs to receive connections on port 21, so forwarding only port 21 is sufficient for that.
&gt;&gt;also worth noting is some isps block ftp&lt;&lt; this is also not my case.
