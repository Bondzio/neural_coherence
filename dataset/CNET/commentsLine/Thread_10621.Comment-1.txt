i've had my pc for about a year and have used my poineer dvd-rw dvr-104 to create countless cd-rs, but now i want to create a data dvd.
a bought a couple dvd-rws but i can't figure out how to write on them.
i have downloaded 3 different programs (burnright!, burn4free, and click n' burn) but i can't get any of them to burn a dvd-rw for me.
some tell me to insert a blank cd, others try to burn, then say that they have finished with errors.
what am i doing wrong?
