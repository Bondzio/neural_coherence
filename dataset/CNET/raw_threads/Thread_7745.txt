However, now the computer simply could not detect it. Usually there would be the USB icon and autoplay on windows when I connect the hard drive, but now, nothing pops out. I have also tried to use the add hardward under the control panel icon in the start button, but the icon for the hard drive was not there. I have checked the hard drive for any obvious physical damage, but I think the hard drive works fine since I can hear it spinning inside. On the enclosure there are two LEDs; one marked as &quot;LED&quot; and another one as &quot;R/W&quot;. Usually during autoplay or when there hard drive is reading, the &quot;R/W&quot; lights would be flickering. But now, it doesn't. I am using windows XP The hard drive is a 120 gb Maxtor The enclosure is a ZDisk external storage from Cintre (model CI-330U2) My question is this: Is the hard drive or the enclosure is the problem since I can still hear and feel the hard drive is spinning but the &quot;R/W&quot; led on the enclosure is not flickering. If the enclosure is the problem, I can simply replace it. But if the hard drive is damaged, I would lose all my pictures Please help me. Thank you!

Why people don't install the updates is a mystery to me. If the files are important, before attempting any repair on the machine or drive, have a friend try the drive. Bob

Thanks for the idea. I was concerned about the LEDs on the enclosure. The &quot;R/W&quot; LED is not blinking and usually it does when the hard drive is reading or working or wat ever it is called. Is that a big problem? anasabmalek
