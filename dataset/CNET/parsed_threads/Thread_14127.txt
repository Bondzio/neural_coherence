<s> I realize that ATI does not yet have (to my knowledge) this exact capability, but does the GTX260/280 provide a substantial CUDA performance increase that would justify the higher price? </s>
<s> This is important for me, because I do a good bit of video transcoding which appears to benefit greatly from these applications that can take advantage of the GPU. </s>
<s> The video transcoders I use have never attempted to use the GPU. </s>
<s> Maybe you'll have to share a few names. </s>

<s> I read about it on AnandTech- it's a new product called BadaBOOM from Elemental Technologies. </s>
<s> The numbers they talk about seem to indicate pretty sizable performance gains in going with one of the new GTX cards over a 9800GTX, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any real-world data to add from experience. </s>

<s> I don't have any reason to encode h.264. </s>
<s> Here it's all HD or DVD standards. </s>

<s> Badaboom is some transcoding software nvidia is promoting because it takes advantage of CUDA.. dont know much about it though </s>
