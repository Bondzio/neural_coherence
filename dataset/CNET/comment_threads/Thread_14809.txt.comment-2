If you are sure your XP is SP2 and you have installed the latest BIOS version for that motherboard, then I would install a hard disk drive controller card in one of your PCI slots.
Under $20 in the USA.
...or just make TWO PARTITIONS on the 200GB drive with no one partition being larger than 137GB.
This solution is free.
