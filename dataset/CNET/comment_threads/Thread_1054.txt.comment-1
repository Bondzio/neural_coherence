Here's my problem: My internet connection keeps failing on me every 10mins.
I'm still connected to my network but I can't access any sites at all unless I right-click and use the 'Repair' function.
It started happening a couple of weeks ago and it's still happening even after I formatted my disk.
There are other computers connected to this network and all of them seem to work properly.
My laptop's connection is excellent when I use it on the same room and with the same wireless connection.
I already tried using Microsoft's FixIt but it's still the same.
Help, anyone?
This is getting very annoying.
