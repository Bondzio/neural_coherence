since there seems to be at least 2-3 posts a week about folks looking for a good mid range priced pc, i saw this deal in the compusa that looked good.
i don't spend tons of hours shopping around since i am only starting to look for possibly buying a pc (translation = i want one, wife says lets hold off for now...) but anyway:  for $649.99 hp pavilion amd athlon 64 3400 512 mb ram 200gb hd lightscribe double layer dvd +r/rw drive 2nd 16x dvd drive 17&quot; crt monitor plus $0.01 shipping (penny shipping) plus you get the following with any purchase $799 or over (which this is before the mail in rebates, so i think it counts) epson printer/scanner netgerar wireless g router norton system works &* anti spam mcafee internet security based on a lot of folks saying the emachine 6212 (athlon 64 3200, 512 mb, 160gb hd) $550 deal was good a few weeks ago, this seemed like it was at least in the ballpark of that since you get the 3400 and 200 gb hd instead.
note - if you order online you may not have to pay sales tax either, so that could be factored in.
or this is one you could pick up in a store as well.
i will say i do not know how &quot;upgradable&quot; the mobo is, but i think the site says it has two memory slots with one used ( not quite as flexible as 4 slots, but one is open i guess) and has agp video slot i think i don't know how good hp is (that statement ought to start a few comments alone...) but this might be a good one.
but anyway - good deal or not?
as i said, i am both passing this on to folks that are looking, as well as trying to get a sense for me if i do get teh green light to pull the trigger sooner or later.
