your system mfgs DOCs.
CPU-MB compatibility is BIOS driven so while it may have socket compatibility, you could have problems ranging from not working at all to working but not reflecting the right CPU specs.
If there two processor that appear to match the spec, I'd contact the system mfg to make sure which is correct for your system.
Good luck and let us know how it works.
