1.2.1	And it 's not a netbook and not a laptop .	St
1.2.2	You are showing what is known as a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT .	St

1.3.1	I am looking at this same model and as the previous poster pointed out I am in fact looking for a desktop replacement .	St
1.3.2	Much of the time this laptop will be docked to a 22 inch monitor , keyboard and mouse but I want the flexibility to pick up my office and take it with me and not sacrifice on performance .	St
1.3.3	That office needs to support a host of typical office products , heavy multi-tasking , as well as supporting CPU and intensive image and video editing .	St
1.3.4	For the price tag it better be an office on the go .	St
1.3.5	If like me you do intend to make this an office on the go you probably need to look into a storage network while docked , the paltry HD drives here are enough to keep the essential apps and travel data loaded but you will need to make alternate arrangements when docked .	St
