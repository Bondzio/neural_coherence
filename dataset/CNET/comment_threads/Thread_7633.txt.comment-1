I am trying to build a semi-budget computer, however I am not too sure on skimping on the computer RAM since I ran into computer problems with some inexpensive Spektek ram before.
What I am looking at is Kingston ValueRam, mainly cause of the good Kingston name.
However, the ValueRam name kinda keeps me wondering, was something vitally important cut out of the chips?
Were they defects that are still workable, but with flaws?
Why are they ValueRam vs. the Regular RAM they sell for a higher price?
Dont Want another computer problem that can occur after warranty/return date.
