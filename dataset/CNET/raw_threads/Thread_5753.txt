It has two Firewire plugs and one USB2. I'm very happy with it's functioning over the USB connector. My concern is, however, how can I protect this external data from access through connection to any other computer? I do not want to, also for time reasons, encrypt every byte that is stored on it. I have heard of little safety keys with some incorporated encryption on it, that has to be inserted in one of the plugs of the HDD. Searching on the net, I've not found what I was looking for, can somebody help? Thanks for your reply.

I've seen people encrypt their data into oblivion. Just for discussion, this feature is going to be on newer USB drives from what I hear from Maxtor and such external drive makers. For the D-I-Y crowd, you have a lot of options. Just be sure you don't create some BLACK HOLE which you put data into. Today's knowledge of BLACK HOLE is that nothing comes out. And what is coming out doesn't seem to be useful yet. I do know of an USB KEY for encrypting data, but an user lost theirs and along with it their data. They had no backup and the company that makes it tells them that &quot;that's how its supposed to work.&quot; If you could crack it and recover your data, then we would have to improve it. Got it?

Would there be a way locking the external HDD with a code for example, that information obviously stored on the latter, so any other computer could not connect to that HDD?

Until then D-I-Y solutions are what you can try. No standards here. I'm unsure of your skill or how long you've used a PC, but if you used WinZIP and an passworded ZIP file you could drop files on that. Remember it's not ultra secure if you pay for unlocking via www.lostpassword.com If you could write how far out you need to go, and if you are willing to lose the data if the key (soft or hard) is lost, then I'll get an idea where the security bar height needs to be set.

Hi Bob, I have no goverment secrets, so the security level does not have to be very high. It's more in case of theft, that I do not wish others to access my privat files. (I'm a photographer, I store mainly digital pictures and video files on it, that are rather large in filesize. That is why I do not wish to encrypt them, beacause it takes ages...) But I need to access them quickly, without any major time issue. I wouldn't mind a 'digital key' solution, usually you get 2 keys and I'm not afraid of loss. Something you would use like a pass through key with some password, that does not encrypt the whole file but just blocks its access. Thanks, Sidney

It matters not in the grand scheme if the whole file or block of access unless that's your &quot;specification&quot; in which case, we need to rewind this to the top and really grind through what products you know about and what I know about. Then see which fits your spec. An example USB key product is http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=THESAINT But you don't get two keys and if you buy a second key, it won't let you access the files. They and others don't offer data recovery services. You must be aware of the risks. Bob

It can only password protect folders (will not lock most System/Program files.) The only way to access secured folders is though Lock It Xpress. Lock It Xpress is simple to use, virtually uses no System Resources, only 8 Kb, and is available free at http://mvrao1.tripod.com/lock.html But if you foreget the password foreget your secured folders.
