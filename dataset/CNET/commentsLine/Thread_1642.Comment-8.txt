well i'm not a gamer but i play a few games like knight of the old republic which thi computer no longer allows me to use.
i need memory because i'm a frequent downloader, although i do take care of my computer.
i wouldn't mind a better-than-average video card but not somehing top of the line.
i'd also like at least 512-1 gig ram since that seems to be the standard now.
someone please help me in choosing a model.
i'll answer any other questions if you'll help me, i just don't know what to do.
