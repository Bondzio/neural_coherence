Check to see what type of USB connection you have in Device Manager.
In the Universal Serial Bus connection section, look for the Intel 82801 chipset.
If you have this chipset, you will have communication issues with the PS 3100.
There is a hardware conflict with this particular chipset and the PS 3100.
There are two possible solutions to this problem.
You may purchase a USB cardbus adapter card, install it and connect the drive through that USB connection and the drive will work fine.
The alternative would be to replace the drive with any other Maxtor drive model other than the PS 3100.
