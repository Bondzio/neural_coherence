1.1.1	I am thinking of building a new machine so naturally I am starting with the motherboard .	St
1.1.2	Right now I have an ASROCK board that works just fine although they tend to be the cheaper motherboards , so I am wondering if I can get better performance with another ( more expensive ) brand .	St
1.1.3	And if so , what are good brands in motherboards ?	Ques
1.1.4	I am also a big fan of ATI graphics cards but have noticed may new motherboards come with NVIDIA chip sets .	St
1.1.5	Are these chip sets compatible with an ATI graphics cards ?	Ques
1.1.6	Are they good chip sets or are there other chip sets I should look into ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks For All Your Help , Eric	St

1.4.1	I am thinking I will use an AMD Athlon 64 3200+ or higher .	St
1.5.1	generally considered to be better than the VIA 's , not so for the nForce 2 or 3 's [ nothing wrong with them , but no advantage over the Via 's ] .	St
1.5.2	There are 3 versions of nForce 4 's and certainly they are totaly compatible with with ATI video cards , unless you go with the PCI X16 video and also want SLI , then the latest ATI & quot ; SLI & quot ; thing may have problems .	St
1.5.3	I doubt if you want to spend in that class of video .	St
