i have put another hard drive in replace of the failed unit.
i mentioned it before(in article 3).i have replaced my machine with a new hdd.
a new one.
re-installed everything, from the os, firewall, application, programs etc etc.
what i am missing now is my data that is in the failed hdd.
i have actually went to the manufacture website( and downloaded an utility called powermax and runs a diagnostic on my failed hdd.
the result is from the utility is &quot;hdd is failing.
pls backup all nescessary data&quot;.
