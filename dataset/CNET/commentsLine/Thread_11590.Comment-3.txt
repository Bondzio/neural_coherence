i'm in high school right now, and my classes are still crammed together, making a 7 hour school day.
there's my 8 hour requirement.
after school, i'm free to move about and find a power outlet.
next year, i'll be in college and have charge time between classes.
i might start saving now and sell this tablet hybrid after a year to move up to a core i hybrid with less battery and more performance.
i've done my research on digitizer pens and palm rejection and how it works.
last year, i was all pen and paper.
i'm very interested in writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus.
i'll be adjusting to the glassy surface and need the touchscreen to have the necessary support for active digitizers for good palm rejection to work and for enough accuracy for handwriting.
