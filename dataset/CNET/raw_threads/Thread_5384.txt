I am looking at getting a widescreen hdtv with a native resolution of 1386x788... will my video card support that resolution? I haven't been able to find any info that will tell me if it will support any widescreen resolutions. Thanks

But, it should support a lesser value at max.(mine) of 1280X1024. There are various vendors using the FX5200 series chipset but it should be very similar outputs. In short its not a good marriage but *may* work as to what you HDTV range will allow. enjoy -----Willy

So great hooked up to my pc!!! The only problem is, it turns out the tv doesn't accept high resolutions from the pc. In fact for now I'm stuck using S-Video to get a half-decent 1024x728 resolution, the HDMI cable only allowed 640x400 or 640x480. but I have the tv set on wide-zoom mode which stretches the picture a little, but still looks great. Gotta look more into software to beef of my HDMI resolutions.

In case anyone has similar questions, I ended up not using powerstrip at all. Turns out the updated drivers to the geforce 5200, which I had previously ignored due to s-video problems, made the pc to tv hookup with an hdmi to dvi cable easy as 1, 2, 3.
