on booting up my computer today the internet refused to work, i tried all the normal procedures and on repairing the connections it comes up with the error: cannot clear dns cache.
i write to you from the gateway pc which works fine.
have tried all normal fixes such as re-establishing network, system restore.
help please!
both pc's are using windows xp and have worked fine (mostly) for almost 2 years
