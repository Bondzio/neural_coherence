my 533mhz p3 (windows 98) has been freezing up intermittently ever since i had the processor cooling fans replaced (old ones were making noise).
i have taken it back to the shop twice, and they cannot duplicate the problem.
it works fine for them, and they say the processor is not overheating.
but when i get it back home, it locks up.
i've tried plugging it into a different electrical outlet, to no avail.
any ideas?
thanks.
