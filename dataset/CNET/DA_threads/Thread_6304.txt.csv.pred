1.2.1	here are the urls for the parts i 'll be buying .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Produ ... N82E16813123241 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Produ ... N82E16819104245 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Produ ... N82E16814145067 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Produ ... N82E16820141425	St
1.3.1	''As the title says , i 'm building a cheap , but usable computer . ''	St
1.3.2	You ca n't have a usable computer running Windows XP with only 256MB of RAM .	St
1.3.3	512MB is the bare minimum for Windows XP ; you 'll want 1GB if you 're going to be playing games .	St
1.3.4	Are you going to be playing ANY 3D games on this computer ?	Ques
1.3.5	If so , you 'll want to get a better video card ; the whole GeForce MX series sucked , and the FX5200 is the worst of them all .	St
1.3.6	Also , I do n't recommend that you go with the socket 754 platform ; it 's old , it does n't support dual-channel RAM , and most motherboards have only an AGP slot .	St
1.3.7	AMD has greatly dropped the prices of Athlon 64s ; you can pick up a socket 939 Athlon 64 3000+ ( this is the lowest model ) for only $ 66 .	St
1.3.8	I 'll post a parts list off of newegg ( along with URLs ) tomorrow morning ; it 's 11:45 here , and I 'm tired .	St
1.4.1	that would be great , thank you .	Polite
1.5.1	CPU : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819103537 Motherboard : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813131033 RAM : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16820227037 Video Card : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814121538 This all comes to a total of $ 217 without shipping .	St
1.5.2	I did n't include a power supply because I assumed your case has one already .	St
1.5.3	Am I correct in my assumption ?	Ques
1.6.1	you need a bigger case for the 'puter .	St
1.6.2	its not worth saving money on that .	St
1.6.3	airflow is very important and you need fans for the case .	St
1.6.4	the bigger ones have several fans installed .	St
1.6.5	also get a good power supply .	St
1.6.6	550w should be the minimum with today 's gear .	St
1.6.7	antec has lots of 'em and good ones .	St
1.7.1	''you need a bigger case for the 'puter . ''	St
1.7.2	He has a mid-tower case ; the only thing bigger is a full-tower case , and those are for servers .	St
1.7.3	''airflow is very important and you need fans for the case . ''	St
1.7.4	His case has an 80mm front fan , and a 120mm rear fan .	St
1.7.5	IMO , that 's good enough for a budget computer .	St
1.7.6	Here 's his case on newegg & quot ; also get a good power supply .	St
1.7.7	550w should be the minimum with today 's gear .	St
1.7.8	550W is way overkill for a budget computer .	St
1.7.9	That parts list that I posted will run fine on a good 350W PSU .	St
1.7.10	You only need 550W for a really high-end computer with multiple hard drives , video cards , etc .	St
1.8.1	yes , it already has a power supply .	Res
1.8.2	one problem that i can see is that it appears that my powersupply only supports a twenty power pin mother board .	St
1.8.3	the mother board you put down has 24. is that a problem ?	Ques
1.9.1	You can get a 20-24 pin adapter .	St
1.9.2	More importantly , what 's the brand and model of the PSU ?	Ques
1.9.3	What 's the total wattage and what 's the amperage on the 12V rail ?	Ques
1.10.1	these pages tell about the case specs , and the power supply specs .	St
1.10.2	http : //www.antec.com/specs/sl350_spe.html http : //www.antec.com/specs/solu_slk3700amb_spe.html # it 's good to know i can get an adapter for the 20 pin plug , that helps alot .	St
1.11.1	That power supply will work fine with the parts list ; the motherboard should come with a 20-24 pin adapter .	St
1.12.1	great , thank you very much for your help .	Polite
1.13.1	NIL	St
