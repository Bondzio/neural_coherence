1.1.1	Hi, I'm in the market for a HD enclosure.	St
1.1.2	I plan on buying the new 1 terabyte HD by Hitachi when it comes out this month.	St
1.1.3	But when I look for enclosures, a lot of them say that their maximum HD capacity is 500 GB, or 750 GB, etc.	St
1.1.4	Since all 3.5&quot; HD's are the same size physically, why is there a capacity for an enclosure?	St
1.1.5	Shouldn't it not matter?	St
1.1.6	Would a 1 TB HD work in an enclosure that says their max is 500 GB?	St
1.1.7	Thanks for the help	St
1.2.1	There are no 1TB drives to test in said enclosures so while it should work, no one has tested it hence this is why you read this.	St

1.3.1	http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/_eol/consstor/enclosures/ACS-300/ I've purchased several Adaptec external HDD enclosures and they have served me well.	St
1.3.2	They were the only mfg at the time that offered enclosures which clearly stated their enclosures handled HDDs greater than 300GBs.	St
1.3.3	Having used their SCSI HBAs....I knew I could depend on their products specs.	St
1.3.4	It appears Adaptec is discontinuing this line of products from their sales.	St
