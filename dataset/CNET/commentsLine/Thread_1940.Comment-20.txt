lexmark and any printer built like them should be banned for sale.
i was naive enough to trust a lexmark sales rep at best buy when he lied to my face telling me that the lexmark printer would not print crooked like the previous lexmark i had... it did.
someone here in los angeles was working on a class action lawsuit against lexmark because so many people had problems with the printers.
not sure what happened with that but at least i know that my issues weren't isolated.
the top three brands that i would stick to when purchasing printers are hp, epson and canon.
