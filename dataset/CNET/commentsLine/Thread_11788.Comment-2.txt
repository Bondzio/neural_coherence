open box from newegg, you take your chances and must be aware of correction based on your knowledge.
it could already be damaged when you received it or simply not having all the goodies that came in the box, like cd, or cables, etc.. if it fails after all is said and done, return it???
if possible.
as for connections, they are not a mystery.
if you have to force or somehow guess, then either you lack the proper connections due to an old psu or too old period.
wait, until the new psu comes, you may cause damage and become clueless or few options to recover.
yes, newer psu have various connections and some &quot;don't get used&quot; as they are for intel type or multiple similar connects like for video power.
you have to be sure.
when you get new psu, come back with results.
if no manual, get one form the mtrbd.
support website and d/l it for that model#.
