I currently have a dual-core with 1 GB of DDR2 RAM and 250GB HDD. I wanted to buy a new quad processor because I really dont need a computer that is really powerful but i came across this deal for a 6-core processor with 8GB DDR3 RAM and 1TB HDD for $350. To buy a new computer with a quad core would prolly be $500+ so is this deal good or does it just look good? My dual-core has lasted me 6 years so i just want kno if i get this 6-core it will last me a long time. Any suggestions would help. Thank you. here is the link to the deal: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1336880&amp;CatId=332&amp;SRCCODE=LINKSHARE&amp;cm_mmc_o=-ddCjC1bELltzywCjC-d2CjCdwwp&amp;AffiliateID=TnL5HPStwNw-4laL8kmmfAaYylVmAxIStw
