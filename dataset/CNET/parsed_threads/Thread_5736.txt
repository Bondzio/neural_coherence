<s> Hey all - I am setting up a new small office network and I want to make sure my design using Cisco routers is adequate for what I am wanting to do. </s>
<s> I will have a 27Mbps network connection, approx 20 users wired/wireless, 10 of which will be wired desktops/laptops, printers, the other 10 likely to connect via wireless. </s>
<s> I am not expecting excessive file transfers or large amounts of streaming however, I would like to only have to adjust my bandwidth and not the physical solution if that becomes a requirement. </s>
<s> My plan is to buy the Cisco EA4500 wireless router and the SE2800 8 port Gigabit Ethernet Switch. </s>
<s> Will this setup keep consistent performance across wireless and wired connections? </s>
<s> What can these handle in concurrent connections performing normal daily email and web browsing? </s>
<s> Is there a more recommended setup I should implement? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help! </s>
<s> I've yet to see ANY solution that kept consistent performance as there are variables such as make, model or the laptops or slight location differences let a laptop edge out others and look preferred. </s>
<s> To solve this might require a rack of gear to met out the packets at a set rate. </s>
<s> Sounds expensive. </s>
<s> The setup is sound, common, works but your question might mean there are other goals. </s>
<s> The number of open connections is rarely a factor of the router. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> TCP/IP. </s>
<s> I can't duplicate this as it's pretty well documented on the net. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> My concern around performance was specifically focused on the fluctuation of users in and out. </s>
<s> If I add 10 users on to this network with the existing 10 already connected I wanted to make sure the performance didn't take a dive for all. </s>
<s> I understand this is dependent on how the bandwidth will be used. </s>
<s> This is a normal office, email and web browsing. </s>
<s> in your opinion, is the setup I have planned a good setup for this use? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> That's how such a system works. </s>
<s> If you want to look into some bandwidth shaping router, there is such but I don't prefer the bald look. </s>
<s> You have a fine plan. </s>
<s> While I'd re-jigger it later with maybe a second access point if needed, I'd go with this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
