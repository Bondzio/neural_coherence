1.1.1	One of my hard drives is failing - diagnostic tests came up with message error code 7 .	St
1.1.2	It 's Dell and the warranty expired last month ( why am I not surprised ) .	St
1.1.3	Anyway , I 've got two hard drives and one is working properly .	St
1.1.4	My question is , can I separate the two and reinstall windows on just the one working disk ?	Ques
1.1.5	I do n't want to spend money on a new disk plus the fee for the technician to come install it ( this is the second time a disk has failed ) for this computer and I do n't really want to buy a new computer yet .	St
1.1.6	I 'd prefer not to have to open the case and manually removing the offending disk as I 'm not very tech savvy at all and may do more damage but if that 's the only way ... Or can anyone suggest something else ?	Ques
1.1.7	Funny thing is , the failing disk is seated in the same position as the one that failed before .	St
1.2.1	But , unfortunately , it 's still best to disconnect the other drive and not let Windows see it .	St
1.2.2	You 'll need to open the case and remove the power and data cables .	St
1.2.3	Save what you can to an external if you have one .	St
1.2.4	The reason you do n't want the dying on in there with a fresh installation is that Windows will still be accessing it and probably begin complaining about read errors and such .	St
1.3.1	Thank you .	St
1.3.2	Any idea how I can do that ?	Ques
1.3.3	I 've got a Dell dimension 9150 and I opened up the case last night .	St
1.3.4	There are two disks sitting side by side .	St
1.3.5	How can I tell which is the faulty one ?	Ques
1.4.1	You did n't go much into detail about your 2 disk system .	St
1.4.2	If it 's not a RAID array , one will have the operating system and the other will be for storage .	St
1.4.3	Each will have a drive letter but , unfortunately , that does n't locate the physical drive .	St
1.4.4	If they are not the same capacity , you can use Windows to display the drive 's properties and then look at the labels on the drives to determine which is which .	St
1.4.5	Of course you 'd have to open it .	St
1.4.6	I 've only opened a couple of old Dells and it can be a pain to figure out how to get into the darned things .	St
1.4.7	Now , if the disks are the same size , just unplug power to one of them .	St
1.4.8	If the machine boots , the unplugged drive is the secondary one .	St
1.4.9	If your diagnostics disk is bootable , I 'd just run the utility with one drive attached at a time .	St
1.4.10	If you 're lucky , your Windows disk is OK and the secondary is giving the errors .	St
1.4.11	Chances are 50-50 with either .	St
