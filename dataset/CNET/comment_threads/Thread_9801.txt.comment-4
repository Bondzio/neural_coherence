I ended up piggy-baking the company drive onto one of my drives.
Not my first choice but data-integrity was vital in this case.
That company drive has been backed up to a fare-thee-well now.
LOL However, if anyone else should have this problem, you can reinstall Xp as a repair install and it will update the proper drivers to the new Pc the harddrive is in.
You will need your CD Key.
Activation is another story, but Microsoft is pretty decent about most diasters.
