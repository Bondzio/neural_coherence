I've had a HP desktop since Jan of 2002 and it still runs pretty good, granted I've re-formatted it about 4 times due to viruses and such. But I just re-formatted it for the 4th time 2 days ago and and it runs just as fast as when I took it out of the box the day I bought it. HP is very reputable and so is Sony BUT.... if you're going to invest that much money into something, you should get the later technology (i.e. core 2 quad) and not core 2 duo. you don't want to be too far behind in technology come 2 or 3 years from now and core 2 duo has already been around for some time. you should expect your computer to give you a good 5 years. I've had my HP for 6.5 years now
