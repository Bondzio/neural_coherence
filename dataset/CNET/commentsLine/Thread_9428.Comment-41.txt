2 years ago i looked for a pc.......understanding the rapid change i made sure i had a big tower and plenty of room for expansion.
too this i have only added 1g of ram and a new dvd drive duallayer compatible.......thats it!
as far as microsoft vista.....i work in the field and have the privilege of using it and giving feedback to improve.........dont expect much more than xp with more media friendly interface.......and still mucho security holes......norton 2006nis seems to be the best security for it of the 7 protection programs tested and hit with with known and unknown viruses,worms,trojans.
linux is still my choice for os, but windows is almost a must due to compatability issues.
