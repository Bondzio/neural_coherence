<s> I recently bought a used computer at a yard sale. </s>
<s> It came with a hard drive by &quot;Conner Technology&quot;. </s>
<s> The drive has problems, so I was going to look at their website to see the conditions of any warranties. </s>
<s> The drive says that the website is http://www.connertech.com , but as you can see, it's just an advertisement site. </s>
<s> Has another company acquired Conner, or did they just go out of business? </s>
<s> From memory, well over 10 years ago. </s>
<s> And from memory Conner was picked up by Seagate. </s>
<s> But I could be wrong. </s>
<s> Unless you need data off the drive, let's be honest here and write that such drives are fine door stops. </s>

<s> If it's important, here are some specs: Model: CT210 Size: 10.2 GB Interface: E-IDE Power: 5/12 V, 750/250 mA </s>
<s> 36 inches wide. </s>
<s> 68 inches high, 1 3/4 thick and wieghed about 50 pounds. </s>
<s> Your drive should work just fine for it's new purpose. </s>
<s> Read http://www.resellerratings.com/forum/t59085.html This is a very old drive, no warranty and is a great device to look at. </s>

<s> did not play well with any other mfr's drives. </s>
<s> this is a computer with a 633 MHz CPU, 256 MB Ram, a 4X CD-RW Drive, and a 14X CD-ROM. </s>
<s> I'm seriously considering scrapping this computer and trying to salvage anything useful (not much! </s>
<s> ), but I actually didn't buy it, it was given to me for free, and I know why. </s>
<s> I can, however, use the hard drive, which will be the most useful part of the whole computer! </s>
<s> as for the conner drive, here's my suggestions. </s>
<s> 1) disassemble it... HDs are really cool devices their innards make really interesting paperweights/conversation pieces. </s>
<s> 2) get Sunday's circulars and find a nice new HD for your main PC. </s>
<s> $60 should get you 160GB or more. </s>
<s> 3) put the old drive from your main PC in your hobby PC and start tinkering with stuff you'd never do with your main PC. </s>
<s> install linux. </s>
<s> make a backup device. </s>
<s> make a firewall. </s>
<s> geek out! </s>
