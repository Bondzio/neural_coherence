Probably you can't do this without the cooperation of your IT-staff.
They will have to open ports on the firewall or install vpn-software or whatever security measures they think necessary.
So let them determine the software to be used also.
The best way, by the way, is to not use any local software.
If all your applications are webbased (like Gmail, Google docs and Salesforce.com) there's no difference at all between working here or working there.
Just log in from whereever you happen to be.
