Anyone have an idea of how or where to dispose of old printers with problems, fried cordless phones due to surge after power outage, hard drives, etc? Did google search &quot;Recycling Electronic Equipment&quot; for my state, but not really satisfied with results. HELP and thanks in advance.

In my city, once a year a big truck shows up to take monitors, printers and other gear like that. Disposal is not free. About 5 bucks for a monitor, less for other things. Bob

You might try a place computer shop that specializes in used and trade in stuff. These places do such things as strip cases and sell parts or even the cases themselves. There is a lot of stuff they cannot use but can sell to reclaimation outfits and stuff so they even make a little money from that. I do some volunteer work at a school where my wife is the technology coodinator and computer teacher. I have taken some of her old stuff there including a few monitors and they haven't charged a dime yet.
