It has one primary partition and the fat 32 file system. The machine will boot to the c drive, but will not recognize the dvd drive. I get an invalid drive spec message. I need that drive to install windows from the cd. When I boot from the hard drive, I get a message asking whether I want to boot from the HD or the DVD. Is there something else I need to do to get the machine to recognize the DVD?

The first machine had a problem recognizing the hard drive. This machine will not recognize the dvd drive. When I boot to the hard drive and try to switch to the dvd, I get an invalid drive spec message.
