<s> So I have a 120gb phantom drive external hard drive that I have been using with my iBook G4 for three years. </s>
<s> I has worked great over the years and I have lots of data on the drive. </s>
<s> Recently my drive isn't being recognized by my computer. </s>
<s> The lights turns on on the hd and you can hear the disk spinning, but it doesn't pop up on the desktop like normal. </s>
<s> I have tried switching the cable I am using but to no luck have I been able to get it working. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Do you have another external case you could put the drive into. </s>
<s> That would help to eliminate the Firewire/USB interface board in the original enclosure. </s>
