HELLO, Recently I upgraded the RAM to 2GB.
I have Intel Mother B. model: D102GGC2.
I'm using WIN XP HOME SP2.
When I changed the RAM to the new one, the windows immediately recognized it and at the control panel/system its shows OK.
But, when I'm using the computer like I did in the past, I don't see any changes (not with speed and not with functionality).
Do you have any suggestions for me ?
Please send and answer.
Thank you very much, & Regards, SARA
