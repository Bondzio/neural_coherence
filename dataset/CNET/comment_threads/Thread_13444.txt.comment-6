Owned it for about a month now.
Absolutely delighted!
Primary uses are looking at Email and the Web while watching TV.
Battery lasts for 5 days with moderate usage.
Discovered several additional uses that I had never intended, such as using it as a GPS Navigator in the car!
Still experimenting with additional Android tablet apps.
Much more useful than I had originally thought, and way cheaper than the iPad that I originally looked at.
Love the full-size ports and the ability to easily replace the battery myself if and when it becomes necessary.
