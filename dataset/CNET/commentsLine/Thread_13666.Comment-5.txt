we are a small automation company (4 people).
if i crack this we can implement the concept more broadly on our systems.
bridging seems like a route to take but when i do this it my wireless indicates it is connected, but is unable to connect(to the other network computers and the internet).
is this an ip addressing issue of the bridge that i have now created?
