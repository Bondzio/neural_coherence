So here's the story: My Actiontec GT704WG router has been getting worse by the day; Dropped connections, incompatibility with some wireless devices...it's just become a pain to have to constantly &quot;powercycle&quot; the thing everytime. In addition, I was paying a $2.95/month rental fee just to use it! After researching some reviews, I bought a Linksys WRT54GL router off Amazon, and it just arrived this afternoon. While setting up, I encountered a problem: My old Actiontec didn't ask for or need a modem. I was able to connect a phone line between the phone jack and the router, and an Ethernet cable between the router and my PC. That's all it took for me to get an Internet connection for my PC and a wireless connection for my laptop. With the Linksys WRT54GL however, this set up is not working. After some research, it appears the Actiontec actually has a built-in modem! I've never had to use one, and up until now I assumed whatever this &quot;modem&quot; thing was came built-in to my computer. My internet company (TDS) is expecting their router back within 10 days, but until I get the Linksys set up, I'll have to keep the Actiontec around a bit longer. After 10 days, it's a $39.95 fee! Could someone give me a little crash course in just what a modem is, whether or not I need one, which one would be best for my router, and any other relevant information I might need to know? Thanks to all for any assistance you can provide.

And I see them given away freely on freecycle.com If you have to buy one I can't tell what area you are in, but 39.99 would be at the low end of what a new DSL modem would cost. As to &quot;best&quot;, gear supplied and supported by your ISP would be best. Bob
