1.1.1	I have 2 desktops and a Inspiron 8200 on my network.	St
1.1.2	The desktops are connected via a NIC and the Inspiron via Belkin Pre-N card.	St
1.1.3	A Belkin Pre-N Router connects them all.	St
1.1.4	It seems I'm having trouble with the Inspiron's wireless connection.	St
1.1.5	I have internet access, I can print to other printers on the desktops, and I setup Quickbooks to access the file on a desktop.	St
1.1.6	However the Inspiron can't see the desktops in Workgroup Computers, can't access the shared files that show up in My Network and it doesn't show up in the desktops Workgroup Computers.	St
1.1.7	The desktops can't print to the Inspiron's printer.	St
1.1.8	All this happens with all firewalls disabled.	St
1.1.9	How can I get full access with all the computers?	St
1.1.10	Win XP Thank you.	St
1.2.1	and see if both have same workgroup name and turn on files and printer sharing.	St
1.2.2	Try also to disable the firewall.	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your suggestion.	Polite
1.3.2	All have the same workgroup and have file/printer sharing installed.	St
1.3.3	Not only did I disable the firewall, I uninstalled Trend Micro PC-Cillin (you should uninstall any 3rd party software, not just disable it as I was told) on all the computers and rebooted them.	St
1.3.4	Now all 3 computers are visible in Workgroup Computers on all computers, however the Wireless XP Home Dell only shows the Dell's shared folders.	St
1.3.5	The XP Pro Shuttle and the XP Home Gateway (hard wired NIC's) shows each others shared folders but not the Dell's.	St
1.3.6	Getting closer...	St
