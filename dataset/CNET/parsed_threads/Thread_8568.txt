<s> I have a Creative SB Live! </s>
<s> card in my PC (PIII 500 MHz, 256 MB RAM, Win98SE). </s>
<s> I recently installed a CDRW in addition to my DVD-ROM drive so I could burn both data and music discs. </s>
<s> Yesterday I discovered that only one drive will actually play a music CD when I insert it. </s>
<s> Windows Media Player recognizes both drives, but I only get actual audio from the DVD. </s>
<s> I opened up my case, and there seem to be three idential ports on my sound card to which the audio cable of the drives can go. </s>
<s> I have mix-&-matched cables and ports, and only one of them seems to accept audio input. </s>
<s> Is this a normal function, or are my ther ports fragged? </s>
<s> Is there a fix? </s>
<s> Can I still burn audio CDs in this state? </s>
<s> HELP! </s>
<s> The controls called the MIXER seem to elude many. </s>
<s> A graphic of one is at http://guitarfxsoftware.com/sblive/ The issue for many is they can't find such a mixer to push the amplitude of what input is required or forget to not disable that input. </s>
<s> If you don't figure it out, just select which drive you want to play analog audio from and use that. </s>
