<s> I just finished building my pc and everything works; power switch, fans, LEDs, you name it. </s>
<s> I connected the monitor to the graphics card using HDMI to DVI respectively, and I get no signal on the monitor. </s>
<s> The CPU LED is also constantly on red. </s>
<s> I'm 100% certain the CPU is put in right. </s>
<s> It is an AMD Phenom II X4 3.4ghz. </s>
<s> Is the BIOS on the motherboard compatible with the cpu? </s>
<s> Do I need a new motherboard? </s>
<s> The motherboard and cpu are both socket AM3+. </s>
<s> I'm also using an SSD, which I know is working because of the LED inside. </s>
<s> I tried it on a different monitor as well, using DVI to DVI. </s>
<s> I can't tell but it sounds like you put it all together rather than using the bare minimum parts to get a beep or a display. </s>
<s> Start smaller. </s>
<s> If no display, remove parts to get just a beep. </s>
<s> LED's mean nothing. </s>
<s> You learn this after a few rounds. </s>
<s> I have the motherboard, processors, power supply, memory, ssd, optical drive, and graphics card installed in the case. </s>
<s> What should I remove? </s>
<s> But I guess it was unclear. </s>
<s> We start as small as possible. </s>
<s> All I need is 4 parts to get a beep. </s>
<s> PSU, CPU+HSF and the Speaker. </s>
<s> No beeps and I'm looking at the bad or badly configured parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> And what does the beep signify? </s>
<s> It's a shame you didn't reveal the test result. </s>
<s> If we move this slowly I may have to write to take it to a shop. </s>
<s> Love to help you along, but let's move a little faster. </s>
