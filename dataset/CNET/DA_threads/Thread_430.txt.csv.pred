1.5.1	Ray : Try some WD-40 on the micro switches just inside the flip door .	St
1.5.2	the one on the right looking in is the write protect , and the one on the left is the media sensor switch .	St
1.5.3	What i have found in many cases is that those switches get gummy from the atmosphere and do not actuate properly when you insert a floppy , particularly , the media sensor .	St
1.5.4	If this stays down in a stuck position , the drive thinks it has a 720 disk , but your command has told it that it was a 1.44 , therefore you may get a message & quot ; can not read , disk not formatted etc. & quot ; A little WD-40 on the finger nubs with working a disk in and out frees up these switches , and often puts the drive back in service .	St
1.5.5	Its worth a try , I fixed one this past weekend for a friend .	St

1.6.1	Also check the mother board floppy plug slot to see if a pin is bent down against another pin , sometimes these slots are not indexed ( missing a pin ) and some one uses a indexed cable ( blank space on the cable connector ) bending the pin down while forcing the cable in the slot .	Sug

1.7.1	This idiot was building a new computer and setting up the old one for another user .	St
1.7.2	The old one was using an LS120 [ IDE ] drive as the floppy .	St
1.7.3	This was needed for the new computer which had the old hard drive with Quickbooks on it .	St
1.7.4	Used it to back up Quickbooks .	St
1.7.5	Now two years ago , this same idiot disabled the Floppy controller because at that time the system did n't have a floppy drive .	St
1.7.6	Guess what happened when i enabled the floppy controller in the BIOS .	St
1.7.7	Now I have an ISA controller that can handle a bunch of floppies .	St
1.7.8	Anyone need it ?	Ques
