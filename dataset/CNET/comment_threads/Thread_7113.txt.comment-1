My computer doesn't currently have a DVD drive and I am going to purchase one.
Can someone please tell me how to find out whether I need an IDE one or a SATA one?
Thanks.
Also, without taking apart my PC, can someone please tell me how I can find out whether I need a PCI-E graphics card or an NGP graphics card?
Thanks.
My computer is a Dell Precision 350 if that helps..
