1.2.1	Just me sharing that I 'm leaning to a DVD/CDRW in the laptop and an USB 2.0 or Firewire DVD all format dual layer recorder .	St
1.2.2	Here 's why .	St
1.2.3	First I have n't seen a dual layer recorder in the laptops yet .	St
1.2.4	Most are all of 2X speed and if you 've done any DVD recording , you may find this much too slow .	St
1.2.5	The heat I see coming out of the 4X recorder I have would make me nervous to have in a laptop .	St
1.2.6	Besides , if the recorder fails , the external is cheap to fix .	St
