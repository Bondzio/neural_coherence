<s> Upgraded my motherboard, processor and RAM about a week back. </s>
<s> After installing the hardware, initially everything ran ok on a freshly installed windows XP. </s>
<s> But as I started using the PC, updating windows etc, noticed a slight flickering of the screen on the right side. </s>
<s> This is limited only to about 1/3rd part of the screen on the right side. </s>
<s> The rest of the screen has no flicker. </s>
<s> Sometime it gets worse to the point that the right side becomes completely distorted with vertical lines and bars. </s>
<s> The side screen flicker also appears during boot start up screen (where one has the option to press Del to enter setup), and in bios, safe mode too. </s>
<s> Some things I have tried till now.. 1) Uninstalled XP, formatted and installed Windows 7 ultimate SP1 & updated Windows 7. </s>
<s> 2) Updated drivers for motherboard & monitor from these links, they seems latest. </s>

<s> 4) Connected my old CRT Samsung monitor, it shows no flicker.. </s>
<s> LED monitor was working fine for months, the motherboard, CPU & RAM were assembled in the shop and packed up. </s>
<s> Only thing I did was unplug the LED monitor, installed the new motherboard in the cabinet and plugged it back in.. Only issue I can remember is first time after the fresh XP install, I installed the drivers for motherboard from the manufacturer's disk provided. </s>
<s> Then I installed drivers and Magictune utility from the Samsung CD. </s>
<s> After installing Magictune, the PC started restarting again and again until I went into safe mode and uninstalled Magictune. </s>
<s> Could this have started the flickering.. </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>

<s> Since the only test is to try another monitor on this PC and this monitor on another PC, after I do that I know if I have to call Samsung for repair. </s>
