1.1.1	I just purchased this set up from best buy under the advice of some of the staff and the only problem i can't figure out is where the powersource should connect to the new card.	St
1.1.2	There are a few options, but none seem the right size for the available slot.	St
1.1.3	I would be grateful for any assistance.	Polite
1.2.1	the nvidia card has 6 holes and the emachine has two 4 holes and another large plug w/ at least a dozen.	St
1.2.2	all are attached to the motherboard (a 4 is by itself and the other two are paired together in one big slot) the nvidia also came with an adapter to fit its 6 holes and the adapter splits into two, each one having three large prongs at the end, instead of holes.	St
1.3.1	those connectors are the type used by your cd/dvd drive.	St
1.3.2	look at the photos of this power supply: antec basiq 500w power supply cables and connectors emachines usually have very small (low wattage) power supplies that aren't intended for decent video cards.	St
1.3.3	that's why they don't have the 6pin pcie power connector those video cards require.	St
1.3.4	i suggest you get a good 450-500w power supply for your pc.	St
1.3.5	(such as the antec basiq).	St
