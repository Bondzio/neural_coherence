OK, so on nearly every computer ive ever seen, you can access the BIOS settings and info by pressing a certain key at startup (F2 or F8 or whatever)....but this HP doesnt present that option.
At start up the first screen i see is a blue one with the HP logo, which on other systems is the screen that comes after the option for BIOS.
any thoughts?
The system is close to 4 years old.
It originally had windows ME, (now xp pro).
I want to see my BIOS info to figure out if a hard drive upgrade is possible.
