<s> Hi i'm looking to upgrade my power supply in my sony pcv-R14G so i can upgrade the graphics card. </s>
<s> the problem that i have is finding a low profile power supply of minimum 400wts. </s>
<s> I think sony makes things difficult so you cant upgrade and have to buy a new computer.I tried circuitcity, best buy and compusa and they dont have low profile power supplies. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> I went there and tried the number you posted and got such number. </s>
<s> http://www.partstore.com/Default.aspx?mfn=Sony&s=google VAPCMD </s>
<s> mean Got NO such number??? </s>
<s> I couldn't get it to take that number. </s>
<s> match anything I could find at the Sony Parts site. </s>
<s> Makes it tough to help. </s>

<s> sorry thats the correct number now i forgot one letter PCV-RZ14G </s>
<s> $225...UGH ! </s>
<s> Believe this is the PSU part number '146870914' If it were mine ....I'd double check the SONY PSU part number, take measurements, see if it wired generically and look for a generic replacement. </s>
<s> $225 for a 400W PSU is absurd and a SONY GOTCHA ! </s>
<s> If you can't find an economical replacement ...may be better to use the money toward a newer PC. </s>

<s> I purchased from PC Power & Cooling..website..www.pcpowercooling.com/ I rebuilt my old DELL Dimension 2350..which was a P4[1.8GHz]at 200-watts..and placed a PC Power & Cooling 400-watt in the Tower..perfect fit..just over $$200.00/I now run a P4[531]3.0GHz..plus a new Mobo.. Video cards are for Advanced Users from what I have read.. and 600-watts seems to be the minimum on having the NEED for a Video Card.. .. Power Supply's come in Form Factor..plus you want to measure the one in your PC..the serious part is about useing a Power-On Button.. </s>
<s> Some PSU incorporate a Power-On Button..some DON'T/the latter would need the resource of your Front Panel Power Switch.. .. And you Do Not want to eliminate any LED's that inform of PC Operation.. .. </s>
<s> Check on Form Factor.. and the 2 x 10 or the 2 x 12 Configuration....for the MAIN Plug on the Mother Board.. </s>
<s> I saw little differance in upgradeing..except that extra wires are there.. ..there are some New Specs on Power Hook-up on the Board.. Research it..its not too difficult.. Start w/FORM FACTOR. </s>
<s> MicroATX supply.n Since most MicroATX mobos use onboard video and sound and share memory for video they have supplies as low as 145 Watts. </s>
<s> If you need 400 watts for the hardware, I wqould doubt that you could cool the system adequately in that small case. </s>
