i was currently in the market for 5.1 or higher system with the works, but now considering the space i have to work with and knowing that installing all those speakers is just goiing to cost much time, labor and $$$... i really don't want to but i just have to and, i have a few obstacles to deal with since the shelfs on my entertainment system are only 12&quot; in height.
now i really like the denon s301 mainly due to it's ease of use and having pretty much the works, hdmi, ipod hook-up, good dvd player, etc.
my only problem is that the speakers are 1&quot; to big.
bose 3.2.1 ?
...well from what i've researched and read on, they don't clearly have such a good rep. the speakers would fit great on the shelfs, but i jst can't get over that boxy dvd receiver.
all i really want is to keep it simple with really good sound and manageability.
1. receiver / dvd / ipod connection / tuner 2. subwoofer 3. front surround speakers any suggestions...
