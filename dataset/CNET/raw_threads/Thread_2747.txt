Hi I have just bought a Samsung Series 7 Ultra touch laptop (model:NP740U3E-S04UK). I want to upgrade the stupidly small capacity 128GB SSD to at least 240GB maybe 512GB. [Samsung only sell the 128GB SSD here in the UK because we are a 3rd world country and that's all we deserve. Whereas Germany gets not only a 256GB SSD but also an i7 rather than an i5 CPU, but don't get me started...] I phoned Samsung and they refused point blank to tell me what SSDs would fit and said I *had* to go through one of their Authorised Service Centres. &quot;Or lose the warranty.&quot; But this would cost &#163;90 just for them to look at it! I understand that my laptop uses mSATA. Can anyone tell me if any mSATA disk would work in fact? Is it hard to install? What would be the best mSATA SSD that money could buy? (in UK) Btw, should I worry about parts of the SSD wearing out and if so what action should I take? (e.g. partitioning the drive, having a v large drive etc) J

Here's how to tackle that.	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-ram-endurance,3475.html I'm curious why folk are buying into limited life span products. At least you know and will keep a few spare backups. Bob PS. As to the other items, too risky to answer. Samsung was pretty clear about this.

However according to the Samsung instructions ( http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201307/20130715120101546/Win8_Manual_eng.pdf0 it has a: &quot;7mmH SATA HDD SSD&quot; (which I assume specific type of mSATA, but surely it's not a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), it's just a Solid State Drive (SSD)... (!).

I think my NP740U3E-S04UK can take 10GB although I have seen 14 and even 16GB quoted. I always keep the data mirrored and archived, but I suppose it would be worth doing backups of the entire SSD using whatever Windows 8 provides.

With each Windows release I hope the backup and restore would be without issue but so far, without fail you find folk backing up but can't get the restore to work. Here I have a few new Windows 8 laptops and the factory restore fails. Fortunately Samsung didn't rely on Microsoft. Bob

Armed with that info, you should be to go on the WWW to get the dimensional info on the SSD allowing you to find a drive of choice that fits within the dimensional limitations. From there it's up to you. Re RAM...you need to check your system specs as you SHOULD use RAM in matched pair....2 SODIMMs at 4GB for 8GBs, 2 SODIMMS at 8GB for 16GBs and so on. When you mix capacities like an 8GB SODIMM and a 4GB SODIMM, you usually lose the benefit of systems dual channel (128bit) operation. Let us know how it turns out. VAPCMD
