<s> I am shopping for a socket AM2 MB and I wanted one with an AGP slot since I have a few AGP cards lying around. </s>
<s> My case is ATX. </s>
<s> I seem to only be finding MB's that meet my criteria in Micro ATX. </s>
<s> Anyone know of a MB full size ATX, socket AM2, with AGP slot? </s>
<s> Maybe there is no such animal and I will have to go PCI-E and sell AGP cards on ebay? </s>
<s> The AGP bridge reduces the AGP video speed to 1X or less. </s>
<s> Many discover this after the fact. </s>

<s> even if your old agp card is a quadro, you should really consider getting a pci-express based motherboad. </s>
<s> agp cards are typically more expensive than their pci-e counterparts and there are fewer choices (and those choices are only going to shrink). </s>
<s> if the card is more than 3 years old, you can probably get a faster pci-express card for less than $150. </s>
