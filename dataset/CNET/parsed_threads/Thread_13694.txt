<s> Hi there, I'm a complete novice when it comes to the area of computer hardware, so I'm incredibly confused right now. </s>
<s> We recently purchased a new computer and today, I took the hard drive from the old computer and installed it into the new one (which took way, way too long). </s>
<s> My old computer only had a Pentium something processor (basically.. really old & slow), 512MB of RAM and 120 GB of space. </s>
<s> The new computer has 3.5gb of RAM, 500 GB of space and a Quad 2 Core 2.4ghz processor (I think). </s>
<s> I wanted to make the OLD hdd the master drive, as it has all of my programs and settings and whatever on it. </s>
<s> So I installed it as such --- it's an IDE hdd so I plugged in the black cable to make it master. </s>
<s> However, once I turned on my computer, it went straight to the new hard drive. </s>
<s> My question is: how do I make my old hard drive the master? </s>
<s> I plugged it in correctly, and the computer does recognise it, but why is it not the main hdd? </s>
<s> Is there somewhere on the control panel where I can select which one I want to use..? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance! </s>
<s> it sounds as if you're trying to use &quot;cable select&quot;. </s>
<s> This will mean your old drive will need to have a jumper on it set to allow for this option and your new one needs to be set that way as well. </s>
<s> Now, if your old drive has XP on it and you try to attach it to new hardware, it's not going to boot up anyway. </s>
<s> It would require a repair installation, drivers for the new hardware and re-activation. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Shut down the computer. </s>
<s> Look in the motherboard manual on how to do this, as the computer starts up right at the beginning, press the appropriate key to get into the BIOS. </s>
<s> ESC, F1, F2, depending on your setup. </s>
<s> Change the first boot device to the drive you wish it to be. </s>
<s> A warning, however, Depending on what you really wish to do. </s>
<s> The computer probably will not boot from the old harddrive. </s>
<s> You do not say what OS you are using or what was on the old HDD, but what is your goal? </s>
<s> And then why does your old HDD need to be the master? </s>
<s> Unless you are sure you want this, you might wish to rethink what you are doing woth this new computer. </s>
<s> it won't work. </s>
<s> Since that old drive has XP from another machine on it, even if you get it to boot it still won't run. </s>
<s> You can't move a hard drive from one PC to another as master. </s>
<s> Something about piracy. </s>
<s> You are a novice, and I'll give you a step by step information. </s>
<s> * You must refer your motherboard manual 1) Change your old drives jumper configuration to Master(MA) or cable select(CS),don't make it as a slave(SL). </s>
<s> 2) Turn on the PC and go to setup. </s>
<s> There are no universal method to do this, So You better press ESC, F1, F2, DEL (IT MENTIONED IN YOUR MOTHERBOARD ). </s>
<s> 3) Go to drive configuration and change boot sequence to make this drive as the first boot device. </s>
<s> 4) Save and exit (F10). </s>
<s> 5) Everything is ok. </s>
<s> But your old HDD have a OS and Drivers installed to a old PC,it wont work unless you have a same chipsets on both machines. </s>
<s> So your PC require a repair OS installation. </s>
<s> Now you need OS and drive CDs. </s>
