perhaps this will make your choice a little clearer - i am in the exact same situation as you (though waiting for nehalem to come out) and bought the 3850 agp.
big mistake.
ati/amd does not offer driver support for these agp cards.
it took me about a week to get the card to work (i still have no sound b/c of some driver incompatibility).
if i were you i would save your money (and a giant migrane) and wait until next gen cpus come out.
if you really must upgrade, do yourself a favor and get a 7xxx nvidia card.
stay away from 3850 agp.
