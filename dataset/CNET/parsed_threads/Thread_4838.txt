<s> I bought my monitor 2 years ago and really liked it until about 2 weeks ago it started to black out. </s>
<s> I searched online to see if anyone else was experiencing a similar problem and was surprised to find so many people with the same problem. </s>
<s> I went to Hewlett Packard's website and sure enough my monitor met all the requirements to be replaced or fixed. </s>
<s> I called the HP Support number and was told that the extended warranty had expired September 30th,(I was 15 days too late) I find this totaly unfair! </s>
<s> I believe that Hewlett Packard should be responsible for replacing all f1703 monitors that black out regardless. </s>
<s> Mine didn't go bad until after the extended warranty expired, so how was I supposed to know about it. </s>
<s> I too won't be buying anything else from Hewlett Packard. </s>
<s> They obviously don't know how to fix their mistakes and make things right with customers. </s>
<s> Some found out how to fix theirs. </s>
<s> Seems easy once you know. </s>
