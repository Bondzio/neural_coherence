Be ready to wipe the machine and reload but stick with it. Some get a new motherboard or such until it works. On the game forums, others have HACKED the NVidia drivers to let you use them on laptops. But I offer only this information and nothing more. -&gt; To me, this is a warranty issue and possible bad hardware. Bob

Thank you Bob, I have done a lot of things acording with HP suport, from reparing and reinstalling the OS, last thing they suggested was to use an utility called active killdisk, I have downloaded but it wont work since is the free version and would only do a zero phase erasing, What would you suggest, do you think this will work, and is there another free utility that would do the same has killdisk??? I believe as you said that might be a problem with the grafic card it self, since eve while runing DOS I have the white dots on the screen. Thanks, Daniel.
