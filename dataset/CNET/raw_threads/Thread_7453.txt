Good day, I Have the following, eMachines T6524 AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2GHz / 1GB DDR / 200GB HDD / Dual Layer DVDRW/ Integrated ATI Radeon Xpress 200 / Flash Media Reader / Windows XP Media Center 2005. I have looked at the ATI web site and am confusied as to what would be the best next step up on the graphics card. I have 1 gig of memory and a 200 gig hard drive.. There seems to be many choices just not sure which one would be best. Thanks in advance for your reply

You'll have to pick an PCI Express card based on how far out you want to go. ATI has a dual GPU video card with 1 gigabyte of video RAM but that is on the extreme side of upgrades. Your choice is usually determined by a budget. Bob
