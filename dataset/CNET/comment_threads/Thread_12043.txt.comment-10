may have put ezdrive/ezbios on the drive when it wasn't needed.
Use the bootdisk that came with the harddrive, switch to the second/slave drive on the screen, and proceed to uninstall that program (you used to have to choose ezdrive/ezbios as if you were going to install the program before you saw the uninstall feature...not sure if that's how it is now).
Once you have that program uninstalled, remove the floppy disk, reboot the computer and get to the desktop from your Master drive.
Once there, open My Computer, right click the slave drive letter that shows up, and choose FORMAT from the menu choices.
That will format the drive for NTFS and get it ready for data.
