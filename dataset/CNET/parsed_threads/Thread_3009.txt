<s> Hey everyone, I have a bit of trouble here. </s>
<s> I just finished moving my hardware into a new case I am having a problem getting past POST. </s>
<s> Here are the specs: Motherboard: ABIT Fatality AN8 SLI Videocard: NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GTX Harddrive: Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 8 40GB ATA/133 2nd Harddrive: Seagate Momentus 5400.2 120GB SATA Soundcard: SIIG SoundWave 5.1 PCI RAM: OCZ EL DDR PC-3200 Dual Channel Platinum 1GB (two sticks) CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4800+ I also had two 120mm LED Silent case fans that were replaced by two new 120mm LED Silent case fans that came with the new case. </s>
<s> I also removed a CD Drive (but kept a DVD Drive) because there is not a necessity for it. </s>
<s> All of these parts with preexistent in a fully functional and working computer prior to moving them to a new case. </s>
<s> The motherboard is equipped with a visual LED/POST code device that reads ?25? </s>
<s> whenever I boot up my system. </s>
<s> The manual describes POST code 25 as: Early PCI Initialization -Enumerate PCI Bus Number -Assign memory & I/O resource -Search for a valid VGA device & VGA BIOS, and put it into C000:0 Sometimes it will code ?9.0.? </s>
<s> before 25. </s>
<s> The manual describe POST code 9.0. as: Complete uGuru initial process AWARD BIOS take over booting job I?m not using uGuru so this baffles me. </s>
<s> I?m not a hardware guy and I?m at the extent of my knowledge. </s>
<s> Obviously it?s a hardware issue however I?m fairly confident none of my hardware is damaged there for I must have connected something wrong, or made some type of mistake trying to boot it up after dismantling and rebuilding in a new case. </s>
<s> Any advice is welcome. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time. </s>
<s> Progress Update: -Cleared CMOS, No improvement still coding 25 - Tried a minimal boot using just the following components: Motherboard, CPU, Power Supply, Single stick of ram, Videocard and Keyboard. </s>
<s> Boot Successful. </s>
<s> -Tried to boot using all components except Hard drives Boot Successful. </s>
<s> -Tried to boot using all components except main hard drive. </s>
<s> Boot Successful. </s>
<s> -Tried to boot using all components. </s>
<s> Boot failed, coding 25. </s>
<s> Probable cause: Possible lose IDE cable. </s>
<s> Solution: Checking main board and hard drive. </s>
<s> Probable cause: Bad IDE cable. </s>
<s> Solution: Swapping IDE cables between the hard drive and the DVD drive. </s>
<s> Probable cause: Bad hard drive. </s>
<s> Solution: None available. </s>
<s> Do you have any other thoughts? </s>
<s> Any advice welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time. </s>
<s> While the old &quot;extra standoff short on the back side of the motherboard&quot; is now legendary, did you try setting up the machine on card board without a case for a test? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Progress Update: Switched IDE cables between hard drive and CD drive. </s>
<s> Insured IDE cable was firmly and securely plugged into component and main board. </s>
<s> -Tried to boot using all components except main hard drive. </s>
<s> Boot Successful. </s>
<s> IDE cable not bad. </s>
<s> -Tried to boot using all components. </s>
<s> Boot Successful. </s>
<s> Initial issue was probably related to the IDE cable not being fully plugged in. </s>
<s> Disk read error. </s>
<s> Rebooting system gave me POST code 9.0. </s>
<s> - Cleared CMOS and tried to boot using all components. </s>
<s> Boot Successful. </s>
<s> Disk read error. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I only have a USB keyboard that will not allow me to Ctrl+Alt+Del after the Disk read error. </s>
<s> I?ve solved the initial problem however, it seems as though I?ve come into another more major problem. </s>
<s> Bad hard drive, or just failed to read? </s>
<s> I don?t know how to tell the difference. </s>
<s> Bob ? </s>
<s> I didn?t set it up on cardboard and test it prior to putting it into its new case. </s>
<s> At this point in the trouble shooting should I continue to worry about my motherboard shorting out or have I eliminated that possibility? </s>
<s> I haven?t seen any warning signs of a short. </s>
<s> Well, I solved the problem, however BOOTMGR is missing. </s>
<s> I guess I should've expected something else to go wrong. </s>
<s> Now just to find that dang Windows CD... </s>
