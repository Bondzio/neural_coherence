even if your on a tight budget,you can purchase dedicated cards that are $50 bucks and under that will give you everything you need and more.also your stuck with a vga monitor connection on almost all integrated gpus.dvi or digital connection that is on almost all dedicated gpus is by far the way to go with all today's great picture quality options.remember you do not have to remove your intergrated setup to add a dedicated at any time,that's what i did and if my gpu ever breaks i still can go back to the on board graphics.
