Hi - I purchased all the components for my build from 3 retailers in the UK (scan.co.uk / overclockers.co.uk/ tekheads.co.uk) and yes I built the system myself - it was really very easy and there's a wealth of knowledge on the internet should you have problems - and it's cheaper than buying a pre-built system.
A good Windows laptop will be something like Alienware's Area 51-m15x - it's great for portability and has plenty of oomph to play some decent games - If you don't want to buy from Alienware, try MSI or Novatech etc.
- you should find something similar.
