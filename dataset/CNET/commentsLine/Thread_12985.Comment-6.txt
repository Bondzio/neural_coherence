it doesn't seem that the memory cards/flash drives will replace the hard drive any time soon because of the limited write life span.
but as far as capacity goes, it may be issue now, but i know it won't be long before technology brews up storage cards that do catch-up to the triple-digit gigs of hard drives.
granted that today's hard drives are very reliable, i still believe that the more moving parts there are, the more likelyhood of mechanical failure.
so i am hoping that one day that high capcity storage would be moving towards flash drives/memory cards, where there is nothing mechnical about it.
so do you guys think that the hard drive would ever be replaced by something else?
or it is going to be around for a loooong time--say the next 10 years?
your thoughts?
