<s> I previously posted on my inability to boot to Win 7 with Nexxtech 03A10 7-port usb 2.0 hub connected. </s>
<s> It appears there is a basic problem with the mob of this Pavilion computer. </s>
<s> I found some info indicating this device was only compatible with Win XP; the vendor failed to tell me this, I had assumed he would. </s>
<s> Maybe he didn't know either. </s>
<s> So I acknowledge I must purchase a new usb hub. </s>
<s> But how do I ensure my next hub purchase is compatible with my HP Pavilion desktop? </s>
<s> There is no mention of os's on the websites, only PC and/or Mac. </s>
<s> I cannot afford to waste more money on dubious computer peripherals. </s>
<s> Any input as to what (brands) to look for would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I've lost track of front USB ports that fail in too many ways. </s>
<s> So try it one more time but on an rear USB 2.0 port. </s>

<s> Belkin 4-Port USB Ultra-Mini Travel Hub will solve your problem and it is compatible with Windows 7 </s>
<s> It's one of my really old desktops with the incorrect USB wiring and only a few things work on the front ports (mouse for example.) </s>
<s> Use the rear port and it's good. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have this Nexxtech 7-port hub connected to a rear usb 2.0 port, to no avail. </s>
<s> The fact that it will not boot to windows, but works when connected after boot up suggests that incompatability is the issue here. </s>
<s> Am searching for usb 2.0 hub by better manufacturer. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Today these are fungible and in over a decade no driver hunts here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What you say makes much sense. </s>
<s> I may just have a Nexxtech lemon here (not meant to disparage this company). </s>
<s> The front USB's work for other peripherals e.g. </s>
<s> b/u drive. </s>
<s> I prefer an AC powered hub to cover any power hungry devices in the future. </s>
<s> I am still perplexed that other than preventing booting to Win 7, it works normally. </s>
<s> As an aside, the green sound output jack on the rear panel has suddenly stopped functioning. </s>
<s> In fact, have speakers connected to a front jack. </s>
<s> Another reason to get the old dell 5150 functioning as a backup computer. </s>
<s> I am now starting a special savings account for the purchase of my next new desktop, as it seems this Pavilion may be entering the croak phase. </s>
<s> Thanx again for your input. </s>
<s> My last HP (literally!) </s>
<s> would not boot to Windows when many things were in the USB port. </s>
<s> A bit of research tracked it down to a flaw in the BIOS HP sourced for this model. </s>
<s> The name was &quot;InSyde&quot; and HP made it clear they had no means to correct the flaw. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that it was not a flaw in the handful of smart phones, usb drives and hubs in this case. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanx for your input. </s>
<s> Refusal to correct a design error seems rampant in the home computer business. </s>
<s> But people put up with it. </s>
<s> I will consign this nexxtag hub to use with my Win XP computer, if I can get to work in this brave new world. </s>
<s> Meanwhile I think a Belkin product would likely be the best choice, although they never compatibility wiyh Win 7 OS. </s>
<s> Thank you all for your input. </s>
<s> &quot;Let the buyer beware&quot; </s>
