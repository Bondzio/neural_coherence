<s> I downloaded the trial version of TI 9.0. </s>
<s> I can't seem to get correct incremental or differential backups. </s>
<s> I'll do a full backup of a drive or files, make a minor change, go back and back up the same files or drive. </s>
<s> I have to choose the original full backup file first (or I get an error) and then choose incremental or differential. </s>
<s> But all the files get backed up again, not just the ones that have changed. </s>
<s> Anyone seen or heard of this? </s>
<s> Pretty weird. </s>
<s> Chris Dell 8400 Dimension XP PRo 1 gig RAM 3.2 GHz </s>
<s> Acronis...see what they have to say. </s>
<s> I bought the product too but to date have only used it to create and restore full partition images. </s>
<s> My prefernce for the moment is still Ghost 2003 because I have used it with great success for years. </s>
<s> Very simple and fast. </s>
<s> But again I only use it to create and restore full partitions (or full drives if the situation warrants). </s>
<s> Must admit it would be nice to do (automatic) incrementals too which is what Acronis is supposed to do as well. </s>
<s> The trick is to be able to use this and if the sh*t hits the fan....you can boot up of a floppy or CD and restore you latest image (and updates if any) back to the partitions simply and easily. </s>
<s> The trick is to put thm on a second internal hard drive where it out of the way and backup-restores are fast and easy. </s>
<s> Wouldn;t be without it nyself. </s>
