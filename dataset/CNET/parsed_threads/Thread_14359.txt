<s> I want to give an adult family member a tablet for Christmas. </s>
<s> He has learning disabilities and is not a PC user and is truly a computer newbie. </s>
<s> With my help I envision him using the tablet to watch movies via Netflix and other sources; watch TV shows via websites (e.g., NBC); do simple Web surfing (e.g., check the weather and his bank balance); and check a Gmail account. </s>
<s> GPS would be nice but is not mandatory. </s>
<s> A 9 - 10 inch screen would be best for him. </s>
<s> Higher battery power (but not necessarily the highest) would be best. </s>
<s> He doesn't read well so we don't need book-reading capability. </s>
<s> I have the impression that watching live TV, such as a football game, is not yet readily available or cheap. </s>
<s> He doesn't use apps, although there might be one or two that interest him. </s>
<s> He does have an iPod; I download the music for him. </s>
<s> He would use this tablet at home and while we travel. </s>
<s> I'd like to keep connectivity fees as low as possible. </s>
<s> At home we have Verizon FIOS for Internet, TV and cell phones (not for our &quot;regular phone,&quot; which is a landline on copper). </s>
<s> One thing I don't understand about tablets is whether getting one with Wifi means we can connect in a hotel room or coffee shop without extra fees (unless either or those charges a fee). </s>
<s> I understand a data plan is not recommended. </s>
<s> Do we need 3G or 4G for the usage I describe? </s>
<s> I would appreciate any recommendations. </s>
<s> So far it appears that the iPad and Samsun Galaxy are the way to go. </s>
<s> Thank in advance. </s>
<s> Next week I'll have the 7 on hand so I can check new questions about NBC that I didn't try at the trade show. </s>

<s> As I explored options this past weekend, I focused on Netflix capability, since we already pay for a Netflix account and that will be one of the primary uses. </s>
<s> But I could not find a chart that compares tablets' support at a micro level. </s>
<s> I did discover year-old message boards and Netflix tech blogs that stated that Netflix was supporting Android devices (Honeycomb), along with a link to a download for the tablet. </s>
<s> In May 2011 PCWorld listed six recommended Honeycomb tablets and I assume they support Netflix: Xoom, Transformer, Iconia, Flyer, G-Slate and Galaxy. </s>
<s> I couldn't find any newer info on which tablets support Netflix. </s>
<s> Do the iPad and Nexus support it? </s>
<s> What are the minimum processor requirements I should seek in order to enjoy streaming movies and TV? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for your fast response over the weekend. </s>
<s> What's your price range - If you do not have any problems to spend 400-500 bucks on a tablet computer then you should head straight to iPad, Galaxy tab or even Google Nexus 7. </s>
<s> As far as I can see, battery life and processor is one of the most important factors while choosing a tablet for your family member. </s>
<s> You should definitely consider Google Nexus 10 as a forum member mentioned before. </s>
<s> But If I were you - I'd buy either Nexus 10 or iPad 4th (Not mini iPad cause it's the same s*** except it's smaller) </s>
<s> I initially was headed straight for the iPad, but then I started wondering if I could find something cheaper. </s>
<s> I'm signed up for various price discount alerts between now and Black Friday. </s>
<s> There's a Galaxy Tab 2 deal right now for $300 plus free shipping. </s>
<s> But I'm still weighing functionality vs. price. </s>
<s> I agree that battery life and processor are key for our purposes. </s>
<s> I also want to minimize taking on additional fees, such as a data plan or a new movie streaming vendor. </s>
<s> The makers and Netflix aren't answering your questions which is troubling. </s>
<s> But here it is: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8 The confusion I can see in the Android are those no-name tablets that you don't have the Google App Play store. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> To see if your web sites work on them. </s>
<s> While the Kindle Fire HD is really really great some will not like that some sites don't work. </s>
<s> CNET Videos are fine but no videos at Yahoo Finance work. </s>
<s> Go figure? </s>
<s> The KF HD is again, really really great for the buck. </s>
<s> Still getting the Nexus for another reason. </s>
<s> I'm lucky that the office is on the move to Android apps so we are getting more units. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...I should test-drive in person. </s>
<s> After poking around the Netflix blogs a little more, it appears that the Android tablets, iPad and Nook support Netflix. </s>
<s> The online specialis I've seen so far allow returns in extremely limited circumstances, so it's buyer beware. </s>
<s> I now have the Kindle Fire HD 7, a Nexus 7 and some older Android tablets and a few older tablets from last year. </s>
<s> And the phone is now Android 4.0.4. </s>
<s> With a little help from others the Nexus 7 is now able to use most web sites so it's the clear web user winner. </s>

<s> Pantel has today launched one low budget (approx 160$) Android ICS tablet. </s>
<s> It comes with 1.2 GHz chipset processsor and runs on Android ICS platfrom. </s>
<s> Packed with 5000 mAh battery, it supports all standard connectivity and multimedia formats. </s>
<s> Additional and unique thing about this tablet is its 2G SIM compatbilty which let's you enjoy with normal voice call facility. </s>
<s> You can get complpte detailes from here: http://www.techgama.com/2012/11/penta-t-pad-ws802c-2g-launched-with-2g.html </s>
<s> It's usable but junky. </s>
<s> At least it was cheap. </s>
<s> The truly awful thing is how poorly it's integrated with the Android OS. </s>
<s> Some folk think it's fab to be able to type in words but you have to use this setup to see how short they fell in integration. </s>
<s> Pass. </s>

<s> Check out my reviews at: http://pacsnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=160 I chose the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 seven inch, 8GB tablet. </s>
<s> You can find these on sale this Christmas for $179. </s>
<s> I am part of the over 60 crowd and want a tablet for just the same reasons...adding on book reading. </s>
<s> With eyesite going being able to choose the size of the print will be a blessing. </s>
<s> Mainly it will be the simplistic side of having a tablet...e-mail, browsing, simple games, I have both Hulu and Netflix accounts and wi-fi in the home, and the ipod 2 as I do like to take photos and share video every so often. </s>
<s> This may be something he too will enjoy so just an added attraction of the 2nd gen. My family has chosed the ipad 2 with 3 G for me. </s>
<s> The 3G is in case I get stuck at a Drs office for a extended period of time and am willing to pay the data fees. </s>
<s> The 2nd generation seems to be available at lower and lower fees too so good deals are possible. </s>
<s> My kids are all tech savvy, no land lines..only cell phones (new ones every year) and all have tablets and laptops. </s>
<s> The BIG reason they are going ipad for me is because it is easier then Andriod for us oldsters to learn. </s>
<s> I have a Driod X phone and well over 2 years of having it I am still learning how to use it. </s>
<s> We have talked a lot about pros and cons on which talbet to get me and I have tried out the ipad. </s>
<s> My advice is to go with the ipad2..sales will likely get better as they get rid of the 2nd gen stock since everyone is on the new 4G bandwagon right now. </s>
<s> I have seen those..they are blazing fast with stunning visuals! </s>
<s> For older folk and people with learning diabilities I tend to agree that the ipad is easier to learn. </s>
<s> If you think about it - it does us no good to have caring people buy a wonderful item for us if we are not able to understand how to use it AND good of you to care to be able to offer this to someone who I am sure will have his world opened up immensely by what you are going to give him. </s>
<s> Kudos to you! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> After finding very positive reviews of this device, including Netflix users on Amazon, and scoring an online purchase price of $296.00 (and free shipping), I took the plunge. </s>
<s> I'm still exploring the device, which arrived yesterday, but so far it's fantastic. </s>
<s> I had Netflix up and running an Instant Play movie from my Netflix queue in about a half hour. </s>
<s> Not having viewed movies on a smartphone or anything other than my TV or laptop, I didn't know how to get the Netflix app for the Galaxy. </s>
<s> I called Netflix customer support and they explained it. </s>
<s> I haven't watched a movie all the way through, but the first five minutes were great. </s>
<s> This is using my dependable Verizon FIOS wifi from home. </s>
<s> Will be interesting to try this in a hotel, where wifi can be sketchier. </s>
<s> I also set up a Gmail account and surfed my usual sites - Weather Channel, Yahoo, etc. </s>
<s> I'll report back if I encounter any problems. </s>
<s> I have 45 days to return the device. </s>
<s> May be tough to hand this over as a Christmas present, which was the original plan! </s>
<s> Yahoo Business web pages with video didn't play here. </s>
<s> So I found that discussion about Firefox Beta and a link in same discussion for Flash and it's all good now. </s>

<s> If he has a good music library, get an iPad. </s>
<s> All the music from iTunes library will instantly load on iPad, save you time and hassle. </s>
<s> iPad's interface is more consistent, not that Android is overly complex (it has customizable features that might not be useful) Both have ways to track device location, but I think iPad's have a little more control in that regard. </s>
<s> As to durability, iPad's lead in taking dings and bumps. </s>
<s> Check out http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2412184,00.asp . </s>
<s> Good comparisons about tablets. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> It was not funny to find that many websites didn't work on that tablet. </s>
<s> I won't go into great detail but at least on this one I can install another browser and an add on and get to far more sites than when it was stock. </s>
<s> Folk are trying to use these but they are coming up short in many areas. </s>
<s> With billions at their disposal I was a little surprised I needed to add another browser. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i found a 7&quot; tablet a13. </s>
<s> it is about $70. </s>
<s> i used it. </s>
<s> it is cheat and good. </s>
<s> This member SPAMMED the forums and we left this one post. </s>
