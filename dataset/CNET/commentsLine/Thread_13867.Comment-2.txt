if ericson has no such manual on hand and won't answer your questions it's best to move forward with your plans to replace the gear.
yes i see some items with a google search but if you post in a forum it means that that was not what you are looking for.
it would be a shame to search for an user manual if the question was generic such as &quot;can i add or replace the antenna?&quot; bob
