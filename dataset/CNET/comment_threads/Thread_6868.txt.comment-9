i've got a couple of these in service and they hold up well.
and coolermaster gets good reviews on sites that do reviews using proper test equipment.
the power supply label clearly shows that it has 2 18A 12V rails totalling 360W.
the rest of the 500w is devoted to 5V/3.3V... that's normal for any power supply.
a typical pc with an hd 5770 under full load drew less than 300W from the outlet.

just because it's a chevy and not a bmw doesn't mean it won't give 100K miles of transportation.
