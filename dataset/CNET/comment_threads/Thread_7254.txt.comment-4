but, apparently, you want something more specific.
Just because a burner is capable of using LightScribe disks, does not mean you have to use LightScribe disks.
Ordinary Writeable disks work just as well.
Here are links to two of your most affordable options for an external DVD/CD burner.
This one has USB 2.0 connectivity: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/VLU2SD22XLS/ while this one has Firewire and USB 2.0 connectivity: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/VLFW2SD22X/ Both of these are guaranteed to work with your version of OS X and you will not find an easier solution to your problem.
Now, if you want something more specific, here it is.
Go and buy the second option.
