1.1.1	I have an IDE hard drive that I 'm trying to convert to SATA .	St
1.1.2	Here 's the adapter I bought : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16812206002 I connected the female molex into the HD but the other molex doesnt ' connect with the SATA power cable .	St
1.1.3	It seems as if I need a 4 pin female to 15 pin SATA power adapter but ca n't seem to find one .	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions would be highly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? q=4+pin+female+to+15+pin+SATA+power+adapter	Ques
1.3.1	my logic tells me this is a ide harddrive so why do I need a special & quot ; power & quot ; cable ?	Ques
1.3.2	The data cable may need to be different but not the power cable .	St
1.4.1	Call me dumb because I missed that when I first read it .	St
1.4.2	I agree -- just connect the standard 4-pin Molex connector to the power adapter cable included with the device .	Res
1.4.3	Connect the other ends of the power adapter cable to the hard drive and the device .	St
1.5.1	I hope you did n't do what I did .	St
1.5.2	I bought a new SATA II hard drive 300mb/per second transfer bla bla bla .	St
1.5.3	Installed it and then looked in device manager and realized I have a Ultra ATA Controller .	St
1.5.4	It 's installed and works but because the controller is Ultra ATA I assume I am only going to get the old school speed of up to 100mb/per second .	St
1.5.5	Could have saved a few dollars maybe if I had done my research though .	St
1.5.6	FYI Western Digital Internal Hard Drive ( WD2500KS ) 300mb/s 16mb cache $ 89 at Circuit City	St
1.6.1	Even those SATA drives that have both type of power ports , they clearly say never hook power to both of them or damage may occur .	St
1.6.2	Also remember that both SATA and PATA BOTH are , IN FACT , IDE drives .	St
1.6.3	Hope that over time we start using PATA and SATA .	St
1.6.4	Hey Ahtoi , if you are Art from the zdnet forums , hello old friend .	St
1.7.1	I still like to give misinformation here now and then , lol .	St
