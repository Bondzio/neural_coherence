Hi to everyone and thanks in advance for any help...
I think that my ISP is throttling my bandwidth at the modem and I am here to ask help on how access full available bandwidth.
When the technician installed the fibre optic line and then the modem, he showed me an amazing 77MB/s (about 600Mbps) before the modem!!
But after the technician left these were the test results after the router: 1) SpeedTests.net: averages, after router, show: UP between 56/60Mbps & DN 45/75Mbps 2) Local Server Speed Test: average: UP 45Mpbs & DN 170Mbps A Japanese Internet savvy guy explained that NTT East throttles the available bandwidth at the building by specific apartment/modem settings related to individual contract bundles.
I signed up for the top bundle: TV, Phone and Internet connections.
This is my Hardware/software setup: OS: Win7, Line specs: Line type: IEC60874-14 Connector type: SC Core across: 9 micrometers Clad across: 125 micrometers ITU-TG-652 NTT East fibreoptic TV/Internet/Telephone bundle (100Mbps best effort) Hikari Next Family Type but 10Mbps is considered within parameters Asahi ISP Internet contract Modem: GE-PON (WAN+Coaxial TV antenna) &quot;SCM-GE-PON-&lt;H&gt;A GV-ONU D&lt;1&gt;&quot; model Router: RT-S300HI (4 Giga ports + 1 phone) Router & Modem have Japanese firmware which I cannot understand and, according to the NTT East, I must rent both modem and router from them and &quot;will not support any other modem/router setup&quot;.
I could not understand if it was because of technical or contractual limits.
I have tried to test my throughput after the modem but I could not figure out where the DNS, IP, WAN etc strings of numbers should go and, in the end, I simply cannot connect to the internet from my laptop directly to the modem so I cannot perform the same speed tests after the modem.
I appreciate help and I thank in advance for reading thus far and for any help and expertise which any one can spare/offer!
