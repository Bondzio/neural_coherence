I would have avoid Acronis altogether.
All this partitioning and more seems to have ended badly.
What I learned years ago is to learn the native tools, use simpler setups so repairs could be done without calling Acronis.
If I had to deal with this I would install just the new drive, clean it off by booting my XP/other CD and installing the OS and drivers.
Then I'd add the old drive and recover my stuff.
