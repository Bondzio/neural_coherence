i think i'm seeing the end of this medium for storage.
today's users seem to be very impatient and will not accept the 10 minutes or so to create a dvd or bd disc.
not only that but the cost of usb sticks and drives plummeted to make this media unloved by so many.
i wonder how much longer we'll see this media.
