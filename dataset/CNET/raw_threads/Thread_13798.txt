I use Epson ink only. I have adjusted all setting over an over, have completely replaced all ink cartridges and cleaned the heads multiple times. I am using the Epson drivers. The test print after cleaning appears good. Ideas? Thanks

If it's still under warranty, go there. Sounds like the color rendering in the printer is bad. It could be a bad ribbon cable. The good &quot;test&quot; sheet is never printed at full resolution. Sorry. and life goes on... Jack
