After I read http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i5,2410.html my thoughts are you may want to find an i5 based system and then pick a video card from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2404.html It would be hard to do better than that.

If I may add.. they also have a good forum similar here, you can consult people and computer enthusiasts there if you encounter any problems. Good luck on your new PC.
