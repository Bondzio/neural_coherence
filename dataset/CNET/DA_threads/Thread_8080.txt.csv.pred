1.1.1	OK , I 've researched and learned what I could ( limited depth on computers ) and now I 'd like some good advice .	St
1.1.2	I want a new computer that I will be using primarily for photoshop .	St
1.1.3	Am I better off going with the i7-920 or will the difference be negligible if I go with the less expensive i7-860 or i5 ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Rather than the CPU itself , you probably want one that can handle more threads .	St
1.2.2	i5 CPUs in quad core currently do n't do hyperthreading .	St
1.2.3	i7s do .	St
1.2.4	Your budget will be a deciding factor .	St
1.3.1	here are some photoshop benchmarks with both and the i5 : http : //www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx ? i=3704 & p=8 the diff in photoshop may not be that much , the diff in video apps is huge .	St
1.3.2	overall , i believe the i-860 to be best cpu from a price/performance standpoint .	St
1.4.1	... that was the kind of data I was looking for .	St
1.4.2	Thanks .	Polite
