If I wanted to try this my thought is to boot up a linux machine and use the linux strings command on the device. Read http://www.linfo.org/strings.html This would read the entire drive and emit any text strings it finds. Usually more than enough to see if the drive was blank. Bob

11548	6	387870	3273369	3273343	R. Proffitt	3/23/10 7:05 AM	1.2693279E12	Verifying.	Your post didn't tell what you used to wipe the drive. For example DBAN is well known to work. But you are asking to check the results which is going to take just a little more work. Some might call that advanced. To vet the erasure we can not rely on any tool that says &quot;your drive is erased&quot; but look to existing tools that can emit something useful. This brings us to &quot;what could work?&quot; and &quot;what we can use for free?&quot; and &quot;what wouldn't tax the users too hard?&quot; For me that's almost any of the bootable linux CDs and one command called strings. -&gt; But I hear you loud and clear. I bet you want something web based with a button that is labeled &quot;Click here to verify your drive is blank.&quot; The problem is, there is no such software today. Bob

Killdisk is known to wipe a drive just fine BUT that is not what you are asking. You asked how to tell if it worked. And to answer your next question, no install of Linux is required to get to use strings to see what might be left on the hard drive. Bob

And, if I use the strings command in Linux will it tell me if any other type of media e.g. music files, pictures, etc. besides printable characters were found? Thanks.
11548	11	387870	3273520	3273511	R. Proffitt	3/23/10 11:22 AM	1.26934332E12	Why strings is my answer.	Because a jpeg file would have text inside it that strings would find. Sorry, I've given you my best answer. It requires all of a boot to the CD, open the command line and typing one line and pressing enter. I can't see it getting any easier than that outside of having it done for you. Let's see what others tell. Bob
11548	12	387870	3273528	3273520	zoomy123	3/23/10 11:43 AM	1.26934458E12	File Formats	Would strings find videos, music files, etc.? Listen, if strings only works with printable characters and I have file formats which do not contain printable characters, then your method is useless to me! This is why I asked for other methods. Your systematic evasion of my questions is starting to frustrate me. Just answer my questions, please. Thanks.

So, yes, strings is a very good way to tell. I never evaded your question. I only am leaving other methods to others. Bob
