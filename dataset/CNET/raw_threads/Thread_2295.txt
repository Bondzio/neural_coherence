It has an 80GB hard drive in it. I have been trying to burn bigger image files and things on to dvds and cds but I still feel unconfortable with how full my hard drive is becoming. This also means I feel uneasy about loading more programs and things on to an already fullish laptop. Ideally I would like to run atleast games off of an exteral hard drive and some programs. I would also like to store all of my music on it. (and ofcourse back lots of other things up) Is it possible to run things like this off of it, or am I simply asking to much of an external hard drive? Thanks for any help in advance.
