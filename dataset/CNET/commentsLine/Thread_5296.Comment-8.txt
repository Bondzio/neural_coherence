the bad news: it wont run those graphic intensive games.
it will most likely handle all the general tasks like email,web surfing etc... the good news: as long as the motherboard in the system also has a pci or even better, a pci express slot, or even still better a pci express 2.0 slot available you can upgrade to a good graphics card in the future as a decent video card today at 200-300 dollars, will a year from now be 60-125 dollars!
