<s> Be sure to do the work. </s>

<s> nah, the link didnt work! </s>
<s> say, can increasing my ram be any helpful? </s>
<s> or is it because of the power supply? </s>
<s> 250 watt power supply DirectX 9 Does not specify RAM requirements here. </s>
<s> You may wish to search them out in the EVGA &quot;support&quot; page, as well as other hardware requirement to run this card. </s>
<s> How about the most resent driver? </s>

<s> The requirement (from manual) for the fx5500 are: IBM or 100% PC compatible with genuine Pentium II or AMD K6-2 class processor or higher. </s>
<s> One available AGP 2.0 compliant slot or better, or one available PCI slot (as required for your specific card). </s>

<s> nd yes, i have the latest drivers installed. </s>
<s> My friend tells me to reinstall OS, but its a real pain, and not guaranteed to work, btw, there is no problem with other tasks in the PC, just games. </s>
<s> You have a dated system. </s>
<s> Increasing ram and swapping out the PSU seems to be your best bet. </s>
<s> Under XP OS, having 512mb is practical, 1gb being the most sensible. </s>
<s> Gaming just puts it all in a basket and tests the wankle out of it, so upgrade. </s>
<s> Since, you system is older don't expect the newer demanding games to run as well too after the upgrades, they want so much more as you review those requirements so beware. </s>
<s> If possible, you may want to look for a better cpu as well for the total upgrade path options. </s>
<s> Yours *may* support upto 2.4ghz/P4 and that too needs better PSU. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
