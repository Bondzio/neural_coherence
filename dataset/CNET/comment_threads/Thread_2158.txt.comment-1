Hi everyone, newbie here.
I'd like to get a wireless webcam so I don't have to have my computer on all the time to have the cam running.
If I get a wireless webcam can I view a stream of what is going on in my house from somewhere else or do I need to have server space somewhere else first?
I'm leaving on a vacation soon so I'd like to set one up asap if possible.
Thanks!
