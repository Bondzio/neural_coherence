Ironically, laptops shouldn't be used on a lap, but on a flat surface in order to allow venting or better heat disappation.
Notebooks, is the more correct term and yes, laptops/notebooks get very warm or even hot to touch.
The bottom surface should be free of obstructions in order for better air circulation and/or install a notebook cooler.
Mothing more than fans mounted on an attachable device to help cool the notebook.
This is serious stuff as many new notebooks get way too hot now and most come already with some feature to better help in this regard, installed.
good luck -----Willy
