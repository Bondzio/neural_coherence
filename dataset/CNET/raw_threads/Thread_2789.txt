11654	0	593702	5460682	NR	anomalously	5/25/13 11:40 AM	1.369482E12	Do I need to know more than just AM3 for new cpu?	My mobo: ASRock 770icafe chipset : AMD RD770 Current CPU: AMD Athlon II x2 255 (Socket AM3 938) Can I buy any processor that says AM3, or do I have to take note on the number 938 and only buy something that has 938 in the title? I tried googling this.... It must be a dumb question.. For instance, I am looking at: AMD Phenom II X4 965 Black Edition Deneb 3.4GHz Socket AM3 125W Quad-Core Processor HDZ965FBGMBOX Does the number 965 have any significance? Is it 965 pins and will not fit my socket am3 that only allows 938 pins? Please, someone tell me I'm looking to far into this and slap me with a simple answer. Thank you very much in advance.

This can be restricted to a subset of all the CPUs with the same socket because of speeds and features that might not be supported. ` Good luck.

Long ago I ran into boards that did have the CPU on the list but required the BIOS be updated BEFORE you installed the CPU. For those boards we had to have an older CPU to do the upgrade. Frankly my vote was to RMA the lot. Bob
