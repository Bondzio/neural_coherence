I would advise you to hook up the new drive to IDE #1 channel by itself, and gang the CD ROM drive and the old drive to the secondary ide cable.
this way, whenever you are doing CD reading or xferring files, you won't be asking one cable to do all the work.
I am told this works better.
--fj ps do cable select on the jumpers.
