<s> I recently installed Network Magic on my PC and on another in a home network. </s>
<s> Since the install, about 6 GBs of space has mysteriously disappeared from my hard drive. </s>
<s> I have installed no other programs. </s>
<s> I've already looked at the obvious culprits, such as fragmented files, clearing out the various caches, defragging, etc., and I'm stumped. </s>
<s> Network Magic is a very small program (less than 50 MBs), so I'm not sure whether its installation and the disk space disappearance are purely coincidental, or whether there's truly a correlation. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas of what could be going on? </s>
<s> The changes to get the network going likely caused more restore points. </s>
<s> If all is well, the usual cure is to disable then re-enable System Restore. </s>
<s> (How is told in the Start, Help pages.) </s>

<s> System Restore was the issue. </s>
<s> When I cleared out the restore points (many from eons ago, I'm sure), the system restored 11 GBs of hard drive space! </s>
<s> Thanks again and Happy New Year! </s>
<s> Go look up Crap Cleaner. </s>
<s> Be sure to read what it does since some will clean everything and wonder why menus are now unsorted, etc. </s>

<s> If so, I've been using it for some time on all my PCs. </s>
<s> Excellent product! </s>
<s> I've never had it do anything unsightly to any of them, from file cleanups to registry cleanups. </s>
<s> In fact, I'd already used it to see if it would make a dent in the 6 GBs of space before I did your fix. </s>
<s> Again; thanks for the help. </s>
<s> You've already done the CCLeaner. </s>
<s> I found 2 items to toss with this Decra____. </s>
