<s> I've watched half of my new &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; on my home computer, which sports a Pioneer BDC-202 Blu-Ray player. </s>
<s> Now, however, I can read and write other disks, but the 202 has stopped recognizing Blu-Ray disks altogether! </s>
<s> The only updates I've made are Microsoft's -- updates I've grown increasingly wary of -- and I'm wondering if it could be the updates that are creating this problem! </s>
<s> Not only will my PowerDVD 8 not see it, neither can I get my system to see any content. </s>
<s> Indeed, it thinks there is no disk there. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening? </s>
<s> I can't believe it's a hardware problem, but who knows? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> That tells me it's unlikely a software problem. </s>
<s> But try reinstall the software anyway; it can't hurt. </s>
<s> Of course hardware do fail sometime but hopefully this is not the case. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks, but there's no software I can retry. </s>
<s> I go to the DVD drive icon and click on it, and it doesn't see any disk. </s>
<s> Yet if I put a standard DVD into it, it will read it just fine. </s>
<s> a BD-rom drive can be had for about $50 now. </s>
<s> As for why dvd works but not BD, my understand is that there 2 different scanning laser (1 for dvd and 1 for BD). </s>
<s> Strange, but I popped in my Stargate Blu-Ray disc today and it plays fine. </s>
<s> Willy Wonka used to play fine, too, but now my system can't see the disk. </s>
<s> Why would it see other Blu-Ray discs, but not a disc that had played once with ease? </s>
<s> If I can't get a workable answer, I'll have to buy a fifty dollar LG disc player. </s>
<s> go to the store and get another one. </s>
