Hi there: My motherobard is ''P4TSP-D2 that has the following features: up to 3.06GHz(FSB533), 3.6GHz(FSB800) and Celeron Processor from 2.0 to 2.4GHz 400MHz/533MHz/800MHz system interface speed Socket 478 Prescott supports from latest MB version 1.3 of P4TSP-D2. CHIPSET Intel 848P/ICH5 I have a bisic components in my machine: Gforce 5200 series from biostar, 2x256 DDRAM 400MB . Intel Pentium 4 processor 3.0GHz 2 drives one is sata which has my operating system and the other one is parralel ide connection. My question is this. I can't seem to hardware components in pci slots. If i do so for example sound card 24 bit creative the PnP dects it as simple pci connection and then i look and instead of giving me the name of creative whic phisically i added it it give generic 56 sound plaster and question marks. it really acted funny. It did to all my pci components. I even check the cmos setup and altered it and no use.No only that but also I formated my hard drvie and re-installed xp but no to avail. what could be the problem?

You should have a driver cd that came with your motherboard or computer. Place it in the cd drive and install the drivers. You may have to reboot the computer and let Windows install each device.

A Plug N PLay OS like XP will try to find the drivers, if it can then your OK. If it can't it may put in it's closest guess, which will probably NOT work. So for video and sound cards you allwise have to install the correct drivers. John
