<s> I recently purchased cable internet from Cox, I have everything connected as the instructions say, but occasionaly (just happened again) the internet will just lose the signal. </s>
<s> I have encrypted it with a unique password and all, I am trying to find out why I keep getting the intermittent signal losses. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Cable modem model? </s>
<s> Wireless router model? </s>
<s> Wireless network adapter model? </s>
<s> Computer operating system? </s>
<s> If Windows XP, is it SP2 ? </s>
<s> Cable modem - Webstar DPC2100 Router - Linksys WRT54GS Network adapter - (Netgear cant see number because im online, but its a new one) And I have XP with SP2. </s>
<s> - The reason why I think its something in the house is because when im at school, starbucks, or panera it dosnt disconnect randomly. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Download and install the latest router FIRMWARE for the WRT54GS. </s>
<s> Do the same for the wireless network adapter DRIVER. </s>
<s> Try changing the broadcast channel of the router to 1, 6, or 11. </s>
<s> This can help to eliminate interference. </s>
<s> After you do this, you will need to enable SSID broadcast to connect for the first time. </s>
