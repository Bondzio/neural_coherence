i have the same problem of (the disk is write protected, ...) with kingston data traveller ii plus 1gb, the same like you, can not move or delete or edit or create new files on the drive although it has sufficient space.
i have tried even formating under win xp professional with service pack 2, and win 2000 service pack 4, and even under dos and using partition magic, but always recieve the same message of write protection - i looked for any option to remove a write protection in the settings and properties in device manager, but nothing and no solution also on kingston faq we page - nor in win xp help i've just sent e-mail to kingston technical assitant please if any one can provide help .....
