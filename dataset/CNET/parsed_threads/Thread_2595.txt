<s> Well, I did search some. </s>
<s> And I hesitate because someone will say not upgrade this old rig. </s>
<s> Abit AN8 (ultra), socket 939, Athlon 3500+ @ 2.47 Ghz, DDR400 ram, 4 Gig Matching Corsair XMS, nForce4 chipset, I'm running W7 64 and it runs Areo. </s>
<s> I was thinking to upgrade my 6600le NVidia. </s>
<s> I was sorta looking at Radeon HD 4850, or maybe a 56xx or 57xx series. </s>
<s> THE QUESTIONS: 1. </s>
<s> Can I over kill on vid card so much as to cause problems?? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Since everything about this mobo is Nvidia, will this old hardware &quot;like&quot; a new Radeon card as well as it might &quot;like&quot; a new NVidea? </s>
<s> You wonder why spend money on old set ... </s>
<s> I dunno, I LIKE my old box, I guess I just want to see how far I can max it out. </s>
<s> My retirement income is such that I can find extra $100 once in a while, but if I build new, I would not be content to go low end. </s>
<s> And long as this box runs well, I can't justify spending that much. </s>
<s> Anyway, please Advise, Criticize, or Insult. </s>
<s> I want to hear it. </s>
<s> Let me mention 2 cards I own and have put on a Watt Meter (similar to the P3 Watt Meter). </s>
<s> Both installed in machines exactly like yours so comparisons are doable and maybe interesting to you. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> A Nvidia 9500GT with 512MB. </s>
<s> The socket 939 box tops out at 120 Watts in total and idles at 70ish Watts. </s>
<s> I tried an ATI card but it pegged the CPU so I went with Nvidia. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A Nvidia GeForce GT 220 1024 MB DDR3 PCI-Express Graphics Card http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SG7LUQ/ref=oss_product I chose this because of the Watts but also because the next model up had complaints of fan noise. </s>
<s> The GT 220 on a HP d4999t w/4GB RAM, etc tops out at 140 Watts and is very nice. </s>
<s> I'd consider item 2. </s>

<s> Bob, if you are still tracking, I bought that one. </s>
<s> EVga, 1 Gig, DDR3. </s>
<s> Got it in without a hitch, ran the provided CD, then went to their website and got latest driver. </s>
<s> The monitor picture is maybe just a little sharper, and some things happen faster when I click. </s>
<s> Thanks, again. </s>
<s> It sounds like the upgrade was a success. </s>
<s> It looks like my kid may get one of these. </s>
<s> A HP d5000t quad core was found cheap so we moved his old Nvidia 6600 card over and he is settling in. </s>
<s> No hurry but we'll see about getting another card like this for him later. </s>
<s> Thanks for the report. </s>
<s> Sounds like it worked out well for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
