<s> I recently upgraded to a new computer and got a Seagate 120GB SATA hard drive with it. </s>
<s> I have a DVD-ROM and a CDRW also. </s>
<s> But me being me I hate getting the computer with all the different crap on the hard drive so I reformatted and reinstalled WinXP Pro. </s>
<s> I know you have to go into device manager under IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers and make sure you have &quot;DMA mode if available&quot; selected. </s>
<s> Well I am pretty sure my DVD-ROM and CDRW are configured to Ultra DMA Mode 2 on my Primary IDE Channel. </s>
<s> That would leave my hard drive under the Secondary IDE Channel configured as Ultra DMA Mode 5. </s>
<s> Here is why I ask: #1) I really do not know how the computers hard drive was configured originally because I reformatted and reinstalled the OS. </s>
<s> #2) When I run SiSoft Sandra Pro 2004 it continually tells that my hard drive is underachieving. </s>
<s> It says it should be set to Ultra DMA Mode 6. </s>
<s> #3) When I get my hard disk check results at PCPitstop.com I get unusually low percentage results (%43) in either cached or uncached speed (cant remember). </s>
<s> I have a DFI I875ProB motherboard and have the latest BIOS installed. </s>
<s> The BIOS is setup to use ICH5 Raid type. </s>
<s> Not Highpoint Raid because I only have a single hard drive. </s>
<s> Plus when I install and configure for Highpoint Raid the computer boots completely different (meaning extra boot screens for the Highpoint Raid controller) from when I originally got the machine. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated as I am totally in the dark on this problem if it is a problem?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Before I reply, note that some will never understand the benchmarks are rarely duplicated or repeatable. </s>
<s> You have to take it with some salve that you may never see the numbers that you see posted. </s>
<s> Too often, the person posts the best numbers they ever saw or just fibs. </s>
<s> Another issue is what's in the benchmark is not the same hardware as you have. </s>
<s> But let's give it a go? </s>
<s> Here is why I ask: #1) I really do not know how the computers hard drive was configured originally because I reformatted and reinstalled the OS. </s>
<s> No question here. </s>
<s> #2) When I run SiSoft Sandra Pro 2004 it continually tells that my hard drive is underachieving. </s>
<s> It says it should be set to Ultra DMA Mode 6. </s>
<s> While interesting, what was the score? </s>
<s> #3) When I get my hard disk check results at PCPitstop.com I get unusually low percentage results (%43) in either cached or uncached speed (cant remember). </s>
<s> Most complain about uncached speed. </s>
<s> Which is interesting only in benchmarks since in real life we let it cache. </s>
<s> Only by changing hard disks to say 10,000 RPM units and such will you push this number. </s>
<s> Let's ask this -&gt; Are you going to replace hard disks, motherboards and such just for a better benchmark? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Already set I think everything is good now. </s>
<s> Thanks anyways! </s>
<s> I am facing problem SATA drive for Windows 2000 Pro installation. </s>
