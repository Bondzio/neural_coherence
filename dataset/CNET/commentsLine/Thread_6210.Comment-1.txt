hi, i have a question about the data transfer rate of sata drives.
i am looking to build a new desktop pc and looking to upgrade to an internal sata drive.
however, i am confused about the data transfer rate.
take a look at this ad from bestbuy.com; hitachi - deskstar 1tb internal hard drive oa34915 serial ata interface; data transfer rates up to 3gb/sec.
; 32mb cache buffer this is a cover page.
when i click on the item detail; 1tb maximum storage capacity serial ata interface data transfer rates up to 300mb/sec.
32mb cache buffer 7200 rpm for fast read/write times 8.5 ms average seek time pc compatible so, what is the data transfer rate of this drive - 3.0gb/sec or 300mb/sec?
can someone shed some light on this?
thank you.
