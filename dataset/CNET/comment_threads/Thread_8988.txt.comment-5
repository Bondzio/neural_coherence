Several tablets have a hdmi port, usb port, sd card slot.
These are the main ports that you will find.
Some 7 inch tablets have all of those ports but for the most part they are missing something.
Like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 has a micro sd card, usb (mini or micro i forget), but no hdmi.
Whats your price range, that would help narrow it down.
