Why not try Firefox? If you like it you will stay with it. If not, you can always uninstall it. Mark

As many others do for security reasons, I only use IE for Windows Updates, code testing, and those sites that require IE. Ciao.

For some strange reason IE &quot;hangs up&quot; and I usually have to exit and re-enter the program, I don't have this problem with Firefox...That's why I prefer it. Like others have said...Why not try it?...you can always un-install it if you don't like it. Occasionally (rarely is more accurate) a website will require IE ...I simply close the Firefox browser and fire up the IE (hoping it doesn't freeze up).
