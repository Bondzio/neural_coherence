This fails as a backup on 2 points.
1.
No write protect switch.
Connecting such to an infected system can result in the backup being lost.
Or operator errors!
2.
No backup to the backup.
A backup system has multiple copies so that if one fails, you go get the next oldest copy.
This would be one backup device and no copy to fall back on.
If a copy is all you need, then such will be fine.
But you won't see me put my lifetime digital photo collection at rish on such a system!
