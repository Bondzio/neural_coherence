1.1.1	My wife 's computer 's hard drive died .	St
1.1.2	I tried installing both IDE and SATA drives to use for the restore .	St
1.1.3	None of them are recognized by the Disk Management system on the Restore CD .	St
1.1.4	The BIOS shows the HDD .	St
1.1.5	I partitioned and formatted the new SATA HDD on my computer and reinstalled it on the wife 's computer .	St
1.1.6	I have changed all of the HHD settings shown in the BIOS i.e .	St
1.1.7	ACHI/IDE and Native/Legacy .	St
1.1.8	The motherboard is Intel ; I think it is DG33FB , but I can not find the model number .	St
1.1.9	The defective HHD was a 320 GB Seagate .	St
1.1.10	The new HDD is a Western Digital 500 GB .	St
1.1.11	The CD that came with the WD is supposed to be bootable , but it will not boot .	St
1.1.12	I tried asking Microsoft , but they claim it is a hardware problem .	St
1.1.13	I am at a loss as what to do .	St
1.1.14	Help , please ! !	St
1.1.15	!	St
1.2.1	CD/DVD drives loose boot capability but work fine in windows so no surprise to me ( just those that encounter it the first and about the first ten times . )	St
1.2.2	Microsoft is right to not support this but it is annoying .	St
1.2.3	Let 's not ask them to support booting a WD CD .	St
1.2.4	- & gt ; Try disabling AHCI mode .	St
1.2.5	Without a driver diskette ( the famous F6 FLOPPY you find at google ) XP has no clue what SATA is .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	SATA was n't offered when XP came out .	St
1.3.2	Thus you need the driver provided by the HD maker .	St
1.3.3	Visit the WD support website and get it or check your WD CD and see if its there .	St
1.3.4	If so , expand it and make a bootable floppy ( usually ) or access by another bootable means .	St
1.3.5	Thus , when you use your restore CD when it asks , & quot ; outside drivers needed/required & quot ; or similar wording during the XP install .	St
1.3.6	A restore CD should offer small menu to supply whatever to continue the install process .	St
1.3.7	FYI , the making of XP install on another system just wo n't work when swapped to the end system .	St
1.3.8	On top of the SATA issue you will have a XP blank screen or blinking cursor as a result .	St
1.3.9	Review the bios setting so SATA is active and/or both SATA+ EIDE if you plan to use EIDE too .	St
1.3.10	You will need also to make the boot order , if SATA is going to be the primary boot device , enable it .	Sug
1.3.11	You may need to play with it for best results as it varies from bios to bios and mtrbds .	St
1.3.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	WD will not supply a driver for your computer or the drive .	St
1.4.2	SATA is part of the motherboard and the driver is from that maker .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
