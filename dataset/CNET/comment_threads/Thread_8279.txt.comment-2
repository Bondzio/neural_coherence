and then you get to fool with voltages, and then with...
The AMD 2400+ should have been set to &quot;factory specs&quot; of Multiplier of 15, FSB 133 and voltage 1.65 in the first place though.
With the 100 Mhz you were underclocking yours.

Stability and longevity of components is a good reason to not OC but realistically you are likely not going to keep the same system long enough to allow that to make much difference.
Had a Pentium Pro 200 that I ran at 266 for three years without problem and a Pentium Pro 166 that I clocked to 233 that gave up the ghost after about 4 months.
