first off , excuse my language.
i'm from turkey.
i have a faculty project which will need to touch on &quot;channel allocation for ad hoc wireless networks&quot;.
i did some google search but found not much to help.
so , if anyone could refer me to a web site , a book or any document so on about this subject , i'll be one of the happiest men in the world.
thanks already.
