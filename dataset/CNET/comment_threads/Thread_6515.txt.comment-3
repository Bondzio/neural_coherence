Hello, In Hoaspital network both the machines are communicating through switches.
Actual problem is when I am putting both the machine togather on the network one of the machine is asking again and again for a restart.
So I am thinking this problem might be related to an IP conflict.
Please suggest me.
Both the machines have static IP addresses.
Thanks
