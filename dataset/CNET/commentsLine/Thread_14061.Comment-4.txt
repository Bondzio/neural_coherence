i thought we didn't connect it to the wan/modem port.
you only wanted the hub ports to work?
remember that i tend to use the networking lingo so when you ask me about a switch, i'll include the non-switched hub as well unless you write more.
when we use these dsl modems for the switch, we would never use the wan port.
that's a given.
