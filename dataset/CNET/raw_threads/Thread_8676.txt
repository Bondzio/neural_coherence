Trying it will be the only way to tell for sure. Upgrading CPUs is more for generic clone PCs...not off the shelf boxes from Dell, HP, etc., VAPCMD

Quad core was nice in its day but today I wonder if I would make the change you have discussed. I would if it was under 50 bucks and then move on. The problem is that beyond the CPU I bet I'd need a new HSF unit and maybe a bigger PSU. And after all that, I wonder it it would be much faster. That is, I moved from one video transcoder to HANDBRAKE and found bigger speed gains than what I would expect from changing the CPU. Why? Because this transcoder uses all cores of the CPU where my old software was single core. Bob
