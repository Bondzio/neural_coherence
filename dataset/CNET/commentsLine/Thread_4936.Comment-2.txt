if all you have are two pcs connected, it's likely just peer-to-peer and there is no network manager.
you will have administrative and possibly limited accounts on the individual computers and, perhaps, some sharing of folder and/or printers between the two.
if you set up your own computer, you likely used an administrator account.
but, you cannot access your roommate's pc without some additional configuration.
i can only imagine the mcafee message might be from trying to do a network scan rather than files/folders on your own pc.
