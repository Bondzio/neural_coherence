<s> I have an Nvida GeForce FX 5600 256MB AGP8X version and the fan on the card is starting to die out. </s>
<s> Every now and then (its getting more frequent) the fan will make a noise as if its blades are rubbing against something (theyre not, ive checked many many times.) </s>
<s> One of these days the fan will just die, and well if the fan dies i think we all know what will happen to the card. </s>
<s> I need to know where i can get a fan that can fit the card, and the cards power supply (the current fan draws its power from a power port thats on the card.) </s>
<s> The power interface is less important since I can just plug it into the computers power supply. </s>
<s> I dont know what the dimensions of the fan are (i guess i could measure it and find out) and i have no idea how much power the fan runs on. </s>
<s> Ive looked on the nvidia site and they dont have anything since they dont sell their products direct. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help </s>
<s> Nvidia does chips and not fans or boards, so they won't help you out. </s>
<s> Try 1coolpc.com or the maker of the card. </s>

<s> If its one of those &quot;generic&quot; type of box fans and not a fancy fan, it should be 40mm or 50mm in size. </s>
<s> Alot of part websites offer replacement fans, besides the fan size, look for &quot;depth/thickness&quot; of fan, it could make a differece. </s>
<s> Look here or elsewhere: http://www.computersurplusoutlet.com http://www.jdr.com http://www.newegg.com http://www.allelectronics.com (used/new) -OR- if push comes to shove, try a rescue of fan: HOW TO FIX A FAN ================== TOOLS ----------- 1) Sharp penknife or safety razor 2) Light oil, like sewing machine or household oil (3-in-1 oil) 3) Plain Scotch tape or similar PROCEDURE ------------------- If you have a noisy fan and no replacement, try the following. </s>
<s> Remove fan from mounting and save screws or unclip the fan. </s>
<s> Clean any dust or dirt build-up at this time as best as possible. </s>
<s> Now with fan in hand, most fans have a sticker maybe with some logo, this is the top side, the bottom side sticker, probably blank. </s>
<s> The bottom side is the side you want to work on. </s>
<s> Slice a small half-moon cut, slightly off-center on the sticker/decal on the bottom. </s>
<s> You *don't* want to remove sticker/decal entirely. </s>
<s> Flip flap open to expose center of fan and place 1-drop of oil there, don't over do it, blot any excess oil. </s>
<s> Rotate the fan to work the oil in and then place fan with bottom side up on a flat surface. </s>
<s> Allow gravity to migrate oil into bearing for 10-minutes.When done, tape over the cut flap and remount fan. </s>
<s> Use deft care and don't over-tighten screws, you're done. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
