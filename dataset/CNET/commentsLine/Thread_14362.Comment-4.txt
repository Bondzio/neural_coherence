while the above is generally true, the asus a7n8x-e deluxe board will run successfully in dual channel mode with, say, two sticks of 256mb pc3200 in channel &quot;a&quot;, and one stick of 512mb pc3200 in channel &quot;b&quot;, providing a total of one gig of memory.
this board has only three memory slots, and the configuration data supplied in the asus manual can be confusing.
