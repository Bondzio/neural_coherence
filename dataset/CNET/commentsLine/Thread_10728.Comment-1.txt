i have just been given 2 old computers a dell and a tiny to play with.
i want to find out what hardware is inside without dismantling them.
is there any software that will do this for me.
i want to find out what kind of memory they have, what hard drives and what processor.
i know i can get some info from my computer etc.
the dell one is running win 98 but i haven't tried the tiny one yet.
any help gratefuly received
