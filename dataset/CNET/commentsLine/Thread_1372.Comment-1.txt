ordered a desk top from dell (dimension e310) and would like to upgrade the video card (to play battlefield 2).
does anyone know how i would find out what type of card i need or how to find out what type this pc needs?
agp or pci?
short of opening the back and looking inside.
the game requires as a minimum a nvidia geforce fx 5700 or ati radeon 8500 or greater.
my pc more than meets all the minimum requirements for the game, but not the video card
