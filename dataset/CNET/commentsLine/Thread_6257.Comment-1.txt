my primary home wireless is a linksys wrt54gs broadband router.
i have an older netgear wgr614 wireless router that i would like to setup as a wireless bridge to use in another room to connect my other electronics to (i.e tv, blu-ray, wii).i would appreciate any help on how to accomplish this.thanks in advance....phil
