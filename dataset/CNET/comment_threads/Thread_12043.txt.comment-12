and looked at their FAQ's, or email them and ask about &quot;Locked&quot;.
Maybe search for drive locked in these forums.
I noted such posts a number of times.
Still confused why you were putting SP 2 on the slave drive.
You only need the operating system on the boot drive.
Don't worry about paperweight.
As Art says they are warranteed and the major drive mfr's honor it with no questions asked.
They may ask a question or two to see if they can get you to unlock it.
If not they give you an RMA and reasonably quick turnaround.
