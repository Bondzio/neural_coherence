<s> I have XP both on my desktop and laptop. </s>
<s> Both computers came with preinstalled nt adapters. </s>
<s> I bought a compatible wire/wireless router. </s>
<s> I did manage to get it setup in the wired configuration. </s>
<s> Now, I would like to use my laptop in another room, upstairs..obviously, ethernet connection is out of the question. </s>
<s> Question 1: Can i get a usb wireless adapter for the laptop and be able to get into the internet while the desktop is off or disconnected? </s>
<s> Just how does that work? </s>
<s> Does my usb adapter catch a beam or something from my router downstairs? </s>
<s> Also an aquaintance of mine said that I do not need to buy another adapter, I will be able to use the one that is in the laptop preinstalled. </s>
<s> Is this possible, or am I being gullible? </s>
<s> Are those adapters that are preinstalled compatible for wire and/or wireless? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Please hurry, I'm expecting another heat wave and would like to get it setup prior to that coming on again:) </s>
<s> There is a lot of other information that we would need to be helpful and really answer your question. </s>
<s> But a generalized answer would be: If you have a wireless router (what brand/model do you have? </s>
<s> ), you should be able to set it up to use with your laptop. </s>
<s> Many laptops do come with wireless cards built in, but you would have to provide more information about what kind of laptop you have. </s>
<s> And if it does not, then using an external USB card should work fine. </s>
<s> If you are using a wireless router, do you have high speed internet of some kind (DSL, cable, etc)? </s>
<s> If you have high speed of some kind, you should be able to configure your machines/router to use the link independently of the other (no need to have one machine on all the time to access the internet.) </s>
<s> If you are using dial up of some kind and internet connection sharing then you would have to keep the machine with the modem on to use the internet. </s>
<s> How well the wireless will work all depends on the variables. </s>
<s> How strong a signal your router puts out, how sensitive your wireless card is, how far away you are from your router, how thick the walls or floors in your case are, and any outside interference. </s>
<s> If you provide more information about your setup you may be able to get more feedback. </s>
