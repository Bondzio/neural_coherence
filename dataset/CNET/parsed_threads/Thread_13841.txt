<s> Currently, I have a computer connected to the Internet via a outlet modem jack (that sends a signal to an outlet in another room that is connected to the phone line). </s>
<s> I want to hook this computer up to broadband (cable) without running any wires to the computer. </s>
<s> (The computer, by the way, is on the other side of the room from the cable wire.) </s>
<s> Can I have the cable connection to the computer without any wires from the cable wire in the wall to the computer? </s>
<s> And if so, how and what equipment do I need? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> For broadband (cable) you will need a cable wire to connect to a broadband modem. </s>
<s> So, yes you will need a wire. </s>
<s> The modem then connects to an ethernet port on the back of your computer. </s>
<s> Connect this way: Internet ----- cable modem ----- wireless router ~ ~ ~ computer (with wireless network adapter). </s>
<s> Sometimes the cable modem has a built-in wireless router: Internet ----- cable modem/router ~ ~ ~ computer (with wireless network adapter). </s>
<s> wired ----- wireless ~ ~ ~ NOTE: You can always replace the wireless connection by making a wired connection between the router and a wired network adapter on the computer. </s>
