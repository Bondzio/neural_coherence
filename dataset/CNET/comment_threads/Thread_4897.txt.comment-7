AnandTech recently had a round-up of p965 based boards and the ECS topped out at a 300mhz FSB.
Memory was run as DDR2-900 with 2:3 ratio and very relaxed timings (5-4-4-15).
http://www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx?i=2914&p=2 Given the ECS' moderate overclocking potential, I'd recommend you first test your current memory and see what timings they can run at as ddr2-667.
If they're no worse than 5-5-5-12, then just get 2 more sticks of good ddr2-533, set all 4 to the same ddr2-667 timings, and set your FSB to 250mhz (2.3ghz cpu).
