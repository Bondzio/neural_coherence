1.1.1	I know that the wireless not working is an oft asked question , but I have browsed through what I thought were relevant threads and also the first sticky thread and I ca n't find what I 'm doing wrong ( or maybe it 's there somewhere , but I have no idea how to use the solutions given ? ) .	Ques
1.1.2	Hopefully someone can help me out or point me in the right direction .	St
1.1.3	I have set up my network in the suggested way in the sticky thread , with the exception of setting the WPA .	St
1.1.4	When I select the WPA option , it does n't give me any place to input a password ?	Ques
1.1.5	So I have it set on the WEP-64 bits ( umm..is that bad ? ) .	St
1.1.6	It is now wall -- & gt ; cable modem -- & gt ; wireless router -- & gt ; pc/laptop It all worked fine before , until I formatted my PC .	St
1.1.7	I must have mucked around with some settings and since the format , I ca n't connect my laptop to the router wirelessly .	St
1.1.8	When I plug my PC to the router with an ethernet cable , it works fine , same with the laptop .	St
1.1.9	On my laptop , I can see the SSID there when I search for networks , but it fails to connect because it 'is not receiving a response from the router or access point ' .	St
1.1.10	I have attempted unplugging and replugging , and powering off and on , and resetting both the modem and the router .	St
1.1.11	I 've tried reinstalling the driver and utilities .	St
1.1.12	I 'm fairly certain it 's something in the settings of the router that I 've got wrong , rather than the router being broken , as it was working fine before the format .	St
1.1.13	I tried my brothers laptop as well , and it also could n't connect because there was no reponse .	St
1.1.14	The modem is a Motorola SB5101 , the router is a Diamond Digital R100 .	St
1.1.15	My PC is running on XP and my laptop is running on Vista .	St
1.1.16	Let me know if there 's any other info needed ?	Ques
1.1.17	Any help would be much appreciated , this is driving me insane .	Polite
1.2.1	Head out and test the laptop at a free wifi hotspot .	St
1.2.2	If that works I reset the router to factory settings and then set it up AGAIN per our forum sticky .	St
1.2.3	Without that test you 're never sure where the issue is .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the tip - however I forgot to mention , I can connect to someone elses ( a neighbour ? )	Ques
1.3.2	unsecured wireless on my laptop without any issues .	St
1.3.3	Is that kind of the same as testing it at a free wifi hotspot ... ?	Ques
1.3.4	Having done that , I 've tried resetting the router several times already and gone through the setup process as per the sticky and using the manual .	St
1.3.5	The lights are all blinking as normal , too .	St
1.4.1	Try disabling the security features first .	St
1.4.2	Go with an open system .	St
1.4.3	You 'll need a wired connection to the router to do this .	St
1.4.4	Make sure it will handle giving out DHCP addresses .	St
1.4.5	On you laptop , if you are trying to use the wireless card 's configuration utility , I suggest using the Windows one instead .	St
1.4.6	Make sure that , if your router handles the IP addresses , your laptop 's wireless device is set to DHCP .	St
1.4.7	With this basic configuration , you should be able to connect .	St
1.4.8	You should see an & quot ; acquiring IP address message & quot ; .	St
1.4.9	This should mean that the laptop and router at least acknowledge each other 's presence .	St
1.4.10	If this works , you can begin to reapply the security features .	St
1.4.11	I must think that , if you can select WPA as an option , there 's a way to plug in your code/passphrase .	St
1.4.12	Not always are these on the same screen in the router configuration .	St
1.4.13	You may need to search for it .	St
1.4.14	These security settings can be picky .	St
1.4.15	You 'll see some wanting hex and some alpha/numeric .	St
1.4.16	Some wo n't accept certain characters and some are fairly free with what you can plug in .	St
1.4.17	You 'll likely have to type in a long code two or more times .	St
1.4.18	What I 've found simpler is to type it out once in something like Notepad .	St
1.4.19	Save the file and put it on a flash drive or some such .	St
1.4.20	You can copy and past the code into the appropriate boxes for both your router and laptop .	St
1.4.21	This helps eliminate those maddening typos where you know it was n't your mistake .	St
1.4.22	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	Unless you missed a setup or forget to unplug the ethernet after you setup the router the wifi on the router looks dead to me .	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks for the help guys .	St
1.6.2	I set it up again from scratch and made a tiny improvement in that my laptop would connect for a while ( a minute or so ) before disconnecting itself .	St
1.6.3	I 've bought a new router , so I 'm praying the problem is the old router and not the settings , or else I 've just bought a new router that wo n't work either Thanks again .	St
