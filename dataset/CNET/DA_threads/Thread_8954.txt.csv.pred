1.1.1	After fixing a hardware issue in my computer, I was in the process of copying files from my D: drive to my C: drive and the computer spontaneously restarted.	St
1.1.2	It would not boot back into windows and I ended up installing/booting from my D: drive.	St
1.1.3	Back in windows, I discovered that my old primary HDD did not have any readings inside windows (disk size was 0 bytes), and when I try to browse the drive, it says it is not formatted.	St
1.1.4	I have a backup from February 2005 but nothing since then... Is there anything I can do to possibly get any information off of the drive?	St
1.1.5	AMD 64 3000+ EPox 9NDA3 ATi 9600XT 1GB GEIL PC3200DDR (2x512) 160gb SATA Samsung (the one that crashed) 130gb IDE WD hdd (currently running windows) 30gb IDE WD hdd (not involved in the whole screwup) Thanks, Peter Allen	St
1.2.1	You would have to send it to a commercial data-recovery company, and that is not cheap, so only do so if the data is very valuable.	St
1.3.1	Since your boot drive was the SATA drive, perhaps your bios settings were altered when it rebooted?	St
1.3.2	Have you checked there to see if the drive is still set to boot from?	St
1.3.3	I would start there, and then see if you can get access to it for any files that might be on it still.	St
1.3.4	Don't forget that you also need to install the SATA drivers (or at least the instructions for it) from a floppy disk by pressing the F6 key during the initial Windows XP install window....it will ask for the disk a little later in the installation and not immediately, so if you need to reinstall XP to that SATA drive look for that.	St
1.3.5	There are options also available to either install XP to the SATA drive or do a repair which will let you install XP over the top of itself and leave your other files intact that are still there so if there's a chance of doing this, you might still be OK.	St
1.3.6	There are some recovery tools that are freeware and shareway here: Make sure you check to see which ones work with XP as some don't.	St
