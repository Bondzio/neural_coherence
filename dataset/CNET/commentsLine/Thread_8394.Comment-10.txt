...you can accomplish anything.
i do not recommend the following methods or practices unless you are a fully certified lunatic like me!
take an old processor fan which is too big for the chipset, drill some holes in your motherboard to fix over northbridge chipset, locate an extra fan power connecter or cut up the existing one and tape the cables to it, and hey presto!
a cool chipset.
really don't try this on your main pc get some old gear and pimp your mobo!
