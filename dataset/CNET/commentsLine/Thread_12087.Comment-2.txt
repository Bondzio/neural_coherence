print server driver/firmware update  driver/firmware update for the printer  now for the fun part.
ask yourself this question, where are the printer drivers for this software?
i don't know a lot on this, because i'm not a tech person, but i have a small network of three laptops using a print server.
all three laptops have the network software for the printers so they can print.
i have this set up so i don't have to leave any computer on so the others can print.
i know where i work, when i choose print, i can go to print server1 or print server2.
so i'm guessing that these print servers have the software to print to the many printers on the network.
each printer has a ip address.
not sure if i helped you or not but good luck with this.
