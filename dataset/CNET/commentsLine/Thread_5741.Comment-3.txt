sorry but i do not have the specifics of this machine at my finger tips.
please be patient and i will reconnect it to a monitor so i can get the model #.
this machine is 6yrs old and it is a power spec with xp operating system.
it has been a great system up until now.
everthing else works fine except the usb ports.
i just went and bought another tower its a dell with windows 7 os.
i would still like to be able to transfer files through the usb ports if at all possible.
is this something i can fix or is this computer junk?
thanks troy
