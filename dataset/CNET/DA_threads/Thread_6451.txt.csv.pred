1.1.1	I'm looking to buy a new gaming PC in the next couple months, and am currently looking at this one here: http://www.trademe.co.nz/Computers/Desktops/LCD-monitor/auction-243943903.htm As far as high performance gaming goes, is this gonna perform well?	St
1.1.2	The highest spec game I'll be playing is probably GTA IV, and then just older ones like Half-Life 2.	St
1.1.3	Thanks in advance for any help!	St
1.2.1	The GeForce 9800GT is a staple of the usual gamer.	St
1.2.2	You can research all the parts but what you are looking at is the garden variety gamer machine.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Ok well I'm not into anything too fancy so that sounds good to me.	St
1.3.2	So this sort of computer will be able to run my games no problems?	St
1.3.3	Not necessarily on highest resolution or anything just nice smooth gameplay.	St
1.4.1	But to say that games, Windows would not have problems is something I can't bring myself to write.	St
