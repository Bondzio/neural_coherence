I didn't see any indication of recommended memory anywhere, and, again, though my previous motherboard wasn't as good, it ran on the same RAM without a hitch.
But what would you suggest I do?
Find RAM running at 333?
I'm having a very hard time understanding why my previous set up worked better than this one.
The performance is just as bad when I'm not running any big apps.
Cursor lag, window lag, it's very disturbing, and it is absolutely boggling my mind.
