<s> Hey guys, Sorry if this has been covered before. </s>
<s> I have a laptop with a G internal wireless network card, and during the summer months when I have time off, I take the laptop up to the lake and would like to use the internet for basic things though the open networks that are up there. </s>
<s> Currently I can see some networks up there some locked out other not, but unfortunately I am just unable to get a strong enough signal to connect to the open ones. </s>
<s> For windows users maybe 1 or 2 bars (20-30%) or about -75 - -90 db. </s>
<s> For something to try I bought a D-link dwa 160 dual band usb wireless N unit to try and boost the range which it did to a point.Now I was getting (50-60%)/(-65 - -80db) or 3 bars on the protected networks and 1 or 2 on the un protected. </s>
<s> Just enough to for the network to issues me an IP address but not enough to do anything online. </s>
<s> I am wondering if there is any devices out there any one can recommend to improve my range and allow me to connect to some of those open networks I can see. </s>
<s> I see allot of antennas and boosters out there but as far as I know those are meant for transmission of existing networks not necessarily reception of WIFI. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated, Thanks, soundguy_99 </s>
<s> Unprotected signals mean the owner will, eventually, lock it up. </s>
<s> Especially when they notice their network in use. </s>
<s> In your case, accessing these signals is, by definition, &quot;Theft of Service&quot;. </s>
