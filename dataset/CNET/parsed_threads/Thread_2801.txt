<s> I was going through Newegg looking for parts to build a gaming rig, and came across two processors, both Intel i5's, and both 1156 chipsets. </s>
<s> My question was, Should I go with the Quad core one at 2.8 GHz, or the Dual core one at 3.2 GHz? </s>
<s> The dual core is cheaper, and I have heard that the higher clock speed is better for games, while more cores are better for things like Photoshop that are written to be CPU dependent. </s>
<s> I'm sure both will work, but is it worth saving the $30 and losing two cores? </s>
<s> Most i5s have hyperthreaded cores so you see 4 cores in task manager. </s>
<s> And then the i5 has the turbo boost to let a core clock up dynamically. </s>
<s> My bet is the i5 will consistently beat the older Core 2 Quad core CPUs. </s>

<s> And what if I went with an AMD Phenom X4? </s>
<s> I found a nice looking one at 3.5GHz on newegg for $190ish. </s>
<s> I know Intel tends to be more on the cutting edge, but I'm trying to stay under $1000, and I need to focus on the gpu more than the cpu, because the rig I want to build will be for games primarily. </s>
<s> You could check the CPU charts are tomshardware.com to see but I don't use the AMD units anymore since I don't want to sacrifice my time getting such things sorted out. </s>
