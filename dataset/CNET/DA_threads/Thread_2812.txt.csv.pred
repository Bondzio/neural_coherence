1.1.1	My rig has very specific power requirements and this is the only one I can find with the power and user reviews being positive .	St
1.1.2	Tom 's Hardware guide does n't list it in any reviews , though .	St
1.1.3	I 've vaguely heard of this brand and it seemed to be positive .	St
1.1.4	The brand that THG recommends , Antec , does n't put out enough +12V current .	St
1.1.5	I think the highest for Antec was 19 amps at the +12V .	St
1.1.6	I 'm needing at least 25 amps at the +12V .	St
1.1.7	There are quite a few other brands that say their PS 's put out the required current but THG says many brands fib .	St
1.1.8	Which brings me back to the subject header ... .	St
1.1.9	Thanks for any help	St
1.2.1	I do n't own one myself , but it has been highly recommended by many in these forums .	St
1.2.2	Given your requirements , I would contact the seller for additional assurance and/or guarantee of it 's performance .	St
1.3.1	If you know what you need and ca n't find it , then certainly PCP & C is close to whatever you need .	St
1.3.2	You may even want to talk to them for special needs provided you have the wallet for it .	St
1.3.3	In other words , you truly get what you pay for .	St
1.3.4	You may want to check this website : http : //www.sparklepower.com I wish my end-uers had PCP & C just to step away from persistant ATX power issues .	St
1.3.5	Yeah , they 're expensive but the end result is far better that what 's usually offered out there .	St
1.3.6	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
