so the sli-ready is probably fine since 12w will come off the pci-e board connection and the other two connectors only need lesss than 20w each.
a single rail high voltage psu will feed power to both pci-e connectors from the single rail, but others will feed it from two rails.
if you're still worried, this sli certified one will definitely fit the bill for $90 since each 12v rail is rated at 25w: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371026
