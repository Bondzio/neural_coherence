i developed a problem a while back with an old amd duron that i had.
whenever i played intensive games, shut down and turned the computer on afterwards, the power lights would go on but it wouldn't boot up.
i took it to the tech shop and it turns out that the fan/heatsink i had was inadequate to properly cool the processor.
the fact that the games run for half an hour and simply crash really makes me think it is a heating issue.
