i think you find on other posts here, that the manufacturers of ssd devices, have already come up with driver algorithms that reduce the probability that the drive will fail anytime soon.
if you look at amazon user reviews for ssds, i see no panic at the useful life of these drives.
i would be more concerned with ram and page file writes, but it looks like your tablet has the right amount at 4gbs to reduce this factor; besides the fact that an arm processor does business way different than the usual windows or apple pc architecture, for that matter.
