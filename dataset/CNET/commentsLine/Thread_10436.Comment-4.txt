finally found the ez answer i was looking for: &quot;yes, you can make a clone as a replacement.
however, please note that universal restore option only works when restoring an image from the backup archive.
so if you have any hardware changes (except for the replacement of the hard drive) the clone feature will not work properly.
the scenario that you have described is fully working.
please remember to unplug the second hard drive after cloning process.&quot;
