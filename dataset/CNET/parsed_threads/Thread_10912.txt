<s> I know for a fact that the laptop I'm about to purchase 1)takes a desktop processor and 2)says it can only take a Wolfdale Intel Core 2 Duo only up to 2.66ghz. </s>
<s> Right now, I could either spend on Newegg $164.99 for the Wolfdale Core 2 Duo 2.66ghz E8200 or spend five bucks more $169.99 for an E8400 which is 3.0ghz. </s>
<s> Just as for as pricing goes, it makes a lot more sense to spend the extra five bucks for the faster one. </s>
<s> Also, I could very well use it in a different computer in the future in which case its full potential would be used. </s>
<s> Can I use the 3.0ghz cpu without damaging anything even though the specs for the laptop/motherboard say it only goes up to 2.66? </s>
<s> Thanks as always! </s>
<s> for some reason, I was looking at Wolfdale instead of Conroe. </s>
<s> So, same question, but Conroe not Wolfdale. </s>
<s> the E8200 and E8400 isn't right either </s>
<s> the bios may not handle other processors and the laptop's cooling may not be able to cope with processors with higher tdp. </s>
<s> I thought cooling might be an issue, but that deal for the faster processor just looked so enticing. </s>
<s> Don't fret. </s>
<s> Your laptop *might* have some settings in its BIOS for overclocking. </s>
<s> If so, those desktop Core 2 Duos do quite well with overclocking, at least in desktops In a laptop, you'll want to be VERY careful - use one of those laptop cooling pads with the fans in it, increase the front-side bus speed very gradually, and only have it overclocked when you've got the machine plugged into the mains. </s>
<s> And do whatever you can to keep the air going into the laptop cool as well, i.e. </s>
<s> no direct sunlight, and air-con. </s>
