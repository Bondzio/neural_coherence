if it's a 720p tv (most likely) set the resolution for either 1366x768 or 1280x720.
if it's a 1080p tv, then set it for 1920x1080.
as for glare, that depends on where you'll be using it and how it's positioned.
you should place a tv that size at least 3 ft from your eyes (much further than a 22&quot;) or you may cause eyestrain and have to move your neck/head too much to see the full image.
