<s> Currently, PCs put the monitor in power save mode, but the monitor is still consuming some power. </s>
<s> In an enterprise, a single building may have hundreds or thousands of PCs. </s>
<s> More money would be saved if the monitor is completely shut down. </s>
<s> The savings is beyond the power consumed by the Monitor. </s>
<s> Any electronic device creates heat. </s>
<s> This heat has to be pumped out later when the air conditioning is turned back on. </s>
<s> THis also costs money, and is a comnplete waste. </s>
<s> A slow drip in a tub will fill the tub. </s>
<s> Savings can be done by building the PC with a plug in the back to power the Monitor. </s>
<s> If the PC is inactive for a configuarable time limit (different than the screen saver limit), then the PC will shut power off to the monitor. </s>
<s> THis will all be moot when we all switch to laptops, but in the meantime... </s>
<s> monitors got their power from the PC's power supply. </s>
<s> that's why old PC's had that weird plug. </s>
<s> but the amount of power drawn by a sleeping LCD monitor is trivial... most are less than 1 watt. </s>
<s> someone microwaving popcorn will offset the 'savings'. </s>
<s> likewise, LCDs give off practically no heat when asleep. </s>
<s> and that excess heat from your pc can actually reduce your heating bills in the winter. </s>
<s> works for me, every time Power consumption for computers is a big deal. </s>
<s> For example, a couple of the big names (yahoo, MSoft) located new centers near my in-law's home, specifically because the county has among the lowest electrical costs in the US -- the electrical costs are a significant portion of their expense. </s>
<s> Another e.g., a single &quot;super computer&quot; will use as much electricity as a medium-large town. </s>
<s> It's expensive in monetary terms, let alone if you consider the environmental effects. </s>
<s> It seems to me the industry has been rather slow to wake up and care - there's just little/no emphasis or interest in consumer markets. </s>
<s> Awareness is the first step. </s>
<s> I went to the extreme here and ordered up a P3 power meter. </s>
<s> My home entertainment system was drawing 65 Watts when off. </s>
<s> It's now at less than half that but my point is that we need to know where the drain is in order to do more about it. </s>
<s> One of my recent savings was not my choice. </s>
<s> Our fridge died and the new one is some 70 bucks a year estimated. </s>
<s> I seem to remember the old one was closer to 300 or more. </s>

<s> The practical &quot;green advice&quot; for frigs in general if over 5yrs. </s>
<s> old, pitch it or donate. </s>
<s> Don't move it to the garage for liquids coolers but actually get rid of it. </s>
<s> -OR- at least use the newest frigs you got to do the same. </s>
<s> The energy saving matters over time but may not for short usage, like in a summer cabin/cottage but again if you're really out there any saving is worth it. </s>
<s> I wonder what they say about those old GMC(Frigitaire) models that ran for 30yrs.+? </s>
<s> At my house meter it barely turns, my consumption is as low as it goes. </s>
<s> But, I'm sure the frig is the biggest power user after the electrical water heater. </s>
