Laptop drives follow the 2.5 convention.
Just get your hands on a mounting kit for laptop which is 2.5 and if possible to clear any thought, &quot;a kit&quot; that includes everything that may or may not be needed.
Google away, they're common.
Be aware laptop drives use the std.
44-pin connection though some vendors make an extra interface layer(connection), if yours is like this(can be removed?)
be sure anything you buy is &quot;compatible&quot; with your model#, etc., and if it doesn't work, any return policy.
