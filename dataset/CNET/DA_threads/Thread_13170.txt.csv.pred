1.2.1	Good afternoon , I have an AMD Athlon 3500+ with 2 GB of ram ( 4 3200 crucial DDR pieces , not super fast RAM ) , 4 hard drives adding up to 1.3 TB an ATI All IN Wonder AIW x300 video card , built in audio , I forget the motherboard , a crummy ECS something or other .	St

1.2.3	1 dvdrw drive - NEC .	St
1.2.4	I run a 550 watt power supply unit with dual fans , i think it is the Antec TruePower 2.0 550W .	St
1.2.5	I have had it running almost 24-7 for about 10 months .	St
1.2.6	Works well .	St
1.2.7	I would play it safe if you are going to increase the number of hard drives later .	St
1.2.8	I increased mine and probably will again .	St
1.2.9	Plus , you have a power sucker video card with a tv tuner card and the audio card .	St
1.2.10	Get the Enermax 660 watt model EPS12V 660W .	St

1.5.1	Having a high wattage unit installed wo n't hurt your system .	St
1.5.2	The system will take what it needs on demand .	St
1.5.3	The bigger the wattage the better the wattage cushion as system needs grow .	St
1.5.4	Yeah , it 's big enough BUT it must be a namebrand psu .	St
1.5.5	That way , you 'll get the true stable output any system will need .	St
1.5.6	Heck , they 're 600W+ psu out there now .	St
1.5.7	Consider , whatever the final calculations are for your needs then add 25 % to it for a good indication of a good fit .	St
