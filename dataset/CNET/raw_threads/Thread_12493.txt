I am not sure how this works(im not really that expereienced with computers) but apparently to change your IP address if you have broadband you have to speak to your ISP. Is there any other way? Additional info: I am using a wirless router(does this mean the router has an different IP?)

As such I think it proper that other sites respect the site ban and not help others &quot;get around&quot; the ban. Instead, make amends with those you offended. Bob
