i have had for several years a pc dedicated to the task of recording tv, as well as a modded x-box for watching and listening to media from my home network.
anymore i cannot turn on just one computer when i sit at my home office desk.
i always have to have my dedicated burning station up, my primary computer and usually either my mp3 or tv storage system up.
my torrent server stays on all the time, and many times i have found myself using up to 7 or more computers at the same time.
sometimes i will be recording a tv program on one, watching a tv show from another on my x-box, surfing and burning on two others and building yet another workstation for someone or some purpose, all at the same time.
and yes, i amd male, live alone, and am un-married....why do you ask?
?
