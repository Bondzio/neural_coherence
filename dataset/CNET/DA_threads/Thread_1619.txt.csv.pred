1.1.1	Just a general question , I 'm a n00b and so I ask .	St
1.1.2	My PC has 6GB RAM 1333 MhZ Full Specs [ IMG ] http : //i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb228/Jaxx89/fullspecs.png [ /IMG ] Now as I check in CPU-Z and speccy , I see that my RAM is utilized at a max of 540MhZ .	St
1.1.3	What I need to know is , when I have 1333MhZ Memory DIMMs , then why is it not utilizing to its full capacity .	St
1.1.4	Or is it that 533MhZ is the actual speed and the 1333MhZ speed is what I can get only by OC'ing ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	[ IMG ] http : //i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb228/Jaxx89/FullRAMusage.png [ /IMG ] Please let me know .	St
1.2.1	That 1333 is n't really mhz clock speed .	St
1.2.2	That will depend on many factors including your CPU clock speed .	St
1.2.3	As well , DDR RAM is supposed to transfer twice the data of non DDR at the same clock speed ... or something like that .	St
1.2.4	Here 's more on the numbers game .	St
1.2.5	The RAM cited here is a bit dated but you can get a better idea of what the numbers might mean .	St
1.2.6	As long as you use identical RAM in all 6 slots , you should n't experience performance drops .	St
