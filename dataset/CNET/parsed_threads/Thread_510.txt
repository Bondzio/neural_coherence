<s> I am using the monitor that came with my Dell Dimension 4600. </s>
<s> The display on the screen constantly resizes itself especially after the computer has been off for a while. </s>
<s> When I turn my computer on the display is too big to fit the screen and then after I change it to smaller, the display begins to shrink so there is a 5mm black area around the screen. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do to fix this? </s>
<s> By your description of the problem I assume that this is a CRT monitor?? </s>
<s> How old is it?? </s>

<s> Yes I do have a CRT monitor. </s>
<s> I have had it since 2003. </s>
<s> Does anybody have an answer? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> for you to upgrade to the latest technology. </s>
<s> If you haven't noticed lately, all desktops are sold with LCD (Flat screen) monitors. </s>
<s> If you live in the US, you can get one from Office Depot or Best Buy at the cheapest for around $200-$250. </s>
<s> If you can't afford the LCD, I recommend you to go to the nearest computer store, Goodwill or Salvation Army and pick up a cheap CRT monitor for $10, maybe $20. </s>
<s> Anyhow, if you don't feel like spending any money, all I can say is deal with it. </s>
<s> 5mm around the screen isn't that bad but, it would probably aggrevate me too. </s>
<s> I like my LCD. </s>
<s> The picture is so much clearer. </s>
<s> Good luck with your search. </s>
<s> Once I get some money (just bought a new PSU and GPU) I think im gunna buy an LCD monitor. </s>
<s> I was wondering tho, could it be the battery inside the computer that is not remembering the size? </s>
<s> Maybe its loosing its power? </s>
<s> Get a friends monitor and try that and see if it does the same thing. </s>
<s> Then you can see if it is the monitor or the PC. </s>
<s> Here is a good deal on the link below. </s>
<s> I am pretty sure when you are ready you may even get a better deal on a good LCD monitor. </s>

<s> Thx for the link, ill try to get another monitor to test my pc with </s>
<s> That will help you narrow it down to one or the other. </s>
