1.1.1	I want to burn dvds so that they play on dvd players these will contain still and video pictures.	St
1.1.2	We have a dell Vostro with Vista and a dell Inspiron 6000 with XP.	St
1.1.3	the Vostro has a dvd burner but dvds done on it may or may not work on players.	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions for an external burner and software that will produce dvds that will reliably play on dvd players as well as on other computers???	St
1.1.5	Thanks Ed S	St
1.2.1	First there is no standard DVD that holds such.	St
1.2.2	Then you have players that don't play recorded media to those that play DVD+R but not DVD-R and vice versa.	St
1.2.3	There is no panacea.	St
1.2.4	However I continue to use DVD FLICK for simple video DVDs and for photos I may try www.photodex.com or just put the jpegs on a Data DVD and find that many of the newer players work fine.	St
1.2.5	Sorry but this is a minefield of problems, issues, compatibilities and more.	St
1.2.6	I've found I need to choose my battles here.	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I don't think there is a 100% reliable DVD burner and software out there.	St
1.3.2	You have to try one (1) yourself.	St
1.3.3	Have you burned playable videos for TV before?	St
1.3.4	I use multiple DVD roms (ASUS, NEC, Liteon, TEAC) and Nero software, it works 90% of the time.	St
1.3.5	You need to try 1 man, no need to fear this.	Sug
