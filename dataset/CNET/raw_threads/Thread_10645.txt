I bought a Vista computer last Christmas with only 1GB of memory on it and the improvement after I added a second was profound. Most Vista systems now come with 2 GB of RAM. This change came about only a few months after I bought the computer. I'm now hoping to upgrade to 4 GB in a few years. Unfortunately I only have two slots so I'll have to get 2 GB of RAM/slot. For me your new lower price is good news maybe I can up grade sooner then I thought. RAMs come in many forms. The faster they are the more they cost. Remember that old saying &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;. Here a link to some good basic information. Read it carefully before going RAM shopping.
