<s> Hello, I'm trying to doctor up my old PC for a year or so until my income goes up a bit more and I can invest in a whole new system. </s>
<s> At spywareinfoforum .com I got some help updating my software and getting my spyware figured out, so I'm going to look at my hardware now. </s>
<s> I know I need to clean all the dust out of my PC and will be getting some compressed air to do that. </s>
<s> While I have the cover off, I was thinking of replacing my two 1G RAM sticks with two 2G RAM sticks. </s>
<s> (I would install two 4G RAM sticks, but it sounds like a 32bit system can't do that, only a 64bit system can) I was going to just pop on Newegg and just order a couple sticks and call it a day, but I noticed there are several different kinds of them. </s>
<s> DDR, DDR2, DDR3 etc. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what to get and I was hoping for a little guidance. </s>
<s> I also heard something about checking my power supply too? </s>
<s> Not sure how worried I should be about this. </s>
<s> My system: Windows Vista x32 Home Premium Service Pack 2 (build:6002) AMD Athalon 64x2 Dual Core Processor X2 with 2Gbyte; NVIDIA GeForce 7300LE. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions, or insight into what I'm doing here would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> As I don't see make and model here, I can't guess what it uses. </s>

<s> I'd look at crucial.com and Dell Docs too. </s>
